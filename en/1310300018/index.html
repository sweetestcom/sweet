<p>Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it going today?</p>
<p>Good morning to you.</p>
<p>Lindsay, thank you for recording with me.</p>
<p>So early in the morning, guys, we&rsquo;re in different time zones and Lindsay is up bright and early</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s so nice of her.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a morning person, Michelle.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t mind at all, but maybe our listeners can hear that my voice is a real</p>
<p>morning voice.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes you can really hear the difference in someone&rsquo;s voice in the morning</p>
<p>versus the evening versus the afternoon.</p>
<p>Do you get that too?</p>
<p>I always feel like I have a morning voice, but I feel like it&rsquo;s worn off.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>In the past few years, I don&rsquo;t notice my morning voice as much.</p>
<p>And I have to say, Lindsay, I don&rsquo;t really hear that you have a morning voice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad to hear that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It might be having kids that you&rsquo;re up all the time with the kids, right?</p>
<p>Every time is the morning for me.</p>
<p>Oh my God, what are we talking about today, Michelle?</p>
<p>What are we getting into?</p>
<p>Well, we spoke recently, I believe it was episode, I think it was episode 1904 about</p>
<p>the word buzzkill.</p>
<p>And actually, it&rsquo;s so funny, like sometimes this stuff happens with the show, Lindsay.</p>
<p>We were talking about how Obama said buzzkill.</p>
<p>And then like the day afterwards, I was watching a show, and they used buzzkill.</p>
<p>And they used wet blanket, which we also spoke about.</p>
<p>Oh, I love that.</p>
<p>Guys, I hope that&rsquo;s happening to our listeners too, right?</p>
<p>Because now they recognize those words, and they&rsquo;re finding them out in the world.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m like, okay, like, you know, we&rsquo;re teaching the right stuff here.</p>
<p>Because I mean, I literally the next day after we recorded, so guys, this really I mean,</p>
<p>these are the stuff that we teach you is stuff that you will hear.</p>
<p>So really listen for it, because you never know when you&rsquo;re going to hear something.</p>
<p>Let us know in like a review or email us or however, let us know, maybe like a fun thing</p>
<p>would be to let us know of funny times where that&rsquo;s happened to you with the show.</p>
<p>Like have you ever listened to an episode and then like the very next day, you know,</p>
<p>that like, you heard it, I&rsquo;d love to hear if you guys have had those experiences.</p>
<p>Yes, guys, let us know.</p>
<p>And you know, while you&rsquo;re at it, write in your question request, right, your episode</p>
<p>topic requests, send them to lindsay at all ears, english.com.</p>
<p>We love getting your episode ideas.</p>
<p>So send it right in.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So but that was kind of off of this episode, because we were saying the word total.</p>
<p>So we called something a total buzzkill.</p>
<p>And we were saying like, well, I mean, Lindsay, what&rsquo;s the difference if I just say something</p>
<p>is, oh, it was a buzzkill and or if I say, oh, it was a total buzzkill?</p>
<p>What does that word do?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, it makes it sound more natural.</p>
<p>For me, sometimes it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a filler word a little bit.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It kind of helps me to feel more natural and what I&rsquo;m saying, emphasize it.</p>
<p>It softens it a little bit, but it also makes it more extreme, right?</p>
<p>Yes, it was a total buzzkill.</p>
<p>It was really, really a buzzkill.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, Michelle, are you there?</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Can you hear me?</p>
<p>Yeah, now I can.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep going.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep going.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We lost each other for a second, but here we were.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I feel like it sounds more emphatic, like more extreme, but in a way, like what</p>
<p>you said, in some ways, it&rsquo;s just kind of a filler.</p>
<p>Which is really interesting.</p>
<p>Actually, a lot of words are like that.</p>
<p>You know, we think they mean something, but sometimes they&rsquo;re just put there to take up</p>
<p>a space to feel more rhythm in what we&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>It just kind of sounds good.</p>
<p>It sounds cool.</p>
<p>It sounds zippy.</p>
<p>It sounds cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, zippy.</p>
<p>Zippy.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Zippy basically means complete.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s do some examples.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the first one?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So it was a total bummer that he couldn&rsquo;t make it to the party, or that commute was</p>
<p>a total nightmare.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It just makes me sound more convincing, in a way, you know?</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another one, guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d let you in, but my house is a total mess right now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Or he&rsquo;s a total cutie.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it can be used to emphasize, but sometimes it&rsquo;s just for the rhythm.</p>
<p>And, Lindsay, do you think that, I mean, this can be used in, like, do you think it&rsquo;s formal,</p>
<p>informal, or either?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty informal, you know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would use this in a job interview or a professional situation, right?</p>
<p>Maybe talking with my colleagues in a friendly way, but probably not in a presentation.</p>
<p>This is not presentation language, right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>I mean, this is different, guys, than saying, like, oh, if you&rsquo;re saying, like, oh, the</p>
<p>total numbers for the quarter were, you know, like, that&rsquo;s about, like, an amount.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So that, and we could do something like that, you know, on total another time.</p>
<p>But this is, this is different.</p>
<p>So, like, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good point, Michelle.</p>
<p>Guys, we&rsquo;re not talking about adding up sums of numbers and quantities here, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about making something more interesting, more extreme.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I was trying, when I was coming up with my examples, I mean, yeah, like, he&rsquo;s a total</p>
<p>cutie or sometimes you would hear someone say, oh, he&rsquo;s a total hottie, right?</p>
<p>Like, yeah.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very 90s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very 90s, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But, but, but, but, I was realizing that when I kept on coming up with examples, I feel</p>
<p>like it was more for negative things.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s just the examples I was coming up with, or do you agree with,</p>
<p>like, I feel like we use it more to emphasize something like, oh, a total nightmare, a total</p>
<p>mess, like, rather than, like, a total, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Total delight or something.</p>
<p>Oh, it was a total delight, right?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>You might have a point there, Michelle.</p>
<p>You know, I think sometimes when something is negative, we want to show people how we</p>
<p>feel.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, the cutie is an exception, right?</p>
<p>My house is a total mess.</p>
<p>I mean, just look at the examples that you came up with.</p>
<p>My house is a total mess.</p>
<p>It was a total bummer.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would, I would say that&rsquo;s probably true because we&rsquo;re dramatic.</p>
<p>American English is a little dramatic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little over the top, isn&rsquo;t it, compared to other, you know, British English.</p>
<p>I think they under-emphasize.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this on the show before.</p>
<p>We over-emphasize things, you know?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so, like, that&rsquo;s just what I noticed because I kept on, I was like, okay, example, example,</p>
<p>example.</p>
<p>And then I said, let me think of some, like, positive ones.</p>
<p>And I was having much more trouble than with the negative ones.</p>
<p>So that was kind of interesting to me, what I realized.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at the other ways to say this and see if maybe that&rsquo;s true, if we see that</p>
<p>same thing going on here, right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So yeah, I looked, I looked this up in the dictionary.</p>
<p>Got some, some of these were inspired by the dictionary, but let&rsquo;s go through a few, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go through a few of them.</p>
<p>So, well, this one is fun, like utter.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Utter.</p>
<p>Like, not like U-D-D-R.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a cow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the body part of a cow.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about U-T-T-R, and you should have the transcripts, guys, if you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>the Iowa.</p>
<p>U-T-T-E-R.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what I said?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not what I said.</p>
<p>I think you said U-T-T-R.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>Well, whatever.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So again, how do you spell it, Michelle?</p>
<p>Tell us one more time.</p>
<p>U-T-T-E-R.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And if you were right, I&rsquo;m sorry about that.</p>
<p>No, no, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So guys, if you, by the way, you know, if you want to see how everything is written,</p>
<p>Michelle, where can they go?</p>
<p>How can they see that?</p>
<p>Automatically while they listen.</p>
<p>Oh, to our transcripts, guys, on our app, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And we do have that for iOS and Android now, which is super cool.</p>
<p>So go to hollersenglish.com slash app, and it will redirect you to where you need to</p>
<p>go to get the iOS or the Android app.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So, for example, with utter, you could say, that speech was an utter disgrace to our family</p>
<p>name.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you hear it with like utter disgrace or utter nonsense, but like, I feel</p>
<p>like it sounds very, very formal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like literature-y, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And we talked about E, putting E on the end of a word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s something you might see written in a poem or literature, or it&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>really something your everyday person would say, utter, but it does sound somewhat intellectual</p>
<p>and sort of well-read, I guess.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>The other one you can use that is, you know, is complete, which we also already mentioned.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s more so interchangeable with total.</p>
<p>Not always, like there will be times when like total would sound better than complete.</p>
<p>And you know, that stuff you might just have to listen out for and get used to it.</p>
<p>But yeah, you can say, oh, my place is a complete mess, or my place is a total mess.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, as I&rsquo;m seeing these examples, I think you might be right.</p>
<p>You know, using these words in front of other words to describe things.</p>
<p>Usually those things are negative.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s funny how like, it&rsquo;s something I never thought about until I started</p>
<p>planning the episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Like I thought, okay, this is a complete disaster would be another chunk we might hear a lot</p>
<p>of times, right?</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t say like, this is a complete, I don&rsquo;t even know, like, yeah, you just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say it like, and then there&rsquo;s absolute, right, like, I mean, you know, you can say it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>absolute mess, or it&rsquo;s an absolute disgrace.</p>
<p>But I feel like that one also sounds a little bit more formal somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the function here, like what we&rsquo;re trying to do, what native speakers are</p>
<p>trying to do is just get their point across.</p>
<p>And again, be dramatic, describe how like, kind of dire a situation is in a way is why</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using these, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then we have one more, which I like this one.</p>
<p>This is, I mean, this is, I don&rsquo;t know, I think this one sounds cool.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Downright.</p>
<p>Downright.</p>
<p>So downright.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>So, you know, downright terrible, that is downright terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a downright shame.</p>
<p>I imagine the use of this word in like a small town, an old man sitting in a bar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a downright shame.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I imagine that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how I see that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Okay, Michelle, so should we go ahead and do a role play?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So here we are.</p>
<p>We are at a work happy hour and the place is not a nice place.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also late on top of everything.</p>
<p>Oh no, Michelle.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Hi, Lindsay.</p>
<p>So sorry I&rsquo;m late.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>This place is a total dump.</p>
<p>Oh, I know.</p>
<p>I feel so bad that Jill picked it.</p>
<p>She had no idea it was downright awful.</p>
<p>Well, whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still fun.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Traffic was a complete nightmare.</p>
<p>I figured you got stuck in traffic.</p>
<p>What an utter disgrace that traffic is here.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>An absolute mess.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>We are just complaining and complaining.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having a rough night.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It is hard to be around people that complain all the time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We talked about this before on the show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>There are people out there that just always kind of see that negative side of things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>And it can get exhausting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go through this.</p>
<p>So I said this place is a total dump.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And guys, it&rsquo;s all about the intonation here.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>So a total dump.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just saying a total dump.</p>
<p>You really want to communicate what you think.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s the next one?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You said.</p>
<p>I said she had.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe Jill picked this.</p>
<p>She had no idea it was downright awful.</p>
<p>And again, this one&rsquo;s a little outside of my like common use.</p>
<p>Something that I would use every day.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll hear it in music.</p>
<p>More movies.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear it in stories.</p>
<p>You will definitely hear it and see it, guys.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>And then you said traffic was a complete nightmare.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s I mean, that what is a more used sentence than that?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really good, especially if you live in a place like New York, New Jersey.</p>
<p>The traffic&rsquo;s pretty bad there, isn&rsquo;t it, Michelle?</p>
<p>LA, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Forget about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time in LA this year, this past fall, spent a lot of time</p>
<p>in California traffic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how they handle it.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It sounds terrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s downright terrible, Michelle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s downright terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s downright terrible.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you said what an utter disgrace the traffic is here.</p>
<p>Very formal sounding, but we had to throw it in there as an example.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then you said, seriously, an absolute mess.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So this conversation is obviously a little elevated in terms of our enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Like we are really going after it here.</p>
<p>But guys, this is just an example.</p>
<p>Grab one of these and use it when you feel truly passionate, kind of in a negative way</p>
<p>about something.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And we talk on the show all the time about like, oh, we teach you all sorts of ways to</p>
<p>express yourself.</p>
<p>Like we say, oh, like it would be silly if we were like, oh, we don&rsquo;t want to teach the</p>
<p>words that are used to complain because we don&rsquo;t like to complain.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just a part of life.</p>
<p>Like we got to give you all the materials.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;re complaining.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;re happy, whatever it is, but we want to give you those tools.</p>
<p>Yeah, because we know that you guys, what you want to be able to do is connect, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our ultimate goal together is to help you connect.</p>
<p>And the only way you can actually have true connection is if someone sees the real you,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And those people, the right people in your life are going to see you and love you for</p>
<p>who you really are.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Oh, such a deep thought.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>I love it, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Well, this was fun.</p>
<p>This was really fun.</p>
<p>And yeah, well, hopefully we don&rsquo;t have too much to complain about today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll skip the complaining for today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a beautiful day.</p>
