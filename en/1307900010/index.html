    <p>Today&rsquo;s show is sponsored by the multi-academy award-winning first world war themed film</p>
<p>1917 which is available to own starting March 10th on digital streaming and on March 24th on 4k ultra HD and blu-ray</p>
<p>More on what&rsquo;s available then at the end of our upcoming interview with Fred Kaplan</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hardcore history</p>
<p>You may not be interested in war the war is interested in you</p>
<p>That is a wonderful quote by</p>
<p>What would you call him founding father of modern Soviet communism, maybe Leon Trotsky</p>
<p>The guy Stalin had an assassin go halfway around the world</p>
<p>To assassinate with an axe pick so dangerous was he?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great line though, isn&rsquo;t it? You may not be interested in war but war is interested in you says a lot</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It says basically that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you want to go think about happy things or focus on other</p>
<p>Pursuits and things maybe that you have more control over after all</p>
<p>What do I have to do with a giant war that may start with government somewhere?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just go about my life and and and do my own thing and let those people worry about their own things</p>
<p>Except their own things will turn into your own things at some point, right? The war will be interested in you</p>
<p>I thought about that</p>
<p>when I thought about</p>
<p>What would happen if we could rationally?</p>
<p>divide our thinking energy based on threat level and triage and</p>
<p>Try to come up with an idea of how much time we should spend on this or that given issue, right?</p>
<p>How much time how much mental energy?</p>
<p>In a realistic sense should an educated individual in a modern society devote to thinking about</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>in this case</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about nuclear war</p>
<p>Something that I think a rational person</p>
<p>Would have to admit if you thought about it for five seconds belong somewhere up near the top of your triage list</p>
<p>It used to be there</p>
<p>People used to think a lot about this when they thought it could happen at any minute</p>
<p>The funny part is it could still kind of happen at any minute</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised how quickly the tensions could ramp up and we could be in a situation</p>
<p>Where everybody forgets about that virus that mutated that might be coming over here and might give you a flu-like</p>
<p>symptoms might kill millions of people like the</p>
<p>1919 flu all of that starts to fade into the background when you start talking about people using</p>
<p>You know serious mega tonnage on your fellow, man</p>
<p>It is also funny to me in a triage sense that when we think about</p>
<p>The use of nuclear weapons today we think about an</p>
<p>infinitely less dangerous scenario than the one I grew up with we think about some rogue state somewhere getting a few nuclear weapons and</p>
<p>And using them somewhere and it&rsquo;s dangerous because we think about this as a much less controlled</p>
<p>System so the likelihood of something happening is much worse</p>
<p>Even if the worst-case scenario is nowhere near as bad as what would happen if you know</p>
<p>Superpowers lobbed missiles at each other with</p>
<p>Merved warheads on the you know, it&rsquo;s one of those things where you think okay</p>
<p>North Korea is a bigger nuclear thing to worry about then</p>
<p>Russia is because North Korea might use their weapons and Russia&rsquo;s pretty safe right now, but right now is the operative phrase</p>
<p>Things change on the dime</p>
<p>History doesn&rsquo;t teach lessons, right?</p>
<p>but it teaches that things change on a dime doesn&rsquo;t teach you when the next thing that will change on a dime is</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s plenty of examples that show the pattern, right?</p>
<p>You might be worried about this coronavirus today</p>
<p>two weeks of saber-rattling and a</p>
<p>Degeneration in world tensions and all of a sudden you&rsquo;re thinking about what we probably should have been thinking about the whole time</p>
<p>Given where it probably belongs in the triage level</p>
<p>the possibility</p>
<p>In fact that the fact that it&rsquo;s easier than you might think to have happen</p>
<p>Nuclear war not a nuclear bomb being used on a minor exchange from some third</p>
<p>World rogue state that doesn&rsquo;t know how to handle these things</p>
<p>but a true threat</p>
<p>from one country to another involving states that do know how to handle these things and</p>
<p>Have thought about what you would do if you needed to handle them for decades now</p>
<p>One of the best writers that you&rsquo;ll ever read</p>
<p>Talking about this question of thinking about how you would use or prevent the use of these weapons is a guy named Fred Kaplan</p>
<p>I should probably call him. Dr. Fred Kaplan&rsquo;s got a doctorate, but he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s an author who wrote a book called the Wizards of Armageddon</p>
<p>among others</p>
<p>We use that book as source material for our destroyer of worlds podcast</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fantastic stuff the people who had to try to get their mind around the mental challenge of human beings living with that kind</p>
<p>of weapons power</p>
<p>The whole thing is fascinating and then getting them together in groups to just I mean, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s interesting stuff</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just come out with a new book called the bomb</p>
<p>presidents generals and the secret history of nuclear war</p>
<p>so it takes like what we did or what he did in the earlier books or what we did in the</p>
<p>Destroyer of worlds and brings it up to modern times which in a really weird way makes it more chilling</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t just say wow things got really hot during the Cuban Missile Crisis</p>
<p>It must have been heavy right because</p>
<p>Kaplan&rsquo;s bringing you up to the way the situation kind of is currently and that doesn&rsquo;t just make it heavy</p>
<p>It makes it scary and real and current</p>
<p>These weapons have not only not gone away they&rsquo;ve become much more accurate much more deadly is a better way to put them</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t necessarily gotten any more intelligent about how to use them I</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Love the phrase and this is how we&rsquo;ll start the interview we did with Kaplan today</p>
<p>I love the phrase that was used as a blurb on his book</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>The blurbs are the comments on on the back or in the flaps and Chuck Klosterman gave me when I liked in my book</p>
<p>He called it. He called it an apocalyptic</p>
<p>Discotheque, which I thought was a really wonderful turn of phrase, but I love</p>
<p>somebody called Kaplan</p>
<p>The preeminent dr. Strangelove</p>
<p>Whisperer and</p>
<p>So I started by asking him that that&rsquo;s a heck of a nickname, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Or a heck of a blurb</p>
<p>Anyway, without further ado my conversation with Fred Kaplan author of the bomb presidents generals and the secret history of nuclear war</p>
<p>You can read Kaplan&rsquo;s regular column by the way war stories in slate. He&rsquo;s written for everyone. So</p>
<p>without further ado</p>
<p>Fred Kaplan</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>First thing is I have to tell you I absolutely think it is one of the best blurbs</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever read on the back of the book the one that calls you the world&rsquo;s preeminent. Dr. Strangelove whisperer</p>
<p>How do you feel about that? It&rsquo;s an interesting thing to be considered an expert on</p>
<p>Well, I I guess what he meant by that. This was from Tim Naftali. The the presidential historians is that</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Do</p>
<p>Get the kind of dr. Strangelove types nuclear strategists that sort of thing</p>
<p>to talk to me about stuff now one reason for this is that</p>
<p>Many years ago. I I studied in graduate school at MIT with William Kaufman who was one of them and</p>
<p>also with a couple of other people who were involved in nuclear policy in the</p>
<p>Late 50s to mid 60s George Rath Jones and Jack Rowena</p>
<p>So I could ask people questions sort of speaking their tongue. I understood how the analysis</p>
<p>Of you know, it&rsquo;s the exchange calculations as they were called were done</p>
<p>So, you know, I seem to be one of the tribe and they could open up to me better</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>So if we talk about a personality type certain kinds of personality types make good</p>
<p>Actors and actresses certain types of personality people make, you know</p>
<p>Titans of business if you had to sort of give us a short description of and obviously there&rsquo;s probably not one size fits all</p>
<p>But is there a type that&rsquo;s attracted to this sort of Wizards of Armageddon?</p>
<p>job description</p>
<p>Well, you know in the early days and we&rsquo;re talking about in the in the 1950s through the 19 early 60s</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I mean there really was a Cold War</p>
<p>I mean, you know, you know as well as anybody that this wasn&rsquo;t some</p>
<p>fabrication of</p>
<p>Paranoia, there was a real Cold War</p>
<p>People really thought there was a good chance that there was going to be a war between the United States and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>So if the kind of person who was say at the RAND Corporation back in those days for the Hudson Institute</p>
<p>Examining this first thought they were talking about they were dealing with a real thing and they saw it in their</p>
<p>powers and their mission to</p>
<p>enhance deterrence in other words to to do things that would maybe make sure that this war doesn&rsquo;t happen and</p>
<p>Then to limit damage and it did so they had a kind of a crusader</p>
<p>Image, but they were also</p>
<p>by and large</p>
<p>Economists social scientists</p>
<p>mathematicians, in other words, they saw that</p>
<p>That that the discipline in which they had been trained had some unique power to deal with this problem</p>
<p>Herman Kahn in his book on thermonuclear war</p>
<p>said that</p>
<p>What he was trying to do was to create a vocabulary in which these problems can be discussed</p>
<p>rationally, it was sort of a</p>
<p>religion of rationality that</p>
<p>Rationality defined as mathematical calculations can get us out of not just this problem</p>
<p>but you know for a while that the sort of</p>
<p>Elevation of systems analysis and things like that. There were people who thought this could solve all the problems of the world</p>
<p>I have to say the kind of person who does this</p>
<p>for a living now</p>
<p>After</p>
<p>you know the kind of</p>
<p>elevation</p>
<p>mystification of rationality has been</p>
<p>you know has crumbled in the face of all kinds of things from</p>
<p>the Vietnam War to the breakdown of all kinds of social</p>
<p>processes</p>
<p>I have a I have a little less</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you could if you could put it down to a type of what what kind of person</p>
<p>Gets in this at least in a very deep</p>
<p>deep way</p>
<p>Now unless they&rsquo;re a military officer</p>
<p>And it may be that there aren&rsquo;t people like this anymore</p>
<p>and as a result, maybe</p>
<p>These problems aren&rsquo;t dealt with rationally, but maybe they they could never be dealt with rationally</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s fascinating if you look at how much ink and time and effort what went in in the 1950s 1960s and into the</p>
<p>1970s towards exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about the almost Spock like</p>
<p>Analysis of the game itself and the various options and the rational, you know counter moves and all that sort of stuff</p>
<p>And to talk about I was struck by what you said that maybe there aren&rsquo;t those people today</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden it popped into my head that I don&rsquo;t hear those kinds of conversations today</p>
<p>Has this all been so internalized that we don&rsquo;t have to have maybe that that the first few decades were the discovery period and this</p>
<p>Stuff&rsquo;s all been absorbed or is this something that went out of fashion when the the seeming?</p>
<p>Inevitability or at least extreme likelihood of a general nuclear exchange went away</p>
<p>Well, I think I think for a while it was it was internalized</p>
<p>To the point where you know, I I conclude my first book was the wizards of armageddon</p>
<p>Which was awesome, by the way, we used it as a source. It was fantastic</p>
<p>Oh, thanks, but I mean it was about these people that that&rsquo;s mainly what it was about and and how they</p>
<p>How they had influence on policy</p>
<p>and I ended the book by noting that</p>
<p>This book came out in 1983 that the sort of second generation of these people, you know, the Cold War was still going on</p>
<p>They had so absorbed</p>
<p>The analytical framework of the of the founding fathers at Rand and so forth that</p>
<p>They they&rsquo;d come to think that it was it was</p>
<p>Real that it reflect a reality that that these these ideas had been hammered at home so often in books and treatises</p>
<p>It was also it was almost like the stone of dogma</p>
<p>Whereas, you know, I would you talk to the first generation people, you know</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll admit like hey, you know, we never knew whether this was</p>
<p>Real. In fact, we thought it was unlikely that you could limit a nuclear war or control how it would</p>
<p>Spin out, but if we if there was any chance that you could do it</p>
<p>At least we should try instead of blowing up the world all in one in one</p>
<p>stroke</p>
<p>Now though at least until a couple years ago for about the previous 30 years</p>
<p>Nobody was thinking about nuclear war nuclear weapons at all. The Cold War was over. You know, we were all on a holiday from history</p>
<p>Quite the contrary to it being internalized if I think all of these</p>
<p>Ideas have been at least among the broad</p>
<p>educated</p>
<p>public interested in international relations, let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>Forgotten and one reason I wrote that this new book the bomb</p>
<p>is big precisely because of that when when</p>
<p>Donald Trump came out of his</p>
<p>You know golf clubhouse in Edmonston, New Jersey on August 8th</p>
<p>2017 and said that if I have North Korea keeps making threatening noises and testing nukes and missiles</p>
<p>he will rain fire and fury on North Korea like the earth has never seen and</p>
<p>You know that was kind of a provocative first of the rhetoric alone</p>
<p>But second he wasn&rsquo;t saying that if they attack us will rain fire and fury</p>
<p>but just if they</p>
<p>Developed the capability to attack us</p>
<p>he would do that and that got people all kind of got people very worried and</p>
<p>Nervous about the possible prospect of nuclear war for the first time in</p>
<p>Decades but this nervousness took form in the shape of a kind of vague anxiety because</p>
<p>people had forgotten all of the discussion about</p>
<p>Nuclear strategy and so forth if they ever knew it. And so I thought well, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s time maybe to</p>
<p>To take another look at the history of this thing. I have a persistent devil&rsquo;s advocate side in me</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a part of me that thinks</p>
<p>that the</p>
<p>Awakening to how dangerous it is perhaps to have a single individual in charge of the the world&rsquo;s most powerful arsenal ever</p>
<p>I I think people maybe were a little complacent because they felt like the person in power would never violate whatever that we can trust</p>
<p>You know this individual to act responsibly</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you had to get somebody that shattered that sense of trust to maybe give the right amount of attention to a command</p>
<p>And control problem that if you look at the Constitution seems ridiculous, right?</p>
<p>You put the power to launch a war into one person&rsquo;s hands alone</p>
<p>And we can talk about you know</p>
<p>The actual restrictions that might be on a person in a second</p>
<p>But but I mean it seems like that and I always look at it as a technological question, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have time for Congress to deliberate and everything when the missiles are in the air</p>
<p>But I mean it seems like maybe if there was an upside to this whole thing</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that people are examining this obvious hole in our whole, you know</p>
<p>Defense strategy and constitutional design now in a way that they weren&rsquo;t when we had the Obama presidency or the Bush presidency or the Reagan</p>
<p>Presidency, does that ring true?</p>
<p>You could take this all the way back. Yeah, I think it is true. I think one thing that Trump has done is to</p>
<p>sort of</p>
<p>slap this awake</p>
<p>To the reality that hey, you know, maybe we&rsquo;d forgotten</p>
<p>but these these thousands of nuclear weapons are still here and always have been here and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole machinery a whole apparatus that is planning how to use them in various contingencies and</p>
<p>Keeping them maintained, you know, the the new defense budget that Trump just put out has twenty nine billion dollars</p>
<p>Devoted to nuclear weapons and the things that carry them</p>
<p>That was about a 17% increase over the previous year. So yeah, these things are still here now</p>
<p>What people will do about it, I don&rsquo;t know there there is a</p>
<p>there was a hearing in 2017 around the same time as</p>
<p>fire and fury</p>
<p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee</p>
<p>The Republican chairman at the time Bob Corker suddenly realized I mean you&rsquo;d think that someone in that position would have known this already</p>
<p>but kind of suddenly realized that</p>
<p>The president has the sole power to blow up the world if he wants to there&rsquo;s nothing anybody can do about it</p>
<p>and so he held a hearing and it was the</p>
<p>First hearing that Congress had held on this subject since the mid 70s</p>
<p>That tells you something right there. It was an open hearing wasn&rsquo;t reported on much. I watched it on C-SPAN 3</p>
<p>it was live and</p>
<p>It was the notion the premise of the hearing was confirmed that yeah, yeah the president</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the human factor is the deciding element now</p>
<p>Did Congress do anything about this?</p>
<p>No, and the issue is brought up. You&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s one thing if the missiles are coming and you&rsquo;ve got 20 minutes warning</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have time to</p>
<p>You know call hearings or assemble the group of eight in Congress to discuss this</p>
<p>But they were talking about well</p>
<p>What if the president is contemplating a first strike and even if not even so much a preemptive strike?</p>
<p>But a preventive strike say against North Korea if they&rsquo;re starting to test</p>
<p>ICBMs and nuclear weapons</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a legitimate question, I think you do have time</p>
<p>Do you want it all to rest in the power of one person?</p>
<p>But nothing was done that there was a moment in the hearing where a Democratic senator</p>
<p>said look, let&rsquo;s cut the</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s cut the politeness out of this. We&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re holding this hearing because the president is erratic</p>
<p>He has poor judgment and he might get us into a war and the remarkable thing</p>
<p>Is that no Republican senator on the panel disagreed with this?</p>
<p>you know didn&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s outrageous or anything like that and</p>
<p>That one of the people testifying was a retired general named Bob Taylor</p>
<p>He had recently been the commander of strategic command and he came away from the hearing very distressed because</p>
<p>To his mind. Hey if Congress wants to change the rules about launch authority</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine that that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s their right to do but</p>
<p>What he was really upset about was that they shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Publicly raise doubts</p>
<p>about the reliability or</p>
<p>legitimacy of the chain of command and then do nothing about it and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what they had done in this hearing</p>
<p>I want to I want to talk a little bit about something you just mentioned the human factor and get into that a second because</p>
<p>As you explained it and I&rsquo;ve heard this elsewhere, too</p>
<p>That this is if you say to the to the military higher-ups or the people involved in the in in the decision-making here</p>
<p>Does the president have the power to start a nuclear war all by themselves?</p>
<p>They will often say no as you pointed out because they&rsquo;re not supposed to follow illegal orders or irrational orders or all that</p>
<p>But at the same time when when when in the hearings you just mentioned they dialed down and got granular on that question</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they answered kind of that, you know, it&rsquo;s sort of the human question</p>
<p>In other words somebody at some chain of command has to say no</p>
<p>And the likelihood may be of that happening in certain situations</p>
<p>I mean you mentioned in your book people that were transferred and fired</p>
<p>Simply for asking questions about how they would know if the launch orders they received were legitimate, right?</p>
<p>That was enough to get somebody. So do we have a cyst? Do we have a system that is encouraging the human factor?</p>
<p>No, in fact quite the contrary</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. I mean the military military officers and enlisted personnel as well are trained that they should not</p>
<p>They should not obey that they have an obligation to obey legal orders</p>
<p>Which suggests that they should not obey illegal orders, but what is an illegal order, you know?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book, you know</p>
<p>The football the thing that the guy carries around in a case next to the president all the time</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a button and it&rsquo;s not a palm print that the president lays his fingerprints in</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a book and it has codes in it and the codes refer to options to attack options and</p>
<p>If an attack option is in that book</p>
<p>that means that</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>Military lawyers have already deemed that it is legal</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s all kinds of other</p>
<p>Circumstances. Well, you know under what circumstances?</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>You know who is to determine that way who is though is a one-star general the person to determine whether something is legal or not</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s generally not what he&rsquo;s trained for and then here&rsquo;s how the chain of command works</p>
<p>President gets warning of something going on or just gets it in his head. He wants to attack. There is assembled a conference call</p>
<p>involving some cabinet people some</p>
<p>Four-star generals if they can be found and gathered and there&rsquo;s a consultation</p>
<p>But ultimately it&rsquo;s up to the president. In fact, the chain of command does not go through the people that he&rsquo;s consulted</p>
<p>He sends a guy carrying around the football</p>
<p>President somehow authenticates who he is the order goes to a one-star general in the National Military Command Center</p>
<p>Which is located in the basement of the Pentagon and that person sends the order to the submarines the missile ears</p>
<p>Bombers and that&rsquo;s it. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the strategic command commander the Secretary of Defense</p>
<p>They are not in that actual chain of command</p>
<p>There was an incident in the 70s there was a</p>
<p>An Air Force officer named he was a major Harold Herring</p>
<p>He was a Minuteman here in late 73. He was training to be a Minuteman launch officer</p>
<p>He had been a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and so forth and in the training center. He asked</p>
<p>He asked his instructors. How can I know that in order I received to launch my missiles came from a sane president and</p>
<p>What checks and balances exist to verify that an unlawful order does not get into the missile man. Now, these are</p>
<p>Crucial and you would think</p>
<p>You would you would want you would wanted an officer who asks these kinds of questions, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s asking, you know, what what can I do it to assure that I&rsquo;m not abetting a serious war crime, right?</p>
<p>Well, he was basically</p>
<p>taken out of the missile man instruct miss minute man instructor class and</p>
<p>Put before a panel and they drummed him out of the Air Force</p>
<p>So, you know, this is they the people who are</p>
<p>in places like the National Military Command Center and the people holding the football and</p>
<p>the people supposedly down in the</p>
<p>Missile holes and so forth the missile silos. They are selected in part on their perceived</p>
<p>inclination to salute and follow orders</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk I&rsquo;m gonna shift gears a little bit because that is so disturbing but but</p>
<p>But you use a word that&rsquo;s and and this is so as a civilian</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re an 18 year old kid and and listening to this interview. That&rsquo;s the first you&rsquo;ve heard of this, right?</p>
<p>It reminds me of and you use the description several times the the the reaction to new</p>
<p>Presidents when they get that first big briefing on what the nuclear war plan is and you used I I wrote it down several times</p>
<p>You used the word the president came out appalled over and over and over again</p>
<p>These are intelligent people who ran for office who were briefed all through their debates and all through the process</p>
<p>Some of them had political experience up to very high levels before they were elected. How can almost all these people be so</p>
<p>Changed when they come out of these meetings</p>
<p>How could they know so little going in theoretically versus the reality after they get the the behind-the-scenes briefing?</p>
<p>Well, because it isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s generally discussed or at least not on this level</p>
<p>I mean the president gets a briefing on what&rsquo;s called the psyop. That&rsquo;s not a new president coming in</p>
<p>Yeah, a new president coming in single integrated operational plan. It&rsquo;s one of the first things like, okay</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the guy who might have to decide whether to go to nuclear war let&rsquo;s take you through what this involves and</p>
<p>They just have no idea of how</p>
<p>Well, I mean it&rsquo;s changed over time</p>
<p>But let me let me tell you what the first psyop said the one that that Kennedy was briefed on there the first psyop</p>
<p>Where they actually integrated all of the nuclear weapons into one plan</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>1960 and this was the plan the plan and it was the only plan was that</p>
<p>if the Soviet Union invaded Western Europe or grabbed</p>
<p>West Berlin and you know, it wasn&rsquo;t something for which we had enough</p>
<p>conventional forces to</p>
<p>push back the invasion</p>
<p>the plan the only plan</p>
<p>Was to unleash the entire US nuclear arsenal against every target in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>the satellite nations of Eastern Europe and</p>
<p>communist China even if China hadn&rsquo;t been involved directly in the war and</p>
<p>It was estimated that this would kill about two hundred and eighty five million people in</p>
<p>1960</p>
<p>1960 Kennedy and Eisenhower as well also received every year a briefing</p>
<p>This was there was something called the the</p>
<p>Net evaluation subcommittee. It was a very secretive</p>
<p>Office inside the National Security Council. It&rsquo;s very existence was classified</p>
<p>they would take the data on how many weapons we had how many weapons it was believed the Soviet Union had and</p>
<p>they would run a computer-generated war game and then look at the consequences and</p>
<p>There was a briefing of just, you know, maybe a dozen people and it was just appalling it was you know</p>
<p>Tens of millions of people killed hunt tens of millions more injured</p>
<p>in need of</p>
<p>hospital care for which there were no hospitals the government completely breaking down the economy a wreck and</p>
<p>When Kennedy received this briefing he turned to Dean Rusk</p>
<p>The Secretary of State who was sitting next to him and said and we call ourselves the human race</p>
<p>Now when Eisenhower first heard this briefing he was in this is, you know, five-star general Sakhir, you know</p>
<p>World War two hero. He wrote in his diary how</p>
<p>Disturbed he was he said I guess maybe the only option is to launch a preemptive first strike before this happens</p>
<p>But that would go against our values and Congress would never stand for it, which is kind of an interesting</p>
<p>take and then he said this only makes me more determined to keep the threshold to</p>
<p>To keep deterrence firm and Eisenhower his view was okay. We don&rsquo;t have conventional forces</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to put out he put out a</p>
<p>policy called massive retaliation which said you you make one move on a</p>
<p>into our</p>
<p>vital interests</p>
<p>We will blow you to smithereens. That was the way to deter them. That&rsquo;s what he thought</p>
<p>And by this wasn&rsquo;t just you know, Curtis LeMay and strategic air command</p>
<p>This was general Eisenhower the Joint Chiefs of Staff signed a document saying that</p>
<p>Armed conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union will go nuclear at the first opportunity</p>
<p>Regardless how the war was initiated I</p>
<p>want to I want to expand on that a little bit because I</p>
<p>Know more than the average bear on this and you you still had a ton of things in the book that I&rsquo;d either never heard</p>
<p>Or never saw integrated into the story</p>
<p>well, and and one of the things that you did a really good job and I&rsquo;ve been meditating on it sort of ever since is</p>
<p>the disconnect between</p>
<p>military leadership and political leadership</p>
<p>I mean I I had never heard the the Kissinger line that you used that he had said because because this this seems to strike</p>
<p>Against all the public released information about the president regardless of which presidents desire to maintain deterrence</p>
<p>Especially in the 60s and 70s where he said that Nixon would not push the button basically that he would not kill 80 million people</p>
<p>I actually quoted he said said in a remarkable statement your words that that that he meaning Nixon won&rsquo;t push the button</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t use nuclear weapons in a crisis and that to only have the option of killing 80 million people is the height of immorality</p>
<p>Oh, yeah</p>
<p>I found that fascinating when you juxtaposition that sentiment the civilian leadership sentiment with the</p>
<p>Curtis LeMay strategic air command</p>
<p>Siam sentiment. Well, you know, it&rsquo;s interesting because</p>
<p>This is an I&rsquo;m going to now reveal the one thing that I got wrong in the Wizards of Armageddon</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Had which again was written 37 years ago</p>
<p>I had in that book that when Kennedy came in and his secretary of defense Robert McNamara</p>
<p>Reformed the psyop and put in all kinds of limited options so that the first step would not be</p>
<p>total</p>
<p>Catastrophic destruction of everything, you know, he put little, you know, we would restrain</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t attack these kinds of targets in the first instance</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d only attack those strategic forces not the cities. It was very elaborate very detailed very sophisticated</p>
<p>what I learned in</p>
<p>researching my new book is</p>
<p>Because what when I when I did that first book I learned about</p>
<p>McNamara&rsquo;s reforms only by interviewing people who were involved in it. There was</p>
<p>No documents on the subject declassified yet at that point</p>
<p>what I learned in the new book is that</p>
<p>The Strategic Air Command just ignored these directives</p>
<p>I mean not not totally what they would do</p>
<p>they they would they would get the joint the joint staff to put little caveats like to the extent feasible or</p>
<p>If it is consistent with military objectives, we will do these limited options as they were called and</p>
<p>Then of course they were determined they knew that if war actually come</p>
<p>They would</p>
<p>Determine that it wasn&rsquo;t feasible and it wasn&rsquo;t consistent with with military objectives</p>
<p>So by the time Nixon becomes president and he and Kissinger get their psyop briefing and you know Kissinger has been writing about this</p>
<p>Since the mid 50s and he thinks that and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;d been following</p>
<p>Because he had been a consultant in the Kennedy administration</p>
<p>He knew about these options that that McNamara was putting forth as directives to sack</p>
<p>He he was stunned that that none of it had had the slightest impact and</p>
<p>Yeah, Nixon once gave a public speech where he talked about the need to develop some options that would not leave us the choice</p>
<p>of surrender or suicide in the event of a war like this, so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what he was talking about and the the line that you quoted work where</p>
<p>Kissinger says I think Nixon just won&rsquo;t push the button if the only</p>
<p>Outcome is 85 million people killed that was in a</p>
<p>behind doors</p>
<p>meeting of the National Security Council of his advisers it was</p>
<p>You know, I got that from a top-secret</p>
<p>Notetakers account of the meeting which had recently been declassified because that would destroy deterrence if something like that ever got out</p>
<p>Yeah, I might if you&rsquo;re saying if the whole idea is to convince the other side that</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re going to you&rsquo;re you really are gonna do this the other side thinks that you won&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>Well, maybe it&rsquo;s maybe he&rsquo;ll get aggressive</p>
<p>I was I was interested in sort of the polarities and if you&rsquo;ll pardon that the the analogy the triad of interests here</p>
<p>That develops after the the bomb is first discovered. I mean you could talk about the the Bertrand Russell</p>
<p>Sometimes Robert Oppenheimer. We need to rid the world of past behaviors because they&rsquo;ll destroy us the middle ground</p>
<p>Which is maybe the von Neumann&rsquo;s and the Hermann Kahn&rsquo;s and these people who try to figure out how to use our rationality to live</p>
<p>With a tough situation, but then on the far side is the military and you could say not just in our country</p>
<p>But also the establishment in the Soviet Union. I was I found it interesting when you were talking about</p>
<p>Kissinger had talked about how and this is what you just talked about how</p>
<p>Unresponsive to presidential direction</p>
<p>The military was and you don&rsquo;t just point out that they found wonderful little lawyer like wiggle words in the in the specifics in the small</p>
<p>Print but also they had because I was trying to figure out in a democratic system how they worked this and you were very clear</p>
<p>About how they would have allies in Congress and in the Senate, you know in the house and in the Senate</p>
<p>I controlled important committees on defense and expenditures and whatnot and they could sort of undermine a</p>
<p>President that they didn&rsquo;t like or or anyone that was soft on security or what-have-you through their allies in the</p>
<p>Legislative branch is that kind of how the military was able to in a free society where the president supposed to to hold the cards</p>
<p>And all this is that how they kind of</p>
<p>Counterbalanced his power</p>
<p>Well to some degree, I mean, you know, the military is also evolved over this time. I mean</p>
<p>The 50s and the 60s strategic air command was was basically</p>
<p>Dominated by people who had been strategic bombardiers second world</p>
<p>yeah, and then you came up in the culture of</p>
<p>Of Curtis LeMay, you know, there was the first</p>
<p>Effective commander of sack and you know Curtis LeMay had fire</p>
<p>But he had been in the head of the 21st bomber command in World War two</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been in charge of firebombing Japan and in the spring of</p>
<p>1945</p>
<p>General Hap Arnold who was the commander of Army Air Forces came to him and said when will the war be over that Nazis had?</p>
<p>Already surrendered the Japanese were still fighting</p>
<p>LeMay took the problem to his staff. They did the math</p>
<p>They you know, how much how many how much territory has been destroyed so far how much more territory there is to go?</p>
<p>How many bombs that&rsquo;ll take how long it&rsquo;ll take the bombers to get there and he came back and said the war will be over</p>
<p>September 1st because that will be the time by which we will have bombed every square mile in Japan</p>
<p>So that was his idea of war it&rsquo;s bomb</p>
<p>Everything and when the atom bomb and then the hydrogen bomb came along this became more appealing still so the notion the very notion</p>
<p>having this</p>
<p>incredible weapon that you would want to</p>
<p>Employ strategies involving restraint or using them in some limited way</p>
<p>struck guys like LeMay and</p>
<p>His successor at SAC whose name was General Tommy Power who had been LeMay&rsquo;s deputy</p>
<p>But whom LeMay once referred to as a sadist</p>
<p>This notion is this notion of restraint struck them as perverse</p>
<p>Why would you want to restrain yourself?</p>
<p>I mean in this incredible moment, there was a my professor old professor at MIT who?</p>
<p>Bill Kaufman who had come up with some of these ideas of restraint and counterforce and so forth was giving Tommy Power</p>
<p>Briefing on this and Tommy Power pounded his fist on the table and said why are you talking about restraint?</p>
<p>Look at the end of the war</p>
<p>there are two Americans and one Russian then that means we won and Kaufman said well, you better make sure it&rsquo;s a man and a</p>
<p>woman and</p>
<p>Power stormed out now power was an exception. Not everybody was like that, but they did have this bomb everything mentality as time went on</p>
<p>the military evolved the LeMay types died out more people came into the command who had had experience as</p>
<p>tactical fighter pilots or as tactical bombers, in other words looking at at</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>military use</p>
<p>Military function is to go after discrete targets as you would in a military campaign in a conventional military campaign</p>
<p>so things did</p>
<p>Loosen up a little bit but still there was this</p>
<p>you know sack is out in Omaha and and</p>
<p>LeMay and his successors</p>
<p>Exploited that fact. Yeah, they were isolated from Washington</p>
<p>but that also allowed them to do their own thing away from the peering eyes of Washington and much of what they did was</p>
<p>incredibly technical and based on very very highly classified stuff and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>they were allowed to get away with with an incredible amount of</p>
<p>excess and</p>
<p>And really almost perverse thinking about strategy</p>
<p>I was shocked and you know, again, I know quite a lot about this</p>
<p>But it is interesting how much of the way the whole nuclear apparatus developed could be</p>
<p>I mean you might be able to make a case that one of the key reasons for it is inter-service rivalry and</p>
<p>And and jealousy over military budgets</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard a better argument in my life for that age-old question about whether or not there&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>Duplication and redundancy by having multiple service branches. I want to use your your your knowledge of this for a second</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about the way things were but I always think that when somebody spent as much time on a subject as you have</p>
<p>On this I&rsquo;d like to get your own personal insights if you don&rsquo;t mind for a second</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>For example, we talked earlier about the command-and-control problem that this this dicey issue of what if the situation we have now is insane</p>
<p>What makes more sense and is something that would work as opposed to you?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t say let&rsquo;s deliberate for two weeks</p>
<p>But but in your mind have you heard talking to all these people any any reforms that would make sense in this area and that were</p>
<p>workable</p>
<p>Well, you mean about sole presidential</p>
<p>Way to diversify the decision-making on something as big as that</p>
<p>Well, I would I well, you know, there have a few times been amendments</p>
<p>William Proxmire offered amendment in the 70s</p>
<p>Edward Markey did at this most recent hearing which</p>
<p>basically said that for</p>
<p>First strikes that do not involve, you know a response to an imminent threat</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know either</p>
<p>Congress gets a vote or the cabinet has to be consulted or this sort of eight</p>
<p>People in Congress that you consult about covert operations have to be consulted</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Think that&rsquo;s imminently feasible. You know, the president is not facing. Hey, I&rsquo;ve only got an hour to make this decision</p>
<p>Why</p>
<p>To to to get that kind of power</p>
<p>I think also</p>
<p>Listen, I believe it or not. Look that there there is a system where again eight eight members of Congress are</p>
<p>Led in on on really every covert operation</p>
<p>But then the people and they call it the select committee on house intelligence and the select committee on</p>
<p>Senate intelligence they are</p>
<p>informed about all covert operations that the intelligence agencies do and there&rsquo;s never been a leak out of these committees you have to</p>
<p>Agree to certain things even to beyond these committees</p>
<p>There is no such committee</p>
<p>Dealing with nuclear war planning the armed services committees of the House and Senate</p>
<p>They get into it in a very cursory way. They don&rsquo;t get nobody is shown</p>
<p>Not even the Secretary of Defense he gets a briefing on the vague outlines</p>
<p>Nobody has shown the targeting is I have this one chapter in my book and maybe this is what you&rsquo;re getting to</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not it might be a good time to bring it up</p>
<p>There was no civilian interference in this and no real limited options</p>
<p>It was the nuclear war plan remained, you know blow up everything</p>
<p>Really all the way until almost the end of the Cold War in the late</p>
<p>1980s and there were there was a civilian a civil servant in fact in the Pentagon named Frank Miller and</p>
<p>this was when</p>
<p>first Carlucci and then Dick Cheney of all people was Secretary of Defense and</p>
<p>Before he got this job Frank who had been working in the State Department</p>
<p>Immersed himself in all of these documents that McNamara&rsquo;s and McNamara&rsquo;s successors had written over the decades calling for</p>
<p>restraint and limited options and the guidance that they sent to</p>
<p>The to sack and so forth and then he sits in on the psyop briefing</p>
<p>to the Secretary of Defense and</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t hear anything about this doesn&rsquo;t hear anything about</p>
<p>Limit options restraint or anything and he says what&rsquo;s going on here and Cheney</p>
<p>Basically gave him</p>
<p>Authority to go make a deep investigation of the war plan and told ordered people exact to let him and his staff</p>
<p>see everything in the books and</p>
<p>They discovered some amazing things. So the level of overkill</p>
<p>Was just staggering now that we&rsquo;re talking about 1989 here</p>
<p>The 50 might there were 700 nuclear weapons aimed at a 50-mile radius around Moscow</p>
<p>There was an air base in the Arctic Circle. It was it was a secondary air base</p>
<p>It was an air base that Russian bombers would land on on their way back</p>
<p>From having nuked the United States and it was so cold. It couldn&rsquo;t be used for most of the year</p>
<p>There were 17 nuclear weapons aimed at this base</p>
<p>There was an anti-ballistic missile site in Moscow that we learned later</p>
<p>Really didn&rsquo;t work at all</p>
<p>There were 69 weapons aimed at this missile site. I went out there also the way</p>
<p>Target sets for time. For example, one target set was destroyed the Russian tank army</p>
<p>Okay. Well what they did it wasn&rsquo;t even just destroying just the tanks</p>
<p>They also destroyed the factory that made the tanks the factory that made spare parts for the tanks the factory that made</p>
<p>It rolled the steel to make the tanks the mines. Well, I mean, you know went on and on like that</p>
<p>it was just incredibly redundant and</p>
<p>Then here came the kicker here came the the thing that blew the whole system apart</p>
<p>At this point George HW Bush was negotiating a strategic arms deal with Russia</p>
<p>Negotiating a strategic arms treaty with the Russians and one of Frank&rsquo;s staffers</p>
<p>a guy named Gil Klinger</p>
<p>Asked his contact at the joint strategic target planning staff, which was the division of sacrament actually did the mechanical</p>
<p>Targeting of a war plan. He said, you know</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thinking of lowering number of nuclear weapons to such-and-such</p>
<p>Would you still be able to perform your mission with so few weapons and</p>
<p>The guy said well, no that that&rsquo;s not how we think about this because well what I mean, you know</p>
<p>No, I understand what you mean</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what we do what we do we take the number of weapons that are given to us and</p>
<p>We apply them to the targets that are on our lists</p>
<p>Now the implications of this are insane it means</p>
<p>that at no point</p>
<p>Had anybody in the operational side of this?</p>
<p>Asked well, how many weapons do we really need to perform?</p>
<p>Whatever mission it is. They want to perform. No, it was there was a there was a sack commander named Jack chain who won</p>
<p>hearing</p>
<p>in the 90s, I</p>
<p>Guess it was a late 80s</p>
<p>said I need 10,000 weapons because I have 10,000 targets and</p>
<p>People thought he was either joking or or maybe he wasn&rsquo;t very bright. But no that is exactly how it worked</p>
<p>It was it was a completely out of control</p>
<p>process with no</p>
<p>with no reference to policy or aims or</p>
<p>proportionality and this is what happens when you let</p>
<p>a very powerful</p>
<p>highly highly specialized</p>
<p>bureaucracy</p>
<p>Go completely rogue go completely independent with no oversight even from the people who are actually setting the policies</p>
<p>that this bureaucracy is was set up to</p>
<p>Implement now, we&rsquo;ve been talking about high-minded stuff and policy and all these kinds of things which is fascinating</p>
<p>But I think we we should not lose track of what you point out in the book over and over and what is the key?</p>
<p>Issue here and it&rsquo;s bodies on the ground right Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s. I dream of London in ruins with corpses everywhere</p>
<p>You know, I was wondering about</p>
<p>Humankind&rsquo;s ability to stay on a knife&rsquo;s edge of concern and alert generation after generation</p>
<p>I think maybe after thinking about this that it might almost be an evolutionary</p>
<p>Help that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>continually worry about nuclear weapons to the same degree that we did in like</p>
<p>1955 and yet if we don&rsquo;t do we risk</p>
<p>presidential campaigns where we&rsquo;re talking about minutia and small little</p>
<p>opinion things or or or or optics things that don&rsquo;t matter at the expense of talking about some of the very important things we</p>
<p>We talked about here. How can you keep something this important and this almost impossible in your mind to imagine thing?</p>
<p>How can you keep this at the height of the triage alert level?</p>
<p>indefinitely</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you&rsquo;re right. I don&rsquo;t think like you and I are sitting here</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m 65 years old. I&rsquo;m 50. Maybe I&rsquo;m okay. Well, maybe I&rsquo;ve got another 15 years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I don&rsquo;t think about this every day. Maybe I should you know, there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of things that that</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>That we don&rsquo;t think about I mean much of much of what we do in life is kind of an evasion</p>
<p>I mean and this of course what we&rsquo;re talking about nuclear war is a is a super evasion</p>
<p>But you know that there&rsquo;s this does lead to one thing that that you mentioned a little earlier about</p>
<p>Presidents versus the generals now the subtitle of this book is</p>
<p>presidents</p>
<p>Generals and the secret history of nuclear war and one thing that I found consistent</p>
<p>Leading up to the current president who has nothing hasn&rsquo;t yet been tested on this</p>
<p>But about him one can make some inferences is that a lot of these presidents more than we realize</p>
<p>Faced crises in which the use of nuclear weapons was seriously contemplated and the records show</p>
<p>That they immersed themselves very deeply in the logic in the strategy in the</p>
<p>scenarios and in the</p>
<p>Consequences and they were led through this by briefers who spoke of it in very calm and rational terms</p>
<p>in some cases</p>
<p>advocating</p>
<p>certain kinds of uses of nuclear weapons and in every case</p>
<p>When the president got to the bottom of this rabbit hole</p>
<p>He realized no, I am not going to go there</p>
<p>The consequences are just too catastrophic and they figured out some way to scramble out of the rabbit hole and to settle this crisis</p>
<p>through some diplomatic solution</p>
<p>And you know you can ask</p>
<p>Why is it I think if you had gone back to</p>
<p>1947 say and ask somebody there</p>
<p>What do you think the chances are that we&rsquo;ll get to the year 2020 and never use these nuclear weapons again?</p>
<p>Nobody uses them. I I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d find very many people</p>
<p>Who would think that was a possibility?</p>
<p>I I think you&rsquo;d be seen as a as a naive or or an excessive optimist if you said yeah</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s possible and yet we&rsquo;ve done it. We&rsquo;ve done it. So why is that? Well, I think it&rsquo;s three things</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s three things</p>
<p>One thing I think, you know nuclear deterrence. I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s a powerful thing</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a lifetime guarantee, but the idea that if you</p>
<p>Start messing around that the other person will strike back and destroy you</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a restraining influence</p>
<p>the second part is that as I&rsquo;ve discovered in this book, we&rsquo;ve had the law we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>blessed with</p>
<p>Leaders who in a pinch turn out to be</p>
<p>Fairly shrewd and rational at least when it comes to this sort of thing</p>
<p>And three we&rsquo;ve had good luck. I mean</p>
<p>there have been lots of accounts of you know incidents in which</p>
<p>You know a flock of geese just somebody looks out on a radar screen</p>
<p>that looks like missiles coming their way or a software error that that makes it look like that missiles are coming our way and</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>somebody in the middle level of the command who decides</p>
<p>This probably isn&rsquo;t real</p>
<p>And doesn&rsquo;t and does nothing about it</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve had it&rsquo;s a combination of</p>
<p>deterrence</p>
<p>shrewd leaders</p>
<p>And good luck, but what happens?</p>
<p>if we have a situation where</p>
<p>We have slow-witted lure slow-witted leaders</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>a spate of bad luck</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a combination that you know, the dice are gonna come up that way at some point</p>
<p>uh, even if they haven&rsquo;t just yet and and then what happens that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sort of frightening thing</p>
<p>Uh and not to change the subject but to leave it on a note that I found</p>
<p>Another fascinating thing and like I said, I know quite a bit about this and you threw things out there where I was like</p>
<p>Wow, I didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t know that or I didn&rsquo;t realize that or I didn&rsquo;t internalize that</p>
<p>Um, I was fascinated by how the different presidents sort of dealt with this issue</p>
<p>In a way that sort of matched their personality</p>
<p>so watching an eisenhower try to figure out how to deal with this versus a kennedy and then when you got to</p>
<p>to reagan</p>
<p>I found that so interesting because instead of doing it at like an eisenhower level</p>
<p>Or a kennedy level where he was looking at the giant dr</p>
<p>Strange love and and and uh and and von neumann side of this he took it down to a human level</p>
<p>I love that story where um where and i&rsquo;m gonna let you tell it because you&rsquo;ll tell it better</p>
<p>But where where reagan and gorbachev right when they&rsquo;re at this, you know</p>
<p>They had been at a knife&rsquo;s edge with and drop off and brezhnev</p>
<p>And uh and sure and and and the various leadership that was dying left and right then you get this transformative first person</p>
<p>Gorbachev in an environment where everybody uh distrusts one another and reagan the ultimate coal warrior, you know</p>
<p>We start bombing in five minutes that guy</p>
<p>Sends everybody else away and with just the translators gets gorbachev on a couch</p>
<p>And and brings it down to a level far below the the rand institute level and just gets it to a real human thing</p>
<p>Can you tell the story about the aliens?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know reagan, you know, I was a reporter. I was covering reagan and</p>
<p>And he turns out to be a more complicated</p>
<p>Figure than than I thought for one thing. He was kind of a secret nuclear abolitionist</p>
<p>A lot of his staff tried to keep this from everybody</p>
<p>But this was why he was in favor of star wars strategic defense initiative</p>
<p>He might have been one of two or three people who really thought that&rsquo;s what that program was about which was</p>
<p>To kind of erect a shield that would keep all nuclear weapons out rendering them impotent or obsolete first term</p>
<p>It comes in</p>
<p>boosts the budget</p>
<p>Does makes all kinds of provocative statements about the soviet union?</p>
<p>The nsa and cia are doing incredibly provocative things</p>
<p>And then reagan realizes that the soviets believe that we&rsquo;re setting up to launch a first strike and he says, oh</p>
<p>God, we have to start dialing this back and he he reaches out to a soviet leader</p>
<p>As you say a couple of them died then he goes to meet with gorbachev. This is in 1985</p>
<p>in geneva</p>
<p>And their their first round of talks. Uh, it&rsquo;s kind of tense. And so they go for a walk along</p>
<p>The lake and they duck into a cabin where a fire is roaring and it&rsquo;s just them and their trans and their translators and notetakers</p>
<p>reagan leans in and says</p>
<p>If the united states were were attacked</p>
<p>By aliens from outer space would russia come to our defense?</p>
<p>and gorbachev says absolutely and reagan says</p>
<p>I feel the same way about you. And so when they came back to the conference room</p>
<p>Secretary of state george schultz</p>
<p>Who had no inkling of this conversation until much much later?</p>
<p>Wrote in in his account of this that all of a sudden the atmosphere had changed</p>
<p>Completely these two guys were laughing and joking like they were old friends</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what led to the sort of pivot away from cold war to the end of the cold war and</p>
<p>This was something real to reagan a couple years later. Reagan wrote a speech to the un general assembly</p>
<p>uh and</p>
<p>Colin powell tried to excise this line that i&rsquo;m about to recite a couple of times</p>
<p>And reagan kept adding it back in and it was this he said</p>
<p>if we were</p>
<p>attacked by aliens from outer space</p>
<p>The quarrels and disputes between us here on earth</p>
<p>Would seem trivial by comparison now on the one hand. This is kind of nutty, right?</p>
<p>But on the other hand, hey, you know, he has a point and and maybe when you&rsquo;re dealing with with a subject that is</p>
<p>Cataclysmically catastrophic</p>
<p>Uh, maybe a view from a billion miles up is is is not a bad way to go</p>
<p>Holy cow, is that the best ending I could ever think of for an interview?</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t why don&rsquo;t we call it quits here?</p>
<p>Unless there was something that I left out that you really want to include please bring that up</p>
<p>You know, I mean there are there is you know, if you if you want to talk about and insert</p>
<p>you know things about the cuban missile crisis or the berlin crisis or but but whatever, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>You certainly asked a lot of questions that nobody&rsquo;s ever asked before</p>
<p>My thanks to fred kaplan for coming on the program</p>
<p>The book is called the bomb presidents generals and the secret history of nuclear war available right now</p>
<p>You can also check out his column his regular column war stories in slate magazine</p>
<p>And my goodness if you&rsquo;re into this stuff</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fascinating book about trying to figure out the most logical ways for human beings to live with the</p>
<p>Ever-increasing power of their weapon systems check out fred kaplan&rsquo;s earlier work the wizards of armageddon fascinating stuff</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>We appreciate him coming on the show. Hope you enjoyed it</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>Have you seen 1917 yet in the theater</p>
<p>The reason I ask is because it&rsquo;s one of those films</p>
<p>uh that if you are a fan of filmmaking</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t take your eyes off the way they did it from a cinematographer standpoint. I mean, there&rsquo;s a reason</p>
<p>People oohed and awed about it when they saw it and it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the sort of things that speak to yours truly</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go to a first world war film</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s done like this because there there haven&rsquo;t been many of them. We&rsquo;ve talked about that in the past</p>
<p>So i&rsquo;m already hooked before you even show me how you shot it</p>
<p>But then when you show me how you shot it, I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off it</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t talk about this very much, but I come from a family of film people</p>
<p>And knowing how</p>
<p>stuff is done and watching how scenes are shot and the way they&rsquo;re framed and all this kind of stuff kind of is</p>
<p>Second nature discussion around the dinner table when I was a kid and i&rsquo;m watching this and all I could think about was</p>
<p>Oh, you know</p>
<p>I really missed my dad at that moment when you want to have your dad back and you want to show it to him</p>
<p>And you want to just say dad?</p>
<p>What do you think of that and just get his feedback?</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t know if you haven&rsquo;t read anything about this</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not like the fly on the wall or the spider up in the corner of the room</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re there the way they shot it you&rsquo;re like on the mission with the people in the mission</p>
<p>And so you feel like you are in real time</p>
<p>Here like almost I I felt like sometimes like I was looking through my own eyes</p>
<p>but then they&rsquo;d spin the camera around and you&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>I found myself thinking of all the other subjects besides the first world war that you could give this kind of treatment to and how</p>
<p>Interesting and weird and wild it would be in all those circumstances</p>
<p>It did change the feel of the film made it a very unique sort of feel because it didn&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>Uh, there are certain kinds of reactions you get out of the theater and you go. Oh, I have this</p>
<p>I mean, I remember with platoon. It was like i&rsquo;d been hit in the face with a sledgehammer</p>
<p>There was a mood and a lot of these films where war is a part of it</p>
<p>You get this a different feel not necessarily the platoon feel but a different feel when you walk out</p>
<p>This felt this was much more the way they shot it turned it into an edge of your seat thriller suspense thing</p>
<p>That reminded me more of some of the really well done horror movies when I was a teenager and you would just go</p>
<p>Holy cow</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some kind of dopamine or something that it&rsquo;s pumped into my brain</p>
<p>Because I felt like I was on the edge of my anything could happen to me at any time</p>
<p>I felt the same way in 1917</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was watching one of these war films where there are tens of thousands of people in a panoramic</p>
<p>You know fields of glory or paths of glory type of movie</p>
<p>It was much more of a holy cow</p>
<p>My heart rate is up and I feel like i&rsquo;ve actually gone on this mission with these guys</p>
<p>I loved it. I thought they did a great job. And so did the you know academy of motion pictures, obviously, too</p>
<p>This is the kind of film you&rsquo;re going to want to splurge for the extra clarity and all that because they did a fantastic job</p>
<p>If you want to hear how they did it, by the way, i&rsquo;m told there&rsquo;s going to be some fabulous bonus content</p>
<p>along with all this you&rsquo;ll get the whole story on the behind the scenes cinematic ideas the</p>
<p>Uh, the music was fantastic. The soundtrack was fantastic exclusive interviews with the cast and production crew commentary</p>
<p>Uh by director and co-writer sam mendes and the director of photography well worth your time. Enjoy it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available to own march 10th 2020 on digital streaming and of course march 24th</p>
<p>For those of you who want to see it in 4k ultra hd or blu-ray and I just have to tell you</p>
<p>Uh, this is the kind of film you&rsquo;re going to want to splurge for the extra clarity and all that because uh,</p>
<p>They did a fantastic job</p>
