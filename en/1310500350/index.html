    <p>The following is a conversation with Ed Calderon,</p>
<p>a security specialist who has worked for many years</p>
<p>on counter-narcotics and organized crime investigation</p>
<p>in the northern border region of Mexico.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you follow the writing and courses</p>
<p>on his Patreon and website, edsmanifesto.com.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of his sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Policy Genius for life insurance,</p>
<p>Bambi for HR services, Onnit for supplements,</p>
<p>and Insight Tracker for biomonitoring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Policy Genius,</p>
<p>a marketplace for finding and buying insurance.</p>
<p>I often meditate on my mortality.</p>
<p>Every day when I wake up, I have a mantra,</p>
<p>part of which I literally imagine the day before me</p>
<p>being the last day I have on this earth.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a really powerful way</p>
<p>to clarify what matters.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not about the career.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even about maybe the people in your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the way in which you interact with those people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the richness of feeling</p>
<p>that you draw from every single moment</p>
<p>you have with those people.</p>
<p>And even with the moments you have by yourself,</p>
<p>just the intensity of life itself.</p>
<p>How much are you open to experiencing that intensity?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what meditating on your mortality does.</p>
<p>It increases your openness</p>
<p>to that ever-present intensity that&rsquo;s all around us.</p>
<p>Anyway, with Policy Genius,</p>
<p>you can find life insurance policies</p>
<p>that start at just $17 per month for $500,000 of coverage.</p>

<p>This show is also brought to you by Bambi,</p>
<p>an outsourced and automated HR solution for business.</p>
<p>Bambi was built to give business</p>
<p>a dedicated yet cost-effective HR option</p>
<p>at just $99 per month.</p>
<p>We are currently on this incredible team,</p>
<p>an incredible journey we have together on the podcast.</p>
<p>Sort of this creative pursuit of editing, of planning,</p>
<p>just figuring this whole thing out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just very fortunate to be working</p>
<p>with incredible people, a variety of people.</p>
<p>They all have different backgrounds,</p>
<p>a different way they see the world,</p>
<p>a different way they think,</p>
<p>they have different flaws and strengths.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a constant inspiration to me</p>
<p>to have a chance to work with them.</p>
<p>Now, when you have a team like we do,</p>
<p>or a larger team as it grows and grows in size,</p>
<p>human resources is really important.</p>
<p>And especially when you&rsquo;re a small business,</p>
<p>it is indeed important, but it should also be affordable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the $99 per month that Bambi provides</p>
<p>is a huge incentive to try them out.</p>

<p>This episode is also brought to you by Onnit,</p>
<p>a nutrition supplement and fitness company</p>
<p>that make AlphaBrain, which is a nootropic</p>
<p>that helps support memory, mental speed, and focus.</p>
<p>I take it when I have deep work sessions,</p>
<p>especially in the morning.</p>
<p>It keeps changing, but these days when I wake up,</p>
<p>I do a mantra, I walk over, get an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>as the coffee&rsquo;s being made,</p>
<p>then an athletic greens drink for the nutrition.</p>
<p>And finally, I walk over with the coffee to my computer.</p>
<p>And my favorite thing to do to start the day</p>
<p>is something that I left unfinished from the night before,</p>
<p>which would be a programming task.</p>
<p>So anything involving programming,</p>
<p>when you just have this screen full of code</p>
<p>and I can focus on a design problem,</p>
<p>for some reason it&rsquo;s a great warmup to my brain.</p>
<p>I can clear out the distractions of the world</p>
<p>and focus on these little puzzles.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also clear that I can make progress</p>
<p>on solving little puzzles, little puzzles here,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s debugging or building a new thing,</p>
<p>all of it just makes me really happy,</p>
<p>especially as the project nears completion,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the intermediate stages of its completion</p>
<p>or the final thing.</p>
<p>So not particularly, oftentimes with that programming</p>
<p>is like scripts that automate various aspects of my life</p>
<p>and make me more efficient,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also larger projects that I do</p>
<p>for machine learning and robotics work and beyond.</p>
<p>Anyway, during those moments,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m feeling really out of it,</p>
<p>I will take an AlphaBrain to give me a boost.</p>
<p>You can get a special discount on AlphaBrain</p>
<p>at lexfriedman.com slash on it.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by InsideTracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting softer and fatter</p>
<p>over the past few months.</p>
<p>And recently, a few days ago, I decided to change that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m on a stricter diet now,</p>
<p>on a stricter exercise regime.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing sort of the improvement</p>
<p>in how I feel about this world,</p>
<p>how I feel about just the way I move about the world,</p>
<p>the way I think for prolonged periods of time</p>
<p>is able to maintain focus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very low carb diet.</p>
<p>I mostly fast, mostly once a day.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe that&rsquo;s for another time</p>
<p>to discuss what my preferences are there.</p>
<p>Maybe people don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Probably they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>But my body is definitely operating</p>
<p>at a higher level of performance under a strict diet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to measure that through data,</p>
<p>to get blood data, to get DNA data, fitness tracker data,</p>
<p>and use all of that to see if I&rsquo;m doing better or worse</p>
<p>than I was before.</p>
<p>And based on that, make recommendations</p>
<p>for diet and lifestyle changes.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Ed Calderon.</p>
<p>What does your experience in counter-narcotics,</p>
<p>investigating the Mexican drug cartel</p>
<p>teach you about human nature?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I mean, first off, anybody can be got.</p>
<p>Anybody can be corrupted.</p>
<p>You know, you work in that field</p>
<p>and you realistically, the training we got</p>
<p>and profiling and investigation and stuff like that</p>
<p>was basically you learn from the older guys there.</p>
<p>And some of those guys were already corrupted</p>
<p>from the start.</p>
<p>So trust no one.</p>
<p>I remember seeing that X-Files episode</p>
<p>where that was stated.</p>
<p>You quickly learn that even if you are somebody</p>
<p>that to your own mind appears incorruptible,</p>
<p>small changes happen around you, wheels get greased,</p>
<p>money gets put in front of you</p>
<p>and or things get threatened like your life.</p>
<p>And sometimes the payment for some of this corruption</p>
<p>is just to continue on living.</p>
<p>You encounter people that seem incorruptible</p>
<p>that go through FBI background checks,</p>
<p>that go through all of the security measures</p>
<p>that all of us were put through, polygraph test.</p>
<p>And then later on, it turns out they were on the take</p>
<p>before they became somebody that was corrupted.</p>
<p>I think what I found out is that anybody at any level,</p>
<p>they could be a very strong, hard to get person right now,</p>
<p>but people get corrupted through their families,</p>
<p>through need.</p>
<p>Mexico is a place where a lot of instability occurs.</p>
<p>So financial needs, health.</p>
<p>So a crack could form through the wall of integrity</p>
<p>and then over time it seeps in somehow.</p>
<p>Mexico has a culture of corruption.</p>
<p>Like you have your kid that goes to school,</p>
<p>at public school and you want him to be in the morning,</p>
<p>not in the afternoon time period.</p>
<p>So you go off and grease the wheels</p>
<p>with the director of the school.</p>
<p>People hearing this in Mexico will nod their heads</p>
<p>because this is something that happens from early on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a systemic and cultural thing to it,</p>
<p>as far as getting around rules.</p>
<p>And this happens because the people that are in charge</p>
<p>in Mexico, the government is,</p>
<p>their tandem amount is trust between criminals</p>
<p>and the cartels down there for a lot of the culture.</p>
<p>So people don&rsquo;t trust the government</p>
<p>and much less criminality.</p>
<p>When you meet a person sticking on human nature,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible to figure out</p>
<p>if they can be trusted?</p>
<p>So you said anyone could be corrupted.</p>
<p>How long would you need to talk to a person?</p>
<p>And even in your own personal private life,</p>
<p>just a friend?</p>
<p>Or is trust the thing that&rsquo;s never really guaranteed?</p>
<p>I think that trust is never really guaranteed.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people are gonna say that&rsquo;s a sad way</p>
<p>and hard way of living your life,</p>
<p>but life experience at my end,</p>
<p>people change.</p>
<p>The dynamics of a relationship might change.</p>
<p>I look at people&rsquo;s character,</p>
<p>specifically their past and past experiences if I can.</p>
<p>Somebody that presents himself in front of you as somebody,</p>
<p>but you quickly learn that that somebody is just a mask</p>
<p>or a persona that they kind of created for themselves.</p>
<p>And they might not even be aware of the persona?</p>
<p>Like, is there some deep psychological stuff?</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced a lot of failure in my life.</p>
<p>You can see it in my nose.</p>
<p>You can see it in my lack of a digit.</p>
<p>The amount of failures you can see in somebody</p>
<p>and how they wear them sometimes is a pretty telling thing</p>
<p>as far as them being able to be trusted</p>
<p>or that you can trust their story</p>
<p>or their experience.</p>
<p>And when I say experience, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met some criminals, like former criminals,</p>
<p>or some people of that background</p>
<p>that I trust with my life,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not reformed,</p>
<p>but they figured out that that&rsquo;s not a life</p>
<p>that can live long enough to kind of continue on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve also met people that are in law enforcement</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t trust with my car keys,</p>
<p>because whatever persona they adopted over the years</p>
<p>is a pretty good one, pretty good mask.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s such a good mask,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re wearing it.</p>
<p>And on top of that, it&rsquo;s not just the psychology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a neurobiology to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate and deliberate</p>
<p>to surround myself with good people throughout my life,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve recently gotten to sort of observe,</p>
<p>not close to me, but nearby,</p>
<p>somebody that could be classified as a sociopath</p>
<p>and a narcissist.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t want to use those psychological terms,</p>
<p>but just, it&rsquo;s like, oh,</p>
<p>people come with different biology, too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just like the trauma you might experience</p>
<p>in your early life and all the deep complexity</p>
<p>that leads to the psychology that you have as an adult,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the biology you come with,</p>
<p>the nature, that you might not just have the machine</p>
<p>that can empathize deeply with the experience of others,</p>
<p>or maybe a machine that gets off,</p>
<p>gets a dopamine rush from the manipulation of other humans</p>
<p>or the control of other humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, put an example of my own background.</p>
<p>My mom didn&rsquo;t have a father.</p>
<p>You know, he left really early on in their childhood.</p>
<p>You know, my mom raised her two sisters</p>
<p>and basically kept a household.</p>
<p>She was a great mom.</p>
<p>She was a badass.</p>
<p>You know, she was very independent.</p>
<p>She showed me how to be independent.</p>
<p>She showed me how to kind of watch out for others</p>
<p>and kind of build me up in that way.</p>
<p>And I had a great childhood as far as, you know,</p>
<p>as far as her and kind of like how she molded me.</p>
<p>Later on, I figured out that when I had my own kid,</p>
<p>you know, I figured out that she was basically</p>
<p>trying to make me into what she didn&rsquo;t have in a way.</p>
<p>And if I can get to see somebody&rsquo;s parents, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually a sign of something, at least for me,</p>
<p>as far as figuring out where people are.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something to be said</p>
<p>about nature and nurture and how some people come up.</p>
<p>Some people are just born with that predatory instinct,</p>
<p>you know, and you&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>I mean, they spend their whole life practicing</p>
<p>how to hide it.</p>
<p>But if you can figure out somebody&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>background, childhood, where they&rsquo;re from,</p>
<p>you can kind of tell something about them.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m from Tijuana, you know, I&rsquo;m a survivor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my background as far as where I&rsquo;m from.</p>
<p>Culturally, genetically, psychologically,</p>
<p>the full shebang.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess some people are born</p>
<p>with certain predispositions,</p>
<p>and if they&rsquo;re in the right environment,</p>
<p>some of the negative aspects might flourish</p>
<p>more than others, you know.</p>
<p>For me, I mean, I grew up skateboarding in Tijuana,</p>
<p>and I remember breaking into my first backyard pool.</p>
<p>It was a house that a cartel guy owned,</p>
<p>and we used to skate the pool in the back of it.</p>
<p>So I learned how to pop open padlocks</p>
<p>with a small vehicle hydraulic lift.</p>
<p>And I remember doing that, and later on in life,</p>
<p>I got to train with people from other parts of Mexico</p>
<p>and work with them.</p>
<p>And I remember pulling that trick off,</p>
<p>and they were like looking at me like,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;d you learn that?</p>
<p>Like some burglars in Tijuana, you know?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, wow, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Are all people from Tijuana like that?</p>
<p>And I said, no, we&rsquo;re not all like that,</p>
<p>but I guess in some way we are,</p>
<p>because Tijuana produces kids like that.</p>
<p>She produces, like the environment itself produces</p>
<p>a pretty specific person, I guess.</p>
<p>Our normal or our baseline normal</p>
<p>is way different than most.</p>
<p>The trajectories that you can take in life</p>
<p>are defined in a way that aren&rsquo;t available</p>
<p>elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, part of that is psychological,</p>
<p>part of that is cultural and so on.</p>
<p>Part of that is the cultural trauma,</p>
<p>but then also the ethical lines based on the corruption.</p>
<p>Because I grew up in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the same kind of understanding</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some gray area of corruption.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s always there, like on the outskirts</p>
<p>or even in the center, how you can grease things</p>
<p>to make things easier, and how it&rsquo;s like a personal thing.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just pay off the, in Tijuana we have a mordida</p>
<p>is what we call it, when you pay a cop off.</p>
<p>Una mordida means a bite.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the bite aspect?</p>
<p>So you get stopped for a traffic violation of some sort</p>
<p>and the cop walks up to you.</p>
<p>Obviously you don&rsquo;t say the word bite,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a slang term for it.</p>
<p>And he asks for your paperwork</p>
<p>and if you get fined or get a ticket,</p>
<p>you say, can I pay the ticket here, is what they say.</p>
<p>And put your money inside of the paperwork</p>
<p>and hand it over to the cop, mordida.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m just gonna do it and nobody knows,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a systemic thing, like a lot of people do it.</p>
<p>And then they don&rsquo;t trust the police</p>
<p>because they are fed with this.</p>
<p>Yeah, same thing was in the Soviet Union, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s something inside you</p>
<p>where that kind of, those opportunities come,</p>
<p>like with a police officer,</p>
<p>where you realize you could just pay a little bit of money</p>
<p>and get out of a thing.</p>
<p>And then you realize you can pay a little bit of money</p>
<p>or do a favor to get your kids in a better school</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But there comes opportunities where you were,</p>
<p>all right, if I do this little thing,</p>
<p>I can make, I can get a huge promotion,</p>
<p>I can get a huge increase in my power</p>
<p>or get a lot of money.</p>
<p>And something inside you says, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>And I wonder what that is.</p>
<p>Because it feels different than the legal systems</p>
<p>within which you operate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some kind of basic human integrity, human decency.</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s constructed or it&rsquo;s always there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, again, nature versus nurture.</p>
<p>I think, for me, it was looking at,</p>
<p>at seeing that in somebody else</p>
<p>that I kind of learned about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a man that I consider a mentor figure.</p>
<p>His name&rsquo;s Lieutenant Colonel Izalda.</p>
<p>He was a lieutenant colonel from the army</p>
<p>that basically came over and took over the group</p>
<p>that I used to work with.</p>
<p>He was incorruptible.</p>
<p>That was the essence or the aura that he projected.</p>
<p>The first time he went off on patrol</p>
<p>when he was placed in charge of us,</p>
<p>I actually drove him around Tijuana.</p>
<p>He was one of those lead from the front type of people.</p>
<p>The amount of assassination attempts he got</p>
<p>was basically a proof of how uncorruptible he was</p>
<p>because they kept trying to pay him off.</p>
<p>And when that didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>they tried to kill him several times.</p>
<p>I think the last assassination attempt</p>
<p>took the use of his legs.</p>
<p>And that man is still a dangerous person in my mind.</p>
<p>But for me, and people can gather a little bit</p>
<p>about my background and where I&rsquo;m from</p>
<p>and some of the access I currently have</p>
<p>to train the federal institutions here in the US</p>
<p>as far as my background and if I was corrupted or not,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of that out there.</p>
<p>The Catholic guilt that&rsquo;s kind of built into some of us</p>
<p>is always kind of there, you know?</p>
<p>El cucuy vive bajo la cama, the devil was under the bed.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t consider myself Catholic.</p>
<p>Consider myself culturally Catholic, I think,</p>
<p>is what I kind of say with that.</p>
<p>I had a pretty good structure with my dad and my mom</p>
<p>at the house and they never let me get away with things.</p>
<p>And I think my mom was a pretty big moral compass for me.</p>
<p>But Lieutenant Colonel kind of leading from example</p>
<p>and seeing his work and how much profound change</p>
<p>he caused in the people that work with him</p>
<p>as far as we felt supported</p>
<p>and we felt like we had a guiding figure during this.</p>
<p>Tijuana was the most dangerous city on the planet</p>
<p>when I was working there and he took charge.</p>
<p>What does it take to be a man, the Lieutenant Colonel,</p>
<p>who maintains integrity after assassination attempts?</p>
<p>Is it possible for a normal human to do that</p>
<p>or, again, is it genetic?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this.</p>
<p>Seeing him, I mean, the last assassination attempt he had</p>
<p>that took the use of his legs, he was with his kid.</p>
<p>There was a recklessness to it, you know?</p>
<p>I can see that now,</p>
<p>like now that I have enough distance from it,</p>
<p>I could see that there&rsquo;s a recklessness to being that way.</p>
<p>And also you&rsquo;re putting jeopardy people around you</p>
<p>if you take that route.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a sacrifice to it,</p>
<p>a very powerful and hard one to make for a lot of people.</p>
<p>For me, it was, I wouldn&rsquo;t get picked to get on board</p>
<p>with some of the operations groups</p>
<p>that I wanted to work with</p>
<p>because I was known for not taking money</p>
<p>or not being trusted by certain older segments</p>
<p>of the organization that I was with,</p>
<p>with stuff because they knew that I wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t on the, I wouldn&rsquo;t get money.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always a weird sacrifice to it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re almost kind of like masochistic in that way</p>
<p>when you get approached with it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, why are you being an idiot?</p>
<p>Why are you driving around that beat up car?</p>
<p>Look at the Hummer H2 that just drove in</p>
<p>with the other guy that is doing exactly your same job.</p>
<p>So society as a whole down there doesn&rsquo;t reward it</p>
<p>or at least doesn&rsquo;t see it in the people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t take that route in Mexico.</p>
<p>For them, all cops are corrupt, all of them.</p>
<p>And seeing it again from the outside,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not there anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost like a, why didn&rsquo;t you Ed?</p>
<p>That could have been easier maybe,</p>
<p>or you could have been dead long ago</p>
<p>because people that are on the takedown there</p>
<p>are usually owned by one side or the other.</p>
<p>And when that gets found out,</p>
<p>if you have somebody that you&rsquo;re paying off</p>
<p>that hints you off of drug operations in the area,</p>
<p>your rivals are pretty keen on killing you.</p>
<p>Money aside, so like a Hummer aside,</p>
<p>how much of a motivator&rsquo;s fear?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say for me, I didn&rsquo;t think I was gonna live</p>
<p>to see 30, I was sure of it.</p>
<p>Did that concept scare you</p>
<p>or was that just a principle of life</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re operating under?</p>
<p>I lost my brother when I was 13 on it too.</p>
<p>He was 19, he was like the VIP of the family.</p>
<p>You miss him?</p>
<p>Oh, every day.</p>
<p>He was a skateboarded BMX,</p>
<p>motorcycle hunter, one of the best marksmen</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever seen shoot.</p>
<p>So better than you at everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was the best of us is what we would say.</p>
<p>And when he died, it was almost like a concert</p>
<p>at his funeral.</p>
<p>I met three of his girlfriends</p>
<p>that all introduced themselves like the one.</p>
<p>To this day, every now and then I get to pull the side down</p>
<p>when I go back home and, hey, you&rsquo;re Eric&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>Despite all the stuff that I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still, every now and then I get recognized.</p>
<p>That made my mom and my dad go into a horrible depression</p>
<p>and basically left me to my devices when I was a kid</p>
<p>from 13 onwards.</p>
<p>I had this self-destructive aspect to me after that,</p>
<p>I think, so again, something that&rsquo;s come up in therapy</p>
<p>after I&rsquo;ve been gone through all that</p>
<p>and had this notion that if I can only die good</p>
<p>in some way, shape or form or for something</p>
<p>that it would matter and they would look at me</p>
<p>with the same reverence I did with my brother.</p>
<p>So dying isn&rsquo;t the problem.</p>
<p>The goal of life is to die for something good.</p>
<p>Yeah, at least that was my mindset</p>
<p>going through that job.</p>
<p>I remember I was in medical school before that,</p>
<p>second year of medical school.</p>
<p>I was doing pretty good and then 9-11 happened</p>
<p>and that wasn&rsquo;t an option anymore for me.</p>
<p>The economy was horrible, couldn&rsquo;t afford to stay there.</p>
<p>So I sat in the newspaper and my big brother</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s still alive and head, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>no te animas, you&rsquo;re not gonna do that shit.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t dare.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden I was in a field</p>
<p>having my hair shaved off and a bunch of the gafes,</p>
<p>the guys that later turned into the Zeta cartel,</p>
<p>military men were in charge of our training</p>
<p>and I went through that process.</p>
<p>In what field were you and why is your head being shaved?</p>
<p>And what the hell was going through your mind?</p>
<p>What was the leap that you took?</p>
<p>I was sold the idea of this being a new</p>
<p>Americanized police force that they were constructing.</p>
<p>In Mexico. In Mexico.</p>
<p>So elite special force kind of.</p>
<p>Prestigious, elite, the people in charge of our training</p>
<p>were a lot basically ex-Mexican gafe people.</p>
<p>Gafes are what the special forces kind of originated.</p>
<p>A lot of their members turned into the Zeta cartel.</p>
<p>So they were brutal in their training.</p>
<p>We were sold this idea of it being scientific,</p>
<p>like educated based and like a career path.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden we&rsquo;re in this refurbished prison</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t good enough to be a prison</p>
<p>and they turned it into a training ground.</p>
<p>And I quickly kind of realized that they were training us</p>
<p>to be a paramilitary group,</p>
<p>not a community policing organization,</p>
<p>which in my mind, I thought that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we were gonna be doing.</p>
<p>What was the hardest process of that training for you?</p>
<p>Because this is like a fragile, innocent boy</p>
<p>becomes a man kind of process.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re turning us into something that they could use.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a breaking down.</p>
<p>They break down the individual.</p>
<p>Physically and mentally?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a half done initiation process,</p>
<p>I think in a way, looking at it from now to the past.</p>
<p>The shaving of the hair, the stripping off your identity,</p>
<p>everybody gets a number.</p>
<p>The uniforms, the running around</p>
<p>and being treated like human garbage.</p>
<p>The first thing they said to us</p>
<p>when we were lined up in that field was,</p>
<p>hay pan y verga para comer aqui, se acabo el pan.</p>
<p>Which means there&rsquo;s bread and dick to eat here.</p>
<p>And the bread ran out a week ago, right?</p>
<p>So it was, I mean, I can&rsquo;t equate it to anything</p>
<p>in the military here in the United States</p>
<p>because people down there could actually</p>
<p>get physical with us.</p>
<p>I mean, they could actually hit us</p>
<p>and punch us and shit like that,</p>
<p>which is not allowed here anymore,</p>
<p>at least in most of the militaries</p>
<p>and as horrible as down there.</p>
<p>AK-47s being shot around us to simulate reality,</p>
<p>basically causing hearing loss, that type of stuff.</p>
<p>So chaos, abuse, really challenging you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Again, physically and mentally.</p>
<p>And an open door there always.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t wanna be here, you can just walk out.</p>
<p>And the more you go into it,</p>
<p>time-wise you&rsquo;re more invested you are.</p>
<p>So in a way you&rsquo;re kind of building your own chains</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re going through that process.</p>
<p>Were you tempted to walk out?</p>
<p>Yeah, several times, several times.</p>
<p>Specifically seeing some of the ways</p>
<p>that people that I thought were better</p>
<p>or stronger than me were walking out or quitting</p>
<p>because of something that happened in there.</p>
<p>There was some sexual assault stuff</p>
<p>happening in there as well.</p>
<p>Were you afraid of that?</p>
<p>Always, you know, you&rsquo;re in a place like that</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s females in the environment</p>
<p>and some of the instructors are doing what they do.</p>
<p>So that was like a cause for alarm.</p>
<p>I mean, these people are in charge of our safety</p>
<p>and education and look at what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>So you could see some of the smarter ones leaving,</p>
<p>not looking at this as a viable choice for life.</p>
<p>How did that change you that those few months?</p>
<p>I had this motivation,</p>
<p>this idealistic motivation in my head,</p>
<p>making a difference and they drill a lot of nationalistic</p>
<p>kind of the flag marching,</p>
<p>it being part of a group and the group being,</p>
<p>you know, behind you and all of this.</p>
<p>What was the nationalistic pride?</p>
<p>It was in the nation of Mexico?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the vision of this great nation of Mexico</p>
<p>that you were, did you believe, did it get into your blood?</p>
<p>It got into my, I mean, it&rsquo;s an indoctrination,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a paramilitary group.</p>
<p>So everything there is basically modeled after the military.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what they were trying to kind of instill in us.</p>
<p>I was a team leader in there after three months,</p>
<p>basically I was, we went through a bunch of trials,</p>
<p>physical trials, mental trials and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And some of us were named team leaders and I, you know,</p>
<p>bought into it, you know, I&rsquo;m the, I&rsquo;m supposed to be here.</p>
<p>Look at me, I&rsquo;m making headways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sticking out a bit, you know,</p>
<p>and I was pretty proud of what I was going through there,</p>
<p>six months.</p>
<p>Then you get the reality check when you signed</p>
<p>the dotted line and how that, none of it really meant</p>
<p>anything as far as what we were about to go out and do,</p>
<p>you know, an example of this,</p>
<p>we were trained with a 92 FS Beretta,</p>
<p>which is a nine millimeter pistol, Italian made.</p>
<p>We got to shoot 20 rounds out of that gun.</p>
<p>And then we, when we got out, we were handed a Glock 17,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve never seen one in my life.</p>
<p>I was trying to figure out where the safety was</p>
<p>and a few other people there were handling those guns</p>
<p>in a horrible manner.</p>
<p>So we were very under-trained, under-equipped</p>
<p>and there was a lot of assumptions about what we knew</p>
<p>and all of a sudden we&rsquo;re being cast into this,</p>
<p>the start of one of the bloodiest</p>
<p>and longest lived modern conflicts in our history</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t get called that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically been an ongoing war in Mexico</p>
<p>that is still to this day, you know, amassing bodies.</p>
<p>So the Mexican drug war.</p>
<p>The Mexican drug war, which is, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started</p>
<p>because when I was going through training,</p>
<p>there was already stuff going on.</p>
<p>I went into training in 2004 and there were already,</p>
<p>you know, major cartel related events all over Mexico</p>
<p>by then, but not at the size or scope</p>
<p>as I was about to go into, you know,</p>
<p>when President Felipe Calderon kind of took office down there</p>
<p>and actually officially kind of kicked it off</p>
<p>by putting the military in play as part of a,</p>
<p>as part of it basically militarized the drug war,</p>
<p>you know, including us.</p>
<p>Who are the major players in this drug war?</p>
<p>So the politicians, the military, the police force,</p>
<p>the cartels, all Mexican, then the United States,</p>
<p>China, just to lay out all the pieces on the board.</p>
<p>First off, there are giant local drug markets in Mexico</p>
<p>that are fought over, you know,</p>
<p>just local drug markets that are huge in scope.</p>
<p>So no exporting to other locations?</p>
<p>Just to start, yeah.</p>
<p>So a big problem in Mexico is basically</p>
<p>those local drug markets.</p>
<p>And an example of that and one I have a lot of experience</p>
<p>with is the one in Tijuana,</p>
<p>which not only feeds the local populace,</p>
<p>but also feeds the populace from San Diego</p>
<p>that crosses down into Tijuana and buys their product there.</p>
<p>And now, you know, a phenomenon that&rsquo;s occurring now</p>
<p>is marijuana trafficking is going from California</p>
<p>down into Mexico because they produce better weed,</p>
<p>you know, which is fascinating to see now.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s already a channel</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of like reusing that channel.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of people and vehicles getting checked</p>
<p>when they drive down.</p>
<p>And Tijuana is being called San Diego South now</p>
<p>because, you know, all the economic migrants,</p>
<p>you know, are living down there.</p>
<p>90% of all houses in Tijuana,</p>
<p>new houses are being bought up by Americans.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;ll tell you something about the impact and change</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on down there.</p>
<p>So you have these local drug markets</p>
<p>that are being fought over.</p>
<p>You also have these drug routes that go through Mexico,</p>
<p>up into Mexico, around Mexico, through the ocean,</p>
<p>under the wall, you know, drug tunnels over the wall</p>
<p>and on backpacks on migrants</p>
<p>that go up into the United States.</p>
<p>Not only do the cartels make money off drug trafficking,</p>
<p>but also extortion, money laundering,</p>
<p>paid protection schemes.</p>
<p>You know, any mining operation in Mexico</p>
<p>will have to pay protection, you know,</p>
<p>or else they&rsquo;ll get hit.</p>
<p>A lot of times the largest money makers</p>
<p>for some of these criminal groups are, you know,</p>
<p>protecting and taxing anybody that goes across the border.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also a big issue.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just, again,</p>
<p>some Americans think it&rsquo;s like the cartels, you know,</p>
<p>they imagine this single or maybe two or three groups.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several out there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a current estimate,</p>
<p>but last time I checked,</p>
<p>it was somewhere in the vicinity of 50 to 70,</p>
<p>different groups, some small,</p>
<p>that just dedicate themselves</p>
<p>to a single little town somewhere.</p>
<p>There are armed groups</p>
<p>that are basically in control of that area</p>
<p>to some bigger federations like the Sinaloa Cartel,</p>
<p>which is probably currently the largest</p>
<p>and most powerful one in Mexico.</p>
<p>And the New Generation Cartel,</p>
<p>which is growing exponentially right now.</p>
<p>So these criminal groups are players in that conflict.</p>
<p>Then another player that doesn&rsquo;t get talked about</p>
<p>is politics, politicians.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an ongoing discussion that has been going on,</p>
<p>I think, since Trump was elected</p>
<p>about cartels being terrorist organizations or not,</p>
<p>or if they fit that description.</p>
<p>Well, you know, we are living through multiple assassinations</p>
<p>on political candidates out in Mexico right now.</p>
<p>And most of those assassinations are motivated</p>
<p>by one side sponsoring one candidate</p>
<p>and the other side sponsoring the other.</p>
<p>What I mean by sides, I mean cartel groups.</p>
<p>So they have elected officials that are on the take.</p>
<p>And this is, we have many governors</p>
<p>who are under investigation on the run</p>
<p>or in prison right now, state governors.</p>
<p>So politics is involved in it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big player as well.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>when you think about the cartel problems,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think, well, some, at least some,</p>
<p>most people don&rsquo;t think about that aspect of it.</p>
<p>So to have integrity as a politician in Mexico</p>
<p>means you have no protection</p>
<p>and under constant threat of assassination.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just seen the arrest and prosecution</p>
<p>of the head of all Conrad Cartel operations</p>
<p>when I was active in the form of Garcia Luna,</p>
<p>who was, he was the guy, Felipe Calderon,</p>
<p>who kicked off the drug war.</p>
<p>That was his guy.</p>
<p>Turns out he was on the take at a level.</p>
<p>Is there like a spectrum of how on the take you can be?</p>
<p>Are there ethical lines that you can cross?</p>
<p>Some of it is money.</p>
<p>And then is it possible to operate in a gray area</p>
<p>that does not result in destructive ethical violations,</p>
<p>deep ethical violations?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I don&rsquo;t think there is realistically.</p>
<p>I mean, anything that kind of supports some of these groups,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supporting things of a horrible nature.</p>
<p>I just posted recently on my Instagram account</p>
<p>of a lady that was in Guanajuato.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s one of seven recently assassinated women</p>
<p>that are looking for their kids, basically.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of groups and organizations out there</p>
<p>in Mexico and some in Tijuana that I&rsquo;ve actually walked with</p>
<p>who are taking control of trying to find the bodies</p>
<p>of their kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s her up there.</p>
<p>Maria Carmela Vasquez, a mother who searched</p>
<p>for a missing son, was shot to death outside her home</p>
<p>on Sunday.</p>
<p>Her son, Osmar Vasquez, disappeared on June 14th.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old woman is the fifth mother</p>
<p>to be killed this year while searching</p>
<p>for their missing loved ones.</p>
<p>She was a member of the Payamo Missing Person Collective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many groups out in Mexico</p>
<p>who basically have given up on trusting the government</p>
<p>to find their kids.</p>
<p>The number of missing in Mexico is a debated topic</p>
<p>because the government itself doesn&rsquo;t release those numbers</p>
<p>or at least hasn&rsquo;t done a good job about keeping them</p>
<p>and or releasing them.</p>
<p>Mexico is a country that has industrialized body disposal.</p>
<p>In Tijuana, we had the stew maker,</p>
<p>the legendary stew maker, which is a guy</p>
<p>that basically used caustic acid</p>
<p>to get rid of bodies at a massive level.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a separate operation for getting rid</p>
<p>of bodies and murdering the people.</p>
<p>At least in Tijuana, we saw that phenomenon</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s obvious that it&rsquo;s going on all over Mexico.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s having those discussions about mass murder</p>
<p>and getting rid of people?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about World War II recently</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s aggressive innovation on the Nazi side</p>
<p>of how to get rid of a large number of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for the longest time, both the Soviets</p>
<p>and the Soviets were more brutal with this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally, it&rsquo;s a engineering problem</p>
<p>of how you kill a large number of people</p>
<p>and get rid of their bodies.</p>
<p>So the Soviets were more into just laying people down</p>
<p>into the grave face down and then shooting them</p>
<p>in the back of the head and then doing that on mass scale.</p>
<p>So you just pile people on.</p>
<p>And then there was obviously innovation with the Holocaust</p>
<p>in terms of gassing people and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly where these trade craft skills</p>
<p>are coming from specifically.</p>
<p>You hear discussions of Israelis training</p>
<p>some of the cartel groups back in the late nineties,</p>
<p>specifically the Arionofis cartel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stories about that.</p>
<p>A security specialist coming down and showing them things</p>
<p>like how to make caustic soda,</p>
<p>how to put rocks inside of bodies</p>
<p>and then chicken wire them around</p>
<p>and throw them into the ocean or river</p>
<p>so that their bodies don&rsquo;t float.</p>
<p>And when you kind of-</p>
<p>You put rocks inside of body</p>
<p>to make sure the body doesn&rsquo;t float.</p>
<p>So you open up the intestinal tract, put rocks inside,</p>
<p>you cut where tattoos are, you take off hands and faces</p>
<p>and throw them somewhere else</p>
<p>and you wrap them in chicken wire.</p>
<p>So make it not identifiable.</p>
<p>Yeah, and throw them into a body of water.</p>
<p>And this is a horrible thing, but it&rsquo;s actually-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a craft, it&rsquo;s a trade craft.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trade craft and there&rsquo;s a link to the US</p>
<p>as far as that trade craft.</p>
<p>You have to remember that the United States</p>
<p>had a thing called School of the Americas and the CIA</p>
<p>and they showed things and a lot of that stuff</p>
<p>is out there in the hands of people</p>
<p>that are of that generation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a manual-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a manual somewhere.</p>
<p>Like with chapters and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>how to get rid of the body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s manuals out there.</p>
<p>Under time constraints or what are,</p>
<p>how identifiable can the body be afterwards?</p>
<p>What are geographical constraints?</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think that was common back in the early 2000s</p>
<p>and maybe the late 90s</p>
<p>when some of these things were going on.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve lost even that</p>
<p>as far as respect for the government</p>
<p>or bodies being found.</p>
<p>Right now what you usually see is just bodies being burnt</p>
<p>to a crisp and buried in a field somewhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually what you&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Some of the groups like this woman belong to</p>
<p>basically taking it upon themselves</p>
<p>to go out to find clandestine graves</p>
<p>in the outskirts of the towns that they live in,</p>
<p>probing the ground with these metal probes</p>
<p>and seeing if whatever they encounter</p>
<p>in the bottom of these clandestine graves</p>
<p>stinks or not.</p>
<p>If they find IDs or clothing,</p>
<p>they kind of gather that</p>
<p>and they basically present it</p>
<p>to the investigative authorities</p>
<p>in the towns or the states they live in,</p>
<p>which basically are doing their jobs.</p>
<p>Over 90% of all murders in Mexico were never solved.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ve even stopped trying</p>
<p>to get rid of bodies in that way.</p>
<p>How does a cartel take power?</p>
<p>How does it gain control of this local area</p>
<p>that you mentioned and then grow,</p>
<p>take control of a region?</p>
<p>And how does it do so in this dynamic relationship</p>
<p>between politicians and the military and the police force?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing that happens over time.</p>
<p>There has always been a big effort,</p>
<p>even when I was in,</p>
<p>to buy or own certain members of the police force.</p>
<p>Even when we&rsquo;re going through training,</p>
<p>some people get pulled out during training</p>
<p>because they were found out to have some sort of parent</p>
<p>or sibling that was a cartel member</p>
<p>or their FBI background check came back negative,</p>
<p>you know, when they were already in the training program.</p>
<p>So I think part of it is,</p>
<p>first off, they take advantage of the fact</p>
<p>that Mexico is a young country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a country of young people.</p>
<p>We have a big group of young people</p>
<p>that have little to no opportunities to come up.</p>
<p>When I was in, when I went to take that career path,</p>
<p>a lot of my friends took the other option.</p>
<p>They went to work for some of these criminal groups.</p>
<p>So they have this going for them.</p>
<p>They basically have a lot of bodies to hire cheaply.</p>
<p>And leverage in terms of forcing those bodies</p>
<p>to do whatever is needed</p>
<p>because the alternative for those people is nothing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no options.</p>
<p>So you have a kid somewhere who is working on a field,</p>
<p>or you have a kid like me that was out of the job,</p>
<p>out of school.</p>
<p>And the only options for me was this ad in the newspaper,</p>
<p>which seemed like a long shot,</p>
<p>or going with some of my friends that had cars now</p>
<p>and were hanging out all night at these bars.</p>
<p>And some of them had, you know,</p>
<p>Draco AK-47 pistols in their cars</p>
<p>and it would look cool, you know.</p>
<p>So there is a trajectory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many trajectories possible in your life</p>
<p>where you could have been still operating</p>
<p>in a criminal organization in Mexico.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s not a lot of options, you know.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;d be good at it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m pretty good at what I do now,</p>
<p>which is teaching people how to detect it</p>
<p>and kind of fight against it, you know.</p>
<p>So I think-</p>
<p>I have a sense that the skills transfer pretty well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also the dark side of this whole thing.</p>
<p>A lot of the people that I used to work with,</p>
<p>you know, I know things and I have some training</p>
<p>and I had some specialized training.</p>
<p>And I currently do, I&rsquo;ve done, you know,</p>
<p>presentations for the Secret Service and the FBI</p>
<p>and you name it, I&rsquo;ve gone there and shown them what I do.</p>
<p>A lot of the people that I used to work with</p>
<p>who are out of the job are in the wind, you know.</p>
<p>And some of these people are way more trained than I am,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting what the reason why I get looked for</p>
<p>and they ask me questions</p>
<p>is because I actually have the experience</p>
<p>that my university was the most dangerous city</p>
<p>on the planet.</p>
<p>And when people ask me about some of that stuff,</p>
<p>like I could speak from experience</p>
<p>as far as encountering some of that directly.</p>
<p>Some of the people that I used to work with</p>
<p>who were way better at it than I am are in the wind.</p>
<p>Interesting thing in Mexico,</p>
<p>if you are of a police organization</p>
<p>and you get fired or you quit,</p>
<p>you are ineligible to join another police organization.</p>
<p>That discounts you.</p>
<p>So for somebody like me,</p>
<p>who was a professional operations group member</p>
<p>or a police officer in Mexico of that region,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no options for me outside of that.</p>
<p>So they themselves basically have created</p>
<p>this inescapable box for some of these people</p>
<p>that go into that line of work.</p>
<p>And where do they go after?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard offers of $12,000 to join</p>
<p>some of the organizations out there.</p>
<p>Plus, you know, they get benefits,</p>
<p>not like the government, you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for my liquidation check.</p>
<p>This has been out of service for like six, seven years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for my check.</p>
<p>So some of these people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious that the opportunities</p>
<p>are presented to them out there are stronger, you know.</p>
<p>And again, the youth is what gets eaten by this war.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the main things that they start with,</p>
<p>just the youth.</p>
<p>We had a phenomenon in Tijuana,</p>
<p>early, late 90s, early 2000s called the Narco Juniors.</p>
<p>Narco Juniors were basically bored,</p>
<p>middle class or upper class families,</p>
<p>had kids that were bored</p>
<p>and they just joined some of these cartel groups.</p>
<p>These cartel groups saw in them opportunities</p>
<p>to get into regular industry,</p>
<p>to go through the family businesses,</p>
<p>to kind of establish themselves,</p>
<p>use some of those businesses for storage</p>
<p>or figure out how to use</p>
<p>some of their transportation businesses for drug muelling.</p>
<p>So this is how they start in getting into different areas,</p>
<p>you know, that they regularly couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s how it starts, you know.</p>
<p>You owe somebody,</p>
<p>they get into paid protection type schemes,</p>
<p>which are also common all over Mexico.</p>
<p>And sooner or later, they start owning businesses</p>
<p>and they regulate some of their income.</p>
<p>So they become part of the local economy in a big way.</p>
<p>I had this experience in Sinaloa</p>
<p>where we were driving down this shitty street</p>
<p>and all of a sudden it became a cool, nice,</p>
<p>you know, little curvy highway type thing.</p>
<p>And I looked around there, it&rsquo;s like, this is a nice road.</p>
<p>And the guy was with me, he said,</p>
<p>yeah, the cartels built it.</p>
<p>You go to some of these towns</p>
<p>and the cartels are the government there.</p>
<p>They build the hospitals, they built the churches,</p>
<p>they built the schools.</p>
<p>COVID happens, they&rsquo;re enforcing the mask mandates,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re out enforcing the mask mandates,</p>
<p>the stay at home policies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones delivering supplies</p>
<p>to the townspeople in bags, you know,</p>
<p>courtesy of so-and-so cartel, you know.</p>
<p>So they become the Robin Hood characters</p>
<p>of their environments.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re smart, you know,</p>
<p>these groups basically turn into that, you know,</p>
<p>Robin Hood, you know,</p>
<p>stealing from the rich and giving to the poor,</p>
<p>or at least that&rsquo;s the projection that they give.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of violence in this operation?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extreme, you know,</p>
<p>it used to be that there were rules, as you say,</p>
<p>like, you know, don&rsquo;t go after kids, don&rsquo;t go after women,</p>
<p>but all those things are gone now.</p>
<p>You know, they had been gone for decades, I think.</p>
<p>The escalation of violence, you know,</p>
<p>you kill one of mine, I&rsquo;ll kill four of yours,</p>
<p>you kill four of mine, I&rsquo;ll go after your family</p>
<p>because you were in hiding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stories of high-level cartel people</p>
<p>getting their sons and daughters, you know,</p>
<p>murdered, mutilated in revenge killings.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s at a point where it&rsquo;s spiraled out</p>
<p>of semblance of a rule set as far as who can get exposed</p>
<p>to some of this violence.</p>
<p>Those highly-produced ISIS videos</p>
<p>where they show torture and executions,</p>
<p>according to some of the sources that I&rsquo;ve talked to,</p>
<p>here in the United States,</p>
<p>that were looking at that phenomenon,</p>
<p>they said that it seems to be that that was influenced</p>
<p>by some of the narco blog videos</p>
<p>that were coming out of Mexico in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Basically, that some of these groups</p>
<p>were the first ones that got wind of the fact</p>
<p>that you can export terror or the horror</p>
<p>that an execution has through social media.</p>
<p>Way back when Facebook was a bit more,</p>
<p>a bit more of a wildland area,</p>
<p>you could see these in newsfeeds,</p>
<p>videos of executions, tortures, and stuff like that</p>
<p>coming out of Mexico.</p>
<p>On Facebook?</p>
<p>Way back when.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>This was a different time.</p>
<p>For people who criticize social media and the moderation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a tough job because the brutal world out there.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember seeing some of these ISIS videos</p>
<p>on Facebook way back when,</p>
<p>and they cracked down on all that.</p>
<p>But one that&rsquo;s kind of clear,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not gonna say where to find it,</p>
<p>but people out there might have seen it</p>
<p>because some of these videos get shared</p>
<p>through WhatsApp groups and chat groups out there.</p>
<p>One of the ones that caught my attention way back when</p>
<p>was a guy getting, two guys getting executed by a chainsaw.</p>
<p>And people can kind of imagine what that would be like,</p>
<p>but-</p>
<p>This is produced on purpose?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s videotaped on purpose?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cartel group, two rival cartel members.</p>
<p>And a way to send a message to those of the rival cartel</p>
<p>is to basically execute these people in front of a camera.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t get to your rivals,</p>
<p>but you can make them see what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>or at least make their people look at what happens</p>
<p>if you invade their territory.</p>
<p>Just an escalation of brutality and the violence as well.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>And that leads to terror</p>
<p>and the mass communication of terror.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you have videos of some of these people</p>
<p>engaging in cannibalism in front of a video</p>
<p>to see how brutal they are,</p>
<p>or people taking out somebody&rsquo;s heart while they&rsquo;re alive</p>
<p>and filming it.</p>
<p>And it used to be social media as a whole,</p>
<p>you would see some of these videos,</p>
<p>they would get put down in a few days.</p>
<p>But now there&rsquo;s telegram groups, there&rsquo;s LiveLeaks,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of other sites out there</p>
<p>that kind of disperse some of these videos.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically a bulletin board for them</p>
<p>as far as, hey, you got into my territory,</p>
<p>well, this is what&rsquo;s gonna happen to you.</p>
<p>Is there a game theoretic way to remove</p>
<p>this kind of brutality, to deescalate the brutality?</p>
<p>Because it seems like if a cartel takes power</p>
<p>that exceeds the power of politicians in a locality,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a strong incentive to reduce the brutality,</p>
<p>to crack down on this kind of chainsaw executions.</p>
<p>You know, there was a recent leak of government files,</p>
<p>called the Guacamaya leaks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our version of WikiLeaks, I guess.</p>
<p>And it was mostly documents</p>
<p>coming out of the Mexican military.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen it talked about a lot here in stateside,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a pretty big thing down in Mexico.</p>
<p>And in some of those documents,</p>
<p>it reveals how powerless the government is.</p>
<p>I mean, as far as the military goes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another player in Mexico, the military.</p>
<p>The military has been out in force in the streets,</p>
<p>basically doing a policing role</p>
<p>since Felipe Calderon was the administration.</p>
<p>He basically militarized the drug war.</p>
<p>Felipe Calderon was to the right of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>And his main rival, who was way to the left,</p>
<p>is now in power.</p>
<p>And one of the campaign promises he had</p>
<p>was to demilitarize the drug war,</p>
<p>to send the military back to its barracks and all that.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s basically continuing on.</p>
<p>They just passed some legislation</p>
<p>that basically keeps the military on the streets</p>
<p>for a few more years, you know?</p>
<p>And I think some of these documents that were leaked</p>
<p>are very telling as far as why that is.</p>
<p>They have, the military now has a vast amount of power</p>
<p>when it comes to security industry.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re in charge of building airports</p>
<p>and train lines in Mexico now.</p>
<p>Their documents themselves show how certain regions</p>
<p>in Mexico who have a specific military presence</p>
<p>work for one side or favor one side of the cartel.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re corrupted too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these military forces</p>
<p>that are in part corrupted.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then the cartel, which operates with violence,</p>
<p>somehow finding a balance between each other.</p>
<p>It just feels like throughout human history,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s dictators or leaders that come</p>
<p>into situations like this</p>
<p>and really crack down on the violence.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it seems like that&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a kind of</p>
<p>market of violence happening here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a systemic amnesia that happens</p>
<p>every presidency in Mexico.</p>
<p>So the president comes in,</p>
<p>he has five to six years to do whatever he needs to do,</p>
<p>and he does everything.</p>
<p>And as soon as he&rsquo;s gone,</p>
<p>everything he did, even what was working,</p>
<p>gets chopped off.</p>
<p>Police organizations get defunct</p>
<p>or their names get changed.</p>
<p>Uniforms change.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of turnover everywhere?</p>
<p>Every five years federally, there&rsquo;s a turnover</p>
<p>and things change.</p>
<p>What about the cartels?</p>
<p>Do they persist?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do the leadership persist?</p>
<p>I mean, the Sinaloa cartel has had a figurehead</p>
<p>behind it since the 80s, the same one.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a federation of smaller cartels</p>
<p>that are all kind of linked up,</p>
<p>but pretty much historically,</p>
<p>he was considered the head of the Sinaloa cartel.</p>
<p>Elmira Zambada has been there since the 80s.</p>
<p>So in a way, yeah, he&rsquo;s persisting.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s surviving all of these presidencies.</p>
<p>Again, these documents that were leaked</p>
<p>are a clear sign of what strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p>there are as far as the government&rsquo;s main weapon</p>
<p>against some of these criminal groups,</p>
<p>which is the military.</p>
<p>And if people doubt this,</p>
<p>they can look it up now online</p>
<p>because all these documents are out there.</p>
<p>But just a clear thing,</p>
<p>the Mexican Navy or the Marina</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work with the Mexican army.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t speak to each other.</p>
<p>So that should tell you everything you need to know</p>
<p>as far as trust.</p>
<p>That could be just bureaucratic dysfunction.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t trust each other.</p>
<p>Are they both struggling with the problem of corruption?</p>
<p>Some of these documents that are already out there</p>
<p>talk about the ports in Mexico,</p>
<p>which are probably the main conduit</p>
<p>of precursors of methamphetamines</p>
<p>and precursors of things like fentanyl into the country.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re operated and guarded by the Marina, right?</p>
<p>So these things are happening under their watch.</p>
<p>And then you get talk about the army in certain places,</p>
<p>basically working counter cartel operations</p>
<p>to specifically one side, not another,</p>
<p>as far as the rival groups out there.</p>
<p>And we have a long history of some of these groups going,</p>
<p>military groups going rogue.</p>
<p>Los Zetas are a prime example of this.</p>
<p>These special forces units that basically turned around</p>
<p>and went to work as bodyguards for the Gulf cartel</p>
<p>and then decided to,</p>
<p>but what they basically did</p>
<p>was an internship with a cartel.</p>
<p>They went out there,</p>
<p>did bodyguarding for the Gulf cartel</p>
<p>and then realized they can do a better job</p>
<p>than they were doing.</p>
<p>So they started their own,</p>
<p>sparking off one of the, again,</p>
<p>one of the bloodiest kind of like internal cartel wars</p>
<p>in Mexico&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Who was El Chapo?</p>
<p>El Chapo was a part of the leadership</p>
<p>or at least a faction of the leadership in the cartel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a federation of different, of small organizations.</p>
<p>Well, I say small organizations,</p>
<p>basically families or organizations</p>
<p>that conform this larger group,</p>
<p>which is the Sinaloa cartel that is based out of Sinaloa.</p>
<p>Basically, they are people that have a family</p>
<p>and power nucleus is there in Sinaloa.</p>
<p>I mean, who was he?</p>
<p>I think he was a high level operator</p>
<p>for the Sinaloa cartel.</p>
<p>He had his own drug routes, his own networks,</p>
<p>his family nucleus down there</p>
<p>is still in control of some of those operations.</p>
<p>So his arrest really didn&rsquo;t change anything,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t the mastermind, number one leader</p>
<p>that I think the media and the government</p>
<p>kind of portrayed him as.</p>
<p>Who was the mastermind?</p>
<p>If you go down there and you read</p>
<p>what most of the brave journalists in Mexico that we have,</p>
<p>say another aspect of this war</p>
<p>is that a lot of journalists get killed.</p>
<p>I think Mexico has,</p>
<p>I think has some of the top numbers in the world.</p>
<p>And this is no secret to anybody.</p>
<p>El Mayo Zambada is the name of the historical figurehead</p>
<p>of this cartel,</p>
<p>or at least somebody who people theorize</p>
<p>or suspect to be the main guy</p>
<p>or the main person that is in charge</p>
<p>of some of this criminal group.</p>
<p>Is he still alive?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the going rumor that he&rsquo;s still very much alive.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing about him</p>
<p>is that he learned his craft in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>So people thinking that Sinaloa cartel</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a Mexican thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, he apparently learned a lot of his craft</p>
<p>from people in the United States.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the craft of leadership,</p>
<p>the craft of business, the craft of which aspect of the craft?</p>
<p>The craft of getting a product from Colombia,</p>
<p>putting it through Mexico.</p>
<p>And the logistics.</p>
<p>The logistics part of it.</p>
<p>And he somehow is operating in the shadows.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not a known entity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a clear number of this,</p>
<p>but he was interviewed by a magazine called Proceso</p>
<p>in Mexico.</p>
<p>And some pictures were taken of him.</p>
<p>It was over 10 years ago, probably.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the last time anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever seen a picture of him.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like to be a journalist in that?</p>
<p>So can a journalist have a conversation with him and live?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he asks to have that conversation.</p>
<p>I think he reached out to this journalist to talk about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a media wing to the work that we do,</p>
<p>a sister page called Demoler.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s run by some pretty good people.</p>
<p>And the way we met is that I was basically training them</p>
<p>how to work in hostile environments.</p>
<p>And they were like,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re gonna go report on cartel activity in Mexico.</p>
<p>And I was like, you know, that is a year and a half ago,</p>
<p>a reporter went to the president&rsquo;s daily briefing,</p>
<p>press conference that he has.</p>
<p>They call them La Ma√±aneras.</p>
<p>President, the president, Manuel Lopez Obrador,</p>
<p>and told him to his face, like,</p>
<p>I have threats on my life.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to kill me.</p>
<p>And it happened.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a slew of assassinations and murders</p>
<p>of members of the press all over Mexico.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an easy job.</p>
<p>Either they say too much,</p>
<p>or they say things that favor one side or the other,</p>
<p>which is another aspect of it that is interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself a reporter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t report on the news in Mexico.</p>
<p>I have friends that do that very well.</p>
<p>I commentate on some of it only.</p>
<p>But you see a lot of these cartel reporters go down there,</p>
<p>talk to a specific side,</p>
<p>and basically speak one side of the story.</p>
<p>And that is not something that the other side wants.</p>
<p>You know, if you go down there and speak to one side,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying what they want people to know or hear.</p>
<p>So in a way, you&rsquo;re kind of spreading</p>
<p>some of their cartel propaganda in a way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how some people, you know, get shot.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to go in there</p>
<p>and have a conversation with a cartel leader?</p>
<p>With Sean Penn?</p>
<p>Or somebody like me, or somebody like Sean Penn?</p>
<p>This is what I will say.</p>
<p>After that whole Sean Penn thing,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people would reconsider</p>
<p>meeting with anybody of any level</p>
<p>that has any notoriety here in the United States.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t trust anybody to get that close.</p>
<p>There are people out there that will talk to reporters,</p>
<p>you know, people that are working on a laboratory</p>
<p>somewhere in a hillside somewhere down south,</p>
<p>you know, in the Sierra.</p>
<p>You know, low-level people that get authorization</p>
<p>to speak to reporters and stuff like that,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t say anything that isn&rsquo;t being taught</p>
<p>or shown in various different ways</p>
<p>or outlets out there for them.</p>
<p>I mean, some of these guys have Instagram accounts,</p>
<p>you know, some of these guys have blog about it.</p>
<p>But not the leaders.</p>
<p>TikTok, no, not the leaders.</p>
<p>I think after what happened to El Chapo Guzman,</p>
<p>I think that opportunity, that window was closed</p>
<p>for some of the leadership down there.</p>
<p>I think, I disagree.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re just more sensitive,</p>
<p>realizing that there has to be a deep trust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just anybody and not any high profile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to speak to some very high profile</p>
<p>leaders that don&rsquo;t speak to journalists</p>
<p>and they understand the value of trust.</p>
<p>If they have something to say,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think they do, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they, unless at some point in the future,</p>
<p>which is something I suspect might be coming,</p>
<p>that there is some sort of armed intervention</p>
<p>and or external attack on some of these criminal groups</p>
<p>that really puts the pressure on them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a human aspect to this,</p>
<p>of a human being wanting their story to be known?</p>
<p>Versus, is this different than the propaganda machine</p>
<p>of I have something to say,</p>
<p>I have some message to put out there</p>
<p>to play the game of politics and power</p>
<p>and money and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there also a human being underneath all that armor</p>
<p>that for the sake of perhaps ego,</p>
<p>legacy wants to be understood?</p>
<p>I think in a way they already do that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s corridos, which are basically Mexican folk songs</p>
<p>that get sung about some of them.</p>
<p>So in a way, some of these singers</p>
<p>are reporting on some of their lives</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a great honor</p>
<p>to have a corrido made about you.</p>
<p>Somebody made a corrido about me</p>
<p>based on my interviews, right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t pay for it, so it&rsquo;s a real one.</p>
<p>It feels cool.</p>
<p>So creating a myth, the legend of the man.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s about, I think a way</p>
<p>you can find somebody like that</p>
<p>is somebody that wants to get their story</p>
<p>specifically clear and straight.</p>
<p>Coming from that culture</p>
<p>and getting to work for the government down there</p>
<p>and then not working for the government down there</p>
<p>and being on the outside, being critical</p>
<p>of not only the government that is in place now,</p>
<p>but also the government that I actually work with.</p>
<p>I can tell you that there&rsquo;s villains</p>
<p>all over the place down there.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s a villain at all levels</p>
<p>in some way, shape or form.</p>
<p>And some of these people, I think in a way,</p>
<p>including El Chapo, I think that some of that meeting</p>
<p>was about film rights and stories</p>
<p>and being able to get his story out there.</p>
<p>I think, I&rsquo;m not too sure because I wasn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>but I suspect that some of that was going on.</p>
<p>If you can bring an honest voice down there,</p>
<p>they can trust to put that out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think you could try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in that kind of thing</p>
<p>because ultimately in some of those places,</p>
<p>like inside a cartel at the very top</p>
<p>is when you can really look at the raw aspects</p>
<p>of human nature in a way you can&rsquo;t necessarily elsewhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a youth coming into power down there.</p>
<p>And when I say youth, I mean,</p>
<p>some of the old guard is going out</p>
<p>and some of the new guard is coming in.</p>
<p>An example of this is El Chapo Guzman&rsquo;s sons</p>
<p>who are now in their own right,</p>
<p>kind of gaining legendary status.</p>
<p>There was an attempted arrest on his son</p>
<p>that led to the famous Culiacanazo incident,</p>
<p>which we are now learning more about</p>
<p>because some of the Guacamaya leaks</p>
<p>are kind of speaking more about what happened that day.</p>
<p>Basically a federal operation,</p>
<p>they say to arrest El Chapo Guzman&rsquo;s son,</p>
<p>turned into a siege to try and get him free.</p>
<p>They called in the Calvary,</p>
<p>basically the whole of the Sinaloa cartel</p>
<p>showed up to try and rescue him.</p>
<p>Interesting thing about that is</p>
<p>in reading some of the documents</p>
<p>and also just seeing some of the videos</p>
<p>and stuff like that came out of that incident.</p>
<p>The cartels were the ones evacuating</p>
<p>the citizenship from the area.</p>
<p>They were the ones going restaurant to restaurant</p>
<p>saying, hey, if you want to exit the city,</p>
<p>go through here, take your families, get down,</p>
<p>but you have to leave because the army&rsquo;s coming here</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna fight us.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a deep morality to all of that.</p>
<p>Underneath the violence, there&rsquo;s a humanity.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s their home.</p>
<p>It is their home.</p>
<p>And they were fighting for their home</p>
<p>and they were fighting for leadership from their home.</p>
<p>There is a morality, there is a humanity there.</p>
<p>And again, if people want to paint them all</p>
<p>with the villainy aspects,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s a villain in somebody else&rsquo;s story,</p>
<p>if you kind of look at it that way.</p>
<p>People should check out your Patreon,</p>
<p>check out your field notes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a really good writer, your Instagram too.</p>
<p>You write about, you have a quote</p>
<p>in your field notes about villains.</p>
<p>Quote, I once worked for a villain,</p>
<p>a savior to some and a biblical demon of old to others,</p>
<p>a true product of his environment.</p>
<p>He was the best and the worst of us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all potential villains in someone else&rsquo;s story,</p>
<p>he would say to us as we would head out into the unknowns</p>
<p>that the night had waiting for us.</p>
<p>It was during one of these nights that I looked around me</p>
<p>and saw horns and pitchforks among my people</p>
<p>and realized what he meant.</p>
<p>We were no knights of the round table,</p>
<p>whatever we were, we were needed.</p>
<p>In the end, I guess that justified</p>
<p>most of what was about to happen.</p>
<p>Do you think El Chapo, do you think people like him</p>
<p>are good or evil?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no one without the other.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a cost to their goodness that they do,</p>
<p>the roads they build, the hospitals,</p>
<p>the career paths that they pay for.</p>
<p>There are doctors in Mexico that their careers were paid for</p>
<p>by some of these groups.</p>
<p>And they do a lot of amazing good for the community.</p>
<p>I remember there was a surgeon reconstructing cleft palates.</p>
<p>In one of my travels that I did out there,</p>
<p>I spent some time actually going out there</p>
<p>after I got out of the job to train people</p>
<p>and the type of stuff that I show people.</p>
<p>And they told me like, I told them like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>This stuff is like legit, this is God&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>building smiles for people.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>And then can I talk to you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He said, my career path was paid for by cartel,</p>
<p>a group of cartel members.</p>
<p>They paid for my career path</p>
<p>because they wanted somebody on hand</p>
<p>that could fix their teeth.</p>
<p>Do you think some aspect of that</p>
<p>is just sort of manipulative control</p>
<p>or is some of it also just, again,</p>
<p>a care for the population, for fellow human beings</p>
<p>that are one of your own?</p>
<p>I think both.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, again, it&rsquo;s hard to just make them saints</p>
<p>or devils, some of the good they do</p>
<p>in some of their communities</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t ask anything for in return.</p>
<p>And even if they don&rsquo;t ask it for anything in return</p>
<p>where the military shows up,</p>
<p>they are immediately met with rocks and roadblocks</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s main weapon down there,</p>
<p>since most Mexicans can&rsquo;t buy or own firearms,</p>
<p>the main weapon down there is silence and their eyes</p>
<p>to report to the people that they consider the good guys</p>
<p>in their environment, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a hard question.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a bit of both</p>
<p>and both the government and the criminal groups</p>
<p>that are operating down there.</p>
<p>Silence is their main weapon.</p>
<p>So El Chapo is currently in prison.</p>
<p>Is he worth talking to?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say yes.</p>
<p>Is there things that to you are interesting about him</p>
<p>that are still not understood?</p>
<p>Is he a window into something that you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>about that world still or are curious about in that world?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a window into the family dynamics</p>
<p>of that world.</p>
<p>When I say family dynamics,</p>
<p>Mexico has a big thing about compadres and hermanos.</p>
<p>We have people that we call family</p>
<p>that are not necessarily our family.</p>
<p>He is somebody that witnessed the construction</p>
<p>of what is now the Sinaloa cartel.</p>
<p>He was in it way back when.</p>
<p>He started off as a farmer and then went into trafficking.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s from a town called Bandera Huata,</p>
<p>which is basically, that&rsquo;s the Wakanda of cartels.</p>
<p>Basically, that&rsquo;s where a lot of that originates.</p>
<p>The things that he saw as far as how</p>
<p>some of these things got built,</p>
<p>I think would be an interesting topic of conversation</p>
<p>with somebody like him.</p>
<p>So that story is a story of evolving family dynamics.</p>
<p>So part of the story of the cartel is individual humans.</p>
<p>Marrying other families, getting named padrino,</p>
<p>basically godfathers to other people&rsquo;s kids.</p>
<p>Forming family and blood ties and influence ties</p>
<p>to people not only in Mexico but in the United States.</p>
<p>How that dynamic and family dynamic is still there.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s gone, he&rsquo;s in prison,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s probably on his way</p>
<p>to be our next clandestine saint.</p>
<p>You go to the Chapel of Malverde.</p>
<p>Malverde is basically a Mexican Robin Hood folk saint</p>
<p>down there who is a saint of traffickers.</p>
<p>And at his shrine, you have a small little chapel,</p>
<p>a shrine right next to it.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s on his way to sainthood in Mexico.</p>
<p>You know, not recognized by the Catholic church,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t matter in Mexico anymore.</p>
<p>Speaking to somebody like him,</p>
<p>who you can consider him somebody that lost,</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;s arrested, but his family&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>His legacy is out there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna be named, he&rsquo;s probably gonna be</p>
<p>the next folk saint when he passes away.</p>
<p>Do you think he feels like the new wave</p>
<p>of what the cartel has become has betrayed him</p>
<p>and left him behind?</p>
<p>Or, because it seems like the way the cartel operated</p>
<p>has changed over the decades.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, number one, their power and influence is bigger.</p>
<p>You know, there are Sinaloa cartel operations in Columbia,</p>
<p>straight to the, like in the source of it.</p>
<p>And then there are clear, they have a clear presence</p>
<p>in places like Chicago and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the United States.</p>
<p>The whole thought process that a lot of Americans have,</p>
<p>like, oh, we don&rsquo;t want that trouble over here.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want them to get here,</p>
<p>like build the wall and all this.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re deeply integrated into legitimate businesses.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve been having kids and families up here</p>
<p>since for a long time.</p>
<p>Some of these people have American passports</p>
<p>that work not only directly for them,</p>
<p>but have blood ties down there.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s been dragnets and arrests</p>
<p>of some of these criminal organizations.</p>
<p>In the United States, a new generation cartel</p>
<p>had one, two, three years ago,</p>
<p>where I think it was Operation Anaconda,</p>
<p>I think it was called.</p>
<p>They arrested over 80 of their operatives.</p>
<p>And this is a new cartel that is very militaristic</p>
<p>and growing in Mexico.</p>
<p>And they had over 80 arrests in the United States,</p>
<p>you know, of members of them operating here.</p>
<p>And so you could be a legitimate operator</p>
<p>inside the United States.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard to detect.</p>
<p>Makes you wonder how many in the U.S. government,</p>
<p>the politicians here.</p>
<p>The role of the United States in the drug war,</p>
<p>financially in terms of power, is very big.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Surely there&rsquo;s politicians that have a finger into this.</p>
<p>Immigration is part of it.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration is part of it.</p>
<p>And the influence that that has</p>
<p>as a bargaining chip and a political chip.</p>
<p>We saw this with the first caravan kind of coming up</p>
<p>and how it was politicized.</p>
<p>The money, Fast and Furious,</p>
<p>and guns being basically let walk down into Mexico.</p>
<p>People that don&rsquo;t know, basically,</p>
<p>the ATF had this operation where they were</p>
<p>looking at straw purchasers of firearms.</p>
<p>Basically people buying up a specific type of firearms</p>
<p>that were on a shopping list that the cartels wanted to buy.</p>
<p>Including, you know, 50 cals, FN-57 pistols,</p>
<p>which are small pistols with a high velocity round</p>
<p>that will go through a bulletproof vest.</p>
<p>AR-15s of all kinds that could quickly be modified</p>
<p>into full auto down in Mexico.</p>
<p>With drilling a few holes and making a few things to them.</p>
<p>So these people were buying all these,</p>
<p>the ATF was watching them,</p>
<p>and allowing them to walk those firearms into Mexico</p>
<p>under the guise of trying to track them somehow.</p>
<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense for most people</p>
<p>that kind of look at that operation.</p>
<p>The only reason people found out about it was</p>
<p>because of the murder of a few federal agents,</p>
<p>of the U.S. federal agents that were killed with those guns.</p>
<p>One of my friends was shot with one of those pistols</p>
<p>outside of his house.</p>
<p>And they shot him and they shot his wife.</p>
<p>Both of them were killed.</p>
<p>Daughter was in the backseat, lost part of her arm.</p>
<p>When that happened, the guns were unique.</p>
<p>They were like, oh, we didn&rsquo;t ever,</p>
<p>the mata policias is what they call them down there,</p>
<p>the cop killers.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t seen those before.</p>
<p>So they were unique and interesting.</p>
<p>Later on in life, I was watching CNN</p>
<p>and seeing the hearings going on.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s where they came from.</p>
<p>Two federal agents changed a lot and it was politicized.</p>
<p>There was a whole scandal up here.</p>
<p>But in Mexico, how many people died with those firearms?</p>
<p>Being let down, being let go down there.</p>
<p>And also what type of sentiment</p>
<p>do you think the local populace has of the United States</p>
<p>after all those guns were basically handed over</p>
<p>to some of these groups?</p>
<p>Gun trafficking is another giant part of the equation</p>
<p>and part of the problem down there</p>
<p>as far as the amount of munitions, weapons.</p>
<p>And now we were also getting tradecraft material</p>
<p>from conflict zones outside of Mexico.</p>
<p>So weaponized drones.</p>
<p>The first time we saw some of those weaponized drones</p>
<p>was in Syria.</p>
<p>And like a few weeks later,</p>
<p>grenades were being dropped on the roofs</p>
<p>of some public officials&rsquo; building.</p>
<p>The cartels are using drones?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s been going on for a while.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a place in Michoacan</p>
<p>that has some pretty interesting videos.</p>
<p>And the interesting part of it</p>
<p>is because the federal police down there</p>
<p>are actually working hand in hand</p>
<p>with a United Carteles Unidos group,</p>
<p>which is basically the local cartels</p>
<p>to try and fight off the New Generation Cartel</p>
<p>moving into Michoacan.</p>
<p>So even the federal forces</p>
<p>are fighting with the cartels</p>
<p>to try and keep this larger cartel out.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s videos of these civilian drones</p>
<p>basically dropping explosives.</p>
<p>They found some explosive testing ranges out there</p>
<p>that are basically replicating stuff</p>
<p>that you would see the IRA use</p>
<p>during the troubles out there from homemade mortars.</p>
<p>You know, IEDs have been used in Mexico.</p>
<p>Not that much, but they&rsquo;re making like a presence again.</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t have a lot of ordnance around like Iraq,</p>
<p>but we do have a big mining industry down there.</p>
<p>So mining explosives of all kinds are pretty easy to get.</p>
<p>So you start seeing that.</p>
<p>And also, I mean, there&rsquo;s some exotic weaponry</p>
<p>coming in from the South now and from the ocean.</p>
<p>Some of it is probably US military equipment</p>
<p>sold to various South American governments</p>
<p>that are now not as stable as they were,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of making their way into black markets.</p>
<p>So a lot of those 50 cal</p>
<p>and vehicle mounted technical type machine guns</p>
<p>and some of the RPGs and MANPADs</p>
<p>or remote control guided missiles</p>
<p>that have been found in cartel hands</p>
<p>are probably making their way up from down South.</p>
<p>Do you get these like multimillion dollar systems</p>
<p>like the HIMAR system in the Ukraine?</p>
<p>You get like super sophisticated advanced technology</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re not, so like this is like military grade.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the application</p>
<p>would be exactly in Mexico.</p>
<p>Some of the sophisticated stuff I see in our MANPADs,</p>
<p>which is basically remote guided missiles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some of those found down there.</p>
<p>What is the application exactly?</p>
<p>A display of power?</p>
<p>There are no flight zones over parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>For this reason.</p>
<p>The New Generation Cartel took down a helicopter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been incidents of military helicopters</p>
<p>falling from the sky,</p>
<p>and they said that it was mechanical issues.</p>
<p>But again, I&rsquo;m not gonna do conspiracy theories out there,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of videos on TikTok</p>
<p>of Sinaloa cartel forces at parties</p>
<p>carrying around rocket launchers on their backs.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an increased probability of mechanical failures</p>
<p>over those areas when you&rsquo;re flying a helicopter.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no flight zones over some parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>And another thing you&rsquo;re seeing now is night vision,</p>
<p>night vision equipment that is clearly military grade</p>
<p>from the US that was probably abandoned</p>
<p>in some war field out there,</p>
<p>maybe Afghanistan or somewhere like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s being found in safe houses</p>
<p>and in the hands of cartel forces.</p>
<p>You wanna talk about a scary opponent.</p>
<p>Somebody wearing night vision with a suppressed firearm.</p>
<p>Those types of capabilities are now out there.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s this tendency to think,</p>
<p>and every now and then you&rsquo;ll see these cartel videos</p>
<p>with these guys carrying around these 50 cals,</p>
<p>and they show up, they stand there like,</p>
<p>you know, boasting about their rifles.</p>
<p>And everybody laughed at them</p>
<p>because the 50 cal or anything like that</p>
<p>without an optic on it, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re gonna shoot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re praying shoot basically</p>
<p>to see if you can hit anything with it.</p>
<p>But now there&rsquo;s a few of my sources</p>
<p>of seeing, you know, sophisticated laser guided range finders</p>
<p>and sighting systems on some of these</p>
<p>that are being found out there.</p>
<p>How much damage can 50 cal, what&rsquo;s the application?</p>
<p>They started getting them specifically</p>
<p>with the proliferation of armored vehicles in Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexico has a giant industry in armored vehicles as far as.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a race in terms of armoring,</p>
<p>like protecting especially high value targets,</p>
<p>and then weapons that can deal with those armored,</p>
<p>the protected high value targets.</p>
<p>There was an attempted assassination</p>
<p>of a state prosecutor somewhere in, I think,</p>
<p>Central Mexico, I forget exactly where,</p>
<p>but she was riding around an up armored Jeep,</p>
<p>Cherokee, I think it was.</p>
<p>And their main means of firepower was 50 cals.</p>
<p>And that car was left in pieces.</p>
<p>He survived in it.</p>
<p>So I think the armored vehicle company that sold her</p>
<p>that vehicle has it in the display room.</p>
<p>Then before my time, probably two, three years</p>
<p>before I was actually active,</p>
<p>they tried to kill the head of public security</p>
<p>in the state of Baja.</p>
<p>And with him, it was a grenade launcher,</p>
<p>40 millimeter grenade launcher.</p>
<p>It skipped off the armored vehicle</p>
<p>and landed in the car behind it, made the back explode.</p>
<p>One of the guys that I used to work with</p>
<p>was actually in that car, he survived it.</p>
<p>But you started to see, oh, they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>armored vehicles now, so let&rsquo;s get 50 caliber</p>
<p>now to try and defeat that armor.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s always this race of technology</p>
<p>basically down there.</p>
<p>Armored vehicles, how do you take on an armored vehicle?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a few ways.</p>
<p>50 cals, if you can mount them in the right way</p>
<p>and shoot at a car like that,</p>
<p>or a bunch of kids with balloons and acrylic paint</p>
<p>on the front windshield and blind the vehicle</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t, so they can&rsquo;t drive it anymore</p>
<p>is another way.</p>
<p>Toe line across a road, painted black so you can&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>and cut the thing in half.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying any secrets.</p>
<p>These are things that people have seen out there.</p>
<p>Shoot at the radiator.</p>
<p>Some of these radiators are not,</p>
<p>even the more sophisticated vehicles out there</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a sufficient armoring around the radiator</p>
<p>or the battery housing of some of these vehicles.</p>
<p>There was a case of a guy,</p>
<p>I think his nickname was El Pela Lacas</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t see a lower level cartel guy.</p>
<p>He had an armored vehicle.</p>
<p>He was riding around and he got ambushed.</p>
<p>He shot at his car.</p>
<p>He was like, ah, I have armor, you can&rsquo;t shoot me.</p>
<p>And somebody went up to his car</p>
<p>and just put the barrel right in the locking mechanism.</p>
<p>And that got him, you know?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting place</p>
<p>as far as people getting certain types of guns.</p>
<p>Armor is prolific down there.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody down there,</p>
<p>all the cartel members,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see them wearing plate armor.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you can shoot somebody square in the chest</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll go down.</p>
<p>Are they afraid to kill Americans?</p>
<p>So I know I was traveling in Ukraine on the front.</p>
<p>So like a lot of the journalists</p>
<p>would travel in like armored vehicles.</p>
<p>And at first I was like,</p>
<p>it seems like this would attract attention.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, it seems like they would want to hit those targets.</p>
<p>But then I realized over time, as I learned,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fear of killing Americans.</p>
<p>There could be a drastic escalation of-</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kicking a beehive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is a tendency to shy away</p>
<p>or stay away from that, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t want the heat or the attention.</p>
<p>Outside of that, everyone&rsquo;s game.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s game,</p>
<p>but also there&rsquo;s been many cases</p>
<p>of Americans being killed down there.</p>
<p>I mean, we saw the Mormon massacre that happened down there</p>
<p>and all of them were American, Mexican.</p>
<p>They had both nationalities and blonde kids, you know,</p>
<p>white, being massacred in the middle of a desert</p>
<p>and the cars basically catching fire.</p>
<p>This happened and, you know,</p>
<p>the Americans sent the FBI down there</p>
<p>to kind of review some of what happened down there.</p>
<p>And I think that was when Trump started talking</p>
<p>about kind of reviving this whole notion</p>
<p>of cartels being labor-related terrorist organization,</p>
<p>probably more of a political pressure point</p>
<p>he was using to try and get Mexico</p>
<p>to reinforce its southern border, which it hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s escalation, you know?</p>
<p>Oh, this already happened and nothing happened,</p>
<p>so we can probably get away with it, you know?</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s a newer generation moving forward now</p>
<p>of people coming into power.</p>
<p>More brutal, more technically savvy.</p>
<p>Well, they have the experience of their parents</p>
<p>and the people behind them and what they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;ve gone away with.</p>
<p>And now, yeah, more savvy about information warfare.</p>
<p>Their main recruiting tool is TikTok.</p>
<p>You go to TikTok and you&rsquo;ll see a bunch of these kids</p>
<p>at a narco party dancing around</p>
<p>and some of these are videos by cartel members filming</p>
<p>other cartel members in cartel-controlled territory.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a window into that life</p>
<p>for who&rsquo;s on TikTok now, kids.</p>
<p>And the enticing aspect of that is the money,</p>
<p>the fun, the high-roller life.</p>
<p>And the possibility of making it to a level, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, a fame of respect, power, money.</p>
<p>Here in the US, somebody might, you know,</p>
<p>I want a mansion, that&rsquo;s their mindset.</p>
<p>I want to live, you know, like that rapper.</p>
<p>Down there, I mean, if you can buy a house for your mom,</p>
<p>you know, or pay off some debts that you might have</p>
<p>or a car, that&rsquo;s enough to kill for.</p>
<p>So you also, one of the many things you did</p>
<p>is you did security, tried to protect in this war,</p>
<p>tried to protect people, high-value people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do you do, you and others,</p>
<p>how is it possible to protect a high-value target</p>
<p>like a celebrity or an important politician</p>
<p>in this situation?</p>
<p>So I was tasked to protect the governor of Baja</p>
<p>and his family.</p>
<p>I was basically replacing a whole contingency</p>
<p>of people that were already there</p>
<p>that turned out to be corrupted.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t my field, that was operational.</p>
<p>I was working with other people</p>
<p>doing the counter-narcotic stuff</p>
<p>and the director of the institution that I was in</p>
<p>basically called me and said,</p>
<p>hey, you&rsquo;re gonna go and replace these people.</p>
<p>And I, what happened to them?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>So you were known as a person that could be kind of trusted.</p>
<p>I was tasked for that, so I think they considered that.</p>
<p>And I specifically worked for a governor named</p>
<p>Jose Guadalupe Osuna-Millan,</p>
<p>who was probably one of the best governors</p>
<p>we have had in the state.</p>
<p>And people wanna see if I&rsquo;m trustworthy or not,</p>
<p>they can ask him directly.</p>
<p>And I still speak to some members of his family</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still friends in that way.</p>
<p>Is protecting people like technically</p>
<p>a difficult problem to solve?</p>
<p>For my experience in that time and in place,</p>
<p>he was basically spearheading the drug war in Baja</p>
<p>when he was in power.</p>
<p>So he had threats from all over,</p>
<p>not only him, but his family.</p>
<p>First thing I realized working that job in Mexico</p>
<p>was that we had people coming in</p>
<p>to do specialized training of that regard,</p>
<p>Israelis, teaching us how they would do things in Israel.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense for us in Mexico.</p>
<p>We had people that had some Secret Service experience</p>
<p>kind of showing us how they would do like celebrity,</p>
<p>bodyguarding or bodyguarding somebody</p>
<p>maybe in California of that nature.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t make sense for us.</p>
<p>Then we got to experience some cross training</p>
<p>with NSW, Naval Special Warfare people</p>
<p>who were coming off protection details</p>
<p>in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>Is there some useful crossover there?</p>
<p>We were struggling with the acceptance</p>
<p>that we were basically doing protection details</p>
<p>in a war zone.</p>
<p>So the approach that had to be taken in Mexico</p>
<p>was similar to the approach you would take</p>
<p>in Afghanistan during a war.</p>
<p>Some of the overt militaristic type approaches</p>
<p>to security that we had to adopt,</p>
<p>from we didn&rsquo;t move him in a single armored vehicle.</p>
<p>We had two of them that looked exactly alike.</p>
<p>So when we would move around,</p>
<p>we would switch one car through the other every now</p>
<p>and then we would arrive to an event.</p>
<p>They would open the door and it would be one of us.</p>
<p>And they were like, hey, where&rsquo;s the governor?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in the back one.</p>
<p>So we would move to that.</p>
<p>So we had to do stuff like that.</p>
<p>And again, this is a young me</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t have any specialized training.</p>
<p>I was on YouTube learning some of these things,</p>
<p>going online, learning about armored vehicles,</p>
<p>learning about architectural armor.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve just described a large percentage</p>
<p>of the Ukrainian military, how they operate,</p>
<p>which is on YouTube,</p>
<p>trying to figure out how to use some of this technology.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually incredibly effective.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I do quite a lot of stuff</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m totally not an expert,</p>
<p>totally uneducated and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of surprising how quickly you can get caught up.</p>
<p>As we were talking offline, if you take a course,</p>
<p>if you talk to an expert, if you learn from an expert,</p>
<p>you can like catch up really quickly.</p>
<p>For me, it was all of a sudden,</p>
<p>I have this director calling me in</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m wearing Vans and jeans, T-shirt.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden I had 80 some people</p>
<p>that I had to move around</p>
<p>and I was in charge of securing planes,</p>
<p>and which I, what do I know about that?</p>
<p>Airport hangers, armored vehicle maintenance</p>
<p>and purchasing and figuring out how to set up</p>
<p>a counter assault group for a protection detail.</p>
<p>And I was like, where am I gonna learn all this?</p>
<p>Were you able to quickly figure some of these things out?</p>
<p>On the fly, basically, you know, as I was going,</p>
<p>I remember having this experience,</p>
<p>being in our security office on my laptop,</p>
<p>figuring out how to set up a counter surveillance</p>
<p>aside to our protection detail,</p>
<p>basically how to have people looking for people</p>
<p>that might be looking for us, you know, type thing.</p>
<p>And then going to San Diego, to Coronado</p>
<p>and training with some people from former SEAL guys</p>
<p>and NCIS people who did that job in war zones</p>
<p>and seeing them critique some of the solutions</p>
<p>that we came up with on the fly</p>
<p>and being like, oh, we never saw that before.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, this is, we&rsquo;re doing it down there.</p>
<p>So getting that compliment</p>
<p>and also getting their feedback.</p>
<p>We probably do this or do that.</p>
<p>And it was a learning process on the fly</p>
<p>that was pretty, I mean, seat of your pants level.</p>
<p>Is it possible for the family</p>
<p>and for the high value person to have a sense of normalcy,</p>
<p>to have a normal life?</p>
<p>I mean, I tried.</p>
<p>I was already starting off on the wrong foot, basically,</p>
<p>because trust had been violated</p>
<p>by the people that I was replacing.</p>
<p>So I had to gain that back.</p>
<p>Then young kids in that family that wanted to have a,</p>
<p>you know, go out and stuff like that.</p>
<p>In the most violent city on the planet.</p>
<p>So I had to do my homework</p>
<p>and figure out places where they were safe to go to</p>
<p>and make friends with certain club owners</p>
<p>and figure out ways to put security in some of these places.</p>
<p>And having to create this bubble of normalcy</p>
<p>around some of these people was pretty difficult.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no way that that is a normal for anybody.</p>
<p>And, you know, God bless them.</p>
<p>The, I know it didn&rsquo;t, I know it wasn&rsquo;t easy</p>
<p>and I know that it affected their lives</p>
<p>and they lost on a big part of their youth.</p>
<p>Being under that security supervision and bubble</p>
<p>does, probably does a lot for somebody specifically</p>
<p>growing up like that, you know.</p>
<p>You lose opportunities of things that we take for granted,</p>
<p>you know, just going out,</p>
<p>just not telling anybody and going to the store, you know.</p>
<p>Because you want to get some snacks or something like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not available to some of these people.</p>
<p>I have to be honest, when I was in Ukraine,</p>
<p>that was a really big benefit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d escape?</p>
<p>No, I couldn&rsquo;t hang out.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t eat when I&rsquo;m stressed.</p>
<p>I would fast and not eat much.</p>
<p>So I get lost weight.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s great, it&rsquo;s great for the diet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good diet to be in.</p>
<p>Basically be under protective custody.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good idea for a good, you know, new diet.</p>
<p>And just life, it allowed me to focus,</p>
<p>get a lot of reading done,</p>
<p>focus on the important things in life.</p>
<p>I mean, I joke, of course,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some complexity to this</p>
<p>in terms of normalcy of the family,</p>
<p>but also just how to operate,</p>
<p>like have a mental clarity and a lack of fear.</p>
<p>Just basically be good at your job,</p>
<p>whatever that job is.</p>
<p>As a politician, as a leader, even as a soldier.</p>
<p>Somebody that I, again, I think it was Lisa Ola,</p>
<p>she said this to me,</p>
<p>or said something like this to a group of us,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being paranoid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about educating your paranoia</p>
<p>and knowing what to be afraid of.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re afraid of everything, you&rsquo;re basically overwhelmed.</p>
<p>But if you start educating yourself</p>
<p>as far as specifically what to prioritize,</p>
<p>as far as what to worry about in a war zone,</p>
<p>working, protecting somebody,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not looking at everybody&rsquo;s faces,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just looking at their hands</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna kill you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example of focalizing what you&rsquo;re paranoid</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re afraid of.</p>
<p>Looking at the hands,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s specific to a particular situation,</p>
<p>but also figuring out which situations to avoid</p>
<p>and which is okay.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s ultimately</p>
<p>one of the biggest things you could do.</p>
<p>Route analysis, you have to get to the airport</p>
<p>and you send off two cars to analyze two routes,</p>
<p>and then on the fly, you just change trajectory</p>
<p>to create randomness and unpredictability</p>
<p>and have that as a security feature.</p>
<p>Having a convoy of four vehicles</p>
<p>separate into two convoys and show up in different parts</p>
<p>to, again, make it hard for people to guess</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna be,</p>
<p>putting out false information as far as where it&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna be, and that type of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of amazing how many assassination attempts</p>
<p>Hitler avoided just by having a pretty strict schedule</p>
<p>and being a little bit off in terms of timing,</p>
<p>just like showing up 15 minutes late</p>
<p>or to a slightly different location.</p>
<p>We were going through training</p>
<p>specifically around this type of stuff</p>
<p>and operational training,</p>
<p>basically showing us how to ambush people.</p>
<p>When I started making a group for myself</p>
<p>as far as counter-ambush,</p>
<p>this CAT teams, they call them up here in the US,</p>
<p>basically a group to respond to a high violent ambush.</p>
<p>First off, the first rule,</p>
<p>if you find yourself in an ambush,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a successful ambush</p>
<p>because if you find yourself in it, you&rsquo;re alive.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But if you wanna create an amazing counter-ambush team,</p>
<p>you have to make them ambushers.</p>
<p>And with ambushing, you figure out</p>
<p>where all the opportunities</p>
<p>of not only successfully doing what you need to do</p>
<p>are in your favor, but also to escape with your life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna be received by virgins in heaven.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the type of mentality that we had down there.</p>
<p>But we started learning about some of these things</p>
<p>and also seeing cartel forces</p>
<p>apply some of these ambush tactics</p>
<p>to the military or the federal forces.</p>
<p>What is an ambush?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a surprise attack</p>
<p>with an asymmetry of power kind of thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a contingency somewhere</p>
<p>moving towards a place that you control and own,</p>
<p>where you have the advantages,</p>
<p>where they can&rsquo;t see you, but you can see them,</p>
<p>where they can&rsquo;t predict you,</p>
<p>but you can predict where they&rsquo;re gonna pass, go through,</p>
<p>places where they forcibly have to pass,</p>
<p>places where they&rsquo;re predictable,</p>
<p>places where you can not only predict,</p>
<p>but also have a plan for yourself to escape</p>
<p>and exit that place.</p>
<p>So how do you train for counter ambush?</p>
<p>You turn into like a perfect ambusher.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you train for counter ambush.</p>
<p>Oh, so always trying to make sure</p>
<p>you have more information about other people,</p>
<p>you have the element of surprise, all of those things.</p>
<p>And Musashi would say,</p>
<p>you know, your enemy know his sword.</p>
<p>You know, basically that, you know, it&rsquo;s simplified.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of enemies around you in Mexico.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s, well, I guess that&rsquo;s what route analysis is.</p>
<p>Yeah, you prepare for the probable.</p>
<p>And if the impossible happens,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re halfway out of it, hopefully, you know?</p>
<p>And if you find yourself in an ambush,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a successful one.</p>
<p>But you, as far as our training</p>
<p>and kind of the mindset, my experience with it,</p>
<p>the adversarial thinking part of it</p>
<p>has always been a very powerful one.</p>
<p>And I think one that a lot of people ignore,</p>
<p>kind of like leave to the wayside,</p>
<p>specifically in all conflicts out there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tendency for a military force</p>
<p>or a conventional force of any kind</p>
<p>to be trained in a way where they dehumanize the enemy.</p>
<p>And when that happens,</p>
<p>you become blind to the enemy&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his capability, his story, his ability.</p>
<p>If you treat the other side like an inhuman monster,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to take notes, you know?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a part of this is a radical empathy</p>
<p>for the quote-unquote enemy.</p>
<p>At least for me personally,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t one of the guys that would grab them,</p>
<p>beat the shit out of them,</p>
<p>put them in the back of a van,</p>
<p>just tie them up and gag them.</p>
<p>So you were able to see them as human?</p>
<p>I learned that from my mother.</p>
<p>You know, she said,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s against you, Ed, they&rsquo;re for themselves.</p>
<p>Learn this and you will make friends of enemies.</p>
<p>She said that when I graduated</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve carried that with me throughout my whole career.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t there then a pain of killing another human?</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>But there isn&rsquo;t, again,</p>
<p>I apologize to go back to Ukraine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my only experience of this kind of harshness.</p>
<p>And it is a powerful experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dehumanization that happens.</p>
<p>I suppose this is common in war.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something like a video game aspect</p>
<p>where people are almost having fun.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a humor.</p>
<p>And I think underneath that,</p>
<p>the prerequisite is to see the enemy</p>
<p>in the same way you see the enemy</p>
<p>when you play Call of Duty.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really think,</p>
<p>you think of them as NPCs, the bad guys.</p>
<p>The Russians are called orcs in Ukraine.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all kinds of other names.</p>
<p>For us, it was mugrosos.</p>
<p>You know, malandros mugrosos, like dirty people.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s always something.</p>
<p>Over time, those are just words.</p>
<p>But over time, it gathers a kind of,</p>
<p>like a meaning to it that&rsquo;s more than just the words, orcs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re less than human.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dirty.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too dumb to understand the evil they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>or whatever the-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useful, it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s part of the program.</p>
<p>But like, that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked to soldiers,</p>
<p>and some of them do have stories of momentarily</p>
<p>remembering that there&rsquo;s a human on the other side.</p>
<p>I talked to one woman who&rsquo;s this really badass soldier.</p>
<p>She saw this really brave soldier on the other side</p>
<p>do something that was almost stupid, how brave it was.</p>
<p>And then she was trying to shoot him, and she missed.</p>
<p>And she said she couldn&rsquo;t sleep the night after,</p>
<p>thinking, why did she miss?</p>
<p>Why did she miss?</p>
<p>And then she thought she missed because he was a hero.</p>
<p>And she had this brief realization</p>
<p>that there was a hero on the other side.</p>
<p>The other side is heroes.</p>
<p>But then that quickly disappeared again.</p>
<p>But she had this moment,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a human being that rises to defend his nation,</p>
<p>to defend his people,</p>
<p>and he could be heroic on the other side.</p>
<p>There are things that we&rsquo;re trained to depress,</p>
<p>or conceal, or hide, and kill in us</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trained for something like that.</p>
<p>Or when you&rsquo;re in a conflict zone like that,</p>
<p>and you hear the narrative constantly being blared out</p>
<p>that the other side is a orc,</p>
<p>or whatever word you wanna use.</p>
<p>But we live in a day and age</p>
<p>when you can see Americans going off to Japan</p>
<p>and shaking hands with some of their former enemies.</p>
<p>I mean, some of us have seen that.</p>
<p>And how things change.</p>
<p>I think years from now,</p>
<p>a lot of the stuff that we are taking right now</p>
<p>is of the utmost importance, won&rsquo;t matter anymore.</p>
<p>The question is how many years?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question I ask of a lot of people</p>
<p>in that part of the world.</p>
<p>And a lot of them currently,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also self-aware about it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m not sure I trust my current feelings.</p>
<p>But the current feelings are generational.</p>
<p>Like for decades, I will not just hate the leadership,</p>
<p>I will hate all of Russian people.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t understand that on my side of my life experience,</p>
<p>because our war has been an internal war</p>
<p>amongst our people, amongst our houses.</p>
<p>While that is the propaganda,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a deep grain of truth</p>
<p>that there is a oneness to the people of that region.</p>
<p>But people will get very offended at that idea,</p>
<p>because right now it&rsquo;s a very strong nationalist borders.</p>
<p>But there is a cultural history that connects people.</p>
<p>I mean, in some deep sense, we&rsquo;re all connected.</p>
<p>We all come from Western Africa,</p>
<p>and then all came from fish before then,</p>
<p>depending on your view of history, of life on earth.</p>
<p>But there is a oneness to us,</p>
<p>and often you forget that in conflict.</p>
<p>I had an experience working.</p>
<p>There was a friend of mine who took the other path,</p>
<p>and went to work for some of these criminal groups.</p>
<p>I was operational, and I was,</p>
<p>we saw a bunch of people in a gas station, parked.</p>
<p>Back then, the main modus operandi that they had</p>
<p>was that they would impersonate</p>
<p>or dress up as federal police.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how they would move around the city.</p>
<p>We saw these suburbans in a gas station,</p>
<p>and some of the guys were carrying around AK-47s,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not a standard issue firearm.</p>
<p>So we saw that, and I got off on foot</p>
<p>and walked by to try and get a better sense</p>
<p>of what was going on.</p>
<p>I took everything off, wearing jeans and a T-shirt,</p>
<p>and I got a whistle from one of the guys that was there,</p>
<p>and my name was called.</p>
<p>It was one of the guys that I grew up with.</p>
<p>Redhead kid, looked like El Canelo, you know?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s redheads in Mexico, by the way.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably some of the Irish</p>
<p>that betrayed the American side</p>
<p>during the last Mexico-American War</p>
<p>that stayed down there, had a bunch of kids.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably from there.</p>
<p>Love is stronger than anything else, I think.</p>
<p>So this redhead kid, when I say kid,</p>
<p>I mean he was my age.</p>
<p>Now, to my eyes, he&rsquo;s always gonna be younger now.</p>
<p>He whistled, told my name, said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hey, cast a geek out on, like, what are you doing here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, shit, I&rsquo;m just, you know, going home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still going to get a taxi.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, okay,&rsquo; as he walks over.</p>
<p>He has a plate carrier with AK magazines on his chest,</p>
<p>AK without a stock on it, just carrying it in his hand.</p>
<p>He comes over and he hugs me.</p>
<p>I could feel the magazines on my chest.</p>
<p>Mind you, I have a gun on me, you know, tucked.</p>
<p>And next to him is buzzing in my back pocket</p>
<p>as people are trying to figure out what the fuck&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>He asked me, small talk shit, like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hey,&rsquo; he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;&lsquo;What are you doing?</p>
<p>Like, what do you work at?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m just looking for a job.</p>
<p>You know, I used to work at a video store.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a while.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s so-and-so of your family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How&rsquo;s so-and-so of your family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>this is an interesting job you have.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;&lsquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>They pay us well.</p>
<p>You know, you get a car, you know, there&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>And nobody fucks with you.</p>
<p>You get respect.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was like, that&rsquo;s awesome, you know?</p>
<p>And if you want, I can get you in.</p>
<p>You know, if you ever want that, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m too much of a coward for that, I told him.</p>
<p>Conversation like any other between two friends.</p>
<p>He hugs me before I go.</p>
<p>I said something to him, I can&rsquo;t remember what.</p>
<p>And he says, &ldquo;&lsquo;Hey,&rsquo; in my ear,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know what you do for a living.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a safe place for you to be in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I walk off.</p>
<p>A few moments later, the army showed up.</p>
<p>And you could feel the amount of rounds</p>
<p>going off from two blocks away.</p>
<p>We came back with our guys and it was over.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t survive that.</p>
<p>I looked through the bodies and the cars that were left.</p>
<p>You know, there was bodies all over the place.</p>
<p>People left there.</p>
<p>It was a mess.</p>
<p>I spent like an hour looking for him.</p>
<p>The only way I could recognize him was his hair.</p>
<p>I stayed with his body all night.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bridge in Tijuana that goes over the river</p>
<p>in a place called La Mesa.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the forensic offices were.</p>
<p>His body was taken there,</p>
<p>and I stayed with his body until it was released.</p>
<p>I told his family about it.</p>
<p>Because I knew them.</p>
<p>That aspect of, you know, us versus them,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re the enemy and shit like that.</p>
<p>You know, my mom told me those words.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s against you, they&rsquo;re just for themselves.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t make the mistake of dehumanizing anybody.</p>
<p>And those roles could have been easily reversed.</p>
<p>I could have been shot in the face there.</p>
<p>That aspect of conflict brings where, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>bad guys, good guys, you know, heroes, villains, you know.</p>
<p>I, there&rsquo;s an innocence to that that goes away.</p>
<p>Is your mom still with us?</p>
<p>No, almost three weeks before I decided to quit,</p>
<p>she passed away.</p>
<p>Did that have a role to play?</p>
<p>A major one.</p>
<p>After I got done on the protection detail with the governor,</p>
<p>like everything down there, again, the whole cycle,</p>
<p>you know, he got his turn.</p>
<p>So when he went away, you know, politics change.</p>
<p>And down there, basically,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a gubernatorial candidate,</p>
<p>you have either a friend, a friend of a friend,</p>
<p>or a family member be the head bodyguard guy.</p>
<p>And the guy that won the elections</p>
<p>had his head bodyguard guy already there.</p>
<p>So all of us were sent back to whatever we came from.</p>
<p>So I went back to work on the streets.</p>
<p>I was back on the operations group.</p>
<p>I was working with the sub-director directly with him,</p>
<p>basically back on the ground doing the stuff</p>
<p>that I was doing before that job.</p>
<p>We were moving away from the successes</p>
<p>that had been had by people like Lezola</p>
<p>when they were in charge of that whole process,</p>
<p>the people that I used to work with.</p>
<p>Some of the only successes in that counter push</p>
<p>against cartels in Mexico,</p>
<p>and you can kind of like, it&rsquo;s documented.</p>
<p>You can read about it out there.</p>
<p>A bunch of people wrote papers on it.</p>
<p>Some of the only successes were had by Lezola</p>
<p>in the places where he had leadership.</p>
<p>He not only pacified Tijuana,</p>
<p>he also did the same in Juarez.</p>
<p>He was sent to be the police chief in Juarez too.</p>
<p>But politics change and heroes become villains.</p>
<p>A lot of people started calling him a villain</p>
<p>because of his unorthodox approach</p>
<p>and human rights violations and all of this type of stuff</p>
<p>kind of come to the forefront.</p>
<p>And people forgot.</p>
<p>People forgot what it took to get Tijuana</p>
<p>off the most dangerous city list on the planet.</p>
<p>And people were vilified.</p>
<p>People like him and the police force</p>
<p>that I was a part of started getting compromised.</p>
<p>A lot of the things that were put forth</p>
<p>to try and keep us honest.</p>
<p>There was a program.</p>
<p>They had these centers called the C3s.</p>
<p>Basically you would go there every year.</p>
<p>You would get your financials checked.</p>
<p>You would get a physical, psychological evaluation.</p>
<p>You would get a polygraph exam done on you.</p>
<p>All the works to try and see</p>
<p>if you were somebody doing something wrong.</p>
<p>And all of that was canceled</p>
<p>because it violated your human rights</p>
<p>if you get fired from a job</p>
<p>because of a failed polygraph exam</p>
<p>because that was not an actual admissible way</p>
<p>of firing somebody.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden you had people</p>
<p>that were known cartel compromised people</p>
<p>that were fired five, six years ago</p>
<p>showing back up to work with their back paid and everything.</p>
<p>So this started happening.</p>
<p>And I quickly realized</p>
<p>that it was gonna be hard to stay there.</p>
<p>I was driving home from work</p>
<p>and I got a call from my brother</p>
<p>that my mom had been going through some health issues.</p>
<p>That had turned into psychiatric issues.</p>
<p>So we were basically taking turns</p>
<p>trying to take care of her,</p>
<p>locking the door so she wouldn&rsquo;t wander off</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So not only was I dealing with the job on the street</p>
<p>but I was dealing with that.</p>
<p>And also I had a two-year-old</p>
<p>and a marriage that was difficult at the time.</p>
<p>So I was trying to figure all these things out.</p>
<p>Made more difficult by your job?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not a financially secure job</p>
<p>and the pressures that it has</p>
<p>and the odd hours and all that made it really hard.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden my brother calls me</p>
<p>and tells me that let&rsquo;s go to the hospital.</p>
<p>Something happened to my mom.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t my turn to watch her</p>
<p>so I felt pretty shitty about that.</p>
<p>I got to the hospital and</p>
<p>the doctors came out and told us that she was gone.</p>
<p>It was a massive heart attack.</p>
<p>She had a pacemaker by then so she was gone.</p>
<p>She was in her 60s.</p>
<p>So we kind of expected something</p>
<p>but that was hard for me.</p>
<p>She was my center.</p>
<p>She was gonna be the one that I would ask for advice</p>
<p>as far as work, you know, if I should leave it or not.</p>
<p>The ground was removed from under you.</p>
<p>There was nobody, yeah, there&rsquo;s nothing underneath me.</p>
<p>I get three days off work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they gave me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to grieve as I go back to work.</p>
<p>Dark shit crosses my mind</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m going through that process</p>
<p>of trying to figure things out.</p>
<p>Dark shit like suicide, dark shit?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it was very low for you, it hit very hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to grieve basically</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to grieve for a few years</p>
<p>for different reasons.</p>
<p>I went back to work and-</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t allowed, other people or also you yourself</p>
<p>were not allowing yourself to grieve, is it like a-</p>
<p>There was other people with me</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t allow me to grieve, you know.</p>
<p>I went to work, got called into the office</p>
<p>and I was basically told that I was gonna be reassigned</p>
<p>after what I just went through.</p>
<p>The reassignment was going to be something</p>
<p>that I saw as unacceptable.</p>
<p>It was, the people in charge at that point</p>
<p>were obviously corrupted.</p>
<p>And what I got from their conversation</p>
<p>was that they wanted us to work for a specific side.</p>
<p>And I knew that that was the time to go.</p>
<p>I asked for a license, basically a license</p>
<p>is a unpaid absence from work, basically a leave of absence.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s what you call it up here,</p>
<p>which by law is allowed and I was denied for no reason.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m invested in this job, you know.</p>
<p>I have a good salary and I have a category in there.</p>
<p>So the level of time you spend in there, you get a category.</p>
<p>So I was a pretty high category agent.</p>
<p>I had all this training and again,</p>
<p>training that would be useless in the private sector</p>
<p>or in the public sector in Mexico,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t change from one corporation to another,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t go to work for another police institution.</p>
<p>So I took a deep breath and I resigned.</p>
<p>I went to the office, I said, I need to resign.</p>
<p>They said, what?</p>
<p>I need to resign.</p>
<p>Some of the people in the office that knew me</p>
<p>from a long time were like, what&rsquo;s wrong with you?</p>
<p>They thought I was having a mental breakdown.</p>
<p>Handed all over all the paperwork,</p>
<p>took a big trash bag, put all my stuff in there,</p>
<p>plate armor, tear gas grenades, gas mask, satellite radio,</p>
<p>MP5 magazines, an MP5 submachine gun,</p>
<p>Glock, Glock magazines, all of it, helmet.</p>
<p>And I put it in the, I handed it over in the armory</p>
<p>and I left, I made some phone calls.</p>
<p>I was married to an American and my daughter&rsquo;s American.</p>
<p>I never envisioned myself coming to the United States,</p>
<p>do that process for myself, so I was invested in that job.</p>
<p>I thought I was gonna die or retire from that.</p>
<p>And it quickly became like an issue</p>
<p>because everybody was wondering</p>
<p>why I left the job so abruptly.</p>
<p>So there was some threats made when I left</p>
<p>by people inside the office.</p>
<p>And I probably, you know, it&rsquo;s anonymous shit.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s significant pressure not to leave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to leave this kind of job.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The system makes it difficult to leave.</p>
<p>The individuals, to the degree they might be corrupted,</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t want you to leave.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no support, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no support.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably the opposite of support.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Almost like implied or explicit or implicit threats.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Luckily, I had developed some friendships</p>
<p>in the United States with some of the people</p>
<p>that I used to work with and cross-train with</p>
<p>and some friendships that I developed with people</p>
<p>that I would just talk to and make friends with stateside.</p>
<p>One of them is a Navy SEAL reservist</p>
<p>whose name is Dan Stanchfield and his wife, Kelly.</p>
<p>They opened the doors of their house to me</p>
<p>and my kid and my wife at that time.</p>
<p>As I seek to basically look for the American dream,</p>
<p>I crossed the border with my kid</p>
<p>and nobody knew anything, you know.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t, they didn&rsquo;t tell anybody, just, you know,</p>
<p>my wife and I was off.</p>
<p>When I came to the States,</p>
<p>I already kind of dabbled in the whole training field</p>
<p>and showing some of my experience to people.</p>
<p>So I had at least a seed of that out there.</p>
<p>People knew me for that.</p>
<p>But all of a sudden I was in the middle</p>
<p>of an avocado orchard in the middle of California</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s quiet.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no more radios going off all of the night.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more, three cell phones on the counter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no guns, there&rsquo;s no rifles,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no 80 people calling to see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s just quiet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s during the time when Trump got elected.</p>
<p>So the immigration process that usually would take,</p>
<p>I had most things going for me,</p>
<p>the immigration process that would take,</p>
<p>at most a year, took two years.</p>
<p>So it was not an easy process to not only come to the US,</p>
<p>but, you know, come to the US with that pressure,</p>
<p>kind of underlying pressure,</p>
<p>as far as being an immigrant at that time here.</p>
<p>And then your own personal psychological, the PTSD,</p>
<p>of going from a war zone to an avocado orchard.</p>
<p>The word PTSD and TBI and all of these things,</p>
<p>I did not, I didn&rsquo;t know any of them.</p>
<p>It was through people that I got to meet</p>
<p>in the training field that were, you know,</p>
<p>Marines, SEALs, Marisoc guys, those types of people</p>
<p>that started giving words to some of the things that I felt,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t really know, you know.</p>
<p>We would treat post-traumatic stress</p>
<p>with alcohol and vacation time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A bottle of Mezcal.</p>
<p>You know, when you see the bottom of it,</p>
<p>your troubles are gone.</p>
<p>Cured.</p>
<p>Yeah, immediately.</p>
<p>I was an alcoholic, as well as all of the other stuff.</p>
<p>I was drinking myself to sleep every third night.</p>
<p>My marriage, obviously, was failing, you know.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t easy for her, you know.</p>
<p>She was brave, and she did what she could,</p>
<p>and I totally respect and understand her process with it,</p>
<p>but, you know, when it&rsquo;s quiet, that&rsquo;s when it hits you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, I think that&rsquo;s what a lot of people experience</p>
<p>when they come back from a conflict zone.</p>
<p>You know, everything that was life and death,</p>
<p>everything that mattered, all the noise, all the chaos,</p>
<p>all the people that are around you</p>
<p>that would die for you, kill for you,</p>
<p>you would kill for them.</p>
<p>All these millions of dollars worth of equipment</p>
<p>and stuff like that you were responsible for</p>
<p>now are all gone, and it&rsquo;s just you walking into a Circle K</p>
<p>and buying three cans of Fosters</p>
<p>to drink yourself to sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, you write on your Patreon brilliantly</p>
<p>about BTSD, about the cost of things you&rsquo;ve done and seen.</p>
<p>Quote, when it&rsquo;s over and we&rsquo;re far from that chaos</p>
<p>and noise of death being close and life being real,</p>
<p>that is when some of us remember in the quiet nights</p>
<p>in a field in Tennessee looking at fireflies,</p>
<p>walking through a fair, holding hands with a lover,</p>
<p>asking you what&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>At your kid&rsquo;s birthday party,</p>
<p>leave early to avoid the ending of a celebration.</p>
<p>That is what the quiet means to some of us.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s speaking to that silence, the quiet.</p>
<p>How do you live with and thrive</p>
<p>with this newly learned term of PTSD?</p>
<p>If anything, I would recommend people</p>
<p>that have any of these issues to go to places</p>
<p>where other people have their issues,</p>
<p>so you can, it&rsquo;s not a competition,</p>
<p>but you get to see the scope of problems in the world</p>
<p>and you sometimes feel kind of lucky as far as your own.</p>
<p>Like it humbles you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It makes you appreciate all the different kinds of struggles</p>
<p>that people go through.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I went through some horrible shit,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some people there that went through</p>
<p>a lot of more horrible shit</p>
<p>or stuff that I don&rsquo;t think I could have survived.</p>
<p>When I went through that process of figuring things out,</p>
<p>you know, the first thing that glaringly pointed out</p>
<p>or stuck out to me was my inability to process things.</p>
<p>Like there was a big pause button there, a giant one.</p>
<p>Everything was on pause.</p>
<p>My grieving, not only my mom, but my brother.</p>
<p>So I had a pause button on me since I was 13, basically.</p>
<p>Then I got to bury many of my friends</p>
<p>and inform their wives or girlfriends of what happened.</p>
<p>And that all, again, was paused</p>
<p>because I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to process.</p>
<p>You know, I spent years without going on vacation</p>
<p>because I was a workaholic.</p>
<p>And I found at the core of my issues, alcohol,</p>
<p>a giant pause button in the form of alcohol.</p>
<p>Basically, I would drink my problems away</p>
<p>or specifically I would,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you have a mess in your house,</p>
<p>you just put a big tarp over it, you know,</p>
<p>to cover it up and alcohol, it was that for me.</p>
<p>And it festered more and more</p>
<p>as I not only went through the process of learning</p>
<p>about PCSD, going through therapy,</p>
<p>but refusing to let that go, you know,</p>
<p>like going through therapy</p>
<p>and seeing what other people&rsquo;s problems were.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna, you know, this is the only thing I have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, you know, I&rsquo;m not hurting anybody with it,</p>
<p>you know, why do I need to get rid of that?</p>
<p>By this point, I was traveling across the country</p>
<p>and training people and showing some of the experiences</p>
<p>that I had to other people, speaking, being on podcasts</p>
<p>and having conversations like the one I&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>with you.</p>
<p>So speaking to the skills that you&rsquo;ve developed.</p>
<p>And in a way, basically reliving</p>
<p>and reopening a bunch of shit for myself</p>
<p>every time I do it.</p>
<p>So it was, I was getting triggered</p>
<p>and the way I would manage that was I would drink,</p>
<p>you know, at the end of the night</p>
<p>after a weekend class somewhere,</p>
<p>when I talk about the fireflies in a field in Tennessee,</p>
<p>it was a moment where I was forcing myself</p>
<p>to try and be sober.</p>
<p>And we did this medical class out</p>
<p>in the hills in Tennessee, a beautiful green place,</p>
<p>beautiful family there that hosted us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the first time I ever saw fireflies.</p>
<p>So I was like, I thought I was having</p>
<p>a hallucinogenic experience.</p>
<p>When I say, why is the wire, why is the dust glowing?</p>
<p>You know, is what I thought.</p>
<p>A friend of mine is a veteran.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s ran off to the woods and grabbed one</p>
<p>and brought it to me and showed it to me.</p>
<p>I was like, holy shit, what is, that&rsquo;s a firefly.</p>
<p>Wow, how do they glow?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s crushed in his hand and said, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And that, you know, brought me back immediately</p>
<p>to holy shit, you know, it kind of like,</p>
<p>I was off somewhere and I was back and I had to go drink.</p>
<p>I went through that process of like going off</p>
<p>and getting on and going off, getting off</p>
<p>and my marriage separated.</p>
<p>And that was another end of the world aspect to everything.</p>
<p>You know, I lost my mother, I lost the job</p>
<p>and then the marriage failed and it was on me.</p>
<p>I basically went somewhere and did a stock</p>
<p>of everything that was going on</p>
<p>and made a decision to stop drinking.</p>
<p>Yeah, had some bad relationships after.</p>
<p>And I just came to a place where I need to stop drinking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotten to a point so low.</p>
<p>Was this a decision you arrived at by yourself?</p>
<p>Was there some inspiration</p>
<p>or was it just the point is so low, lost so much?</p>
<p>It was the start of COVID.</p>
<p>So this is recent, this is probably too,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have two years sober in December.</p>
<p>So when you talked to Rogan the first time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still struggling with this demand?</p>
<p>I was in and out of the car, basic is what I would say,</p>
<p>you know, I was in and out of</p>
<p>and then trying to get rid of it.</p>
<p>That must be a super stressful experience</p>
<p>talking to Joe Rogan the first time</p>
<p>you drank that night, do you remember?</p>
<p>The second time I was there, I went somewhere,</p>
<p>got shit faced.</p>
<p>It was stressful, not for any other reason</p>
<p>than I felt the responsibility to the people</p>
<p>that couldn&rsquo;t speak about it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the pressure.</p>
<p>It was the start of COVID</p>
<p>and things started getting shut down and slowed down.</p>
<p>My dad got really sick and almost died.</p>
<p>We had to set up like some Jason Bourne level shit</p>
<p>at my brother&rsquo;s place, he was in Mexico, you know?</p>
<p>So we had to bribe a guy to get us an oxygen tank</p>
<p>and I had to shimmy rig a respirator</p>
<p>and it was some shit.</p>
<p>But my dad was like, he survived it, you know?</p>
<p>The doctors were like, say goodbye.</p>
<p>And my dad was like, yeah, say goodbye to him, you know?</p>
<p>Okay, so your dad&rsquo;s a gangster, I got it, tough dad.</p>
<p>He did some gangster shit that day.</p>
<p>But on my end, I was being isolated basically</p>
<p>as COVID is, everybody&rsquo;s slowing down,</p>
<p>no more classes, no more excuses to go out there</p>
<p>and drink and no more socializing.</p>
<p>So social drinking turned into alone drinking</p>
<p>more and more and more.</p>
<p>I bought a bottle of gin.</p>
<p>Because I was down in Mexico taking care of my dad</p>
<p>and they closed down beer production in Mexico.</p>
<p>So beer went away.</p>
<p>And beer was a way I kind of managed it, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard alcohol, it&rsquo;s just beer, so you know?</p>
<p>But that went away, so it was just hard alcohol</p>
<p>that was what was available down there.</p>
<p>I, one night alone at the house, my dad&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>I drank a bottle of gin, a whole bottle of gin.</p>
<p>I almost died.</p>
<p>And after that, you know, some people started noticing</p>
<p>that I was isolating more and more</p>
<p>and it was kind of eating away at me.</p>
<p>I was in a relationship at that point</p>
<p>when I started seeing everything</p>
<p>just kind of fall apart around me.</p>
<p>And I drank half of a glass of wine</p>
<p>and it made me sick to my, like internally in my mind.</p>
<p>And my kid said to me, and I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>nobody coached her, nobody said anything to her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a pretty intuitive kid.</p>
<p>She said, I don&rsquo;t drink anymore, Dad.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>And I stopped, I stopped that night.</p>
<p>I remember waking up at three in the morning</p>
<p>and taking a cooler that I had</p>
<p>and just dumping all the beers in it</p>
<p>and chucking them in the garbage</p>
<p>and with a knife poking each of them</p>
<p>to not, you know, be tempted to go pack for them.</p>
<p>And then the second day I went around</p>
<p>and started finding the hides that I had</p>
<p>because I had some, you know, hides.</p>
<p>And then I went somewhere</p>
<p>and locked myself in for two weeks.</p>
<p>I had the withdrawals,</p>
<p>the clearest nightmares that I&rsquo;d ever had in my life</p>
<p>for two, three weeks.</p>
<p>I went somewhere, I don&rsquo;t wanna keep them private,</p>
<p>but I went somewhere where they offered a place for me.</p>
<p>And when I asked them about it, it&rsquo;s a community,</p>
<p>I gave them some money for their school as a donation.</p>
<p>I gave them like a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>I said, yeah, sure, come, you can go through this process.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re cool as fuck, people.</p>
<p>The first thing they did when I got there</p>
<p>is they stood me up in front of everybody</p>
<p>to thank me for the donation.</p>
<p>And then told everybody that I was an alcoholic.</p>
<p>And if anybody saw me drinking,</p>
<p>I was to be kicked out of there immediately.</p>
<p>And I felt horrible.</p>
<p>So that was where I started.</p>
<p>Was that temptation still there?</p>
<p>There was a moment when it was.</p>
<p>And some therapy circle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a rodeo clown friend of mine</p>
<p>who his body&rsquo;s, his spine is basically fused together,</p>
<p>you know, type of guy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been friends and enemies and friends again,</p>
<p>you know, during our therapy circle sessions.</p>
<p>Oh, so like there&rsquo;s an intimacy there.</p>
<p>Yeah, he didn&rsquo;t know anything about me.</p>
<p>One time when we were telling our story,</p>
<p>he stood up and told his story.</p>
<p>And then he heard mine and then he was pissed off at me</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t wanna talk to me for a while.</p>
<p>And then later he told me that it was because</p>
<p>he saw what I did with my experience</p>
<p>and how much of a difference that he perceived</p>
<p>that I was making with it.</p>
<p>And he felt jealous that he couldn&rsquo;t do the same</p>
<p>with his experience because he was just a broken</p>
<p>ex-rodeo clown.</p>
<p>He told me when I was going through the process,</p>
<p>he was like, hey, you&rsquo;re an internet celebrity person,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re known.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you worried about people finding out</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re recovering drunk?</p>
<p>And I said, yeah, it&rsquo;s fucking scary as shit</p>
<p>if people find out that I am going through this process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary that, you know, the critique.</p>
<p>You know, I already get a lot of shit</p>
<p>for being an ex-police officer in Mexico</p>
<p>and all the negativity that comes from that.</p>
<p>And he said, don&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>You know, that you can&rsquo;t pickpocket a naked man.</p>
<p>So just get naked.</p>
<p>And what does that mean?</p>
<p>Write about it.</p>
<p>Post it online.</p>
<p>You never know.</p>
<p>Somebody out there might get inspired</p>
<p>to do their own kind of process.</p>
<p>So I started posting about it.</p>
<p>Cowardly in a way because I wanted to make other people</p>
<p>keep me on the path, you know.</p>
<p>But in other ways, you know, desperation.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t wanna drink anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna go back on that path,</p>
<p>which I know leads directly to a bad death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid of death.</p>
<p>I just want a good one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a bad one.</p>
<p>I think that was gonna lead me to a bad death.</p>
<p>I started writing about it and sharing it online,</p>
<p>you know, through my fever dreams post</p>
<p>and just being humorous about it online</p>
<p>and getting a lot of hate on one side, you know.</p>
<p>Having a few people and companies that I work with</p>
<p>kind of step back and seeing this guy has some issues</p>
<p>to having other people kind of make fun of</p>
<p>or make light of that weakness portrayed.</p>
<p>Oh, so getting hate, getting criticism</p>
<p>because here you are a counter-narcotics police officer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s a drinking problem.</p>
<p>So is that like supposed to be what like flaws revealed?</p>
<p>Weakness or a perception of alpha in the US, I guess,</p>
<p>that some people have, you know.</p>
<p>You were supposed to be strong and here you are.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not Jocko Willink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not David Goggins.</p>
<p>You know, I wake up at 10 in the morning sometimes</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll have cornflakes with my eight-year-old, you know.</p>
<p>I like days off.</p>
<p>I used to wake up at 3.30 in the morning every day</p>
<p>to review what happened during the night</p>
<p>and then go off for a jog and then the gym</p>
<p>and just be ready to be able to murder somebody</p>
<p>with my hands if I had to.</p>
<p>But that is, I couldn&rsquo;t maintain that</p>
<p>during the whole process of getting out of it.</p>
<p>Now leaving alcohol, I remember just being honest with it</p>
<p>and just seeing the two sides of it, you know.</p>
<p>Joe told me never read the comment section, right?</p>
<p>Which is a beautiful, it&rsquo;s a beautiful piece of advice.</p>
<p>But they get to you sometimes</p>
<p>when you talk about some of these things openly.</p>
<p>And some of the comments were positive</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been seeing people comment,</p>
<p>sending me messages and meeting people on the road</p>
<p>that are five months in, 10 months.</p>
<p>Some people that have been on that wagon</p>
<p>for way longer than I have.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s cool when you meet people</p>
<p>that are superhuman or perform</p>
<p>and take an extreme ownership of things</p>
<p>and are just amazing people that are thriving out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inspirational.</p>
<p>I see some of these people and I&rsquo;m like, holy shit,</p>
<p>I need to figure out how to get to some semblance of that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not that, you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through the ringer.</p>
<p>I fucked up a shit ton of times.</p>
<p>My nose is an example of that.</p>
<p>I have a few missing teeth.</p>
<p>But in a way, I think all of that is part of the process</p>
<p>and not a lot of people wanna talk about, you know.</p>
<p>Independently of the experience I got down there</p>
<p>and some of the things that I show and talk about</p>
<p>and some of the advocacy I do related to women like her</p>
<p>that are, you know, trying to look for a better life</p>
<p>and trying to find their missing kids,</p>
<p>training people to not get into those situations,</p>
<p>but also showcasing the fact that people</p>
<p>that go through some of these processes</p>
<p>have a journey to go through, you know.</p>
<p>I just came into your studio with a duffel bag</p>
<p>straight from the airport</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna leave early tomorrow morning</p>
<p>to somewhere else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on the road for almost,</p>
<p>I think five years nonstop.</p>
<p>I go back to a specific place every week</p>
<p>to see my kid for two, three days.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m back out.</p>
<p>You know, some people are like, are you running?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, are you worried?</p>
<p>Is this afraid about something?</p>
<p>No, but I am, you know, on this weird</p>
<p>path, I guess, trying to look for something</p>
<p>that I think I&rsquo;ve been missing</p>
<p>as far as my afterlife of a sort,</p>
<p>you know, coming out of that.</p>
<p>What do you think that is?</p>
<p>Are you looking for some kind of a deeper understanding</p>
<p>of humanity, like from the specific experiences</p>
<p>you had to get some deeper understanding</p>
<p>of what the hell we&rsquo;re all doing here?</p>
<p>I meet people every weekend with different stories.</p>
<p>You know, people come to some of my classes.</p>
<p>You know, I show them how to weaponize the environment,</p>
<p>how to harm themselves, how to not get abducted.</p>
<p>I meet people that have gone through those experience</p>
<p>and are basically trying to work through</p>
<p>some of their own issues by going</p>
<p>through the training like that.</p>
<p>I get to meet people that are, you know,</p>
<p>people that I&rsquo;ve only seen online, you know,</p>
<p>or seen in videos.</p>
<p>I remember meeting Royce Gracie in Harvard City.</p>
<p>I heard of that guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a pretty interesting character.</p>
<p>I remember seeing him in a bootleg VHS video.</p>
<p>I told him about it.</p>
<p>We were doing a class out at Emerson Knives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a knife company, but Mr. Emerson also has</p>
<p>like a jujitsu gym there where Royce trades out of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his space.</p>
<p>And, you know, they&rsquo;re teaching how to defend</p>
<p>against somebody trying to stab you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m showing them all the ways you can get around that</p>
<p>and fabricate and improvise and smuggle things,</p>
<p>basically the adversarial side of that.</p>
<p>It just, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m known for.</p>
<p>The psychology and kind of the ways that people do that.</p>
<p>And I remember him seeing some of the stuff</p>
<p>that I was doing and just being like,</p>
<p>where are you from?</p>
<p>Mexico.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>You know, somebody from Brazil, you know,</p>
<p>tipping the hat to somebody from Mexico</p>
<p>as far as with him seeing the violence</p>
<p>and some of the mentality behind it.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Royce Gracie is the legendary martial artist</p>
<p>that probably introduced Brazilian jujitsu</p>
<p>to the American audience, to the world,</p>
<p>to the process of UFC and showing the effectiveness of it</p>
<p>in practice that a little skinny guy</p>
<p>can defeat a big aggressive guy.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>An anaconda, a small anaconda walking into that ring</p>
<p>with his family behind him.</p>
<p>Wearing pajamas.</p>
<p>Wearing pajamas and everybody was like,</p>
<p>what is this guy wearing pajamas for?</p>
<p>And then he would strangle people with those pajamas.</p>
<p>I remember seeing that and just having it,</p>
<p>I think probably what a generation before had</p>
<p>with Bruce Lee, I guess,</p>
<p>our, my generation was Royce walking into that,</p>
<p>walking into that octagon and changing, you know, paradigms.</p>
<p>Seeing him in that gym,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also an avid gun owner and shooter,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>You know, having, seeing somebody like him</p>
<p>who is, you know, well-versed with his hands</p>
<p>also be a man that has gone into the realm</p>
<p>of being well-versed with weaponry,</p>
<p>which is an aspect of martial arts</p>
<p>and the martial way of thinking that, you know,</p>
<p>some people kind of,</p>
<p>the purist will stick with one side of it,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s obviously a warrior in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>So just as a small tangent,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re somebody that you don&rsquo;t just look</p>
<p>at unarmed combat,</p>
<p>you look at the full spectrum of the chaos of combat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s outside of the realm of jujitsu</p>
<p>and even just mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>Armed with knives and beyond.</p>
<p>Was his mind open to the fuller spectrum of violence?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he was in the middle of this class</p>
<p>that we were doing where people were basically</p>
<p>focusing on both.</p>
<p>Ernest Emerson, who&rsquo;s famous for his knives,</p>
<p>he has a knife company, he&rsquo;s done knives for NASA,</p>
<p>you know, not only that,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also a very avid martial artist.</p>
<p>He trained with a lot of Filipino martial arts</p>
<p>related to knives and stuff like that,</p>
<p>but a different mindset, you know,</p>
<p>a defensive mindset,</p>
<p>trying to train people how to defend against that.</p>
<p>And you have Royce, who&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s from Brazil.</p>
<p>I mean, he has some street in him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that, you know,</p>
<p>those guys,</p>
<p>those tienen calles, we say in Mexico.</p>
<p>Seeing the ways he would,</p>
<p>he stepped in there and provided some encouragement</p>
<p>to the people there as far as, you know,</p>
<p>how people sometimes focus on the,</p>
<p>this is a system and this is a way,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s other ways out there</p>
<p>that might negate or defeat the ways</p>
<p>that you are concentrating on, you know?</p>
<p>So kind of get out of that bubble.</p>
<p>My whole kind of speciality</p>
<p>or what I focus on is mindset</p>
<p>and figuring out the software</p>
<p>that some of these people gain and gather from.</p>
<p>If I need to arm myself, you know,</p>
<p>the easiest thing to manufacture in most places</p>
<p>is a pointed object.</p>
<p>So I can take that crystal big pen</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re writing on that notepad with</p>
<p>and using the friction from the carpet,</p>
<p>I can turn it into a hypodermic needle</p>
<p>that you can then poke into somebody&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the process of doing that?</p>
<p>I can do it right now if you want.</p>
<p>No, but can you use your words for the listener</p>
<p>and also because I&rsquo;m terrified.</p>
<p>No, basically you can take the heat and friction</p>
<p>created from this carpet.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You can grab that pen.</p>
<p>In and of itself, it will pierce flesh,</p>
<p>but it will slow itself down</p>
<p>because it has a few angles on the tip.</p>
<p>Oh, you want to wear down the angles.</p>
<p>So if you take that tip off</p>
<p>and you grab it and grind it on an angle on the carpet,</p>
<p>the heat will actually turn it into a hypodermic needle</p>
<p>if you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Hypodermic meaning like it smoothens the entry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make a point in an angle</p>
<p>that will guide its way into your flesh.</p>
<p>So you can actually go through a torso with that</p>
<p>if you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>As a small tangent, you also gave me a present.</p>
<p>Could be one of the most epic presents I&rsquo;ve ever received.</p>
<p>You gave it to Rogan.</p>
<p>Can you explain what I&rsquo;m holding in my hands?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy online, Coffin Tramp.</p>
<p>This is a moniker.</p>
<p>It is a G10 rod.</p>
<p>G10 is a very strong material, basically.</p>
<p>A lot of people make actually G10 knives,</p>
<p>which are basically non-magnetic, non-ferrous objects</p>
<p>that can be utilized as a stabbing instrument.</p>
<p>The core of it isn&rsquo;t an actual pencil core.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a G10 core,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s encased in oak, hard oak.</p>
<p>So that is capable, again, of stabbing through a torso.</p>
<p>Now, the guy that made that is an artisan.</p>
<p>He makes that.</p>
<p>It looks like a pencil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s concealed in the nature of the object itself.</p>
<p>But that small object is capable of being introduced</p>
<p>into a chest cavity.</p>
<p>All it takes is about the half of your thumb</p>
<p>or the length of your thumb to stab into your chest cavity,</p>
<p>and now your pericardium is pierced,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s being filled with blood,</p>
<p>or your whole heart is pierced,</p>
<p>and you have a few minutes to live</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re at a standing heart rate.</p>
<p>So this has the effectiveness of a knife, essentially.</p>
<p>It has the effectiveness of a shank or an ice pick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna cut, but it&rsquo;s gonna make a hole</p>
<p>where it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>Here, the pen is literally mightier than the sword.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, this is really epic</p>
<p>from a perspective of an academic.</p>
<p>This is a symbol of both intelligence and violence.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And also the current state of affairs</p>
<p>where people need to arm themselves</p>
<p>with things that are concealed as far as their purpose</p>
<p>in a place where, in a country or in a society</p>
<p>that limits their ability to arm themselves.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to a safe place,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to a place where no weapon&rsquo;s allowed,</p>
<p>which means a target-rich environment if you&rsquo;re a predator.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sign of rebellion.</p>
<p>Let this be a signal of everyone should be terrified</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re around me,</p>
<p>because even a pencil can murder you,</p>
<p>and I intend to use this.</p>
<p>Yeah, nobody owns life,</p>
<p>but anybody that can hold a frying pan owns death</p>
<p>is a quote that I heard once, which is a beautiful one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at you.</p>
<p>If anyone betrays me, this is the way to go.</p>
<p>Can you, given all your experience</p>
<p>and all the different ways</p>
<p>when you think about martial arts and violence,</p>
<p>in Mexico, in the world, speaking of hoists,</p>
<p>what is your approach to conflict, like a street fight?</p>
<p>What advice would you give people</p>
<p>in the full spectrum of what a street altercation</p>
<p>might entail?</p>
<p>What is the best way to approach it?</p>
<p>I think before you get there, you have to prepare.</p>
<p>One of the first things I tell people</p>
<p>is if you don&rsquo;t have a basic T-triple-C training class</p>
<p>behind you, you should reanalyze your life</p>
<p>and your ability to prepare.</p>
<p>T-triple-C.</p>
<p>Basically how to stop somebody from bleeding out</p>
<p>or dying from a stab wound, gunshot wound,</p>
<p>or any of those types of wounds,</p>
<p>or an amputated leg during an IED scenario.</p>
<p>Anything you would see in a Boston Marathon-type event</p>
<p>or a Vegas shooting event</p>
<p>where people are getting shot, stabbed, cut.</p>
<p>So understand how to help people,</p>
<p>how to help yourself post-violence.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be a detriment to the situation.</p>
<p>You want to be an asset.</p>
<p>So build yourself up as an asset in a situation like that</p>
<p>because you might be doing that on yourself</p>
<p>or on somebody else.</p>
<p>And also it helps you understand what situations</p>
<p>are going to result in a lot of,</p>
<p>in a difficult situation to deal with afterwards.</p>
<p>Yeah, it also teaches you what to stab and what to shoot.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about it in a full,</p>
<p>and on all the dimensions of it, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all knowledge can be weaponized.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the approach</p>
<p>all people should kind of figure out for themselves</p>
<p>when they start getting ready</p>
<p>or if they want to take the responsibility</p>
<p>of their own safety in their hands.</p>
<p>So in a self-defense situation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of questions here, but what does one stab?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the carotid arteries,</p>
<p>which are used commonly in jujitsu as something to choke</p>
<p>because they feed a computer, you know?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of blood flowing through that</p>
<p>required for the successful operation of the computer.</p>
<p>And not a lot of stuff is guarding the outside world</p>
<p>from your carotid arteries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really weird design, by the way.</p>
<p>It is not a smart one.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even make sense because with mammals,</p>
<p>they bite each other&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Like why can&rsquo;t you have more protection?</p>
<p>Is this the only, like us humans don&rsquo;t use our mouth</p>
<p>to kill each other, but most mammals, most predators do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why the hell don&rsquo;t we protect this?</p>
<p>We do have a defensive mechanism</p>
<p>and you see it sometimes when people are ambushed</p>
<p>and people try to open up each other&rsquo;s necks from behind.</p>
<p>If you push somebody&rsquo;s neck forward,</p>
<p>the carotids will actually lower themselves</p>
<p>and be encased in more flesh and muscle.</p>
<p>If you pull a head back, not so much.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a way that at least I think the evolutionary,</p>
<p>we have a defensive mechanism for that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few videos out there</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s getting their neck sewn back shut</p>
<p>after somebody pushed their head forward</p>
<p>to try and slice their necks and they survived.</p>
<p>So this is a viable target.</p>
<p>The heart is another one.</p>
<p>Interesting about the thing about the heart</p>
<p>and people get alarmed when I talk about this</p>
<p>and show it in classes.</p>
<p>Again, a lot of the classes I do are for orientation</p>
<p>and for people to recognize that behavior.</p>
<p>So a lot of law enforcement comes to some of these classes</p>
<p>and say, oh, that&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how somebody will kill somebody.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is how people that know their shit</p>
<p>will try and approach somebody and stab you to death.</p>
<p>This is how they would do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tendency to view what we see in John Wick</p>
<p>or view what we see in this martial arts community</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re slicing and dicing people</p>
<p>different myriads of ways.</p>
<p>A lot of that is based on dueling-based cultures</p>
<p>like the Filipino martial arts</p>
<p>or some of the Italian martial arts out there</p>
<p>where somebody&rsquo;s facing off with somebody else</p>
<p>with a similar weapon</p>
<p>and where both of us are agreeing</p>
<p>to basically get into a stabbing competition.</p>
<p>That would make sense in that scenario, in that context,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never seen a lot of people</p>
<p>actually get into these one-on-one knife altercations.</p>
<p>What we see now in a modern context</p>
<p>when it talks about weaponry</p>
<p>is an ambush, counter-ambush-based scenario</p>
<p>where somebody pulls out a knife</p>
<p>during a grappling situation on the street</p>
<p>or when somebody turns a striking exchange of punches</p>
<p>into pulling out a cheap gas station knife</p>
<p>or a pen or a rock from the ground or a handgun.</p>
<p>Most modern combatants, when it comes to weaponry,</p>
<p>should be kind of based on the whole aspect</p>
<p>of ambush and counter-ambush.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people showing valuable type of material</p>
<p>and coursework on this out there.</p>
<p>My whole approach and my specific kind of realm</p>
<p>is in the aspect of how people go from the process</p>
<p>of learning some of these things from experiential stuff,</p>
<p>people that grow up in rural places,</p>
<p>grow up on pig farms,</p>
<p>that actually get the experience of processing a pig,</p>
<p>for example, or processing an animal.</p>
<p>Those people will have more skills, hunters,</p>
<p>those people will have more skills with a knife</p>
<p>if they pick it up as a weapon</p>
<p>than most of the martial artists that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>kind of approach some of these classes</p>
<p>where I go and have a simulated torso</p>
<p>in the form of a pig hanging in a room somewhere.</p>
<p>Some of that has to do with just the familiarity</p>
<p>and the comfort of just like the biology</p>
<p>of a living organism,</p>
<p>like that if you cut off certain things,</p>
<p>if you cut a certain thing, it&rsquo;s just a meat vehicle.</p>
<p>The same thing, the medical training should come first,</p>
<p>or if you don&rsquo;t have that, be a hunter</p>
<p>or go to a butchery class.</p>
<p>That will teach you more about how to use a knife</p>
<p>on somebody else than anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll give you the experience of flesh.</p>
<p>Most people, I do this example every now and then</p>
<p>where I have people bring in a tactical knife</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll bring in a butter knife</p>
<p>and I ask them which will go through a torso.</p>
<p>We have a pig there,</p>
<p>so it simulates a torso pretty closely.</p>
<p>Most people will say,</p>
<p>nah, that butter knife is not gonna go through.</p>
<p>And it does, it does go through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thin enough, strong enough,</p>
<p>sturdy enough that it&rsquo;ll go through.</p>
<p>Kitchen knife, a cheap one that cost 89 cents at a Walmart</p>
<p>and an expensive $400 one.</p>
<p>And the cheap one will outperform the expensive one.</p>
<p>The tip will snap off during some of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have to say that just as a small tangent,</p>
<p>I went to a farm and just seeing the butchering of meat</p>
<p>and so on and the processing of meat</p>
<p>and pigs and cows,</p>
<p>whoo, that&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I think it also, it&rsquo;s honest and raw</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something that probably</p>
<p>everyone should experience regularly.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s also humbling to remind you.</p>
<p>Like when I had a dog, Homer, he&rsquo;s in Newfoundland,</p>
<p>that I was very close with and we lost him.</p>
<p>And I just remember that I carried him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like 200 something pounds.</p>
<p>And I had to carry him and I had to put him to sleep.</p>
<p>And like one of the biggest realizations is like,</p>
<p>oh, this is just a biological thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, and then to realize that this is just meat.</p>
<p>This is not, and you can cut it.</p>
<p>And then if you bleed,</p>
<p>all of a sudden the life can disappear from you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all gone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, holy shit, there&rsquo;s this meat vehicle</p>
<p>that some people have referred to as Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a few stabbings away from like-</p>
<p>Leaving.</p>
<p>Yeah, from leaving, goodbye.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a soul that just flies away.</p>
<p>It used to be that we had to hang around,</p>
<p>people would come back from battle</p>
<p>and we would hear things next to the campfire.</p>
<p>As far as, oh, he stabbed somebody here and this happens.</p>
<p>But now we live in an age where you can,</p>
<p>when I do a class, this is a stab to the heart.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s like five videos of it happening live,</p>
<p>on live leaks or whatever.</p>
<p>And we can deconstruct that.</p>
<p>Not only that, but what weapon was used.</p>
<p>Oh, it was a gas station folder.</p>
<p>It was a pioneer woman knife from Walmart</p>
<p>with flowers on the handle, you know, whatever it was.</p>
<p>And people start realizing that it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot,</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of training</p>
<p>because a lot of these people are not high-level assassins</p>
<p>trained by ninjas in the hills or anything like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re people that grew up rurally</p>
<p>or learned by seeing that behavior in others.</p>
<p>And when they start coming to the realization</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to do that,</p>
<p>and they start figuring out like,</p>
<p>how do you counteract that?</p>
<p>Well, number one, learn the behavior yourself</p>
<p>so you can recognize it.</p>
<p>The whole aspect of being a good counter ambush team</p>
<p>is to be the best ambusher in the planet.</p>
<p>So again, the whole aspect of Musashi saying,</p>
<p>know your enemy, know his sword.</p>
<p>You know, you figure that out</p>
<p>as far as learning that behavior.</p>
<p>You know, when you start seeing</p>
<p>how some of these stabbings occur,</p>
<p>the first thing you notice is that one of the hands</p>
<p>is always kind of out of the picture,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a lack of symmetry in the people</p>
<p>that are about to do something horrible.</p>
<p>So when you see lack of symmetry in the environment,</p>
<p>somebody with their hands going backwards,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a crowd of people and two or one individual</p>
<p>is looking counter where everybody else is looking,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a hyper-aware individual in a crowd.</p>
<p>The hyper-aware are always usually out there</p>
<p>to fuck somebody over, or they&rsquo;re trying to keep</p>
<p>those predators from fucking somebody else over.</p>
<p>So unless you step back and you put yourself in the process</p>
<p>of learning how they learn,</p>
<p>and you become that potential nightmare person,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to recognize that in a crowd.</p>
<p>It feels like one of the significant ways to win</p>
<p>or as a street fighter is to avoid it</p>
<p>by sort of sending pacifist signals in every way,</p>
<p>meaning avoiding the situation</p>
<p>whenever there&rsquo;s like a hyper-vigilant people.</p>
<p>You just kind of avoid signaling</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re one of the players of interest.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about counter-ambush,</p>
<p>at which point do you do that versus shift to the aggression?</p>
<p>I think violence should be always an option.</p>
<p>Everybody should have that option,</p>
<p>and you need to be good at that option.</p>
<p>I think I heard Jordan Peterson talk about the fact</p>
<p>that everybody needs to be dangerous,</p>
<p>but keep that shit under control.</p>
<p>I think he was referring to a different context, but.</p>
<p>I know, I know, I&rsquo;m referring to the ability of.</p>
<p>The little physical conflict as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two cases that I saw of people</p>
<p>just utilizing social engineering to a beautiful degree</p>
<p>to deescalate shit.</p>
<p>One guy somewhere, first off, if you&rsquo;re in a place</p>
<p>where people are grabbing your wife&rsquo;s ass</p>
<p>or something like that, like what are you doing there?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a load of things that are wrong with everything</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing in your life to be in that environment.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re in an inescapable situation.</p>
<p>There was this guy who was in a compromised position.</p>
<p>Somebody wanted to fight him, like legit kick his ass.</p>
<p>And he said, okay, let&rsquo;s go, but I just,</p>
<p>I need to warn you that I have hep C before we go outside.</p>
<p>And that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s masterful.</p>
<p>I was getting my phone out to film this, you know, maybe.</p>
<p>And even I was just lowered my phone to give him a slow clap.</p>
<p>That was a beautiful move, you know?</p>
<p>And then there was this other man.</p>
<p>There was a riot somewhere in Ensenada,</p>
<p>the municipality of Ensenada and Baja.</p>
<p>They were protesting.</p>
<p>Some of the people that pick those fields down there,</p>
<p>part of a tribe called Los Trikis.</p>
<p>Very hardy, hardworking people, but nefarious people too.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty good at their thing.</p>
<p>There was a right line they couldn&rsquo;t break.</p>
<p>And this old man walks in the middle of the right line</p>
<p>and yells grenade and throws an avocado</p>
<p>in the middle of all the cops.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you broke that right line with an avocado.</p>
<p>That could have gone wrong in so many ways.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s small lessons there.</p>
<p>There is a case to be made about social engineering,</p>
<p>about learning about behavior, about learning how to lie</p>
<p>and how to kind of move your way</p>
<p>or navigate your way around situations like that.</p>
<p>Small things like bartering,</p>
<p>knowing how to bribe people in conflict zones</p>
<p>is the thing that I show when I talk about</p>
<p>or train people to work in hostile environments.</p>
<p>De-escalation, specifically kind of figuring out</p>
<p>what is a value in the environment,</p>
<p>what things you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing in an environment</p>
<p>that might be considered disrespectful or out of place.</p>
<p>People have a tendency that it didn&rsquo;t grow up</p>
<p>in places that are violent</p>
<p>to make continuous eye contact with somebody</p>
<p>that might be a issue or smiling</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s nothing to smile about.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a picture I saw somewhere</p>
<p>of Russians taking a portrait and there&rsquo;s Americans there</p>
<p>and the Americans are smiling, but the Russians aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Because what is there to smile about, which is true.</p>
<p>And of course it&rsquo;s not as simple as smile or not smile.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s subtlety to it, like you said.</p>
<p>Eye contact is a super interesting one</p>
<p>because I found in my own life,</p>
<p>like not making eye contact is,</p>
<p>the people would be joking,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really powerful way to de-escalate.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s such a fascinating thing though,</p>
<p>because you could talk about drunk fights</p>
<p>that are just, that are harmless,</p>
<p>but I feel like the same dynamic applies</p>
<p>to the most violent conflict, including wars.</p>
<p>I feel like ego is part of this.</p>
<p>So to me, the question of conflict,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a street fight or anything else,</p>
<p>is the calculus of, are you willing to take an L</p>
<p>in terms of psychology?</p>
<p>Somebody grabs your wife&rsquo;s ass, you mentioned.</p>
<p>Boy, if you let that happen, you go home,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to pay the price</p>
<p>of you were the person who didn&rsquo;t define you.</p>
<p>Like in your relationship,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t defend your wife&rsquo;s honor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna psychologically pay that price yourself.</p>
<p>And depending on your wife,</p>
<p>she might secretly also lose a little bit of respect for you.</p>
<p>Now, how do you play that calculus?</p>
<p>Because now we see the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>I would say there is elements of similar posturing</p>
<p>in the United States, in Europe, in Ukraine, Russia, China,</p>
<p>leadership, at a geopolitics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still somebody grabs somebody&rsquo;s ass</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not backing down.</p>
<p>So to take those losses and basically just posture,</p>
<p>lower your head and live to fight another day</p>
<p>type of situation.</p>
<p>The thing with modern violence is the access to weaponry.</p>
<p>I mean, again, nobody owns life,</p>
<p>but anybody that can hold a frying pan can own death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people get double leg takedown</p>
<p>somebody on the ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different thing doing in the mats versus concrete.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to kill somebody.</p>
<p>The most prolific impact weapon on the planet</p>
<p>is the planet itself.</p>
<p>You can see various videos of people online</p>
<p>where they fall and they hit their head</p>
<p>or somebody hits their head</p>
<p>and they go into the stretched out fit basically.</p>
<p>And that might not kill you then,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll kill you that night or the second night</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t get checked out.</p>
<p>People bleed out internally, get an edema.</p>
<p>Again, the whole aspect of me showing</p>
<p>how some of these things,</p>
<p>not only some of these methodologies</p>
<p>and some how people prepare for violence</p>
<p>and how people experience violence,</p>
<p>how they make their weapons,</p>
<p>how the people fight in the streets and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to recognize that behavior from the inception.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a video I show where there&rsquo;s a bunch of street kids</p>
<p>in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s during the Olympics</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re snatching chains and cell phones from people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a fun video, see it.</p>
<p>The first thing you learn about it</p>
<p>is how they target people.</p>
<p>Now, who are they going after?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people there.</p>
<p>Why are they going after that specific person?</p>
<p>And they start learning about profiling</p>
<p>and how they identify victim mentality</p>
<p>or the perfect victim.</p>
<p>Lack of awareness, they keep on a straight line,</p>
<p>avoidance, avoidance of eye contact</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re doing something nefarious or wrong</p>
<p>and how they pick who they&rsquo;re gonna go after.</p>
<p>The small people, the women, even some of the men,</p>
<p>and they separate the men that they&rsquo;re perfect victims</p>
<p>versus the men that&rsquo;s gonna turn around</p>
<p>and punch them in the face.</p>
<p>What are they looking for?</p>
<p>Well, first off, you notice that the men</p>
<p>that are in that environment that look at them</p>
<p>and are aware of their presence, the hyper-aware</p>
<p>are the ones that are not good to target.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first lesson there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably a good idea not only to be hyper-aware,</p>
<p>but to recognize that hyper-awareness in others</p>
<p>if I wanna separate myself from the victim crowd.</p>
<p>Another thing you notice is these are kids</p>
<p>going after some grown adults.</p>
<p>And some of these grown adult men are with women.</p>
<p>And you see them kind of getting outside of the grasp</p>
<p>of these kids that are trying to rip their chains</p>
<p>off their neck or their cell phones.</p>
<p>And they have no consideration for the women around them.</p>
<p>You see other men that are with women</p>
<p>and you see them grab the women and put them behind them.</p>
<p>And immediately they&rsquo;ll say, this is the wrong one.</p>
<p>Let me move off to the next one.</p>
<p>So that small little lesson in those videos</p>
<p>will show you first how these kids are growing up</p>
<p>to profile and target who the perfect victims are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a school for them.</p>
<p>And that is an adversarial school.</p>
<p>We should look at that school and apply it to ourselves.</p>
<p>So in general, you think conflict,</p>
<p>ultimately the people that are doing conflict</p>
<p>are looking for weakness?</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re looking for opportunity, opportunistic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the predators, that&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>They look for an opportunity, you know,</p>
<p>from jumping down from a tree</p>
<p>and getting the slowest gazelle</p>
<p>to looking for the opportune moment</p>
<p>to pounce on something that&rsquo;s probably big,</p>
<p>but the risk is worth it.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s several motivations,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t there also a power hierarchy motivation as well?</p>
<p>Like you, there&rsquo;s something about the big guy</p>
<p>that tempts you to send a message,</p>
<p>especially with gangs, aren&rsquo;t they constantly</p>
<p>sort of trying to signal that they&rsquo;re the alpha?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a different situation.</p>
<p>So you could be facing a sociopathic predator</p>
<p>who is looking for something in you</p>
<p>that you are the resource that they&rsquo;re looking after.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a woman, you know.</p>
<p>It could be a group of people that don&rsquo;t like the fact</p>
<p>that you have a specific nationality</p>
<p>or your passport is stamped in a specific way</p>
<p>or that you pray to whatever God.</p>
<p>All these factor in,</p>
<p>but in the end, they all do the same thing.</p>
<p>They look for an advantageous position.</p>
<p>If I were to target you,</p>
<p>I would put you in between that wall and, you know, me.</p>
<p>So you have two avenues of exits</p>
<p>and I would step on one of your feet</p>
<p>to keep that avenue closed.</p>
<p>So you have to go this way.</p>
<p>So this is where my knife is gonna be.</p>
<p>You see that behavior mirrored everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>First off, you look for advantages, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s unavoidable,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re in between me and my ability to go home</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in between me and my ability to feed my family</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in between me and my ability to posture</p>
<p>to the people that are behind me,</p>
<p>the young guys that I&rsquo;m in charge,</p>
<p>I will do everything in my power to end you, right?</p>
<p>So the motivations are not in my realm,</p>
<p>but the ways they do it are, you know,</p>
<p>and basically the advantage part of it.</p>
<p>So desperation is dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dangerous school.</p>
<p>And when I say dangerous school,</p>
<p>I mean the most dangerous people</p>
<p>usually come from those desperate environments.</p>
<p>You know, you can have people in Coronado</p>
<p>holding onto logs in the ocean</p>
<p>and go through this millions of dollars worth of training</p>
<p>and just be professional killers for the government</p>
<p>and just be these incredible human beings.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a kid that will walk up to one of them</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s off, you know,</p>
<p>and put an ice pick right into his chest</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s least expecting it.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean that one is superior than the other.</p>
<p>It just means that there are more,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s more than one way to become that, you know.</p>
<p>Teenagers terrify me.</p>
<p>It feels like the intensity of desperation,</p>
<p>like the capacity of a teenager, like 16, 17,</p>
<p>to be desperate and also not have the matured understanding</p>
<p>of ethics of the world.</p>
<p>Like they have this intensity of feeling</p>
<p>that is unlike anything else.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a volume knob to that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a garden hose without a nozzle on it</p>
<p>so you can regulate it.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t developed that.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t learned that maybe from somebody else</p>
<p>or it used to be warrior cultures,</p>
<p>you would be apprentice under somebody</p>
<p>or you would learn some of these things from other people.</p>
<p>Even some gang, modern gangs have a little bit of that.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not, and you&rsquo;re just this kid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been playing Call of Duty all of his life</p>
<p>or has been witnessing violence in media</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no sense of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a bad idea to go off and do this</p>
<p>because of all these repercussions.</p>
<p>I could see how that could be a danger to society.</p>
<p>And some of the volume knobs,</p>
<p>some of the countermeasures to people exploding</p>
<p>on somebody else with a weapon,</p>
<p>you see videos constantly online.</p>
<p>I remember seeing this one of these two teenage girls</p>
<p>somewhere in the US and one of them just,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fight, there&rsquo;s a hair pulling competition</p>
<p>and all of a sudden one of them takes out a knife</p>
<p>and it just happens like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just pure and restrained downward stabbing.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re like, wait, where&rsquo;s that come from?</p>
<p>Well, she&rsquo;s from an environment</p>
<p>where she saw that as an option.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t see the repercussions of it</p>
<p>and she found herself in a place</p>
<p>where she thought that was the only viable option,</p>
<p>pulling out a weapon.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the dangerous part of it.</p>
<p>So how do you prepare to win those kinds of situations,</p>
<p>to escape those kinds of situations?</p>
<p>Like you said, it&rsquo;s training, it&rsquo;s exposing your mind.</p>
<p>I always tell people, if you don&rsquo;t have a combative base,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a base, boxing, jujitsu.</p>
<p>And that gives you what,</p>
<p>like an awareness of your body kind of thing?</p>
<p>It gives you an awareness of your body,</p>
<p>give you a spatial awareness.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t see the points with your peripheral vision,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t see the points of somebody&rsquo;s feet</p>
<p>in your peripheral vision,</p>
<p>they are in range to stab you in the heart</p>
<p>if they wanted to.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something you learn from boxing,</p>
<p>that you learn from jujitsu,</p>
<p>you learn from a bunch of combat arts</p>
<p>where you learn about distance and angling people.</p>
<p>That comes from this experience that you have.</p>
<p>Again, a lot of these things were just horseplay</p>
<p>when we were growing up in some cultures</p>
<p>or rough and tumble with your brothers and shit like that.</p>
<p>But some of us are growing up in single kid homes now</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t get that, we were missing that.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have it, then you find it in the,</p>
<p>you find it in a jujitsu gym,</p>
<p>you find it in a boxing gym,</p>
<p>you find it in a Thai boxing gym,</p>
<p>you find it in places where they specialize</p>
<p>in focusing on certain aspects</p>
<p>of this whole combative whole, right?</p>
<p>It used to be before UFC,</p>
<p>the Kung Fu Man, that Kung Fu guy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just street lethal shit.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t use it in the sporting,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t show you this because it&rsquo;ll kill you.</p>
<p>Now we pretty much know that most of that was</p>
<p>flights of fancy or BS.</p>
<p>And it pains me too, man.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn some of the D-Mach single punching</p>
<p>and killing technique.</p>
<p>I remember those books, but that&rsquo;s just not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on the lookout for that.</p>
<p>Maybe somewhere, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe if you put a pen in your hand,</p>
<p>that might turn into that, but that&rsquo;s the only way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way, right?</p>
<p>But a lot of these myths are kind of like faded away.</p>
<p>Now you see people that have different combative bases</p>
<p>combining them all and becoming a fighter.</p>
<p>Now, UFC fight, two people fighting each other</p>
<p>is one thing.</p>
<p>You being in the middle of the Portland riots</p>
<p>and a bunch of state troopers throwing gas at rioters</p>
<p>and then rioters themselves fighting each other</p>
<p>and you finding yourself in the middle of that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a completely different thing.</p>
<p>And if you think you&rsquo;re gonna go on the ground</p>
<p>and get in a guard with a guy swinging around a shovel,</p>
<p>a piece of a shovel handle, right?</p>
<p>As tear gas is going on, because you got stopped there</p>
<p>and your car was, windows were broken</p>
<p>and your family&rsquo;s in the backseat.</p>
<p>That is a different situation.</p>
<p>So, medical, learning about weaponry.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t really like fighting on the ground,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why I forced myself to go to train</p>
<p>with different people out there, on the ground.</p>
<p>Jiu-jitsu, catch wrestling.</p>
<p>So top and bottom, neither, you don&rsquo;t like either.</p>
<p>Personally, I like being in a car</p>
<p>and running everybody over.</p>
<p>That would be great, if I could, or driving really far away.</p>
<p>Or I had this experience in Utah,</p>
<p>some friends of mine, military, some of your best shooters,</p>
<p>some of the best shooters in the US</p>
<p>coming from the Marine Corps were showing me</p>
<p>how they would shoot something from really far away.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, you don&rsquo;t even have to be</p>
<p>in the same vicinity.</p>
<p>The scope of violence, how far you can be from it</p>
<p>or how close you could be from it.</p>
<p>Just wait till we get to see what we could do</p>
<p>in the cyber attack world.</p>
<p>We can destroy your whole wellbeing,</p>
<p>your whole life, your identity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another aspect of it too.</p>
<p>Financial, and then figure out where you live,</p>
<p>in terms of ambush.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Figuring out everything about you,</p>
<p>such that hurting you is easy.</p>
<p>I have a class where we specifically work</p>
<p>on social engineering and kind of how you can go</p>
<p>about something at a micro level.</p>
<p>I do a class with a guy named Matt Fidler,</p>
<p>who does, basically, he&rsquo;s one of the premier experts</p>
<p>on how to get into and bypass locks, basically.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll show you how to open up every single,</p>
<p>bypass every single commercial lock available</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll spread it out and it&rsquo;ll open up everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like, right?</p>
<p>And my part in his class is I talk about</p>
<p>how you can pull some of that off in a public space</p>
<p>and not get caught, or how you would employ</p>
<p>some of these things in a context where it&rsquo;s useful</p>
<p>for law enforcement, for the military, stuff like that.</p>
<p>And so we have this exercise in a public space</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a bunch of padlocks in the environment.</p>
<p>We paint them pink so people know it&rsquo;s our padlocks</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not breaking into anybody else&rsquo;s padlocks</p>
<p>if we get approached and asked about it.</p>
<p>But I ask the students, like,</p>
<p>so you have to gather all these padlocks</p>
<p>from this public space, you know?</p>
<p>So how would you do it?</p>
<p>So a lot of them are trying to pick them.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re like very suspiciously picking them</p>
<p>and stuff like that, that you get caught,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a whole situation.</p>
<p>But the smart ones will basically develop</p>
<p>a social media campaign related to the padlocks, right?</p>
<p>A beautiful example of this,</p>
<p>and this actually happened here in Texas.</p>
<p>I did a class out in Dallas.</p>
<p>We put the padlocks all over this public mall,</p>
<p>and the students basically came up</p>
<p>with a breast cancer awareness campaign online</p>
<p>that they made fake, well, they made flyers for it.</p>
<p>They did the social media page on a campaign.</p>
<p>They did this email chain.</p>
<p>So when they went there, people were expecting them.</p>
<p>So they normalized the behavior through social media,</p>
<p>and they were walking around with bowl cutters</p>
<p>in the middle of the mall, cutting these things off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful, that&rsquo;s a beautiful solution</p>
<p>to a complex problem of that nature.</p>
<p>And again, the weaponizing part of it.</p>
<p>Anything can be, all knowledge can be weaponized.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, if you focus on getting in a street fight</p>
<p>with somebody with your fist or a knife, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing out on the whole complexity of violence</p>
<p>and the way that it&rsquo;s now being utilized.</p>
<p>So in terms of breaking out locks,</p>
<p>and the restraints, and captivity,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about a dark topic</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re one of the world experts in, kidnapping.</p>
<p>So you teach courses on counter kidnapping and terrorism.</p>
<p>I read an estimate that criminal gangs</p>
<p>get $500 million a year in ransom payments from kidnapping.</p>
<p>So just at a high level, what is kidnapping,</p>
<p>who does it, and why?</p>
<p>What are some insights that can help us understand</p>
<p>what is this problem in the world?</p>
<p>It happens in different ways</p>
<p>in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>I mean, I just sent off a group of people</p>
<p>that trained some of the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>And some of the stuff that they were showing them</p>
<p>was some of the counter custody stuff that I showed them.</p>
<p>A friend of mine named Vince went out there,</p>
<p>was showing them some of the aspects</p>
<p>of how to utilize things like Kevlar cordage</p>
<p>and how to infuse it in their uniform.</p>
<p>So if they get a zip tie to cut them open,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a war setting.</p>
<p>So it talks about being captive in a war zone.</p>
<p>But the information or the methodology</p>
<p>actually comes from Mexico.</p>
<p>That methodology, as far as how I learned it.</p>
<p>In terms of how to escape from restraints and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So in Mexico, you have abductions happening</p>
<p>where cartels who hold control over a specific place or zone</p>
<p>are having a hard time with financial situations,</p>
<p>as far as maybe they&rsquo;re not making enough money</p>
<p>to pay everybody off.</p>
<p>So they let them freelance, basically.</p>
<p>And a lot of ways, some of these criminal groups freelance</p>
<p>or some of these groups actually professionalize</p>
<p>and to abduct businessmen, abduct the sons of businessmen</p>
<p>or people that have money to ask for ransoms for them,</p>
<p>basically.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve taken captivity and abduction</p>
<p>to like an art form in places like Mexico.</p>
<p>And it has a history all over the world,</p>
<p>but specifically my experience with it</p>
<p>was going to cartel safe houses</p>
<p>that turned into holding places.</p>
<p>You would see, you know, homemade prison cells</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And people being held in captivity for months, if not years</p>
<p>as they were milking their family for everything they owned.</p>
<p>So it turns out into a business,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not actually even interested in hurting the people.</p>
<p>Physically, they&rsquo;re interested in hurting them financially.</p>
<p>Financially and also this, if they get hurt,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hurt for a purpose,</p>
<p>which is to make their family pay up faster or more.</p>
<p>Some of the abduction groups that I&rsquo;ve seen out there,</p>
<p>professional ones in Mexico,</p>
<p>basically make it a living to target people</p>
<p>that have abduction insurance or that work for companies</p>
<p>that have good abduction insurance.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like an ATM for them, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, ah, here again, huh?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some of that going on.</p>
<p>Some, not so much.</p>
<p>Some abductions are express.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll grab you with a gunpoint,</p>
<p>take you to an ATM, you empty it out</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re on your way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an express kidnapping.</p>
<p>That might not be worth you doing anything insane,</p>
<p>you know, you just go with the motions.</p>
<p>But some people do get picked up.</p>
<p>I have trained people with prior experiences of abductions</p>
<p>in Mexico and here in the United States,</p>
<p>people that have spent some time in captivity</p>
<p>with loved ones here, like ex-boyfriends or boyfriends</p>
<p>that tie them up and beat the shit out of them.</p>
<p>And the restraints they utilize are zip ties and handcuffs.</p>
<p>Sometimes or duct tape or their own clothing,</p>
<p>things of this nature.</p>
<p>Basically what somebody is looking for</p>
<p>when they tie anybody up is to convince you</p>
<p>that they are in control, that they are God</p>
<p>and that any hope of you releasing those restraints</p>
<p>or getting out of that situation is hopeless.</p>
<p>From a cartel group picking you up</p>
<p>in the middle of a dirt road somewhere in Cancun</p>
<p>to ex-boyfriend showing up at your house</p>
<p>and tying you up till you agree to get back with them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>And some of the restraints that are being utilized</p>
<p>come from different places.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember an instructor I had way back when</p>
<p>told me that the proliferation of zip ties</p>
<p>as a restraint in criminal abductions</p>
<p>came up after the movie Heat came out</p>
<p>because everybody wanted to be Robert De Niro</p>
<p>zip tying people in the bank robbery</p>
<p>at the end of the movie.</p>
<p>Criminals saw that and it became a thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Can you actually speak to the,</p>
<p>is it possible to systematically learn</p>
<p>how to escape restraints like handcuffs, rope, zip ties?</p>
<p>The best at it are not the military.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not SEER program people.</p>
<p>They are criminals.</p>
<p>I learned how to get out of handcuffs from a 15-year-old</p>
<p>who was in charge of meth sales</p>
<p>in La Avenida Revoluci√≥n in Tijuana.</p>
<p>Is there a system to it?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not specifically a system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually what happens is they&rsquo;ll buy a set of handcuffs</p>
<p>and they will mess around with them in a playing feature.</p>
<p>So one thing I do in a class is first off,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honest about the fact that some,</p>
<p>all the restraints are temporary, even marriage.</p>
<p>This is, wait, can we just pause in the deep philosophical?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like Miyamoto Musashi with that statement.</p>
<p>All restraints are temporary, even marriage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just, I just like adding that one in there for last</p>
<p>because this is a dark subject.</p>
<p>Every cage can be escaped.</p>
<p>All restraints are temporary.</p>
<p>You either free yourselves from the restraints,</p>
<p>somebody else takes them off,</p>
<p>or you die and your body rots away around them.</p>
<p>Those are the options.</p>
<p>And I like that first option myself.</p>
<p>The second option is pretty cool</p>
<p>if you can convince somebody to do that for you.</p>
<p>But that first option is an interesting one.</p>
<p>You have to deconstruct restraints.</p>
<p>Not all restraints are made the same.</p>
<p>You can train to get out of handcuffs here in the US</p>
<p>and focus on a pair of Smith &amp; Wesson handcuffs,</p>
<p>which are kind of the most common brand of handcuffs here.</p>
<p>But if you find yourself in detention somewhere in Russia,</p>
<p>the handcuffs out there are completely different.</p>
<p>The key way is different.</p>
<p>The mechanism is different.</p>
<p>But some of the same ways of bypassing those mechanisms are-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna write this down.</p>
<p>So in Russia, what kind are they using in Russia?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna travel in there, they need this information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you a specific model</p>
<p>and details on how to get out of those.</p>
<p>But basically-</p>
<p>Just asking for a friend, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>So what I do is I take a pair of Smith &amp; Wesson handcuffs,</p>
<p>I put them in the middle of three people in a class,</p>
<p>I spread them out,</p>
<p>and I have them place them on each other</p>
<p>in a just playing manner.</p>
<p>I have handcuffs keys there</p>
<p>and I have a pair of bolt cutters there</p>
<p>in case somebody gets stuck, does something stupid.</p>
<p>So they play with each other</p>
<p>as far as putting them on randomly.</p>
<p>I show them how to put them on appropriately.</p>
<p>And then I show them a handcuff key</p>
<p>and a handcuff key will open up handcuffs,</p>
<p>interestingly enough.</p>
<p>But the thing about a handcuff key is it&rsquo;s not made</p>
<p>to be used by the person that is in those handcuffs.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first lesson there.</p>
<p>If you have a handcuff key,</p>
<p>handcuff keys are the most used tool to open up handcuffs</p>
<p>in custody situations.</p>
<p>Both criminals escaping from the police</p>
<p>to people escaping from criminals.</p>
<p>Just a standard hidden handcuff key.</p>
<p>So I show them how to modify the handcuff key</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s more optimal to use on yourself</p>
<p>with just basic garbage that you can find.</p>
<p>Piece of wire, a zip tie piece,</p>
<p>basically how to put a leverage arm on the handcuff key</p>
<p>so you can actually spin it in the key way,</p>
<p>behind your back or in front of you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Appropriate way to handcuff somebody is palms out.</p>
<p>How much restriction is there in terms of-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a hinge handcuff, there&rsquo;s a lot of restriction.</p>
<p>With no chain in the middle.</p>
<p>Can you reach back?</p>
<p>You could try and reach back</p>
<p>or you can basically put yourself</p>
<p>in a not compromised position</p>
<p>and feed the most of your palm meat into the handcuff way</p>
<p>so when they shut it on you,</p>
<p>you have more space to work with.</p>
<p>So you can spin your hand.</p>
<p>We call it a passive resistance.</p>
<p>Again, you go through a process with them</p>
<p>where you deconstruct how people are handcuffed.</p>
<p>Handcuff keys and how to modify handcuff key</p>
<p>to be able to use on yourself.</p>
<p>And these, all of these things</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re constructing as we go.</p>
<p>So they basically, hey, what&rsquo;s a grinding surface?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s concrete outside.</p>
<p>So they grind an angle on the key</p>
<p>so you can get a key not to go straight into the key way</p>
<p>but you can get it into the key way at an angle,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that is out there as far as a method.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t spin a key behind your back</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s small.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to be used by somebody else</p>
<p>opening those handcuffs on you.</p>
<p>So you put an arm on it so you can leverage our arm</p>
<p>so you can spin it behind your back.</p>
<p>You learn how to put yourself</p>
<p>in not a compromised position.</p>
<p>If somebody asks you for your hands</p>
<p>so they could be cuffed,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do this, you know, you do that</p>
<p>or you put yourself in a cable grip behind your back</p>
<p>which is a pretty strong grip</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to spread those hands apart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also something that people go into automatically</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in fear.</p>
<p>So all of these things are advantageous for you.</p>
<p>And you learn how not only people get restrained</p>
<p>but you see videos of them</p>
<p>because I show a bunch of abduction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually happening live.</p>
<p>Again, the best thing is avoidance</p>
<p>but specifically when you work around restraints</p>
<p>is number one, learn how some of these restraints work.</p>
<p>Number two is learning how some of the ready-made tools</p>
<p>to get out of the restraints look like function.</p>
<p>And number three, which is the advanced level</p>
<p>is learn how to construct all of these things yourself</p>
<p>which is, I think that is the best thing</p>
<p>you can show somebody.</p>
<p>For handcuffs, I just use a standard pair of handcuffs</p>
<p>and then we deconstruct other very specialized handcuffs</p>
<p>that might be out there and you show them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna travel somewhere,</p>
<p>learn what restraints are commonly available</p>
<p>in the environment.</p>
<p>Somebody going to North Sub-Saharan Africa</p>
<p>carrying a plastic handcuff key,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be useless out there</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not gonna be standard handcuffs out there</p>
<p>that would be open with that type of key.</p>
<p>Out there, you&rsquo;re probably gonna be tied up</p>
<p>with a chain and a padlock of some sort,</p>
<p>maybe a 40 millimeter Chinese padlock</p>
<p>with a plastic core that you can open with a lighter</p>
<p>if you can burn the core, melt the core open.</p>
<p>Or if you can leverage that open,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pretty easy thing to open.</p>
<p>Or a bobby pin, you could reach all the way in the back</p>
<p>and open the latch.</p>
<p>What about rope, is that common?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is common.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite things for rope.</p>
<p>Something I usually carry in some places.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another gift for you if you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ceramic razor blade.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Is it capable of cutting?</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Small, you can put it behind a label.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some students put the Levi&rsquo;s label on there</p>
<p>and just sew it back on.</p>
<p>It is non-magnetic, non-ferrous.</p>
<p>So in and out of that type of situation,</p>
<p>you can get in it and it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>you can have with you everywhere.</p>
<p>This is a pretty fancy one,</p>
<p>or you can just grab a simple razor blade.</p>
<p>Actually learning how to use or leverage a razor blade</p>
<p>between your palms and know how to go up and down with it.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s just practice to do that well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s practice and it&rsquo;s also exposure to just,</p>
<p>this is a possibility, this is how you could hide it.</p>
<p>Again, the whole smuggling aspect</p>
<p>comes from a criminal mindset type setting.</p>
<p>So how things are hidden, where they&rsquo;re hidden.</p>
<p>And when I talk about concealing objects of this nature,</p>
<p>it usually comes from smuggling.</p>
<p>The fact that I have something in a notebook</p>
<p>comes from heroin smuggling.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not looking at the school of criminality,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing out on a big part of the equation.</p>
<p>So for people who wanna learn about this,</p>
<p>do you teach courses on this?</p>
<p>Do you know what&rsquo;s the, how do they get in touch with you</p>
<p>or learn from you?</p>
<p>Do you have stuff online or is it only in person?</p>
<p>So I have some stuff on my Patreon specifically.</p>
<p>I have a Patreon where I share a lot of the online material.</p>
<p>Basically a bunch of, this is my notebook.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of stuff that I,</p>
<p>I just met somebody in Philadelphia</p>
<p>that showed me a pretty unique way</p>
<p>of utilizing a box cutter as a weapon.</p>
<p>So I wrote some of that down and filmed some of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not for any other reason.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to create dangerous people out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, look at this.</p>
<p>This is something that&rsquo;s out there, right?</p>
<p>So a lot of that information,</p>
<p>some of those notes and stuff like that,</p>
<p>I keep on my Patreon.</p>
<p>I used to share it openly on Facebook and Instagram,</p>
<p>but that has not been possible anymore.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a member of your Patreon</p>
<p>and I recommend people sign up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really great.</p>
<p>Because you also have philosophy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the Mexican Miyamoto Musashi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the skills,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also the philosophy around it.</p>
<p>Like I got that book of five rings</p>
<p>before I went into training.</p>
<p>Like I took that with me through training.</p>
<p>The whole aspect of, you know,</p>
<p>go to places frightening to the common brand of men.</p>
<p>You know, be put in jail</p>
<p>and extricate yourself with your own wisdom.</p>
<p>I think he was speaking about experiencing experience.</p>
<p>You know, the whole warrior&rsquo;s journey,</p>
<p>the hero&rsquo;s journey of going out there and actually risking.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a pretty big basis and aspect</p>
<p>of what the work I do and showing some of these things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tendency to people that say,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m afraid to go to Mexico.</p>
<p>What do I need to know?</p>
<p>Like, well, if you&rsquo;re afraid to go to Mexico,</p>
<p>go to Mexico.</p>
<p>I mean, I was in Detroit.</p>
<p>I was pretty afraid when I was in Detroit</p>
<p>and some parts of Detroit and the South side of Chicago.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to be dictated where I can go</p>
<p>and where I can&rsquo;t go because of safety.</p>
<p>I want to take responsibility for that myself</p>
<p>and figure out ways of being more capable</p>
<p>and an asset to the people around me and myself.</p>
<p>And that comes from experience.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t want to risk getting a shoulder injury,</p>
<p>rolling in jujitsu,</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t want to risk getting a bloody nose in boxing.</p>
<p>But that is the way.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s some aspect to fitting in.</p>
<p>You quote Hattori Hanzo on imitation.</p>
<p>The most important thing you should keep in mind</p>
<p>when you go on a Shinobi mission</p>
<p>is to imitate well the language of the target province</p>
<p>and the ways of the local people.</p>
<p>This includes their appearances,</p>
<p>the way of wearing clothes,</p>
<p>the way of shaving their head,</p>
<p>the way of making up their hair,</p>
<p>the way of making up a sword or short sword,</p>
<p>and the way of refinement and luxury.</p>
<p>So how do you fit into some of those places?</p>
<p>So you know Mexico,</p>
<p>but a person like me that doesn&rsquo;t know anything about Mexico</p>
<p>and say I&rsquo;m interviewing somebody in a leadership position</p>
<p>in a drug cartel.</p>
<p>How quickly do you learn how to fit in?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not about fitting in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about coming up with a narrative for yourself.</p>
<p>What that book is talking,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a quote from the book called a Shoninki,</p>
<p>which is like an actual legit ninja manual</p>
<p>from like the 1500s or something like that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not talking about blending in,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about creating a narrative or a lie</p>
<p>to your appearance and your behavior</p>
<p>and your knowledge base.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So I would say first,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna go to a place like that,</p>
<p>first off, learn what is common there,</p>
<p>what type of common restraints might be placed on you,</p>
<p>what criminal groups work out there,</p>
<p>what type of guns they have.</p>
<p>Not only what type of guns they have,</p>
<p>but go to the gun range in Vegas</p>
<p>and learn how to fire some of these firearms yourself</p>
<p>so you know how to load them</p>
<p>in case you run into a bad situation.</p>
<p>How they tie the sword,</p>
<p>how they wear their short swords</p>
<p>could equate to how, you know,</p>
<p>if you run into some issues.</p>
<p>Also, it would give you a good idea</p>
<p>how many rounds those hold</p>
<p>so you can run at the right moment.</p>
<p>I like how you focus in on the tools of violence.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the social engineering de-escalation, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you are in an environment like that</p>
<p>and you are carrying around a camera,</p>
<p>that might be an issue.</p>
<p>Or the opposite, it might not be an issue.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re asked like,</p>
<p>were you with the news organization</p>
<p>or am I with a Christian aid group here?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if you are with a Christian aid group,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to learn some of the Bible, right?</p>
<p>If you want a quick way of having somebody out there</p>
<p>try and stop talking to you,</p>
<p>you can start talking about Jesus</p>
<p>in the middle of a little cartel territory</p>
<p>when they approach you and take out the Bible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll quickly de-escalate.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a good time to contact.</p>
<p>What I usually prefer to do</p>
<p>is I find somebody from the New York Times</p>
<p>and the Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>and beat them up in front of the,</p>
<p>just to send a signal that I&rsquo;m not a journalist</p>
<p>and I too don&rsquo;t like journalists.</p>
<p>That could be a way, but-</p>
<p>To send a message.</p>
<p>I think a lot of us miss the fact</p>
<p>that we are capable of taking control of our own narrative</p>
<p>and what we communicate to people around us.</p>
<p>I could show up here drinking a Monster Energy drink,</p>
<p>dumping it on the ground, scratching you know what,</p>
<p>then just sit down and just be a rude motherfucker.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not who I am, but I can do that.</p>
<p>And you will believe me if I am good at it.</p>
<p>Some of us miss the, some of us don&rsquo;t know this aspect</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something we consider predatory</p>
<p>or something that is wrong or negative or bad.</p>
<p>And some of these aspects are actually,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re pretty useful.</p>
<p>I learned most of my trade craft and skill craft</p>
<p>from panhandlers and street performers.</p>
<p>And when I had some training related to social engineering,</p>
<p>those were the people that I learned from.</p>
<p>I remember we were doing surveillance</p>
<p>and there was a guy there that showed us</p>
<p>how to do surveillance, you know, on the street.</p>
<p>And he said,</p>
<p>if you can find a way for somebody to smell you</p>
<p>before they see you, you&rsquo;ll become invisible.</p>
<p>And I was like, that&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>If you can find a way of somebody smelling you</p>
<p>before they see you become invisible.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand what that meant.</p>
<p>So we went on a three day bender, didn&rsquo;t take a shower,</p>
<p>smell like shit, no deodorant.</p>
<p>You know, you smell like a homeless person.</p>
<p>You look like a homeless person.</p>
<p>And you approach somebody asking for the time</p>
<p>and they smell you before they see you.</p>
<p>And you are not there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a human, you don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>So that was a pretty valuable lesson that I got there.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But like, I have this belief,</p>
<p>it has to do with the way I operate in this world,</p>
<p>I suppose, but if you come off as a person legitimately,</p>
<p>I guess you could fake it, but I think it just feels like</p>
<p>you can be extremely good, possibly the best in the world,</p>
<p>if you practice it your whole life, at being you.</p>
<p>At being authentic, at being,</p>
<p>at showing like you have nothing to hide.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>A true believer, is what I, a true believer.</p>
<p>So like, yes, you can come up with a fake narrative,</p>
<p>but then what I mean is like,</p>
<p>live that narrative your whole life then.</p>
<p>Would be, like.</p>
<p>Yeah, I understand.</p>
<p>And then never falter from that.</p>
<p>Like, you are this person, that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to, I have nothing to hide.</p>
<p>I consider that a true believer,</p>
<p>and yeah, that is a unique person when you meet them,</p>
<p>and they are out there.</p>
<p>There are people that will fucking walk into places.</p>
<p>This is who I am, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>This is who I am, if you don&rsquo;t trust me,</p>
<p>well, shoot me, fuck it.</p>
<p>This is my honesty, and if you don&rsquo;t trust me,</p>
<p>well, look at all these people that I&rsquo;ve interacted with</p>
<p>in the past, and you can ask them about it,</p>
<p>or you can see my effects on other people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be my presentation card.</p>
<p>And so the way you said it now is using words,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s blunt, usually if somebody&rsquo;s blunt like that,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m a no bullshit person, that means they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That means they&rsquo;re a full of shit, actually.</p>
<p>You do that through, I mean, I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m verbalizing your behavior, just walking somewhere.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re going to interview</p>
<p>somebody very dangerous down there,</p>
<p>and you walk into a room without worry.</p>
<p>That is a presentation to you.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s a pretty interesting introduction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a threat because you don&rsquo;t consider yourself</p>
<p>a threat, and you&rsquo;re walking in there with the confidence</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t consider yourself a threat,</p>
<p>which is an interesting way of going about it.</p>
<p>My life experiences has been different.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t programmed that way from an early age,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard for me to go into that line.</p>
<p>Although more and more as I get older,</p>
<p>and as I learn more about the world,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve failed a few more times,</p>
<p>I can understand or more cognizant of the fact</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t really have to try that much</p>
<p>if you believe in yourself and who you are.</p>
<p>If you know yourself, I think that is at the core of it.</p>
<p>If you know yourself enough to be able</p>
<p>to kind of communicate that to people around you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not hiding from yourself</p>
<p>or from the world your flaws, too.</p>
<p>That was the other thing you spoke to</p>
<p>that is probably inspiring to others</p>
<p>is being honest about your flaws,</p>
<p>about your weaknesses as a human being.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pickpocket a naked man.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really brilliant.</p>
<p>If you know how to be naked,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m not there.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m working towards that</p>
<p>just by hopefully going through shit</p>
<p>and showing people, not telling them.</p>
<p>Is it show me, don&rsquo;t tell me</p>
<p>is another valuable lesson that I got long ago.</p>
<p>I travel across the country,</p>
<p>and I not only get to show people what I know how to do,</p>
<p>but I give examples of it through things that I do out there.</p>
<p>And I say this a lot.</p>
<p>When I travel out there, I&rsquo;m never alone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s couches out there waiting for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s homes that I can go and stay at</p>
<p>and friends that I have out there</p>
<p>that I have never even met.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s been about me,</p>
<p>not only wearing some of those mistakes</p>
<p>and past failures on my sleeve,</p>
<p>but also turning them into lessons for people.</p>
<p>And just telling people the fact that</p>
<p>I know how to do all this weird stuff,</p>
<p>and I show people how to do it.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s a bunch of weird memes</p>
<p>that are very humorous about my culture</p>
<p>and about going through therapy.</p>
<p>And this is me doing something goofy.</p>
<p>And this is me being an idiot</p>
<p>in front of all you guys as well.</p>
<p>This is me being the fool.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s another aspect of it.</p>
<p>I love that as part of that journey,</p>
<p>you made enemies with the rodeo clown</p>
<p>and made up with him afterwards.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re still in a very toxic relationship.</p>
<p>He knows who he is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably out there listening.</p>
<p>Love and hate all there.</p>
<p>We stopped talking to each other for months</p>
<p>and then just send a dick message of some sort</p>
<p>and just, we&rsquo;re back at it.</p>
<p>Back, yeah.</p>
<p>Love expressed through anger.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s therapeutic.</p>
<p>You have both very interesting career paths.</p>
<p>If we can just jump back to a really interesting topic</p>
<p>that I wanted to mention on narco-cultism.</p>
<p>What are narco-cults?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the relationship between,</p>
<p>you kind of mentioned religion a little bit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the relationship between</p>
<p>religious culture and drug culture?</p>
<p>First off, Mexico is one of the most Catholic countries</p>
<p>on the planet, if not the most Catholic country</p>
<p>on the planet.</p>
<p>Not only that, it is a country that has a root</p>
<p>in a spirituality through its ethnic culture</p>
<p>that other parts of the world got most of that taken away</p>
<p>and or suppressed or killed or taken away.</p>
<p>When the Spanish came to Mexico,</p>
<p>they were a product of a recently liberated group</p>
<p>of people.</p>
<p>They just got done being invaded by the Moors, basically.</p>
<p>And they brought with them the image</p>
<p>of La Virgen de Guadalupe, the Virgin of Guadalupe.</p>
<p>And Hernan Cortez&rsquo;s vision of that or version of that</p>
<p>was a lady holding a crystal scepter, baby Jesus,</p>
<p>and standing on a crescent moon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he brought with him to the Americas.</p>
<p>And when the conquest happened,</p>
<p>a lot of people say,</p>
<p>yeah, the Spanish came and conquested the Aztec empire.</p>
<p>The enemies of the Aztec allied themselves</p>
<p>with the Spanish and they took them down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>And then the rest was famine and sickness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what killed most of them.</p>
<p>They realized that it was gonna be hard</p>
<p>to suppress some of the spiritual practices in Mexico,</p>
<p>so they decided to meld them with Catholic iconography.</p>
<p>So you see this cult to Tuanatzin,</p>
<p>which is like a fertility variant</p>
<p>of a mother goddess in Aztec culture.</p>
<p>And they turned her into La Virgen de Guadalupe,</p>
<p>which is the icon that a lot of Mexicans venerate</p>
<p>as the La Virgen, the Virgin.</p>
<p>But in her, she conceals cultural elements from the past.</p>
<p>She has a black sash across her stomach,</p>
<p>which means she&rsquo;s pregnant,</p>
<p>something common in the Aztec culture,</p>
<p>in the Mexica culture.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s standing on a cherub that has eagle wings,</p>
<p>that is a war god.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a symbol of the war god down there.</p>
<p>She has stars on her, which is a veil of certain stars</p>
<p>that are related to some of the spiritual practices</p>
<p>from before.</p>
<p>Basically, they hid these things in that setting.</p>
<p>Now you skip forward hundreds of years</p>
<p>and you start seeing things like Malverde,</p>
<p>who was a bandit that lived in Sinaloa way back in the day.</p>
<p>He would rob rich farmers</p>
<p>that would go through the countryside.</p>
<p>One time he was almost caught and he was shot and injured</p>
<p>and he was wanted by the government.</p>
<p>So he told one of his friends to tell them where he was</p>
<p>and to give the reward money to the townspeople.</p>
<p>So he did that.</p>
<p>He was hung from a tree and the order was not to bury him,</p>
<p>just to let his body rot.</p>
<p>And his body rotted away</p>
<p>until it fell onto the ground, the bones.</p>
<p>And each of the townspeople would go over</p>
<p>and put a rock on top of his corpse</p>
<p>until it became a pile of rocks.</p>
<p>And then he started granting miracles.</p>
<p>So again, this whole aspect of these criminals</p>
<p>become insane.</p>
<p>And also a middle finger from the downward local populace</p>
<p>to the church in a way,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not a recognized saint,</p>
<p>but he has an altar and people venerate that.</p>
<p>Then you have cartels that have a spiritual practice</p>
<p>or spirituality behind what they do,</p>
<p>which is part of their culture,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also like a tool they use</p>
<p>to ingratiate themselves with the local populace</p>
<p>or the population around them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re icons of power</p>
<p>and sometimes of almost a symbol of rebellion.</p>
<p>You see El Chapo&rsquo;s son, when he was arrested,</p>
<p>had a Santo Ni√±o de Atocha on his chest,</p>
<p>which is a holy kid of Atocha.</p>
<p>The Spanish legend during the Moorish conquest,</p>
<p>they said that a statue of that saint</p>
<p>would go around and feed some of the hungry.</p>
<p>That was the legend.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a saint of the persecuted.</p>
<p>So the fact that when he was arrested,</p>
<p>he was, you see him with that, wearing that,</p>
<p>and then he was liberated is a miracle in and of itself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s proof that that works.</p>
<p>You see, that was,</p>
<p>you can find one of those scapuladios anywhere in Mexico.</p>
<p>That was the most, at least the sold one.</p>
<p>So you see them utilizing some of these aspects</p>
<p>in their own belief system as a symbol</p>
<p>or as iconography, basically,</p>
<p>for some of the things they do.</p>
<p>Then you go into some of the other aspects of it</p>
<p>that are out there, like Santa Muerte,</p>
<p>which is actually a faith that I grew up in.</p>
<p>Mexico has a weird relationship to death.</p>
<p>We have parties at the cemetery on Day of the Dead,</p>
<p>and I just went through one recently.</p>
<p>This is November the 2nd.</p>
<p>So we celebrate our dead,</p>
<p>and we celebrate death in a way</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think a lot of cultures out there do.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a joyful occasion.</p>
<p>It is a celebration, yeah.</p>
<p>My eight-year-old put two beers on an altar,</p>
<p>one for my mom, one for my brother.</p>
<p>She bought a Snickers bar for my mom</p>
<p>and a bag of Pops for my brother,</p>
<p>flower petals and marigolds,</p>
<p>and pictures of them on an altar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>What kind of beer?</p>
<p>Tecate, Tecate Roja for my mother,</p>
<p>because she was hardcore,</p>
<p>and Tecate Light for my brother.</p>
<p>He was more of an endurance drinker.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, for me,</p>
<p>the relationship to death down there is different.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a Nikon in Mexico.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually one of the fastest-growing</p>
<p>alternative spiritual practices in Mexico,</p>
<p>and not only in Mexico, but here in the U.S.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Santa Muerte temples across the country.</p>
<p>I found one in Connecticut, out of all places.</p>
<p>How I grew up with it, where I saw it,</p>
<p>is my family was all Guadalupanos.</p>
<p>We were Catholic, and we venerated</p>
<p>the Virgin of Guadalupe, specifically,</p>
<p>the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe.</p>
<p>But every now and then, there were winks and nods</p>
<p>to a skeletal saint in family practices.</p>
<p>And even when I went to work,</p>
<p>the older guys that I was working with</p>
<p>would tell me, like,</p>
<p>hey, we gotta go ask for protection.</p>
<p>So they would drive me over to the church,</p>
<p>and I thought I was going to the cathedral.</p>
<p>And then we made a left turn,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t the cathedral.</p>
<p>It was the market next to the cathedral in Tijuana.</p>
<p>And in the little corner,</p>
<p>there was a big Santa Muerte reaper effigy.</p>
<p>And then I knew why I had to bring a bottle of tequila.</p>
<p>I was like, why am I bringing a bottle of tequila</p>
<p>to the church?</p>
<p>It was for her, for death, la muerte.</p>
<p>It was partly hazing.</p>
<p>And also, they did believe that they were basically</p>
<p>imbued with being agents of death, in a way.</p>
<p>So it was like a cultural thing as well,</p>
<p>something that they wore on them as not only protection,</p>
<p>but as also like a samurai would wear</p>
<p>this death iconography on them,</p>
<p>or how the Maori would do haka dances.</p>
<p>To some of these guys and their kind of warrior culture</p>
<p>that they were growing up with or trying to imbue on us,</p>
<p>the young guys, they would take us there,</p>
<p>and they would imbue us with iconography of Santa Muerte</p>
<p>to be like a psychological thing.</p>
<p>So that gives you strength and meaning</p>
<p>in the face of struggle,</p>
<p>like in the face of difficulties in life?</p>
<p>I think, you know, your closeness to death</p>
<p>and having a relationship to death</p>
<p>in the form of a symbolic representation of it,</p>
<p>like Santa Muerte or an icon like that,</p>
<p>makes it not as scary, I guess.</p>
<p>Or not only that, but it&rsquo;s also something</p>
<p>that the other side, the enemy, the cartels groups,</p>
<p>they would venerate it as well.</p>
<p>So when they would see it on you,</p>
<p>it was almost debilitating to them.</p>
<p>They were like, oh, are you guys cops?</p>
<p>Are you guys, why are you wearing that?</p>
<p>So there was an aspect of that to it.</p>
<p>A momento mori type thing,</p>
<p>where, you know, remember death, you know, type thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect in which you don&rsquo;t wanna mess</p>
<p>with a person who meditates on death.</p>
<p>There was some of that, yeah.</p>
<p>There was a saying, I think they probably took it</p>
<p>from a movie or something like that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know where they got it.</p>
<p>May I earn your need and be your wrath.</p>
<p>Oh man, that&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>They would say that to the statue of La Santa, you know.</p>
<p>Another thing, people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a cartel-specific saying, though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everybody, like at all levels,</p>
<p>from the lady that sells tortillas,</p>
<p>to the cops, to the military.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some people in the military that venerate it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very specific symbol</p>
<p>of how this is like a weird relationship,</p>
<p>specifically in Santa Muerte in Mexico.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a shrine outside of Tijuana,</p>
<p>right across the La Presa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a water reservoir right outside Tijuana.</p>
<p>And there was a big Santa Muerte altar there,</p>
<p>like on the roadside.</p>
<p>And my former boss, Liza Ola, ordered that thing destroyed.</p>
<p>So he ordered a truck to destroy it.</p>
<p>It was a famous thing.</p>
<p>And it was rebuilt the next night.</p>
<p>And I know for a fact that some of the people</p>
<p>that rebuilt that were some of the same guys</p>
<p>that were there destroying it.</p>
<p>Oh man, that&rsquo;s pretty symbolic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not something that can be killed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a part of the spirit of the people.</p>
<p>It keeps getting destroyed by ultra-Christian groups</p>
<p>or Catholic groups, and it keeps getting rebuilt.</p>
<p>Personally, for me, as a, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s a reaper skeleton</p>
<p>in the sky protecting me.</p>
<p>But I do believe in the aspect of an ending, you know,</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s important to, you know,</p>
<p>the ending is important in all things,</p>
<p>and death should be present in life.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not, then you&rsquo;re delusional about things.</p>
<p>So to you, it&rsquo;s a mechanism to meditate on death once again.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, having my daughter, who&rsquo;s eight,</p>
<p>view it as a benevolent thing, you know.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a kid, and she sees a skeleton</p>
<p>that represents death, and she just does, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>I think, in a way, Mexicans have taken some of those aspects</p>
<p>to be a day of the dead, some of these practices</p>
<p>related to some occultism aspects around, you know,</p>
<p>St. Judas, you know, San Judas.</p>
<p>St. Judas is the patron saint of lost causes,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of the most venerated saints in Mexico.</p>
<p>You know, Jesus is probably the fourth or fifth</p>
<p>you pray to, which is pretty funny and ridiculous.</p>
<p>But the reason why, and this is something I heard</p>
<p>from somebody that was actually,</p>
<p>we found him with a gun, and on his gun,</p>
<p>he had a St. Judas effigy.</p>
<p>And he said, oh, like, why St. Judas?</p>
<p>Por que San Judas?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, he&rsquo;s the last saint you pray to.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Well, on the list of saints you pray to,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the last one, because when you pray to Judas,</p>
<p>you might get the other Judas on the line.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the last one you pray to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s like the lost causes saint.</p>
<p>I remember, like, even how we try and bribe</p>
<p>or, like, maneuver our way, even in spirituality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spiritual practices.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Such a fascinating culture that&rsquo;s unlike anything else.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s right next door.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s here, too.</p>
<p>Again, I found an altar in Connecticut,</p>
<p>which is pretty fascinating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one in Arizona.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s one of the fastest-growing spiritual practices</p>
<p>not only in the U.S., but, like, across.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody from Russia reached out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an altar out there,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a group of people praying to Santa Marta,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been posting and writing a lot about it recently,</p>
<p>just from my own experience</p>
<p>and some of the stuff that I gather for myself,</p>
<p>and all the way out there.</p>
<p>You know, people are fascinated by some of those aspects.</p>
<p>So I gotta ask you about the dark turn of that spirituality,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;ll place this elsewhere,</p>
<p>but who was Adolfo Costanzo?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a guy that comes up in a period,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s at that initial period of cartels.</p>
<p>This is before my time,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked to some of the people</p>
<p>that were there for some of that.</p>
<p>I mean, he kills a lot of people.</p>
<p>He was exposed and learned through his family ties</p>
<p>about some of the Afro-Caribbean spiritualities</p>
<p>that are now also exploding,</p>
<p>as far as influences across the world,</p>
<p>Latin America and in the U.S.</p>
<p>When I talk about that, I mean, Santeria,</p>
<p>Pablo Mayombe,</p>
<p>basically some old spiritual practices</p>
<p>coming out of Africa,</p>
<p>that utilize things like ngangas,</p>
<p>which are basically spiritual vessels</p>
<p>that have to be loaded with human remains in some cases.</p>
<p>He was basically a spiritual practitioner</p>
<p>that certain cartel groups would hire</p>
<p>for them to curse the other side,</p>
<p>to imbue them with invisibility,</p>
<p>to be able to transport their drugs</p>
<p>or protection spells and stuff like that.</p>
<p>He was very successful at it apparently,</p>
<p>or at least that is the experience</p>
<p>of the people paying for some of these practices.</p>
<p>As his spells and his work kept getting bigger and bigger</p>
<p>and more and more complicated,</p>
<p>the ingredients he needed for these ngangas or these spells,</p>
<p>these cauldrons that he would fill with certain elements</p>
<p>grew in complexity.</p>
<p>Till finally he said he needed the brain</p>
<p>of a highly educated American of some sort,</p>
<p>which led to his eventual downfall.</p>
<p>He was basically responsible for abducting</p>
<p>and murdering a young American</p>
<p>who was a university college student, I think.</p>
<p>Do you think he believed the,</p>
<p>so this guy&rsquo;s murdering people</p>
<p>to create what, magical potions?</p>
<p>Vessels, yeah. Vessels.</p>
<p>I think, yeah, I think he truly believed</p>
<p>that he was capable of doing what he was doing, I guess.</p>
<p>And there was a culture that&rsquo;s spiritually inclined</p>
<p>that kinda was on the same wavelength as him.</p>
<p>Yeah, it jived.</p>
<p>I mean, some of these spiritual practices,</p>
<p>again, there&rsquo;s a ritualistic cannibalism</p>
<p>done by some of these cartel groups out there.</p>
<p>Was he involved in cannibalism as well?</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t involved in cannibalism that I know of,</p>
<p>but most of the things that he was kind of known for</p>
<p>was basically requesting human body parts</p>
<p>for some of the spell works he was doing.</p>
<p>And then going to such a level</p>
<p>where he needed a specific brain or head of somebody</p>
<p>that was educated and American.</p>
<p>So that kind of, again, led to his eventual downfalls.</p>
<p>His ranch was raided.</p>
<p>They found the body parts inside of these cauldrons</p>
<p>that he was preparing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting example of somebody.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cartel head somewhere in Central Mexico as well.</p>
<p>El Mas Loco was his nickname.</p>
<p>And he basically forced the citizenship around him</p>
<p>to turn him into a saint.</p>
<p>So he made a statue of himself.</p>
<p>He was very big into Christianity,</p>
<p>specifically kind of like the crusader mentality</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>Kind of imbued himself and some of the people</p>
<p>that were around him with that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still alters to his death, to him after he died.</p>
<p>He died two times.</p>
<p>One time, the government declared him</p>
<p>that he was killing to shoot out</p>
<p>and turns out he wasn&rsquo;t dead.</p>
<p>So that was his first miracle, you know?</p>
<p>And then when he was really dead,</p>
<p>some of his people and his loyal followers</p>
<p>were gunpoint kind of still forced to go and give flowers</p>
<p>and venerate these effigies and statues of him as a saint.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>Spirituality in Mexico is a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>And, you know, the Catholic church in Mexico</p>
<p>has a pretty bad track record.</p>
<p>But as far as that being used to control populace</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just another aspect</p>
<p>that is being exploited in Mexico in some communities</p>
<p>as far as the spirituality</p>
<p>and the desperate need for people to believe in something</p>
<p>and how that leads for some people</p>
<p>to go into some horrible predatory behavior around it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fascinating dynamic at play here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the United States and Mexico,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also China that you talk about.</p>
<p>China is the primary source of fentanyl in the world.</p>
<p>So fentanyl is an opioid that leads to 70,000</p>
<p>plus or minus overdose deaths in the US every year.</p>
<p>So reading from Wikipedia, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Compared with heroin, it is more potent,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;has higher profit margins,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;and because it is compact, has simpler logistics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It can be cut into or even replaced entirely</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;the supply of heroin and other opiates.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What do you think is important to understand</p>
<p>about fentanyl as a drug?</p>
<p>There was a prescription opiate epidemic</p>
<p>in the United States that kind of went down or stopped.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it&rsquo;s still out there,</p>
<p>but like the epidemic specific around it kind of petered out.</p>
<p>And there was also marijuana legalization</p>
<p>happening at kind of the same time period,</p>
<p>which, you know, people talking about marijuana legalization</p>
<p>thought it was gonna hit the cartels in their pockets</p>
<p>and it was gonna be like a, you know,</p>
<p>a death blow to these criminal groups.</p>
<p>Well, now there&rsquo;s illegal pot grows in the United States</p>
<p>being run by cartels in federal lands.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the legal pot grows that are in some way,</p>
<p>shape or form influenced and or run or owned</p>
<p>by some criminal groups that are kind of utilizing</p>
<p>that the marijuana fields in Mexico</p>
<p>turned into poppy fields once again.</p>
<p>The problem is that some of these lands</p>
<p>were leached of all the nutrients and, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not as good as something you would find</p>
<p>somewhere in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So the yield and the quality of it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t as strong as it could be.</p>
<p>So somebody thought about the right idea</p>
<p>of putting fentanyl into the mix.</p>
<p>And not only that, but also figuring out</p>
<p>how to get fentanyl into Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexico has a giant pharmaceutical industry</p>
<p>that people kind of also don&rsquo;t kind of know</p>
<p>or factor into this equation,</p>
<p>which leads into the free ability of chemicals</p>
<p>going in and out of the country</p>
<p>and legal means of it happening, right?</p>
<p>So not only the precursors to make it,</p>
<p>but also the chemist and the industry</p>
<p>to create it in Mexico as well.</p>
<p>Some clandestine factories of fentanyl</p>
<p>have been found in Mexico,</p>
<p>but realistically it&rsquo;s not needed</p>
<p>with the ways that the ports and the borders</p>
<p>are down in Mexico.</p>
<p>You started seeing an influx and a flood</p>
<p>of fentanyl into Mexico,</p>
<p>specifically related to infusing it into heroin.</p>
<p>And not only using that to feed local drug markets,</p>
<p>but send it up into the United States,</p>
<p>which started off this process</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re kind of going through still.</p>
<p>Are these like similar highs drug-wise?</p>
<p>Why do you infuse?</p>
<p>I mean, probably you&rsquo;re not the right person</p>
<p>to have this biochemical discussion of how-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the biochemical aspect of it,</p>
<p>but like speaking to guys that do Chiba down there,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they call heroin down there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a nickname for it.</p>
<p>Having them describe some of the older,</p>
<p>stinkier, darker heroin they used to get</p>
<p>before this whole fentanyl thing,</p>
<p>and the highs they would get</p>
<p>and how much they would have to take,</p>
<p>versus some of the stuff loaded with fentanyl</p>
<p>that they have to slow it down.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s more higher potency.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a higher potency to it,</p>
<p>and also there&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>More money to be made, easier to transport.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But then, is this how China</p>
<p>starts becoming part of the picture?</p>
<p>One aspect to it that people kind of miss</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s no Chinese cartel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no criminal Chinese organization</p>
<p>working unseen, getting around government oversight in China.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any such organization.</p>
<p>Anything that could be labeled as a criminal organization</p>
<p>is deeply integrated with the government.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never heard of a giant criminal enterprise</p>
<p>in China operating, so we have to assume then-</p>
<p>Independent of the state.</p>
<p>I would have to assume that some of these things</p>
<p>are happening with the know-how</p>
<p>and inaction of the government out there.</p>
<p>When COVID hit, there was a shortage of fentanyl</p>
<p>on the northern side of Mexico,</p>
<p>specifically related to the Sinaloa cartel.</p>
<p>These guys were actually trafficking fentanyl</p>
<p>from the US down to Mexico to infuse their product,</p>
<p>but not the New Generation cartel,</p>
<p>which operates out of the central part of Mexico,</p>
<p>the Colima area, which have access to the seaside ports.</p>
<p>So even during the shutdown, they were getting supplied,</p>
<p>which means to me, at least, or for anybody observing it,</p>
<p>that the supply chain was not cut,</p>
<p>and whatever was coming out of China</p>
<p>was being let out of China by whatever official channels</p>
<p>would be able to shut down or stop it.</p>
<p>And I would love to know the organizational structure,</p>
<p>the governmental structure of China,</p>
<p>how they enable it.</p>
<p>Because I can&rsquo;t imagine, at the very top,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a portfolio of things we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>and one of them is fentanyl trade.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more inaction,</p>
<p>or just the know-how that is happening,</p>
<p>but just hands-off, just let this, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If I were to understand how large bureaucracies work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s looking the other way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You are now seeing pill presses brought to Mexico,</p>
<p>industrial-level pill presses</p>
<p>found in clandestine laboratories,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re not only infusing the yields</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing with fentanyl,</p>
<p>but also making fake pain medication</p>
<p>that is flooding U.S. markets everywhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it is.</p>
<p>Is that pain medication, or is that fentanyl?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you see a lot of people dying from ODs</p>
<p>that are supposedly taking pain pills,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So the evolution right now you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>is making something look legit</p>
<p>as far as pain medication that it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And fentanyl is everywhere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re infusing cocaine with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting stories from the U.S.</p>
<p>of people buying it through Alibaba</p>
<p>or just weird online sources,</p>
<p>and it coming in different packages,</p>
<p>and just infusing it into whatever is out there.</p>
<p>It is killing off a whole generation of people.</p>
<p>And it comes from one place,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s manufactured somewhere</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s being manufactured with the precursors</p>
<p>and the elements and know-how that comes from one place.</p>
<p>Are we talking about China?</p>
<p>Talking about China.</p>
<p>Because Mexico seems to have,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role, this is such a complicated,</p>
<p>and how do you start to talk about the drug war</p>
<p>when more and more and more</p>
<p>China is the source of the drug?</p>
<p>Is there a drug war going on with China?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably an economic war.</p>
<p>Well, you talk about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another side to China.</p>
<p>Most, and this is something that&rsquo;s come out recently,</p>
<p>a few years back, I think.</p>
<p>But basically, the ways you would move money</p>
<p>back into Mexico after you have a load up here</p>
<p>is that you would give it to a Chinese money broker.</p>
<p>They would put it into a Chinese banking system</p>
<p>and it immediately would just disappear from American eyes.</p>
<p>And then another money broker in Mexico</p>
<p>would receive it through a money transfer from China.</p>
<p>So China&rsquo;s incredibly good at money laundering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another aspect to it.</p>
<p>I mean, their banking system is invisible to the US,</p>
<p>basically.</p>
<p>Which allows?</p>
<p>Which allows the monies to move from one point to another.</p>
<p>So money brokers and people moving money</p>
<p>for the groups down there are Chinese.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another aspect there,</p>
<p>element of China, as far as its presence.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of intelligence in all of this?</p>
<p>FBI, CIA, the Chinese intelligence agencies?</p>
<p>Right now, Mexico is going through a nationalistic resurgence</p>
<p>and a leftist presidency,</p>
<p>which is not friendly to US interest in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>The US has had a pretty bad track record</p>
<p>with its foreign policy in Mexico,</p>
<p>with a lot of damage being done by the last president,</p>
<p>as far as his rhetoric.</p>
<p>Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Which has been weaponized and utilized</p>
<p>by the left down in Mexico.</p>
<p>So America is not seen positively.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Every now and then I post something about Mexico,</p>
<p>some horrible thing happening down there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why doesn&rsquo;t US send people down there?</p>
<p>Are Mexicans looking for US intervention?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>That is beyond what anybody in Mexico would want.</p>
<p>Specifically, you see the sentiment out there.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t view the US as somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna come in and fix anything,</p>
<p>or somebody that&rsquo;s gonna help or as a friend.</p>
<p>When the Ukrainian conflict happened,</p>
<p>Mexico basically abstained from saying anything,</p>
<p>which is a wink and a nod to Russia.</p>
<p>It has openly been pro Maduro</p>
<p>and openly celebrated some of these regimes</p>
<p>popping up across Latin America.</p>
<p>Which is, that is what people voted for.</p>
<p>That is a sentiment down there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going towards the left of the political spectrum</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been basically violated</p>
<p>over and over again by all these different presidencies</p>
<p>that have promised change, brought corruption with them,</p>
<p>and they are our choices.</p>
<p>So this is the best we have right now.</p>
<p>And all of the enemies of the United States</p>
<p>are taking full advantage of that.</p>
<p>We recently had a general kinda,</p>
<p>address a Senate committee hearing, I think.</p>
<p>He was talking about the prevalence</p>
<p>of foreign intelligence services in Mexico, you know,</p>
<p>and why that is.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it has,</p>
<p>Mexico has a lot of the mineable lithium on the planet,</p>
<p>underneath parts of it, specifically in the north.</p>
<p>And it is going through a process,</p>
<p>they call it the Cuarta Transformaci√≥n,</p>
<p>the fourth transformation,</p>
<p>is what the president of Mexico calls it.</p>
<p>Which is, in a way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically we&rsquo;re here to stay type thing.</p>
<p>You know, they just nationalized mining lithium</p>
<p>and taking control of that and using that as leverage.</p>
<p>If the United States ever wants to go to Mexico,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not gonna be related to cartel issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna probably be related to energy, I think.</p>
<p>You know, so they&rsquo;re kinda thinking ahead, I guess.</p>
<p>Well, what about also,</p>
<p>just imagine a world where India and China</p>
<p>are doing fentanyl trade with Mexico</p>
<p>or whatever transport.</p>
<p>Imagine Chinese military moves, makes an agreement,</p>
<p>a NATO type of agreement with Mexico.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty possible.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re seeing a militarized Mexico.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another aspect of Mexico that, again,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen talked about a lot here in the US.</p>
<p>The main promise that the current president had</p>
<p>was he was gonna make the police, the federal police,</p>
<p>and the security issues in Mexico civilian.</p>
<p>He was gonna do exactly the opposite</p>
<p>as his main rival, Felipe Calderon,</p>
<p>the guy that started off the drug war officially.</p>
<p>And what does he do?</p>
<p>He dissolves the civilian leadership of the federal police,</p>
<p>dissolves the federal police,</p>
<p>creates the National Guard, which is a military unit,</p>
<p>and he puts the military in charge of that.</p>
<p>Now the military has a full monopoly</p>
<p>over all federal policing.</p>
<p>When you cross into Mexico,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see them wearing these white camouflage uniforms.</p>
<p>Those are National Guard people,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re the military.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re seeing a militarized Mexico.</p>
<p>With some of these leaks that happened</p>
<p>during the Guacamaya leaks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now seeing that Mexico has been hosting members</p>
<p>of the Haitian military,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been training them up</p>
<p>to go back to police their country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something that Mexico has been known for,</p>
<p>hosting other nations and training them in such a way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting maneuver.</p>
<p>Mexico has been historically neutral</p>
<p>about getting involved in foreign conflicts,</p>
<p>about voting and resolutions as far as invading</p>
<p>or not invading or doing all of these things.</p>
<p>Mexico has been historically kind of neutral</p>
<p>when it comes to some of these things,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re training foreign military forces</p>
<p>to go and do that role somewhere else.</p>
<p>We have the military building airports</p>
<p>and building infrastructure in Mexico</p>
<p>and a lot of their higher ups</p>
<p>getting very wealthy around it.</p>
<p>And they basically have a monopoly</p>
<p>over who gets to have guns down there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one gun store in all Mexico</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s run by the military.</p>
<p>And the only way you can buy a gun there</p>
<p>is if you can buy a plane ticket to fly there</p>
<p>and have enough money to sustain that right</p>
<p>or that privilege.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re seeing the military not being</p>
<p>in its traditional role of just being the security force,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s policing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting involved in politics in a big way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s legislation that has passed</p>
<p>to keep it on the streets</p>
<p>and a policing role for more years now.</p>
<p>So that should be looked at closer</p>
<p>by anybody observing it from afar,</p>
<p>the militarization of Mexico and where it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>Because if you move towards a world</p>
<p>where a World War III happens,</p>
<p>it feels like Mexico will be the center.</p>
<p>Because a hot war would be fought on the ground.</p>
<p>And so you have a very difficult parallel</p>
<p>between Mexico and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Both don&rsquo;t have nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>both have relationships.</p>
<p>So Ukraine has a relationship</p>
<p>or a pull towards the European Union and NATO.</p>
<p>Mexico, at least currently,</p>
<p>has a kind of slow pull towards China,</p>
<p>India potentially, and Russia.</p>
<p>And you have this divide</p>
<p>between power centers in the world.</p>
<p>And in terms of, just imagine hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of Mexican troops, hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops</p>
<p>on the border, on the US border, on the Mexican side.</p>
<p>And also the fact that that border doesn&rsquo;t mean anything</p>
<p>to any sort of conflict that would happen regionally,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a very easy to cross border.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter how many walls you put across it.</p>
<p>People are already here.</p>
<p>This is not gonna be a war fought off</p>
<p>in some overseas place.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not gonna, this is something,</p>
<p>if it happens, if destabilization is utilized in Mexico</p>
<p>to cause a conflict there,</p>
<p>and it turns into a Vietnam or a proxy war down there</p>
<p>of a sort, which I think,</p>
<p>in a way you&rsquo;re already kind of seeing some of that</p>
<p>through some of the conflicts going on down there.</p>
<p>You have a new generation cartel</p>
<p>that is being fed fentanyl from the Pacific side ports.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s suspiciously, you wanna think</p>
<p>that maybe it&rsquo;s favored by a foreign government</p>
<p>of some sort, in some way, shape, or form, who knows.</p>
<p>And then you have a historically in control</p>
<p>Sinaloa cartel that may or may not be favored by the US</p>
<p>in some way, shape, or form.</p>
<p>You can imagine a further conflict down there</p>
<p>and people fostering it and seeing the effects</p>
<p>of basically setting a fire on the feet of the United States.</p>
<p>Its second largest consumer of US products is Mexico.</p>
<p>The massive wave of immigration</p>
<p>that is going to be basically weaponized.</p>
<p>You saw the collapse of the border security structure</p>
<p>with a contingent of 3,000 Honduran Guatemalan immigrants</p>
<p>in that first wave of caravans coming to Tijuana.</p>
<p>It was pretty bad.</p>
<p>It was pretty bad and it could have gotten worse.</p>
<p>Now, what is gonna happen when that wave</p>
<p>is no longer 3,000, but a million people</p>
<p>being displaced by violence or being in fear</p>
<p>of whatever conflict might originate down there</p>
<p>and just that massive wave of migration and move.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an interesting thing</p>
<p>that people should look at and how can you affect change</p>
<p>to try and stop some of these things to happen.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you at a philosophical, at a human level,</p>
<p>what do you think about immigration?</p>
<p>Illegal and legal immigration from the direction of Mexico</p>
<p>to the United States?</p>
<p>So we have an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants</p>
<p>in the United States</p>
<p>and estimated 45 million legal immigrants in the United States.</p>
<p>A few things about that.</p>
<p>When COVID hit, there was no shortages of produce</p>
<p>in the supermarkets, which means that,</p>
<p>I mean, illegal immigration is pretty much</p>
<p>the backbone of all produce</p>
<p>and some of the farming industries out there,</p>
<p>most of it.</p>
<p>So illegal immigration and illegal workers</p>
<p>in those fields are essential workers in a way.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a weird relationship in the United States</p>
<p>with some of these workers and how they&rsquo;re demonized</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;re called criminals.</p>
<p>I think there was a state out there</p>
<p>that passed anti-illegal immigrant worker legislation.</p>
<p>The farmers had to look elsewhere for people to show up</p>
<p>to work in some of these fields,</p>
<p>which basically caused millions of dollars worth of losses</p>
<p>for some of these farms.</p>
<p>Anywhere you go out there in the United States,</p>
<p>you go into the kitchens</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s gonna be paisanos there,</p>
<p>French, high-level French restaurants.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see people from Puebla there</p>
<p>that made their way illegally</p>
<p>and might have legalized or regularized their way</p>
<p>into the country or in a sanctuary city.</p>
<p>You go to the service industry, hotels,</p>
<p>those are the people changing the blankets.</p>
<p>Those are the people in the washrooms.</p>
<p>You have them doing jobs</p>
<p>that no American wants to do, realistically,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re everywhere in this country</p>
<p>and they are the backbone of some of these industries</p>
<p>that are essential in this country.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a deep sense</p>
<p>in which they are American?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re indispensable</p>
<p>and anybody that says they aren&rsquo;t is delusional.</p>
<p>If you take every single legal worker</p>
<p>out of the industry in the United States</p>
<p>and send them back,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a movie out there called</p>
<p>Yes in Mexicano, it&rsquo;s a day without Mexicans.</p>
<p>Everything would stop.</p>
<p>So the relationship is there.</p>
<p>People talk about the history of slavery in this country,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a thing that is in the past.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s endangered slaves in the country right now,</p>
<p>people that are paying off their people smugglers</p>
<p>because they brought them into this country</p>
<p>and they haven&rsquo;t been able to pay that fine or that fee yet</p>
<p>and are basically being held hostage by that</p>
<p>here in the United States.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re slaves right now in the United States.</p>
<p>People are talking about it&rsquo;s a historical context.</p>
<p>What do we do about it?</p>
<p>How are we supposed to think about it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to rethink</p>
<p>how we look at immigration,</p>
<p>illegal or legal immigration from Mexico</p>
<p>and how we view Mexico as a foreign country.</p>
<p>Your relationship to Canada is one thing,</p>
<p>your relationship to Mexico is another.</p>
<p>The foreign policy towards Mexico</p>
<p>has been pretty nefarious</p>
<p>as far as the United States in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>You can go back.</p>
<p>There was a student massacre during the Olympics</p>
<p>and the president in turn at that time was on the CIA payroll</p>
<p>and it was a counter communist type maneuver</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing down there.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some bloody hands on the US side</p>
<p>of some of the things that have been happening in Mexico</p>
<p>as far as destabilization and influencing</p>
<p>and meddling in foreign policy out there.</p>
<p>Most of the guns that are used down there</p>
<p>come from the US.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another interesting aspect</p>
<p>and responsibility that people</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t kind of think about up here.</p>
<p>So there is on the drug war side,</p>
<p>a machine that&rsquo;s fueling the drug war.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a giant drug habit up here.</p>
<p>But also a governmental intelligence</p>
<p>and military support through the sale of weapons.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the sale of weapons</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some very,</p>
<p>you talk about porous borders coming up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s porous borders also going down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a flow of guns going down and munitions,</p>
<p>which again, they don&rsquo;t kill anybody by themselves.</p>
<p>They get put in the hands of the desperate</p>
<p>that are trying to feed a giant drug market</p>
<p>to the south, to the north.</p>
<p>Mexico has a saying,</p>
<p>Mexico, Mexico,</p>
<p>lejos de Dios pero cerca de los Estados Unidos.</p>
<p>Mexico, far from God, but close to the United States.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s definitely a responsibility on both sides.</p>
<p>This is no longer a Mexico problem, a US problem.</p>
<p>This is a regional problem.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t think of it as a regional problem</p>
<p>with our brothers on the southern side of it</p>
<p>and with family, we&rsquo;re related in blood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, we are,</p>
<p>we are, Mexico and the United States are like this.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s become popular in politics.</p>
<p>They just throw a line, right?</p>
<p>And I think we need to get to a place</p>
<p>where we can figure out how to make those connections</p>
<p>and repair some of the damage done</p>
<p>by like just years and years of bad policy</p>
<p>on both sides of the border.</p>
<p>Policy and rhetoric, the way we talk about it,</p>
<p>the way we think about it, not just the actual policy,</p>
<p>but seeing the humanity in the people that are here.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an easy thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming to take our jobs is something you hear.</p>
<p>There was a state out there that passed some anti,</p>
<p>anti-legislation as far as illegal workers on fields.</p>
<p>And it led to massive losses.</p>
<p>Nobody wanted to show up for those jobs, basically.</p>
<p>People would show up one day and they wouldn&rsquo;t come back</p>
<p>and they were doing jobs that people just don&rsquo;t wanna do.</p>
<p>Are they taking that from the locals</p>
<p>or are they filling an essential role</p>
<p>that we feel guilty about?</p>
<p>And the rhetoric around it is more about guilt</p>
<p>than anything.</p>
<p>I am an immigrant myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through the experience of doing it legally</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen people not do it legally</p>
<p>and are in way better places than I am, basically,</p>
<p>by going around some of the system.</p>
<p>The system itself, the immigration system here in the US,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of broken.</p>
<p>And people coming here illegally are not only,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re looking for a better life for themselves,</p>
<p>a better life for people.</p>
<p>This whole aspect of vilifying them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, this immigrant did this horrible thing,</p>
<p>this immigrant did that horrible thing.</p>
<p>And people saying, go back to your country.</p>
<p>At the same time, they go to a hotel</p>
<p>where all the service staff is from that part of the world</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re here irregularly.</p>
<p>Or they go to the Whole Foods</p>
<p>and they get some produce there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s picked by some of the same people they&rsquo;re vilifying.</p>
<p>And again, we need to kind of like think about that</p>
<p>and analyze that for ourselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, the idea of go back to your country</p>
<p>and finding the other and having a disdain</p>
<p>and a hate towards the other.</p>
<p>Ever since I had a recent conversation with Ye,</p>
<p>formerly known as Kanye West,</p>
<p>I got to hear a few things from</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say unfriendly messages from white nationalists</p>
<p>and I got to learn about this world.</p>
<p>I continue on the journey of learning,</p>
<p>which is the idea that the United States,</p>
<p>this country should look a certain way,</p>
<p>should have a certain skin color,</p>
<p>should have a certain religion</p>
<p>and everything else is a pollution, is a poison to this.</p>
<p>I made it sound hateful right now,</p>
<p>but they usually frame it in a positive way.</p>
<p>Like the purity, I&rsquo;m sure Hitler also phrased everything</p>
<p>in a positive way, especially in the 1930s</p>
<p>about the purity of Germany.</p>
<p>But the reality of the United States</p>
<p>and one of the things that makes it</p>
<p>at least the ideal of the United States is the soup, the mix.</p>
<p>Unlike so many nations I&rsquo;ve traveled to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the diversity, the good kind of diversity</p>
<p>is what makes this country great.</p>
<p>And so I think it needs to be based</p>
<p>on accepting the different subgroups</p>
<p>that make up the United States versus trying to purify it.</p>
<p>And I think Mexican immigrants is just another flavor</p>
<p>of saying, this is the other, let&rsquo;s reject the other.</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw that interview, by the way,</p>
<p>that showed a basic restraint in that interview.</p>
<p>My experience, and I came up here,</p>
<p>again, Trump was elected when I came up here.</p>
<p>So it was a weird time for me</p>
<p>as far as being an immigrant</p>
<p>and the immigrant experience for myself</p>
<p>by both being basically the ones</p>
<p>that were talked about in that way.</p>
<p>And also having a bunch of my friends</p>
<p>who were very conservative</p>
<p>and wearing some of those MAGA hats around me</p>
<p>and like, hey, Ed, like, well, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a guest here, so I have to,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a balancing act,</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;ve been looking at it as.</p>
<p>On one side, there&rsquo;s the woke side of it,</p>
<p>which everything goes,</p>
<p>and then the other side is like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hold on to some of these things</p>
<p>that make us who we are.</p>
<p>On my end, I wanna get to a place</p>
<p>where I can smoke a joint, conceal, carry a firearm,</p>
<p>be at my gay best friend&rsquo;s wedding,</p>
<p>and I want the government not to say anything about it.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s parts in the United States here</p>
<p>that kind of feel the same way,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s extremes on both sides</p>
<p>that are pulling you to one side or the other.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen more of the United States</p>
<p>than most Americans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a different state every weekend.</p>
<p>So I get to go to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to Tampa tomorrow,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m going back to California,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m going to Tennessee later,</p>
<p>then Kentucky.</p>
<p>So I get to see all types of people</p>
<p>and all types of mentalities and ways that people live.</p>
<p>And this country is more diverse than most would think,</p>
<p>if you only see it through the lens of television or media.</p>
<p>What I keep seeing out there that, for me,</p>
<p>is like the reason I came here, I guess,</p>
<p>and a lot of the reasons</p>
<p>that I feel a vested interest in this country,</p>
<p>not just because, again, my kid&rsquo;s American.</p>
<p>So I have a very, very big interest</p>
<p>in this country doing well.</p>
<p>But a thing I see is there&rsquo;s still the opportunity</p>
<p>and the ability to do something with yourself</p>
<p>and opportunities out there for people like me</p>
<p>that come here with nothing.</p>
<p>I came here with an experience base, a truck.</p>
<p>And some demons.</p>
<p>And yeah, and a bunch of demons in a bag.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m here with you talking right now</p>
<p>about some of those experiences.</p>
<p>To another immigrant.</p>
<p>To another immigrant.</p>
<p>And both of us are reaching people out there</p>
<p>that might not, might haven&rsquo;t heard a voice</p>
<p>of people like us that come here</p>
<p>with our own bag of demons.</p>
<p>But where else in the world can two people like us</p>
<p>have a conversation with an audience like us</p>
<p>and not be shot outside of this?</p>
<p>Because of the stuff we&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, listen to with love and respect, not derision.</p>
<p>Let me ask you for advice.</p>
<p>What would you say to young folks,</p>
<p>wherever they come from?</p>
<p>So in high school and college,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking of how to live a life,</p>
<p>have a career they can be proud of.</p>
<p>And especially if they&rsquo;re struggling,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re at a low point like you were</p>
<p>when you came here.</p>
<p>Travel.</p>
<p>Travel is one of the biggest things in the world</p>
<p>that I would ask people to kind of go out to,</p>
<p>see how other people live.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go there with your own preconceived notions</p>
<p>or trying to make people act like you act.</p>
<p>Go out there and travel and actually experience the world.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be another country.</p>
<p>Going from Tennessee to Seattle,</p>
<p>is a pretty interesting change of scenery.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s better at knife fighting?</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to answer that.</p>
<p>Tennessee.</p>
<p>But the traveling is one,</p>
<p>and knowing how other people live</p>
<p>is one aspect of it that I would tell people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s risky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>But that is part of the journey,</p>
<p>is one of the things I would ask people,</p>
<p>young people to kind of consider.</p>
<p>Service is essential.</p>
<p>And it should be at the basis of all of our lives.</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Start there.</p>
<p>Start with service.</p>
<p>In any industry,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go start your own restaurant,</p>
<p>you have to work in the kitchen first, service.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna be a part,</p>
<p>a productive member of this country, service.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking just about the military,</p>
<p>because the military, it&rsquo;s a process and it&rsquo;s a lifestyle</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a thing for some people out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a choice for other people</p>
<p>if they want an education.</p>
<p>And I get that.</p>
<p>Community service of any kind is an essential thing.</p>
<p>The ability to go out there and interact with the people</p>
<p>that you would normally not interact with,</p>
<p>the homeless population that there is in this country,</p>
<p>the older population that in Mexico,</p>
<p>our old die in our homes,</p>
<p>but here you send them off somewhere else to die,</p>
<p>which is an interesting, weird detachment</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve seen in the US</p>
<p>as far as how the elders are cast aside.</p>
<p>If I can say anything to young people</p>
<p>is to start figuring out a life of service</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna expose you to a bunch of experiences,</p>
<p>to a bunch of people out there</p>
<p>that you might not regularly kind of meet and see</p>
<p>and realities.</p>
<p>Education is out there.</p>
<p>It is expensive,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve sat through a bunch of really expensive classes</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve managed to see on YouTube</p>
<p>and learned a lot from them.</p>
<p>So education is out there,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be as expensive as they make it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the individual</p>
<p>and what he does with that education.</p>
<p>The dream is free and the hustle is sold separately</p>
<p>is something else I watch somewhere online,</p>
<p>but the ability to take information process and use it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re expecting everything to be safe process</p>
<p>and given to us in a platter</p>
<p>and taking that and digesting</p>
<p>and thinking that&rsquo;s gonna make us somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be productive or valuable in society.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up to us?</p>
<p>The US talks a lot about freedoms,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t talk a lot about responsibilities.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a big part of,</p>
<p>take responsibility for like I came here without anything.</p>
<p>And the first thing I thought was</p>
<p>I have a responsibility for the people that I&rsquo;ve worked with</p>
<p>and the people that are going through</p>
<p>the same problems than I am.</p>
<p>How can I figure out a way to help?</p>
<p>Yeah, the dark side of thinking a lot about freedom</p>
<p>is thinking too individualistically,</p>
<p>meaning thinking about me,</p>
<p>how to optimize my situation,</p>
<p>forgetting that the deepest growth</p>
<p>you can do as an individual is by taking care of others,</p>
<p>by helping others, by being of service,</p>
<p>by being useful to your community locally,</p>
<p>and then hopefully also at scale.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you grow.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s responsibility of like helping those around you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an isolationist aspect to culture now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we are separate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost like a spiritual or cultural amputation</p>
<p>in a way where, you know, when I was a kid,</p>
<p>the house where all the bikes outside of it,</p>
<p>that was where all the kids were hanging out.</p>
<p>And now everybody&rsquo;s on their phone, you know,</p>
<p>in their separate houses chatting on whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a detachment to there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird aspect to it.</p>
<p>And also the aspect of I need to be safe.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be offended.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hurt me, safe spaces.</p>
<p>This is my right.</p>
<p>This is my right.</p>
<p>This is my reality.</p>
<p>You need to respect it.</p>
<p>You know, respect is earned.</p>
<p>And where I come from, respect is earned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s freedoms, but there&rsquo;s dangerous freedoms.</p>
<p>Any freedom that you have in Mexico</p>
<p>is a dangerous freedom in a way.</p>
<p>You know, you can drive home drunk in Mexico.</p>
<p>You can if you bribe a cop on your way there.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t die or crash into somebody else,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a dangerous aspect of freedom.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a responsibility to all of it.</p>
<p>It is a twisted responsibility in a twisted way</p>
<p>kind of talk about it and describe it.</p>
<p>But I think the aspect of people</p>
<p>screaming for freedom up here or their rights</p>
<p>or their privilege without the responsibility,</p>
<p>you know, what are you doing for your community?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re complaining about this.</p>
<p>What are you doing about it?</p>
<p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve noticed in traveling around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scary, is the whole people getting shouted down</p>
<p>or canceled because of what the expressors say.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Some of the creepiest experiences I&rsquo;ve had in the US</p>
<p>has been through universities</p>
<p>or just seeing young people that have an opinion</p>
<p>that is completely outside of reality, you know?</p>
<p>People telling me how things are in Mexico</p>
<p>because they learned it through a college course.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And seeing sons of immigrants criticizing me</p>
<p>because of my opinion of Mexico</p>
<p>or what I have to say about it.</p>
<p>And, you know, if you wanna encounter</p>
<p>the worst enemy of a Mexican</p>
<p>is usually a second, third generation Mexican up here</p>
<p>that shouts you down for what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I mean, in general, entitlement,</p>
<p>all of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Some of that comes with just being young in general,</p>
<p>but yes, humility.</p>
<p>Humility at a societal scale would benefit significantly,</p>
<p>especially the young.</p>
<p>So I would say some of the service that you&rsquo;re speaking to</p>
<p>is, comes with being humbled.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that is one of the best things you can do</p>
<p>as a young person.</p>
<p>Whilst maintaining the dream and the ambition,</p>
<p>humble yourself to the reality of the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One small example, a micro example of this.</p>
<p>My kid, there was a homeless guy.</p>
<p>She was out with family members.</p>
<p>This homeless guy showed up.</p>
<p>He was erratic, mentally disturbed, created a scene.</p>
<p>She was upset.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of trauma there.</p>
<p>She was like, oh, now all homeless people are bad.</p>
<p>So with her, she does art pieces sometimes for me</p>
<p>and helps me make designs for the clothing brand that I have.</p>
<p>And we take some of that money</p>
<p>and we buy socks and underwear, you know?</p>
<p>And sometimes I have them in the car,</p>
<p>sometimes I drive around and see somebody</p>
<p>that needs something and I give it to her.</p>
<p>And it says, you helped me earn this money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna help these people.</p>
<p>So you should just give them these.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, you know?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, ah, thank you.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, hey, cool.</p>
<p>Roll up the window.</p>
<p>She used to roll up the window really quick.</p>
<p>Now she doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They cease to be scary.</p>
<p>Because now some of them have names.</p>
<p>Now some of them know her name.</p>
<p>When she crosses by there, so there&rsquo;s contact there.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s more connected than I am in some of these places now.</p>
<p>She has friends in low places.</p>
<p>And in high places.</p>
<p>That comes later, I guess.</p>
<p>But she is learning about service.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s learning about not everybody out there</p>
<p>is an enemy or bad or scary.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s learning about service.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s basically learning that lesson</p>
<p>that I got from my mom long ago.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s against you, they&rsquo;re for themselves.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take anything personal.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not doing something for other people</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re working, then you&rsquo;re not doing anything.</p>
<p>So when you were young, you were pretty sure</p>
<p>you were gonna die before you were 30.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your relationship with death today?</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid of it.</p>
<p>If anything, I&rsquo;m afraid of meaningless death,</p>
<p>or at least a meaningless walk towards it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of losing the use of my legs, I guess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of not being able to go out there</p>
<p>and do things anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;m not physically capable</p>
<p>of doing the job that I used to do.</p>
<p>So if anything, I&rsquo;m afraid of stillness.</p>
<p>Something I always quote a lot in my writings,</p>
<p>stillness is death.</p>
<p>So you always want to be challenging yourself,</p>
<p>moving, growing, like you&rsquo;re traveling,</p>
<p>so you get all these experiences</p>
<p>and filling your life with all these experiences.</p>
<p>And if it ends, when it ends, you&rsquo;re ready for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not afraid of the end.</p>
<p>The ending is important in all things.</p>
<p>First time I got a promotion,</p>
<p>I got two silver coins handed to me.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a silver coin, and this is another silver coin.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;ll give you the other one when your job ends.</p>
<p>It depends on you if you wanted to have it over your eyes</p>
<p>or in your pocket, right?</p>
<p>The lesson there is that this job you&rsquo;re getting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty cool, and you&rsquo;re gonna be in charge</p>
<p>of all these people, and it&rsquo;s pretty important,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna end.</p>
<p>So you always have to, the ending is important</p>
<p>in all things.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t keep that in mind,</p>
<p>then if you think we&rsquo;re immortal and nothing&rsquo;s gonna end,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an atrophy, a spiritual atrophy in that.</p>
<p>For the sake of spiritual flourishing,</p>
<p>this conversation too must come to an end.</p>
<p>So I think a beautiful way to end it,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a man with a life well lived,</p>
<p>and for talking with me today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor, man.</p>
<p>It was an awesome conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me on.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Ed Calderon.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Al Pacino&rsquo;s character in Scarface, Tony Montana.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the guts to be what you want to be.</p>
<p>You need people like me so you can point your fingers</p>
<p>and say, that&rsquo;s the bad guy.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
