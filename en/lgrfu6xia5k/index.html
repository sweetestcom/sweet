<p>Ôªøhey everyone welcome back I have a great</p>
<p>guest today and his name is Rob kidney</p>
<p>and he was one of the contestants on The</p>
<p>Biggest Loser and welcome thank you</p>
<p>thank you it&rsquo;s good to be here</p>
<p>absolutely I appreciate you taking the</p>
<p>time I I really want to start out just</p>
<p>to kind of hear your story your</p>
<p>background first tell us a little bit</p>
<p>about you know the struggles with weight</p>
<p>and your health even before you went on</p>
<p>The Biggest Loser in a ditch III guess I</p>
<p>was a chubby little kid and struggled</p>
<p>with that when I was a little bit yeah</p>
<p>kind of grew out of it when I was a</p>
<p>teenager and through high school and</p>
<p>college pretty much maintained my weight</p>
<p>pretty pretty well got out into the</p>
<p>business world as a salesman traveled a</p>
<p>lot ate a lot of food in restaurants of</p>
<p>course all the time.they eating out and</p>
<p>just started to put on a little bit of</p>
<p>weight and honestly up until oh I guess</p>
<p>about 1996 or 97 I was maybe 30 40</p>
<p>pounds overweight for a long period of</p>
<p>time and then I had about a 10-year</p>
<p>stretch of uh a whole bunch of events</p>
<p>that just put so much stress on me that</p>
<p>I just realized that my stress eating</p>
<p>got a little bit out of control</p>
<p>so so it&rsquo;s a combination of stress and</p>
<p>stress eating and then eating the wrong</p>
<p>foods right yes yes it&rsquo;s the stress is</p>
<p>big stress is a big thing I always have</p>
<p>have been an athlete and exerciser</p>
<p>through college even when I was in my</p>
<p>first I&rsquo;ve been married 36 years my</p>
<p>first uh years of marriage we exercised</p>
<p>a lot together</p>
<p>hiked walk ran is in the gym as much as</p>
<p>possible but I love to work I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>loved to work I guess you like to work -</p>
<p>I see I see so many videos coming out</p>
<p>every every day yeah finding time to</p>
<p>exercise in that kind of environments</p>
<p>like most people we are</p>
<p>I call them intermittent exercisers we</p>
<p>exercise when we can write what was the</p>
<p>peak weight that you hit like what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most you&rsquo;ve ever weighed 326 when I the</p>
<p>Biggest Loser Wow</p>
<p>so here you are you hit this way did you</p>
<p>did it when you walked around or sat</p>
<p>what are to feel like on your joints to</p>
<p>have that much weight to do to get down</p>
<p>to it her it was miserable okay point</p>
<p>and and I&rsquo;ll say it over and over again</p>
<p>anybody that asked me about the Biggest</p>
<p>Loser experience it literally saved my</p>
<p>life I really believe that it did I was</p>
<p>in a in a bad situation I&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>through to cancer surgeries both</p>
<p>prostate and finally got that taken care</p>
<p>of that was in maybe in moms who I was</p>
<p>about 2009 2010 and hold three at the</p>
<p>time I was probably 54 so okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty early for prostate cancer but but</p>
<p>I tracked that we caught it pretty early</p>
<p>and and got that taken care of</p>
<p>I had a tornado a freak tornado came</p>
<p>through I had businesses and destroyed</p>
<p>my business and should pay anything so</p>
<p>in a matter of seconds I lost them</p>
<p>couple hundred thousand dollars and</p>
<p>borrowed the rebuild and the economy</p>
<p>just went down and you and I had had a</p>
<p>drug problem for many years which was</p>
<p>probably worse than the cancer and Wow</p>
<p>but several other things but it just it</p>
<p>just all kept building I had I had a</p>
<p>really good friend and best friend and</p>
<p>one of my mentors in life I felt fell</p>
<p>off of a ladder and and died and I just</p>
<p>I just started eating more I would find</p>
<p>myself sometimes and in drive throughs</p>
<p>at restaurants not knowing how I got</p>
<p>there wow wow so you have all these</p>
<p>present time problems and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>stacking up and of course you want to</p>
<p>get relief so</p>
<p>turn to eating so when you actually got</p>
<p>on this this show tell us a little bit</p>
<p>experience of how that went</p>
<p>it looked pretty intense wait it was</p>
<p>intense it was to take a 326 pound body</p>
<p>and tell it to go to the gym for 40</p>
<p>hours a week there was there was a lot</p>
<p>of hurt a lot of pain but 40 hours a</p>
<p>week at the gym 40 that&rsquo;s a full-time</p>
<p>job at the gym</p>
<p>yes yes it was I mean some of that some</p>
<p>of that of course was with trainers as</p>
<p>you see on TV but a lot of it&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not but you know again the Biggest</p>
<p>Loser I just have to tell you for me it</p>
<p>was it was a it was a break from life</p>
<p>which I greatly needed maybe some</p>
<p>intervention I just believe it was a</p>
<p>god-sent thing to help me take a</p>
<p>sabbatical from life so so so I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that I didn&rsquo;t know how much a</p>
<p>person exercised on that program so can</p>
<p>you give me just so like a summary like</p>
<p>you through the day is it just like okay</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the treadmill for an hour take</p>
<p>a break okay go back on the lift awaits</p>
<p>go back like what kind of workout would</p>
<p>you do in a given day workouts were it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mostly staying really really busy all</p>
<p>day long we get up in the morning and</p>
<p>and if if you chose to eat something was</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;ve pretty much prepared our</p>
<p>own foods we didn&rsquo;t have a chat we</p>
<p>learned how to cook they have the best</p>
<p>nutritionist in the world and chefs who</p>
<p>do teach you some things about cooking</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re on your own for else you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make these decisions</p>
<p>it is a show it is a contest at the time</p>
<p>when it started 12 13 years ago it used</p>
<p>the best possible science available at</p>
<p>that time that was going on so I will</p>
<p>never never fall the biggest loser for</p>
<p>anything but give it credit for saving</p>
<p>my life but we started with a morning</p>
<p>workout was most of the time I fasted</p>
<p>workout just like I do now</p>
<p>then come back eat a little bit of</p>
<p>calories sure we ate we ate frequent</p>
<p>times throughout the day but for the</p>
<p>intensity of what we were doing it was</p>
<p>probably necessary so the the food was</p>
<p>the best produce in the world they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>made a lot of vegetables which which was</p>
<p>new for me one of the things I really</p>
<p>learned how to do well there was was a</p>
<p>really plant-based me oh I ate a lot of</p>
<p>plant-based food it&rsquo;s the the the big</p>
<p>thing that changed for me after the show</p>
<p>and of course going to Quito it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>carved I&rsquo;ve always ate clean since that</p>
<p>point really clean so just I want to</p>
<p>kind of just get you know because I want</p>
<p>to get into that topic but I wanted to</p>
<p>find out just as far as the workouts so</p>
<p>you basically you would eat eat through</p>
<p>the day and then you would work out in</p>
<p>the afternoon well we&rsquo;ve worked out we</p>
<p>would work out on our own in the morning</p>
<p>then maybe with a trainer for a couple</p>
<p>hours do a couple are if workout or a</p>
<p>circuit workout it&rsquo;s not all cardio it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some really fun workouts where the</p>
<p>best trainers around and each trainer</p>
<p>has a little different Flair and a</p>
<p>little different style my trainer was</p>
<p>Jen waders Drummond and and she would</p>
<p>put us through some like circuit</p>
<p>training or CrossFit type training and</p>
<p>we had a lot of fun but doing it as a</p>
<p>group also helped double so so then you</p>
<p>would go a period of time and then was</p>
<p>it seven days a week or did you have a</p>
<p>day off well we were working out the</p>
<p>whole time we were there whenever most</p>
<p>of the contestants get on there I mean</p>
<p>everyone gets on The Biggest Loser I</p>
<p>think the biggest motivation is to lose</p>
<p>as much weight as fast as possible I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think money is a big thing</p>
<p>it might come into play after if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost a lot of weight but everybody goes</p>
<p>there to lose as much weight as fast as</p>
<p>possible right okay you&rsquo;re working out</p>
<p>all the time there is little pusher to</p>
<p>and once one person does that more exact</p>
<p>everybody starts working out that you</p>
<p>work out every couple hours put a little</p>
<p>bit of food in your mouth work out again</p>
<p>but a little interesting and then I</p>
<p>think obviously the food was fairly</p>
<p>clean but then you had the</p>
<p>the frequency of meals so you had quite</p>
<p>a few meals and then you also or allowed</p>
<p>snacks and fruit right well yeah yeah I</p>
<p>mean it was uh it was like meal little</p>
<p>snack meal little snack meal little</p>
<p>snack and again they have to leave a lot</p>
<p>of that up to you so that you either</p>
<p>sink or swim in the show that&rsquo;s but at</p>
<p>all times you&rsquo;re totally monitored you</p>
<p>log your food it&rsquo;s being checked so that</p>
<p>there they&rsquo;re just no problems no one is</p>
<p>allowed to go to severe calorie</p>
<p>restriction unless they completely</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t tell the truth in all right</p>
<p>everything is monitored and say okay and</p>
<p>then at the point you lost a total of</p>
<p>how much was the total that you lost</p>
<p>116 Wow and that was over a period of</p>
<p>how long about three months branch doing</p>
<p>the forty hours a week that you</p>
<p>compartment and most people have jobs so</p>
<p>you go back to work and still try to</p>
<p>work twenty twenty for work twenty 24</p>
<p>hours a week x three months and then you</p>
<p>have a live finale and then you come</p>
<p>home and and crash though Wow okay so</p>
<p>you lost all the way and then you</p>
<p>completed that program yes and then you</p>
<p>were done and then um what happened at</p>
<p>that point with your well huh come back</p>
<p>home and that when we finished up we</p>
<p>were of course the last season that the</p>
<p>I guess it was a New York Times that did</p>
<p>that published the report the Biggest</p>
<p>Loser study that came out and they were</p>
<p>aware of that when we got done and and</p>
<p>they did their due diligence of warning</p>
<p>us that we would have to go home and and</p>
<p>the study shows that you know your left</p>
<p>and levels are down your metabolism is</p>
<p>downgraded and you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>either exercise for many hours</p>
<p>any really really clean to keep this off</p>
<p>and then we would have regular calls and</p>
<p>group calls for a while after that to</p>
<p>just check on us and to see how we were</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>and maybe if we needed any any advice</p>
<p>they would give us some advice though</p>
<p>and then and then you gained some weight</p>
<p>back yeah I gained some weight back</p>
<p>probably in 18 months</p>
<p>I gained 88 90 pounds in a 18 months</p>
<p>that was a very very scary time I must</p>
<p>mine my eating was Queen kale shake for</p>
<p>breakfast salad for lunch and a low-carb</p>
<p>dinner of all odd eating eating low carb</p>
<p>for many many many years but I did eat</p>
<p>some quinoa and some rice and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if there are clean cleaner carbs</p>
<p>but hey pretty well sweet potatoes and</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t need a whole lot of junk but in</p>
<p>that 18 months it just kept coming on I</p>
<p>exercised a few hours a week a lot less</p>
<p>than I was told that I had to but but</p>
<p>anyway it just kind of just kept</p>
<p>crawling and creeping back on I guess my</p>
<p>setpoint was so low and my metabolism</p>
<p>was so low that it just it was it was a</p>
<p>really scary thing until about January</p>
<p>of first I had started about in January</p>
<p>price of 218 I had been watching your</p>
<p>videos from six months slowly making</p>
<p>changes as you had suggested you know I</p>
<p>looked I watched a lot on Keith that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all I was hearing was key to this keep</p>
<p>of that but but it really didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>some of the things I&rsquo;m that I was</p>
<p>hearing on the Internet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what against ideas of what clean</p>
<p>eating was I mean bacon seven days a</p>
<p>week yeah I think I think and let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>bring this up because I think um there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this kind of delusion comment generality</p>
<p>that says oh keto is all just pure bacon</p>
<p>and red mean fat right that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s what I saw it burst right so</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a healthy</p>
<p>version of it which is actually a lot of</p>
<p>vegetables high-quality</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not all just that right are you</p>
<p>cleaner than probably anybody I know</p>
<p>I eat more vegetables in more kale I</p>
<p>liked your approach your approach helped</p>
<p>me one as I was looking at Kido I was</p>
<p>looking at intermittent fasting as I</p>
<p>determined it was probably the key but I</p>
<p>was I didn&rsquo;t know that I could really</p>
<p>fast and go and and push myself to that</p>
<p>limit because I&rsquo;d been eating four or</p>
<p>five times a day even small amounts not</p>
<p>big amounts but I didn&rsquo;t know that I</p>
<p>could do it but when you started to say</p>
<p>okay take your 5 mils turn them into</p>
<p>three meals eliminate the snacks then</p>
<p>push your breakfast back toward</p>
<p>lunchtime until you&rsquo;re eating in an 18-6</p>
<p>window that made a lot of sense to me</p>
<p>and the other thing was yes seven eight</p>
<p>cups of greens a day sold me because I</p>
<p>knew from my experience even on even on</p>
<p>the ranch my best weeks were all</p>
<p>vegetables and fish weeks that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>my best my best weight loss is healthy</p>
<p>fats and greens I love it so for those</p>
<p>of you that are watching that are new</p>
<p>and I want to mention something because</p>
<p>this is like the most important point is</p>
<p>the combination of a healthy version of</p>
<p>keto and then intermittent fasting when</p>
<p>you have to eat so often you&rsquo;re raising</p>
<p>insulin despite if you&rsquo;re eating nuts it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter you&rsquo;re just raising</p>
<p>insulin so in a minute fasting forces</p>
<p>your body to actually live off your fat</p>
<p>between the meals when you do that you</p>
<p>actually go into a state of ketosis</p>
<p>which is fat burning and you you think</p>
<p>that oh I&rsquo;m gonna struggle with it but</p>
<p>no no you actually your hunger goes down</p>
<p>your cratons go down you can last longer</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re running off your own fat</p>
<p>the way that most people do it if they</p>
<p>snack is they never actually get into a</p>
<p>true sustained fat burning and</p>
<p>the whole key to this thing is lowering</p>
<p>your insulin which will prevent the</p>
<p>slowing of your metabolism I think what</p>
<p>happened to you is that because of the</p>
<p>raise of the stress of losing weight and</p>
<p>then the raising up of insulin that</p>
<p>slowed the metabolism right there so if</p>
<p>you have a stubborn metabolism you you</p>
<p>have to focus on lowering insulin that</p>
<p>is the secret right there and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you did yeah and what one thing you</p>
<p>said there about about whenever you eat</p>
<p>insulin raises I was hearing a lot on</p>
<p>the Internet about you can eat all this</p>
<p>fat and you can eat I mean you can eat a</p>
<p>lot of greens and things but but there</p>
<p>are certain foods that won&rsquo;t spike your</p>
<p>insulin but I found out that every time</p>
<p>I ate a meal starting January 1st of</p>
<p>last year my insulin went up my sugar</p>
<p>when I was I bought me a keto meter and</p>
<p>I was ketones three four or five times a</p>
<p>day fasting days I would eat something</p>
<p>out idiot eat a certain sweetener just</p>
<p>to test it I would eat a kale salad to</p>
<p>test it and even on even on a kale salad</p>
<p>my insulin spike and we know with</p>
<p>someone who is insulin resistant who has</p>
<p>maybe some fatty liver and and some</p>
<p>other problems that that spike stays up</p>
<p>a little bit longer than someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maybe 10 20 pounds over overweight but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I found I tested</p>
<p>everything that you were telling me and</p>
<p>and it worked I mean I did not want to</p>
<p>give away all my healthy eating</p>
<p>migraines I&rsquo;m a big supplement guy I</p>
<p>take I take a lot of stuff and I take</p>
<p>some of your supplements &ndash;n and all the</p>
<p>time but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s i did not want to</p>
<p>give up really good eating and and the</p>
<p>other thing that kind of bothered me was</p>
<p>you know and and some people don&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>in in the world of keto but i counted my</p>
<p>carbs I put everything in I loved every</p>
<p>bit of food that I&rsquo;ve ever eaten</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one best thing that Biggest Loser</p>
<p>ever taught us was to log every bit of</p>
<p>food I use my fitness pal but every time</p>
<p>I come up with my fitness now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>saying I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>4050 Karp today and I think I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>10 15 carbs a day but a lot of my carbs</p>
<p>are good healthy carbs that are coming</p>
<p>from the vegetables and the salads and</p>
<p>things like that so I&rsquo;m okay at about 50</p>
<p>I stick I stick 40 50 probably if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to count every car I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>the idea or they&rsquo;ll count this and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>count that I just I count them all I try</p>
<p>to stay 40 to 50 grams a day if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>eating vegetables and I&rsquo;m happy with</p>
<p>that so interesting and one more point</p>
<p>about that the when you eat vegetable</p>
<p>carbohydrates you&rsquo;re dealing with a</p>
<p>carbohydrate but a lot of that&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>form of a fiber fiber despite being a</p>
<p>carbohydrate doesn&rsquo;t have the effects of</p>
<p>like other other macronutrients so it</p>
<p>eventually indirectly it&rsquo;s fed to the</p>
<p>microbes that turns into what&rsquo;s called a</p>
<p>butyric acid which then helps you fix</p>
<p>instant resistance so indirectly it</p>
<p>helps you so not to mention all the</p>
<p>potassium and the magnesium and the</p>
<p>vegetables in the chlorophyll which</p>
<p>basically also help insulin resistance I</p>
<p>think a real subtle point that I don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>hope everyone got so far is that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not even dramatically changing your diet</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually changing the frequency of</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re eating and probably tweaking</p>
<p>it but did you did you also tweak it</p>
<p>with with cutting out some of the sweet</p>
<p>potato or fruit oh I eat a Mary every</p>
<p>once in a while I don&rsquo;t eat a lot of</p>
<p>food but I think bioflavonoids and a lot</p>
<p>of minerals in but I I don&rsquo;t I eat a</p>
<p>sweet potato that&rsquo;s my my cheat day if I</p>
<p>have a cheat day it&rsquo;ll be half of a</p>
<p>sweet potato something that&rsquo;s really I</p>
<p>enjoy conquering net that that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sweet craving big for me I guess the</p>
<p>best I&rsquo;ve been able to identify myself</p>
<p>is is a thyroid type if we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about body types from you from all the</p>
<p>research I did in your health coach</p>
<p>classes</p>
<p>now I think I&rsquo;m a thyroid type but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that sweet craving as well as</p>
<p>something that when you get on keto</p>
<p>first thing you want to do is find all</p>
<p>these sweet alternatives that you can</p>
<p>grow in your mouth at eight o&rsquo;clock at</p>
<p>night like you used to do ice cream or</p>
<p>cereal or something else and then it</p>
<p>seems like you&rsquo;ve it to be successful</p>
<p>you got to progress beyond that and</p>
<p>actually in fact the problem which is</p>
<p>the sweet craving and the facts do help</p>
<p>that they help a lot but I eat today</p>
<p>today I&rsquo;m over this year let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken back off another 50 plus pounds I</p>
<p>still have about 35 pounds to go till</p>
<p>where I got off the Biggest Loser and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been slow there&rsquo;s been plateau</p>
<p>after plateau after Plateau and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m eating to be healthy and the</p>
<p>weight loss will follow and that limit</p>
<p>may be a big thing that you said that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally agreed with with my</p>
<p>philosophy I want to get healthy I was</p>
<p>almost dead yeah I totally believe what</p>
<p>they say I was dying and probably didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have long to go they found another thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very grateful for with all the</p>
<p>medical staff that they have they found</p>
<p>free heart blockages my current</p>
<p>bloodwork that I just had and now after</p>
<p>you know I said a year and a half of</p>
<p>keto and a good good year of</p>
<p>intermittent fasting with keto my all my</p>
<p>markers are blood I was back home blood</p>
<p>pressure back on thyroid medicine that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all gone well my TSH for the first time</p>
<p>and t4 is totally in line calcium&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little low Mykel seems always a little</p>
<p>know for some reason maybe because I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat dairy I don&rsquo;t know if you can</p>
<p>help me I do supplement what do you</p>
<p>supplement with no I&rsquo;m not not not the</p>
<p>rocks and other things that not the</p>
<p>carbonates and I&rsquo;m not get it to citrate</p>
<p>okay good yeah as long as it&rsquo;s a citrate</p>
<p>mineral and it&rsquo;ll be fine</p>
<p>as long it&rsquo;s not people those of you</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re watching you never want to just</p>
<p>take the form of calcium in the calcium</p>
<p>carbonate you&rsquo;d be better off chewing on</p>
<p>the cement out there so we want to stick</p>
<p>with the citrate but you you have to</p>
<p>calcium is one thing that I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>cautious the only time I would recommend</p>
<p>it is if it shows low or you have bone</p>
<p>loss because as people age the thing</p>
<p>that they have always too much of in the</p>
<p>wrong place is calcium and so they have</p>
<p>calcium and the arteries of calcium and</p>
<p>the joints and so you got to be careful</p>
<p>even especially women with with calcium</p>
<p>supplements and iron supplements those</p>
<p>are two that you got to be careful with</p>
<p>question I have about just the</p>
<p>differentiation of the food the foods</p>
<p>like you you were doing probably a lot</p>
<p>of snacking I&rsquo;m guessing you well just</p>
<p>eating frequently and now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lowering the carbs and you&rsquo;re eating one</p>
<p>meal a day right I really found that I</p>
<p>have to mix it up a lot I went to total</p>
<p>oh man for one meal a day for awhile</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say well we started off the</p>
<p>beginning the year push in the in an</p>
<p>18-6 window with two meals then I</p>
<p>graduated to one mill a day I really</p>
<p>love how I feel on one meal a day I like</p>
<p>it a lot but I did plateau after a short</p>
<p>while and then the plateau I give a</p>
<p>plateaued three or four weeks before I</p>
<p>really panic about it but three or four</p>
<p>weeks later I said we&rsquo;ve got to switch</p>
<p>something up so I at the advice of</p>
<p>everybody on the internet they say eat</p>
<p>more fat you&rsquo;re not eating enough fact</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not enough that one I&rsquo;m 60 years</p>
<p>old another thing that you have taught</p>
<p>me is that that as you age maybe you</p>
<p>need to look at your fat percentage and</p>
<p>keep it more around 60 percent than 70</p>
<p>or eight so I try to keep it around 60</p>
<p>percent and I function really well there</p>
<p>when it gets beefed up and especially on</p>
<p>snacks</p>
<p>nuts will put on weight on me really</p>
<p>quick or if I get that fat up there</p>
<p>around 7080 percent and you can tell</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re real easy on some of them I want</p>
<p>to push my fitness pal but I have my</p>
<p>fitness penalty the paid-for version</p>
<p>that you can track all your macros and</p>
<p>keep your percentages and and I love</p>
<p>that so Wow yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>for those people that are platt doing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just kind of give you a couple</p>
<p>things um you probably already know</p>
<p>number one it&rsquo;s not necessarily a matter</p>
<p>of increasing the fat we want if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>plateaued we want your body to burn your</p>
<p>own fat and not as much of the dietary</p>
<p>fat so you want to bring them bring your</p>
<p>fat down a little bit not as a low-fat</p>
<p>but maybe maybe have the fat not extra</p>
<p>but just with your protein like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>out you&rsquo;re getting your fat with the</p>
<p>salmon or the other as as compared to</p>
<p>adding butter or things like that</p>
<p>if you get your fat below 75 grams and I</p>
<p>will be sending out a video of what that</p>
<p>looks like if you want to see but 75</p>
<p>grams is about 55 to 60 percent of your</p>
<p>total calories for an average person if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing like 1800 calories for the</p>
<p>day but here&rsquo;s the thing there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple of things that you can look at</p>
<p>and you you hit it run you talked about</p>
<p>the nuts there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s carbs and nuts</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a vibrant nuts there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things and nuts that are anti nutrients</p>
<p>that can irritate your gut they can</p>
<p>create a little bit of inflammation the</p>
<p>same thing with dairy so knots in dairy</p>
<p>are the two things that could put you in</p>
<p>a plateau so what you could do is switch</p>
<p>the type of nut that you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>for example almonds might sound like a</p>
<p>healthy nut but I found that their their</p>
<p>high unluck tins which actually create a</p>
<p>little this is kind of inflammatory</p>
<p>thing in your gut so if you did walnuts</p>
<p>and you can soak them overnight in water</p>
<p>that it pulls out all these anti</p>
<p>nutrients and I have a dehydrator you</p>
<p>can dry them out for like</p>
<p>and then you can eat those you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>that they bow they digest better they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>easier to digest you&rsquo;ll get some good</p>
<p>fat and protein from that and omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids and you can then also maybe</p>
<p>as a fat eat olives that would be</p>
<p>beneficial so you can see you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hungry all the time and have your</p>
<p>protein and the other thing that I found</p>
<p>with people is that you have to be</p>
<p>careful about certain people cannot just</p>
<p>digest any vegetable that they may be</p>
<p>leafy greens or this vegetable but they</p>
<p>see if they start bloating and they</p>
<p>start getting any type of digestive</p>
<p>digestive problem on that you got to</p>
<p>switch up your vegetable and sometimes</p>
<p>steam ium will help but it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just put everyone on the exact</p>
<p>same program so when you test your</p>
<p>ketones I think that&rsquo;s very valuable</p>
<p>because you can find out what foods</p>
<p>agree with you because that could be why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not you know progressing the last</p>
<p>thing I want to mention is that within a</p>
<p>minute fasting you know just like I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if they did this on The</p>
<p>Biggest Loser muscle confusion they</p>
<p>constantly changed the workout I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if they did that probably they did</p>
<p>but we want to also do that with fasting</p>
<p>like maybe you don&rsquo;t eat at the exact</p>
<p>same time each day</p>
<p>let your body tell you when you should</p>
<p>eat like even with some people I find</p>
<p>that maybe every third day there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not eating</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like eating one meal a day and</p>
<p>then every third day they skip that meal</p>
<p>because they can go longer so it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of a mini periodic prolonged fasting</p>
<p>every so often but not on a regular</p>
<p>basis kind of like you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>tricking your body into it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know what&rsquo;s gonna eat that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily slow the metabolism</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re actually you have your</p>
<p>insulin low but it might kind of reset</p>
<p>and your and to lose more weight so</p>
<p>prolonged fasting periodically but not</p>
<p>in a pattern is very powerful to bust</p>
<p>through that Plateau</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s exactly what I found I mean</p>
<p>if I look at this week I start off</p>
<p>Sunday night is is Sundays</p>
<p>my kind of high-fat day and then I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>either go into a and again I worked up</p>
<p>to this point so anybody who&rsquo;s listening</p>
<p>this is this is something that&rsquo;s worked</p>
<p>up over time but I&rsquo;ll do a 48 or 36 hour</p>
<p>fast from Sunday night</p>
<p>so either Tuesday lunch or Tuesday night</p>
<p>I leave my one meal a day that makes</p>
<p>Tuesday one meal a day Wednesday is on</p>
<p>also one meal a day Thursday might be</p>
<p>another fasting day I might eat Friday</p>
<p>morning and then eat and then give it</p>
<p>another 8 or so hours and maybe eat a</p>
<p>little bit Friday night Saturday and</p>
<p>Sunday I eat two good meals on Saturday</p>
<p>and Sunday and some fat and then I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>switch it up a little bit next week</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good that&rsquo;s good data do you find</p>
<p>that are you actually hungry when you</p>
<p>eat or you just eat like oh I just have</p>
<p>to eat or are you actually hungry right</p>
<p>before you have to eat well funny thing</p>
<p>about hunger as someone who who never</p>
<p>had an off on switch my whole life I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had to really learn this Kido has helped</p>
<p>me to really learn this for or into</p>
<p>minute fasting has helped me to really</p>
<p>learn hunger and I find I&rsquo;m in a car all</p>
<p>the time I exercise at gas stations I</p>
<p>exercise when I&rsquo;m in the Verizon store</p>
<p>that was in the Verizon store one day</p>
<p>but I am going to get some exercising</p>
<p>because it is it is found to me to break</p>
<p>any plateau that I have if I do a little</p>
<p>bit of exercise now I refuse to do</p>
<p>exercise that I can&rsquo;t maintain every</p>
<p>week of my life and a few hours of</p>
<p>exercise in but I do my squats my</p>
<p>push-ups and go up and down stairs or</p>
<p>maybe some cardio or some of the things</p>
<p>you see behind me bodyweight exercise I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do a lot of it I just want to keep</p>
<p>moving and keep strong I am 60 years old</p>
<p>here in a couple months and what the</p>
<p>oils in my body now and the good fats</p>
<p>keep my bones from cracking and creaking</p>
<p>I get out of bed in the morning and I</p>
<p>feel alive I feel my breath and I can</p>
<p>get through my day without a pain</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just really wonderful</p>
<p>buzz def I&rsquo;m gonna pop that I had I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>switch it up all the time now but think</p>
<p>back to the Hunger think the hunger does</p>
<p>go away it can make it through a</p>
<p>30-minute time period and maybe drink</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rate some of your minerals in my</p>
<p>water so I just hit some more of that if</p>
<p>I get hungry when I&rsquo;m out there but but</p>
<p>most of most of my success has been</p>
<p>working up here on the things that make</p>
<p>me tea and the things that stress me out</p>
<p>and just if you don&rsquo;t attack some of the</p>
<p>things up here why I&rsquo;m overeating my</p>
<p>portion control has been a big thing for</p>
<p>me because I&rsquo;ve always had what I call a</p>
<p>fat mine I mean he would have sold my</p>
<p>plate before I would have had two big</p>
<p>pork chops on it or a 16-ounce piece of</p>
<p>steak now I have my four ounce piece of</p>
<p>meat and ate red meat a lot less</p>
<p>frequently than I did before</p>
<p>well that I want to just interject</p>
<p>because I think that this whole thing</p>
<p>with calories</p>
<p>Oh calories don&rsquo;t matter listener well</p>
<p>if you look at the macros on the healthy</p>
<p>version of keto you have moderate</p>
<p>protein we&rsquo;re not talking high protein</p>
<p>moderate protein three to six ounces</p>
<p>depending on your size you may be a</p>
<p>little more a little less and then you</p>
<p>have a lot of vegetables and then you</p>
<p>have a certain amount of fat and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the wild variable so as you get in the</p>
<p>keto you start reducing that so but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not we&rsquo;re not actually this is not</p>
<p>the same as what a lot of other people</p>
<p>are preaching like oh you just got to</p>
<p>lower your calories globally no that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not about that it&rsquo;s like shifting your</p>
<p>calories to manipulate your hormones so</p>
<p>if you have a low calorie diet with a</p>
<p>little bit of fruit a little bit of the</p>
<p>wrong thing and you snack through the</p>
<p>day you are gonna have a heck of a time</p>
<p>trying to get into fat burning because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that insulin spike so it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>understanding um</p>
<p>how to do this right did you I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what what you had the sign what you</p>
<p>can say what you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t say with the biggest losers but</p>
<p>was there anyone and I&rsquo;m just curious</p>
<p>and you can say nothing but was there</p>
<p>anyone like do they recommend any type</p>
<p>of pills or anything to enhance your</p>
<p>metabolism like caffeine pills or</p>
<p>anything like that it was it was</p>
<p>probably the most tightest controlled</p>
<p>environment I&rsquo;ve ever been in my life</p>
<p>and and there was never anything like</p>
<p>that okay on that show and in fact if I</p>
<p>could say everything you did even from</p>
<p>weigh-ins they made sure you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dehydrated over dehydrated you weighed</p>
<p>in three days in a row if that&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>trade secret but the reason of that was</p>
<p>to make sure you weren&rsquo;t dehydrating and</p>
<p>the matreya didn&rsquo;t have a big weight</p>
<p>gain after weigh-in I mean it was it was</p>
<p>total control right and then what about</p>
<p>did you make some friends and follow up</p>
<p>with people did they also gain the</p>
<p>weight back I&rsquo;m on a a had a Facebook</p>
<p>group I guess with probably 300 other</p>
<p>biggest losers who have shared this</p>
<p>unique experience some of course and the</p>
<p>ones that are weren&rsquo;t happy with the</p>
<p>results that they got but but most</p>
<p>people if not all have an immediate</p>
<p>weight gain at first but most of the</p>
<p>ones I know find a point and come back</p>
<p>to like where I am now 30 40 pounds</p>
<p>overweight and some are satisfied there</p>
<p>some have gone and taken all their</p>
<p>weight back off but we still support</p>
<p>each other because it&rsquo;s it was an</p>
<p>interesting phenomenon that not a lot of</p>
<p>people get to go through and yeah I bet</p>
<p>you I and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;d be interesting</p>
<p>to see if they&rsquo;re reaching for keto and</p>
<p>just by your story I&rsquo;d be interesting if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like oh that&rsquo;s a great I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>to look into that there there are many</p>
<p>there are many who are and and is at</p>
<p>least low carb high fat synonymous terms</p>
<p>with me I&rsquo;m you know I&rsquo;m old enough that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been around and remember Atkins and</p>
<p>I remember how popular it was and I</p>
<p>remember being on the Atkins that it</p>
<p>started off very healthy too and it</p>
<p>and I had the same press that Kido gets</p>
<p>now and had a whole lot of people making</p>
<p>comments about it without a whole lot of</p>
<p>scientific fact and and again you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>expert in the field you make a living</p>
<p>doing this Jillian Michaels is an expert</p>
<p>she makes a living doing what she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing she&rsquo;s very good at what she does</p>
<p>she has a lot of really good things to</p>
<p>say but you&rsquo;re always on the spot for</p>
<p>the things that you say that someone</p>
<p>could interpret them in a different</p>
<p>light or you know again I&rsquo;m 60 years old</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said too many things with my own</p>
<p>mouth that have got me in trouble my</p>
<p>whole life then I try you know no matter</p>
<p>how hard you try you can&rsquo;t avoid that</p>
<p>sometimes but the I guess the whole if I</p>
<p>had that Jillian Michaels is fantastic</p>
<p>at what she does</p>
<p>I would never criticize her for that but</p>
<p>some of the statements that she said</p>
<p>were just totally not scientific in fact</p>
<p>and and that&rsquo;s okay that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s give her a break you know</p>
<p>hopefully with you would you would learn</p>
<p>the science and then come back maybe</p>
<p>stay maybe this isn&rsquo;t true but that that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen a lot yeah my only point</p>
<p>with that is that you know there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of people struggling just like you were</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking at things and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no denying that the kedo</p>
<p>lifestyle helps you lose weight but what</p>
<p>happens is what&rsquo;s right now their</p>
<p>pudding is just a little bit of doubt</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s an unhealthy way to do it that</p>
<p>doubt could be the reason why they might</p>
<p>not even do it because they&rsquo;re operating</p>
<p>off of some completely false information</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re looking at the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet as the diet that&rsquo;s been researched</p>
<p>over the last hundred years with</p>
<p>children which I believe is not very</p>
<p>healthy but it the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lowering carbs does help epilepsy but</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just do any type of fat you</p>
<p>have to do a healthy version and of</p>
<p>course no one&rsquo;s talking about that</p>
<p>really important point if you combine</p>
<p>healthy version which is basically</p>
<p>quality foods with</p>
<p>nutrients and the benefit of lowering</p>
<p>your carbs it will solve a lot of your</p>
<p>health problems without having to even a</p>
<p>tackle these symptoms individually so so</p>
<p>this is that&rsquo;s the kind of the beef no</p>
<p>pun intended that I have with some of</p>
<p>the comments out there it&rsquo;s a just to</p>
<p>just you you should these people should</p>
<p>be able to get the truth the facts about</p>
<p>doing it healthily and not have that</p>
<p>doubt in their mind because</p>
<p>unfortunately I did that video and I</p>
<p>read some of the comments and they were</p>
<p>there are a lot of people I mean most of</p>
<p>the people were like wow this is great</p>
<p>but then there was a percentage that</p>
<p>like yeah I&rsquo;m a little scared now I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m gonna try it like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too bad because you could probably</p>
<p>benefit from it I said I see what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying in a good case in point was</p>
<p>almost the very second that article came</p>
<p>out maybe thirty minutes later I posted</p>
<p>a picture of what a high fat meal is it</p>
<p>was a piece of fish on a bed of cabbage</p>
<p>that was cooked in butter the fish was</p>
<p>cooked in olive oil and I had a side of</p>
<p>kale salad that had more olive oil on</p>
<p>and the first comment that I got back</p>
<p>with someone sent me Jillian&rsquo;s comments</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re right people see things and if</p>
<p>it keeps them from from make</p>
<p>experiencing something that will change</p>
<p>their life it doable to maintain the</p>
<p>rest of your life there people been on</p>
<p>keto for 20 years now or eating low carb</p>
<p>rice for 20-30 years and and living just</p>
<p>great and uh I&rsquo;m fact you just gave me a</p>
<p>good idea I think I&rsquo;m gonna do a</p>
<p>specific video on what seventy-five</p>
<p>percent or 70 percent fat percentage of</p>
<p>your calories looks like on your plate</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give a lot of examples because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking well seventy percent of</p>
<p>your calories well you have to realize</p>
<p>the calories are more than double other</p>
<p>macros so you&rsquo;re dealing with it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not seventy five percent volume like in</p>
<p>grains yes its calories</p>
<p>so when you look at the plate you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only talking a a quarter of your plate</p>
<p>is fat but it&rsquo;s mixing with the protein</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not what people think so I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m gonna clarify that point and</p>
<p>probably the biggest biggest mistake</p>
<p>that people are having it by not logging</p>
<p>in their food is they don&rsquo;t see that if</p>
<p>you log in your food and you&rsquo;re checking</p>
<p>it mail by bill sometimes longer then I</p>
<p>log it in a lot before I eat it dude</p>
<p>just to see where I&rsquo;m at is Wow I need</p>
<p>to make another choice hmm that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>point I love it it&rsquo;s so easy to get 70%</p>
<p>fat in India without without tunning in</p>
<p>all kinds of extra fat now you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to I have learned some other</p>
<p>healthy habits that I do you know a</p>
<p>little bit of olive oil on an avocado</p>
<p>oh what a snack that is with a little</p>
<p>bit of salt but one question I one</p>
<p>question I forgot to ask you when you</p>
<p>did with their eating plan a low-fat</p>
<p>plan what you&rsquo;re taught all kind of</p>
<p>really great things about vegetables and</p>
<p>how to cook them prepare them in</p>
<p>nutrition and and then again you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>monitored and if you get if you say I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna eat only protein or I&rsquo;m gonna eat</p>
<p>something you get a phone call or you</p>
<p>get a visit and and you have to</p>
<p>straighten that out right away but the</p>
<p>the meal plan was just to make sure that</p>
<p>you could sustain the amount of workout</p>
<p>that you were doing the frequency of</p>
<p>eating was probably necessary for what</p>
<p>we were doing so but but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily specifically tell you you</p>
<p>have to go lean protein or low fat</p>
<p>proteins okay interests ahead I mean I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>what and you watch people who eat</p>
<p>chocolate oatmeal the first few days and</p>
<p>then people were eating and don&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>eating some lunch meat and processed</p>
<p>meats and some I mean most of the foods</p>
<p>there is clean but but you could request</p>
<p>some some special things if you if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been eating them for a long time</p>
<p>but you know pretty soon every</p>
<p>the processed foods disappear all the</p>
<p>big grains and some of them will still</p>
<p>be eat some grains and some potatoes and</p>
<p>things like that but but it gets</p>
<p>narrowed down you you know you know most</p>
<p>of the people if we were really high on</p>
<p>knowledge before we went there we</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be there so we show up they</p>
<p>give us as much knowledge as we can and</p>
<p>the dynamic of the shows is you figure</p>
<p>it out as you go and some figured out a</p>
<p>little bit more than others Wow well I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t go ahead and I&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>when you can sit there though and</p>
<p>exercise 35 40 hours a week and and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating a healthy amount of</p>
<p>calories 16 1700 1800 calories for for a</p>
<p>diet is not too extreme if you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to count the calories but when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing that and still only lose one or</p>
<p>two pounds a week something hormonal E</p>
<p>is happening in your body it&rsquo;s not being</p>
<p>addressed and that makes that makes a</p>
<p>lot of sense and again I figured it out</p>
<p>through keto so Wow yeah and I think</p>
<p>because of this this whole experience in</p>
<p>your life you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re gonna even</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna decided to start coaching</p>
<p>people or maybe you&rsquo;re already doing it</p>
<p>now right I&rsquo;m working you behind me I</p>
<p>have a big backyard we do every once in</p>
<p>a while just enjoy working with people</p>
<p>one because it helps me keep me</p>
<p>accountable I have had boot camps in the</p>
<p>past we last three or four months and</p>
<p>then on to something else I&rsquo;ll take it</p>
<p>an individual and work with an</p>
<p>individual one on one sometimes I work a</p>
<p>lot I&rsquo;m a sales manager so I traveled a</p>
<p>lot and I mean someday I hope to be</p>
<p>doing some health coaching full-time or</p>
<p>find another alternative I&rsquo;ve got a lot</p>
<p>of things that I&rsquo;m that I&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>now that may come to fruition in the</p>
<p>future but uh yeah we get together here</p>
<p>and have a lot of fun I think you you</p>
<p>took my health coaching course right I</p>
<p>did I loved every bit of it again it</p>
<p>kept me accountable but it helped me</p>
<p>learn</p>
<p>so much and get focused and get nerdy</p>
<p>and I would recommend that to anybody</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t want to be a health</p>
<p>coach Wow</p>
<p>if they really learned that the amount</p>
<p>of information that&rsquo;s put forth I think</p>
<p>it took me a little longer than most</p>
<p>people with my work I probably got</p>
<p>through in about four months but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going over and over that information</p>
<p>about you know it&rsquo;s a one last point</p>
<p>about that it&rsquo;s the way I like to solve</p>
<p>problems is through understanding the</p>
<p>problem and the more you can understand</p>
<p>about it and have the correct knowledge</p>
<p>you that&rsquo;s how you solve problems just</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t if you are an expert in</p>
<p>marriage counseling but you&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>been married</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s not gonna work so if you</p>
<p>actually have the full knowledge of</p>
<p>insulin and the different hormones and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be really hard for you to</p>
<p>beat poorly it&rsquo;s really hard for me to</p>
<p>eat junk food now because I have such a</p>
<p>deep understanding of what it does in</p>
<p>the body the consequences so on that and</p>
<p>then the other thing is that I think one</p>
<p>of the therapies for myself is helping</p>
<p>others so your you it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>therapeutic thing to create a difference</p>
<p>in someone&rsquo;s life and help them it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like I just love doing and in fact if I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t if I&rsquo;m not helping people on a</p>
<p>constant basis I&rsquo;m not as happy so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a it&rsquo;s a good therapy to have a tool</p>
<p>that you can really create a difference</p>
<p>so from that viewpoint it&rsquo;s awesome I</p>
<p>loved it I love to read comments on your</p>
<p>Facebook page and I hang around the</p>
<p>obesity code website a lot for fasting I</p>
<p>love the work they&rsquo;re doing in Canada</p>
<p>Jason funk and seeing people doing what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing just keeps you on course on</p>
<p>that out through the Biggest Loser and</p>
<p>we stay in contact all the time I still</p>
<p>a trainer from the biggest loaners loser</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the people who are out there</p>
<p>intermittent fasting every day that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching them struggle mm-hmm can</p>
<p>comment every once in a while on their</p>
<p>comments help me that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>work love</p>
<p>Thank You Rob so much this has been very</p>
<p>enlightening I think people are gonna</p>
<p>get a lot out of it and I appreciate</p>
<p>your time thank you</p>
<p>thank you very much it was an honor to</p>
<p>be here with you you are my mentor in</p>
<p>this and I thank you for everything that</p>
<p>uh that you&rsquo;ve done specially through</p>
<p>the health coaching class to help keep</p>
<p>me centered my pleasure</p>
