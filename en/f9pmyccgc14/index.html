<p>up in the middle of the night with those</p>
<p>diabetic tremors just going downstairs</p>
<p>and eating food and sanely we got a new</p>
<p>mattress because we thought the mattress</p>
<p>was bad and no it was just the weight on</p>
<p>my bones the arthritis was just horrible</p>
<p>yeah and we both I was destitute and we</p>
<p>were went out to dinner with some</p>
<p>friends and my husband was like well I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try out games and the friend said</p>
<p>well hey try this stuff called keto and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like what is that and so my</p>
<p>husband started at first two weeks</p>
<p>before I&rsquo;m like listen you started I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>terrible at diets I never succeed on any</p>
<p>of them fine then we went and started</p>
<p>with a new direct primary care physician</p>
<p>and he was actually also very kedo</p>
<p>supportive and after hearing my history</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>weight issues diet challenges my health</p>
<p>concerns my diagnosis he&rsquo;s like please</p>
<p>just give give keto a month I said fine</p>
<p>you know I whatever I&rsquo;ll just try the</p>
<p>stuff I&rsquo;ll humor you guys I&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>fail again I had a call in to work with</p>
<p>one of the local bariatric surgeons lo</p>
<p>and behold Kido clicked Wow</p>
<p>yeah can you tell me were you overweight</p>
<p>like five years old or six what did it</p>
<p>was it since birth or was there a</p>
<p>certain time when you&rsquo;re a little kid</p>
<p>that you started noticing you staring</p>
<p>anyway you know um it was mainly my</p>
<p>mother always said that I look like an</p>
<p>emaciated baby but I if you picked me up</p>
<p>I felt very heavy unfortunately my</p>
<p>mother had a very poor self-image of</p>
<p>herself and she projected that onto me</p>
<p>and projected the obesity on to me it</p>
<p>really started when I started going</p>
<p>through puberty I was never a a petite</p>
<p>small frame child I was a medium frame</p>
<p>child but I was a child of the 70s and</p>
<p>we hate grains and we&rsquo;re Italian Irish</p>
<p>so there was carbs carbs carbs</p>
<p>everywhere convenience foods it was a</p>
<p>very poor environment I was in but when</p>
<p>I was about 12 my mom saw that I was</p>
<p>getting pudgy things weren&rsquo;t working out</p>
<p>quite well and that&rsquo;s when she started</p>
<p>me on the diets unbeknownst to both of</p>
<p>us as I matured that&rsquo;s when I was</p>
<p>diagnosed with a comorbidity of PCOS</p>
<p>with primary amenorrhea so right then</p>
<p>and there without knowing what PCOS I</p>
<p>actually wasn&rsquo;t diagnosed with PCOS</p>
<p>until my early 20s but I had the primary</p>
<p>Inman area right there but that right</p>
<p>there was the the indicator and hind</p>
<p>side of the insulin resistance and the</p>
<p>PCOS Wow now did you have heavy periods</p>
<p>around that same time do you have any</p>
<p>issue with your periods right before you</p>
<p>started kind of noticing your weight was</p>
<p>going up at primary memory is the</p>
<p>complete absence of a menses I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>had I never had a natural men seized on</p>
<p>my own until too</p>
<p>taquito what&rsquo;s the only way I tried</p>
<p>eight years of infertility I was on</p>
<p>birth control pills the endocrinologists</p>
<p>said oh you just need to go on these</p>
<p>birth control pills we&rsquo;ll manage your</p>
<p>you know keep you regular keep</p>
<p>everything clean and then when you get</p>
<p>off we&rsquo;ll give you this magic pill</p>
<p>called clomid that&rsquo;ll work great you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get pregnant no eight years of</p>
<p>infertility multiple tries of clomid 8iu</p>
<p>is and to IVFs I was not successful I</p>
<p>would successfully conceive but I would</p>
<p>miscarry because my progesterone levels</p>
<p>were extremely low so I that was the</p>
<p>only way I could ever have a cycle was</p>
<p>through medication so so we&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>11 or 12 or 13 you didn&rsquo;t even have any</p>
<p>cycles at all no I had a complete I had</p>
<p>no signs you can see that the estrogen</p>
<p>was coming in I was developing body hair</p>
<p>I was developing my breasts I was by all</p>
<p>appearances I was developing just like</p>
<p>my peers unfortunately I never</p>
<p>experience the natural menses wow that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating so here you are you going</p>
<p>through your let&rsquo;s say your late teens</p>
<p>and then your 20s and so you basically</p>
<p>what age did you start having that have</p>
<p>your first period again I never I did</p>
<p>not have in my first natural menses</p>
<p>until April 30th 2016 and I just turned</p>
<p>43 okay and the reason being was the</p>
<p>release of the estradiol in the first</p>
<p>month of Kido and since then I have not</p>
<p>had a natural menses again Wow</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve been perimenopause since puberty</p>
<p>amazing so now what about like like</p>
<p>during your 20s you just like try</p>
<p>everything like the typical low calorie</p>
<p>that Atkins the 8th time I tried every</p>
<p>national chain weight loss center I</p>
<p>tried the only time I did successfully</p>
<p>lose weight unfortunately it was in high</p>
<p>school and I developed anorexia bulimia</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>eating disorders and then I didn&rsquo;t lose</p>
<p>weight and the stress of that eating</p>
<p>actually triggered my epilepsy so I also</p>
<p>have partial complex seizures that could</p>
<p>not be regulated through medication</p>
<p>actually through diet and and sleep and</p>
<p>other natural manipulations I was fine</p>
<p>but yeah throughout my entire life I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried the Weight Watchers I&rsquo;ve tried the</p>
<p>Jenny Craig the Nutrisystem I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>to b12 injections</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried starving myself I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>yeah whatever cockamamie you know the</p>
<p>cabbage diet the soup diet the you know</p>
<p>ice chips and bread err i if you can</p>
<p>make it up I tried it and nothing ever</p>
<p>worked</p>
<p>Wow so so last year this is when you</p>
<p>started with 2016 you found keto what</p>
<p>weight were you at your peak was it last</p>
<p>year yes I was any I&rsquo;d say 240 to 250</p>
<p>okay when I&rsquo;ve started with the my</p>
<p>direct primary care physician I had</p>
<p>already</p>
<p>I started eliminating and reducing like</p>
<p>the sodas and some of the cards just by</p>
<p>association because my husband and what</p>
<p>he was cooking when I officially weighed</p>
<p>it was like 225 but before that earlier</p>
<p>in the year I was easily 240 250 Wow</p>
<p>so so you started the keto did you also</p>
<p>do in a minute fasting at the same time</p>
<p>or did you kind of do that later but</p>
<p>then after the first month within by</p>
<p>week 4 or 5 we we stumbled across the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and we started</p>
<p>adhering to it and and can do a 16-8</p>
<p>very easy I tried to do at least in 18 6</p>
<p>2 to 3 times a week</p>
<p>Wow so did you did the weights start</p>
<p>coming off right away or did it take a</p>
<p>while for it to start kicking in because</p>
<p>of my insulin resistance and my</p>
<p>metabolic syndrome and so forth</p>
<p>I was not I&rsquo;d started with the infamous</p>
<p>B pcs in the morning I was not losing</p>
<p>the weight I was getting frustrated</p>
<p>eliminated the B PCs and the</p>
<p>also through trial-and-error just</p>
<p>lowered my carb intake to 12 to 15</p>
<p>window so instead of doing 20 grams a</p>
<p>day I was trying to my goal was 12</p>
<p>XS up to 15 as soon as I started</p>
<p>lowering that the weight started coming</p>
<p>off okay</p>
<p>yeah and so so you started losing weight</p>
<p>and then what are you waiting on one</p>
<p>forty five oh my gosh that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>yep that is I&rsquo;ve maintained that for the</p>
<p>past three to four months so I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m out</p>
<p>of maintenance with my weight as of</p>
<p>right now right now I&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>strength training and toning building up</p>
<p>the muscle mass incredible that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually miraculous if you have people</p>
<p>like coming up to you and just that knew</p>
<p>you before just kind of like is that you</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve had that happen yes several</p>
<p>times I&rsquo;ve been open about my journey</p>
<p>doing this and I&rsquo;ve helped several</p>
<p>friends skin on the keto bandwagon in</p>
<p>fact I have two really good friends we</p>
<p>met up for a weekend actually three of</p>
<p>us we met up for a ketose girls weekend</p>
<p>did some cooking lessons took them out</p>
<p>challenging them to eat in restaurants</p>
<p>and trying some new recipes and stuff</p>
<p>combined at the time in June we had</p>
<p>combined lost over 250 pounds that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s miraculous that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>especially yeah like the all these years</p>
<p>and Olson you just you know still in</p>
<p>your forties you&rsquo;re still able to do it</p>
<p>and you just found this thing I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>amazing yeah I mean if I had not done it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where I would be today I</p>
<p>can just imagine the prominence of all</p>
<p>the autoimmune issues that were just I</p>
<p>could in hindsight again looking at the</p>
<p>symptoms and the feelings that I was</p>
<p>having definitely I was on the road for</p>
<p>some some really massive health issues</p>
<p>at this point oh my gosh what other</p>
<p>health benefits have you had in addition</p>
<p>to the weight loss I like to say we like</p>
<p>to refer the weight loss as the gravy my</p>
<p>anxiety depression I am no longer taking</p>
<p>any medications for that</p>
<p>I have battled anxiety depression mental</p>
<p>health issues my entire life my epilepsy</p>
<p>is gone I have not had any auras I would</p>
<p>have as many would call petit mall I</p>
<p>would go catatonic or it would almost be</p>
<p>like a twitch or Tourette&rsquo;s jerk what</p>
<p>was i I was having I&rsquo;ve not had any of</p>
<p>those I suffered from chronic sinusitis</p>
<p>and severe allergies and where the</p>
<p>chronic sinusitis would emerge and</p>
<p>present itself as a massive migraine</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had many of those not taking</p>
<p>anymore allergy medication for that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had psoriasis and that&rsquo;s all gone as</p>
<p>well so my labs have come back great so</p>
<p>and then the then I&rsquo;ve had some changes</p>
<p>with the hormones as well we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been tweaking that and working on</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really been interesting how</p>
<p>over the year my body it&rsquo;s very evident</p>
<p>how the hormones they AB and they flow</p>
<p>as my body is still trying to to</p>
<p>regulate itself oh yeah I could imagine</p>
<p>I mean let&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s just bring up</p>
<p>the topic of anxiety depression mood</p>
<p>disorders I mean this happens all the</p>
<p>time the amount the direct relationship</p>
<p>between your mood and insulin in some</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s low blood sugars mm-hmm I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s probably so high as a</p>
<p>cause-and-effect relationship and people</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t connect the dots they live</p>
<p>their whole life on meds and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know that you get off that sugar</p>
<p>you fix in some resistance your mood</p>
<p>just I mean I don&rsquo;t know what you feel</p>
<p>but it just brings people up well yeah I</p>
<p>mean I will be honest with everybody I</p>
<p>am a survivor</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a semi-colon survivor I battled it I</p>
<p>battled the demons my entire life it</p>
<p>could be at a drop of a hat where I</p>
<p>could have a massive mood swing and and</p>
<p>the smallest situation would be a</p>
<p>trigger it doesn&rsquo;t and especially with</p>
<p>food and I can now more sensitive and</p>
<p>aware of my stressors</p>
<p>where I may want something and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>turning to the food anymore the food is</p>
<p>not the comfort level for me I&rsquo;m at the</p>
<p>food is not controlling me I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>controlling the food where I&rsquo;m learning</p>
<p>how to reward my I&rsquo;ve learned how to</p>
<p>reward myself without food as the prize</p>
<p>just the societal impact of everywhere</p>
<p>we go everybody wants to eat eat eat and</p>
<p>it gets extremely disturbing now that</p>
<p>you take those blinders off you take</p>
<p>that that and you see how food regulates</p>
<p>and controls everybody that even knows</p>
<p>that even think that they&rsquo;re healthy and</p>
<p>oh we&rsquo;re going to celebrate with this</p>
<p>drinking or this food or that food I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like no let&rsquo;s do something else my sleep</p>
<p>is amazing I had I guess I should have</p>
<p>been tested really for sleep apnea I</p>
<p>never was I used to be a horrible snore</p>
<p>and I remember that weekend away I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known one of the girls since I was a</p>
<p>teenager and she actually woke me up she</p>
<p>thought I had stopped breathing because</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t snoring and I would wake myself</p>
<p>up a story I&rsquo;m also strep positive and I</p>
<p>have not had an outbreak of strep at all</p>
<p>I would normally at least two three</p>
<p>times a year start off with the sinus</p>
<p>infection that would relocate and turn</p>
<p>into bronchitis I&rsquo;ve not had that at all</p>
<p>this year so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>pinpoint all the small idiosyncrasies</p>
<p>that I suffered from pre Kito that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had not experienced this year at all</p>
<p>amazing I mean I still had the same</p>
<p>inhaler I&rsquo;m sorry I saw the same inhaler</p>
<p>since last year I have not had to use it</p>
<p>for my asthma I love it that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>what when&rsquo;s your first meal what time do</p>
<p>you eat I usually get up between 5:00</p>
<p>and 5:30 I do not have an opportunity to</p>
<p>eat until 10:00 10:30 in the morning</p>
<p>okay so I usually am in a window</p>
<p>actually between 10:00 to 5:00 is when I</p>
<p>primarily eat and then in the evening I</p>
<p>might have a cup of black coffee or tea</p>
<p>just something warm and hot and then I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>done for the day awesome and you</p>
<p>doing a snacking or anything like that</p>
<p>nope nope and you find that your hunger</p>
<p>is less like you can just like your it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more comfortable to go from one meal to</p>
<p>the next yeah</p>
<p>the only a lot of it is mental as well</p>
<p>but no I don&rsquo;t have those hunger pains</p>
<p>of those days rain you would wake up and</p>
<p>go oh I&rsquo;m starving I need to eat this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to eat this this</p>
<p>this you know it&rsquo;ll be like oh shoot</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 11 o&rsquo;clock I really should eat</p>
<p>right about now and then even then I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not truly hungry I don&rsquo;t feel those</p>
<p>hunger pains I don&rsquo;t feel that desire of</p>
<p>oh I must eat something it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve retrained your your body retrains</p>
<p>itself physically and emotionally and</p>
<p>mentally again where you&rsquo;re in control</p>
<p>of the food and you know when you should</p>
<p>eat before you get to those hunger pains</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m not mine not feeling those</p>
<p>insulin spikes at all ever doctor that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing</p>
<p>how about about cravings do you have any</p>
<p>cravings I do I do and they&rsquo;re all fat</p>
<p>driven you know I&rsquo;ll make a nice alfredo</p>
<p>sauce or like earlier my husband asked</p>
<p>what we wanted for dinner is I&rsquo;m like I</p>
<p>want a nice filet with some blue cheese</p>
<p>and mushrooms and a big old slab of</p>
<p>butter next to it he&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>girl so I mean that&rsquo;s what I crave or</p>
<p>water truly I I drink over 90 to 120</p>
<p>ounces of water a day and that and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want anything I can&rsquo;t to be honest</p>
<p>I cannot even go down the grocery aisle</p>
<p>where they have the boxed can cereals or</p>
<p>cookies you can smell the sugar just</p>
<p>emanating from those boxes and it mate</p>
<p>literally makes me nauseous now</p>
<p>disgusting and if you told me that a 18</p>
<p>months ago I would have laughed in your</p>
<p>face oh I could imagine I think you</p>
<p>probably the biggest problem is to find</p>
<p>what to use to scoop the butter out to</p>
<p>eat it right it&rsquo;s like okay how can I</p>
<p>eat that butter other than experiment we</p>
<p>have a butter crocks we haven&rsquo;t nice and</p>
<p>soft to go and yeah I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>inhibited at all I&rsquo;m not ashamed to put</p>
<p>butter on anything in fact I went out to</p>
<p>a restaurant the other day and I had a</p>
<p>cheeseburger Mike</p>
<p>you know that side of butter and they</p>
<p>looked at me they&rsquo;re like what you want</p>
<p>mayonnaise mustard like no I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>your over-processed mayonnaise I want</p>
<p>butter and it&rsquo;s delicious you know put</p>
<p>the butter on the eggs put the butter on</p>
<p>the cheeseburger butter is good that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing when he went into ketosis did</p>
<p>you go through any type of changes like</p>
<p>fatigue as your body shifted over you</p>
<p>know I was very blessed and no I did not</p>
<p>my husband went through keto the Nikita</p>
<p>withdrawal to Kino bug I&rsquo;ve known one of</p>
<p>my cousin&rsquo;s I helped I helped get</p>
<p>started on this she went through that I</p>
<p>never experienced any of it Wow now I</p>
<p>will tell you that if I get any hidden</p>
<p>sugars I am highly reactive and you know</p>
<p>I am not perfect</p>
<p>I have dabbled I have indulged in</p>
<p>carbage before and I feel it the next</p>
<p>day the first time I did I had one</p>
<p>cookie that I used to love and adore</p>
<p>within two hours I had a migraine</p>
<p>massive migraine and the next day I had</p>
<p>anxiety I was like oh I need medication</p>
<p>like why and even to this point if I I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like going out to eat at</p>
<p>restaurants because of all the</p>
<p>preservatives and chemicals they put in</p>
<p>the next day I can definitely feel the</p>
<p>eggs you know I will feel anxious go</p>
<p>well what did I eat why do I feel</p>
<p>off-kilter</p>
<p>oh wait I ate this let me look it had</p>
<p>hidden sugars or something to it so I</p>
<p>mean I just have to tell everyone there</p>
<p>is watching you know the whole thing</p>
<p>about being perfect the whole goal is to</p>
<p>not necessarily you know be the in this</p>
<p>mindless constantly eating like the</p>
<p>people that get into this habit of not</p>
<p>even being completely out of control so</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re willing you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna eat that I&rsquo;m gonna react to it but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing it causative ly like you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s gonna happen you&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>unaware and you&rsquo;re like oh I knew that</p>
<p>was gonna happen you know I just gained</p>
<p>a pound of water weight okay you get</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for me and you know I I have high</p>
<p>respect for people like my husband who</p>
<p>have never deviated who have never</p>
<p>cheated for me I know I&rsquo;m a food addict</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an emotional eater so</p>
<p>break that addiction to the foods I mean</p>
<p>I have taken a piece of bread you know</p>
<p>what is something that I used to love</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m craving it I really want it okay</p>
<p>there it is let me taste it I put in my</p>
<p>mouth and go and I analyze why did I</p>
<p>want this it doesn&rsquo;t taste the same</p>
<p>first of all is it the texture isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that this and I kind of break that</p>
<p>emotional connection to it and I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>and I move on I actually end up spitting</p>
<p>the food out and for those that have</p>
<p>stuck with keto long enough and that</p>
<p>have deviated and have had off days the</p>
<p>repercussions once you experience you</p>
<p>know the headaches the anxiety whatever</p>
<p>your old symptoms were you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>your lesson that you don&rsquo;t want to do it</p>
<p>again and in fact if you love your body</p>
<p>enough time it retrains itself now for</p>
<p>me a treat is a frozen raspberry one</p>
<p>frozen raspberry I will put in my mouth</p>
<p>and it is it just totally that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>piece of candy and I&rsquo;m fine with one</p>
<p>raspberry Wow</p>
<p>I agree it&rsquo;s like um you know the you</p>
<p>have two things you have the habit of</p>
<p>doing it for so long it&rsquo;s ingrained as a</p>
<p>memory all the pleasures whatever</p>
<p>temporarily I don&rsquo;t have the physical</p>
<p>craving that your body demands it so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to distinguish the two and</p>
<p>like oh do I really want this no but I</p>
<p>kind of remember what that like that</p>
<p>might have been interesting to eat that</p>
<p>and get the sensation like no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the same anymore like it you see so yeah</p>
<p>I hear what you&rsquo;re saying yep that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve actually helped influence my</p>
<p>father my 80 year old father and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done kind of sloppy keto he lost over 30</p>
<p>pounds he dropped his a1c I think almost</p>
<p>by two whole points Wow</p>
<p>and now we actually are working with our</p>
<p>son who is autistic intellectually</p>
<p>disabled he has some behavior and</p>
<p>cognitive issues and we have been</p>
<p>converting him on taquito and trying to</p>
<p>help improve those you know through</p>
<p>various studies that we&rsquo;re seeing that</p>
<p>are emerging of how with autism and the</p>
<p>inflammation and the neurotransmitter is</p>
<p>how keto can help and especially that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how keto started was to help children</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>pull up see another benefit that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had that my vision has impaired has</p>
<p>improved I&rsquo;ve worn glasses since I was</p>
<p>five</p>
<p>so for 39 years and my optometrist was</p>
<p>amazed that my stigmatism improved by</p>
<p>over three points in my left eye I was</p>
<p>mirror to legal blindness and now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>improved by three points just through</p>
<p>Kido amazing for those people that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand that there&rsquo;s a couple reasons</p>
<p>for that if you take a look at a person</p>
<p>with blood Sugar&rsquo;s with high insulin</p>
<p>with insulin resistance</p>
<p>they usually have damage with the retina</p>
<p>also keto intermittent fasting is</p>
<p>neuroprotective you can actually</p>
<p>regenerate nerve cells and your your</p>
<p>retina is an extension of your brain and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all nerve tissue so you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>more circulation you&rsquo;re getting both you</p>
<p>know more nerve supply so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome I&rsquo;ll have to I&rsquo;ll be curious to</p>
<p>how your your son does over time and</p>
<p>then also your husband he was</p>
<p>interesting because he if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken he had a genetic problem with</p>
<p>cholesterol and he&rsquo;s stuck with it for</p>
<p>months I think I was like seven or eight</p>
<p>months and then it actually got better</p>
<p>and better and better so it just goes to</p>
<p>show you that even if you have a genetic</p>
<p>weakness you can improve things so right</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s amazing all the different we</p>
<p>take for granted now the benefits of</p>
<p>keto that it&rsquo;s so ingrained into us now</p>
<p>how it how it overall is helping us you</p>
<p>know and especially with the etaf adji</p>
<p>the hardest part for me was the hair</p>
<p>because of the trauma that I went</p>
<p>through with healing my body in the</p>
<p>chemo I did experience the dreaded hair</p>
<p>loss but it&rsquo;s coming even better now and</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;ve had straight hair my</p>
<p>entire life and now I actually have</p>
<p>developed a lot of curl in my hair as</p>
<p>well so but for anybody that is afraid</p>
<p>of hearing that about the hair loss</p>
<p>please let them know it&rsquo;s simply</p>
<p>temporary you talk about like in a</p>
<p>minute fasting or kita hair loss yeah I</p>
<p>noticed just shy of about what eight</p>
<p>ten months I started losing more and</p>
<p>more of my hair and it really send out</p>
<p>especially up in this area my</p>
<p>hairdresser who has been my hairdresser</p>
<p>for over ten years was amazed at how my</p>
<p>hair she&rsquo;s seen that the journey of</p>
<p>quito with me and how my hair has</p>
<p>actually changed how I did lose a</p>
<p>significant amount of it but then how</p>
<p>its come back in in a totally different</p>
<p>texture different shade of color and</p>
<p>everything Wow so yep and I checked with</p>
<p>my doctor and he and he agrees that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>due to it&rsquo;s related to you know losing</p>
<p>close to 100 pounds in in that year</p>
<p>window but it&rsquo;s just literally your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s getting rid of all those old</p>
<p>cells and things that were created</p>
<p>before you know keto and just</p>
<p>regenerating and healing that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>amazing story Jennifer I really</p>
<p>appreciate you sharing because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people are in the same</p>
<p>boat and just hearing you they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>want to do this so and I fit my wedding</p>
<p>dress is too big my wedding dress from</p>
<p>22 years ago is too big on me now I</p>
<p>remember trying it on it I couldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>zip it up I couldn&rsquo;t even get around me</p>
<p>and now I put it on and it went out it</p>
<p>has to be taken in so wow that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>problem to have</p>
<p>yeah I never thought in a million years</p>
<p>I thought that this was you know you</p>
<p>know was the fly-by-night the diet du</p>
<p>jour it is not it is it&rsquo;s anybody</p>
<p>everybody that I talked to I encourage</p>
<p>them to give it a try it&rsquo;s how we should</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s truly everybody can benefit from it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s eye-opening it&rsquo;s helped us heal</p>
<p>ourselves physically it&rsquo;s opened our</p>
<p>eyes to how we really should be treating</p>
<p>our body holistically in totality and I</p>
<p>wish everybody would just give it an</p>
<p>opportunity if you can give it a month</p>
<p>to three months you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>regret it</p>

<p>follow stem and Burton X I mean my body</p>

<p>get me to to stimulate for the follicles</p>
<p>that was the only time that my faceplate</p>
<p>you know my skin cleaned up my hair was</p>
<p>glowing my the weight loss would come</p>
<p>off was all for those drugs and the</p>
<p>reproductive endocrinologists the only</p>
