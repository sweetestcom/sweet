    <p>the joe rogan experience</p>
<p>is all the right names on the bottom yep ready hit it</p>
<p>wearing bricks and</p>
<p>tell me where is sanity</p>
<p>bridge no more</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>welcome to the podcast</p>
<p>this podcast comes just a few days</p>
<p>after the passing of our good friend robert schimmel</p>
<p>hilarious comic a great guy</p>
<p>one of the nicest friendliest guys in in</p>
<p>whatever not even in the business his period</p>
<p>he was just</p>
<p>always fun to be around very witty very</p>
<p>smart just cool guy i really</p>
<p>enjoyed his company i</p>
<p>you know i enjoyed</p>
<p>watching him on</p>
<p>stage i enjoyed hanging</p>
<p>out with them the precious few times i got to and</p>
<p>last time i saw him was</p>
<p>a few months ago in</p>
<p>in california it was a</p>
<p>i think it was</p>
<p>right when i was getting back from</p>
<p>colorado i think i&rsquo;m not sure but i you know</p>
<p>only i was just</p>
<p>happy that i got to see him</p>
<p>and then i heard this terrible news</p>
<p>i known he had a</p>
<p>bunch of health problems but</p>
<p>this had nothing</p>
<p>to do with that he was in a car accident</p>
<p>and unfortunately his</p>
<p>daughter was driving it&rsquo;s just a horrible</p>
<p>tragic sad story and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna miss that guy and i&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>proud to have met him and</p>
<p>known him he was a</p>
<p>great guy and if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen his comedy</p>
<p>go just look for it on youtube there&rsquo;s plenty of clips</p>
<p>just a really funny guy and it sucks</p>
<p>seems like comics really have to go through</p>
<p>other comics dying a lot you know</p>
<p>this is one profession that when</p>
<p>somebody dies it really affects the whole</p>
<p>community you know it&rsquo;s not like when you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>mayor and another mayor dies all the mayors feel sad</p>
<p>about that mayor or something you know what i mean like</p>
<p>it seems like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always hearing about another death of a</p>
<p>comic and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing somebody</p>
<p>great somebody&rsquo;s ideas and</p>
<p>like when mitch</p>
<p>hedberg died that was so horrible for me</p>
<p>it was terrible</p>
<p>well i think</p>
<p>comics especially uh</p>
<p>comics especially really</p>
<p>appreciate other</p>
<p>comics they</p>
<p>know what it takes to get to that spot and they</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>in awe of anybody who&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>even though i&rsquo;ve done it even though i&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>you know on</p>
<p>television and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter whenever i see anybody who&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re totally different from me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always like</p>
<p>wow look at that how&rsquo;s that guy doing that</p>
<p>you know even though i do it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still baffled by it</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>learning yeah</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen this other</p>
<p>voice to my</p>
<p>right is my very good friend</p>
<p>tyler knight</p>
<p>and he is our</p>
<p>guest for this week&rsquo;s podcast and very appropriately</p>
<p>tyler is a male</p>
<p>pornographic actor</p>
<p>and a very good dude i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known him for many years</p>
<p>right how many years i know you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna say like two thousand</p>
<p>three two thousand</p>
<p>three we probably met at the bomb squad yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a jujutsu gym in hollywood and</p>
<p>oh by the way this this</p>
<p>podcast and all podcasts sponsored by the flashlight</p>
<p>got one in here</p>
<p>i guess i need to pull</p>
<p>these out every time i talk about it</p>
<p>this is just the box</p>
<p>but this is</p>
<p>where it comes in</p>
<p>and inside this is a tube</p>
<p>see right there</p>
<p>you get to stick your</p>
<p>penis in that feels really good and you know what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot better than</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot better than blow up dolls</p>
<p>could you imagine fucking this thing</p>
<p>this thing looks like</p>
<p>a wrap that you get for your pool that&rsquo;s what it</p>
<p>smells like and feels like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a wrap for your pool</p>
<p>how would you fuck a rat from your pool that</p>
<p>smells like fucking</p>
<p>i wonder if</p>
<p>you really fucking hard if you get a lot of friction</p>
<p>going on and</p>
<p>start to smell like burning plastic yeah</p>
<p>smells like i</p>
<p>yeah don&rsquo;t think it kind of would</p>
<p>smell like burning plastic if you could</p>
<p>that would be your goal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the joanna and</p>
<p>joanna angel one has all her</p>
<p>tattoos though</p>
<p>nice lisa&rsquo;s got all her</p>
<p>tattoos you</p>
<p>could totally pretend that you were fucking her</p>
<p>way better off</p>
<p>ladies gentlemen with a</p>
<p>flashlight and if</p>
<p>you have a favorite pornographic actress just watch her</p>

<p>and that they had</p>
<p>these dudes in the room with</p>
<p>machine guns and shit they were trying to make porn</p>
<p>but they were</p>
<p>trying to they couldn&rsquo;t get the dudes to perform good</p>
<p>so now they were trying to get</p>
<p>into a porn</p>
<p>better no no</p>
<p>the people behind it were all they all obviously had</p>
<p>unscrupulous</p>
<p>businesses and they needed to protect themselves</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t just doing porn</p>
<p>so they had a</p>
<p>flu they flew him in to</p>
<p>teach these</p>
<p>other porn guys how to fuck correctly</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like i</p>
<p>gotta perform in</p>
<p>front of these dudes machine guns</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>speak spanish it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>crazy story man</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>those stories are</p>
<p>great man jesus christ you know and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funny thing</p>
<p>about porn we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about porn on the show</p>
<p>a lot you know it&rsquo;s a subject that</p>
<p>always comes up because to me it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>when something that everybody loves to do is</p>
<p>taboo for others to see</p>
<p>and for you to perform in for you to do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>sex if you don&rsquo;t like sex is probably something</p>
<p>wrong with your body right</p>
<p>so what is the big fucking deal</p>
<p>about having sex on camera and why</p>
<p>why do people trip</p>
<p>about it so hard</p>
<p>well nowadays it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a career move</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s yeah right</p>
<p>you have heidi and spencer</p>
<p>shopping their sex tapes to viv and what not and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like what are you</p>
<p>gonna have next like fucking</p>
<p>disney people or whatever you know when</p>
<p>their career</p>
<p>starts to low a little bit when they get old like</p>
<p>25 yes but if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lucky yeah if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lucky we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>wrong with that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the next that&rsquo;s the next</p>
<p>level this who</p>
<p>would have ever thought this kim</p>
<p>kardashian thing</p>
<p>would have ever gotten this far</p>
<p>i know a guy</p>
<p>that does that for a living he has a website that does</p>
<p>hollywood sex</p>
<p>tapes and he tells me the offers he has on his table is</p>
<p>ridiculous like he&rsquo;s got like 20 lindsay lohans</p>

<p>i mean i&rsquo;m happy you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>happy person but</p>
<p>is this what we need to talk</p>
<p>about here in people fucking magazine</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna find someone who just sums someone</p>
<p>some dude just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even a singer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like an actor it&rsquo;s not a writer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a person</p>
<p>some guy living somewhere</p>
<p>like i always thought that</p>
<p>those magazines when they talked</p>
<p>about people</p>
<p>there was some sort of an interesting fascinating story</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what it is now</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s just people</p>
<p>getting people to pay attention to them</p>
<p>and then they make</p>
<p>money off it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just fucking people</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no art there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no singing there&rsquo;s no dancing there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>writing there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>craft nothing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>offering shit they&rsquo;re just being themselves it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy that that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s really here</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny said i mean we&rsquo;re in a unique time right now</p>
<p>where the american middle</p>
<p>class dream is fucking</p>
<p>shrinking is</p>
<p>going down the toilet right</p>
<p>and at the same time</p>
<p>this this this is happening to the average american</p>
<p>you have this obsession</p>
<p>where you know we</p>
<p>value celebrity for nothing</p>
<p>you know with without merit whatsoever so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>interesting you know i mean what the what does that say</p>
<p>about us you know</p>
<p>i think we&rsquo;re lost</p>
<p>yeah yeah i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why politicians</p>
<p>just to find doing crazy shit</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>these monkeys are so out of</p>
<p>their fucking minds anyway look at what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re paying attention to look at what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>we can get them</p>
<p>to do whatever we want let&rsquo;s just get them get the</p>
<p>money just get the money</p>
<p>take good care of them don&rsquo;t do anything too crazy</p>
<p>but just get the</p>
<p>money and just they&rsquo;ll do it they&rsquo;ll do it yeah those</p>
<p>those common denominator like</p>
<p>generation ago was pretty much the</p>
<p>standard for it is</p>
<p>right now today yeah</p>
<p>and the access to information</p>
<p>and the you know the the internet and</p>
<p>everything is</p>
<p>is offered people more more ability to learn</p>
<p>but i think the</p>
<p>the bottom line is less people are</p>
<p>smart now like</p>
<p>the a smaller percentage</p>
<p>maybe but then we have</p>
<p>thirty years ago yeah but then</p>
<p>maybe you think the internet has made everyone more</p>
<p>smarter by you know</p>
<p>everyone using it everyone</p>
<p>using it yes everyone</p>
<p>using it yes but i</p>
<p>think people are resisting that i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are resisting that</p>
<p>then a lot of people are not</p>
<p>using the internet to find out information they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using it just for gossip</p>
<p>to using it</p>
<p>just to find out what he&rsquo;s doing that she&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>i would like to know like what the percentage of</p>
<p>the internet</p>
<p>is just into people gossiping and bullshitting</p>
<p>about things google will sell you that information for</p>
<p>twenty dollars joe</p>
<p>because when i go to my message board</p>
<p>a good percentage of threads are on you know just</p>
<p>you know silly shit</p>
<p>gossipy shit yes become the new tv the new</p>
<p>get done with your hard day work sit in</p>
<p>front of this</p>
<p>thing and just like turn your</p>
<p>brain off that&rsquo;s fucking addictive though man you ever</p>

<p>they were pretty good but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some there&rsquo;s some an artistic quality to this one</p>
<p>and the way they</p>
<p>chose to put</p>
<p>piece it together</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>brilliant man that&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>kind of brilliance</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no one paying them to do that</p>
<p>you know no one&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not a big corporation behind that</p>

<p>those people</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know any of</p>
<p>those people that&rsquo;s what it is no</p>
<p>no no the news</p>
<p>thing that we just saw</p>
<p>why i believe it&rsquo;s fake</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very similar to what a lot of people do</p>
<p>which is something i do</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s taking</p>
<p>footage and editing into real news stories</p>
<p>and just making it a little bit off</p>
<p>if you yeah but that</p>
<p>would have come out by now dude this is on the</p>
<p>news people actually saw this and we&rsquo;re like this is</p>

<p>think it was</p>
<p>both of them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty interesting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that it really is become like a dialect</p>
<p>and it could branch off if there was more</p>
<p>separatism between</p>
<p>people that</p>
<p>spoke in ebonics and</p>
<p>it could become another language easily</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not but fucking china is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing like a</p>
<p>bunch different versions of chinese cantonese</p>
<p>and mandarin</p>
<p>mandarin and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other ones</p>
<p>right yeah there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a bunch of different</p>
<p>right you know what my favorite ebonics is</p>
<p>you remember this</p>
<p>you know dialects</p>
<p>exist even in like italian my grandmother</p>
<p>spoke a very certain dialect</p>
<p>she was i think she was from sicily</p>

<p>speaking people what the fuck is this bitch saying</p>
<p>what is this i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s not working but</p>
<p>what is it though</p>
<p>the old delta bonix commercial remember that old</p>
<p>like youtube video from a long time ago</p>

<p>about the scene from airplane where the</p>
<p>woman was there and the two guys were sitting there</p>

<p>3d yesterday oh</p>
<p>how was it why did it get such good reviews it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be good it&rsquo;s terrible but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never seen a more blatant</p>
<p>combination of titties and murder</p>
<p>like it was</p>
<p>a cavalcade of tits</p>
<p>i mean if it wasn&rsquo;t just like one pair of</p>
<p>tits it was like</p>
<p>a full on girls gone wild movie</p>
<p>with monsters</p>
<p>and there was even a guy who played</p>
<p>jerry o&rsquo;connell</p>
<p>he plays a girls gone wild type</p>
<p>producer guy a sleazy</p>
<p>coked up dude is yelling at everybody</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s really rude to</p>
<p>these girls he plays this guy and of course he gets</p>
<p>eaten by the pron</p>
<p>on the pros like a spring</p>
<p>break kind of thing yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the whole it&rsquo;s a girls gone wild episode it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>tits everywhere</p>
<p>naked girls</p>
<p>swimming in the water</p>
<p>tits and parasailing tits are</p>
<p>bouncing up in the back of boats</p>
<p>dancing dudes and</p>
<p>girls grinding</p>
<p>tits in three d</p>
<p>and then yeah</p>
<p>tits in three d and</p>
<p>yes the 3d was</p>

<p>now i think they&rsquo;re calling it</p>
<p>some new we</p>
<p>call it some new</p>
<p>thing but god damn it was good it</p>
<p>was really good like the text in the beginning when you</p>
<p>first see when</p>
<p>the credits</p>
<p>start rolling in the</p>
<p>very beginning</p>
<p>the text just jumps out in a way that i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think they did with avatar</p>
<p>because avatar was like 3d</p>
<p>after the fact right</p>
<p>right they didn&rsquo;t film it no no no they made</p>
<p>out for 3d oh i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking of</p>
<p>alice in wonderland yeah right</p>
<p>this is better than that this like jumps out at you</p>
<p>it even seemed</p>
<p>to jump out of you more than avatar it seems cleaner</p>
<p>you know avatar there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still some ghosting to it</p>
<p>you know so like even though you&rsquo;re seeing the guys</p>
<p>floating in the air</p>

<p>fascinating they get all worked up and shit you know</p>
<p>that one one day most of like it is one</p>
<p>thing that they feel justified right</p>
<p>well the funny</p>
<p>thing is one dude most of</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>idiots but one dude actually</p>
<p>wrote a really well thought out argument</p>
<p>of like why shouldn&rsquo;t</p>

<p>absolutely no control over</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t ask to be born</p>
<p>white stupid you just born white</p>
<p>what a fucking strange</p>
<p>thing to trip on yeah</p>

<p>would be real uncomfortable</p>
<p>if they found out</p>
<p>their chick had</p>
<p>done porn with a black eye</p>
<p>my dad would</p>
<p>be really uncomfortable if i had sex with the black guy</p>
<p>me too woody</p>

<p>maybe he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those if you&rsquo;re just as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>happy brian</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s one of those guys</p>
<p>how many how many</p>
<p>death threats have you gotten</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s funny usually it was</p>
<p>usual like this is a normal course i can say usually</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not something you want the same sentence with</p>
<p>death threat</p>
<p>right usually in</p>
<p>death threat</p>
<p>but usually like</p>
<p>maybe two or</p>
<p>three a month not that</p>
<p>wow but i suck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s picked up</p>
<p>quite a bit because i did a couple of</p>
<p>tiger woods parodies</p>
<p>oh yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right you did a</p>
<p>tyler would</p>
<p>tyler would</p>
<p>tyler would</p>
<p>tyler would</p>
<p>and on top of that i did something else for another</p>
<p>company then they didn&rsquo;t tell me the who the girls were</p>
<p>until i&rsquo;m on set</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s three a</p>
<p>tiger which is mistresses</p>
<p>wow and i wrote a</p>
<p>story about that and then i got like</p>
<p>you know thirty</p>
<p>death threats off that</p>
<p>alone are you serious</p>
<p>piss off golfers</p>

<p>drunk doing as for fun</p>
<p>could be who who was like what kind of dudes all</p>
<p>all racist people all</p>
<p>white people</p>
<p>well actually no surprisingly some of them are actually</p>
<p>tigers fans whatever that</p>
<p>are that are pissed</p>
<p>at me for perpetuating and parroting the situation in</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>leave him alone and oh come on he&rsquo;s a sensitive guy wow</p>
<p>it is fucked</p>
<p>up that he&rsquo;s getting attacked like this but you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the way it is it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to accept that dude it goes with the territory</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out in the public i&rsquo;m exactly</p>
<p>i mean i could</p>
<p>be working into cubicles</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s not out in the public</p>
<p>eye like make</p>
<p>jagger or something he&rsquo;s out in the public</p>
<p>eye with this</p>
<p>super squeaky</p>
<p>clean image and you find out he&rsquo;s out freak yeah</p>
<p>i mean how can people not trip on that it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to them when they</p>
<p>think something&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing it turns out to be</p>
<p>absolutely the opposite of what they were you know</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s being sold as</p>
<p>he sold as being a squeaky</p>
<p>clean guy and he&rsquo;s a freak</p>
<p>but you you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>known freak</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s okay yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m cool with the dude dude you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very normal for a guy in the business now i&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>a bunch of dudes from</p>
<p>especially from jujitsu</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>a lot of porn guys like to do jujitsu</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve known guys for comedy too</p>
<p>a lot of them are really cool guys but you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>especially normal</p>
<p>oh how the fuck</p>
<p>does that happen it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>dude i don&rsquo;t know man i</p>
<p>guess i guess the main thing is i</p>
<p>i compartmentalize my life</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>people i train with friends i meet through</p>
<p>training like you</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one compartment right there</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the compartment of</p>
<p>my normal everyday home life where i go to escape</p>
<p>work and everything and then just work</p>
<p>and they never intersect</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the best way i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when i leave said i</p>
<p>leave tyler and</p>
<p>i at the door and i just become me regular guy and you</p>
<p>know well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a very calm guy but you do a lot of wild shit</p>
<p>outside of even porn i know you&rsquo;ve done a</p>
<p>bunch of boxing matches</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t you do an mma</p>
<p>fight in a porn</p>
<p>movie yeah really</p>
<p>now tell me tell me what this was all</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s it called too</p>
<p>you fought aaron brink as it</p>
<p>was yeah you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t even been</p>
<p>training you know</p>
<p>hardly even</p>
<p>training right no i</p>
<p>think the last time i</p>
<p>train was probably the last time you saw me</p>
<p>so you just fought</p>
<p>aaron brink with no</p>
<p>training yeah pretty much on</p>
<p>three days notice and he had like he was actually</p>
<p>training for yeah another professional</p>
<p>fight and quinn</p>
<p>exactly he was in</p>
<p>good shape yeah</p>
<p>fucking ripped</p>
<p>like two hundred and three</p>
<p>pounds dangerous yeah</p>
<p>so so you actually had an mma</p>
<p>fight with him</p>
<p>yeah the way</p>
<p>it was set up was this because it wasn&rsquo;t sanctioned and</p>
<p>you know there wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>three ringside</p>
<p>judges the way they did it was</p>
<p>they had a grappling</p>
<p>round first</p>
<p>right and then they had a</p>
<p>strikey round afterwards</p>
<p>and the winner gets to bang this really hot</p>
<p>chick and the</p>
<p>loser gets to fuck a girl that looks like grimace</p>
<p>and you have like hold her by</p>
<p>flippers and you know</p>
<p>i i get you know those</p>
<p>phone calls you get it like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re just waking up like for us it&rsquo;s like noon</p>
<p>basically you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>still trying to get your shit together and</p>
<p>you know they ask you questions like</p>

<p>ten seconds into the</p>
<p>fight he goes for a double a takedown</p>
<p>i pull guillotine</p>
<p>block with my guard i&rsquo;m thinking in my head my</p>
<p>inner minor</p>
<p>model looks like</p>

<p>gonna choke him out like ten</p>

<p>stacks me rip pops out and i&rsquo;m screaming</p>
<p>oh what the fuck oh so like the rest of the</p>
<p>fight was just fucking ugly</p>
<p>ugly ugly ugly ugly ugly man</p>
<p>i was trying i got him locked down in like half garden</p>
<p>trying to pull old</p>
<p>school nothing&rsquo;s working cause</p>
<p>you know my course fucked</p>
<p>right so when it got to the strike your mind i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking you know this is just really</p>
<p>gonna suck cause i&rsquo;m an outside fighter</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna</p>
<p>stand in the pocket</p>
<p>even if you have good defense even if you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t move well</p>
<p>right and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to stay in the pocket with somebody even if you</p>
<p>turn out fucking whitaker you know</p>
<p>so of course i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>standing in the pocket i have no choice he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>throwing these punches</p>
<p>only one of the five was getting through</p>
<p>but the fifth one that gets through fucking killed man</p>
<p>and you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting all</p>
<p>glass eyed and</p>
<p>googly eyed and shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>everything and</p>
<p>i think i gotta do i can&rsquo;t sit i</p>
<p>gotta do something you know</p>
<p>cause like one everyone up</p>
<p>if i was getting through then</p>
<p>it was every other one</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>worse and worse and worse</p>
<p>so i just you know</p>
<p>threw off a four</p>
<p>punch combination</p>
<p>he took two steps back</p>
<p>blinked like i hit a fucking</p>
<p>reset button</p>
<p>and came right back at me and then i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking this is not good</p>
<p>before i can finish the thought this is not good</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking up and the rest</p>
<p>leading over me and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>counting and i hear like eight</p>
<p>and i get back up</p>
<p>again and you know i got drop like</p>
<p>three more times you got</p>
<p>wait a minute you guys had a</p>
<p>standing eight</p>
<p>count and mma yeah</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s dangerous yeah</p>
<p>so that is dangerous</p>
<p>standing accounts</p>
<p>allow you to recover and correct</p>
<p>beatings correct especially</p>
<p>good especially</p>
<p>yeah especially if you&rsquo;re in decent</p>
<p>shape you can recover</p>
<p>the fuck is with the</p>
<p>standing account what was with</p>
<p>getting dropped more than once</p>
<p>did you think</p>
<p>about tapping</p>
<p>no dude i mean you&rsquo;re crazy</p>

<p>stupid i have to admit</p>

<p>me a really good boxer</p>
<p>my training</p>
<p>my training for that</p>
<p>fight was easter</p>
<p>candy and porn and</p>
<p>you know we both</p>
<p>used to box a wild card boxing freddie wilcher&rsquo;s place</p>

<p>right like fuck</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a pretty boy actor this will be easy</p>
<p>first round i&rsquo;m trying to like</p>
<p>get angles on him and</p>
<p>stuff his footwork is just sick</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not afraid to</p>
<p>admit i couldn&rsquo;t fucking touch him</p>
<p>back in the end of the corner</p>
<p>back in the corner my eyes already fucking</p>
<p>swelling shut and</p>

<p>wait wait back up back up back up</p>
<p>so before the fight</p>
<p>before the fight even</p>
<p>starts he goes to my</p>
<p>dressing room and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah man i&rsquo;m hosting the latin</p>
<p>grammys tomorrow and you know it&rsquo;s gonna be a</p>
<p>great big red</p>
<p>carpet thing</p>
<p>three minutes before we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to fight i&rsquo;m like why why are you telling me this</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like oh i&rsquo;ll see you out there</p>
<p>sure enough he&rsquo;s got a fuck you know</p>
<p>those face masks like</p>
<p>catchers mitts</p>
<p>yeah one of</p>
<p>those one so</p>
<p>after the fight</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m watching</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m watching you know</p>
<p>access hollywood</p>
<p>whatever the fuck it is he&rsquo;s on the red carpet you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like yeah we fought last</p>
<p>night not a scratch on us and he&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>going this going like this over his face and</p>
<p>everything now</p>
<p>screaming at the tv you wore a fucking cage</p>
<p>fucking ridiculous</p>
<p>so he won those face</p>
<p>guards yeah yeah those</p>
<p>would you wear one if you had the option</p>
<p>nah i mean can&rsquo;t see out of those</p>
<p>exactly it&rsquo;s very hard to sing yes it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>false security i mean</p>
<p>when you get hit in the head your brain</p>
<p>still rattles around the</p>
<p>skull just to see</p>
<p>it does protect your nose though</p>
<p>yeah it protects your nose and you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>your ears no</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get fucked up you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still gonna get</p>
<p>knocked out</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s still easy to you can hurt a guy bad</p>
<p>with cosmetics</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s it keeps your nose from</p>
<p>exploding i was so</p>
<p>stoned watching that last usc i thought</p>
<p>randy&rsquo;s ears look like little baby fetuses like</p>
<p>like six months old they</p>
<p>do look like</p>
<p>they do look</p>
<p>like little</p>
<p>aliens yeah</p>
<p>how confident was chance when you interviewed him</p>
<p>james was very confident but i</p>
<p>think they all are until they</p>
<p>understand what a real grappler can do to you i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they know</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t get it or he was just</p>
<p>did he get in was afraid to</p>
<p>admit it or what i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he had good training</p>
<p>i know he did a little bit of work with king mo</p>
<p>and king mo</p>
<p>probably helped him</p>
<p>bit on his grappling</p>
<p>but i think the reality is moe was just</p>
<p>trying to help him and show him some techniques and</p>
<p>learn a little boxing from him i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think he was sparring and</p>
<p>going to war</p>
<p>with really good dudes that were trying to take him</p>
<p>down on a regular basis and that&rsquo;s what you got to do</p>
<p>and i watched the</p>
<p>countdown show</p>
<p>where they saw his</p>
<p>training and i was</p>
<p>watching him</p>
<p>roll and do techniques with</p>
<p>these dudes and</p>
<p>it felt like i was</p>
<p>watching a karate</p>
<p>demonstration</p>
<p>you know those old karate demonstrations</p>
<p>where someone</p>
<p>would do something he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>grab his arm and then go like this to god like ah</p>
<p>right no they</p>
<p>would act like</p>
<p>they were getting jacked and you were like this</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s kind of putting on a show for me here man yeah</p>
<p>first you do this then you do that kind of thing</p>
<p>yeah so it&rsquo;s like they were making</p>
<p>james look like he was this</p>
<p>badass grappler but i felt</p>
<p>like i was being lied to i felt like i was being hosed</p>
<p>and even if you were working with really good guys</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>randy fucking couture</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>elite grappler</p>
<p>if he gets a hold you he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fucking strangle you</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s ridiculously</p>
<p>strong in the clinch</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a grappling strength that unless you</p>
<p>have grappled for years and years you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>understand what kind of strength that is you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to get it</p>
<p>you might look like a really</p>
<p>powerful guy</p>
<p>and you might hit the bag really hard and</p>
<p>you might have good kicks and you</p>
<p>might even have a good sprawl</p>
<p>if rani kotor</p>
<p>gets hold of you he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna control you like you&rsquo;re a little girl</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just too strong</p>
<p>so good yes</p>
<p>especially a size me like little</p>
<p>smaller guys like fucking carl parisian</p>
<p>jesus christ gorilla</p>
<p>his whole life</p>
<p>throwing people doing judo his whole life</p>
<p>those guys you know</p>
<p>jimmy pedro was here working on the thing</p>
<p>did the cage in my garage</p>
<p>did you just fucking</p>
<p>shake that guy&rsquo;s hands is he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>olympic judo guy</p>
<p>his fucking hands are like</p>
<p>vice grips you know</p>
<p>his whole body is like this</p>
<p>taut thing he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>throwing goldberg around you know the</p>
<p>wrestler the big giant dude</p>
<p>in my garage</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>watched into tosser goldberg no that was goldberg</p>

<p>strong as fuck</p>
<p>that shit&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>yeah the ufc is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different animal</p>
<p>these boxing guys boxing is a beautiful</p>
<p>sport and i&rsquo;m a big</p>
<p>you know fan of manny pacquiao</p>
<p>floyd mayweather</p>
<p>especially i look forward</p>
<p>mayweather because he does it without getting hurt</p>
<p>he knows how to be just conservative enough just</p>
<p>aggressive enough</p>
<p>pick guys apart</p>
<p>and you know and if they open up like you know</p>
<p>ricky hatton he&rsquo;ll drop em</p>
<p>yeah fuck em up he&rsquo;ll stop em</p>
<p>yeah if all the</p>
<p>grief he gets for</p>
<p>being clinical</p>
<p>about his boxing i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s freaking brilliant he&rsquo;s a master yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a master you have to</p>
<p>appreciate it what he&rsquo;s doing is masterful</p>
<p>you know what he did with sugar</p>
<p>shane he got hit with one good</p>
<p>right hand that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>the fight against zab judah</p>
<p>jesus christ that was</p>
<p>genius yeah he&rsquo;s a master</p>
<p>he adapted like that yeah</p>
<p>he really is a boxing</p>
<p>genius you know</p>
<p>you know people like what</p>
<p>would happen if you fought an</p>
<p>mma he&rsquo;d get killed he&rsquo;d get</p>
<p>taken down he gets squashed</p>
<p>quickly by a dozen guys</p>
<p>a dozen guys</p>
<p>would kill him</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>mma you know he&rsquo;s doing a different</p>
<p>sport it&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>sport in and of itself</p>
<p>well i had another</p>
<p>motive to be</p>
<p>happy for tony to lose that fight</p>
<p>he actually</p>
<p>judged the fight</p>
<p>against me and</p>
<p>lopez and the</p>
<p>whole fucking</p>
<p>fight he was bagging on my shoes</p>
<p>gagging on my shoes</p>
<p>what did he say</p>
<p>how did you</p>
<p>understand him</p>
<p>was there subtitles</p>
<p>he would like grab the mic and shit it was like him</p>
<p>exactly exactly</p>
<p>yellow yeah what kind of shoes is this</p>
<p>what kind of shoes were they</p>
<p>they were faggot</p>
<p>shoes there was some old faggot shoes</p>
<p>so like yeah like in the second round i actually got a</p>
<p>clean shot on lopez and i dropped him</p>
<p>and i told him he&rsquo;s like oh he slipped he</p>
<p>slipped he slipped and</p>
<p>during the fight i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>god damn it motherfucker you know</p>
<p>james tony can talk some shit with us</p>
<p>i like james as a boxer he&rsquo;s one of the best man</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like trying to punch a</p>
<p>snake he was an artist as a boxer man</p>
<p>watch his fight if you want to</p>
<p>appreciate like real counter punching</p>
<p>watch his fight with iran barkley cause iron</p>
<p>barkley at the time was a you know he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker beating</p>
<p>tommy hearns he knocked out tommy hearns</p>
<p>serious strong</p>
<p>powerful fucking puncher but</p>
<p>james just hit him with the art</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just like if you watch that fight</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>fight if you really appreciate someone</p>
<p>like sticking to</p>
<p>their skill set and their game plan</p>
<p>in the heat of fire and overcoming someone with skill</p>
<p>stands right in</p>
<p>front of them</p>
<p>right in front of them</p>
<p>just fucking slip and shots</p>
<p>covering up slip and shots and blam</p>
<p>blam and those</p>
<p>clean shots just land more and more often till</p>
<p>towards the end of the</p>
<p>fight am iran</p>
<p>barker was just getting jack yeah he&rsquo;s afraid to</p>
<p>throw a punch</p>
<p>down afraid to</p>
<p>throw a punch</p>
<p>covering up like he&rsquo;s you know is hitting with you know</p>
<p>munitions are coming in and</p>
<p>james just landed</p>
<p>short sharp</p>
<p>punches on him that&rsquo;s artistic</p>
<p>i love watching</p>
<p>that better better with that than pretty</p>
<p>a whitaker was i</p>
<p>think yeah and you know what you only</p>
<p>get to see that in boxing you really can&rsquo;t do all that</p>
<p>stuff in mma</p>
<p>because while you&rsquo;re in the middle of it someone</p>
<p>will clinch or they&rsquo;ll try to take you down or they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>kick your legs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there is something to be said for just</p>
<p>watching boxing</p>
<p>because they achieve a</p>
<p>level with their hands that</p>
<p>you know is pretty remarkable</p>
<p>and you only</p>
<p>see it in boxing you don&rsquo;t really get to see it in mma</p>
<p>guys get you know they land a couple of good shots and</p>
<p>you know guys drop or you</p>
<p>know it gets</p>
<p>mixed up but you don&rsquo;t get to see like the real</p>
<p>calculated boxing matches</p>
<p>you get to see a little bit of</p>
<p>a little bit of a calculated</p>
<p>fighting in</p>
<p>jiu jitsu in</p>
<p>mma oh yeah</p>
<p>two top level</p>
<p>guys i mean you</p>
<p>still get to</p>
<p>see boxing too but you don&rsquo;t get to see it at the same</p>
<p>level and even</p>
<p>jiu jitsu you know</p>
<p>if you see two</p>
<p>mma guys doing</p>
<p>jiu jitsu together</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>the same as seeing them just do jujitsu not have to</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>strikes you know if you</p>
<p>watch like some guys</p>
<p>are brilliant when they don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>strikes but then when</p>
<p>dudes are punching them and kicking them and</p>
<p>changing yeah they can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on they can&rsquo;t grab a hold of techniques as</p>
<p>quickly and they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>submit anybody</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of the</p>
<p>guys like that that are killers killers in regular</p>
<p>but you had</p>
<p>strikes and they just can&rsquo;t finish people</p>
<p>but i still like</p>
<p>watching just straight jujutsu</p>
<p>i want to see just that aspect of it at a really high</p>
<p>level just same</p>
<p>thing with boxing</p>
<p>just that aspect of it at a really high</p>
<p>level is fascinating</p>
<p>but for someone to</p>
<p>think that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do one</p>
<p>thing like that and just jump</p>
<p>right into mma</p>
<p>especially boxing if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to do one</p>
<p>thing and jump into</p>
<p>mma it&rsquo;s gonna be wrestling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the those guys</p>
<p>those fucking ben askren characters those</p>
<p>those olympic</p>
<p>medalist guys</p>
<p>who can just come in and in the they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>strike at all</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>just get a hold of you drag you on the ground</p>
<p>punch you while you&rsquo;re down game is over just</p>
<p>close the distance yeah</p>
<p>so we got you into</p>
<p>training we got you in martial arts um</p>
<p>typical thing when you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>twelve years old you go to like a</p>
<p>karate a little karate</p>
<p>studio and like a</p>
<p>strip mall kind of thing and</p>
<p>after watching all the bruce lee</p>
<p>movies i figure you know i&rsquo;m gonna give this a shot and</p>
<p>you know be another bruce lee get my yellow</p>
<p>track suit my nunchucks and shit and</p>
<p>you know bruce lee man</p>
<p>so but how did you get from that to like boxing mario</p>
<p>lopez and fighting air and breaking a porno</p>
<p>like how does that happen</p>
<p>little choices you make</p>
<p>along the way dude you never know</p>
<p>where the fuck they lead you in life man yeah</p>

<p>on the front of a</p>
<p>plane like sitting in the middle</p>

<p>think are cool and how many of you think</p>
<p>most of them have something has happened to them</p>
<p>right you know</p>

<p>speak to what my personal</p>
<p>experience is right</p>
<p>ninety percent of the girls are cool</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the ten percent that the ten percent of anything</p>
<p>in any walk of life that</p>
<p>stands out and you</p>
<p>think oh you know like say some</p>
<p>black dude cut you off in traffic</p>
<p>all black guys are bad whatever you know it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing with our business</p>
<p>you know drugs aren&rsquo;t anywhere near as rampant</p>
<p>as you think it</p>
<p>would be i mean obviously it</p>
<p>exists you know but it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>i get the set and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m skiing down mountains of coke you know and then i</p>
<p>start my scene</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know yes it does exist</p>
<p>people with issues you know</p>
<p>exist in and out of porn and</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not as that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely true that&rsquo;s a very good</p>
<p>point we just said people with issues</p>
<p>exist in and out of porn</p>
<p>yeah and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah fuck yeah</p>
<p>comic show the beautiful</p>
<p>strippers are</p>
<p>porn stars for sure with</p>
<p>microphone the beautiful</p>
<p>thing is what you do you get up on</p>
<p>stage and you</p>
<p>you you have a cathartic</p>
<p>experience and</p>
<p>everyone else can relate to it and you know it helps</p>
<p>make everyone else feel better</p>
<p>about themselves</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s even if it&rsquo;s just one for fucking</p>
<p>for one fucking split</p>
<p>second that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a beautiful</p>
<p>thing you know so</p>
<p>and a twisted</p>
<p>fucked up kind of way i</p>
<p>guess the people in my business we do the same</p>
<p>thing also i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>twisted and fucked up as we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying before in the beginning of the show i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand the the</p>
<p>taboo of it</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that we&rsquo;re supposed to be ashamed of</p>
<p>just like this fucking</p>
<p>flashlight people are supposed to be ashamed of the</p>
<p>flashlight i&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>bunch of conversations with people who didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that it was a smart move</p>
<p>for me to have the</p>
<p>flashlight sponsor</p>
<p>the podcast</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like they were real conversations like</p>
<p>real intelligent people did</p>
<p>you did you</p>
<p>i want to know the</p>
<p>truth did you really just send them a couple of</p>
<p>flashlights and they were</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no i wish to</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;m curious probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t like get this out of my home</p>
<p>no i will not tolerate a rubber vagina in my home</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>weird about the fact that we&rsquo;re so weird</p>
<p>about sex that if you have sex</p>
<p>professionally</p>
<p>even though everybody loves sex dude it&rsquo;s a what</p>
<p>ten billion dollar industry i mean</p>
<p>huge industry</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s only a couple thousand people in the</p>
<p>that are actually</p>
<p>in the industry running the businesses</p>
<p>so i mean that</p>
<p>money isn&rsquo;t being consumed in</p>
<p>a vacuum obviously it&rsquo;s being consumed outside of the</p>
<p>microcosm of porn</p>
<p>yes you know so</p>
<p>let me ask you this ma&rsquo;am because this is curious to me</p>
<p>really fascinating to me</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>money coming from now with all the internet</p>
<p>is it harder to sell dvds now</p>
<p>it must be right</p>
<p>dvds now for the most part are lost leaders</p>
<p>for internet</p>
<p>basically and</p>
<p>how do they make</p>
<p>money off the internet the youtube</p>
<p>channels are what they&rsquo;re making now you know</p>
<p>like you porn like a lot of</p>
<p>these things like companies own like</p>
<p>streaming youtube</p>
<p>right thing</p>
<p>type stuff now and that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making but how are they making</p>
<p>money no one&rsquo;s paying for it that was actually</p>
<p>so many sites to</p>
<p>title the threat that</p>
<p>three thousand posts</p>
<p>on the underground</p>
<p>so how do people make</p>
<p>money in porn and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>is that the thread that</p>
<p>started you out writing yeah exactly oh</p>
<p>you know so how do they</p>
<p>nowadays it&rsquo;s increasingly more difficult i mean</p>
<p>without putting</p>
<p>exact figures on it</p>
<p>in the summer of nineteen ninety eight</p>
<p>i earned x amount of dollars</p>
<p>in the summer of two thousand ten i earned a fifth</p>
<p>of what i earned to nineteen ninety</p>
<p>eight wow i mean i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still making</p>
<p>living at it but fucking barely man i&rsquo;m looking at a</p>
<p>point where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s steadily</p>
<p>becoming diminishing</p>
<p>returns to whether or not it&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>worth doing this is supposed to</p>
<p>you know going back to cubicle or something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating because the internet</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crushed it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crushed that business more than any business</p>
<p>well the government isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna step in and intervene like they did with the</p>
<p>music industry in the mainstream film industry is this</p>
<p>funny there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>chinese there&rsquo;s a chinese</p>
<p>act max max</p>
<p>that when your</p>
<p>enemy is destroying itself</p>
<p>get out of the fucking way</p>
<p>yeah so why</p>
<p>would the government</p>
<p>intervene they&rsquo;ve been trying to you know</p>
<p>put the clamp down on porn forever so why</p>
<p>why if you if you wanted to control society</p>
<p>why would you want</p>
<p>them to not</p>
<p>watch porn they placated</p>
<p>i hear what you&rsquo;re saying but it but what is it is it</p>
<p>that they have to um</p>
<p>they have to respond to the</p>
<p>the wishes of</p>
<p>their constituents</p>
<p>is that what it is</p>
<p>yeah cause the</p>
<p>other the other</p>
<p>the other is that what it is yeah the</p>
<p>other control is religion</p>
<p>i mean for centuries religions</p>
<p>what do you where&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the business</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the pressure come from to</p>
<p>force you guys out</p>
<p>does it come from religious people does it come from</p>
<p>right wing political people what does it come from</p>
<p>not just that we have a lot of a lot of</p>
<p>activists on the left left wing side also that are</p>
<p>that are uh</p>
<p>wrapping themselves</p>
<p>under the guise of</p>
<p>humanitarian issues and you know</p>
<p>thinking that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>speaking for</p>
<p>for for the best</p>
<p>interest of the people that are trying the business</p>
<p>right that somehow know they</p>
<p>should get out of it right</p>
<p>right meanwhile they probably watch it</p>
<p>or benefit financially</p>
<p>one way or another from it so yeah</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very fascinating subject</p>
<p>because i remember when they talked</p>
<p>about the porn</p>
<p>bailout there was like</p>
<p>good like people like ask for a porn bailout</p>
<p>yeah and someone</p>
<p>and everybody</p>
<p>laughed it off</p>
<p>like it was just done for publicity ha ha ha</p>
<p>but if that was done</p>
<p>about the music business</p>
<p>which probably</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make as much</p>
<p>money as a porn business</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different because</p>
<p>musicians who makes more</p>
<p>money who makes more money</p>
<p>right but does the</p>
<p>music business</p>
<p>well porn star definitely</p>
<p>probably makes the most</p>
<p>does it make</p>
<p>more than music you</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think anymore</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>music is struggling too</p>
<p>music is like a lot of artists are making much more</p>
<p>money just doing</p>
<p>their tours now than they are from</p>
<p>their music</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing anybody that can win a</p>
<p>grammy like</p>
<p>musicians or comedians or whatever the</p>
<p>money is going to you</p>
<p>the money that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>generating the porn isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to the to the</p>
<p>to the performers the artist in porn is</p>
<p>going to it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to the companies</p>
<p>basically and it&rsquo;s disappearing into a vacuum of</p>
<p>of losses because you can&rsquo;t be free when people</p>
<p>are putting your product that you invest in money in</p>
<p>on the internet a couple of</p>
<p>months later</p>
<p>but i guess a simple way i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really not you really</p>
<p>should don&rsquo;t look at it as how much</p>
<p>money is being generated how much money is</p>
<p>going to the people that are making the product</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t it fascinating that talking</p>
<p>about that like trying to bail out that industry</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s obviously there&rsquo;s a demand there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>supply and there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>victims you talk</p>
<p>about bailing it out and everybody would go</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>it be shoveling</p>
<p>money into a bottomless well dude</p>
<p>you think yeah i know so there&rsquo;s no way to stop it the</p>
<p>business model</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t the business</p>
<p>model once the</p>
<p>the internet was the rubicon that you can across</p>
<p>and the ironic</p>
<p>thing is porn has been</p>
<p>has been the one source of</p>
<p>entertainment that&rsquo;s ushered in new</p>
<p>frontiers entertainment</p>
<p>taking movies from being in people&rsquo;s homes to you know</p>
<p>movie theaters being people&rsquo;s homes but the beta</p>
<p>to dvds to you know the</p>
<p>well it definitely pushed</p>
<p>technology right</p>
<p>absolutely that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>streaming technology</p>
<p>and the same</p>
<p>thing is kicking us in</p>
<p>kicking us in our asses</p>
<p>3d porn though</p>
<p>what about that</p>
<p>pussy farts 3d</p>
<p>yeah oh brian</p>
<p>no i mean i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a big thing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re already filming three d</p>
<p>porn nowadays</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like that has to be the next</p>
<p>thing like really good</p>
<p>three d legs</p>
<p>around you you&rsquo;re like oh my god i&rsquo;m in the middle of a</p>
<p>pussy right well as soon as</p>
<p>some sort of</p>
<p>virtual reality</p>
<p>technology as</p>
<p>soon as the</p>
<p>technology comes that that can be you know</p>
<p>disseminated</p>
<p>for free you</p>
<p>know that scott is</p>
<p>limited all</p>
<p>right here&rsquo;s an important question</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>about the max hardcore situation</p>
<p>now if you don&rsquo;t know what this is</p>
<p>max hardcore is one of the few guys in this country in</p>
<p>the last few</p>
<p>decades that has been prosecuted and convicted</p>
<p>for obscenity</p>
<p>for his videos</p>
<p>they violated some laws</p>
<p>his videos are fucked up</p>
<p>you know i at</p>
<p>first i was like this is an outrage</p>
<p>how are they doing this and then i</p>
<p>watch the guys</p>
<p>videos and i&rsquo;m like man</p>
<p>maybe that should be illegal</p>
<p>yeah but i mean</p>
<p>you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not got the guy who want to put him in jail but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t feel bad for him</p>
<p>once you once you</p>
<p>cross that line of love of</p>
<p>legislating</p>
<p>taste word is sure</p>
<p>oh yeah i mean someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be offended i&rsquo;m sure you know</p>
<p>so but as a</p>
<p>human being as a</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>watching it and seeing what he&rsquo;s doing it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all humiliation it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>crushing girls</p>
<p>self esteem</p>
<p>pissing in their mouths</p>
<p>forcing them to sing</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s pissing in</p>
<p>their mouth</p>
<p>yeah and i know that this is all a personal choice and</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think anybody has a gun to that girl&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>obviously she&rsquo;s making some</p>
<p>funky decisions consenting</p>
<p>adult but yeah she&rsquo;s a consenting</p>
<p>adult but dude</p>
<p>then why is that guy doing that</p>
<p>why is he because people</p>
<p>he opened up this</p>
<p>chick&rsquo;s asshole</p>
<p>okay and held it open with a vice</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>pliers or whatever the fuck it was</p>
<p>pissed inside her asshole</p>
<p>and then made the girl drink</p>
<p>the piss out of her asshole</p>
<p>out of her own asshole</p>
<p>this shit got paid for it</p>
<p>by the way that same girl probably does</p>
<p>it all the time to describe that i forget who</p>
<p>maybe some maybe sal in the howard stern show</p>
<p>but just i think that who exactly it was</p>
<p>thinking about that thinking</p>
<p>about someone doing that&rsquo;s like what the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with that guy</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with that guy why is he doing that</p>
<p>and how is he peeing with a heart on too</p>
<p>pissing a lot like he&rsquo;s fucking this girl in the</p>

<p>crazy but he can come up with</p>
<p>talent and shit</p>
<p>but the best</p>
<p>thing that he was ever in was that</p>
<p>south park episode</p>

<p>they went so deep and so hard that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>you like man</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s better than those guys</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nobody better than those guys</p>

<p>oh snap son</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter dude i love that youtube</p>
<p>video by the way of you when you were younger</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird crazy</p>
<p>weird i was 25</p>
<p>at rascal&rsquo;s</p>
<p>comedy hour</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>weird to watch me do</p>
<p>stand up back then had</p>
<p>nothing to say</p>
<p>about anything</p>
<p>what was your</p>
<p>what was your very</p>
<p>first show like</p>
<p>i mean what was like</p>
<p>getting home</p>
<p>it was like getting on</p>
<p>stage was terrifying</p>
<p>yeah terrifying i was amazed how scared i was</p>
<p>cause i had fought and</p>
<p>probably i maybe a hundred amateur taekwondo matches</p>
<p>i fought a lot of tournaments i fought sometimes</p>
<p>three four times in a day</p>
<p>in these these big</p>
<p>these big tournaments man they would</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people you had to</p>
<p>fight to get the</p>
<p>finals i fought a lot of dudes and it was</p>
<p>scary shit a lot a lot of guys got</p>
<p>knocked unconscious</p>
<p>a lot of guys</p>
<p>get kicked in the face a lot of guys got hurt</p>
<p>i was way more nervous for comedy</p>
<p>wait i was scared out of my mind</p>
<p>for fighting i was always like just</p>
<p>fight smart</p>
<p>keep your hands up make sure you keep moving don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do anything predictable don&rsquo;t be a hero don&rsquo;t get crazy</p>
<p>go out there do your</p>
<p>thing you know i</p>
<p>could rely on my skills</p>
<p>and i knew like if this guy was really good i</p>
<p>could stay on the outside i can move away</p>
<p>you know i could wait</p>
<p>until he slows down before i attack i had some options</p>
<p>but there was no options for me when i got on that</p>
<p>stage i have to be</p>
<p>funny like they have to</p>
<p>laugh at the</p>
<p>shit that i have to say you know what the difference is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fourth wall man it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>theater term like when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>stage and you&rsquo;re acting on stage</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>stage left stage</p>
<p>right and you know</p>
<p>upstage and downstage whatever</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s three walls</p>
<p>2020 theater</p>
<p>and what there isn&rsquo;t a wall is between</p>
<p>you and the audience and you have to put that wall up</p>
<p>and imagine there&rsquo;s something like maybe a</p>
<p>clock or a door or something</p>
<p>to seal the audience office</p>
<p>still be organic</p>
<p>and use the</p>
<p>whole space</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting somebody</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in that</p>
<p>tunnel visions</p>
<p>mode or whatever basically</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not interacting with the audience you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>focusing on one person</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forced to live and die</p>
<p>on how organic you can be with a person when you on</p>
<p>stage you know</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re storing</p>
<p>yourself for comedy so i have a lot of respect</p>
<p>matter of fact you know if you remember this but</p>
<p>like was like</p>
<p>back in like january i was all crying like a bitch</p>
<p>so i had to read in</p>
<p>front of like</p>
<p>thirty people</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m scared</p>
<p>and i sent you</p>
<p>a text my dude how the fuck do you do it man just do it</p>
<p>what were you scared of</p>
<p>i had i was reading</p>
<p>a couple of</p>
<p>short stories</p>
<p>in poetry at</p>
<p>a place in the</p>
<p>lower east side in new york and</p>
<p>yeah goes to</p>
<p>those poetry slams and picks up</p>
<p>smart chicks</p>
<p>oh like a poetry</p>
<p>poetry readings</p>
<p>well yeah oh wow so uh</p>
<p>yeah just i was reading his stories</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>you ever have like the mike myers guy come that goes</p>
<p>woman woman</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about no what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>you ever see that</p>
<p>movie i saw i</p>
<p>married an axe murder</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>like nineteen eighty nine</p>
<p>the movie doesn&rsquo;t hold up so you had some like really</p>
<p>powerful poetry</p>
<p>get you in tears</p>
<p>uh just shit</p>
<p>about real life dude oh that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>yeah yeah but he was worried</p>
<p>about doing it i was like you fuck in</p>
<p>front of people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool why was he</p>
<p>worried because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in a closed off environment it&rsquo;s a totally different</p>
<p>thing you know yeah</p>
<p>comedy is a</p>
<p>funny thing man it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funny thing to interact with people like that and</p>
<p>you know until</p>
<p>one person talks the</p>
<p>other person watches</p>
<p>very very strange thing</p>
<p>and the the</p>
<p>amount of hate that people have for you in the amount</p>
<p>of uncomfortable feeling in the air when it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still talking and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>annoying them</p>
<p>and your set&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not done it&rsquo;s not good and you got a lot of time to go</p>
<p>and you got no way to dig yourself out of this hole</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re you know</p>
<p>21 years old you really not</p>
<p>fucking shit to say</p>
<p>about anything</p>
<p>you really shouldn&rsquo;t even be on stage</p>
<p>yeah you know you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>going on there</p>
<p>to get attention try to figure out how to do it</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s expenses</p>
<p>bombing is the</p>
<p>worst feeling ever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>afraid to do it it&rsquo;s a very unsatisfying feeling</p>
<p>losing in front of people like losing a</p>
<p>fight is not nearly it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel as bad as bombing</p>
<p>why is that</p>
<p>hmm i think</p>
<p>my guess is is because when you&rsquo;re bombing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of you that you&rsquo;re putting out there</p>
<p>yeah well losing</p>
<p>is just your performance you know i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely you</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing if you lost like a</p>
<p>bitch like if</p>
<p>you you know you tapped out when you didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>right you know there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>disappointed in yourself like you</p>
<p>you fought you</p>
<p>let the guy have the triangle because you were scared</p>
<p>dudes have done</p>
<p>things like that or you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>tired don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>fight anymore yeah yeah yeah or yeah you</p>
<p>should have trained</p>
<p>your conditioning suck there&rsquo;s that kind of feeling</p>
<p>which is very</p>
<p>disappointing but</p>
<p>if you fight your ass off you</p>
<p>fight your heart out and you lose</p>
<p>this there&rsquo;s no loss</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you lose but</p>
<p>you fall with honor</p>
<p>you know you you</p>
<p>realize that you have to get better and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>learn from your mistakes well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>key i feel like</p>
<p>anybody hates you mistakes are fucking beautiful you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna</p>
<p>get better at anything</p>
<p>unless you make mistakes</p>
<p>jesus christ when i</p>
<p>started writing and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna laugh in here so i&rsquo;ve only been writing a year</p>
<p>which which is a joke because you</p>
<p>know there are</p>
<p>guys that are far better than me that have been writing</p>
<p>their entire lives or whatever</p>
<p>but uh yeah but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you have</p>
<p>to make mistakes in</p>
<p>order to get better time</p>
<p>is terrible time is not nearly</p>
<p>as important</p>
<p>time is important</p>
<p>but the most important</p>
<p>thing is talent</p>
<p>the most important thing</p>
<p>town is a strange</p>
<p>word because a lot of times people take it to mean that</p>
<p>it comes easy that you&rsquo;re born with it i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s a certain intelligence</p>
<p>that people have for different things</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>have a mathematical intelligence just inherit</p>
<p>they can just</p>
<p>count my friend johnny</p>
<p>i used to be able to</p>
<p>throw numbers at him used to</p>
<p>throw numbers at him and i</p>
<p>would do it in a</p>
<p>calculator and he</p>
<p>would be as fast as a</p>
<p>calculator he was just</p>
<p>he had a mind</p>
<p>for mathematics and he said he had always had it ever</p>
<p>since he was a</p>
<p>child wow yeah his father was a</p>
<p>musician there was some sort of a mathematical</p>
<p>thing in his in his lineage</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>but some people have it for different things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got it for writing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what it is it&rsquo;s just you</p>
<p>appreciate writing you</p>
<p>understand what you appreciate</p>
<p>about it you have ideas and thoughts</p>
<p>and you know how to get</p>
<p>those ideas and thoughts across it&rsquo;s a talent</p>
<p>you could fucking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like comedy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s dudes who do comedy for</p>
<p>fucking decades and they can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong they&rsquo;re not really</p>
<p>getting it they&rsquo;re not connecting with the audience</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>coming off organic organic they&rsquo;re not saying</p>
<p>things that people</p>
<p>want to hear they just can&rsquo;t do it they&rsquo;re trying hard</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re working at it they&rsquo;re just missing</p>
<p>comedic intelligence</p>
<p>a lot of what we do in common is we&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>storytellers</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re telling a</p>
<p>story and we&rsquo;re both connecting and relating to</p>
<p>other human beings and</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>underlying the underlying</p>
<p>thing is the</p>
<p>human condition whether you&rsquo;re whether you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>eskimo you know</p>
<p>looking at the borealis</p>
<p>and your wife just left you for</p>
<p>for the guy that club seals better than</p>
<p>you do or right or whether you&rsquo;re you know</p>
<p>running around</p>
<p>to the jungles of uganda or whatever you know</p>
<p>and your wife left you for a</p>
<p>guy that blows a fucking blow gum better</p>
<p>human pain suffering love joy all</p>
<p>these things they&rsquo;re universal</p>
<p>everybody it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>where you are we all feel</p>
<p>these things the better you can</p>
<p>articulate and relate</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>and way that another</p>
<p>human being can</p>
<p>understand it the better you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be you know that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about do you feel like doing</p>
<p>crazy shit like fighting</p>
<p>aaron brink and you know doing boxing matches and</p>
<p>all this wild shit that you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>has given you uh more of</p>
<p>an understanding</p>
<p>about the the really extreme</p>
<p>experiences of life and that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>things that makes you a good writer</p>
<p>yeah and that plus what you said earlier</p>
<p>about when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>twenty one year old kid and just</p>
<p>starting out i&rsquo;m almost forty</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m thirty it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>thirty nine a couple of</p>
<p>months had i</p>
<p>started writing when i was younger</p>
<p>it would have suck</p>
<p>cause i had nothing to fucking say</p>
<p>yeah no life</p>
<p>experience i don&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>known what it was like to have a</p>
<p>been with the</p>
<p>girl for a decade and have a relationship and badly and</p>
<p>or you know have someone i really</p>
<p>cared about i</p>
<p>think you would have</p>
<p>still been good</p>
<p>you know you just</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have had the same</p>
<p>things to say</p>
<p>about the you</p>
<p>still would have had</p>
<p>things to say</p>
<p>like you know like when i</p>
<p>first started doing comedy i</p>
<p>definitely wasn&rsquo;t very good</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have anything to say but</p>
<p>i got good at commenting</p>
<p>through doing that i get good at</p>
<p>understanding the</p>
<p>rhythm of it and the</p>
<p>yeah if you just</p>
<p>started earlier</p>
<p>you would have</p>
<p>still been you</p>
<p>man you&rsquo;re not giving yourself enough credit it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>been the same but like i have a lot of writing</p>
<p>on my blog i</p>
<p>started a blog i</p>
<p>think i started in 98 98 or 99</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been writing</p>
<p>fairly regularly</p>
<p>since then sometimes i&rsquo;ll go back and read my old shit</p>
<p>and read like how i got</p>
<p>started into writing</p>
<p>and see how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evolved and</p>
<p>grown and you</p>
<p>could see it man you see that</p>
<p>pollution it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there in the writing</p>
<p>yeah i purposely don&rsquo;t go back and re edit</p>
<p>the older stuff on my blog</p>
<p>would spin up for a year</p>
<p>which is yeah me</p>
<p>too i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cause exactly you</p>
<p>wanna go back and look and see how</p>
<p>far you progress sure it&rsquo;s a moment in time and people</p>
<p>say that to me</p>
<p>you know hey</p>
<p>i really enjoy</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>progress in your writing you see it grow and gain</p>
<p>confidence i want people to see that because</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want you to just see</p>
<p>me at my best i don&rsquo;t mind you seeing the flaws and the</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s not so good and</p>
<p>the typos and the</p>
<p>errors that i had from 1998 i don&rsquo;t need to go fix that</p>
<p>i wish it went back farther where it</p>
<p>would say i like legos and i like purple right</p>
<p>i found an old</p>
<p>comic book that i drew</p>
<p>when i was six years old</p>
<p>nice mom found it yeah i used to draw</p>
<p>comic books i used to make</p>
<p>my own comic book staple</p>
<p>them together and shit</p>
<p>zero fucking nuts man it&rsquo;s nuts</p>
<p>going back and looking at your life</p>
<p>very very fucking strange</p>
<p>very strange what was your comics</p>
<p>about mine was mostly robot</p>
<p>transformer type stuff</p>
<p>mine was all</p>
<p>monsters from</p>
<p>space really</p>
<p>we should do a joint</p>
<p>comic book sometime</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>should yeah we should</p>
<p>you like one page i</p>
<p>write the next</p>
<p>and neither one of us knows what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen exactly we</p>
<p>would just have to figure out who gets to end it who</p>
<p>gets to start</p>
<p>it that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>i would like i like the idea but i&rsquo;m too fucking lazy</p>
<p>to draw all</p>
<p>those characters out but that&rsquo;s hardly</p>
<p>draw anymore</p>
<p>once a week it has</p>
<p>to be something so even if it&rsquo;s you just some papers</p>
<p>going boom or something</p>
<p>like that my</p>
<p>daughter loves</p>
<p>to draw so i draw now more than i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>drawn in like years</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re constantly drawing</p>
<p>things i love it</p>
<p>yeah the best is when</p>
<p>restaurants you can draw in restaurants i always draw</p>
<p>like boobs and</p>
<p>stuff and then when the waitress comes i put the</p>
<p>bread on and so she can&rsquo;t see it and then when i</p>
<p>leave i take the</p>
<p>bread off and then oh</p>
<p>well they have</p>
<p>those little menus for kids with the crayons they</p>
<p>bring on sometimes too and it</p>
<p>draws tits on them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s boobs everywhere for me</p>
<p>yeah you would love piranha</p>
<p>3d really you</p>
<p>would love it coming</p>
<p>right at you</p>
<p>you just wanna see</p>
<p>tits the only</p>
<p>problem i have with is the preview was one of those</p>
<p>movies i was like that looks like the</p>
<p>worst movie i&rsquo;ve ever seen it wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>worst movie i like</p>
<p>the original</p>
<p>it was not the</p>
<p>worst movie ever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what it is is</p>
<p>a dumb movie that knows it&rsquo;s a dumb</p>
<p>movie that&rsquo;s good so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for what it is</p>
<p>and the chicks are high</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of special effects</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not bad</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun let</p>

<p>guess it takes</p>
<p>place during spring</p>

<p>deprivation shit</p>
<p>yeah what the fuck</p>
<p>sleep dep no</p>
<p>sleep deprivation</p>
<p>sensor sensor</p>
<p>see a sensor deprivation yeah jesus</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the shit man you wanna you</p>
<p>wanna to explore</p>
<p>your mind you</p>
<p>wanna get really creative</p>
<p>no you cause you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>writer scares me dude why it</p>
<p>scares me the shit</p>
<p>the shit the</p>
<p>shit that&rsquo;s filtered</p>
<p>behind the dam</p>
<p>right now i&rsquo;m fucking afraid</p>
<p>you gotta get</p>
<p>in there and look around son i need to make a</p>
<p>sequel to dark crystal</p>
<p>no but she needs</p>
<p>to get an isolation tank you need to do it man</p>
<p>for your writing it&rsquo;ll be huge trust me</p>
<p>where do you live</p>
<p>hollywood hollywood</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a place</p>
<p>in burbank you can go to called soothing solutions</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>place you&rsquo;re serious</p>
<p>oh fuck yeah i got one in my basement</p>
<p>yeah i just that&rsquo;s my move</p>
<p>i just used the</p>
<p>closet the the sensory deprivation</p>
<p>chamber has been the most important tool that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve ever used for for mine for developing my mind for</p>
<p>thinking for</p>
<p>evolving so i&rsquo;m not gonna like</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m like a half a path are you</p>
<p>probably would</p>
<p>do that too</p>
<p>because they also</p>
<p>should no you</p>
<p>definitely have you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never come back</p>
<p>definitely have</p>
<p>crazy psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences in there</p>
<p>definitely but it is also it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>powerful fear form of</p>
<p>of looking at yourself like</p>
<p>introspective thinking</p>
<p>now you lose it when this is</p>
<p>going on your sort</p>
<p>yeah sometimes</p>
<p>you go in and out</p>
<p>you go lose it and then you know</p>
<p>like you it depends on how much you can let yourself go</p>
<p>the whole thing</p>
<p>about the isolation tank is</p>
<p>the tank is filled with</p>
<p>water the water is heated</p>
<p>to the same temperature as your body and there&rsquo;s 800</p>
<p>pounds of salt in the</p>
<p>water so the</p>
<p>suspension is</p>
<p>yeah you float</p>
<p>and so you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about sinking and drowning</p>
<p>so you just</p>
<p>float there and</p>
<p>relax and because the</p>
<p>water is the</p>
<p>temperature of your body you don&rsquo;t really feel it</p>
<p>after a while once you settle in</p>
<p>in this total darkness because the</p>
<p>thing is closed off sealed</p>
<p>total silence you don&rsquo;t hear anything your ears are</p>
<p>underwater and how long does it take for this to</p>
<p>start working on</p>
<p>see that&rsquo;s the important</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>much you let go and how comfortable you are with the</p>
<p>experience because there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>control and your feeling of trying to control</p>
<p>things in your body and in your mind it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>layers of an onion</p>
<p>and when you first</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>the isolation tank you can only get a couple</p>
<p>layers of the onion in</p>
<p>a couple skins loose</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>go to the core it&rsquo;s too hard it&rsquo;s too hard</p>
<p>to completely let go who you are</p>
<p>but as you get better</p>
<p>at it and as you get more and more comfortable with the</p>
<p>experience you get better at</p>
<p>actually letting go really letting go letting go from</p>
<p>letting go letting go from the feeling of letting go</p>
<p>letting go from that point okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve let go no you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t let go more</p>
<p>go more like</p>
<p>little more</p>
<p>and then yeah and then you become</p>
<p>gone you disappear and then</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>disappearing have you been fuck yeah</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re disappearing this is this what happens you</p>
<p>start thinking i can&rsquo;t believe i&rsquo;m disappearing</p>
<p>fuck then you&rsquo;re back</p>
<p>again you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>start from square one</p>
<p>you gotta let go and you</p>
<p>gotta let go and you</p>
<p>gotta let go and you</p>
<p>gotta get to the</p>
<p>point where you</p>
<p>literally completely</p>
<p>relax and your body</p>
<p>gives you amazing energy</p>
<p>your body the tension release</p>
<p>that you have in your body from a couple</p>
<p>hours in the tank is incredible you feel lighter</p>
<p>you feel like</p>
<p>more oxygen is in your body you feel like more vibrant</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve somehow another calmed the tension</p>
<p>now what&rsquo;s the longest you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been one of</p>
<p>those tanks couple</p>
<p>hours whose fucking phone is near the</p>
<p>not mine shit is</p>
<p>shut your shit up bro</p>
<p>mine&rsquo;s off is it</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking fascinating it&rsquo;s fucking incredible man you</p>
<p>would love it</p>
<p>you would love it you need to do it you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>thinker i&rsquo;m down</p>
<p>for it i&rsquo;m down for it dude</p>
<p>what it does is</p>
<p>the first twenty minutes or so for me at least</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like sort of a seminar in my life</p>
<p>it shows me all the different issues in</p>
<p>my life that i don&rsquo;t like and then it need to fix and</p>
<p>things that are bothering me</p>
<p>things about my own behavior that it</p>
<p>could have been better and</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m disappointed in myself and then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll show me some</p>
<p>things where i&rsquo;m on the</p>
<p>right track</p>
<p>this is good continue here continue doing this continue</p>
<p>thinking like this continue exploring</p>
<p>these ideas</p>
<p>but then once it gets me done</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clear out all this bullshit in your life</p>
<p>then let&rsquo;s think</p>
<p>about the big</p>
<p>picture and then it goes from that to</p>
<p>this sort of relaxing</p>
<p>position where</p>
<p>my whole body is just settled into the</p>
<p>experience and then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just pure thought it&rsquo;s like the mind</p>
<p>completely untethered from the body</p>
<p>and then i start contemplating</p>
<p>everything i</p>
<p>start contemplating the universe and contemplating</p>
<p>the role of</p>
<p>human beings in each</p>
<p>individual&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actions all accumulating together to one specific event</p>
<p>i start thinking all kinds of</p>
<p>crazy crazy shit</p>
<p>but without the body in the way</p>
<p>right without</p>
<p>even us having</p>
<p>this cool conversation here we&rsquo;re sitting here on a</p>
<p>couch we&rsquo;re looking at each</p>
<p>other we&rsquo;re looking at computers and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sounds and noises and there&rsquo;s a lot of distractions</p>
<p>you know just your body is a distraction</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>self aware the fact that we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>yeah man the tank i recommended to so</p>
<p>many people and so few people take me up on it i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>man you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re missing you got some</p>
<p>crazy fucking environment that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist anywhere else in the world</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fairly inexpensive to achieve</p>
<p>if the tank was something</p>
<p>where it was a machine</p>
<p>and you would have to</p>
<p>strap yourself in</p>
<p>and they would take you through a course</p>
<p>where you would</p>
<p>learn how to get to the center of consciousness</p>
<p>where your body and your mind didn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>it would be like a ride on disneyland and the line</p>
<p>would be seven hours long</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>weird sort of</p>
<p>organic method of doing it it seems strange</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get in this big coffin filled with</p>
<p>water and you</p>
<p>close the lid i get claustrophobic</p>
<p>and people start</p>
<p>coming up with reasons why they don&rsquo;t want to do it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so important everybody</p>
<p>should do the tank</p>
<p>you will learn more</p>
<p>about yourself than any other way</p>
<p>and if you have an aversion</p>
<p>to drugs which totally makes</p>
<p>sense if you</p>
<p>think that like</p>
<p>drugs are dangerous you get addicted to</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s true you can if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust yourself you don&rsquo;t like the idea</p>
<p>you can have very</p>
<p>introspective</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>naturally in the tank</p>
<p>everybody should be doing it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking amazing way to</p>
<p>think and this assault your</p>
<p>creativity a lot fuck yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s responsible for ninety percent of my thoughts fuck</p>
<p>i my all my</p>
<p>evolution the</p>
<p>evolution of all my thoughts almost always takes</p>
<p>place in the tank because</p>
<p>when i have an idea</p>
<p>or i have a concept or something that i&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>two things i&rsquo;ll do one</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll sit down i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>flesh it out</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll write what i</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>things just kind of off the top of my head</p>
<p>and then once i&rsquo;ve done that once i&rsquo;ve really kind</p>
<p>of exported then i get in the tank and i rethink the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>and then when i rethink the</p>
<p>whole thing sometimes in the tank i consider</p>
<p>other places</p>
<p>where other</p>
<p>points of view i consider</p>
<p>other ways of looking at it</p>
<p>where i may not have been as sensitive to</p>
<p>another person&rsquo;s opinion coming from another position</p>
<p>and i look at the</p>
<p>whole thing almost like outside of myself</p>
<p>without your</p>
<p>real life issues getting in the way and</p>
<p>yeah and look at it how</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>would see it</p>
<p>look at my thoughts and my ideas and my behavior</p>
<p>as other people</p>
<p>would see it</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re biased or unbiased</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re seeing it</p>
<p>for what it really is</p>
<p>or that they&rsquo;re seeing it for what they</p>
<p>would like it to be because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>upset of themselves</p>
<p>and how all that can be</p>
<p>manipulated</p>
<p>and adjusted and</p>
<p>you can get to a</p>
<p>point where you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>annoying people with your thoughts nearly as much</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>thinking that goes on in that tank there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>evolution that goes on in there that it seems</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s almost impossible to do outside of there</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no distractions in there nothing at all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the thought it&rsquo;s an amazing environment</p>
<p>it really should be</p>
<p>taught in schools</p>
<p>all university</p>
<p>should have them they</p>
<p>should have them and they</p>
<p>should make them</p>
<p>available to all of</p>
<p>their students one of the</p>
<p>greatest tools ever for</p>
<p>exploring thinking exploring the way you think</p>
<p>and sort of making an</p>
<p>audit of all your own personal thoughts and ideas and</p>
<p>which ones are you hanging on to because of your ego</p>
<p>which ones are you hanging on to because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>beneficial to you</p>
<p>which ones are</p>
<p>you hanging on to because you hate your dad</p>
<p>and he put these in your head and so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stuck in there</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s so fascinating man it&rsquo;s so few people do it</p>
<p>i hate to rant on this anymore than i already do</p>
<p>but i just i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it i keep talking</p>
<p>about it and people don&rsquo;t do it i&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crazy so think</p>
<p>a lot of it</p>
<p>yeah well i</p>
<p>think a lot of it is probably</p>
<p>price and i&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of</p>
<p>forty bucks bro how much do people</p>
<p>spend going on the weekend</p>
<p>cheaper than therapy man</p>
<p>yeah forty bucks but that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>i would say in</p>
<p>california a lot of people</p>
<p>spend forty</p>
<p>bucks on massages and doing</p>
<p>things like that but when you&rsquo;re in ohio</p>
<p>forty bucks is like damn it&rsquo;s either</p>
<p>i buy a bag of weed this week or i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>water you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>float every week</p>
<p>dude i i tell you man the</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experience of</p>
<p>floating is is more intense than weed</p>
<p>do you like hallucinations</p>
<p>yes yes yes some</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>though i&rsquo;ve been reading i&rsquo;ve been read like</p>
<p>doing a lot of following</p>
<p>since we talked</p>
<p>about a lot and then i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been a lot of people to say you know like i&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>three times nothing&rsquo;s ever happened and</p>
<p>i have names for</p>
<p>those people yeah</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>those people are they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dummies dummies</p>
<p>this is or this</p>
<p>is the deal shitty</p>
<p>places that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>water there is not right but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even i shouldn&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dummies what i</p>
<p>should say is people are impatient they want</p>
<p>things to happen right away</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a difficult</p>
<p>state of mind that you have to put yourself</p>
<p>into to really connect with the universe in one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>and you have to</p>
<p>learn how to let</p>
<p>everything go and there&rsquo;s some people that cannot let</p>
<p>things go because</p>
<p>their view of the</p>
<p>world is very distorted and they have to</p>
<p>protect that view and they lie to themselves every day</p>
<p>to protect that view</p>
<p>and then when you&rsquo;re in the tank and</p>
<p>these thoughts just come</p>
<p>right to the surface</p>
<p>people battle with them and so they have arguments in</p>
<p>their mind about</p>
<p>these thoughts and ideas</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s an uncomfortable</p>
<p>experience and they</p>
<p>never let go so they</p>
<p>never go they&rsquo;re not comfortable with themselves enough</p>
<p>to actually look themselves</p>
<p>they have to be able to look at themselves</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t do that you can&rsquo;t get in the tank</p>
<p>but if you can</p>
<p>you just gotta</p>
<p>learn how to slowly</p>
<p>relax that&rsquo;s all it is you gotta</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>relax and let go</p>
<p>and once you do once you do it for a</p>
<p>bunch of times</p>
<p>and you get</p>
<p>really good at it you become like a master traveler</p>
<p>you become a person like i&rsquo;ve done it so many times now</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve had them for so many years</p>
<p>that all i have</p>
<p>to do is if i take a couple weeks off though i struggle</p>
<p>i struggle and i have to have introductory periods</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m getting back to the</p>
<p>state of mind</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll take a little bit</p>
<p>but once i do it</p>
<p>three or four days in a row or</p>
<p>four times in a week or so</p>
<p>you know then it really</p>
<p>starts to kick in see that was my next question is</p>
<p>it i was thinking i was</p>
<p>gonna ask you if it was</p>
<p>a situation</p>
<p>where you do it enough and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need the tank and you can just get tested a mile</p>
<p>by yourself</p>
<p>i mean you can get somewhere you can put like a wet</p>
<p>sheet on you and no i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>diving into the mind it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about diving into the mind and</p>
<p>avoiding all the distractions i mean that&rsquo;s what all</p>
<p>meditation is</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>about sort of exploring</p>
<p>the inner sanctum of your consciousness without</p>
<p>outside influences without</p>
<p>thinking about all the</p>
<p>things that are</p>
<p>around you in your environment just concentrating on</p>
<p>the thought like a lot of people do it with breathing</p>
<p>you can achieve some pretty intense</p>
<p>states of mind like</p>
<p>buddhist monks</p>
<p>meditation but you can get</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>where it takes</p>
<p>them hundreds of years or whatever the fuck it takes</p>
<p>to you know sitting in them</p>
<p>you know a monastery with</p>
<p>robes on with your fucking head shaved you can get</p>
<p>right there in a tank in like a week</p>
<p>you know like you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t have to do all that</p>
<p>crazy go to the mountain top shit</p>
<p>the tanks way nuttier</p>
<p>if you ever</p>
<p>heard of like</p>
<p>audio chirping</p>
<p>where you start chirping by listening to different</p>
<p>audio you know i</p>
<p>tried it out once</p>
<p>and it does i did get really relaxed i</p>
<p>never went to</p>
<p>you know all</p>
<p>the way or anything like that but there&rsquo;s people that</p>
<p>that believe in that shit</p>
<p>will totally make sense of</p>
<p>music affects your mood absolutely</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a vibration in a good song like gives you like a</p>
<p>crazy charge it&rsquo;s like weird</p>
<p>sounds though</p>
<p>some songs make you cry man you know</p>
<p>you know some songs</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re younger</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny how you look</p>
<p>back at songs that you thought were fucking incredible</p>
<p>back then yeah</p>
<p>today you just like</p>

<p>maybe 30 40 hits a day</p>
<p>until of all people</p>
<p>fucking tucker max came across my blog and he</p>
<p>started a writing thread on his</p>
<p>form for me</p>

<p>from you know taking me taking me aside and you know</p>
<p>telling me that i</p>
<p>should pursue and actually</p>
<p>have something and he had nothing to gain whatsoever so</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t happen that</p>
<p>often in this</p>
<p>world you know</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t so</p>
<p>yeah it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>where people have</p>

<p>so i respect that</p>

<p>the fuck out of me when i lived in boston</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a grown man in</p>
<p>the lyrics of depressing me this song is</p>
<p>to me this is when i was like 14 15 years old</p>
<p>convinced that i was gonna be a loser</p>
<p>sitting in my fucking bedroom</p>
<p>snowing outside nothing to do</p>
<p>not knowing what the fuck my life is all about</p>
<p>sucking at school</p>
<p>hating every second of it</p>
<p>seeing all these idiots around me what year was this</p>
<p>me for me the song was a long lot</p>
<p>earlier than that but for me</p>
<p>this represents like nineteen eighty one to me</p>
<p>this is why i used to cry listen this shit</p>
<p>in the closet please</p>

<p>like the way you singing this it&rsquo;s not as good as the</p>

<p>hear that crowd going nuts</p>
<p>man what a rush that must be huh</p>
<p>what he knows he&rsquo;s got a badass</p>
<p>lyric like that captain jack will get you high tonight</p>
<p>take you to your special island and the</p>
<p>place goes fucking bananas</p>
<p>just rewind back to where he says that</p>

<p>flash will not allow you to do that joe what</p>
<p>does flash suck that bad of course it does</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s killing me here kill it</p>
<p>yeah when he was younger there was like a purity to his</p>
<p>voice there</p>
<p>was like a purity to his intent when he was saying</p>
<p>these things like you really believed it</p>
<p>then that like as he got</p>
<p>older it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s singing it</p>
<p>probably like the</p>
<p>tenth song in his set too</p>
<p>well yeah and then</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>sang that song</p>
<p>a fucking hundred million times and loses meaning</p>
<p>after a while</p>
<p>but man when he was</p>
<p>young that shit was deep</p>
<p>fuck it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first time i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>heard it and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been that guy you know that he&rsquo;s singing</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>the same fourteen year old kid you were</p>
<p>i mean we can all relate</p>
<p>to that shit that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a good song you know</p>
<p>how much depression is</p>
<p>there in the porn business there&rsquo;s a lot of depression</p>
<p>going on that business huh</p>
<p>yeah you know the</p>
<p>funny thing it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people deal with it in different ways man i mean</p>
<p>people deal with it in different ways i happen to be an</p>
<p>introvert so i go into my little</p>
<p>world and i sit behind my</p>
<p>stupid little keyboard and i vent</p>
<p>and i that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>therapeutic to me you know so</p>
<p>but yeah i mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a situation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>your career and even if you&rsquo;re the best in the fucking</p>
<p>world at your career</p>
<p>the best in the</p>
<p>world you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>less regarded</p>
<p>than a guy that picks up the garbage on tuesdays</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah people must</p>
<p>like wives want to</p>
<p>avoid you they don&rsquo;t want you around the house</p>
<p>yeah and you have to be</p>
<p>you have to like temper conversations</p>
<p>about people less than</p>
<p>i mean it goes back to mass loss hierarchy of</p>
<p>needs i mean you need to feel like you&rsquo;re accepted and</p>
<p>loved by other people i mean i don&rsquo;t care how much of a</p>
<p>loner how much of badass you</p>
<p>think you are</p>
<p>acceptance is one of the</p>
<p>pivotal key</p>
<p>things that makes us human</p>
<p>right and when you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be accepted for who you are what you do you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>tough man that</p>
<p>alone even if it wasn&rsquo;t you know chugging cock or</p>
<p>slinging cock or whatever</p>
<p>even if you were</p>
<p>a food taster and you know food tasting was somehow</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>a taboo profession whatever it is you know</p>
<p>so i mean i</p>
<p>meter maids man</p>
<p>meter maids get depressed as</p>
<p>fuck oh my god</p>
<p>hate on you all</p>
<p>that case in</p>
<p>point they probably get</p>
<p>attacked all the fucking time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>thing man i will</p>
<p>never understand i mean i do</p>
<p>understand obviously</p>
<p>you know people are embarrassed and people want</p>
<p>to project morals on our society and they</p>
<p>wanna adhere to a certain</p>
<p>standard of behavior and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the girls</p>
<p>should be out there wild and fucking in the streets</p>
<p>i understand why</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to not promote that like they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>their daughters getting involved in this they want</p>
<p>these cd people involved</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand all the hate i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never understood all the hate</p>
<p>uh could be coming from a</p>
<p>place from within</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not comfortable with themselves in some areas</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re repressed</p>
<p>which should be amazed how many</p>
<p>people actually repressed and they and they take the</p>
<p>exact opposite of uh</p>
<p>like being outwardly</p>
<p>aggressive about and</p>
<p>everything i mean you see this all the time when</p>
<p>you know form so like you know you post all the</p>
<p>time you see people that are seriously regressing this</p>
<p>repressed and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aggressive against</p>
<p>other people they&rsquo;re doing what they wish they</p>
<p>could be doing or whatever</p>

<p>i talked about this before so</p>

<p>who was on a date</p>
<p>and she did</p>
<p>not tell the date that she was a porn star oh shit</p>
<p>and so she brings the date to the</p>
<p>screening and this is outdoor in this</p>

<p>worry about makeup</p>
<p>well you know like nowadays like tv actors are all</p>
<p>freaked out because</p>
<p>they have to have like better makeup and it&rsquo;s close to</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t look perfect god damn it</p>
<p>yeah yeah so the real</p>
<p>problem is with actresses</p>
<p>i think with a lot of</p>
<p>makeup on they look great</p>
<p>and you know a non hd but then you see an hd you like</p>
<p>this fucking makeup this</p>
<p>bitch has gone on what the fuck do you really look like</p>
<p>the mirror of</p>
<p>truth man that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m glad i&rsquo;m at dude the pressure</p>
<p>to oh no look a certain way so much easier</p>
<p>so much easier for a dude all dude as dudes be</p>
<p>successful that&rsquo;s the biggest</p>
<p>after you say</p>
<p>in the world man</p>
<p>yeah for chick man what a</p>
<p>grind man trying to keep up being sexually</p>
<p>attractive forever</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s nothing sadder than old hookers</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing sadder than like some old</p>
<p>chick that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still trying</p>
<p>to get guys to be sexually into her it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>she never made the</p>
<p>transition to the next</p>
<p>stage of life she never</p>
<p>figured out a way to develop</p>
<p>a personality</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so funny you said that there&rsquo;s a book i just read</p>
<p>for like the</p>
<p>fifth time it&rsquo;s called last exit to brooklyn</p>
<p>by hubert selby jr he</p>
<p>wrote a record</p>
<p>for a dream</p>
<p>he wrote that okay</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a series of</p>
<p>short stories one of the</p>
<p>short stories is</p>
<p>about a hooker</p>
<p>who was really beautiful during like</p>
<p>world war two in brooklyn</p>
<p>and she was you know servicing</p>
<p>sailors and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>and instead of taking her</p>
<p>money and getting out she stayed</p>
<p>and like this is in the 70s now or whatever 60s 70s</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s still hooking</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>fifth of the</p>
<p>woman she used to be and it&rsquo;s really fucking trust now</p>
<p>oh this it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fiction but she was like well</p>
<p>in like her fifties or whatever and</p>
<p>still hooking in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing for women because they go from being not just</p>
<p>attractive but</p>
<p>magnetic yeah</p>
<p>where men will do anything for them and</p>
<p>stumbling over them</p>
<p>they go from that to eventually being a monster</p>
<p>being something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely unattractive</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re repulsive</p>
<p>and they go to</p>
<p>touch a man he&rsquo;s like shrieks can you imagine</p>
<p>think about this okay</p>
<p>can you imagine if you know you have your you have your</p>
<p>success you have your fan base now</p>
<p>can you imagine if your</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re talent as a comedian</p>
<p>was something that deteriorated over time</p>
<p>while she was</p>
<p>there for women</p>
<p>and how would that affect you psychologically you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>crushed you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>crushed it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>more of them don&rsquo;t jump off bridges that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>you go right to baby</p>
<p>yeah well for</p>
<p>women then it becomes a different</p>
<p>state of consciousness as it becomes taking care of the</p>
<p>babies and being the mom and</p>
<p>focuses off yeah i</p>
<p>never understood that</p>
<p>until i saw it happen</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like oh so it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just the next level</p>
<p>of understanding it&rsquo;s the next</p>
<p>level of thinking you just you become one with this new</p>
<p>phase of who you are now</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s look at the very beginning when</p>
<p>the other side of that when did you realize that you</p>
<p>a had something with your comedy</p>
<p>and b when did you realize what</p>
<p>was it that you made you realize when you made it that</p>
<p>you made it as far as your</p>
<p>skill level and you know you&rsquo;re accepted for as far as</p>
<p>knowing what</p>
<p>be when i could do it</p>
<p>knowing when i had something with comedy</p>
<p>that shit took years there was even when i</p>
<p>would have good sets like many many years and i</p>
<p>still felt like a</p>
<p>fraud you know</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;d see somebody</p>
<p>who was really good and i was like fuck you know</p>
<p>and i grew up in boston</p>
<p>which had a</p>
<p>tremendous amount</p>
<p>of really good</p>
<p>strong headliners</p>
<p>that really kind of stayed in the area and</p>
<p>never left they were</p>
<p>just as good as any</p>
<p>mainstream big name national acts like</p>
<p>these guys like don gavin and</p>
<p>steve sweeney and</p>
<p>kenny rogerson</p>
<p>they were like top flight comedians like all over the</p>
<p>world and so i was always comparing myself</p>
<p>to them and i was like i fucking suck you know come</p>
<p>on doing here</p>
<p>you know yeah i&rsquo;m getting some</p>
<p>laughs and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing okay i&rsquo;ve been doing comedy for two years now but</p>
<p>the reality is i suck</p>
<p>i suck compared</p>
<p>to them so it took years and years and years and years</p>
<p>till i felt like i was like a real</p>
<p>comic it took like ten years</p>
<p>takes a long ass time it&rsquo;s the 10 000 hour</p>
<p>thing that we were talking</p>
<p>about earlier yeah</p>
<p>you know you really have to do something and</p>
<p>by no means was i any</p>
<p>expert at comedy</p>
<p>at 10 years in i just</p>
<p>understood how to do it better</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to be objective with yourself also i mean</p>
<p>you need a little bit of detachment to be able to yeah</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t my best in like my</p>
<p>first cd was i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be dead someday</p>
<p>which i did in 1999</p>
<p>i listen to the delivery</p>
<p>right now and i go</p>
<p>delivery is like forced and i</p>
<p>think i was a little too</p>
<p>excited i got too loud and too many</p>
<p>places and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the delivery is as</p>
<p>smooth as i</p>
<p>would have done it</p>
<p>today but the material is good stuff</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like good funny</p>
<p>silly shit and you</p>
<p>know for me</p>
<p>it was my best</p>
<p>thing that i had ever done up</p>
<p>until then it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>so i had 10 years of comedy and then boom i put out my</p>
<p>first cd was that a turning</p>
<p>point where you realized that</p>
<p>everything started</p>
<p>clicking for you</p>
<p>no not really</p>
<p>cause i was already on newsradio when i did</p>
<p>that i had already been on newsradio for five years the</p>
<p>tv show yeah</p>
<p>sorry it had the tv show</p>
<p>as a comic it was the</p>
<p>first time that i really put comedy together</p>
<p>when i got on the tv show man i got real lazy for a</p>
<p>while i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write any jokes for</p>
<p>fucking years barely performed</p>
<p>and i would perform</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t be into it as much because i&rsquo;d be working on</p>
<p>the set all day and i got lazy and i got a part of that</p>
<p>but then somewhere in</p>
<p>i kind of had</p>
<p>a couple bad sets and one time i had a couple bad sets</p>
<p>where some of the writers from newsradio came to see me</p>
<p>i had one bad set in</p>
<p>front of them and i was like</p>
<p>all right i</p>
<p>should not be having</p>
<p>these bad sets like this i&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>these bad sets because i&rsquo;m fucking lazy</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not writing anything and i&rsquo;m not being enthusiastic</p>
<p>about it now i&rsquo;m embarrassing</p>
<p>myself people come to see me and i&rsquo;m not funny</p>
<p>so i felt bad</p>
<p>about that and then i really geared up</p>
<p>after that and started</p>
<p>spending a lot more time working on my set</p>
<p>you know like they say losses help a</p>
<p>fighter bombing helps a comedian for sure and you you</p>
<p>learn a lot</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re doing wrong</p>
<p>you learn a lot</p>
<p>about like how people</p>
<p>reacting to you the</p>
<p>wrong way and that you</p>
<p>never want it to happen again so</p>
<p>so that that that that woke me up and then within like</p>
<p>two years i did the cd</p>
<p>you know so that was the</p>
<p>first time i</p>
<p>was ever like okay i&rsquo;m like a real comedian now</p>
<p>like i really have</p>
<p>a cd on warner brothers like this is like real shit</p>
<p>right but i</p>
<p>still didn&rsquo;t feel like i know what i was doing it</p>
<p>was always like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always a struggle to this day being</p>
<p>22 years into it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still to this day</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re on a surfboard you better fucking balance</p>
<p>bitch cause if</p>
<p>you think you could just</p>
<p>stand up and you know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna fall down you</p>
<p>gotta adjust you</p>
<p>gotta move you</p>
<p>gotta keep going</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a constant</p>
<p>state of motion</p>
<p>yeah complacency is</p>
<p>definitely uh</p>
<p>a bad thing</p>
<p>with everything</p>
<p>right with your writing to</p>
<p>and how how</p>
<p>much you see you told me you&rsquo;re writing like</p>
<p>eight hours a day</p>
<p>right well yeah the</p>
<p>funny thing is as the business is</p>
<p>going down the toilet</p>
<p>it the porn business yeah the pimp</p>
<p>yeah the porn business is</p>
<p>going down the toilet the the only benefit of that</p>
<p>is i&rsquo;m working just enough that i don&rsquo;t have to like</p>
<p>you know sell</p>
<p>crack or whatever</p>
<p>to you know make up the difference</p>
<p>but it gives me all this free time to</p>
<p>write and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m getting the ten thousand</p>
<p>hours instead of having</p>
<p>spread out over</p>
<p>a decade i&rsquo;m getting it in a really intensive</p>
<p>short period</p>
<p>someone would be</p>
<p>crazy to not publish a shit i really</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s this is we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have this conversation a year from now and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>laughing and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a successful</p>
<p>writer no i&rsquo;m telling you man i&rsquo;m telling you it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>stuff thanks man</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s hard to be objective you know i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>i know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>suck and then i like</p>
<p>you say when you when you come across someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the top level the</p>
<p>craft that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>right and like martin</p>
<p>amis i was reading</p>
<p>money and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>jesus christ i</p>
<p>should just stop writing right now</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>i know how you feel man</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>gotta just be inspired by that just see</p>
<p>the the the economy of his words and the the perfect</p>
<p>you know choice</p>
<p>of sentences and adjectives</p>
<p>and nouns and all put together in a beautiful</p>
<p>like a poetry of words yeah</p>
<p>you know when that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>when someone really</p>
<p>nails it with writing and it really connects so you</p>
<p>wanna like go back and read the</p>
<p>whole passage over and over reverse engineer it exactly</p>
<p>just like when you do a joke</p>
<p>you find out why it worked</p>
<p>why the delivery not just the writing of why the</p>
<p>delivery the timing</p>
<p>of it and you get like a feeling a</p>
<p>sense of it and it just inspires you makes you better</p>
<p>you know when people talk</p>
<p>about plagiarism and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>plagiarism is obviously disgusting</p>
<p>and you were telling me that you&rsquo;ve been victimized</p>
<p>yeah to to a to a lesser extent uh</p>
<p>uh people are always gonna copy</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s work but everyone&rsquo;s inspired by</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s why i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a compliment</p>
<p>you get it isn&rsquo;t it isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s really just rework</p>
<p>i mean bullshit he&rsquo;s just a dummy</p>
<p>look i steal from</p>
<p>other people all the fucking time</p>
<p>stealing in a sense</p>
<p>right i take what</p>
<p>works for them</p>
<p>and like what kind of stuff</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll give you an example</p>
<p>chuck pollani</p>
<p>for example i</p>
<p>see what he does well</p>
<p>with his minimalist</p>
<p>style of writing called dangerous writing how he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make judgments for the reader he he shows</p>
<p>human condition he shows</p>
<p>human condition without saying this person is</p>
<p>you know mean</p>
<p>evil you know whatever and he lets the reader make his</p>
<p>own own decisions</p>
<p>by showing this person through</p>
<p>their actions</p>
<p>and his word economy is just fucking brilliant and</p>
<p>you know even if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you can read a thousand of his stories and</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just good commercial fiction and</p>
<p>never see the</p>
<p>craft and what he does</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the sign of good writing</p>
<p>right there is when the</p>
<p>craft is invisible and when it&rsquo;s seamless</p>
<p>you know just like</p>
<p>which sucks you in yeah</p>
<p>just like with i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>the comedy whatever the guy</p>
<p>might be a good</p>
<p>writer but you see him performing instead of him</p>
<p>you know being live</p>
<p>and in the moment and with the audience you know yeah</p>
<p>i remember the</p>
<p>first book that i ever read</p>
<p>where i was</p>
<p>like okay this guy is writing in a way that i&rsquo;ve really</p>
<p>never heard anybody</p>
<p>write before was bret</p>
<p>easton ellis american psycho</p>
<p>yeah i read that is</p>
<p>a couple of</p>
<p>way back in the day i was an open</p>
<p>micro back in the day</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>remember reading</p>
<p>and being like obsessed with it like what a fucking</p>
<p>crazy book that was yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a stream of consciousness</p>
<p>and first person present tense</p>
<p>point of view</p>
<p>which is one of the</p>
<p>things about the</p>
<p>school of minimalism called dangerous writing is</p>
<p>you write about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called dangerous not because you know the writers</p>
<p>gonna get like a</p>
<p>chain song like</p>
<p>come to your</p>
<p>house and you know attack you run around your</p>
<p>house whatever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dangerous writing because you</p>
<p>explore what scares the fuck out of you right</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re scared if you&rsquo;re scared to</p>
<p>write it and if it makes you feel uncomfortable if it</p>
<p>makes people reading you feel uncomfortable that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>but if it makes you uncomfortable as a writer you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going there and different parts of your your body</p>
<p>your your mind your</p>
<p>psyche that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where you should be</p>
<p>going you&rsquo;ll get your biggest</p>
<p>breakthroughs there</p>
<p>and he did that and he talked</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>fucking hallucinating to the</p>
<p>point where he sees a</p>
<p>cheerio on a talk show and</p>
<p>atm machines asking to feed cats and running around and</p>
<p>you know slicing girls up and that was that was one</p>
<p>thing but it was it was really brilliant how we use</p>
<p>those as tools to show that he can know</p>
<p>head to toe what you&rsquo;re wearing you know this</p>
<p>watches by gucci this</p>
<p>jackets by prada</p>
<p>and not know the person&rsquo;s name and he works the person</p>
<p>every single day</p>
<p>right so with any</p>
<p>great art whether it&rsquo;s whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literature whether it&rsquo;s film</p>
<p>comedy whatever</p>
<p>the best art is a</p>
<p>mirror that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>held up to the person that&rsquo;s observing it you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best art there is you know</p>
<p>hmm so and that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s why i thought american</p>
<p>cycle was fucking awesome</p>
<p>it was definitely unique</p>
<p>it was definitely unique and interesting</p>
<p>i always whenever i see something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy or depressing i always wonder why is this</p>
<p>entertaining and is it</p>
<p>entertaining</p>
<p>or is it something that i&rsquo;m just getting sucked into</p>
<p>like the other day i</p>
<p>started watching the road</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this dude&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>cormac mccarthy</p>
<p>wrote it yeah but who&rsquo;s the guy who&rsquo;s the vigo</p>
<p>mortensen thank you</p>
<p>vigo mortensen</p>
<p>is the main star and it is</p>
<p>very depressing and i got to the</p>
<p>point where he was showing his son how to blow his</p>
<p>brains out and i</p>
<p>shut it off</p>
<p>mike check please</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>watch that i don&rsquo;t need to get that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>depressing as fuck to me</p>
<p>i understand</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very real and you&rsquo;re capturing a real moment</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some art in that but</p>
<p>fuck man i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i want to get depressed</p>
<p>watching your</p>
<p>movie you definitely</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be at the book then the book was actually</p>
<p>yeah ours was just reading and our</p>
<p>fear was just reading and</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s pretty intense</p>
<p>yeah it is good</p>
<p>fucking these</p>
<p>mccarthy&rsquo;s mccarthy</p>
<p>mccarthy is a master</p>
<p>craftsman my</p>
<p>yeah bottom line he&rsquo;s a master craftsman</p>
<p>i i think i</p>
<p>could handle reading it better than i could</p>
<p>watching it</p>
<p>there was something</p>
<p>about him holding the gun up to the boy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mouth and like showing the boy how to blow his</p>
<p>brains out i was like okay</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be better to because he</p>
<p>paints pictures</p>
<p>in your mind and your imagination is far better</p>
<p>than what someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interpretation of what they got oh it is</p>
<p>script in the book or whatever and putting on a</p>
<p>screen but for a book i know that shit ain&rsquo;t real</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m watching</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m watching a</p>
<p>movie and a dude actually</p>
<p>sticks a gun in his</p>
<p>mouth and shown his kid how to blow his</p>
<p>brains out i&rsquo;m like okay what the fuck man</p>
<p>you can change your</p>
<p>focus and see there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>frame around the</p>
<p>screen and there&rsquo;s a tv and yeah</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even get to the</p>
<p>point of it all that end of the</p>
<p>world shit freaks me the fuck out anyway</p>
<p>i just know how</p>
<p>fragile our life really is and society really is and</p>
<p>earth really is and</p>
<p>yeah it takes</p>
<p>being put in a situation that you really get to</p>
<p>appreciate what life</p>
<p>really is yeah situation</p>
<p>was close to</p>
<p>close to death yeah</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>study that was just released</p>
<p>that psilocybin</p>
<p>is being used to help</p>
<p>people who are terminally ill</p>
<p>transition into</p>
<p>the the next</p>
<p>you know phase of life to die and</p>
<p>to relieve their anxiety</p>
<p>about this horrible</p>
<p>reality the fact they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna exit this planet</p>
<p>well they give people psilocybin</p>
<p>they give them mushrooms and they&rsquo;re like oh shit</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my of course it does dude that&rsquo;s my that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a lot of fears in life</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ll share this one of my</p>
<p>greatest fears is what</p>
<p>motivates me to try to find to do something with this</p>
<p>writing is i don&rsquo;t want to feel like my entire life</p>
<p>was a fucking</p>
<p>waste you know</p>
<p>life is fine i</p>
<p>could be i could i</p>
<p>could die you know</p>
<p>getting into the car and driving away from this</p>
<p>place i mean and</p>
<p>i want life to mean something you know i mean it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t subscribe to this</p>
<p>existentialist</p>
<p>nihilist bullshit that life is here for no</p>
<p>other reason than just to live it</p>
<p>and you know you take it as for what</p>
<p>it is that&rsquo;s bullshit i mean the odds of you being here</p>
<p>of you being here of all the</p>
<p>sperm that came that were competing to</p>
<p>fight fertilize the egg</p>
<p>at that exact moment in that</p>
<p>month or whatever of all the eggs that came</p>
<p>before and didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>fertilized and all the eggs that go</p>
<p>afterward i mean it</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t be just</p>
<p>random shit</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t it be just</p>
<p>random why can&rsquo;t it be that you just</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>random because of your own</p>
<p>ego and your</p>
<p>bodies need to survive and your own instincts in order</p>
<p>to procreate and keep moving there&rsquo;s a bunch of</p>
<p>systems that are set up</p>
<p>checks and balances</p>
<p>rewards and rewards for certain behavior</p>
<p>and a lot of it is set up and give you</p>
<p>these certain</p>
<p>powerful feelings</p>
<p>just to make sure that you keep</p>
<p>breeding and so you</p>
<p>could get this delusion of</p>
<p>grandeur and this idea of ego that</p>
<p>while i&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>for a purpose this is all for a purpose i have to</p>
<p>but that may</p>
<p>be just because your ego wants you to survive and</p>
<p>otherwise there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>other way of rationalizing it</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>you guys going deep</p>
<p>yeah well i</p>
<p>think the idea of us you know the idea of a person like</p>
<p>your thing being</p>
<p>important like what you have to give is important</p>
<p>i think in a</p>
<p>sense that&rsquo;s missing something</p>
<p>and i think that the greater</p>
<p>thing is not that you are here to do something</p>
<p>and i am here to do something and we are here to</p>
<p>contribute i think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all a part of something way bigger</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>individual it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the incredible emphasis on</p>
<p>the goals and</p>
<p>the accomplishments of the individual</p>
<p>that all of us together</p>
<p>are producing something we&rsquo;re all together working</p>
<p>as a society as a unit as a as a race as a gigantic</p>
<p>super organism</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re working towards something and</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing the part that you feel compelled to and</p>
<p>drawn to then you feel very unfulfilled</p>
<p>and a very unfulfilled life</p>
<p>feels like a life wasted</p>
<p>and how does one know what that</p>
<p>particular part</p>
<p>and or path is you know because you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it you know because you feel it you know because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creativity it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>other people enjoy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you this</p>
<p>absolutely 100 a fact and</p>
<p>a 100 true i</p>
<p>um have zero worries</p>
<p>about what i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>i have no worries</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m not doing what i</p>
<p>should be doing or that i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>on the right path of none</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 100 convinced and sure</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m enjoying myself and doing exactly what i</p>
<p>should be doing</p>
<p>and because of that i have so little stress</p>
<p>it eliminates</p>
<p>a huge amount of stress in your life that stress of</p>
<p>of needing to</p>
<p>prove yourself</p>
<p>or needing to find your way if you find your way</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>found your way then it&rsquo;s all just about</p>
<p>about being inspired and working hard</p>
<p>and creating and</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>the relationship that you have with the people that are</p>
<p>enjoying what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>you are putting</p>
<p>effort and because of that</p>
<p>effort and because of your focus</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting out this positive energy</p>
<p>in the form of something that you&rsquo;ve created that</p>
<p>other people can enjoy</p>
<p>and so they all tune into this and then they give</p>
<p>you praise and they give you encouragement keep going</p>
<p>and this in turn</p>
<p>boosts you up it</p>
<p>fills your fucking</p>
<p>brain with awesome chemicals you feel</p>
<p>more vibrant and healthy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a reward</p>
<p>system set up to keep you creating</p>
<p>and then you go back to your discipline</p>
<p>you go back to sitting in</p>
<p>front of the computer and putting</p>
<p>these long hours</p>
<p>and you are getting</p>
<p>a positive response from it i mean that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>driven yourself so hard so</p>
<p>quickly into writing</p>
<p>not just because you recognize that you need</p>
<p>some way out of a sinking business in the porn industry</p>
<p>but because you</p>
<p>experience a lot</p>
<p>of positive energy in regards to what you&rsquo;ve done the</p>
<p>stuff that you put out on the</p>
<p>underground</p>
<p>the stuff that you put out on your blogs how</p>
<p>tyler max is</p>
<p>responded to it a</p>
<p>bunch of people respond to your</p>
<p>stuff that way</p>
<p>so that positive energy keeps you going</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all a part of one big</p>
<p>giant thing</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s very hard for us to see</p>
<p>because we have egos and we have all</p>
<p>these natural instincts that are in</p>
<p>place to make sure that we keep doing what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>but i think all together it&rsquo;s a part of something giant</p>
<p>we just can&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too complex for us to see</p>
<p>completely or</p>
<p>understand even if we did yeah</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s a lot of freedom though and not</p>
<p>thinking of yourself as like you know</p>
<p>a person who matters</p>
<p>who has to make his mark and do something important</p>
<p>i do what i&rsquo;m doing even if no one</p>
<p>read a single word</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>i know you do believe me i have no illusions of like</p>
<p>and this is not me being like</p>
<p>self doubting or anything like that or</p>
<p>being negative</p>
<p>nancy i just understand</p>
<p>you know how the economics work and everything</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not doing this because i see myself</p>
<p>trading in my</p>
<p>shitty mustang for like a ferrari or something and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not very fulfilling to begin with even</p>
<p>if it did happen but</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get rich by writing</p>
<p>novels you know just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen you know</p>
<p>such what you can get rich by writing novels</p>
<p>you know i mean there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of people that have that that&rsquo;s silly</p>
<p>you know think</p>
<p>about all the people</p>
<p>that dean koontz fellows the stephen king&rsquo;s and okay i</p>
<p>should put i</p>
<p>should rephrase that you don&rsquo;t get rich by writing</p>
<p>literary fiction you get rich by writing commercial</p>
<p>fiction like</p>
<p>genre fiction that</p>
<p>um isn&rsquo;t that chuck</p>
<p>pollen that guy isn&rsquo;t he rich</p>
<p>haha isn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one example</p>
<p>in soul dude</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think like that you can</p>
<p>everything like that but the</p>
<p>point is it&rsquo;s not for the</p>
<p>money that&rsquo;s right yeah</p>
<p>no but you can get rich too dude</p>
<p>you should get a</p>
<p>fucking lock your</p>
<p>brain around that son</p>
