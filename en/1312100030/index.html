<p>The founding fathers back at it again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s call her daddy.</p>
<p>Woo.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been happening, Alex?</p>
<p>So guys, a lot of people will write in and they&rsquo;re like guys like how many crazy Dion&rsquo;s you get from like guys sending you dick pics, excetera.</p>
<p>0:38</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not the dick pics that have been coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the dick pic actual nudes from Ronald girls.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Girls are sending us their news for approval or any other show.</p>
<p>0:54</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s getting me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You are savages.</p>
<p>There are girls hitting us up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re titty and their eyes and their full frontal shots and like, hey, do you think this is good to send them?</p>
<p>I hook up an Alex and I are like well move your arm a little to the left and poke your butt out a little more in the office and then you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>1:10</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, thank you and then they send away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>This shit I do.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah, Dad King, I mean, keep it going and it&rsquo;s good because we are going to talk about needs today.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you worry?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Um, all I have other thing.</p>
<p>I want to bring up, okay, with regard to social media and dating apps.</p>
<p>1:27</p>
<p>If you guys are new here.</p>
<p>You should start at episode one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of how we roll at the data Yang.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like chronological order almost, but for everyone, that knows we have had everyone basically putting call her daddy or hashtag daddy gang in their dating biles because it&rsquo;s an easy quick match.</p>
<p>Good conversation starter this however, excuse some of the animalistic behavior.</p>
<p>1:48</p>
<p>That no has been brought to our attention.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of girls writing in being, like, I love when I see a guy that has Daddy gang or collar, Daddy.</p>
<p>I immediately swipe like for them.</p>
<p>However, guy These are writing into girls with pick up lines being like you want to give me the gl√ºcklich nose.</p>
<p>2:04</p>
<p>And how many times do men?</p>
<p>How many times we have to tell you?</p>
<p>If you want to have sex you have to put sex completely out of your mind.</p>
<p>Okay, fighting in.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s yeah guys, hums later.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is the thing and I get it.</p>
<p>2:20</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a double standard, but you guys should be letting if the girl knows your daddy gang.</p>
<p>She knows you&rsquo;re probably gonna be able to give her the goddamn couch cobbler.</p>
<p>Combo, but you should let her initiate it.</p>
<p>A little bit about the sex talk.</p>
<p>And if you want to initiate it, you&rsquo;re not going full force.</p>
<p>2:36</p>
<p>Hey Wanna Give me the Gluck 930 guys.</p>
<p>Play it cool.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re obviously doing it in such a joking.</p>
<p>Obvious sarcastic manner.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the guys that are out there throwing out lines like that.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>Just reel it in a little bit.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true unless it&rsquo;s your mom or your grandma.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No one really gives a fuck when someone&rsquo;s like Look at how cute my baby is.</p>
<p>4:00</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, they all look exactly the fucking same dream all, but that we get it.</p>
<p>We get you love your fucking dog.</p>
<p>Okay, so on social media, specifically, okay, there are people that get on their story and the entire thing is of their animal and it&rsquo;s all they talk about and it&rsquo;s all day long and I want to kill them.</p>
<p>4:20</p>
<p>In fact, in fact, in fact, this guy&rsquo;s I spit out my water.</p>
<p>When I came across, this story is heated over here.</p>
<p>Have the audacity to put on her story.</p>
<p>Oh God, swipe up.</p>

<p>She put a self-indulgent dude, swipe up.</p>
<p>If you want to see an album of my dog.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to fucking do want to look at a dog.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to an Instagram account that is for dogs, aren&rsquo;t going to go fucking Google.</p>
<p>4:53</p>
<p>It was the craziest thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d ever guys.</p>
<p>This is the thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna, I&rsquo;m gonna break it down.</p>
<p>To Basics from my psychologist mother.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>When I was really, really young, my mom taught me a really good lesson.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She basically would say, Alex, there are things that you love about yourself even about like family or inside jokes that you have or just shit that you think is great and nine out of 10 times.</p>
<p>5:23</p>
<p>No one cares.</p>
<p>No one wants to hear about you talk.</p>
<p>About yourself.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Tell them what you are enjoying or doing.</p>
<p>Okay, and like I know that kind of sounds fucked.</p>
<p>Everyone is selfish in the world.</p>
<p>No one.</p>
<p>Holy fucking cars are not from a young age when I would put you are younger song when I would put hours and hours and hours of my time, perfecting like a rendition of Survivor.</p>
<p>5:49</p>
<p>My Destiny&rsquo;s Child put on a show for my mom and watch.</p>
<p>You dance to watch me dance.</p>
<p>I would try to get other people to watch and they&rsquo;re like, fuck.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so I look at a young age, your No one cares.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why my mom said, only, I Alex just sit here and watch your phone thing dawn of One, Two Step.</p>
<p>6:05</p>
<p>No one else wants to see it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even fake it anymore.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t like, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>This point.</p>
<p>Like when someone shows me a picture in there, like tell me that&rsquo;s not the cutest thing.</p>
<p>Like I can.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I think you know, I used to be like, oh my God.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just like, yeah, he&rsquo;s a good-looking.</p>
<p>6:24</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a cute looking fella.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen 20 of them on Street.</p>
<p>Anyways, I think also just a Sending that quickly guys with social situations, just know that like, I don&rsquo;t know where no one cares.</p>
<p>No, and so if it&rsquo;s so insular to you and I think you like, honestly, I know it sucks unless it&rsquo;s your best best fucking friend even still then if you&rsquo;re renting.</p>
<p>6:42</p>
<p>So I mean, I didn&rsquo;t even know the name of your dog.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, fuck you, fuck you.</p>
<p>So that just be more self-aware.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you everywhere.</p>
<p>So aware and I&rsquo;m glad we got are out that list of grievances guys.</p>
<p>I promise we&rsquo;re not we&rsquo;re not going to rant anymore this episode.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>6:57</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, no, but uh, Look out of here.</p>
<p>The swipe of your fucking German Shepherd by only fuck.</p>
<p>Okay, nudies noodle noodle.</p>
<p>Pick noodle guys.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>This is, this is a highly requested topic and I think we&rsquo;re, I think we&rsquo;re equipped to talk.</p>
<p>7:17</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>In fact girls were going to tell you exactly how to perfect a nude.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many podcasts are going to be doing up at, here we go.</p>
<p>First and Most Sofia, what kind of nude are you first dropping on a guy?</p>
<p>7:32</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve talked about this before, and men have said they almost prefer an implied nude.</p>
<p>Oh, for you, just UD before.</p>
<p>You just hit him with the guys inside of your ladies and gentlemen, this is so fucking important.</p>
<p>7:49</p>
<p>When you are in the beginning stages of a guy, if you just go full-blown, send them your labia, which you can, you can absolutely.</p>
<p>But this is the thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Use.</p>
<p>This has almost a way to tempt them more.</p>
<p>If you full-blown are sending full nudes right away.</p>
<p>8:05</p>
<p>Well, what happens if next weekend, you&rsquo;re trying to slide in?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already seen it.</p>
<p>All.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Keep it a little mysterious and slow its slowly take.</p>
<p>I think clothing.</p>
<p>I think the trajectory is the implied noon up and then you go.</p>
<p>Tits are off which we can talk about more.</p>
<p>8:20</p>
<p>Yep, and then maybe, you know, noodles and then I do videos, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with the implied.</p>
<p>And so the implied nude, my Most implied, nude.</p>
<p>Like I think I said in another episode.</p>
<p>I would have liked a little baby tank.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a V.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have a Braun, so you can like, basically kind of like, see the outline of the kids.</p>
<p>8:38</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Some nips are hard.</p>
<p>Oh, and then like in little booty shorts, and there you go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re laying and you send it to him, and they&rsquo;re like, oh my God, fucking take off your clothes.</p>
<p>Okay, then you pick between tits or ass and Alex, you brought up an interesting point.</p>
<p>8:54</p>
<p>What did you say, you know the strategies?</p>
<p>I take.</p>
<p>So my strategy is.</p>
<p>I always feel out through dirty talk.</p>
<p>You can tell if a guy is an ass guy or more of a tech guy.</p>
<p>They may be both but usually they have a preference a little bit more.</p>
<p>So if he&rsquo;s an ass guy, I then first tempt him with the tit, I don&rsquo;t give him what he wants first.</p>
<p>9:11</p>
<p>So if you liked it&rsquo;s more, I sent him more of my ass shot.</p>
<p>Go that way, then you still have yet to use that like big boy in Your Arsenal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, he loves those tips.</p>
<p>Will.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna see my ass for kind of vibe.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So talk about boob, nudies.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Um, I think it&rsquo;s fucking stupid.</p>
<p>9:26</p>
<p>When girls will do where they cuddle.</p>
<p>Shovel Jesus, I can&rsquo;t talk today where you cover one nipple, and then you have the other one out what the final point.</p>
<p>I was in high school.</p>
<p>I wish that I still had access to the news.</p>
<p>I was family and I find remember that.</p>
<p>9:44</p>
<p>I would send one boob.</p>
<p>Wow, would you really another close of one boob and one nipple?</p>
<p>My nipple?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Like, what he&rsquo;s like, what is the other hand?</p>
<p>Looks really happy.</p>
<p>Actually, let&rsquo;s go down memory.</p>
<p>Layne high school has I want to die in high school.</p>
<p>10:01</p>
<p>I remember there was this guy named Tom Tom, not our editor.</p>
<p>This was a nice shot, you Tommy.</p>
<p>And he asked me for a nude, a picture of my breast, but specific rustical.</p>
<p>Sometimes guys will hit you with a specific.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I want to see your tits.</p>
<p>10:17</p>
<p>Yeah, um and me and my two friends we were like, okay, let&rsquo;s all take a picture of art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s know and we&rsquo;ll pick the hottest one.</p>
<p>And who who ever has it been?</p>
<p>Better rack and send it his way.</p>
<p>I would do something like that all the time and I&rsquo;m thinking back on it.</p>
<p>10:35</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a.</p>
<p>So when I hooked up with him and I said, fucking tail has yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, with you by be like, these are not your boobies, like your nipples look.</p>
<p>Very different, dude.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually like dude, not cute, not cute.</p>
<p>But okay, back to the the booby nudes.</p>
<p>10:51</p>
<p>Alright, it&rsquo;s alright, I fucking love it.</p>
<p>Boob nudes.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really hot.</p>
<p>If you hold them together with like one.</p>
<p>And if you try to like bring them together, that&rsquo;s how and one of your thumbs could be.</p>
<p>Maybe like kind of covering one nipple, but that looks way less trihard than if you&rsquo;re just straight-up cover a nipple with your fucking hand.</p>
<p>11:09</p>
<p>So hold them together or if you have a bra on pull down the once one side of the strap and then have kind of like you pulling down that side of the bra.</p>
<p>So like a nipples out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hot.</p>
<p>I was in that before getting a booby booby shirts are hot guys, but you gotta like make them look big and Bloated pulled them.</p>
<p>11:28</p>
<p>So The other day, Alex.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I was trying to take an ass shot.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>This was so fun though, dude.</p>
<p>I know you were dying.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t really done them that much and so I reached out to my friend Alex and you told me, I remember clear as day.</p>
<p>11:48</p>
<p>You were like put on little tiny booty shorts.</p>
<p>That have your ass hanging out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And go into your room.</p>
<p>I probably did it in front of you actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did it and you angle.</p>
<p>Camera from the bottom and it&rsquo;s from the bottom up.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like taking a picture almost of underneath your ass, you know, this is this is a loved it.</p>
<p>12:09</p>
<p>He loved it.</p>
<p>No guys.</p>
<p>I wish you could have seen because Sophia&rsquo;s going in and out of her room.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, wait, what it, how does this one?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, no, no, you gotta get more of an angle.</p>
<p>So we can like kind of see like a little bit of your pussy and he&rsquo;s like, wait, no, no more war.</p>
<p>It was actually a video and I just kind of like you to my but quickly, which if you are gonna do a video.</p>
<p>12:27</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I I almost sent something that could have completely ruin the relationship with this man.</p>
<p>I was angling the camera my ass looked great.</p>
<p>And then of course I had to bring the camera, back up to turn off the video, to end the video and my face looked like Gollum and you are about to God.</p>
<p>12:46</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t realize that by the end of the video early, Lord of the Rings.</p>
<p>Like also night bring the camera up and is my fucking face.</p>
<p>Be careful when you&rsquo;re sending videos that you are editing them and coming up.</p>
<p>I want to talk about that a shot really quickly because I think this is a really great opportunity for girls.</p>
<p>13:03</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like great opportunity a great opportunity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say iconic.</p>
<p>The ass looks amazing by this angle Phi.</p>
<p>Hey how I transition from an ass shot?</p>
<p>To a video ass shot is I usually this make a video then of my hand squeezing one of my ass cheeks and then I&rsquo;ll like slap it and it Will jiggle because what a guy wants is we always say POV shot.</p>
<p>13:32</p>
<p>A guy wants to Envision themselves doing that.</p>
<p>So like me grabbing it and slapping it and leaving a mark on my own ass and sending him that video at that angle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like by God, like, this is the best fucking thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the angles.</p>
<p>Oh, a thousand percent.</p>
<p>13:50</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about some wet to.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this girl wrote in and I want to read it.</p>
<p>Okay, because it was so hot, okay.</p>
<p>And she said that she was going to let us know about her boyfriends, most favorite nude that she&rsquo;s ever taken.</p>
<p>14:07</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>So this is some serious knowledge until I&rsquo;m spreading.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She said while taking a bubble bath, I grabbed my phone and pulled my body up out of the water a little bit.</p>
<p>You want to have your tits out of the water and you can tilt your hips to show your pussy to without being totally out of the water.</p>
<p>14:26</p>
<p>The bubbles can sort of frame.</p>
<p>Body, and you can use them to make your waist look smaller.</p>
<p>Not to mention that just being in a bathtub is sexy and the way your skin looks all wet.</p>
<p>And soapy is so hot to guys.</p>
<p>I mean, men love when you&rsquo;re wet.</p>
<p>14:43</p>
<p>I I&rsquo;m well, I could work several ways several.</p>
<p>What just any time.</p>
<p>Do you have anywhere?</p>
<p>I Sophia read this to me this morning and I was like one of the best news I&rsquo;ve ever taken.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>I showed it to you.</p>
<p>14:58</p>
<p>I could do you want me to explain why she&rsquo;s literally holding a towel and it&rsquo;s showing some sideboob.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s of the side of your body.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is like actually hilarious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m explaining it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a the side of Alex&rsquo;s body a little under the but still under the lot.</p>
<p>15:14</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s showing the outline of your ass like the left side of your out.</p>
<p>Yep, the left side of your tit.</p>
<p>Yep, and then there&rsquo;s water trickling down my body by.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh my God, you&rsquo;re holding the towel to come.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;m kind of covering - Fold the towel.</p>
<p>15:29</p>
<p>I love I was able to explain to you the fact that you have, right?</p>
<p>We go.</p>
<p>So I think anything girls, if you can take that like out of the shower out of the bath or in the bath fucking hot.</p>
<p>Those are the go twos like that.</p>
<p>I think a lot of girls forget that to take.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So capitalize on those wet moment.</p>
<p>15:46</p>
<p>I want to bring something up K because I was thinking about this and I&rsquo;m like, this is no easy feat.</p>
<p>No, I mean I have almost broken both my arms and half trying to get the perfect new taking a Is a fucking work out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a workout but you can skip the genuine.</p>
<p>16:01</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking use one day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking and I&rsquo;m like, you know, if I&rsquo;m not in the mood to do that.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I just have Alex, take it?</p>
<p>Yeah, for me.</p>
<p>I want to know, Alex.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Do you think guys?</p>
<p>Give a shit?</p>
<p>If it is.</p>
<p>So blatantly obvious that someone took the nude for them like without weird them out?</p>
<p>16:21</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s such a good question.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>This is actually very interesting because I know our relationship is very interesting.</p>
<p>I have MILF hunt.</p>
<p>Her.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m like, oh, I haven&rsquo;t taken a new now.</p>
<p>I want inspiration.</p>
<p>I have him.</p>
<p>Send me other girls new.</p>
<p>I have him.</p>
<p>Send me his favorite news that he&rsquo;s gone from girls.</p>
<p>16:37</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but when you&rsquo;re sending a new thought, shit ends up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a game of telephone.</p>
<p>So we have like a little like Dropbox and he will send me like his favorite nudes and he&rsquo;s like, oh, I like this one.</p>
<p>You should do this one.</p>
<p>So but the point of that was he sent me one one and the girl was on the bed with her like a sup ass out but like someone was taking it.</p>
<p>16:58</p>
<p>Like she did not take it.</p>
<p>So I think, I think for a MILF Hunter, the I asked him.</p>
<p>I said, did you wait, someone took that like, does that bother you?</p>
<p>And he was like Cooper?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck fight.</p>
<p>I got the picture.</p>
<p>She looks hot as fuck, and I&rsquo;m envisioning myself fucking her.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Okay, so I think of your just fucking for the most part.</p>
<p>17:14</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And take a hop just do it.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re you know a little bit more serious.</p>
<p>Some guys I think would be like the guy was like, um, did your ex boyfriend?</p>
<p>Take whatever.</p>
<p>But I do think it could be kind of hot then if you&rsquo;re like, no, my girlfriend took it for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hot if like, were drunk, and I wanted to take a picture for you.</p>
<p>17:31</p>
<p>Can you write in and yeah, I think most guys really don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Um, I want to bring up quickly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve talked about work, nudes and taking news at work for your man.</p>
<p>And this is something I did.</p>
<p>One of my last relationships, a lot.</p>
<p>Actually, it was and it kind of spices.</p>
<p>Should I?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m at work baby and he&rsquo;s like, I want to see you.</p>
<p>17:49</p>
<p>I you can be obviously, I mean, sitting in your chair, taking a bike under the - yeah, very risky, but more hot running into the bathroom.</p>
<p>The dog room.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve had Learning taken in there a lot.</p>
<p>I actually read one.</p>
<p>Daddy gang member said her boyfriend, wanted her to keep the bathroom stall open and take it in the mirror.</p>
<p>18:07</p>
<p>So like it was very risky like someone could walk in and this bitch is basically fucking like naked.</p>
<p>Imagine if your coworker walked in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no I - Kate join a cop and roll.</p>
<p>I had a co-worker catch me, taking a selfie one time in the bathroom.</p>
<p>And that alone made me want to quit.</p>
<p>18:23</p>
<p>Imagine.</p>
<p>I can only imagine your like, that is not my labia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but so we&rsquo;re gonna use our Always hot.</p>
<p>And yeah, obviously, I mean, I think listen it mirror nudes will never die.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think might one of my favorite go twos is when you put one ass cheek up on the sink.</p>
<p>18:41</p>
<p>The other one, your leg is down.</p>
<p>Kind of push that like that little, you gotta fake a few, got a fake, your ass looks amazing.</p>
<p>One leg up on it.</p>
<p>And then the other leg guys, make sure you&rsquo;re kind of pushing that leg that&rsquo;s on the ground out.</p>
<p>So that your other cheek looks really nice and plump that wasn&rsquo;t fucking go to.</p>
<p>18:58</p>
<p>Do you want to talk about vagina shots really quickly?</p>
<p>So because those are risky adjustment vagina shots, I think girls are like terrified of taking the yeah, I think to make your vagina look cuter is you should have something in it.</p>
<p>19:14</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve said it before.</p>
<p>Hey like you&rsquo;re in your fingers a toy.</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>But also you can just own it and it&rsquo;s a vagina and send it over you want.</p>
<p>But Alex and I were talking about this a video.</p>
<p>I was going to say so I maybe Be a little different on this, but I have rarely ever sent of the shot.</p>
<p>19:33</p>
<p>Unless I&rsquo;m wearing like, oh, cute little thong.</p>
<p>And like my fingers in their eye when it comes time to the V.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sending bids.</p>
<p>Like I have my fingers in there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, fingering myself or I have a toy in there and like I have like Lube, so it&rsquo;s super wet and I&rsquo;m like sending him a video of me like fucking myself with my toys.</p>
<p>19:53</p>
<p>I just think that&rsquo;s so hot videos.</p>
<p>Take things to a different level that are just they can.</p>
<p>So nasty disgusting because you can be making noises while you&rsquo;re fucking yourself really good.</p>
<p>The noise of the show bunch of shit.</p>
<p>Oh my God, so hot.</p>
<p>20:09</p>
<p>Oh, so that&rsquo;s like the next level of a nude.</p>
<p>Yeah, people beware of what is in the background.</p>
<p>Guys of your you need to fucking be so mindful, dude.</p>
<p>I know times I&rsquo;ve sent shit and I&rsquo;m like, also shit.</p>
<p>That just wouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>It would make it less sexy.</p>
<p>Like my fucking retainers are like right next to my sky, Pat isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>20:28</p>
<p>Oh my God, some of these bitches probably want the right there.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re fucking pimple cream or like just something that like a doctor would I be careful just shit that you really really want them to be happy being?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fucking cute.</p>
<p>So yeah be really mindful because you could fuck yourself with what their shit in the background of your nude or you could be a little sketchy though, and like throwing like maybe like a used condom in the background.</p>
<p>20:52</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, is she fucking around on me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hey, my friend used condom like a comment.</p>
<p>Little more spot online biology and be a power play.</p>
<p>If you really want, your daughter think you&rsquo;re cheating on here just like a guy&rsquo;s shirt and you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s like stop.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like you lies your brother at your apartment.</p>
<p>21:09</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always a good one.</p>
<p>Fuck with them.</p>
<p>So you could use to fuck with people.</p>
<p>We have problem that I said Dada.</p>
<p>Honestly, Sofia.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Do you think maybe we should just go home and like take these?</p>
<p>But in clothing so they see the ankles were talking about, like what if we do like is completely Brilliant and we will just take it in like pants and a sweater.</p>
<p>21:32</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to post pictures of exactly.</p>
<p>You should angle your body.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t we didn&rsquo;t forget about you men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be mad at you for sending a dick pic, because Alex, and I were talking about this.</p>

<p>Yeah, men don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dick.</p>
<p>And then like what their body if they like nice bottom knobs.</p>
<p>Well aren&rsquo;t even still then even let&rsquo;s just get into it.</p>
<p>22:20</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So most girls say that a dick pic is always gross and they don&rsquo;t want and I disagree with that purse.</p>
<p>I disagree to.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m glad we agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I mean, people are so shocked.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like the colour that a girls like dick mix, who thought if it&rsquo;s unwarranted.</p>
<p>22:38</p>
<p>No, no, listen.</p>
<p>First of all, just add putting out the ever sent in Deanna format.</p>
<p>Fuck out of here.</p>
<p>I blocked blocked and blocked.</p>
<p>Knock it the fuck off.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Not not, okay, never in a million years, not here, not for it, not going to happen ever.</p>
<p>22:53</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s a gun to your head.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Nope, not affect families.</p>
<p>Life depends on it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Doing it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing it today.</p>
<p>We are you serious?</p>
<p>Yeah, however, it&rsquo;s situational.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this morning when we were like Halle just talk about Dick Pics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so weird with nudes because you can.</p>
<p>23:10</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to explain them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to just show them.</p>
<p>So I was trying to explain to Sofia one of my exes had a tendency to take nudes in the mirror.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But the thing that I just wanted to critique him on a little bit, is he&rsquo;ll be Hard.</p>
<p>23:29</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll take his dick and he&rsquo;ll hold it and he&rsquo;ll like, pull it to the side.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like kind of touching his thigh and that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Still, but the issue is that he is covering half of his fucking shop.</p>
<p>So he looks like a 2 inch Earth.</p>
<p>23:46</p>
<p>Covering half the shock.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not on their National.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to explain this to Sophia this morning at 8:00 a.m., She&rsquo;s just opening her eyes and like, you know, I&rsquo;m just going to show you.</p>
<p>So I made a folder of All My Exes.</p>
<p>Fucking dick picks up.</p>
<p>Watch this compilation and look how it&rsquo;s a theme.</p>
<p>24:01</p>
<p>They were all the exact same.</p>
<p>His dick must love to bend to the right.</p>
<p>Yes, everything.</p>
<p>A little unnerved.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it was just like, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s caught, he&rsquo;s not making it look bigger.</p>
<p>It would have looked bigger.</p>
<p>If he didn&rsquo;t cover it at all, guys.</p>
<p>24:17</p>
<p>Hold it at.</p>
<p>Like the tip and also not your whole fucking no.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>It like you&rsquo;re not fisting your day go, cuz that&rsquo;s the worse.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fucking fist is bigger than your dick.</p>
<p>Oh, like Guys, so yeah, that is a Fine Thing.</p>
<p>Amir pictures are fine because he, you know, he had a nice body but he pulls it over and he&rsquo;s covering his dick.</p>
<p>24:35</p>
<p>With a point is he&rsquo;s a flaccid dick pic of her.</p>
<p>Okay, because I do not even know.</p>
<p>I do my ex one time sent me.</p>
<p>That was saying what I&rsquo;m I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Probably was like, get it hard.</p>
<p>Oh my God, he&rsquo;s not trying to make it hard.</p>
<p>24:51</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a Bighorn after your performance and your nude, hopefully.</p>
<p>Maybe other guy up.</p>
<p>No, I would literally like died.</p>
<p>Anyone setting you a fucking flaccid.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think that may be a better way to get a girl&rsquo;s attention in the DMS.</p>
<p>25:08</p>
<p>If you send last addicted to hardik, that&rsquo;s never warranted.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fucking tell.</p>
<p>No, okay, but I said it was situational.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about situation.</p>
<p>So a, my ex-boyfriend and I, we dated for a while and I would find it really hot when he would be at like a work event or at a dinner or something.</p>
<p>25:27</p>
<p>And he, and we were like, Kind of talking dirty or he&rsquo;s just like I was just thinking about you and like, I&rsquo;m hard thinking about you and he would take a picture like in the bathroom stall, how we were talking about, or like just kind of like move his pants and take a picture.</p>
<p>I was kind of into it even like sending a showing the outline in his pants.</p>
<p>25:47</p>
<p>Like, hey, I&rsquo;m so hard about a work event.</p>
<p>Sometimes you would send the outline and like kind of beholding him.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is a thing, guys.</p>
<p>What you have to understand about Dick Pics is Girls need like, we always have said, kind of like girls, obviously need to be way more mentally stimulated.</p>
<p>26:05</p>
<p>So, when you&rsquo;re telling me that like I turned you on and therefore you just got hard at a work event and you show me that that turns me on first because like it&rsquo;s a situation where I just did that to you if it&rsquo;s unwarranted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay sometimes but there&rsquo;s just levels that a girl needs to get there.</p>
<p>26:23</p>
<p>Not I mean what it really comes down to is men are just way more.</p>
<p>You√≠ll that women?</p>
<p>Yes, like there has to be like something that you&rsquo;re also saying when you&rsquo;re showing that hard like, Okay, Sophia this this may like rub girls wrong way.</p>
<p>But personally, I&rsquo;ve only a couple times gotten a picture of a guy when he&rsquo;s hitting me like his body and stuff that I would like kind of get turned on like, who even even if your body is like, Chinese and doing some level and sends you a shirtless pic.</p>
<p>26:55</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like, oh, I&rsquo;m wet, you know, here and there, maybe Kind of like, oh shit, but like I would honestly rather see a guy in a suit.</p>
<p>Do I would rather get a picture from a guy in like an amazing suit?</p>
<p>And he looks like hot as fuck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How fucked up.</p>
<p>27:11</p>
<p>No, weird like that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t send us shirtless pic.</p>
<p>Send us pictures in sooth.</p>
<p>How hilarious is that?</p>
<p>Because if you ask a guy, whatever babe, would you rather me send you a picture of me and like this beautiful gown, or do you want make it for me naked?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what that&rsquo;s men and - yeah, this brings up a good point that this happened to me yesterday.</p>
<p>27:33</p>
<p>Oh, I was maybe perusing the internet for pornographic material.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Gotta love that and um, it wasn&rsquo;t doing it for me, the videos.</p>
<p>Okay, and I came across like written erotica.</p>
<p>27:49</p>
<p>Like well those that was so much more of a turn-on and got me there faster than watching.</p>
<p>And maybe it was just like a one-off and like, you know, but like that&rsquo;s what interests, it wasn&rsquo;t thing.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think a lot of men would be on the same page.</p>
<p>28:07</p>
<p>Yeah, like girls.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you were having to Envision.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How the it was actually going down.</p>
<p>I also just want to say I do personally think it&rsquo;s hot if a guy and I are talking dirty and he sends me a video of himself like jacking off in finishing to like, what we were just saying, I think it&rsquo;s hot.</p>
<p>28:26</p>
<p>Yeah, I do it and I&rsquo;m like That&rsquo;s hot because you&rsquo;re sending that to me.</p>
<p>I mean, they could be sending it to 12 other girls.</p>
<p>I would never know.</p>
<p>But yeah, so I think it&rsquo;s hot guys just be sparing with the dick pics and know when is the right time, don&rsquo;t send an unwarranted.</p>
<p>28:43</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s fucking driving with her mom to church and she gets a dick because we&rsquo;re off the fucking road.</p>
<p>And then also, when guys are like, constantly sending a picture of their dick, I&rsquo;m like, do you think your dick is like a magic wand?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, shut the fuck.</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the fucking liked when I see how he would like, right?</p>
<p>28:58</p>
<p>About what episode that was like, episode number one or two Sofia&rsquo;s X would write in permanent marker on his weiner home.</p>
<p>But like two eyes and then use the wiener whole move up and down as a mouth and like howdy-ho.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fucking awesome.</p>
<p>What a turn-on turned out, really did it for me, is that he turned his dick into it Western character, okay.</p>
<p>29:22</p>
<p>We are telling you why you are in a committed relationship and your partner is not fucking hard pill to swallow right there baby.</p>
<p>Yeah girls and guys have completely different reasons.</p>
<p>29:41</p>
<p>So I think we should like start with girls.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So here are probably the most likely reasons why your girlfriend isn&rsquo;t fucking you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Listen up one.</p>
<p>I would say she&rsquo;s not feeling confident and she&rsquo;s kind of like insecure with her body at the time.</p>
<p>30:01</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>She fell out of love and she no longer has left for you.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s cheating.</p>
<p>Yes, or you let yourself go and she&rsquo;s not attracted to you right now.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s kind of common like the guy has the six-pack and then now like all of a sudden his titties are bigger than hers.</p>
<p>30:19</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of common one.</p>
<p>So those are, those are the Main reasons why a girl wouldn&rsquo;t be fucking her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Yeah, I completely agree.</p>
<p>And again, I just want to like reiterate for guys.</p>
<p>Their reasoning is completely done.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>30:35</p>
<p>So Sofia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you please?</p>
<p>I know this is a little personal shut actually, fuck off, we get personal shit.</p>
<p>I know, can you tell us?</p>
<p>If a time that you were dating a guy, your boyfriend, and you of you It had sex with her and why, okay, so, okay before I get started.</p>
<p>30:59</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I just want to say that you&rsquo;re a good person.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s like you cheated.</p>
<p>I like no actually.</p>
<p>But like yeah, so it&rsquo;s not with the point.</p>
<p>No, I cheated after I.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So everyone&rsquo;s like, why don&rsquo;t you just break up with the person?</p>
<p>31:16</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, you know, I think that&rsquo;s like sometimes.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>People are thinking.</p>
<p>Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p>Okay, like, Like know how many people stay in relationships way longer than they should.</p>
<p>Yeah, your long time.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Like everyone&rsquo;s done that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not an option.</p>
<p>Everyone.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck.</p>
<p>31:32</p>
<p>So for me, I had fallen out of love with this man.</p>
<p>Okay, and I was just kind of staying in it for Comfort reasons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually, I feel like a really common one.</p>
<p>The lengths I would go to to avoid sex with this man.</p>
<p>31:47</p>
<p>Oh, no, you would think that he was like my captor and I was like, Terrified of him.</p>
<p>Like it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Let me okay.</p>
<p>Let me explain to you.</p>
<p>Okay, he had his own place, guys.</p>
<p>I oh my God.</p>
<p>32:02</p>
<p>I need a guy&rsquo;s a Pokemon Place.</p>
<p>God, Richard.</p>
<p>You had a mortgage.</p>
<p>So his living room was freezing.</p>

<p>It was like the cheapest couch.</p>
<p>You could get at Ikea.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Where are you going with this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad hi.</p>
<p>We would be sitting there watching TV.</p>
<p>Okay, and he would beg me to go into his room.</p>
<p>Beg me.</p>
<p>32:48</p>
<p>He would be like, Sophia this couch is so uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>Seeing let&rsquo;s just go lay in my bed and watch TV.</p>
<p>I would be trembling shaking and my back would start aching.</p>
<p>And I would be like, I love it here in the living room, on the couch, with you want to go to bedroom because I knew if I went into his bed that we were kind of having sex.</p>
<p>33:10</p>
<p>No.</p>

<p>Yeah, dude, it honestly is so fucking crazy.</p>
<p>I feel like, guys are listening to the sea level.</p>

<p>And I feel like, every girl has done this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Saturday morning, and I know that he&rsquo;s gonna like wanna have some like hungover sex.</p>
<p>36:09</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, let&rsquo;s continue day drinking.</p>
<p>I would like a mimosa out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s getting hammered.</p>
<p>And you know, what&rsquo;s the most fucked-up part about all of this?</p>
<p>The most Most the most well, we&rsquo;ve already said the most.</p>
<p>36:24</p>
<p>You just said you drugged yourself to fucking guy but the most fucked-up part is we don&rsquo;t want to fuck them.</p>
<p>No, but God forbid any living female gets his attention.</p>
<p>Nope, all of a sudden.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re going through his phone to making sure.</p>
<p>36:41</p>
<p>He is not getting any pussy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in anywhere else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I know you&rsquo;re not getting pussy for me and I&rsquo;m gonna make sure that you&rsquo;re not getting it from anyone else.</p>
<p>Mess up the fuck do is okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like four girls.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>36:56</p>
<p>Jewel.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting hammered.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re avoiding sighs.</p>
<p>Have you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for girls?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fucked up, guys.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re changing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re changing or not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would say in it that Ma, I wouldn&rsquo;t do unless they&rsquo;re like really rich me now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So now that we&rsquo;ve just really broken guys, hard.</p>
<p>So guys, if your girlfriend is avoiding fucking you, she&rsquo;ll totally fucking hate you, and is trying to plan her Escape Route, but on men men, the reasons men avoid sex are Completely different completely to folk abyad here 180 because men are disgusting animals.</p>
<p>37:28</p>
<p>At the end of the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it.</p>
<p>Once I&rsquo;ll say it again, like they will fuck a couch cushion.</p>
<p>A grape.</p>
<p>We know.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll fuck their teddy bears are like it is, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Yeah, they are not turning down sex ever.</p>
<p>Ever really.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re absolutely not turning down a blowjob ever from their girlfriend.</p>
<p>37:48</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>So, I want to say first.</p>
<p>Also, if your man One is avoiding fucking you ladies aside from being something like, medically wrong.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say that first, like, maybe something with the new medication is like fucking with his testosterone.</p>
<p>38:04</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s tell them the reasons, why your man would consistently?</p>
<p>Yes, not be fucking you.</p>
<p>Yes, because obviously boys and girls have like there.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have weird moment and you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m not in the mood but like, if this is a consistent you are like trying to beg this guy to have sex with you and he&rsquo;s not down.</p>
<p>38:22</p>
<p>The reason these are the reasons, he&rsquo;s either gay.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with being gay is wrong with that all absolutely gang like, you&rsquo;re his beard, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s asexual.</p>
<p>Yep, or he&rsquo;s cheating and like the guilt from fucking you and someone else is like too much at that moment in time.</p>
<p>38:43</p>
<p>Um, yep.</p>
<p>Those are the three and not ever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That might be a tough pill to swallow, but that&rsquo;s just what it is.</p>
<p>Because Is I think it&rsquo;s really hard to because on out the girls side.</p>
<p>We had said, you know, sometime if our man lets himself go we&rsquo;re not physically attracted that doesn&rsquo;t apply to guys.</p>
<p>39:03</p>
<p>I would, I would normally say like girls.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve let yourself go and he&rsquo;s maybe not as attracted to, you know, but even still.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>No man.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to turn down his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Getting on her knees and being like, please place your dick.</p>
<p>39:22</p>
<p>In my mouth so I can suck it until you come in the back of my club Gluck.</p>
<p>Let me know.</p>
<p>No, God doesn&rsquo;t matter if you put on 300 pounds, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter or you&rsquo;ve lost 300 or doesn&rsquo;t matter hundred pounds.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s gonna, he&rsquo;s not gonna turn down a blow job.</p>
<p>39:37</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s either gay asexual or cheating and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the tea and we&rsquo;re telling you that because we&rsquo;ve had a lot of girls being like, my boyfriend is avoiding sex.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do men don&rsquo;t avoid, so they don&rsquo;t especially with their girlfriend.</p>
<p>Even even we just ask someone, Even if they are cheating it would have to be like, oh, really?</p>
<p>39:56</p>
<p>Yeah, really big situation of them cheating, right?</p>
<p>And also with the whole cheating thing is, I think they might avoid it but I think they will like after a while.</p>
<p>Zack, fucking I agree.</p>
<p>So I really think one of the big things is if your boyfriend&rsquo;s not fucking you, he&rsquo;s gay again, nothing wrong with that, but that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>40:15</p>
<p>Yeah, or again, the medically wrong.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, but like, only that only can last for so long, right?</p>
<p>But like maybe if you started a new medication, Ation, like whatever.</p>
<p>No guy.</p>
<p>I just thought about it because we really just talked about.</p>
<p>We drag ourselves.</p>
<p>No, fucking guy is getting himself so drunk that he can muster up the courage to fuck his girlfriend.</p>
<p>40:31</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>Guys, and girls are very different.</p>
<p>So, I hope that maybe this gave you some clarity in your relationships and I&rsquo;m hoping we&rsquo;re not ending any today.</p>
<p>No, dude, people fucking listen with their boyfriend, or their girlfriend.</p>
<p>Watch a couple.</p>
<p>Be listening to this turbo staring at each other.</p>
<p>40:47</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even care.</p>
<p>It should, it should so There you go.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t end up apps, you know, left ours for like two years.</p>
<p>I like I just gotta make sure it&rsquo;s haven&rsquo;t, you noticed.</p>
<p>I always have to get hammered when I hang out with you.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>41:02</p>
<p>So it goes as far as friendships.</p>
<p>Fuck you.</p>
<p>All right, right fetishes fetishes fat boy.</p>
<p>I thought you&rsquo;d never bring it.</p>
<p>I want to start doing one of these every week.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, as long as the world keeps spinning.</p>
<p>41:18</p>
<p>There is always going to be a new fetish that comes.</p>
<p>I thought I I&rsquo;d heard it all until I heard this one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Bring it to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pay me.</p>
<p>I was hanging out with my guy friends.</p>
<p>Okay, and we were talking about porn.</p>
<p>Look, what else?</p>
<p>41:35</p>
<p>Look, how he and Alex talked about him when you hang out with what normal were normal when she brought up P NP porn.</p>
<p>Okay, does that mean?</p>
<p>And what he told me, I was like, there are you&rsquo;re joking.</p>
<p>41:52</p>
<p>I guess it stands for party and play.</p>
<p>Oh, so just sounds fun.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like good job.</p>
<p>What we would do?</p>
<p>We go to parties and then we fuck.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this is a little bit different.</p>
<p>I got on PornHub and I was like looking at this and it is very particular.</p>
<p>42:12</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s it is it&rsquo;s literally people smoke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually meth.</p>
<p>Like I think it can be any drug, but meth is the main one is The go to okay, and it&rsquo;s these people and they smoke meth like sometimes you even watch them, do it.</p>
<p>42:28</p>
<p>Okay, and then they fuck after and I was like, okay.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I do that on every week.</p>
<p>Every Tuesday.</p>
<p>I can type more in this bitch, I guess, because meth makes people so God damn horny.</p>
<p>42:44</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s to the point where I was like watching it and like the guy&rsquo;s dick will be inside of either and I think it&rsquo;s like kind of popular gay.</p>
<p>But a guy&rsquo;s dick will be inside of another guy&rsquo;s butt or a vagina and like, it&rsquo;s all the way in and the girls are the guys just like I need it more and more and more like giving more like super hard.</p>
<p>43:02</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re feigning and they&rsquo;re so fucking horny that they&rsquo;re fucking like out of control like that.</p>
<p>Guys, like a like, it&rsquo;s like a life-or-death.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>And by, and this is my friend&rsquo;s favorite porn.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s such a turn-on, like, for people to be that fucking horny.</p>
<p>43:20</p>
<p>I started watching some Um, there were some that were a little scary.</p>
<p>Yeah, Sophia and I were sitting in the living room again, at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>This morning, just getting our notes together and so feels like, hey, I have a fetish.</p>
<p>I want to talk about and all of sudden porn is playing on her computer.</p>
<p>43:36</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like that doesn&rsquo;t really sound like normal porn and so feel like Alex would have come watch us.</p>
<p>I like having my coffee.</p>

<p>43:54</p>
<p>It is just so, it&rsquo;s a grass.</p>

<p>And I mean I saw some when they&rsquo;re actually like hitting the meth pipe in the scene and it&rsquo;s like this girl and she&rsquo;s like laying in a bed like somewhere in the Midwest and like another boyfriend&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>44:10</p>

<p>45:53</p>
<p>Okay, so you don&rsquo;t we go to Carl&rsquo;s jr.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s when it when the story really started to take a turn, we got cheeseburger cheeseburger.</p>

<p>Quark Carl&rsquo;s jr.</p>
<p>46:10</p>

<p>We realized we don&rsquo;t have time to eat.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fucking sucks man.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to take the food on the plane eating food on a plane.</p>
<p>Now, before we got on the plane.</p>
<p>I started to freak out a little bit about the smell.</p>
<p>46:27</p>
<p>Alex was like holding this ginormous bag with like literally three different combo meals, five back.</p>
<p>By the bag is like disintegrating from greasy covered in grease and Alex holding it freaking the fuck out.</p>
<p>46:46</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, yeah, I was like, this is gonna smell so bad, is gonna smell so bad.</p>
<p>I had your own bowling here.</p>
<p>Like Alex will be fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, come on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like holding just get on the plane.</p>
<p>We gotta get on the plane.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>We are walking past first class and someone says, well, that smells good.</p>
<p>47:06</p>
<p>Now, Sophia was like a see Alex supportive.</p>
<p>He was supported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile.</p>
<p>No, he thought it wasn&rsquo;t so feels like he&rsquo;s being supportive.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s trying to literally make us feel like shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a backhanded compliment.</p>
<p>I thought he&rsquo;s leasing.</p>
<p>47:23</p>
<p>I can smell that from all the way outside of the fucking plane K.</p>
<p>So we sit in our seats and our editor was sitting in this seat in front of him, front of us and he turns around, he was like that reeks.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>So this point all my mix feeling very insecure and I are able honorable.</p>
<p>47:44</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t, but I started to kind of freaked out a little bit as well.</p>
<p>The guy next to us also looked a little bit upset and I was like, oh shit.</p>
<p>So I was in the see the window seat and Sophia was in the middle.</p>
<p>So we were like, alright, let&rsquo;s eat this before we take off.</p>
<p>47:59</p>
<p>I was extremely self-conscious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Finally at that point at that point.</p>
<p>I was like, there&rsquo;s a guy sitting in the aisle was like Actually looking at us like yeah like God he was like upset and I was like, how can we somehow like conceal the smell and eat, you know and eat this also because that&rsquo;s not only does it stink.</p>
<p>48:16</p>
<p>But like to just be sitting there like shoving shit down.</p>
<p>Yeah, throw we were dead.</p>
<p>Like I took one of the blankets that they gave out and I put it on the seat in front of Alex and I and attached it to our seats.</p>
<p>48:35</p>
<p>So it really Like a little for yeah, but I saw Alex and I went into our little fort to eat Carl&rsquo;s jr.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, we hear a little top top on the fort and the fucking flight attendant is like girls.</p>
<p>48:54</p>
<p>You cannot have a fort setup.</p>
<p>Whole, we&rsquo;re about to take off.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I need to be able to see your tray.</p>
<p>Tables, Etc, girls.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I was like, am I actually five years old?</p>
<p>I I felt like a child.</p>
<p>So we take the blanket down.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ll wait to eat once we take off.</p>
<p>49:11</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so I&rsquo;m like, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to inconspicuously pretty much sit on Alex&rsquo;s lap and eat this burger.</p>
<p>So close to the window.</p>
<p>The window that like no one even know, Sofia didn&rsquo;t even put down her tray table.</p>
<p>49:26</p>
<p>She knows my tray table and we both just were staring out the window.</p>
<p>Well, shoving it.</p>
<p>I was hunched over and our noses were pretty much touching the air.</p>
<p>Frank render, it looks like he has never been on an aircraft is only look at the dials are first time on an airplane hounding that burger.</p>
<p>49:45</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the story.</p>
<p>Know what happened next.</p>
<p>So embarrassing.</p>
<p>I want to die right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like reliving it right.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>What happened was, is we start to hear some noise, little bit of rumbling.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a little bit of an uproar, having some snarky comment.</p>
<p>50:05</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Of some sort of rude remarks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an uproar.</p>
<p>Literally we heard someone turned to their seat mate and asked them Point Blank.</p>
<p>Do you smell that?</p>
<p>Do you smell that?</p>
<p>50:21</p>
<p>Like imagine Sophia and I straight up huddled over shoving this in our mouth.</p>
<p>And we like quickly turn away.</p>
<p>I start to freak freak.</p>
<p>The fuck.</p>
<p>I am freaking out at this point.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting really felt like I am just like, oh my God, the 80 that made the comment about the smell.</p>
<p>50:39</p>
<p>We hear her call over the flight attendant and you know, when like you see someone talking to someone and then they obviously they look at you.</p>
<p>The flight attendant literally looked over her shoulder to shoulder and made eye contact with Sofia and I and we were like fuck.</p>
<p>I literally snatched Burger out of Alex&rsquo;s hand quicker.</p>
<p>51:01</p>
<p>It was like a ninja situation.</p>
<p>I grabbed all All of our shit, like our fries and ketchup, everything shoved, everything underneath the seat in front of, we knew at that.</p>
<p>Very moment, guys, when the flight attendant made eye contact, we knew it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>51:17</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s gonna come over and say something.</p>
<p>I was mortified, mortify, terrified tariff.</p>

<p>But honestly, in hindsight, the bag itself with like this in agree, it wasn&rsquo;t greasy was.</p>
<p>So finally, the flight attendant comes over and she was so nice and she looks like, not because it was humiliating.</p>
<p>52:04</p>
<p>It was so humiliating.</p>
<p>Eating and she was like, I am so sorry to do this girls, but we had several complaints including from the back of the plane from the back of the fucking plane people.</p>
<p>We were in row a row and she died people from the bag, between where there&rsquo;s like 50 fucking seats.</p>

<p>54:32</p>
<p>We we this we we we That&rsquo;s a gang.</p>
<p>Okay, cut me off.</p>
<p>All right, this is someone actually did DME this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Are you ready?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p>I know a guy who went to Vegas for a bachelor party with his friends.</p>
<p>54:50</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting fucked up with some strippers and things got pretty wild.</p>
<p>This guy ends up fucking one of the strippers in the but raw yikes, right?</p>
<p>We would you ever fuck someone with a condom in there, but I don&rsquo;t know but ever anyways.</p>
<p>Okay, so Oh, the weekend ends and he returns home and continues with his life as though, nothing happened because what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, obviously, well ladies clearly not because three days later.</p>
<p>55:16</p>
<p>His dick is bright red and Burl like a motherfucker.</p>
<p>He goes to the doctor and peas in a cup, but the STD tests come back negative.</p>
<p>Oh my.</p>
<p>So he goes home and tries to continue on with his life.</p>
<p>But by the end of the week his dick is in so much pain.</p>
<p>He literally can&rsquo;t sit still he can&rsquo;t pee any can&rsquo;t function.</p>
<p>55:34</p>
<p>Oh my God, he goes.</p>
<p>Talk to the doctor and they say, the only test left to do is for syphilis.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do it at first because it involves sticking a swab inside the wiener whole, sounds pretty painful.</p>
<p>They stick the swab in and one single jalape√±o.</p>
<p>55:51</p>
<p>Jalape√±o.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d follow out.</p>
<p>How did a jalapeno seed, get in his wiener whole?</p>
<p>You may ask, let&rsquo;s go back to the Vegas stripper that he fucked.</p>
<p>Raw in the ass.</p>
<p>She had eaten something with Jalapenos in it, and there was a seed.</p>
<p>In her but that got stuck in his wiener whole when he fucked her.</p>
<p>56:09</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>What the fuck I am at a complete loss.</p>
<p>For words.</p>
<p>I looking at you like you just shared some shit, dude.</p>
<p>What a fucking.</p>
<p>Jalapao.</p>
<p>How do you say a fucking?</p>
<p>Jalapeno?</p>
<p>Pinot?</p>
<p>Noir?</p>
<p>You feeling me like when people want to do, try anal, like, you gotta okay careful.</p>
<p>56:27</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, yes spice ocean you need to do anal prep before you do anal.</p>
<p>I actually saw one porn star was talking about it and she was like, I don&rsquo;t eat for 12 hours before I had.</p>
<p>No, I only eat like rice and chicken.</p>
<p>56:42</p>
<p>No, beans.</p>
<p>Stay away from fruits and vegetables, Etc.</p>
<p>But fucking jalapenos up in your butthole at it and it got stuck in his wiener hole.</p>
<p>I thought I had heard it.</p>
<p>All.</p>
<p>He is, my God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fucking nightmare.</p>
<p>All right, this girl wrote in help.</p>
<p>Help help SOS.</p>
<p>56:58</p>
<p>I need an immediate response guiding.</p>
<p>Oh, I got tested positive for chlamydia.</p>
<p>This morning.</p>
<p>I have a guilty conscience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s and have to tell the guy been consistently hooking up with what do I say in?</p>
<p>How do I say it?</p>
<p>Please?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m freaking out.</p>
<p>I hope you see this.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s just a dick.</p>
<p>57:15</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a dick but I need him to talk to me again.</p>
<p>What I want to say, that&rsquo;s always kind of about that is another daddy gang member wrote in.</p>
<p>And said there is a website that sends an anonymous text to someone saying they have an STD.</p>
<p>57:33</p>
<p>Yeah, so milk Hunter told me about - I mean, this girl said, she uses it to fuck with guys to see if they will like tell her.</p>
<p>Not.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if you are wanting to tell a guy and you don&rsquo;t want to confront him, I think you can send that.</p>
<p>I also, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that the health department, once you test positive for an STD and you tell them who gave it to the health department reaches out.</p>
<p>57:55</p>
<p>To that person.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just like one of your partners that you&rsquo;ve had in the past.</p>
<p>Like, has this, I think that there, that&rsquo;s the very mature way to go about it.</p>
<p>Now, on the flip.</p>
<p>Upside, if you want, like the other call her daddy advice.</p>
<p>If I were you, if you have any inclination that he has, maybe also been being a little bit here, blame it on him.</p>
<p>58:14</p>
<p>You blame it on him.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re going to do is you&rsquo;re going to be.</p>
<p>Like, I literally just went for my yearly checkup and got a Pap and like, I am.</p>
<p>You have this if you literally like, so Bobby fucked up?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fucked up.</p>
<p>So, do you want to like, like, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you more careful?</p>
<p>Yeah, like that&rsquo;s really fucked up.</p>
<p>58:30</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, um, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I would probably do cookie crumbles.</p>
<p>All Eight.</p>
<p>This is another story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some crazy fucking stories this week.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This is some next-level crazy shit.</p>
<p>A year later after a breakup Annex and I were in the process of getting back together.</p>
<p>58:49</p>
<p>After a night owl I passed out on their bed with a dead phone flash.</p>
<p>Forward to the morning.</p>
<p>I woke up and she wasn&rsquo;t and in bed and neither was my phone.</p>
<p>I make my way to the living room and I get a looking for something as she pulls.</p>
<p>59:05</p>
<p>My phone out from under the couch cushion.</p>
<p>She was sitting on and throws it directly at my face.</p>
<p>The genius charged, the phone remembered, she had fingerprint access that I forgot and never got rid of and went through everything.</p>
<p>59:22</p>
<p>I kid you not, when I looked at my phone.</p>
<p>My lock screen was a collage of screenshots of sex.</p>
<p>I had sent to other girls.</p>
<p>I unlock the phone and my background was Lodge of all the nudes.</p>
<p>I had been 10 and the latest search in Safari was a picture of a middle finger.</p>
<p>59:41</p>
<p>She also messaged all of these nudes and sex to herself.</p>
<p>So she could always be reminded of how much she hates me and how gross I am stayed with her for another two years.</p>
<p>Fucking love the crazy baby.</p>
<p>Oh wave and love it.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>I love the artistic.</p>
<p>59:58</p>
<p>The fact that is a bitch.</p>
<p>Woke up, charged it unlocked it and put collages for the front screen.</p>
<p>The inside screen, you can do creative artists like the fact that that girl&rsquo;s just yeah, sitting on the couch walks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like looking for some cutting out his head.</p>
<p>1:00:16</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love a little drop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve definitely done that with an iPod more and I took him out, dude, that shit.</p>
<p>And then the fact that&rsquo;s what we fucking say, guys.</p>
<p>Love the crazy.</p>
<p>The fact that I don&rsquo;t know where the story is going on, the end to stay with her for another two years.</p>
<p>1:00:33</p>
<p>Fucking love than guys, I meant A full, this is really quick.</p>
<p>Okay, but I just want to address it.</p>
<p>We talked about using invisible ink, it&rsquo;s when you send a text and it&rsquo;s all blurry and you can&rsquo;t see what was written.</p>
<p>You can use this on pictures too.</p>
<p>1:00:49</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, we never told them that.</p>
<p>So you best believe?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re sending a nude.</p>
<p>You should send it with invisible ink, almost always or almost always.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dick and the new right?</p>
<p>And then if you&rsquo;re a guy and you&rsquo;re gonna send a goddamn dick pic and you know that your girlfriend is with her family traveling and Bermuda fucking Invisible ink invisible, that&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>1:01:08</p>
<p>I also think that just better to because it&rsquo;s, it makes it easier.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to just like a nude sitting there all the time public, if you&rsquo;re sending it, like during the day like yeah, I know, fuck that.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>A guy wrote in and said ladies.</p>
<p>I was dating a girl that we had great chemistry was fun and gave some bomb, Gluck Gluck, the problem.</p>
<p>1:01:29</p>
<p>She caked on the makeup.</p>
<p>She would stop by my place during a jog with it.</p>
<p>Layered on spend the night with layers, Etc.</p>
<p>I spent a couple months with her.</p>
<p>Never got to see her real face.</p>
<p>Honestly.</p>
<p>This was one thing that held me back from going further down the road with her.</p>
<p>1:01:46</p>
<p>How do you get a girl to not go overboard?</p>
<p>That is that&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy that the makeup bothered, this guy so much that he liked everything about her.</p>
<p>But like that was the reason he couldn&rsquo;t continue.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ve actually ever said it, but guys, naturally Like Girls when they look more natural, a lot of Thousand.</p>
<p>1:02:06</p>
<p>However, there are all are some guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dated some guys that loved when I would do the whole like Barbie not apparently I would say for the most part you like a natural look.</p>
<p>However, with regard to this girls, we&rsquo;ve got to like kind of like trick them if you really want to wear makeup all the time, less eye makeup, you can layer on makeup and make it look natural.</p>
<p>1:02:26</p>
<p>You can also melt Hunter brought this up to me the other day.</p>
<p>He said guys are kind of oblivious when it does come to Makeup stuff.</p>
<p>But for a guy, it&rsquo;s clear as day.</p>
<p>He said that when I see a girl and her fucking neck, not match her face immediately.</p>
<p>1:02:45</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what guys look at.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh, why does it look like that?</p>
<p>Because listen, at the end of the day, a guy is thinking, what are you going to look like when you wake up next to him?</p>
<p>As sad as it is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being that girl.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not all fucking out here looking like Gigi Hadid without makeup on, but I do think girls.</p>
<p>1:03:01</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about traffic them, trekking up trick that you your He learned everything, but like don&rsquo;t put mascara on maybe one day because I know fucking guys have thought I&rsquo;m not wearing makeup when I have literally full face, but then there&rsquo;s no mascara.</p>
<p>All right, this is the last thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a actually someone I think this is it was a tweet and I just thought this was very interesting.</p>
<p>1:03:19</p>
<p>I wanted to get your opinion on this.</p>
<p>Fun fact.</p>
<p>You can tell if a guy is a liar, if he says he&rsquo;s 511, if he is actually 511, he would round up and say he&rsquo;s 6 foot but since he knows, he can&rsquo;t pass for six foot.</p>
<p>1:03:40</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll choose to say 511.</p>
<p>So to sound taller guys who say they&rsquo;re 511 are always five nine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, this is hitting home.</p>
<p>This is fucking do we didn&rsquo;t you just have some business hitting home?</p>
<p>Cause this guy I&rsquo;m talking to literally said that. 511.</p>
<p>1:03:56</p>
<p>Oh, wow, they round up and it kind of makes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So basically what they&rsquo;re saying is and I get it, I get the rounding up.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re probably most like 9 5, 10, 5, 10.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Little creepers of the night, trying to stop a lot in that is like, very interesting.</p>
<p>1:04:16</p>
<p>I like, how the fuck do I measure this guy without him knowing but like actually look at his license.</p>
<p>No, but I mean they probably lie on their license.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>How do we really?</p>
<p>We got like guys fighting about girls with makeup and like, catfishing up guys are fuck all the show with girls with their height.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>1:04:32</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really crazy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna find out and get to the bottom.</p>
<p>Let you guys.</p>
<p>I have mr.</p>
<p>Specimen in my hands right now.</p>
<p>Is that it?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Daddy gang.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to leave the I don&rsquo;t either, but guys got it.</p>
<p>1:04:48</p>
