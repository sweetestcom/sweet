    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>When we made the discovery about the Parson family,</p>
<p>it made us question everything Nelson had told us so far.</p>
<p>And again, Lemon and Parson are pseudonyms</p>
<p>because these guys have never publicly been named suspects by law enforcement.</p>
<p>So to see if this was just some kind of huge mix-up,</p>
<p>we first reached out to a former employee of Nelson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who Emily had interviewed prior.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s actually the one who was assigned to be the liaison</p>
<p>between Nelson and Kristen when their relationship deteriorated,</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s very familiar with the Hulse case.</p>
<p>She was also someone who told us that buried bus property was Daryl Lemon&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So we fired off a quick text just asking for clarity,</p>
<p>and she texted back right away and was like,</p>
<p>Oh, I misspoke. That&rsquo;s the Parsons.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So I threw together a Parson family tree</p>
<p>and realized that most of the four Parson boys were dead,</p>
<p>and none of them were all that old when they died.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, only one of them was still alive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call him Mike.</p>
<p>The others we&rsquo;ll call Jay, Jacob, and Daryl.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not calling Daryl Parson the same name as Daryl Lemon</p>
<p>just to confuse you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing it because they really have the same first name,</p>
<p>which might be why Nelson and his staff have confused them for so long.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not really an excusable mistake in a homicide investigation,</p>
<p>but I thought the context was important to add.</p>
<p>Now, the brothers who had died were too old in their obit photos</p>
<p>to see if they met the description of Darlene&rsquo;s killer,</p>
<p>so we headed to the historical archive in Plymouth</p>
<p>to dig through old yearbooks.</p>
<p>And there were two brothers that stood out to us.</p>
<p>Emily.</p>
<p>That nose even back then.</p>
<p>This is episode 13,</p>
<p>Untangling Misinformation.</p>
<p>While Emily was trying to track down Nelson again</p>
<p>to confront him about the discrepancy between the Lemon and the Parson families,</p>
<p>I went back through all our materials</p>
<p>to see if any of the Parson sons showed up in any reports</p>
<p>because so far, no one had brought them up to us.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t it amazing what a little context can provide?</p>
<p>A couple of names on a prosecutor&rsquo;s whiteboard</p>
<p>suddenly gave a whole new meaning to things that I had looked at a hundred times.</p>
<p>Tips and reports from the very first days of the investigation</p>
<p>that seemed to be investigative dead ends</p>
<p>were now our best lead.</p>
<p>And so, once again,</p>
<p>we had to start back at the beginning.</p>
<p>On August 18, the day Darlene&rsquo;s body was found,</p>
<p>a local mail carrier called police and said</p>
<p>the suspect might be Jay Parson of Kenilworth Road.</p>
<p>She said about two weeks before Darlene&rsquo;s abduction,</p>
<p>she saw a light-colored car by the Hulse house.</p>
<p>At the time, she didn&rsquo;t pay it much attention</p>
<p>because she thought that they were probably just picking marijuana</p>
<p>out of a field nearby.</p>
<p>And for context about the marijuana crops,</p>
<p>we did find old police reports</p>
<p>where an ISP trooper with a plane had been doing flyovers</p>
<p>and investigating a field right behind the Hulse home.</p>
<p>Now, the Hulses were in no way involved with this.</p>
<p>Their house just happened to be close by.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Parsons were thought to be involved in that grow patch.</p>
<p>That same day, August 18, a different tipster called</p>
<p>to say that the suspect&rsquo;s sketch in the newspaper</p>
<p>looked like Mike Parson.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all the tip says.</p>
<p>Then the next day, August 19, another woman called police</p>
<p>and said she also thought the suspect might be Jay Parson.</p>
<p>The woman said she saw him, quote,</p>
<p>drive by her house two weeks ago,</p>
<p>driving a dark green over dark top midsize car.</p>
<p>She lives 20B west of Old 31 Southside, end quote.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s a little tough to translate these.</p>
<p>Does she mean that she saw Jay driving a green car by her house</p>
<p>or by Darlene&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Some of these handwritten tips and notes just leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Now, two days later, on August 21, police got a call at 2 a.m.</p>
<p>about a person hiding in a cornfield at State Road 110 and Highway 31.</p>
<p>An officer went out to check the area and didn&rsquo;t find anybody.</p>
<p>Then 15 minutes later, police got another complaint,</p>
<p>this time about a guy who ran off the edge of the road in the same area</p>
<p>and, quote, unquote, hidden a culvert.</p>
<p>So this is written on a police follow-up sheet,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s confusing.</p>
<p>At the top of the paper, someone wrote Daryl Parson,</p>
<p>not to be confused again with Daryl Lemon.</p>
<p>But then at the bottom of the sheet, the officer wrote that, quote,</p>
<p>subject was located and arrested for 1056, end quote.</p>
<p>In Indiana, 1056 means intoxicated person.</p>
<p>The guy told arresting officers that he had just hitchhiked</p>
<p>and that was the end of the report.</p>
<p>So our question was, is it Daryl Parson who is being arrested in the incident</p>
<p>or is it Daryl Parson who&rsquo;s the one calling in the incident?</p>
<p>Emily put in a records request for Daryl Parson&rsquo;s criminal history in Marshall County</p>
<p>and there was a public intoxication arrest on his record,</p>
<p>but it was in 2008, not 1984.</p>
<p>Daryl also had a domestic battery charge on his record, also from 2008.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s Daryl who was blonde with a long nose</p>
<p>that fits the physical description for Darlene&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>But what did police do with these tips?</p>
<p>Well, it seems like they did look into them because on August 21st,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a follow-up sheet with an alibi that got called in for Daryl Parson.</p>
<p>Someone said that he couldn&rsquo;t have killed Darlene because he wasn&rsquo;t even in Argus.</p>
<p>He was in Boone County, Indiana that morning,</p>
<p>filling out a job application at 9 a.m. and he was there for an hour.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s worth noting that Jacob Parson</p>
<p>is never mentioned in any of the reports that we have.</p>
<p>But what about Mike and Jay?</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find much else about Mike right off the bat,</p>
<p>but Jay was interviewed by police.</p>
<p>And Jay is really the one I find myself having the most questions about,</p>
<p>mostly because of the stuff that we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>and how it ties back to the FBI&rsquo;s profile.</p>
<p>He would have been 30 years old in 1984</p>
<p>and he lived in Argus all his life on the property with the buried bus,</p>
<p>really close to Darlene.</p>
<p>His obituary said that he graduated high school in 1974,</p>
<p>though we couldn&rsquo;t find him pictured</p>
<p>or even listed in the graduating class of that yearbook.</p>
<p>We also couldn&rsquo;t find any records showing that he ever got married or had any kids.</p>
<p>And he, too, has a long, flat nose,</p>
<p>just less pronounced than his brother Daryl&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Oh, and get this.</p>
<p>In a weird turn of events,</p>
<p>looking into Jay Parson truly did bring us right back to the beginning</p>
<p>because I found out that he ran with Danny Bender.</p>
<p>Remember him?</p>
<p>The very first suspect in Darlene&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>And we know this because there are some old reports</p>
<p>from a few of Danny&rsquo;s friends that mentioned Jay being with Danny,</p>
<p>like riding their bikes around town and partying together and stuff.</p>
<p>The Marshall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office gave Jay a polygraph exam on September 5, 1984,</p>
<p>but it seemed more centered around Jay&rsquo;s friendship with Danny</p>
<p>than Jay&rsquo;s possible involvement.</p>
<p>In the pretest, the subject gave the following information and admissions.</p>
<p>The subject stated he knew why he was there, reference,</p>
<p>he was there to help this department out in any way he could.</p>
<p>He advised that he knows Danny Bender,</p>
<p>and because of him knowing Danny Bender, he feels that he may be able to help.</p>
<p>The subject advised that he thought Danny Bender had streaks in his hair</p>
<p>and was light-complected.</p>
<p>He advised that the last time he saw Danny Bender was on July 28, 1984,</p>
<p>which would have been the subject&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>He advised that his brother had driven him over there</p>
<p>and that his brother owns a purple Chevrolet.</p>
<p>He advised that he had a couple of beers at Danny&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and the other person was Jackie, who is Danny&rsquo;s girlfriend and her five kids.</p>
<p>He advised that he was there for approximately one half hour.</p>
<p>He advised that the day of the homicide he was at home</p>
<p>and that he has slept out in his car, which he keeps buried in the garden.</p>
<p>He advised that he got up around 8.30 a.m.,</p>
<p>at which time his father told him that they were looking for three convicts that had gotten loose.</p>
<p>He advised that he was home all day working in the garden</p>
<p>and observed the helicopter that went over his house in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The subject advised that he does not know the Hulse family before the homicide</p>
<p>and after seeing the woman&rsquo;s picture on TV,</p>
<p>he remembers seeing her at the laundromat in Argus sometime before.</p>
<p>The subject was given two tests.</p>
<p>His polygrams did not contain specific reactions to relevant questions,</p>
<p>indicative no attempt at deception.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>After careful analysis of this subject&rsquo;s polygrams,</p>
<p>it is the opinion of the examiner that he told substantially the truth during his examination.</p>
<p>It seems like this was the end of investigators looking into Jay,</p>
<p>which is weird because I was left with a lot of questions.</p>
<p>I mean, they didn&rsquo;t even have any follow-up questions about him sleeping in a buried bus underground.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>The other thing that stood out is this whole thing about his dad waking him up</p>
<p>and immediately mentioning something about three convicts on the loose.</p>
<p>What is he talking about?</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find anything about another manhunt going on that day in Argus.</p>
<p>So maybe Jay&rsquo;s dad was conflating what he&rsquo;d heard regarding Darlene&rsquo;s abduction?</p>
<p>I mean, were there rumors going around that three men were involved?</p>
<p>The other thing that doesn&rsquo;t make sense is Jay said he recognized Darlene&rsquo;s photo on TV</p>
<p>because he had seen her at a laundromat in Argus.</p>
<p>But Ron Hulse told police that they had a washer and dryer at home</p>
<p>and all of their laundry was done there.</p>
<p>He was insistent.</p>
<p>Darlene never went to the laundromat.</p>
<p>There is no more mention of any of the Parson brothers or their family that we have been able to find yet.</p>
<p>So the question is, why is their whole family listed on that whiteboard?</p>
<p>When Emily tried to track Nelson down again to see if he was confused or if he&rsquo;d lied to us,</p>
<p>this is what he texted her.</p>
<p>Quote,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in something deep.</p>
<p>I trust you have a sense of how many demands are put on my time.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>But the next day when we followed up,</p>
<p>Nelson agreed to meet Emily over his lunch hour at the Martin&rsquo;s Supermarket salad bar.</p>
<p>The audio isn&rsquo;t great because the store is loud with people talking and top 40 radio.</p>
<p>But when they sat down, Emily asked about the Lemon-Parson discrepancy</p>
<p>and Nelson just brushed it off as a simple mix-up.</p>
<p>Basically, no big deal.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>Maybe he was confused only when talking to us.</p>
<p>But again, why are the Parsons even relevant?</p>
<p>I cannot go into that, you know?</p>
<p>I cannot.</p>
<p>How does it apply?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot, a long line of detectives that have all done that kind of work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know what my role is.</p>
<p>No, I do.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re the only one I&rsquo;m given access to for this.</p>
<p>None of the detectives will talk to me.</p>
<p>They probably won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on their shit list.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you from listening to all of that supermarket audio.</p>
<p>But basically, Nelson admits our findings are correct,</p>
<p>that Daryl Lemon was at the Burgers that summer</p>
<p>and the Parson family are the ones who live near Darlene with the buried bus in their yard.</p>
<p>He said the Parsons have only ever been considered persons of interest in Brandy Pelz&rsquo;s case, not Darlene&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Emily asked if the Parsons were still on police&rsquo;s radar for either case.</p>
<p>And Nelson said no.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I know what you&rsquo;re wondering.</p>
<p>Why is their family tree on the conference room whiteboard at the prosecutor&rsquo;s office?</p>
<p>Nelson said he wrote it up there a long time ago because he was getting confused</p>
<p>and that he also put the paper over the family tree because it&rsquo;s quote unquote nobody&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>And no one in his office has taken an interest in Brandy or Darlene&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>So it shouldn&rsquo;t just be on display every day for unrelated meetings.</p>
<p>I also had Emily ask Nelson if they&rsquo;d considered doing any genealogy testing</p>
<p>regarding the Parson family for either case.</p>
<p>And he said, quote, I suppose if there was convincing evidence to move forward on that path, end quote.</p>
<p>But then I still wonder how the Parsons got up there.</p>
<p>Were they considered for Brandy Pelz&rsquo;s case?</p>
<p>And if so, why, when none of them seemed to have violent criminal records,</p>
<p>save for Daryl&rsquo;s domestic violence charge?</p>
<p>Maybe it was because they were being investigated for involvement with that marijuana field.</p>
<p>The weed patch was just north of the Hulse home, which was also in the direction of the Pelz house.</p>
<p>But that seems like a stretch.</p>
<p>Maybe a bunch of tips came in about them after Brandy&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say.</p>
<p>We messaged Daryl&rsquo;s victim from his 2008 arrest on Facebook, but never heard back.</p>
<p>And with most of the family deceased,</p>
<p>it was a lot harder to find information about how they connected to the investigations.</p>
<p>We even swung by their old homestead where the bus is allegedly buried,</p>
<p>but no one was home and it was hard to tell if anyone still lived there.</p>
<p>Emily pushed on Nelson and asked him to be a little more specific during that lunch break meetup.</p>
<p>Basically, she wanted him to clarify all of this.</p>
<p>And Nelson said, well, everyone always had their suspicions about Mike</p>
<p>because he had some sort of mental illness.</p>
<p>Nelson didn&rsquo;t know if Mike Parson had been interviewed before</p>
<p>or if he had the ability to be interviewed.</p>
<p>He thought he was in assisted living today.</p>
<p>And Nelson sort of acted like the idea of the Parsons came about in the Pelz case</p>
<p>after law enforcement&rsquo;s other theories just fell apart.</p>
<p>They had a suspect early on in that case, this guy from England who had spent some time in Argus.</p>
<p>But then Nelson said by the time he returned overseas, it was too late to interview him.</p>
<p>I think, I feel like there&rsquo;s more about the **** that you&rsquo;re not telling me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not telling you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you what&rsquo;s in my mind.</p>
<p>Why take the time to like write out their family tree on your whiteboard</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re interested in **** or something?</p>
<p>After that, Nelson said, quote,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t spend any time on it right now.</p>
<p>I got too much shit going on.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>But then he made a mention that there was an effort made recently</p>
<p>where a detective went to a relative&rsquo;s house to try and get more information</p>
<p>about the Parsons&rsquo; involvement in basically just crime in the mid 80s around Argus.</p>
<p>And he said that interaction didn&rsquo;t go well.</p>
<p>They got yelled at and the family they tried talking to wouldn&rsquo;t cooperate.</p>
<p>But again, I ask, what was the motivation behind that house call?</p>
<p>In one breath, Nelson said they aren&rsquo;t looking at them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been ages.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just up there because there&rsquo;s nothing else.</p>
<p>Then he&rsquo;s talking about detectives visiting living family members</p>
<p>to get information on one or more of the brothers.</p>
<p>When we tried to hone in on this, Nelson said,</p>
<p>well, we just knew that they were around.</p>
<p>So an investigator went.</p>
<p>Well, you know that Ken McCube&rsquo;s around.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>Some of these angles you take are like, why the fuck are you doing this?</p>
<p>Why the fuck are you doing that?</p>
<p>Well, no, just help me understand the difference.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m trying to convince you that there is no logical plan here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to exist day to day.</p>
<p>Emily brought up Kenneth McCune Jr.</p>
<p>Because if you remember, at the time we spoke with him,</p>
<p>Kenneth said investigators haven&rsquo;t questioned him about Darlene&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>since he was arrested and sentenced back in like 87, 88.</p>
<p>So you get that something&rsquo;s not adding up, right?</p>
<p>Over the many, many months we&rsquo;ve spent interviewing Nelson,</p>
<p>there were no new efforts made by any law enforcement</p>
<p>to go knocking on suspects&rsquo; doors to try and get DNA swabs or information.</p>
<p>So to hear that someone went, quote unquote, recently</p>
<p>to check in on a relative of the Parson family was surprising.</p>
<p>Was it for pelts or was it for hulse?</p>
<p>Nelson wouldn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>Nelson also said he cannot say one way or another</p>
<p>if Brandy and Darlene&rsquo;s cases are connected.</p>
<p>P.I. Zip, who you heard from last episode,</p>
<p>said he would be shocked if they aren&rsquo;t connected.</p>
<p>But no one can say for sure.</p>
<p>And I keep coming back to something else.</p>
<p>Daryl Lemon, the Parson family, Kenneth McCune Jr.,</p>
<p>all have one thing in common.</p>
<p>They all stayed or lived near Darlene and where her body was found.</p>
<p>And that seems to be the key to the hulse investigation,</p>
<p>at least for Nelson,</p>
<p>which is also in line with what the FBI analysis said.</p>
<p>When Emily and Jake and I were in Marshall County</p>
<p>visiting the crime scenes,</p>
<p>Nelson texted Emily to ask what our reaction was</p>
<p>to seeing the locations, referring to me and Jake.</p>
<p>Emily responded that it was more rural than we had expected.</p>
<p>And Nelson texted back, quote,</p>
<p>and therefore, beyond coincidence, end quote.</p>
<p>By now, I was kind of done trusting that guy.</p>
<p>We decided to go back to the office</p>
<p>and do a hard reset on everything he told us so far.</p>
<p>And not just the stuff he had told us.</p>
<p>We basically set out to double check everything,</p>
<p>including things reported from decades before</p>
<p>that have been the factual building blocks of the investigation,</p>
<p>starting with Darlene&rsquo;s autopsy.</p>
<p>I told you about the autopsy findings way back in episode three</p>
<p>and that her cause of death was listed as blunt trauma</p>
<p>caused by the fireplace poker.</p>
<p>But like everything else in this case,</p>
<p>nothing is what it seems.</p>
<p>She died of strangulation, and then he kept squeezing.</p>
<p>A new cause of death, a new witness interviewed,</p>
<p>and a whole new opinion about what happened to Darlene</p>
<p>moments before her death.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all next in episode 14,</p>
<p>A Massive Revelation.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
