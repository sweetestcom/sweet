<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>good morning everyone and welcome</p>
<p>welcome Karen is back is my phone all</p>
<p>right so we&rsquo;re gonna have it we have a</p>
<p>lot of callers ready to go a lot of</p>
<p>questions we want to dive into as many</p>
<p>of these as possible</p>
<p>anything that we say is not meant to</p>
<p>give you any cure for any coronaviruses</p>
<p>okay so this just may be meant for</p>
<p>information do your research</p>
<p>check with your doctor okay all right</p>
<p>Karen I&rsquo;ll let you start scanning for</p>
<p>these good questions well I&rsquo;m gonna jump</p>
<p>right on to Bob from Florida he had a</p>
<p>question hey Bob are you there dr. Berg</p>
<p>the issue with me is willpower I&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>to two days no problem three days</p>
<p>sometimes and then I buckle like the</p>
<p>other day my wife my daughter said to me</p>
<p>about his sandwich for chicken sandwich</p>
<p>from chick-fil-a so great great that was</p>
<p>the end of my third day right right</p>
<p>I told so it&rsquo;s a couple of days like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fine</p>
<p>but I want to get to 7 to 10 yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>powerful let me just give you my two</p>
<p>cents on that okay Bob yep you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>to practice something called carb</p>
<p>distancing have you heard about that</p>
<p>well yeah and then when you were that</p>
<p>some you were that whether you wear a</p>
<p>mask you wear the mask to avoid the</p>
<p>particles of the carbohydrate going into</p>
<p>your sinuses so you you don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>aroma but I think that I think the</p>
<p>problem too is like when you&rsquo;re by</p>
<p>yourself it&rsquo;s easier with other people</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re not on the program</p>
<p>and you know some people are quarantine</p>
<p>all day well I think everyone is so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a situation where you got to stay really</p>
<p>really busy I think I would make up get</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s agreement on this in the</p>
<p>household like okay no junk in the house</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t bring it in we have to have an</p>
<p>agreement because as soon as it goes in</p>
<p>there boom you take it you take the junk</p>
<p>food what happens is like now we have a</p>
<p>situation where a blood</p>
<p>are elevated a little bit insulin comes</p>
<p>in pushes them down and now you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>be craving and you&rsquo;re gonna want it so</p>
<p>now we have to kind of pull you out of</p>
<p>that situation</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s no such thing as um</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re coming off the sugar like a</p>
<p>sugar detox with symptoms it&rsquo;s not what</p>
<p>happens you&rsquo;re not detoxifying sugar</p>
<p>your your blood Sugar&rsquo;s are just low and</p>
<p>because your brain can&rsquo;t store sugar it</p>
<p>has to get it from your stored sugar in</p>
<p>your liver what happens is your your</p>
<p>brain starts to crave carbs and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really really hard once you have a blood</p>
<p>sugar to keep your resistance your</p>
<p>social your carb distancing so what</p>
<p>happens is then you may have possibly</p>
<p>side effects of brain fog or stress or</p>
<p>depression or anxiety or irritable miss</p>
<p>all these things that come with low</p>
<p>blood blood blood sugar so then you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>it makes it hard and harder so the thing</p>
<p>is once you start going back on keto or</p>
<p>fasting it does take more than a minute</p>
<p>to get back to adapt your body it could</p>
<p>take two and a half days but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing fasting it should be a lot faster</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s happening in this transition</p>
<p>is your body is grabbing ketones from</p>
<p>the fat and then using that as fuel one</p>
<p>thing I think would help you Bob is to</p>
<p>is to take some MCT oil that way you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get instant ketones you start feeling</p>
<p>better you won&rsquo;t go through those</p>
<p>symptoms very much it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>transitional thing but I think the most</p>
<p>important thing is instead of trying to</p>
<p>resist it get everyone&rsquo;s agreement that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to bring it in the</p>
<p>house and not to definitely like don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even give me an option of would you like</p>
<p>chick-fil-a today Bob thanks for your</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>a treaty he said something about treaty</p>
<p>oil MCT oil MCT oil it stands for medium</p>
<p>chain triglycerides okay there&rsquo;s an oil</p>
<p>you can get take a teaspoon a couple</p>
<p>times a day and turns right into ketones</p>
<p>and then your brain will be happy gives</p>
<p>you more endurance it&rsquo;s also anti Mike</p>
<p>Romeo so it&rsquo;s a good for the immune</p>
<p>system interesting coca it&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>coconuts now Sanders from California&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on the line are you there hi dr. Burke I</p>
<p>like you from Canada Oh what part how</p>
<p>much area turn okay great hey and my</p>
<p>question is I&rsquo;m on em who stands for</p>
<p>your advice and penology give us so my</p>
<p>question is I&rsquo;m doing a tourniquet</p>
<p>fasting and I&rsquo;m not on any keto diet but</p>
<p>the issues I&rsquo;m having Carol and I know</p>
<p>that you wash your videos to take like</p>
<p>vitamin B and biotin every day but I</p>
<p>take it as a supplement and what I do I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see any change in my okay so what</p>
<p>is the best way to increase my hair goal</p>
<p>so are you taking any trace minerals I</p>
<p>eat like psycho like I know the shelled</p>
<p>Joseph thanks</p>
<p>yeah like mussels and scallops okay even</p>
<p>prom so I do that I don&rsquo;t know not only</p>
<p>every weekly basis but like bi-weekly</p>
<p>like once or twice like a weekly average</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for example you&rsquo;re taking all</p>
<p>the right nutrients Sanders and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking the trace minerals the B vitamins</p>
<p>okay and and you&rsquo;re still not achieving</p>
<p>this now I know you did mention you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not doing keto of course I would</p>
<p>implement that for sure because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what you&rsquo;re eating that that could</p>
<p>be carbs but here&rsquo;s the other thing</p>
<p>especially in men there&rsquo;s another thing</p>
<p>going on where you have too much</p>
<p>something called DHT which is a very</p>
<p>powerful form of testosterone and that</p>
<p>can actually affect your hair growth in</p>
<p>which case the one of the best things I</p>
<p>recommend for that is stinging nettle</p>
<p>root stinging nettle root it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>remedy to counter that to help</p>
<p>balance this very powerful form of</p>
<p>testosterone that could actually inhibit</p>
<p>hair loss Oh</p>
<p>so those are some things that I would I</p>
<p>would recommend right off the bat</p>
<p>thanks Andrews all right Karen tell us</p>
<p>what what we have on social media media</p>
<p>okay good well Ruth on Facebook wants to</p>
<p>know she&rsquo;s doing seven or ten cups and</p>
<p>veggies a day how much salt one teaspoon</p>
<p>a day of sea salt food through the food</p>
<p>for the day any way you can get it in</p>
<p>yeah all right now Nina had a cool</p>
<p>question she&rsquo;s on YouTube and she wants</p>
<p>to know when you burn fat where does it</p>
<p>go you use it as energy so basically you</p>
<p>use it as energy and to run the body you</p>
<p>have a lot of different things happening</p>
<p>you got all these different you got the</p>
<p>heart you know different the brain where</p>
<p>brain actually requires a lot of energy</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s not just to give you energy</p>
<p>its to run the body that&rsquo;s what you use</p>
<p>it for burns up gives you energy and it</p>
<p>with this this energy that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>converted from ketones it goes through</p>
<p>the energy factory and then it it has to</p>
<p>be converted into the currency that the</p>
<p>body can use and that&rsquo;s ATP so so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s doing it&rsquo;s not directly</p>
<p>an energy but and then you have that</p>
<p>sitting there for whatever you want to</p>
<p>use it for okay</p>
<p>so you get a name here YouTube also</p>
<p>wants to know what are your thoughts on</p>
<p>Ramadan fasting I think it&rsquo;s awesome and</p>
<p>I think what I like about is that it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good amount of fast and you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>for 29 to 30 days and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>benefits the only thing I would have</p>
<p>mentioned is I think from my</p>
<p>understanding there&rsquo;s not a requirement</p>
<p>to do keto when you&rsquo;re eating so if you</p>
<p>were to combine keto with Ramadan type 2</p>
<p>fasting I think it&rsquo;s going to be even</p>
<p>better yeah okay and then one more here</p>
<p>on YouTube</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Carol Anne she&rsquo;s bummed out</p>
<p>she did keto not sure what kind but she</p>
<p>did keto for eight weeks and she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>lose any weight yeah I think never heard</p>
<p>that before I never heard that before</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just gonna take a well guess</p>
<p>probably you want to also do several</p>
<p>other things with it you want to make</p>
<p>sure doing fasting and for example if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re focused on weight loss that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great but it&rsquo;s all about getting healthy</p>
<p>first so if you&rsquo;re getting rid of your</p>
<p>hunger and cravings then we know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working you have to give it more time</p>
<p>but the question is is your waist</p>
<p>shrinking are you doing fasting long</p>
<p>enough if you have a slow metabolism if</p>
<p>you have that problem with your thyroid</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re past the age of 45 you may</p>
<p>have to go to one meal a day or even</p>
<p>longer sometimes but there are other</p>
<p>signs too that your body is beginning to</p>
<p>heal so what would those be energy level</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sharper your mood is better those</p>
<p>are the real big ones also less fluid</p>
<p>retention those are happening it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working if they&rsquo;re not happening then</p>
<p>you need to reevaluate how you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that and reread this book because I</p>
<p>explained how to do it exactly a lot of</p>
<p>times when you go to the internet and</p>
<p>you get bits or pieces of stuff it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you may or may not be getting the</p>
<p>right information I know it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>believe that there could be wrong</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s a brand new way of eating I</p>
<p>think the important thing too is yes to</p>
<p>educate yourself and then commit to it</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have a standard that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>well if I don&rsquo;t lose 10 pounds in the</p>
<p>first two months I quit right because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the point of keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting it&rsquo;s to grow</p>
<p>healthy and if your body is really</p>
<p>strong and healthy it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>carrying around a bunch of extra fat so</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;re doing is either working</p>
<p>and it needs more time or you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>something that is interfering in your</p>
<p>ability to progress but if you are still</p>
<p>carrying that weight around there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more healing to do exactly what</p>
<p>Dusen um</p>
<p>I have a quiz and the first quiz of</p>
<p>today I have two several of these</p>
<p>quizzes quiz questions how much mucus</p>
<p>does your body produce in a given day</p>
<p>gross I think I&rsquo;m not gonna enjoy the</p>
<p>answer to this question so go ahead and</p>
<p>let us know while you&rsquo;re answering the</p>
<p>question let&rsquo;s just talk about mucus</p>
<p>because Steve is interested in this</p>
<p>topic you know I&rsquo;m gonna do a video</p>
<p>today on the amazing benefits of mucus</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually a amazing thing that</p>
<p>we have it has a purpose it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s you want to get rid of</p>
<p>all the time it reminds me of the rat</p>
<p>snakes that&rsquo;s right it everything is a</p>
<p>purple row so you think it&rsquo;s a bad thing</p>
<p>and then you google it and there are</p>
<p>great pets hey you need really trained</p>
<p>and keep you the mice gone yeah yeah</p>
<p>absolutely</p>
<p>okay mucus let&rsquo;s do it so um how much</p>
<p>mucus does your body make do we have the</p>
<p>answers yet but they&rsquo;re still coming in</p>
<p>one and a half liters a day leader a</p>
<p>hundred milliliters lederhosen okay a</p>
<p>leader not a lederhosen now in Germany</p>
<p>you have to convert that four cups yeah</p>
<p>okay okay so Yvonne loves this</p>
<p>wonderful man and I&rsquo;m guessing you mean</p>
<p>him unless you&rsquo;re sitting next to a man</p>
<p>that you love three cups one gallon the</p>
<p>YouTube is all like the American</p>
<p>standards I mean Facebook and then on</p>
<p>YouTube we&rsquo;ve got the milliliters yeah</p>
<p>we want this in liters guys okay one and</p>
<p>a half to 1.7 liters okay so what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>thinking what&rsquo;s your thought on this a</p>
<p>liter that is a lot yeah it is it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a kind of like a is that like a season</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re just like a table at one</p>
<p>liter I&rsquo;m telling on a regular basis Wow</p>
<p>I mean I guess I mean I think I&rsquo;d go</p>
<p>with a liter</p>
<p>people here are Thank You Rita she says</p>
<p>welcome back um wow this guy says two</p>
<p>and a half liters I guess it&rsquo;s up there</p>
<p>these people know and their Facebook is</p>
<p>still on the gallon okay here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>answer the answer is 1 to 1.5 liters and</p>
<p>I know you guys looked it up one to one</p>
<p>and a half liters googling of course</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re one to one and a half liters of</p>
<p>mucus every single day now there must be</p>
<p>a purpose there is a purpose there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually seven purposes in my video</p>
<p>coming up but it&rsquo;s one of the purposes</p>
<p>is a it&rsquo;s like a five trap Fly Trap for</p>
<p>uh for microbes that shouldn&rsquo;t be there</p>
<p>and they kind of can&rsquo;t get through most</p>
<p>of your friendly bacteria live in that</p>
<p>mucus so you have mucus in your nose and</p>
<p>your throat and your mouth all the way</p>
<p>down to your gut and even in the stomach</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t have the mucus layer in</p>
<p>your stomach that acid which is battery</p>
<p>acid would put a hole right through it</p>
<p>so you need this mucus this is very very</p>
<p>important because you don&rsquo;t get rid of</p>
<p>it know when you&rsquo;re not when your nose</p>
<p>is congested congested when you&rsquo;re sick</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not all mucus it&rsquo;s just swollen so</p>
<p>it might feel like it&rsquo;s all so you can</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>below forever it&rsquo;s just not gonna all</p>
<p>come out but the point is that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of important things with mucus that</p>
<p>we will be talking about in the video</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna do today but the teaser</p>
<p>yes so let me just go right to Pam from</p>
<p>Pennsylvania you had a question about</p>
<p>hot flashes Pam are you there yes I am</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited I got through thank you</p>
<p>for taking my call where&rsquo;s welcome I ant</p>
<p>laughs I&rsquo;m new to here so I&rsquo;m not very</p>
<p>good with directions but I&rsquo;m in a little</p>
<p>town called Mifflin burg I just moved</p>
<p>here a few months ago my husband&rsquo;s was</p>
<p>raised here we just moved from Indiana</p>
<p>after 30 years so I worry about in the</p>
<p>center okay awesome yeah kind of in the</p>
<p>center I think okay oh well I&rsquo;m calling</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m calling about my main issue with</p>
<p>hot flashes I&rsquo;ve been doing this for</p>
<p>three years you know and I have all the</p>
<p>entire list of symptoms for estrogen I</p>
<p>think its dominance or adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s so I&rsquo;m just not sure where</p>
<p>to go I&rsquo;ve been suffering with this for</p>
<p>three years tried all kinds of things</p>
<p>you know natural sage wild yam</p>
<p>doctors have tried to set me on</p>
<p>antidepressants I just I just all over</p>
<p>the place and have boxes of supplements</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m watching your videos and I just</p>
<p>kind of want to know where to go you</p>
<p>know come here I&rsquo;ve got the entire lid</p>
<p>so so so a lot of times people when they</p>
<p>actually have hot flashes they um they</p>
<p>take the usual stuff right and it sounds</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve taken usual stuff but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not really working that well it sounds</p>
<p>like you probably took you know you</p>
<p>think you took take progesterone cream</p>
<p>and these other things yeah okay yeah</p>
<p>and then have you also have you have</p>
<p>tried dim before and actually I just</p>
<p>started that</p>
<p>about two weeks ago I just been taking</p>
<p>one a day okay but I don&rsquo;t know that I</p>
<p>really noticed any difference I know it</p>
<p>takes a while for things and I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>so many things I give it like a good</p>
<p>three months yeah and then I kind of</p>
<p>move on but I&rsquo;m just all over the place</p>
<p>right now so I just kind of need to get</p>
<p>focused and I thought you know okay well</p>
<p>the thing that seems to work the best</p>
<p>that I found from just the feedback that</p>
<p>I get is a is a very high quality</p>
<p>vitamin E that includes two corals and</p>
<p>tocotrienols have you ever had that and</p>
<p>the reason why I wanted to just mention</p>
<p>that is because you&rsquo;re obviously either</p>
<p>how old are you like late 40s or 50s or</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m actually 53 okay yeah okay so</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re right in that point where</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is your ovaries just</p>
<p>kind of retired and now you have this</p>
<p>backup adrenal thing going on and then</p>
<p>what happens is the pituitary which</p>
<p>stores a lot of vitamin E as a lot of</p>
<p>receptors it usually is very deficient</p>
<p>in vitamin E and that kind of throws off</p>
<p>the whole pattern of these hormone prom</p>
<p>hormone balance so if you took a high</p>
<p>quality vitamin E and a whole complex I</p>
<p>think that would probably give you the</p>
<p>best help based on what you told me and</p>
<p>it seems to work good it just seems to a</p>
<p>lot of women once they go past 50 they</p>
<p>start really needing more vitamin E for</p>
<p>various reasons there one of the reasons</p>
<p>why women live longer than men is</p>
<p>because they have estrogen but they need</p>
<p>vitamin E to make that so that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>one little angle and then the other</p>
<p>thing would be to support the adrenals</p>
<p>and just forget about like trying to do</p>
<p>anything with estrogen but support your</p>
<p>adrenals there&rsquo;s a great video called</p>
<p>the stress webinar that you can check</p>
<p>out it&rsquo;s a technique that will help</p>
<p>reduce stress in your body so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing that I would I would do</p>
<p>and then if you do all that and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work you can always try iodine</p>
<p>that seems to work as well thanks for</p>
<p>your call Pam all right Karen</p>
<p>where are people calling from oh well I</p>
<p>just started the list of where people</p>
<p>are coming from so I&rsquo;m not gonna do that</p>
<p>just okay fine well all right would you</p>
<p>you have another quiz don&rsquo;t you I do</p>
<p>have another place I have another quiz</p>
<p>okay don&rsquo;t worry all right so here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>next question guys we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>mucus right now we&rsquo;re going to talk</p>
<p>about how large is the surface area of</p>
<p>all your mucus okay so like where it</p>
<p>lays on the inner skin in meters meters</p>
<p>what if you know if you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>meters okay do it in inches whatever how</p>
<p>much surface area does all of your</p>
<p>mucous membranes</p>
<p>cover that&rsquo;s the next question sorry</p>
<p>start okay okay what&rsquo;s your opinion in</p>
<p>eating buckwheat ortf yeah is a type of</p>
<p>wheat I think it&rsquo;s used in different</p>
<p>cultures to make yes yeah so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>yeah even though it&rsquo;s actually higher in</p>
<p>protein it still has gluten it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>than regular wheat but I don&rsquo;t recommend</p>
<p>it because it does it is a grain and it</p>
<p>creates problems it&rsquo;s not going to help</p>
<p>you on keto also any grains in that for</p>
<p>that matter I would avoid them now the</p>
<p>other problem with grains especially</p>
<p>whole grains that you might not realize</p>
<p>is that when you consume especially</p>
<p>whole grains or even wheat or even well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s grains or even like rice or brown</p>
<p>rice you&rsquo;re basically going to deplete</p>
<p>your zinc because of the high amounts of</p>
<p>something called phytates and so here</p>
<p>you are oh I&rsquo;m I saw this documentary</p>
<p>that says I need to be I need to start</p>
<p>eating whole grains because it&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you end up with a</p>
<p>zinc deficiency which is so important</p>
<p>right now with protecting your immune</p>
<p>system which is a whole different topic</p>
<p>but zinc a lot of people are deficient</p>
<p>in zinc and one of the big reasons</p>
<p>especially in different parts of the</p>
<p>world I won&rsquo;t mention any parts of the</p>
<p>world like Indonesia in the</p>
<p>but you have a huge zinc deficiency</p>
<p>there and that&rsquo;s because of the grains</p>
<p>Pakistan very low in zinc because of the</p>
<p>grains Karen okay yes I think the last</p>
<p>time I was here we talked about that</p>
<p>month ago so it&rsquo;s okay but okay good</p>
<p>grains and zinc what do we got what</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see if that first let&rsquo;s see if</p>
<p>Steve knows this question huh what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this what&rsquo;s the surface area of the Lake</p>
<p>Michigan know what&rsquo;s the surface area of</p>
<p>your mucal your mucous membranes</p>
<p>yes what do we got here okay so let me</p>
<p>go down I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m looking at</p>
<p>ten miles</p>
<p>versus 10 miles I like it okay</p>
<p>so more people on YouTube answering a</p>
<p>question I have 60 meters okay 30 meters</p>
<p>2 meters 400 meters 1 meter half a meter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all over the map all right well</p>
<p>what do you think Steve and what do you</p>
<p>think Karen well I think I&rsquo;m ashamed of</p>
<p>humans</p>
<p>no no mucus is your friend ray talk</p>
<p>about the memory not the mucus now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shifting gears oh thank goodness okay 10</p>
<p>meters that&rsquo;s enough 10 meters okay what</p>
<p>you think Karen a meter I&rsquo;m gonna say 75</p>
<p>meters okay it&rsquo;s actually 400 square</p>
<p>meters now let me just tell you yeah I</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>in hey tell me let me just tell you let</p>
<p>me tell you how big that is that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>size of a basketball court or two tennis</p>
<p>courts okay I put together so that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of surface area isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it you know Karen now you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>into some interesting questions but the</p>
<p>point is that it&rsquo;s a very large surface</p>
<p>area and the reason is that going to</p>
<p>think about the job that your your</p>
<p>immune cells have to do to guard that</p>
<p>much space that much you know territory</p>
<p>constantly you have immune cells that</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>making sure full-time 24/7 nothing gets</p>
<p>invaded so more on this soon we talk</p>
<p>about the immune system but that&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of surface area isn&rsquo;t it like what is</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like all your innards think</p>
<p>about the inside of the nose know how</p>
<p>the nose is kind of like curved like</p>
<p>that if you stretch it out it becomes</p>
<p>larger right the same thing with your</p>
<p>your villi on your colon these little</p>
<p>up-and-down type things you stretch it</p>
<p>out it becomes bigger you take the whole</p>
<p>surface area of your gut all the inside</p>
<p>your lungs your son√≠s is your mouth it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very large surface area mucus I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating it is not court yeah</p>
<p>yeah I know you&rsquo;re thinking dinner okay</p>
<p>why you run over by a steamroller that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;d have that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right all that and now I don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>I weigh so much well the body is very</p>
<p>interesting because that much surface</p>
<p>area you&rsquo;re lugging around the thing is</p>
<p>that that you need the surface area to</p>
<p>provide just kind of like in Dubai okay</p>
<p>they have they built these islands and</p>
<p>it looks like these different palms</p>
<p>right so what they did is it created a</p>
<p>lot more surface area so you can have</p>
<p>more beachfront same thing with the body</p>
<p>you create more surface area to create</p>
<p>more protection to create more</p>
<p>functionality okay you just chew on that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go right to Gabriela</p>

<p>these recipes because oh my gosh amazing</p>
<p>stuff so stay tuned for that and then</p>
<p>definitely subscribe to that as well</p>
<p>alright what were you gonna say</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t gonna say anything actually</p>
<p>what I was gonna say is can I have your</p>
<p>pen cuz I dropped my pen oh yeah sure</p>
<p>yeah but here is someone who is on</p>
<p>intermittent fasting hmmm liking it</p>
<p>doing okay except wakes up every night</p>
<p>with headaches mm-hmm that is now that</p>
<p>can happen in the beginning as you</p>
<p>transition but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>for a while that means you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>something that doesn&rsquo;t agree with you it</p>
<p>could be too much cheese it could be</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;re allergic to that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually what&rsquo;s happening the other thing</p>
<p>that happens with intermittent fasting</p>
<p>is you may have higher levels of uric</p>
<p>acid which potentially could create like</p>
<p>an arthritic thing in which case you</p>
<p>just need to add the lemon juice and</p>
<p>maybe some more vegetables and then the</p>
<p>last thing is that you might be</p>
<p>consuming vegetables that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with you certain people have</p>
<p>something called SIBO which is a</p>
<p>digestive thing in which case some of</p>
<p>these vegetables can actually aggravate</p>
<p>arthritis and make you worse so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things that you can you look at I would</p>
<p>look at my videos on ketosis and</p>
<p>side-effects in the digestive system in</p>
<p>relationship to vegetables by the way</p>
<p>doctor we&rsquo;ve got Adrienne on line one</p>
<p>who has that very question so while</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on the topic maybe you could grab</p>
<p>that and reaffirm what you just said</p>
<p>with you so Adrienne since so I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>this topic you had a question about that</p>
<p>go ahead you have headaches basically</p>
<p>I hide yeah how you doing dr. Berg okay</p>
<p>I want to say thank you also for what</p>
<p>you are doing for the community I lost</p>
<p>about 60 pounds in less than three</p>
<p>months Wow that&rsquo;s and sometimes I wake</p>
<p>up with very bad headaches and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually when I do longer like I do</p>
<p>like a lot of 72 hours fast but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how I lost my weight so quick in those</p>
<p>small amount of time I don&rsquo;t know maybe</p>
<p>it could be some sort of nutrients</p>
<p>deficiency or you know I mean who knows</p>
<p>yeah so so I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not related</p>
<p>to anything then because it let&rsquo;s see if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fasting and you have a headache</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit different but I</p>
<p>think I just realized that she asked the</p>
<p>same question with fasting it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be a nutrient nutrient deficiency it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be that and this is one of the</p>
<p>things that I always tell people when</p>
<p>you do fasting especially prolonged</p>
<p>fasting the benefits are huge but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what type of deficiency you</p>
<p>may have simply because it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to get nutrients from our food so I</p>
<p>always recommend to if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>fasting add you know electrolytes the B</p>
<p>vitamins trace minerals as a given and</p>
<p>probably omega-3 fatty acids to make</p>
<p>sure you have them like fish oil</p>
<p>something like that cod liver oil and</p>
<p>that way you&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>deficient in anything so just because we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re deficient the other</p>
<p>thing I would like to met him our bodies</p>
<p>do not store a lot of zinc</p>
<p>they sure stork iron but not zinc so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not consuming zinc on a daily</p>
<p>basis you can be deficient very fast if</p>
<p>your immune system is compromised</p>
<p>whether you have metabolic syndrome and</p>
<p>obesity high blood pressure diabetes all</p>
<p>these things that are risk factors for</p>
<p>that Co at 19 we know your zinc</p>
<p>deficient your body&rsquo;s going to be more</p>
<p>zinc deficient so then getting the</p>
<p>infection is can really deplete you of</p>
<p>zinc and this is why everyone that if</p>
<p>they want to protect your immune system</p>
<p>get NZ</p>
<p>vitamin D as the two things that are</p>
<p>most important I&rsquo;m gonna be doing a</p>
<p>video today talking about a study that</p>
<p>was done in Indonesia which is</p>
<p>mind-blowing they did this on the Cova</p>
<p>19 they looked at the relationship</p>
<p>between people that had normal amounts</p>
<p>of vitamin D insufficiency which is a</p>
<p>slight deficiency and then deficiency of</p>
<p>vitamin D and the mortality rates not</p>
<p>just severity of symptoms but the death</p>
<p>rate was so significantly connected to</p>
<p>people that don&rsquo;t have vitamin D because</p>
<p>the reason why people are dying is</p>
<p>because of the the cytokine the</p>
<p>inflammation in the the lungs which</p>
<p>cause all sorts of issues vitamin D puts</p>
<p>that out it&rsquo;s like the water that puts</p>
<p>out the flame so it&rsquo;s like but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really hear that on the news like no</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s using vitamin D and these trials</p>
<p>so I will release the study if you know</p>
<p>someone that is in the hospital whatever</p>
<p>get them on vitamin D and zinc of course</p>
<p>alright so um I think that&rsquo;s all I had</p>
<p>to say today the end just kidding</p>
<p>yeah do you&rsquo;ve another call yes we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to Jenn from Ohio Jen are you</p>
<p>there I think your husband has some</p>
<p>trouble sleeping is that true yeah hi I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t believe I got through to you I</p>
<p>need first grade and as you all know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>teaching virtually from home so I was</p>
<p>able to get on the call usually I have</p>
<p>you know nineteen first graders in the</p>
<p>class Wow I&rsquo;m yeah yeah so we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing for one and a half years we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>both been doing interment interment</p>
<p>fasting and kido and we&rsquo;re mostly two</p>
<p>meals a day now but my husband has he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I feel so bad he doesn&rsquo;t want it he</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t go to a doctor he only watches</p>
<p>your videos and a couple others and I</p>
<p>mean I don&rsquo;t blame him for not going but</p>
<p>he has terrible like he&rsquo;ll sleep fine</p>
<p>for days and then all the sudden he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be stressed and then he can&rsquo;t sleep</p>
<p>he isn&rsquo;t sure what it is but he thinks</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s taken your adrenal stress he</p>
<p>takes two a day like one at breakfast</p>
<p>like when when he eats he takes one at</p>
<p>breakfast and one at dinner and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know he gets all revved up he gets</p>
<p>really hot he can hit his his ears can</p>
<p>hear everything like somebody makes a</p>
<p>sneeze or something really quiet you can</p>
<p>hear it and you can&rsquo;t sleep I got so</p>
<p>questions I okay is it is it getting to</p>
<p>sleep or staying asleep it&rsquo;s getting to</p>
<p>sleep yeah okay does he have my sleep</p>
<p>aid just out of curiosity you mean the</p>
<p>little thing that we lay on and we did</p>
<p>have it I think we ran out okay okay</p>
<p>well let me just kind of give you a</p>
<p>couple things on it sounds like you also</p>
<p>have that device that to massage device</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using it to yes okay yeah</p>
<p>listen I totally understand about the</p>
<p>sleep thing that can come and go there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all sorts of things that can trigger</p>
<p>stress and he&rsquo;s also doing the</p>
<p>acupressure which is a definite thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help sleep aid</p>
<p>tends to help people go to sleep right</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some other things that you</p>
<p>can do as well</p>
<p>calcium lactate before bed seems to be a</p>
<p>real good one I don&rsquo;t take that often</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m kind of like last</p>
<p>night for example I watched some action</p>
<p>movie which I probably shouldn&rsquo;t watch</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like all wired with</p>
<p>adrenaline because that&rsquo;s it sounds like</p>
<p>he has Adrenaline&rsquo;s a little bit too</p>
<p>high there&rsquo;s a couple things that you</p>
<p>can do you can get one of those</p>
<p>diffusers there&rsquo;s ionized diffusers okay</p>
<p>in your room get the one where you can</p>
<p>turn the light off because the darn</p>
<p>light will wake you up</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going different colors all</p>
<p>night but you put some water in there</p>
<p>and it diffuses you could put essential</p>
<p>oils and there&rsquo;s some a video I did on</p>
<p>forest bathing bathing in the forest</p>
<p>you go on the woods no it&rsquo;s not I can</p>
<p>just do this now I can see Steve like</p>
<p>see what do you where are you in the</p>
<p>forest like no please no what I mean now</p>
<p>I do not want to see a baby on the</p>
<p>forest trust me you know this is a very</p>
<p>interesting that the Japanese did it</p>
<p>been doing this and they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>experiments and you basically walk walk</p>
<p>through the forest in the pine trees and</p>
<p>you actually that the punchy&rsquo;s give off</p>
<p>and certain other spruce trees give off</p>
<p>this this essential oil which increases</p>
<p>your immune system big time the killer T</p>
<p>cells so you can fight viruses but it</p>
<p>will also they found it will decrease</p>
<p>adrenaline and cortisol and I found it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually it seems to be working pretty</p>
<p>good so when we sleep with our window</p>
<p>open so we get some air but we have this</p>
<p>diffuser going off and you can buy this</p>
<p>little bit of pine oil and just put a</p>
<p>couple drops in there and it will</p>
<p>decrease adrenaline and cortisol and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve even done experiments where you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to necessarily go in the</p>
<p>woods you can just do it in your house</p>
<p>or whatever and get this little diffuser</p>
<p>and push that out so but watch my video</p>
<p>on the forest bathing Steve so you can</p>
<p>get more information</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>just walking gets alive just walk and</p>
<p>Jen one that&rsquo;s saying one of the most</p>
<p>important things I think for everyone to</p>
<p>do especially if you&rsquo;re locked up in the</p>
<p>house all day long is you need to go out</p>
<p>on a walk every single day for at least</p>
<p>45 to 60 minutes that I know the days</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s raining and I don&rsquo;t go walking</p>
<p>I just do not sleep that well so the</p>
<p>walking is really key for that thanks</p>
<p>for your call Jen alright Karen do you</p>
<p>have a question sure Arun has belching</p>
<p>having done come on in kita and now has</p>
<p>a metallic taste on this tongue</p>
<p>gallbladder gallbladder gallbladder</p>
<p>gallbladder and so I would recommend</p>
<p>cutting down in any extra fats that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing and then maybe increasing</p>
<p>more of the opposite foods that are from</p>
<p>fat like vegetables and keep that going</p>
<p>and you can also take a gallbladder</p>
<p>formula with heads which has purified</p>
<p>bile salts and even choline which is</p>
<p>actually in our formula and that will</p>
<p>actually help you take one after a meal</p>
<p>and it helps bloating like the inability</p>
<p>to digest fat so you list digest fat a</p>
<p>lot better belching burping and bloating</p>
<p>are all symptoms take this mid mid film</p>
<p>live show moment to once again say for</p>
<p>anybody who&rsquo;s just joining us that</p>
<p>anything we say is not meant too much to</p>
<p>have a diagnosis or any type of</p>
<p>treatment for any diseases right or cure</p>
<p>anything but you know also can we need</p>
<p>to tell people that were actually we</p>
<p>normally do our yearly summative cake</p>
<p>eat of Summit right we are doing a</p>
<p>virtual summit what that means is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be doing it delivered to</p>
<p>the privacy of your own home so we&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>able to you&rsquo;ll sit and watch us with</p>
<p>this all these great speakers everyone</p>
<p>at work our website you can actually I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s even on there&rsquo;s a link right</p>
<p>on YouTube channel itself you can check</p>
<p>it out and I hope you make it it&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>the end of August and we&rsquo;re gonna we</p>
<p>have some amazing speakers so I hope you</p>
<p>can attend it&rsquo;s obviously much less</p>
<p>expensive because it&rsquo;s remote so we want</p>
<p>to make it affordable for everyone to be</p>
<p>there so you should have all of you but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very very robust all</p>
<p>the speakers I think you know the</p>
<p>experience may even be a little more</p>
<p>immersive for people because you know</p>
<p>right there and the comfort your home</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have give everybody breaks</p>
<p>to as we go live with this thing so you</p>
<p>know all the comforts of a real</p>
<p>sumit but safely from your home and you</p>
<p>know just tremendous amount of</p>
<p>information I&rsquo;m really excited to help</p>
<p>in a production yeah yeah it&rsquo;s just kind</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s like you know already know most</p>
<p>of you had great success with keto but</p>
<p>you know you want to strengthen</p>
<p>successful actions if something works</p>
<p>you want to know more about it this will</p>
<p>give you the opportunity to learn all</p>
<p>the latest information and and just have</p>
<p>more knowledge on that and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about having more knowledge so you can</p>
<p>actually be healthier so you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your long-term insurance your health</p>
<p>insurance that you should look at</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re now getting that information</p>
<p>yourself instead of depending on someone</p>
<p>else to give it to you right Karen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right and then I would also say</p>
<p>that for people who don&rsquo;t know it your</p>
<p>basic text on the subject is this book</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this one right here I have</p>
<p>everything in there but this one right</p>
<p>here is that kind of a short summary of</p>
<p>the other cliff notes you can get</p>
<p>through this in about an hour and a half</p>
<p>it has a lot of pictures but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good book a lot of great positive</p>
<p>reviews I think on Kindle we have like a</p>
<p>four point nine average four point nine</p>
<p>star average course only have one review</p>
<p>but still now there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s several</p>
<p>hundred and and it&rsquo;s yes I&rsquo;m not put a</p>
<p>lot of time into it so I hope you guys</p>
<p>appreciate it right so you get the</p>
<p>information there and then also know</p>
<p>that the YouTube channel is as how many</p>
<p>how many videos now I think we have like</p>
<p>30 30 30 40 times five five thousand</p>
<p>five thousand videos this man has done</p>
<p>to educate you and answer your questions</p>
<p>you can find them much easier if you go</p>
<p>to dr. Berg yes and this is what I want</p>
<p>to bring something up about that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very very weird what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>probably this happened in October I</p>
<p>noticed it&rsquo;s becoming very difficult to</p>
<p>find information on YouTube that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for even my videos I&rsquo;m like you</p>
<p>you you can type dr. Berg in this</p>
<p>specific video and you can&rsquo;t even find</p>
<p>it I&rsquo;m like what happened I used to rank</p>
<p>a lot better so you just go to dr. Berg</p>
<p>calm we have a really good blog page and</p>
<p>it has all of the videos classified easy</p>
<p>to find you can search it by</p>
<p>organ and by symptom by in addition to</p>
<p>that we do have a app that you can get</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dr. Berg app and you could look</p>
<p>that up it&rsquo;s a free app and that has all</p>
<p>the videos as well and it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>about to release a voice-activated so</p>
<p>you can just go give me this video and</p>
<p>just say it and it just will play it</p>
<p>just say mucus what&rsquo;s that mucus yeah</p>
<p>and you can even ask me questions and I</p>
<p>will basically be there to answer every</p>
<p>single question you have I just run it</p>
<p>24/7 and I&rsquo;m just like so you hear my</p>
<p>voice yeah yeah so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>tools there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to get the</p>
<p>information to continue educating</p>
<p>yourself and the summit is just another</p>
<p>really unique way bringing in medical</p>
<p>doctors and other health care</p>
<p>professionals and scientists and some</p>
<p>surprised speakers on that note let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to Paris from California not actually in</p>
<p>Paris but that&rsquo;s your day in Paris are</p>
<p>you there hi Paris great I have a</p>
<p>question so last year I was experience</p>
<p>like high blood pressure I was like Demi</p>
<p>live not unhealthy like I called out</p>
<p>elect a lot of alcohol and junk food and</p>
<p>I essentially went vegan and that lasted</p>
<p>until like the holidays and I gained the</p>
<p>weight back and I&rsquo;m looking into uh you</p>
<p>know in everything um but what I noticed</p>
<p>on my weight gain I&rsquo;m like it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>yo-yo diet in the sense of like my</p>
<p>weight loss but I&rsquo;m like focusing on</p>
<p>like amazing looks like body fat for my</p>
<p>my chest like my breast area I won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to go in to a breast reduction so I</p>
<p>won no ketogenic diet will help with</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>yeah so are you trying to do it being a</p>
<p>vegan or are you willing to add some</p>
<p>other things to it I&rsquo;m going to add okay</p>
<p>good yeah I think it might be a good</p>
<p>idea to try the keto because it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>helped quite a few people in fact I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>being very sarcastic now you definitely</p>
<p>need to do this it&rsquo;s going to help your</p>
<p>health it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s not just a fad it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a it&rsquo;s a new trend more and more people</p>
<p>are doing it you&rsquo;re going to find out</p>
<p>this is going to work for you so start</p>
<p>watching the videos on my blog</p>
<p>one two three and I do I mean you could</p>
<p>try to do it vegan but but the problem</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s so difficult because you</p>
<p>have to know about all these</p>
<p>deficiencies and taking certain things</p>
<p>and a lot of people end up with problems</p>
<p>with that and having a hard time losing</p>
<p>weight because there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>carbohydrates in being a vegan that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to keep those low and keep your</p>
<p>protein high so you end up having like</p>
<p>on a tofu meat and this and that so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not practical so I would recommend</p>
<p>doing it the way I recommend it and I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ll be very happy</p>
<p>Pera so go ahead and try that and then</p>
<p>let us know how how your successes Karen</p>
<p>was laughing no because Matthew D on</p>
<p>YouTube typed the chef quit because they</p>
<p>cut his celery</p>
<p>sometimes you need a chuckle okay you</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;m saying yep okay so a couple of</p>
<p>times we&rsquo;ve gotten a request of</p>
<p>greetings from Italy ciao oh I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait to go back to Italy oh my gosh I</p>
<p>hope they open up to everything pretty</p>
<p>fast that&rsquo;s our first flight okay anyway</p>
<p>lip belma&rsquo;s yeah the lipoma is a kind of</p>
<p>a fatty tumor that&rsquo;s very benign it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not gonna grow it just kind of hangs out</p>
<p>and just sits there and irritates people</p>
<p>I honestly have not found any</p>
<p>information that can get rid of those</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t but you have surgery as an</p>
<p>option but there&rsquo;s theories that it</p>
<p>could come from a liver problem or some</p>
<p>virus honestly it what makes the most</p>
<p>sense to me is that your body is trying</p>
<p>to encapsulate something just like an</p>
<p>absence abscess that you or a cyst</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to hold something in that</p>
<p>area but that&rsquo;s just my theory and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s actual truth or not</p>
<p>okay okay good</p>
<p>okay now Mina wants to know when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>done with keto then what do you do then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good you&rsquo;re good to go so you do</p>
<p>keto for two weeks and you&rsquo;re done you</p>
<p>very much yeah you&rsquo;re good and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very much is amazing your skin is</p>
<p>improved you have no loose skin at all</p>
<p>great muscle time let me explain what</p>
<p>happens after keto</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the keto is like it&rsquo;s not like a</p>
<p>diet that you&rsquo;re gonna just do and not</p>
<p>do it&rsquo;s more like a complete shift of</p>
<p>eating a new eating style for the rest</p>
<p>of your life yeah if you just consider</p>
<p>it the user manual for the body it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the basic eating plan for the body</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fuel for the body it it&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>has so many advantages not just in</p>
<p>lowering insulin and running your and</p>
<p>running your body on ketones which have</p>
<p>a whole bunch of benefits for your brain</p>
<p>and heart and mood and cognitive</p>
<p>function an immune system but it also</p>
<p>has benefits of doing the type of keto</p>
<p>that we recommend is they called healthy</p>
<p>keto which is not just lowering your</p>
<p>carbs it&rsquo;s actually satisfying all your</p>
<p>nutrient requirements so as you lose</p>
<p>weight you look good and you look</p>
<p>younger and you&rsquo;re healthy for it you</p>
<p>might not know this but and I cover this</p>
<p>into my last summit but you know that</p>
<p>radiation causes genetic damage to your</p>
<p>DNA right radiation will do that did you</p>
<p>know that vitamin deficiencies will also</p>
<p>create similar if not the same damage as</p>
<p>radiation as far as your DNA breaks DNA</p>
<p>damage if you&rsquo;re deficient in folic acid</p>
<p>you can lift this up you actually could</p>
<p>get so it&rsquo;s protective so you can get</p>
<p>damage to your DNA which then can lead</p>
<p>to accelerated aging and all sorts of</p>
<p>susceptibility to problems yeah so I</p>
<p>mean so why not satisfy all your</p>
<p>nutrients now because now you have the</p>
<p>knowledge and you can actually predict</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen let me ask you a</p>
<p>question you just made me think of</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>a lot of people think that they have the</p>
<p>condition that they have because they</p>
<p>inherited it from their mom or dad or</p>
<p>their grandmother or my family has a</p>
<p>history of blah</p>
<p>everything from hangnails to really</p>
<p>serious conditions what&rsquo;s your thought I</p>
<p>think that the genes based on all the</p>
<p>data will contribute maybe a small</p>
<p>percentage maybe like 5% yes you may</p>
<p>have a weakness to a certain disease or</p>
<p>this or that but it&rsquo;s really something</p>
<p>called epigenetics which is more</p>
<p>important that&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s above genetics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the things in your environment</p>
<p>that can cause an expression of your</p>
<p>gene to go one way or the other</p>
<p>and they prove this already so your</p>
<p>environment your stress level your new</p>
<p>foods that you eat your social</p>
<p>interaction like all these things play a</p>
<p>huge part in whether you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>express this gene for this disease or</p>
<p>not that&rsquo;s interesting so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everything from a family well you know I</p>
<p>have a history of blah but your family</p>
<p>has traditionally eaten in the same way</p>
<p>for generations the same kind of foods</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s a in an area of the world</p>
<p>that are heavy smokers or heavy heavy</p>
<p>like I mean it could even be cultures or</p>
<p>you could say well this particular</p>
<p>culture or this particular group has a</p>
<p>higher tendency to experience the law</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not because of who they are</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more because of what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating and in the culture it even goes</p>
<p>beyond eating it&rsquo;s like you hear this</p>
<p>people say people say oh yeah well my</p>
<p>grandfather smoked like a fiend and</p>
<p>drank until his 9 years old and eating</p>
<p>is fine well it goes beyond nutrition it</p>
<p>goes into your stress level your</p>
<p>viewpoint on things people are very</p>
<p>strong-willed and they&rsquo;re just gonna</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re survivors you know just because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very positive they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not basically they&rsquo;re not in fear</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not in this fear like all my</p>
<p>gosh where am I going</p>
<p>so fear is a type of stress that is</p>
<p>probably one of the most deadly things</p>
<p>for your immune system and for your</p>
<p>health and unfortunately this is this is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening now people are in a</p>
<p>stereo they&rsquo;re freaking out and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not good for your health so one of the</p>
<p>most</p>
<p>important things is to be careful of how</p>
<p>much news that you consume I would limit</p>
<p>that I would curb that and or your you</p>
<p>know hanging out people that really</p>
<p>bring you up and I think that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like even more important than nutrition</p>
<p>there really is because um especially</p>
<p>nowadays finally speaking of news most</p>
<p>of the audience knows that I had Cove in</p>
<p>nineteen and got over but there is this</p>
<p>rumor out there that you&rsquo;re just going</p>
<p>to keep getting it over and over the</p>
<p>World Health Organization said that and</p>
<p>let me just offer a little hope for that</p>
<p>so when I normally get sick I don&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>my temperature every day I just get to</p>
<p>feel bad and you start feeling better</p>
<p>well the health department told me to do</p>
<p>it morning and night at the same time</p>
<p>and what I discovered I started feeling</p>
<p>better at some point and a little lousy</p>
<p>and so on but I had a temperature for</p>
<p>two weeks straight low-grade but two</p>
<p>weeks straight and if I hadn&rsquo;t taken it</p>
<p>I would have said well gee I feel better</p>
<p>four or five days in and then I feel it</p>
<p>allows you take my temperature and I was</p>
<p>ill my god I&rsquo;ve gotten it again I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>contracted it twice and it&rsquo;s not true it</p>
<p>takes quite a while to shed this virus</p>
<p>at least I was in quarantine the wealth</p>
<p>self quarantine for seventeen days until</p>
<p>I came out so I think that&rsquo;s nonsense</p>
<p>that you know suddenly there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>demonstration of proof that everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna continually get cove in nineteen</p>
<p>until we all die that&rsquo;s stupid I feel</p>
<p>great by the way I am not symptomatic I</p>
<p>have no fever and people are not</p>
<p>dropping dead around me you guys are</p>
<p>evidence of that you&rsquo;re still alive even</p>
<p>though you&rsquo;ve been exposed to me so yeah</p>
<p>I just want to I want to bring up that</p>
<p>question because I think it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>put you guys at ease based on all the</p>
<p>information out there and I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>heavily researched researching this</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;m talking like massive massive</p>
<p>research on a daily basis and the</p>
<p>question or the point I want to bring up</p>
<p>is that certain people I won&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>their name are putting out there that if</p>
<p>you get the infection you recover you</p>
<p>can get it again okay all the data shows</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not true it shows that you</p>
<p>can build immunity to this virus okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s number one what&rsquo;s really probably</p>
<p>happening where there&rsquo;s some people that</p>
<p>are relapsing because the way they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing testing only measures so deep so</p>
<p>you could literally have about</p>
<p>2,500 I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>viral signatures whatever and you get</p>
<p>your test they&rsquo;re like oh you&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s negative it doesn&rsquo;t show any</p>
<p>positive for testing yet you have about</p>
<p>2,500 left so I think it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>cutoff point is like 3,000 so if you</p>
<p>have if you&rsquo;re getting on the hospital</p>
<p>and you still have a little bit of viral</p>
<p>load left and then your immune system is</p>
<p>bad you go back to junk food whatever</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t recovered your immune system</p>
<p>because you they didn&rsquo;t really talk</p>
<p>about diet they&rsquo;re not necessarily the</p>
<p>hospital giving you you know the foods</p>
<p>that you want and all of a sudden you</p>
<p>ever relapse that could happen but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not if you what happens when you build</p>
<p>antibodies your body will then be</p>
<p>protected and so I will do more videos</p>
<p>on this but you don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about that because based on the data now</p>
<p>if that was true you would see certain</p>
<p>countries just like flowering up like</p>
<p>crazy and or people that already had it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re flowing you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>seeing that I am going to also do a</p>
<p>massive video on the immune system and I</p>
<p>also want to talk about the countries</p>
<p>that are doing very well in the</p>
<p>countries that are not doing well and</p>
<p>the differences so you can actually get</p>
<p>that data I have of course watch your</p>
<p>people that watch their videos in all</p>
<p>areas of the world so we&rsquo;re able to get</p>
<p>actual data that&rsquo;s not filtered out to</p>
<p>the news we can get people with the data</p>
<p>of the true information so that&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>really exciting let&rsquo;s go to Gregory from</p>
<p>Orlando your daughter had an operation</p>
<p>on the ovaries and you had a question</p>
<p>about that yes you to be taking my call</p>
<p>this morning my daughter had this</p>
<p>surgery in a release and and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened in all this in December she</p>
<p>started getting defenders started</p>
<p>experiencing different issues example</p>
<p>strep throat white spots an assault and</p>
<p>she tested negative for Kovac and but</p>
<p>there was these white spots that have</p>
<p>been coming back on and off</p>
<p>and I think she also has some headaches</p>
<p>that comes with a pollination so I was</p>
<p>just wondering if you have any Florida</p>
<p>suggestion that we can apply to her</p>
<p>situation where is the white spots</p>
<p>within their council area oh okay got it</p>
<p>and this happened after the operation</p>
<p>well we have to believe that that is the</p>
<p>case if she hadn&rsquo;t been having it before</p>
<p>no chance is she on keto and in a minute</p>
<p>fasting no okay we we have we have been</p>
<p>applying alternative remedy to a</p>
<p>situation like this in doing a lot of</p>
<p>juices and having her do the cleansing</p>
<p>ever so often but still its body is four</p>
<p>weeks because of this surgery to change</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s had and besides she gets a lot of</p>
<p>headaches or the result of a of all you</p>
<p>know ovulation that creates a tremendous</p>
<p>amount the problem to hold recovering</p>
<p>and so we don&rsquo;t really know what what to</p>
<p>do about the association I have some</p>
<p>suggestions Greg and of course I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>replacing medical care but I just this</p>
<p>is my opinion on this first of all I</p>
<p>would try to convince her twist her arm</p>
<p>and try to get her on keto and I mean</p>
<p>fasting just because all the remedies</p>
<p>that you give her may not be enough to</p>
<p>overcome the food and the nutrition</p>
<p>going in her body especially if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>white spots around the tonsils it could</p>
<p>be some type of immune weakness you know</p>
<p>who knows but get in the basics of Kido</p>
<p>and in a minute fasting as much as you</p>
<p>can and if you can&rsquo;t do that at least</p>
<p>cut down the carbs are sweet junk foods</p>
<p>that type of thing the other thing that</p>
<p>I think would be good for her is a zinc</p>
<p>spray in the mouth and the throat that</p>
<p>might help because ink is very important</p>
<p>and last thing that I always recommend</p>
<p>especially with women that have they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>always removed there&rsquo;s a great remedy</p>
<p>that I used in standard process just</p>
<p>seems to actually support what&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called over troph in PMG Oh</p>
<p>troph in PMG get some of that from</p>
<p>standard process look it up order it and</p>
<p>have her take one a day before bed okay</p>
<p>thanks Greg all right so let&rsquo;s take the</p>
<p>last call here from India are you there</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t pronounce your name but so yes</p>
<p>my name is okay my name is Osama and</p>
<p>calling from India and first of all I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t thank you enough for bringing</p>
<p>cheeto to the floor I have the Kuwait 19</p>
<p>shut down as you know allowed some</p>
<p>discipline and Kito&rsquo;s going really well</p>
<p>for me I have lost about 20 pounds on</p>
<p>kinda half I guess it&rsquo;s really going</p>
<p>good but the problem is this I Peter of</p>
<p>weight loss little in the last one week</p>
<p>and you know what are the my question to</p>
<p>you is what are the top five things I</p>
<p>can do to break that Plateau and I</p>
<p>researched your videos and I understood</p>
<p>that in investing which I was in doing</p>
<p>earlier and HIIT could be an answer</p>
<p>right so I&rsquo;ve started that but but how</p>
<p>do I calculate the amount of challenge I</p>
<p>know how does that fit calories and</p>
<p>macros for myself but in a normal keto</p>
<p>but how do I do that in the case of</p>
<p>intermittent fasting I&rsquo;m doing for 24</p>
<p>hours if I&rsquo;m 36 how do i RI with it</p>
<p>because yeah surely I can&rsquo;t eat you know</p>
<p>the two thousand of thousand you cannot</p>
<p>have this I normally consider right okay</p>
<p>and action good questions so let me just</p>
<p>answer that real quickly because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to find my video in that specific</p>
<p>topic I would not go about calories</p>
<p>forget the calories go by that one meal</p>
<p>a day that you&rsquo;re gonna be eating or of</p>
<p>is to eat as much as you can eat without</p>
<p>feeling uncomfortably stuffed okay and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about calories just make</p>
<p>sure the the type of food that you eat</p>
<p>is is really healthy with the vegetables</p>
<p>and the protein and not worry about</p>
<p>anything else because when you do in a</p>
<p>minute fasting your requirements for</p>
<p>nutrients go down and you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>what you need before you so your body</p>
<p>becomes very efficient and you can start</p>
<p>watching our cooking channel because we</p>
<p>just we&rsquo;re going to be releasing an</p>
<p>Indian series of recipes that are</p>
<p>die for I mean literally a few like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got better but but you&rsquo;ll learn Quito</p>
<p>friendly yeah you&rsquo;ll just you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>that you can have that Quito friendly</p>
<p>and what was that we made non and we had</p>
<p>some other butter chicken is like no</p>
<p>sugar very that&rsquo;s a big deal for us yeah</p>
<p>chicken massage anyway thanks for your</p>
<p>call and let us know how that works out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s past twelve</p>
<p>anyway we really appreciate your</p>
<p>attention your questions I wish to get</p>
<p>to every single one great successes I</p>
<p>mean I don&rsquo;t read them here but</p>
<p>especially on Facebook it&rsquo;s seems like</p>
<p>50% of the comments especially in the</p>
<p>beginning of the show our appreciation</p>
<p>and successes and that&rsquo;s you guys taking</p>
<p>this information and putting it to use</p>
<p>and trying again and asking your</p>
<p>questions and watching your videos and</p>
<p>putting it to use and and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>really cool</p>
<p>yeah thanks a lot we&rsquo;ll see you next</p>
<p>week</p>
