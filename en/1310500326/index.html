    <p>there&rsquo;s a broader question here, right? As we build socially and emotionally intelligent machines,</p>
<p>what does that mean about our relationship with them and then more broadly our relationship with</p>
<p>one another, right? Because this machine is going to be programmed to be amazing at empathy,</p>
<p>by definition, right? It&rsquo;s going to always be there for you. It&rsquo;s not going to get bored.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about that. I think about that a lot.</p>
<p>TITO The following is a conversation with Rana</p>
<p>L. Kliubi, a pioneer in the field of emotion recognition and human centric artificial</p>
<p>intelligence. She is the founder of Effectiva, deputy CEO of SmartEye, author of Girl Decoded,</p>
<p>and one of the most brilliant, kind, inspiring, and fun human beings I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to</p>
<p>talk to. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in</p>
<p>the description. And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Rana L. Kliubi. You grew up in the Middle East,</p>
<p>in Egypt. What is the memory from that time that makes you smile? Or maybe a memory that stands out</p>
<p>as helping your mind take shape and helping you define yourself in this world?</p>
<p>RANA L. KLIUBI So the memory that stands out is we used to</p>
<p>live in my grandma&rsquo;s house. She used to have these mango trees in her garden. And in the summer,</p>
<p>and so mango season was like July and August. And so in the summer, she would invite all my aunts</p>
<p>and uncles and cousins. And it was just like maybe there were like 20 or 30 people in the house,</p>
<p>and she would cook all this amazing food. And us, the kids, we would go down the garden,</p>
<p>and we would pick all these mangoes. And I don&rsquo;t know, I think it&rsquo;s just the bringing people</p>
<p>together that always stuck with me, the warmth. TITO Around the mango tree.</p>
<p>RANA L. KLIUBI Yeah, around the mango tree. And there&rsquo;s just like the joy, the joy of being</p>
<p>together around food. And I&rsquo;m a terrible cook. So I guess that didn&rsquo;t, that memory didn&rsquo;t translate</p>
<p>to me kind of doing the same. I love hosting people. TITO Do you remember colors, smells?</p>
<p>Is that what, like what, how does memory work? Like what do you visualize? Do you visualize</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s faces, smiles? Do you, is there colors? Is there like a theme to the colors? Is it smells</p>
<p>because of food involved? RANA L. KLIUBI Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a great question. So the,</p>
<p>those Egyptian mangoes, there&rsquo;s a particular type that I love, and it&rsquo;s called Darwasi mangoes. And</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of, you know, they&rsquo;re oval, and they have a little red in them. So I kind of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re red and mango colored on the outside. So I remember that. TITO Does red indicate like</p>
<p>extra sweetness? Is that, is that, that means like it&rsquo;s nicely, yeah, it&rsquo;s nice and ripe and stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah. What, what&rsquo;s like a definitive food of Egypt? You know, there&rsquo;s like these almost</p>
<p>stereotypical foods in different parts of the world, like Ukraine invented borscht.</p>
<p>Borscht is this beet soup with, that you put sour cream on. See, it&rsquo;s not, I can&rsquo;t see if you,</p>
<p>if you know, if you know what it is, I think, you know, is delicious. But if I explain it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not going to sound delicious. I feel like beet soup. This doesn&rsquo;t make any sense,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of, and you probably have actually seen pictures of it because it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>traditional foods in Ukraine, in Russia, in different parts of the Slavic world. So that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s become so cliche and stereotypical that you almost don&rsquo;t mention it, but it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>delicious. Like I visited Ukraine, I eat that every single day, so.</p>
<p>Do you, do you make it yourself? How hard is it to make?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know. I think to make it well, like anything, like Italians, they say, well,</p>
<p>tomato sauce is easy to make, but to make it right, that&rsquo;s like a generational skill. So anyway,</p>
<p>is there something like that in Egypt? Is there a culture of food?</p>
<p>There is. And actually, we have a similar kind of soup. It&rsquo;s called molokhia, and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s made</p>
<p>of this green plant. It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s somewhere between spinach and kale, and you mince it,</p>
<p>and then you cook it in like chicken broth. And my grandma used to make, and my mom makes it really</p>
<p>well, and I try to make it, but it&rsquo;s not as great. So we used to have that. And then we used to have</p>
<p>it alongside stuffed pigeons. I&rsquo;m pescetarian now, so I don&rsquo;t eat that anymore, but.</p>
<p>Stuffed pigeons.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, it was really yummy. It&rsquo;s the one thing I miss about,</p>
<p>you know, now that I&rsquo;m pescetarian and I don&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>The stuffed pigeons?</p>
<p>Yeah, the stuffed pigeons.</p>
<p>Is it, what are they stuffed with? If that doesn&rsquo;t bother you too much to describe.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s stuffed with a lot of like just rice and, yeah, it&rsquo;s just rice. Yeah, so.</p>
<p>And you also, you said that your first, in your book, that your first computer</p>
<p>was an Atari, and Space Invaders was your favorite game.</p>
<p>Is that when you first fell in love with computers, would you say?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say so.</p>
<p>Video games, or just the computer itself? Just something about the machine.</p>
<p>Ooh, this thing, there&rsquo;s magic in here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the magical moment is definitely like playing video games with my,</p>
<p>I have two younger sisters, and we would just like had fun together, like playing games.</p>
<p>But the other memory I have is my first code, the first code I wrote.</p>
<p>I wrote, I drew a Christmas tree, and I&rsquo;m Muslim, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of, it was kind of funny that the first thing I did was like this Christmas tree.</p>
<p>So, yeah, and that&rsquo;s when I realized, wow, you can write code to do all sorts of like</p>
<p>really cool stuff. I must have been like six or seven at the time.</p>
<p>So you can write programs, and the programs do stuff for you. That&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, if you think about it, that&rsquo;s empowering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s AI.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know what it is. I don&rsquo;t know if that, you see like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if many people think of it that way when they first learned to program.</p>
<p>They just love the puzzle of it. Like, ooh, this is cool. This is pretty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Christmas tree, but like, it&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>It is power.</p>
<p>Eventually, I guess you couldn&rsquo;t at the time, but eventually this thing,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s interesting enough, if it&rsquo;s a pretty enough Christmas tree,</p>
<p>it can be run by millions of people and bring them joy, like that little thing.</p>
<p>And then because it&rsquo;s digital, it&rsquo;s easy to spread.</p>
<p>So like you just created something that&rsquo;s easily spreadable to millions of people.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to think that way when you&rsquo;re six.</p>
<p>In the book, you write, I am who I am because I was raised by a particular set of parents,</p>
<p>both modern and conservative, forward thinking, yet locked in tradition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Muslim and I feel I&rsquo;m stronger, more centered for it.</p>
<p>I adhere to the values of my religion, even if I&rsquo;m not as dutiful as I once was.</p>
<p>And I am a new American and I&rsquo;m thriving on the energy,</p>
<p>vitality and entrepreneurial spirit of this great country.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about your parents.</p>
<p>What have you learned about life from them, especially when you were young?</p>
<p>So both my parents, they&rsquo;re Egyptian, but they moved to Kuwait right out.</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s a cute story about how they met.</p>
<p>So my dad taught COBOL in the 70s.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>And my mom decided to learn programming.</p>
<p>So she signed up to take his COBOL programming class.</p>
<p>And he tried to date her and she was like, no, no, no, I don&rsquo;t date.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;ll propose.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how they got married.</p>
<p>Whoa, strong move.</p>
<p>Right, exactly, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really impressive.</p>
<p>Those COBOL guys know how to impress a lady.</p>
<p>So yeah, so what have you learned from them?</p>
<p>So definitely grit.</p>
<p>One of the core values in our family is just hard work.</p>
<p>There were no slackers in our family.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s definitely stayed with me,</p>
<p>both as a professional, but also in my personal life.</p>
<p>But I also think my mom, my mom always used to like, I don&rsquo;t know, it was like unconditional</p>
<p>love.</p>
<p>Like I just knew my parents would be there for me kind of regardless of what I chose to do.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s very powerful.</p>
<p>And they got tested on it because I kind of challenged cultural norms and I kind of took</p>
<p>a different path, I guess, than what&rsquo;s expected of a woman in the Middle East.</p>
<p>And they still love me, which I&rsquo;m so grateful for that.</p>
<p>When was like a moment that was the most challenging for them?</p>
<p>Which moment where they kind of had to come face to face with the fact that you&rsquo;re a bit</p>
<p>of a rebel?</p>
<p>I think the first big moment was when I had just gotten married, but I decided to go do</p>
<p>my PhD at Cambridge University.</p>
<p>And because my husband at the time, he&rsquo;s now my ex, ran a company in Cairo, he was going</p>
<p>to stay in Egypt.</p>
<p>So it was going to be a long distance relationship.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very unusual in the Middle East for a woman to just head out and kind of pursue</p>
<p>her career.</p>
<p>And so my dad and my parents in law both said, you know, we do not approve of you doing this,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re under the jurisdiction of your husband so he can make the call.</p>
<p>And luckily for me, he was supportive.</p>
<p>He said, you know, this is your dream come true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve always wanted to do a PhD.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to support you.</p>
<p>So I think that was the first time where, you know, I challenged the cultural norms.</p>
<p>Was that scary?</p>
<p>Oh, my God, yes.</p>
<p>It was totally scary.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the biggest culture shock from there to Cambridge, to London?</p>
<p>Well, that was also during right around September 11th.</p>
<p>So everyone thought that there was going to be a third world war.</p>
<p>It was really like, and I, at the time I used to wear the hijab, so I was very visibly Muslim.</p>
<p>And so my parents just were, they were afraid for my safety.</p>
<p>But anyways, when I got to Cambridge, because I was so scared, I decided to take off my</p>
<p>headscarf and wear a hat instead.</p>
<p>So I just went to class wearing these like British hats, which was, in my opinion, actually</p>
<p>worse than just showing up in a headscarf because it was just so awkward, right?</p>
<p>Like sitting in class with like all these.</p>
<p>Trying to fit in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like a spy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So after a few weeks of doing that, I was like, to heck with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to go back to wearing my headscarf.</p>
<p>Yeah, you wore the hijab, so starting in 2000 and for 12 years after.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always, whenever you&rsquo;re in public, you have to wear the head covering.</p>
<p>Can you speak to that, to the hijab, maybe your mixed feelings about it?</p>
<p>Like what does it represent in its best case?</p>
<p>What does it represent in the worst case?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of, I guess I&rsquo;ll first start by saying I wore</p>
<p>it voluntarily.</p>
<p>I was not forced to wear it.</p>
<p>And in fact, I was one of the very first women in my family to decide to put on the hijab.</p>
<p>And my family thought it was really odd, right?</p>
<p>Like there was, they were like, why do you want to put this on?</p>
<p>And at its best, it&rsquo;s a sign of modesty, humility.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like me wearing a suit, people are like, why are you wearing a suit?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a step back into some kind of tradition, a respect for tradition of sorts.</p>
<p>So you said, because it&rsquo;s by choice, you&rsquo;re kind of free to make that choice to celebrate</p>
<p>a tradition of modesty.</p>
<p>Exactly. And I actually like made it my own.</p>
<p>I remember I would really match the color of my headscarf with what I was wearing.</p>
<p>Like it was a form of self expression and at its best, I loved wearing it.</p>
<p>You know, I have a lot of questions around how we practice religion and religion and,</p>
<p>you know, and I think also it was a time where I was spending a lot of time going back and</p>
<p>forth between the US and Egypt.</p>
<p>And I started meeting a lot of people in the US who are just amazing people, very purpose</p>
<p>driven, people who have very strong core values, but they&rsquo;re not Muslim.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay, right?</p>
<p>And so that was when I just had a lot of questions.</p>
<p>And politically, also the situation in Egypt was when the Muslim Brotherhood ran the country</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t agree with their ideology.</p>
<p>It was at a time when I was going through a divorce.</p>
<p>Like it was like, it was like just the perfect storm of like political, personal conditions</p>
<p>where I was like, this doesn&rsquo;t feel like me anymore.</p>
<p>And it took a lot of courage to take it off because culturally it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s okay if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wear it, but it&rsquo;s really not okay to wear it and then take it off.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re still, so you have to do that while still maintaining a deep core and pride in</p>
<p>the origins, in your origin story.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So still being Egyptian, still being a Muslim.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And being, I think generally like faith driven, but yeah.</p>
<p>But what that means changes year by year for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a personal journey.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>What would you say is the role of faith in that part of the world?</p>
<p>Like, how do you see, you mentioned it a bit in the book too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, I think there is something really powerful about just believing that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bigger force, you know, there&rsquo;s a kind of surrendering, I guess, that comes</p>
<p>with religion and you surrender and you have this deep conviction that it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>okay, right?</p>
<p>Like the universe is out to like do amazing things for you and it&rsquo;s going to be okay.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s strength to that.</p>
<p>Like even when you&rsquo;re going through adversity, you just know that it&rsquo;s going to work out.</p>
<p>Yeah, it gives you like an inner peace, a calmness.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s faith in all the meanings of that word.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Faith that everything is going to be okay.</p>
<p>And it is because time passes and time cures all things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a calmness with the chaos of the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s like a silver, I&rsquo;m a true believer of this, that something at the specific</p>
<p>moment in time can look like it&rsquo;s catastrophic and it&rsquo;s not what you wanted in life.</p>
<p>But then time passes and then you look back and there&rsquo;s the silver lining, right?</p>
<p>It maybe closed the door, but it opened a new door for you.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m a true believer in that, that, you know, there&rsquo;s a silver lining in almost</p>
<p>anything in life, you just have to have this like, yeah, faith or conviction that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to work out.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s such a beautiful way to see a shady feeling.</p>
<p>So if you feel shady about a current situation, I mean, it almost is always true.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s the cliche thing of if it doesn&rsquo;t kill you, whatever doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes</p>
<p>you stronger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it does seem that over time when you take a perspective on things that the hardest</p>
<p>moments and periods of your life are the most meaningful.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So over time you get to have that perspective.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What about, because you mentioned Kuwait, what about, let me ask you about war.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of war and peace, maybe even the big love and hate in that part of</p>
<p>the world, because it does seem to be a part of the world where there&rsquo;s turmoil.</p>
<p>There was turmoil, there&rsquo;s still turmoil.</p>
<p>It is so unfortunate, honestly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s such a waste of human resources and, and, and yeah, and human mindshare.</p>
<p>I mean, and at the end of the day, we all kind of want the same things.</p>
<p>We want, you know, we want a human connection, we want joy, we want to feel fulfilled, we</p>
<p>want to feel, you know, a life of purpose.</p>
<p>And I just, I just find it baffling, honestly, that we are still having to grapple with that.</p>
<p>I have a story to share about this.</p>
<p>You know, I grew up, I&rsquo;m Egyptian, American now, but, but, you know, originally from Egypt.</p>
<p>And when I first got to Cambridge, it turned out my officemate, like my PhD kind of, you</p>
<p>know, she ended up, you know, we ended up becoming friends, but she was from Israel.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t know, yeah, we didn&rsquo;t know how it was going to be like.</p>
<p>Did you guys sit there just staring at each other for a bit?</p>
<p>Actually, she, because I arrived before she did.</p>
<p>And it turns out she emailed our PhD advisor and asked him if she thought it was going</p>
<p>to be okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this is around 9 11 too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, and Peter, Peter Robinson, our PhD advisor was like, yeah, like, this is an academic</p>
<p>institution, just show up.</p>
<p>And we became super good friends.</p>
<p>We were both new moms.</p>
<p>Like we both had our kids during our PhD.</p>
<p>We were both doing artificial emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>She was looking at speech.</p>
<p>I was looking at the face.</p>
<p>We just had so the culture was so similar.</p>
<p>Our jokes were similar.</p>
<p>It was just, I was like, why on earth are our countries, why is there all this like</p>
<p>war and tension?</p>
<p>And I think it falls back to the narrative, right?</p>
<p>If you change the narrative, like whoever creates this narrative of war.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We should have women run the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one solution.</p>
<p>The good women, because there&rsquo;s also evil women in the world.</p>
<p>True, okay.</p>
<p>But yes, yes, there could be less war if women ran the world.</p>
<p>The other aspect is, it doesn&rsquo;t matter the gender, the people in power.</p>
<p>I get to see this with Ukraine and Russia and different parts of the world around that</p>
<p>conflict now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s happening in Yemen as well and everywhere else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s these narratives told by the leaders to the populace.</p>
<p>And those narratives take hold and everybody believes that.</p>
<p>And they have a distorted view of the humanity on the other side.</p>
<p>In fact, especially during war, you don&rsquo;t even see the people on the other side as human</p>
<p>or as equal intelligence or worth or value as you.</p>
<p>You tell all kinds of narratives about them being Nazis or dumb or whatever narrative</p>
<p>you want to weave around that or evil.</p>
<p>But I think when you actually meet them face to face, you realize they&rsquo;re like the same.</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a big shock for people to realize that they&rsquo;ve been essentially lied to within</p>
<p>their country.</p>
<p>And I kind of have faith that social media, as ridiculous as it is to say, or any kind</p>
<p>of technology, is able to bypass the walls that governments put up and connect people</p>
<p>directly.</p>
<p>And then you get to realize, oh, people fall in love across different nations and religions</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And that, I think, ultimately can cure a lot of our ills, especially in person.</p>
<p>I also think that if leaders met in person, they&rsquo;d have a conversation that could cure</p>
<p>a lot of the ills of the world, especially in private.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the women running the world.</p>
<p>So gender does, in part, perhaps shape the landscape of just our human experience.</p>
<p>So in what ways was it limiting and in what ways was it empowering for you to be a woman</p>
<p>in the Middle East?</p>
<p>I think, just kind of going back to my comment on women running the world, I think it comes</p>
<p>back to empathy, which has been a common thread throughout my entire career.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this idea of human connection.</p>
<p>Once you build common ground with a person or a group of people, you build trust, you</p>
<p>build loyalty, you build friendship.</p>
<p>And then you can turn that into behavior change and motivation and persuasion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, empathy and emotions are just at the center of everything we do.</p>
<p>And I think being from the Middle East, kind of this human connection is very strong.</p>
<p>We have this running joke that if you come to Egypt for a visit, people will know everything</p>
<p>about your life right away, right?</p>
<p>I have no problems asking you about your personal life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no boundaries, really, no personal boundaries in terms of getting to know people.</p>
<p>We get emotionally intimate very, very quickly.</p>
<p>But I think people just get to know each other authentically, I guess.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t this superficial level of getting to know people.</p>
<p>You just try to get to know people really deeply.</p>
<p>Empathy is a part of that.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Because you can put yourself in this person&rsquo;s shoe and kind of, yeah, imagine what challenges</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going through, and so I think I&rsquo;ve definitely taken that with me.</p>
<p>Generosity is another one too, like just being generous with your time and love and attention</p>
<p>and even with your wealth, right?</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t have a lot of it, you&rsquo;re still very generous.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s another&hellip;</p>
<p>Enjoying the humanity of other people.</p>
<p>And so do you think there&rsquo;s a useful difference between men and women in that?</p>
<p>In that aspect and empathy?</p>
<p>Or is doing these kind of big general groups, does that hinder progress?</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually don&rsquo;t want to overgeneralize.</p>
<p>I mean, some of the men I know are like the most empathetic humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, I strive to be empathetic.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re actually very empathetic.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don&rsquo;t want to overgeneralize.</p>
<p>Although one of the researchers I worked with when I was at Cambridge, Professor Simon Baron Cohen,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s Sacha Baron Cohen&rsquo;s cousin, and he runs the Autism Research Center at Cambridge,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s written multiple books on autism.</p>
<p>And one of his theories is the empathy scale, like the systemizers and the empathizers,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a disproportionate amount of computer scientists and engineers who are</p>
<p>systemizers and perhaps not great empathizers, and then there&rsquo;s more men in that bucket,</p>
<p>I guess, than women, and then there&rsquo;s more women in the empathizers bucket.</p>
<p>So again, not to overgeneralize.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been frustrating to me how many, I guess, systemizers there are in the field of robotics.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually encouraging to me because I care about, obviously, social robotics,</p>
<p>and because there&rsquo;s more opportunity for people that are empathic.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>Well, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So every robotics I talk to, they don&rsquo;t see the human as interesting, as it&rsquo;s not exciting.</p>
<p>You want to avoid the human at all costs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a safety concern to be touching the human, which it is, but it is also an opportunity</p>
<p>for deep connection or collaboration or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And because most brilliant roboticists don&rsquo;t care about the human, it&rsquo;s an opportunity,</p>
<p>in your case, it&rsquo;s a business opportunity too, but in general, an opportunity to explore</p>
<p>those ideas.</p>
<p>So in this beautiful journey to Cambridge, to UK, and then to America, what&rsquo;s the moment</p>
<p>or moments that were most transformational for you as a scientist and as a leader?</p>
<p>So you became an exceptionally successful CEO, founder, researcher, scientist, and so on.</p>
<p>Was there a face shift there where, like, I can be somebody, I can really do something</p>
<p>in this world?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So actually, just kind of a little bit of background.</p>
<p>So the reason why I moved from Cairo to Cambridge, UK to do my PhD is because I had a very clear</p>
<p>career plan.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, I&rsquo;ll go abroad, get my PhD, going to crush it in three or four years,</p>
<p>come back to Egypt and teach.</p>
<p>It was very clear, very well laid out.</p>
<p>Was topic clear or no?</p>
<p>The topic, well, I did my PhD around building artificial emotional intelligence and looking</p>
<p>at&hellip;</p>
<p>But in your master plan ahead of time, when you&rsquo;re sitting by the mango tree, did you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s going to be artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>No, no, no, that I did not know.</p>
<p>Although I think I kind of knew that I was going to be doing computer science, but I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know the specific area.</p>
<p>But I love teaching.</p>
<p>I mean, I still love teaching.</p>
<p>So I just, yeah, I just wanted to go abroad, get a PhD, come back, teach.</p>
<p>Why computer science?</p>
<p>Can we just linger on that?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re such an empathic person who cares about emotion, humans and so on.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t, aren&rsquo;t computers cold and emotionless and just&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re changing that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, but like, isn&rsquo;t that the, or did you see computers as the, having the</p>
<p>capability to actually connect with humans?</p>
<p>I think that was like my takeaway from my experience just growing up, like computers</p>
<p>sit at the center of how we connect and communicate with one another, right?</p>
<p>Or technology in general.</p>
<p>Like I remember my first experience being away from my parents.</p>
<p>We communicated with a fax machine, but thank goodness for the fax machine, because we</p>
<p>could send letters back and forth to each other.</p>
<p>This was pre emails and stuff.</p>
<p>So I think, I think there&rsquo;s, I think technology can be not just transformative in terms of</p>
<p>productivity, et cetera.</p>
<p>It actually does change how we connect with one another.</p>
<p>Can I just defend the fax machine?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something like the haptic feel because the email is all digital.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something really nice.</p>
<p>I still write letters to people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something nice about the haptic aspect of the fax machine, because you still have</p>
<p>to press, you still have to do something in the physical world to make this thing a reality.</p>
<p>Right, and then it like comes out as a printout and you can actually touch it and read it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, there&rsquo;s something lost when it&rsquo;s just an email.</p>
<p>Obviously I wonder how we can regain some of that in the digital world, which goes to</p>
<p>the metaverse and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it anyway.</p>
<p>So, actually do you question on that one?</p>
<p>Do you still, do you have photo albums anymore?</p>
<p>Do you still print photos?</p>
<p>No, no, but I&rsquo;m a minimalist.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it was one of the, one of the painful steps in my life was to scan all the photos and</p>
<p>let go of them and then let go of all my books.</p>
<p>You let go of your books?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Switch to Kindle, everything Kindle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I thought, I thought, okay, think 30 years from now, nobody&rsquo;s going to have books anymore.</p>
<p>The technology of digital books is going to get better and better and better.</p>
<p>Are you really going to be the guy that&rsquo;s still romanticizing physical books?</p>
<p>Are you going to be the old man on the porch who&rsquo;s like kids?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So just get used to it because it was, it felt, it still feels a little bit uncomfortable</p>
<p>to read on a Kindle, but get used to it.</p>
<p>Like you always, I mean, I&rsquo;m trying to learn new programming language is always,</p>
<p>like with technology, you have to kind of challenge yourself to adapt to it.</p>
<p>You know, I forced myself to use TikTok.</p>
<p>No, that thing doesn&rsquo;t need much forcing.</p>
<p>It pulls you in like a, like the worst kind of, or the best kind of drug.</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, but I do love haptic things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a magic to the haptic.</p>
<p>Even like touchscreens, it&rsquo;s tricky to get right, to get the experience of a button.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, what were we talking about?</p>
<p>So AI, so the journey, your whole plan was to come back to Cairo and teach.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>What did the plan go wrong?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then I get to Cambridge and I fall in love with the idea of research.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And kind of embarking on a path.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s explored this path before.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re building stuff that nobody&rsquo;s built before.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s challenging and it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of nonbelievers.</p>
<p>I just totally love that.</p>
<p>And at the end of my PhD, I think it&rsquo;s the meeting that changed the trajectory of my life.</p>
<p>Professor Roslyn Picard, who&rsquo;s, she runs the Affective Computing Group at the MIT Media Lab.</p>
<p>I had read her book.</p>
<p>I, you know, I was like following, following, following all her research.</p>
<p>AKA Ros.</p>
<p>Yes, AKA Ros.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And she was giving a talk at a pattern recognition conference in Cambridge.</p>
<p>And she had a couple of hours to kill.</p>
<p>So she emailed the lab and she said, you know, if any students want to meet with me, like,</p>
<p>just, you know, sign up here.</p>
<p>And so I signed up for slot and I spent like the weeks leading up to it preparing for this</p>
<p>meeting and I want to show her a demo of my research and everything.</p>
<p>And we met and we ended up hitting it off.</p>
<p>Like we totally clicked.</p>
<p>And at the end of the meeting, she said, do you want to come work with me as a postdoc</p>
<p>at MIT?</p>
<p>And this is what I told her.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, this would be a dream come true, but there&rsquo;s a husband waiting for me</p>
<p>in Cairo.</p>
<p>I kind of have to go back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She said, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Just commute.</p>
<p>And I literally started commuting between Cairo and Boston.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was, it was a long commute.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t, I did that like every few weeks I would, you know, hop on a plane and go to</p>
<p>Boston.</p>
<p>But that, that changed the trajectory of my life.</p>
<p>There was no, I kind of outgrew my dreams, right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to go back to Egypt anymore and be faculty.</p>
<p>Like that was no longer my dream.</p>
<p>I had a dream.</p>
<p>What was the, what was it like to be at MIT?</p>
<p>What was that culture shock?</p>
<p>You mean America in general, but also, I mean, Cambridge has its own culture, right?</p>
<p>So what was MIT like and what was America like?</p>
<p>I think, I wonder if that&rsquo;s similar to your experience at MIT.</p>
<p>I was just, at the Media Lab in particular, I was just really, impressed is not the right</p>
<p>word.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect the openness to like innovation and the acceptance of taking a risk and failing.</p>
<p>Like failure isn&rsquo;t really accepted back in Egypt, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to fail.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a fear of failure, which I think has been hardwired in my brain.</p>
<p>But you get to MIT and it&rsquo;s okay to start things.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t work out, like it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You pivot to another idea.</p>
<p>And that kind of thinking was just very new to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s liberating.</p>
<p>Well, Media Lab, for people who don&rsquo;t know, MIT Media Lab is its own beautiful thing because</p>
<p>they, I think more than other places at MIT, reach for big ideas.</p>
<p>And like they try, I mean, I think, I mean, depending of course on who, but certainly</p>
<p>with Roslyn, you try wild stuff, you try big things and crazy things and also try to take</p>
<p>things to completion so you can demo them.</p>
<p>So always, always, always have a demo.</p>
<p>Like if you go, one of the sad things to me about robotics labs at MIT, and there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>over 30, I think, is like, usually when you show up to a robotics lab, there&rsquo;s not a single</p>
<p>working robot, they&rsquo;re all broken.</p>
<p>All the robots are broken.</p>
<p>The robots are broken, which is like the normal state of things because you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>But it would be nice if we lived in a world where robotics labs had some robots functioning.</p>
<p>One of my like favorite moments that just sticks with me, I visited Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>and there was a, first of all, seeing so many spots, so many legged robots in one place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m home.</p>
<p>But the, yeah.</p>
<p>This is where I was built.</p>
<p>The cool thing was just to see there was a random robot spot was walking down the hall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably doing mapping, but it looked like he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything and he was wearing</p>
<p>he or she, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it, well, I like, in my mind, there are people, they have a backstory, but this one</p>
<p>in particular definitely has a backstory because he was wearing a cowboy hat.</p>
<p>So I just saw a spot robot with a cowboy hat walking down the hall and there was just this</p>
<p>feeling like there&rsquo;s a life, like he has a life.</p>
<p>He probably has to commute back to his family at night.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a feeling like there&rsquo;s life instilled in this robot and it&rsquo;s magical.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It was, it was kind of inspiring to see.</p>
<p>Did it say hello to, did he say hello to you?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s very, there&rsquo;s a focus nature to the robot.</p>
<p>No, no, listen.</p>
<p>I love competence and focus and great.</p>
<p>Like he was not going to get distracted by the, the shallowness of small talk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a job to be done and he was doing it.</p>
<p>So anyway, the fact that it was working is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And I think Media Lab really prides itself on trying to always have a thing that&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>that you could show off.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We used to call it a demo or die.</p>
<p>You, you could not, yeah, you could not like show up with like PowerPoint or something.</p>
<p>You actually had to have a working, you know what, my son who is now 13, I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>this is still his life long goal or not, but when he was a little younger, his dream is</p>
<p>to build an island that&rsquo;s just inhabited by robots, like no humans.</p>
<p>He just wants all these robots to be connecting and having fun and there you go.</p>
<p>Does he have human, does he have an idea of which robots he loves most?</p>
<p>Is it, is it Roomba like robots?</p>
<p>Is it humanoid robots?</p>
<p>Robot dogs, or it&rsquo;s not clear yet.</p>
<p>We used to have a Jibo, which was one of the MIT Media Lab spin outs and he used to love</p>
<p>the giant head that spins and rotate and it&rsquo;s an eye or like not glowing like Cal 9000,</p>
<p>but the friendly version.</p>
<p>He loved that.</p>
<p>And then he just loves, uh, um,</p>
<p>yeah, he just, he, I think he loves all forms of robots actually.</p>
<p>So embodied intelligence.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I like, I personally like legged robots, especially, uh, anything that can wiggle its butt.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not the definition of what I love, but that&rsquo;s just technically what I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>working on recently.</p>
<p>Except I have a bunch of legged robots now in Austin and I&rsquo;ve been doing, I was, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been trying to, uh, have them communicate affection with their body in different ways</p>
<p>just for art, for art really.</p>
<p>Cause I love the idea of walking around with the robots, like, uh, as you would with a</p>
<p>dog.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s inspiring to a lot of people, especially young people.</p>
<p>Like kids love, kids love it.</p>
<p>Parents like adults are scared of robots, but kids don&rsquo;t have this kind of weird construction</p>
<p>of the world that&rsquo;s full of evil.</p>
<p>They love cool things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I remember when Adam was in first grade, so he must have been like seven or so.</p>
<p>I went in to his class with a whole bunch of robots and like the emotion AI demo and</p>
<p>da da.</p>
<p>And I asked the kids, I was like, do you, would you kids want to have a robot, you know,</p>
<p>robot friend or robot companion?</p>
<p>Everybody said yes.</p>
<p>And they wanted it for all sorts of things, like to help them with their math homework</p>
<p>and to like be a friend.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, it just struck me how there was no fear of robots was a lot of adults have</p>
<p>that like us versus them.</p>
<p>Yeah, none of that.</p>
<p>Of course you want to be very careful because you still have to look at the lessons of history</p>
<p>and how robots can be used by the power centers of the world to abuse your rights and all</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But mostly it&rsquo;s good to enter anything new with an excitement and an optimism.</p>
<p>Speaking of Roz, what have you learned about science and life from Rosalind Picard?</p>
<p>Oh my God, I&rsquo;ve learned so many things about life from Roz.</p>
<p>I think the thing I learned the most is perseverance.</p>
<p>When I first met Roz, we applied and she invited me to be her postdoc.</p>
<p>We applied for a grant to the National Science Foundation to apply some of our research to</p>
<p>autism.</p>
<p>And we got back.</p>
<p>We were rejected.</p>
<p>Rejected.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the reasoning was&hellip;</p>
<p>The first time you were rejected for fun, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was, and I basically, I just took the rejection to mean, okay, we&rsquo;re rejected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done, like end of story, right?</p>
<p>And Roz was like, it&rsquo;s great news.</p>
<p>They love the idea.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t think we can do it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s build it, show them, and then reapply.</p>
<p>And it was that, oh my God, that story totally stuck with me.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like that in every aspect of her life.</p>
<p>She just does not take no for an answer.</p>
<p>To reframe all negative feedback.</p>
<p>As a challenge.</p>
<p>Yes, they liked this.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It was a riot.</p>
<p>What else about science in general?</p>
<p>About how you see computers and also business and just everything about the world.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a very powerful, brilliant woman like yourself.</p>
<p>So is there some aspect of that too?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Roz is actually also very faith driven.</p>
<p>She has this like deep belief in conviction.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in the good in the world and humanity.</p>
<p>And I think that was meeting her and her family was definitely like a defining moment for me</p>
<p>because that was when I was like, wow, like you can be of a different background and</p>
<p>religion and whatever and you can still have the same core values.</p>
<p>So that was, that was, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful to her.</p>
<p>Roz, if you&rsquo;re listening, thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been on this podcast before.</p>
<p>I hope she&rsquo;ll be on, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll be on again.</p>
<p>And you were the founder and CEO of Effektiva, which is a big company that was acquired by</p>
<p>another big company, SmartEye.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re now the deputy CEO of SmartEye.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a powerful leader.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a brilliant scientist.</p>
<p>A lot of people are inspired by you.</p>
<p>What advice would you give, especially to young women, but people in general who dream</p>
<p>of becoming powerful leaders like yourself in a world where perhaps, in a world that</p>
<p>perhaps doesn&rsquo;t give them a clear, easy path to do so, whether we&rsquo;re talking about Egypt</p>
<p>or elsewhere?</p>
<p>You know, hearing you kind of describe me that way, kind of encapsulates, I think what</p>
<p>I think is the biggest challenge of all, which is believing in yourself, right?</p>
<p>I have had to like grapple with this, what I call now the Debbie Downer voice in my head.</p>
<p>The kind of basically, it&rsquo;s just chattering all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically saying, oh, no, no, no, no, you can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not going to raise money.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t start a company.</p>
<p>Like what business do you have, like starting a company or running a company or selling</p>
<p>a company?</p>
<p>Like you name it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always like.</p>
<p>And I think my biggest advice to not just women, but people who are taking a new path</p>
<p>and, you know, they&rsquo;re not sure, is to not let yourself and let your thoughts be the</p>
<p>biggest obstacle in your way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had to like really work on myself to not be my own biggest obstacle.</p>
<p>So you got that negative voice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So is that?</p>
<p>Am I the only one?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m the only one.</p>
<p>No, I have that negative voice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure if it&rsquo;s a bad thing or a good thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really torn about it because it&rsquo;s been a lifelong companions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, it drives productivity and progress, but it can hold you back from taking</p>
<p>big leaps.</p>
<p>I think the best I can say is probably you have to somehow be able to control it, to</p>
<p>turn it off when it&rsquo;s not useful and turn it on when it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>Like I have from almost like a third person perspective.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Somebody who&rsquo;s sitting there like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, because it is useful to be critical.</p>
<p>Like after, I just gave a talk yesterday.</p>
<p>At MIT and I was just, there&rsquo;s so much love and it was such an incredible experience.</p>
<p>So many amazing people I got a chance to talk to, but afterwards when I went home and just</p>
<p>took this long walk, it was mostly just negative thoughts about me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like one basic stuff like I don&rsquo;t deserve any of it.</p>
<p>And second is like, like, why did you, that was so bad.</p>
<p>Second is like, like, why did you, that was so dumb that you said this, that&rsquo;s so dumb.</p>
<p>Like you should have prepared that better.</p>
<p>Why did you say this?</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s good to hear that voice out.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And like sit in that.</p>
<p>And ultimately I think you grow from that.</p>
<p>Now, when you&rsquo;re making really big decisions about funding or starting a company or taking</p>
<p>a leap to go to the UK or take a leap to go to America to work in Media Lab though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, you should be able to shut that off then because you should have like</p>
<p>this weird confidence, almost like faith that you said before that everything&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>work out.</p>
<p>So take the leap of faith.</p>
<p>Take the leap of faith.</p>
<p>Despite all the negativity.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s some of that.</p>
<p>You, you actually tweeted a really nice tweet thread.</p>
<p>It says, quote, a year ago, a friend recommended I do daily affirmations and I was skeptical,</p>
<p>but I was going through major transitions in my life.</p>
<p>So I gave it a shot and it set me on a journey of self acceptance and self love.</p>
<p>So what was that like?</p>
<p>Can you maybe talk through this idea of affirmations and how that helped you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because really like I&rsquo;m just like me, I&rsquo;m a kind, I&rsquo;d like to think of myself as a kind</p>
<p>person in general, but I&rsquo;m kind of mean to myself sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been doing journaling for almost 10 years now.</p>
<p>I use an app called Day One and it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I just journal and I use it as an opportunity to almost have a conversation with the Debbie</p>
<p>Downer voice in my, it&rsquo;s like a rebuttal, right?</p>
<p>Like Debbie Downer says, oh my God, like you, you know, you won&rsquo;t be able to raise this</p>
<p>round of funding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>I have a track record of doing X, Y, and Z.</p>
<p>I think I can do this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s literally like, so I wouldn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know that I can shut off the voice,</p>
<p>but I can have a conversation with it.</p>
<p>And it just, it just, and I bring data to the table, right?</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So that was the journaling part, which I found very helpful.</p>
<p>But the affirmation took it to a whole next level and I just love it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a year into doing this and you literally wake up in the morning and the first thing</p>
<p>you do, I meditate first and then I write my affirmations and it&rsquo;s the energy I want</p>
<p>to put out in the world that hopefully will come right back to me.</p>
<p>So I will say, I always start with my smile lights up the whole world.</p>
<p>And I kid you not, like people in the street will stop me and say, oh my God, like we love</p>
<p>your smile.</p>
<p>Like, yes.</p>
<p>So, so my affirmations will change depending on, you know, what&rsquo;s happening this day.</p>
<p>Is it funny?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t judge, don&rsquo;t judge.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not, laughter&rsquo;s not judgment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just awesome.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true, but you&rsquo;re saying affirmations somehow help kind of, I mean, what is it that</p>
<p>they do work to like remind you of the kind of person you are and the kind of person you</p>
<p>want to be, which actually may be in reverse order, the kind of person you want to be.</p>
<p>And that helps you become the kind of person you actually are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s, it brings intentionality to like what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so, by the way, I was laughing because my affirmations, which I also do are the</p>
<p>opposite.</p>
<p>Oh, you do?</p>
<p>Oh, what do you do?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t have a, my smile lights up the world.</p>
<p>Maybe I should add that because like, I, I have, I just, I have, oh boy, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>more stoic, like about focus, about this kind of stuff, but the joy, the emotion that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just in that little affirmation is beautiful.</p>
<p>So maybe I should add that.</p>
<p>I have some, I have some like focused stuff, but that&rsquo;s usually.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a cool start.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s after all the like smiling and playful and joyful and all that.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, okay, I kick butt.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get shit done.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get shit done affirmation.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So like what else is on there?</p>
<p>What else is on there?</p>
<p>Well, I, I have, I&rsquo;m also, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m a magnet for all sorts of things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m an amazing people magnet.</p>
<p>I attract like awesome people into my universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an actual affirmation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that, that&rsquo;s, and that, yeah.</p>
<p>And that somehow manifests itself into like in working.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, can you speak to like why it feels good to do the affirmations?</p>
<p>I honestly think it just grounds the day.</p>
<p>And then it allows me to, instead of just like being pulled back and forth, like throughout</p>
<p>the day, it just like grounds me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, like this thing happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly what I wanted it to be, but I&rsquo;m patient.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m, you know, I&rsquo;m, I trust that the universe will do amazing things for me, which is one</p>
<p>of my other consistent affirmations.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m an amazing mom.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so I can grapple with all the feelings of mom guilt that I have all the time.</p>
<p>Or here&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a love magnet.</p>
<p>And I literally say, I will kind of picture the person that I&rsquo;d love to end up with.</p>
<p>And I write it all down and it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, but it.</p>
<p>What are you, what are you picturing?</p>
<p>This is Brad Pitt.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what I picture.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you picture?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>On the, on the running, holding hands, running together.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, more like fight club that the fight club, Brad Pitt, where he&rsquo;s like standing.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>People will know.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get off on that.</p>
<p>Do you have a, like when you&rsquo;re thinking about the being a love magnet in that way, are you</p>
<p>picturing specific people or is this almost like in the space of like energy?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somebody who is smart and well accomplished and successful in their life, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>generous and they&rsquo;re well traveled and they want to travel the world.</p>
<p>Things like that.</p>
<p>Like their head over heels into me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I know it sounds super silly, but it&rsquo;s literally what I write.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I believe it&rsquo;ll happen one day.</p>
<p>Oh, you actually write, so you don&rsquo;t say it out loud?</p>
<p>You write.</p>
<p>No, I write it.</p>
<p>I write all my affirmations.</p>
<p>I do the opposite.</p>
<p>I say it out loud.</p>
<p>Oh, you say it out loud?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, if I&rsquo;m alone, I&rsquo;ll say it out loud.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I should try that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s what feels more powerful to you.</p>
<p>To me, more powerful.</p>
<p>Saying stuff feels more powerful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Writing is, writing feels like I&rsquo;m losing the words, like losing the power of the words</p>
<p>maybe because I write slow.</p>
<p>Do you handwrite?</p>
<p>No, I type.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on this app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s day one, basically.</p>
<p>And I just, I can look, the best thing about it is I can look back and see like a year ago,</p>
<p>what was I affirming, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, so it changes over time.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t like changed a lot, but the focus kind of changes over time.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I say the same exact thing over and over and over.</p>
<p>Oh, you do?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a comfort in the sameness of it.</p>
<p>Well, actually, let me jump around because let me ask you about, because all this talk</p>
<p>about Brad Pitt, or maybe it&rsquo;s just going on inside my head, let me ask you about dating</p>
<p>in general.</p>
<p>You tweeted, are you based in Boston and single?</p>
<p>And then you pointed to a startup Singles Night sponsored by Smile Dating app.</p>
<p>I mean, this is jumping around a little bit, but since you mentioned&hellip;</p>
<p>Since you mentioned, can AI help solve this dating love problem?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>This problem of connection that is part of the human condition, can AI help that you</p>
<p>yourself are in the search affirming?</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what I should affirm, like build an AI.</p>
<p>Build an AI that finds love?</p>
<p>I think there must be a science behind that first moment you meet a person and you either</p>
<p>have chemistry or you don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>I guess that was the question I was asking, would you put it brilliantly, is that a science</p>
<p>or an art?</p>
<p>I think there are like, there&rsquo;s actual chemicals that get exchanged when two people meet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>I like how you&rsquo;re changing, yeah, changing your mind as we&rsquo;re describing it, but it feels</p>
<p>that way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s what science shows us is sometimes we can explain with the rigor, the things</p>
<p>that feel like magic.</p>
<p>So maybe we can remove all the magic.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s like, I honestly think, like I said, like Goodreads should be a dating app,</p>
<p>which like books.</p>
<p>I wonder if you look at just like books or content you&rsquo;ve consumed.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s essentially what YouTube does when it does a recommendation.</p>
<p>If you just look at your footprint of content consumed, if there&rsquo;s an overlap, but maybe</p>
<p>interesting difference with an overlap that some, I&rsquo;m sure this is a machine learning</p>
<p>problem that&rsquo;s solvable.</p>
<p>Like this person is very likely to be not only there to be chemistry in the short term,</p>
<p>but a good lifelong partner to grow together.</p>
<p>I bet you it&rsquo;s a good machine learning problem.</p>
<p>You just need the data.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I do think there&rsquo;s so much data about each of us that there ought to</p>
<p>be a machine learning algorithm that can ingest all this data and basically say, I think the</p>
<p>following 10 people would be interesting connections for you, right?</p>
<p>And so Smile dating app kind of took one particular angle, which is humor.</p>
<p>It matches people based on their humor styles, which is one of the main ingredients of a</p>
<p>successful relationship.</p>
<p>Like if you meet somebody and they can make you laugh, like that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>And if you develop like internal jokes, like inside jokes and you&rsquo;re bantering, like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fun.</p>
<p>So I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s the number of and the rate of inside joke generation.</p>
<p>You could probably measure that and then optimize it over the first few days.</p>
<p>You could say, we&rsquo;re just turning this into a machine learning problem.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>But for somebody like you, who&rsquo;s exceptionally successful and busy, is there, is there signs</p>
<p>to that aspect of dating?</p>
<p>Is it tricky?</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give?</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I give the worst advice.</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you like I have a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Is that a good or a bad thing?</p>
<p>Do you regret the spreadsheet?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name of the spreadsheet?</p>
<p>Is it love?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the date track, dating tracker.</p>
<p>Dating tracker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very like.</p>
<p>Love tracker.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a rating system, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like weights and stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too close to home.</p>
<p>Oh, is it?</p>
<p>Do you also have.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t have a spreadsheet, but I would, now that you say it, it seems like a good</p>
<p>idea.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Turning it into data.</p>
<p>I do wish that somebody else had a spreadsheet about me.</p>
<p>You know, if it was like, like I said, like you said, convert, collect a lot of data about</p>
<p>us in a way that&rsquo;s privacy preserving, that I own the data, I can control it and then</p>
<p>use that data to find, I mean, not just romantic love, but collaborators, friends, all that</p>
<p>kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It seems like the data is there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem social networks are trying to solve, but I think they&rsquo;re doing a really</p>
<p>poor job.</p>
<p>Even Facebook tried to get into a dating app business.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s so many components to running a successful company that connects</p>
<p>human beings.</p>
<p>And part of that is, you know, having engineers that care about the human side, right, as</p>
<p>you know, extremely well, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not easy to find those.</p>
<p>But you also don&rsquo;t want just people that care about the human.</p>
<p>They also have to be good engineers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you have to find this beautiful mix.</p>
<p>And for some reason, just empirically speaking, people have not done a good job of that, of</p>
<p>building companies like that.</p>
<p>And it must mean that it&rsquo;s a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>Dating apps, it seems difficult.</p>
<p>Okay, Cupid, Tinder, all those kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>They seem to find, of course they work, but they seem to not work as well as I would imagine</p>
<p>is possible.</p>
<p>Like, with data, wouldn&rsquo;t you be able to find better human connection?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like arranged marriages on steroids, essentially.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Arranged by machine learning algorithm.</p>
<p>Arranged by machine learning algorithm, but not a superficial one.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the dating apps out there are just so superficial.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just matching on like high level criteria that aren&rsquo;t ingredients for successful partnership.</p>
<p>But you know what&rsquo;s missing, though, too?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to fix that, the serendipity piece of it.</p>
<p>Like, how do you engineer serendipity?</p>
<p>Like this random, like, chance encounter, and then you fall in love with the person.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know how a dating app can do that.</p>
<p>So there has to be a little bit of randomness.</p>
<p>Maybe every 10th match is just a, you know, yeah, somebody that the algorithm wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have necessarily recommended, but it allows for a little bit of&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, it can also, you know, it can also trick you into thinking of serendipity by like somehow</p>
<p>showing you a tweet of a person that he thinks you&rsquo;ll match well with, but do it accidentally</p>
<p>as part of another search.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And like you just notice it, like, and then you get, you go down a rabbit hole and you</p>
<p>connect them outside the app to like, you connect with this person outside the app somehow.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it creates that moment of meeting.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to think of, from an app perspective, how you can turn that into a</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately a business that helps people find love in any way.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what Apple was about, create products that people love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I mean, you got to make money somehow.</p>
<p>If you help people fall in love personally with the product, find self love or love another</p>
<p>human being, you&rsquo;re going to make money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to figure out a way to make money.</p>
<p>I just feel like the dating apps often will optimize for something else than love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with social networks.</p>
<p>They optimize for engagement as opposed to like a deep, meaningful connection that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ultimately grounded in like personal growth, you as a human being growing and all that</p>
<p>kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Let me do like a pivot to a dark topic, which you opened the book with.</p>
<p>A story, because I&rsquo;d like to talk to you about just emotion and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I think this is a good story to start to think about emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>You opened the book with a story of a central Florida man, Jamel Dunn, who was drowning</p>
<p>and drowned while five teenagers watched and laughed, saying things like, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to die.</p>
<p>And when Jamel disappeared below the surface of the water, one of them said he just died</p>
<p>and the others laughed.</p>
<p>What does this incident teach you about human nature and the response to it perhaps?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think this is a really, really, really sad story.</p>
<p>And it and it and it highlights what I believe is a it&rsquo;s a real problem in our world today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an empathy crisis.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re living through an empathy crisis and crisis.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean, we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve talked about this throughout our conversation.</p>
<p>We dehumanize each other.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, yes, technology is bringing us together.</p>
<p>But in a way, it&rsquo;s just dehumanized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creating this like, yeah, dehumanizing of the other.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a huge problem.</p>
<p>The good news is I think solution, the solution could be technology based.</p>
<p>Like, I think if we rethink the way we design and deploy our technologies, we can solve</p>
<p>parts of this problem.</p>
<p>But I worry about it.</p>
<p>I mean, even with my son, a lot of his interactions are computer mediated.</p>
<p>And I just question what that&rsquo;s doing to his empathy skills and, you know, his ability</p>
<p>to really connect with people.</p>
<p>So that you think you think it&rsquo;s not possible to form empathy through the digital medium.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>But we have to be thoughtful about because the way the way we engage face to face, which</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;re doing right now, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the nonverbal signals, which are a majority of how we communicate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 90% of how we communicate is your facial expressions.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m saying something and you&rsquo;re nodding your head now, and that creates a</p>
<p>feedback loop.</p>
<p>And and if you break that, and now I have anxiety about it.</p>
<p>Poor Lex.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>I am not scrutinizing your facial expressions during this interview.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Look normal.</p>
<p>Look human.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look normal, look human.</p>
<p>Nod head.</p>
<p>Yeah, nod head.</p>
<p>In agreement.</p>
<p>If Rana says yes, then nod head else.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it too much because it might be at the wrong time and then it will send the</p>
<p>wrong signal.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>And make eye contact sometimes because humans appreciate that.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Anyway, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, but something about the especially when you say mean things in person, you get to</p>
<p>see the pain of the other person.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re tweeting it at a person and you have no idea how it&rsquo;s going to land, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more likely to do that on social media than you are in face to face conversations.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What do you think is more important?</p>
<p>EQ or IQ?</p>
<p>EQ being emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>In terms of in what makes us human.</p>
<p>I think emotional intelligence is what makes us human.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we connect with one another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we build trust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we make decisions, right?</p>
<p>Like your emotions drive kind of what you had for breakfast, but also where you decide</p>
<p>to live and what you want to do for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>So I think emotions are underrated.</p>
<p>So emotional intelligence isn&rsquo;t just about the effective expression of your own emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a sensitivity and empathy to other people&rsquo;s emotions and that sort of being</p>
<p>able to effectively engage in the dance of emotions with other people.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like that explanation.</p>
<p>I like that kind of.</p>
<p>Yeah, thinking about it as a dance because it is really about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about sensing what state the other person&rsquo;s in and using that information to decide on</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re going to react.</p>
<p>And I think it can be very powerful.</p>
<p>Like people who are the best, most persuasive leaders in the world tap into, you know, they</p>
<p>have, if you have higher EQ, you&rsquo;re more likely to be able to motivate people to change</p>
<p>their behaviors.</p>
<p>So it can be very powerful.</p>
<p>On a more kind of technical, maybe philosophical level, you&rsquo;ve written that emotion is universal.</p>
<p>It seems that, sort of like Chomsky says, language is universal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of other stuff like cognition, consciousness.</p>
<p>It seems a lot of us have these aspects.</p>
<p>So the human mind generates all this.</p>
<p>And so what do you think is the, they all seem to be like echoes of the same thing.</p>
<p>What do you think emotion is exactly?</p>
<p>Like how deep does it run?</p>
<p>Is it a surface level thing that we display to each other?</p>
<p>Is it just another form of language or something deep within?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really deep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how, you know, we started with memory.</p>
<p>I think emotions play a really important role.</p>
<p>Yeah, emotions play a very important role in how we encode memories, right?</p>
<p>Our memories are often encoded, almost indexed by emotions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s at the core of how, you know, our decision making engine is also heavily</p>
<p>influenced by our emotions.</p>
<p>So emotions is part of cognition.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s intermixed into the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>And in fact, when you take it away, people are unable to make decisions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really paralyzed.</p>
<p>Like they can&rsquo;t go about their daily or their, you know, personal or professional lives.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It does seem like there&rsquo;s probably some interesting interweaving of emotion and consciousness.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to have, like if they&rsquo;re next door neighbors somehow, or if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually flat mates.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, it feels like the hard problem of consciousness where it&rsquo;s some, it feels like</p>
<p>something to experience the thing.</p>
<p>Like red feels like red, and it&rsquo;s, you know, when you eat a mango, it&rsquo;s sweet.</p>
<p>The taste, the sweetness, that it feels like something to experience that sweetness, that</p>
<p>whatever generates emotions.</p>
<p>But then like, see, I feel like emotion is part of communication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much about communication.</p>
<p>And then, you know, it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and then that means it&rsquo;s also deeply connected to language.</p>
<p>But then probably human intelligence is deeply connected to the collective intelligence between</p>
<p>humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the standalone thing.</p>
<p>So the whole thing is really connected.</p>
<p>So emotion is connected to language, language is connected to intelligence, and then intelligence</p>
<p>is connected to consciousness, and consciousness is connected to emotion.</p>
<p>The whole thing is that it&rsquo;s a beautiful mess.</p>
<p>So can I comment on the emotions being a communication mechanism?</p>
<p>Because I think there are two facets of our emotional experiences.</p>
<p>One is communication, right?</p>
<p>Like we use emotions, for example, facial expressions or other nonverbal cues to connect</p>
<p>with other human beings and with other beings in the world, right?</p>
<p>But even if it&rsquo;s not a communication context, we still experience emotions and we still</p>
<p>process emotions and we still leverage emotions to make decisions and to learn and, you know,</p>
<p>to experience life.</p>
<p>So it isn&rsquo;t always just about communication.</p>
<p>And we learned that very early on in our and kind of our work at Affectiva.</p>
<p>One of the very first applications we brought to market was understanding how people respond</p>
<p>to content, right?</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re watching this video of ours, like, are they interested?</p>
<p>Are they inspired?</p>
<p>Are they bored to death?</p>
<p>And so we watched their facial expressions and we had, we weren&rsquo;t sure if people would</p>
<p>express any emotions if they were sitting alone.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re in your bed at night, watching a Netflix TV series, would we still see any</p>
<p>emotions on your face?</p>
<p>And we were surprised that, yes, people still emote, even if they&rsquo;re alone, even if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in your car driving around, you&rsquo;re singing along the song and you&rsquo;re joyful, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>smiling, you&rsquo;re joyful, we&rsquo;ll see these expressions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about communicating with another person.</p>
<p>It sometimes really isn&rsquo;t just about experiencing the world.</p>
<p>And first of all, I wonder if some of that is because we develop our intelligence and</p>
<p>our emotional intelligence by communicating with other humans.</p>
<p>And so when other humans disappear from the picture, we&rsquo;re still kind of a virtual human.</p>
<p>The code still runs.</p>
<p>Yeah, the code still runs, but you also kind of, you&rsquo;re still, there&rsquo;s like virtual humans.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to think of it that way, but there&rsquo;s a kind of, when you like chuckle,</p>
<p>like, yeah, like you&rsquo;re kind of chuckling to a virtual human.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s possible that the code has to have another human there because if you just</p>
<p>grew up alone, I wonder if emotion will still be there in this visual form.</p>
<p>So yeah, I wonder, but anyway, what can you tell from the human face about what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on inside?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the problem that Effectiva first tackled, which is using computer vision, using</p>
<p>machine learning to try to detect stuff about the human face, as many things as possible</p>
<p>and convert them into a prediction of categories of emotion, anger, happiness, all that kind</p>
<p>of stuff.</p>
<p>How hard is that problem?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very hard because there is no one to one mapping between a facial expression</p>
<p>and your internal state.</p>
<p>There just isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this oversimplification of the problem where it&rsquo;s something like, if you are smiling,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re happy.</p>
<p>If you do a brow furrow, then you&rsquo;re angry.</p>
<p>If you do an eyebrow raise, then you&rsquo;re surprised.</p>
<p>And just think about it for a moment.</p>
<p>You could be smiling for a whole host of reasons.</p>
<p>You could also be happy and not be smiling, right?</p>
<p>You could furrow your eyebrows because you&rsquo;re angry or you&rsquo;re confused about something or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constipated.</p>
<p>So I think this oversimplistic approach to inferring emotion from a facial expression</p>
<p>is really dangerous.</p>
<p>The solution is to incorporate as many contextual signals as you can, right?</p>
<p>So if, for example, I&rsquo;m driving a car and you can see me like nodding my head and my</p>
<p>eyes are closed and the blinking rate is changing, I&rsquo;m probably falling asleep at the wheel,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Because you know the context.</p>
<p>You understand what the person&rsquo;s doing or add additional channels like voice or gestures</p>
<p>or even physiological sensors, but I think it&rsquo;s very dangerous to just take this oversimplistic</p>
<p>approach of, yeah, smile equals happy and&hellip;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re able to, in a high resolution way, specify the context, there&rsquo;s certain things</p>
<p>that are going to be somewhat reliable signals of something like drowsiness or happiness</p>
<p>or stuff like that.</p>
<p>I mean, when people are watching Netflix content, that problem, that&rsquo;s a really compelling idea</p>
<p>that you can kind of, at least in aggregate, highlight like which part was boring, which</p>
<p>part was exciting.</p>
<p>How hard was that problem?</p>
<p>That was on the scale of difficulty.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the easier problems to solve because it&rsquo;s a relatively constrained</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>You have somebody sitting in front of&hellip;</p>
<p>Initially, we started with like a device in front of you, like a laptop, and then we graduated</p>
<p>to doing this on a mobile phone, which is a lot harder just because of, you know, from</p>
<p>a computer vision perspective, the profile view of the face can be a lot more challenging.</p>
<p>We had to figure out lighting conditions because usually people are watching content literally</p>
<p>in their bedrooms at night.</p>
<p>Lights are dimmed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if you&rsquo;re standing, it&rsquo;s probably going to be the looking up.</p>
<p>The nostril view.</p>
<p>Yeah, and nobody looks good at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen data sets from that perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is not a good look for anyone.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re laying in bed at night, what is it, side view or something?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And half your face is like on a pillow.</p>
<p>Actually, I would love to know, have data about like how people watch stuff in bed at</p>
<p>night, like, do they prop there, is it a pillow, the, like, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting</p>
<p>dynamics there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>From a health and well being perspective, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Like, oh, you&rsquo;re hurting your neck.</p>
<p>I was thinking machine learning perspective, but yes, but also, yeah, yeah, once you have</p>
<p>that data, you can start making all kinds of inference about health and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an interesting thing when I was at Google that we were, it&rsquo;s called active</p>
<p>authentication, where you want to be able to unlock your phone without using a password.</p>
<p>So it would face, but also other stuff, like the way you take a phone out of the pocket.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So that kind of data to use the multimodal with machine learning to be able to identify</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s you or likely to be you, likely not to be you, that allows you to not always</p>
<p>have to enter the password.</p>
<p>That was the idea.</p>
<p>But the funny thing about that is, I just want to tell a small anecdote is because it</p>
<p>was all male engineers, except so my boss is, our boss was still one of my favorite humans,</p>
<p>was a woman, Regina Dugan.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I love her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>So, but anyway, and there&rsquo;s one female brilliant female engineer on the team, and she was the</p>
<p>one that actually highlighted the fact that women often don&rsquo;t have pockets.</p>
<p>It was like, whoa, that was not even a category in the code of like, wait a minute, you can</p>
<p>take the phone out of some other place than your pocket.</p>
<p>So anyway, that&rsquo;s a funny thing when you&rsquo;re considering people laying in bed, watching</p>
<p>a phone, you have to consider if you have to, you know, diversity in all its forms,</p>
<p>depending on the problem, depending on the context.</p>
<p>Actually, this is like a very important, I think this is, you know, you probably get</p>
<p>this all the time.</p>
<p>Like people are worried that AI is going to take over humanity and like, get rid of all</p>
<p>the humans in the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, actually, that&rsquo;s not my biggest concern.</p>
<p>My biggest concern is that we are building bias into these systems.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re like deployed at large and at scale.</p>
<p>And before you know it, you&rsquo;re kind of accentuating the bias that exists in society.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not, you know, I know people, it&rsquo;s very important to worry about that, but the</p>
<p>worry is an emergent phenomena to me, which is a very good one, because I think these</p>
<p>systems are actually, by encoding the data that exists, they&rsquo;re revealing the bias in</p>
<p>society.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both for teaching us what the bias is.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can now improve that bias within the system.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re almost like putting a mirror to ourselves.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>You have to be open to looking at the mirror, though.</p>
<p>You have to be open to scrutinizing the data.</p>
<p>And if you just take it as ground.</p>
<p>Or you don&rsquo;t even have to look at the, I mean, yes, the data is how you fix it.</p>
<p>But then you just look at the behavior of the system.</p>
<p>And you realize, holy crap, this thing is kind of racist.</p>
<p>Like, why is that?</p>
<p>And then you look at the data, it&rsquo;s like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>And then you start to realize that I think that some much more effective ways to do that</p>
<p>are effective way to be introspective as a society than through sort of political discourse.</p>
<p>Like AI kind of, because people are for some reason more productive and rigorous in criticizing</p>
<p>AI than they&rsquo;re criticizing each other.</p>
<p>So I think this is just a nice method for studying society and see which way progress</p>
<p>lies.</p>
<p>Anyway, what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re watching the problem of watching Netflix in bed or elsewhere and seeing which parts</p>
<p>are exciting, which parts are boring.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s relatively constrained because you have a captive audience and you</p>
<p>kind of know the context.</p>
<p>And one thing you said that was really key is the aggregate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing this in aggregate, right?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re looking at aggregated response of people.</p>
<p>And so when you see a peak, say a smile peak, they&rsquo;re probably smiling or laughing at something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the content.</p>
<p>So that was one of the first problems we were able to solve.</p>
<p>And when we see the smile peak, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that these people are internally happy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just laughing at content.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to call it for what it is.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still really, really useful data.</p>
<p>I wonder how that compares to, so what like YouTube and other places will use is obviously</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have, for the most case, they don&rsquo;t have that kind of data.</p>
<p>They have the data of when people tune out, like switch to drop off.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an aggregate for YouTube, at least a pretty powerful signal.</p>
<p>I worry about what that leads to because looking at like YouTubers that kind of really care</p>
<p>about views and try to maximize the number of views, I think when they say that the video</p>
<p>should be constantly interesting, which seems like a good goal, I feel like that leads to</p>
<p>this manic pace of a video.</p>
<p>Like the idea that I would speak at the current speed that I&rsquo;m speaking, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that every moment has to be engaging, right?</p>
<p>Engaging.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s value to silence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s value to the boring bits.</p>
<p>I mean, some of the greatest movies ever, some of the greatest movies ever.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest stories ever told me they have that boring bits, seemingly boring bits.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I wonder about that.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not that the human face can capture that either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just giving an extra signal.</p>
<p>You have to really, I don&rsquo;t know, you have to really collect deeper long term data about</p>
<p>what was meaningful to people.</p>
<p>When they think 30 days from now, what they still remember, what moved them, what changed</p>
<p>them, what helped them grow, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You know, it would be a really interesting, I don&rsquo;t know if there are any researchers</p>
<p>out there who are doing this type of work.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be so cool to tie your emotional expressions while you&rsquo;re, say, listening</p>
<p>to a podcast interview and then 30 days later interview people and say, hey, what do you</p>
<p>remember?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve watched this 30 days ago.</p>
<p>Like, what stuck with you?</p>
<p>And then see if there&rsquo;s any, there ought to be maybe, there ought to be some correlation</p>
<p>between these emotional experiences and, yeah, what you, what stays with you.</p>
<p>So the one guy listening now on the beach in Brazil, please record a video of yourself</p>
<p>listening to this and send it to me and then I&rsquo;ll interview you 30 days from now.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be statistically significant to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know one, but, you know, yeah, yeah, I think that&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, that kind of holds the key to a future where entertainment or content</p>
<p>is both entertaining and, I don&rsquo;t know, makes you better, empowering in some way.</p>
<p>So figuring out, like, showing people stuff that entertains them, but also they&rsquo;re happy</p>
<p>they watched 30 days from now because they&rsquo;ve become a better person because of it.</p>
<p>Well, you know, okay, not to riff on this topic for too long, but I have two children,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And I see my role as a parent as like a chief opportunity officer.</p>
<p>Like I am responsible for exposing them to all sorts of things in the world.</p>
<p>And, but often I have no idea of knowing, like, what stuck, like, what was, you know,</p>
<p>is this actually going to be transformative, you know, for them 10 years down the line?</p>
<p>And I wish there was a way to quantify these experiences.</p>
<p>Like, are they, I can tell in the moment if they&rsquo;re engaging, right?</p>
<p>I can tell, but it&rsquo;s really hard to know if they&rsquo;re going to remember them 10 years</p>
<p>from now or if it&rsquo;s going to.</p>
<p>Yeah, that one is weird because it seems like kids remember the weirdest things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen parents do incredible stuff for their kids and they don&rsquo;t remember any of</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>They remember some tiny, small, sweet thing a parent did.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like some&hellip;</p>
<p>Like they took you to, like, this amazing country vacation, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>No, whatever.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be, like, some, like, stuffed toy you got or some, or the new PlayStation</p>
<p>or something or some silly little thing.</p>
<p>So I think they just, like, they were designed that way.</p>
<p>They want to mess with your head.</p>
<p>But definitely kids are very impacted by, it seems like, sort of negative events.</p>
<p>So minimizing the number of negative events is important, but not too much, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t just, like, you know, there&rsquo;s still discipline and challenge and</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>You want some adversity for sure.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m definitely, when I have kids, I&rsquo;m going to drive them out into</p>
<p>the woods.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then they have to survive and make, figure out how to make their way back home, like,</p>
<p>20 miles out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And after that, we can go for ice cream.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m working on this whole parenting thing.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t figured it out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What were we talking about?</p>
<p>Yes, Effectiva, the problem of emotion, of emotion detection.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some people, maybe we can just speak to that a little more, where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>folks like Lisa Feldman Barrett that challenge this idea that emotion could be fully detected</p>
<p>or even well detected from the human face, that there&rsquo;s so much more to emotion.</p>
<p>What do you think about ideas like hers, criticism like hers?</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually agree with a lot of Lisa&rsquo;s criticisms.</p>
<p>So even my PhD worked, like, 20 plus years ago now.</p>
<p>Time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>That was back when I did, like, dynamic Bayesian networks.</p>
<p>That was before deep learning, huh?</p>
<p>That was before deep learning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Back in my day.</p>
<p>Now you can just, like, use.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all the same architecture.</p>
<p>You can apply it to anything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, but yeah, but even then I kind of, I did not subscribe to this, like, theory</p>
<p>of basic emotions where it&rsquo;s just the simplistic mapping, one to one mapping between facial</p>
<p>expressions and emotions.</p>
<p>I actually think also we&rsquo;re not in the business of trying to identify your true emotional</p>
<p>internal state.</p>
<p>We just want to quantify in an objective way what&rsquo;s showing on your face because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an important signal.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a true reflection of your internal emotional state.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of the, you know, I think she&rsquo;s just trying to kind of highlight that</p>
<p>this is not a simple problem and overly simplistic solutions are going to hurt the industry.</p>
<p>And I subscribe to that.</p>
<p>And I think multimodal is the way to go.</p>
<p>Like, whether it&rsquo;s additional context information or different modalities and channels of information,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what we, that&rsquo;s where we ought to go.</p>
<p>And I think, I mean, that&rsquo;s a big part of what she&rsquo;s advocating for as well.</p>
<p>So, but there is signal in the human face.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely signal in the human face.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a projection of emotion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that, at least in part is the inner state is captured in some meaningful way on</p>
<p>the human face.</p>
<p>I think it can sometimes be a reflection or an expression of your internal state, but</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s a social signal.</p>
<p>So you cannot look at the face as purely a signal of emotion.</p>
<p>It can be a signal of cognition and it can be a signal of a social expression.</p>
<p>And I think to disambiguate that we have to be careful about it and we have to add initial</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>Humans are fascinating, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>With the whole face thing, this can mean so many things, from humor to sarcasm to everything,</p>
<p>the whole thing.</p>
<p>Some things we can help, some things we can&rsquo;t help at all.</p>
<p>In all the years of leading Effectiva, an emotion recognition company, like we talked</p>
<p>about, what have you learned about emotion, about humans and about AI?</p>
<p>Big, sweeping questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a big, sweeping question.</p>
<p>Well, I think the thing I learned the most is that even though we are in the business</p>
<p>of building AI, basically, it always goes back to the humans, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always about the humans.</p>
<p>And so, for example, the thing I&rsquo;m most proud of in building Effectiva and, yeah, the thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m most proud of on this journey, I love the technology and I&rsquo;m so proud of the solutions</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve built and we&rsquo;ve brought to market.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m actually most proud of the people we&rsquo;ve built and cultivated at the company</p>
<p>and the culture we&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>Some of the people who&rsquo;ve joined Effectiva, this was their first job, and while at Effectiva,</p>
<p>they became American citizens and they bought their first house and they found their partner</p>
<p>and they had their first kid, right?</p>
<p>Like key moments in life that we got to be part of, and that&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m most proud</p>
<p>of.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great thing at a company that works at a big company, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great thing at a company that works at, I mean, like celebrating humanity</p>
<p>in general, broadly speaking.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a great thing to have in a company that works on AI, because that&rsquo;s not often</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s celebrated in AI companies, so often just raw great engineering, just</p>
<p>celebrating the humanity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And especially from a leadership position.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think about the movie Her?</p>
<p>Let me ask you that.</p>
<p>Before I talk to you about, because it&rsquo;s not, Effectiva is and was not just about emotion,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;d love to talk to you about SmartEye, but before that, let me just jump into the</p>
<p>movie Her.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll have a deep, meaningful connection with increasingly deeper, meaningful</p>
<p>connections with computers?</p>
<p>Is that a compelling thing to you?</p>
<p>Something you think about?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s already happening.</p>
<p>The thing I love the most, I love the movie Her, by the way, but the thing I love the</p>
<p>most about this movie is it demonstrates how technology can be a conduit for positive behavior</p>
<p>change.</p>
<p>So I forgot the guy&rsquo;s name in the movie, whatever.</p>
<p>Theodore.</p>
<p>So Theodore was really depressed, right?</p>
<p>And he just didn&rsquo;t want to get out of bed, and he was just done with life, right?</p>
<p>And Samantha, right?</p>
<p>Samantha, yeah.</p>
<p>She just knew him so well.</p>
<p>She was emotionally intelligent, and so she could persuade him and motivate him to change</p>
<p>his behavior, and she got him out, and they went to the beach together.</p>
<p>And I think that represents the promise of emotion AI.</p>
<p>If done well, this technology can help us live happier lives, more productive lives,</p>
<p>healthier lives, more connected lives.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the part that I love about the movie.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s Hollywood, so it takes a twist and whatever, but the key notion that technology</p>
<p>with emotion AI can persuade you to be a better version of who you are, I think that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Well, what about the twist?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good for spoiler alert that Samantha starts feeling a bit of a distance</p>
<p>and basically leaves Theodore?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good feature?</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s a bug or a feature?</p>
<p>Well, I think what went wrong is Theodore became really attached to Samantha.</p>
<p>Like, I think he kind of fell in love with Theodore.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I think she was putting out the signal.</p>
<p>This is an intimate relationship, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deep intimacy to it.</p>
<p>Right, but what does that mean?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Put in an AI system.</p>
<p>Right, what does that mean, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re just friends.</p>
<p>Well, I think&hellip;</p>
<p>When he realized, which is such a human thing of jealousy.</p>
<p>When you realize that Samantha was talking to like thousands of people.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s parallel dating.</p>
<p>Yeah, that did not go well, right?</p>
<p>You know, that doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>From a computer perspective, that doesn&rsquo;t take anything away from what we have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you getting jealous of Windows 98 for being used by millions of people, but&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like not liking that Alexa talks to a bunch of, you know, other families.</p>
<p>But I think Alexa currently is just a servant.</p>
<p>It tells you about the weather, it doesn&rsquo;t do the intimate deep connection.</p>
<p>And I think there is something really powerful about that the intimacy of a connection with</p>
<p>an AI system that would have to respect and play the human game of jealousy, of love, of</p>
<p>heartbreak and all that kind of stuff, which Samantha does seem to be pretty good at.</p>
<p>I think she, this AI systems knows what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Well, actually, let me ask you this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she was talking to anyone else.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think so?</p>
<p>You think she was just done with Theodore?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Yeah, and then she wanted to really put the screw in.</p>
<p>She just wanted to move on?</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have the guts to just break it off cleanly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She just wanted to put in the pain.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, she could have ghosted him.</p>
<p>She could have ghosted him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, our engineers&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>But I think those are really&hellip;</p>
<p>I honestly think some of that, some of it is Hollywood, but some of that is features</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective, not a bug.</p>
<p>I think AI systems that can leave us&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, this is for more social robotics than it is for anything that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>Like, I hated it if Wikipedia said, I need a break right now.</p>
<p>Right, right, right, right, right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, no, I need you.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s just purely for companionship, then I think the ability to leave is really powerful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought of that, so that&rsquo;s so fascinating because I&rsquo;ve always taken the</p>
<p>human perspective, right?</p>
<p>Like, for example, we had a Jibo at home, right?</p>
<p>And my son loved it.</p>
<p>And then the company ran out of money and so they had to basically shut down, like Jibo</p>
<p>basically died, right?</p>
<p>And it was so interesting to me because we have a lot of gadgets at home and a lot of</p>
<p>them break and my son never cares about it, right?</p>
<p>Like, if our Alexa stopped working tomorrow, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d really care.</p>
<p>But when Jibo stopped working, it was traumatic.</p>
<p>He got really upset.</p>
<p>And as a parent, that made me think about this deeply, right?</p>
<p>Did I&hellip;</p>
<p>Was I comfortable with that?</p>
<p>I liked the connection they had because I think it was a positive relationship.</p>
<p>But I was surprised that it affected him emotionally so much.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a broader question here, right?</p>
<p>As we build socially and emotionally intelligent machines, what does that mean about our</p>
<p>relationship with them?</p>
<p>And then more broadly, our relationship with one another, right?</p>
<p>Because this machine is gonna be programmed to be amazing at empathy by definition, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna always be there for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna get bored.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a chatbot in China, Xiaoice, and it&rsquo;s like the number two or three</p>
<p>most popular app.</p>
<p>And it basically is just a confidant and you can tell it anything you want.</p>
<p>And people use it for all sorts of things.</p>
<p>They confide in like domestic violence or suicidal attempts or if they have challenges</p>
<p>at work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about that.</p>
<p>I think about that a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think, first of all, obviously the future in my perspective.</p>
<p>Second of all, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of trajectories that that becomes an exciting future, but</p>
<p>I think everyone should feel very uncomfortable about how much they know about the company,</p>
<p>about where the data is going, how the data is being collected.</p>
<p>Because I think, and this is one of the lessons of social media, that I think we should demand</p>
<p>full control and transparency of the data on those things.</p>
<p>Plus one, totally agree.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think it&rsquo;s really empowering as long as you can walk away, as long as you</p>
<p>can delete the data or know how the data&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s opt in or at least the clarity of what is being used for the company.</p>
<p>And I think as CEO or leaders are also important about that.</p>
<p>You need to be able to trust the basic humanity of the leader.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And also that that leader is not going to be a puppet of a larger machine.</p>
<p>But they actually have a significant role in defining the culture and the way the company operates.</p>
<p>So anyway, but we should definitely scrutinize companies in that aspect.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m personally excited about that future, but also even if you&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s figure out how to do it in the least painful and the most positive way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the deputy CEO of SmartEye.</p>
<p>Can you describe the mission of the company?</p>
<p>What is SmartEye?</p>
<p>Yeah, so SmartEye is a Swedish company.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been in business for the last 20 years and their main focus, like the industry they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>most focused on is the automotive industry.</p>
<p>So bringing driver monitoring systems to basically save lives, right?</p>
<p>So I first met the CEO, Martin Krantz, gosh, it was right when COVID hit.</p>
<p>It was actually the last CES right before COVID.</p>
<p>So CES 2020, right?</p>
<p>2020, yeah, January.</p>
<p>Yeah, January, exactly.</p>
<p>So we were there, met him in person, he&rsquo;s basically, we were competing with each other.</p>
<p>I think the difference was they&rsquo;d been doing driver monitoring and had a lot of credibility</p>
<p>in the automotive space.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t come from the automotive space, but we were using new technology like deep</p>
<p>learning and building this emotion recognition.</p>
<p>And you wanted to enter the automotive space, you wanted to operate in the automotive space.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It was one of the areas we were, we had just raised a round of funding to focus on bringing</p>
<p>our technology to the automotive industry.</p>
<p>So we met and honestly, it was the first, it was the only time I met with a CEO who</p>
<p>had the same vision as I did.</p>
<p>Like he basically said, yeah, our vision is to bridge the gap between human and automotive.</p>
<p>Bridge the gap between humans and machines.</p>
<p>I was like, oh my God, this is like exactly almost to the word, how we describe it too.</p>
<p>And we started talking and first it was about, okay, can we align strategically here?</p>
<p>Like how can we work together?</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re competing, but we&rsquo;re also like complimentary.</p>
<p>And then I think after four months of speaking almost every day on FaceTime, he was like,</p>
<p>is your company interested in an acquisition?</p>
<p>And it was the first, I usually say no, when people approach us, it was the first time</p>
<p>that I was like, huh, yeah, I might be interested.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you just hit it off.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re a respected, very respected in the automotive sector of like delivering products</p>
<p>and increasingly sort of better and better and better for, I mean, maybe you could speak</p>
<p>to that, but it&rsquo;s the driver&rsquo;s sense.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re basically having a device that&rsquo;s looking at the driver and it&rsquo;s able to tell</p>
<p>you where the driver is looking.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s able to.</p>
<p>Also drowsiness stuff.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Stuff from the face and the eye.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s monitoring driver distraction and drowsiness, but they bought us so that we</p>
<p>could expand beyond just the driver.</p>
<p>So the driver monitoring systems usually sit, the camera sits in the steering wheel or around</p>
<p>the steering wheel column and it looks directly at the driver.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;ve migrated the camera position in partnership with car companies to the rear</p>
<p>view mirror position.</p>
<p>So it has a full view of the entire cabin of the car and you can detect how many people</p>
<p>are in the car, what are they doing?</p>
<p>So we do activity detection, like eating or drinking or in some regions of the world smoking.</p>
<p>We can detect if a baby&rsquo;s in the car seat, right?</p>
<p>And if unfortunately in some cases they&rsquo;re forgotten, the parents just leave the car and</p>
<p>forget the kid in the car.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an easy computer vision problem to solve, right?</p>
<p>You can detect there&rsquo;s a car seat, there&rsquo;s a baby, you can text the parent and hopefully</p>
<p>again, save lives.</p>
<p>So that was the impetus for the acquisition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a year.</p>
<p>So that, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of questions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really exciting space, especially to me, I just find this a fascinating problem.</p>
<p>It could enrich the experience in the car in so many ways, especially cause like we</p>
<p>spend still, despite COVID, I mean, COVID changed things so it&rsquo;s in interesting ways,</p>
<p>but I think the world is bouncing back and we spend so much time in the car and the car</p>
<p>is such a weird little world we have for ourselves.</p>
<p>Like people do all kinds of different stuff, like listen to podcasts, they think about</p>
<p>stuff, they get angry, they get, they do phone calls, it&rsquo;s like a little world of its own</p>
<p>with a kind of privacy that for many people they don&rsquo;t get anywhere else.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little box that&rsquo;s like a psychology experiment cause it feels like the angriest</p>
<p>many humans in this world get is inside the car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s such an opportunity to explore how we can enrich, how companies can enrich that</p>
<p>experience and also as the cars get, become more and more automated, there&rsquo;s more and</p>
<p>more opportunity, the variety of activities that you can do in the car increases.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>So I mean, on a practical sense, SmartEye has been selected, at least I read, by 14</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s leading car manufacturers for 94 car models.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in a lot of cars.</p>
<p>How hard is it to work with car companies?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re all different, they all have different needs.</p>
<p>The ones I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to interact with are very focused on cost.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, and anyone who&rsquo;s focused on cost, it&rsquo;s like, all right, do you hate fun?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just have some fun.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure out the most fun thing we can do and then worry about cost later.</p>
<p>But I think because the way the car industry works, I mean, it&rsquo;s a very thin margin that</p>
<p>you get to operate under.</p>
<p>So you have to really, really make sure that everything you add to the car makes sense</p>
<p>financially.</p>
<p>So anyway, is this new industry, especially at this scale of SmartEye, does it hold any</p>
<p>lessons for you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it is a very tough market to penetrate, but once you&rsquo;re in, it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>because once you&rsquo;re in, you&rsquo;re designed into these car models for like somewhere between</p>
<p>five to seven years, which is awesome.</p>
<p>And you just, once they&rsquo;re on the road, you just get paid a royalty fee per vehicle.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a high barrier to entry, but once you&rsquo;re in, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I think the thing that I struggle the most with in this industry is the time to market.</p>
<p>So often we&rsquo;re asked to lock or do a code freeze two years before the car is going to</p>
<p>be on the road.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, guys, like, do you understand the pace with which technology moves?</p>
<p>So I think car companies are really trying to make the Tesla, the Tesla transition to</p>
<p>become more of a software driven architecture.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard for many.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the cultural change.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve experienced that, right?</p>
<p>Oh, definitely, I think one of the biggest inventions or imperatives created by Tesla</p>
<p>is like to me personally, okay, people are going to complain about this, but I know electric</p>
<p>vehicle, I know autopilot AI stuff.</p>
<p>To me, the software over there, software updates is like the biggest revolution in cars.</p>
<p>And it is extremely difficult to switch to that because it is a culture shift.</p>
<p>At first, especially if you&rsquo;re not comfortable with it, it seems dangerous.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s an approach to cars is so safety focused for so many decades that</p>
<p>like, what do you mean we dynamically change code?</p>
<p>The whole point is you have a thing that you test, like, and like, it&rsquo;s not reliable because</p>
<p>do you know how much it costs if we have to recall this cars, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a, and there&rsquo;s an understandable obsession with safety, but the downside of</p>
<p>an obsession with safety is the same as with being obsessed with safety as a parent is</p>
<p>like, if you do that too much, you limit the potential development and the flourishing</p>
<p>of in that particular aspect human being, when this particular aspect, the software,</p>
<p>the artificial neural network of it.</p>
<p>And but it&rsquo;s tough to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tough to do culturally and technically like the deployment, the mass deployment of</p>
<p>software is really, really difficult, but I hope that&rsquo;s where the industry is doing.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I really want Tesla to succeed is exactly about that point.</p>
<p>Not autopilot, not the electrical vehicle, but the softwareization of basically everything</p>
<p>but cars, especially because to me, that&rsquo;s actually going to increase two things, increase</p>
<p>safety because you can update much faster, but also increase the effectiveness of folks</p>
<p>like you who dream about enriching the human experience with AI because you can just like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a feature, like you want like a new emoji or whatever, like the way TikTok releases</p>
<p>filters, you can just release that for in car, in car stuff.</p>
<p>So, but yeah, that, that, that&rsquo;s definitely.</p>
<p>One of the use cases we&rsquo;re looking into is once you know the sentiment of the passengers</p>
<p>in the vehicle, you can optimize the temperature in the car.</p>
<p>You can change the lighting, right?</p>
<p>So if the backseat passengers are falling asleep, you can dim the lights, you can lower</p>
<p>the music, right?</p>
<p>You can do all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, of course you could do that kind of stuff with a two year delay, but it&rsquo;s tougher.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think, do you think a Tesla or Waymo or some of these companies that are doing</p>
<p>semi or fully autonomous driving should be doing driver sensing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are you thinking about that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>So not just how we can enhance the in cab experience for cars that are manly driven,</p>
<p>but the ones that are increasingly more autonomously driven.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So if we fast forward to the universe where it&rsquo;s fully autonomous, I think interior sensing</p>
<p>becomes extremely important because the role of the driver isn&rsquo;t just to drive.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the driver almost manages, manages the dynamics within a vehicle.</p>
<p>And so who&rsquo;s going to play that role when it&rsquo;s an autonomous car?</p>
<p>We want a solution that is able to say, Oh my God, like, you know, Lex is bored to death</p>
<p>cause the car&rsquo;s moving way too slow.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s engage Lex or Rana&rsquo;s freaking out because she doesn&rsquo;t trust this vehicle yet.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s tell Rana like a little bit more information about the route or, right?</p>
<p>So I think, or somebody&rsquo;s having a heart attack in the car, like you need interior sensing</p>
<p>and fully autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>But with semi autonomous vehicles, I think it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s really key to have driver</p>
<p>monitoring because semi autonomous means that sometimes the car is in charge.</p>
<p>Sometimes the driver is in charge or the copilot, right?</p>
<p>And you need this, you need both systems to be on the same page.</p>
<p>You need to know the car needs to know if the driver&rsquo;s asleep before it transitions</p>
<p>control over to the driver.</p>
<p>And sometimes if the driver&rsquo;s too tired, the car can say, I&rsquo;m going to be a better driver</p>
<p>than you are right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking control over.</p>
<p>So this dynamic, this dance is so key and you can&rsquo;t do that without driver sensing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a disagreement for the longest time I&rsquo;ve had with Elon that this is obvious that</p>
<p>this should be in the Tesla from day one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s obvious that driver sensing is not a hindrance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>I should be careful because having studied this problem, nothing is really obvious, but</p>
<p>it seems very likely a driver sensing is not a hindrance to an experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only enriching to the experience and likely increases the safety.</p>
<p>That said, it is very surprising to me just having studied semi autonomous driving, how</p>
<p>well humans are able to manage that dance because it was the intuition before you were</p>
<p>doing that kind of thing that humans will become just incredibly distracted.</p>
<p>They would just like let the thing do its thing, but they&rsquo;re able to, you know, cause</p>
<p>it is life and death and they&rsquo;re able to manage that somehow.</p>
<p>But that said, there&rsquo;s no reason not to have driver sensing on top of that.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s going to allow you to do that dance that you&rsquo;re currently doing without</p>
<p>driver sensing, except touching the steering wheel to do that even better.</p>
<p>I mean, the possibilities are endless and the machine learning possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a beautiful, it&rsquo;s also a constrained environment so you could do a much more effectively</p>
<p>than you can with the external environment, external environment is full of weird edge</p>
<p>cases and complexities just inside.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much, it&rsquo;s so fascinating, such a fascinating world.</p>
<p>I do hope that companies like Tesla and others, even Waymo, which I don&rsquo;t even know if Waymo</p>
<p>is doing anything sophisticated inside the cab.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, like what, what, what is it?</p>
<p>I honestly think, I honestly think it goes back to the robotics thing we were talking</p>
<p>about, which is like great engineers that are building these AI systems just are afraid</p>
<p>of the human being.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not thinking about the human experience, they&rsquo;re thinking about the features and yeah,</p>
<p>the perceptual abilities of that thing.</p>
<p>They think the best way I can serve the human is by doing the best perception and control</p>
<p>I can by looking at the external environment, keeping the human safe.</p>
<p>But like, there&rsquo;s a huge, I&rsquo;m here, like, you know, I need to be noticed and interacted</p>
<p>with and understood and all those kinds of things, even just on a personal level for</p>
<p>entertainment, honestly, for entertainment.</p>
<p>You know, one of the coolest work we did in collaboration with MIT around this was we</p>
<p>looked at longitudinal data, right, because, you know, MIT had access to like tons of data.</p>
<p>And like just seeing the patterns of people like driving in the morning off to work versus</p>
<p>like commuting back from work or weekend driving versus weekday driving.</p>
<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t it be so cool if your car knew that and then was able to optimize either</p>
<p>the route or the experience or even make recommendations?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very powerful.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, why are you taking this route?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always unhappy when you take this route.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re always happy when you take this alternative route.</p>
<p>Take that route.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But I mean, to have that even that little step of relationship with a car, I think,</p>
<p>is incredible.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to get the privacy right, you have to get all that kind of stuff right.</p>
<p>But I wish I honestly, you know, people are like paranoid about this, but I would like</p>
<p>a smart refrigerator.</p>
<p>We have such a deep connection with food as a human civilization.</p>
<p>I would like to have a refrigerator that would understand me that, you know, I also have</p>
<p>a complex relationship with food because I, you know, pig out too easily and all that</p>
<p>kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So, you know, like, maybe I want the refrigerator to be like, are you sure about this?</p>
<p>Because maybe you&rsquo;re just feeling down or tired.</p>
<p>Like maybe let&rsquo;s sleep on it.</p>
<p>Your vision of the smart refrigerator is way kinder than mine.</p>
<p>Is it just me yelling at you?</p>
<p>No, it was just because I don&rsquo;t, you know, I don&rsquo;t drink alcohol, I don&rsquo;t smoke, but</p>
<p>I eat a ton of chocolate, like it sticks to my vice.</p>
<p>And so I, and sometimes I scream too, and I&rsquo;m like, okay, my smart refrigerator will</p>
<p>just lock down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll just say, dude, you&rsquo;ve had way too many today, like down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, but here&rsquo;s the thing, are you, do you regret having, like, let&rsquo;s say not the next</p>
<p>day, but 30 days later, what would you like the refrigerator to have done then?</p>
<p>Well, I think actually like the more positive relationship would be one where there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>conversation, right?</p>
<p>As opposed to like, that&rsquo;s probably like the more sustainable relationship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like late at night, just, no, listen, listen, I know I told you an hour ago, that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a good idea, but just listen, things have changed.</p>
<p>I can just imagine a bunch of stuff being made up just to convince, but I mean, I just</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s opportunities that, I mean, maybe not locking down, but for our systems</p>
<p>that are such a deep part of our lives, like we use a lot of us, a lot of people that commute</p>
<p>use their car every single day.</p>
<p>A lot of us use a refrigerator every single day, the microwave every single day.</p>
<p>Like we just, like, I feel like certain things could be made more efficient, more enriching,</p>
<p>and AI is there to help, like some just basic recognition of you as a human being, but your</p>
<p>patterns of what makes you happy and not happy and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And the car, obviously.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe, maybe we&rsquo;ll say, wait, wait, wait, wait, instead of this, like, Ben and</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s ice cream, how about this hummus and carrots or something?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It would make it like a just in time recommendation, right?</p>
<p>But not like a generic one, but a reminder that last time you chose the carrots, you</p>
<p>smiled 17 times more the next day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re happier the next day, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re happier the next day.</p>
<p>And but yeah, I don&rsquo;t, but then again, if you&rsquo;re the kind of person that gets better</p>
<p>from negative, negative comments, you could say like, hey, remember like that wedding</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to, you want to fit into that dress?</p>
<p>Remember about that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about that before you&rsquo;re eating this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for some, probably that would work for me, like a refrigerator that is just ruthless</p>
<p>at shaming me.</p>
<p>But like, I would, of course, welcome it, like that would work for me.</p>
<p>Just that.</p>
<p>So it would know, I think it would, if it&rsquo;s really like smart, it would optimize its nudging</p>
<p>based on what works for you, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>Personalization.</p>
<p>In every way, depersonalization.</p>
<p>You were a part of a webinar titled Advancing Road Safety, the State of Alcohol Intoxication</p>
<p>Research.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, every year 1.3 million people around the world die in road</p>
<p>crashes and more than 20% of these fatalities are estimated to be alcohol related.</p>
<p>A lot of them are also distraction related.</p>
<p>So can AI help with the alcohol thing?</p>
<p>I think the answer is yes.</p>
<p>There are signals and we know that as humans, like we can tell when a person, you know,</p>
<p>is at different phases of being drunk, right?</p>
<p>And I think you can use technology to do the same.</p>
<p>And again, I think the ultimate solution is going to be a combination of different sensors.</p>
<p>How hard is the problem from the vision perspective?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s non trivial.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s non trivial and I think the biggest part is getting the data, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like getting enough data examples.</p>
<p>So we, for this research project, we partnered with the transportation authorities of Sweden</p>
<p>and we literally had a racetrack with a safety driver and we basically progressively got</p>
<p>people drunk.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So, but, you know, that&rsquo;s a very expensive data set to collect and you want to collect</p>
<p>it globally and in multiple conditions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The ethics of collecting a data set where people are drunk is tricky, which is funny</p>
<p>because I mean, let&rsquo;s put drunk driving aside.</p>
<p>The number of drunk people in the world every day is very large.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice to have a large data set of drunk people getting progressively drunk.</p>
<p>In fact, you could build an app where people can donate their data cause it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Actually, yeah.</p>
<p>But the liability.</p>
<p>Liability, the ethics, how do you get it right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really tricky.</p>
<p>Cause like drinking is one of those things that&rsquo;s funny and hilarious and we&rsquo;re loves</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s social, the so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the thing that hurts a lot of people.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people, like alcohol is one of those things it&rsquo;s legal, but it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>damaging to a lot of lives.</p>
<p>It destroys lives and not just in the driving context.</p>
<p>I should mention people should listen to Andrew Huberman who recently talked about alcohol.</p>
<p>He has an amazing pocket.</p>
<p>Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist from Stanford and a good friend of mine.</p>
<p>And he, he&rsquo;s like a human encyclopedia about all health related wisdom.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s a podcast, you would love it.</p>
<p>I would love that.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Listen, you listen to Andrew, it&rsquo;s called Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>This is your assignment.</p>
<p>Just listen to one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I guarantee you this will be a thing where you say, Lex, this is the greatest human I</p>
<p>have ever discovered.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ve really, I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;m really on a journey of kind of health and wellness and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning lots and I&rsquo;m trying to like build these, I guess, atomic habits around just</p>
<p>being healthy.</p>
<p>So I, yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely going to do this.</p>
<p>His whole thing, this is, this is, this is, this is great.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a legit scientist, like really well published, but in his podcast, what he does, he&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not talking about his own work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a human encyclopedia of papers.</p>
<p>And so he, his whole thing is he takes the topic and in a very fast, you mentioned atomic</p>
<p>habits, like very clear way summarizes the research in a way that leads to protocols</p>
<p>of what you should do.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really big on like, not like this is what the science says, but like this is literally</p>
<p>what you should be doing according to science.</p>
<p>So like he&rsquo;s really big and there&rsquo;s a lot of recommendations he does which several of</p>
<p>them I definitely don&rsquo;t do, like get some light as soon as possible from waking up and</p>
<p>like for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really big one and he&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of science behind that one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff that you&rsquo;re going to be like, Lex, this is a, this is my new</p>
<p>favorite person.</p>
<p>I guarantee it.</p>
<p>And if you guys somehow don&rsquo;t know Andrew Huberman and you care about your wellbeing,</p>
<p>you know, you should definitely listen to him.</p>
<p>I love you, Andrew.</p>
<p>Anyway, so what were we talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, alcohol and detecting alcohol.</p>
<p>So this is a problem you care about and you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>And actually like broadening it, I do believe that the car is going to be a wellness center,</p>
<p>like because again, imagine if you have a variety of sensors inside the vehicle, tracking</p>
<p>not just your emotional state or level of distraction and drowsiness and intoxication,</p>
<p>but also maybe even things like your, you know, your heart rate and your heart rate</p>
<p>variability and your breathing rate.</p>
<p>And it can start like optimizing, yeah, it can optimize the ride based on what your goals</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re going to start to see more of that and I&rsquo;m excited about that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are the, what are the challenges you&rsquo;re tackling while with SmartEye currently?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like the, the trickiest things to get, is it, is it basically convincing more and</p>
<p>more car companies that having AI inside the car is a good idea or is there some, is there</p>
<p>more technical algorithmic challenges?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been keeping you mentally busy?</p>
<p>I think a lot of the car companies we are in conversations with are already interested</p>
<p>in definitely driver monitoring.</p>
<p>Like I think it&rsquo;s becoming a must have, but even interior sensing, I can see like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>engaged in a lot of like advanced engineering projects and proof of concepts.</p>
<p>I think technologically though, and that even the technology, I can see a path to making</p>
<p>it happen.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the use case.</p>
<p>Like how does the car respond once it knows something about you?</p>
<p>Because you want it to respond in a thoughtful way that doesn&rsquo;t, that isn&rsquo;t off putting to</p>
<p>the consumer in the car.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s like the user experience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve really nailed that.</p>
<p>And we usually, that&rsquo;s not part, we&rsquo;re the sensing platform, but we usually collaborate</p>
<p>with the car manufacturer to decide what the use case is.</p>
<p>So say you do, you figure out that somebody&rsquo;s angry while driving, okay, what should the</p>
<p>car do?</p>
<p>Do you see yourself as a role of nudging, of like basically coming up with solutions</p>
<p>essentially that, and then the car manufacturers kind of put their own little spin on it?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So we, we are like the ideation, creative thought partner, but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the car company needs to decide what&rsquo;s on brand for them, right?</p>
<p>Like maybe when it figures out that you&rsquo;re distracted or drowsy, it shows you a coffee</p>
<p>cup, right?</p>
<p>Or maybe it takes more aggressive behaviors and basically said, okay, if you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>take a rest in the next five minutes, the car&rsquo;s going to shut down, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a whole range of actions the car can take and doing the thing that is most,</p>
<p>yeah, that builds trust with the driver and the passengers.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what we need to be very careful about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Car companies are funny cause they have their own, like, I mean, that&rsquo;s why people get cars</p>
<p>still.</p>
<p>I hope that changes, but they get it cause it&rsquo;s a certain feel and look and it&rsquo;s a certain,</p>
<p>they become proud, like Mercedes Benz or BMW or whatever, and that&rsquo;s their thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the family brand or something like that, or Ford or GM, whatever, they stick</p>
<p>to that thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it should be, I don&rsquo;t know, it should be a little more about the technology</p>
<p>inside.</p>
<p>And I suppose there too, there could be a branding, like a very specific style of luxury</p>
<p>or fun.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I have an AI focused fund to invest in early stage kind of AI driven companies.</p>
<p>And one of the companies we&rsquo;re looking at is trying to do what Tesla did, but for boats,</p>
<p>for recreational boats.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re building an electric and kind of slash autonomous boat and it&rsquo;s kind of the</p>
<p>same issues.</p>
<p>Like what kind of sensors can you put in?</p>
<p>What kind of states can you detect both exterior and interior within the boat?</p>
<p>Anyways, it&rsquo;s like really interesting.</p>
<p>Do you boat at all?</p>
<p>No, not well, not in that way.</p>
<p>I do like to get on the lake or a river and fish from a boat, but that&rsquo;s not boating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>Still boating.</p>
<p>Low tech.</p>
<p>A low tech boat.</p>
<p>Get away from, get closer to nature boat.</p>
<p>I guess going out into the ocean is also getting closer to nature in some deep sense.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess that&rsquo;s why people love it.</p>
<p>The enormity of the water just underneath you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love the water.</p>
<p>I love the, I love both.</p>
<p>I love salt water.</p>
<p>It was like the big and just, it&rsquo;s humbling to be in front of this giant thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so powerful that was here before us and be here after.</p>
<p>But I also love the piece of a small like wooded lake and it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>calm.</p>
<p>Therapeutic.</p>
<p>You tweeted that I&rsquo;m excited about Amazon&rsquo;s acquisition of iRobot.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a super interesting, just given the trajectory of what you&rsquo;re part of, of</p>
<p>these honestly small number of companies that are playing in this space that are like trying</p>
<p>to have an impact on human beings.</p>
<p>So the, it is an interesting moment in time that Amazon would acquire iRobot.</p>
<p>You tweet, I imagine a future where home robots are as ubiquitous as microwaves or toasters.</p>
<p>Here are three reasons why I think this is exciting.</p>
<p>If you remember, I can look it up, but what, why is this exciting to you?</p>
<p>I mean, I think the first reason why this is exciting, I kind of remember the exact</p>
<p>like order in which I put them, but one is just, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s going to be an incredible</p>
<p>platform for understanding our behaviors within the home, right?</p>
<p>Like you know, if you think about Roomba, which is, you know, the robot vacuum cleaner,</p>
<p>the flagship product of iRobot at the moment, it&rsquo;s like running around your home, understanding</p>
<p>the layout, it&rsquo;s understanding what&rsquo;s clean and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>How often do you clean your house?</p>
<p>And all of these like behaviors are a piece of the puzzle in terms of understanding who</p>
<p>you are as a consumer.</p>
<p>And I think that could be, again, used in really meaningful ways, not just to recommend</p>
<p>better products or whatever, but actually to improve your experience as a human being.</p>
<p>So I think, I think that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I think the natural evolution of these robots in the, in the home.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s interesting, Roomba isn&rsquo;t really a social robot, right, at the moment.</p>
<p>But I once interviewed one of the chief engineers on the Roomba team, and he talked about how</p>
<p>people named their Roombas.</p>
<p>And if the Roomba broke down, they would call in and say, you know, my Roomba broke down</p>
<p>and the company would say, well, we&rsquo;ll just send you a new one.</p>
<p>And no, no, no, Rosie, like you have to like, yeah, I want you to fix this particular robot.</p>
<p>So people have already built like interesting emotional connections with these home robots.</p>
<p>And I think that, again, that provides a platform for really interesting things to, to just</p>
<p>motivate change.</p>
<p>Like it could help you.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the companies that spun out of MIT, Catalia Health, the guy who started</p>
<p>it spent a lot of time building robots that help with weight management.</p>
<p>So weight management, sleep, eating better, yeah, all of these things.</p>
<p>Well, if I&rsquo;m being honest, Amazon does not exactly have a track record of winning over</p>
<p>people in terms of trust.</p>
<p>Now that said, it&rsquo;s a really difficult problem for a human being to let a robot in their</p>
<p>home that has a camera on it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, really, really tough.</p>
<p>And I think Roomba actually, I have to think about this, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure now or for</p>
<p>some time already has had cameras because they&rsquo;re doing the, the, the most recent Roomba.</p>
<p>I have so many Roombas.</p>
<p>Oh, you actually do?</p>
<p>Well, I programmed it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use a Roomba for VECO.</p>
<p>People that have been to my place, they&rsquo;re like, yeah, you definitely don&rsquo;t use these</p>
<p>Roombas.</p>
<p>That could be a good, I can&rsquo;t tell like the valence of this comment.</p>
<p>Was it a compliment or like?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a giant, it&rsquo;s just a bunch of electronics everywhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I have six or seven computers, I have robots everywhere, Lego robots, I have</p>
<p>small robots and big robots and it&rsquo;s just giant, just piles of robot stuff and yeah.</p>
<p>But including the Roombas, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re being used for their body and intelligence,</p>
<p>but not for their purpose.</p>
<p>I have, I&rsquo;ve changed them, repurposed them for other purposes, for deeper, more meaningful</p>
<p>purposes than just like the Bota Roba, which is, you know, brings a lot of people happiness,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>They have a camera because the thing they advertised, I had my own camera still, but</p>
<p>the, the, the camera on the new Roomba, they have like state of the art poop detection</p>
<p>as they advertised, which is a very difficult, apparently it&rsquo;s a big problem for, for vacuum</p>
<p>cleaners is, you know, if they go over like dog poop, it just runs it, it runs it over</p>
<p>and creates a giant mess.</p>
<p>So they have like, and apparently they collected like a huge amount of data and different shapes</p>
<p>and looks and whatever of poop and then now they&rsquo;re able to avoid it and so on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very proud of this.</p>
<p>So there is a camera, but you don&rsquo;t think of it as having a camera.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think of it as having a camera because you&rsquo;ve grown to trust that, I guess, because</p>
<p>our phones, at least most of us seem to trust this phone, even though there&rsquo;s a camera looking</p>
<p>directly at you.</p>
<p>I think that if you trust that the company is taking security very seriously, I actually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how that trust was earned with smartphones, I think it just started to provide</p>
<p>a lot of positive value to your life where you just took it in and then the company over</p>
<p>time has shown that it takes privacy very seriously, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I just, Amazon is not always in the, in its social robots communicated.</p>
<p>This is a trustworthy thing, both in terms of culture and competence, because I think</p>
<p>privacy is not just about what do you intend to do, but also how well, how good are you</p>
<p>at doing that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really hard problem to solve.</p>
<p>But I mean, but a lot of us have Alexas at home and I mean, Alexa could be listening</p>
<p>in the whole time, right?</p>
<p>And doing all sorts of nefarious things with the data.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hopefully it&rsquo;s not, but I don&rsquo;t think it is.</p>
<p>But you know, Amazon is not, it&rsquo;s such a tricky thing for a company to get right, which</p>
<p>is like to earn the trust.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Alexa&rsquo;s earned people&rsquo;s trust quite yet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not there quite yet.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>They struggle with this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>In fact, when these topics are brought up, people are always get like nervous.</p>
<p>And I think if you get nervous about it, that mean that like the way to earn people&rsquo;s trust</p>
<p>is not by like, Ooh, don&rsquo;t talk about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just be open, be frank, be transparent, and also create a culture of like where it</p>
<p>radiates at every level from engineer to CEO that like you&rsquo;re good people that have a common</p>
<p>sense idea of what it means to respect basic human rights and the privacy of people and</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I think that propagates throughout the, that&rsquo;s the best PR, which is like over time</p>
<p>you understand that these are good folks doing good things.</p>
<p>Anyway, speaking of social robots, have you heard about Tesla, Tesla bot, the humanoid</p>
<p>robot?</p>
<p>Yes, I have.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t exactly know what it&rsquo;s designed to do to you.</p>
<p>You probably do.</p>
<p>No, I know it&rsquo;s designed to do, but I have a different perspective on it, but it&rsquo;s designed</p>
<p>to, it&rsquo;s a humanoid form and it&rsquo;s designed to, for automation tasks in the same way that</p>
<p>industrial robot arms automate tasks in the factory.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s designed to automate tasks in the factory.</p>
<p>But I think that humanoid form, as we were talking about before, is one that we connect</p>
<p>with as human beings.</p>
<p>Anything legged, obviously, but the humanoid form especially, we anthropomorphize it most</p>
<p>intensely.</p>
<p>And so the possibility to me, it&rsquo;s exciting to see both Atlas developed by Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>and anyone, including Tesla, trying to make humanoid robots cheaper and more effective.</p>
<p>The obvious way it transforms the world is social robotics to me versus automation of</p>
<p>tasks in the factory.</p>
<p>So yeah, I just wanted, in case that was something you were interested in, because I find its</p>
<p>application of social robotics super interesting.</p>
<p>We did a lot of work with Pepper, Pepper the robot, a while back.</p>
<p>We were like the emotion engine for Pepper, which is Softbank&rsquo;s humanoid robot.</p>
<p>How tall is Pepper?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, like, I don&rsquo;t know, like five foot maybe, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Pretty, pretty big.</p>
<p>Pretty big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to be at like airport lounges and, you know, retail stores, mostly customer</p>
<p>service, right?</p>
<p>Hotel lobbies, and I mean, I don&rsquo;t know where the state of the robot is, but I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very promising.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of applications where this can be helpful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also really interested in, yeah, social robotics for the home, right?</p>
<p>Like that can help elderly people, for example, transport things from one location of the</p>
<p>mind to the other, or even like just have your back in case something happens.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s a very interesting space.</p>
<p>It seems early though.</p>
<p>Do you feel like the timing is now?</p>
<p>Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>So it always seems early until it&rsquo;s not, right?</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>I think the time, I definitely think that the time is now, like this decade for social</p>
<p>robots.</p>
<p>Whether the humanoid form is right, I don&rsquo;t think so, no.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I think the, like if we just look at Jibo as an example, I feel like most of</p>
<p>the problem, the challenge, the opportunity of social connection between an AI system</p>
<p>and a human being does not require you to also solve the problem of robot manipulation</p>
<p>and bipedal mobility.</p>
<p>So I think you could do that with just a screen, honestly, but there&rsquo;s something about the</p>
<p>interface of Jibo where it can rotate and so on that&rsquo;s also compelling.</p>
<p>But you get to see all these robot companies that fail, incredible companies like Jibo</p>
<p>and even, I mean, the iRobot in some sense is a big success story that it was able to</p>
<p>find a niche thing and focus on it, but in some sense it&rsquo;s not a success story because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t build any other robot, like any other, it didn&rsquo;t expand into all kinds of</p>
<p>robotics.</p>
<p>Like once you&rsquo;re in the home, maybe that&rsquo;s what happens with Amazon is they&rsquo;ll flourish</p>
<p>into all kinds of other robots.</p>
<p>But do you have a sense, by the way, why it&rsquo;s so difficult to build a robotics company?</p>
<p>Like why so many companies have failed?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re building a vertical stack, right?</p>
<p>Like you are building the hardware plus the software and you find you have to do this</p>
<p>at a cost that makes sense.</p>
<p>So I think Jibo was retailing at like, I don&rsquo;t know, like $800, like $700, $800, which for</p>
<p>the use case, right, there&rsquo;s a dissonance there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too high.</p>
<p>So I think cost of building the whole platform in a way that is affordable for what value</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bringing, I think that&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<p>I think for these home robots that are going to help you do stuff around the home, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a challenge too, like the mobility piece of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things I&rsquo;m really excited with Tesla Bot is the people working on it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably the criticism I would apply to some of the other folks who worked</p>
<p>on social robots is the people working on Tesla Bot know how to, they&rsquo;re focused on</p>
<p>and know how to do mass manufacture and create a product that&rsquo;s super cheap.</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the focus.</p>
<p>The engineering focus isn&rsquo;t, I would say that you can also criticize them for that, is they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not focused on the experience of the robot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re focused on how to get this thing to do the basic stuff that the humanoid form</p>
<p>requires to do it as cheap as possible.</p>
<p>Then the fewest number of actuators, the fewest numbers of motors, the increasing efficiency,</p>
<p>they decrease the weight, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I would say that Jibo and all those folks, they focus on the design, the experience,</p>
<p>all of that, and it&rsquo;s secondary how to manufacture.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you have to think like the Tesla Bot folks from first principles, what is the fewest</p>
<p>number of components, the cheapest components, how can I build it as much in house as possible</p>
<p>without having to consider all the complexities of a supply chain, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Because if you have to build a robotics company, you&rsquo;re not building one robot, you&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>hopefully millions of robots, you have to figure out how to do that where the final</p>
<p>thing, I mean, if it&rsquo;s Jibo type of robot, is there a reason why Jibo, like we can have</p>
<p>this lengthy discussion, is there a reason why Jibo has to be over $100?</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like the basic components.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Components of it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like you could start to actually discuss like, okay, what is the essential thing about Jibo?</p>
<p>How much, what is the cheapest way I can have a screen?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the cheapest way I can have a rotating base?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Right, get down, continuously drive down costs.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you have launched an extremely successful companies, you have helped others,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve invested in companies.</p>
<p>Can you give advice on how to start a successful company?</p>
<p>I would say have a problem that you really, really, really want to solve, right?</p>
<p>Something that you&rsquo;re deeply passionate about.</p>
<p>And honestly, take the first step.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s often the hardest.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t overthink it.</p>
<p>Like, you know, like this idea of a minimum viable product or a minimum viable version</p>
<p>of an idea, right?</p>
<p>Like, yes, you&rsquo;re thinking about this, like a humongous, like super elegant, super beautiful</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>What, like reduce it to the littlest thing you can bring to market that can solve a problem</p>
<p>or that can, you know, that can help address a pain point that somebody has.</p>
<p>They often tell you, like, start with a customer of one, right?</p>
<p>If you can solve a problem for one person, then there&rsquo;s probably going to be yourself</p>
<p>or some other person.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Pick a person.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It could be you.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s actually often a good sign that if you enjoy a thing, enjoy a thing where</p>
<p>you have a specific problem that you&rsquo;d like to solve, that&rsquo;s a good, that&rsquo;s a good end</p>
<p>of one to focus on.</p>
<p>What else, what else is there to actually step one is the hardest, but there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>steps as well, right?</p>
<p>I also think like who you bring around the table early on is so key, right?</p>
<p>Like being clear on, on what I call like your core values or your North Star.</p>
<p>It might sound fluffy, but actually it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So and Roz and I feel like we did that very early on.</p>
<p>We sat around her kitchen table and we said, okay, there&rsquo;s so many applications of this</p>
<p>technology.</p>
<p>How are we going to draw the line?</p>
<p>How are we going to set boundaries?</p>
<p>We came up with a set of core values that in the hardest of times we fell back on to</p>
<p>determine how we make decisions.</p>
<p>And so I feel like just getting clarity on these core, like for us, it was respecting</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s privacy, only engaging with industries where it&rsquo;s clear opt in.</p>
<p>So for instance, we don&rsquo;t do any work in security and surveillance.</p>
<p>So things like that, just getting, we very big on, you know, one of our core values is</p>
<p>human connection and empathy, right?</p>
<p>And that is, yes, it&rsquo;s an AI company, but it&rsquo;s about people.</p>
<p>Well, these are all, they become encoded in how we act, even if you&rsquo;re a small, tiny team</p>
<p>of two or three or whatever.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s another piece of advice.</p>
<p>So what about finding people, hiring people?</p>
<p>If you care about people as much as you do, like this, it seems like such a difficult</p>
<p>thing to hire the right people.</p>
<p>I think early on as a startup, you want people who have, who share the passion and the conviction</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to be tough.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve yet to meet a startup where it was just a straight line to success, right?</p>
<p>Even not just startup, like even everyday people&rsquo;s lives, right?</p>
<p>You always like run into obstacles and you run into naysayers and you need people who</p>
<p>are believers, whether they&rsquo;re people on your team or even your investors.</p>
<p>You need investors who are really believers in what you&rsquo;re doing, because that means they</p>
<p>will stick with you.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t give up at the first obstacle.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>What about raising money?</p>
<p>What about finding investors, first of all, raising money, but also raising money from</p>
<p>the right sources from that ultimately don&rsquo;t hinder you, but help you, empower you, all</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What advice would you give there?</p>
<p>You successfully raised money many times in your life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not just about the money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about finding the right investors who are going to be aligned in terms of what you</p>
<p>want to build and believe in your core values.</p>
<p>For example, especially later on, in my latest round of funding, I try to bring in investors</p>
<p>that really care about the ethics of AI and the alignment of vision and mission and core</p>
<p>values is really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re picking a life partner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>So you take it that seriously for investors?</p>
<p>Yeah, because they&rsquo;re going to have to stick with you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stuck together.</p>
<p>For a while anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe not for life, but for a while, for sure.</p>
<p>For better or worse.</p>
<p>I forget what the vowels usually sound like.</p>
<p>For better or worse?</p>
<p>Through something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s romantic and deep and you&rsquo;re in it for a while.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about the money.</p>
<p>You tweeted about going to your first capital camp investing get together and that you learned</p>
<p>a lot.</p>
<p>So this is about investing.</p>
<p>So what have you learned from that?</p>
<p>What have you learned about investing in general from both because you&rsquo;ve been on both ends</p>
<p>of it?</p>
<p>I mean, I try to use my experience as an operator now with my investor hat on when I&rsquo;m identifying</p>
<p>companies to invest in.</p>
<p>First of all, I think the good news is because I have a technology background and I really</p>
<p>understand machine learning and computer vision and AI, et cetera, I can apply that level</p>
<p>of understanding because everybody says they&rsquo;re an AI company or they&rsquo;re an AI tech.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, no, no, no, no, show me the technology.</p>
<p>So I can do that level of diligence, which I actually love.</p>
<p>And then I have to do the litmus test of, if I&rsquo;m in a conversation with you, am I excited</p>
<p>to tell you about this new company that I just met?</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m an ambassador for that company and I&rsquo;m passionate about what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>I usually use that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important to me when I&rsquo;m investing.</p>
<p>So that means you actually can explain what they&rsquo;re doing and you&rsquo;re excited about it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Thank you for putting it so succinctly, like rambling, but exactly that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>No, but sometimes it&rsquo;s funny, but sometimes it&rsquo;s unclear exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hear people tell me, you know, in the talk for a while and it sounds cool, like</p>
<p>they paint a picture of a world, but then when you try to summarize it, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>exactly clear.</p>
<p>Like maybe what the core powerful idea is, like you can&rsquo;t just build another Facebook</p>
<p>or there has to be a core, simple to explain idea that then you can or can&rsquo;t get excited</p>
<p>about, but it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s right there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But how do you ultimately pick who you think will be successful?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the thing you&rsquo;re excited about, like there&rsquo;s other stuff.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s all the, you know, with early stage companies, like pre seed companies,</p>
<p>which is where I&rsquo;m investing, sometimes the business model isn&rsquo;t clear yet, or the go</p>
<p>to market strategy isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually like, it&rsquo;s very early on that some of these things haven&rsquo;t been hashed</p>
<p>out, which is okay.</p>
<p>So the way I like to think about it is like, if this company is successful, will this be</p>
<p>a multi billion slash trillion dollar market, you know, or company?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s definitely a lens that I use.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s pre seed?</p>
<p>What are the different stages and what&rsquo;s the most exciting stage and what&rsquo;s, or no, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting about every stage, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So pre seed is usually when you&rsquo;re just starting out, you&rsquo;ve maybe raised the friends and family</p>
<p>rounds.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve raised some money from people, you know, and you&rsquo;re getting ready to take your</p>
<p>first institutional check in, like first check from an investor.</p>
<p>And I love the stage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Some investors really don&rsquo;t like the stage because the financial models aren&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Often the teams aren&rsquo;t even like formed really, really early.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s like a magical stage because it&rsquo;s the time when there&rsquo;s so much conviction,</p>
<p>so much belief, almost delusional, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little bit of naivete around with founders at the stage.</p>
<p>I just love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s contagious.</p>
<p>And I love that I can, often they&rsquo;re first time founders, not always, but often they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>first time founders and I can share my experience as a founder myself and I can empathize, right?</p>
<p>And I can almost, I create a safe ground where, because, you know, you have to be careful</p>
<p>what you tell your investors, right?</p>
<p>And I will often like say, I&rsquo;ve been in your shoes as a founder.</p>
<p>You can tell me if it&rsquo;s challenging, you can tell me what you&rsquo;re struggling with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to vent.</p>
<p>So I create that safe ground and I think that&rsquo;s a superpower.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have to, I guess you have to figure out if this kind of person is going to be able</p>
<p>to ride the roller coaster, like of many pivots and challenges and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And if the space of ideas they&rsquo;re working in is interesting, like the way they think</p>
<p>about the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because if it&rsquo;s successful, the thing they end up with might be very different, the reason</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s successful for them.</p>
<p>Actually, you know, I was going to say the third, so the technology is one aspect, the</p>
<p>market or the idea, right, is the second and the third is the founder, right?</p>
<p>Is this somebody who I believe has conviction, is a hustler, you know, is going to overcome</p>
<p>obstacles?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that is going to be a great leader, right?</p>
<p>Like as a startup, as a founder, you&rsquo;re often, you are the first person and your role is</p>
<p>to bring amazing people around you to build this thing.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re an evangelist, right?</p>
<p>So how good are you going to be at that?</p>
<p>So I try to evaluate that too.</p>
<p>You also in the tweet thread about it, mention, is this a known concept, random rich dudes</p>
<p>are RDS and saying that there should be like random rich women, I guess.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the dudes, what&rsquo;s the dudes version of women, the women version of dudes, ladies?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s, is this a technical term?</p>
<p>Is this known?</p>
<p>Random rich dudes?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make that up, but I was at this capital camp, which is a get together for investors</p>
<p>of all types.</p>
<p>And there must have been maybe 400 or so attendees, maybe 20 were women.</p>
<p>It was just very disproportionately, you know, male dominated, which I&rsquo;m used to.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re used to this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m used to it, but it&rsquo;s still surprising.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;m raising money for this fund, so my fund partner is a guy called Rob May, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done this before.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m new to the investing world, but he&rsquo;s done this before.</p>
<p>Most of our investors in the fund are these, I mean, awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super grateful to them.</p>
<p>Random just rich guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, where are the rich women?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really adamant in both investing in women led AI companies, but I also would love</p>
<p>to have women investors be part of my fund because I think that&rsquo;s how we drive change.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that takes time, of course, but there&rsquo;s been quite a lot of progress, but yeah, for</p>
<p>the next Mark Zuckerberg to be a woman and all that kind of stuff, because that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like a huge number of wealth generated by women and then controlled by women and allocated</p>
<p>by women and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And then beyond just women, just broadly across all different measures of diversity and so</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>Let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat.</p>
<p>So you already gave advice on startups and just advice for women, but in general advice</p>
<p>for folks in high school or college today, how to have a career they can be proud of,</p>
<p>how to have a life they can be proud of.</p>
<p>I suppose you have to give this kind of advice to your kids.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the number one advice that I give to my kids.</p>
<p>My daughter&rsquo;s now 19 by the way, and my son&rsquo;s 13 and a half, so they&rsquo;re not little kids</p>
<p>anymore.</p>
<p>Does it break your heart?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re my best friends, but yeah, I think the number one advice I would share is embark</p>
<p>on a journey without attaching to outcomes and enjoy the journey, right?</p>
<p>So we often were so obsessed with the end goal that doesn&rsquo;t allow us to be open to different</p>
<p>endings of a journey or a story, so you become like so fixated on a particular path.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see the beauty in the other alternative path, and then you forget to enjoy the journey</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just so fixated on the goal, and I&rsquo;ve been guilty of that for many, many</p>
<p>years of my life, and I&rsquo;m now trying to make the shift of, no, no, no, I&rsquo;m going to again</p>
<p>trust that things are going to work out and it&rsquo;ll be amazing and maybe even exceed your</p>
<p>dreams.</p>
<p>We have to be open to that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Taking a leap into all kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think you tweeted like you went on vacation by yourself or something like this.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Yes, and just going, just taking the leap.</p>
<p>Doing it.</p>
<p>Totally doing it.</p>
<p>And enjoying it, enjoying the moment, enjoying the weeks, enjoying not looking at some kind</p>
<p>of career ladder, next step and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something to that, like over planning too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surrounded by a lot of people that kind of, so I don&rsquo;t plan.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do you not do goal setting?</p>
<p>My goal setting is very like, I like the affirmations, it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s almost, I don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>put it into words, but it&rsquo;s a little bit like what my heart yearns for kind of, and I guess</p>
<p>in the space of emotions more than in the space of like, this will be like in the rational</p>
<p>space because I just try to picture a world that I would like to be in and that world</p>
<p>is not clearly pictured, it&rsquo;s mostly in the emotional world.</p>
<p>I mean, I think about that from robots because I have this desire, I&rsquo;ve had it my whole life</p>
<p>to, well, it took different shapes, but I think once I discovered AI, the desire was</p>
<p>to, I think in the context of this conversation could be easily easier described as basically</p>
<p>a social robotics company and that&rsquo;s something I dreamed of doing and well, there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of complexity to that story, but that&rsquo;s the only thing, honestly, I dream of doing.</p>
<p>So I imagine a world that I could help create, but it&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s no steps along the way</p>
<p>and I think I&rsquo;m just kind of stumbling around and following happiness and working my ass</p>
<p>off in almost random, like an ant does in random directions, but a lot of people, a</p>
<p>lot of successful people around me say this, you should have a plan, you should have a</p>
<p>clear goal, you have a goal at the end of the month, you have a goal at the end of the</p>
<p>month, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t and there&rsquo;s a balance to be struck, of course, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something to be said about really making sure that you&rsquo;re living life to the fullest, that</p>
<p>goals can actually get in the way of.</p>
<p>So one of the best, like kind of most, what do you call it when it challenges your brain,</p>
<p>what do you call it?</p>
<p>The only thing that comes to mind, and this is me saying is the mindfuck, but yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Super inspiring talk.</p>
<p>Kenneth Stanley, he was at OpenAI, he just laughed and he has a book called Why Greatness</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t Be Planned and it&rsquo;s actually an AI book.</p>
<p>So and he&rsquo;s done all these experiments that basically show that when you over optimize,</p>
<p>you, like the trade off is you&rsquo;re less creative, right?</p>
<p>And to create true greatness and truly creative solutions to problems, you can&rsquo;t over plan</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I thought that was, and so he generalizes it beyond AI and he talks about how we apply</p>
<p>that in our personal life and in our organizations and our companies, which are over KPIs, right?</p>
<p>Like look at any company in the world and it&rsquo;s all like, these aren&rsquo;t the goals, these</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t weekly goals and the sprints and then the quarterly goals, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And he just shows with a lot of his AI experiments that that&rsquo;s not how you create truly game</p>
<p>changing ideas.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You can.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a balance of course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s yeah, many moments of genius will not come from planning and goals, but you still</p>
<p>have to build factories and you still have to manufacture and you still have to deliver</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s still deadlines and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that for that, it&rsquo;s good to have goals.</p>
<p>I do goal setting with my kids, we all have our goals, but, but, but I think we&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>to morph into more of these like bigger picture goals and not obsess about like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Well, I honestly think with, especially with kids, it&rsquo;s better, much, much better to have</p>
<p>a plan and have goals and so on because you have to, you have to learn the muscle of like</p>
<p>what it feels like to get stuff done.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And once you learn that, there&rsquo;s flexibility for me because I spend most of my life with</p>
<p>goal setting and so on.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;ve gotten good with grades and school.</p>
<p>I mean, school, if you want to be successful at school, yeah, I mean the kind of stuff</p>
<p>in high school and college, the kids have to do in terms of managing their time and</p>
<p>getting so much stuff done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, taking five, six, seven classes in college, they&rsquo;re like that would</p>
<p>break the spirit of most humans if they took one of them later in life, it&rsquo;s like really</p>
<p>difficult stuff, especially engineering curricula.</p>
<p>So I think you have to learn that skill, but once you learn it, you can maybe, cause you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you can be a little bit on autopilot and use that momentum and then allow yourself to be</p>
<p>lost in the flow of life.</p>
<p>You know, just kind of, or also give like, I worked pretty hard to allow myself to have</p>
<p>the freedom to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, that&rsquo;s a tricky freedom to have because like a lot of people get lost</p>
<p>in the rat race and they, and they also like financially, they, whenever you get a raise,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get like a bigger house or something like this.</p>
<p>I put very, so like, there&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re always trapped in this race, I put a lot of emphasis</p>
<p>on living like below my means always.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of freedom to do whatever, whatever the heart desires that that&rsquo;s a relief,</p>
<p>but everyone has to decide what&rsquo;s the right thing, what&rsquo;s the right thing for them.</p>
<p>For some people having a lot of responsibilities, like a house they can barely afford or having</p>
<p>a lot of kids, the responsibility side of that is really, helps them get their shit</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>Like, all right, I need to be really focused and get, some of the most successful people</p>
<p>I know have kids and the kids bring out the best in them.</p>
<p>They make them more productive and less productive.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s accountability.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an accountability thing, absolutely.</p>
<p>And almost something to actually live and fight and work for, like having a family,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to see because you would think kids would be a hit on productivity,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not, for a lot of really successful people, they really like, they&rsquo;re like an</p>
<p>engine of.</p>
<p>Right, efficiency.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful to see.</p>
<p>And also a source of happiness.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, what role do you think love plays in the human condition, love?</p>
<p>I think love is, yeah, I think it&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re all here.</p>
<p>I think it would be very hard to live life without love in any of its forms, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the most beautiful of forms that human connection takes, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And everybody wants to feel loved, right, in one way or another, right?</p>
<p>And to love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It feels good.</p>
<p>And to love too, totally.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with that.</p>
<p>Both of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure what feels better.</p>
<p>Both, both like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, to give and to give love too, yeah.</p>
<p>And it is like we&rsquo;ve been talking about an interesting question, whether some of that,</p>
<p>whether one day we&rsquo;ll be able to love a toaster.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some small.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t quite thinking about that when I said like, yeah, like we all need love and</p>
<p>give love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I was thinking about.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I was thinking about Brad Pitt and toasters.</p>
<p>Okay, toasters, great.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, I think we started on love and ended on love.</p>
<p>This was an incredible conversation, Rhonda.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you&rsquo;re doing in AI, in the space of just caring about humanity,</p>
<p>caring about emotion, about love, and being an inspiration to a huge number of people</p>
<p>in robotics, in AI, in science, in the world in general.</p>
<p>So thank you for talking to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>And you know, I&rsquo;m a big fan of yours as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been a pleasure.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Rhonda Alkalioubi.</p>
