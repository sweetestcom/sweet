    <p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It. Thank you. Jenny, tell the listener about our exciting news.</p>
<p>Listener, we are now available on Patreon where you can subscribe to hear all sorts</p>
<p>of bonus content, blooper reels, dramatic readings of hate comments, and you can follow</p>
<p>along in Pumps&rsquo;s journey. And if we get 1 million subscribers, Pumps will take off her</p>
<p>clothes and balance a wire hanger on her nipple. I didn&rsquo;t say take off all my clothes. I would</p>
<p>take my top off. I wouldn&rsquo;t have my vagine out. Let me clarify, listener. Okay. She will</p>
<p>go topless and balance a wire hanger on the sagging dragons. Are the sagging dragons too</p>
<p>far south? We got to get&hellip; No, right now we could do it, but I&rsquo;m just saying like a</p>
<p>year from now, I may not be able to do my hanger trick. Time is of the essence. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right. Get on there. Follow us on Patreon. Welcome to this special edition of I&rsquo;ve Had</p>
<p>It. I want to start off with a positive comment that we received on YouTube that I would like</p>
<p>to share with you and the listener and Kylie and Richard. Excellent. Lay it on me. Okay.</p>
<p>Sin posted, I literally binged your podcast and now I&rsquo;m binging your YouTube. I love Jen&rsquo;s</p>
<p>honesty. Hot as hell. And I love her laugh. Genuine. Pumps, I love your honesty. Hotter</p>
<p>than Jen, by the way. Sorry, Jen. And you are so loyal and honest. You guys make my</p>
<p>week. That&rsquo;s so nice. That is so nice. So without further ado, I&rsquo;d like to introduce</p>
<p>myself. I am Jen and the star of our show. Hotter than hot. Hotter than me. Pumps. All</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say is you can just refer to me from here on out as the hot one, the hotter</p>
<p>one. What about the hot star? The hot star. The hot star of our show, Pumps. That is funny.</p>
<p>I will have to say, I know we love reading the mean comments, but the reviews have been</p>
<p>so kind and gracious. I mean, really nice. I love our little tribe we&rsquo;ve got going. I</p>
<p>wanted to read something positive and I always love, because our friendship is such, that</p>
<p>I love when somebody like really is overly effusive towards you. Say that you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>star of the show or that you&rsquo;re hotter. I get the biggest kick out of it because I feel</p>
<p>that way about you. And so I share with them in their praise of you. But I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>get too entirely positive. We don&rsquo;t want to get too sappy around here. That&rsquo;s not what</p>
<p>this brand is. But we do love each other and Pumps is a star and a hot one at that.</p>
<p>And hotter than Jen, just so everybody knows.</p>
<p>Before we get any further, I want to share a story that I read in the news this morning,</p>
<p>because you know, every morning I&rsquo;m a voracious reader of the news. And there is a school</p>
<p>principal in Tallahassee, Florida, that was forced to resign after parents started complaining</p>
<p>because in an art history class, she showed them and taught them about Michelangelo&rsquo;s David.</p>
<p>Oh, because David&rsquo;s naked.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right. But it&rsquo;s David.</p>
<p>So these parents think that it is pornographic.</p>
<p>Oh, for fuck&rsquo;s sake. I mean, really? Florida just needs to be annexed off the planet.</p>
<p>I have seen David in person.</p>
<p>I have too.</p>
<p>In Florence. And it is so impressive. And so incredible. I absolutely like when I remember</p>
<p>when I went to see it, and they made this dome that kind of goes over him at the museum that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in. And I was like, wow. Yeah. I mean, David is very impressive. And it really chaps my hide</p>
<p>how prude Americans are about nudity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fucking stupid. It&rsquo;s so stupid. It&rsquo;s so close minded. Nobody looks at David and says</p>
<p>sexual. Although I do have to say, just as a little backbone of what you just said. So when</p>
<p>we went to see him when I was backpacking here with my girlfriend, we went to see him.</p>
<p>And we were both like, amazing, great. He kind of had a small penis for how big the rest of him was,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>Total small penis.</p>
<p>Small penis. So that makes me think Michelangelo had a small penis.</p>
<p>No, I researched this.</p>
<p>Oh, you did?</p>
<p>Yes. Back 2,500 years ago, an ancient Greek or an ancient Roman, small penises were more sought</p>
<p>after than large penises. Yes, because a sound Greek or Roman, they valued intellect. And they</p>
<p>felt like a large penis detracted from that.</p>
<p>So kind of like if your penis is smaller, your brain&rsquo;s bigger and you&rsquo;re smarter.</p>
<p>Yes. And so it&rsquo;s not just David that has a small penis. A lot of ancient Greek and ancient Roman</p>
<p>statues have smaller penises. But we&rsquo;re digressing here. Because listen, I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the age, the modern age, where size does matter. And I do think David could have</p>
<p>a larger penis.</p>
<p>I do too. I think it just proportionately.</p>
<p>I thought got great ass, great legs, great abs.</p>
<p>Here we are sexualizing. So we&rsquo;re kind of falling into the nut job.</p>
<p>No, I wasn&rsquo;t. No, I&rsquo;m not sexualized. I wasn&rsquo;t sexualizing him. I thought, God,</p>
<p>what a beautiful specimen. I didn&rsquo;t want to jump his bones. But I was a little bit discouraged</p>
<p>by the size of his penis.</p>
<p>Right. And I just think that whole-</p>
<p>But I want to talk about that these parents think that their children seeing a piece of art like</p>
<p>that, that somehow that&rsquo;s pornographic. I think that is so crazy and so fucking nuts. It&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>nuts that they think that there&rsquo;s something pornographic about that. And they would not</p>
<p>want them to learn about one of the greatest sculptors that has ever lived or walked the</p>
<p>earth. So it makes me wonder what these parents are thinking, A, is so pornographic about David.</p>
<p>And B, are you aware that there is this thing called the World Wide Web?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was just going to say.</p>
<p>This poor woman had to resign for teaching about Michelangelo&rsquo;s David. I mean, like</p>
<p>an amazing piece of art despite his teeny weenie.</p>
<p>His teeny weenie.</p>
<p>You know, teeny weenie on David.</p>
<p>Could have gone a little bigger.</p>
<p>But I have had it with that, with the censorship of art. It&rsquo;s just it really like it&rsquo;s so depressing</p>
<p>to think, OK, it&rsquo;s 2023 and you&rsquo;ve got some yahoos that are wound up like cheap clocks</p>
<p>over Michelangelo&rsquo;s David.</p>
<p>Right. It makes no sense. It&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re putting your time. You&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to fight Michelangelo&rsquo;s David. That&rsquo;s what you want to spend your free time on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, parents of Tallahassee, I guarantee you, your kids are beaten off to ass fucking</p>
<p>on YouTube.</p>
<p>100 percent. And probably the husband, too. That&rsquo;s probably why she&rsquo;s so mad about it.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably out with all the girls doing all that kind of thing.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s bananas. It really I thought, good God, they must look over the</p>
<p>Italians must read this and think.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so stupid.</p>
<p>What a bunch of idiots that cannot appreciate art.</p>
<p>See, my thing with art is I know you have to like it. I know you have to go to the museums</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in Europe, all that. But like if you said, would you rather go to a soft</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s softball game or the Louvre? It&rsquo;s not even a close call for me.</p>
<p>See, I mean, so I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m part of the problem in that I appreciate art for what it like</p>
<p>what it gives people that like art are smarter, blah, blah, blah, blah. You have to have it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cultured. But in terms of like if I&rsquo;m going to spend my day somewhere, I mean, I</p>
<p>probably could do the Louvre in forty five minutes, hit the highlights. I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>I think most lesbians would probably choose to go to</p>
<p>the women&rsquo;s softball game. Don&rsquo;t you, Kylie?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re more lesbian than I am.</p>
<p>I do. I think you&rsquo;re more of a lesbian than Kylie, who&rsquo;s in a relationship with a woman.</p>
<p>I know. I just I&rsquo;m not very cultured. That&rsquo;s just not my thing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re friends.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing because, you know, we really have like our</p>
<p>are the things that we like to do in our spare time are so different.</p>
<p>Right. Like you love to shop. I hate to shop. I would rather do</p>
<p>anything on the planet. I&rsquo;d rather go to the Louvre than shopping.</p>
<p>I think art is so compelling and so fantastic. It needs to be protected.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with nudity. Nothing.</p>
<p>Especially in art.</p>
<p>And I bet you those kids are pussies.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Nobody likes a pussy.</p>
<p>And I just feel sorry for the kids, really, because it&rsquo;s not their fault.</p>
<p>OK. All right.</p>
<p>OK. That&rsquo;s enough. Let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We digress. But I just I wanted to highlight that because I think we need to protect art.</p>
<p>I agree. And even though I&rsquo;m not a connoisseur of art, I agree with you 100 percent.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m behind it. I&rsquo;ll march for it. I&rsquo;ll do all that.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to have to really look at it.</p>
<p>You want to go to the women&rsquo;s softball?</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Kylie, do you watch women&rsquo;s softball?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>See, you are gayer than Kylie.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>I did play at one point.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>When I was younger.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is this the time for me to tell about my lesbian dream that I had?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great opportunity. Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>Listener, hang on just one second. Parental discretion advised.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want those parents in Tallahassee to come after us.</p>
<p>Pups proceed.</p>
<p>So back in the day when OU women&rsquo;s basketball was really, really, really good,</p>
<p>I was on vacation with a girlfriend. I took an Ambien, which I don&rsquo;t normally take.</p>
<p>And I had a full on dream, sex dream about one of the players.</p>
<p>Like it was a full lesbian dream.</p>
<p>Were you aroused?</p>
<p>Yes. Like I woke up. Yes.</p>
<p>Listen, listener, I mean, there is a strong case. There is time for you yet.</p>
<p>Kylie always tells me there&rsquo;s still time.</p>
<p>There is time for you because, I mean, you know, you don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not interested in dating men right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in dating women either.</p>
<p>All right. Well, thank you so much for sharing your lesbian dream</p>
<p>with the listener and with me.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, my whole point is that&rsquo;s the only dream that I was like sexually aroused at.</p>
<p>It was with a woman.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve never had a wet dream with a man?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, see, I have many.</p>
<p>Have you? With that basketball or that tennis player?</p>
<p>Tennis players. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, maybe I am a lesbian. I just don&rsquo;t know it yet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see. There is time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Please subscribe to our Patreon where we are going to follow Pump&rsquo;s evolution of coming</p>
<p>out of the closet. For only $4.99, once we receive 1 million subscribers,</p>
<p>Pumps will not only balance a wire hanger on her nipple, she will come out of the closet.</p>
<p>At a softball game.</p>
<p>Okay, Kylie, what you got for us today?</p>
<p>Okay. Speaking of Americans being embarrassing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Jilly B has something to say about that.</p>
<p>Jilly B.</p>
<p>Hi, everyone. This is Jill from Canada, and I have fucking had it.</p>
<p>Fucking had it with American cruise ship tourists up here in Canada.</p>
<p>I live on the East Coast. I don&rsquo;t know why you come here. I mean,</p>
<p>apparently the leaves changing color is something you don&rsquo;t get in the US.</p>
<p>Maybe our lobsters are different, but fuck me.</p>
<p>If one more fucking American asks me one stupid fucking question about a country that they share</p>
<p>a huge border with, I&rsquo;m going to fucking murder somebody.</p>
<p>If I have one more person ask me if I have the right to fucking vote,</p>
<p>or if the Queen, do we vote in the Queen? Do we vote in the King? Fuck.</p>
<p>Do I have the right to vote as a woman? I don&rsquo;t get it. Stop fucking sending them to us.</p>
<p>Keep them there. We don&rsquo;t want them. Thanks.</p>
<p>Jilly B.</p>
<p>Lover.</p>
<p>I mean, love that she&rsquo;s from Canada.</p>
<p>Okay. Here&rsquo;s the deal. First and foremost, I completely agree with you as evidenced</p>
<p>by my starting point that people in America are getting wound up about fucking Michelangelo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>David being taught to children, which is stupid. Secondly, I fucking hate cruises. I hate everything</p>
<p>about them. I hate group activities, and the cruise is like the fucking creme de la creme</p>
<p>of group activities. I&rsquo;ve never been on one. I will never go on one. I think they need to be</p>
<p>completely, you always hear about somebody falling off a cruise ship, like on a Dateline murder</p>
<p>mystery. Did they fall off or did they jump? Or were they pushed?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably hoping they all fall off, Jilly B. But lastly, the ethnocentricity of Americans-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Is so embarrassing. It is so embarrassing that we don&rsquo;t know much about Canada.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re not allowed to study art history, so they&rsquo;re probably not banging it out on</p>
<p>world affairs or history, period. It&rsquo;s a cry in shame.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cry in shame that this shit&rsquo;s going on, the censorship, the book censorship,</p>
<p>all that shit that&rsquo;s going on in Florida right now with that, whatever, Ron DeSantis. But I mean,</p>
<p>Trump is pretty good at making nicknames.</p>
<p>Ron DeSanctimonious is pretty good.</p>
<p>DeSanctimonious is pretty good. I mean, I fucking hate Trump, but that is a really good nickname.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right. You guys called Trude Americans. What&rsquo;s the capital of Canada?</p>
<p>Ottawa?</p>
<p>No, fuck.</p>
<p>Quebec?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s the French part.</p>
<p>Manitoba?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know either.</p>
<p>Toronto? I mean, I do know who the president is.</p>
<p>Is it the president?</p>
<p>Yeah, because he&rsquo;s hot.</p>
<p>Prime minister.</p>
<p>Yeah, the hot.</p>
<p>Justin Trudeau is hot.</p>
<p>Trudeau is hot. The hot prime minister.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hot. I follow him on Instagram and he&rsquo;ll do one video completely in English and then he</p>
<p>follows it up, fluent French. Yeah, he&rsquo;s hot. I like him.</p>
<p>Anybody that speaks more than one language, I totally love them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, Pumps, did you say Ottawa?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Jennifer, you were correct.</p>
<p>Yeah. Take that, Jilly B.</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;re browbeating Americans and then worst offenders.</p>
<p>I got it right, though.</p>
<p>I know, but I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>I nailed it. Ottawa.</p>
<p>Was that your first answer, though?</p>
<p>It was my first answer. Rewind the tape.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have tapes.</p>
<p>Instant replay.</p>
<p>Instant replay.</p>
<p>Suck it, Pumps.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>You may be hot and you may be the star, but you didn&rsquo;t know the capital of Canada.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. We need to brush up on our history.</p>
<p>Go eat a bag of dicks, Pumps.</p>
<p>Okay, up next, we&rsquo;ve got Jackson B.</p>
<p>Okay. I just love all the men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with adults over the age of 21 that still need a lift to and from the airport.</p>
<p>I just spent three hours in traffic in total from Santa Monica to LAX and LAX back to Santa Monica.</p>
<p>And granted, I had to drop my husband at the airport, but still, I feel like this fits for</p>
<p>them as well. Be a fucking adult and download the Uber app and stop trapping people into</p>
<p>taking you to the airport.</p>
<p>He rings me on his way home from like a trip, a work trip.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been away for a week and he says, babe, do you have anything planned tonight?</p>
<p>And I said, no, of course I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Dinner and a movie.</p>
<p>He said, thank God you don&rsquo;t have anything planned.</p>
<p>Now, I thought he was going to take me on a date.</p>
<p>No, he goes, I&rsquo;ve got an emergency in Texas.</p>
<p>I have to fly there for work and I&rsquo;ve got to go tonight so you can take me to the airport.</p>
<p>Great. We&rsquo;ll spend some time together.</p>
<p>That is not quality fucking time.</p>
<p>Grow up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a dick over to asking if he had plans first.</p>
<p>I mean, he just like got him right in there.</p>
<p>First and foremost.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the Australian accent because that really brought an international</p>
<p>flair to I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Yes, it totally did.</p>
<p>Love him.</p>
<p>Secondly, I could not agree with you more about adults not being self starters on getting</p>
<p>their fucking rides to the airport.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you a story that just happened this very week.</p>
<p>So pumps, 22 year old son had to go to the airport and he had to be there at like seven.</p>
<p>So he starts texting me at six 30 that pumps is listening to our podcast, cracking up at</p>
<p>herself and me in the car and that it was insufferable for him to ride to the airport.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I think it&rsquo;s kind of cute that she likes to listen to our podcast and</p>
<p>crack up at us.</p>
<p>And he said, yeah, I&rsquo;m just not in the mindset for this right now, Jenny.</p>
<p>And I said, Sam, this is why there is Uber.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And he said, I will keep that in mind for next time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I just want to remind everybody, if you are new listeners, pumps over mothers, her</p>
<p>children, it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s borderline criminal, but she, it, she takes mothering to such an</p>
<p>extreme that she is involved in a group me for her 22 year old son.</p>
<p>Like all the moms of these other 22 year olds have a fucking group me.</p>
<p>And this is a huge fucking problem.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t with it.</p>
<p>I mean, it really brings up a lot of unsettled rage.</p>
<p>It feels fresh again.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an over mother.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not a newsflash though.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from the job.</p>
<p>I will say this.</p>
<p>You are a wonderful mother.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And you have such great relationships with your kids.</p>
<p>You just need to let them start doing for themselves what they can do for themselves.</p>
<p>I know he did Uber home from the airport, but we were doing a podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If not, I would have picked him up otherwise.</p>
<p>Tomahawk chopper.</p>
<p>I mean, he would have helicoptered that thing all the way.</p>
<p>I would have with the zero.</p>
<p>I mean, like I went to bed at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, got up and took him to the</p>
<p>airport at six.</p>
<p>Never crossed my mind to tell him to do an Uber.</p>
<p>I love my boys more than anything on the planet.</p>
<p>You pick up Dylan from the airport because he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>When he comes back in town from being away from me for five months in Syracuse.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But there are times where when he flies back to Syracuse, he leaves super early in the</p>
<p>morning and you can book an Uber the night before to be at your house.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>My children wouldn&rsquo;t want to burden me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not an over mother at the Welch residence, but we sure are over at the Sullivan one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Up next, we&rsquo;ve got Haley H.</p>
<p>Hi, ladies.</p>
<p>I absolutely love your podcast.</p>
<p>It is currently 9.59 at night and it just dawned on me what I&rsquo;ve had it with this week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve absolutely fucking had it with girls who have to bring their clingy, weird ass</p>
<p>boyfriends or husbands, whatever, partner, whoever it is with them everywhere we fucking</p>
<p>go.</p>
<p>They are not my friend.</p>
<p>You are my friend.</p>
<p>I cannot speak about how insufferable they are while they&rsquo;re sitting right next to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fucking had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Leave them at home.</p>
<p>This is girl time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want Chad listening in on how my menstrual cycle is off course again and how my boyfriend</p>
<p>smells weird sometimes.</p>
<p>Like, please.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Get him out of here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got to fucking go.</p>
<p>I completely agree with her.</p>
<p>If somebody, if we were having a girls night and somebody brought their husband, they would</p>
<p>be blackballed forever.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>From the girls night.</p>
<p>But people do this.</p>
<p>I mean, do they?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Back when we were more social, there&rsquo;s always that super enmeshed couple that has to do</p>
<p>everything together.</p>
<p>That cannot create their own path for themselves individually and then have their relationship</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s 100% right that this is something that is going on.</p>
<p>And listen to me, everybody.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re involved in one of these enmeshed relationships, you need to first and foremost</p>
<p>try to get out of it.</p>
<p>But if you can&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t drag them everywhere because then you have no identity.</p>
<p>Your whole identity is enmeshed into being this couple.</p>
<p>Well, you know what?</p>
<p>I think when you talk about somebody that goes with their girlfriend, spouse, partner,</p>
<p>whatever, everywhere, that it&rsquo;s a control thing and that that might be like the next</p>
<p>Dateline NBC.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have a man, first of all, why would any man want to go on a girls night?</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>This is going to lead to homicide and murder.</p>
<p>It is just weird.</p>
<p>Breaking news.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a podcast.</p>
<p>When you see couples that have to drag their significant other to everything, it is a precursor</p>
<p>to murder, right?</p>
<p>I mean, not necessarily FBI shortlist, but it&rsquo;s I mean, it&rsquo;s just a controlling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Several steps to getting to homicide.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s worse.</p>
<p>What if the couple are both yak mouths and then they have to go everywhere together?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to end in homicide.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Me killing both of them if they&rsquo;re both yak mouths and he she brings them on a girl strike.</p>
<p>I mean, on a girls night trip.</p>
<p>I mean, that just I mean, can you imagine if we got off the plane for a girls trip and</p>
<p>Josh Welch was there?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even wrap my head around it now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would just blackball that friend and I would tell her straight up.</p>
<p>Probably you have some controlling issues.</p>
<p>Either way, you need to take a look at maybe hit up a therapist.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not take it that far.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one that brought up Dateline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going on your track.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s talking about murder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that much control that they won&rsquo;t let you go have dinner by yourself with</p>
<p>your girlfriends.</p>
<p>OJ situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge red flag.</p>
<p>Listen, not only on this podcast do we talk about stuff that we&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re solving crimes and preventing crimes.</p>
<p>Preventing crimes.</p>
<p>This is crime prevention.</p>
<p>Crime prevention podcast.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Crime prevention.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be a yak mouth.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take your significant other everywhere with you.</p>
<p>These two things, especially combined, lead to homicide and heading a Dateline series.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Keith Morrison could be coming to your house.</p>
<p>God, I love him.</p>
<p>God, I love him too.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Canadian.</p>
<p>Well, look at you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Jilly B.</p>
<p>I mean, Pumps is just a fucking walking Wikipedia about Canadians.</p>
<p>About Canadians.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Up next, we&rsquo;ve got Marina J.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have had it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve McFucking had it with this Valley girl affectation, if you will, that people</p>
<p>are talking like nowadays.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t even do it good because nobody talks like that.</p>
<p>I asked my mom 20 years ago, 15 years ago, were people talking like this?</p>
<p>No, they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t talk like this.</p>
<p>I work with this girl.</p>
<p>She talks like that all the time.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even focus on what she&rsquo;s saying because all I can hear is like, seriously, thank you</p>
<p>guys so much.</p>
<p>Like, do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Do you get what I mean by that?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Knock it off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not cute.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seriously had it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>
<p>This is going on.</p>
<p>And these are the same low IQ people that misuse the word literally.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally dead.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, you&rsquo;re literally alive.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, I agree with her.</p>
<p>You see this, or I&rsquo;ll have to do business with somebody in the design industry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got some young whipper, snapper that&rsquo;s a sales rep for some fabric line.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll call and it&rsquo;s like, currently that fabric is out of stock.</p>
<p>Expected refill date is January 1st.</p>
<p>Would you like for me to reserve that?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what I&rsquo;d like for you to do is quit talking like a fucking moron.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not impressing anybody.</p>
<p>It makes you sound dumb.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I feel dumber for having heard it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, so I agree with her.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t run into as many people that talk like this because I spend most of my time trying</p>
<p>to avoid running into people altogether.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I would advise that you make your life smaller and start shedding people from your life.</p>
<p>But I think she said she worked with her.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s stuck.</p>
<p>I think she just quits talking to this woman.</p>
<p>Just ignore her.</p>
<p>Ghost.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So here I have two things on this.</p>
<p>Number one, the movie Valley Girl.</p>
<p>Remember that movie?</p>
<p>It was Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that was like middle school age for me.</p>
<p>Eighties.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I immediately wrote down all of those things that they said and was trying so hard to be a</p>
<p>Valley Girl.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>Stop, stop.</p>
<p>Gag me with a spoon.</p>
<p>You took notes.</p>
<p>Yes, we all did.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>In cursive.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>Cursive.</p>
<p>100% cursive.</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s coming back around, like the gag me with the spoon, or is it just the</p>
<p>affect of the voice?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it ever went anywhere.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s evolved much like, you know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Pubic hair grooming has evolved throughout the years.</p>
<p>So when we were younger, it did exist, this kind of affected voice.</p>
<p>And they were Valley Girls.</p>
<p>And I think I practiced it and I nailed it for years.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a part of the problem.</p>
<p>So I am a part of the problem.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t talk like that now.</p>
<p>No, you just sound like a fucking redneck now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which I am a redneck.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s at least okay.</p>
<p>We both have pretty big Southern accents.</p>
<p>When I listen, I think I don&rsquo;t have one.</p>
<p>But I think when I hang out with you too, it really.</p>
<p>Gets worse.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like a comfort thing.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like a comfort way to speak.</p>
<p>Kylie, who&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Up next, we got Jonathan G.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so thrilled we have all these men.</p>
<p>Hey guys, not sure if you&rsquo;re still sharing these things,</p>
<p>but I thought I would give you an Australian perspective.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the I&rsquo;ve had it has as much impact as I&rsquo;m fucking done with this shit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the Australian version.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m fucking done with people turning up to my house unannounced.</p>
<p>Like friends, family, anyone.</p>
<p>Like do not turn up to my house unannounced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a cunty thing to do.</p>
<p>Totally agree.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It is a very cunty thing to do.</p>
<p>And how international are we?</p>
<p>I love that we have two men, both from Australia.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes me just so happy.</p>
<p>We are hot fucking shit today, pups.</p>
<p>We are.</p>
<p>We are killing it on the international scale.</p>
<p>We are crushing Australia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But let me just, I could not agree with you more about the unannounced show ups.</p>
<p>I have a very strict unannounced policy at my house that you cannot come over</p>
<p>unless you have clearance beforehand.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also branched this policy to my interior design office.</p>
<p>As we well know.</p>
<p>And it is constantly abused.</p>
<p>And I am at the cusp of committing mass homicide in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>Because I am so fucking mad about this situation where on my door it says,</p>
<p>do not enter unless you have an appointment or a delivery.</p>
<p>And despite this being in cap lock, red, bold, as large of a font as I can get it,</p>
<p>people constantly come into my office lost, asking for directions.</p>
<p>And I have fucking had it up to my eyeballs with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do about it.</p>
<p>Because I am genuinely this, I mean, this, sometimes I think about it at night and I</p>
<p>just get so, to quote him, I&rsquo;m fucking done.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, it is beyond I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I am fucking done.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t come to my fucking office.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t show up unless you&rsquo;re the fucking United States Postal Service with a package for me.</p>
<p>Or Amazon.</p>
<p>Or somebody in my staff.</p>
<p>Or Amazon.</p>
<p>Or UPS.</p>
<p>Or you have a pre-approved appointment.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>End of story.</p>
<p>Read the fucking sign.</p>
<p>Do not enter.</p>
<p>But yeah, but here&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m kind of worried about with the office people.</p>
<p>Like at some point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to snap.</p>
<p>You really might snap.</p>
<p>I mean, it bugs the shit out of you.</p>
<p>Pam says famous quote about me when she can tell we know each other so well.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m working up, she can read my eyes and my body language.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;ll look at those around us and she&rsquo;ll say, oh, Jenny&rsquo;s about to blow.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s about to blow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not pretty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>The blow is coming for some.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve already called somebody a fucking bitch.</p>
<p>I mean, how much worse could it be without violence?</p>
<p>She was a fucking bitch.</p>
<p>I doubled down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beside the point.</p>
<p>I maintain.</p>
<p>She got snappy with me that I didn&rsquo;t know where her suite was.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t fucking know where it is because I only drive to Jennifer Welch Designs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my responsibility to know where her fucking lawyer office is.</p>
<p>Can you not fucking read?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking done.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you&rsquo;re just worked up just thinking about it.</p>
<p>I need to just center myself.</p>
<p>OK, well, I mean, we just got you wound up today.</p>
<p>I just wound up like a cheap.</p>
<p>I mean, you are just on a roll.</p>
<p>We could do this forever.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m afraid the listener might think I&rsquo;m wound up like this all the time.</p>
<p>They might not think you&rsquo;re a kind, gentle soul.</p>
<p>They might get the wrong impression that you&rsquo;re cynical.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I am cynical.</p>
<p>But I in daily life, I&rsquo;m typically because I&rsquo;ve navigated as such that I don&rsquo;t have these</p>
<p>interactions that much to get worked up.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I know I was thinking the other day, I have a pretty drama free life and I like it like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have.</p>
<p>We have.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lived the drama in the drama.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done all the drama that anybody could ever do.</p>
<p>But I like having a drama free life.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Listen up, listener, that will conclude this very special episode.</p>
