    <p>The following is a conversation with Frank Wilczek,</p>
<p>a theoretical physicist at MIT who won the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>for the co discovery of asymptotic freedom</p>
<p>in the theory of strong interaction.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>the Information, NetSuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist,</p>
<p>and Aidsleep.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say a word about asymptotic freedom.</p>
<p>Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of an atom.</p>
<p>Strong interaction is responsible</p>
<p>for the strong nuclear force that binds them.</p>
<p>But strong interaction also holds together the quarks</p>
<p>that make up the protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>Frank Wilczek, David Gross, and David Politzer</p>
<p>came up with a theory postulating</p>
<p>that when quarks come really close to one another,</p>
<p>the attraction abates and they behave like free particles.</p>
<p>This is called asymptotic freedom.</p>
<p>This happens at very, very high energies,</p>
<p>which is also where all the fun is.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Frank Wilczek.</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful idea in physics?</p>
<p>The most beautiful idea in physics</p>
<p>is that we can get a compact description of the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very precise and very full</p>
<p>at the level of the operating system of the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an extraordinary gift.</p>
<p>And we get worried when we find discrepancies</p>
<p>between our description of the world</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s actually observed</p>
<p>at the level even of a part in a billion.</p>
<p>You actually have this quote from Einstein</p>
<p>that the most incomprehensible thing</p>
<p>about the universe is that it is comprehensible,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>Yes, so that&rsquo;s the most beautiful surprise</p>
<p>that I think that really was to me the most profound result</p>
<p>of the scientific revolution of the 17th century</p>
<p>with the shining example of Newtonian physics</p>
<p>that you could aspire to completeness, precision,</p>
<p>and a concise description of the world,</p>
<p>of the operating system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gotten better and better over the years</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the continuing miracle.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of beautiful sub miracles too.</p>
<p>The form of the equations is governed</p>
<p>by high degrees of symmetry</p>
<p>and they have a very surprising kind</p>
<p>of mind expanding structure,</p>
<p>especially in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>But if I had to say the single most beautiful revelation</p>
<p>is that, in fact, the world is comprehensible.</p>
<p>Would you say that&rsquo;s a fact or a hope?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>We can do, you can point to things like</p>
<p>the rise of gross national products per capita</p>
<p>around the world as a result of the scientific revolution.</p>
<p>You can see it all around you.</p>
<p>And recent developments with exponential production</p>
<p>of wealth, control of nature at a very profound level</p>
<p>where we do things like sense tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny</p>
<p>vibrations to tell that there are black holes</p>
<p>colliding far away or we test laws as I alluded to</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s part in a billion and do things</p>
<p>in what appear on the surface</p>
<p>to be entirely different conceptual universes.</p>
<p>I mean, on the one hand, pencil and paper</p>
<p>are nowadays computers that calculate abstractions</p>
<p>and on the other hand, magnets and accelerators</p>
<p>and detectors that look at the behavior</p>
<p>of fundamental particles and these different universes</p>
<p>have to agree or else we get very upset</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an amazing thing if you think about it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s telling us that we do understand a lot</p>
<p>about nature at a very profound level</p>
<p>and there are still things we don&rsquo;t understand of course</p>
<p>but as we get better and better answers</p>
<p>and better and better ability to address difficult questions</p>
<p>we can ask more and more ambitious questions.</p>
<p>Well, I guess the hope part of that is because</p>
<p>we are surrounded by mystery.</p>
<p>So one way to say it, if you look at the growth GDP</p>
<p>over time that we figured out quite a lot</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re able to improve the quality of life</p>
<p>because of that and we&rsquo;ve figured out some fundamental things</p>
<p>about this universe but we still don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how much mystery there is and it&rsquo;s also possible</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some things that are in fact incomprehensible</p>
<p>to both our minds and the tools of science.</p>
<p>Like the sad thing is we may not know it</p>
<p>because in fact they are incomprehensible</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the open question is how much</p>
<p>of the universe is comprehensible?</p>
<p>If we figured out everything what&rsquo;s inside the black hole</p>
<p>and everything that happened at the moment of the Big Bang</p>
<p>does that still give us the key</p>
<p>to understanding the human mind</p>
<p>and the emergence of all the beautiful complexity</p>
<p>we see around us?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not like when I see these objects</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen them like cellular automata</p>
<p>all these kinds of objects where the from simple rules</p>
<p>emerges complexity, it makes you wonder maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not reducible to simple beautiful equations</p>
<p>the whole thing only parts of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the tension I was getting at with the hope.</p>
<p>Well, when we say the universe is comprehensible</p>
<p>we have to kind of draw careful distinctions</p>
<p>about or definitions about what we mean by that.</p>
<p>Both the universe and the kind of and the comprehensive.</p>
<p>Exactly, right so the so in certain areas</p>
<p>of understanding reality we&rsquo;ve made extraordinary progress</p>
<p>I would say in understanding fundamental physical processes</p>
<p>and getting very precise equations that really work</p>
<p>and allow us to do the profound sculpting of matter</p>
<p>to make computers and iPhones and everything else</p>
<p>and they really work and they&rsquo;re extraordinary productions</p>
<p>on the other but and that&rsquo;s all based</p>
<p>on the laws of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and they really work and they give us tremendous control</p>
<p>of nature on the other hand as we get better answers</p>
<p>we can also ask more ambitious questions</p>
<p>and there are certainly things that have been observed</p>
<p>even in what would be usually called the realm of physics</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t understood for instance there seems to be</p>
<p>another source of mass in the universe</p>
<p>the so called dark matter that we don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very interesting question what it is then</p>
<p>but also as you were alluding to there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>to know the basic equations it&rsquo;s another thing</p>
<p>to be able to solve them in important cases</p>
<p>so we run up against the limits of that</p>
<p>in things like chemistry where we&rsquo;d like to be able</p>
<p>to design molecules and predict their behavior</p>
<p>from the equations we think the equations could do that</p>
<p>in principle but in practice it&rsquo;s very challenging</p>
<p>to solve them in all but very simple cases</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the other thing which is that a lot</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re interested in is historically conditioned</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a matter of the fundamental equations</p>
<p>but about what has evolved or come out</p>
<p>of the early universe and formed into people and frogs</p>
<p>and societies and things and the laws of physics</p>
<p>the basic laws of physics only take you so far</p>
<p>in that it kind of provides a foundation</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t really that you need entirely different concepts</p>
<p>to deal with those kind of systems</p>
<p>and one thing I can say about that is that the laws</p>
<p>themselves point out their limitations</p>
<p>that they kind of their laws for dynamical evolution</p>
<p>so they tell you what happens if you have</p>
<p>a certain starting point but they don&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>what the starting point should be at least yeah</p>
<p>and the other thing that emerges</p>
<p>from the equations themselves is the phenomena</p>
<p>of chaos and sensitivity to initial conditions</p>
<p>which tells us that you have that there are intrinsic</p>
<p>limitations on how well we can spell out the consequences</p>
<p>of the laws if we try to apply them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the old apple pie if you want to what is it</p>
<p>make an apple pie from scratch you have to build</p>
<p>the universe or something like that.</p>
<p>Well you&rsquo;re much better off starting with apples</p>
<p>than starting with quarks let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>In your book A Beautiful Question you ask</p>
<p>does the world embody beautiful ideas?</p>
<p>So the book is centered around this very interesting</p>
<p>question it&rsquo;s like Shakespeare you can like dig in</p>
<p>and read into all the different interpretations</p>
<p>of this question but at the high level what to use</p>
<p>the connection between beauty of the world</p>
<p>and physics of the world.</p>
<p>In a sense we now have a lot of insight into what</p>
<p>the laws are the form they take that allow us</p>
<p>to understand matter in great depth and control it</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve discussed and it&rsquo;s an extraordinary thing</p>
<p>how mathematically ideal those equations turn out to be.</p>
<p>In the early days of Greek philosophy Plato had this model</p>
<p>of atoms built out of the five perfectly symmetrical</p>
<p>platonic solids so there was somehow the idea</p>
<p>that mathematical symmetry should govern the world</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve out Platoed Plato by far in modern physics</p>
<p>because we have symmetries that are much more extensive</p>
<p>much more powerful that turn out to be the ingredients</p>
<p>out of which we construct our theory of the world</p>
<p>and it works and so that&rsquo;s certainly beautiful.</p>
<p>So the idea of symmetry which is a driving inspiration</p>
<p>in much of human art especially decorative art</p>
<p>like the Alhambra or wallpaper designs or things</p>
<p>you see around you everywhere also turns out to be</p>
<p>the dominant theme in modern fundamental physics</p>
<p>symmetry and its manifestations the laws turn out</p>
<p>to be very to have these tremendous amounts of symmetry</p>
<p>you can change the symbols and move them around</p>
<p>in different ways and they still have the same consequences.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s beautiful that these concepts that humans</p>
<p>find appealing also turn out to be the concepts</p>
<p>that govern how the world actually works.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an accident.</p>
<p>I think humans were evolved to be able to interact</p>
<p>with the world in ways that are advantageous</p>
<p>and to learn from it and so we are naturally evolved</p>
<p>or designed to enjoy beauty and it&rsquo;s a symmetry</p>
<p>and the world has it and that&rsquo;s why we resonate with it.</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s interesting that the ideas of symmetry</p>
<p>emerge at many levels of the hierarchy of the universe.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about particles but it also is</p>
<p>at the level of chemistry and biology</p>
<p>and the fact that our cognitive sort of our perception</p>
<p>system and whatever our cognition is also finds</p>
<p>it appealing or somehow our sense of what is beautiful</p>
<p>is grounded in this idea of symmetry</p>
<p>or the breaking of symmetry.</p>
<p>Symmetry is at the core of our conception of beauty</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the breaking or the non breaking</p>
<p>of the symmetry.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder why.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>So I come from Russia and the question of Dostoevsky</p>
<p>he has said that beauty will save the world.</p>
<p>Maybe as a physicist you can tell me</p>
<p>what do you think he meant by that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it saves the world</p>
<p>but it does turn out to be a tremendous source</p>
<p>of insight into the world.</p>
<p>When we investigate kind of the most fundamental</p>
<p>interactions, things that are hard to access</p>
<p>because they occur at very short distances</p>
<p>between very special kinds of particles</p>
<p>whose properties are only revealed at high energies.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have much to go on from everyday life</p>
<p>but so we have when we guess what the,</p>
<p>and the experiments are difficult to do</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t really follow a very wholly empirical procedure</p>
<p>to sort of in the Baconian style figure out the laws</p>
<p>kind of step by step just by accumulating a lot of data</p>
<p>what we actually do is guess.</p>
<p>And the guesses are kind of aesthetic really.</p>
<p>What would be a nice description</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s consistent with what we know</p>
<p>and then you try it out and see if it works</p>
<p>and by gosh it does in many profound cases.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that but there&rsquo;s another source of symmetry</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t talk so much about in a beautiful question</p>
<p>but does relate to your comments</p>
<p>and I think very much relates to the source of symmetry</p>
<p>that we find in biology and in our heads, you know,</p>
<p>in our brain which is that, well it is discussed a bit</p>
<p>in a beautiful question and also in fundamentals</p>
<p>is that when you have, symmetry is also a very important</p>
<p>means of construction.</p>
<p>So when you have for instance simple viruses</p>
<p>that need to construct their coat, their protein coat,</p>
<p>the coats often take the form of platonic solids</p>
<p>and the reason is that the viruses are really dumb</p>
<p>and they only know how to do one thing</p>
<p>so they make a pentagon then they make another pentagon</p>
<p>and they make another pentagon</p>
<p>and they all glue together in the same way</p>
<p>and that makes a very symmetrical object sort of.</p>
<p>So the rules of development when you have simple rules</p>
<p>and they work again and again, you get symmetrical patterns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of, in fact it&rsquo;s a recipe also</p>
<p>for generating fractals, like the kind of broccoli</p>
<p>that has all this internal structure</p>
<p>and I wish I had a picture to show</p>
<p>but maybe people remember it from the supermarket</p>
<p>and you say how did a vegetable get so intelligent</p>
<p>to make such a beautiful object</p>
<p>with all this fractal structure</p>
<p>and the secret is stupidity.</p>
<p>You just do the same thing over and over again</p>
<p>and in our brains also, you know, we came out,</p>
<p>we start from single cells and they reproduce</p>
<p>and each one does basically roughly the same thing.</p>
<p>The program evolves in time, of course,</p>
<p>different modules get turned on and off,</p>
<p>different regions of the genetic code</p>
<p>get turned on and off but basically,</p>
<p>a lot of the same things are going on</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re simple things</p>
<p>and so you produce the same patterns over and over again</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a recipe for producing symmetry</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting the same thing in many, many places</p>
<p>and if you look at, for instance,</p>
<p>the beautiful drawings of Roman Icahal,</p>
<p>the great neuroanatomist who drew the structure</p>
<p>of different organs like the hippocampus,</p>
<p>you see it&rsquo;s very regular and very intricate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s symmetry in that sense</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s many repeated units</p>
<p>that you can take from one place to the other</p>
<p>and see that they look more or less the same.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re describing, this kind of beauty</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about now is a very small sample</p>
<p>in terms of space time in a very big world</p>
<p>in a very short, brief moment in this long history.</p>
<p>In your book, Fundamentals, 10 Keys to Reality,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really recommend people read it.</p>
<p>You say that space and time are pretty big or very big.</p>
<p>How big are we talking about?</p>
<p>Can you tell a brief history of space and time?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to tell a brief history, but the details get very</p>
<p>involved, of course, but one thing I&rsquo;d like to say</p>
<p>is that if you take a broad enough view,</p>
<p>the history of the universe is simpler</p>
<p>than the history of Sweden, say,</p>
<p>because your standards are lower.</p>
<p>But just to make it quantitative,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give a few highlights.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little bit easier to talk about time,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s start with that.</p>
<p>The Big Bang occurred, we think.</p>
<p>The universe was much hotter and denser and more uniform</p>
<p>about 13.8 billion years ago,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we call the Big Bang.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been expanding and cooling,</p>
<p>the matter in it has been expanding and cooling ever since.</p>
<p>So in a real sense, the universe is 13.8 billion years old.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big number, kind of hard to think about.</p>
<p>A nice way to think about it, though,</p>
<p>is to map it onto one year.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say the universe just linearly mapped</p>
<p>the time intervals from 13.8 billion years onto one year.</p>
<p>So the Big Bang then is on January 1st at 12 a.m.</p>
<p>And you wait for quite a long time</p>
<p>before the dinosaurs emerge.</p>
<p>The dinosaurs emerge on Christmas, it turns out.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>12 months, almost 12 months later.</p>
<p>Getting close to the end, yes.</p>
<p>Getting close to the end.</p>
<p>And the extinction event that let the mammals</p>
<p>and ultimately humans inherit the Earth</p>
<p>from the dinosaurs occurred on December 30th.</p>
<p>And all of human history is a small part of the last day.</p>
<p>And so, yes, so we&rsquo;re occupying only,</p>
<p>and a human lifetime is a very, very infinitesimal part</p>
<p>of this interval of these gigantic cosmic reaches of time.</p>
<p>And in space, we can tell a very similar story.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s convenient to think that the size</p>
<p>of the universe is the distance that light can travel</p>
<p>in 13.8 billion years.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s 13.8 billion light years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how far you can see out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how far signals can reach us.</p>
<p>And that is a big distance.</p>
<p>That is a big distance because compared to that, the Earth</p>
<p>is a fraction of a light second.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s really, really big.</p>
<p>And so if we wanna think about the universe</p>
<p>as a whole in space and time,</p>
<p>we really need a different kind of imagination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something you can grasp</p>
<p>in terms of psychological time in a useful way.</p>
<p>You have to think, you have to use exponential notation</p>
<p>and abstract concepts to really get any hold</p>
<p>on these vast times and spaces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let me hasten to add</p>
<p>that that doesn&rsquo;t make us small</p>
<p>or make the time that we have to us small.</p>
<p>Because again, looking at those pictures</p>
<p>of what our minds are and some of the components</p>
<p>of our minds, these beautiful drawings</p>
<p>of the cellular patterns inside the brain,</p>
<p>you see that there are many, many, many processing units.</p>
<p>And if you analyze how fast they operate,</p>
<p>I tried to estimate how many thoughts</p>
<p>a person can have in a lifetime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a fuzzy question,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very proud that I was able</p>
<p>to define it pretty precisely.</p>
<p>And it turns out we have time for billions</p>
<p>of meaningful thoughts in a lifetime.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t think of ourselves as terribly small</p>
<p>either in space or in time,</p>
<p>because although we&rsquo;re small in those dimensions</p>
<p>compared to the universe, we&rsquo;re large compared</p>
<p>to meaningful units of processing information</p>
<p>and being able to conceptualize and understand things.</p>
<p>Yeah, but 99% of those thoughts are probably food,</p>
<p>sex, or internet related.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, well, they&rsquo;re not necessarily, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Only like point one is Nobel Prize winning ideas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but there&rsquo;s more to life</p>
<p>than winning Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p>How did you do that calculate?</p>
<p>Can you maybe break that apart a little bit,</p>
<p>just kind of for fun, sort of an intuition</p>
<p>of how we calculate the number of thoughts?</p>
<p>The number of thoughts, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s necessarily imprecise because a lot of things</p>
<p>are going on in different ways and what is a thought.</p>
<p>But there are several things that point</p>
<p>to more or less the same rate of being able</p>
<p>to have meaningful thoughts.</p>
<p>For instance, the one that I think is maybe</p>
<p>the most penetrating is how fast</p>
<p>we can process visual images.</p>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever watched old movies,</p>
<p>you can see that, well, any movie, in fact,</p>
<p>a motion picture is really not a motion picture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a series of snapshots that are playing</p>
<p>one after the other and it&rsquo;s because our brains</p>
<p>also work that way.</p>
<p>We take snapshots of the world, integrate over a certain time</p>
<p>and then go on to the next one and then by post processing,</p>
<p>create the illusion of continuity and flow,</p>
<p>we can deal with that.</p>
<p>And if the flicker rate is too slow,</p>
<p>then you start to see that it&rsquo;s a series of snapshots</p>
<p>and you can ask, what is the crossover?</p>
<p>When does it change from being something</p>
<p>that is matched to our processing speed versus too fast?</p>
<p>And it turns out about 40 per second.</p>
<p>And then if you take 40 per second as how well,</p>
<p>how fast we can process visual images,</p>
<p>you get to several billions of thoughts.</p>
<p>If you, similarly, if you ask what are some</p>
<p>of the fastest things that people can do?</p>
<p>Well, they can play video games,</p>
<p>they can play the piano very fast if they&rsquo;re skilled at it.</p>
<p>And again, you get to similar units</p>
<p>or how fast can people talk?</p>
<p>You get to similar, you know,</p>
<p>within a couple of orders of magnitude,</p>
<p>you get more or less to the same idea.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how you can say that there&rsquo;s billions</p>
<p>of meaningful, there&rsquo;s room for billions</p>
<p>of meaningful thoughts.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t argue for exactly two billion versus 1.8 billion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that kind of question,</p>
<p>but I think any estimate that&rsquo;s reasonable</p>
<p>will come out within, say, 100 billion and 100 million.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to map out</p>
<p>for an individual human being the landscape of thoughts</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve sort of traveled.</p>
<p>If you think of thoughts as a set of trajectories,</p>
<p>what that landscape looks like.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been recently really thinking</p>
<p>about this Richard Dawkins idea of memes</p>
<p>and just all this ideas and the evolution of ideas</p>
<p>inside of one particular human mind</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;re then changed and evolved</p>
<p>by interaction with other human beings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think about.</p>
<p>So if you think the number is billions,</p>
<p>you think there&rsquo;s also social interaction.</p>
<p>So these aren&rsquo;t like there&rsquo;s interaction</p>
<p>in the same way you have interaction with particles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s interaction between human thoughts</p>
<p>that perhaps that interaction in itself</p>
<p>is fundamental to the process of thinking.</p>
<p>Like without social interaction,</p>
<p>we would be like stuck, like walking in a circle.</p>
<p>We need the perturbation of other humans</p>
<p>to create change and evolution.</p>
<p>Once you bring in concepts of interactions</p>
<p>and correlations and relations,</p>
<p>then you have what&rsquo;s called a combinatorial explosion</p>
<p>that the number of possibilities expands exponentially</p>
<p>technically with the number of things you&rsquo;re considering.</p>
<p>And it can easily rapidly outstrip these billions</p>
<p>of thoughts that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So we definitely cannot by brute force</p>
<p>master complex situations</p>
<p>or think of all the possibilities in a complex situations.</p>
<p>I mean, even something as relatively simple as chess</p>
<p>is still something that human beings</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t comprehend completely.</p>
<p>Even the best players lose, still sometimes lose</p>
<p>and they consistently lose to computers these days.</p>
<p>And in computer science, there&rsquo;s a concept of NP complete.</p>
<p>So large classes of problems when you scale them up</p>
<p>beyond a few individuals become intractable.</p>
<p>And so that in that sense, the world is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>And that makes it beautiful that we can make any laws</p>
<p>that generalize efficiently and well</p>
<p>can compress all of that combinatorial complexity</p>
<p>just like a simple rule.</p>
<p>That in itself is beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a happy situation.</p>
<p>And I think that we can find general principles</p>
<p>of sort of of the operating system</p>
<p>that are comprehensible, simple, extremely powerful</p>
<p>and let us control things very well</p>
<p>and ask profound questions.</p>
<p>And on the other hand,</p>
<p>that the world is going to be inexhaustible.</p>
<p>That once we start asking about relationships</p>
<p>and how they evolve and social interactions</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll never have a theory of everything</p>
<p>in any meaningful sense because that.</p>
<p>Of everything, everything, truly everything is.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about the Big Bang?</p>
<p>So we talked about the space and time are really big.</p>
<p>But then, and we humans give a lot of meaning</p>
<p>to the word space and time in our like daily lives.</p>
<p>But then can we talk about this moment of beginning</p>
<p>and how we&rsquo;re supposed to think about it?</p>
<p>That at the moment of the Big Bang,</p>
<p>everything was what, like infinitely small</p>
<p>and then it just blew up?</p>
<p>We have to be careful here</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a common misconception</p>
<p>that the Big Bang is like the explosion of a bomb</p>
<p>in empty space that fills up the surrounding place.</p>
<p>It is space.</p>
<p>It is, yeah.</p>
<p>As we understand it, it&rsquo;s the fact,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fact or the hypothesis,</p>
<p>but well supported up to a point</p>
<p>that everywhere in the whole universe,</p>
<p>early in the history,</p>
<p>matter came together into a very hot, very dense,</p>
<p>if you run it backwards in time,</p>
<p>matter comes together into a very hot, very dense</p>
<p>and yet very homogeneous plasma</p>
<p>of all the different kinds of elementary particles</p>
<p>and quarks and anti quarks and gluons</p>
<p>and photons and electrons and anti electrons,</p>
<p>everything, all of that stuff.</p>
<p>Like really hot.</p>
<p>Really, really, really hot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about way, way hotter</p>
<p>than the surface of the sun.</p>
<p>Well, in fact, if you take the equations as they come,</p>
<p>the prediction is that the temperature</p>
<p>just goes to infinity,</p>
<p>but then the equations break down.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really, there are various,</p>
<p>the equations become infinity equals infinity,</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t feel that it&rsquo;s called a singularity.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>This is running the equations backwards,</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t really get a sensible idea</p>
<p>of what happened before the Big Bang.</p>
<p>So we need different equations</p>
<p>to address the very earliest moments.</p>
<p>But so things were hotter and denser.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know why things started out that way.</p>
<p>We have a lot of evidence that they did start out that way.</p>
<p>But since most of the,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t get to visit there and do controlled experiments.</p>
<p>Most of the record is very, very processed</p>
<p>and we have to use very subtle techniques</p>
<p>and powerful instruments to get information</p>
<p>that has survived.</p>
<p>Get closer and closer to the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Get closer and closer to the beginning of things.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s revealed there is that, as I said,</p>
<p>there undoubtedly was a period</p>
<p>when everything in the universe</p>
<p>that we have been able to look at and understand,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s consistent with everything,</p>
<p>is in a condition where it was much, much hotter</p>
<p>and much, much denser,</p>
<p>but still obeying the laws of physics</p>
<p>as we know them today.</p>
<p>And then you start with that.</p>
<p>So all the matter is in equilibrium.</p>
<p>And then with small quantum fluctuations</p>
<p>and run it forward,</p>
<p>and then it produces, at least in broad strokes,</p>
<p>the universe we see around us today.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll ever be able to,</p>
<p>with the tools of physics, with the way science is,</p>
<p>with the way the human mind is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll ever be able to get to the moment of the Big Bang</p>
<p>in our understanding or even the moment before the Big Bang?</p>
<p>Can we understand what happened before the Big Bang?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic both that we&rsquo;ll be able to measure more,</p>
<p>so observe more,</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ll be able to figure out more.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very, very tangible prospects</p>
<p>for observing the extremely early universe,</p>
<p>so even much earlier than we can observe now</p>
<p>through looking at gravitational waves.</p>
<p>Gravitational waves, since they interact so weakly</p>
<p>with ordinary matter,</p>
<p>sort of send a minimally processed signal from the Big Bang.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very weak signal</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s traveled a long way</p>
<p>and diffused over long spaces,</p>
<p>but people are gearing up to try to detect</p>
<p>gravitational waves that could have come</p>
<p>from the early universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, LIGO&rsquo;s an incredible engineering project.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most sensitive, precise devices on Earth.</p>
<p>The fact that humans can build something like that</p>
<p>is truly awe inspiring from an engineering perspective.</p>
<p>Right, but these gravitational waves from the early universe</p>
<p>will probably be of a much longer wavelength</p>
<p>than LIGO is capable of sensing,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a beautiful project</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s contemplated to put lasers</p>
<p>in different locations in the solar system.</p>
<p>We really, really separate it</p>
<p>by solar system scale differences,</p>
<p>like artificial planets or moons in different places</p>
<p>and see the tiny motions of those</p>
<p>relative to one another</p>
<p>as a signal of radiation from the Big Bang.</p>
<p>We can also maybe indirectly see the imprint</p>
<p>of gravitational waves from the early universe</p>
<p>on the photons, the microwave background radiation.</p>
<p>That is our present way of seeing into the earliest universe,</p>
<p>but those photons interact much more strongly with matter.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much more strongly processed,</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t give us directly such an unprocessed view</p>
<p>of the early universe, of the very early universe,</p>
<p>but if gravitational waves leave some imprint on that</p>
<p>as they move through, we could detect that too,</p>
<p>and people are trying, as we speak,</p>
<p>working very hard towards that goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so exciting to think about a sensor</p>
<p>the size of the solar system.</p>
<p>That would be a fantastic,</p>
<p>I mean, that would be a pinnacle artifact</p>
<p>of human endeavor to me.</p>
<p>It would be such an inspiring thing</p>
<p>that just we want to know,</p>
<p>and we go to these extraordinary lengths</p>
<p>of making gigantic things that are also very sophisticated</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>you have to understand how they move.</p>
<p>You have to understand the properties of light</p>
<p>that are being used, the interference between light,</p>
<p>and you have to be able to make the light with lasers</p>
<p>and understand the quantum theory</p>
<p>and get the timing exactly right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an extraordinary endeavor</p>
<p>involving all kinds of knowledge</p>
<p>from the very small to the very large,</p>
<p>and all in the service of curiosity</p>
<p>and built on a grand scale, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, it would make me proud to be a human if we did that.</p>
<p>I love that you&rsquo;re inspired both by the power of theory</p>
<p>and the power of experiment.</p>
<p>So both, I think, are exceptionally impressive</p>
<p>that the human mind can come up with theories</p>
<p>that give us a peek into how the universe works,</p>
<p>but also construct tools that are way bigger</p>
<p>than the evolutionary origins we came from.</p>
<p>Right, and by the way,</p>
<p>the fact that we can design such things and they work</p>
<p>is an extraordinary demonstration</p>
<p>that we really do understand a lot.</p>
<p>And then in some ways.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s our ability to answer questions</p>
<p>that also leads us to be able</p>
<p>to address more ambitious questions.</p>
<p>So you mentioned at the Big Bang in the early days,</p>
<p>things are pretty homogeneous.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But here we are, sitting on Earth,</p>
<p>two hairless apes, you could say, with microphones.</p>
<p>In talking about the brief history of things,</p>
<p>you said it&rsquo;s much harder to describe Sweden</p>
<p>than it is the universe.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of complexity.</p>
<p>There was a lot of interesting details here.</p>
<p>So how does this complexity come to be, do you think?</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s these pockets.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how rare of like where hairless apes emerge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then that came from the initial soup</p>
<p>that was homogeneous.</p>
<p>Was that an accident?</p>
<p>Well, we understand in broad outlines</p>
<p>how it could happen.</p>
<p>We certainly don&rsquo;t understand why it happened exactly</p>
<p>in the way it did.</p>
<p>Or there are certainly open questions</p>
<p>about the origins of life</p>
<p>and how inevitable the emergence of intelligence was</p>
<p>and how that happened.</p>
<p>But in the very broadest terms,</p>
<p>the universe early on was quite homogeneous,</p>
<p>but not completely homogeneous.</p>
<p>There were part in 10,000 fluctuations in density</p>
<p>within this primordial plasma.</p>
<p>And as time goes on, there&rsquo;s an instability</p>
<p>which causes those density contrasts to increase.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gravitational instability</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s denser, the gravitational attractions</p>
<p>are stronger.</p>
<p>And so that brings in more matter</p>
<p>and it gets even denser and so on and so on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a natural tendency of matter to clump</p>
<p>because of gravitational interactions.</p>
<p>And then the equation is complicated.</p>
<p>We have lots of things clumping together.</p>
<p>Then we know what the laws are,</p>
<p>but we have to a certain extent wave our hands</p>
<p>about what happens.</p>
<p>But basic understanding of chemistry</p>
<p>says that if things and the physics of radiation</p>
<p>tells us that as things start to clump together,</p>
<p>they can radiate, give off some energy.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t just, they slow down.</p>
<p>As a result, they lose energy.</p>
<p>They can collaborate together, cool down,</p>
<p>form things like stars, form things like planets.</p>
<p>And so in broad terms, there&rsquo;s no mystery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what the scenario,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the equations tell you should happen.</p>
<p>But because it&rsquo;s a process involving</p>
<p>many, many fundamental individual units,</p>
<p>the application of the laws that govern individual units</p>
<p>to these things is very delicate,</p>
<p>computationally very difficult.</p>
<p>And more profoundly, the equations have</p>
<p>this probability of chaos or sensitivity</p>
<p>to initial conditions, which tells you tiny differences</p>
<p>in the initial state can lead to enormous differences</p>
<p>in the subsequent behavior.</p>
<p>So physics, fundamental physics at some point says,</p>
<p>okay, chemists, biologists, this is your problem.</p>
<p>And then again, in broad terms,</p>
<p>we know how it&rsquo;s conceivable that the humans</p>
<p>and things like that, how complex structure can emerge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of having the right kind of temperature</p>
<p>and the right kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So you need to be able to make chemical bonds</p>
<p>that are reasonably stable</p>
<p>and be able to make complex structures.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re very fortunate that carbon has this ability</p>
<p>to make backbones and elaborate branchings and things.</p>
<p>So you can get complex things that we call biochemistry.</p>
<p>And yet the bonds can be broken a little bit</p>
<p>with the help of energetic injections from the sun.</p>
<p>So you have to have both the possibility of changing,</p>
<p>but also the useful degree of stability.</p>
<p>And we know at that very, very broad level, physics</p>
<p>can tell you that it&rsquo;s conceivable.</p>
<p>If you want to know what really happened,</p>
<p>what really can happen, then you have to work a bit,</p>
<p>go to chemistry.</p>
<p>If you want to know what actually happened,</p>
<p>then you really have to consult the fossil record</p>
<p>and biologists.</p>
<p>And so these ways of addressing the issue</p>
<p>are complimentary in a sense.</p>
<p>They use different kinds of concepts,</p>
<p>they use different languages</p>
<p>and they address different kinds of questions,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not inconsistent, they&rsquo;re just complimentary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think about those early fluctuations</p>
<p>as our earliest ancestors.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s amazing to think that this is the modern answer</p>
<p>to the, or the modern version of what the Hindu philosophers</p>
<p>had, that art thou.</p>
<p>If you ask what, okay, those little quantum fluctuations</p>
<p>in the early universe are the seeds out of which complexity,</p>
<p>including plausibly humans, really evolve.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need anything else.</p>
<p>That brings up the question of asking for a friend here</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s other pockets of complexity,</p>
<p>commonly called as alien intelligent civilizations out there.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know for sure,</p>
<p>but I have a strong suspicion that the answer is yes</p>
<p>because the one case we do have at hand to study</p>
<p>here on Earth, we sort of know what the conditions were</p>
<p>that were helpful to life,</p>
<p>the right kind of temperature, the right kind of star</p>
<p>that keeps, maintains that temperature for a long time,</p>
<p>the liquid environment of water.</p>
<p>And once those conditions emerged on Earth,</p>
<p>which was roughly four and a half billion years ago,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t very long before what we call life</p>
<p>started to leave relics.</p>
<p>So we can find forms of life, primitive forms of life</p>
<p>that are almost as old as the Earth itself</p>
<p>in the sense that once the Earth was turned</p>
<p>from a very hot boiling thing</p>
<p>and cooled off into a solid mass with water,</p>
<p>life emerged very, very quickly.</p>
<p>So it seems that these general conditions for life</p>
<p>are enough to make it happen relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Now, the other lesson I think that one can draw</p>
<p>from this one example, it&rsquo;s dangerous to draw lessons</p>
<p>from one example, but that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>and that the emergence of intelligent life</p>
<p>is a different issue altogether.</p>
<p>That took a long time and seems to have been</p>
<p>pretty contingent for a long time.</p>
<p>Well, for most of the history of life,</p>
<p>it was single celled things.</p>
<p>Even multicellular life only rose</p>
<p>about 600 million years ago, so much after.</p>
<p>And then intelligence is kind of a luxury.</p>
<p>Many more kinds of creatures have big stomachs</p>
<p>than big brains.</p>
<p>In fact, most have no brains at all in any reasonable sense.</p>
<p>And the dinosaurs ruled for a long, long time</p>
<p>and some of them were pretty smart,</p>
<p>but they were at best bird brains</p>
<p>because birds came from the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>And it could have stayed that way.</p>
<p>And then the emergence of humans was very contingent</p>
<p>and kind of a very, very recent development</p>
<p>on evolutionary timescales.</p>
<p>And you can argue about the level of human intelligence,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very impressive and can ask these kinds of questions</p>
<p>and discuss them intelligently.</p>
<p>So I guess my, so this is a long winded answer</p>
<p>or justification of my feeling</p>
<p>is that the conditions for life in some form</p>
<p>are probably satisfied many, many places</p>
<p>around the universe and even within our galaxy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure about the emergence of intelligent life</p>
<p>or the emergence of technological civilizations.</p>
<p>That seems much more contingent and special.</p>
<p>And we might, it&rsquo;s conceivable to me</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re the only example in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Although, yeah, I don&rsquo;t know one way or the other.</p>
<p>I have different opinions on different days of the week.</p>
<p>But one of the things that worries me</p>
<p>in the spirit of being humble,</p>
<p>that our particular kind of intelligence</p>
<p>is not very special.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all kinds of different intelligences.</p>
<p>And even more broadly,</p>
<p>there could be many different kinds of life.</p>
<p>So the basic definition, and I just had,</p>
<p>I think somebody that you know, Sarah Walker,</p>
<p>I just had a very long conversation with her</p>
<p>about even just the very basic question</p>
<p>of trying to define what is life from a physics perspective.</p>
<p>Even that question within itself,</p>
<p>I think one of the most fundamental questions</p>
<p>in science and physics and everything</p>
<p>is just trying to get a hold,</p>
<p>trying to get some universal laws</p>
<p>around the ideas of what is life</p>
<p>because that kind of unlocks a bunch of things</p>
<p>around life, intelligence, consciousness,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I agree with you in a sense,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s a dangerous question</p>
<p>because the answer can&rsquo;t be any more precise</p>
<p>than the question.</p>
<p>And the question, what is life,</p>
<p>kind of assumes that we have a definition of life</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s a natural phenomena</p>
<p>that can be distinguished.</p>
<p>But really there are edge cases like viruses</p>
<p>and some people would like to say</p>
<p>that electrons have consciousness.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t, if you really have fuzzy concepts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to reach precise kinds of scientific answers.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a very fruitful question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s adjacent to it,</p>
<p>which has been pursued in different forms</p>
<p>for quite a while</p>
<p>and is now becoming very sophisticated</p>
<p>in reaching in new directions.</p>
<p>And that is, what are the states of matter</p>
<p>that are possible?</p>
<p>So in high school or grade school,</p>
<p>you learn about solids, liquids and gases,</p>
<p>but that really just scratches the surface</p>
<p>of different ways that are distinguishable,</p>
<p>that matter can form into macroscopically different,</p>
<p>meaningful patterns that we call phases.</p>
<p>And then there are precise definitions</p>
<p>of what we mean by phases of matter</p>
<p>and that have been worked out fruitful over the decades.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re discovering new states of matter all the time</p>
<p>and kind of having to work at what we mean by matter.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re discovering the capabilities of matter</p>
<p>to organize in interesting ways.</p>
<p>And some of them, like liquid crystals,</p>
<p>are important ingredients of life.</p>
<p>Our cell membranes are liquid crystals,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very important to the way they work.</p>
<p>Recently, there&rsquo;s been a development</p>
<p>in where we&rsquo;re talking about states of matter</p>
<p>that are not static, but that have dynamics,</p>
<p>that have characteristic patterns,</p>
<p>not only in space, but in time.</p>
<p>These are called time crystals,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s been a development</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just in the last decade or so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really, really flourishing.</p>
<p>And so is there a state of matter</p>
<p>or a group of states of matter that corresponds to life?</p>
<p>Maybe, but the answer can&rsquo;t be any more definite</p>
<p>than the question.</p>
<p>I mean, I gotta push back on the,</p>
<p>those are just words.</p>
<p>I mean, I disagree with you.</p>
<p>The question points to a direction.</p>
<p>The answer might be able to be more precise</p>
<p>than the question, because just as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>there is a, we could be discovering</p>
<p>certain characteristics and patterns</p>
<p>that are associated with a certain type of matter,</p>
<p>macroscopically speaking,</p>
<p>and that we can then be able to post facto say,</p>
<p>this is, let&rsquo;s assign the word life to this kind of matter.</p>
<p>I agree with that completely, that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s not a disagreement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very frequent in physics that, or in science,</p>
<p>that words that are in common use</p>
<p>get refined and reprocessed into scientific terms</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happened for things like force and energy.</p>
<p>And so we, in a way, we find out</p>
<p>what the useful definition is, or symmetry, for instance.</p>
<p>And the common usage may be quite different</p>
<p>from the scientific usage,</p>
<p>but the scientific usage is special</p>
<p>and takes on a life of its own,</p>
<p>and we find out what the useful version of it is,</p>
<p>the fruitful version of it is.</p>
<p>So I do think, so in that spirit,</p>
<p>I think if we can identify states of matter</p>
<p>or linked states of matter that can carry on processes</p>
<p>of self reproduction and development</p>
<p>and information processing,</p>
<p>we might be tempted to classify those things as life.</p>
<p>Well, can I ask you about the craziest one,</p>
<p>which is the one we know maybe least about,</p>
<p>which is consciousness.</p>
<p>Is it possible that there are certain kinds of matter</p>
<p>would be able to classify as conscious,</p>
<p>meaning like, so there&rsquo;s the panpsychists, right,</p>
<p>who are the philosophers who kind of try to imply</p>
<p>that all matter has some degree of consciousness,</p>
<p>and you can almost construct like a physics of consciousness.</p>
<p>Do you, again, we&rsquo;re in such early days of this,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, it seems useful to talk about it.</p>
<p>Is there some sense from a physics perspective</p>
<p>to make sense of consciousness?</p>
<p>Is there some hope?</p>
<p>Well, again, consciousness is a very imprecise word</p>
<p>and loaded with connotations that I think we should,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t wanna start a scientific analysis with that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often been important in science</p>
<p>to start with simple cases and work up.</p>
<p>Consciousness, I think what most people think of</p>
<p>when you talk about consciousness is,</p>
<p>okay, what am I doing in the world?</p>
<p>This is my experience.</p>
<p>I have a rich inner life and experience,</p>
<p>and where is that in the equations?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a great question,</p>
<p>a great, great question,</p>
<p>and actually, I think I&rsquo;m gearing up to spend part of,</p>
<p>I mean, to try to address that in coming years.</p>
<p>One version of asking that question,</p>
<p>just as you said now,</p>
<p>is what is the simplest formulation of that to study?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m much more comfortable</p>
<p>with the idea of studying self awareness</p>
<p>as opposed to consciousness,</p>
<p>because that sort of gets rid of the mystical aura of the thing.</p>
<p>And self awareness is in simple,</p>
<p>you know, I think contiguous at least</p>
<p>with ideas about feedback.</p>
<p>So if you have a system that looks at its own state</p>
<p>and responds to it, that&rsquo;s a kind of self awareness.</p>
<p>And more sophisticated versions</p>
<p>could be like in information processing things,</p>
<p>computers that look into their own internal state</p>
<p>and do something about it.</p>
<p>And I think that could also be done in neural nets.</p>
<p>This is called recurrent neural nets,</p>
<p>which are hard to understand and kind of a frontier.</p>
<p>So I think understanding those</p>
<p>and gradually building up a kind of profound ability</p>
<p>to conceptualize different levels of self awareness.</p>
<p>What do you have to not know?</p>
<p>And what do you have to know?</p>
<p>And when do you know that you don&rsquo;t know it?</p>
<p>Or when do you, what do you think you know</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t really know?</p>
<p>And these, I think clarifying those issues,</p>
<p>when we clarify those issues</p>
<p>and get a rich theory around self awareness,</p>
<p>I think that will illuminate the questions</p>
<p>about consciousness in a way that, you know,</p>
<p>scratching your chin and talking about qualia</p>
<p>and blah, blah, blah, blah is never gonna do.</p>
<p>Well, I also have a different approach to the whole thing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, from a robotics perspective,</p>
<p>you can engineer things that exhibit qualities</p>
<p>of consciousness without understanding how things work.</p>
<p>And from that perspective, you, it&rsquo;s like a back door,</p>
<p>like enter through the psychology door.</p>
<p>Precisely, I think we&rsquo;re on the same wavelength here.</p>
<p>I think that, and let me just add one comment,</p>
<p>which is I think we should try to understand consciousness</p>
<p>as we experience it as, in evolutionary terms,</p>
<p>and ask ourselves, why, why does it happen?</p>
<p>This thing seems useful.</p>
<p>Why is it useful?</p>
<p>Interesting question.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve got a conscious eyewatch here.</p>
<p>Interesting question.</p>
<p>Thank you, Siri.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get back to you later.</p>
<p>The, and I think what we&rsquo;re gonna,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m morally certain that what&rsquo;s gonna emerge</p>
<p>from analyzing recurrent neural nets</p>
<p>and robotic design and advanced computer design</p>
<p>is that having this kind of looking at the internal state</p>
<p>in a structured way that doesn&rsquo;t look at everything,</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s has, it&rsquo;s encapsulated,</p>
<p>looks at highly processed information,</p>
<p>is very selective and makes choices</p>
<p>without knowing how they&rsquo;re made.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;ll also be an unconscious.</p>
<p>I think that that is gonna be,</p>
<p>turn out to be really essential</p>
<p>to doing efficient information processing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it evolved,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s helpful in,</p>
<p>because brains come at a high cost.</p>
<p>So there has to be, there has to be a good why.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason, yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re rare in evolution and big brains</p>
<p>are rare in evolution and they, they come at a big cost.</p>
<p>You mean, if you, you, they, they,</p>
<p>they have high metabolic demands.</p>
<p>They require, you know, very active lifestyle,</p>
<p>warm bloodedness and take, take away from the ability</p>
<p>to support metabolism of digestion.</p>
<p>And so, so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it comes at a high cost.</p>
<p>It has to, it has to pay back.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it has a lot of value in social interaction.</p>
<p>So I actually am spending the rest of the day today</p>
<p>and with our friends that are,</p>
<p>our legged friends in robotic form at Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>And I think, so my probably biggest passion</p>
<p>is human robot interaction.</p>
<p>And it seems that consciousness from the perspective</p>
<p>of the robot is very useful to improve</p>
<p>the human robot interaction experience.</p>
<p>The first, the display of consciousness,</p>
<p>but then to me, there&rsquo;s a gray area</p>
<p>between the display of consciousness and consciousness itself.</p>
<p>If you think of consciousness</p>
<p>from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>it seems like a useful tool in human communication, so.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s certainly, well,</p>
<p>whatever consciousness is will turn out to be.</p>
<p>I think addressing it through its use</p>
<p>and working up from simple cases</p>
<p>and also working up from engineering experience</p>
<p>in trying to do efficient computation,</p>
<p>including efficient management of social interactions</p>
<p>is going to really shed light on these questions.</p>
<p>As I said, in a way that sort of musing abstractly</p>
<p>about consciousness never would.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned, I talked to Sarah Walker</p>
<p>and first of all, she says, hi, spoke very highly of you.</p>
<p>One of her concerns about physics and physicists and humans</p>
<p>is that we may not fully understand the system</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re inside of.</p>
<p>Meaning like, there may be limits</p>
<p>to the kind of physics we do</p>
<p>in trying to understand the system of which we&rsquo;re part of.</p>
<p>So like, the observer is also the observed.</p>
<p>In that sense, it seems like</p>
<p>our tools of understanding the world,</p>
<p>I mean, this is mostly centered around the questions</p>
<p>of what is life, trying to understand the patterns</p>
<p>that are characteristic of life and intelligence,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not using the right tools because we&rsquo;re in the system.</p>
<p>Is there something that resonates with you there?</p>
<p>Almost like&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, yes, we have limitations, of course,</p>
<p>in the amount of information we can process.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can get help from our Silicon friends</p>
<p>and we can get help from all kinds of instruments</p>
<p>that make up for our perceptual deficits.</p>
<p>And we can use, at a conceptual level,</p>
<p>we can use different kinds of concepts</p>
<p>to address different kinds of questions.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what problem she&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem akin to an organism living in a 2D plane</p>
<p>trying to understand a three dimensional world.</p>
<p>Well, we can do that.</p>
<p>I mean, in fact, for practical purposes,</p>
<p>most of our experience is two dimensional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to move vertically.</p>
<p>And yet we&rsquo;ve produced conceptually</p>
<p>a three dimensional symmetry</p>
<p>and in fact, four dimensional space time.</p>
<p>So by thinking in appropriate ways and using instruments</p>
<p>and getting consistent accounts and rich accounts,</p>
<p>we find out what concepts are necessary.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see any end in sight of the process</p>
<p>or any showstoppers because, let me give you an example.</p>
<p>I mean, for instance, QCD,</p>
<p>our theory of the strong interaction,</p>
<p>has nice equations, which I helped to discover.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s QCD?</p>
<p>Quantum chromodynamics.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s our theory of the strong interaction,</p>
<p>the interaction that is responsible for nuclear physics.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the interaction that governs</p>
<p>how quarks and gluons interact with each other</p>
<p>and make protons and neutrons</p>
<p>and all the strong, the related particles</p>
<p>and many things in physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the four basic forces of nature</p>
<p>as we presently understand it.</p>
<p>And so we have beautiful equations,</p>
<p>which we can test in very special circumstances</p>
<p>using at high energies, at accelerators.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re certain that these equations are correct.</p>
<p>Prizes are given for it and so on.</p>
<p>And people try to knock it down and they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the situations in which we can calculate</p>
<p>the consequences of these equations are very limited.</p>
<p>So for instance, no one has been able to demonstrate</p>
<p>that this theory, which is built on quarks and gluons,</p>
<p>which no one, which you don&rsquo;t observe,</p>
<p>actually produces protons and neutrons</p>
<p>and the things you do observe.</p>
<p>This is called the problem of confinement.</p>
<p>So no one&rsquo;s been able to prove that analytically</p>
<p>in a way that a human can understand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can take these equations</p>
<p>to a computer, to gigantic computers and compute.</p>
<p>And by God, you get the world from it.</p>
<p>So these equations in a way that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>in terms of human concepts, we can&rsquo;t do the calculations,</p>
<p>but our machines can do them.</p>
<p>So with the help of what I like to call our silicon friends</p>
<p>and their descendants in the future,</p>
<p>we can understand in a different way</p>
<p>that allows us to understand more.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever, no human is ever going</p>
<p>to be able to solve those equations in the same way.</p>
<p>So, but I think that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>when we find limitations to our natural abilities,</p>
<p>we can try to find workarounds.</p>
<p>And sometimes that&rsquo;s appropriate concepts.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s appropriate instruments.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a combination of the two.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s premature to get defeatist about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any logical contradiction</p>
<p>or paradox or limitation</p>
<p>that will bring this process to a halt.</p>
<p>Well, I think the idea is to continue thinking</p>
<p>outside the box in different directions,</p>
<p>meaning just like how the math allows us</p>
<p>to think in multiple dimensions</p>
<p>outside of our perception system, sort of thinking,</p>
<p>you know, coming up with new tools</p>
<p>of mathematics or computation or all those kinds of things</p>
<p>to take different perspectives on our universe.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m all for that.</p>
<p>You know, and I kind of have even elevated into a principle</p>
<p>which is of complementarity following Bohr</p>
<p>that you need different ways of thinking</p>
<p>even about the same things</p>
<p>in order to do justice to their reality</p>
<p>and answer different kinds of questions about them.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve several times alluded to the fact</p>
<p>that human beings are hard to understand</p>
<p>and the concepts that you use to understand human beings</p>
<p>if you wanna prescribe drugs for them</p>
<p>or see what&rsquo;s gonna happen if they move very fast</p>
<p>or are exposed to radiation.</p>
<p>And so that requires one kind of thinking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very physical based on the fact</p>
<p>that the materials that were made out of.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to understand</p>
<p>how a person&rsquo;s going to behave</p>
<p>in a different kind of situation,</p>
<p>you need entirely different concepts from psychology</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>You can have very different ways</p>
<p>of addressing the same material</p>
<p>that are useful for different purposes, right?</p>
<p>Can you describe this idea</p>
<p>which is fascinating of complementarity a little bit?</p>
<p>Sort of first of all, what state is the principle?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>And second of all, what are good examples</p>
<p>starting from quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>You used to mention psychology.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about this more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in your new book</p>
<p>one of the most fascinating ideas actually.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful, yeah.</p>
<p>To me it&rsquo;s, well, it&rsquo;s the culminating chapter of the book</p>
<p>and I think since the whole book is about the big lessons</p>
<p>or big takeaways from profound understanding</p>
<p>of the physical world that we&rsquo;ve achieved,</p>
<p>including that it&rsquo;s mysterious in some ways,</p>
<p>this was the final overarching lesson, complementarity.</p>
<p>Lesson, complementarity and it&rsquo;s a approach.</p>
<p>So unlike some of these other things</p>
<p>which are just facts about the world,</p>
<p>like the world is both big and small</p>
<p>and different sizes and is big but we&rsquo;re not small,</p>
<p>things we talked about earlier</p>
<p>and the fact that the universe is comprehensible</p>
<p>and how complexity could emerge from simplicity</p>
<p>and so those things are in the broad sense</p>
<p>facts about the world.</p>
<p>Complementarity is more an attitude towards the world</p>
<p>than encouraged by the facts about the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the concept or the approach</p>
<p>or the realization that it can be appropriate</p>
<p>and useful and inevitable and unavoidable</p>
<p>to use very different descriptions of the same object</p>
<p>or the same system or the same situation</p>
<p>to answer different kinds of questions</p>
<p>that may be very different</p>
<p>and even mutually uninterpretable,</p>
<p>immutually incomprehensible.</p>
<p>But both correct somehow.</p>
<p>But both correct and sources of different kinds of insight</p>
<p>which is so weird.</p>
<p>But it seems to work in so many cases.</p>
<p>It works in many cases and I think it&rsquo;s a deep fact</p>
<p>about the world and how we should approach it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s most rigorous form where it&rsquo;s actually a theorem</p>
<p>if quantum mechanics is correct,</p>
<p>occurs in quantum mechanics</p>
<p>where the primary description of the world</p>
<p>is in terms of wave functions.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s not talk about the world.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just talk about a particle, an electron.</p>
<p>The primary description of that electron</p>
<p>is its wave function.</p>
<p>And the wave function can be used to predict</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>If you observe, it&rsquo;ll be in different places</p>
<p>with different probabilities or how fast it&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll also be moving in different ways</p>
<p>with different probabilities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what quantum mechanics says.</p>
<p>And you can predict either set of probabilities</p>
<p>if you know what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>if I make an observation of the position or the velocity.</p>
<p>So the wave function gives you ways of doing both of those.</p>
<p>But to do it, to get those predictions,</p>
<p>you have to process the wave function in different ways.</p>
<p>You process it one way for position</p>
<p>and in a different way for momentum.</p>
<p>And those ways are mathematically incompatible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have a stone</p>
<p>and you can sculpt it into a Venus de Milo</p>
<p>or you can sculpt it into David, but you can&rsquo;t do both.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an example of complementarity.</p>
<p>To answer different kinds of questions,</p>
<p>you have to analyze the system in different ways</p>
<p>that are mutually incompatible,</p>
<p>but both valid to answer different kinds of questions.</p>
<p>So in that case, it&rsquo;s a theorem,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a much more widespread phenomena</p>
<p>that applies to many cases</p>
<p>where we can&rsquo;t prove it as a theorem,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a piece of wisdom, if you like,</p>
<p>and appears to be a very important insight.</p>
<p>And if you ignore it,</p>
<p>you can get very confused and misguided.</p>
<p>Do you think this is a useful hack</p>
<p>for ideas that we don&rsquo;t fully understand?</p>
<p>Or is this somehow a fundamental property</p>
<p>of all or many ideas,</p>
<p>that you can take multiple perspectives</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both true?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both the answer to all questions.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not either or, it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s paralyzing to think that we live in a world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fundamentally surrounded by complementary ideas.</p>
<p>Because we somehow want to attach ourselves</p>
<p>to absolute truths,</p>
<p>and absolute truths certainly don&rsquo;t like the idea</p>
<p>of complementarity.</p>
<p>Yes, Einstein was very uncomfortable with complementarity.</p>
<p>And in a broad sense,</p>
<p>the famous Bohr Einstein debates</p>
<p>revolved around this question</p>
<p>of whether the complementarity</p>
<p>that is a foundational feature of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>as we have it,</p>
<p>is a permanent feature of the universe</p>
<p>and our description of nature.</p>
<p>And so far, quantum mechanics wins.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gone from triumph to triumph.</p>
<p>Whether complementarity is rock bottom,</p>
<p>I guess, you can never be sure.</p>
<p>I mean, but it looks awfully good</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been very successful.</p>
<p>And certainly, complementarity has been extremely useful</p>
<p>and fruitful in that domain,</p>
<p>including some of Einstein&rsquo;s attempts to challenge it</p>
<p>with the famous Einstein Podolsky Rosen experiment</p>
<p>turned out to be confirmations</p>
<p>that have been useful in themselves.</p>
<p>But so thinking about these things was fruitful,</p>
<p>but not in the way that Einstein hoped.</p>
<p>Yeah, so as I said, in the case of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and this dilemma or dichotomy</p>
<p>between processing the wave function in different ways,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a theorem.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mutually incompatible</p>
<p>and the physical correlate of that</p>
<p>is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have position and momentum determined at once.</p>
<p>But in other cases, like one that I like to think about</p>
<p>or like to point out as an example</p>
<p>is free will and determinism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much less of a theorem</p>
<p>and more a kind of way of thinking about things</p>
<p>that I think is reassuring</p>
<p>and avoids a lot of unnecessary quarreling and confusion.</p>
<p>The quarreling I&rsquo;m okay with</p>
<p>and the confusion I&rsquo;m okay with,</p>
<p>I mean, people debate about difficult ideas,</p>
<p>but the question is whether it could be</p>
<p>almost a fundamental truth.</p>
<p>I think it is a fundamental truth.</p>
<p>That free will is both an illusion and not.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why people say quantum mechanics is weird</p>
<p>and complementarity is a big part of that.</p>
<p>To say that our actual whole world is weird,</p>
<p>the whole hierarchy of the universe is weird</p>
<p>in this kind of particular way,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite profound, but it&rsquo;s also humbling</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re never going to be on sturdy ground</p>
<p>in the way that humans like to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have to embrace that this whole thing</p>
<p>is like unsteady mess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of many lessons in humility</p>
<p>that we run into in profound understanding of the world.</p>
<p>The Copernican revolution was one,</p>
<p>that the earth is not the center of the universe.</p>
<p>Darwinian evolution is another,</p>
<p>that humans are not the pinnacle of God&rsquo;s creation and the apparent result</p>
<p>of deep understanding of physical reality,</p>
<p>that mind emerges from matter and there&rsquo;s no call</p>
<p>on special life forces or souls.</p>
<p>These are all lessons in humility,</p>
<p>and I actually find complementarity a liberating concept.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, okay, you know, we&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it is in a way.</p>
<p>That is what I remember.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a story about Dr. Johnson,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s talking with Boswell,</p>
<p>and Boswell was, they were discussing a sermon</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d both heard,</p>
<p>and the sort of culmination of the sermon was the speaker saying,</p>
<p>I accept the universe.</p>
<p>And Dr. Johnson said, well, damn well better.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain joy in accepting the universe</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s mind expanding.</p>
<p>And to me, complementarity also suggests tolerance,</p>
<p>suggests opportunities for understanding things</p>
<p>in different ways that add to rather than detract</p>
<p>from understanding.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s an opportunity for mind expansion</p>
<p>and demanding that there&rsquo;s only one way</p>
<p>to think about things can be very limiting.</p>
<p>On the free will one, that&rsquo;s a trippy one, though.</p>
<p>To think like I am the decider of my own actions</p>
<p>and at the same time I&rsquo;m not is tricky to think about,</p>
<p>but there does seem to be some kind of profound truth in that.</p>
<p>I get, well, I think it is tied up.</p>
<p>It will turn out to be tied up when we understand things better</p>
<p>with these issues of self awareness and where we get,</p>
<p>what we perceive as making choices,</p>
<p>what does that really mean and what&rsquo;s going on under the hood.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m speculating about a future understanding</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not in place at present.</p>
<p>Your sense there will always be,</p>
<p>like as you dig into the self awareness thing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll always be some places</p>
<p>where complementarity is gonna show up.</p>
<p>Oh, definitely, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there will be, how should I say?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be kind of a God&rsquo;s eye view</p>
<p>which sees everything that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in the computer or the brain.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the brain&rsquo;s own view</p>
<p>or the central processor or whatever it is,</p>
<p>what we call the self, the consciousness,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only aware of a very small part of it.</p>
<p>And those are very different.</p>
<p>Those are, so the God&rsquo;s eye view can be deterministic</p>
<p>while the self view sees free will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s gonna work out actually.</p>
<p>But as it stands, free will is a concept</p>
<p>that we definitely, at least I feel I definitely experience,</p>
<p>I can choose to do one thing then another.</p>
<p>And other people I think are sufficiently similar to me</p>
<p>that I trust that they feel the same way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an essential concept in psychology</p>
<p>and law and so forth.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I think that mind emerges from matter</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s an alternative description of matter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s up to subtleties about quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think are relevant here,</p>
<p>really is deterministic.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about some particles.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First the absurd question,</p>
<p>almost like a question that like Plato would ask.</p>
<p>What is the smallest thing in the universe?</p>
<p>As far as we know, the fundamental particles</p>
<p>out of which we build our most successful description</p>
<p>of nature are points.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any internal structure.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s as small as can be.</p>
<p>So what does that mean operationally?</p>
<p>That means that they obey equations that describe entities</p>
<p>that are singular concentrations of energy,</p>
<p>momentum, angular momentum,</p>
<p>the things that particles have,</p>
<p>but localized at individual points.</p>
<p>Now that mathematical structure</p>
<p>is only revealed partially in the world</p>
<p>because to process the wave function</p>
<p>in a way that accesses information about the precise</p>
<p>position of things, you have to apply a lot of energy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an idealization</p>
<p>and you can apply infinite amount of energy</p>
<p>to determine a precise position.</p>
<p>But at the mathematical level,</p>
<p>we build the world out of particles that are points.</p>
<p>So do they actually exist and what are we talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, they exist.</p>
<p>So let me ask sort of do quarks exist?</p>
<p>Yes, do electrons exist?</p>
<p>Yes, do photons exist?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But what does it mean for them to exist?</p>
<p>Okay, so well, the hard answer to that,</p>
<p>the precise answer is that we construct the world</p>
<p>out of equations that contain entities</p>
<p>that are reproducible,</p>
<p>that exist in vast numbers throughout the universe,</p>
<p>that have definite properties of mass,</p>
<p>spin and a few others that we call electrons</p>
<p>and what an electron is is defined by the equations</p>
<p>that it satisfies theoretically</p>
<p>and we find that there are many, many exemplars</p>
<p>of that entity in the physical world.</p>
<p>So in the case of electrons,</p>
<p>we can isolate them and study them</p>
<p>and individual ones in great detail</p>
<p>and we can check that they all actually are identical</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why chemistry works and yes.</p>
<p>So in that case, it&rsquo;s very tangible.</p>
<p>Similarly with photons,</p>
<p>you can study them individually, the units of light</p>
<p>and nowadays, it&rsquo;s very practical</p>
<p>to study individual photons</p>
<p>and determine their spin and their other basic properties</p>
<p>and check out the equations in great detail.</p>
<p>For quarks and gluons,</p>
<p>which are the other two main ingredients</p>
<p>of our model of matter that&rsquo;s so successful,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little more complicated</p>
<p>because the quarks and gluons that appear in our equations</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t appear directly as particles you can isolate</p>
<p>and study individually.</p>
<p>They always occur within what are called bound states</p>
<p>or structures like protons.</p>
<p>A proton, roughly speaking, is composed of three quarks</p>
<p>and a lot of gluons but we can detect them</p>
<p>in a remarkably direct way actually nowadays,</p>
<p>whereas at relatively low energies,</p>
<p>the behavior of quarks is complicated.</p>
<p>At high energies, they can propagate through space</p>
<p>relatively freely for a while and we can see their tracks.</p>
<p>So ultimately, they get recaptured into protons</p>
<p>and other mesons and funny things</p>
<p>but for a short time, they propagate freely</p>
<p>and while that happens, we can take snapshots</p>
<p>and see their manifestations.</p>
<p>Actually, this kind of thing is exactly</p>
<p>what I got the Nobel Prize for,</p>
<p>predicting that this would work.</p>
<p>And similarly for gluons,</p>
<p>although you can&rsquo;t isolate them as individual particles</p>
<p>and study them in the same way that we study electrons,</p>
<p>say, you can use them theoretically as entities</p>
<p>out of which you build tangible things</p>
<p>that we actually do observe</p>
<p>but also you can, at accelerators at high energy,</p>
<p>you can liberate them for brief periods of time</p>
<p>and study and get convincing evidence</p>
<p>that they leave tracks and you can get convincing evidence</p>
<p>that they were there and have the properties</p>
<p>that we wanted them to have.</p>
<p>Can we talk about asymptotic freedom,</p>
<p>this very idea that you won the Nobel Prize for?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it describes a very weird effect to me,</p>
<p>the weird in the following way.</p>
<p>So the way I think of most forces or interactions,</p>
<p>the closer you are, the stronger the effect,</p>
<p>the stronger the force, right?</p>
<p>With quarks, the close they are,</p>
<p>the less so the strong interaction.</p>
<p>And in fact, they&rsquo;re basically act like free particles</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re very close.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, yes.</p>
<p>But this requires a huge amount of energy.</p>
<p>Like can you describe me why, how does this even work?</p>
<p>How weird it is?</p>
<p>A proper description must bring in quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and relativity and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so a proper description and equations,</p>
<p>so a proper description really is probably more</p>
<p>than we have time for and require quite a bit of patience</p>
<p>on your part, but.</p>
<p>How does relativity come into play?</p>
<p>Wait, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Relativity is important because when we talk about</p>
<p>trying to think about short distances,</p>
<p>we have to think about very large momenta</p>
<p>and very large momenta are connected</p>
<p>to very large energy in relativity.</p>
<p>And so the connection between how things behave</p>
<p>at short distances and how things behave at high energy</p>
<p>really is connected through relativity</p>
<p>in sort of a slightly backhanded way.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics indicates that short,</p>
<p>to get to analyze short distances,</p>
<p>you need to bring in probes that carry a lot of momentum.</p>
<p>This again is related to uncertainty</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the fact that you have to bring in</p>
<p>a lot of momentum that interferes with the possibility</p>
<p>of determining position and momentum at the same time.</p>
<p>If you want to determine position,</p>
<p>you have to use instruments that bring in a lot of momentum.</p>
<p>And because of that, those same instruments</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t also measure momentum</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re disturbing the momentum that,</p>
<p>and then the momentum brings in energy and yeah.</p>
<p>So that there&rsquo;s also the effect that asymptotic freedom</p>
<p>comes from the possibility of spontaneously making</p>
<p>quarks and gluons for short amounts of time</p>
<p>that fluctuate into existence and out of existence.</p>
<p>And the fact that that can be done</p>
<p>with a very little amount of energy</p>
<p>and uncertainty and energy translates</p>
<p>into uncertainty and time.</p>
<p>So if you do that for a short time, you can do that.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s all comes in a package.</p>
<p>So I told you it would take a while to really explain,</p>
<p>but the results can be understood.</p>
<p>I mean, we can state the results pretty simply, I think.</p>
<p>So in everyday life, we do encounter some forces</p>
<p>that increase with distance</p>
<p>and kind of turn off at short distances.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way rubber bands work, if you think about it,</p>
<p>or if you pull them hard, they resist,</p>
<p>but they get flabby if the rubber band is not pulled.</p>
<p>And so there are, that can happen in the physical world,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s really difficult is to see</p>
<p>how that could be a fundamental force</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s consistent with everything else we know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what asymptotic freedom is.</p>
<p>It says that there&rsquo;s a very particular kind</p>
<p>of fundamental force that involves special particles</p>
<p>called gluons with very special properties</p>
<p>that enables that kind of behavior.</p>
<p>So there were experiment, at the time we did our work,</p>
<p>there were experimental indications</p>
<p>that quarks and gluons did have this kind of property,</p>
<p>but there were no equations</p>
<p>that were capable of capturing it.</p>
<p>And we found the equations and showed how they work</p>
<p>and showed how they, that they were basically unique.</p>
<p>And this led to a complete theory</p>
<p>of how the strong interaction works,</p>
<p>which is the quantum chromodynamics we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the phenomenon that quarks and gluons</p>
<p>interact very, very weakly when they&rsquo;re close together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s connected through relativity</p>
<p>with the fact that they also interact very, very weakly</p>
<p>at high energies.</p>
<p>So if you have, so at high energies,</p>
<p>the simplicity of the fundamental interaction gets revealed.</p>
<p>At the time we did our work,</p>
<p>the clues were very subtle,</p>
<p>but nowadays at what are now high energy accelerators,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all obvious.</p>
<p>So we would have had a much,</p>
<p>well, somebody would have had a much easier time</p>
<p>20 years later, looking at the data,</p>
<p>you can sort of see the quarks and gluons.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, they leave these short tracks</p>
<p>that would have been much, much easier,</p>
<p>but from fundamental, from indirect clues,</p>
<p>we were able to piece together enough</p>
<p>to make that behavior a prediction</p>
<p>rather than a post diction, right?</p>
<p>So it becomes obvious at high energies.</p>
<p>It becomes very obvious.</p>
<p>When we first did this work,</p>
<p>it was frontiers of high energy physics</p>
<p>and at big international conferences,</p>
<p>there would always be sessions on testing QCD</p>
<p>and whether this proposed description</p>
<p>of the strong interaction was in fact correct and so forth.</p>
<p>And it was very exciting.</p>
<p>But nowadays the same kind of work,</p>
<p>but much more precise with calculations</p>
<p>to more accuracy and experiments</p>
<p>that are much more precise</p>
<p>and comparisons that are very precise.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s called calculating backgrounds</p>
<p>because people take this for granted</p>
<p>and wanna see deviations from the theory,</p>
<p>which would be the new discoveries.</p>
<p>Yeah, the cutting edge becomes a foundation</p>
<p>and the foundation becomes boring.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is there some, for basic explanation purposes,</p>
<p>is there something to be said about strong interactions</p>
<p>in the context of the strong nuclear force</p>
<p>for the attraction between protons and neutrons</p>
<p>versus the interaction between quarks within protons?</p>
<p>Well, quarks and gluons have the same relation</p>
<p>basically to nuclear physics</p>
<p>as electrons and photons have</p>
<p>to atomic and molecular physics.</p>
<p>So atoms and photons are the dynamic entities</p>
<p>that really come into play in chemistry and atomic physics.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to have the atomic nuclei,</p>
<p>but those are small and relatively inert,</p>
<p>really the dynamical part.</p>
<p>And for most purposes of chemistry,</p>
<p>you just say that you have this tiny little nucleus,</p>
<p>which QCD gives you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>It just, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>The real action is the electrons moving around</p>
<p>and exchanging and things like that.</p>
<p>Okay, but we want it to understand the nucleus too.</p>
<p>And so atoms are sort of quantum mechanical clouds</p>
<p>of electrons held together by electrical forces,</p>
<p>which is photons.</p>
<p>And then this radiation,</p>
<p>which is another aspect of photons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where all the fun happens</p>
<p>is the electrons and the photons.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And the nucleus are kind of the,</p>
<p>well, they give the positive charge</p>
<p>and most of the mass of matter,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t, since they&rsquo;re so heavy,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t move very much in chemistry.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m oversimplifying drastically.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not contributing much to the interaction in chemistry.</p>
<p>For most purposes in chemistry,</p>
<p>you can just idealize them as concentrations</p>
<p>of positive mass and charge that are,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to look inside,</p>
<p>but people are curious what&rsquo;s inside.</p>
<p>And that was a big thing on the agenda</p>
<p>of 20th century physics starting in the 19,</p>
<p>well, starting with the 20th century</p>
<p>and unfolding throughout of trying to understand</p>
<p>what forces held the atomic nucleus together,</p>
<p>what it was and so.</p>
<p>Anyway, the story that emerges from QCD</p>
<p>is that very similar to the way that,</p>
<p>well, broadly similar to the way</p>
<p>that clouds of electrons held together</p>
<p>by electrical forces give you atoms</p>
<p>and ultimately molecules.</p>
<p>Protons and neutrons are like atoms</p>
<p>made now out of quarks, quark clouds held together</p>
<p>by gluons, which are like the photons</p>
<p>that give the electric forces,</p>
<p>but this is giving a different force, the strong force.</p>
<p>And the residual forces between protons and neutrons</p>
<p>that are leftover from the basic binding</p>
<p>are like the residual forces between atoms</p>
<p>that give molecules, but in the case of protons and neutrons,</p>
<p>it gives you atomic nuclei.</p>
<p>So again, for definitional purposes,</p>
<p>QCD, quantum chromodynamics,</p>
<p>is basically the physics of strong interaction.</p>
<p>Yeah, we understand, we now would understand,</p>
<p>I think most physicists would say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the theory of quarks and gluons</p>
<p>and how they interact.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very precise, and I think it&rsquo;s fair to say,</p>
<p>very beautiful theory based on mathematical symmetry</p>
<p>of a high order, and another thing that&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>about it is that it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>in the same family as electrodynamics.</p>
<p>The conceptual structure of the equations are very similar.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re based on having particles that respond to charge</p>
<p>in a very symmetric way.</p>
<p>In the case of electrodynamics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s photons that respond to electric charge.</p>
<p>In the case of quantum chromodynamics,</p>
<p>there are three kinds of charge that we call colors,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re nothing like colors.</p>
<p>They really are like different kinds of charge.</p>
<p>But they rhyme with the same kind of,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s similar kind of dynamics.</p>
<p>Similar kind of dynamics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to say that QCD is like QED on steroids.</p>
<p>And instead of one photon, you have eight gluons.</p>
<p>Instead of one charge, you have three color charges.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a strong family resemblance between them.</p>
<p>But the context in which QCD does this thing</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s much higher energies.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s where it comes to life.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a stronger force,</p>
<p>so that to access how it works and kind of pry things apart,</p>
<p>you have to inject more energy.</p>
<p>And so that gives us, in some sense,</p>
<p>a hint of how things were in the earlier universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, in that regard,</p>
<p>asymptotic freedom is a tremendous blessing</p>
<p>because it means things get simpler at high energy.</p>
<p>The universe was born free.</p>
<p>Born free.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very good, yes.</p>
<p>Universe was born.</p>
<p>So in atomic physics,</p>
<p>a similar thing happens in the theory of stars.</p>
<p>Stars are hot enough that the interactions</p>
<p>between electrons and photons, they&rsquo;re liberated.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t form atoms anymore.</p>
<p>They make a plasma,</p>
<p>which in some ways is simpler to understand.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have complicated chemistry.</p>
<p>And in the early universe, according to QCD,</p>
<p>similarly atomic nuclei dissolved</p>
<p>and take the constituent quarks and gluons,</p>
<p>which are moving around very fast</p>
<p>and interacting in relatively simple ways.</p>
<p>And so this opened up the early universe</p>
<p>to scientific calculation.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about some other weird particles</p>
<p>that make up our universe?</p>
<p>What are axions?</p>
<p>And what is the strong CP problem?</p>
<p>Okay, so let me start with what the strong CP problem is.</p>
<p>First of all, well, C is charge conjugation,</p>
<p>which is the transformation,</p>
<p>the notional transformation, if you like,</p>
<p>that changes all particles into their antiparticles.</p>
<p>And the concept of C symmetry,</p>
<p>charge conjugation symmetry, is that if you do that,</p>
<p>you find the same laws that would work.</p>
<p>So the laws are symmetric if the behavior</p>
<p>that particles exhibit is the same</p>
<p>as the behavior you get with all their antiparticles.</p>
<p>And then P is parity,</p>
<p>which is also called spatial inversion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically looking at a mirror universe</p>
<p>and saying that the laws that are obeyed</p>
<p>in a mirror universe, when you look,</p>
<p>that the mirror images obey the same laws</p>
<p>as the sources of their images.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way of telling left from right, for instance,</p>
<p>that the laws don&rsquo;t distinguish between left and right.</p>
<p>Now, in the mid 20th century,</p>
<p>people discovered that both of those are not quite true.</p>
<p>Really, the equation that the mirror universe,</p>
<p>the universe that you see in a mirror</p>
<p>is not gonna obey the same laws</p>
<p>as the universe that we actually interpret.</p>
<p>You would be able to tell</p>
<p>if you did the right kind of experiments,</p>
<p>which was the mirror and which was the real thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the parity and they show</p>
<p>that the parity doesn&rsquo;t necessarily hold.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t quite hold.</p>
<p>Examining what the exceptions are turned out to be,</p>
<p>to lead to all kinds of insight</p>
<p>about the nature of fundamental interactions,</p>
<p>especially properties of neutrinos</p>
<p>and the weak interaction, it&rsquo;s a long story.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very, it&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>So you just define the C and the P,</p>
<p>the conjugation, the charge conjugation.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve done that, I wanna.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>Shove them off.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s easier to talk about T,</p>
<p>which is time reversal symmetry.</p>
<p>We have very good reasons to think CPT</p>
<p>is an accurate symmetry of nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the same level as relativity</p>
<p>and quantum mechanics, basically.</p>
<p>So that better be true.</p>
<p>Or else we.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s symmetric when you.</p>
<p>When you do.</p>
<p>When you do conjugation parity and time.</p>
<p>And time and space reversal.</p>
<p>If you do all three,</p>
<p>then you get the same physical consequences.</p>
<p>Now, so, but that means that CP is equivalent to T.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s observed in the world</p>
<p>is that T is not quite an accurate symmetry of nature,</p>
<p>either.</p>
<p>So most phenomena of, at the fundamental level.</p>
<p>So interactions among elementary particles</p>
<p>and the basic gravitational interaction.</p>
<p>If you ran them backwards in time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get the same laws.</p>
<p>So if, again, going back.</p>
<p>This time we don&rsquo;t talk about a mirror,</p>
<p>but we talk about a movie.</p>
<p>If you take a movie and then run it backwards,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the time reversal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to think about a mirror in time.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like a mirror in time.</p>
<p>If you run the movie backwards,</p>
<p>it would look very strange</p>
<p>if you were looking at complicated objects</p>
<p>and a Charlie Chaplin movie or whatever.</p>
<p>It would look very strange if you ran it backwards in time.</p>
<p>But at the level of basic interactions,</p>
<p>if you were able to look at the atoms</p>
<p>and the quarks involved, they would obey the same laws.</p>
<p>They do a very good approximation, but not exactly.</p>
<p>So this is not exactly, that means you could tell.</p>
<p>You could tell, but you&rsquo;d have to do very, very</p>
<p>subtle experiments with at high energy accelerators</p>
<p>to take a movie that looked different</p>
<p>when you ran it backwards.</p>
<p>This was a discovery by two great physicists</p>
<p>named Jim Cronin and Val Fitch in the mid 1960s.</p>
<p>Previous to that, over all the centuries</p>
<p>of development of physics with all its precise laws,</p>
<p>they did seem to have this gratuitous property</p>
<p>that they look the same if you run the equations backwards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of an embarrassing property actually</p>
<p>because life isn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>So empirical reality does not have this imagery</p>
<p>in any obvious way.</p>
<p>And yet the laws did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the laws of physics</p>
<p>are missing something fundamental about life</p>
<p>if it holds that property, right?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the embarrassing nature of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>Well, people worked hard at what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>this is a problem that&rsquo;s thought to belong</p>
<p>to the foundations of statistical mechanics</p>
<p>or the foundations of thermodynamics</p>
<p>to understand how behavior,</p>
<p>which is grossly not symmetric</p>
<p>with respect to reversing the direction of time</p>
<p>in large objects, how that can emerge from equations</p>
<p>which are symmetric with respect to changing</p>
<p>the direction of time to a very good approximation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s still an interesting endeavor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And actually it&rsquo;s an exciting frontier of physics now</p>
<p>to sort of explore the boundary</p>
<p>between when that&rsquo;s true and when it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>When you get to smaller objects</p>
<p>and exceptions like time crystals.</p>
<p>I definitely have to ask you about time crystals</p>
<p>in a second here.</p>
<p>But so the CP problem and T,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s all of these.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in danger of infinite regress,</p>
<p>but we have to convert soon.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t possibly be turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get to the bottom turtle.</p>
<p>So it became,</p>
<p>so it got to be a real,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a really puzzling thing</p>
<p>why the laws should have this very odd property</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s kind of an embarrassment</p>
<p>in addressing empirical reality.</p>
<p>But it seemed to be almost,</p>
<p>it seemed to be exactly true for a long time.</p>
<p>And then almost true.</p>
<p>And in way, almost true is even,</p>
<p>is more disturbing than exactly true</p>
<p>because exactly true,</p>
<p>it could have been just a fundamental feature of the world.</p>
<p>And at some level you just have to take it as it is.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a beautiful, easily articulatable regularity,</p>
<p>you could say that, okay,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine as a fundamental law of nature.</p>
<p>But to say that it&rsquo;s approximately true,</p>
<p>but not exactly, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>So, and then, so there was great progress</p>
<p>in the late part of the 20th century</p>
<p>in getting to an understanding</p>
<p>of fundamental interactions in general</p>
<p>that shed light on this issue.</p>
<p>It turns out that the basic principles of relativity</p>
<p>and quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>plus the kind of high degree of symmetry that we found,</p>
<p>the so called gauge symmetry</p>
<p>that characterizes the fundamental interactions,</p>
<p>when you put all that together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very, very constraining framework.</p>
<p>And it has some indirect consequences</p>
<p>because the possible interactions are so constrained.</p>
<p>And one of the indirect consequences</p>
<p>is that the possibilities for violating the symmetry</p>
<p>between forwards and backwards in time are very limited.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically only two.</p>
<p>And one of them occurs and leads to a very rich theory</p>
<p>that explains the Cronin Fish experiment</p>
<p>and a lot of things that have been done subsequently</p>
<p>has been used to make all kinds of successful predictions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s turned out to be a very rich interaction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s esoteric and the effects only show up at accelerators</p>
<p>and are small and so on,</p>
<p>but they might&rsquo;ve been very important in the early universe</p>
<p>and lead to them be connected to the asymmetry</p>
<p>between matter and antimatter in the present universe.</p>
<p>And so, but that&rsquo;s another digression.</p>
<p>The point is that that was fine.</p>
<p>That was a triumph to say</p>
<p>that there was one possible kind of interaction</p>
<p>that would violate time reversal symmetry.</p>
<p>And sure enough, there it is.</p>
<p>But the other kind doesn&rsquo;t occur.</p>
<p>So we still got a problem.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t it occur?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re close to really finally understanding</p>
<p>this profound gratuitous feature of the world</p>
<p>that is almost but not quite symmetric</p>
<p>under reversing the direction of time, but not quite there.</p>
<p>And to understand that last bit</p>
<p>is a challenging frontier of physics today.</p>
<p>And we have a promising proposal for how it works,</p>
<p>which is a kind of theory of evolution.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this possible interaction,</p>
<p>which we call a coupling,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a numerical quantity</p>
<p>that tells us how strong that is.</p>
<p>And traditionally in physics,</p>
<p>we think of these kinds of numerical quantities</p>
<p>as constants of nature that you just have to put them in.</p>
<p>From experiment, they have a certain value and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And who am I to question what God doing?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just constant.</p>
<p>Well, they seem to be just constants.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering.</p>
<p>But in this case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been fruitful to think and work out a theory</p>
<p>where that strength of interaction</p>
<p>is actually not a constant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun, it&rsquo;s a field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, fields are the fundamental ingredients</p>
<p>of modern physics.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s an electron field,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a photon field,</p>
<p>which is also called the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>And so all of these particles</p>
<p>are manifestations of different fields.</p>
<p>And there could be a field,</p>
<p>something that depends on space and time.</p>
<p>So a dynamical entity instead of just a constant here.</p>
<p>And if you do things in a nice way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very symmetric,</p>
<p>very much suggested aesthetically by the theory.</p>
<p>But the theory we do have,</p>
<p>then you find that you get a field</p>
<p>which as it evolves from the early universe,</p>
<p>settles down to a value</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just right to make the laws</p>
<p>very nearly exact, invariant or symmetric</p>
<p>with respect to reversal of time.</p>
<p>It might appear as a constant,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually a field that evolved over time.</p>
<p>It evolved over time, okay.</p>
<p>But when you examine this proposal in detail,</p>
<p>you find that it hasn&rsquo;t quite settled down to exactly zero.</p>
<p>There it&rsquo;s still,</p>
<p>the field is still moving around a little bit.</p>
<p>And because the motion is so,</p>
<p>the motion is so difficult.</p>
<p>The material is so rigid.</p>
<p>And this material,</p>
<p>the field that fills all space is so rigid.</p>
<p>Even small amounts of motion can involve lots of energy.</p>
<p>And that energy takes the form of particles,</p>
<p>fields that are in motion</p>
<p>are always associated with particles.</p>
<p>And those are the axioms.</p>
<p>And if you calculate how much energy</p>
<p>is in these residual oscillations,</p>
<p>this axiom gas that fills all the universe,</p>
<p>if this fundamental theory is correct,</p>
<p>you get just the right amount</p>
<p>to make the dark matter that astronomers want.</p>
<p>And it has just the right properties.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love to believe that.</p>
<p>So that might be a thing that unlocks,</p>
<p>might be the key to understanding dark matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d like to think so.</p>
<p>And many, many physicists are coming around</p>
<p>to this point of view,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve been a voice in the wilderness.</p>
<p>I was a voice in the wilderness for a long time,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s become very popular, maybe even dominant.</p>
<p>So almost like,</p>
<p>so this axion particle slash field</p>
<p>would be the thing that explains dark matter.</p>
<p>It explains, yeah,</p>
<p>would solve this fundamental question of finally,</p>
<p>of why the laws are almost, but not quite exactly the same</p>
<p>if you run them backwards in time.</p>
<p>And then seemingly in a totally different</p>
<p>conceptual universe,</p>
<p>it would also provide,</p>
<p>give us an understanding of the dark matter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what it was designed for.</p>
<p>And the theory wasn&rsquo;t proposed with that in mind,</p>
<p>but when you work out the equations, that&rsquo;s what you get.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always a good sign.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think I vaguely read somewhere</p>
<p>that there may be early experimental validation of axion.</p>
<p>Is that, am I reading the wrong?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;ve been quite a few false alarms</p>
<p>and I think there are some of them still,</p>
<p>people desperately wanna find this thing.</p>
<p>And, but I don&rsquo;t think any of them are convincing</p>
<p>at this point,</p>
<p>but there are very ambitious experiments</p>
<p>and kind of new,</p>
<p>you have to design new kinds of antennas</p>
<p>that are capable of detecting these predicted particles.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>They interact very, very weakly.</p>
<p>If it were easy, it would have been done already.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s good hope</p>
<p>that we can get down to the required sensitivity</p>
<p>and actually test whether these ideas are right</p>
<p>in coming years or maybe decades.</p>
<p>And then understand one of the big mysteries,</p>
<p>like literally big in terms of its fraction</p>
<p>of the universe is dark matter.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about, you mentioned a few times,</p>
<p>time crystals.</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>These things are, it&rsquo;s a very beautiful idea</p>
<p>when we start to treat space and time</p>
<p>as similar frameworks.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>Physical phenomena.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s what motivated it.</p>
<p>First of all, what are crystals?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what are time crystals?</p>
<p>Okay, so crystals are orderly arrangements</p>
<p>of atoms in space.</p>
<p>And many materials,</p>
<p>if you cool them down gently, will form crystals.</p>
<p>And so we say that that&rsquo;s a state of matter</p>
<p>that forms spontaneously.</p>
<p>And an important feature of that state of matter</p>
<p>is that the end result, the crystal,</p>
<p>has less symmetry than the equations</p>
<p>that give rise to the crystal.</p>
<p>So the equations, the basic equations of physics</p>
<p>are the same if you move a little bit.</p>
<p>So you can move, they&rsquo;re homogeneous,</p>
<p>but crystals aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The atoms are in particular place,</p>
<p>so they have less symmetry.</p>
<p>And time crystals are the same thing in time, basically.</p>
<p>But of course, so it&rsquo;s not positions of atoms,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s orderly behavior that certain states of matter</p>
<p>will arrange themselves into spontaneously</p>
<p>if you treat them gently</p>
<p>and let them do what they want to do.</p>
<p>But repeat in that same way indefinitely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the crystalline form.</p>
<p>You can also have time liquids,</p>
<p>or you can have all kinds of other states of matter.</p>
<p>You can also have space time crystals</p>
<p>where the pattern only repeats if with each step of time,</p>
<p>you also move at a certain direction in space.</p>
<p>So yeah, basically it&rsquo;s states of matter</p>
<p>that displace structure in time spontaneously.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>When it happens in time,</p>
<p>it sure looks a lot like it&rsquo;s motion,</p>
<p>and if it repeats indefinitely,</p>
<p>it sure looks a lot like perpetual motion.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like looks like free lunch.</p>
<p>And I was told that there&rsquo;s no such thing as free lunch.</p>
<p>Does this violate laws of thermodynamics?</p>
<p>No, but it requires a critical examination</p>
<p>of the laws of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>I mean, let me say on background</p>
<p>that the laws of thermodynamics</p>
<p>are not fundamental laws of physics.</p>
<p>There are things we prove</p>
<p>under certain circumstances emerge</p>
<p>from the fundamental laws of physics.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, we don&rsquo;t posit them separately.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re meant to be deduced,</p>
<p>and they can be deduced under limited circumstances,</p>
<p>but not necessarily universally.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re finding some of the subtleties</p>
<p>and sort of accept edge cases</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t apply in a straightforward way.</p>
<p>And this is one.</p>
<p>So time crystals do obey,</p>
<p>do have this structure in time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a free lunch</p>
<p>because although in a sense, things are moving,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re already doing what they want to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the,</p>
<p>so if you want to extract energy from it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be foiled</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no spare energy there.</p>
<p>So you can add energy to it and kind of disturb it,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t extract energy from this motion</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna, it wants to do,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the lowest energy configuration that there is,</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t get further energy out of it.</p>
<p>So in theory, I guess perpetual motion,</p>
<p>you would be able to extract energy from it</p>
<p>if such a thing was to be created,</p>
<p>you can then milk it for energy.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s usually meant</p>
<p>in the literature of perpetual motion</p>
<p>is a kind of macroscopic motion</p>
<p>that you could extract energy from</p>
<p>and somehow it would crank back up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the case here.</p>
<p>If you want to extract energy,</p>
<p>this motion is not something you can extract energy from.</p>
<p>If you intervene in the behavior,</p>
<p>you can change it, but only by injecting energy,</p>
<p>not by taking away energy.</p>
<p>You mentioned that a theory of everything</p>
<p>may be quite difficult to come by.</p>
<p>A theory of everything broadly defined</p>
<p>meaning like truly a theory of everything,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s look at a more narrow theory of everything,</p>
<p>which is the way it&rsquo;s used often in physics</p>
<p>is a theory that unifies our current laws of physics,</p>
<p>general relativity, quantum field theory.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts on this dream</p>
<p>of a theory of everything in physics?</p>
<p>How close are we?</p>
<p>Is there any promising ideas out there in your view?</p>
<p>Well, it would be nice to have.</p>
<p>It would be aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Will it be useful?</p>
<p>No, probably not.</p>
<p>Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s dangerous to say that,</p>
<p>but probably not.</p>
<p>I think we, certainly not in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Maybe to understand black holes.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s, yes, maybe to understand black holes,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not useful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my book.</p>
<p>And well, not only, I mean,</p>
<p>to understand it&rsquo;s worse,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not useful in the sense</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not gonna be basing any technology anytime soon</p>
<p>on black holes, but it&rsquo;s more severe than that,</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s that the kinds of questions</p>
<p>about black holes that we can&rsquo;t answer</p>
<p>within the framework of existing theory</p>
<p>are ones that are not going to be susceptible</p>
<p>to astronomical observation in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re questions about very, very small black holes</p>
<p>when quantum effects come into play</p>
<p>so that black holes are,</p>
<p>not black holes, they&rsquo;re emitting this discovery</p>
<p>of Hawking called Hawking radiation,</p>
<p>which for astronomical black holes is a tiny, tiny effect</p>
<p>that no one has ever observed, it&rsquo;s a prediction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s never been checked.</p>
<p>So like supermassive black holes, that doesn&rsquo;t apply?</p>
<p>No, no, the predicted rate of radiation</p>
<p>from those black holes is so tiny</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s absolutely unobservable</p>
<p>and is overwhelmed by all kinds of other effects.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not practical in the sense of technology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even practical in the sense</p>
<p>of application to astronomy, our existing theory</p>
<p>of general relativity and quantum theory</p>
<p>and our theory of the different fundamental forces</p>
<p>is perfectly adequate to all problems of technology,</p>
<p>of technology, for sure, and almost all problems</p>
<p>of astrophysics and cosmology that appear</p>
<p>except with the notable exception</p>
<p>of the extremely early universe, if you want to ask,</p>
<p>what happened before the Big Bang</p>
<p>or what happened right at the Big Bang,</p>
<p>which would be a great thing to understand, of course.</p>
<p>Yes. We don&rsquo;t, but.</p>
<p>But what about the engineering question?</p>
<p>So if we look at space travel,</p>
<p>so I think you&rsquo;ve spoken with him, Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Really, you know,</p>
<p>he says things like we want to get off this planet.</p>
<p>His intuition is almost motivated</p>
<p>for the engineering project of space exploration</p>
<p>in order for us to crack this problem</p>
<p>of becoming a multi planetary species,</p>
<p>we have to solve the physics problem.</p>
<p>His intuition is like, if we figure out this,</p>
<p>what he calls the source code, which is like,</p>
<p>like a theory of everything might give us clues</p>
<p>on how to start hacking the fabric of reality,</p>
<p>like getting shortcuts, right?</p>
<p>It might. I can&rsquo;t say that, you know,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that it won&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but I can say that in the 1970s and early 1980s,</p>
<p>we achieved huge steps in understanding matter.</p>
<p>QCD, much better understanding of the weak interaction,</p>
<p>much better understanding of quantum mechanics in general.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s had minimal impact on technology.</p>
<p>On rocket design, on propulsion.</p>
<p>On rocket design, on anything, any technology whatsoever.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re talking about much more esoteric things.</p>
<p>And since I don&rsquo;t know what they are,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say for sure that they won&rsquo;t affect technology,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very, very skeptical</p>
<p>that they would affect technology.</p>
<p>Because, you know, to access them,</p>
<p>you need very exotic circumstances</p>
<p>to make new kinds of particles with high energy.</p>
<p>You need accelerators that are very expensive</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t produce many of them, and so forth.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a pipe dream, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, about space exploration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what he has in mind,</p>
<p>but to me, it&rsquo;s more a problem of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, something between biology and&hellip;</p>
<p>And information processing.</p>
<p>Processing, what you mean, how should I&hellip;</p>
<p>I think human bodies are not well adapted to space.</p>
<p>Even Mars, which is the closest thing</p>
<p>to a kind of human environment</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna find anywhere close by.</p>
<p>Very, very difficult to maintain humans on Mars.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna be very expensive and very unstable.</p>
<p>But I think, however, if we take a broader view</p>
<p>of what it means to bring human civilization</p>
<p>outside of the Earth, if we&rsquo;re satisfied</p>
<p>with sending mines out there that we can converse with</p>
<p>and actuators that we can manipulate</p>
<p>and sensors that we can get feedback from,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s so much more realistic.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the long term future</p>
<p>of space exploration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hauling human bodies all over the place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just silly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that human bodies&hellip;</p>
<p>So like you said, it&rsquo;s a biology problem.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s possible is that we extend human life span</p>
<p>in some way, we have to look at a bigger picture.</p>
<p>It could be just like you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>by sending robots with actuators</p>
<p>and kind of extending our limbs.</p>
<p>But it could also be extending some aspect of our minds,</p>
<p>some information, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And it could be cyborgs, it could be, it could be&hellip;</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re talking, not getting the fun.</p>
<p>It could be, you know, it could be human brains</p>
<p>or cells that realize something</p>
<p>like human brain architecture</p>
<p>within artificial environments,</p>
<p>you know, shells, if you like,</p>
<p>that are more adapted to the conditions of space.</p>
<p>And that, yeah, so that&rsquo;s entirely man machine hybrids,</p>
<p>as well as sort of remote outposts</p>
<p>that we can communicate with.</p>
<p>I think those will happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, to me, there&rsquo;s some sense in which,</p>
<p>as opposed to understanding the physics</p>
<p>of the fundamental fabric of the universe,</p>
<p>I think getting to the physics of life,</p>
<p>the physics of intelligence,</p>
<p>the physics of consciousness will,</p>
<p>the physics of information that brings,</p>
<p>from which life emerges,</p>
<p>that will allow us to do space exploration.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think physics in the larger sense</p>
<p>has a lot to contribute here.</p>
<p>Not the physics of finding fundamental new laws</p>
<p>in the sense of another quark or axions even.</p>
<p>But physics in the sense of,</p>
<p>physics has a lot of experience</p>
<p>in analyzing complex situations</p>
<p>and analyzing new states of matter</p>
<p>and devising new kinds of instruments</p>
<p>that do clever things.</p>
<p>Physics in that sense has enormous amounts</p>
<p>to contribute to this kind of endeavor.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that looking</p>
<p>for a so called theory of everything</p>
<p>has much to do with it at all.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today</p>
<p>with a bit of fire in their eyes,</p>
<p>high school student, college student,</p>
<p>thinking about what to do with their life,</p>
<p>maybe advice about career or bigger advice</p>
<p>about life in general?</p>
<p>Well, first read fundamentals</p>
<p>because there I&rsquo;ve tried to give some coherent deep advice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fundamentals, 10 keys to reality by Frank Kulczyk.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good place to start.</p>
<p>Available everywhere.</p>
<p>If you wanna learn what I can tell you.</p>
<p>Is there an audio book?</p>
<p>I read that ebook.</p>
<p>Yes, there is an audio book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an audio book, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I can give three pieces of wise advice</p>
<p>that I think are generally applicable.</p>
<p>One is to cast a wide net,</p>
<p>to really look around and see what looks promising,</p>
<p>what catches your imagination and promising.</p>
<p>Yeah, and those, you have to balance those two things.</p>
<p>You could have things that catch your imagination,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t look promising in the sense</p>
<p>that the questions aren&rsquo;t ripe or,</p>
<p>and things that you,</p>
<p>and part of what makes things attractive is that,</p>
<p>whether you thought you liked them or not,</p>
<p>is if you can see that there&rsquo;s ferment</p>
<p>and new ideas coming up that become,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s attractive in itself.</p>
<p>So when I started out, I thought I was,</p>
<p>and when I was an undergraduate,</p>
<p>I intended to study philosophy</p>
<p>or questions of how mind emerges from matter.</p>
<p>But I thought that that wasn&rsquo;t really right.</p>
<p>Timing isn&rsquo;t right yet.</p>
<p>The right, the timing wasn&rsquo;t right</p>
<p>for the kind of mathematical thinking</p>
<p>and conceptualization that I really enjoy and am good at.</p>
<p>But, so that&rsquo;s one thing, cast a wide net, look around.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a pretty easy thing to do today</p>
<p>because of the internet.</p>
<p>You can look at all kinds of things.</p>
<p>You have to be careful though</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of crap also.</p>
<p>But you can sort of tell the difference</p>
<p>if you do a little digging.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t settle on just,</p>
<p>what your thesis advisor tells you to do</p>
<p>or what your teacher tells you to do.</p>
<p>Look for yourself and get a sense of what seems promising,</p>
<p>not what seemed promising 10 years ago or, so that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Another thing is to, is kind of complimentary to that.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re all complimentary.</p>
<p>Complimentary to that is to read history</p>
<p>and read the masters,</p>
<p>the history of ideas and masters of ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d benefited enormously from, as early in my career,</p>
<p>from reading in physics, Einstein in the original</p>
<p>and Feynman&rsquo;s lectures as they were coming out and Darwin.</p>
<p>You know, these, you can learn what it, and Galileo,</p>
<p>you can learn what it is to wrestle with difficult ideas</p>
<p>and how great minds did that.</p>
<p>You can learn a lot about style,</p>
<p>how to write your ideas up and express them in clear ways.</p>
<p>And also just a couple of that with,</p>
<p>I also enjoy reading biographies.</p>
<p>And biographies, yes, similarly, right, yeah.</p>
<p>So it gives you the context of the human being</p>
<p>that created those ideas.</p>
<p>Right, and brings it down to earth in the sense that,</p>
<p>you know, it was really human beings who did this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, and they made mistakes.</p>
<p>And yeah, I also got inspiration from Bertrand Russell</p>
<p>who was a big hero and H.G. Wells and yeah.</p>
<p>So read the masters, make contact with great minds.</p>
<p>And when you are sort of narrowing down on a subject,</p>
<p>learn about the history of the subject</p>
<p>because that really puts in context</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to do and also gives a sense of community</p>
<p>and grandeur to the whole enterprise.</p>
<p>And then the third piece of advice</p>
<p>is complimentary to both those,</p>
<p>which is sort of to get the basics under control</p>
<p>as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So if you wanna do theoretical work in science,</p>
<p>you know, you have to learn calculus,</p>
<p>multivariable calculus, complex variables, group theory.</p>
<p>Nowadays, you have to be highly computer literate</p>
<p>if you want to do experimental work.</p>
<p>You also have to be computer literate</p>
<p>and you have to learn about electronics</p>
<p>and optics and instruments.</p>
<p>So get that under control as soon as possible</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like learning a language to produce great works</p>
<p>and express yourself fluently and with confidence.</p>
<p>It should be your native language.</p>
<p>These things should be like your native language.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not wondering what is the derivative?</p>
<p>This is just part of your, it&rsquo;s in your bones,</p>
<p>so to speak, and the sooner that you can do that,</p>
<p>then the better.</p>
<p>So all those things can be done in parallel and should be.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve accomplished some incredible things in your life,</p>
<p>but the sad thing about this thing we have is it ends.</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>Well, afraid is the wrong word.</p>
<p>I mean, I wish it weren&rsquo;t going to happen</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to, but.</p>
<p>Do you think about it?</p>
<p>I, you know, occasionally I think about,</p>
<p>well, I think about it very operationally</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s always a trade off</p>
<p>between exploration and exploitation.</p>
<p>This is a classic subject in computer science,</p>
<p>actually in machine learning that when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in an unusual circumstance, you want to explore</p>
<p>to see what the landscape is and what, and gather data.</p>
<p>But then at some point you want to use that,</p>
<p>make, decide, make choices and say,</p>
<p>this is what I&rsquo;m going to do and exploit the knowledge</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve accumulated.</p>
<p>And the longer the period of exploitation you anticipate,</p>
<p>the more exploration you should do in new directions.</p>
<p>And so for me, I&rsquo;ve had to sort of adjust the balance</p>
<p>of exploration and exploitation and.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, you&rsquo;ve explored quite a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I haven&rsquo;t shut off the exploitation at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still hoping for. The exploration.</p>
<p>The exploration, right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still hoping for 10 or 15 years</p>
<p>of top flight performance.</p>
<p>But the, several years ago now when I was 50 years old,</p>
<p>I was at the Institute for Advanced Study</p>
<p>and my office was right under Freeman Dyson&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and we were kind of friendly.</p>
<p>And, you know, he found out it was my 50th birthday</p>
<p>and said, congratulations.</p>
<p>And you should feel liberated because no one expects much</p>
<p>of a 50 year old theoretical physicist.</p>
<p>And he, and he obviously had felt liberated</p>
<p>by reaching a certain age.</p>
<p>And yeah, there is something to that.</p>
<p>I feel, you know, I feel I don&rsquo;t have to catch,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to keep in touch</p>
<p>with the latest hypertechnical developments</p>
<p>in particle physics or string theory or something.</p>
<p>I, because I&rsquo;m not gonna, I&rsquo;m really not gonna</p>
<p>be exploiting that.</p>
<p>But I, but where I am exploring in these directions</p>
<p>of machine learning and things like that.</p>
<p>And, but then, but I&rsquo;m also concentrating</p>
<p>within physics on exploiting directions</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve already established</p>
<p>and the laws that we already have</p>
<p>and doing things like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very actively involved in trying to design,</p>
<p>helping people, experimentalists and engineers even</p>
<p>to design antennas that are capable of detecting axions.</p>
<p>So there, and that&rsquo;s, there we&rsquo;re deep</p>
<p>in the exploitation stage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a matter of finding the new laws,</p>
<p>but of really, you know, using the laws we have</p>
<p>to kind of finish the story off.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s complicated, but I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy with my life right now</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m enjoying it and I don&rsquo;t wanna cloud that</p>
<p>by thinking too much that it&rsquo;s gonna come to an end.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a gift I didn&rsquo;t earn.</p>
<p>Is there a good thing to say about</p>
<p>why this gift that you&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t deserve is so damn enjoyable?</p>
<p>So like, what&rsquo;s the meaning of this thing, of life?</p>
<p>To me, interacting with people I love, my family,</p>
<p>and I have a very wide circle of friends now</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to produce some institutions</p>
<p>that will survive me as well as my work</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s, how should I say?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a positive feedback loop when you do something</p>
<p>and people appreciate it and then you wanna do more</p>
<p>and you get rewarded and it&rsquo;s just, how should I say?</p>
<p>This is another gift that I didn&rsquo;t earn</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t understand, but I have a dopamine system</p>
<p>and yeah, I&rsquo;m happy to use it.</p>
<p>It seems to get energized by the creative process,</p>
<p>by the process of exploration.</p>
<p>Very much so.</p>
<p>And all of that started from the little fluctuations</p>
<p>shortly after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Frank, well, whatever those initial conditions</p>
<p>and fluctuations did that created you, I&rsquo;m glad they did.</p>
<p>This is, thank you for all the work you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>for the many people you&rsquo;ve inspired,</p>
<p>for the many, of the billion, most of your ideas</p>
<p>were pretty useless of the several billions,</p>
<p>as it is for all humans, but you had quite a few</p>
<p>truly special ideas and thank you for bringing those</p>
<p>to the world and thank you for wasting your valuable time</p>
<p>with me today, it&rsquo;s truly an honor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a joy and I hope people enjoy it</p>
<p>and I think the kind of mind expansion that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed</p>
<p>by interacting with physical reality at this deep level,</p>
<p>I think can be conveyed to and enjoyed by many, many people</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of my missions in life, to share it.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Frank Wilczek and thank you to The Information,</p>
<p>NatSuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist and 8sleep.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast</p>
<p>and now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Albert Einstein, nothing happens until something moves.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
