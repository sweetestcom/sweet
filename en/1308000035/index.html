    <p>Okay, so Jason you&rsquo;re gonna send a zoom link great. I&rsquo;m gonna make love to not that would take 70 minutes</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m gonna stretch and shower</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be ready at 115. Okay. Awesome. Thanks. I just puked in my coffee a little bit, but okay</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that he does he gets seconds and minutes mixed up, you know</p>
<p>To the all-in podcast. We got a cold open. Somebody&rsquo;s gonna be a highlight. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Cold open that should be the cold open</p>
<p>My god, by the way, that&rsquo;s all right these seconds includes trim up brushing his teeth</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Hey everybody, hey everybody it is another edition episode 34 of the all-in podcast with us today</p>
<p>David Friedberg the Queen of quinoa the science</p>
<p>sorcerer of the pod Rain Man David Sachs hot off his 60th birthday bash in Los Angeles</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry that was just going by me his looks and the dictator</p>
<p>Polly hop atia fresh off of writing editorials about himself in Bloomberg. Congratulations everybody</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you. Give yourself a pat on the back for that exceptional</p>
<p>Yeah, free burgers know my favorite bestie because he actually showed up my birthday party and like you guys</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, David David. How do you expect people to react in 24 hours to 72 hours city?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a surprise. It was a surprise birthday surprise to the gas</p>
<p>It was a surprise to all the invitees as well. Let me tell you guys what you missed out on</p>
<p>Okay. All right. Wait, let&rsquo;s give background sacks is now</p>
<p>49 50 years old</p>
<p>A last-minute birthday party after I bought tickets to the Knicks in and the Nets and invited family members</p>
<p>Go ahead and now we&rsquo;re the bad guys. We fly down for the birthday</p>
<p>They you know, they shuttle you on the cars from the plane to the to the house. We get to the house long driveway</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like dudes making like watermelon tequila beverages while you hang out and wait</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some dude from America&rsquo;s Got Talent playing the guitar or playing the violin in the driveway</p>
<p>The bathrooms are nicer than the bathrooms. I have at home, you know, these be porta potties. They rented in the driveway</p>
<p>And you know, we&rsquo;re all waiting. Of course sacks is late two and a half hours to his own party</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all hanging out and starving</p>
<p>But then we go into the party sit down for dinner and then who shows up as our you know dinner experience</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the guy that won America&rsquo;s I American Idol two nights before</p>
<p>So no one knows who this guy is except 17 year old girls and myself. So I hop out of my seat</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my god, it&rsquo;s that guy from American Idol</p>
<p>I had to rush into the backstage to get a photo with him, you know, it sacks his garage</p>
<p>And then they have like coolio shows up</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like sitting down to dinner for course to all of a sudden pop comes out of the woodwork coolio</p>
<p>I lose my shit. I run up on the</p>
<p>The dance floor. I grew up coolio like it&rsquo;s like high school jams, man</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s like in the car cruising and at this point, I&rsquo;m like seven tequila watermelon tequilas in</p>
<p>Coolio I think we all thought I was sacks, you know, cuz he&rsquo;s like, yeah, he&rsquo;s like, oh to South African Jews</p>
<p>You guys all look the same coolio comes up starts high-fiving me and hugging me and I&rsquo;m like, what&rsquo;s up coolio?</p>
<p>Oh my god, this is like a dream come true</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like hugging me. His face is right next to my face</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what to say and I like I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;ve had a little bit of tequila and I whisper in coolio&rsquo;s ear</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh no, I appreciate I appreciate you</p>
<p>I think I saw Freeberg throw his panties on stage to</p>
<p>Wow, what a nerd</p>
<p>Can I go back to the part where you said that you were dancing and instantly the image I had was Julius Louis Dreyfus</p>
<p>We have to find that security footage</p>
<p>Mark Mark McGrath from Sugar Ray performing and he had that dude from cool in the gang performing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the game showed up to give sacks a birthday wish. What are the game the rapper the game the game came?</p>
<p>Yeah, the game I was just to do a movie together like 15 years ago and you know, I never panned out</p>
<p>But he still remembered me and he came by to say hi on my birthday. It was pretty incredible. Very nice</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s have you guys ever met sacks as parents? Yeah, of course. I just 40th. Yeah, they&rsquo;re so nice</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re so nice. We spent so much time with them. We&rsquo;ll love hanging out with them</p>
<p>It was a really really cool party. I&rsquo;m sorry. We missed it 72 hours is generally a</p>
<p>Shorter window than most out of city parties, but I have a better excuse</p>
<p>I had a corporate offsite for my team. So I apologize sexy. That&rsquo;s okay. We missed you guys. It was really fun</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>Invite for a party you definitely want to</p>
<p>Throw a party. She does. She knows how to throw a party. You know, it&rsquo;s how to make it. So, how does it feel being?</p>
<p>this old and just</p>
<p>Looking so exhausted David Thomas</p>
<p>Exhausted Jake aren&rsquo;t you turning 50 this summer? I was I was</p>
<p>50 in November I did. Yeah, I was in quarantine. So we&rsquo;re gonna have to have like a post. How heavy is that?</p>
<p>Give or take</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t actually super heavy for me. I mean, I think just you do think about hey, we&rsquo;re counting down</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the back nine. You want to make good use of the time you have left?</p>
<p>And so yeah, of course, it&rsquo;s something where you&rsquo;re gonna consider, you know your life, of course</p>
<p>Yeah, and just make sure you make good use of the time that you have here</p>
<p>Yeah, I think 40 was just a party but 50 feels a little bit heavy. It&rsquo;ll still be a great party</p>
<p>But it does feel a little bit</p>
<p>Metaphysical I guess yeah</p>
<p>Metaphysical right now</p>
<p>Okay, listen we didn&rsquo;t get together on Friday, but here we are recording on a Saturday and</p>
<p>Lots of stuff going on the thing. I think I&rsquo;m most interested in hearing from</p>
<p>Friedberg about is the lab leak theory and I think that this touches on a little bit of the</p>
<p>politicization of</p>
<p>Science I guess we there&rsquo;s a lab in Wuhan. I think it&rsquo;s more Trump derangement syndrome</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t allow us to see the forest from the trees and the same words just said by a different president all of a sudden</p>
<p>invokes a an investigation</p>
<p>yeah, so I mean there is a</p>
<p>Kovat laboratory in Wuhan. It is the only one in China and that&rsquo;s where the virology labs where they study viruses</p>
<p>Yes, but specifically they&rsquo;ve studied kovat viruses</p>
<p>They have yeah, that&rsquo;s I mean, that&rsquo;s a big class of virus</p>
<p>So and it&rsquo;s the only one in China and it&rsquo;s funded by America and China and the who?</p>
<p>The institute of virology. I mean this is this is I mean, this is a</p>
<p>China Institute of virology was posting job</p>
<p>wrecks two years ago for</p>
<p>specifically for researchers of bat viruses</p>
<p>We know they were studying bat viruses at this place and we want just happens to be the place</p>
<p>Where a novel coronavirus that seems derived from a bat virus, you know, it like emerges</p>
<p>I mean, what are the odds right? I mean, this was such an obvious</p>
<p>theory the idea that</p>
<p>You know kovat might have leaked from from this particular lab and yet we were forbidden</p>
<p>From talking about it, I guess till Donald Trump was out of office</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s really two stories here. One is Chinese culpability, you know in in the spread of the virus</p>
<p>The other one is the media story. Why were we not allowed to have this discussion? Why did the media?</p>
<p>Brand anybody who discussed this leak theory as being some sort of conspiracy theorist or a racist</p>
<p>Why were big tech companies censoring or removing any user-generated content from their sites that were putting forward this theory?</p>
<p>You know, why was the media and big tech doing this?</p>
<p>I mean is it somehow I can I can tell you but but somehow they were telling us it was more racist</p>
<p>To talk about a lab accident then to David because the person who could have explained it in a de-escalated factual way</p>
<p>Chose to escalate it and be emotional and superficial and that was Donald Trump</p>
<p>And so I I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think that you could point to us and say we could have changed how the narrative is</p>
<p>Exploited all of us are just normal average people on the ground</p>
<p>but there probably is</p>
<p>Sort of you know a hierarchy of like information and there probably isn&rsquo;t a single individual</p>
<p>individual beyond the president that who has access to more information and</p>
<p>So if he was if he was just more moderate and normal and basically said hey guys</p>
<p>there is a legitimate risk that we need to investigate because</p>
<p>Fast forward basically 18 months later and this president who is moderate you can like him or not like him</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s kind of moderate and unoffensive</p>
<p>Says basically that and now we have this news cycle about investigating something</p>
<p>We should have been investigating 18 months ago. Just at least to get to the bottom of it</p>
<p>What was going on but Trump had to make it such a big deal and about himself and I think that&rsquo;s a takeaway</p>
<p>But just because Trump says something doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>I mean, he is occasionally gonna say things that are true. And that&rsquo;s not what my point is</p>
<p>My point is the president of the United States. You just have to have more discipline</p>
<p>Well, but but I think you&rsquo;re right in the sense that the reason this became a forbidden topic is because the media had to act</p>
<p>Like anything Trump said is is untrue or crazy or race. It&rsquo;s a failure on both sides then David</p>
<p>I mean the the media is failing to be independent critical thinkers and</p>
<p>Trump is failing to be a good leader and be clear and that means you have to be an independent critical thinker</p>
<p>The media&rsquo;s first obligation here is to the truth</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not supposed to distort the truth or push forward a false narrative because of the political</p>
<p>Consequences and and that they didn&rsquo;t want to be seen as helping Trump in any way and that&rsquo;s really what their motivation was</p>
<p>But I find it equally disturbing that big tech was censoring the truth on this issue</p>
<p>The whole point of having a free marketplace of ideas is so that we can arrive at the truth</p>
<p>And how&rsquo;s that gonna be possible when big censoring? I really disagree with you</p>
<p>I think that the the big text decision to censor this information was a</p>
<p>Was a derivative of the first two things like I don&rsquo;t think that decision would have happened had Trump been normal and</p>
<p>Then you know</p>
<p>Media would have just listened and said, okay, maybe there&rsquo;s a chance this guy&rsquo;s right. He&rsquo;s saying and acting in a normal way</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go investigate and then big tech would have basically said we don&rsquo;t know the truth one way or the other but it seems</p>
<p>Legitimate sane people are on both sides. So it says Donald Trump published mean tweets</p>
<p>It was okay for big tech or rather the media to basically</p>
<p>Portray the correct theory as a lie and a conspiracy and it was okay for big tech to engage in censorship on that basis</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is the following the president of the United States</p>
<p>Independent and whoever it is has a very specific</p>
<p>responsibility to be measured to be unemotional and</p>
<p>To be about the bigger picture. That&rsquo;s what the president of the United States is</p>
<p>responsibility is no matter who holds the office and</p>
<p>Then the media&rsquo;s job is to fact-check that and hold that person accountable and cold that person in a transparent manner</p>
<p>Freeberg yes or no. Is it a viable theory and then let&rsquo;s get to odds and percentages</p>
<p>I mean as a scientist</p>
<p>Do you think that this is because came from a wet market or some accidental exposure or somebody eating bad or some cross</p>
<p>Contamination a bat and a pig and then somebody eats the pig or do you think somebody from the lot from the lab?</p>
<p>Accidentally brought it home with them</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know doesn&rsquo;t matter. I feel like we need to kind of recognize that bio</p>
<p>warfare</p>
<p>bioterrorism is</p>
<p>A real risk and I think more importantly that this moment whether or not it&rsquo;s proven it will never be proven or disproven one way</p>
<p>Or the other so it really doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>What will ultimately happen is we are going to kind of become much more cognizant of these sorts of threats</p>
<p>To the human population. Let me be very specific a</p>
<p>kid in high school</p>
<p>Could write up some RNA code</p>
<p>Today on their computer</p>
<p>Order that RNA to be delivered to them by what&rsquo;s called an oligo printing facility get this RNA boot it up turn it into a</p>
<p>Virus and they could release that thing into the wild</p>
<p>There are several very cheap over-the-counter internet based ways that one could do this</p>
<p>So the fact that there&rsquo;s some sophisticated government run lab doing this. I don&rsquo;t think matters as much what&rsquo;s really compelling</p>
<p>In this whole storyline is like holy shit. This is possible</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that there&rsquo;s either an engineered or discovered virus and it shows just how if these things leak out and they are infectious and they</p>
<p>Are transmissible can become a real risk to the global population and it&rsquo;s not just viruses</p>
<p>There are other mechanisms of bio warfare that can be printed and created</p>
<p>using similar techniques of genomics</p>
<p>There are proteins called prions and prions cause other proteins to fold in a mismatched way</p>
<p>This is actually what mad cow disease is it&rsquo;s a prion</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a protein that you find in the brain</p>
<p>And if you eat this particular protein ends up in your brain</p>
<p>It causes the other proteins in your brain that match that protein to misfold and it basically</p>
<p>Replicates and creates this cascading effect. So basically like aliens like aliens and in fact</p>
<p>Yeah, but I guess my point is like whether it&rsquo;s prions or or viruses</p>
<p>There are techniques and there are capabilities and instruments now that all humans have access to</p>
<p>That theoretically could allow for the booting or the creation and the distribution of</p>
<p>truly terrifying</p>
<p>tools</p>
<p>biological tools</p>
<p>Now this comes hand-in-hand with the incredible optimism and opportunity that these tools present much like chemical engineering</p>
<p>Presented in the early 20th century to humanity</p>
<p>We could create things like DDT and kill ourselves or we could create things like artificial fertilizer and feed ourselves</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this this tremendous as there is with any new technology</p>
<p>This tremendous kind of optimism and fear and it&rsquo;s gonna create I think a very powerful debate narrative over the coming decade</p>
<p>On what do we do with these tools? Is it even possible to regulate them?</p>
<p>Where is this gonna go? And and what are the risk and it&rsquo;s not necessarily just government agencies that we need to kind of be</p>
<p>Considering here. It&rsquo;s the fact that there&rsquo;s a democratization of this tooling which is enabling</p>
<p>Does it sacks does it matter if it was leaked or not Freeberg is saying it doesn&rsquo;t matter a big picture, of course</p>
<p>Of course it matters. And and the only reason we don&rsquo;t know conclusively that it came from a lab is because</p>
<p>The Chinese government wouldn&rsquo;t let they thwarted the investigation</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t let the investigators come in and</p>
<p>so the smoke is pouring out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and they will not allow the</p>
<p>Firefighters in because those firefighters come from the West</p>
<p>We could establish the truth of what happened if they would let us talk to the scientists who work at that lab if they could</p>
<p>Go, what would you do about it? Let&rsquo;s say that you find out that it did like yeah</p>
<p>Well at a minute, well, first of all, we&rsquo;re talking about a virus has killed millions of people&rsquo;s millions of people across the world. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Caused enormous damage to the economy to our economy to economies all over the world</p>
<p>You know, we have to think through carefully what the consequences would be</p>
<p>But it matters a lot how the Chinese government handled this at a minimum at a minimum</p>
<p>We need to decouple ourselves from China with regard to anything. That&rsquo;s a vital American interest</p>
<p>We cannot be dependent on them for the manufacturing of our PPE for our antibiotics for our pharmaceuticals. It is insane</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing we&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not there&rsquo;s nothing we&rsquo;re gonna do to China in terms of sanctions if we find out they covered up a leak</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s an accidental leak and they covered it up. We&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>As a it acts more as a warning sign for us to do better and be more independent</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a principle of escalation</p>
<p>They are still the critical supplier to most of American manufacturing and industry</p>
<p>Every product that American companies make most products have some sort of Chinese produced input</p>
<p>And I would start I would start with I think the measured response that&rsquo;s also in our national interest is to reassure</p>
<p>Any critical components that we need for our pharmaceutical industry?</p>
<p>So drug manufacturing and the manufacturing sanctioning China, it&rsquo;s about getting our act together Chamath</p>
<p>Do you agree with this?</p>
<p>And what do you think if we did find out that it was in fact a covered up leak, which I think is the most</p>
<p>reasonable</p>
<p>Assumption here. What should we do as America as a country global?</p>
<p>Reaction to China. I agree with Friedberg and David Sachs in in</p>
<p>parts</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing to do I think we have to move on</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to get to the bottom of it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll maybe help eliminate some of the politicizing of science that we&rsquo;ve seen as a result of this thing</p>
<p>But ultimately what&rsquo;s done is done</p>
<p>instead what I think we have to learn from it is you can&rsquo;t elect hotheads and</p>
<p>people who are unpredictable and unreliable to basically be our</p>
<p>Truth tellers and fact tellers and</p>
<p>If anybody but Donald Trump was the president of the United States in that moment</p>
<p>We probably could have had a chance of getting to the bottom of it when it counted and whether you support him or not</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter the style</p>
<p>Made it impossible for anybody to really listen that to me is the most important takeaway of that moment</p>
<p>Which is he does have a responsibility above everybody else&rsquo;s the second thing is I think this is the most important</p>
<p>macro investing theme that I&rsquo;ve seen in my lifetime, which is that globalization as we know it is over and</p>
<p>What saxapoo just said is what I really believe which is that?</p>
<p>You have to onshore and you have to move to a place where you value</p>
<p>Resiliency over just in time and if you look at the businesses that get that need to get built</p>
<p>in order to enable resiliency</p>
<p>you will see</p>
<p>Trillions of dollars of opportunity and I really really believe in that and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s very exciting to me. So instead of great</p>
<p>Yeah, instead of being anti China, which I don&rsquo;t think is productive</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s better to be pro-america and say hey, let&rsquo;s just figure out how to build this stuff ourselves</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the problem though when the rubber meets the road</p>
<p>the biggest impediment to onshoring jobs into the United States are the same people on the left who actually</p>
<p>Claim that there is no upward mobility and here&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>When you go and you want to basically balkanized supply chains</p>
<p>You are introducing inefficiency</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also introducing some puts and takes in areas that today have been like third rail issues. For example</p>
<p>The people on the left believe in climate change more than anybody else</p>
<p>But when you explain to them that in order to eliminate hydrocarbons, you actually have to mine critical minerals and metals out of the ground</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the same people that say no way</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t have one without the other and you actually have to have a rational conversation and realize like listen</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to do this. And so for example, like Biden this past week somewhat capitulated for</p>
<p>Environmental interest and said, you know what? Yes climate change is critical, but we&rsquo;re gonna try to get them from everywhere else</p>
<p>But America it&rsquo;s not gonna work</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of where like I&rsquo;m a little frustrated</p>
<p>But those are my two takeaways. Number one is past</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get past China and let&rsquo;s just focus on the United States and number two is</p>
<p>Globalization as we know it is done and we need to focus on resiliency. Did you guys read the Wall Street Journal piece on?</p>
<p>the miners who in</p>
<p>2012 were the ones who</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re clearing</p>
<p>Essentially bat-dung back. Yeah. Yeah, and so this this is a really fascinating</p>
<p>Turn of events that we&rsquo;re starting to know what this lab was doing. If you didn&rsquo;t see the Wall Street Journal story</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put it in the show notes</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put the show notes but in April 2012 six miners fell sick with a mysterious illness after entering the mine to clear a bat</p>
<p>Guano, I guess is what?</p>
<p>That poop which is supposed to be a primary source of fertilizer worldwide. Yeah, so three of them died</p>
<p>Chinese scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology were called in to investigate</p>
<p>After taking samples from bats in the mine identified several new coronaviruses now unanswered questions about the miners illness the viruses</p>
<p>Found at the site and the research done with them have elevated into the mainstream an idea once dismissed as a conspiracy theory that SARS</p>
<p>Cove to the virus that causes COVID-19 might have leaked from the lab in Wuhan</p>
<p>I mean, this is just becoming more and more obvious</p>
<p>My my gut tells me that our government already knows this has known it for some time the 90-day</p>
<p>Sort of window that they&rsquo;ve given the Chinese to kind of give us an answer as to what happened here is</p>
<p>Window dressing and then we&rsquo;re gonna start the process of becoming more independent from China because there&rsquo;s I mean, it&rsquo;s nothing you could do</p>
<p>I mean, how could we retaliate for an accident? We&rsquo;re not gonna get in a war over this</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s suggesting that but I think we have to open our eyes to</p>
<p>The regime that we&rsquo;re dealing with over in China and just to add a layer to this analysis</p>
<p>Novel Cronus</p>
<p>Coronaviruses are not the only thing coming out of Chinese labs. China is also the number one producer of fentanyl</p>
<p>Yes, and that&rsquo;s another truth that we can finally talk about now that Trump is out of office</p>
<p>People haven&rsquo;t wanted to talk about it or they thought that you were hysterical or promoting a conspiracy theory if you talked about it</p>
<p>But I just posted two articles in the chat one from Brookings and one from NPR</p>
<p>About how China is the main source of fentanyl that&rsquo;s pouring into our streets first</p>
<p>It makes a stopover in Mexico and then somehow it gets smuggled into the u.s. This is a huge problem in our cities and</p>
<p>You know, I think this is not this is not accidental, you know, this is</p>
<p>This is deliberate</p>
<p>Yeah, the Chinese your position is the Chinese government is deliberately sending a super opioid drug into the United States</p>
<p>For profit or to destabilize the country and different cities and create more division between the left and the right</p>
<p>because homelessness and wealth inequality is getting mixed up with a super drug as</p>
<p>Opposed to a homeless problem. This is a little this is getting a little long. I know it&rsquo;s getting crazy</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m reflecting back to sack</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it a conspiracy theory? We know that China is mass-producing the fentanyl that&rsquo;s coming into the u.s</p>
<p>We know that that fentanyl is creating a gigantic crisis of drug addiction and homelessness on the streets</p>
<p>We know they could stop it if they wanted to they have total control over that country. What is the conspiracy theory?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the equivalent of saying America produces all the world&rsquo;s cars. It&rsquo;s not America</p>
<p>There are organizations within the United States that are under the purview</p>
<p>The CCP is hand-picking who gets to run bite dance and ants and they&rsquo;re retiring CEOs</p>
<p>They get to decide what is produced in that country and who produces it. You&rsquo;re telling me that</p>
<p>What do you think is going on in the federal government when they say to their counterparts at the Chinese Communist Party?</p>
<p>Hey, we need you guys to stop producing fentanyl. Do you think that conversations happening?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was this was an agenda item during the Trump administration and talks between</p>
<p>Do you have any sense of what the feedback was from China? I mean, what&rsquo;s the counterpoint?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>But what is the counterpoint that China would then say like why they can&rsquo;t stop it or why this is still happening?</p>
<p>I mean my understanding is there are thousands of kind of you know</p>
<p>Call them under regulated factories and facilities in China any number of which this could be</p>
<p>Question it just does China have a fentanyl addiction problem in their streets</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>And the answer is they round every single person who&rsquo;s a Hong Kong dissident who would sell a book or if anybody goes to the</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair. Tiananmen</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to jail for five years</p>
<p>They just announced Hong Kong citizens who go to the Tiananmen Square</p>
<p>Memorial this year are getting five years and if you tweet about it, you get one year in jail so they can</p>
<p>They can control anything in their country just to build on your control point</p>
<p>I tweeted this to you guys in the group chat</p>
<p>We can post this as well in the show notes</p>
<p>But there was an article in Forbes this week that said friends don&rsquo;t let friends become Chinese billionaires</p>
<p>That was the title and the data point that this is an old story. By the way, it&rsquo;s like eight years old</p>
<p>Just you know, no, no. No, this was written now</p>
<p>That might have been no, I think read the story. I think at the top it says the story is like eight years old</p>
<p>But anyway, it is true that Chinese billionaire Chinese billionaire dies every 40 days</p>
<p>Unnatural deaths have taken the lives of 72 mainland billionaires over the past eight years 15 were murdered</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Wild West over there man</p>
<p>17 committed suicide 7 died from accidents in 19 accidents and 14 were executed suicide accidents</p>
<p>But they execute the 14 for can you imagine 14 billionaires just get executed? Is that story real?</p>
<p>What is that story from tomorrow? I mean, well this this may be is a good segue into coinbase fact-check, but this is</p>
<p>All</p>
<p>Right India versus what&rsquo;s up? Well, I&rsquo;ll give you the rundown on the India thing</p>
<p>So basically, you know there there is a right to you know, free speech effectively in the Indian Constitution</p>
<p>But then India passed the law as effectively. I&rsquo;ll just I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>summarize it as traceability</p>
<p>which basically means that if you have an online network and you post something in the network if an Indian sensor or an Indian regulator or</p>
<p>Authority basically says hey, hold on. This is an issue. They have the right to basically have this the the network or whoever owns that network</p>
<p>Trace it down to its originating source. Now. That&rsquo;s a really important distinction because there are certain products</p>
<p>So for example, take whatsapp where a feature of the product is end-to-end encryption, right?</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s hopping around in ways that are very difficult and near to impossible for anybody to really figure out and</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden that that that element which used to be a feature is</p>
<p>Now a bug because if the Indian government says hey, hold on that statement. I have an issue with I need you to figure out</p>
<p>Who said that?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll essentially have to undo all their end-to-end encryption to figure out. So then whatsapp filed a</p>
<p>court case in New Delhi</p>
<p>This week essentially I think asking for an injunction. And so I think this is going to go to a head</p>
<p>But you have this now</p>
<p>State of affairs, which I think is really interesting, which is so</p>
<p>You know, we we talk about how we have an issue with Chinese censors</p>
<p>Well now here&rsquo;s a different more complicated example because this is the largest democracy in the world and what they were effectively saying is</p>
<p>We need to have an equivalent</p>
<p>red button and a set of levers so that we can figure out what&rsquo;s going on when we choose and</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of implications because inside of India what&rsquo;s different than America as a democracy is it has lower</p>
<p>Average incomes it has lower health. It has lower literacy rates. It has more</p>
<p>religious sort of tension</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got you know</p>
<p>Many many more young people who are more prone theoretically to get you know</p>
<p>bamboozled by</p>
<p>Misinformation and disinformation and so, you know India sees those facts on the ground and probably wrote this law with those intentions in mind</p>
<p>Right and it&rsquo;s had a bunch of these issues by the way</p>
<p>Particularly between Muslims and Hindus and so what do you do, you know, what is Facebook and whatsapp supposed to do?</p>
<p>What is Google supposed to do?</p>
<p>What does it mean for internet rights? I think it&rsquo;s a super super complicated problem. And do you prioritize?</p>
<p>misinformation and disinformation above</p>
<p>The right for people&rsquo;s privacy and you&rsquo;re gonna see it unfold in the largest democracy in the world over the next couple months</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know how I feel about it to be honest</p>
<p>Except I do think that Indian government has a right to set the rules of their own country</p>
<p>Well and set the rules they are I mean remember they also banned tik-tok in an instance and hundreds of other apps</p>
<p>I think 60 apps from China have been banned permanently in</p>
<p>India so India obviously has a different approach to China, which is we&rsquo;re gonna put our foot down now</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re involved in some skirmishes on their border. But yeah, it does seem sacks. What do you what&rsquo;s your thought you have?</p>
<p>Personal right to privacy end-to-end encryption and then you have you know, the ability to run backdoor a backdoor to it</p>
<p>Yeah, this is another</p>
<p>major</p>
<p>Sledgehammer to globalization, you know in the in the mid to late 90s</p>
<p>We had this beautiful dream that we&rsquo;re gonna create a single Internet for the whole world</p>
<p>it would create a single common market a single place for people to interact and go and that all of these</p>
<p>Barriers these geographic barriers tribal barriers would come down over time</p>
<p>And now what we see is the trade barriers have come up and now instead of having one Internet for the whole world</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fragmenting into a bunch of different Internets governed by local laws</p>
<p>You know, it started with the the great firewall of China creating sort of a separate Chinese Internet</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re starting to see country-by-country regulations and I just think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s sort of an inevitable reaction that</p>
<p>the power of governments and sovereignties comes before the power of corporations and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>reimposing their will and I think the question for all these companies is going to be where they decide they&rsquo;re willing to play and</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>now I do think it&rsquo;s a very different choice whether you want to play in India or whether you want to play in China because</p>
<p>In China when the government tells you to hand over information on dissidents you really are</p>
<p>Aiding and abetting what could be political oppression whereas India being a democracy</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the choice is quite the same at all</p>
<p>and so, you know</p>
<p>I do think these tech companies are gonna have to decide which countries they want to sort of play ball with and</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think they probably have to make a determination</p>
<p>Based on working with the Democratic ones and they&rsquo;re probably gonna have to exit the ones that engage in political repression in my first of all</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really well said what you said in my in my annual letter last year</p>
<p>I kind of wrote like here&rsquo;s the white paper on how to dismantle big tech and there were two frames one was around</p>
<p>Taxation which we&rsquo;re also seeing but the second was on this regulator regulatory point David that you&rsquo;re bringing up</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the simplest way to sort of break these companies down</p>
<p>Which is if you have to engineer now instead of one monolithic codebase</p>
<p>Multiple instantiations where you can&rsquo;t even get the leverage of like, you know cross-border data centers</p>
<p>I mean, by the way, there there&rsquo;s a really interesting thing that the Biden tax bill also proposes on this dimension, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna prevent you from sending IP, you know into places like</p>
<p>Like Ireland and keeping it there, right? So you can&rsquo;t have all of a sudden, you know code</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s running in Ireland that executes something that makes money so that you can pay Irish tax versus something code that runs in America</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s largely, you know user oriented that&rsquo;s not gonna happen. That&rsquo;s not gonna be allowed anymore, right?</p>
<p>So all of these things are happening at the same time essentially to reign</p>
<p>Big tech in making it almost a whack-a-mole problem inside these companies where you&rsquo;re fighting a tax thing</p>
<p>For example, Google&rsquo;s fighting antitrust in France</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re fighting antitrust at the EU level then you&rsquo;re fighting, you know traceability and encryption in India</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re fighting, you know inversion of an IP in America</p>
<p>Wow, like it&rsquo;s like all of a sudden the lawyers inside of these companies will outnumber the engineers</p>
<p>And I think a lot of this is the downstream</p>
<p>Consequences of what happened back in January when Twitter and all the other big tech companies deplatformed Trump</p>
<p>Remember at the time it wasn&rsquo;t just you know conservatives or in the US who raised alarm bells. It was Angela Merkel in in</p>
<p>Germany it was the finance minister in France. I think India, you know</p>
<p>Talked about it. I think Modi had a statement about it</p>
<p>They all woke up and said whoa a head of state can be deep platformed by Jack Dorsey</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s more powerful than the president of United States and countries all around the world started looking at the power of big tech and realize</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re subordinate to all these tech billionaires and oligarchs. Tell me about coinbase and fact-check. I think this thing is incredible</p>
<p>I mean I have to say by the way the first thing I&rsquo;ll say about and this is this is the exact opposite of what I</p>
<p>Said the last time Brian Armstrong wrote a memo</p>
<p>This memo is excellent. And if you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to read it, we&rsquo;ll put it in the show notes</p>
<p>But Brian&rsquo;s essay is super I think there have been a couple of CEO memos in the last two months that I think</p>
<p>Honestly should be in the Hall of Fame in the Smithsonian</p>
<p>One is the Toby Lutke memo</p>
<p>that the internal email he wrote and the second one is this one that Brian wrote because I think this this thing is probably one</p>
<p>Of the most important things in my opinion that has been written</p>
<p>By a CEO which has the potential to lead to huge systemic changes</p>
<p>Well, he echoed he echoed a lot of the things we&rsquo;ve been saying on this pod about going direct</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let the press tell your story go direct get you get the truth out</p>
<p>there basically what the what the blog said is they&rsquo;re gonna start using the coinbase blog as a forum basically as a</p>
<p>Media publication for for crypto related things and the fact-check part is that when the popular press?</p>
<p>Gets crypto wrong, which they do frequently in coinbase&rsquo;s view. Coinbase is gonna call them out and correct them</p>
<p>Basically, here&rsquo;s what he says the increased awareness has been great</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we also see misinformation published frequently as well whether in traditional media social media or by public figures</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t always come from negative intentions</p>
<p>our business and crypto can be difficult to understand and often people are rushed to post first impressions online making mistakes in the process at</p>
<p>Other times misinformation comes from people publishing their own agenda or from people who have a conflict of interest</p>
<p>This is not unique to our business or industry, of course</p>
<p>So, how should companies respond one turn the other cheek to fight and three publish the truth</p>
<p>I believe there is a reasonable middle ground between these first two options</p>
<p>turning the other cheek and fighting which is to simply publish the truth in a</p>
<p>Way you fight back is you publish the truth. So that to me that&rsquo;s not a choice</p>
<p>Those are the same thing is you can either remain silent</p>
<p>Take the high road which always results in people believing whatever, you know</p>
<p>Lies are being said or you fight back by telling the truth fact-check approach is not about antagonizing or embarrassing others</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Brian Armstrong, but simply sharing what happened through our own channels</p>
<p>It also means sharing the good along with the bad with radical transparency</p>
<p>I I just want to say that I wish him all the success in the world because I think if if if and as this</p>
<p>Works with that which I think it will because</p>
<p>People in the crypto universe are more prone to actually get their own information and do their own diligence</p>
<p>I think the spillover effects to other companies can be really positive. All of this is going to the same place, which is</p>
<p>The intermediate layer of traditional media is basically getting whittled down, right?</p>
<p>There was a there was a different thing that happened in this last few weeks, which was</p>
<p>The Tribune company I think it was</p>
<p>Basically got taken private by some hedge fund and in it</p>
<p>they talked about what has happened in the industry and</p>
<p>the most incredible thing was the amount of revenue that has disappeared from newspapers and</p>
<p>Literally from the tens of billions of dollars to basically single-digit billions today over the last 20 years</p>
<p>which effectively means traditional media&rsquo;s revenue source is going away and</p>
<p>If then all of a sudden if you take that media</p>
<p>Model away and there are no more economic incentives</p>
<p>Then it stands to reason that the overarching incentives that remain are around reputation</p>
<p>Which is then about facts and so the fact that Coinbase will have a place that says here are the facts and we&rsquo;re gonna put</p>
<p>It on chain permanently on the record. That&rsquo;s I think a really powerful idea Andreessen Horowitz, by the way same situation</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing it in venture capital, you know, one of the largest and most prolific and important</p>
<p>sources of</p>
<p>Funding the future. They&rsquo;re on the record on chain in their own way, right with their own media</p>
<p>And and they&rsquo;re now helping to tell the stories of other folks through it David Sachs, you know, Sachs has put so much content</p>
<p>In terms of teaching people about the business that he knows really well</p>
<p>But at the same time he&rsquo;s also been able to write about what he thinks about certain things and then eventually on behalf of his companies</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll be able to say things and do things as well. So all of a sudden not all of a sudden</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ve seen it. But if we had to put a label on this</p>
<p>This is the dismantling of traditional media. It is happening in real time and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accelerating</p>
<p>It turns out, you know as a subject being</p>
<p>Interpreted as you&rsquo;re being through the New Yorker right now in your story Chamath and I am through my business insider profile</p>
<p>You know all these profiles that they do</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re interpreting your life when people could just tune into the podcast and hear us talk about it, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like you can go direct to the source and listen to 34 episodes of all-in or you could read</p>
<p>Some interpretation from somebody trying to get page views. Well, here&rsquo;s my here&rsquo;s my observation. The thing is that people who create</p>
<p>Artifacts on a real-time basis. So in many ways we have all collectively now started to create a weekly artifact of who we are as people</p>
<p>It leaves very little left over for interpretation</p>
<p>And so then unfortunately what happens is journalists trying to write content have to introduce some form of flourish to stand out</p>
<p>Yeah, because if you&rsquo;re just repeating something that was said on the podcast or something that we said in a tweet</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing left to talk about it&rsquo;s kind of already been said and so that&rsquo;s what creates boundary conditions for lying</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what creates boundary conditions for mistruths and we&rsquo;ve seen a handful of reporters back in the day fall</p>
<p>You know fall into that trap. We you know, there was a couple writers in the New York Times that got pinched for lying</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be harder and harder to lie</p>
<p>So in many in some ways</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually pretty optimistic that that reputation management and truth will be easier to do in the future when this intermediary layer doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;ll take many other companies to do what Coinbase is doing and recent us in this podcast</p>
<p>Us with our tweets and our memos and our posts. I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all in the good positive direction</p>
<p>Yeah, and and and and Armstrong in his in this blog talks about the gel man amnesia effect</p>
<p>Which we&rsquo;ve talked about on this pod before which is I saw that. Yeah. Yeah, which is great. I love that</p>
<p>Because you know that the gel man amnesia is you read the newspaper about a topic?</p>
<p>You know something about you see that 50% of it is just wrong</p>
<p>Then you turn the page to some other part of the newspaper say, you know world affairs</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know as much about and you just assume it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and we all know that the media is maybe 50% right about everything and so</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so this is why we have to hear from experts directly. I think it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a decentralization of media</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why I think this like heavy-handed</p>
<p>centralized censorship by big tech is so</p>
<p>Offensive and anachronistic is to try and control what everyone can say</p>
<p>Especially when it later turns out that you know, big media gets so many things wrong like the lab leak theory</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s this is definitely the way things are headed</p>
<p>I would like to invest some money to basically free Berg a platform to explain science. Well, that&rsquo;s right here free Berg</p>
<p>tell us about the science of</p>
<p>NBA games and large gatherings in the age of</p>
<p>Vaccination. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you got COVID this week Jake out. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I definitely lost my voice at the Knicks games</p>
<p>But I have to say this was pretty stunning</p>
<p>To go to a Knicks game have everybody in the arena show their VACs card to get in. I suppose somebody could</p>
<p>Photocopy one or steal one, you know</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot of work and I don&rsquo;t know what that if there&rsquo;s any penalty for doing something like that</p>
<p>But what when you see a full arena Madison Square Garden everybody vaccinated free Berg</p>
<p>Do does it give you any pause as a scientist that this is not a good idea or this is too soon</p>
<p>Or do you think heck? Yes, this is what we should be doing proper risk assessment. Finally</p>
<p>No, we should do what we want to do</p>
<p>Do what you want to do</p>
<p>Way to keep the free bird ratio high that was supposed to be the science segway we&rsquo;re ready for a monologue</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go free bird. Come on. Let&rsquo;s go free brag. We&rsquo;re poking the tiger here Friedberg</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you tell this is something I thought was incredible am Jen</p>
<p>This week at the end of this week got approval for this really incredible drug that basically targets k-razz mutations</p>
<p>In lung cancer, which has been this body of cancer that has basically been somewhat intractable for a really long time</p>
<p>And these guys have cracked the code. It looks like and now the drug is 18,000 a month, I think but</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s for insurance to take care of but pretty incredible breakthrough that people are talking a lot about</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you if you were tracking it. No, but I</p>
<p>Think that there were several other gene therapies. There were several</p>
<p>Drugs that got approval in the last like month</p>
<p>one of which is this or actually was about two months ago this drug that</p>
<p>It uses targeted car key therapy</p>
<p>Basically, you know, we all have t-cells and</p>
<p>We can edit our own t-cells now using this car key therapy</p>
<p>This is a series of techniques where you basically</p>
<p>Reprogram your t-cells genetically to go after a specific target in your body</p>
<p>And so there are now a whole series of car key therapies that are coming to market that are actually in market</p>
<p>You can go down and go get treatment</p>
<p>Today for several these car key therapies that you know, not too long ago. We&rsquo;re really difficult to kind of understand</p>
<p>You know being real</p>
<p>They take your t-cells out of your blood, you know</p>
<p>So you go and you get your blood drawn a couple weeks later you come back to the doctor</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve taken the t-cells out of your blood. They re-engineer them the way they re-engineer is really interesting</p>
<p>They basically</p>
<p>Use this technique where they zap them with electricity and it gets this gene editing in there and then they get edited and then they put</p>
<p>Those t-cells back into your in your body</p>
<p>It takes about an hour to get them re-injected back into your body and then they do their job and they in many cases are</p>
<p>Being used to target cancer cells. It&rsquo;s very specific receptors</p>
<p>So now the t-cell has been programmed to go find that cancer cell receptor</p>
<p>They hit the cancer cell receptor bind to it and then eliminate that cancer cell. So essentially in</p>
<p>Plain English you&rsquo;re putting this super t-cell back on the body</p>
<p>It goes through the blood and then it finds something foreign that shouldn&rsquo;t be there like a virus or cancer find anything</p>
<p>You want bacteria, whatever you want it to find and it snipes it but yeah what it does</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s looking for a specific protein and that protein for example can be expressed only on the surface of specific cancer cells</p>
<p>So if you found certain cancer cells that you have a cancer and we know that there&rsquo;s a specific</p>
<p>Protein that shows up on the surface of that cancer which is common in many cancers because they all follow very similar kind of</p>
<p>You know mutations you can end up</p>
<p>Targeting that cancer cell and only that cancer cell and your your t-cells go to work and they go and wipe it out</p>
<p>I think the breakthrough this week was in multiple myeloma and thyroid cancer</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a multiple myeloma one, which was a bluebird bioproduct. Yeah, and then I think it got picked up by</p>
<p>Bristol</p>
<p>Or someone else picked it up. So they basically paid the fee and they run their own good manufacturing practice</p>
<p>Facility where your blood is shipped to them</p>
<p>They do all the gene editing with your own t-cells in this facility and they ship it back to your doctor and it gets re-injected</p>
<p>Back into you. There are</p>
<p>600 car t-cell</p>
<p>Is that what&rsquo;s called car space t-cell?</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>So car stands for chimeric antigen receptor and that is the little call think about it as like a seeker</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s on the outside of your t-cell it goes and it finds a specific thing</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to bind to and so you&rsquo;re reprogramming your t-cell to have a specific</p>
<p>Receptor and then as soon as it finds that that as soon as that receptor binds to the correct protein that it&rsquo;s looking for</p>
<p>Boom that that cell that it binds to gets wiped out</p>
<p>are we gonna talk about the crazy media mergers and spin-outs that are happening because</p>
<p>It seems like just in the last 90 days the entire industry is rewiring itself</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of a pretty significant set of transactions that are underway</p>
<p>Amazon is buying MGM which owns most importantly James Bond James Bond has done 20 billion dollars in</p>
<p>Adjusted revenue for their movies and you can obviously see many different backstories and television shows around the James Bond</p>
<p>So this is kind of in my mind of that eight or nine billion</p>
<p>They spent six billions on the franchise for James Bond so that Bezos can play James Bond obviously while he returns</p>
<p>If you take a zoom out, you know</p>
<p>Several years ago. You guys may remember, you know early 2000s into the mid, you know</p>
<p>All the telco started freaking out</p>
<p>Because they were sorry all the media companies were freaking out</p>
<p>Because their controlled points of distribution which were network television and then their cable television stations and the movie theaters</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting disintermediated by the internet</p>
<p>So all these internet companies showed up like YouTube and Netflix and we&rsquo;re going direct to consumer where consumers were not getting access to content</p>
<p>Directly without the control channels that the media companies controlled at the same time</p>
<p>The telcos were freaking out because it turns out people didn&rsquo;t need cell phones anymore or need phone lines anymore</p>
<p>What they needed was internet access and internet access was quickly commoditizing</p>
<p>So the telcos were like holy crap being in the business of providing internet service not a great business</p>
<p>We need to be making more value per user per year than we&rsquo;re gonna be able to make charging them for internet access</p>
<p>So the telco started buying up media companies</p>
<p>This is what Verizon and others did and the media companies and AT&amp;T and the media cut</p>
<p>So remember Verizon bought AOL and Yahoo</p>
<p>AT&amp;T bought Time Warner and then the media companies the old-school media companies that were kind of like still</p>
<p>Decided not to sell and to stay on their own</p>
<p>They decided well, we got to go internet</p>
<p>so we got to figure out how to be on the internet and compete in this world where companies like Netflix and Amazon are</p>
<p>going direct to consumers and</p>
<p>You know, they all started building their own internet services</p>
<p>And so now you got Paramount Plus, HBO Max, Hulu</p>
<p>And that you know, Hulu was a big one and meanwhile the tech companies that went direct to consumers</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re realizing you know, what if these media companies aren&rsquo;t gonna play ball. We better get our own media</p>
<p>We got to get old content. And so then they started licensing, buying, funding and building their own media companies</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a total reorientation that&rsquo;s underway. Now what&rsquo;s interesting in the last couple weeks is Verizon decided</p>
<p>You know what? We can&rsquo;t be in the media business</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not very good at it and they spun it out and they&rsquo;re selling AOL, Yahoo</p>
<p>And then meanwhile this really interesting deal is AT&amp;T gave up on owning Time Warner</p>
<p>And so it turns out that the telcos who thought that they could own the media and monetize it</p>
<p>You know what? It&rsquo;s just a pain in the butt. It&rsquo;s another business</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t really figure out how to add value to our subscriber base with these products. They&rsquo;re gonna have to exist on their own</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how to run them because we&rsquo;re not media guys, and they&rsquo;re spinning out</p>
<p>So now the telcos, the interesting question to ask is what are they gonna do next?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next move for them because they got to keep growing</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the tech companies and the media companies are just like this</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s 50 subscription services each with their own silo and vulcanization of content</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all gonna have to choose as consumers</p>
<p>Do I want HBO Max or Paramount Plus or you know</p>
<p>The the bundle I get from Comcast and it&rsquo;s gonna be a nasty battle for the next 10 years</p>
<p>Where you and where you want content you&rsquo;re gonna have to go pick and choose who do you want to buy content from?</p>
<p>And so yeah, I have a theory</p>
<p>I think consolidation happens when markets don&rsquo;t matter anymore and are getting commoditized and</p>
<p>What I would say about all of this what it shows me is that we&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>transferring to the phase of the market where it&rsquo;s all about cost of capital and</p>
<p>right now the only person that actually understood that was Netflix and</p>
<p>Netflix issued billions of dollars of debt and they&rsquo;ve started to finance every piece of content under the Sun and</p>
<p>being small and trying to compete against Netflix was not possible and</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re in that part of the market where content is actually not that important because there is an enormous diversity of it</p>
<p>So no one single person can really corner that market</p>
<p>And so then it becomes how much can you make and how cheaply can you make it and their scale matters?</p>
<p>So I can think like what this shows me back to sort of what we talked about before on the other part about like</p>
<p>Facts and truth is this is part of a much broader, you know media puzzle that&rsquo;s becoming more obvious, which is</p>
<p>traditional outlets that push top-down content is kind of yesterday&rsquo;s news and</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s being replaced by is more and better forms of user-generated content and</p>
<p>Highly commoditized</p>
<p>Unprofessional content and in all of that the economics are going away. So I don&rsquo;t if you if you if you are not sure</p>
<p>Go and look inside of tick-tock the content that individual people create inside of tick-tock is</p>
<p>unbelievably good and</p>
<p>They are training an entire generation of kids</p>
<p>to consume content</p>
<p>15 seconds 30 seconds at a time</p>
<p>Which has huge implications by the way for how they consume music</p>
<p>So for example, if you guys like look inside a tick-tock and then go to YouTube and look at the most popular videos the same</p>
<p>And same thing with Spotify. It&rsquo;s 15 second clips now</p>
<p>No, you know these kids want to listen to the hook of a song and then they won&rsquo;t listen to it</p>
<p>I see how my kids use it and it&rsquo;s crazy because like they get addicted to a hook on tick-tock</p>
<p>They try to go to YouTube to learn the lyrics</p>
<p>They only want to learn the lyrics for the part that&rsquo;s in the tick-tock bus it and then they move on a challenge</p>
<p>Yes, whatever it is</p>
<p>And so the the point of all of that is that content costs are going to continue to go down</p>
<p>Which means the economics are going to go down the margins are not that good</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s all just a commodity that almost doesn&rsquo;t matter. I don&rsquo;t know about that</p>
<p>I think for the top-tier IP like you can&rsquo;t displace a Disney</p>
<p>And they are growing portfolio of IP and those things are high margin and you know having 250</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know having 250 to 500,000 500 million people paying you monthly has never existed in the history of humanity</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never been a at-scale service like this before the closest was Verizon AT&amp;T when they hit 100 million</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not disputing that people won&rsquo;t pay</p>
<p>999 what I&rsquo;m disputing is</p>
<p>The denominator of what they&rsquo;re paying for is increasing so fast that no one piece of content matters Jason</p>
<p>No, the idea we agree with that collections matter, right? So the IP of Marvel Disney</p>
<p>Pixar put together</p>
<p>Right like pick Disney launched this thing with no direct-to-consumer relationships with when they launched Disney Plus</p>
<p>What do they have now 60 million subscribers or something to a hundred now hundred million subscribers, which is incredible</p>
<p>You guys have kids my kids watch this stuff on you</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have it for the rest of our lives over and over they&rsquo;ll put on friggin Moana</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve watched the seashore scene of Moana. They want to watch the beginning</p>
<p>They want to watch the middle part</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like infinitely reusable content and so Disney&rsquo;s content library is so powerful for that particular demographic</p>
<p>Basically the demographic of anyone with children that it&rsquo;s an instant on kind of moment</p>
<p>These other guys like Paramount Plus and you know, HBO&rsquo;s obviously got some special content</p>
<p>But it shows how much content matters, right?</p>
<p>The quality of the content for the demographic is so key for this to work all these media companies that have kind of a broad</p>
<p>Dithered, you know library of half quality half good kind of content</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna struggle man, because they&rsquo;re not gonna feel like they&rsquo;re ringing a little too much out of it with this too much content production</p>
<p>There is like 50 shows about superheroes. Then there&rsquo;s like 50 shows that are like, you know</p>
<p>Met a commentary on the superhero show. It&rsquo;s almost becoming exhausting like how many homeland style shows are there gonna be?</p>
<p>How many Soprano style shows are gonna be Game of Thrones? I&rsquo;m getting burnt. I think I like your I think you&rsquo;re making my point</p>
<p>Which is that no one piece of content matters anymore. It&rsquo;s all yeah</p>
<p>So my big takeaway from Bezos buying MGM and these other, you know, M&amp;A events is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less about the decline of content, even though there are more and more options there ever have been and therefore more competition</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more about the rising power and wealth and influence of big tech</p>
<p>I mean if you look at throughout history</p>
<p>Whoever is buying studios in any given era</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the people with the money and power and they&rsquo;re seeking influence. It was</p>
<p>NBC it was Gulf and Western buying Paramount in the 1970s an oil and gas company or</p>
<p>What happens in the picture so that&rsquo;s right Sony Sony</p>
<p>Columbia in the 1980s when you had the era of the Rising Sun</p>
<p>So whoever has the money and the power and seeking influence are the ones buying studios</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Bezos is doing right now</p>
<p>but I think this time it is a little bit different in this sense that we&rsquo;re reaching an end state of digital convergence where the</p>
<p>Where content and the digital distribution are now reaching their kind of final state</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t expect these studios once they&rsquo;re owned by big tech to ever go anywhere</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re gonna be trading again every 10 years. I think this is the end state</p>
<p>Amazon wants this library for their streaming service</p>
<p>And I think that big tech is gonna gobble up the rest of these libraries and that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re gonna stay</p>
<p>Do you think all media will end up in tech? Yeah, I mean, I think I think I think big tech is gonna eat Hollywood</p>
<p>Look, we&rsquo;ve been on this this path of convergence now since the mid 90s with the Internet and the question was always</p>
<p>you know, we knew that tech and Hollywood were converging and and</p>
<p>Joining just more and more and the question would be on whose terms</p>
<p>This final merger would take place and I think that big tech now you just look at the market caps</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much bigger than the market caps of these studios that eight billion surrounding era</p>
<p>Running air for Bezos. I mean, it&rsquo;s one days. It&rsquo;s one day&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Revenue or whatever less so obviously big tech is gonna win this battle. They are gonna own Hollywood</p>
<p>except for the few guys that have</p>
<p>Scale to actually be successful like Disney, right Disney maybe HBO to some extent</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see how I mean look Zaslav who runs this guy. He&rsquo;s an incredible media guy</p>
<p>And he gets it</p>
<p>but they could be like this discovery plus slash HBO plus whatever that combined business ends up looking like</p>
<p>That could be a competitor and their babies like there&rsquo;s two to three libraries</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re deep enough and strong enough to compete and stand on their own as a tech kind of platform</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s also really interesting is that all the telcos are exiting and what are they gonna become right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear. What&rsquo;s interesting is they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re not tech companies</p>
<p>Are important, right?</p>
<p>So so here&rsquo;s the thing with the telcos that the telecom stack is we know that tech is taking over Hollywood</p>
<p>But the question is what part of the tech stack and what&rsquo;s happened is the part of the tech stack that has the direct</p>
<p>relationship with the audience</p>
<p>Apple Google Amazon who aggregate millions and millions of consumers</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who should actually own the content because they are the ones delivering up</p>
<p>The content to the consumer and everybody else who&rsquo;s lower down in the stack who are just the pipes</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really have a claim on these libraries in this content</p>
<p>The pipes are the pipes are valuable, but they&rsquo;re a commodity what Elon is doing with Starlink is gonna disrupt them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re not valuable, but they&rsquo;re not in a highly leveraged position to do anything with the content</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna keep increasing speed in order to keep you paying 30</p>
<p>They realize you know what we cannot we can&rsquo;t run media businesses and we can&rsquo;t monetize it</p>
<p>Well, what are they gonna do focus on faster bandwidth get us to gigabit. I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>I mean like you guys are like you guys are so fucking old like you&rsquo;re just like talking about yesterday&rsquo;s news. Nobody cares</p>
<p>This is what I mean</p>
<p>Consolidation in markets like this should tell you it&rsquo;s time to move on and focus on something else</p>
<p>This is a dead industry with no profit</p>
<p>So Chamath what happens to AT&amp;T and what happens to Verizon over the next 10 years? It doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>Well, I agree. I agree with that part that it doesn&rsquo;t matter what happens to these telcos. They should be dumb pipes again</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not in a leveraged position to create value around content</p>
<p>They never should have owned it</p>
<p>But I do think there is major major significance in Amazon and Apple and Google and these other big tech companies owning</p>
<p>Hollywood because they have they&rsquo;re gonna combine the influence</p>
<p>They already have with the influence of Hollywood and you already have again censorship on these tech platforms</p>
<p>Are they gonna start censoring the type of content the Hollywood produces?</p>
<p>I think these issues are gonna get more and more important over time because so much control</p>
<p>Over our politics and society and culture are being concentrated in the hands of frankly our industry</p>
<p>But this is what I think about the other the other side of that coin is what we talked about before with respect to things</p>
<p>Like Coinbase while that&rsquo;s happening more and more people who have their own distribution are going direct</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just separate entertainment and facts</p>
<p>From a fact perspective. I think we&rsquo;re seeing everything sort of become highly decentralized and I think that that&rsquo;s constructive now</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be services that will be there to help us navigate</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening with respect to entertainment</p>
<p>I just think like it was our generation was the last one that actually even cared about movies</p>
<p>That cared about these tent novelizations that that cared about water cooler type conversations on a Monday morning books novels</p>
<p>Kids will not understand what the hell we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, what do you mean you used to run into work on a Monday?</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s only couldn&rsquo;t care less really they play</p>
<p>They love video games. Yeah, I mean by the way, they&rsquo;re obviously like that, you know, the combination of media tech and</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just be kind of ultimate manifestation of where it&rsquo;s all and it&rsquo;s not just our kids</p>
<p>Just look at the monthly active usage numbers that roblox and epic</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nuts</p>
<p>And so they are voting every day with their attention and at the end of the day the thing that has never been</p>
<p>Improved is the nut or increases the number of hours in a day such a mock your</p>
<p>Telcos, you know as an investor, I own a bunch of Verizon and AT&amp;T stock if you were running that company</p>
<p>What would you do? I would quit</p>
<p>You might run it for capital and then buy assets. Oh wait, they did that</p>
<p>These businesses have had horrendous capital allocation for decades</p>
<p>And the reason that they were allowed was that they were they were part of a culture of insiders</p>
<p>There were other in where other insiders said that they were important</p>
<p>But as it turned out to individual users who are making usage decisions every day</p>
<p>They were not important at all. And this is what we&rsquo;re learning that the Emperor has no clothes</p>
<p>So while everybody was, you know looking around themselves saying AT&amp;T is important and hey, you know</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go and like, you know buy all of these crazy old-school media assets</p>
<p>Young people were like I use snapchat and tik-tok and YouTube and I&rsquo;m done. Thanks. Goodbye. Talk right and who owns those platforms?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re right that professional content is being crowded out to some degree by amateur content</p>
<p>But now the big tech companies own the professional content or the studios for creating them and they own the user-generated</p>
<p>Platforms that lets the amateurs create the content so big tech now owns everything</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re seeing the next shooter drop because the thing that I think content creators haven&rsquo;t yet realized and</p>
<p>Social media personalities and influencers haven&rsquo;t yet realized is how can I own my own distribution and</p>
<p>Monetize my relationship that feature of the web</p>
<p>Will get figured out in our lifetime and that&rsquo;s what starting to a patreon and then Apple is now</p>
<p>Spotify is doing pay content these people doing stripe accounts direct with their fans. Those people are too old</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna figure it out. What I&rsquo;m saying is there are going to be people who are teenagers today</p>
<p>Right or kids who will be teenagers in a decade 20 somethings?</p>
<p>Who will figure this out for whom the idea that if you&rsquo;re a Charlie D&rsquo;Amelio, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re tick tocks top biggest star with a hundred and twenty odd million followers</p>
<p>That to go through an intermediary to talk to your people will not in the future make any sense and I think David that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Where the the next thing will change. I just think it&rsquo;s unreliable to expect</p>
<p>Laserbeam, mr. Beast Charlie D&rsquo;Amelio all these people</p>
<p>To go through the no because they have they have such</p>
<p>They could go direct to some of those guys could go direct now that they&rsquo;re huge</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s no different than building a name on the New York Times and then starting your own sub stack</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to happen. Yeah, but you can&rsquo;t go viral and you can&rsquo;t get discovered unless you participate</p>
<p>Not an or you can use the platform and you can have a new relationship build scale</p>
<p>You will build scale on a platform and then you&rsquo;ll go on your own because you&rsquo;ll want to control and monetize your own relationship</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it is what these folks have done meaning like how Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian had built incredible scale and wealth</p>
<p>Yeah is effectively through that they build scale through Instagram and Twitter and wherever TV show</p>
<p>Now the only thing that they haven&rsquo;t done is they&rsquo;ve monetized it through offline goods</p>
<p>But if somebody figures out how to monetize it through an online relationship</p>
<p>Then what you&rsquo;re really doing is you&rsquo;re learning how to build scale in an established platform and then you on ramp to something else</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also online and you go from there to think that it won&rsquo;t get figured out. I think is being nice</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being figured out. It&rsquo;s being figured out right now. The street is figuring out</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called ghost which is like an open-source version of</p>
<p>Substack it is an open-source version of substack and people are building direct relationships and doing their own</p>
<p>Patreon and if you leave substack you get to take your stripe account with you you use your stripe account</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s portable you can go on substack for a year leave and keep all your subscribers</p>
<p>I think this solution will get figured out</p>
<p>Through the crypto community and the reason is because that is by definition to your point Jason</p>
<p>Fundamentally distributed and tied to a payment and a store of value because that&rsquo;s what effectively this is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like where is the value of somebody&rsquo;s reputation and right now?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a way of measuring it and you can you can put that on chain in some way</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim to know how but I mean people have talked about this is all these different</p>
<p>I hope I hope that happens</p>
<p>I hope that crypto figures out a way to to create decentralized social networks and all the rest of it</p>
<p>Yet and the only way that mr</p>
<p>Beast or Charlie D&rsquo;Amelio or any of these people became stars is they went viral on</p>
<p>YouTube or tick-tock or insta they on up on a big tech platform</p>
<p>And so right now the strategy is gonna be doing both you use the big</p>
<p>Power, they have all the power right now because if they deny you access to one of these platform</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re talking about cares about Trump</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about Trump</p>
<p>Trump in their life, but you okay</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one on the on the brain. What are you talking about? We love that. He&rsquo;s bad. You love he&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>What do you want missing? No, I&rsquo;m not missing it at all</p>
<p>But you want him back or not?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to do takeaways on these moves by big tech to buy Hollywood Studios and I&rsquo;m telling you it&rsquo;s about who has I</p>
<p>Power money and influence and it&rsquo;s all good. I&rsquo;ll go out on a limb and say</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re it we&rsquo;re in the sort of the the August of their</p>
<p>Supremacy, so and again, I would just say David if on the one hand</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whack-a-mole problem with governments on taxation and regulation</p>
<p>And on the other hand you have a way where you can have distributed social currency and value</p>
<p>Wow, I mean these big tech companies are getting bombarded on every single side</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s just a hard place to be one last thing for you guys on a market check</p>
<p>My 10-year break evens remember</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now down to 242. It&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>18 days. What is he talking about?</p>
<p>My little inflation check my little inflation check and seems like things are trending in the right direction</p>
<p>Hmm, the market is back. The market&rsquo;s back a little there may not be inflation</p>
<p>Well, I think what happened Chamath is you you put it?</p>
<p>Well, I think a couple of pods ago the market sent a signal to Biden that look this is too much</p>
<p>Taxing too much spending. It&rsquo;s too inflationary</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if Biden heard the message but several Democratic senators did breaks and they pumped put on the brakes</p>
<p>They reduce the size of the package. They&rsquo;re now talking about maybe the capital gains rate going to 25</p>
<p>The infrastructure bill is you know been chopped in half. So I think there&rsquo;s less inflationary pressure</p>
<p>Coming out of Washington, hopefully</p>
<p>Yeah, what I what I heard last week. I spoke to some folks in Washington. What they said was exactly what you said, David</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna at best. They&rsquo;re gonna get the cap gains</p>
<p>Sorry, no movement on cap gains. They don&rsquo;t think it can happen at all. So that&rsquo;s not gonna move</p>
<p>Okay, number one number two is that corporate will go to 25 but not to 28 and then number three</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna really tighten the IP loophole</p>
<p>Which will prevent American companies from shipping IP to places like Ireland to not pay tax</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna make it impossible to do things like inversions all this kind of stuff and then scope that down</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually to your point a very very good</p>
<p>outcome for the markets</p>
<p>So this was actually productive if this happens if the infrastructure bill gets I think the Republicans now</p>
<p>They first McConnell said 600 to 800 billion. Now, I think they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re at 900 billion</p>
<p>I think the Democrats started at 2.3 billion now. I think they&rsquo;re at 1.7</p>
<p>So hopefully it&rsquo;s being brought down to a more reasonable number. That&rsquo;s not gonna bust the the budget</p>
<p>1.2 1.3 and everybody will have something but here&rsquo;s the crazy thing</p>
<p>I mean the US government debt is now at a hundred percent of GDP. We owe our entire economy</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty crazy. And there&rsquo;s still other countries that are 1.5 right and double like Japan and others</p>
<p>Biden Biden six trillion dollar budget would increase our budget</p>
<p>Debt our debt from a hundred percent of GDP to 117 percent if he gets his way too much</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a World War two level of spending but what is the benefit equivalent to World War two that we&rsquo;re getting out of this thing?</p>
<p>Well, also, we&rsquo;re have a surplus in so many states that we&rsquo;re doing lotteries. Thank you Queen of quinoa Rain Man and the dictator</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m JC Calacanis. We&rsquo;ll see you next time on the all-in podcast. Bye. Bye</p>
<p>Just got crazy</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big you Georgie because they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release them</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B</p>
