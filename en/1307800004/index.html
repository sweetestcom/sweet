    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to look at how a fairy tale collector helped to resurrect</p>
<p>a dead language, specifically the Indo-European language.</p>
<p>In the last couple of episodes, we&rsquo;ve looked at William Jones&rsquo; discovery that almost</p>
<p>all the languages of Europe, as well as several languages of Central Asia, were all descended</p>
<p>from an ancient common ancestor.</p>
<p>And in the last episode, we looked at the various languages that descended from that</p>
<p>ancestral language, and which are part of the Indo-European family tree.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that even though early linguists concluded that all of those languages had</p>
<p>evolved from an ancient ancestor, they actually knew very little about that original language.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t really know what it sounded like, where it was spoken, or when it was</p>
<p>spoken.</p>
<p>There were some early guesses, but that was about it.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to look at how early linguists actually began to reconstruct</p>
<p>large portions of that original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And this is actually a fascinating story as it relates to English, because much of the</p>
<p>initial research in the area of Indo-European languages was conducted in Northern Europe,</p>
<p>and especially in Germany.</p>
<p>And this naturally included a great deal of research into the early Germanic languages.</p>
<p>And since English is a Germanic language, this research revealed a great deal about</p>
<p>the history of English as well.</p>
<p>And in fact, one of the most important researchers in this area was a well-known collector of</p>
<p>German folktales, Jacob Grimm of Brothers Grimm fame.</p>
<p>So in this episode, we&rsquo;ll turn our attention to Germany and the set of rules which are</p>
<p>known today as Grimm&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also look at how linguists have used Grimm&rsquo;s research to reconstruct large portions</p>
<p>of the original Indo-European language, which hasn&rsquo;t been spoken for over 4,000 years.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s pick up where we left off back in Episode 2.</p>
<p>In that episode, we saw how a British judge in India named Sir William Jones determined</p>
<p>that a wide array of languages were related.</p>
<p>This included most of the languages of Europe and several important languages in the Near</p>
<p>East and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>And as we saw in the last episode, this family of languages includes many extinct languages,</p>
<p>known as dead languages, in the same regions.</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo;s lectures sparked an intense interest in the study of the Indo-European languages</p>
<p>and the ways in which they were connected.</p>
<p>The entire discipline of linguistics was developed in the 1800s in large part to determine which</p>
<p>languages belonged to the Indo-European family and which did not.</p>
<p>In the early 1800s, a German linguist named Franz Bopp studied the conjugation and structure</p>
<p>of Sanskrit in relation to European languages, and it was soon confirmed that Sanskrit was</p>
<p>indeed a relative of Latin, Greek, Modern English, and most other European languages.</p>
<p>These researchers also concluded that the ancestors of the Europeans and those of the</p>
<p>Hindus were at one time living together, and they spoke this common, shared language.</p>
<p>Now I mentioned that Franz Bopp was German, because the study of linguistics and Indo-European</p>
<p>ancestry was as intense in Germany during this period as anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, many of the most important early linguists were German or Austrian.</p>
<p>And as I said, this is actually a good thing from the perspective of English history, because</p>
<p>these linguists were looking primarily at the Germanic languages, of which English is</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>So why was Germany the source of so much early research in linguistics?</p>
<p>Well, we can probably boil it down to one famous name, and he wasn&rsquo;t even German.</p>
<p>He was a Frenchman named Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
<p>In the late 1700s, Germany didn&rsquo;t really exist, at least not as a unified state in</p>
<p>the sense that we know it today.</p>
<p>It was a conglomeration of around 300 separate political units, cities, independent states,</p>
<p>and provinces.</p>
<p>Neighboring France was really the dominant power in continental Europe, and by contrast,</p>
<p>Germany was a bit of a rough, disorganized backwater.</p>
<p>There was little industry and a very small urban population in Germany as compared to</p>
<p>France.</p>
<p>And during Napoleon&rsquo;s reign, he invaded and conquered the Germanic territories.</p>
<p>And as a result, these territories came to be occupied by French armies.</p>
<p>And while Germany was under the control of Napoleonic France, and in the wake of that</p>
<p>occupation, a sense of German nationalism started to emerge.</p>
<p>It began as a resistance movement against the French, but it soon blossomed into a pan-German</p>
<p>movement which sought to unify the historic German peoples.</p>
<p>The Germans began to embrace a national unity, and they rejected all things French, including</p>
<p>the ideas associated with the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Instead, they advocated for a common Germanic literature, thought, and culture.</p>
<p>This meant a return to native German roots.</p>
<p>A German national character was encouraged, and foreign elements, especially French influences,</p>
<p>were rejected, and in some cases, outright prohibited.</p>
<p>Now this may seem very reasonable and innocent during this early period in the early 1800s,</p>
<p>but it ultimately led to an extreme and very dark place in the 20th century with the rise</p>
<p>of fascism and Nazism.</p>
<p>And in fact, the evolution of the term Aryan, from its original use as the term for the</p>
<p>first Indo-Europeans, to its 20th century association with racism, is part of that misapplication</p>
<p>of linguistic research to perpetuate notions of racial superiority.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, language and ethnicity started to be mixed together and confused.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a warning to all of those who are not careful to distinguish language and ethnicity.</p>
<p>But that dark period came later.</p>
<p>For now, I want to focus on this earlier, more innocent period of German nationalism</p>
<p>in the early and mid-1800s.</p>
<p>During this period, scholarship and study into the history of the German language exploded.</p>
<p>Remember that during the period in which there was no unified German state, the one thing</p>
<p>that most of these people had in common was a shared language, and a general sense that</p>
<p>at some time in the ancient past they had been part of a larger, more unified Germanic</p>
<p>culture.</p>
<p>But the exact nature of that common Germanic character was unknown.</p>
<p>What did it mean to be German?</p>
<p>It was into this period of self-discovery that a couple of brothers appeared as collectors</p>
<p>of Germanic folktales.</p>
<p>These were, of course, the famous Brothers Grimm.</p>
<p>In many ways, they were a product of this early, burgeoning German nationalism.</p>
<p>Jacob Grimm confirmed this when he wrote in a letter that, quote,</p>
<p>All my works relate to the fatherland, from whose soil they derive their strength, end</p>
<p>quote.</p>
<p>So we can look at the collection of folktales by the Brothers Grimm as part of this larger</p>
<p>attempt to rediscover the native German culture and spirit.</p>
<p>And these collections of folktales were immediately and immensely popular, not just in Germany.</p>
<p>Closely tied to the collection of these German folktales was the study of the history of</p>
<p>the German language and German literature.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, one of the few unifying factors of the German people was their shared language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s therefore easy to see why this particular area was the subject of extensive research</p>
<p>and investigation to determine exactly what the German nature was.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier in this episode that some of the early work in this area was conducted</p>
<p>by a German linguist named Franz Bopp, who studied the conjugation and structure of Sanskrit</p>
<p>in relation to European languages.</p>
<p>But as you&rsquo;ll see, there were many others contributing to this research.</p>
<p>They were all part of this burgeoning field of study called comparative linguistics.</p>
<p>That just means comparing different languages to identify common features and to discern</p>
<p>from those similarities certain things about the history of the languages.</p>
<p>Much of this early work concerned sound changes from early versions of a language through</p>
<p>later versions.</p>
<p>In other words, linguists were looking at different languages and trying to identify</p>
<p>how the pronunciation of certain words and sounds had changed over time.</p>
<p>Much of the early work in this area was conducted by Friedrich von Schlegel and Rasmus Rask.</p>
<p>But it was Jacob Grimm, the fairy tale collector, who built upon their earlier work and is the</p>
<p>most famous researcher today because he documented the specific sound changes in detail.</p>
<p>Jacob spent an extensive amount of time studying the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>His brother Wilhelm appears to have been more involved in the actual collection of the folktales,</p>
<p>and Jacob eventually focused more on the study of the language itself.</p>
<p>He was a renowned linguist, and he lived in the first half of the 1800s in a society in</p>
<p>which there was this burgeoning sense of German nationalism and in which there was</p>
<p>an exploding interest in the German language and linguistics.</p>
<p>Prior to Grimm&rsquo;s work, it was difficult to determine with any certainty whether two or</p>
<p>more similar words in different languages were cognates, meaning that they had evolved</p>
<p>from a common word spoken in a common ancient ancestral language.</p>
<p>The problem is that similar words occur quite often between different languages.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s just a coincidence.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s because the word was borrowed into a language from another language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why English has so many words that look like French words.</p>
<p>English isn&rsquo;t a Romance language like French, but it borrowed a lot of words from French.</p>
<p>And so lots of English words resemble French words.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t mean that English came from French.</p>
<p>So similar words in different languages didn&rsquo;t really prove anything.</p>
<p>And it certainly didn&rsquo;t prove that the languages had evolved from a common ancient ancestor.</p>
<p>But it also didn&rsquo;t rule out that possibility either.</p>
<p>There was a lot of guesswork and speculation during this time period.</p>
<p>But Jacob Grimm helped to create a mechanism by which we can determine with reasonable</p>
<p>certainty if the similarities are in fact the result of inheritance, as opposed to borrowing</p>
<p>or coincidence.</p>
<p>Once we can identify with some degree of certainty that similar words in different languages</p>
<p>are in fact the result of inheritance, we can then begin the process of actually reconstructing</p>
<p>that earlier language.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at Grimm&rsquo;s work and see how he began to figure things out.</p>
<p>Grimm&rsquo;s work began by comparing thousands of words in the Germanic languages with words</p>
<p>in other languages.</p>
<p>This was a tedious and painstaking process.</p>
<p>And he looked for similarities.</p>
<p>But more importantly, he looked for patterns.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t just identify words that resembled each other.</p>
<p>He looked for systematic patterns to explain the similarities and the differences.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t just looking at the words as a whole.</p>
<p>He was also looking at the specific sounds within those words.</p>
<p>To put it another way, he was looking at the way in which sounds, especially consonants,</p>
<p>changed over time within the Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>And after comparing thousands of words, he concluded that there were indeed specific</p>
<p>sound differences in words found in the Germanic and non-Germanic languages.</p>
<p>But more importantly, he discovered that these sound differences were part of a systematic</p>
<p>change which had occurred within the Germanic-speaking tribes after they had become separated from</p>
<p>the other Indo-European groups.</p>
<p>Now all of this sounds very technical.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at some examples.</p>
<p>The first example should already be familiar to you if you&rsquo;ve listened to the first few</p>
<p>episodes of the podcast.</p>
<p>In the earlier episodes, I talked about how the P sound in many of the ancient Indo-European</p>
<p>words had shifted to an F sound in the words in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>This was one of the changes which Grimm noticed after comparing thousands of Germanic words</p>
<p>with words in other Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>The example I used in the earlier episodes of the podcast were the words for father.</p>
<p>As you may recall, the Sanskrit word for father was pitar.</p>
<p>The Latin word for father was pater, and the Greek word was very similar, pronounced pater.</p>
<p>But the English word is father from the Old English word fader.</p>
<p>So pitar, pater, pater, and father.</p>
<p>So there you can see the F sound in the Germanic languages where the P sound is in the other</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>I also gave the example of foot in an earlier episode.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word for foot was pod.</p>
<p>The Latin word was ped.</p>
<p>The Greek word was pus.</p>
<p>But the modern English word is foot.</p>
<p>And in all the Germanic languages, the word for foot began with an F sound.</p>
<p>So pod, ped, pus, and foot.</p>
<p>Once again, we see the shift to an F sound in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>And there are lots of other examples of this sound change.</p>
<p>For example, the Latin word for fish was piscis, which is the origin of the zodiac sign Pisces.</p>
<p>Again, we see evidence of the shift from the Latin piscis with the P sound to English fish</p>
<p>with the F sound.</p>
<p>We can also see that same sound change in the Latin word pyre, as in a funeral pyre,</p>
<p>and in the word pyromania.</p>
<p>The English equivalent is the word fire.</p>
<p>Both words basically mean fire or flames.</p>
<p>So from pyre to fire, we can hear the P to F sound shift.</p>
<p>Another interesting example of this P to F sound change can be seen in the English word</p>
<p>pen, as in the writing instrument P-E-N.</p>
<p>The word comes to us via French from the original Latin word pena.</p>
<p>But pena meant feather in Latin.</p>
<p>By the time Norman French brought the word into English as pen, it had come to mean a</p>
<p>quill, as in a feather used for writing.</p>
<p>So Latin pena and English feather are cognate.</p>
<p>And we see that the P sound from Latin, which was inherited from the earlier Indo-European</p>
<p>language, has shifted to an F sound in the Germanic word feather.</p>
<p>And as I said, there are many examples of this sound change.</p>
<p>And let me be clear, even though I&rsquo;m comparing English words to Latin words, I don&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>to imply that Latin was the original form of English or that English came from Latin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m merely using Latin as an example of another Indo-European language, one which</p>
<p>happens to be quite old and was being spoken over 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>So it existed at a time that was much closer to the original ancient Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And thus, not surprisingly, Latin has some strong similarities to that language.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, Latin and English each evolved separately from this ancient source</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve given you a few examples of what Jacob Grimm was observing as he looked at</p>
<p>and compared thousands of words.</p>
<p>And this P to F phenomenon was not the only systematic difference he observed.</p>
<p>There were others too.</p>
<p>In fact, he noted nine specific changes, which I&rsquo;ll look at in more detail in a minute.</p>
<p>But here was the key.</p>
<p>Grimm looked at all of these systematic differences and he concluded that the differences exist</p>
<p>because the sound had changed within the Germanic language family.</p>
<p>In other words, at some point in the distant past, a common group of early Indo-European</p>
<p>speaking people spoke these words with a P sound, as is still represented in all of the</p>
<p>other Indo-European language families.</p>
<p>Over time, they began to migrate and spread out.</p>
<p>And they carried their language with them.</p>
<p>And as they migrated, these various tribes became isolated from each other.</p>
<p>And their languages continued the natural course of evolution that all languages experience.</p>
<p>So that over time, these languages evolved into distinct dialects and eventually into</p>
<p>distinct languages.</p>
<p>That accounts for the various language families we have today.</p>
<p>Within these various isolated tribal groups, as the original language began to evolve,</p>
<p>words started to be pronounced differently.</p>
<p>And part of the change was a systematic change in the way certain consonants were pronounced.</p>
<p>And this is what happened within the early Germanic speaking tribes before they too spread</p>
<p>out over Central and Western Europe and carried the Germanic dialects with them.</p>
<p>And those dialects eventually evolved into the various Germanic languages we have today,</p>
<p>including English.</p>
<p>So these consonant differences that Grimm observed, like the P and the F that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>This represents a sound change.</p>
<p>Within the very early Germanic speaking tribes, there was a change in the way these words</p>
<p>were pronounced.</p>
<p>So that the original P sound began to be pronounced as an F sound.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why all of the Germanic languages today have these words with an F instead of</p>
<p>a P.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that not every P sound shifted to an F sound in the Germanic</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>I mean, the Germanic languages still have inherited words with a P sound.</p>
<p>So whether or not the P shifted to an F in a particular word depended on several factors,</p>
<p>like the position of the P sound in the word.</p>
<p>For example, the P sound tended to make this shift if it occurred at the beginning of a</p>
<p>word.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why most of the examples I&rsquo;m giving here feature the sound as the initial</p>
<p>consonant.</p>
<p>It took other linguists after Jacob Grimm to figure out exactly why this shift happened</p>
<p>in some words and not in other words.</p>
<p>Again, all of that was figured out later.</p>
<p>But the key is that Grimm identified that in fact this P sound did routinely shift to</p>
<p>an F sound in many Germanic words.</p>
<p>Now before we look at some of the other sound shifts that Jacob Grimm identified, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>look at this P to F sound shift a little closer and see what&rsquo;s going on mechanically.</p>
<p>I think this initially seems like more of a change than it really is.</p>
<p>We can get distracted subliminally by the names we give to the letters that represent</p>
<p>the sounds P and F. Because the letter name P doesn&rsquo;t really sound anything like the</p>
<p>letter name F. But those are just names we give to those sounds.</p>
<p>So forget about the names of the letters for a second and just think about the sounds</p>
<p>they represent, P and F. And think about the mechanical differences.</p>
<p>A P is made by putting the upper and lower lips together.</p>
<p>And an F is made by shifting the lower lip backward and instead of touching the top lip,</p>
<p>you touch the top teeth.</p>
<p>Now there are some other technical differences between the two sounds that I&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>to focus on because this is not a course in linguistics.</p>
<p>But I just want you to see that the two sounds are not that different mechanically.</p>
<p>And I think you can start to see how certain groups of speakers might make this change</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>And in fact, if we look closely enough, we can see this change in other languages as</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>In fact, we still have in English today a remnant of the same sound change that occurred</p>
<p>in Greek during the time of the ancient Greeks.</p>
<p>Think about the words we have in English that are spelled with a PH but are pronounced</p>
<p>as an F sound.</p>
<p>Words like phone, philosophy, elephant, and so on.</p>
<p>All of these words came from Greek.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at this PH business for a minute and see what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>In a future podcast episode, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the alphabet.</p>
<p>But for now, just understand that English borrowed the alphabet from the Romans, who</p>
<p>likely borrowed it from the Etruscans, who were neighbors of the Romans in Northern Italy.</p>
<p>The Etruscans traded with the Greeks, and it appears that the Etruscans borrowed the</p>
<p>alphabet from the Greeks as part of the regular trade between the two peoples.</p>
<p>And the Greeks themselves borrowed the alphabet from people that they routinely traded with</p>
<p>called the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>So the alphabet is the product of much borrowing.</p>
<p>The Phoenicians were a Semitic people from the Middle East.</p>
<p>They did not speak an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>So when the Greeks borrowed the alphabet from the Phoenicians, the Phoenicians had letters</p>
<p>for sounds which the Greeks didn&rsquo;t use.</p>
<p>And the Greeks had sounds which the Phoenicians didn&rsquo;t have in their language.</p>
<p>So the Greeks had to invent letters for those sounds.</p>
<p>One sound which the Greeks had that the Phoenicians did not have was a sound which is often described</p>
<p>as an aspirated P sound, as in upward.</p>
<p>Others describe it as more akin to an F sound, perhaps an in-between P-F sound.</p>
<p>Now there were no audio tapes from this period, obviously, so no one can say for certain what</p>
<p>it sounded like.</p>
<p>And remember that Greece was divided into separate city-states during this period, like</p>
<p>Athens and Sparta.</p>
<p>So the sound could have varied among the various regional Greek dialects.</p>
<p>Regardless of what it actually sounded like at the time, it was not a straightforward</p>
<p>P sound because the Phoenicians had a letter for that sound, which the Greeks adopted as</p>
<p>the letter pi.</p>
<p>So when the Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet, they had to create their own letter</p>
<p>for this aspirated P or P-F sound.</p>
<p>This later became the letter phi, spelled as P-H-I today.</p>
<p>It was probably pronounced as phi by the Greeks, but I&rsquo;ll use the more modern pronunciation</p>
<p>phi, as in the fraternity and sorority names.</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty in identifying the exact sound of this letter is that it was</p>
<p>probably in transition between the traditional P sound and the F sound at the time the Greeks</p>
<p>adopted the alphabet from the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they invented a separate letter for the sound.</p>
<p>When the Etruscans adopted the Greek version of the alphabet a few centuries later, they</p>
<p>apparently still detected a difference between the sound of Greek phi and the F sound because</p>
<p>the Etruscans made their own modifications to the Greek alphabet which included the addition</p>
<p>of the letter F as distinguished from the Greek letter phi.</p>
<p>So the Etruscans used both phi and F, but by the time the Romans adopted the same alphabet</p>
<p>from the Etruscans, they no longer detected much difference between the pronunciation</p>
<p>of the letters phi and the F which the Etruscans used.</p>
<p>In other words, by the time the Romans got hold of the alphabet, the sound had completed</p>
<p>its transition to the F sound, but the Romans chose to retain the P-H spelling in words</p>
<p>borrowed from Greek which had used the letter phi.</p>
<p>But as far as we can tell, the pronunciation of both letters was the same in Latin and</p>
<p>has essentially been the same ever since, including in modern English.</p>
<p>By the way, it also appears that the letter phi completed the same sound change within</p>
<p>Greek itself as it also came to represent an F sound in Greek.</p>
<p>The Romans probably noticed that there was no longer any distinction being made by the</p>
<p>Greeks themselves.</p>
<p>So we now have two different ways to represent the F sound in English.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re seeing in words like philosophy, which are spelled with P-H, is this same P</p>
<p>to F sound shift that was occurring within ancient Greek at the time when they first</p>
<p>adopted the alphabet, and which still exists today as a relic in the P-H spelling which</p>
<p>now represents a fully transitioned F sound.</p>
<p>So again, this is not within the Germanic family.</p>
<p>This is within a completely separate language family.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the same sound shift that Jacob Grimm had noted and identified within the</p>
<p>Germanic languages.</p>
<p>Now as I mentioned, the P to F sound shift was one of the sound shifts which he identified.</p>
<p>He actually identified nine separate sound shifts.</p>
<p>And just to summarize them, he noticed that the D sound had shifted to a T sound, and</p>
<p>the K sound had shifted to an H sound, the T sound had shifted to a TH sound, the B sound</p>
<p>had shifted to a P sound, and the G sound had shifted to a K sound.</p>
<p>And then there were three other changes from sounds that we don&rsquo;t really have in modern</p>
<p>English today.</p>
<p>A very aspirated B sound had evolved into a B sound.</p>
<p>And an aspirated D sound had become a D sound.</p>
<p>And a very aspirated G sound had become a G sound.</p>
<p>Now I want to look at each of these a little closer before we move on, because it actually</p>
<p>makes for some interesting etymology.</p>
<p>And one of the changes that Grimm noticed was this change from the D sound to the T</p>
<p>sound.</p>
<p>And I actually mentioned this in an earlier episode of the podcast.</p>
<p>I gave the example of the Latin and Greek word duo and the English word to.</p>
<p>They both mean to.</p>
<p>In that example, we can see that transition from the original D sound, which is reflected</p>
<p>in Latin and Greek in the word duo, and the T sound, which is reflected in the English</p>
<p>word to.</p>
<p>We can also see it in the Latin word decum and the English word ten.</p>
<p>Both of those mean ten.</p>
<p>I think I also gave the example of the Latin word dentist, which means tooth, and the English</p>
<p>word tooth.</p>
<p>And again, we can see that sound shift from the D sound to the T sound.</p>
<p>All of those pairs of words are cognate.</p>
<p>They were once the same word, but they&rsquo;ve evolved into separate words over time.</p>
<p>This D to T sound shift is quite obvious, and it&rsquo;s easy to see.</p>
<p>Think about the pronunciation of English words like bitter and latter.</p>
<p>In American English, those words are usually pronounced with a D sound.</p>
<p>So bitter becomes bitter, and latter becomes latter.</p>
<p>So that shift happens routinely.</p>
<p>Also think about words like hitter, fatter, and later, which also have the D sound in</p>
<p>American English.</p>
<p>Also consider kindergarten, which literally means child&rsquo;s garden in German.</p>
<p>In English, and especially in American English, it&rsquo;s pronounced with a D sound.</p>
<p>So kindergarten becomes kindergarten, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s still spelled with a T.</p>
<p>Now all of those examples represent a shift in the opposite direction, from T to D.</p>
<p>But Grimm noticed a shift from D to T, from the original Indo-European language to Germanic</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>And this is a little harder to find in modern English, but think about words in past tense,</p>
<p>like walked, which is usually pronounced with a T sound.</p>
<p>So we do see it sometimes, though not as often as the T to D shift.</p>
<p>Also once again, in the examples I&rsquo;ve given in this episode and in the earlier episodes,</p>
<p>we see how words came into English from multiple sources, especially Germanic root words and</p>
<p>Latin borrowed words, which mean basically the same thing.</p>
<p>And we have the same Indo-European root, which started it all.</p>
<p>So we have father from Germanic, and pater from Latin, which results in words like paternal</p>
<p>and patriarch.</p>
<p>And we have the English word ten from Germanic, and the Latin word decum, which produced words</p>
<p>like decade and decathlon in modern English.</p>
<p>Again, these words come from the same Indo-European root word.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look again at that Latin and Greek word duo.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned, this word is cognate with the English word to, meaning that both words</p>
<p>came from the same root word.</p>
<p>And in this case, we see the shift that Grimm identified from the original D sound to the</p>
<p>Germanic T sound.</p>
<p>Now the Latin and Greek forms of the word were borrowed into English and appear in a</p>
<p>variety of modern English words like duo, duet, and duel, meaning two.</p>
<p>But interestingly, duel, meaning a fight between two people, is only indirectly related to</p>
<p>duo.</p>
<p>The original word duo, or duo, eventually led to a separate word in Old Latin, dwellum,</p>
<p>meaning war or conflict, since a conflict required at least two parties.</p>
<p>Dwellum is the direct ancestor of duel, d-u-e-l.</p>
<p>So duel with an e came from dwellum, and duel with an a came from duo.</p>
<p>Over time, the Old Latin word dwellum evolved into the word bellum in Classical Latin, which</p>
<p>also meant the same thing, war or conflict.</p>
<p>The word bellum is found in many modern English words like antebellum, meaning before the</p>
<p>war, and typically used in reference to the American South before the Civil War.</p>
<p>It also appears in bellicose and belligerent and even rebellion.</p>
<p>All of these words involve some sort of conflict, and all ultimately derive from the Latin word</p>
<p>bellum, which came from dwellum, which came from duo, which, remember, came from the same</p>
<p>original Indo-European root word that produced the word to in English, thanks to Grimslaw.</p>
<p>So I think you can start to see how interconnected a lot of our words are.</p>
<p>But you can also see how one or two basic words in the original Indo-European language</p>
<p>produced many words in modern English, some of them coming in directly from the original</p>
<p>Germanic language, Old English, and others coming in from other Indo-European languages</p>
<p>like Greek and Latin, which were borrowed into the language later.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a quick look at one of the other sound changes that Grim identified.</p>
<p>He noted that the k sound in the original Indo-European language had shifted to an h</p>
<p>sound in the Germanic languages, including English.</p>
<p>So here we see lots of words in Latin and Greek that have a k sound where English has</p>
<p>an h sound.</p>
<p>So for example, in English we have the word heart.</p>
<p>But in Latin, the word was cord, which becomes cur in French and corazon in Spanish.</p>
<p>In Greek, the word was cardia, which comes into English through medical use.</p>
<p>Terms like cardiac arrest and cardiology refer to heart-related medical issues.</p>
<p>Again, here we have the original Indo-European k sound, which still exists in some English</p>
<p>words which have been borrowed in from Latin and Greek.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s represented by the h sound in the native Germanic Anglo-Saxon word heart.</p>
<p>Another example of this sound change is in the English word horn, which was cornu in</p>
<p>Latin.</p>
<p>And again, the Latin version finds its way into English in the word cornucopia, which</p>
<p>literally means horn of plenty.</p>
<p>Again, the Latin word cornu and the Germanic word horn come from the same root word in</p>
<p>the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The original sound was k and it shifted to an h in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>Another example of this is the English word hundred and the Latin word centum, which meant</p>
<p>hundred in Latin.</p>
<p>Centum was spelled c-e-n-t-u-m in Latin because the c represented the k sound in Latin.</p>
<p>But later, the c developed into an s sound in French and many other Latin-derived languages.</p>
<p>So the word centum eventually dropped the Latin um suffix at the end and changed the</p>
<p>c to an s at the beginning, producing the French word cent.</p>
<p>That word came into English in many ways, century, centennial, centimeter, centipede,</p>
<p>and even the word cent, which represents one one-hundredth of a dollar.</p>
<p>Again, the Latin-derived words, which mean hundred, came from the same original Indo-European</p>
<p>source as the Germanic English word hundred.</p>
<p>Under Grimm&rsquo;s Law, the sound had shifted from the original k sound in Latin to the</p>
<p>h sound in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>Now let me digress here for a second and mention a couple of things about the example I just</p>
<p>gave.</p>
<p>First, in the next episode of the podcast, I&rsquo;m actually going to explore this k sound</p>
<p>in greater detail, because early linguists noted that most of the Indo-European languages</p>
<p>have a word for hundred that begins with a k sound like the Latin word centum.</p>
<p>As I just said, the Germanic languages are an exception because the k had shifted to</p>
<p>an h sound.</p>
<p>But there was another whole group of Indo-European languages, spoken primarily in Asia and Eastern</p>
<p>Europe, where the word for hundred began with an s sound.</p>
<p>That was best represented by the Sanskrit word satam, which meant hundred in that language.</p>
<p>So early linguists noticed a geographical divide.</p>
<p>The Eastern Indo-European languages had a word for hundred that began with an s sound,</p>
<p>and the Western Indo-European languages had a word for hundred which began with a k sound,</p>
<p>or the shifted h sound in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So they concluded that this division probably represented an early division of the Indo-European</p>
<p>tribes, with those in the East developing the shift from the k sound to the s sound.</p>
<p>The Western languages were called the kentum languages after the Latin word kentum, and</p>
<p>the Eastern languages were called the satam languages after the Sanskrit word satam.</p>
<p>Now this distinction was once very important to linguists, and it&rsquo;s still important to</p>
<p>a certain extent, which I&rsquo;ll explain in the next episode.</p>
<p>But the real interesting part of this is the relationship between the k sound and the s</p>
<p>sound, which we see in the modern English letter c, which sometimes is pronounced like</p>
<p>a k and sometimes like an s.</p>
<p>And yes, there are some connections here.</p>
<p>So in the next episode, I&rsquo;m going to explore this connection, and we&rsquo;ll see how the modern</p>
<p>English letter c came to have two different pronunciations.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s go back to Grimms&rsquo; Law for a minute.</p>
<p>This k sound, which shifted to an h sound in native English words like hundred and heart,</p>
<p>can be seen in a few other examples as well.</p>
<p>I just wanted to point these out to you because they&rsquo;re interesting.</p>
<p>The modern English word head is cognate with the Latin word coppet.</p>
<p>Again, we have the same sound change that Grimm identified here.</p>
<p>The old English version of head was hafud.</p>
<p>So here we see two of Grimms&rsquo; Laws at work.</p>
<p>The Latin word coppet was probably very close to the original Indo-European word for head.</p>
<p>It has two consonants that shifted under Grimms&rsquo; Law.</p>
<p>The k sound at the beginning shifted to an h sound, and the p sound in the middle shifted</p>
<p>to an f sound under the first rule we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>So coppet compared with hafud in Old English.</p>
<p>And hafud was eventually shortened to one syllable in English by dropping the f sound</p>
<p>in the middle and thereby becoming head.</p>
<p>Once again, there are a ton of words in modern English which come from the Latin word coppet</p>
<p>for head.</p>
<p>It produced the words capital C-A-P-I-T-O-L and capital C-A-P-I-T-A-L, both meaning the</p>
<p>head place.</p>
<p>It also produced a massive number of words in French, which ultimately came into English.</p>
<p>So it produced words like decapitation.</p>
<p>There we can see that word coppet almost in its original form.</p>
<p>Decapitation means to remove the head.</p>
<p>The word captain, meaning head of troops, comes from that same Latin root word.</p>
<p>The word chieftain, meaning the head of a clan, also came from that same root word.</p>
<p>The word chief comes from that word.</p>
<p>And the word chef, meaning the head of a kitchen, comes from the same word.</p>
<p>Corporal, which was originally caporal, meant the head of troops, and it also comes from</p>
<p>the same root word.</p>
<p>The term cadet, meaning a junior head or military trainee, is cognate with the same original</p>
<p>word.</p>
<p>The term caddy, from cadet, as used in golf courses, also comes from that word.</p>
<p>Other words include mischief, literally meaning a bad head, as in something being brought</p>
<p>to a bad head, and kerchief, meaning a head covering, and neckerchief, meaning a French</p>
<p>head covering but worn by Englishmen around their necks, and handkerchief, meaning a French</p>
<p>head covering but held by Englishmen in their hands.</p>
<p>And of course the word cap, meaning a head covering, also came from the same root.</p>
<p>Again we can see how English borrowed heavily from Latin.</p>
<p>All of those words which meant head or having to do with the head, all come from a Latin</p>
<p>word that meant head, and is in fact derived from the same Indo-European root as the English</p>
<p>word head.</p>
<p>So they all come from the same Indo-European source.</p>
<p>Let me give you one more example of this K to H sound shift.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever studied a Romance language like Spanish or French, you&rsquo;ll know that</p>
<p>the words for who and what are quite different in those languages.</p>
<p>So in English we have the word what.</p>
<p>In Spanish it&rsquo;s que.</p>
<p>In French it&rsquo;s que.</p>
<p>And in the case of the English word who, the Spanish version is quien, and the French version</p>
<p>is qui.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very clear difference between the Germanic-derived English word and the</p>
<p>Latin-derived Romance words.</p>
<p>It may not appear that those words have anything in common, but in fact all of those words</p>
<p>meaning what are cognate, and all of those words meaning who are cognate.</p>
<p>So first, let&rsquo;s look at the word what.</p>
<p>In the original Indo-European language, the word was quad.</p>
<p>Over time, within Latin, the W sound in the word fell away, and eventually the D sound</p>
<p>at the end also fell away.</p>
<p>And so we ended up with the modern Spanish word que and the French word que.</p>
<p>But in English, we have Grimm&rsquo;s Law at work.</p>
<p>So that K sound in quad shifted to an H sound.</p>
<p>So it went from quad to whad.</p>
<p>So very close to what, but not what, because the H sound was still at the beginning.</p>
<p>Over time, since this is a bit awkward, the H sound fell away, and the pronunciation just</p>
<p>became what.</p>
<p>And eventually, as spelling became more standardized, the H and W were shifted around, so that in</p>
<p>modern English we actually spell it WHAT.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really just an indication by the people who created the first dictionaries</p>
<p>that it was the W that was the primary consonant at the beginning, no longer the H.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing in that example is the same rules at work.</p>
<p>We come from the same original source word, but under Grimm&rsquo;s Law, these words changed.</p>
<p>Similarly, the original Indo-European word for who was quos.</p>
<p>And again, the same thing happened.</p>
<p>The W sound fell away, and the S sound fell away at the end in the Latin words, and you</p>
<p>end up with quen in Spanish and qui in French.</p>
<p>But within the Germanic languages, that original K sound shifted to an H sound, and quos became</p>
<p>hwos.</p>
<p>And eventually, the W sound disappeared, and that produced the modern word who.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re coming from the same source.</p>
<p>With the application of Grimm&rsquo;s Law, we can see that words that appear to have nothing</p>
<p>in common actually came from the same source word.</p>
<p>Now just to finish out Grimm&rsquo;s sound changes, the T sound had shifted to a TH sound.</p>
<p>We see that in the Latin word trace and the English word three.</p>
<p>He mentioned also that the B sound became a P sound.</p>
<p>The B sound was actually very unusual and infrequent in the Indo-European languages,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t have a lot of examples of that sound change.</p>
<p>But there is a Lithuanian word dubas, which means the same thing as the English word deep.</p>
<p>So here we see the original B sound in the Lithuanian word, and the later Germanic P</p>
<p>sound in the English word.</p>
<p>Grimm also noted that the G sound had shifted to the K sound.</p>
<p>So we have the Latin word genus, which is the source of English words like genetics</p>
<p>and genealogy.</p>
<p>That original Latin root word was originally pronounced with that hard G sound at the beginning.</p>
<p>And that Indo-European G sound shifted to a K sound in the Germanic languages and produced</p>
<p>the English word kin.</p>
<p>So the Latin root word genus and its offspring genetics and genealogy are cognate with the</p>
<p>English word kin.</p>
<p>Again to emphasize the point, the English word didn&rsquo;t come from the Latin word.</p>
<p>They each evolved separately.</p>
<p>And we see Grimm&rsquo;s Law at work in how these two sets of words evolved from the same source</p>
<p>word.</p>
<p>We can also see this same sound shift in the Latin word agar, which meant field or land,</p>
<p>and the English word acre, which means a certain portion of land.</p>
<p>Again, the Indo-European G sound shifted to a K sound in the English word.</p>
<p>So in summary, Grimm identified this series of sound changes, which has occurred in a</p>
<p>systematic way from the original Indo-European language through the Germanic languages into</p>
<p>the modern Germanic languages that we have today.</p>
<p>And the changes became known as Grimm&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>But Grimm did not actually call them a law.</p>
<p>While he noticed that these consonants usually shifted in the way he described, they did</p>
<p>not always shift that way.</p>
<p>Sometimes they remained the same as the original consonants.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t even attempt to explain the changing sounds of the vowels.</p>
<p>So for Grimm, these were general rules, but not laws.</p>
<p>Fortunately, other linguists took up Grimm&rsquo;s work, and they explained the exceptions to</p>
<p>the general rules that Grimm had identified.</p>
<p>The German linguist Hermann Grassmann and the Danish linguist Carl Werner essentially</p>
<p>completed Grimm&rsquo;s work, and they left us with a set of rules which could explain every</p>
<p>sound shift between words found in the original Indo-European language and the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So this brings us to the major point of this episode.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work of linguists like Jacob Grimm and Carl Werner, and specifically the</p>
<p>rules we know today as Grimm&rsquo;s Law and Werner&rsquo;s Law, linguists could explain every consonant</p>
<p>shift between the original Indo-European language and the early Germanic languages.</p>
<p>Other linguists also worked out vowel shifts as well.</p>
<p>And this same process of identifying sound shifts was conducted by other linguists in</p>
<p>the other Indo-European languages as well, so that we have specific rules for sound changes</p>
<p>in all of the major Indo-European language families, not just the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>And with those rules in place, linguists could now reconstruct substantial portions</p>
<p>of the original Indo-European language, known as Proto-Indo-European.</p>
<p>But how could they do this?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s actually quite simple.</p>
<p>Sound changes, like Grimm&rsquo;s Law and Werner&rsquo;s Law, can be used both ways.</p>
<p>They can show us how modern words evolve from older words, but they can also be applied</p>
<p>in reverse to take a modern word and determine what it originally looked and sounded like.</p>
<p>You just take a modern English word and apply Grimm&rsquo;s Law and Werner&rsquo;s Law in reverse,</p>
<p>and you can reconstruct what the original version of the word sounded like.</p>
<p>But how do you know if the reconstructed word is accurate?</p>
<p>Well, you follow the same process for the related word in the other Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>So you can reconstruct the word father in English.</p>
<p>And using the rules of sound change for Latin, you can reconstruct the Latin word pater.</p>
<p>And you can do the same using the rules of sound change in Sanskrit for the Sanskrit</p>
<p>word pitar.</p>
<p>And when you do that, you should end up with the same or almost the exact same word.</p>
<p>If they all match, you can reasonably conclude that you have cognates, modern words that</p>
<p>evolved from a common shared word.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in fact what you get when you follow that process for the various versions</p>
<p>of the word for father.</p>
<p>But if the reconstructed words don&rsquo;t match, then you probably have words that were not</p>
<p>inherited from the same original word.</p>
<p>Instead, you probably have words that were borrowed at some point from the other language,</p>
<p>or words that are similar due to coincidence.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>The more cognate words we have to compare, the more accurate the reconstructed Indo-European</p>
<p>word will be.</p>
<p>For example, the Indo-European word for hundred has been reconstructed as kemptum from cognates</p>
<p>from eight different Indo-European branches.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very reliable.</p>
<p>But sometimes we only have cognate words in a couple of the branches of the Indo-European</p>
<p>family tree.</p>
<p>So in those cases, the reconstructed word may not be as reliable.</p>
<p>Linguists have even predicted historical sound changes for which there was no evidence at</p>
<p>the time, but which were actually discovered and confirmed later by using these rules.</p>
<p>So now you can see how linguists have been able to reconstruct an ancient language which</p>
<p>was spoken but never written down.</p>
<p>We will now begin to turn our attention to that language and see what it can tell us</p>
<p>about the evolution of English from that early ancestral language to the modern English</p>
<p>language of today.</p>
<p>But before we look at the original Indo-European language, there&rsquo;s one last aspect of sound</p>
<p>shifts that I want to explore.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there is one set of sound shifts that is reflected in our letter</p>
<p>C and the way in which it can be used to represent both the K sound and the S sound in modern</p>
<p>English.</p>
<p>So in the next episode, I want to explore the fascinating history of the letter C.</p>
<p>Now before I conclude this episode, let me invite you to provide a rating or leave a</p>
