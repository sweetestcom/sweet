<p>gonna be thrown your way so get ready</p>
<p>get ready to catch em</p>
<p>you get it i had to</p>
<p>simplify it a little bit as best as i</p>
<p>could without losing the overall</p>
<p>story charles manson here we go</p>
<p>charles maddox</p>
<p>was born november 12th 1934</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s a scorpio</p>
<p>in cincinnati ohio to his</p>
<p>mother kathleen</p>
<p>maddox who was just 15 at the time</p>
<p>of his birth</p>
<p>charles wouldn&rsquo;t have a relationship with his</p>
<p>biological father</p>
<p>his mother kathleen</p>
<p>she ended up</p>
<p>marrying a man by the name of william manson</p>
<p>about four months before she gave birth to charles</p>
<p>so charles took the name</p>
<p>manson then when the couple separated in 1937</p>
<p>charles kept</p>
<p>the last name</p>
<p>tarnished that name</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure</p>
<p>as a way to make money kathleen</p>
<p>worked as a sex worker and participated in petty</p>
<p>crimes it was said that charles</p>
<p>mother wanted</p>
<p>nothing to do with him that at one</p>
<p>point when he was a baby</p>
<p>his mom tried to sell him as a baby</p>
<p>to a waitress</p>
<p>in return for a</p>
<p>pitcher of beer</p>
<p>to some people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s considered a fair trade</p>
<p>in 1939 kathleen was sent to prison for five years for</p>
<p>armed robbery</p>
<p>and during this time charles</p>
<p>was sent to live with his aunt and</p>
<p>uncle in west virginia</p>
<p>if i call him charlie</p>
<p>and charles just know it&rsquo;s the same person</p>
<p>whatever charlie seemed to bounce around a lot</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t really have a stable home but he</p>
<p>would visit</p>
<p>his off the grid uncle</p>
<p>who lived in the kentucky mountains from time to time</p>
<p>this uncle seemed to have like a lasting</p>
<p>impression on charles okay this</p>
<p>uncle he was an outcast</p>
<p>and would tell charles not to go to those</p>
<p>schools because they</p>
<p>brainwashed kids and</p>
<p>stuff you know</p>
<p>that uncle but</p>
<p>charlie said that he really liked him</p>
<p>he was different he was off the grid man</p>
<p>when charlie was nine he</p>
<p>tried to set his</p>
<p>school on fire</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>they sent him to reform</p>
<p>school between 1942 and 1947</p>
<p>charles mom she was out of prison</p>
<p>and he would stay with her</p>
<p>which he said</p>
<p>was like one of the happiest times from his childhood</p>
<p>then she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and she wouldn&rsquo;t take care of him anymore</p>
<p>and then she was arrested again</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t able to put him in a foster home so the</p>
<p>court stepped in and placed him in a</p>
<p>school for boys in indiana</p>
<p>the school was very</p>
<p>strict and often abused the boys and</p>
<p>after about 10</p>
<p>months he ran away to find his mom</p>
<p>but she really wanted nothing to do with him</p>
<p>and when charles</p>
<p>found her she was like</p>
<p>shit you found me</p>
<p>damn it so as you can probably gather</p>
<p>pretty loveless</p>
<p>childhood okay</p>
<p>great he spent a lot of his</p>
<p>childhood in different</p>
<p>schools for boys</p>
<p>he went to the</p>
<p>famous boys town</p>
<p>which we can do like a whole</p>
<p>story on this</p>
<p>place alone</p>
<p>okay but not</p>
<p>today but he went there</p>
<p>and charles</p>
<p>would run away he</p>
<p>would commit a robbery</p>
<p>then he would be sent back he</p>
<p>would go a different</p>
<p>school for boys</p>
<p>and repeat like it was just this</p>
<p>cycle then he got sent to another terrible</p>
<p>place it was the indiana boy school</p>
<p>where charles said that he</p>
<p>would be beat and raped by people in charge</p>
<p>he was heavily</p>
<p>abused throughout</p>
<p>these schools he attended he</p>
<p>tried to run away here but same thing</p>
<p>he would run away</p>
<p>commit a crime</p>
<p>like armed robbery</p>
<p>theft he robbed a gas station he was caught</p>
<p>a couple of times trying to rape or molest boys</p>
<p>then he would get arrested</p>
<p>and get sent back to a different school</p>
<p>it was just like a hot</p>
<p>mess when charles reached 20 years old in 1955 he</p>
<p>married a 17 year old waitress</p>
<p>named rose not long</p>
<p>after she was pregnant</p>
<p>the two of them</p>
<p>stole a car</p>
<p>and drove to los angeles</p>
<p>when he was there he</p>
<p>was caught and he</p>
<p>was sentenced to</p>
<p>three years in prison</p>
<p>while charlie sat in prison</p>
<p>rose she had her baby she</p>
<p>moved in with her family in los angeles</p>
<p>then she met another man and moved on</p>
<p>and they separated</p>
<p>charles manson had a baby</p>
<p>which is super sad cause</p>
<p>later on in life</p>
<p>i think he committed suicide</p>
<p>so when charlie got out of prison</p>
<p>he just found odd jobs</p>
<p>like pimping 16 year olds</p>
<p>stealing cars forging</p>
<p>checks stealing</p>
<p>where he could</p>
<p>he ended up getting</p>
<p>another 10 year sentence for violating his probation</p>
<p>this time though he</p>
<p>would only serve</p>
<p>seven and a half years</p>
<p>so this time though when he was in prison he</p>
<p>learned how to play guitar</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when he</p>
<p>started to become</p>
<p>really into playing</p>
<p>music music is my passion</p>
<p>prison was rough</p>
<p>but it was like a home</p>
<p>to charlie and he was raised in there and it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>where he formed his outlook on life i mean</p>
<p>based off of</p>
<p>what he said he refused to be programmed by the</p>
<p>world or go</p>
<p>along with the</p>
<p>expectations of what was considered being a functioning</p>
<p>normal adult instead he</p>
<p>would just sit in his jail cell play his guitar</p>
<p>and write music</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not me trying to make him</p>
<p>sound all peaches and cream</p>
<p>nene rumor has it prison is like</p>
<p>super rough</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t play around there</p>
<p>okay there are rules to be followed</p>
<p>so growing up in prison</p>
<p>and being in constant</p>
<p>fighter flight mode</p>
<p>i think just really like made him</p>
<p>freaking psycho</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure i mean how do you come out normal</p>
<p>in this situation</p>
<p>in nineteen</p>
<p>sixty seven</p>
<p>charles was released from prison</p>
<p>and he actually</p>
<p>asked if he</p>
<p>could stay he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna go i mean what the hell was he</p>
<p>gonna do but this time when he left</p>
<p>prison it was actually a lot different for him okay he</p>
<p>was in san francisco in the mid nineteen sixties babe</p>
<p>things had changed</p>
<p>things had changed</p>
<p>it was the time of the flower child</p>
<p>hippies were thriving</p>
<p>in the hate ashbury</p>
<p>district of san francisco tons of</p>
<p>young adults were coming from all over the</p>
<p>place just coming out to the area to advocate for</p>
<p>peace and love grow</p>
<p>their hair out long</p>
<p>join a commune</p>
<p>and just like go on a spiritual journey man</p>
<p>but then lsd</p>
<p>was introduced to the</p>
<p>scene and now people were not only</p>
<p>going on their spiritual journeys</p>
<p>but they were just straight up</p>
<p>tripping balls that&rsquo;s when it</p>
<p>started to turn more</p>
<p>aggressive because</p>
<p>drugs and money</p>
<p>and there was just like lots of journeys happening</p>
<p>anywho so charles</p>
<p>enters the scene</p>
<p>and he actually liked this because</p>
<p>these people were all about</p>
<p>peace and love we don&rsquo;t need the</p>
<p>system sleep on the streets play</p>
<p>music do drugs</p>
<p>he had long hair and a guitar</p>
<p>it was just like charles cup of tea he fit</p>
<p>right in he</p>
<p>would play music</p>
<p>on the streets</p>
<p>people would gather around anyone</p>
<p>who met him said that he had this charisma about him</p>
<p>he just knew how to talk to people and make them feel</p>
<p>special important</p>
<p>and like heard</p>
<p>so charles he really just</p>
<p>started making friends one of his</p>
<p>first followers was</p>
<p>lynette from</p>
<p>and she met</p>
<p>charlie early on</p>
<p>and said that he was just easy to talk to</p>
<p>and his mind just really intrigued her then soon</p>
<p>after that he met</p>
<p>pat krenwinkle</p>
<p>at a mutual friend&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>charlie was there playing</p>
<p>guitar people came over to hang out and pat and charlie</p>
<p>ended up like</p>
<p>really hitting it off and involving in some</p>
<p>sexual relations</p>
<p>she said that she just felt very</p>
<p>loved by him the way he gave her attention was</p>
<p>fulfilling she was young</p>
<p>she ran away from home she was desperate for</p>
<p>love and attention and charlie just gave that to her</p>
<p>and he seemed to do that with a lot</p>
<p>of different women</p>
<p>so charlie also had a man named tex</p>
<p>watson who joined</p>
<p>the growing family a way to get a man to stay with the</p>
<p>group and join in on the fun charlie</p>
<p>would offer</p>
<p>women to the men</p>
<p>in hopes to gain their</p>
<p>trust and get them to stay charlie</p>
<p>would like round up</p>
<p>more women sell</p>
<p>trade them for sex</p>
<p>he was really good at manipulating people</p>
<p>and he mentioned that it&rsquo;s just something</p>
<p>he learned or like picked up in prison</p>
<p>the prettiest</p>
<p>girls he called the</p>
<p>front street girls and</p>
<p>these were the ones that</p>
<p>he thought were the most</p>
<p>attractive out of the</p>
<p>bunch and would lure</p>
<p>others to join</p>
<p>their group</p>
<p>like hey you</p>
<p>should come meet my friend charlie</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s super cool and like you</p>
<p>would really love it and then we can like</p>
<p>do stuff over time</p>
<p>charles was attracting more and more people into his</p>
<p>group or what he called his family</p>
<p>he gained their trust and</p>
<p>gave them drugs had sex played</p>
<p>music it was</p>
<p>just like somewhere all they lost kids wanted to be</p>
<p>most of the</p>
<p>followers left home they had like nothing to</p>
<p>their name in</p>
<p>search of a new life anti system</p>
<p>peace and love</p>
<p>so finding a family</p>
<p>of people with similar interest</p>
<p>really kept</p>
<p>people there</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s how a cold</p>
<p>starts in the summer of 1967</p>
<p>charles and his family</p>
<p>they left san francisco</p>
<p>got too much</p>
<p>they left san francisco in a bus</p>
<p>and they drove up and down the</p>
<p>coast just going from</p>
<p>place to place</p>
<p>which kept everybody</p>
<p>entertained you know they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t getting bored</p>
<p>cause it was like new location cool</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen this rock before eventually</p>
<p>they made it to los angeles</p>
<p>where they spent most of</p>
<p>their time plus</p>
<p>charlie really</p>
<p>wanted to like make a name for himself playing music</p>
<p>in march of 1968 two of the family members</p>
<p>two of the girls</p>
<p>they were walking</p>
<p>along sunset boulevard in los angeles</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what was</p>
<p>going on like what they were doing</p>
<p>maybe they were trying to find new family members</p>
<p>so either way they&rsquo;re just walking</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re hitchhiking</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re trying to find a ride to</p>
<p>where they were all staying at</p>
<p>and dennis wilson ends up picking them up he&rsquo;s from the</p>
<p>beach boys who</p>
<p>were a very popular group</p>
<p>still pretty popular right</p>
<p>you hear the</p>
<p>beach boys everywhere sometimes</p>
<p>especially like when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shopping they always have the</p>
<p>beach boys playing but they were very popular</p>
<p>so yet like yeah</p>
<p>small world but</p>
<p>he picks these two women up</p>
<p>who belong to the manson family</p>
<p>to make a long</p>
<p>story short the</p>
<p>women tell him</p>
<p>about the man that they&rsquo;re staying with</p>
<p>a spiritual</p>
<p>guru of some sorts you know</p>
<p>spiritual guru</p>
<p>his name is charlie</p>
<p>you should meet him</p>
<p>and then charles actually ends up</p>
<p>going over to dennis wilson&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>they really</p>
<p>seemed to hit it off i mean they became like bffs</p>
<p>okay so then they end up</p>
<p>spending like more and more time together</p>
<p>and then soon the</p>
<p>whole manson family</p>
<p>ended up moving</p>
<p>in with dennis wilson and like his nice ass</p>
<p>place they are living with him doing drugs playing</p>
<p>music writing</p>
<p>music recording</p>
<p>music together</p>
<p>it seemed like charles manson was on his way to</p>
<p>becoming a beach boy</p>
<p>dennis wilson really wanted him to be a part of the</p>
<p>group but some of the</p>
<p>other beach boys they</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t like him</p>
<p>they refused to work with him</p>
<p>some members of the</p>
<p>beach boys were telling dennis</p>
<p>like hey you</p>
<p>need to get rid of this this guy like he&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just getting</p>
<p>all sorts of bad vibes you need to drop him</p>
<p>all he wants to do is</p>
<p>party do drugs like he&rsquo;s just not good for you</p>
<p>the manson family</p>
<p>ends up getting kicked out of dennis&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and they end up cutting</p>
<p>ties with one another</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more complicated</p>
<p>than that but for the most part that is what happened</p>
<p>the beach boys song bluebirds over the mountain</p>
<p>was originally a song written by charles manson</p>
<p>that the beach boys recorded and didn&rsquo;t credit him on</p>
<p>but charles says that was his song</p>
<p>okay and they didn&rsquo;t credit him on it</p>
<p>so charles is pissed obviously</p>
<p>while they were living together</p>
<p>charlie met a well</p>
<p>known music producer</p>
<p>named terry melcher</p>
<p>charles knew that this producer</p>
<p>had altered his music</p>
<p>and honestly just hated him</p>
<p>he hated charlie because</p>
<p>he just didn&rsquo;t like him they had issues and then he</p>
<p>ended up stealing his</p>
<p>music and altering it and</p>
<p>using it and not crediting him</p>
<p>so charlie is obviously very pissed off and held a very</p>
<p>nasty grudge</p>
<p>against this producer</p>
<p>and there really wasn&rsquo;t anything he</p>
<p>could do about it</p>
<p>terry is important so remember terry</p>
<p>august of 1968</p>
<p>susan atkins who was like a longtime family</p>
<p>member at this point</p>
<p>found the family a new home</p>
<p>it was an old western movie set</p>
<p>which had been turned into a writing stable</p>
<p>it was owned at the time by an 80 year old half</p>
<p>blind man named george spawn</p>
<p>they find this</p>
<p>place they think it&rsquo;s perfect</p>
<p>great the whole gang moved in</p>
<p>great location</p>
<p>for a cold honestly</p>
<p>so soon after a</p>
<p>woman by the name of</p>
<p>leslie van houten</p>
<p>she joined the family</p>
<p>and they all stayed in that old torn down movie set</p>
<p>spawn ranch</p>
<p>it was said to be all</p>
<p>fun and innocent</p>
<p>they spent time</p>
<p>play acting</p>
<p>movie roles kind of like summer camp with your friends</p>
<p>so it was said when they were there</p>
<p>it was like time didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist there was no time</p>
<p>they were all just living in the moment</p>
<p>the now they</p>
<p>would pretend</p>
<p>every day was halloween</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>dress up in costumes play</p>
<p>different roles and it was just a way for them to get</p>
<p>out of themselves let</p>
<p>their ego go and their</p>
<p>world views</p>
<p>and by removing</p>
<p>their egos it would</p>
<p>allow charlie</p>
<p>in and change</p>
<p>their views on the</p>
<p>world charlie</p>
<p>would tell family members</p>
<p>that society was corrupt and that they needed to forget</p>
<p>everything they&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>learned i can talk</p>
<p>charlie would tell them that he was the</p>
<p>noble one the one with all the answers and only he</p>
<p>knew the truth</p>
<p>so the family they</p>
<p>would drop acid all the time and they</p>
<p>would do different exercises together</p>
<p>while tripping balls you know he</p>
<p>would make everyone sit around like in a circle</p>
<p>and he would be in the middle and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d have everybody</p>
<p>focus on him</p>
<p>he was the focal</p>
<p>point he would also tell them to get rid of</p>
<p>their past forget</p>
<p>their mothers and fathers</p>
<p>and that they needed to die in</p>
<p>order to be rebuilt</p>
<p>some of the members said that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny we can</p>
<p>laugh but it&rsquo;s not funny</p>
<p>it is funny</p>
<p>because some of the members</p>
<p>said that like he even reenacted the crucifixion</p>
<p>while they were on lsd</p>
<p>and because they were</p>
<p>tripping it was like oh my god</p>
<p>jesus is melting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s jesus bro</p>
<p>so this group they&rsquo;re cut</p>
<p>off from society in the middle of nowhere doing drugs</p>
<p>every day with the same people</p>
<p>brainwashing seemed to happen</p>
<p>charles his</p>
<p>philosophy was the notion of oneness</p>
<p>and the power of love but over time his</p>
<p>he got more and more paranoid</p>
<p>his messaging</p>
<p>would become darker</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>right or wrong in life</p>
<p>death and life were the same</p>
<p>thing not to fear it</p>
<p>death was actually a welcoming</p>
<p>to a better life this is what he&rsquo;s telling them</p>
<p>it was said it got to a</p>
<p>point where charlie stopped letting anybody</p>
<p>leave the compound without his</p>
<p>permission they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t allowed to listen to any</p>
<p>music except</p>
<p>for the beatles</p>
<p>the moody blues</p>
<p>or charles&rsquo;s own music</p>
<p>like i mentioned in last</p>
<p>monday&rsquo;s upload in 1966 there was like a</p>
<p>bunch of riots</p>
<p>going on protesting</p>
<p>against the war in vietnam</p>
<p>so charlie was following this but</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t allow his members to know</p>
<p>about what was going on</p>
<p>but he seemed to be</p>
<p>becoming paranoid that there was</p>
<p>going to be a race war happening soon</p>
<p>now this is</p>
<p>where things get</p>
<p>tricky and people</p>
<p>have different versions for what happened next</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the helter skelter version</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;ll explain</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s like the drug deal gone</p>
<p>wrong version</p>
<p>that i personally</p>
<p>think is what really happened</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think the helter skelter</p>
<p>doomsday cult</p>
<p>thing was a</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ll explain i know</p>
<p>controversial</p>
<p>oh my god so july nineteen sixty nine</p>
<p>um one of the followers was text his name was text</p>
<p>remember okay cool</p>
<p>so he was also a drug dealer</p>
<p>while living on the ranch</p>
<p>it was said that</p>
<p>tex went to go to a deal with another dealer</p>
<p>named bernard</p>
<p>crow in los angeles</p>
<p>text was buying a lot of drugs from this guy like</p>
<p>twelve hundred dollars worth</p>
<p>text didn&rsquo;t have all of the</p>
<p>money but he told bernard</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;ll take the drugs get the rest of your money</p>
<p>and then come back and pay you</p>
<p>cause you know that always works bernard was like</p>
<p>how do i know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna come back</p>
<p>and text was like</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my girlfriend i&rsquo;ll have her</p>
<p>stay with you she&rsquo;ll stay here with you as collateral</p>
<p>he agrees and then text takes off</p>
<p>text never comes back</p>
<p>yeah i know what to do so his</p>
<p>girlfriend is probably like yeah don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry he&rsquo;s coming back he&rsquo;s a man of his word he</p>
<p>would never just</p>
<p>leave me here</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>twelve hours go by and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah maybe he got sight</p>
<p>tractor something he loves me he&rsquo;s coming back</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not coming back is he</p>
<p>no okay so some time passes bernard</p>
<p>still has the</p>
<p>girlfriend hostage mind you</p>
<p>and then he calls up text</p>
<p>now text his real name was also charles</p>
<p>but everyone called him text</p>
<p>so bernard calls</p>
<p>the number to reach text</p>
<p>at the compound or whatever bernard asks for charles</p>
<p>because he means text</p>
<p>but it was actually charles manson that was on the</p>
<p>other end yeah</p>
<p>so bernard is like i want my</p>
<p>money where&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>money bernard then said that if he didn&rsquo;t get his</p>
<p>money he was</p>
<p>going to burn down the</p>
<p>ranch and rape all his women</p>
<p>so charles manson</p>
<p>then decides</p>
<p>to take matters into his own hand</p>
<p>he goes down to meet with bernard</p>
<p>walks in they</p>
<p>fight charles</p>
<p>shoots him charles grabs the girl</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>leaves him behind</p>
<p>bernard actually survives but charlie</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know that he</p>
<p>thinks he&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>charlie starts to get really paranoid</p>
<p>because he believed that bernard belonged to the</p>
<p>group black panthers</p>
<p>and that they were</p>
<p>going to come</p>
<p>after him and his family</p>
<p>for what he did</p>
<p>i mean this guy bernard was like a bigwig drug dealer</p>
<p>once someone got word it was like</p>
<p>it was gonna be over for him</p>
<p>so charlie starts warning the family members that the</p>
<p>black panthers are</p>
<p>going to kill them</p>
<p>and that they need to</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>fend for themselves</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s just getting really paranoid</p>
<p>and hopes that nobody finds out what he did</p>
<p>he decides that</p>
<p>he needs to get the family members to commit crimes</p>
<p>and then make them complicit in the</p>
<p>crimes that he had committed</p>
<p>i feel like criminals always overcomplicate things</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s just a personal opinion though</p>
<p>but i feel like it&rsquo;s very true</p>
<p>due to his growing paranoia that the</p>
<p>black panther</p>
<p>group was coming</p>
<p>after him charles enlisted a</p>
<p>motorcycle gang</p>
<p>called the straight</p>
<p>satans for protection</p>
<p>over the compound</p>
<p>in exchange for protection</p>
<p>charlie promised him or them</p>
<p>all the girls they wanted here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>throw some names at you but it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>just follow it</p>
<p>so one day the</p>
<p>biker guys wanted drugs they want to do some drugs</p>
<p>and one of the family members his name was bobby</p>
<p>he said that there was a guy</p>
<p>named gary hinman</p>
<p>who would be able to</p>
<p>supply them with some goods</p>
<p>so the biker</p>
<p>guys give bobby some money</p>
<p>and he goes and he gets drugs from gary</p>
<p>so the biker</p>
<p>guys they do the drugs</p>
<p>afterwards they&rsquo;re pissed</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pissed because the guys from the straight</p>
<p>satans said the drugs were bad and they wanted</p>
<p>their money back for being ripped off</p>
<p>these guys were growing more and more</p>
<p>angry threatening to kill people if they didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>their money back</p>
<p>so charlie told</p>
<p>bobby and two</p>
<p>other family members</p>
<p>mary brunner and</p>
<p>susan atkins to go with</p>
<p>bobby get the</p>
<p>money back from gary heinman because</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t want any problems with the biker guys like</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t want to be on</p>
<p>their bad side charlie already believed that the</p>
<p>black panthers were</p>
<p>after him he didn&rsquo;t want the straight</p>
<p>satan&rsquo;s after him either so the</p>
<p>three of them head out and when they get to gary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house they have like a gun and</p>
<p>stuff they&rsquo;re threatening him</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like we want our</p>
<p>money back the drugs were fake whatever</p>
<p>gary refused to give them the</p>
<p>money back saying</p>
<p>that the drugs were good and he didn&rsquo;t even have the</p>
<p>money cause he already</p>
<p>spent it and then things</p>
<p>seemed to escalate</p>
<p>escalade things</p>
<p>escalated and then</p>
<p>bobby mary and susan</p>
<p>stayed at gary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house for like two days they had him tied up</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to reason with him to give up the</p>
<p>money or give them something valuable that he</p>
<p>could give to the straight</p>
<p>saints in lieu of the</p>
<p>money at some</p>
<p>point there was</p>
<p>a bit of a struggle that happened</p>
<p>and one of the girls ends up calling charlie manson</p>
<p>to let him know that gary wasn&rsquo;t cooperating and then</p>
<p>charles was like okay</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>bobby regained</p>
<p>control and then soon</p>
<p>after gary agreed to sign over his cars</p>
<p>which were worth</p>
<p>about a thousand dollars</p>
<p>he could use the cars and the little</p>
<p>money so they&rsquo;re making this</p>
<p>agreement cool then</p>
<p>this sounds like a cheesy</p>
<p>movie but this</p>
<p>yes then charlie comes busting through the door</p>
<p>he has a confederate</p>
<p>knife bust through the door</p>
<p>cut scary across the face</p>
<p>starts threatening him</p>
<p>bobby was like okay</p>
<p>that was really unnecessary you know</p>
<p>but what do we do now</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t just let him go he&rsquo;ll rat us out</p>
<p>bobby ends up killing gary</p>
<p>because that was really his only option</p>
<p>so he takes the</p>
<p>knife and he just kills</p>
<p>gary so before leaving gary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house bobby</p>
<p>wrote on the walls and gary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blood he drew a</p>
<p>black panther paw print</p>
<p>along with the words political piggy</p>
<p>and he did this because</p>
<p>it was recommended to him</p>
<p>by charles manson because he wanted to</p>
<p>throw off investigators and</p>
<p>make them believe that the murder was related to the</p>
<p>black panthers</p>
<p>tying back to the bernard</p>
<p>crow shooting like</p>
<p>maybe they would tie</p>
<p>those two together not long</p>
<p>after though</p>
<p>bobby was pulled over</p>
<p>and arrested in one of gary&rsquo;s cars</p>
<p>and he was being</p>
<p>charged with the murdy murdy and</p>
<p>he was being</p>
<p>charged for the murder of gary heinman</p>
<p>because he did it yeah you know so yeah it makes sense</p>
<p>bobby was a family</p>
<p>member though</p>
<p>okay the group</p>
<p>stood up for</p>
<p>their family members</p>
<p>so when he was arrested</p>
<p>charlie started getting really paranoid that</p>
<p>things were</p>
<p>gonna lead back to him</p>
<p>he knew that they had to get</p>
<p>bobby out so the</p>
<p>group decided to kill</p>
<p>again they would</p>
<p>stage it to look like a</p>
<p>copycat murder leading investigators to believe whoever</p>
<p>did it also</p>
<p>probably committed the gary</p>
<p>heinman henman murder</p>
<p>which meant</p>
<p>bobby wasn&rsquo;t involved because he was in jail</p>
<p>so it would make them</p>
<p>think that they had the wrong guy</p>
<p>and then bobby</p>
<p>would be set free</p>
<p>flawless plan totally makes sense</p>
<p>nobody will know</p>
<p>again criminals always overcomplicate</p>
<p>things but this is what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking so back at</p>
<p>spawn ranch charlie and tex</p>
<p>they were like trying to come up with a plan</p>
<p>who do we hate that we can kill</p>
<p>and create like this copycat scene</p>
<p>hmm terry melcher</p>
<p>remember the</p>
<p>music producer</p>
<p>yeah so charlie had been to</p>
<p>terry&rsquo;s home at one</p>
<p>point when they were living</p>
<p>with the beach boy</p>
<p>so he knew where</p>
<p>terry lived</p>
<p>august 9th 1969</p>
<p>in a big old</p>
<p>house on celio</p>
<p>drive in los angeles</p>
<p>is where actress</p>
<p>sharon tate</p>
<p>who was eight</p>
<p>months pregnant</p>
<p>and her movie director husband</p>
<p>roman polanski</p>
<p>were renting</p>
<p>terry melcher&rsquo;s home talk about</p>
<p>wrong place</p>
<p>wrong damn time</p>
<p>now on this night</p>
<p>roman was in the uk</p>
<p>and sharon was at home with her friends</p>
<p>having like a little get together just hanging out</p>
<p>along with sharon</p>
<p>was her ex boyfriend</p>
<p>or fiance and</p>
<p>friend hair stylist</p>
<p>jay sebring</p>
<p>iconic hair stylist</p>
<p>also coffee heiress abigail</p>
<p>fulcher was there</p>
<p>yeah folgers in your cup queen yeah</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s there abigail&rsquo;s boyfriend was also there</p>
<p>wojciek frikowski</p>
<p>he was there too</p>
<p>there was also a man</p>
<p>named steven parent who was</p>
<p>visiting the home taking care of the property</p>
<p>so the family members texts cat</p>
<p>linda and susan</p>
<p>get into the car and they</p>
<p>drive out to the home charles</p>
<p>tells them to do</p>
<p>everything that text says but</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t tell them like what it is they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>except for tex he&rsquo;s the only one that knows when they</p>
<p>arrived late at night</p>
<p>tex went onto the property first</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he</p>
<p>came across steven parent who was like</p>
<p>literally in his car like it looked like he was</p>
<p>just put the keys in</p>
<p>something because he was</p>
<p>about to leave and go home</p>
<p>poor steven he was shot</p>
<p>by text four times</p>
<p>so then after that text</p>
<p>goes back to the car and told the girls like come on</p>
<p>come with me we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going inside now text</p>
<p>was able to get into the</p>
<p>house through an unlocked door</p>
<p>and let the others in</p>
<p>and then in the living room</p>
<p>tex was trying to deal with jay</p>
<p>sebring who he came across</p>
<p>first and he had him on the</p>
<p>floor he was trying to tie him up tex asked</p>
<p>susan to go and</p>
<p>check the back rooms and like</p>
<p>bring everyone</p>
<p>into the living room</p>
<p>so tex and jay are in the living room and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>fight because jay is trying to run away escape but</p>
<p>sadly tex shot him and killed him</p>
<p>it was said that</p>
<p>hex was the one who killed most that night</p>
<p>but like they all participated in</p>
<p>their own ways</p>
<p>it was just a really gruesome</p>
<p>scene there was</p>
<p>blood everywhere</p>
<p>everyone was brutally murdered</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>horrifying then in sharon</p>
<p>tate&rsquo;s blood there was the word</p>
<p>pig written on the front door</p>
<p>they were trying to tie it back to the previous murder</p>
<p>in total the</p>
<p>victims had been</p>
<p>stabbed a hundred</p>
<p>and two times</p>
<p>and they had gunshot</p>
<p>wounds so it was like a little much like they&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>we get it now many believe that</p>
<p>this was some kind of satanic ritual type of killing</p>
<p>and when the</p>
<p>media got a hold of it</p>
<p>it was a massive</p>
<p>story hollywood</p>
<p>was terrified celebrities were</p>
<p>thinking that like someone was gonna come</p>
<p>to them and kill them next</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed charlie had the family members</p>
<p>involved in the tape murders to prevent</p>
<p>them from talking to police</p>
<p>about the bernard and gary</p>
<p>murder cause now</p>
<p>their hands were dirty too</p>
<p>so they were hoping that back at the</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>the police would be making the connection</p>
<p>between the two murders</p>
<p>unfortunately the police</p>
<p>never made that connection</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t connect the twos so</p>
<p>great plan worked</p>
<p>great so the next night</p>
<p>another murder was in the works</p>
<p>this time it</p>
<p>would be at the home of a grocery company</p>
<p>executive named</p>
<p>leno and his wife rosemary la bianca</p>
<p>now this was</p>
<p>being like a very different section of los angeles</p>
<p>this night though</p>
<p>leslie van houten</p>
<p>she went along to</p>
<p>prove her loyalty to charlie and the family</p>
<p>she said that before</p>
<p>going she knew people were</p>
<p>gonna die but she</p>
<p>wanted to prove herself charlie</p>
<p>leslie pat tex</p>
<p>linda and susan all</p>
<p>cramped into a car</p>
<p>and they drove around for a</p>
<p>while before they stopped at the</p>
<p>house that they were</p>
<p>gonna hit next</p>
<p>charles went in</p>
<p>first and tied up the la</p>
<p>biancas then he left</p>
<p>so the rest of the gang they came in</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re struggling</p>
<p>with the law biancas the two girls were</p>
<p>going to kill</p>
<p>the law biancas but i</p>
<p>think they chickened out</p>
<p>and they asked</p>
<p>tex to come in kill them</p>
<p>killed the husband and wife</p>
<p>and then the girls took the knives and</p>
<p>stabbed them and like cut them up and carved in</p>
<p>their body because</p>
<p>texas said that they needed to do something</p>
<p>again it was a pretty brutal and</p>
<p>awful scene</p>
<p>anything bad you can imagine that was it okay</p>
<p>that was the scene</p>
<p>it was not nice</p>
<p>the lapiancas had been</p>
<p>stabbed a total of 67 times once</p>
<p>again they used their</p>
<p>blood and they wrote</p>
<p>death to pigs rise</p>
<p>and helter skelter</p>
<p>on the walls and the fridge</p>
<p>helter skelter</p>
<p>which they spelled wrong</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>great was referencing the beatles song</p>
<p>helter skelter</p>
<p>from the white</p>
<p>album the only</p>
<p>thing that they were allowed to listen to on</p>
<p>spawn ranch</p>
<p>charles believed the</p>
<p>music and cited a race war</p>
<p>and murder because the beatles were huge</p>
<p>they thought that</p>
<p>investigators</p>
<p>would make this connection</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>are trying to make it look like a copycat murder</p>
<p>so they wrote in the</p>
<p>blood again</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll connect it with the sharon</p>
<p>tate once sharon</p>
<p>tate connects to the gary once</p>
<p>gary one leads back</p>
<p>to the drug dealer</p>
<p>so it was said that the reason they killed</p>
<p>again was because they didn&rsquo;t realize that the</p>
<p>tate murders were</p>
<p>going to become so big</p>
<p>cause it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to</p>
<p>it was just supposed to be</p>
<p>terry melcher there</p>
<p>but it was all over the news</p>
<p>and everybody was talking</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t the plan</p>
<p>so they needed to hit</p>
<p>again the reason that charlie picked the la</p>
<p>bianca&rsquo;s home because it may seem</p>
<p>super random</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>random not at all</p>
<p>like mentioned</p>
<p>earlier charlie</p>
<p>he held a grudge and he</p>
<p>never forgot when you did him</p>
<p>wrong the law biancas they</p>
<p>lived next door to a guy</p>
<p>named harold true</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need to know him but he was there harold</p>
<p>was a friend to charlie and the family</p>
<p>they actually stayed at harold&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house for a bit of time the family</p>
<p>again they like moved in</p>
<p>to harold&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re living there for</p>
<p>some time but i</p>
<p>guess they were causing a bit of a ruckus</p>
<p>and the neighbors called the cops</p>
<p>which led to charlie and the family having to move out</p>
<p>who were the neighbors</p>
<p>the lobbyangas of course</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he decided to kill them that</p>
<p>night because he remembered that</p>
<p>and because they</p>
<p>needed another copycat murder also charlie remembered</p>
<p>that the law biancas liked gamble and had lots of</p>
<p>money money</p>
<p>that he needed to pay back the straight satans</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s his plan</p>
<p>so over the years charlie had said that like he was</p>
<p>never there at the lot biancas</p>
<p>in interviews</p>
<p>and what not but everyone said he was the one who</p>
<p>drove to the lot bianca</p>
<p>house and that</p>
<p>he went in for a bit for a period of time well inside</p>
<p>after tying the lot biancas up charlie</p>
<p>went and grabbed</p>
<p>rosemary la bianca&rsquo;s wallet</p>
<p>then waited</p>
<p>for the gang back in the car</p>
<p>once the murders were complete</p>
<p>charlie then took them to a</p>
<p>house in venice</p>
<p>beach which was</p>
<p>right next to the straight</p>
<p>satan&rsquo;s clubhouse</p>
<p>mind you it was like 4 am</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s many speculation as to why they went there</p>
<p>some say it was to</p>
<p>commit another murder but many believe it was actually</p>
<p>because charlie went there to give the straight</p>
<p>satans the money</p>
<p>owed and regain</p>
<p>their protection over</p>
<p>spawn ranch</p>
<p>which makes</p>
<p>sense because he just got the</p>
<p>money from the la biancas</p>
<p>back at spawn</p>
<p>ranch there was a ranch hand</p>
<p>named donald shay</p>
<p>who was a hollywood</p>
<p>stuntman actor</p>
<p>but also helped out around</p>
<p>ranch now he didn&rsquo;t like the family</p>
<p>he thought they were trying</p>
<p>or they were taking advantage of the</p>
<p>old man who owned it and on august 16th 1969 26 members</p>
<p>of the family were arrested on suspicion of auto theft</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t last long though</p>
<p>due to like some</p>
<p>paperwork errors they were all released by</p>
<p>but because of this</p>
<p>charlie thought that the</p>
<p>ranch hand donald</p>
<p>tipped them off to police</p>
<p>and when they got back to the ranch</p>
<p>donald shay</p>
<p>was never seen</p>
<p>again just vanished poof</p>
<p>gone so now that they&rsquo;re on police&rsquo;s</p>
<p>radar they wanted somewhere else to live and the</p>
<p>group ends up moving to barker ranch in</p>
<p>death valley</p>
<p>which was like an old mining property</p>
<p>that was pretty cut off from the world so</p>
<p>they were there for a bit</p>
<p>then on october</p>
<p>12 1969 officers</p>
<p>raided the barker</p>
<p>ranch on suspicion of auto theft again</p>
<p>24 members were arrested this time</p>
<p>now they didn&rsquo;t even know that</p>
<p>these people were involved with the murders</p>
<p>going on they were just there you know auto theft</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re arrested</p>
<p>auto theft let&rsquo;s go now this time though</p>
<p>while in jail one of the family members</p>
<p>susan atkins</p>
<p>she blabbed</p>
<p>she told her cellmates that she</p>
<p>and the family were involved with the murder of sharon</p>
<p>tate i don&rsquo;t know why i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>whispering but i am</p>
<p>she was kind of bragging</p>
<p>about it like oh you&rsquo;re looking at her</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m the one who was involved</p>
<p>based off interviews</p>
<p>with the cellmate</p>
<p>yes i like went down a</p>
<p>rabbit hole anyways</p>
<p>the cellmate</p>
<p>tells investigators this information because</p>
<p>hello i want a lesser sentence</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna rat on you</p>
<p>which they did and this my friends is</p>
<p>where it all just falls</p>
<p>apart goodbye</p>
<p>december 1969</p>
<p>four months</p>
<p>after the crimes</p>
<p>a lot of things happened in between here</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like nothing</p>
<p>but really makes a difference it&rsquo;s just bullshit</p>
<p>charles manson</p>
<p>and five members were being</p>
<p>charged with the</p>
<p>tate and la bianca murders</p>
<p>on june 15th 1970</p>
<p>the trial starts</p>
<p>charles charlie</p>
<p>mr manson he</p>
<p>asked for a</p>
<p>permission to</p>
<p>serve as his own attorney</p>
<p>but he was denied</p>
<p>they should have let him</p>
<p>know they shouldn&rsquo;t have he was denied</p>
<p>susan atkins gave a testimony and described in</p>
<p>great detail what happened the</p>
<p>night of the</p>
<p>tate murders</p>
<p>she had like little to no emotion</p>
<p>and showed not a lot of remorse</p>
<p>it was very awkward</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want to use her as a witness</p>
<p>because they thought it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t help the helter skelter</p>
<p>story that prosecutors were</p>
<p>going to focus on</p>
<p>which we will get into</p>
<p>so they ended up not</p>
<p>using her they&rsquo;re like you&rsquo;re a bad look</p>
<p>get out of here</p>
<p>now the main problem was that charles</p>
<p>manson was not at the murder</p>
<p>scene during the</p>
<p>tate murders</p>
<p>and did not participate</p>
<p>in the law bianca murders</p>
<p>so they had</p>
<p>to get him with circumstantial evidence and by the law</p>
<p>of conspiracy</p>
<p>i know confusing</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>proof that he did a damn thing</p>
<p>so prosecutors had to get creative</p>
<p>and come up with a</p>
<p>storyline that</p>
<p>would convict</p>
<p>charles manson</p>
<p>now hollywood was going</p>
<p>crazy over this</p>
<p>trial and day</p>
<p>after day charlie</p>
<p>would come into</p>
<p>court all of this was like being filmed for tv</p>
<p>news and just he</p>
<p>would just spew</p>
<p>some wild shit</p>
<p>he was playing to the courtroom</p>
<p>he knew it was a</p>
<p>circus and he was feeding into it</p>
<p>charlie would have like constant</p>
<p>stare offs with the camera because he knew that people</p>
<p>would be like oh my god what a</p>
<p>freaking weirdo</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would also do it to the jury members</p>
<p>he would just stare at the jury</p>
<p>and they just made them feel extremely</p>
<p>uncomfortable</p>
<p>he was just</p>
<p>aggressive intimidating</p>
<p>and very strange</p>
<p>but the media was loving it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like oh this is just bizarre</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in so</p>
<p>every day charles</p>
<p>manson and the</p>
<p>three girls</p>
<p>they would meet</p>
<p>and they would discuss like what they were</p>
<p>gonna do in</p>
<p>court that day</p>
<p>for example one day he wanted them all to</p>
<p>stand up and hold hands and some</p>
<p>symbols another day he wanted them to get up and scream</p>
<p>or he wanted</p>
<p>them to sing his songs when they were walking into</p>
<p>court it is creepy it is</p>
<p>weird and i</p>
<p>think he just</p>
<p>loved that it was just a</p>
<p>weird performance that nobody asked for</p>
<p>so the rest of the manson family members</p>
<p>were banned from</p>
<p>court proceedings for disrupting the</p>
<p>court so they</p>
<p>moved out to the hallways</p>
<p>and they also kept a vigil</p>
<p>outside to show</p>
<p>their support charles</p>
<p>carved an ex</p>
<p>into his forehead at one</p>
<p>point to symbolize his removal</p>
<p>from society</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>three girls did the same as well</p>
<p>eventually down the line he turned that x into a</p>
<p>swastika so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great seems like a real hoot</p>
<p>a guy wow so</p>
<p>again tv news went wild everyone went wild</p>
<p>girls gone wild it was just all wild</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s where the helter skelter</p>
<p>story came into play</p>
<p>and is what charles manson is really remembered by</p>
<p>nowadays they go hand in hand</p>
<p>the prosecutor</p>
<p>his name was</p>
<p>vincent bugle oski</p>
<p>whatever the hell now vincent was said to be a very</p>
<p>great prosecutor</p>
<p>he was a known</p>
<p>womanizer and he</p>
<p>loved attention</p>
<p>he brought in another guy with him</p>
<p>during the court proceedings who</p>
<p>everyone thought was like his assistant or extra help</p>
<p>but really the guy was there to help vincent</p>
<p>write a book</p>
<p>on the case</p>
<p>which he didn&rsquo;t mention to anyone</p>
<p>until after the fact</p>
<p>so he brings in the sky this guy is taking notes</p>
<p>gonna help him</p>
<p>write a book</p>
<p>the helter skelter</p>
<p>story that was presented in</p>
<p>court was that charles manson</p>
<p>formed a cult</p>
<p>filled with</p>
<p>people who didn&rsquo;t want to be a part of society</p>
<p>okay facts charles</p>
<p>wanted to be a rock star</p>
<p>he was obsessed with the beatles</p>
<p>the beach boys</p>
<p>through the</p>
<p>beach boys is how he came to meet</p>
<p>terry melcher</p>
<p>who stole his</p>
<p>music and represented the establishment</p>
<p>to charlie charlie</p>
<p>hated the establishment</p>
<p>he believed that the beatles</p>
<p>were predicting a race war through hidden messages</p>
<p>in their songs</p>
<p>and he needed to prepare</p>
<p>for this race war charles</p>
<p>brainwashed</p>
<p>his members in believing that there was a race war</p>
<p>about to take place</p>
<p>order them to kill gary</p>
<p>hindman then</p>
<p>order them to kill</p>
<p>white people and frame</p>
<p>black people by telling his followers to kill whoever</p>
<p>lived at terry&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>then charles picked another house at</p>
<p>random to attack</p>
<p>the la biancas and</p>
<p>ordered everyone to be killed</p>
<p>the plot was to frame</p>
<p>black people</p>
<p>by having his followers</p>
<p>leave messages</p>
<p>and lines from the beatles</p>
<p>white album at the</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>this would then lead to a race war</p>
<p>once the race war</p>
<p>started charles and his family</p>
<p>would hide in the desert</p>
<p>until it was over</p>
<p>charles would come out of hiding</p>
<p>and become leader of the</p>
<p>black army and rebuild the</p>
<p>world this is</p>
<p>in summary is the</p>
<p>story that convicted</p>
<p>charles and gained vincent</p>
<p>fame and fortune</p>
<p>for selling his best selling book</p>
<p>helter skelter but we&rsquo;ll get into that too this whole</p>
<p>story was created</p>
<p>which i think there are bits and</p>
<p>pieces correct in there like charles manson</p>
<p>do not be mistaken he was</p>
<p>super freaking racist</p>
<p>disturbed man</p>
<p>this reason</p>
<p>as to why charles manson committed</p>
<p>these crimes made for a shocking</p>
<p>story but most of all</p>
<p>it set charles up</p>
<p>for first degree murder</p>
<p>and conspiracy</p>
<p>under california law</p>
<p>without the helter skelter storyline</p>
<p>there was no evidence that charles wanted to make</p>
<p>these murders happen or even</p>
<p>participated in them</p>
<p>so the only way to get him convicted</p>
<p>was by enhancing</p>
<p>what happened charlie&rsquo;s plan to</p>
<p>start a race war</p>
<p>would make him responsible</p>
<p>for all crimes committed</p>
<p>if the prosecution mentioned to the court</p>
<p>the auto thefts the drugs</p>
<p>shit the bernard</p>
<p>killing then the helter skelter</p>
<p>story or whatever it just</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense so they didn&rsquo;t even introduce</p>
<p>any of that they didn&rsquo;t even try to explain the</p>
<p>whole gary killing either</p>
<p>it really didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because how does that fit in with the doomsday</p>
<p>cult mentality it didn&rsquo;t which</p>
<p>in court could lead</p>
<p>to reasonable</p>
<p>doubt possibly leaving jars to think hmm</p>
<p>maybe it had to do with a drug deal gone bad</p>
<p>and not a cult</p>
<p>maybe charlie technically didn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>and the prosecution did not want that</p>
<p>their job was to get charlie arrested</p>
<p>plus he is a danger to society so they needed to</p>
<p>like how do we make sure he gets locked up</p>
<p>so this whole</p>
<p>story just blew up</p>
<p>everybody was talking</p>
<p>about helter skelter</p>
<p>how terrifying it all was</p>
<p>and then that became the</p>
<p>story that really</p>
<p>defined this</p>
<p>whole everything</p>
<p>charles manson</p>
<p>and many believe that it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t even true the</p>
<p>court hearings were a hot mess</p>
<p>just gonna glaze over it they were a hot mess</p>
<p>in the end though</p>
<p>on march twenty</p>
<p>ninth charlie was</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>seven counts of</p>
<p>first degree murder and one</p>
<p>count of conspiracy to commit murder for the</p>
<p>deaths of abigail</p>
<p>void check steve sharon jay</p>
<p>leno and his wife</p>
<p>rosemary guilty</p>
<p>goodbye pat</p>
<p>leslie and susan</p>
<p>they were also</p>
<p>charged with murder</p>
<p>and the jury had called for the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>for all four</p>
<p>defendants the</p>
<p>three girls</p>
<p>were like i&rsquo;m not trying to say that there wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>brainwashing</p>
<p>happening in a cult</p>
<p>mentality charlie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>followers were like ride or die for him</p>
<p>these girls were like</p>
<p>loyal to him they were like he is</p>
<p>everything to us</p>
<p>and they just did</p>
<p>everything that he said</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t want that to get lost because i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s very true</p>
<p>so they go to prison</p>
<p>goodbye now in 1972 the supreme</p>
<p>court overturned the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>so sentences</p>
<p>were turned into</p>
<p>life imprisonment charlie said at the end of the trial</p>
<p>all they really accomplished was sending him</p>
<p>right back to</p>
<p>where he started</p>
<p>and he really wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wrong there now</p>
<p>throughout the years most of them have done interviews</p>
<p>behind prison</p>
<p>walls or whatever</p>
<p>where they have showed</p>
<p>remorse for what they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>except for that one girl she was like really</p>
<p>weird who was it</p>
<p>susan i think it was susan</p>
<p>i think as they got older</p>
<p>they just kind of came to</p>
<p>their senses</p>
<p>not so much charlie though he</p>
<p>never never</p>
<p>owned up to his part</p>
<p>in the choices that they made</p>
<p>he would say over and over</p>
<p>again until his</p>
<p>dying day that he</p>
<p>never told them</p>
<p>what to do that they made</p>
<p>their choices on</p>
<p>their own and he had nothing to do with any of it and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s why charles manson remains so infamous</p>
<p>because he never actually did anything</p>
<p>he got these</p>
<p>other people to commit the</p>
<p>crimes for him he</p>
<p>never got his hands</p>
<p>dirty but he did</p>
<p>shoot the bernard guy so he did technically</p>
<p>sorry also the</p>
<p>whole like helter skelter</p>
<p>doomsday cult story</p>
<p>added to it people just love cults</p>
<p>and so it just</p>
<p>took him to this iconic infamous</p>
<p>being i guess</p>
<p>in 1974 vincent</p>
<p>booglo glowy</p>
<p>the prosecutor</p>
<p>well he was now an</p>
<p>author because he released his book helter skelter</p>
<p>which was based off of the manson case</p>
<p>and it became the best</p>
<p>selling true</p>
<p>crime book in his</p>
<p>story history</p>
<p>selling over</p>
<p>seven million</p>
<p>copies so it brought him</p>
<p>great success</p>
<p>vincent was just writing</p>
<p>the wave a lot more</p>
<p>things happened but this</p>
<p>video is already</p>
<p>super long so yeah</p>
<p>but everyone remained and some</p>
<p>still to this day</p>
<p>remain in prison</p>
<p>leslie van houten she was sentenced to life in prison</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s 68 now and she&rsquo;s been denied parole</p>
<p>numerous times</p>
<p>susan atkins died in prison of</p>
<p>brain cancer</p>
<p>in 2009 pat</p>
<p>krenwinkle is now 73</p>
<p>and still in prison</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been denied parole numerous times as well</p>
<p>tex watson tex was like</p>
<p>the most fucked up out of all of them okay like he was</p>
<p>really crazy</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s 75 now</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s still in prison he&rsquo;s been denied</p>
<p>parole numerous times as well</p>
<p>but he has become a born</p>
<p>again christian</p>
<p>and runs a christian outreach site from prison</p>
<p>linda kasabian</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t really talk</p>
<p>about her that much but she was involved i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming that she came from</p>
<p>money because she got a good attorney</p>
<p>okay she was</p>
<p>charged with nothing</p>
<p>she was there the</p>
<p>night of the</p>
<p>tate murders</p>
<p>as the lookout</p>
<p>and she also helped like clean</p>
<p>and dispose</p>
<p>of the weapons and whatnot</p>
<p>but she was</p>
<p>charged with nothing because she</p>
<p>was considered a star witness for the prosecutor&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>against charles manson she told them</p>
<p>everything they wanted</p>
<p>and then afterward she disappeared</p>
<p>changed her name she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>bye linda sent</p>
<p>a couple of interviews</p>
<p>since this whole thing like</p>
<p>later in life</p>
<p>and you can</p>
<p>find them on youtube and her face is always like</p>
<p>blacked out</p>
<p>cause she doesn&rsquo;t want anyone know what she looks like</p>
<p>she kind of has meth face</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not me trying to be a dick</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>blame her for doing meth</p>
<p>like come on just tell your truth</p>
<p>been a hundred years</p>
<p>bobby remember bobby</p>
<p>in the very beginning he killed gary heinman</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s 71 now</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s still in prison</p>
<p>yeah he was convicted for murder for</p>
<p>killing gary so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still in prison</p>
<p>another family member</p>
<p>steve grogan</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about him but he was</p>
<p>charged for the murder of donald</p>
<p>shay the spawn</p>
<p>ranch hand that went missing yeah well</p>
<p>steve was charged</p>
<p>but steve was</p>
<p>granted parole</p>
<p>after serving 15 years</p>
<p>for donald&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>he was allowed his freedom</p>
<p>after telling authorities</p>
<p>where donald&rsquo;s body had been disposed</p>
<p>lucky him i</p>
<p>guess you know charles manson remained behind bars</p>
<p>until the age of 83</p>
<p>and then he died on november 19th</p>
<p>2017 in prison</p>
<p>oh my god not long</p>
<p>after his birthday</p>
<p>like a full circle</p>
<p>but he had a</p>
<p>heart attack or something</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>he needed to go</p>
<p>goodbye he was just ugh</p>
<p>exhausting i</p>
<p>watched so many interviews with</p>
<p>this dude he just talks in circles but people find him</p>
<p>absolutely fascinating</p>
<p>he says nothing really</p>
<p>he just talks</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore</p>
<p>charles manson wasn&rsquo;t a god or</p>
<p>jesus like figure he was just an</p>
<p>odd little man who was abandoned by his parents</p>
<p>who wanted attention and validation</p>
<p>and was just filled with hate and did terrible things</p>
<p>charles manson</p>
<p>has so many fangirls and guys</p>
<p>or did i mean people love the guy</p>
<p>and they believe that</p>
<p>he was 100 innocent and didn&rsquo;t need to be in prison</p>
<p>but what i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think these</p>
<p>morons realize</p>
<p>is that maybe he wanted to be in prison</p>
<p>maybe it was his home</p>
<p>i mean look what happens when he&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>nothing good like they were</p>
<p>fighting so hard for him to be proven innocent</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like babe babe</p>
<p>no we don&rsquo;t need that no there</p>
<p>are so many people out there who idolize this guy i</p>
<p>i just will</p>
<p>never understand it&rsquo;s so bizarre</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve said this before and i will say it</p>
<p>again get better</p>
<p>idols there are so many</p>
<p>great people out there who have done amazing</p>
<p>things why idolize someone who&rsquo;s just fucking</p>
<p>weird with a</p>
<p>swastika on</p>
<p>their forehead you fucking morons</p>
<p>i think it is fair to say</p>
<p>that charles manson had a very difficult life</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s dead the end</p>
<p>that is the</p>
<p>story about charles manson</p>
<p>i told the other version</p>
<p>drug deal gone bad</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of people and a lot of stories and versions</p>
<p>about the elders</p>
<p>skelter were in</p>
<p>it involves the doomsday cult</p>
<p>after this week of binge</p>
<p>watching freaking</p>
<p>everything that</p>
<p>had to do with charles i just personally believe that</p>
<p>the doomsday</p>
<p>cult wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>thing i think it was just a drug deal gone bad</p>
<p>either way they needed something</p>
<p>to prosecute him on and they had to create some kind of</p>
<p>story to get them</p>
<p>because if they didn&rsquo;t then he</p>
<p>would have been out</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>if they did do that is that morally</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just someone on youtube in a box</p>
<p>anyways it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still all sad though because they were like really</p>
<p>murdered like really</p>
<p>really murdered</p>
<p>if you made it all the way to the end</p>
<p>congratulations i love you and</p>
<p>appreciate you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the best wow you&rsquo;re my best friend</p>
<p>i hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day my</p>
<p>voice hurts</p>
<p>i think i lost it let me know your thoughts down</p>
<p>below and who you want me to talk</p>
<p>about next week but</p>
<p>other than that</p>
<p>i hope you have</p>
<p>a wonderful rest of your day you make choices bye</p>
<p>you</p>
