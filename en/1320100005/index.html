Hi, happy Friday, everyone. I was at a friend&amp;rsquo;s house for lunch earlier with a bunch of very,
very joyous Argentinians after Lionel Messi and company survived one of the wildest games of the
World Cup in a penalty shootout that I hope some of you caught. It was really amazing and exciting
to watch. But now, of course, it is getting late.'>

    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Connie Loizos, and this is Alex Gove, and this is Strictly VC Download.</p>
<p>Hi, happy Friday, everyone. I was at a friend&rsquo;s house for lunch earlier with a bunch of very,</p>
<p>very joyous Argentinians after Lionel Messi and company survived one of the wildest games of the</p>
<p>World Cup in a penalty shootout that I hope some of you caught. It was really amazing and exciting</p>
<p>to watch. But now, of course, it is getting late. So we are going to head straight into a couple of</p>
<p>quick news hits, including a segment about OpenAI, the AI company headed by Sam Altman,</p>
<p>and why an economist and VC who I&rsquo;ve known for years, Paul Kedrowski, is very upset with the</p>
<p>company. For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;m excited to be sitting down with Altman next month in San</p>
<p>Francisco to talk about the company at our first Strictly VC event of the year. We last sat down</p>
<p>together three years ago, and candidly, the interview has not aged well. Much of what Altman</p>
<p>had to say at the time was just unimaginable to me, and I don&rsquo;t think I took him entirely</p>
<p>seriously. And now, of course, much of what he said was around the corner is, in fact,</p>
<p>seeping into our society very much in real time. So we&rsquo;re going to be talking about the</p>
<p>implications of the tech that his company has released to the general public and where we</p>
<p>go from here. But like I said, first, some other news.</p>
<p>FDX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been talking the ears off of journalists.</p>
<p>But up until now, he has avoided speaking to congressional investigators. That has changed.</p>
<p>Today, Bankman-Fried tweeted that he would appear before the House Committee on Financial Services</p>
<p>this coming Tuesday. SBF will presumably be under oath, so it&rsquo;s probably a good thing that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hired a high-profile lawyer to represent him. This same advocate recently represented</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s partner in pedophilia.</p>
<p>Still, Bankman-Fried will have a lot of splainin&rsquo; to do. The former crypto wunderkind will inevitably</p>
<p>be asked whether he transferred customer deposits to Alameda Research, a hedge fund that he</p>
<p>controlled. FDX&rsquo;s new CEO John J. Ray III, a man who has been hired to clean up the mess at FDX,</p>
<p>has stated that SBF used, quote, special software to conceal the misuse of customer funds.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried has denied this allegation. It would also not be unreasonable to think</p>
<p>that SBF will face questioning about the $1 billion that he borrowed from Alameda,</p>
<p>as well as the $2.3 billion that an Alameda affiliate loaned Paper Bird,</p>
<p>another company that he controlled. And he will surely face questioning about the money</p>
<p>he put to work with both the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as news organizations,</p>
<p>such as the crypto news publication The Block, which, according to a report in today&rsquo;s Axios,</p>
<p>received some $43 million in loans from Alameda. Was this all part of a cynical and manipulative</p>
<p>game that the former billionaire was playing as he intubated to a Vox reporter in a series</p>
<p>of late-night DMs? For what it&rsquo;s worth, if the House Committee is open to suggestions,</p>
<p>I would like to know more about the signal conversations that SBF had with Binance CEO</p>
<p>Changpeng Cixi Zhao in the days leading up to FDX&rsquo;s bankruptcy, and what they reveal about</p>
<p>the state of the cryptocurrency market. In a fascinating article in Today&rsquo;s Times,</p>
<p>reporters David Yoffe-Bellany and Emily Flitter write about one such conversation in which Cixi</p>
<p>accuses Bankman-Fried of trying to tank Tether, a USD stablecoin, with a $250,000 trade. SBF</p>
<p>retorts that there is no way such a small trade could ever undermine Tether, but the fact that</p>
<p>Zhao was so concerned about Tether&rsquo;s stability does not speak well for stablecoins or the crypto</p>
<p>industry in general. So, we will be watching on Tuesday and looking to see in particular if</p>
<p>committee members will be able to poke any holes in SBF&rsquo;s defense, namely that he was a terrible</p>
<p>CEO and lost sight of FDX&rsquo;s risk exposure. One thing is certain though, whatever SBF&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lawyer is getting paid, it&rsquo;s not enough. Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission</p>
<p>announced that it would seek to block Microsoft&rsquo;s $69 billion acquisition of Activision, the video</p>
<p>game behemoth behind Call of Duty, a franchise that has generated almost $30 billion in revenue</p>
<p>from game sales and microtransactions since 2003. It&rsquo;s a curious development for two very</p>
<p>different reasons. First, according to a story in today&rsquo;s Wall Street Journal, Microsoft has</p>
<p>been engaged in a charm offensive with every regulator that will sit down with it, an effort</p>
<p>led by its vice chairman and president, Brad Smith, who joined the company back in 1993.</p>
<p>To allay regulators&rsquo; concerns, Microsoft has made many promises, the most important of which</p>
<p>is that Call of Duty will be available on other platforms, such as Sony PlayStation.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more important reason that the FDC&rsquo;s move came as a surprise is that courts have been</p>
<p>skeptical of challenges to so-called vertical mergers, or mergers in which two businesses</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t compete directly. Although the landmark Paramount case famously barred vertical</p>
<p>integration in the movie business, in which studios tried to control the production,</p>
<p>distribution, and exhibition of feature films, the justice system has looked the other way when</p>
<p>it comes to other vertical mergers. One famous, albeit dated, example is the AT&amp;T-Time Warner</p>
<p>merger, which was ultimately allowed. Given how many concessions Microsoft has made to help this</p>
<p>deal go through, Daniel Francis, an assistant professor of law at New York University and a</p>
<p>former FTC official, thinks the FTC may have overplayed its hand. Courts have been surprisingly</p>
<p>solicitous about the kinds of things that Microsoft has offered here, he told the New York Times.</p>
<p>The Times also notes that the FTC&rsquo;s leader, Lena Khan, has been very aggressive in pursuing novel</p>
<p>or little-used arguments to challenge deals. Still, any parent of a 13-year-old strictly VC</p>
<p>intern who plays NBA 2K can tell you that Xbox and PlayStation don&rsquo;t always play well together,</p>
<p>especially when it comes to fast-twitch games like Call of Duty. No matter how much Microsoft</p>
<p>protests that Call of Duty will not tilt the scales in its favor, we can definitely see why</p>
<p>regulators and Sony are so concerned. Up next, Connie&rsquo;s interview with economist,</p>
<p>VC, and MIT fellow, Paul Kodrowski, about OpenAI. But first, a word from our sponsor.</p>

<p>More than three years ago, I sat down with Sam Altman for a small event in San Francisco</p>
<p>soon after he left his role as the president of Y Combinator to be the CEO of the AI company</p>
<p>he co-founded in 2015 with Elon Musk and others called OpenAI. At the time, Altman described</p>
<p>OpenAI&rsquo;s potential in language that sounded outlandish to some. Here is part of our conversation</p>
<p>about OpenAI&rsquo;s revenue model, or lack thereof, at the time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just wondering, like, eventually, is the idea to kind of like</p>
<p>kind of like license technologies? Will you have customers? You&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>customizing algorithms for them? Or how is it going to work?</p>
<p>You know, the honest answer is we have no idea. We, we have never made any revenue.</p>
<p>We have no current plans to make revenue. We have no idea how we may one day generate revenue.</p>
<p>We have made a soft promise to investors that once we&rsquo;ve built this sort of generally</p>
<p>intelligent system, basically, we will ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment</p>
<p>return for you. It sounds like an episode of Silicon Valley. It really does. I get it.</p>
<p>You can laugh. It&rsquo;s all right. But it is what I actually believe is going to happen.</p>
<p>And so it went. Altman said, for example, that the opportunity with artificial general</p>
<p>intelligence, which is machine intelligence that can solve problems as well as a human,</p>
<p>is so great that if OpenAI managed to crack it, the outfit could, quote,</p>
<p>maybe capture the light cone of all future value in the universe. He said the company was,</p>
<p>quote, going to have to not release research because it was so powerful.</p>
<p>Asked if OpenAI was guilty of fear mongering, Altman talked about the dangers of not thinking</p>
<p>through, quote, societal consequences when, quote, you&rsquo;re building something on an exponential curve.</p>
<p>The audience continued to laugh at various points of the conversation,</p>
<p>not certain how seriously to take Altman. No one is laughing now, however,</p>
<p>while machines are not yet as intelligent as people, the tech that OpenAI has since released</p>
<p>is taking many aback, including Musk, with some critics fearful that it could be our undoing,</p>
<p>especially with more sophisticated tech reportedly coming soon.</p>
<p>Indeed, though heavy users insist it&rsquo;s not so smart, the chat GPT model that OpenAI made</p>
<p>available to the general public last week is so capable of answering questions like a person</p>
<p>that professionals across a range of industries are trying to process the implications.</p>
<p>Educators, for example, wonder how they&rsquo;ll be able to distinguish original writing from the</p>
<p>algorithmically generated essays they are bound to receive, and that can evade anti-plagiarism</p>
<p>software. Paul Kedrowski isn&rsquo;t an educator per se. He&rsquo;s an economist, venture capitalist,</p>
<p>and MIT fellow who calls himself a, quote, frustrated normal with a penchant for thinking</p>
<p>about risks and unintended consequences in complex systems. But Kedrowski is among those</p>
<p>who are suddenly worried about our collective future, tweeting yesterday, shame on OpenAI</p>
<p>for launching this pocket nuclear bomb without restrictions into an unprepared society.</p>
<p>Kedrowski continued, I obviously feel chat GPT and its ilk should be withdrawn immediately,</p>
<p>and if ever reintroduced, only with tight restrictions.</p>
<p>We talked with Kedrowski yesterday about some of his concerns and why he thinks OpenAI is driving</p>
<p>what he believes is the, quote, most disruptive change the U.S. economy has seen in 100 years.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Kedrowski in his own words.</p>
<p>I had looked at it early on, and I&rsquo;ve played with these chat UIs, conversational</p>
<p>user interfaces, whatever you want to call them, into services like this in the past,</p>
<p>and obviously this is a huge leap beyond. And what troubled me here in particular,</p>
<p>though, is I want to have better words. I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s the casual brutality of it,</p>
<p>that this has, as you implied, massive consequences for a host of different activities,</p>
<p>not just the obvious ones like, I don&rsquo;t know, high school essay writing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But across pretty much any domain where there&rsquo;s a grammar, an organized way of expressing yourself,</p>
<p>so that could be software engineering, that can be high school essays,</p>
<p>that can be legal documents, where all of them are easily eaten by this sort of voracious beast.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And spit back out again without compensation to whatever was used for training it. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an input side of this, much like the problem we have in generative art, where the art was trained</p>
<p>on all of these images that were deemed to be in the public domain, and now all kinds of artists</p>
<p>are being put out of business because generative artificial intelligence products are generating</p>
<p>spectacularly impressive products that were all trained on other people&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Kedroski went on to say that people keep wanting to compare OpenAI&rsquo;s generative tech</p>
<p>to disruptive tech we&rsquo;ve seen before, but that there is no comparison.</p>
<p>To make an analogy here, some might say, well, did you feel the same way when automation arrived</p>
<p>in auto plants and autoworkers were put out of work? Because it&rsquo;s a broader phenomenon,</p>
<p>but you could make that analogy. And this is, of course, very different,</p>
<p>because the difference with respect to these specific learning technologies is they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>self-catalyzing. They&rsquo;re learning from the requests. So robots in a manufacturing plant,</p>
<p>while disruptive and have incredible economic consequences for the people working there,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t then turn around and start absorbing everything going inside the factory and then</p>
<p>moving across sector by sector, whereas that&rsquo;s exactly not only what we can expect,</p>
<p>but what we should expect.</p>
<p>I asked Kedroski how we rein in the type of tech that OpenAI is at the forefront of rolling out.</p>
<p>While Altman and Musk have themselves talked at length about the need for</p>
<p>safe artificial intelligence and guardrails, currently there are essentially none.</p>
<p>He said he could imagine a few things happening on this front.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to see things like, for example, in the same way that the FTC demanded that people</p>
<p>running blogs years ago and had affiliate links, they had to say, we have affiliate links,</p>
<p>I make money from this stuff. I think people are going to be forced to make disclosures that we</p>
<p>wrote none of this. This is all machine generated. So you&rsquo;re going to see at a trivial level,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see that kind of thing go on. I think you&rsquo;re also going to see</p>
<p>new energy for the ongoing lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI over copyright infringement</p>
<p>in the context of our in-training machine learning algorithms. There&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>broader DMCA issue here with respect to the service. And I think there&rsquo;s the potential for</p>
<p>like a 10x snapster size lawsuit and settlement eventually with respect to the consequences of</p>
<p>these services, which will probably take too long and not help enough people. But, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how we don&rsquo;t end up in a similar place with respect to these technologies.</p>
<p>Because Kedroski is a fellow at MIT, before I let him go, I asked him what some of the</p>
<p>other academics at the school think of OpenAI and its chat GPT.</p>
<p>Andy McAfee and his group over there, they&rsquo;re more sanguine. There&rsquo;s a more orthodox view</p>
<p>out there that anytime we see disruption, other opportunities get created. People are mobile,</p>
<p>they move from place to place and from occupation to occupation. And we shouldn&rsquo;t be so</p>
<p>hidebound that we think that this particular evolution of technology is the one around</p>
<p>which we can&rsquo;t mutate and migrate. And I think that&rsquo;s broadly true. But the lesson of the last</p>
<p>five years in particular has been these changes can take a long time. Free trade, for example,</p>
<p>is one of those incredibly disruptive economy-wide experiences. And we all told ourselves as</p>
<p>economists looking at this, that the economy will adapt and people in general will benefit from</p>
<p>lower prices. But what no one anticipated was that someone would organize all the angry people</p>
<p>and elect Donald Trump. So there&rsquo;s this idea that we can anticipate and predict how long that will</p>
<p>take and what the consequences will be in the middle and what gets burned down in the process</p>
<p>is, again, it&rsquo;s hubristic. It&rsquo;s wrong. We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, everybody. And special thanks to the Military Veteran Startup Conference</p>
<p>hosted by Context Ventures on February 2nd and 3rd. Remember to check out millvetstartups.com.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, and we&rsquo;ll see you here next week.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
