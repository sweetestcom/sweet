<p>bones just please type it in right now</p>
<p>okay and and then what we&rsquo;re gonna do is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go on to a caller for a</p>
<p>Denise Denise are you there yes I am but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I hear you echoing okay echoing what</p>
<p>was your question my questions on</p>
<p>fashion Moto&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve had it for quite a</p>
<p>while and I asked my doctor</p>
<p>can you can you cut that that was mine</p>
<p>oh you&rsquo;re good you&rsquo;re good that was mine</p>
<p>for some reason so you want to know</p>
<p>about how I asked her should help me</p>
<p>wean off the centroid and she said no</p>
<p>and all the journals I brought in she</p>
<p>will not do it I want to do it myself</p>
<p>okay so I&rsquo;m just gonna give you some</p>
<p>background to research okay ready for</p>
<p>this yeah okay</p>
<p>oh by the way did you happen to watch my</p>
<p>video that I released on hashimoto&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>think he was a day or two ago did you</p>
<p>see that one yet yeah okay so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically what I would apply because</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is when you have</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s you do have a buildup of</p>
<p>hydrogen peroxide which is very</p>
<p>destructive it&rsquo;s an oxidative thing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of if you&rsquo;ve ever put it on a wound</p>
<p>you see it just kind of fizzes up and it</p>
<p>oxidizes and it&rsquo;s doing that to your</p>
<p>same cells so you need more antioxidants</p>
<p>to clean it up and so one of the ones</p>
<p>that we recommend is and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>long word it&rsquo;s s acetyl l al and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a couple other ones too like zinc and</p>
<p>selenium and it&rsquo;s right in that video if</p>
<p>you watch this video I actually lay it</p>
<p>out for you that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know exactly what&rsquo;s causing this</p>
<p>but what we do know is we want to clean</p>
<p>up the hydrogen peroxide in the area we</p>
<p>want to actually build up do you immune</p>
<p>system because Hashimoto&rsquo;s is an</p>
<p>autoimmune it&rsquo;s an immune problem more</p>
<p>than a thyroid problem so and a lot of</p>
<p>times there&rsquo;s always a trigger of stress</p>
<p>but behind that and so anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>connected to that would be very very</p>
<p>beneficial so watch the video i would</p>
<p>recommend to research those supplements</p>
<p>and then i think you&rsquo;re gonna do well</p>
<p>now one of the big symptoms of</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s is fatigue so make sure that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking b1 and that should</p>
<p>instantly make you feel better because</p>
<p>the need for b1 goes up as you have</p>
<p>autoimmune conditions</p>
<p>alright thanks for your question to</p>
<p>Denise all right what kind of answers do</p>
<p>we have Karen okay these just so you</p>
<p>know just both came up now so okay I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>catching up all right okay we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>calcium zinc calcium calcium calcium</p>
<p>calcium calcium that&rsquo;s YouTube and</p>
<p>Facebook we got calcium silica</p>
<p>nobody said silica I don&rsquo;t think unless</p>
<p>I was back and silica is like the</p>
<p>mineral and sand and the thing is that</p>
<p>time don&rsquo;t eat more sand no no you want</p>
<p>to do food grade diatomaceous earth that</p>
<p>is something that I would recommend</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s actually a video that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna actually do today I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really important but you would think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the calcium it&rsquo;s not our bones</p>
<p>even the flexibility the elasticity of</p>
<p>the bone because people do have like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting brittle bones they can</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>osteo product so silica is really</p>
<p>important with your hair making your</p>
<p>hair really shiny and your skin glowing</p>
<p>and it does a lot of things for your</p>
<p>tendons and ligaments so go figure</p>
<p>right go figure I have two more</p>
<p>questions down the pike so don&rsquo;t go away</p>
<p>all right we&rsquo;re gonna go on the next</p>
<p>question Karen if you have have a good</p>
<p>one you have an interesting one sure</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on optimizing</p>
<p>lymphatic health by massage and</p>
<p>nutrition supplements no one talks about</p>
<p>my lymphatic health it&rsquo;s critical really</p>
<p>yeah well I think it&rsquo;s important I think</p>
<p>it is important the lymphatic system is</p>
<p>kind of like a secondary system that</p>
<p>helps drain off some of the excess from</p>
<p>the circulation but it&rsquo;s involved in</p>
<p>your immune system if you get infections</p>
<p>when you have lymph nodes in your throat</p>
<p>or your armpits whatever and you have a</p>
<p>microbe that&rsquo;s innervating the body that</p>
<p>lymph nodes going</p>
<p>capture it and swell up and try to</p>
<p>contain it to protect it from going on</p>
<p>the rest of the botnet so you have this</p>
<p>swollen glands so the best thing to do</p>
<p>is is honestly if you&rsquo;re actually if</p>
<p>your immune system is swollen and you</p>
<p>especially in the swollen glands in your</p>
<p>neck I would search sore throat dr. Byrd</p>
<p>I show you a technique of how to improve</p>
<p>that you guys won&rsquo;t even actually</p>
<p>believe unless you do it because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like oh there&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna work but it does work for sore</p>
<p>throats and things like that but as far</p>
<p>as immunes for a lymphatic system</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the thing called lymphedema</p>
<p>which is a whole condition where that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really tough condition to deal with</p>
<p>because it seems like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more of</p>
<p>a systemic it&rsquo;s a deep deeper problem</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a genetic factor to it so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really know what causes that I</p>
<p>have not found the magic bullet for that</p>
<p>but yeah so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a few comments</p>
<p>on that do you have any other questions</p>
<p>sure okay the guy here was curious about</p>
<p>taking bile salts with a sensitive</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>well it won&rsquo;t they won&rsquo;t hurt a</p>
<p>sensitive stomach because bile salts are</p>
<p>alkaline they&rsquo;re not acidic and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty yeah it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s slightly</p>
<p>alkaline so you&rsquo;re gonna take it and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s one of the problems the sensitive</p>
<p>stomach probably being gastritis or some</p>
<p>inflammatory condition in which you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to put apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>but you probably need it but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it so you want to do things like</p>
<p>cabbage cabbage juice which is really</p>
<p>good for the stomach gastritis licorice</p>
<p>root licorice extract is really good for</p>
<p>the stomach for gastritis or a sensitive</p>
<p>stomach fennel is good for the like</p>
<p>fennel tea is good for the stomach</p>
<p>chlorophyll is really good for the</p>
<p>stomach and then take the bile salts</p>
<p>just right after you eat that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would recommend it&rsquo;s not gonna make it</p>
<p>worse okay all right okay Karen on that</p>
<p>note we&rsquo;re gonna go to Ashley from San</p>
<p>Antonio Texas the home of the Alamo are</p>
<p>you there</p>
<p>Ashley yeah hello how are you hi good</p>
<p>I have a few questions regarding I guess</p>
<p>the gallbladder one of them is because I</p>
<p>picked your gallbladder formula and I</p>
<p>was wondering could you take it while</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having a gallbladder attack yeah</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna it</p>
<p>might be one of those things where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little too late on the chain of events</p>
<p>to try to handle it</p>
<p>I think it may help you I think what</p>
<p>might help you more is to do apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar or up soda vinegar pills just to</p>
<p>Sidda fie this stomach and also do</p>
<p>fasting so you don&rsquo;t irritate it with</p>
<p>more food and also do massage not on the</p>
<p>gallbladder on the opposite side on the</p>
<p>pancreas if you look under one of my</p>
<p>videos it&rsquo;s called a gallbladder flush I</p>
<p>show you how to do it and you can</p>
<p>massage the left side underneath the the</p>
<p>ribcage that will probably give you the</p>
<p>most relief but it&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>combination of now if you have an actual</p>
<p>stone you know the bile salts over time</p>
<p>will help break that down but again you</p>
<p>know check with your dock if it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>far it&rsquo;s too big like some people have a</p>
<p>stone on the size of their gallbladder</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but that&rsquo;s not gonna dissolve</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too big so there&rsquo;s a point up and</p>
<p>there are believe it or not there is a</p>
<p>surgery you can request they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>doing it that they can save the</p>
<p>gallbladder and just take out the stone</p>
<p>versus just chopped taking out the</p>
<p>entire gallbladder I mean that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>option - thanks Ashley you know Karen I</p>
<p>was actually in San Antonio Texas for</p>
<p>six months I remember that remember that</p>
<p>story mm-hmm weren&rsquo;t Sam Houston that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the country club of the army it was they</p>
<p>had like all these swimming pools I mean</p>
<p>it was just like it wasn&rsquo;t like basic</p>
<p>training it was really laid-back yeah</p>
<p>even know how to do medic training for a</p>
<p>while so anyway on that note let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>social media and see what we got okay so</p>
<p>someone I don&rsquo;t know how you know me but</p>
<p>someone else am I still a therapist I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming you mean occupational therapist</p>
<p>and no I&rsquo;m not there</p>
<p>truth be told okay now Petra on Facebook</p>
<p>is asking if you&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>No if Kido and I f is appropriate for</p>
<p>people with microscopic colitis if you</p>
<p>have issues with malabsorption is it too</p>
<p>much fat well you can always overdo the</p>
<p>fat I think what&rsquo;s gonna mess you up</p>
<p>more than anything is too much fiber if</p>
<p>you have problems in the bow or this</p>
<p>another condition it&rsquo;s really common</p>
<p>Karen it is C beau Timken stands for</p>
<p>talk about it okay small intestinal</p>
<p>bacterial overgrowth okay so you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>too many of these microbes in the wrong</p>
<p>place it&rsquo;s in it&rsquo;s in them up here it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the small intestine it&rsquo;s not in the</p>
<p>large bow where it should be and what</p>
<p>happens it&rsquo;s like you take this too much</p>
<p>fiber and you it just flares up this</p>
<p>hornets nest</p>
<p>so you want to probably do small amounts</p>
<p>of vegetables maybe some cooked</p>
<p>vegetables but not that many and then</p>
<p>let this Sinclair out and do in a minute</p>
<p>fasting but if you cut your carbs down</p>
<p>and go keto healthy keto and you do in a</p>
<p>minute fasting honestly that is the best</p>
<p>thing for the colon for microscopic :</p>
<p>itis was a Collider colitis yeah yeah</p>
<p>okay good and speaking about since we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the subject of the bowel okay we</p>
<p>finally got it in you know at the dinner</p>
<p>table family dinner right we finally got</p>
<p>this in guys we have the friendly</p>
<p>bacteria probiotic in in today so we had</p>
<p>this before but somehow we couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>it so we decided to keep trying to get</p>
<p>it now we finally got it in a lot of</p>
<p>people like this this is a very unique</p>
<p>probiotic now it does say one-month</p>
<p>supply and I just realized that I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>good with math because it says excuse me</p>
<p>one tablespoon of this in 32 servings</p>
<p>actually this will last you 90 days okay</p>
<p>now 30 days so I gave you a little extra</p>
<p>you got just a little more two months</p>
<p>free in that yeah but that&rsquo;s it quite a</p>
<p>mathematic</p>
<p>Aaron let me tell you what&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>about this and I&rsquo;m gonna actually you</p>
<p>want to try some okay try this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a shot you&rsquo;re supposed to have</p>
<p>it in just trow it in water yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not bad it&rsquo;s kind of like a little</p>
<p>fermented drink it&rsquo;s a little normally</p>
<p>put in water yeah it&rsquo;s very tart but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s yeah normally put it in water okay</p>
<p>dilute it it&rsquo;s a little acidic Wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d make your breath fresh could it</p>
<p>make your breath fresh but this is this</p>
<p>is not a dairy product this is a</p>
<p>non-dairy there&rsquo;s three types of</p>
<p>microbes in here three categories of</p>
<p>groups of microbes but there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really interesting you have these</p>
<p>friendly acid friendly acid bacteria</p>
<p>okay mm-hmm lactobacillus acid bacteria</p>
<p>makes it lactic acid and then it also</p>
<p>has friendly yeast okay now that&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>bad thing that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>and in house what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>photosynthetic microbes now before I</p>
<p>give you this big word for synthetic I</p>
<p>just want to tell you about I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>excited about that group of microbes</p>
<p>carob is awesome these microbes can live</p>
<p>in almost any environment with oxygen</p>
<p>without oxygen with light without they</p>
<p>eat minerals over to dr. Burke they eat</p>
<p>minerals just hand please</p>
<p>and they actually eat carbon dioxide and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re photosynthetic so they actually</p>
<p>they help us make oxygen so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>quite amazing and they can even adapt</p>
<p>and live in hot lava I&rsquo;m not kidding</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t incredible and they don&rsquo;t die so</p>
<p>when you take this it&rsquo;ll survive the</p>
<p>stomach Wow</p>
<p>but you take it right before bed and</p>
<p>then you let it kind of grow but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pretty cool product I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>do a video on it now that it&rsquo;s all over</p>
<p>my hands</p>
<p>okay okay well that is exciting</p>
<p>yeah and be sure to put it in water yeah</p>
<p>add some water</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say about like about a third of a</p>
<p>glass put a half of a cat fold to start</p>
<p>out slug it down right before we go to</p>
<p>sleep you wake up and</p>
<p>you know you can also put it in your</p>
<p>sump pump we did that before and it just</p>
<p>it just basically purifies the</p>
<p>deodorizes things there you go yeah just</p>
<p>FYI</p>
<p>too much information all right this is</p>
<p>excitement today this is good hey Stacy</p>
<p>are you still on you&rsquo;re from Louisiana</p>
<p>yes I am we&rsquo;re in Louisiana from</p>
<p>Lafayette Louisiana</p>
<p>oh no Lafayette nice so you had a</p>
<p>question you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not getting in</p>
<p>the weight loss is that correct no I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not about six weeks it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>frustrating I&rsquo;ve tried everything in a</p>
<p>minute fasting it&rsquo;s not having any</p>
<p>success okay how many meals a day are</p>
<p>you eating - sometimes a snack in</p>
<p>between okay and give me an example of</p>
<p>really quickly what you would eat in a</p>
<p>given meal for breakfast - eggs and</p>
<p>bacon and then I can give you what I had</p>
<p>yesterday I had a shrimp grilled and</p>
<p>some bacon fat with Brussels sprout okay</p>
<p>okay good so a couple things Stacy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things you could do to</p>
<p>speed things up number one make sure you</p>
<p>do not snack between the meals because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to spike insulin and if you</p>
<p>have a slow metabolism or you have you</p>
<p>have a thyroid issue you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to graduate to one meal a day</p>
<p>unfortunately but it&rsquo;s going to help you</p>
<p>lose a lot more weight so I would start</p>
<p>taking your window of eating and start</p>
<p>squishing it down closer and closer to</p>
<p>the point where it&rsquo;s one meal a day but</p>
<p>no snacking that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>take to really kick you into some</p>
<p>hardcore fat burning and then start to</p>
<p>reduce the fat content a little bit more</p>
<p>go up with some vegetables and try not</p>
<p>to overdo the protein thanks Stacy what</p>
<p>was so funny</p>
<p>kick it in you like that yeah yeah that</p>
<p>is good wasn&rsquo;t it enthusiastic well I</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re ready for the next question</p>
<p>yes please no I thought you asked the</p>
<p>next question I have three questions my</p>
<p>second question I think people were</p>
<p>answering right no that was that was um</p>
<p>that was a secret of the universe now</p>
<p>the weight loss secret that was that was</p>
<p>just we were just kidding on that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the second question</p>
<p>second question is what triggers more</p>
<p>growth hormone in a minute fasting or</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>okay guys what do you think and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>reveal the answer is I&rsquo;ll show ya after</p>
<p>this commercial now what I do that just</p>
<p>to make the producers laugh okay good</p>
<p>okay good do you have anything sure go</p>
<p>ahead</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s someone Erica who&rsquo;s anemic and</p>
<p>one meal a day brought her b12 down</p>
<p>advice well it depends on what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating that would deplete b12 I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like are you doing animal products</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you get your b12 are you</p>
<p>doing eggs if you&rsquo;re doing those foods</p>
<p>and your b12 is going down then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a problem with your stomach because you</p>
<p>need either good acid acid in your</p>
<p>stomach to absorb the b12 mm-hmm or you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have some type of microbe that</p>
<p>should be growing in the gut like this</p>
<p>so you need more more help with the</p>
<p>friendly bacteria to actually help you</p>
<p>make more b12 and absorb b12 that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I would look at I mean especially but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing now if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>maybe let&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re not doing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing a vegan version of keto which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get it up b12 I mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first thing that pops in my</p>
<p>mind but I would look either at your</p>
<p>stomach or your probiotics for that okay</p>
<p>is that a good question is that a good</p>
<p>answer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very good answer good let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Hasan from Israel your the question are</p>
<p>you there hello hello yes what was your</p>
<p>what was your question</p>
<p>hello all right just hello hello good</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your question yes I have tried</p>
<p>but Quito die and have lost 20 kilogram</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>good yes yes it was one year ago and</p>
<p>when I stopped it I have gained 25</p>
<p>kilogram I returned again to Matty wait</p>
<p>ok</p>
<p>and now I have extra 25 kilograms I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if I can return to kid who</p>
<p>died or not ok so this is one of those</p>
<p>things where I people like I this guy</p>
<p>that came in and said your diet doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work because I gained the weight back</p>
<p>after I stopped doing it for two weeks</p>
<p>I said well go back on do it again so</p>
<p>you this is not a diet it&rsquo;s not a diet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a diet guys it is a way of</p>
<p>eating well that is what well oh yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a way of life it&rsquo;s a lifestyle</p>
<p>change and so it&rsquo;s not meant to be done</p>
<p>and then once you lose the weight you</p>
<p>get off and then go back when you gain</p>
<p>the way back if you go back to your own</p>
<p>habits you&rsquo;re gonna gain it back so you</p>
<p>need to get on this saying you need to</p>
<p>get back on this and stand the wagon</p>
<p>forever and that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>maintain the weight so should you go</p>
<p>back well yes because it&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that worked so you want to do things</p>
<p>that work right right okay</p>
<p>so you know I think you should talk</p>
<p>about what you should talk about at the</p>
<p>keto summit what Dave Feldman went over</p>
<p>cuz he uses himself as an experiment</p>
<p>right oh yeah right okay he went off and</p>
<p>ate what they call sad the standard</p>
<p>American diet which is the appropriate</p>
<p>acronym</p>
<p>yeah and he did it for what one month</p>
<p>six weeks six weeks</p>
<p>okay tell tell what happened what he did</p>
<p>and this this is important guys if you</p>
<p>guys check the holidays coming up if you</p>
<p>guys checked out check back in right now</p>
<p>cuz this is really important okay if you</p>
<p>listen to this he goes off the key dough</p>
<p>does the regular carbohydrate thing okay</p>
<p>for six weeks</p>
<p>yeah his artery it carotid arteries art</p>
<p>is right here completely got thicker and</p>
<p>borderline like dangerous like you could</p>
<p>potentially have a stroke or even you</p>
<p>know yeah like a stroke clot and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know obstructing the blood flow so</p>
<p>just in six weeks yeah so this whole</p>
<p>idea of like a cheap month or whatever</p>
<p>holidays coming out I was like back on</p>
<p>it in January</p>
<p>Bishop Halloween many of Thanksgiving</p>
<p>many de Christmas and all of the parties</p>
<p>and all the socializing this was my</p>
<p>downfall every single year</p>
<p>how many every year how many people from</p>
<p>Thanksgiving to New Year&rsquo;s just pretty</p>
<p>much go off it and they just kind of go</p>
<p>hog want the exact number of people yes</p>
<p>or an estimation estimation a percentage</p>
<p>of population a crap-ton people but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing I mean that&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m so good I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so good all year long and it&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>hurt me here whatever but we were</p>
<p>shocked in just six weeks</p>
<p>yeah this guy and he tests himself</p>
<p>numerous of times I mean he pricks</p>
<p>himself all the time he&rsquo;s testing</p>
<p>something he records like a maniac like</p>
<p>every single thing he puts in his mouth</p>
<p>he takes a picture of and logs and this</p>
<p>guy is constantly researching it was</p>
<p>amazing at the summit but it was</p>
<p>shocking in just six weeks</p>
<p>he created a body that was just ripe for</p>
<p>all kinds of metabolic dangerous yeah so</p>
<p>okay so holiday the day Thanksgiving you</p>
<p>go off the program if you need to okay</p>
<p>get back on the next day don&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>get back on a month or a season</p>
<p>or whatever now we&rsquo;re just warning you</p>
<p>yes all right so what kind of answers do</p>
<p>we have oh okay so there&rsquo;s I think more</p>
<p>exercise there are people saying</p>
<p>intermittent fasting you know it was a</p>
<p>while ago but there are efforts here but</p>
<p>differs I offers offers but more people</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re saying exercise of some kind okay</p>
<p>do we have a drumroll please</p>
<p>fasting that&rsquo;s right in a minute fasting</p>
<p>and I mean fasting can increase your</p>
<p>growth hormone in women by thirteen</p>
<p>hundred percent what in men by 2,000</p>
<p>percent exercise can only increase it if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing it like hardcore by four to</p>
<p>seven hundred percent and that&rsquo;s if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing major sprints which not</p>
<p>many people might say is printing them</p>
<p>yeah not many people like that so</p>
<p>basically you&rsquo;re getting more than</p>
<p>double the response within a minute</p>
<p>fasting so Wow if you combine both of</p>
<p>those together guys you can just add</p>
<p>them and you can get 3,000 percent I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true but it sounded</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>hey guys don&rsquo;t go away we have one more</p>
<p>question coming up this last one&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be the best one I&rsquo;m saving the best for</p>
<p>last</p>
<p>now I just want clarify something yeah</p>
<p>so intermittent fasting right a lot of</p>
<p>people assume intermittent fasting even</p>
<p>educated people even people who are</p>
<p>speaking about things like this they</p>
<p>went to a college that went to a college</p>
<p>or are in this field think intermittent</p>
<p>fasting means well 24-hour fast 36-hour</p>
<p>fast no no no that&rsquo;s prolonged fasting</p>
<p>in a minute fasting is anywhere between</p>
<p>you know on a small little gradient this</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m calling like three meals no</p>
<p>snacks okay then to two meals no snacks</p>
<p>per day to the one meal a day that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m talking about it within a</p>
<p>minute fasting I&rsquo;m not talking about</p>
<p>like per long like fasting for forty</p>
<p>days and forty nights</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not right that&rsquo;s a prolonged fasting</p>
<p>good that you&rsquo;re not recommending that</p>
<p>good good to do every so often but not</p>
<p>40 days right don&rsquo;t do it every day now</p>
<p>I need to go too far hand he&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>Pakistan are you there hey doctor hi how</p>
<p>are you good hi doctor my question is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 47 years old I&rsquo;ve started Tito died</p>
<p>from last two weeks yes but I&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>bit worried in the end my worries about</p>
<p>my health condition I had a heart attack</p>
<p>five years ago and I&rsquo;m also using that</p>
<p>ICD on me yeah but I&rsquo;m still very</p>
<p>inclined to this you know a keto diet</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen you heard your lectures so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very very very encouraging to go on</p>
<p>coquito so my question is is it possible</p>
<p>to reverse the damages which has caused</p>
<p>my heart so I&rsquo;m currently 132 percent of</p>
<p>eco-efficiency</p>
<p>is there any way to reverse that so that</p>
<p>I my heart becomes to a normal condition</p>
<p>is it possible through this keto diet</p>
<p>anyway so so there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s not any</p>
<p>studies that can prove that and the</p>
<p>reason is because there&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>actually invest in the studies and the</p>
<p>type of keto program that I recommend</p>
<p>knows I&rsquo;m going to invest in the study</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no money in it however I</p>
<p>believe that you can just because of the</p>
<p>people that I&rsquo;ve worked with in the past</p>
<p>and the improvements that I&rsquo;ve seen I</p>
<p>mean let&rsquo;s just take a one-seat maybe</p>
<p>the guy who called recently it was a</p>
<p>seven then it went down the 5.1 that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great improvement in your a1c you see</p>
<p>all these amazing things with blood</p>
<p>pressure improvements in pulse rate</p>
<p>energy circulation visceral fat fatty</p>
<p>liver improves so I think you can</p>
<p>improve the damage from the arteries I</p>
<p>think you can strip off the</p>
<p>calcification in the arteries one thing</p>
<p>that I know is that they&rsquo;re people that</p>
<p>get a CA C testa coronary artery</p>
<p>calcification</p>
<p>calcium test that&rsquo;s a really important</p>
<p>one to do you can actually do it before</p>
<p>and then over time you can actually see</p>
<p>how the calcium is going away in the</p>
<p>arteries so then you know it&rsquo;s reversing</p>
<p>and that happens all the time so yes I</p>
<p>believe that you can reverse it as long</p>
<p>as you really focus on one thing</p>
<p>reducing the amount of insulin in the</p>
<p>body that&rsquo;s like the culprit behind most</p>
<p>heart problems but thanks for your</p>
<p>question all right Kevin do we have a</p>
<p>good question coming up here on the</p>
<p>interwebs you already talked about</p>
<p>protein grams per day right I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>release a video tomorrow guys on that</p>
<p>but protein grams you know I think I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>rather just send the video out because I</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit more detailed than</p>
<p>just a simple answer okay yeah okay</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s I think something you can really</p>
<p>do here Nick he is on healthy AF it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing on it for a month want to gain</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t feel hungry in his eating</p>
<p>window he&rsquo;s still trying to eat more fat</p>
<p>so you lose weight was he doing here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s a little tricky because</p>
<p>the problem with this eating plan is you</p>
<p>lose weight and there&rsquo;s a point if your</p>
<p>metabolism is fast and you want to</p>
<p>maintain or even gain weight you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to start increasing more</p>
<p>calories in general and you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna probably have to stick with two</p>
<p>meals and possibly even add a maybe</p>
<p>another meal in there but I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>doing that because we don&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>major benefits in the fasting so maybe</p>
<p>you would actually eat it like one</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock and then you would maybe have</p>
<p>another meal within the in the eating</p>
<p>window right in between that and another</p>
<p>one in like five or six so we actually</p>
<p>have three meals and spread them out and</p>
<p>that short eating window and the other</p>
<p>thing you have to do is not necessarily</p>
<p>start going more and more with the</p>
<p>protein go more with carbohydrate</p>
<p>because we talked about having 20 to 50</p>
<p>grams maybe you go on the higher end of</p>
<p>50 grams and if your metabolism is fast</p>
<p>you may need to push it up to</p>
<p>70 or even 80 grams of carbohydrate why</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re not going to the 300 that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>recommended in the sad diet you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just doing maybe you know carrots</p>
<p>beets</p>
<p>maybe a little melon berries hummus</p>
<p>those type of carbohydrates but yeah</p>
<p>that is a situation because especially</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re exercising it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just gonna keep losing weight so and</p>
<p>then heavier weight low reps that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I would do okay mm-hmm</p>
<p>all right good so we&rsquo;re gonna go to Bo</p>
<p>from Delray Beach Florida</p>
<p>hey Bo thank you dr. Burke can you hear</p>
<p>me yeah I can hear you fine nope okay</p>
<p>cool</p>
<p>hey thanks for taking my call sure so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a yeah i&rsquo;m i said the gym right now</p>
<p>i watch this podcast every well i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working out so that&rsquo;s a good habit right</p>
<p>so hang on about four months ago i had a</p>
<p>hundred ninety two pounds since then</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve lost 32 pounds healthy that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a full-time musician in the South</p>
<p>Ward scene so now it&rsquo;s just about the</p>
<p>bar too much food so I just had a</p>
<p>complete turnaround and did that I have</p>
<p>psoriasis I&rsquo;m on Humera currently on my</p>
<p>skin is cleared up a lot since I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>taking a child I didn&rsquo;t see eating fresh</p>
<p>salads twice a day with variety uh no</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>not eating in processed food at all</p>
<p>doing cider and olive oil in my salads</p>
<p>and and also taking broccoli stands for</p>
<p>Sakura Thane some other healthy stuff</p>
<p>but anyhow so long story short my skin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>starting to get better my joints are</p>
<p>feeling great and I want to know you</p>
<p>know what what&rsquo;s the process look like</p>
<p>to start figuring out you know whether</p>
<p>Humera is going to be necessary down the</p>
<p>road for me or whether you know how it</p>
<p>affects my liver in terms of there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>way that I can reduce the dosage of</p>
<p>course with my doctor&rsquo;s supervision</p>
<p>which I see every three months and does</p>
<p>blood work on me you know what does that</p>
<p>look like without really having</p>
<p>causing a flare-up because it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>thing where if I come off the Ameri</p>
<p>have done Matt steffanina cosmos waiting</p>
<p>for an impatient to come in where I</p>
<p>would have to flare up and we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>harder to backpedal also I had a weird</p>
<p>situation where I ate some some almonds</p>
<p>the other day and seemed to have a</p>
<p>little bit of a mild reaction to that</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve never had before but I cut</p>
<p>out all the notes out of my diet for now</p>
<p>at least so you know what is what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>picture look like I&rsquo;m doing a lot of</p>
<p>things my weights great you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting to get six-pack and doing a lot</p>
<p>of calisthenics pull-ups push-ups</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s on track but I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the end of the road looks like or I</p>
<p>say it would even be possible you know</p>
<p>what am I looking at</p>
<p>okay so here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>who mara mara is basically the number</p>
<p>one selling drug it&rsquo;s like massive I</p>
<p>mean there&rsquo;s a lot of people taking that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an anti-inflammatory and so it&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>know a lot of people it works</p>
<p>differently than other drugs even though</p>
<p>it does have side effects I&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>to tell you to come off the drug but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to tell you to watch my video on</p>
<p>that drug I did a video on the drug and</p>
<p>also I&rsquo;m going to recommend you do</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting every month</p>
<p>for start with 48 hours and then go to</p>
<p>72 hours every month that prolonged</p>
<p>fasting is going to greatly improve your</p>
<p>immune system and your inflammation and</p>
<p>then also make sure you add more higher</p>
<p>dosages of vitamin D like I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>like seventy five thousand I use with</p>
<p>some k2 for the skin issue that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would do</p>
<p>okay Bo thanks for your call all right</p>
<p>what do we got okay so we have someone</p>
<p>asking about the benefits of Oh mad for</p>
<p>postmenopausal women and exactly what</p>
<p>well the first thing is when you</p>
<p>postmenopausal your metabolism crashes</p>
<p>and burns and your cortisol goes up</p>
<p>other than that you perfectly fine so we</p>
<p>have this hormonal shift so a lot of</p>
<p>women want to lose weight at that point</p>
<p>and so the way to do it is how</p>
<p>Kito them in fasting to speed up the</p>
<p>metabolism because we&rsquo;re gonna lower it</p>
<p>insulin because what happens is when you</p>
<p>when you go through menopause your</p>
<p>cortisol goes up and that turns your</p>
<p>muscle into sugar and then your body</p>
<p>activates insulin so we have this high</p>
<p>insulin so keto and I mean fasting is</p>
<p>all about lowering insulin so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the benefit postmenopausal is</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna actually improve your</p>
<p>symptoms now sometimes you have to add</p>
<p>progesterone cream you know possibly if</p>
<p>you want to add that and there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other things too but honestly it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even more important postmenopausal to do</p>
<p>this or else you&rsquo;re dealing with more</p>
<p>weight gain and more atrophy of the</p>
<p>muscles okay good then we have a ton of</p>
<p>people today asking about hair loss yeah</p>
<p>did a lot of videos on that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing keto and in a minute fasting the</p>
<p>reason why the hair might be still</p>
<p>coming out because it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>growing is that you&rsquo;re not having enough</p>
<p>B vitamins but there&rsquo;s a little thing</p>
<p>with that if your gut Probot your flora</p>
<p>in your gut is not there you not you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to be able to manufacture in</p>
<p>assimilate B vitamins that well and that</p>
<p>could be the reason why the hair is not</p>
<p>coming back so it&rsquo;s either a gut issue</p>
<p>or I have lost two B vitamins so add</p>
<p>more B vitamins or the probiotic I do</p>
<p>have a hair formula that has the B</p>
<p>vitamins it has a certain type of</p>
<p>collagen and it has elect</p>
<p>trace minerals which are really</p>
<p>important in a couple other things just</p>
<p>to kind of be more of a broad base but</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s specific to keto in them in</p>
<p>fasting I would add more B vitamins if I</p>
<p>were you just the thought I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>throwing it out there just to suggest</p>
<p>just a suggestion I&rsquo;m just the messenger</p>
<p>okay all right so good so let&rsquo;s go Trey</p>
<p>from Pennsylvania are you there Trey dr.</p>
<p>burry</p>
<p>I care what part of Pennsylvania are you</p>
<p>from I&rsquo;m actually up in the Poconos I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>from Allentown my folks used to have a</p>
<p>place up there Hazleton</p>
<p>oh cool yeah cool I&rsquo;m in the Tanners</p>
<p>area right by like right off you know</p>
<p>the highway so right in the Tanners</p>
<p>feeling yeah right yeah hey hey so quick</p>
<p>on question a few questions on I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>having a lot of issues with my stomach</p>
<p>as of lately I will say about six weeks</p>
<p>ago I was on antibiotics clindamycin to</p>
<p>be exact and uh halfway through I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t even take them anymore because</p>
<p>I get chronic diarrhea mm-hmm that</p>
<p>lasted for about three weeks and and so</p>
<p>once I finally got some relief from that</p>
<p>things went back to normal and then</p>
<p>silly be lactose recently I just had</p>
<p>some ice cream and now I&rsquo;m back to the</p>
<p>same stomach issues again and it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of freaking me out a little bit I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>like oh gosh my shadow get my colon</p>
<p>checked and you know but I&rsquo;m 41 years</p>
<p>old I&rsquo;ll be 42 soon yeah so was this ice</p>
<p>cream is this ice cream like regular ice</p>
<p>cream or rose at a low-carb ice cream I</p>
<p>think your body&rsquo;s very clean Trey I</p>
<p>think your body&rsquo;s trying to tell you</p>
<p>something like don&rsquo;t eat that so yeah of</p>
<p>course you could be lactose intolerant</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s gonna create the diarrhea so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you do Trey get unhealthy</p>
<p>kyudo start fresh of course I&rsquo;m sure you</p>
<p>have the book to learn how to do it but</p>
<p>start keto do in a minute fasting that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna handle the digestive system</p>
<p>add some probiotics that&rsquo;s all you have</p>
<p>to do keep it simple and then don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>any more ice cream for at least six</p>
<p>months okay at least six months what do</p>
<p>you think here mm-hmm</p>
<p>right whether it wasn&rsquo;t interesting</p>
<p>right exactly okay so that&rsquo;s how you do</p>
<p>Trey thank you so much for your call and</p>
<p>we have another the last question of the</p>
<p>day guys you ready for this</p>
<p>you ready for Karen are you ready for</p>
<p>Karen are you ready for a question ah</p>
<p>Karen yes here we go</p>
<p>what country is diabetes then number one</p>
<p>killer hmm go ahead and type your answer</p>
<p>guys we&rsquo;re gonna go to a social media</p>
<p>question right now Karen has a really</p>
<p>juicy one what do you got I can why is</p>
<p>what debates happening here well you</p>
<p>look for that well I go to Mary Lynn</p>
<p>from New York are you there Mary I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>here can you hear me yeah I can oh great</p>
<p>I want to just first say a quick thank</p>
<p>you to both you and Karen you&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>just awesome and I&rsquo;ve benefited so much</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve only been listening for about a</p>
<p>month or a little more that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>yeah so my question is about discovering</p>
<p>that I am the liver type according to</p>
<p>your work and I have lost quite a bit of</p>
<p>my belly fat which is excellent but I</p>
<p>know that I overdo the fat and I tend I</p>
<p>mean I even kind of think my face looks</p>
<p>a little yellowish so I&rsquo;m concerned</p>
<p>about doing damage to my liver it takes</p>
<p>a lot of fat for me to feel satiated hmm</p>
<p>okay so and I&rsquo;m still having cravings</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m definitely doing a lot of</p>
<p>different types of fat with the keto so</p>
<p>okay let me tell you what to do and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got okay sure so good here&rsquo;s no unity</p>
<p>you want to increase the quality of</p>
<p>vegetables you have to keep a large</p>
<p>amount of vegetables in the diet if you</p>
<p>have a liver issue just to kind of keep</p>
<p>the liver really healthy very very</p>
<p>important the type of fat that you want</p>
<p>to consume I definitely a lot of salmon</p>
<p>omega-3 but there&rsquo;s three types of fat</p>
<p>that are medium chain triglycerides</p>
<p>which basically are very low stress on</p>
<p>the gallbladder and liver and you can do</p>
<p>these without a problem they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to make things worse one is the MC</p>
<p>well you can add that and make something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in your drink or something</p>
<p>like that also coconut oil that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good low stress on the liver and gold</p>
<p>butter and then some butter so those are</p>
<p>the fats that you can consume a little</p>
<p>bit more to satisfy you so you can</p>
<p>actually do this program but may keep</p>
<p>your vegetables high moderate protein</p>
<p>and then start doing a little bit more</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and then give it</p>
<p>time you&rsquo;ve just started this it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to work give it a little bit more time</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>thanks Mary Mary thing okay so why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we go to Tim and then we&rsquo;ll answer the</p>
<p>last question okay go ahead hey Tim are</p>
<p>you there hi Tim hi I am okay a little</p>
<p>unique I&rsquo;ve heard you answer the hare</p>
<p>question several times in the past um we</p>
<p>have a daughter that is just about to</p>
<p>turn nine she has Down syndrome</p>
<p>and she has had different issues in the</p>
<p>past and her but her health really now</p>
<p>never has been as as good as it is now</p>
<p>but her hair is all falling out in a</p>
<p>very short period of time okay so a</p>
<p>couple things Tim this is what you do</p>
<p>get a pen and paper</p>
<p>definitely for Down syndrome you want to</p>
<p>do a bit more iodine and other trace</p>
<p>minerals so that would be in seek help</p>
<p>add some seek help to the diet but there</p>
<p>is one more thing that I have gotten</p>
<p>good success with that condition and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a standard processed product you</p>
<p>can look this up online standard process</p>
<p>is called pituitary often PMG pituitary</p>
<p>often PMG write that down start having</p>
<p>your child take that and watch what</p>
<p>happens it should actually just kind of</p>
<p>enhance their growth and development of</p>
<p>their proteins big-time all right thanks</p>
<p>Tim okay what do we got for answers to</p>
<p>the question what country and is</p>
<p>diabetes and number one killer okay so I</p>
<p>have to go back quite a ways here did</p>
<p>you guys answer this</p>
<p>I think so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s in different</p>
<p>languages no no no believe it or not</p>
<p>Amir asked us USA USA they&rsquo;re answering</p>
<p>now u.s. is now say number seven okay</p>
<p>let me know let me guess</p>
<p>it has to be I think a country where</p>
<p>they eat a lot of rice so I&rsquo;m gonna say</p>
<p>China and the answer is Mexico even</p>
<p>though Mexico and you know what they</p>
<p>have their rated number one for</p>
<p>consuming not just Debbie&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>consuming the most beverages of you know</p>
<p>coca-cola and sugar drinks Wow what if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a connection there could be a</p>
<p>connection here what do you think</p>
<p>probably not so I think this is like a</p>
<p>such a no-brainer like to fix this</p>
<p>problem guys if you&rsquo;re from Mexico you</p>
<p>get on keto and I&rsquo;m gonna fasting and</p>
<p>you will succeed on that no guys thank</p>
