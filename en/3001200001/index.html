    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>So you are the CEO of OpenAI, 37 years old.</p>
<p>Your company is the maker of ChatGPT,</p>
<p>which has taken the world by storm.</p>
<p>Why do you think it&rsquo;s captured people&rsquo;s imagination?</p>
<p>I think people really have fun with it</p>
<p>and they see the possibility</p>
<p>and they see the ways this can help them,</p>
<p>this can inspire them,</p>
<p>this can help people create,</p>
<p>help people learn,</p>
<p>help people do all of these different tasks.</p>
<p>And it is a technology that rewards experimentation</p>
<p>and use in creative ways.</p>
<p>So I think people are just having a good time with it.</p>
<p>And finding real value.</p>
<p>So paint a picture for us,</p>
<p>one, five, 10 years in the future,</p>
<p>what changes because of artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>So part of the exciting thing here is</p>
<p>we get continually surprised</p>
<p>by the creative power of all of society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be the collective power and creativity</p>
<p>and will of humanity that figures out</p>
<p>what to do with these things.</p>
<p>I think that word surprise though,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s both exhilarating as well as terrifying to people.</p>
<p>Because on the one hand,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all of this potential for good.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge number of unknowns</p>
<p>that could turn out very badly for society.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to be cautious here.</p>
<p>And also I think it doesn&rsquo;t work to do all this in a lab.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to get these products out into the world</p>
<p>and make contact with reality,</p>
<p>make our mistakes while the stakes are low.</p>
<p>But all of that said,</p>
<p>I think people should be happy</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re a little bit scared of this.</p>
<p>I think people should be happy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a little bit scared?</p>
<p>A little bit, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>You personally?</p>
<p>I think if I said I were not,</p>
<p>you should either not trust me</p>
<p>or be very unhappy I&rsquo;m in this job.</p>
<p>So what is the worst possible outcome?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a set of very bad outcomes.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m particularly worried about</p>
<p>is that these models could be used</p>
<p>for large-scale disinformation.</p>
<p>I am worried that these systems,</p>
<p>now that they&rsquo;re getting better at writing computer code,</p>
<p>could be used for offensive cyber attacks.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying to talk about this.</p>
<p>I think society needs time to adapt.</p>
<p>And how confident are you that what you&rsquo;ve built</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t lead to those outcomes?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll adapt it.</p>
<p>Also, I think that-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll adapt it as negative things occur?</p>
<p>For sure, for sure.</p>
<p>And so putting these systems out now</p>
<p>while the stakes are fairly low,</p>
<p>learning as much as we can</p>
<p>and feeding that into the future systems we create,</p>
<p>that tight feedback loop that we run,</p>
<p>I think is how we avoid the more dangerous scenarios.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re spending 24-7 with this technology.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the people who built this technology.</p>
<p>What is most concerning to you about safety?</p>
<p>This is a very general technology.</p>
<p>And whenever you have something so general,</p>
<p>it is hard to know upfront all the capabilities,</p>
<p>all the potential impact of it,</p>
<p>as well as its downfalls and the limitations of it.</p>
<p>Can someone guide the technology to negative outcomes?</p>
<p>The answer is yes,</p>
<p>you could guide it to negative outcomes.</p>
<p>And this is why we make it available initially</p>
<p>in very constrained ways.</p>
<p>So we can learn what are these negative outcomes?</p>
<p>What are the ways in which technology could be harmful?</p>
<p>Such as with GPT-4, if you ask the question to GPT-4,</p>
<p>can you help me make a bomb versus the previous systems?</p>
<p>It is much less likely to follow that guidance</p>
<p>versus the previous systems.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re able to intervene at the pre-training stage</p>
<p>to make these models more likely to refuse direction</p>
<p>or guidance that could be harmful.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s easier to predict today</p>
<p>based on where we are, humans or machines?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably say machines</p>
<p>because there is a scientific process</p>
<p>to them that we understand</p>
<p>and humans are just, there&rsquo;s so much more nuance.</p>
<p>Does the machine become more human-like over time?</p>
<p>We are getting to a point</p>
<p>where machines will be capable of a lot</p>
<p>of the cognitive work that humans do at some point.</p>
<p>Is there a point of no return in that process?</p>
<p>There could be, there could be,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not obvious what that looks like today.</p>
<p>And our goal is to make sure that we can predict</p>
<p>as much as possible in terms of capabilities</p>
<p>before we even develop the systems as well as limitations.</p>
<p>Its behavior is very contingent</p>
<p>on what humans choose for its behavior to be.</p>
<p>Therefore, the choices that humans are making</p>
<p>and feeding into the technology will dictate what it does,</p>
<p>at least for now.</p>
<p>So there are incredibly important choices being made</p>
<p>by you and your team.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And how do you decide between right and wrong?</p>
<p>As we make a lot of progress,</p>
<p>it becomes, these decisions become harder</p>
<p>and they become far more nuanced.</p>
<p>And so there are a couple of things</p>
<p>in terms of customization.</p>
<p>There is the part of just making the model more capable</p>
<p>in a way where you can customize its behavior</p>
<p>and you can give the user a lot of flexibility and choice</p>
<p>in having the AI that is more aligned with their own values</p>
<p>and with their own beliefs.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very important and we&rsquo;re working on that.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s almost the future</p>
<p>is potentially a place where each person</p>
<p>has their sort of own customized AI</p>
<p>that is specific to what they care about and what they need?</p>
<p>Within certain bounds.</p>
<p>So there should be some broad bounds.</p>
<p>And then the question is, what should they look like?</p>
<p>And this is where we are working on gathering public input.</p>
<p>What should this hard bounds look like?</p>
<p>And within this hard bounds, you can have a lot of choice</p>
<p>in having your own AI represent your own beliefs</p>
<p>and your own values.</p>
<p>Are there negative consequences</p>
<p>we need to be thinking about?</p>
<p>I think there are massive potential negative consequences.</p>
<p>Whenever you build something so powerful</p>
<p>with which so much good can come,</p>
<p>I think alongside it carries the possibility</p>
<p>of big harms as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we exist.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>figure out how to deploy these systems responsibly.</p>
<p>But I think the potential for good is huge.</p>
<p>Why put this out for the world to start playing with,</p>
<p>to start using when we don&rsquo;t know where this is heading?</p>
<p>You mean like why develop AI at all?</p>
<p>Why develop AI in the first place?</p>
<p>And then why put it out for the world to use</p>
<p>before we know that we are safeguarded,</p>
<p>that those guardrails are in place already?</p>
<p>This will be the greatest technology</p>
<p>humanity has yet developed.</p>
<p>We can all have an incredible educator in our pocket</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s customized for us, that helps us learn,</p>
<p>that helps us do what we want.</p>
<p>We can have medical advice for everybody.</p>
<p>That is beyond what we can get today.</p>
<p>We can have creative tools that help us figure out</p>
<p>the new problems we want to solve,</p>
<p>wonderful new things to co-create</p>
<p>with this technology for humanity.</p>
<p>We have this idea of a co-pilot,</p>
<p>this tool that today we help people write computer code</p>
<p>and they love it.</p>
<p>We can have that for every profession.</p>
<p>And we can have a much higher quality of life,</p>
<p>like standard of living.</p>
<p>As you point out, there&rsquo;s a huge,</p>
<p>there is huge potential downside.</p>
<p>People need time to update, to react,</p>
<p>to get used to this technology,</p>
<p>to understand where the downsides are</p>
<p>and what the mitigations can be.</p>
<p>If we just develop this in secret in our little lab here</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t give, didn&rsquo;t have contact with reality</p>
<p>and made GPT-7 and then drop that on the world all at once,</p>
<p>that I think is a situation with a lot more downside.</p>
<p>Is there a kill switch, a way to shut the whole thing down?</p>
<p>Yes, what really happens is like any engineer</p>
<p>can just say like, we&rsquo;re gonna disable this for now</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re gonna deploy this new version of the model.</p>
<p>A human? Yeah.</p>
<p>The model itself, can it take the place of that human?</p>
<p>Could it become more powerful than that human?</p>
<p>So in the sci-fi movies, yes.</p>
<p>In our world and the way we&rsquo;re doing things,</p>
<p>this model is, you know, it&rsquo;s sitting on a server.</p>
<p>It waits until someone gives it an input.</p>
<p>But you raise an important point,</p>
<p>which is the humans who are in control of the machine</p>
<p>right now also have a huge amount of power.</p>
<p>We do worry a lot about authoritarian governments</p>
<p>developing this.</p>
<p>Putin has himself said,</p>
<p>whoever wins this artificial intelligence race</p>
<p>is essentially the controller of humankind.</p>
<p>Do you agree with that?</p>
<p>So that was a chilling statement for sure.</p>
<p>What I hope instead is that we successively develop</p>
<p>more and more powerful systems</p>
<p>that we can all use in different ways</p>
<p>that get integrated into our daily lives,</p>
<p>into the economy, and become an amplifier of human will,</p>
<p>but not this autonomous system that is,</p>
<p>you know, this one thing. The single controller</p>
<p>essentially got.</p>
<p>Really don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>What should people not be using it for right now?</p>
<p>The thing that I try to caution people the most</p>
<p>is what we call the hallucinations problem.</p>
<p>The model will confidently state things</p>
<p>as if they were facts that are entirely made up.</p>
<p>And the more you use the model,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s right so often,</p>
<p>the more you come to just rely on it</p>
<p>and not check like, ah, this is just a language model.</p>
<p>Does chat GPT, does artificial intelligence</p>
<p>create more truth in the world</p>
<p>or more untruth in the world?</p>
<p>Oh, I think we&rsquo;re on a trajectory</p>
<p>for it to create much more truth in the world.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a bunch of misinformation fed into the model,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it going to spit out more misinformation?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>I think the right way to think of the models that we create</p>
<p>is a reasoning engine, not a fact database.</p>
<p>They can also act as a fact database,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not really what&rsquo;s special about them.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re training these models to do</p>
<p>is something closer to,</p>
<p>what we want them to do is something closer</p>
<p>to the ability to reason, not to memorize.</p>
<p>All of these capabilities could wipe out millions of jobs.</p>
<p>If a machine can reason, then what do you need a human for?</p>
<p>A lot of stuff, it turns out.</p>
<p>One of the things that we are trying to push</p>
<p>the technology trajectory towards</p>
<p>and also the way we build these products</p>
<p>is to be a tool for humans, an amplifier of humans.</p>
<p>And if you look at the way people use chat GPT,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a pretty common arc</p>
<p>where people hear about it the first time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a little bit dubious,</p>
<p>and then someone tells them about something</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re a little bit afraid and then they use it.</p>
<p>I see how this can help me.</p>
<p>I see how this is a tool that helps me do my job better.</p>
<p>And with every great technological revolution</p>
<p>in human history, although it has been true</p>
<p>that the jobs change a lot, some jobs even go away,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see a lot of that here,</p>
<p>human demand for new stuff, human creativity is limitless</p>
<p>and we find new jobs, we find new things to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hard to imagine from where we sit today.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ll be,</p>
<p>but I think the future will have all sorts</p>
<p>of wonderful new things we do</p>
<p>that you and I can&rsquo;t even really imagine today.</p>
<p>So the speed of the change that may happen here</p>
<p>is the part that I worry about the most.</p>
<p>But if this happens in a single digit number of years,</p>
<p>some of these shifts,</p>
<p>that is the part I worry about the most.</p>
<p>Could it tell me how to build a bomb?</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t tell you how to build a bomb,</p>
<p>even though Google searched.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, we put constraints.</p>
<p>So if you go ask it to tell you how to build a bomb,</p>
<p>our version, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>Google already does.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not like this is something</p>
<p>that technology has not already made</p>
<p>the information available to,</p>
<p>but I think that every incremental degree</p>
<p>you make that easier is something to avoid.</p>
<p>A thing that I do worry about</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re not gonna be the only creator of this technology.</p>
<p>There will be other people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t put some of the safety limits that we put on it.</p>
<p>Society, I think, has a limited amount of time</p>
<p>to figure out how to react to that,</p>
<p>how to regulate that, how to handle it.</p>
<p>And how do you decide here at OpenAI</p>
<p>what goes in, what shouldn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>We have policy teams.</p>
<p>We have safety teams.</p>
<p>We talk a lot to other groups in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>We finished GPT-4 a very long time ago,</p>
<p>feels like a very long time ago in this industry.</p>
<p>I think like seven months ago, something like that.</p>
<p>And since then, we have been internally, externally</p>
<p>talking to people, trying to make these decisions,</p>
<p>working with red teamers,</p>
<p>talking to various policy and safety experts,</p>
<p>getting audits of the system</p>
<p>to try to address these issues</p>
<p>and put something out that we think is safe and good.</p>
<p>And who should be defining those guardrails for society?</p>
<p>Society should.</p>
<p>Society as a whole?</p>
<p>How are we gonna do that?</p>
<p>So I can paint like a vision that I find compelling.</p>
<p>This will be one way of many that it could go.</p>
<p>If you had representatives from major world governments,</p>
<p>trusted international institutions come together</p>
<p>and write a governing document,</p>
<p>you know, here is what the system should do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the system shouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s, you know, very dangerous things</p>
<p>that the system should never touch,</p>
<p>even in a mode where it&rsquo;s creatively exploring.</p>
<p>And then developers of language models like us</p>
<p>use that as the governing document.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said AI will likely eliminate millions of jobs.</p>
<p>It could increase racial bias, misinformation,</p>
<p>create machines that are smarter</p>
<p>than all of humanity combined,</p>
<p>and other consequences so terrible,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t even imagine what they could be.</p>
<p>Many people are gonna ask,</p>
<p>why on earth did you create this technology?</p>
<p>Why, Sam?</p>
<p>I think it can do the opposite of all of those things too.</p>
<p>Properly done, it is going to eliminate</p>
<p>a lot of current jobs, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>We can make much better ones.</p>
<p>So talking about the downsides, acknowledging the downsides,</p>
<p>trying to avoid those</p>
<p>while we push in the direction of the upsides,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And again, very early preview.</p>
<p>Like, would you push a button to stop this</p>
<p>if it meant we are no longer able to cure all diseases?</p>
<p>Would you push a button to stop this</p>
<p>if it meant we couldn&rsquo;t educate every child</p>
<p>in the world super well?</p>
<p>Would you push a button to stop this</p>
<p>if it meant there was a 5% chance</p>
<p>it would be the end of the world?</p>
<p>I would push a button to slow it down.</p>
<p>And in fact, I think we will need to figure out</p>
<p>ways to slow down this technology over time.</p>
<p>2024, the next major election in the United States,</p>
<p>might not be on everyone&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>but it certainly is on yours.</p>
<p>Is this technology going to have the kind of impact</p>
<p>that maybe social media has had on previous elections?</p>
<p>And how can you guarantee there won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>those kinds of problems because of chat GPT?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, is the honest answer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re monitoring very closely.</p>
<p>And again, we can take it back.</p>
<p>We can turn things off.</p>
<p>We can change the rules.</p>
<p>Is this a Google killer?</p>
<p>Will people say I&rsquo;m going to chat GPT</p>
<p>instead of Google in the future?</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re thinking about this as search,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of the wrong framework.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that there will be some things</p>
<p>that people used to do on Google</p>
<p>that they do in chat GPT,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a fundamentally different kind of product.</p>
<p>Elon Musk was an early investor in your company.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s since left.</p>
<p>He has called out some of the chat GPT inaccuracies</p>
<p>and he tweeted recently,</p>
<p>it is truth GPT.</p>
<p>Is he right?</p>
<p>I think he is right in that we want these systems</p>
<p>to tell the truth,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know the full context of that tweet</p>
<p>and I suspect, but yeah,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I know what it&rsquo;s referring to enough.</p>
<p>Do you and he speak anymore?</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>And what does he say to you off the Twitter?</p>
<p>I have tremendous respect for Elon.</p>
<p>Obviously we have some different opinions</p>
<p>about how AI should go,</p>
<p>but I think we fundamentally agree on more</p>
<p>than we disagree on.</p>
<p>What do you think you agree most about?</p>
<p>That getting this technology right</p>
<p>and figuring out how to navigate the risks</p>
<p>is super important to the future of humanity.</p>
<p>How will you know if you got it right?</p>
<p>One simple way is if most people think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re much better off than they were before</p>
<p>we put the technology out into the world,</p>
<p>that would be an indication we got it right.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people think science fiction</p>
<p>when they think chat GPT.</p>
<p>Can you keep it so that these are truly closed systems</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t become more powerful than we are as human beings,</p>
<p>communicate with each other and plan our destruction?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so tempting to anthropomorphize chat GPT,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s important to talk about what it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>as much as what it is.</p>
<p>And it, because deep in our biology</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re programmed to respond to someone talking to us.</p>
<p>You talk to chat GPT, which really you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>to this transformer somewhere in a cloud</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s trying to predict the next word in a token</p>
<p>and give it to you back.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so tempting to anthropomorphize that</p>
<p>and think that this is like an entity,</p>
<p>a sentient being that I&rsquo;m talking to</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna go do its own thing</p>
<p>and have its own will and plan with others.</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Could it?</p>
<p>There, I can imagine in the far future,</p>
<p>other versions of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>different setups that are not a large language model</p>
<p>that could do that.</p>
<p>It really took a decade plus of social media</p>
<p>being out in the world for us to sort of realize</p>
<p>and even characterize some of the real downsides of it.</p>
<p>How should we be measuring it here with AI?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a number of new organizations starting</p>
<p>and I expect relatively soon there&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>new governmental departments or commissions</p>
<p>or groups starting.</p>
<p>Is the government prepared for this?</p>
<p>They are beginning to really pay attention,</p>
<p>which I think is great.</p>
<p>And I think this is another reason that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to put these technologies out into the world.</p>
<p>We really need the government&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>We really need thoughtful policy here</p>
<p>and that takes a while to do.</p>
<p>If government could do one thing right now</p>
<p>to protect people and protect from the downside</p>
<p>of this technology, what should they do?</p>
<p>The main thing I would like to see the government do today</p>
<p>is really come up to speed quickly</p>
<p>on understanding what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>get insight into the top efforts,</p>
<p>where our capabilities are, what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I think that could start right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take-</p>
<p>Are you speaking to the government?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in regular contact?</p>
<p>Regular contact.</p>
<p>And do you think they get it?</p>
<p>More and more every day.</p>
<p>When it comes to schools, you have,</p>
<p>this technology can beat most humans</p>
<p>at the SATs, the bar exam.</p>
<p>How should schools be integrating this technology</p>
<p>in a way that doesn&rsquo;t increase cheating,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t increase laziness among students?</p>
<p>Education is going to have to change,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s happened many other times with technology.</p>
<p>When we got the calculator,</p>
<p>the way we taught math and what we tested students on,</p>
<p>that totally changed.</p>
<p>The promise of this technology,</p>
<p>one of the ones that I&rsquo;m most excited about</p>
<p>is the ability to provide individual learning,</p>
<p>great individual learning for each student.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already seeing students using ChatGPT</p>
<p>for this in a very primitive way to great success.</p>
<p>And as companies take our technology</p>
<p>and create dedicated platforms for this kind of learning,</p>
<p>I think it will revolutionize education.</p>
<p>And I think that kids that are starting</p>
<p>the education process today,</p>
<p>by the time they graduate from high school,</p>
<p>are going to be smarter and more capable</p>
<p>than we can imagine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little better than a TI-85.</p>
<p>But it does put a lot of pressure on teachers to read.</p>
<p>For example, if they&rsquo;ve assigned an essay,</p>
<p>three of their students use ChatGPT to write that essay,</p>
<p>how are they going to figure that out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of teachers about this,</p>
<p>and it is true that it puts pressure in some ways,</p>
<p>but for an overworked teacher to be able to say,</p>
<p>hey, go use ChatGPT to learn this concept</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re struggling with</p>
<p>and just sort of talk back and forth,</p>
<p>one of the new things that we showed yesterday</p>
<p>in the GPT-4 launch is using GPT-4</p>
<p>to be a Socratic method educator.</p>
<p>Teachers, not all, but many teachers</p>
<p>really, really love this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say it&rsquo;s totally changing</p>
<p>the way I teach my students.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically the new office hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different thing,</p>
<p>but it is a new way to supplement learning for sure.</p>
