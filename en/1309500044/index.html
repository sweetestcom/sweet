    <p>hi friends how are you today</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good to hear I&rsquo;m glad</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re having a bad day then I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Sarian and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s Murder Mystery and Makeup Monday</p>
<p>my theme song anyway so if you&rsquo;re new here</p>
<p>every Monday I&rsquo;ve been sitting down doing my makeup</p>
<p>and then talking about a true crime story that</p>
<p>is on my noggin</p>
<p>today I want to talk</p>
<p>about Robert</p>
<p>Juan because his whole</p>
<p>story is so suspicious</p>
<p>like the definition of suspicious</p>
<p>the people who did this who are responsible</p>
<p>for his death are out there</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s unsolved</p>
<p>unsolved the story gives me the creeps it&rsquo;s creepy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all I</p>
<p>could say there are a lot of people involved in this</p>
<p>story so I&rsquo;m gonna try my best to keep it simple</p>
<p>and like we don&rsquo;t get lost in this</p>
<p>so Robert was 1/4</p>
<p>generation Chinese American born in New York City okay</p>
<p>growing up he attended an all boys Catholic</p>
<p>school and later he went on to college</p>
<p>majored in public policy</p>
<p>in colleges when he met</p>
<p>Joseph Price now Joseph would turn into</p>
<p>a long life friend</p>
<p>so Robert ended up going to the</p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania Law School</p>
<p>and then he went on to pass the New York State Bar exam</p>
<p>very educated he won 1t of awards he was so</p>
<p>smart so in 2000</p>
<p>Robert moved</p>
<p>to Washington DC</p>
<p>and he joined a firm</p>
<p>focusing on commercial real estate and employment law</p>
<p>and in 2002 while attending a law conference</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where he met</p>
<p>a lady named Catherine</p>
<p>and they ended up falling in love</p>
<p>got into a relationship Catherine</p>
<p>lived in Chicago and for months</p>
<p>Robert would fly out there</p>
<p>every single weekend</p>
<p>to spend time with her and then</p>
<p>after a year of dating they got</p>
<p>engaged and they got married</p>
<p>so then by 2006</p>
<p>Robert was 32 years old he</p>
<p>lived with his wife Catherine</p>
<p>in Oakton Virginia</p>
<p>and then on June 30th</p>
<p>Robert left his</p>
<p>his current job yeah</p>
<p>and then he went to a new job and he took on the</p>
<p>title of general</p>
<p>counsel for</p>
<p>Radio Free Asia</p>
<p>which was an organization that broadcast news</p>
<p>pretty much giving information commentary to</p>
<p>in East Asia so</p>
<p>Robert and his wife they</p>
<p>would commute 20 to 30 miles to</p>
<p>their jobs in Washington DC</p>
<p>so it was like a pretty long commute for both of them</p>
<p>so Robert decides that he wants to attend</p>
<p>a law education course</p>
<p>and it would be held</p>
<p>late in the evening</p>
<p>which he didn&rsquo;t necessarily mind</p>
<p>because obviously it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help him</p>
<p>better his career and whatnot the downside of that he</p>
<p>would stay late</p>
<p>he would commute home as soon as he got home</p>
<p>he then would have to shower get</p>
<p>ready for bed</p>
<p>and then like 6</p>
<p>hours later</p>
<p>wake up get</p>
<p>ready for work</p>
<p>commute to work stay there all day do the same</p>
<p>thing over and over</p>
<p>again so he figured it</p>
<p>would be so much easier if I</p>
<p>could just like</p>
<p>crash out here</p>
<p>in Washington DC</p>
<p>maybe with a friend or something</p>
<p>so then I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to commute all the way back home and like I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>tired I just</p>
<p>wanna go to bed you know he was just wanting to</p>
<p>crash somewhere</p>
<p>cause it made more sense</p>
<p>versus commuting</p>
<p>and all that stuff</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s wife agreed and she&rsquo;s like yeah you should</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s on she said yeah you should</p>
<p>she agreed though she</p>
<p>understood so originally Robert</p>
<p>places a call to a female friend asking if</p>
<p>he can stay at her</p>
<p>place on the</p>
<p>night of August</p>
<p>second rather than commuting home after</p>
<p>his long day but she had to decline</p>
<p>for some reason</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>but she declined</p>
<p>which is totally fine</p>
<p>so robert&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>going through like down his list of okay</p>
<p>who else can I hit up then</p>
<p>Robert decides to hit up Joseph</p>
<p>price now earlier I mentioned</p>
<p>Robert had met Joseph when he was in college</p>
<p>anyways so he hits up Joseph because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still like friends Joseph</p>
<p>lived in downtown Washington DC so it was like</p>
<p>close to his work</p>
<p>ideally like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be awesome</p>
<p>if he could stay there</p>
<p>so Robert asks Joseph can I</p>
<p>crash at your</p>
<p>place gives him the</p>
<p>whole rundown</p>
<p>and Joseph he agrees and</p>
<p>Robert sets his plans</p>
<p>pretty much into motion</p>
<p>Robert tells his wife that on Wednesday August</p>
<p>second he will</p>
<p>commute to Washington with her in the morning</p>
<p>cause they both commuted</p>
<p>to Washington</p>
<p>and then she</p>
<p>would go home like normal and he</p>
<p>would attend</p>
<p>that class at</p>
<p>night time once the</p>
<p>class was over he was</p>
<p>gonna go to joseph&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and stay the</p>
<p>night there and then</p>
<p>all of that</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s wife was down with the plan</p>
<p>she helped him pack a little</p>
<p>night bag now Joseph</p>
<p>lived in a townhouse</p>
<p>not far from</p>
<p>Robert Shop</p>
<p>so Joseph is a lawyer</p>
<p>and a very prominent one he mainly</p>
<p>focuses on gay</p>
<p>rights advocacy</p>
<p>his job working in</p>
<p>intellectual property litigation</p>
<p>trademark and copyright disputes</p>
<p>so Joseph had</p>
<p>lived in this townhouse</p>
<p>with his domestic partner</p>
<p>Victor they had been together for</p>
<p>quite some time</p>
<p>they also had another</p>
<p>guy living in this townhouse and his name was Dylan</p>
<p>their relationship is kind of confusing</p>
<p>but they would describe it as just polyamorous</p>
<p>they constantly</p>
<p>refer to themselves as a family</p>
<p>but they all kind of had</p>
<p>different relationships</p>
<p>hi I won&rsquo;t go too much into</p>
<p>it because I feel like it&rsquo;s get really confusing and</p>
<p>so polyamorous</p>
<p>Robert is friends with Joseph</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call him Joe it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna be easier</p>
<p>Joe has a partner</p>
<p>named Victor they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been together for like the longest amount of time</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>added on the</p>
<p>3rd guy and his name is</p>
<p>Dylan got it</p>
<p>okay so Victor he worked as a</p>
<p>senior marketing manager for milk</p>
<p>like actual milk</p>
<p>he worked as the</p>
<p>marketing manager for the Milk Processors</p>
<p>Education program so this</p>
<p>group is responsible for the famous</p>
<p>got Milk campaigns do you remember those</p>
<p>so victor&rsquo;s like low key famous</p>
<p>what happened to</p>
<p>those Dylan</p>
<p>the 3rd guy</p>
<p>graduated from a massage therapy</p>
<p>school and he worked as a massage therapist</p>
<p>Victor and Joe</p>
<p>they shared the master bedroom</p>
<p>while Dylan</p>
<p>took a bedroom</p>
<p>on the second</p>
<p>story this house is</p>
<p>3 stories high so</p>
<p>dylan&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>second floor</p>
<p>Victor and Joe are on the top</p>
<p>floor of the master bedroom</p>
<p>so Dylan and</p>
<p>Joe had a sexual relationship</p>
<p>but I guess not with Victor when</p>
<p>asked about</p>
<p>their relationship Joe and Dylan it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>referred to as being a dominant</p>
<p>submissive sexual relationship with</p>
<p>Dylan being the dominant I guess</p>
<p>Dylan was really into BDSM</p>
<p>some being tied up</p>
<p>some really</p>
<p>freaky stuff</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>later because they do</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>story somehow</p>
<p>but like I&rsquo;m not trying to</p>
<p>shame you if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re into that or anything like do whatever you want</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not hurting anybody like I&rsquo;m not here to</p>
<p>judge and then</p>
<p>guess what god</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 1/4 person who lives in the</p>
<p>house her name&rsquo;s Sarah</p>
<p>apparently she&rsquo;s friends with Victor</p>
<p>but luckily</p>
<p>she was not there that</p>
<p>night that everything went down she told</p>
<p>the family the</p>
<p>household that she was</p>
<p>gonna be gone for the night</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s not in this</p>
<p>story but I feel like I have to mention her because</p>
<p>later on she is brought up but for now</p>
<p>Sarah lives there but she&rsquo;s not there</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s forget</p>
<p>Sarah I think</p>
<p>the best way to go through this is just like in the</p>
<p>order the events happened</p>
<p>most of the information didn&rsquo;t come out until</p>
<p>after the murder took place</p>
<p>to avoid a lot of confusion just</p>
<p>gonna kind of go in</p>
<p>order August 2nd</p>
<p>Robert and his wife</p>
<p>commute together to work just like planned</p>
<p>Roberts wife goes home</p>
<p>Robert stays behind and does</p>
<p>his work training and whatnot</p>
<p>and then at 9 30 pm</p>
<p>he calls his wife just to</p>
<p>check in with her</p>
<p>at 10 24 Robert calls Joe this call</p>
<p>obviously isn&rsquo;t like recorded or anything but</p>
<p>based off of what Joe said is that</p>
<p>Robert was just</p>
<p>checking in</p>
<p>letting him know that he</p>
<p>would be leaving</p>
<p>shortly to grab a taxi and he</p>
<p>would be over pretty soon</p>
<p>from work to joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>place it only took</p>
<p>8 minutes so he was</p>
<p>gonna be there</p>
<p>when Joe was</p>
<p>later interviewed</p>
<p>they asked him what he was doing at this time and</p>
<p>Joe said that</p>
<p>all the guys in the</p>
<p>house they had just finished dinner they were</p>
<p>cleaning up and then he was</p>
<p>cleaning up a mess</p>
<p>from an overflowing shower</p>
<p>it was also said that Victor was up in his room</p>
<p>and he was watching Project Runway and that Robert</p>
<p>had arrived sometime between 10 30</p>
<p>and 10 40 Joe says when</p>
<p>Robert arrived</p>
<p>Joe and Dylan were</p>
<p>still up and they were in the kitchen</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the ones who like welcomed</p>
<p>Robert inside the house</p>
<p>so they all like</p>
<p>stood in the</p>
<p>kitchen and they had some small talk</p>
<p>and they gave</p>
<p>Robert glass of</p>
<p>water just kind of</p>
<p>lightly caught up and then</p>
<p>Robert expressed that</p>
<p>he was really</p>
<p>tired from his long ass day</p>
<p>and that he just really wanted to go to bed</p>
<p>and that he</p>
<p>would definitely</p>
<p>wanna catch up with them in the morning</p>
<p>he was just</p>
<p>super exhausted and wanted to</p>
<p>knock out when they all went up to</p>
<p>their bedroom Joe showed Robert</p>
<p>where his bedroom was at let him go into his bedroom</p>
<p>went back upstairs</p>
<p>Dylan went to his room took his</p>
<p>sleeping pill</p>
<p>started reading</p>
<p>knocked out whatever</p>
<p>Dylan says he</p>
<p>heard the shower</p>
<p>start running</p>
<p>so he assumed that</p>
<p>Robert was taking a shower and then he fell asleep</p>
<p>so at this point it was</p>
<p>about 11 o&rsquo;clock at night okay</p>
<p>he lays in bed and he</p>
<p>starts watching TV but Victor the boyfriend</p>
<p>he asked Joe</p>
<p>to turn off the TV because he just wanted to go to</p>
<p>sleep and it was like distracting or it was too loud or</p>
<p>something and then they both just decided to go to bed</p>
<p>no TV fine so then</p>
<p>between 1105 and 1107</p>
<p>there were 2</p>
<p>emails that were</p>
<p>drafted one of the</p>
<p>emails was written to Catherine</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>saying that he made it to the home</p>
<p>gonna take a shower and he was</p>
<p>gonna go to bed and he</p>
<p>would talk to her the next day the</p>
<p>second email was to a work colleague</p>
<p>confirming the</p>
<p>lunch appointment that they were both gonna have</p>
<p>tomorrow the next day</p>
<p>they were both</p>
<p>drafted they were</p>
<p>never sent they were just</p>
<p>unsent suspicious</p>
<p>the townhouse that they all live in</p>
<p>it has an alarm</p>
<p>system the alarm</p>
<p>system of course</p>
<p>was not active that</p>
<p>night so somebody had turned it off</p>
<p>but even when it&rsquo;s not active there&rsquo;s a door chime</p>
<p>that goes off if the</p>
<p>door the front door the back door is</p>
<p>opened and closed</p>
<p>so you know the little beep beep when you walk in</p>
<p>apparently the neighborhood that they</p>
<p>lived in had a very high crime rate</p>
<p>and like everybody had an</p>
<p>alarm system you</p>
<p>would just be</p>
<p>ridiculous and not turn your</p>
<p>alarm system on</p>
<p>Victor and Joe are</p>
<p>in their master bedroom they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sleeping and they hear the</p>
<p>they said they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think twice</p>
<p>about it because they thought well</p>
<p>maybe Sarah</p>
<p>the other roommate</p>
<p>maybe she is just coming home</p>
<p>early that was</p>
<p>their thought process and then what</p>
<p>occurs between 11 10</p>
<p>and 11 50 nobody</p>
<p>really knows what the hell went on in that townhouse</p>
<p>11 49 p m A 911 call is made by Victor</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s frantic</p>
<p>the 911 operator asks</p>
<p>what kind of services he needs and he says he needs an</p>
<p>ambulance he</p>
<p>states to the</p>
<p>911 dispatcher that he believes an intruder</p>
<p>has entered the home</p>
<p>and that their</p>
<p>guest has been</p>
<p>stabbed if you listen to the 911 call he does</p>
<p>sound panic</p>
<p>he sounds like how a lot of us</p>
<p>would probably sound</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re making this 911 call</p>
<p>which I pray none of us have to experience</p>
<p>so then the 911 dispatcher</p>
<p>is telling him okay</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you need</p>
<p>to do you need to put or somebody needs to put a towel</p>
<p>over robert&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wounds until the</p>
<p>ambulance gets there and to</p>
<p>apply firm pressure she also informs</p>
<p>Victor to switch the</p>
<p>towel out if it becomes soaked</p>
<p>with blood and to continue to do so</p>
<p>until paramedics arrive</p>
<p>during the call</p>
<p>Victor is crying</p>
<p>he tells the</p>
<p>operator that he&rsquo;s afraid to go downstairs to open the</p>
<p>door for paramedics because he&rsquo;s unsure if the intruder</p>
<p>is inside of the</p>
<p>house but the 911 operator asks like are you</p>
<p>applying pressure pretty much</p>
<p>to the victim</p>
<p>and you know with a</p>
<p>towel to stop the</p>
<p>wound from bleeding</p>
<p>and Victor says that somebody&rsquo;s doing that</p>
<p>his partner I believe is doing that then at 11 54 pm</p>
<p>is when the paramedics arrive</p>
<p>victor&rsquo;s the one who opens up the door for them</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s wearing a</p>
<p>white robe and then he</p>
<p>directs them</p>
<p>to the second</p>
<p>floor and just kind of tells them that way</p>
<p>now when paramedics go up the</p>
<p>stairs they run into Dylan</p>
<p>and paramedics ask Dylan</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>victim and Dylan</p>
<p>also wearing a</p>
<p>white robe says nothing</p>
<p>he just points</p>
<p>to the bedroom and then walks into his own bedroom and</p>
<p>shuts the door</p>
<p>paramedics later said that</p>
<p>it was just a really strange encounter like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apparently somebody</p>
<p>stabbed and</p>
<p>dying in this room</p>
<p>and instead of like</p>
<p>hey guys he&rsquo;s this way</p>
<p>Dylan was just kind of like</p>
<p>and then goes to his bedroom</p>
<p>like it was just</p>
<p>weird so then paramedics go into the bedroom</p>
<p>where robert&rsquo;s staying</p>
<p>right and they find Robert</p>
<p>on the fold out bed</p>
<p>lying on his back</p>
<p>his head on a pillow fluffed</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for</p>
<p>laughing it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny but like it was just</p>
<p>funny that in the description of the</p>
<p>the room it was like the pillow was</p>
<p>fluffed but it does make a difference</p>
<p>because the pillow look like it hadn&rsquo;t been like</p>
<p>laid on there was only one indentation</p>
<p>of like his head as he was currently laying</p>
<p>which means like he wasn&rsquo;t there at all</p>
<p>you know the room was in perfect condition</p>
<p>there was not a sign of any type of struggle</p>
<p>or anything it looked like Rob was placed perfectly</p>
<p>onto this pull out</p>
<p>mattress thing</p>
<p>fluffed pillow</p>
<p>his body was</p>
<p>slightly at an angle</p>
<p>and Rob was on top of the sheets of the bed and the bed</p>
<p>underneath him was made perfectly</p>
<p>like you know when you go to</p>
<p>a hotel or a</p>
<p>fancy place and</p>
<p>the bed sheets are all tucked into the mattress</p>
<p>and they like</p>
<p>perfectly fold the</p>
<p>blanket at a 45 degree</p>
<p>angle with like the</p>
<p>under sheet</p>
<p>perfectly folded on top</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s how this bed was like it was perfect</p>
<p>condition rob had on a</p>
<p>T shirt and</p>
<p>underwear and</p>
<p>later Catherine</p>
<p>his wife would</p>
<p>say this is what he always wore to bed so that&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>he also had in his</p>
<p>mouth guard he was</p>
<p>apparently like a</p>
<p>teeth grinder</p>
<p>he wear mouth guard</p>
<p>every night</p>
<p>so when paramedics walk in they see</p>
<p>Robert sitting on the bed like perfectly right</p>
<p>and then Joe</p>
<p>is sitting like</p>
<p>opposite of him on the bed</p>
<p>paramedics when</p>
<p>they come into the room they ask Joe what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on what happened and Joe says</p>
<p>I just heard a</p>
<p>scream and I ran downstairs Joe</p>
<p>he moves out of the way so paramedics can</p>
<p>work on Robert</p>
<p>and the paramedics they find</p>
<p>3 slits on robert&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shirt one seems to be like in</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s abdomen</p>
<p>area there&rsquo;s one like directly in his</p>
<p>heart and they just</p>
<p>see like there&rsquo;s no sign of life now here is the really</p>
<p>really red flaggy</p>
<p>super suspicious</p>
<p>thing okay get</p>
<p>ready for it paramedics</p>
<p>would report that the</p>
<p>crime scene was</p>
<p>weird Robert was</p>
<p>stabbed 3 times</p>
<p>right and in really</p>
<p>major places his abdomen his</p>
<p>heart and I believe like on his side</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know this</p>
<p>but if you get</p>
<p>stabbed there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a lot of</p>
<p>blood right I</p>
<p>think we can all</p>
<p>agree a lot of</p>
<p>blood when they walk in there</p>
<p>there is not a single</p>
<p>ounce of blood</p>
<p>anywhere in the room</p>
<p>what no blood</p>
<p>no blood nothing</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re stabbed</p>
<p>there would be</p>
<p>blood on the bed</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no blood now here&rsquo;s the even more</p>
<p>suspicious part there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blood on Robert</p>
<p>shirt as there</p>
<p>should be he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>stabbed but the</p>
<p>blood that&rsquo;s on his</p>
<p>shirt why am I</p>
<p>whispering the</p>
<p>blood that&rsquo;s on his shirt</p>
<p>would look like</p>
<p>somebody dipped</p>
<p>their finger in</p>
<p>blood and then like</p>
<p>swiped it on there to make it look like a</p>
<p>blood streak</p>
<p>later it was tested and like</p>
<p>proven that it just was a random</p>
<p>source bush</p>
<p>to make it look like it was</p>
<p>blood remember when the 911 dispatcher told Victor</p>
<p>apply pressure onto the</p>
<p>wound with a</p>
<p>towel and keep doing that</p>
<p>until paramedics gets there</p>
<p>Victor said on the 911 call that yes</p>
<p>okay someone&rsquo;s doing that</p>
<p>right now they get this</p>
<p>towel that was supposedly used to</p>
<p>cover robert&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wound this towel</p>
<p>it was like a little speck of</p>
<p>blood that they supposedly use to</p>
<p>cover the wound it just didn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>in victor&rsquo;s defense</p>
<p>I will say that like in a moment of</p>
<p>panic I personally don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know how I</p>
<p>would act and I hope I don&rsquo;t find out</p>
<p>in that kind of situation but I can sometimes</p>
<p>understand when like somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story changes because</p>
<p>in a moment of</p>
<p>panic you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fully thinking</p>
<p>straight like you&rsquo;re just not there</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like when people&rsquo;s stories change and</p>
<p>stuff I kind of</p>
<p>understand so</p>
<p>then the paramedics put robber onto the stretcher</p>
<p>and they carry him out to the</p>
<p>ambulance they take him to the hospital</p>
<p>the paramedics guy</p>
<p>he was questioned by investigators later on</p>
<p>and he said that the</p>
<p>3 men appeared to be</p>
<p>freshly showered</p>
<p>and acting very calm</p>
<p>when he came to the house</p>
<p>weird because normally when he goes to a home</p>
<p>or a crime scene</p>
<p>you know people</p>
<p>are acting very frantic of course he said like</p>
<p>everybody acts differently in a moment of</p>
<p>panic but the</p>
<p>whole thing was just kind it was</p>
<p>just really strange that they were all acting calmly</p>
<p>and then Victor the one who called 911 he sounded</p>
<p>super frantic and like he was crying on the 911 call</p>
<p>but the paramedics</p>
<p>guy said that when he got there Victor</p>
<p>appeared to just kind of be like concerned but not</p>
<p>necessarily</p>
<p>how he was acting on the 911 call</p>
<p>so the EMT guy he</p>
<p>would later say</p>
<p>that it appeared Robert</p>
<p>it almost seemed</p>
<p>like he had been</p>
<p>freshly showered</p>
<p>because of the lack of</p>
<p>blood because of how</p>
<p>clean he was</p>
<p>I mean he just got</p>
<p>stabbed where&rsquo;s the blood</p>
<p>also according to</p>
<p>crime scene investigators it appeared that</p>
<p>everything in the</p>
<p>house seemed untouched</p>
<p>there didn&rsquo;t look to be a sign of struggle at all</p>
<p>Robert had 2 wallets and</p>
<p>they were both filled with cash</p>
<p>he had those out he had his</p>
<p>mouthguard case</p>
<p>and a watch also his Blackberry</p>
<p>so if somebody</p>
<p>broke into the</p>
<p>house and was trying to rob him I mean they</p>
<p>would take that</p>
<p>stuff also the</p>
<p>knife seemed to have come from</p>
<p>their own kitchen area</p>
<p>sadly Robert was pronounced dead on August</p>
<p>3rd at like</p>
<p>12 30 in the morning they</p>
<p>could not revive him</p>
<p>when all the guys were</p>
<p>being questioned they all had very consistent stories</p>
<p>and like none of them seemed to mess up according to</p>
<p>Dylan Joe and Victor</p>
<p>Dylan and Joe led</p>
<p>Robert to the</p>
<p>second floor</p>
<p>guest room where they helped</p>
<p>Robert pull out</p>
<p>and set up his bed Joe</p>
<p>and Victor say that</p>
<p>after they heard the door chime</p>
<p>that they also</p>
<p>heard weird</p>
<p>noises they</p>
<p>would go on to describe that the weird</p>
<p>noises was like a low</p>
<p>scream like a</p>
<p>muffled scream</p>
<p>and then that</p>
<p>caused them</p>
<p>to both get up out of bed</p>
<p>and go downstairs to investigate</p>
<p>they both said</p>
<p>that they ran</p>
<p>down to the</p>
<p>second floor</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>heard another</p>
<p>muffled scream</p>
<p>and then they ran towards</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>Victor and Joe</p>
<p>say that&rsquo;s when they</p>
<p>would go into</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>and they see him</p>
<p>wounded Dylan said that the</p>
<p>screaming and all the ruckus is what woke him up</p>
<p>and he opened the door to see like what was</p>
<p>going on and then Joe says upon</p>
<p>checking Robert he</p>
<p>found the boning</p>
<p>knife from the kitchen</p>
<p>which was laying on</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s stomach</p>
<p>he moved the boning knife from</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s stomach and put it onto</p>
<p>the nightstand area</p>
<p>Joe says he lifted up rob&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shirt or robert&rsquo;s shirt</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when he sees like all the stab</p>
<p>wounds and the blood</p>
<p>and it was just all over his chest</p>
<p>so then the EMT also said that the stab</p>
<p>wounds were big enough to fit like</p>
<p>3 fingers in they were big wounds</p>
<p>there was obviously a lack of</p>
<p>blood evidence in the room</p>
<p>a few small</p>
<p>stains on the sheets and pillow police</p>
<p>would report</p>
<p>no evidence of</p>
<p>force entry into the home</p>
<p>and that no items had been</p>
<p>stolen out of the home police</p>
<p>bring cadaver</p>
<p>dogs in now</p>
<p>these dogs are</p>
<p>trained to alert</p>
<p>the police officers if they find</p>
<p>blood or like</p>
<p>even bodies and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>so the cadaver dogs</p>
<p>alert the police officers to</p>
<p>blood that was</p>
<p>they seemed to</p>
<p>sense on the rear</p>
<p>stairwell also</p>
<p>a drain and</p>
<p>the dryer so the dog</p>
<p>alerts them</p>
<p>and to the naked eye they don&rsquo;t see any blood and</p>
<p>stuff but they&rsquo;re like okay</p>
<p>take note of this we&rsquo;ll investigate</p>
<p>later so the</p>
<p>whole scene is just weird</p>
<p>right okay we all</p>
<p>agree on that all the guys stand by</p>
<p>nobody in the</p>
<p>house is responsible for this</p>
<p>they all stick to</p>
<p>their stories</p>
<p>about sleeping and being in bed and hearing the muffled</p>
<p>scream whatever</p>
<p>Joe ended up being interrogated by police for about 6</p>
<p>hours Victor</p>
<p>was in there for about</p>
<p>8 hours and then</p>
<p>Dylan was in there for almost 12 hours</p>
<p>during the interrogation Joe</p>
<p>is reported to be arrogant</p>
<p>unconcerned</p>
<p>aggressive and</p>
<p>self centered Vic</p>
<p>Victor he was</p>
<p>initially tearful and then he became passive</p>
<p>and unmotivated to help the investigation and then</p>
<p>Dylan is apparently just unmoved detached</p>
<p>and calm like he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give 2 shits he&rsquo;s just like yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here so then</p>
<p>after leaving the police station all 3 men</p>
<p>got legal counsel</p>
<p>and they stick with</p>
<p>their story that</p>
<p>Robert had to have been killed by an intruder</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s necessarily</p>
<p>suspicious I</p>
<p>think if you&rsquo;re ever arrested for something you</p>
<p>should get legal counsel</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just what you</p>
<p>should do you just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get pinned on you</p>
<p>like I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being interrogated for 12 hours</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably come out</p>
<p>saying some shit I didn&rsquo;t do like you just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>for these guys though they shouldn&rsquo;t have but they knew</p>
<p>then an autopsy was done</p>
<p>on Robert there was a lot</p>
<p>going on with Robert</p>
<p>the lady who</p>
<p>did the autopsy according to her examination</p>
<p>she found 2 broken capillaries</p>
<p>in robert&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right eye and his left eyelid</p>
<p>now these happen when somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fighting for air such as like suffocation</p>
<p>being choked</p>
<p>strangulation</p>
<p>examiner did</p>
<p>state that asphyxia seem to be involved in this</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not necessarily what</p>
<p>caused him to die but the</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>is that the stab</p>
<p>wounds were perfect slit</p>
<p>like defects both</p>
<p>clean and symmetrical</p>
<p>which is so uncommon</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stabbed when you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>stabbed most likely you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to like move and try and</p>
<p>fight back so</p>
<p>the stab wounds tend to be like</p>
<p>jagged and kind of</p>
<p>just not clean</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re moving and trying to get away and like</p>
<p>fighting back</p>
<p>so it was really strange that the cuts were</p>
<p>super perfect and</p>
<p>symmetrical</p>
<p>each wound was 04:56 inches deep there were</p>
<p>absolutely no defense</p>
<p>wounds on his body and</p>
<p>after swabbing his</p>
<p>mouth genital</p>
<p>area and his anus</p>
<p>she found the</p>
<p>examiner evidence of semen</p>
<p>in his anus</p>
<p>and his own</p>
<p>genitals so they</p>
<p>found semen</p>
<p>and I was like okay cool</p>
<p>not cool but like cool this is</p>
<p>gonna help pinpoint whoever murdered him nene</p>
<p>I say you see they sent the DNA</p>
<p>for testing and it turns out it was</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s own seaman</p>
<p>which makes</p>
<p>sense when it&rsquo;s on your</p>
<p>lower region</p>
<p>okay makes sense that the semen is there</p>
<p>but how did his own semen</p>
<p>get into his back area his anus the</p>
<p>whole thing is weird</p>
<p>right what the F is</p>
<p>going on the medical examiner</p>
<p>found 6 needle marks</p>
<p>throughout his body</p>
<p>some on his</p>
<p>chest his right foot</p>
<p>left hand and left side of his neck</p>
<p>toxicology was done on</p>
<p>Robert but the problem with that is</p>
<p>you have to be looking for a specific drug in</p>
<p>order to find it so when they do</p>
<p>toxicology they look for basic</p>
<p>stuff like alcohol cocaine opiates</p>
<p>anything like over the</p>
<p>counter there isn&rsquo;t a single</p>
<p>test that can be done that will find any type of drug</p>
<p>when the test</p>
<p>came back they all came back negative so that was</p>
<p>weird like what were</p>
<p>those needle marks then</p>
<p>right I can&rsquo;t remember what I was</p>
<p>watching but I was just</p>
<p>watching something</p>
<p>where a girl had needle marks in her</p>
<p>and it was a certain kind of drug that</p>
<p>leaves your</p>
<p>system within a couple of hours</p>
<p>watching this</p>
<p>whole documentary</p>
<p>about it and yeah it</p>
<p>leaves in a couple of</p>
<p>hours and there&rsquo;s like no way to trace it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>crazy with these date rape drugs y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>you need to be careful</p>
<p>did I just say y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>case gets even more</p>
<p>weird here ready</p>
<p>so you know the</p>
<p>knife that was found</p>
<p>guess what it was</p>
<p>later determined that the</p>
<p>knife that was</p>
<p>found next to</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t even the knife</p>
<p>that was used on Robert</p>
<p>the knife that was</p>
<p>found next to</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t line up with the stab</p>
<p>wounds that</p>
<p>Robert already had</p>
<p>on the knife</p>
<p>there were no</p>
<p>fibers found on the blade</p>
<p>so if you get</p>
<p>stabbed or somebody gets</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why I always use like you as an example or me</p>
<p>so if somebody gets</p>
<p>stabbed on the knife</p>
<p>the blood swipes</p>
<p>on the knife</p>
<p>should line up and be consistent with being</p>
<p>stabbed the</p>
<p>fibers from the</p>
<p>clothing you&rsquo;re wearing</p>
<p>if you are wearing</p>
<p>clothing there are</p>
<p>gonna be tiny tiny</p>
<p>fibers left</p>
<p>on the actual</p>
<p>knife itself</p>
<p>and then that</p>
<p>should line up there were no</p>
<p>T shirt fibers</p>
<p>found but guess what</p>
<p>there were tiny</p>
<p>fibers found on this</p>
<p>blade that lined up</p>
<p>with the towel that had</p>
<p>blood on it</p>
<p>in the bedroom</p>
<p>so what they</p>
<p>think happened is</p>
<p>the blood that was placed in the room</p>
<p>what they did was whoever did this they got some</p>
<p>blood from robert&rsquo;s body and then they swiped it on the</p>
<p>knife to make it look like it was the murder weapon</p>
<p>the guys aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>talking anymore they all have an attorney</p>
<p>but they do get a warrant to</p>
<p>search the home</p>
<p>take out any</p>
<p>evidence or anything they</p>
<p>could use to hopefully</p>
<p>piece this together they come across some weird</p>
<p>stuff and it&rsquo;s a lot of like sexual</p>
<p>things that are used like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re having sex</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know because I honestly</p>
<p>had never heard of</p>
<p>these items</p>
<p>until I was reading</p>
<p>about this case I didn&rsquo;t know this was the</p>
<p>thing but it is</p>
<p>and not judging if you have one live your life</p>
<p>but they think this is</p>
<p>could come into play so one</p>
<p>thing they found</p>
<p>was and I&rsquo;m reading my notes because</p>
<p>honestly I need help with this one</p>
<p>so one item they</p>
<p>found was known</p>
<p>as a milking machine</p>
<p>now this is used to</p>
<p>force someone to ejaculate</p>
<p>some people believe that this is what was used on</p>
<p>Robert that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the semen came from</p>
<p>they also found books such as</p>
<p>Erotic Bondage Handbook and Juice</p>
<p>electricity</p>
<p>for pain and pleasure</p>
<p>they also found a 3</p>
<p>piece culinary set</p>
<p>which was missing one of the knives</p>
<p>mm hmm there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>layers to this</p>
<p>they also found</p>
<p>metal probes</p>
<p>and an electrical</p>
<p>shockwave generator</p>
<p>okay so years go by and nothing happens</p>
<p>so like this happened in 2006 and nothing happens until</p>
<p>2008 they end up selling the</p>
<p>place in 2008</p>
<p>and they all</p>
<p>leave the town home</p>
<p>October of 2008</p>
<p>Dylan he ended up getting</p>
<p>charged with obstruction of justice</p>
<p>the next month in November</p>
<p>Joe and Victor were arrested and also</p>
<p>charged with obstruction of justice</p>
<p>Catherine Roberts</p>
<p>wife she filed a 20</p>
<p>million dollar</p>
<p>civil suit against the men but all</p>
<p>3 men would end up being released</p>
<p>well they were trying to charge them</p>
<p>with obstruction of justice because they obviously like</p>
<p>cleaned up the</p>
<p>crime scene they</p>
<p>cleaned him up</p>
<p>they were hiding</p>
<p>stuff and then they all got out and then December 19th</p>
<p>2008 all 3 men</p>
<p>were charged with conspiracy</p>
<p>an affidavit</p>
<p>filed by authorities</p>
<p>against Dylan</p>
<p>stated that the men</p>
<p>were not telling the</p>
<p>truth about what happened that</p>
<p>night the judge</p>
<p>ended up finding all</p>
<p>3 of the men</p>
<p>not guilty and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super frustrating at first but</p>
<p>at the same time I can</p>
<p>understand hear me out but</p>
<p>she goes on to say that there&rsquo;s just like no evidence</p>
<p>to prove this like from us</p>
<p>standing back judging it&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>there is they obviously know something like come on</p>
<p>from the legal</p>
<p>standpoint there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no fingerprints</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no blood on anyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clothes there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>trace of them hiding something there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no weapon found anywhere but there&rsquo;s no drugs</p>
<p>found anywhere like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally nothing</p>
<p>pointing back</p>
<p>to the guys</p>
<p>you know this judge</p>
<p>goes on to say</p>
<p>that she believes they know what happened and</p>
<p>they know a lot more than what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>but she can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>charge them on this because there&rsquo;s just no proof</p>
<p>there have been no charges</p>
<p>placed for robert&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>the 3 guys in the house</p>
<p>stand by the fact that they believe somebody</p>
<p>broke into the house</p>
<p>they stabbed</p>
<p>Robert they ran out whoever they</p>
<p>were that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>stand by there are so many theories on this</p>
<p>case it&rsquo;s overwhelming so all the guys in the house</p>
<p>they swear that</p>
<p>an intruder came in and killed him police believe that</p>
<p>Vic was upstairs at the very top</p>
<p>sleeping watching Project</p>
<p>Runway or whatever</p>
<p>but that Dylan</p>
<p>and Joe wanted to engage</p>
<p>in sexual activity</p>
<p>with Robert</p>
<p>and maybe perhaps</p>
<p>Robert declined and it made them upset</p>
<p>so then they strangled him</p>
<p>they gave him some kind</p>
<p>of drug that like paralyzed him so he couldn&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>and then they performed with that like electric</p>
<p>milking machine</p>
<p>they put it on him and then</p>
<p>stabbed him</p>
<p>so they think there was some kind of like sex problem</p>
<p>happening now even in police interrogations Catherine</p>
<p>Roberts wife</p>
<p>would say that like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>homophobic or anything that by any means</p>
<p>Joe would say that</p>
<p>Robert was very respectful</p>
<p>he was straight as can be he was not interested</p>
<p>in men whatsoever and they</p>
<p>he respected that Joe respected that</p>
<p>Robert wasn&rsquo;t disrespectful or anything like that I</p>
<p>wrote down what I think</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>like a theory as to what happened it&rsquo;s mainly just me</p>
<p>pointing out what the fuck if somebody</p>
<p>broke into the</p>
<p>house this intruder</p>
<p>and the door chimes</p>
<p>boop boop when you walk in somebody walks in</p>
<p>they say everybody says in the</p>
<p>house that they</p>
<p>heard it how come</p>
<p>nobody heard the</p>
<p>boop boop when the intruder</p>
<p>left the house</p>
<p>nobody reports</p>
<p>that the doors were open anywhere so there</p>
<p>should have been a boop boop boop</p>
<p>when somebody left the house</p>
<p>nobody reports hearing that my</p>
<p>second question is</p>
<p>if there was an intruder that came in to kill Robert</p>
<p>why the f didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>this intruder take anything there was plenty of</p>
<p>stuff to be</p>
<p>stolen that</p>
<p>night also why</p>
<p>would they go in just to kill</p>
<p>Robert I&rsquo;m about to get a little bit confusing</p>
<p>again I apologize</p>
<p>when you go into this</p>
<p>house you go up the</p>
<p>stairs and directly</p>
<p>like in front of the</p>
<p>staircase is a door and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dylan&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>go past that down like the hallway a little bit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another door</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>Robert was staying</p>
<p>so if there was an intruder that came into the</p>
<p>house went up the</p>
<p>stairs why wouldn&rsquo;t this intruder just go directly into</p>
<p>dylan&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>cause it was</p>
<p>right there why</p>
<p>would this intruder be like nah</p>
<p>not this door</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go down here and then go down and go to</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s room let&rsquo;s just say that they are</p>
<p>right and there was an intruder that came</p>
<p>to kill Robert</p>
<p>it would have to be somebody that knew</p>
<p>Robert was there in the</p>
<p>first place the only person who knew</p>
<p>Robert was there</p>
<p>was his wife and the guys in the</p>
<p>house reportedly</p>
<p>they did like a</p>
<p>background check on</p>
<p>Robert to determine</p>
<p>if anybody maybe</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like him</p>
<p>wanted him dead</p>
<p>anything and then couldn&rsquo;t find anything</p>
<p>it just makes you</p>
<p>think okay it</p>
<p>would have to be somebody</p>
<p>who wanted him</p>
<p>dead because they went specifically to his room</p>
<p>killed him and then got the F out of there</p>
<p>the boys upstairs</p>
<p>in the master bedroom they said that they</p>
<p>heard a scream</p>
<p>right like a</p>
<p>muffled scream</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know like where the</p>
<p>scream came from but</p>
<p>they got up to investigate so why did they run</p>
<p>directly to</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>because none of them say like I heard a</p>
<p>scream coming from</p>
<p>robert&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>but say they just</p>
<p>maybe felt like let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>check robert&rsquo;s room so they</p>
<p>check robert&rsquo;s room and they see that he stabbed</p>
<p>how come nobody ran</p>
<p>to check on</p>
<p>Dylan to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stabbed to I mean</p>
<p>oh my God an intruder just came in</p>
<p>and stabbed my friend I gotta go</p>
<p>check to make sure my other</p>
<p>lover isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stabbed nobody</p>
<p>checked on Dylan</p>
<p>so like that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>weird so if there was an intruder</p>
<p>why the Afton they killed</p>
<p>Dylan too and</p>
<p>steal money and</p>
<p>steal everything like it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense and where was the boo boo</p>
<p>and like everything happened in such a quick time</p>
<p>frame like let&rsquo;s say they did have some kind of sexual</p>
<p>relationship going with Robert</p>
<p>it all seemed to happen so</p>
<p>quick like 45 minutes</p>
<p>to clean up a</p>
<p>whole crime scene is weird</p>
<p>do you think</p>
<p>maybe he was</p>
<p>stabbed in the shower</p>
<p>but why did they wanna stab it what was the motive</p>
<p>man there are so many unanswered questions</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very worked up</p>
<p>anyways I hope we have a really good day</p>
<p>today you make good choices</p>
<p>be safe out there and try and</p>
<p>solve this mystery</p>
<p>yet why do they call it a milking machine oh</p>
<p>I get it</p>
