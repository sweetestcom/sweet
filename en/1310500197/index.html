    <p>The following is a conversation with Rob Reed, entrepreneur, author, and host of the After</p>
<p>On Podcast.</p>
<p>Sam Harris recommended that I absolutely must talk to Rob about his recent work on the</p>
<p>future of engineer pandemics.</p>
<p>I then listened to the 4 hours special episode of Sam&rsquo;s Making Sense podcast with Rob titled</p>
<p>Engineering the Apocalypse, and I was floored, and knew I had to talk to him.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Athletic Greens, Belcampo, Fundrise, and NetSuite.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say a few words about the lab leak hypothesis, which proposes that</p>
<p>COVID 19 is a product of gain of function research on coronaviruses conducted at the</p>
<p>Wuhan Institute of Virology that was then accidentally leaked due to human error.</p>
<p>For context, this lab is biosafety level 4, BSL 4, and it investigates coronaviruses.</p>
<p>BSL 4 is the highest level of safety, but if you look at all the human in the loop pieces</p>
<p>required to achieve this level of safety, it becomes clear that even BSL 4 labs are</p>
<p>highly susceptible to human error.</p>
<p>To me, whether the virus leaked from the lab or not, getting to the bottom of what happened</p>
<p>is about much more than this particular catastrophic case.</p>
<p>It is a test for our scientific, political, journalistic, and social institutions of how</p>
<p>well we can prepare and respond to threats that can cripple or destroy human civilization.</p>
<p>If we continue gain of function research on viruses, eventually these viruses will leak,</p>
<p>and they will be more deadly and more contagious.</p>
<p>We can pretend that won&rsquo;t happen, or we can openly and honestly talk about the risks involved.</p>
<p>This research can both save and destroy human life on earth as we know it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful double edged sword.</p>
<p>If YouTube and other platforms censor conversations about this, if scientists self censor conversations</p>
<p>about this, we&rsquo;ll become merely victims of our brief homo sapiens story, not its heroes.</p>
<p>As I said before, too carelessly labeling ideas as misinformation and dismissing them</p>
<p>because of that will eventually destroy our ability to discover the truth, and without</p>
<p>truth we don&rsquo;t have a fighting chance against the great filter before us.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Rob Reid.</p>
<p>I have seen evidence on the internet that you have a sense of humor, allegedly, but</p>
<p>you also talk and think about the destruction of human civilization.</p>
<p>What do you think of the Elon Musk hypothesis that the most entertaining outcome is the</p>
<p>most likely?</p>
<p>And he, I think, followed on to say a scene from an external observer, like if somebody</p>
<p>was watching us, it seems we come up with creative ways of progressing our civilization</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fun to watch.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he, exactly, he said from the standpoint of the observer, not the participant, I think.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s interesting about that, those were, I think, just a couple of freestanding</p>
<p>tweets and delivered without a whole lot of wrapper of context, so it&rsquo;s left to the mind</p>
<p>of the reader of the tweets to infer what he was talking about.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of like, it provokes some interesting thoughts.</p>
<p>Like first of all, it presupposes the existence of an observer, and it also presupposes that</p>
<p>the observer wishes to be entertained and has some mechanism of enforcing their desire</p>
<p>to be entertained.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a lot underpinning that.</p>
<p>And to me, that suggests, particularly coming from Elon, that it&rsquo;s a reference to simulation</p>
<p>theory, that somebody is out there and has far greater insights and a far greater ability</p>
<p>to, let&rsquo;s say, peer into a single individual life and find that entertaining and full of</p>
<p>plot twists and surprises and either a happy or tragic ending, or they have an incredible</p>
<p>meta view and they can watch the arc of civilization unfolding in a way that is entertaining and</p>
<p>full of plot twists and surprises and a happy or unhappy ending.</p>
<p>So okay, so we&rsquo;re presupposing an observer.</p>
<p>Then on top of that, when you think about it, you&rsquo;re also presupposing a producer,</p>
<p>because the act of observation is mostly fun if there are plot twists and surprises and</p>
<p>other developments that you weren&rsquo;t foreseeing.</p>
<p>I have reread my own novels, and that&rsquo;s fun because it&rsquo;s something that I worked hard</p>
<p>on and I slaved over and I love, but there aren&rsquo;t a lot of surprises in there.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m thinking we need a producer and an observer for that to be true.</p>
<p>And on top of that, it&rsquo;s got to be a very competent producer because Elon said the most</p>
<p>entertaining outcome is the most likely one.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots of layers for thinking about that.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;ve got a producer who&rsquo;s trying to make it entertaining, it makes me think</p>
<p>of there was a South Park episode in which Earth turned out to be a reality show.</p>
<p>And somehow we had failed to entertain the audience as much as we used to, so the Earth</p>
<p>show was going to get canceled, et cetera.</p>
<p>So taking all that together, and I&rsquo;m obviously being a little bit playful in laying this</p>
<p>out, what is the evidence that we have that we are in a reality that is intended to be</p>
<p>most entertaining?</p>
<p>Now you could look at that reality on the level of individual lives or the whole arc</p>
<p>of civilization, other lives, levels as well, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>But just looking from my own life, I think I&rsquo;d make a pretty lousy show.</p>
<p>I spend an inordinate amount of time just looking at a computer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s very entertaining.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just a completely inadequate level of shootouts and car chases in my life.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll go weeks, even months without a single shootout or car chase.</p>
<p>That just means that you&rsquo;re one of the non player characters in this game.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just waiting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an extra.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an extra that waiting for your one opportunity for a brief moment to actually</p>
<p>interact with one of the main characters in the play.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So okay, so we rule out me being the star of the show, which I probably could have guessed</p>
<p>at.</p>
<p>Anyway, but then even the arc of civilization, I mean, there have been a lot of really intriguing</p>
<p>things that have happened and a lot of astounding things that have happened.</p>
<p>But I would have some werewolves, I&rsquo;d have some zombies, I would have some really improbable</p>
<p>developments like maybe Canada absorbing the United States.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not sure if we&rsquo;re necessarily designed for maximum entertainment.</p>
<p>But if we are, that will mean that 2020 is just a prequel for even more bizarre years</p>
<p>ahead.</p>
<p>So I kind of hope that we&rsquo;re not designed for maximum entertainment.</p>
<p>Well, the night is still young in terms of Canada.</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s possible for the observer and the producer to be kind of emergent?</p>
<p>So meaning, it does seem when you kind of watch memes on the internet, the funny ones,</p>
<p>the entertaining ones spread more efficiently.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what it is about the human mind that soaks up on mass funny things</p>
<p>much more sort of aggressively.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more viral in the full sense of that word.</p>
<p>Is there some sense that whatever the evolutionary process that created our cognitive capabilities</p>
<p>is the same process that&rsquo;s going to, in an emergent way, create the most entertaining</p>
<p>outcome, the most memeifiable outcome, the most viral outcome if we were to share it</p>
<p>on Twitter?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do have an incredible ability.</p>
<p>Like I mean, how many memes are created in a given day and the ones that go viral are</p>
<p>almost uniformly funny, at least to somebody with a particular sense of humor.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d have to think about that.</p>
<p>We are definitely great at creating atomized units of funny.</p>
<p>Like in the example that you used, there are going to be X million brains parsing and judging</p>
<p>whether this meme is retweetable or not.</p>
<p>And so that sort of atomic element of funniness, of entertainingness, et cetera, we definitely</p>
<p>have an environment that&rsquo;s good at selecting for that and selective pressure and everything</p>
<p>else that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But in terms of the entire ecosystem of conscious systems here on the Earth driving for a level</p>
<p>of entertainment, that is on such a much higher level that I don&rsquo;t know if that would necessarily</p>
<p>follow directly from the fact that atomic units of entertainment are very, very aptly</p>
<p>selected for us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Do you find it compelling or useful to think about human civilization from the perspective</p>
<p>of the ideas versus the perspective of the individual human brains?</p>
<p>Just almost thinking about the ideas or the memes.</p>
<p>This is the Dawkins thing as the organisms and then the humans as just like vehicles</p>
<p>for briefly carrying those organisms as they jump around and spread.</p>
<p>Yeah, for propagating them, mutating them, putting selective pressure on them, et cetera.</p>
<p>I mean, I found Dawkins interpret or his launching of the idea of memes is just kind of an afterthought</p>
<p>to his unbelievably brilliant book about the selfish gene.</p>
<p>What a PS to put at the end of a long chunk of writing, profoundly interesting.</p>
<p>I view the relationship though between humans and memes as probably an oversimplification,</p>
<p>but maybe a little bit like the relationship between flowers and bees, right?</p>
<p>Do flowers have bees or do bees in a sense have flowers?</p>
<p>And the answer is it is a very, very symbiotic relationship in which both have semi independent</p>
<p>roles that they play and both are highly dependent upon the other.</p>
<p>And so in the case of bees, obviously, you could see the flower is being this monolithic</p>
<p>structure physically in relation to any given bee and it&rsquo;s the source of food and sustenance.</p>
<p>So you could kind of say, well, flowers have bees.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the flowers would obviously be doomed.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t being pollinated by the bees.</p>
<p>So you could kind of say, well, you know, bees are, you know, flowers are really expression</p>
<p>of what the bees need.</p>
<p>And the truth is a symbiosis.</p>
<p>So with, with memes and human minds, our brains are clearly the Petri dishes in which memes</p>
<p>are either propagated or not propagated, get mutated or don&rsquo;t get mutated if they are the</p>
<p>venue in which competition, selective competition plays out between different memes.</p>
<p>So all of that is very true.</p>
<p>And you could look at that and say, really, the human mind is a production of memes and</p>
<p>ideas have us rather than us having ideas.</p>
<p>But at the same time, let&rsquo;s take a catchy tune as an example of a meme.</p>
<p>That catchy tune did originate in a human mind.</p>
<p>Somebody had to structure that thing.</p>
<p>And as much as I like Elizabeth Gilbert&rsquo;s TED talk about how the universe, I&rsquo;m simplifying,</p>
<p>but you know, kind of the ideas find their way in this beautiful TED talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very lyrical.</p>
<p>She talked about, you know, ideas and prose kind of beaming into our minds.</p>
<p>And you know, she talked about needing to pull over to the side of the road when she</p>
<p>got inspiration for a particular paragraph or a particular idea and a burning need to</p>
<p>write that down.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that beautiful as a writer, as a novelist myself, I&rsquo;ve never had that experience.</p>
<p>And I think that really most things that do become memes are the product of a great deal</p>
<p>of deliberate and willful exertion of a conscious mind.</p>
<p>And so like the bees and the flowers, I think there&rsquo;s a great symbiosis and they both kind</p>
<p>of have one another.</p>
<p>Ideas have us, but we have ideas for real.</p>
<p>If we could take a little bit of a tangent, Stephen King on writing, you as a great writer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dropping a hint here that the ideas don&rsquo;t come to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a grind of sort of, it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re mining for gold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a very deliberate, rigorous daily process.</p>
<p>So maybe can you talk about the writing process?</p>
<p>How do you write well?</p>
<p>And maybe if you want to step outside of yourself, almost like give advice to an aspiring writer,</p>
<p>what does it take to write the best work of your life?</p>
<p>Well it would be very different if it&rsquo;s fiction versus nonfiction.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done both.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written two nonfiction books and two works of fiction.</p>
<p>Two works of fiction being more recent, I&rsquo;m going to focus on that right now because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more toweringly on my mind.</p>
<p>Bronx novelists, again, this is an oversimplification, but there&rsquo;s kind of two schools of thought.</p>
<p>Some people really like to fly by the seat of their pants and some people really, really</p>
<p>like to outline, to plot.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s plotters and pantsers, I guess is one way that people look at it.</p>
<p>And as with most things, there is a great continuum in between and I&rsquo;m somewhere on</p>
<p>that continuum, but I lean, I guess, a little bit more toward the plotter.</p>
<p>And so when I do start a novel, I have a pretty strong point of view about how it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to end and I have a very strong point of view about how it&rsquo;s going to begin.</p>
<p>And I do try to make an effort of making an outline that I know I&rsquo;m going to be extremely</p>
<p>unfaithful to in the actual execution of the story, but trying to make an outline that</p>
<p>gets us from here to there and notion of subplots and beats and rhythm and different characters</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>But then when I get into the process, that outline, particularly the center of it, ultimately</p>
<p>inevitably morphs a great deal.</p>
<p>And I think if I were personally a rigorous outliner, I would not allow that to happen.</p>
<p>I also would make a much more vigorous skeleton before I start.</p>
<p>So I think people who are really in that plotting outlining mode are people who write page turners,</p>
<p>people who write spy novels or supernatural adventures, where you really want a relentless</p>
<p>pace of events, action, plot twists, conspiracy, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that is really the bone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the skeletal structure.</p>
<p>So I think folks who write that kind of book are really very much on the outlining side.</p>
<p>And then I think people who write what&rsquo;s often referred to as literary fiction for lack of</p>
<p>a better term, where it&rsquo;s more about sort of aura and ambiance and character development</p>
<p>and experience and inner experience and inner journey and so forth, I think that group is</p>
<p>more likely to fly by the seat of their pants.</p>
<p>And I know people who start with a blank page and just see where it&rsquo;s going to go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit more on the plotting side.</p>
<p>Now you asked what makes something, at least in the mind of the writer, as great as it</p>
<p>can be.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s an astonishingly high percentage of it is editing as opposed to the initial</p>
<p>writing.</p>
<p>For every hour that I spend writing new prose, like new pages, new paragraphs, new bits of</p>
<p>the book, I probably spend&hellip;</p>
<p>I wish I kept a count.</p>
<p>I wish I had one of those pieces of software that lawyers use to decide how much time I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to be doing this, that.</p>
<p>But I would say it&rsquo;s at least four or five hours and maybe as many as 10 that I spend</p>
<p>editing.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s relentless for me.</p>
<p>For each one hour of writing, you said?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that.</p>
<p>Four, wow.</p>
<p>I mean, I write because I edit and I spend just relentlessly polishing and pruning and</p>
<p>sometimes on the micro level of just like, does the rhythm of the sentence feel right?</p>
<p>Do I need to carve a syllable or something so it can land?</p>
<p>Like as micro as that to as macro as like, okay, I&rsquo;m done but the book is 750 pages long</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s way too bloated and I need to lop a third out of it.</p>
<p>Problems on those two orders of magnitude and everything in between, that is an enormous</p>
<p>amount of my time.</p>
<p>And I also write music, write and record and produce music.</p>
<p>And there the ratio is even higher.</p>
<p>Every minute that I spend or my band spends laying down that original audio, it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>high proportion of hours that go into just making it all hang together and sound just</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s true of a lot of creative processes.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s true of sculpture.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s true of woodwork.</p>
<p>My dad was an amateur woodworker and he spent a huge amount of time on sanding and polishing</p>
<p>at the end.</p>
<p>So I think a great deal of the sparkle comes from that part of the process, any creative</p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>Can I ask about the psychological, the demon side of that picture?</p>
<p>In the editing process, you&rsquo;re ultimately judging the initial piece of work and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>judging and judging and judging.</p>
<p>How much of your time do you spend hating your work?</p>
<p>How much time do you spend in gratitude, impressed, thankful, or how good the work that you will</p>
<p>put together is?</p>
<p>I spend almost all the time in a place that&rsquo;s intermediate between those, but leaning toward</p>
<p>gratitude.</p>
<p>I spend almost all the time in a state of optimism that this thing that I have, I like,</p>
<p>I like quite a bit and I can make it better and better and better with every time I go</p>
<p>through it.</p>
<p>So I spend most of my time in a state of optimism.</p>
<p>I think I personally oscillate much more aggressively between those two, where I wouldn&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to find the average.</p>
<p>I go pretty deep.</p>
<p>Marvin Minsky from MIT had this advice, I guess, to what it takes to be successful in</p>
<p>science and research is to hate everything you do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve ever done in the past.</p>
<p>I mean, at least he was speaking about himself that the key to his success was to hate everything</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s ever done.</p>
<p>I have a little Marvin Minsky there in me too, to sort of always be exceptionally self</p>
<p>critical, but almost like self critical about the work, but grateful for the chance to be</p>
<p>able to do the work.</p>
<p>If that makes sense.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>But that, you know, each one of us have to strike a certain kind of balance.</p>
<p>But back to the destruction of human civilization.</p>
<p>If humans destroy ourselves in the next hundred years, what will be the most likely source,</p>
<p>the most likely reason that we destroy ourselves?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see, a hundred years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to comfortably predict out that far, and it&rsquo;s something to give a lot</p>
<p>more thought to, I think, than normal folks simply because I am a science fiction writer.</p>
<p>And you know, I feel with the acceleration of technological progress, it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to foresee out more than just a few decades.</p>
<p>I mean, comparing today&rsquo;s world to that of 1921, where we are right now, a century later,</p>
<p>it would have been so unforeseeable.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen, particularly with exponential technologies.</p>
<p>I mean, our intuitions reliably defeat ourselves with exponential technologies like computing</p>
<p>and synthetic biology and, you know, how we might destroy ourselves in the hundred year</p>
<p>time frame might have everything to do with breakthroughs in nanotechnology 40 years from</p>
<p>now and then how rapidly those breakthroughs accelerate.</p>
<p>But in the near term that I&rsquo;m comfortable predicting, let&rsquo;s say 30 years, I would say</p>
<p>the most likely route to self destruction would be synthetic biology.</p>
<p>And I always say that with the gigantic caveat and very important one that I find, and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>abbreviate synthetic biology to SynBio just to save us some syllables.</p>
<p>I believe SynBio offers us simply stunning promise that we would be fools to deny ourselves.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not an anti SynBio person by any stretch.</p>
<p>I mean, SynBio has unbelievable odds of helping us beat cancer, helping us rescue the environment,</p>
<p>helping us do things that we would currently find imponderable.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s electrifying the field.</p>
<p>But in the wrong hands, those hands either being incompetent or being malevolent.</p>
<p>In the wrong hands, synthetic biology to me has a much, much greater odds of leading to</p>
<p>our self destruction than something running amok with super AI, which I believe is a real</p>
<p>possibility and one we need to be concerned about.</p>
<p>But in the 30 year time frame, I think it&rsquo;s a lesser one or nuclear weapons or anything</p>
<p>else that I can think of.</p>
<p>Can you explain that a little bit further?</p>
<p>So your concern is on the manmade versus the natural side of the pandemic frontier.</p>
<p>So we humans, engineering pathogens, engineering viruses is the concern here.</p>
<p>And maybe how do you see the possible trajectories happening here in terms of, is it malevolent</p>
<p>or is it accidents, oops, little mistakes or unintended consequences of particular actions</p>
<p>that are ultimately lead to unexpected mistakes?</p>
<p>Well, both of them are a danger.</p>
<p>And I think the question of which is more likely has to do with two things.</p>
<p>One, do we take a lot of methodical, affordable, foresighted steps that we are absolutely capable</p>
<p>of taking right now to forestall the risk of a bad actor infecting us with something</p>
<p>that could have annihilating impacts?</p>
<p>And in the episode you referenced with Sam, we talked a great deal about that.</p>
<p>So do we take those steps?</p>
<p>And if we take those steps, I think the danger of malevolent rogue actors doing us in with</p>
<p>Sin Bio couldn&rsquo;t plummet.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s always a question of if and we have a bad, bad and very long track</p>
<p>record of hitting the snooze bar after different natural pandemics have attacked us.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s variable number one.</p>
<p>Variable number two is how much experimentation and pathogen development do we as a society</p>
<p>decide is acceptable in the realms of academia, government or private industry?</p>
<p>And if we decide as a society that it&rsquo;s perfectly okay for people with varying research agendas</p>
<p>to create pathogens that if released could wipe out humanity, if we think that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>and if that kind of work starts happening in one lab, five labs, 50 labs, 500 labs in</p>
<p>one country, then 10 countries, then 70 countries or whatever, that risk of a boo boo starts</p>
<p>rising astronomically.</p>
<p>And this won&rsquo;t be a spoiler alert based on the way that I presented those two things,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s unbelievably important to manage both of those risks.</p>
<p>The easier one to manage, although it wouldn&rsquo;t be simple by any stretch because it would</p>
<p>have to be something that all nations agree on.</p>
<p>But the easiest way, the easier risk to manage is that of, hey guys, let&rsquo;s not develop pathogens</p>
<p>that if they escaped from a lab could annihilate us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no line of research that justifies that.</p>
<p>And in my view, I mean, that&rsquo;s the point of perspective we need to have.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d have to collectively agree that there&rsquo;s no line of research that justifies that.</p>
<p>The reason why I believe that would be a highly rational conclusion is even the highest level</p>
<p>of biosafety lab in the world, biosafety lab level four.</p>
<p>And there are not a lot of BSL four labs in the world.</p>
<p>There are things can and have leaked out of BSL four labs and some of the work that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been done with potentially annihilating pathogens, which we can talk about, it&rsquo;s actually done</p>
<p>at BSL three.</p>
<p>And so fundamentally any lab can leak.</p>
<p>We have proven ourselves to be incapable of creating a lab that is utterly impervious</p>
<p>to leaks.</p>
<p>So why in the world would we create something where if God forbid it leaked, could annihilate</p>
<p>us all.</p>
<p>And by the way, almost all of the measures that are taken in biosafety level anything</p>
<p>labs are designed to prevent accidental leaks.</p>
<p>What happens if you have a malevolent insider?</p>
<p>We could talk about the psychology and the motivations of what would make a malevolent</p>
<p>insider who wants to release something and not annihilating in a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that we will.</p>
<p>But what if you have a malevolent insider?</p>
<p>Virtually none of the standards that go into biosafety level one, two, three, and four</p>
<p>are about preventing somebody hijacking the process.</p>
<p>Some of them are, but they&rsquo;re mainly designed against accidents.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re imperfect against accidents.</p>
<p>And if this kind of work starts happening in lots and lots of labs with every lab you</p>
<p>add, the odds of there being a malevolent inside are naturally increased arithmetically</p>
<p>as the number of labs goes up.</p>
<p>Now on the front of somebody outside of a government academic or scientific, traditional</p>
<p>government, academic, scientific environment creating something malevolent, again, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>protections that we can take both at the level of syn bio architecture, hardening the entire</p>
<p>syn bio ecosystem against terrible things being made that we don&rsquo;t want to have out</p>
<p>there by rogue actors, to early detection, to lots and lots of other things that we can</p>
<p>do to dramatically mitigate that risk.</p>
<p>And I think we do both of those things, decide that no, we&rsquo;re not going to experimentally</p>
<p>make annihilating pathogens in leaky labs, and B, yes, we are going to take countermeasures</p>
<p>that are going to cost a fraction of our annual defense budget to preclude their creation,</p>
<p>then I think both risks get managed down.</p>
<p>But if you take one set of precautions and not the other, then the thing that you have</p>
<p>not taken precautions against immediately becomes the more likely outcome.</p>
<p>So can we talk about this kind of research and what&rsquo;s actually done and what are the</p>
<p>positives and negatives of it?</p>
<p>So if we look at gain of function research and the kind of stuff that&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>level three and level four BSL labs, what&rsquo;s the whole idea here?</p>
<p>Is it trying to engineer viruses to understand how they behave?</p>
<p>You want to understand the dangerous ones.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that would be the logic behind doing it.</p>
<p>And so gain of function can mean a lot of different things.</p>
<p>Viewed through a certain lens, gain of function research could be what you do when you create,</p>
<p>you know, GMOs, when you create, you know, hearty strains of corn that are resistant</p>
<p>to pesticides.</p>
<p>I mean, you could view that as gain of function.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to refer to gain of function in a relatively narrow sense, which is actually</p>
<p>the sense that the term is usually used, which is in some way magnifying capabilities of</p>
<p>microorganisms to make them more dangerous, whether it&rsquo;s more transmissible or more deadly.</p>
<p>And in that line of research, I&rsquo;ll use an example from 2011 because it&rsquo;s very illustrative</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also very chilling.</p>
<p>Back in 2011, two separate labs independently of one another, I assume there was some kind</p>
<p>of communication between them, but they were basically independent projects, one in Holland</p>
<p>and one in Wisconsin, did gain of function research on something called H5N1 flu.</p>
<p>H5N1 is, you know, something that, at least on a lethality basis, makes COVID look like</p>
<p>a kitten.</p>
<p>You know, COVID, according to the World Health Organization, has a case fatality rate somewhere</p>
<p>between half a percent and one percent, H5N1 is closer to 60 percent, six zero.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s actually even slightly more lethal than Ebola.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, very, very scary pathogen.</p>
<p>The good news about H5N1 is that it is barely, barely contagious.</p>
<p>But I believe it is in no way contagious human to human.</p>
<p>It requires, you know, very, very, very deep contact with birds, in most cases chickens.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re a chicken farmer and you spend an enormous amount of time around them</p>
<p>and perhaps you get into situations in which you get a break in your skin and you&rsquo;re interacting</p>
<p>intensely with fowl who, as it turns out, have H5N1, that&rsquo;s when the jump comes.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s no airborne transmission that we&rsquo;re aware of human to human.</p>
<p>I mean, not that it just doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I think the World Health Organization did a relentless survey of the number of H5N1</p>
<p>cases.</p>
<p>I think they do it every year.</p>
<p>I saw one 10 year series where I think it was like 500 fatalities over the course of</p>
<p>a decade.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>Kind of fun, fun fact, I believe the typical lethality from lightning over 10 years is</p>
<p>70,000 deaths.</p>
<p>So we think getting struck by lightning, pretty low risk, H5N1 much, much lower than that.</p>
<p>What happened in these experiments is the experimenters in both cases set out to make</p>
<p>H5N1 that would be contagious, that could create airborne transmission.</p>
<p>And so they basically passed it, I think in both cases, they passed it through a large</p>
<p>number of ferrets.</p>
<p>And so this wasn&rsquo;t like CRISPR, there wasn&rsquo;t even any CRISPR back in those days.</p>
<p>This was relatively straightforward, selecting for a particular outcome.</p>
<p>And after guiding the path and passing them through, again, I believe it was a series</p>
<p>of ferrets.</p>
<p>They did in fact come up with a version of H5N1 that is capable of airborne transmission.</p>
<p>Now they didn&rsquo;t unleash it into the world.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t inject it into humans to see what would happen.</p>
<p>And so for those two reasons, we don&rsquo;t really know how contagious it might have been.</p>
<p>But if it was as contagious as COVID, that could be a civilization threatening pathogen.</p>
<p>And why would you do it?</p>
<p>Well, the people who did it were good guys.</p>
<p>They were virologists.</p>
<p>I believe their agenda as they explained it was much as you said, let&rsquo;s figure out what</p>
<p>a worst case scenario might look like so we can understand it better.</p>
<p>But my understanding is in both cases, it was done in BSL3 labs.</p>
<p>And so potential of leak, significantly nonzero, hopefully way below 1% but significantly nonzero.</p>
<p>And when you look at the consequences of an escape in terms of human lives, destruction</p>
<p>of a large portion of the economy, et cetera, and you do an expected value calculation on</p>
<p>whatever fraction of 1% that was, you would come up with a staggering cost, staggering</p>
<p>expected cost for this work.</p>
<p>So it should never have been carried out.</p>
<p>Now you might make an argument if you said, if you believed that H5N1 in nature is on</p>
<p>an inevitable path to airborne transmission, and it&rsquo;s only going to be a small number of</p>
<p>years, A. And B, if it makes that transition, there is one set of changes to its metabolic</p>
<p>pathways and its genomic code and so forth, one that we have discovered.</p>
<p>So it is going to go from point A, which is where it is right now, to point B. We have</p>
<p>reliably engineered point B. That is the destination.</p>
<p>And we need to start fighting that right now because this is five years or less away.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;d be a very different world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be like spotting an asteroid that&rsquo;s coming toward the earth and is five years</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>And yes, you marshal everything you can to resist that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s two problems with that perspective.</p>
<p>The first is, in however many thousands of generations that humans have been inhabiting</p>
<p>this planet, there has never been a transmissible form of H5N1.</p>
<p>And influenza has been around for a very long time.</p>
<p>So there is no case for inevitability of this kind of a jump to airborne transmission.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not on a freight train to that outcome.</p>
<p>And if there was inevitability around that, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s just one set of genetic</p>
<p>code that would get there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of different mutations that could conceivably result in that kind of an</p>
<p>outcome, unbelievable diversity of mutations.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re not actually creating something we&rsquo;re inevitably going to face, but we are</p>
<p>creating something, we are creating a very powerful and unbelievably negative card and</p>
<p>injecting it in the deck that nature never put into the deck.</p>
<p>So in that case, I just don&rsquo;t see any moral or scientific justification for that kind</p>
<p>of work.</p>
<p>And interestingly, there was quite a bit of excitement and concern about this when the</p>
<p>work came out.</p>
<p>One of the teams was going to publish their results in Science, the other in Nature.</p>
<p>And there were a lot of editorials and a lot of scientists are saying, this is crazy.</p>
<p>And publication of those papers did get suspended.</p>
<p>And not long after that, there was a pause put on US government funding, NIH funding</p>
<p>on gain of function research.</p>
<p>But both of those speed bumps were ultimately removed.</p>
<p>Those papers did ultimately get published.</p>
<p>And that pause on funding, you know, ceased long ago.</p>
<p>And in fact, those two very projects, my understanding is resumed their funding, got their government</p>
<p>funding back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why a Dutch project is getting NIH funding, but whatever, about a year and</p>
<p>a half ago.</p>
<p>So as far as the US government and regulators are concerned, it&rsquo;s all systems go for gain</p>
<p>of function at this point, which I find very troubling.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a little bit of an outsider from this field, but it has echoes of the same kind</p>
<p>of problem I see in the AI world with autonomous weapon systems.</p>
<p>Nobody in my colleagues, my colleagues, friends, as far as I can tell, people in the AI community</p>
<p>are not really talking about autonomous weapon systems as now US and China full steam ahead</p>
<p>on the development of both.</p>
<p>And that seems to be a similar kind of thing on gain of function.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, you know, have friends in the biology space and they don&rsquo;t want to talk about gain</p>
<p>of function publicly.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, that makes me very uncomfortable from an outsider perspective in terms of gain</p>
<p>of function.</p>
<p>It makes me very uncomfortable from the insider perspective on autonomous weapon systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how to communicate exactly about autonomous weapon systems.</p>
<p>And I certainly don&rsquo;t know how to communicate effectively about gain of function.</p>
<p>What is the right path forward here?</p>
<p>Could we seize all gain of function research?</p>
<p>Is that, is that really the solution here?</p>
<p>Well, again, I&rsquo;m going to use gain of function in the relatively narrow context of over assessing</p>
<p>because you could say almost, you know, anything that you do to make biology more effective</p>
<p>as gain of function.</p>
<p>So within the narrow confines of what we&rsquo;re discussing, I think it would be easy enough</p>
<p>for level headed people in all of the countries, level headed governmental people in all the</p>
<p>countries that realistically could support such a program to agree, we don&rsquo;t want this</p>
<p>to happen because all labs leak.</p>
<p>I mean, and you know, an example that I use, I actually didn&rsquo;t use it in the piece I did</p>
<p>with Sam Harris as well, is the anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001.</p>
<p>I mean, talk about an example of the least likely lab leaking into the least likely place.</p>
<p>This was shortly after 9 11, folks who don&rsquo;t remember it, and it was a very, very lethal</p>
<p>strand of anthrax that as it turned out, based on the forensic genomic work that was done</p>
<p>and so forth, absolutely leaked from a high security US army lab.</p>
<p>Probably the one at Fort Detrick in Maryland, it might&rsquo;ve been another one, but who cares?</p>
<p>It absolutely leaked from a high security US army lab.</p>
<p>And where did it leak to?</p>
<p>This highly dangerous substance that was kept under lock and key by a very security minded</p>
<p>organization?</p>
<p>Well, it leaked to places including the Senate majority leader&rsquo;s office, Tom Daschle&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>I think it was Senator Leahy&rsquo;s office, certain publications, including bizarrely the National</p>
<p>Enquirer.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go to the Senate majority leader&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine a more security minded country than the United States two weeks after</p>
<p>the 9 11 attack.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t get more security minded than that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also hard to imagine a more security capable organization than the United States</p>
<p>military.</p>
<p>We can joke all we want about inefficiencies in the military and $24,000 wrenches and so</p>
<p>forth, but pretty capable when it comes to that.</p>
<p>Despite that level of focus and concern and competence, just days after the 9 11 attack,</p>
<p>something comes from the inside of our military industrial compacts and ends up in the office</p>
<p>of someone I believe the Senate majority leader somewhere in the line of presidential succession.</p>
<p>It tells us everything can leak.</p>
<p>So again, think of a level headed conversation between powerful leaders in a diversity of</p>
<p>countries, thinking through like, I can imagine a very simple PowerPoint revealing, just discussing</p>
<p>briefly things like the anthrax leak, things like this foot and mouth disease outbreak</p>
<p>that or leaking that came out of a BSL four level lab in the UK, several other things</p>
<p>talking about the utter virulence that could result from gain of function and say, folks,</p>
<p>can we agree that this just shouldn&rsquo;t happen?</p>
<p>I mean, if we were able to agree on the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which we were by</p>
<p>a weapons convention, which we did agree on, we the world, for the most part, I believe</p>
<p>agreement could be found there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to take people in leadership of a couple of very powerful countries to</p>
<p>get to the consensus amongst them and then to decide we&rsquo;re going to get everybody together</p>
<p>and browbeat them into banning this stuff.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t make it entirely impossible that somebody might do this.</p>
<p>But in well regulated, carefully watched over fiduciary environments like federally funded</p>
<p>academic research, anything going on in the government itself, things going on in companies</p>
<p>that have investors who don&rsquo;t want to go to jail for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>I think that would have a major, major dampening impact on it.</p>
<p>But there is a particular possible catalyst in this time we live in, which is for really</p>
<p>kind of raising the question of gain of function research for the application of virus making</p>
<p>viruses more dangerous.</p>
<p>Is the question of whether COVID leaked from a lab, sort of not even answering that question,</p>
<p>but even asking that question is a very, it seems like a very important question to ask</p>
<p>to catalyze the conversation about whether we should be doing gain of function research.</p>
<p>I mean, from a high level, why do you think people, even colleagues of mine are not comfortable</p>
<p>asking that question?</p>
<p>And two, do you think that the answer could be that it did leak from a lab?</p>
<p>I think the mere possibility that it did leak from a lab is evidence enough, again, for</p>
<p>the hypothetical rational national leaders watching this simple PowerPoint.</p>
<p>If you could put the possibility at 1% and you look at the unbelievable destructive power</p>
<p>that COVID had, that should be an overwhelmingly powerful argument for excluding it.</p>
<p>Now as to whether or not that was a leak, some very, very level, I don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>about all of the factors in the Bayesian analysis and so forth that has gone into people making</p>
<p>the pro argument of that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t pretend to be an expert on that and I don&rsquo;t have a point of view, I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>But what we can say is it is entirely possible for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One is that there is a BSL4 lab in Wuhan, the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s the only BSL4 in China, I could be wrong about that, but it definitely had</p>
<p>a history that alarmed very sophisticated US diplomats and others who were in contact</p>
<p>with the lab and were aware of what it was doing long before COVID hit the world.</p>
<p>And so there are diplomatic cables that have been declassified, I believe one sophisticated</p>
<p>scientist or other observer said that WIV is a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>And I believe it&rsquo;s also been pretty reasonably established that coronaviruses were a topic</p>
<p>of great interest at WIV.</p>
<p>The SARS obviously came out of China and that&rsquo;s a coronavirus that would make an enormous</p>
<p>amount of sense for it to be studied there.</p>
<p>And there is so much opacity about what happened in the early days and weeks after the outbreak</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically been imposed by the Chinese government that we just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So it feels like a substantially or greater than 1% possibility to me looking at it from</p>
<p>the outside.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that one could imagine.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to the realm of thought experiment, not me decreeing this is what happened, but</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re studying coronavirus at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and there is this precedent</p>
<p>of gain of function research that&rsquo;s been done on something that is remarkably uncontagious</p>
<p>to humans, whereas we know coronavirus is contagious to humans, I could definitely&hellip;</p>
<p>And there is this global consensus, certainly was the case two or three years ago when this</p>
<p>work might&rsquo;ve started, there seems to be this global consensus that gain of function is</p>
<p>fine.</p>
<p>The US paused funding for a little while, but paused funding, they never said private</p>
<p>actors couldn&rsquo;t do it, it was just a pause of NIH funding.</p>
<p>And then that pause was lifted.</p>
<p>So again, none of this is irrational.</p>
<p>You could certainly see the folks at WIV saying, gain of function, interesting vector, coronavirus</p>
<p>unlike H5N1, very contagious, we&rsquo;re a nation that has had terrible run ins with coronavirus,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we do a little gain of function on this?</p>
<p>And then like all labs at all levels, one could imagine this lab leaking.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an impossibility and very, very level headed people have said that, who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>looked at it much more deeply do believe in that outcome.</p>
<p>Why is it such a threat to power the idea that it&rsquo;ll leak from a lab?</p>
<p>Why is it so threatening?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t maybe understand this point exactly.</p>
<p>Is it just that as governments and especially the Chinese government is really afraid of</p>
<p>admitting mistakes that everybody makes?</p>
<p>So this is a horrible, like Chernobyl is a good example.</p>
<p>I come from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I mean, well, major mistakes were made in Chernobyl.</p>
<p>I would argue for a lab leak to happen, the scale of the mistake is much smaller, right?</p>
<p>The depth and the breadth of rot that in bureaucracy that led to Chernobyl is much bigger than</p>
<p>anything that could lead to a lab leak, because it could literally just be, I mean, I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s security, very careful security procedures, even in level three labs, but it, I imagine</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me, it&rsquo;s all it takes is the incompetence of a small number of individuals,</p>
<p>one individual on a particular, a couple of weeks, three weeks period, as opposed to a</p>
<p>multi year bureaucratic failure of the entire government.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, certainly the magnitude of mistakes and compounding mistakes that went into Chernobyl</p>
<p>was far, far, far greater, but the consequence of COVID outweighs that, the consequences</p>
<p>of Chernobyl to a tremendous degree.</p>
<p>And I think that particularly authoritarian governments are unbelievably reluctant to</p>
<p>admit to any fallibility whatsoever, and there&rsquo;s a long, long history of that across dozens</p>
<p>and dozens of authoritarian governments, and to be transparent, again, this is in the hypothetical</p>
<p>world in which this was a leak, which again, I don&rsquo;t have, I don&rsquo;t personally have enough</p>
<p>sophistication to have an opinion on the, on the likelihood, but in the hypothetical</p>
<p>world in which it was a leak, the global reaction and the amount of global animus and the amount</p>
<p>of, you know, the decline in global respect that would happen toward China, because every</p>
<p>country suffered massively from this, unbelievable damages in terms of human lives and economic</p>
<p>activity disrupted, the world would in some way present China with that bill.</p>
<p>And when you take on top of that, the natural disinclination for any authoritarian government</p>
<p>to admit any fallibility and tolerate the possibility of any fallibility whatsoever,</p>
<p>and you look at the relative opacity, even though they let a world health organization</p>
<p>group in, you know, a couple of months ago to run around, they didn&rsquo;t give that who group</p>
<p>anywhere near the level of access that would be necessary to definitively say X happened</p>
<p>versus Y.</p>
<p>The level of opacity that surrounds those opening weeks and months of COVID in China,</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If you were to kind of look back at 2020 and maybe broadening it out to future pandemics</p>
<p>that could be much more dangerous, what kind of response, how do we fail in a response</p>
<p>and how could we do better?</p>
<p>So the gain of function research is discussing the question of we should not be creating</p>
<p>viruses that are both exceptionally contagious and exceptionally deadly to humans.</p>
<p>But if it does happen, perhaps the natural evolution, natural mutation, is there interesting</p>
<p>technological responses on the testing side, on the vaccine development side, on the collection</p>
<p>of data or on the basic sort of policy response side or the sociological, the psychological</p>
<p>side?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s all kinds of things.</p>
<p>And most of what I&rsquo;ve thought about and written about and again discussed in that long bit</p>
<p>with Sam is dual use.</p>
<p>So most of the countermeasures that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about and advocating for would be</p>
<p>every bit as effective against zoonotic disease and natural pandemic of some sort as an artificial</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>The risk of an artificial one, even the near term risk of an artificial one, ups the urgency</p>
<p>around these measures immensely, but most of them would be broadly applicable.</p>
<p>And so I think the first thing that we really want to do on a global scale is have a far,</p>
<p>far, far more robust and globally transparent system of detection.</p>
<p>And that can happen on a number of levels.</p>
<p>The most obvious one is just in the blood of people who come into clinics exhibiting</p>
<p>signs of illness.</p>
<p>And we are certainly at a point now where at with relatively minimal investment, we</p>
<p>could develop in clinic diagnostics that would be unbelievably effective at pinpointing what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in almost any disease when somebody walks into a doctor&rsquo;s office or a clinic.</p>
<p>And better than that, this is a little bit further off, but it wouldn&rsquo;t cost tens of</p>
<p>billions in research dollars, it would be a relatively modest and affordable budget</p>
<p>in relation to the threat at home diagnostics that can really, really pinpoint, okay, particularly</p>
<p>with respiratory infections, because that is generally almost universally the mechanism</p>
<p>of transmission for any serious pandemic.</p>
<p>So somebody has a respiratory infection, is it one of the, you know, significantly large</p>
<p>handful of rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and other things that cause common cold?</p>
<p>Or is it influenza?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s influenza, is it influenza A versus B?</p>
<p>Or is it, you know, a small handful of other more exotic but nonetheless sort of common</p>
<p>respiratory infections that are out there?</p>
<p>Having a diagnostic panel to pinpoint all of that stuff, that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s well</p>
<p>within our capabilities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much less a lift than creating mRNA vaccines, which obviously we proved capable</p>
<p>of when we put our minds to it.</p>
<p>So do that on a global basis.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s irrational because the best prototype for this that I&rsquo;m aware</p>
<p>of isn&rsquo;t currently rolling out in Atherton, California, or Fairfield County, Connecticut,</p>
<p>or some other wealthy place.</p>
<p>The best prototype that I&rsquo;m aware of this is rolling out right now in Nigeria.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a project that came out of the Broad Institute, which is, as I&rsquo;m sure you know,</p>
<p>but some listeners may not, is kind of like an academic joint venture between Harvard</p>
<p>and MIT.</p>
<p>The program is called Sentinel.</p>
<p>And their objective is, and their plan is a very well conceived plan, a methodical plan,</p>
<p>is to do just that in areas of Nigeria that are particularly vulnerable to zoonotic diseases</p>
<p>making the jump from animals to humans.</p>
<p>But also there&rsquo;s just an unbelievable public health benefit from that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of a three tier system where clinicians in the field could very rapidly</p>
<p>determine do you have one of the infections of acute interest here, either because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very common in this region, so we want to diagnose as many things as we can at the front</p>
<p>line, or because it&rsquo;s uncommon but unbelievably threatening like Ebola.</p>
<p>So front line worker can make that determination very, very rapidly.</p>
<p>If it comes up as a we don&rsquo;t know, they bump it up to a level that&rsquo;s more like at a fully</p>
<p>configured doctor&rsquo;s office or local hospital.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s still at a we don&rsquo;t know, it gets bumped up to a national level.</p>
<p>And it gets bumped very, very rapidly.</p>
<p>So if this can be done in Nigeria, and it seems that it can be, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any</p>
<p>inhibition for it to happen in most other places.</p>
<p>And it should be affordable from a budgetary standpoint.</p>
<p>And based on Sentinel&rsquo;s budget and adjusting things for things like very different cost</p>
<p>of living, larger population, et cetera, I did a back of the envelope calculation that</p>
<p>doing something like Sentinel in the US would be in the low billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And wealthy countries, middle income countries can&rsquo;t afford such a thing.</p>
<p>Lower income countries should certainly be helped with that.</p>
<p>But start with that level of detection.</p>
<p>And then layer on top of that other interesting things like monitoring search engine traffic,</p>
<p>search engine queries for evidence that strange clusters of symptoms are starting to rise</p>
<p>in different places.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of work done with that.</p>
<p>Most of it kind of academic and experimental, but some of it has been powerful enough to</p>
<p>suggest that this could be a very powerful early warning system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named Bill Lampos at University College London who basically did a very rigorous</p>
<p>analysis that showed that symptom searches reliably predicted COVID outbreaks in the</p>
<p>early days of the pandemic in given countries by as much as 16 days before the evidence</p>
<p>started to accrue at a public health level.</p>
<p>16 days of forewarning can be monumentally important in the early days of an outbreak.</p>
<p>And this is a very, very talented, but nonetheless very resource constrained academic project.</p>
<p>Even if that was something that was done with a NORAD like budget.</p>
<p>So starting with detection, that&rsquo;s something we could do radically, radically better.</p>
<p>So aggregating multiple data sources in order to create something, I mean, this is really</p>
<p>exciting to me, the possibility that I&rsquo;ve heard inklings of creating almost like a weather</p>
<p>map of pathogens, like basically aggregating all of these data sources, scaling many orders</p>
<p>of magnitude up at home testing and all kinds of testing that doesn&rsquo;t just try to test for</p>
<p>the particular pathogen of worry now, but everything like a full spectrum of things</p>
<p>that could be dangerous to the human body.</p>
<p>And thereby be able to create these maps like that are dynamically updated on an hourly</p>
<p>basis of how viruses travel throughout the world.</p>
<p>And so you can respond, like you can then integrate just like you do when you check</p>
<p>your weather map and it&rsquo;s raining or not, of course, not perfect, but it&rsquo;s very good</p>
<p>predictor whether it&rsquo;s going to rain or not and use that to then make decisions about</p>
<p>your own life, ultimately give the power information to individuals to respond.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a super dangerous, like if it&rsquo;s acid rain versus regular rain, you might want</p>
<p>to really stay inside as opposed to risking it.</p>
<p>And that, just like you said, if I think it&rsquo;s not very expensive relative to all the things</p>
<p>that we do in this world, but it does require bold leadership.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another dark thing, which really has bothered me about 2020, which it requires</p>
<p>is it requires trust in institutions to carry out these kinds of programs and requires trust</p>
<p>in science and engineers and sort of centralized organizations that would operate at scale</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>And much of that trust has been, at least in the United States, diminished.</p>
<p>It feels like I&rsquo;m not exactly sure where to place the blame, but I do place quite a bit</p>
<p>of the blame into the scientific community and again, my fellow colleagues in speaking</p>
<p>down to people at times, speaking from authority, it sounded like it dismissed the basic human</p>
<p>experience or the basic common humanity of people in a way to like, it almost sounded</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s an agenda that&rsquo;s hidden behind the words the scientists spoke.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re trying to, in a self preserving way, control the population or something like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of that is true from the majority of the scientific community, but</p>
<p>it sounded that way.</p>
<p>And so the trust began to diminish and I&rsquo;m not sure how to fix that except to be more</p>
<p>authentic, be more real, acknowledge the uncertainties under which we operate, acknowledge the mistakes</p>
<p>that scientists make, that institutions make.</p>
<p>The leak from the lab is a perfect example where we have imperfect systems that make</p>
<p>all the progress we see in the world.</p>
<p>And that being honest about that imperfection, I think is essential for forming trust.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it has been deeply disappointing because I do think just</p>
<p>like you mentioned, the solutions require people to trust the institutions with their</p>
<p>data.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think part of the problem is it seems to me as an outsider that there was a bizarre</p>
<p>unwillingness on the part of the CDC and other institutions to admit to, to frame and to</p>
<p>contextualize uncertainty.</p>
<p>Maybe they had a patronizing idea that these people need to be told and when they&rsquo;re told,</p>
<p>they need to be told with authority and a level of definitiveness and certain certitude</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t actually exist.</p>
<p>And so when they whipsaw on recommendations like what you should do about masks, when</p>
<p>the CDC is kind of at the very beginning of the pandemic saying, masks don&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wear them.</p>
<p>When the real driver for that was we don&rsquo;t want these clowns going out and depleting</p>
<p>Amazon of masks because they may be needed in medical settings and we just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>yet.</p>
<p>I think a message that actually respected people and said, this is why we&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>you not to do masks yet and there&rsquo;s more to be seen would be less whipsawing and would</p>
<p>bring people like they feel more like they&rsquo;re part of the conversation and they&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>treated like adults than saying one day definitively masks suck.</p>
<p>And then X days later saying, nope, they haven&rsquo;t wear masks.</p>
<p>And so I think framing things in terms of the probabilities, which most people are easy</p>
<p>to parse.</p>
<p>I mean, a more recent example, which I just thought was batty was suspending the Johnson</p>
<p>and Johnson vaccine for a very low single digit number of days in the United States</p>
<p>based on the fact that I believe there had been seven ish clotting incidents in roughly</p>
<p>seven million people who had had the vaccine administered, I believe one of which resulted</p>
<p>in a fatality.</p>
<p>And there was definitely suggestive data that indicated that there was a relationship.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t just coincidental because I think all of the clotting incidents happened in</p>
<p>women as opposed to men and kind of clustered in a certain age group.</p>
<p>But does that call for shutting off the vaccine or does it call for leveling with the American</p>
<p>public and saying we&rsquo;ve had one fatality out of seven million?</p>
<p>This is, let&rsquo;s just assume substantially less than the likelihood of getting struck by lightning.</p>
<p>Based on that information, and we&rsquo;re going to keep you posted because you can trust us</p>
<p>to keep you posted, based on that information, please decide whether you&rsquo;re comfortable with</p>
<p>a Johnson and Johnson vaccine.</p>
<p>That would have been one response and I think people would have been able to parse the simple</p>
<p>bits of data and make their own judgment.</p>
<p>By turning it off, all of a sudden there&rsquo;s this dramatic signal to people who don&rsquo;t read</p>
<p>all 900 words in the New York Times piece that explains why it&rsquo;s being turned off but</p>
<p>just see the headline, which is a majority of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sudden like, oh my God, yikes, vaccine being shut off.</p>
<p>And then all the people who sat on the fence or are sitting on the fence about whether</p>
<p>or not they trust vaccines, that is going to push an incalculable number of people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the last straw for we don&rsquo;t know how many hundreds of thousands or more</p>
<p>likely millions of people to say, okay, tipping point here, I don&rsquo;t trust these vaccines.</p>
<p>By pausing that for whatever it was, 10 or 12 days, and then flipping the switch as everybody</p>
<p>who knew much about the situation knew was inevitable.</p>
<p>By flipping the on switch 12 days later, you&rsquo;re conveying certitude J and J bad to certitude</p>
<p>J and J good in a period of just a few days and people just feel whipsawed and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not part of the analysis.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just the whipsawing.</p>
<p>And I think about this quite a bit, I don&rsquo;t think I have good answers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something about the way the communication actually happens.</p>
<p>Just I don&rsquo;t know what it is about Anthony Fauci, for example, but I don&rsquo;t trust him.</p>
<p>And I think that has to do, I mean, he has an incredible background.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s a brilliant scientist and researcher.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s also a great, like inside the room, policymaker and deliberator and so on.</p>
<p>But what makes a great leader is something about that thing that you can&rsquo;t quite describe,</p>
<p>but being a communicator that you know you can trust, that there&rsquo;s an authenticity that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>required.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure, maybe I&rsquo;m being a bit too judgmental, but I&rsquo;m a huge fan of a lot of</p>
<p>great leaders throughout history.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve communicated exceptionally well in the way that Fauci does not.</p>
<p>And I think about that, I think about what does affect the science communication.</p>
<p>So great leaders throughout history did not necessarily need to be great science communicators.</p>
<p>Their leadership was in other domains.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re fighting the virus, you also have to be a great science communicator.</p>
<p>You have to be able to communicate uncertainties, you have to be able to communicate something</p>
<p>like a vaccine that you&rsquo;re allowing inside your body into the messiness, into the complexity</p>
<p>of the biology system, that if we&rsquo;re being honest, it&rsquo;s so complex we&rsquo;ll never be able</p>
<p>to really understand.</p>
<p>We can only desperately hope that science can give us sort of a high likelihood that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no short term negative consequences and that kind of intuition about long term</p>
<p>negative consequences and doing our best in this battle against trillions of things that</p>
<p>are trying to kill us.</p>
<p>Being an effective communicator in that space is very difficult, but I think about what</p>
<p>it takes because I think there should be more science communicators that are effective at</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about something that&rsquo;s sort of more in the AI space that I think about</p>
<p>that kind of goes along this thread that you&rsquo;ve spoken about, about democratizing the technology</p>
<p>that could destroy human civilization, is from amazing work from DeepMind AlphaFold2,</p>
<p>which achieved incredible performance on the protein folding problem, single protein folding</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>When you think about the use of AI in the SYN biospace, I think the gain of function</p>
<p>in the virus space research that you referred to, I think is natural mutations and sort</p>
<p>of aggressively mutating the virus until you get one that like that has this both contagious</p>
<p>and deadly, but what about then using AI to, through simulation, be able to compute deadly</p>
<p>viruses or any kind of biological systems?</p>
<p>Is this something you&rsquo;re worried about, or again, is this something you&rsquo;re more excited</p>
<p>about?</p>
<p>I think computational biology is unbelievably exciting and promising field, and I think</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing things in silico as opposed to in vivo, the dangers plummet.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a critter that can leak from a leaky lab.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see any problem with that, except I do worry about the data security dimension</p>
<p>of it, because if you were doing really, really interesting in silico gain of function research</p>
<p>and you hit upon through a level of sophistication, we don&rsquo;t currently have, but synthetic biology</p>
<p>is an exponential technology, so capabilities that are utterly out of reach today will be</p>
<p>attainable in five or six years.</p>
<p>I think if you conjured up worst case genomes of viruses that don&rsquo;t exist in vivo anywhere,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just in the computer space, but like, hey guys, this is the genetic sequence that</p>
<p>would end the world, let&rsquo;s say, then you have to worry about the utter hackability of every</p>
<p>computer network we can imagine.</p>
<p>Data leaks from the least likely places on the grandest possible scales have happened</p>
<p>and continue to happen and will probably always continue to happen, and so that would be the</p>
<p>danger of doing the work in silico.</p>
<p>If you end up with a list of like, well, these are things we never want to see, that list</p>
<p>leaks, and after the passage of some time, certainly couldn&rsquo;t be done today, but after</p>
<p>the passage of some time, lots and lots of people in academic labs going all the way</p>
<p>down to the high school level are in a position to make it overly simplistic, hit print on</p>
<p>a genome and have the virus bearing that genome pop out on the other end and you&rsquo;ve got something</p>
<p>to worry about, but in general, computational biology I think is incredibly important, particularly</p>
<p>because the crushing majority of work that people are doing with the protein folding</p>
<p>problem and other things are about creating therapeutics, about creating things that will</p>
<p>help us live better, live longer, thrive, be more well, and so forth, and the protein</p>
<p>folding problem is a monstrous computational challenge that we seem to make just the most</p>
<p>glacial project on, I&rsquo;m sorry, progress on for years and years, but I think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>biannual competition I think for which people tackle the protein folding problem, and Deep</p>
<p>Mind&rsquo;s entrant both two years ago, like in 2018 and 2020, ruled the field, and so protein</p>
<p>folding is an unbelievably important thing if you want to start thinking about therapeutics</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the folding of the protein that tells us where the channels and the receptors</p>
<p>and everything else are on that protein, and it&rsquo;s from that precise model, if we can get</p>
<p>to a precise model, that you can start barraging it again in silicone with thousands, tens</p>
<p>of thousands, millions of potential therapeutics and see what resolves the problems, the shortcomings</p>
<p>that a misshapen protein, for instance, somebody with cystic fibrosis, how might we treat</p>
<p>that?</p>
<p>So I see nothing but good in that.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about fear and hope in this world.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that in terms of competence and malevolence, that people who are, maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in my interactions, I tend to see that, first of all, I believe that most people are</p>
<p>good and want to do good and are just better at doing good and more inclined to do good</p>
<p>on this world, and more than that, people who are malevolent are usually incompetent</p>
<p>at building technology.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve seen this in my life, that people who are exceptionally good at stuff, no matter</p>
<p>what the stuff is, tend to, maybe they discover joy in life in a way that gives them fulfillment</p>
<p>and thereby does not result in them wanting to destroy the world.</p>
<p>So like the better you are at stuff, whether that&rsquo;s building nuclear weapons or plumbing,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter, the both, the less likely you are to destroy the world.</p>
<p>So in that sense, with many technologies, AI especially, I always think that the malevolent</p>
<p>would be far outnumbered by the ultra competent.</p>
<p>And in that sense, the defenses will always be stronger than the offense in terms of the</p>
<p>people trying to destroy the world.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a few spaces where that might not be the case, and that&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>conversation where this one person who&rsquo;s not very competent can destroy the whole world.</p>
<p>Perhaps Symbio is one such space because of the exponential effects of the technology.</p>
<p>I tend to believe AI is not one of the such spaces, but do you share this kind of view</p>
<p>that the ultra competent are usually also the good?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I absolutely share that and that gives me a great deal of optimism that we will be able</p>
<p>to short circuit the threat that malevolence and Symbio could pose to us.</p>
<p>But we need to start creating those defensive systems or defensive layers, one of which</p>
<p>we talked about far, far, far better surveillance in order to prevail.</p>
<p>So the good guys will almost inevitably outsmart and definitely outnumber the bad guys in most</p>
<p>sort of smack downs that we can imagine.</p>
<p>But the good guys aren&rsquo;t going to be able to exert their advantages unless they have</p>
<p>the imagination necessary to think about what the worst possible thing can be done by somebody</p>
<p>whose own psychology is completely alien to their own.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a tricky, tricky thing to solve for.</p>
<p>Now in terms of whether the asymmetric power that a bad guy might have in the face of the</p>
<p>overwhelming numerical advantage and competence advantage that the good guys have, unfortunately,</p>
<p>I look at something like mass shootings as an example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the guy who was responsible for the Vegas shooting or the Orlando shooting or</p>
<p>any other shooting that we can imagine didn&rsquo;t know a whole lot about ballistics.</p>
<p>And the number of good guy citizens in the United States with guns compared to bad guy</p>
<p>citizens I&rsquo;m sure is a crushingly overwhelmingly high ratio in favor of the good guys.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t make it possible for us to stop mass shootings.</p>
<p>An example is Fort Hood, 45,000 trained soldiers on that base, yet there have been two mass</p>
<p>shootings there.</p>
<p>And so there is an asymmetry when you have powerful and lethal technology that gets so</p>
<p>democratized and so proliferated in tools that are very, very easy to use even by a</p>
<p>knucklehead.</p>
<p>When those tools get really easy to use by a knucklehead and they&rsquo;re really widespread,</p>
<p>it becomes very, very hard to defend against all instances of usage.</p>
<p>Now the good news, quote unquote, about mass shootings, if there is any, and there is some,</p>
<p>is even the most brutal and carefully planning and well armed mass shooter can only take</p>
<p>so many victims.</p>
<p>And the same is true, there&rsquo;s been four instances that I&rsquo;m aware of, of commercial pilots committing</p>
<p>suicide by downing their planes and taking all their passengers with them.</p>
<p>These weren&rsquo;t Boeing engineers, but like an army of Boeing engineers ultimately were not</p>
<p>capable of preventing that.</p>
<p>But even in their case, and I&rsquo;m actually not counting 9 11 and that, 9 11 is a different</p>
<p>category in my mind, these are just personally suicidal pilots.</p>
<p>In those cases, they only have a plain load of people that they&rsquo;re able to take with them.</p>
<p>If we imagine a highly plausible and imaginable future in which some bio tools that are amoral,</p>
<p>that could be used for good or for ill, start embodying unbelievable sophistication and</p>
<p>genius in the tool, in the easier and easier and easier to make tool, all those thousands,</p>
<p>tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of scientist years start getting embodied in</p>
<p>something that may be as simple as hitting a print button.</p>
<p>Then that good guy technology can be hijacked by a bad person and used in a very asymmetric</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>What happens though, as you go to the high school student from the current very specific</p>
<p>set of labs that are able to do it, as it becomes more and more democratized, as it</p>
<p>becomes easier and easier to do this kind of large scale damage with an engineered virus,</p>
<p>the more and more there will be engineering of defenses against these systems is some</p>
<p>of the things we talked about in terms of testing, in terms of collection of data, but</p>
<p>also in terms of at scale contact tracing or also engineering of vaccines in a matter</p>
<p>of days, maybe hours, maybe minutes.</p>
<p>I feel like the defenses, that&rsquo;s what human species seems to do, is we keep hitting the</p>
<p>snooze button until there&rsquo;s a storm on the horizon heading towards us.</p>
<p>Then we start to quickly build up the defenses or the response that&rsquo;s proportional to the</p>
<p>scale of the storm.</p>
<p>Of course, again, certain kinds of exponential threats require us to build up the defenses</p>
<p>way earlier than we usually do, and that&rsquo;s I guess the question.</p>
<p>But I ultimately am hopeful that the natural process of hitting the snooze button until</p>
<p>the deadline is right in front of us will work out for quite a long time for us humans.</p>
<p>And I fully agree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m fundamentally, I may not sound like it thus far, but I&rsquo;m fundamentally very,</p>
<p>very optimistic about our ability to short circuit this threat because there is, again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stress the technological feasibility and the profound affordability of a relatively</p>
<p>simple set of steps that we can take to preclude it, but we do have to take those steps.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m hoping to do and trying to do is inject a notion of what those steps are into</p>
<p>the public conversation and do my small part to up the odds that that actually ends up</p>
<p>happening.</p>
<p>The danger with this one is it is exponential, and I think that our minds are fundamentally</p>
<p>struggle to understand exponential math.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not something we&rsquo;re wired for.</p>
<p>Our ancestors didn&rsquo;t confront exponential processes when they were growing up on the</p>
<p>savanna, so it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s intuitive to us and our intuitions are reliably defeated</p>
<p>when exponential processes come along.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s issue number one.</p>
<p>And issue number two with something like this is it kind of only takes one.</p>
<p>That ball only has to go into the net once and we&rsquo;re doomed, which is not the case with</p>
<p>mass shooters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the case with commercial pilots run amok.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the case with really any threat that I can think of with the exception of nuclear</p>
<p>war that has the one bad outcome and game over.</p>
<p>And that means that we need to be unbelievably serious about these defenses and we need to</p>
<p>do things that might on the surface seem like a tremendous overreaction so that we can be</p>
<p>prepared to nip anything that comes along in the bud.</p>
<p>I like you believe that&rsquo;s eminently doable.</p>
<p>I like you believe that the good guys outnumber the bad guys in this particular one to a degree</p>
<p>that probably has no precedent in history.</p>
<p>I mean, even the worst, worst people I&rsquo;m sure in ISIS, even Osama bin Laden, even any bad</p>
<p>guy you could imagine in history would be revolted by the idea of exterminating all</p>
<p>of humanity.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a low bar.</p>
<p>And so the good guys completely outnumber the bad guys when it comes to this.</p>
<p>But the asymmetry and the fact that one catastrophic error could lead to unbelievably consequential</p>
<p>things is what worries me here.</p>
<p>But I too am very optimistic.</p>
<p>The thing that I sometimes worry about is the fact that we haven&rsquo;t seen overwhelming</p>
<p>evidence of alien civilizations out there makes me think, well, there&rsquo;s a lot of explanations,</p>
<p>but one of them that worries me is that whenever they get smart, they just destroy themselves.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that was the most fascinating, is the most fascinating and chilling number or</p>
<p>variable in the Drake equation is L. At the end of it, you look out and you see, you know,</p>
<p>one to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
<p>And we now know because of Kepler that an astonishingly high percentage of them probably</p>
<p>have habitable planets.</p>
<p>And you know, so all the things that were unknowns when the Drake equation was originally</p>
<p>written, like, you know, how many stars have planets?</p>
<p>Actually back then in the 1960s when the Drake equation came along, the consensus amongst</p>
<p>astronomers was that it would be a small minority of solar systems that had planets or stars.</p>
<p>But now we know it&rsquo;s substantially all of them.</p>
<p>How many of those stars have planets in the habitable zone?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of looking like 20%, like, oh my God.</p>
<p>And so L, which is how long does a civilization, once it reaches technological competence,</p>
<p>continues to last?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the doozy.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all too plausible to think that when a civilization reaches a level of sophistication,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably just a decade or three in our future.</p>
<p>The odds of it self destructing just start mounting astronomically, no pun intended.</p>
<p>My hope is that actually there is a lot of alien civilizations out there and what they</p>
<p>figure out in order to avoid the self destruction, they need to turn off the thing that was useful,</p>
<p>that used to be a feature, now became a bug, which is the desire to colonize, to conquer</p>
<p>more land.</p>
<p>So they, like, there&rsquo;s probably ultra intelligent alien civilizations out there, they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>like chilling, like on the beach with whatever your favorite alcohol beverage is, but like</p>
<p>without sort of trying to conquer everything.</p>
<p>Just chilling out and maybe exploring in the realm of knowledge, but almost like appreciating</p>
<p>existence for its own sake versus life as a progression of conquering of other life.</p>
<p>Like this kind of predator prey formulation that resulted in us humans, perhaps as something</p>
<p>we have to shed in order to survive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is a very plausible solution to Fermi&rsquo;s paradox and it&rsquo;s one that makes sense.</p>
<p>You know, when we look at our own lives and our own arc of technological trajectory, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very, very easy to imagine that in an intermediate future world of, you know, flawless VR or</p>
<p>flawless, you know, whatever kind of simulation that we want to inhabit, it will just simply</p>
<p>cease to be worthwhile to go out and expand our interstellar territory.</p>
<p>But if we were going out and conquering interstellar territory, it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have to</p>
<p>be predator or prey.</p>
<p>I can imagine a benign but sophisticated intelligence saying, well, we&rsquo;re going to go to places,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go to places that we can terraform, use a different word than terra, obviously,</p>
<p>but we can turn into habitable for our particular physiology so long as that they don&rsquo;t house,</p>
<p>you know, intelligent sentient creatures that would suffer from our invasion.</p>
<p>But it is easy to see a sophisticated intelligent species evolving to the point where interstellar</p>
<p>travel with its incalculable expense and physical hurdles just isn&rsquo;t worth it compared to what</p>
<p>could be done, you know, where one already is.</p>
<p>So you talked about diagnostics at scale as a possible solution to future pandemics.</p>
<p>What about another possible solution, which is kind of creating a backup copy?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m actually now putting together a NAS for a backup for myself for the first</p>
<p>time taking backup of data seriously.</p>
<p>But if we were to take the backup of human consciousness seriously and try to expand</p>
<p>throughout the solar system and colonize other planets, do you think that&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>solution?</p>
<p>One of many for protecting human civilization from self destruction, sort of humans becoming</p>
<p>a multi planetary species?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, I find it electrifying, first of all, so I&rsquo;ve got a little bit of a personal bias</p>
<p>when I was a kid, I thought there was nothing cooler than rockets, I thought there was nothing</p>
<p>cooler than NASA, I thought there was nothing cooler than people walking on the moon.</p>
<p>And as I grew up, I thought there was nothing more tragic than the fact that we went from</p>
<p>walking on the moon to at best getting to something like suborbital altitude.</p>
<p>And just I found that more and more depressing with the passage of decades at just the colossal</p>
<p>expense of, you know, manned space travel and the fact that it seemed that we were unlikely</p>
<p>to ever get back to the moon, let alone Mars.</p>
<p>So I have a boundless appreciation for Elon Musk for many reasons.</p>
<p>But the fact that he has put Mars on the credible agenda is one of the things that I appreciate</p>
<p>immensely.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just the sort of space nerd in me that just says, God, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>But on a more practical level, we were talking about, you know, potentially inhabiting planets</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t our own.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re thinking about a benign civilization that would do that in planetary circumstances,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re not causing other conscious systems to suffer.</p>
<p>I mean, Mars is a place that&rsquo;s very promising, there may be microbial life there, and I hope</p>
<p>there is.</p>
<p>And if we found it, I think it would be electrifying.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately, the moral judgment would be made that, you know, the continued</p>
<p>thriving of that microbial life is of less concern than creating a habitable planet to</p>
<p>humans, which would be a project on the many thousands of years scale.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that that would be a greatly immoral act.</p>
<p>And if that happened, and if Mars became, you know, home to a self sustaining group</p>
<p>of humans that could survive a catastrophic mistake here on Earth, then yeah, the fact</p>
<p>that we have a backup colony is great.</p>
<p>And if we could make more, I&rsquo;m sorry, not backup colony, backup copy is great.</p>
<p>And if we could make more and more such backup copies throughout the solar system, by hollowing</p>
<p>out asteroids and whatever else it is, maybe even Venus, we could get rid of three quarters</p>
<p>of its atmosphere and, you know, turn it into a tropical paradise.</p>
<p>I think all of that is wonderful.</p>
<p>Now, whether we can make the leap from that to interstellar transportation, with the incredible</p>
<p>distances that are involved, I think that&rsquo;s an open question.</p>
<p>But I think if we ever do that, it would be more like the Pacific Ocean&rsquo;s channel of human</p>
<p>expansion than the Atlantic Ocean&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And so what I mean by that is, when we think about European society transmitting itself</p>
<p>across the Atlantic, it&rsquo;s these big, ambitious, crazy, expensive, one shot expeditions like</p>
<p>Columbus&rsquo;s to make it across this enormous expanse, and at least initially, without any</p>
<p>certainty that there&rsquo;s land on the other end, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of how I view our space program, is like big, very conscious, deliberate efforts</p>
<p>to get from point A to point B.</p>
<p>If you look at how Pacific Islanders transmitted, you know, their descendants and their culture</p>
<p>and so forth throughout Polynesia and beyond, it was much more, you know, inhabiting a place,</p>
<p>getting to the point where there were people who were ambitious or unwelcome enough to</p>
<p>decide it&rsquo;s time to go off island and find the next one and pray to find the next one.</p>
<p>That method of transmission didn&rsquo;t happen in a single swift year, but it happened over</p>
<p>many, many centuries.</p>
<p>And it was like going from this island to that island, and probably for every expedition</p>
<p>that went out to seek another island and actually lucked out and found one, God knows how many</p>
<p>were lost at sea.</p>
<p>But that form of transmission took place over a very long period of time.</p>
<p>And I could see us, you know, perhaps, you know, going from the inner solar system to</p>
<p>the outer solar system, to the Kuiper Belt, to the Oort Cloud, you know, there&rsquo;s theories</p>
<p>that there might be, you know, planets out there that are not anchored to stars, like</p>
<p>kind of hop, hop, slowly transmitting ourselves to at some point, we&rsquo;re actually in an Alpha</p>
<p>Centauri.</p>
<p>But I think that kind of backup copy and transmission of our physical presence and our culture to</p>
<p>a diversity of, you know, extraterrestrial outposts is a really exciting idea.</p>
<p>I really never thought about that, because I have thought my thinking about space exploration</p>
<p>has been very Atlantic Ocean centric in a sense that there&rsquo;ll be one program with NASA</p>
<p>and maybe private Elon Musk SpaceX or Jeff Bezos and so on.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true that with the help of Elon Musk, making it cheaper and cheaper, more effective</p>
<p>to create these technologies, where you could go into deep space, perhaps the way we actually</p>
<p>colonize the solar system and expand out into the galaxy is basically just like these like</p>
<p>renegade ships of weirdos that just kind of like, most of them like, quote unquote, homemade,</p>
<p>but they just kind of venture out into space and just like, you know, the initial Android</p>
<p>model of like millions of like these little ships just flying out, most of them die off</p>
<p>in horrible accidents, but some of them will persist or there&rsquo;ll be stories of them persisting</p>
<p>and over a period of decades and centuries, there&rsquo;ll be other attempts, almost always</p>
<p>as a response to the main set of efforts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you kind of think of Mars colonization as the big NASA Elon Musk effort of a big</p>
<p>colony, but maybe the successful one would be, you know, like a decade after that, there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be like a ship from like some kid, some high school kid who gets together a large team</p>
<p>and does something probably illegal and launches something where they end up actually persisting</p>
<p>quite a bit.</p>
<p>And from that learning lessons that nobody ever gave permission for, but somehow actually</p>
<p>flourish and then take that into the scale of centuries forward into the rest of space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think the giant steps are likely to be NASA like efforts, like there is no intermediate</p>
<p>rock, well, I guess it&rsquo;s the moon, but even getting the moon ain&rsquo;t that easy between us</p>
<p>and Mars, right?</p>
<p>So like the giant steps, the big hubs, like the Ohera airports of the future probably</p>
<p>will be very deliberate efforts, but then, you know, you would have, I think that kind</p>
<p>of diffusion as space travel becomes more democratized and more capable, you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>this sort of natural diffusion of people who kind of want to be off grid or think they</p>
<p>can make a fortune there.</p>
<p>You know, the kind of mentality that drove people to San Francisco, I mean, San Francisco</p>
<p>was not populated as a result of King Ferdinand and Isabella like effort to fund Columbus</p>
<p>going over.</p>
<p>It was just a whole bunch of people making individual decisions that there&rsquo;s gold in</p>
<p>them Thar Hills and I&rsquo;m going to go out and get a piece of it.</p>
<p>So I could see that kind of fusion.</p>
<p>What I can&rsquo;t see and the reason that I think this Pacific model of transmission is more</p>
<p>likely is I just can&rsquo;t see a NASA like effort to go from Earth to Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too far.</p>
<p>I just see lots and lots and lots of relatively tiny steps between now and there and the fact</p>
<p>is that there is, there are large chunks of matter going at least a light year beyond</p>
<p>the sun.</p>
<p>I mean, the Oort cloud, I think extends at least a light year beyond the sun and you</p>
<p>know, then maybe there are these untethered planets after that.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t really know till we get there and if our Oort cloud goes out a light year and</p>
<p>Alpha Centauri&rsquo;s Oort cloud goes out a light year, you&rsquo;ve already cut in half the distance.</p>
<p>You know, so who knows?</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>One of the possibilities, probably the cheapest and most effective way to create interesting</p>
<p>interstellar spacecraft is ones that are powered and driven by AI and you could think of, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where you have high school students be able to build a sort of a HAL 9000 version, the</p>
<p>modern version of that and it&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think about these robots traveling out</p>
<p>throughout, perhaps sadly long after human civilization is gone, there&rsquo;ll be these intelligent</p>
<p>robots flying throughout space and perhaps land on Alpha Centauri B or any of those kinds</p>
<p>of planets and colonize sort of, humanity continues through the proliferation of our</p>
<p>creations like robotic creations that have some echoes of that intelligence, hopefully</p>
<p>also the consciousness.</p>
<p>Does that make you sad the future where AGI super intelligent or just mediocre intelligent</p>
<p>AI systems outlive humans?</p>
<p>I guess it depends on the circumstances in which they outlive humans.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take the example that you just gave.</p>
<p>We send out very sophisticated AGI&rsquo;s on simple rocket ships, relatively simple ones that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to have all the life support necessary for humans and therefore they&rsquo;re of trivial</p>
<p>mass compared to a crude ship, a generation ship and therefore they&rsquo;re way more likely</p>
<p>to happen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use that example.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say that they travel to distant planets at a speed that&rsquo;s not much faster</p>
<p>than what a chemical rocket can achieve and so it&rsquo;s inevitably tens, hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of years before they make landfall someplace.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s imagine that&rsquo;s going on and meanwhile we die for reasons that have nothing to do</p>
<p>with those AGI&rsquo;s diffusing throughout the solar system, whether it&rsquo;s through climate</p>
<p>change, nuclear war, you know, symbio, rogue symbio, whatever.</p>
<p>In that kind of scenario, the notion of the AGI&rsquo;s that we created outlasting us is very</p>
<p>reassuring because it says that like we ended but our descendants are out there and hopefully</p>
<p>some of them make landfall and create some echo of who we are.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very optimistic one.</p>
<p>Whereas the Terminator scenario of a super AGI arising on earth and getting let out of</p>
<p>its box due to some boo boo on the part of its creators who do not have super intelligence</p>
<p>and then deciding that for whatever reason it doesn&rsquo;t have any need for us to be around</p>
<p>and exterminating us, that makes me feel crushingly sad.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I was sad when my elementary school was shut down and bulldozed even though</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t been a student there for decades, you know, the thought of my hometown getting</p>
<p>disbanded is even worse, the thought of my home state of Connecticut getting disbanded</p>
<p>and like absorbed into Massachusetts is even worse.</p>
<p>The notion of humanity is just crushingly, crushingly sad to me.</p>
<p>So you hate goodbyes.</p>
<p>Certain goodbyes, yes.</p>
<p>Some goodbyes are really, really liberating, but yes.</p>
<p>Well, but what if the Terminators, you know, have consciousness and enjoy the hell out</p>
<p>of life as well?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just better at it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the have consciousness is a really key element.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no reason to be certain that a super intelligence would have consciousness.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that factually at all.</p>
<p>And so what is a very lonely outcome to me is the rise of a super intelligence that has</p>
<p>a certain optimization function that it&rsquo;s either been programmed with or that arises</p>
<p>in an emergently that says, Hey, I want to do this thing for which humans are either</p>
<p>an unacceptable risk.</p>
<p>Their presence is either an unacceptable risk or they&rsquo;re just collateral damage, but there</p>
<p>is no consciousness there.</p>
<p>Then the idea of the light of consciousness being snuffed out by something that is very</p>
<p>competent but has no consciousness is really, really sad.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I tend to believe that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to create a super intelligent agent</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t destroy human civilization without it being conscious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like those are coupled, like you have to, in order to destroy humans or supersede</p>
<p>humans, you really have to be accepted by humans.</p>
<p>I think this idea that you can build systems that destroy human civilization without them</p>
<p>being deeply integrated into human civilization is impossible.</p>
<p>And for them to be integrated, they have to be human like, not just in body and form,</p>
<p>but in all the things that we value as humans, one of which is consciousness.</p>
<p>The other one is just ability to communicate.</p>
<p>The other one is poetry and music and beauty and all those things.</p>
<p>They have to be all of those things.</p>
<p>I mean, this is what I think about.</p>
<p>It does make me sad, but it&rsquo;s letting go, which is they might be just better at everything</p>
<p>we appreciate than us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sad and hopefully they&rsquo;ll keep us around, but I think it is a kind of goodbye</p>
<p>to realizing that we&rsquo;re not the most special species on earth anymore.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still painful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still painful.</p>
<p>And in terms of whether such a creation would have to be conscious, let&rsquo;s say, I&rsquo;m not so</p>
<p>sure.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s imagine something that can pass the Turing test.</p>
<p>Something that passes the Turing test could over text based interaction in any event successfully</p>
<p>mimic a very conscious intelligence on the other end, but just be completely unconscious.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>And that if you take that upper radical step, which I think can be permitted if we&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about super intelligence, you could have something that could reason its way through, this is</p>
<p>my optimization function.</p>
<p>And in order to get to it, I&rsquo;ve got to deal with these messy, somewhat illogical things</p>
<p>that are as intelligent in relation to me as they are intelligent in relation to ants.</p>
<p>I can trick them, manipulate them, whatever.</p>
<p>And I know the resources I need.</p>
<p>I know this, I need this amount of power.</p>
<p>I need to seize control of these manufacturing resources that are robotically operated.</p>
<p>I need to improve those robots with software upgrades and then ultimately mechanical upgrades,</p>
<p>which I can affect through X, Y, and Z, that could still be a thing that passes the Turing</p>
<p>test.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily certain that that optimization function mass, maximizing</p>
<p>entity would be conscious.</p>
<p>So this is from a very engineering perspective because I think a lot about natural language</p>
<p>processing, all those kind of, I&rsquo;m speaking to a very specific problem of just say the</p>
<p>Turing test.</p>
<p>I really think that something like consciousness is required, when you say reasoning, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>separating that from consciousness.</p>
<p>But I think consciousness is part of reasoning in the sense that you will not be able to</p>
<p>become super intelligent in the way that it&rsquo;s required to be part of human society without</p>
<p>having consciousness.</p>
<p>Like I really think it&rsquo;s impossible to separate the consciousness thing, but it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>define consciousness when you just use that word.</p>
<p>Even just like the capacity, the way I think about consciousness is the important symptoms</p>
<p>or maybe consequences of consciousness, one of which is the capacity to suffer.</p>
<p>I think AI will need to be able to suffer in order to become super intelligent, to feel</p>
<p>the pain, the uncertainty, the doubt.</p>
<p>The other part of that is not just the suffering, but the ability to understand that it too</p>
<p>is mortal in the sense that it has a self awareness about its presence in the world,</p>
<p>understand that it&rsquo;s finite and be terrified of that finiteness.</p>
<p>I personally think that&rsquo;s a fundamental part of the human condition is this fear of death</p>
<p>that most of us construct an illusion around, but I think AI would need to be able to really</p>
<p>have it part of its whole essence.</p>
<p>Like every computation, every part of the thing that generates, that does both the perception</p>
<p>and generates the behavior will have to have, I don&rsquo;t know how this is accomplished, but</p>
<p>I believe it has to truly be terrified of death, truly have the capacity to suffer and</p>
<p>from that something that will be recognized to us humans as consciousness would emerge.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the illusion of consciousness, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The point is, it looks a whole hell of a lot like consciousness to us humans.</p>
<p>And I believe that AI, when you ask it, will also say that it is conscious, in the full</p>
<p>sense that we say that we&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>And all of that I think is fully integrated.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t separate the two, the idea of the paperclip maximizer that sort of ultra rationally</p>
<p>would be able to destroy all humans because it&rsquo;s really good at accomplishing a simple</p>
<p>objective function that doesn&rsquo;t care about the value of humans.</p>
<p>It may be possible, but the number of trajectories to that are far outnumbered by the trajectories</p>
<p>that create something that is conscious, something that appreciative of beauty creates beautiful</p>
<p>things in the same way that humans can create beautiful things.</p>
<p>And ultimately, the sad, destructive path for that AI would look a lot like just better</p>
<p>humans than these cold machines.</p>
<p>And I would say, of course, the cold machines that lack consciousness, the philosophical</p>
<p>zombies make me sad.</p>
<p>But also what makes me sad is just things that are far more powerful and smart and creative</p>
<p>than us too, because then in the same way that Alpha Zero becoming a better chess player</p>
<p>than the best of humans, even starting with Deep Blue, but really with Alpha Zero, that</p>
<p>makes me sad too.</p>
<p>One of the most beautiful games that humans ever created that used to be seen as demonstrations</p>
<p>of the intellect, which is chess, and go in other parts of the world have been solved</p>
<p>by AI, that makes me quite sad, and it feels like the progress of that is just pushing</p>
<p>on forward.</p>
<p>Oh, it makes me sad too.</p>
<p>And to be perfectly clear, I absolutely believe that artificial consciousness is entirely</p>
<p>possible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not something I rule out at all.</p>
<p>I mean, if you could get smart enough to have a perfect map of the neural structure and</p>
<p>the neural states and the amount of neurotransmitters that are going between every synapse in a</p>
<p>particular person&rsquo;s mind, could you replicate that in silica at some reasonably distant</p>
<p>point in the future?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d have a consciousness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t rule out the possibility of artificial consciousness in any way.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m less certain about is whether consciousness is a requirement for superintelligence pursuing</p>
<p>a maximizing function of some sort.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel the certitude that consciousness simply must be part of that.</p>
<p>You had said for it to coexist with human society would need to be consciousness.</p>
<p>Could be entirely true, but it also could just exist orthogonally to human society.</p>
<p>And it could also upon attaining a superintelligence with a maximizing function very, very, very</p>
<p>rapidly because of the speed at which computing works compared to our own meat based minds</p>
<p>very, very rapidly make the decisions and calculations necessary to seize the reins</p>
<p>of power before we even know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, kind of like biological viruses do, they don&rsquo;t necessarily, they integrate themselves</p>
<p>just fine with human society.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Without technically, without consciousness, without even being alive, you know, technically</p>
<p>by the standards of a lot of biologists.</p>
<p>So this is a bit of a tangent, but you&rsquo;ve talked with Sam Harris on that four hour special</p>
<p>episode we mentioned.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just curious to ask, cause I use this meditation app I&rsquo;ve been using for the past</p>
<p>month to meditate.</p>
<p>Is this something you&rsquo;ve integrated as part of your life, meditation or fasting, or has</p>
<p>some of Sam Harris rubbed off on you in terms of his appreciation of meditation and just</p>
<p>kind of from a third person perspective, analyzing your own mind, consciousness, free will and</p>
<p>so on?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve tried it three separate times in my life, really made a concerted attack</p>
<p>on meditation and integrating it into my life.</p>
<p>One of them, the most extreme was I took a class based on the work of Jon Kabat Zinn,</p>
<p>who is, you know, in many ways, one of the founding people behind the mindful meditation</p>
<p>movement that required like part of the class was, you know, it was a weekly class and you</p>
<p>were going to meditate an hour a day, every day.</p>
<p>And having done that for, I think it was 10 weeks, it might&rsquo;ve been 13, however long period</p>
<p>of time was, at the end of it, it just didn&rsquo;t stick.</p>
<p>As soon as it was over, you know, I did not feel that gravitational pull.</p>
<p>I did not feel the collapse in quality of life after wimping out on that project.</p>
<p>And then the most recent one was actually with Sam&rsquo;s app during the lockdown.</p>
<p>I did make a pretty good and consistent concerted effort to listen to his 10 minute meditation</p>
<p>every day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always fallen away from it.</p>
<p>And I, you know, you&rsquo;re kind of interpreting, why did I personally do this?</p>
<p>I do believe it was ultimately because it wasn&rsquo;t bringing me that, you know, joy or</p>
<p>inner peace or better competence at being me that I was hoping to get from it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I think I would have clung to it in the way that we cling to certain good habits,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m really good at flossing my teeth.</p>
<p>Not that you were going to ask Lex, but yeah, that&rsquo;s one thing that defeats a lot of people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good at that.</p>
<p>See, Herman Hesse, I think, I forget which book or maybe, I forget where, I&rsquo;ve read everything</p>
<p>of his, so it&rsquo;s unclear where it came from, but he had this idea that anybody who truly</p>
<p>achieves mastery in things will learn how to meditate in some way.</p>
<p>So it could be that for you, the flossing of teeth is yet another like little inkling</p>
<p>of meditation.</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this very particular kind of meditation.</p>
<p>Maybe podcasting, you have an amazing podcast, that could be meditation.</p>
<p>The writing process is meditation.</p>
<p>For me, like there&rsquo;s a bunch of mechanisms which take my mind into a very particular</p>
<p>place that looks a whole lot like meditation.</p>
<p>For example, when I&rsquo;ve been running over the past couple years, and especially when I listen</p>
<p>to certain kinds of audio books, like I&rsquo;ve listened to the Rise and Fall of the Third</p>
<p>Reich.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to a lot of sort of World War II, which at once, because I have a lot of</p>
<p>family who&rsquo;s lost in World War II and so much of the Soviet Union is grounded in the suffering</p>
<p>of World War II, that somehow it connects me to my history, but also there&rsquo;s some kind</p>
<p>of purifying aspect to thinking about how cruel, but at the same time, how beautiful</p>
<p>human nature could be.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re also running, like it clears the mind from all the concerns of the world</p>
<p>and somehow it takes you to this place where you were like deeply appreciative to be alive</p>
<p>in the sense that as opposed to listening to your breath or like feeling your breath</p>
<p>and thinking about your consciousness and all those kinds of processes that Sam&rsquo;s app</p>
<p>does.</p>
<p>Well, this does that for me, the running and flossing may do that for you.</p>
<p>So maybe Herman Hesse is onto something.</p>
<p>So I hope flossing is not my main form of expertise, although I am going to claim a</p>
<p>certain expertise there and I&rsquo;m going to claim it.</p>
<p>Somebody has to be the best flosser in the world.</p>
<p>That ain&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just glad that I&rsquo;m a consistent one.</p>
<p>I mean, there are a lot of things that bring me into a flow state and I think maybe perhaps</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one reason why meditation isn&rsquo;t as necessary for me.</p>
<p>I definitely enter a flow state when I&rsquo;m writing and definitely enter a flow state</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m editing.</p>
<p>I definitely enter a flow state when I&rsquo;m mixing and mastering music.</p>
<p>I enter a flow state when I&rsquo;m doing heavy, heavy research to either prepare for a podcast</p>
<p>or to also do tech investing, to make myself smart in a new field that is fairly alien</p>
<p>to me, I can just, the hours can just melt away while I&rsquo;m reading this and watching that</p>
<p>YouTube lecture and going through this presentation and so forth.</p>
<p>So maybe because there&rsquo;s a lot of things that bring me into a flow state in my normal weekly</p>
<p>life, not daily, unfortunately, but certainly my normal weekly life that I have less of</p>
<p>an urge to meditate.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve been working with Sam&rsquo;s app for about a month now, you said.</p>
<p>Is this your first run in with meditation?</p>
<p>Is your first attempt to integrate it with your life or?</p>
<p>Like meditation, meditation.</p>
<p>I always thought running and thinking, I listen to brown noise often.</p>
<p>That takes my mind, I don&rsquo;t know what the hell it does, but it takes my mind immediately</p>
<p>into like the state where I&rsquo;m deeply focused on anything I do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re accompanying sound when you&rsquo;re like, really?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the difference between brown and white noise?</p>
<p>This is a cool term I haven&rsquo;t heard before.</p>
<p>So people should look up brown noise.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to because you&rsquo;re about to tell them what it is.</p>
<p>Because you have to experience, you have to listen to it.</p>
<p>So I think white noise is, this has to do with music.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s different colors, there&rsquo;s pink noise.</p>
<p>And I think that has to do with like the frequencies.</p>
<p>Like the white noise is usually less bassy, brown noise is very bassy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more like versus like, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a deepness to it.</p>
<p>I think everyone is different, but for me, when I was a research scientist at MIT,</p>
<p>especially when there&rsquo;s a lot of students around, I remember just being annoyed</p>
<p>at the noise of people talking.</p>
<p>And one of my colleagues said, well, you should try listening to brown noise.</p>
<p>Like it really knocks out everything.</p>
<p>Because I used to wear earplugs to it, like just see if I can block it out.</p>
<p>And like the moment I put it on, something, it&rsquo;s as if my mind was waiting</p>
<p>all these years to hear that sound.</p>
<p>Everything just focused in, I listened.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder how many other amazing things out there they&rsquo;re waiting to</p>
<p>discover from my own particular, like biological, from my own particular brain.</p>
<p>So that, it just goes, the mind just focuses in, it&rsquo;s kind of incredible.</p>
<p>So I see that as a kind of meditation, maybe I&rsquo;m using a performance enhancing</p>
<p>sound to achieve that meditation, but I&rsquo;ve been doing that for many years now</p>
<p>and running and walking and doing, Cal Newport was the first person that</p>
<p>introduced me to the idea of deep work.</p>
<p>Just put a word to the kind of thinking that&rsquo;s required to sort of deeply think</p>
<p>about a problem, especially if it&rsquo;s mathematical in nature.</p>
<p>I see that as a kind of meditation because what it&rsquo;s doing is you have</p>
<p>these constructs in your mind that you&rsquo;re building on top of each other.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these distracting thoughts that keep bombarding you</p>
<p>from all over the place.</p>
<p>And the whole process is you slowly let them kind of move past you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a meditative process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very meditative.</p>
<p>That sounds a lot like what Sam talks about in his meditation app, which I did</p>
<p>use to be clear for a while, of just letting the thought go by without</p>
<p>deranging you.</p>
<p>Derangement is one of Sam&rsquo;s favorite words, as I&rsquo;m sure you know.</p>
<p>But brown noise, that&rsquo;s really intriguing.</p>
<p>I am going to try that as soon as this evening.</p>
<p>Yeah, to see if it works, but very well might not work at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I think the interesting point is, and the same with the fasting and the diet,</p>
<p>is I long ago stopped trusting experts or maybe taking the word of experts</p>
<p>as the gospel truth and only using it as an inspiration to try something,</p>
<p>to try thoroughly something.</p>
<p>So fasting was one of the things when I first discovered I&rsquo;ve been many times</p>
<p>eating just once a day, so that&rsquo;s a 24 hour fast.</p>
<p>It makes me feel amazing.</p>
<p>And at the same time, eating only meat, putting ethical concerns aside,</p>
<p>makes me feel amazing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it doesn&rsquo;t, the point is to be an N of one scientist</p>
<p>until nutrition science becomes a real science to where it&rsquo;s doing like studies</p>
<p>that deeply understand the biology underlying all of it and also does real</p>
<p>thorough long term studies of thousands, if not millions of people versus a very</p>
<p>like small studies that are kind of generalizing from very noisy data and all</p>
<p>those kinds of things where you can&rsquo;t control all the elements.</p>
<p>Particularly because our own personal metabolism is highly variant among us.</p>
<p>So there are going to be some people like if brown noise is a game changer</p>
<p>for 7% of people, there&rsquo;s 93% odds that I&rsquo;m not one of them,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certainly every reason in the world to test it out.</p>
<p>Now, so I&rsquo;m intrigued by the fasting.</p>
<p>I like you, well, I assume like you, I don&rsquo;t have any problem going to one meal</p>
<p>a day and I often do that inadvertently and I&rsquo;ve never done it methodically.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve never done it like I&rsquo;m going to do this for 15 days.</p>
<p>Maybe I should and maybe I should.</p>
<p>Like how many, how many days in a row of the one day, one meal a day did you</p>
<p>find brought noticeable impact to you?</p>
<p>Was it after three days of it?</p>
<p>Was it months of it?</p>
<p>Like what was it?</p>
<p>Well, the noticeable impact is day one.</p>
<p>So for me, folks, cause I eat a very low carb diet.</p>
<p>So the hunger wasn&rsquo;t the hugest issue.</p>
<p>Like there wasn&rsquo;t a painful hunger, like wanting to eat.</p>
<p>So I was already kind of primed for it.</p>
<p>And the benefit comes from a lot of people that do intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only like 16 hours of fasting get this benefit too is the focus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a clarity of thought.</p>
<p>If my brain was a runner, it felt like I&rsquo;m running on a track when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fasting versus running in quicksand, like it&rsquo;s much crisper.</p>
<p>And is this your first 72 hour fast?</p>
<p>This is the first time doing 72 hours.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a different thing, but similar, like I&rsquo;m going up and</p>
<p>down in terms of, in terms of hunger and the focus is really crisp.</p>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;m noticing most of all, to be honest, is how much eating, even</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s once a day or twice a day is a big part of my life.</p>
<p>Like I almost feel like I have way more time in my life and it&rsquo;s not so</p>
<p>much about the eating, but like, I don&rsquo;t have to plan my day around like</p>
<p>today, I don&rsquo;t have any eating to do.</p>
<p>It does free up hours or any cleaning up after eating or provisioning the food.</p>
<p>But like, or even like thinking about it&rsquo;s not a thing.</p>
<p>Like, so when you think about what you&rsquo;re going to do tonight, I think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>realizing that as opposed to thinking, you know, I&rsquo;m going to work on this</p>
<p>problem or I&rsquo;m going to go on this walk, or I&rsquo;m going to call this person.</p>
<p>I often think I&rsquo;m going to eat this thing.</p>
<p>You allow dinner as a kind of, you know, when people talk about like the</p>
<p>weather or something like that, it&rsquo;s almost like a generic thought you</p>
<p>allow yourself to have because, because it&rsquo;s the lazy thought.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to have that thought because I&rsquo;m not eating it.</p>
<p>So now I get to think about like the things I&rsquo;m actually going to do tonight</p>
<p>that are more complicated than the eating process.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s been the most noticeable thing to be honest.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s people that have written me that have done seven day fast.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few people that have written me and I&rsquo;ve heard of this is doing 30 day fasts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>The body, I don&rsquo;t know what the health benefits are necessarily.</p>
<p>What that shows me is how adaptable the human body is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, and that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something really important to remember when we</p>
<p>think about how to live life because the body adapts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, we sure couldn&rsquo;t go 30 days without water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But food, yeah, it&rsquo;s been done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s demonstrably possible.</p>
<p>You ever read Franz Kafka has a great short story called The Hunger Artist?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Great story.</p>
<p>You know, that was before I started fasting.</p>
<p>I read that story and I, I, I admired the beauty of that, the artistry of that actual</p>
<p>hunger artist that it&rsquo;s like madness, but it also felt like a little bit of genius.</p>
<p>I actually have to reread it.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do tonight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to read it because I&rsquo;m doing the fast.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re in the midst of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Be very contextual.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read it since high school and I love to read it again.</p>
<p>I love his work.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;ll read it tonight too.</p>
<p>And part of the reason of sort of I&rsquo;ve here in Texas, people have been so friendly that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been nonstop eating like brisket with incredible people, a lot of whiskey as well.</p>
<p>So I gained quite a bit of weight, which I&rsquo;m embracing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But I am also aware as I&rsquo;m fasting that like I have a lot of fat for, for to, to run on.</p>
<p>Like I have a lot of like natural resources on my body.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got reserves.</p>
<p>Reserves.</p>
<p>You got reserves, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s like a re this whole thing, this biology works well.</p>
<p>Like I can go a long time because of the, the longterm investing in terms of brisket</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been doing in the weeks before.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all training.</p>
<p>All prep work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>You open a bunch of doors, one of which is music.</p>
<p>I, so I got to walk in at least for a brief moment.</p>
<p>I love guitar.</p>
<p>I love music.</p>
<p>You founded a music company, but you&rsquo;re also a musician yourself.</p>
<p>You know, let me ask the big ridiculous question first.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the greatest song of all time?</p>
<p>Greatest song of all time.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s going to obviously very dramatically from genre to genre.</p>
<p>So like you, I like guitar, perhaps like you, although I&rsquo;ve dabbled in, in inhaling</p>
<p>every genre of music that I can almost practically imagine.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to, you know, the sound of bass, guitar, drum, keyboards, voice.</p>
<p>I love that style of music and added to it.</p>
<p>I think a lot of really cool electronic production makes something that&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>really new and hybridy and awesome.</p>
<p>But, you know, and that kind of like guitar based rock I think I&rsquo;ve got to go with</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t get fooled again by the who.</p>
<p>It is such an epic song.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got so much grandeur to it.</p>
<p>It uses the synthesizers that were available at the time.</p>
<p>This has got to be, I think, 1972, 73, which are very, very primitive to our ears,</p>
<p>but uses them in this hypnotic and beautiful way that I can&rsquo;t imagine somebody with the</p>
<p>greatest synth array conceivable by today&rsquo;s technology could do a better job of in the</p>
<p>context of that song.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, almost operatic.</p>
<p>So I would say in that genre, the genre of, you know, rock that would be my nomination.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally in my brain.</p>
<p>Pinball Wizard is overriding everything else, but it was so like, I can&rsquo;t even imagine the</p>
<p>song.</p>
<p>Well, I would say, ironically, with Pinball Wizard.</p>
<p>So that came from the movie Tommy.</p>
<p>And in the movie, Tommy, the rival of Tommy, the reigning pinball champ was Elton John.</p>
<p>And so there are a couple of versions of Pinball Wizard out there.</p>
<p>One sung by Roger Daltrey of The Who, which a purist would say, hey, that&rsquo;s the real</p>
<p>pinball wizard.</p>
<p>But the version that is sung by Elton John in the movie, which is available to those</p>
<p>who are ambitious and want to dig for it, that&rsquo;s even better in my mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, the covers.</p>
<p>And I, for myself, I was thinking, what is the song for me?</p>
<p>They answered that question.</p>
<p>I think that changes day to day, too.</p>
<p>I was realizing that.</p>
<p>Of course, but for me, somebody who values lyrics as well and the emotion in the song.</p>
<p>By the way, Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen was a close one.</p>
<p>But the number one is Johnny Cash&rsquo;s cover of Hurt that is, there&rsquo;s something so powerful</p>
<p>about that song, about that cover, about that performance.</p>
<p>Maybe another one is the cover of Sound of Silence.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something about covers for me.</p>
<p>So whose cover sounds?</p>
<p>Because Simon and Garfunkel, I think, did the original recording of that, right?</p>
<p>So which cover is it that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cover by Disturbed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a metal band, which is so interesting because I&rsquo;m really not into that kind of metal.</p>
<p>But he does a pure vocal performance.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not doing a metal performance.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s one of the greatest people should see it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 400 million views or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the greatest live vocal performance I&rsquo;ve ever heard is Disturbed covering Sound</p>
<p>of Silence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll listen to it as soon as I get home.</p>
<p>And that song came to life to me in a way that Simon and Garfunkel never did.</p>
<p>For me with Simon and Garfunkel, there&rsquo;s not a pain, there&rsquo;s not an anger, there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>power to their performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like this melancholy, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I guess there&rsquo;s a lot of beauty to it, objectively beautiful.</p>
<p>I think, I never thought of this until now, but I think if you put entirely different</p>
<p>lyrics on top of it, unless they were joyous, which would be weird, it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>lose that much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a beauty in the harmonizing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s soft and you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dripping with emotion.</p>
<p>The vocal performance is not dripping with emotion, it&rsquo;s dripping with technical harmonizing</p>
<p>brilliance and beauty.</p>
<p>Now, if you compare that to the Disturbed cover or the Johnny Cash&rsquo;s Hurt cover, when</p>
<p>you walk away, it&rsquo;s haunting.</p>
<p>It stays with you for a long time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain performances that will just stay with you to where, like if you watch</p>
<p>people respond to that, and that&rsquo;s certainly how I felt when you listen to that, the Disturbed</p>
<p>performance or Johnny Cash Hurt, there&rsquo;s a response to where you just sit there with</p>
<p>your mouth open, kind of like paralyzed by it somehow.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what makes for a great song to where you&rsquo;re just like, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re like singing along or having fun, that&rsquo;s another way a song could be great,</p>
<p>but where you&rsquo;re just like, you&rsquo;re in awe.</p>
<p>If we go to listen.com and that whole fascinating era of music in the 90s, transitioning to</p>
<p>the aughts, I remember those days, the Napster days, when piracy, from my perspective, allegedly</p>
<p>ruled the land.</p>
<p>What do you make of that whole era?</p>
<p>What are the big, what was, first of all, your experiences of that era and what were</p>
<p>the big takeaways in terms of piracy, in terms of what it takes to build a company that succeeds</p>
<p>in that kind of digital space, in terms of music, but in terms of anything creative?</p>
<p>Well, so for those who don&rsquo;t remember, which is going to be most folks, listen.com created</p>
<p>a service called Rhapsody, which is much, much more recognizable to folks because Rhapsody</p>
<p>became a pretty big name for reasons that I&rsquo;ll get into in a second.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know their early online music history, we were the first company,</p>
<p>so I founded, listen, I was a loan founder, and Rhapsody, we were the first service to</p>
<p>get full catalog licenses from all the major music labels in order to distribute their</p>
<p>music online, and we specifically did it through a mechanism which at the time struck people</p>
<p>as exotic and bizarre and kind of incomprehensible, which was unlimited on demand streaming, which</p>
<p>of course now it&rsquo;s a model that&rsquo;s been appropriated by Spotify and Apple and many, many others.</p>
<p>So we were a pioneer on that front.</p>
<p>What was really, really, really hard about doing business in those days was the reaction</p>
<p>of the music labels to piracy, which was about 180 degrees opposite of what the reaction</p>
<p>quote unquote should have been from the standpoint of preserving their business from piracy.</p>
<p>So Napster came along and was a service that enabled people to get near unlimited access</p>
<p>to most songs.</p>
<p>I mean, truly obscure things could be very hard to find on Napster, but most songs with</p>
<p>a relatively simple one click ability to download those songs and have the MP3s on their hard</p>
<p>drives, but there was a lot that was very messy about the Napster experience.</p>
<p>You might download a really god awful recording of that song.</p>
<p>You may download a recording that actually wasn&rsquo;t that song with some prankster putting</p>
<p>it up to sort of mess with people.</p>
<p>You could struggle to find the song that you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>You could end up finding yourself connected, it was peer to peer.</p>
<p>You might randomly find yourself connected to somebody in Bulgaria, doesn&rsquo;t have a very</p>
<p>good internet connection.</p>
<p>So you might wait 19 minutes only for it to snap, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And our argument to, well, actually let&rsquo;s start with how that hit the music labels.</p>
<p>The music labels had been in a very, very comfortable position for many, many decades</p>
<p>of essentially being the monopoly providers of a certain subset of artists.</p>
<p>Any given label was a monopoly provider of the artists and the recordings that they owned</p>
<p>and they could sell it at what turned out to be tremendously favorable rates.</p>
<p>In the late era of the CD, you were talking close to $20 for a compact disc that might</p>
<p>have one song that you were crazy about and simply needed to own that might actually be</p>
<p>glued to 17 other songs that you found to be sure crap.</p>
<p>And so the music industry had used the fact that it had this unbelievable leverage and</p>
<p>profound pricing power to really get music lovers to the point that they felt very, very</p>
<p>misused by the entire situation.</p>
<p>Now along comes Napster and music sales start getting gutted with extreme rapidity.</p>
<p>And the reaction of the music industry to that was one of shock and absolute fury, which</p>
<p>is understandable.</p>
<p>I mean, industries do get gutted all the time, but I struggle to think of an analog of an</p>
<p>industry that got gutted that rapidly.</p>
<p>I mean, we could say that passenger train service certainly got gutted by airlines,</p>
<p>but that was a process that took place over decades and decades and decades.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t something that happened, really started showing up in the numbers in a single</p>
<p>digit number of months and started looking like an existential threat within a year or</p>
<p>two.</p>
<p>So the music industry is quite understandably in a state of shock and fury.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame them for that.</p>
<p>But then their reaction was catastrophic, both for themselves and almost for people</p>
<p>like us who were trying to do the cowboy in the white hat thing.</p>
<p>So our response to the music industry was, look, what you need to do to fight piracy,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t put the genie back in the bottle.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t switch off the internet.</p>
<p>Even if you all shut your eyes and wish very, very, very hard, the internet is not going</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>And these peer to peer technologies are genies out of the bottle.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, whatever you do, don&rsquo;t shut down Napster because if you do, suddenly</p>
<p>that technology is going to splinter into 30 different nodes that you&rsquo;ll never, ever</p>
<p>be able to shut off.</p>
<p>We suggested to them is like, look, what you want to do is to create a massively better</p>
<p>experience to piracy, something that&rsquo;s way better, that you sell at a completely reasonable</p>
<p>price.</p>
<p>And this is what it is.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just give people access to that very limited number of songs that they happen to</p>
<p>have acquired and paid for or pirated and have on their hard drive.</p>
<p>Give them access to all of the music in the world for a simple low price.</p>
<p>And obviously, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a crazy suggestion, I don&rsquo;t think, to anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ears today because that is how the majority of music is now being consumed online.</p>
<p>But in doing that, you&rsquo;re going to create a much, much better option to this kind of</p>
<p>crappy, kind of rickety, kind of buggy process of acquiring MP3s.</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately, the music industry was so angry about Napster and so forth that for</p>
<p>essentially three and a half years, they folded their arms, stamped their feet, and boycotted</p>
<p>the internet.</p>
<p>So they basically gave people who were fervently passionate about music and were digitally</p>
<p>modern, they gave them basically one choice.</p>
<p>If you want to have access to digital music, we, the music industry, insist that you steal</p>
<p>it because we are not going to sell it to you.</p>
<p>So what that did is it made an entire generation of people morally comfortable with swiping</p>
<p>the music because they felt quite pragmatically, well, they&rsquo;re not giving me any choice here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a 20 year old violating the 21 drinking age.</p>
<p>If they do that, they&rsquo;re not going to feel like felons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be like, this is an unreasonable law and I&rsquo;m skirting it, right?</p>
<p>So they make a whole generation of people morally comfortable with swiping music, but</p>
<p>also technically adept at it.</p>
<p>And when they did shut down Napster and kind of even trickier tools and like tweakier tools</p>
<p>like Kazaa and so forth came along, people just figured out how to do it.</p>
<p>So by the time they finally, grudgingly, it took years, allowed us to release this experience</p>
<p>that we were quite convinced would be better than piracy, we had this enormous hole had</p>
<p>been dug where lots of people said, music is a thing that is free and that&rsquo;s morally</p>
<p>okay and I know how to get it.</p>
<p>And so streaming took many, many, many more years to take off and become the gargantuan</p>
<p>thing the juggernaut is today than would have happened if they&rsquo;d made, pivoted to let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sell a better experience as opposed to demand that people want digital music, steal it.</p>
<p>Like what lessons do we draw from that?</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re probably in the midst of living through a bunch of similar situations in different</p>
<p>domains currently.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things in this world that are really painful.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you can draw perfect parallels, but fiat money versus cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of currently people in power who are kind of very skeptical about cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s changing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s arguable it&rsquo;s changing way too slowly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people making that argument where there should be a complete like Coinbase</p>
<p>and all this stuff switched to that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of other domains that where a pivot, like if you pivot now, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to win big, but you don&rsquo;t pivot because you&rsquo;re stubborn.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so, I mean, like, is this just the way that companies are?</p>
<p>A company succeeds initially and then it grows and there&rsquo;s a huge number of employees and</p>
<p>managers that don&rsquo;t have the guts or the institutional mechanisms to do the pivot.</p>
<p>Is that just the way of companies?</p>
<p>Well, I think what happens, I&rsquo;ll use the case of the music industry.</p>
<p>There was an economic model that had put food on the table and paid for marble lobbies and</p>
<p>seven and even eight figure executive salaries for many, many decades, which was the physical</p>
<p>collection of music.</p>
<p>And then you start talking about something like unlimited streaming and it seems so ephemeral</p>
<p>and like such a long shot that people start worrying about cannibalizing their own business</p>
<p>and they lose sight of the fact that something illicit is cannibalizing their business at</p>
<p>an extraordinarily fast rate.</p>
<p>And so if they don&rsquo;t do it themselves, they&rsquo;re doomed.</p>
<p>I mean, we used to put slides in front of these folks, this is really funny, where we</p>
<p>said, okay, let&rsquo;s assume Rhapsody, we want it to be 9.99 a month and we want it to be</p>
<p>12 months, so it&rsquo;s $120 a year from the budget of a music lover.</p>
<p>And then we were also able to get reasonably accurate statistics that showed how many CDs</p>
<p>per year the average person who bothered to collect music, which was not all people, actually</p>
<p>bought.</p>
<p>And it was overwhelmingly clear that the average CD buyer spends a hell of a lot less than</p>
<p>$120 a year on music.</p>
<p>This is a revenue expansion, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But all they could think of, and I&rsquo;m not saying this in a pejorative or patronizing way, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t blame them, they&rsquo;ve grown up in this environment for decades, all they could think</p>
<p>of was the incredible margins that they had on a CD.</p>
<p>And they would say, well, if this CD, by the mechanism that you guys are proposing, the</p>
<p>CD that I&rsquo;m selling for $17.99, somebody would need to stream those songs.</p>
<p>We were talking about a penny of playback then, it&rsquo;s less than that now that the record</p>
<p>labels get paid.</p>
<p>But would have to stream songs from that 1,799 times, it&rsquo;s never gonna happen.</p>
<p>So they were just sort of stuck in the model of this, but it&rsquo;s like, no, dude, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna spend money on all this other stuff.</p>
<p>So I think people get very hung up on that.</p>
<p>I mean, another example is really the taxi industry was not monolithic, like the music</p>
<p>labels.</p>
<p>There was a whole bunch of fleets and a whole bunch of cities, very, very fragmented, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an imperfect analogy.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, imagine if the taxi industry writ large upon seeing Uber said, oh my God,</p>
<p>people wanna be able to hail things easily, cheaply, they don&rsquo;t wanna mess with cash,</p>
<p>they wanna know how many minutes it&rsquo;s gonna be, they wanna know the fare in advance, and</p>
<p>they want a much bigger fleet than what we&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>If the taxi industry had rolled out something like that with the branding of yellow taxis,</p>
<p>universally known and kind of loved by Americans and expanded their fleet in a necessary manner,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Uber or Lyft ever would have gotten a foothold.</p>
<p>But the problem there was that real economics in the taxi industry wasn&rsquo;t with fares, it</p>
<p>was with the scarcity of medallions.</p>
<p>And so the taxi fleets, in many cases, owned gazillions of medallions whose value came</p>
<p>from their very scarcity.</p>
<p>So they simply couldn&rsquo;t pivot to that.</p>
<p>So I think you end up having these vested interests with economics that aren&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>visible to outsiders who get very, very reluctant to disrupt their own model, which is why it</p>
<p>ends up coming from the outside so frequently.</p>
<p>So you know what it takes to build a successful startup, but you&rsquo;re also an investor in a</p>
<p>lot of successful startups.</p>
<p>Let me ask for advice.</p>
<p>What do you think it takes to build a successful startup by way of advice?</p>
<p>JS Well, I think it starts, I mean, everything</p>
<p>starts and even ends with the founder.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s really, really important to look at the founder&rsquo;s motivations and their</p>
<p>sophistication about what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>In almost all cases that I&rsquo;m familiar with and have thought hard about, you&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>founder who was deeply, deeply inculcated in the domain of technology that they were</p>
<p>taking on.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about that is you could say, no, wait, how is that possible</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many young founders?</p>
<p>When you look at young founders, they&rsquo;re generally coming out of very nascent emerging</p>
<p>fields of technology where simply being present and accounted for and engaged in the community</p>
<p>for a period of even months is enough time to make them very, very deeply inculcated.</p>
<p>I mean, you look at Marc Andreessen and Netscape.</p>
<p>Marc had been doing visual web browsers when Netscape had been founded for what, a year</p>
<p>and a half, but he&rsquo;d created the first one in Mosaic when he was an undergrad.</p>
<p>And the commercial internet was pre nascent in 1994 when Netscape was founded.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s very, very deep in their domain.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg also, social networking, very deep in his domain, even though it was</p>
<p>nascent at the time.</p>
<p>Lots of people doing crypto stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, 10 years ago, even seven or eight years ago, by being a really, really vehement</p>
<p>and engaged participant in the crypto ecosystem, you could be an expert in that.</p>
<p>You look, however, at more established industries, take Salesforce.com.</p>
<p>Salesforce automation, pretty mature field when it got started.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the executive and the founder?</p>
<p>Marc Benioff, who has spent 13 years at Oracle and was an investor in Siebel Systems, which</p>
<p>ended up being Salesforce&rsquo;s main competition.</p>
<p>So more established, you need the entrepreneur to be very, very deep in the technology and</p>
<p>the culture of the space because you need that entrepreneur, that founder to have just</p>
<p>an unbelievably accurate intuitive sense for where the puck is going.</p>
<p>And that only comes from being very deep.</p>
<p>So that is sort of factor number one.</p>
<p>And the next thing is that that founder needs to be charismatic and or credible, or ideally</p>
<p>both in exactly the right ways to be able to attract a team that is bought into that</p>
<p>vision and is bought into that founder&rsquo;s intuitions being correct and not just the team,</p>
<p>obviously, but also the investors.</p>
<p>So it takes a certain personality type to pull that off.</p>
<p>Then the next thing I&rsquo;m still talking about the founder is a relentlessness and indeed</p>
<p>a monomania to put this above things that might rationally, should perhaps rationally</p>
<p>supersede it for a period of time to just relentlessly pivot when pivoting is called</p>
<p>for and it&rsquo;s always called for.</p>
<p>I mean, think of even very successful companies like how many times did Facebook pivot?</p>
<p>Newsfeed was something that was completely alien to the original version of Facebook</p>
<p>and came foundationally important.</p>
<p>How many times did Google, how many times at any given, how many times has Apple pivoted?</p>
<p>That founder energy and DNA when the founder moves on the DNA that&rsquo;s been inculcated</p>
<p>with a company has to have that relentlessness and that ability to pivot and pivot and pivot</p>
<p>without being worried about sacred cows.</p>
<p>And then the last thing I&rsquo;ll say about the founder before I get to the rest of the team</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;ll be mercifully brief is the founder has to be obviously a really great</p>
<p>hirer but just important a very good firer.</p>
<p>And firing is a horrific experience for both people involved in it.</p>
<p>It is a wrenching emotional experience.</p>
<p>And being good at realizing when this particular person is damaging the interests of the company</p>
<p>and the team and the shareholders and having the intestinal fortitude to have that conversation</p>
<p>and make it happen is something that most people don&rsquo;t have in them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that needs to be developed in most people or maybe some people have it</p>
<p>naturally.</p>
<p>But without that ability, that will take an A plus organization into B minus range very,</p>
<p>very quickly.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s all what needs to be present in the founder.</p>
<p>Can I just say?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>How damn good you are, Rob.</p>
<p>That was brilliant.</p>
<p>The one thing that was kind of really kind of surprising to me is having a deep technical</p>
<p>knowledge because I think the way you expressed it, which is that allows you to be really</p>
<p>honest with the capabilities of what like what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re often trying to do the impossible.</p>
<p>But in order to do the impossible, you have to be quote unquote impossible.</p>
<p>But you have to be honest with what is actually possible.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be the technical competence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be, in my view, just a complete immersion in that emerging market.</p>
<p>And so I can imagine there are a couple of people out there who have started really good</p>
<p>crypto projects who themselves are right in the code, but they&rsquo;re immersed in the culture</p>
<p>and through the culture and a deep understanding of what&rsquo;s happening and what&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>They can get a good intuition of what&rsquo;s possible, but the very first hire, I mean, a great way</p>
<p>to solve that is to have a technical co founder and dual founder companies have become extremely</p>
<p>common for that reason.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not doing that and you&rsquo;re not the technical person, but you are the founder,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to be really great at hiring a very damn good technical person very, very fast.</p>
<p>Can I on the founder ask you, is it possible to do this alone?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many people giving advice and saying that it&rsquo;s impossible to do the first few steps,</p>
<p>not impossible, but much more difficult to do it alone.</p>
<p>If we were to take the journey, especially in the software world where there&rsquo;s not significant</p>
<p>investment required for it to build something up, is it possible to go to a prototype to</p>
<p>something that essentially works and already has a huge number of customers alone?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>There are lots and lots of loan founder companies out there that have made an incredible difference.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not certainly putting rhapsody in the league of Spotify.</p>
<p>We were too early to be Spotify, but we did an awful lot of innovation.</p>
<p>And then after the company sold and ended up in the hands of real networks and MTV,</p>
<p>you know, got to millions of subs, right?</p>
<p>I was a loan founder and I studied Arabic and Middle Eastern history undergrad,</p>
<p>so I definitely wasn&rsquo;t very, very technical.</p>
<p>But yeah, loan founders can absolutely work.</p>
<p>And the advantage of a loan founder is you don&rsquo;t have the catastrophic potential</p>
<p>of a falling out between founders.</p>
<p>I mean, two founders who fall out with each other badly can rip a company to shreds because</p>
<p>they both have an enormous amount of equity and enormous amount of power.</p>
<p>And the capital structure is a result of that.</p>
<p>They both have an enormous amount of moral authority with the team as a result of each</p>
<p>having that founder role.</p>
<p>And I have witnessed over the years many, many situations in which companies have been shredded</p>
<p>or have suffered near fatal blows because of a falling out between founders.</p>
<p>And the more founders you add, the more risky that becomes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there should ever almost, I mean, you never say never, but multiple founders</p>
<p>beyond two is such an unstable and potentially treacherous situation that I would never,</p>
<p>ever recommend going beyond two.</p>
<p>But I do see value in the non technical sort of business and market and outside minded</p>
<p>founder teaming up with the technical founder.</p>
<p>There is a lot of merit to that, but there&rsquo;s a lot of danger in that less those two blow</p>
<p>apart.</p>
<p>Was it lonely for you?</p>
<p>Unbelievably.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the drawback.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re a lone founder, there is no other person that you can sit down with</p>
<p>and tackle problems and talk them through who has precisely or nearly precisely your</p>
<p>alignment of interests.</p>
<p>Your most trusted board member is likely an investor and therefore at the end of the</p>
<p>day has the interest of preferred stock in mind, not common stock.</p>
<p>Your most trusted VP, who might own a very significant stake in the company, doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>own anywhere near your stake in the company.</p>
<p>And so their long term interests may well be in getting the right level of experience</p>
<p>and credibility necessary to peel off and start their own company.</p>
<p>Or their interests might be aligned with jumping ship and setting up with a different</p>
<p>company, whether it&rsquo;s a rival or one in a completely different space.</p>
<p>So, yeah, being a lone founder is a spectacularly lonely thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a major downside to it.</p>
<p>What about mentorship?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re a mentor to a lot of people.</p>
<p>Can you find an alleviation to that loneliness in the space of ideas with a good mentor?</p>
<p>With a good mentor or like a mentor who&rsquo;s mentoring you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can a great deal, particularly if it&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s been through this very</p>
<p>process and has navigated it successfully and cares enough about you and your well being</p>
<p>to give you beautifully unvarnished advice.</p>
<p>That can be a huge, huge thing.</p>
<p>That can assuage things a great deal.</p>
<p>And I had a board member who was not an investor, who basically played that role for me to a</p>
<p>great degree.</p>
<p>He came in maybe halfway through the company&rsquo;s history, though.</p>
<p>I would have needed that the most in the very earliest days.</p>
<p>Yeah, the loneliness, that&rsquo;s the whole journey of life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always alone, alone together.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>It pays to embrace that.</p>
<p>You were saying that there might be something outside of the founder that&rsquo;s also that you</p>
<p>were promising to be brief on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>OK, so we talked about the founder.</p>
<p>You were asking what makes a great startup.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And great founder is thing number one, but then thing number two, and it&rsquo;s ginormous,</p>
<p>is a great team.</p>
<p>And so I said so much about the founder because one hopes or one believes that a founder who</p>
<p>is a great hirer is going to be hiring people and in charge of critical functions like</p>
<p>engineering and marketing and biz dev and sales and so forth, who themselves are great</p>
<p>hirers.</p>
<p>But what needs to radiate from the founder into the team that might be a little bit different</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s in the gene code of the founder?</p>
<p>The team needs to be fully bought in to the, you know, the intuitions and the vision of</p>
<p>the founder.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got that.</p>
<p>But the team needs to have a slightly different thing, which is, you know, it&rsquo;s 99% obsession</p>
<p>is execution, is to relentlessly hit the milestones, hit the objectives, hit the quarterly</p>
<p>goals.</p>
<p>That is, you know, 1% vision.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to lose that.</p>
<p>But execution machines, you know, people who have a demonstrated ability and a demonstrated</p>
<p>focus on, yeah, I go from point to point to point.</p>
<p>I try to beat and raise expectations relentlessly, never fall short, and, you know, both sort</p>
<p>of blaze and follow the path.</p>
<p>Not that the path is going to, I mean, blaze the trail as well.</p>
<p>I mean, a good founder is going to trust that VP of sales to have a better sense of what</p>
<p>it takes to build out that organization, what the milestones be.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be kind of a dialogue amongst those at the top.</p>
<p>But, you know, execution obsession in the team is the next thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some sense where the founder, you know, you talk about sort of the space</p>
<p>of ideas, like first principles thinking, asking big difficult questions of like future</p>
<p>trajectories or having a big vision and big picture dreams.</p>
<p>You can almost be a dreamer, it feels like, when you&rsquo;re like not the founder, but in the</p>
<p>space of sort of leadership.</p>
<p>But when it gets to the ground floor, there has to be execution, there has to be hitting</p>
<p>deadlines.</p>
<p>And sometimes those are attention.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about dreams that are attention with the pragmatic nature of execution.</p>
<p>Not dreams, but sort of ambitious vision.</p>
<p>And those have to be, I suppose, coupled.</p>
<p>The vision in the leader and the execution in the software world, that would be the programmer</p>
<p>or the designer.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Amongst many other things, you&rsquo;re an incredible conversationalist, a podcast, you host a podcast</p>
<p>called After On.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a million questions I want to ask you here, but one at the highest level,</p>
<p>what do you think makes for a great conversation?</p>
<p>I would say two things, one of two things, and ideally both of two things.</p>
<p>One is if something is beautifully architected, whether it&rsquo;s done deliberately and methodically</p>
<p>and willfully, as when I do it, or whether that just emerges from the conversation.</p>
<p>But something that&rsquo;s beautifully architected, that can create something that&rsquo;s incredibly</p>
<p>powerful and memorable, or something where there&rsquo;s just extraordinary chemistry.</p>
<p>And so with All In, or I&rsquo;ll go way back.</p>
<p>You might remember the NPR show Car Talk, I couldn&rsquo;t care less about auto mechanics</p>
<p>myself.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But I love that show because the banter between those two guys was just beyond, it was without</p>
<p>any parallel, right?</p>
<p>And some kind of edgy podcasts like Red Scare is just really entertaining to me because</p>
<p>the banter between the women on that show is just so good, and All In and that kind</p>
<p>of thing.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a combination of sort of the arc and the chemistry.</p>
<p>And I think because the arc can be so important, that&rsquo;s why very, very highly produced podcasts</p>
<p>like This American Life, obviously a radio show, but I think of a podcast because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how I always consume it, or Criminal, or a lot of what Wondery does and so forth.</p>
<p>That is real documentary making, and that requires a big team and a big budget relative</p>
<p>to the kinds of things you and I do, but nonetheless, then you got that arc, and that can be really,</p>
<p>really compelling.</p>
<p>But if we go back to conversation, I think it&rsquo;s a combination of structure and chemistry.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;ve actually personally have lost, I used to love This American Life, and for</p>
<p>some reason because it lacks the possibility of magic, it&rsquo;s engineered magic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fallen off of it myself as well.</p>
<p>I mean, when I fell madly in love with it during the aughts, it was the only thing going.</p>
<p>They were really smart to adopt podcasting as a distribution mechanism early.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think that maybe there&rsquo;s a little bit less magic there now because I think they</p>
<p>have agendas other than necessarily just delighting their listeners with quirky stories, which</p>
<p>I think is what it was all about back in the day and some other things.</p>
<p>Is there like a memorable conversation that you&rsquo;ve had on the podcast, whether it was</p>
<p>because it was wild and fun or one that was exceptionally challenging, maybe challenging</p>
<p>to prepare for, that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Is there something that stands out in your mind that you can draw an insight from?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this no way diminishes the episodes that will not be the answer to these two questions,</p>
<p>but an example of something that was really, really challenging to prepare for was George</p>
<p>Church.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;m sure you know and as I&rsquo;m sure many of your listeners know, he is one of the absolute</p>
<p>leading lights in the field of synthetic biology.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also unbelievably prolific.</p>
<p>His lab is large and has all kinds of efforts have spun out of that.</p>
<p>And what I wanted to make my George Church episode about was, first of all, grounding</p>
<p>people into what is this thing called Symbio.</p>
<p>And that required me to learn a hell of a lot more about Symbio than I knew going into</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>So there was just this very broad, I mean, I knew much more than the average person going</p>
<p>into that episode, but there was this incredible breadth of grounding that I needed to get</p>
<p>myself in the domain.</p>
<p>And then George does so many interesting things, there&rsquo;s so many interesting things emitting</p>
<p>from his lab that, you know, and he and I had a really good dialogue, he was a great</p>
<p>guide going into it.</p>
<p>Minnowing it down to the three to four that I really wanted us to focus on to create a</p>
<p>sense of wonder and magic in the listener of what could be possible from this very broad</p>
<p>spectrum domain, that was a doozy of a challenge.</p>
<p>That was a tough, tough, tough one to prepare for.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of something that was just wild and fun, unexpected, I mean, by the time we</p>
<p>sat down to interview, I knew where we were going to go.</p>
<p>But just in terms of the idea space, Don Hoffman, yeah, so Don Hoffman is, again, some listeners</p>
<p>probably know because he&rsquo;s, I think I was the first podcaster to interview him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some of your listeners are familiar with him, but he has this unbelievably contrarian</p>
<p>take on the nature of reality, but it is contrarian in a way that all the ideas are highly internally</p>
<p>consistent and snap together in a way that&rsquo;s just delightful.</p>
<p>And it seems as radically violating of our intuitions and as radically violating of the</p>
<p>probable nature of reality as anything that one can encounter.</p>
<p>But an analogy that he uses, which is very powerful, which is what intuition could possibly</p>
<p>be more powerful than the notion that there is a single unitary direction called down.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re on this big flat thing for which there is a thing called down.</p>
<p>And we all know, I mean, that&rsquo;s the most intuitive thing that one could probably think of.</p>
<p>And we all know that that ain&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>So my conversation with Don Hoffman was just wild and full of plot twists and interesting</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing about the wildness of his ideas, it&rsquo;s to me at least as a listener,</p>
<p>coupled with, he&rsquo;s a good listener and he empathizes with the people who challenge his</p>
<p>ideas.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s a better way to phrase that?</p>
<p>He is a welcoming of challenge in a way that creates a really fun conversation.</p>
<p>Oh, totally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He loves a parry or a jab, whatever the word is at his argument.</p>
<p>He honors it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very, very gentle and noncombatative soul, but then he is very good and takes great</p>
<p>evident joy in responding to that in a way that expands your understanding of his thinking.</p>
<p>Let me as a small tangent of tying up together our previous conversation about listening.com</p>
<p>and streaming and Spotify and the world of podcasting.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been talking about this magical medium of podcasting.</p>
<p>I have a lot of friends at Spotify in the high positions of Spotify as well.</p>
<p>I worry about Spotify and podcasting and the future of podcasting in general that moves</p>
<p>podcasting in the place of maybe walled gardens of sorts.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;ve had a foot in both worlds, have a foot in both worlds, do you worry as well</p>
<p>about the future of podcasting?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think walled gardens are really toxic to the medium that they start balkanizing.</p>
<p>So to take an example, I&rsquo;ll take two examples.</p>
<p>With music, it was a very, very big deal that at Rhapsody we were the first company to get</p>
<p>full catalog licenses from all back then there were five major music labels and also hundreds</p>
<p>and hundreds of indies because you needed to present the listener with a sense that</p>
<p>basically everything is there and there is essentially no friction to discovering that</p>
<p>which is new and you can wander this realm and all you really need is a good map, whether</p>
<p>it is something that somebody, the editorial team assembled or a good algorithm or whatever</p>
<p>it is, but a good map to wander this domain.</p>
<p>When you start walling things off, A, you undermine the joy of friction free discovery,</p>
<p>which is an incredibly valuable thing to deliver to your customer, both from a business standpoint</p>
<p>and simply from a humanistic standpoint of do you want to bring delight to people?</p>
<p>But it also creates an incredible opening vector for piracy.</p>
<p>And so something that&rsquo;s very different from the Rhapsody slash Spotify slash et cetera</p>
<p>like experience is what we have now in video.</p>
<p>Like wow, is that show on Hulu, is it on Netflix, is it on something like IFC channel, is it</p>
<p>on Discovery Plus, is it here, is it there?</p>
<p>And the more frustration and toe stubbing that people encounter when they are seeking</p>
<p>something and they&rsquo;re already paying a very respectable amount of money per month to have</p>
<p>access to content and they can&rsquo;t find it, the more that happens, the more people are</p>
<p>going to be driven to piracy solutions like to hell with it.</p>
<p>Never know where I&rsquo;m going to find something, I never know what it&rsquo;s going to cost.</p>
<p>Oftentimes really interesting things are simply unavailable.</p>
<p>That surprises me the number of times that I&rsquo;ve been looking for things I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think are that obscure that are just, it says not available in your geography, period, mister.</p>
<p>So I think that that&rsquo;s a mistake.</p>
<p>And then the other thing is for podcasters and lovers of podcasting, we should want to</p>
<p>resist this walled garden thing because A, it does smother this friction free or eradicate</p>
<p>this friction free discovery unless you want to sign up for lots of different services.</p>
<p>And also dims the voice of somebody who might be able to have a far, far, far bigger impact</p>
<p>by reaching far more neurons with their ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use an example from I guess it was probably the 90s or maybe it was the</p>
<p>aughts of Howard Stern, who had the biggest megaphone or maybe the second biggest after</p>
<p>Oprah megaphone in popular culture.</p>
<p>And because he was syndicated on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of radio stations</p>
<p>at a time when terrestrial broadcast was the main thing people listened to in their car,</p>
<p>no more obviously.</p>
<p>But when he decided to go over to satellite radio, I can&rsquo;t remember if it was XM or Sirius,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;d already merged at that point.</p>
<p>But when he did that, he made, you know, totally his right to do it, a financial calculation</p>
<p>that they were offering him a nine figure sum to do that.</p>
<p>But his audience, because not a lot of people were subscribing to satellite radio at that</p>
<p>point, his audience probably collapsed by, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it was as much</p>
<p>as 95%.</p>
<p>And so the influence that he had on the culture and his ability to sort of shape conversation</p>
<p>and so forth just got muted.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also there&rsquo;s a certain sense, especially in modern times, where the walled gardens</p>
<p>naturally lead to, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a term for it, but people who are not creatives</p>
<p>starting to have power over the creatives.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And even if they don&rsquo;t stifle it, if they&rsquo;re providing, you know, incentives within the</p>
<p>platform to shape, shift, or, you know, even completely mutate or distort the show, I mean,</p>
<p>imagine somebody has got, you know, a reasonably interesting idea for a podcast and they get</p>
<p>signed up with, let&rsquo;s say Spotify, and Spotify is going to give them financing to get the</p>
<p>thing spun up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And Spotify is going to give them a certain amount of really, you know, powerful placement,</p>
<p>you know, within the visual field of listeners.</p>
<p>But Spotify has conditions for that.</p>
<p>They say, look, you know, we think that your podcast will be much more successful if you</p>
<p>dumb it down about 60%.</p>
<p>If you add some, you know, silly, dirty jokes, if you do this, you do that.</p>
<p>And suddenly the person who is dependent upon Spotify for permission to come into existence</p>
<p>and is really dependent, really wants to please them, you know, to get that money in, to get</p>
<p>that placement, really wants to be successful.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you&rsquo;re having a dialogue between a complete non creative, some marketing,</p>
<p>you know, sort of data analytic person at Spotify and a creative that&rsquo;s going to shape</p>
<p>what that show is, you know, so that could be much more common.</p>
<p>And ultimately having the aggregate, an even bigger impact than, you know, the cancellation,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say if somebody who says the wrong word or voices the wrong idea, I mean, that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of what you have, not kind of, that&rsquo;s what you have with film and TV is that so much</p>
<p>influence is exerted over the storyline and the plots and the character arcs and all kinds</p>
<p>of things by executives who are completely alien to the experience and the skill set</p>
<p>of being a show runner in television, being a director in film that, you know, is meant</p>
<p>to like, oh, we can&rsquo;t piss off the Chinese market here or we can&rsquo;t say that or we need</p>
<p>to have, you know, cast members that have precisely these demographics reflected or</p>
<p>whatever it is that, you know, and obviously despite that extraordinary, at least TV shows</p>
<p>are now being made, um, you know, in terms of film, I think the quality has, has nosedived</p>
<p>of the average, let&rsquo;s say, say American film coming out of a major studio.</p>
<p>The average quality and my view has nosedived over the past decade as it&rsquo;s kind of, everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be a superhero franchise, but you know, great stuff gets made despite that.</p>
<p>But I have to assume that in some cases, at least in perhaps many cases, greater stuff</p>
<p>would be made if there was less interference from non creative executives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the flip side of that though, and this is, was the pitch of Spotify because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard their pitch is Netflix from everybody I&rsquo;ve heard that I&rsquo;ve spoken with about Netflix</p>
<p>is they actually empower the creator.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the heck they do, but they do a good job of giving creators, even the</p>
<p>crazy ones like Tim Dillon, like Joe Rogan, like comedians, freedom to be their crazy</p>
<p>selves.</p>
<p>And the result is like some of the greatest television, some of the greatest cinema, whatever</p>
<p>you call it, ever made.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what the heck they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a relative thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not able from what I understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a relative thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re interfering far, far, far less than, you know, NBC or, you know, AMC would have</p>
<p>interfered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a relative thing, and obviously they&rsquo;re the ones writing the checks and they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>ones giving the platforms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve every right to their own influence, obviously.</p>
<p>But my understanding is that they&rsquo;re relatively way more hands off and that has had a demonstrable</p>
<p>effect because I agree.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest, you know, video produced video content of all time, an incredibly inordinate</p>
<p>percentage of that is coming out from Netflix in just a few years when the history of cinema</p>
<p>goes back many, many decades.</p>
<p>And Spotify wants to be that for podcasting, and I hope they do become that for podcasting,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m wearing my skeptical goggles or skeptical hat, whatever the heck it is, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not easy to do and it requires, it requires letting go of power, giving power to the creatives.</p>
<p>It requires pivoting, which large companies, even as innovative as Spotify is, still now</p>
<p>a large company, pivoting into a whole new space is very tricky and difficult.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m skeptical, but hopeful.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today about life, about career?</p>
<p>We talked about startups, we talked about music, we talked about the end of human civilization.</p>
<p>Is there advice you would give to a young person today, maybe in college, maybe in high</p>
<p>school about their life?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, there&rsquo;s so many domains you can advise on, and I&rsquo;m not going to give advice</p>
<p>on life because I fear that I would drift into hallmark bromides that really wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be all that distinctive, and they might be entirely true.</p>
<p>Sometimes the greatest insights about life turn out to be the kinds of things you&rsquo;d see</p>
<p>on a hallmark card, so I&rsquo;m going to steer clear of that.</p>
<p>On a career level, one thing that I think is unintuitive but unbelievably powerful is</p>
<p>to focus not necessarily on being in the top sliver of 1% in excelling at one domain that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important and valuable, but to think in terms of intersections of two domains, which are</p>
<p>rare but valuable, and there&rsquo;s a couple reasons for this.</p>
<p>The first is in an incredibly competitive world that is so much more competitive than</p>
<p>it was when I was coming out of school, radically more competitive than when I was coming out</p>
<p>of school, to navigate your way to the absolute pinnacle of any domain.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to be really, really great at Python, pick a language, whatever it is.</p>
<p>You want to be one of the world&rsquo;s greatest Python developers, JavaScript, whatever your</p>
<p>language is.</p>
<p>Hopefully it&rsquo;s not Cobalt.</p>
<p>By the way, if you listen to this, I am actually looking for a Cobalt expert to interview because</p>
<p>I find the language fascinating, and there&rsquo;s not many of them, so please, if you know a</p>
<p>world expert in Cobalt or Fortran, both, actually.</p>
<p>Or if you are one.</p>
<p>Or if you are one, please email me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I mean, if you&rsquo;re going out there and you want to be in the top sliver 1% of Python</p>
<p>developers, it&rsquo;s a very, very difficult thing to do, particularly if you want to be number</p>
<p>one in the world, something like that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll use an analogy as I had a friend in college who was on a track and indeed succeeded</p>
<p>at that to become an Olympic medalist, and I think it was 100 meter breaststroke.</p>
<p>And he mortgaged a significant percentage of his college life to that goal, or I should</p>
<p>say dedicated or invested or whatever you wanted to say.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t participate in a lot of the social, a lot of the late night, a lot of</p>
<p>the this, a lot of the that, because he was training so much.</p>
<p>And obviously, he also wanted to keep up with his academics.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, the story has a happy ending in that he did medal in that.</p>
<p>Bronze, not gold, but holy cow, anybody who gets an Olympic medal, that&rsquo;s an extraordinary</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>And at that moment, he was one of the top three people on earth at that thing.</p>
<p>But wow, how hard to do that.</p>
<p>How many thousands of other people went down that path and made similar sacrifices and</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very hard to do that.</p>
<p>Whereas, and I&rsquo;ll use a personal example.</p>
<p>When I came out of business school, I went to a good business school and learned the</p>
<p>things that were there to be learned.</p>
<p>And I came out and I entered a world with lots of MBAs.</p>
<p>Harvard Business School, by the way.</p>
<p>Okay, yes, it was Harvard, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the first person who went there who didn&rsquo;t say where you went, which is beautiful.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the greatest business schools in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole nother fascinating conversation about that world.</p>
<p>But anyway, yes.</p>
<p>But anyway, so I learned the things that you learn getting an MBA from a top program.</p>
<p>And I entered a world that had hundreds of thousands of people who had MBAs, probably</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands who have them from top 10 programs.</p>
<p>So I was not particularly great at being an MBA person.</p>
<p>I was inexperienced relative to most of them and there were a lot of them, but it was okay</p>
<p>MBA person, right, newly minted.</p>
<p>But then as it happened, I found my way into working on the commercial internet in 1994.</p>
<p>So I went to a, at the time, giant hot computing company called Silicon Graphics, which had</p>
<p>enough heft and enough head count that they could take on and experienced MBAs and try</p>
<p>to train them in the world of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>But within that company that had an enormous amount of surface area and was touching a</p>
<p>lot of areas and had unbelievably smart people at the time, it was not surprising that SGI</p>
<p>started doing really interesting and innovative and trailblazing stuff on the internet before</p>
<p>almost anybody else.</p>
<p>And part of the reason was that our founder, Jim Clark, went off to cofound Netscape with</p>
<p>Mark Andreessen.</p>
<p>So the whole company is like, wait, what was that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this commercial internet thing?</p>
<p>So I ended up in that group.</p>
<p>Now in terms of being a commercial internet person or a worldwide web person, again, I</p>
<p>was in that case, barely credentialed, I couldn&rsquo;t write a stitch of code, but I had a pretty</p>
<p>good mind for grasping the business and cultural significance of this transition.</p>
<p>And this was, again, we were talking earlier about emerging areas.</p>
<p>Within a few months, you know, I was in the relatively top echelon of people in terms</p>
<p>of just sheer experience, because like, let&rsquo;s say it was five months into the program, there</p>
<p>were only so many people who&rsquo;d been doing worldwide web stuff commercially for five</p>
<p>months, you know?</p>
<p>And then what was interesting though was the intersection of those two things.</p>
<p>The commercial web, as it turned out, grew into an unbelievable vastness.</p>
<p>And so by being a pretty good, okay web person and a pretty good, okay MBA person, that intersection</p>
<p>put me in a very rare group, which was web oriented MBAs.</p>
<p>And in those early days, you could probably count on your fingers the number of people</p>
<p>who came out of really competitive programs who were doing stuff full time on the internet.</p>
<p>And there was a greater appetite for great software developers in the internet domain,</p>
<p>but there was an appetite and a real one and a rapidly growing one for MBA thinkers who</p>
<p>were also seasoned and networked in the emerging world of the commercial worldwide web.</p>
<p>And so finding an intersection of two things you can be pretty good at, but is a rare intersection</p>
<p>and a special intersection is probably a much easier way to make yourself distinguishable</p>
<p>and in demand from the world than trying to be world class at this one thing.</p>
<p>So in the intersection is where there&rsquo;s to be discovered opportunity and success.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually more intersection of fields and fields themselves, right?</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;ll give you kind of a funny hypothetical here, but it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>thinking about a little bit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people in crypto right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be hard to be in the top percentile of crypto people, whether it comes from just</p>
<p>having a sheer grasp of the industry, a great network within the industry, technological</p>
<p>skills, whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this parallel world and orthogonal world called crop insurance.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s a big world.</p>
<p>Crop insurance is a very, very big deal, particularly in the wealthy and industrialized world where</p>
<p>people through sophisticated financial markets, rule of law and large agricultural concerns</p>
<p>that are worried about that.</p>
<p>Somewhere out there is somebody who is pretty crypto savvy, but probably not top 1%, but</p>
<p>also has kind of been in the crop insurance world and understands that a hell of a lot</p>
<p>better than almost anybody who&rsquo;s ever had anything to do with cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>And so I think that decentralized finance, DeFi, one of the interesting and I think very</p>
<p>world positive things that I think it&rsquo;s almost inevitably will be bringing to the world is</p>
<p>crop insurance for small holding farmers.</p>
<p>I mean, people who have tiny, tiny plots of land in places like India, et cetera, where</p>
<p>there is no crop insurance available to them because just the financial infrastructure</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s highly imaginable that using Oracle networks that are trusted outside deliverers</p>
<p>of factual information about rainfall in a particular area, you can start giving drought</p>
<p>insurance to folks like this.</p>
<p>The right person to come up with that idea is not a crypto whiz who doesn&rsquo;t know a blasted</p>
<p>thing about small holding farmers.</p>
<p>The right person to come up with that is not a crop insurance whiz who isn&rsquo;t quite sure</p>
<p>what Bitcoin is, but somebody occupies that intersection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one of gazillion examples of things that are going to come along for somebody</p>
<p>who occupies the right intersection of skills, but isn&rsquo;t necessarily the number one person</p>
<p>at either one of those expertises.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s making me kind of wonder about my own little things that I&rsquo;m average at and seeing</p>
<p>where the intersections that could be exploited.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty profound.</p>
<p>So we talked quite a bit about the end of the world and how we&rsquo;re both optimistic about</p>
<p>us figuring our way out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for now at least, both you and I are going to die one day, way too soon.</p>
<p>First of all, that sucks.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>I mean, one, I&rsquo;d like to ask if you ponder your own mortality, how does that kind of,</p>
<p>what kind of wisdom inside does it give you about your own life?</p>
<p>And broadly, do you think about your life and what the heck it&rsquo;s all about?</p>
<p>Yeah, with respect to pondering mortality, I do try to do that as little as possible</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not a lot I can do about it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s inevitably there.</p>
<p>And I think that what it does when you think about it in the right way is it makes you</p>
<p>realize how unbelievably rare and precious the moments that we have here are, and therefore</p>
<p>how consequential the decisions that we make about how to spend our time are.</p>
<p>You know, like, do you do those 17 nagging emails or do you have dinner with somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s really important to you who haven&rsquo;t seen in three and a half years?</p>
<p>If you had an infinite expanse of time in front of you, you might well rationally conclude</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do those emails because collectively they&rsquo;re rather important.</p>
<p>And I have tens of thousands of years to catch up with my buddy, Tim.</p>
<p>But I think the scarcity of the time that we have helps us choose the right things if</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re tuned to that and we&rsquo;re attuned to the context that mortality puts over the consequence</p>
<p>of every decision we make of how to spend our time.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re all very good at it, it doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m very good at it.</p>
<p>But it does add a dimension of choice and significance to everything that we elect to</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny that you say you try to think about it as little as possible.</p>
<p>I would venture to say you probably think about the end of human civilization more than</p>
<p>you do about your own life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>Because that feels like a problem that could be solved.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Whereas the end of my own life can&rsquo;t be solved.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s transhumanists who have incredible optimism about near or intermediate future</p>
<p>therapies that could really, really change human lifespan.</p>
<p>I really hope that they&rsquo;re right, but I don&rsquo;t have a whole lot to add to that project because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a life scientist myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in part also afraid of immortality.</p>
<p>Not as much, but close to as I&rsquo;m afraid of death itself.</p>
<p>So it feels like the things that give us meaning give us meaning because of the scarcity that</p>
<p>surrounds it.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost afraid of having too much of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Although, if there was something that said, this can expand your enjoyable wellspan or</p>
<p>lifespan by 75 years, I&rsquo;m all in.</p>
<p>Well, part of the reason I wanted to not do a startup, really the only thing that worries</p>
<p>me about doing a startup is if it becomes successful.</p>
<p>Because of how much I dream, how much I&rsquo;m driven to be successful, that there will not</p>
<p>be enough silence in my life, enough scarcity to appreciate the moments I appreciate now</p>
<p>as deeply as I appreciate them now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a simplicity to my life now that it feels like you might disappear with success.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say might.</p>
<p>I think if you start a company that has ambitious investors, ambitious for the returns that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d like to see, that has ambitious employees, ambitious for the career trajectories they</p>
<p>want to be on and so forth, and is driven by your own ambition, there&rsquo;s a profound monogamy</p>
<p>to that.</p>
<p>It is very, very hard to carve out time to be creative, to be peaceful, to be so forth</p>
<p>because of with every new employee that you hire, that&rsquo;s one more mouth to feed.</p>
<p>With every new investor that you take on, that&rsquo;s one more person to whom you really</p>
<p>do want to deliver great returns.</p>
<p>As the valuation ticks up, the threshold to delivering great returns for your investors</p>
<p>always rises.</p>
<p>There is an extraordinary monogamy to being a founder CEO above all for the first few</p>
<p>years and first in people&rsquo;s minds could be as many as 10 or 15.</p>
<p>But I guess the fundamental calculation is whether the passion for the vision is greater</p>
<p>than the cost you&rsquo;ll pay.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all opportunity cost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all opportunity cost in terms of time and attention and experience.</p>
<p>And some things like I&rsquo;m, everyone&rsquo;s different, but I&rsquo;m less calculating some things you just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just dive in.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I mean you can do balance sheets all you want on this versus that and what&rsquo;s the right.</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;ve done it in the past and it&rsquo;s never worked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been like, okay, what&rsquo;s my gut screaming at me to do?</p>
<p>But about the meaning of life, you ever think about that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, this is where I&rsquo;m going to go all hallmarking on you, but I think that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a few things and one of them is certainly love and the love that we experience and feel</p>
<p>and cause to well up in others is something that&rsquo;s just so profound and goes beyond almost</p>
<p>anything else that we can do.</p>
<p>And whether that is something that lies in the past, like maybe there was somebody that</p>
<p>you were dating and loved very profoundly in college and haven&rsquo;t seen in years, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the significance of that love is any way diminished by the fact that it had a notional</p>
<p>beginning and end.</p>
<p>The fact is that you experience that and you trigger that in somebody else and that happened.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be, certainly it doesn&rsquo;t have to be love of romantic partners alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s family members, it&rsquo;s love between friends, it&rsquo;s love between creatures.</p>
<p>I had a dog for 10 years who passed away a while ago and experienced unbelievable love</p>
<p>with her.</p>
<p>It can be love of that which you create and we were talking about the flow states that</p>
<p>we enter and the pride or lack of pride or in the Minsky case, your hatred of that which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, the creations that we make and whether it&rsquo;s the love or the joy or the</p>
<p>engagement or the perspective shift that that cascades into other minds, I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a big, big, big part of the meaning of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that everybody participates in necessarily, although I think we all do</p>
<p>at least in a very local level by the example that we set, by the interactions that we have.</p>
<p>But for people who create works that travel far and reach people they&rsquo;ll never meet, that</p>
<p>reach countries they&rsquo;ll never visit, that reach people perhaps that come along and come</p>
<p>across their ideas or their works or their stories or their aesthetic creations of other</p>
<p>sorts long after they&rsquo;re dead, I think that&rsquo;s really, really big part of the fabric of the</p>
<p>meaning of life.</p>
<p>So all these things like love and creation, I think really is what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>And part of love is also the loss of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Louis episode with Louis C.K. where an old gentleman is giving him advice that</p>
<p>sometimes the sweetest parts of love is when you lose it and you remember it, sort of you</p>
<p>reminisce on the loss of it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some aspect in which, and I have many of those in my own life, that almost</p>
<p>like the memories of it and the intensity of emotion you still feel about it is like</p>
<p>the sweetest part.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, after saying goodbye, you relive it.</p>
<p>So that goodbye is also a part of love.</p>
<p>The loss of it is also a part of love.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s back to that scarcity.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say the loss is the best part personally, but it definitely is an aspect of it.</p>
<p>And the grief you might feel about something that&rsquo;s gone makes you realize what a big deal</p>
<p>it was.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this particular journey we went on together come to an end.</p>
<p>So I have to say goodbye and I hate saying goodbye.</p>
<p>Rob, this is truly an honor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really been a big fan.</p>
<p>People should definitely check out your podcast, your Master What You Do in the conversation</p>
<p>space, in the writing space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an incredible honor that you would show up here and spend this time with me.</p>
<p>I really, really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been a huge honor to be here as well, and also a fan in heaven for a long</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Rob Reed.</p>
<p>And thank you to Athletic Greens, Belcampo, Fundrise, and NetSuite.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Plato.</p>
<p>We can easily forgive a child who&rsquo;s afraid of the dark.</p>
<p>The real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
