    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Chris Tarbell,</p>
<p>a former FBI special agent and cybercrime specialist</p>
<p>who tracked down and arrested Russ Ulbricht,</p>
<p>the leader of Silk Road,</p>
<p>the billion dollar drug marketplace.</p>
<p>And he tracked down and arrested Hector Monsegur,</p>
<p>aka Sabu, of LulzSec and Anonymous,</p>
<p>which are some of the most influential</p>
<p>hacker groups in history.</p>
<p>He is co-founder of Naxo,</p>
<p>a complex cybercrime investigation firm,</p>
<p>and is a co-host of a podcast</p>
<p>called The Hacker and the Fed.</p>
<p>This conversation gives the perspective</p>
<p>of the FBI cybercrime investigator,</p>
<p>both the technical and the human story.</p>
<p>I would also like to interview people on the other side,</p>
<p>the cybercriminals who have been caught,</p>
<p>and perhaps the cybercriminals who have not been caught</p>
<p>and are still out there.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got True Classic Tees for shirts,</p>
<p>Inside Tracker for bio-monitoring,</p>
<p>ExpressVPN for privacy,</p>
<p>BetterHelp for mental health,</p>
<p>and Blinkist for non-fiction.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by True Classic Tees,</p>
<p>high-quality, soft, slim-fitted t-shirts for men.</p>
<p>They also make other menswear staples</p>
<p>like polos, workout shirts, and boxers,</p>
<p>but I have a lot of their black t-shirts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my main go-to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certain kind of comfort</p>
<p>in having a great t-shirt that all looks the same,</p>
<p>and having many of them.</p>
<p>So it removes that extra little decision</p>
<p>in your life.</p>
<p>So you can liberate your mind</p>
<p>to focus on the more difficult decisions in your life.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just this reliable thing I can count on.</p>
<p>Either I wear a suit,</p>
<p>or I wear a True Classic Tee t-shirt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I need to worry about.</p>
<p>Life is simple.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a kind of minimalist aesthetic</p>
<p>to a black t-shirt that just brings out the best in me,</p>
<p>makes my soul sing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also, in part,</p>
<p>a programmer aesthetic, engineer aesthetic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure.</p>
<p>But I do know that a lot of programmers I hang out with</p>
<p>often wear black t-shirts.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure what that&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>That could also just be, in general, a guy thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to get some data on that.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to trueclassic.com and enter code LEX</p>
<p>to get 25% off.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by InsideTracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>Your lifestyle decisions should be made</p>
<p>based on data coming from your own body.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait until the day that we have high bandwidth</p>
<p>signal coming from the body</p>
<p>at a frequency that&rsquo;s exceptionally high</p>
<p>so we have this short-term and long-term data</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on inside our body.</p>
<p>Just raw data.</p>
<p>So machine learning algorithms can just interpret that data</p>
<p>to make decisions based on.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, that&rsquo;s such an exciting world</p>
<p>of creating systems that are able</p>
<p>to truly listen to our body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s experiences I have by going to doctors.</p>
<p>I think the job of a doctor is so difficult.</p>
<p>They get just few little inklings</p>
<p>into the symptoms you provide.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some data they can collect.</p>
<p>They can do MRIs and all that kind of scans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a high-resolution picture</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on in your body.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re the average case</p>
<p>for a particular condition or disease</p>
<p>or a particular issue you&rsquo;re having in your life,</p>
<p>yeah, fine.</p>
<p>But a lot of us are not</p>
<p>the perfectly representative average case.</p>

<p>This show is brought to you by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I use them to protect my privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>This conversation talks a lot about Tor,</p>
<p>which is a super extreme way</p>
<p>to protect your privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s like advanced stuff.</p>
<p>The basic stuff that everybody should be doing is a VPN.</p>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p>And my favorite VPN,</p>
<p>long, long, long before they were a sponsor,</p>
<p>has been ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>Big, sexy button.</p>
<p>It just works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super fast.</p>
<p>Any operating system, including Linux,</p>
<p>whatever your favorite flavor of Linux is,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve tried them all,</p>
<p>I like all of the flavors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually factually incorrect</p>
<p>because I love all the flavors of Linux that I&rsquo;ve tried,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a huge amount of them.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a website called DistroWatch</p>
<p>that looks at the popularity</p>
<p>based on how often they&rsquo;re searched, I think,</p>
<p>of different distributions of Linux.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of cool to see all the different flavors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really exciting how active the community is</p>
<p>in the development of those flavors.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of ways</p>
<p>in which social media reveals</p>
<p>the mental instabilities that we have,</p>
<p>the sort of the rollercoaster of life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to lose yourself in that</p>
<p>and not seek balance and a deep exploration of your mind</p>
<p>beyond that kind of shallow rollercoaster.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a huge believer of talk therapy</p>
<p>as a way to do that kind of serious exploration,</p>
<p>however you do that.</p>
<p>And I think the great thing about BetterHelp</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s super easy to do that.</p>
<p>It makes it accessible to try.</p>
<p>You get access to a licensed professional really quickly.</p>

<p>that do summarization.</p>
<p>And let me tell you something.</p>
<p>While that&rsquo;s nice and everything,</p>
<p>they do not do nearly as good of a job as humans do,</p>
<p>especially when those humans are the sort of</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just that it&rsquo;s brief.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also somehow reveals something new.</p>
<p>Even for books I&rsquo;ve read, it&rsquo;s revisiting the summaries</p>
<p>gives me a new perspective in that book.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s really, really powerful.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Chris Tarbell.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>You are one of the most successful</p>
<p>cybersecurity law enforcement agents of all time.</p>
<p>You tracked and brought down Russ Albrecht,</p>
<p>AKA Dread Pirate Roberts, who ran Silk Road,</p>
<p>and Sabu of LulzSec and Anonymous,</p>
<p>who was one of the most influential hackers in the world.</p>
<p>So first, can you tell me the story</p>
<p>of tracking down Russ Albrecht and Silk Road?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start from the very beginning.</p>
<p>And maybe let&rsquo;s start by explaining what is the Silk Road.</p>
<p>It was really the first dark market website.</p>
<p>You literally could buy anything there.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s take that back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two things you couldn&rsquo;t buy there.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t buy guns, because that was a different website.</p>
<p>And you couldn&rsquo;t buy fake degrees.</p>
<p>So no one could become a doctor.</p>
<p>But you could buy literally whatever else you wanted.</p>
<p>You could host things, drugs.</p>
<p>You could buy heroin right from Afghanistan, the good stuff.</p>
<p>Hacking tools, you could hack for hire.</p>
<p>You could buy murders for hire,</p>
<p>if you wanted someone killed.</p>
<p>Now, so when I was an FBI agent,</p>
<p>I had to kind of sell some of these cases,</p>
<p>and this was a big drug case.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the way people saw Silk Road.</p>
<p>So internally to the FBI, how I had to sell it,</p>
<p>I had to find the worst thing on there</p>
<p>that I could possibly find.</p>
<p>And I think one time I saw a posting for baby parts.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that you had a young child</p>
<p>and that needed a liver.</p>
<p>You could literally go on there</p>
<p>and ask for a six-month-old liver if you wanted to.</p>
<p>For like surgical operations versus something darker.</p>
<p>Yeah, I never saw anything that dark</p>
<p>as far as people wanted to eat body parts.</p>
<p>I did interview a cannibal once when I was in the FBI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another crazy story.</p>
<p>But that one actually weirded me out.</p>
<p>Sorry, I just watched Jeffrey Dahmer documentary on Netflix</p>
<p>and it just changed the way I see human beings</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a portrayal of a normal looking person</p>
<p>doing really dark things and doing so</p>
<p>not out of a place of insanity seemingly,</p>
<p>but just because he has almost like a fetish</p>
<p>for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disturbing that people like that are out there.</p>
<p>So people like that would then be using Silk Road,</p>
<p>not like that necessarily,</p>
<p>but people of different walks of life</p>
<p>would be using Silk Road to primarily,</p>
<p>what was the primary thing?</p>
<p>Drugs?</p>
<p>It was primarily drugs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it started.</p>
<p>It started off with Ross Ulbrich growing mushrooms</p>
<p>out in the wilderness of California and selling them.</p>
<p>But really his was more of a libertarian viewpoint.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like,</p>
<p>you choose what you wanna do for yourself and do it.</p>
<p>And the way Silk Road kind of had the anonymity</p>
<p>is it used what&rsquo;s called TOR, the Onion Router,</p>
<p>which is an anonymizing function on the deep web.</p>
<p>It was actually invented by the US Navy</p>
<p>back in the mid nineties or so,</p>
<p>but it also used cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>So it was the first time that we saw this birth</p>
<p>on the internet of mixing cryptocurrency</p>
<p>and an IP blocking software.</p>
<p>So in cybercrime, you go after one, the IP address</p>
<p>and trace it through the network,</p>
<p>or two, you go after the cash.</p>
<p>And this one kind of blocked both.</p>
<p>Cash meaning the flow of money, physical or digital.</p>
<p>And then IP is some kind of identifying thing</p>
<p>over the computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your telephone number on your computer.</p>
<p>So yeah, all computers have a unique four octet numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 123.123.123.123.</p>
<p>And the computer uses DNS or domain name services</p>
<p>to render that name.</p>
<p>So if you were looking for cnn.com,</p>
<p>your computer then translates that to that IP address</p>
<p>or that telephone number</p>
<p>where it can find that information.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t Silk Road used to have guns in the beginning?</p>
<p>Or was that considered to have guns</p>
<p>or did it naturally emerge</p>
<p>and then Russ realized like, this is not good?</p>
<p>It went back and forth.</p>
<p>I think there were guns on there and he tried to police it.</p>
<p>He told himself that they&rsquo;re the captain of the boat,</p>
<p>so you had to follow his rules.</p>
<p>So I think he took off those posts eventually</p>
<p>and moved guns elsewhere.</p>
<p>What was the system of censorship that he used</p>
<p>of selecting what is okay and not okay?</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>Him alone, he&rsquo;s the captain of the boat.</p>
<p>Do you know by chance if there was a lot of debates</p>
<p>and criticisms internally amongst the criminals</p>
<p>of what is and isn&rsquo;t allowed?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting to see</p>
<p>a totally different moral code emerge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s outside the legal code of society.</p>
<p>We did get the server</p>
<p>and was able to read all of the chat logs</p>
<p>that happened.</p>
<p>I mean, all the records were there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember big debates.</p>
<p>I mean, there was a clear leadership</p>
<p>and that was the final decision.</p>
<p>That was the CEO of Silk Road.</p>
<p>And so primarily it was drugs</p>
<p>and primarily out of an ideology of freedom,</p>
<p>which is if you want to use drugs,</p>
<p>you should be able to use drugs.</p>
<p>You should put into your body</p>
<p>what you wanna put in your body.</p>
<p>And when you were presenting the case</p>
<p>of why this should be investigated,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to find, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>the worst possible things on there.</p>
<p>Is that what you were saying?</p>
<p>So we had arrested a guy named Jeremy Hammond</p>
<p>and he hit himself.</p>
<p>He was a hacker and this would be arrested.</p>
<p>It was the second time he had been arrested for hacking.</p>
<p>He used TOR.</p>
<p>And so that kind of brought us to a point.</p>
<p>The FBI has a computer system where you look up things.</p>
<p>You know, you look up anything.</p>
<p>I could look up your name or whatever</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re associated with my case.</p>
<p>And we were finding at the time,</p>
<p>a lot of things in, when you look it up,</p>
<p>a case would end and be like, oh, this is TOR.</p>
<p>It just stopped.</p>
<p>Like we couldn&rsquo;t get any further.</p>
<p>So, you know, we had just had this big arrest of Sabu</p>
<p>and took down Anonymous.</p>
<p>And sometimes in the FBI,</p>
<p>the way it used to, the old school FBI,</p>
<p>when you had a big case and you&rsquo;re working seven days a week</p>
<p>and 14 hours, 15 hours a day,</p>
<p>you sort of take a break.</p>
<p>The boss kind of said, yeah, I&rsquo;ll see you in a few months.</p>
<p>Go get to know your family a little bit, you know,</p>
<p>and come back.</p>
<p>But the group of guys I was with was like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s find the next big challenge.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we were finding, you know,</p>
<p>case closed, it was TOR.</p>
<p>Case closed, it was TOR.</p>
<p>So I said, let&rsquo;s take a look at TOR</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see what we can do.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll take a different approach.</p>
<p>And Silk Road was being looked at by other law enforcement,</p>
<p>but it was taking like a drug approach</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m going to find a drug buyer</p>
<p>who got the drug sent to them in the mail</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s arrest up, let&rsquo;s go up the chain.</p>
<p>But the buyers didn&rsquo;t know their dealers.</p>
<p>They never met them.</p>
<p>And so you were taking a cyber security approach.</p>
<p>Yeah, we said, let&rsquo;s try to look at this</p>
<p>from a cyber approach and see if we can gleam</p>
<p>anything out of it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually indirectly connected to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not admitting anything that&rsquo;s not already</p>
<p>on my FBI file.</p>
<p>Oh, I can already tell you what you&rsquo;re gonna tell me though.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>That when you were at college, you wrote a paper</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re connected to the person that started.</p>
<p>You son of a bitch, you clever son of a bitch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an FBI agent or a former FBI agent.</p>
<p>How would I not have known that?</p>
<p>I could have told you other stuff.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s exactly what you were about to tell me.</p>
<p>I was looking up his name because I forgot it.</p>
<p>So one of my advisors for my PhD was Rachel Greenstead</p>
<p>and she is married to Roger Dingle Dine,</p>
<p>which is the co-founder of the Tor Project.</p>
<p>And I actually reached out to him last night</p>
<p>to do a podcast together.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I have&hellip;</p>
<p>No, it was a good party trick.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just cool that you know this</p>
<p>and the timing of it, it was just like beautiful.</p>
<p>But just to linger on the Tor Project so we understand.</p>
<p>So Tor is this black box that people disappear in,</p>
<p>in terms of like the, when you were tracking people.</p>
<p>Can you paint a picture of what Tor is used in general?</p>
<p>Are there&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you talk about Bitcoin, for example,</p>
<p>cryptocurrency, especially today,</p>
<p>much more people use it for legal activity</p>
<p>versus illegal activity.</p>
<p>What about Tor?</p>
<p>Tor was originally invented by the US Navy</p>
<p>so that like spies inside countries could talk to spies</p>
<p>and no one could find them.</p>
<p>There was no way of tracing them.</p>
<p>And then they released that information free to the world.</p>
<p>So Tor has two different versions of&hellip;</p>
<p>Versions, two different ways it can be utilized.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s .onion sites, which is like a normal website,</p>
<p>.com, but it&rsquo;s only found within the Tor browser.</p>
<p>You can only get there if you know the whole address</p>
<p>and get there.</p>
<p>The other way Tor is used is to go through the internet</p>
<p>and then come out the other side</p>
<p>if you want a different IP address,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to hide your identity.</p>
<p>So if you were doing like say cybercrime,</p>
<p>I would have the victim computer</p>
<p>and I would trace it back out to a Tor relay.</p>
<p>And then because you don&rsquo;t have an active connection</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s called a circuit at the time,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to trace it back.</p>
<p>But even if you had an active circuit,</p>
<p>I would have to go to each machine physically live</p>
<p>and try to rebuild that, which is literally impossible.</p>
<p>So what do you feel about Tor, ethically, philosophically,</p>
<p>as a human being on this world</p>
<p>that spent quite a few years of your life</p>
<p>and still trying to protect people?</p>
<p>So part of my time in the FBI</p>
<p>was working on child exploitation,</p>
<p>kiddie porn, as they call it.</p>
<p>That really changed my life in a way.</p>
<p>And so anything that helps facilitate</p>
<p>the exploitation of children fucking pisses me off.</p>
<p>And that sort of jaded my opinion towards Tor</p>
<p>because that, because it helps facilitate those sites.</p>
<p>So this ideal of freedom that Russell Albrecht,</p>
<p>for example, tried to embody</p>
<p>is something that you don&rsquo;t connect with anymore</p>
<p>because of what you&rsquo;ve seen that ideal being used for.</p>
<p>I mean, the child exploitation is a specific example for it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy for me to sit here</p>
<p>and say child exploitation, child porn,</p>
<p>because no one listening to this</p>
<p>is ever going to say that I&rsquo;m wrong</p>
<p>and that we should allow child porn.</p>
<p>Should, because some people utilize it in a bad way,</p>
<p>should it go away?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I&rsquo;m a technologist.</p>
<p>I want technology to move forward.</p>
<p>People are going to do bad things</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to use technology</p>
<p>to help them do bad things.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you then,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll jump around a little bit,</p>
<p>but the things you were able to do</p>
<p>in tracking down information, and we&rsquo;ll get to it,</p>
<p>there is some suspicion that this was only possible</p>
<p>with mass surveillance, like with NSA, for example.</p>
<p>First of all, is there any truth to that?</p>
<p>And second of all, what do you feel</p>
<p>are the pros and cons of mass surveillance?</p>
<p>There is no truth to that.</p>
<p>And then my feelings on mass surveillance.</p>
<p>If there was, would you tell me?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>I love this conversation so much.</p>
<p>But what do you feel about the,</p>
<p>given that you said child porn,</p>
<p>what are the pros and cons of surveillance</p>
<p>at a society level?</p>
<p>I mean, nobody wants to give up their privacy.</p>
<p>I say that, I say no one wants to give up their privacy,</p>
<p>but I mean, I used to have to get a search warrant</p>
<p>to look inside your house,</p>
<p>or I can just log onto your Facebook</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got pictures of all inside your house</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not, so people like the idea</p>
<p>of not giving up their privacy, but they do it anyways.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re giving away their freedoms all the time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re carrying watches that gives out their heartbeat,</p>
<p>a weight of companies that are storing that.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s more personal than your heartbeat?</p>
<p>So I think people on mass really want to protect their</p>
<p>privacy, and I would say most people don&rsquo;t really need</p>
<p>to protect their privacy.</p>
<p>But the case against mass surveillance is that</p>
<p>if you want to criticize the government</p>
<p>in a very difficult time, you should be able to do it.</p>
<p>So when you need the freedom, you should have it.</p>
<p>So when you wake up one day and realize</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something going wrong with the country I love,</p>
<p>I want to be able to help.</p>
<p>One of the great things about the United States of America</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s that individual revolutionary spirit.</p>
<p>So that the government doesn&rsquo;t become too powerful.</p>
<p>You can always protest.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always the best of the ideal of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>You can always say fuck you to the man.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a concern of direct or indirect</p>
<p>suppression of that through mass surveillance.</p>
<p>You might not, is that little subtle fear</p>
<p>that grows with time, that why bother criticizing</p>
<p>the government?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a headache.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get a ticket every time I say something bad.</p>
<p>That kind of thing.</p>
<p>So it can get out of hand.</p>
<p>The bureaucracy grows and the freedoms slip away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the criticism, right?</p>
<p>I completely see your point and I agree with it.</p>
<p>I mean, on the other side, people criticize</p>
<p>the government of these freedoms.</p>
<p>But I mean, tech companies talk about destroying</p>
<p>your privacy and controlling what you can say.</p>
<p>I realize they&rsquo;re private platforms</p>
<p>and they can decide what&rsquo;s on their platform.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re taking away your freedoms</p>
<p>of what you can say.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve heard some things where maybe government</p>
<p>officials were in line with tech companies</p>
<p>to take away some of that freedom.</p>
<p>And I agree with you, that gets scary.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something about government</p>
<p>that feels maybe because of the history</p>
<p>of human civilization, maybe because tech companies</p>
<p>are a new thing, but just knowing the history</p>
<p>of abuses of government, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about government that enables the corrupting</p>
<p>nature of power to take hold at scale</p>
<p>more than tech companies, at least what we&rsquo;ve seen so far.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree, I agree.</p>
<p>But I mean, we haven&rsquo;t had a voice</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve had until recently.</p>
<p>I mean, anyone that has a Twitter account now</p>
<p>can speak and become a news article.</p>
<p>My parents didn&rsquo;t have that voice.</p>
<p>If they wanted to speak out against the government</p>
<p>or do something, they had to go to a protest</p>
<p>or organize a protest or do something along those lines.</p>
<p>So we have more of a place to put our voice out now.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s incredible, but that&rsquo;s why it hurts</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you notice it when certain voices</p>
<p>get removed.</p>
<p>The president of the United States of America</p>
<p>was removed from one such or all such platforms.</p>
<p>And that hurts.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s crazy to me, that&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insane that we took that away.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s return to Silk Road and Russell Brink.</p>
<p>So how did your path with this very difficult,</p>
<p>very fascinating case cross?</p>
<p>We were looking to open a case against TOR</p>
<p>because it was a problem.</p>
<p>All the cases were closing because TOR.</p>
<p>So we went on TOR and we came up with 26 web,</p>
<p>different dotting onions that we targeted.</p>
<p>We were looking for nexuses to hacking</p>
<p>because I was on a squad called CY2</p>
<p>and we were like the premier squad in New York</p>
<p>that was working criminal cyber intrusions.</p>
<p>And so any website that was offering hackers for hire</p>
<p>or hacking tools for free, paid services,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re seeing ransomware as a paid service</p>
<p>and phishing as a paid service,</p>
<p>anything that offered that.</p>
<p>So we opened this case on, I think we called it,</p>
<p>so you have to name cases.</p>
<p>One of the fun thing in the FBI</p>
<p>is when you start a case, you get to name it.</p>
<p>You would not believe how much time is spent</p>
<p>in coming up with the name.</p>
<p>Case goes by, I think we called this Onion Peeler</p>
<p>because of the, yeah.</p>
<p>So a little bit of humor, a little bit of wit</p>
<p>and some profundity to the language, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re gonna have to work with us</p>
<p>for quite a lot, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, this one had the potential of being a big one</p>
<p>because I think Silk Road was like the sixth on the list</p>
<p>for that case, but we all knew</p>
<p>that was sort of the golden ring.</p>
<p>If you could make the splash</p>
<p>that that Onion site was going down,</p>
<p>then it would probably get some publicity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of law enforcement</p>
<p>is getting some publicity out of it</p>
<p>that makes others think not to do it.</p>
<p>I wish to say that Tor is the name of the project,</p>
<p>the browser.</p>
<p>What is the Onion technology behind Tor?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you wanna go to a .onion site.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll put in the .onion you wanna go to</p>
<p>and your computer will build communications</p>
<p>with a Tor relay,</p>
<p>which are all publicly available out there.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll encrypt it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll put a package around your data.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s encrypted and so can&rsquo;t read it.</p>
<p>It goes to that first relay.</p>
<p>That first relay knows about you</p>
<p>and then knows about the next relay down the chain.</p>
<p>And so it takes your data</p>
<p>and then encrypts that on the outside</p>
<p>and sends it to relay number two.</p>
<p>Now, relay number two only knows about relay number one.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t know who you are asking for this.</p>
<p>And it goes through there, adding those layers on top,</p>
<p>layers of encryption till it gets to where it is.</p>
<p>And then even the Onion service doesn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>except for the relay it came from, who it&rsquo;s talking to.</p>
<p>And so it peels back that, gives the information,</p>
<p>puts another layer back on.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s layers,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re peeling an onion back of the different relays.</p>
<p>And that encryption protects who the sender is</p>
<p>and what information they&rsquo;re sending.</p>
<p>The more layers there are,</p>
<p>the more exponentially difficult it is to decrypt it.</p>
<p>I mean, you get to a place</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have to have so many layers</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mathematically impossible to decrypt it.</p>
<p>But the more relays you have, the slower it is.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the big drawbacks on Tor</p>
<p>is how slow it operates.</p>
<p>So how do you peel the onion?</p>
<p>So what are the different methodologies</p>
<p>for trying to get some information</p>
<p>from a cybersecurity perspective</p>
<p>on these operations like the Silk Road?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>People have come up with different techniques.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been techniques to put out in the news media</p>
<p>about how they do it,</p>
<p>running like massive amounts of relays.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re controlling those relays.</p>
<p>I think I blinked somebody tried that once.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a technical solution.</p>
<p>And what about social engineering?</p>
<p>What about trying to infiltrate</p>
<p>the actual humans that are using the Silk Road</p>
<p>and trying to get in that way?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I definitely could see the way of doing that.</p>
<p>And in this case, in our takedown, we used that.</p>
<p>There was one of my partners, Jared Derrigan,</p>
<p>he was an HSI investigator,</p>
<p>and he had worked his way up</p>
<p>to be a system admin on the site.</p>
<p>So that did gleam quite a bit of information</p>
<p>because he was inside and talking to,</p>
<p>at that time, we only know it as DPR or Dread Pirate Roberts.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know who that was yet,</p>
<p>but we had that open communication.</p>
<p>And one of the things,</p>
<p>the technical aspects on that is there was a Jabber server.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a type of communication server that was being used.</p>
<p>And we knew that Ross had his Jabber set to Pacific time.</p>
<p>So we had a pretty good idea what part of the,</p>
<p>what part of the country he was in.</p>
<p>I mean, isn&rsquo;t that, from DPR&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>from Ross&rsquo;s perspective, isn&rsquo;t that clumsy?</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t a big computer guy.</p>
<p>Do you notice that aspect of the technical savvy</p>
<p>of some of these guys doesn&rsquo;t seem to be quite,</p>
<p>why weren&rsquo;t they good at this?</p>
<p>Well, the real techie savvy ones, we don&rsquo;t arrest.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get to them, we don&rsquo;t find them.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get to them.</p>
<p>Shout out to the techie criminals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably watching this.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, I mean, we&rsquo;re getting the low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re getting the ones that can be caught.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll talk about it,</p>
<p>but the anonymous case, there was a guy named AV Unit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still, I lose sleep over him</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t catch him.</p>
<p>We caught everybody else, we didn&rsquo;t catch him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s good though.</p>
<p>He pops up too once in a while on the internet</p>
<p>and it pisses me off.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s his name again?</p>
<p>AV Unit, that&rsquo;s all I know is his AV Unit.</p>
<p>AV Unit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got a funny story about him</p>
<p>and what people think he is.</p>
<p>Can we go on that brief tangent?</p>
<p>Sure, I love tangents.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you, since he&rsquo;s probably he or she,</p>
<p>do we know it&rsquo;s a he?</p>
<p>We have no idea.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s another funny story about hackers,</p>
<p>the he-she issue.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the funny story there?</p>
<p>Well, one of the guys in LulzSec was a she,</p>
<p>was a 17-year-old girl.</p>
<p>And my source in the case, the guy, Sabu,</p>
<p>that I arrested and part of it,</p>
<p>we sat side by side for nine months</p>
<p>and then took down the case and all that.</p>
<p>He was convinced she was a girl and he said,</p>
<p>and he was in love with her almost at one point.</p>
<p>It turns out to be a 35-year-old guy living in England.</p>
<p>Oh, so he was convinced it was a&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, he was absolutely convinced.</p>
<p>Based on what exactly?</p>
<p>By linguistic, like human-based linguistic analysis or what?</p>
<p>She, he, whatever, Kayla,</p>
<p>so it ended up being like a modification</p>
<p>of his sister&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>The real guy&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>was so good at building the backstory.</p>
<p>All these guys, and it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>these guys are part of a hacking crew.</p>
<p>They social engineer the shit out of each other</p>
<p>just to build if one of them ever gets caught,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll convince everybody else</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re a Brazilian ISP owner or something like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m so powerful.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that social engineering aspect</p>
<p>is part of living a life of cybercrime or cybersecurity</p>
<p>on the offensive or defensive.</p>
<p>So AV unit, can I ask you also</p>
<p>just a tangent of a tangent first?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite tangent.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is it possible for me to have a podcast conversation</p>
<p>with somebody who hasn&rsquo;t been caught yet</p>
<p>and because they have the conversation,</p>
<p>they still won&rsquo;t be caught?</p>
<p>And is that a good idea?</p>
<p>Meaning, is there a safe way for a criminal</p>
<p>to talk to me on a podcast?</p>
<p>I would think so.</p>
<p>I would think that someone could,</p>
<p>I mean, someone who has been living a double life</p>
<p>for long enough where you think they&rsquo;re not a criminal.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, they would have to admit</p>
<p>that they would say I am AV unit.</p>
<p>Oh, you would wanna have a conversation with AV unit?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just speaking from an FBI perspective,</p>
<p>technically speaking.</p>
<p>So let me explain my motivation.</p>
<p>I think I would like to be able to talk</p>
<p>to people from all walks of life</p>
<p>and understanding criminals,</p>
<p>understanding their mind, I think is very important.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s fundamentally something different</p>
<p>between a criminal who&rsquo;s still active</p>
<p>versus one that&rsquo;s been caught.</p>
<p>The mind, just from observing it,</p>
<p>changes completely once you&rsquo;re caught.</p>
<p>You have a big shift in your understanding of the world.</p>
<p>I mean, I do have a question about the ethics</p>
<p>of having such conversations,</p>
<p>but first, technically, is it possible?</p>
<p>If I was technically advising you,</p>
<p>I would say, first off, don&rsquo;t advertise it.</p>
<p>The fewer people that you&rsquo;re gonna tell</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re having this conversation with, the better.</p>
<p>And yeah, you could, are you doing it in person?</p>
<p>Are you doing it in-</p>
<p>In person would be amazing, yeah,</p>
<p>but their face would not be shown.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you couldn&rsquo;t publish a show for a while.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d have to put a lot of trust in you</p>
<p>that you are not going to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to alter those tapes.</p>
<p>I say tapes, because it&rsquo;s old school, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tape.</p>
<p>Exactly, I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people just said that,</p>
<p>like, oh shit, this old guy just said tape.</p>
<p>I heard of VHS, it was in the 1800s, I think.</p>
<p>But yeah, yeah, you could do it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d have to have complete faith and trust in you</p>
<p>that you destroy the originals</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve altered it.</p>
<p>What about if they don&rsquo;t have faith?</p>
<p>Is there a way for them to attain security?</p>
<p>So, like, for me to go through some kind of process</p>
<p>where I meet them somewhere where-</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not gonna do it</p>
<p>without a bag over your head.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the life you wanna live.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with a bag over my head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna get taken out of context.</p>
<p>But I just, I think it&rsquo;s a worthy effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worthy to go through the hardship of that</p>
<p>to understand the mind of somebody.</p>
<p>I think fundamentally, conversations are a different thing</p>
<p>than the operation of law enforcement.</p>
<p>Understanding the mind of a criminal,</p>
<p>I think, is really important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re gonna have the honest conversation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>I mean, it may sound honest, but it may not be the truth.</p>
<p>I found most times when I was talking to criminals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s lies mixed with half-truths.</p>
<p>And you kinda, if they&rsquo;re good,</p>
<p>they can keep that story going for long enough.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not, you kind of see the relief in them</p>
<p>when you finally break that wall down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the job of an interviewer.</p>
<p>If the interviewer is good, then perhaps not directly,</p>
<p>but through the gaps,</p>
<p>seeps out the truth of the human being.</p>
<p>So not necessarily the details</p>
<p>of how they do the operations and so on,</p>
<p>but just who they are as a human being,</p>
<p>what their motivations are, what their ethics are,</p>
<p>how they see the world, what is good, what is evil,</p>
<p>do they see themselves as good,</p>
<p>what do they see their motivation as,</p>
<p>do they have resentment,</p>
<p>what do they think about love for the people</p>
<p>within their small community,</p>
<p>do they have resentment for the government</p>
<p>or for other nations or for other people,</p>
<p>do they have childhood issues</p>
<p>that led to a different view of the world</p>
<p>than others perhaps have,</p>
<p>do they have certain fetishes like sexual and otherwise</p>
<p>that led to the construction of the world?</p>
<p>They might be able to reveal some deep flaws</p>
<p>to the cybersecurity infrastructure of our world,</p>
<p>not in detail, but like philosophically speaking.</p>
<p>They might have,</p>
<p>I know you might say it&rsquo;s just a narrative,</p>
<p>but they might have a kind of ethical concern</p>
<p>for the well-being of the world</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re essentially attacking the weakness</p>
<p>of the cybersecurity infrastructure</p>
<p>because they believe ultimately</p>
<p>that would lead to a safer world.</p>
<p>So the attacks will reveal the weaknesses.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re stealing a bunch of money,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay because that&rsquo;s gonna enforce you</p>
<p>to invest a lot more money in defending,</p>
<p>yeah, defending things that actually matter,</p>
<p>you know, nuclear warheads and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, I could see, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to explore the mind</p>
<p>of a human being like that</p>
<p>because I think it will help people understand.</p>
<p>Now, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still a person that&rsquo;s creating a lot of suffering</p>
<p>in the world, which is a problem.</p>
<p>So do you think ethically it&rsquo;s a good thing to do?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like I have a fairly high ethical bar</p>
<p>that I have to put myself on</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think I have a problem with it.</p>
<p>I would love to listen to it.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>I mean, not that I&rsquo;m your ethical coach here.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, so,</p>
<p>because I thought you would have become jaded</p>
<p>and exhausted by the criminal mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m, you know, fast forward in our story,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very good friends with Hector Monserrat,</p>
<p>the Sabu, the guy I arrested,</p>
<p>and he tells stories of what he did in his past.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, I&rsquo;m that Hector, you know?</p>
<p>But then I listened to your episode with Brett Johnson</p>
<p>and I was like, ah, this guy&rsquo;s stealing money</p>
<p>from the US government and welfare fraud</p>
<p>and all this sort of thing.</p>
<p>It just pissed me off.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why I have that differentiation in my head.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I think one&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>oh, Hector will be Hector,</p>
<p>and then this guy just pissed me off.</p>
<p>Well, you didn&rsquo;t feel that way about Hector</p>
<p>until you probably met him.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t know Hector, I knew Sabu.</p>
<p>So I hunted down Sabu</p>
<p>and I learned about Hector over those nine months.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll talk about it later.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s finish with, let&rsquo;s return tangent to back to tangent.</p>
<p>Oh, one tangent up, who&rsquo;s AV unit?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Interesting, so he&rsquo;s at the core of Anonymous.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the critical people in Anonymous.</p>
<p>What is known about him?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s known in public and what was known</p>
<p>because I sat with Hector</p>
<p>and he was sort of like the set things up guy.</p>
<p>So if LulzSec had like their hackers,</p>
<p>which was Sabu and Kayla,</p>
<p>and they had their media guy, this guy Topiary,</p>
<p>he lived up in the Northern end of England.</p>
<p>And they had a few other guys,</p>
<p>but AV unit was the guy that set up infrastructure.</p>
<p>So if you need a VPN in Brazil</p>
<p>or something like that to pop through,</p>
<p>one of the first things Hector told me</p>
<p>after we arrested him is that AV unit</p>
<p>was a secret service agent.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh shit.</p>
<p>Just because he kind of lived that lifestyle,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be around for a bunch of days</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden gone for three weeks.</p>
<p>And I tried to get more out of Hector</p>
<p>early on in that relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he was a little bit guarded,</p>
<p>maybe trying to social engineer me.</p>
<p>Maybe he wanted that, oh shit,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s law enforcement involved in this.</p>
<p>And not to say, I mean, I was in over my head</p>
<p>with that case, just the amount of work that was going on.</p>
<p>So to track them all down,</p>
<p>plus the 350 hacks that came in</p>
<p>about just military institutions,</p>
<p>it was swimming in the deep end.</p>
<p>So it was just at the end of the case,</p>
<p>I looked back and I was like, AV unit,</p>
<p>I could have had them all.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the perfectionist in me.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Well, reach out somehow.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say how, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to figure out.</p>
<p>Would you have them on?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Just let me know.</p>
<p>And just talk shit about you the whole time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>He probably doesn&rsquo;t even care about me.</p>
<p>Well, now he will.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a certain pleasure</p>
<p>of a guy who&rsquo;s extremely good at his job</p>
<p>not catching another guy who&rsquo;s extremely good at his job.</p>
<p>Obviously better.</p>
<p>He got away.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still eating at you.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>He or she.</p>
<p>If I can meet that guy one day, he or she,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>I mean, I have no power.</p>
<p>So yes, Silk Road, can you speak to the scale of this thing?</p>
<p>Just for people who are not familiar,</p>
<p>how big was it and any other interesting things</p>
<p>you understand about its operation when it was active?</p>
<p>So it was when we finally got looking through the books</p>
<p>and the numbers came out as about $1.2 billion in sales.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hard with the fluctuation value of Bitcoin</p>
<p>at the time to come up with a real number.</p>
<p>So you kind of pick a daily average and go across.</p>
<p>Most of the operation was done in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It was all done in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You had escrow accounts on, you know,</p>
<p>you came in and you put money in an escrow account</p>
<p>and the transaction wasn&rsquo;t done until the client got</p>
<p>the drugs or whatever they had bought.</p>
<p>And then the drug dealers had sent it in.</p>
<p>There was some talk at the time that the cartel</p>
<p>was starting to sell on there.</p>
<p>So that started getting a little hairy there at the end.</p>
<p>What was the understanding of the relationship</p>
<p>between organized crime,</p>
<p>like the cartels and this kind of more ad hoc,</p>
<p>new age market that is the Silk Road?</p>
<p>I mean, it was all just chatter.</p>
<p>It was just, you know,</p>
<p>cause like I said, Jared was in the inside.</p>
<p>So we saw some of it from the admin sides</p>
<p>and Ross had a lot of private conversations</p>
<p>with the different people that he advised him,</p>
<p>but no one knew each other.</p>
<p>And I mean, the only thing that they knew</p>
<p>was the admins had to send an ID to Ross,</p>
<p>had to send a picture of their driver&rsquo;s license or passport,</p>
<p>which I always found very strange</p>
<p>because if you are an admin on a site that sells fake IDs,</p>
<p>why would you send your real ID?</p>
<p>And then why would the guy running the site</p>
<p>who profits from selling fake IDs believe that it was?</p>
<p>But fast forward, they were all real IDs.</p>
<p>All the IDs that we found on Ross&rsquo;s computer as the admins</p>
<p>were the real people&rsquo;s IDs.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>Just other clumsiness?</p>
<p>Yeah, low-hanging fruit, I guess.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>I mean, I would have bought,</p>
<p>I mean, even Ross bought fake IDs off the site.</p>
<p>He had federal agents knock on his door,</p>
<p>you know, and then he got a little cocky about it.</p>
<p>The landscape, the dynamics of trust is fascinating here.</p>
<p>So you trust certain ideas are,</p>
<p>like who do you trust in that kind of market?</p>
<p>What was your understanding of the network of trust?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone trusts anybody, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, I think Ross had his advisors of trust,</p>
<p>but outside of that, I mean,</p>
<p>he required people to send their ID for their trust.</p>
<p>He, you know, people stole from him.</p>
<p>There was, there&rsquo;s open cases of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a criminal world.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t trust anybody.</p>
<p>What was his life like, you think?</p>
<p>Lonely.</p>
<p>Can you imagine being trapped in something like that</p>
<p>where you, the whole world focused on that</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t tell people what you do all day?</p>
<p>Could he have walked away?</p>
<p>Like someone else take over or the site just shut down?</p>
<p>Either one.</p>
<p>Just you putting yourself in his shoes,</p>
<p>the loneliness, the anxiety,</p>
<p>the just the growing immensity of it.</p>
<p>So walk away with some kind of financial stability.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have made it past two days.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like loneliness.</p>
<p>I mean, if my wife&rsquo;s away,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably call her 10, 12 times a day.</p>
<p>We just talk about things, you know,</p>
<p>something crossed my mind.</p>
<p>I want to talk about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure she.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d like to talk to her,</p>
<p>like honestly about everything.</p>
<p>So if you were running Silk Road,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to like.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;d have a little protection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d only mentioned to her when we were in bed</p>
<p>to have that marital connection.</p>
<p>But who knows?</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s gonna question why the Ferrari is outside</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sure you can come up with something.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t he walk away?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another question of why don&rsquo;t criminals walk away</p>
<p>in these situations?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know every criminal mind</p>
<p>and some do.</p>
<p>I mean, A.V. Unit walked away.</p>
<p>I mean, not to go back to that son of a bitch, but.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a theme to this.</p>
<p>But you know, Ross started counting his dollars.</p>
<p>I mean, he really kept track of how much money</p>
<p>he was making and it started, you know,</p>
<p>getting exponentially growth.</p>
<p>I mean, if he would have stayed at it,</p>
<p>he would have probably been one of the richest people</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>And do you think he liked the actual money</p>
<p>or the fact of the number growing?</p>
<p>I mean, have you ever held a Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, you have?</p>
<p>Well, he never did.</p>
<p>What do you mean held a Bitcoin?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t hold it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I can give you a briefcase of Bitcoin</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>He liked the idea of it growing.</p>
<p>He liked the idea.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it started off as sharing this idea,</p>
<p>but then he really did turn to,</p>
<p>like, I am the captain of this ship and that&rsquo;s what goes.</p>
<p>And he was making a lot of money.</p>
<p>And again, my interactions with Ross</p>
<p>was about maybe five or six hours over a two-day period.</p>
<p>I knew DPR because I read his words and all that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know Ross.</p>
<p>There was a journal found on his computer</p>
<p>and so it sort of kind of gave me a little insight.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like to do a playbook for criminals,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tell you right now, don&rsquo;t write things down.</p>
<p>There was a big fad about people,</p>
<p>like, remember kids going around</p>
<p>shooting people with paint balls and filming it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you would do that.</p>
<p>Why would you videotape yourself committing crime</p>
<p>and then publish it?</p>
<p>Like, if there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve taught my children,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t record yourself doing bad things.</p>
<p>It never goes well.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>And you actually give advice in the other end</p>
<p>of logs being very useful for the defense perspective</p>
<p>for information is useful for being able to figure out</p>
<p>what the attacks were all about.</p>
<p>Logs are the only reason I found Hector Monsegur.</p>
<p>The one time his VPN dropped during a Fox hack,</p>
<p>and he says he wasn&rsquo;t even hacking,</p>
<p>he just was sent a link and he clicked on it.</p>
<p>And in 10 million lines of logs,</p>
<p>there was one IP address that stuck out.</p>
<p>This is fascinating.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll explore several angles of that.</p>
<p>So what was the process of bringing down Ross</p>
<p>and the Silk Road?</p>
<p>All right, so that&rsquo;s a long story.</p>
<p>You want the whole thing or you want to break it up?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Once we had the information of the chat logs</p>
<p>and all that from the server, we found-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the server?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the chat log?</p>
<p>So the dot onion was running, the website,</p>
<p>the Silk Road was running on a server in Iceland.</p>
<p>How did you figure that out?</p>
<p>That was one of the claims that the NSA-</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the one that we said that,</p>
<p>yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you if it was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the internet.</p>
<p>I mean, the internet has their conspiracy theories</p>
<p>and all that, so-</p>
<p>But you figured out, that&rsquo;s the part of the thing you do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s puzzle pieces and you have to put them together</p>
<p>and look for different pieces of information</p>
<p>and figure out, okay.</p>
<p>So you figure out the server is in Iceland.</p>
<p>We get a copy of it,</p>
<p>and so we start getting clues off of that.</p>
<p>Was it a physical copy of the server?</p>
<p>Yeah, you fly over there.</p>
<p>So you go.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been to Iceland, if you&rsquo;ve never been,</p>
<p>you should definitely go to Iceland.</p>
<p>Is it beautiful or-</p>
<p>I love it, I love it.</p>
<p>It was what, so I&rsquo;ll tell you this.</p>
<p>So, sorry, tangents, you know?</p>
<p>I love this, yeah.</p>
<p>So I went to Iceland for the anonymous case.</p>
<p>Then I went to Iceland for the Silk Road case,</p>
<p>and I was like, oh shit,</p>
<p>all cyber crime goes through Iceland.</p>
<p>It was just my sort of thing.</p>
<p>And I was over there for like the third time,</p>
<p>and I said, if I ever can bring my family here.</p>
<p>Like, so there&rsquo;s a place called Thingavar,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m fucking up the name.</p>
<p>The Icelandics are pissed right now.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s where the North American continental plate</p>
<p>and the European continental plate are pulling apart,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s being filled in with volcanic material</p>
<p>in the middle, and it&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>Like, I was like, one day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be able to afford to bring my family here.</p>
<p>And once I left-</p>
<p>Just like the humbling and the beauty of nature.</p>
<p>Just everything, man.</p>
<p>It was a different world.</p>
<p>It was insane how great Iceland is.</p>
<p>And so we went back, and we rented a van,</p>
<p>and we took friends,</p>
<p>and we drove around the entire country.</p>
<p>Absolutely, like a beautiful place.</p>
<p>Like, Reykjavik&rsquo;s nice,</p>
<p>but get out of Reykjavik as quick as you can</p>
<p>and see the countryside.</p>
<p>How is this place even real?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s so new.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, so, you know,</p>
<p>our rivers have been going through here</p>
<p>for millions of years and flattened everything out</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>These are new, this is new land</p>
<p>being carved by these rivers.</p>
<p>You can walk behind a waterfall in one place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most beautiful place I&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>You understand why this is a place</p>
<p>where a lot of hacking is being done?</p>
<p>Because the energy is free, and it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of servers going on there.</p>
<p>Server farms, you know,</p>
<p>the energy has come up out of the ground, geothermal.</p>
<p>And so, and then it keeps all the servers nice and cool.</p>
<p>So why not keep your computers there at a cheap rate?</p>
<p>Tangents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll definitely visit for several reasons,</p>
<p>including to talk to AV Unit.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;ll want you there.</p>
<p>Well, the servers are there,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t probably live there.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, the Pacific, the PST, the time zones,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many fascinating things to explore here.</p>
<p>But so you got-</p>
<p>Sorry, to add to that,</p>
<p>I mean, the European internet cable goes through there.</p>
<p>So, you know, across to Greenland</p>
<p>and down through Canada and all that.</p>
<p>So they have backbone access with cheap energy</p>
<p>and free cold weather, you know.</p>
<p>And beautiful.</p>
<p>Oh, and beautiful, yes.</p>
<p>So chat logs on that server,</p>
<p>what was in the chat logs?</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>He kept them all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another issue.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running a criminal enterprise,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t keep all,</p>
<p>again, I&rsquo;m not making a guidebook</p>
<p>of how to commit the perfect crime.</p>
<p>But, you know, every chat he ever had,</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s chat,</p>
<p>it was like going into Facebook of criminal activity.</p>
<p>Yeah, just looking at texts with Elon Musk</p>
<p>being part of the conversations.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been made public</p>
<p>for the court cases going through,</p>
<p>was going through, is going through,</p>
<p>was going through with Twitter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it is.</p>
<p>But it made me realize that, oh, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generally, that&rsquo;s my philosophy in life,</p>
<p>is like anything I text or email or say,</p>
<p>publicly or privately, I should be proud of.</p>
<p>So I try to kind of do that</p>
<p>because you basically, you say don&rsquo;t keep chat logs,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very difficult to erase chat logs from this world.</p>
<p>I guess if you&rsquo;re a criminal, that should be,</p>
<p>like you have to be exceptionally competent</p>
<p>at that kind of thing.</p>
<p>To erase your footprints is very, very difficult.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make one mistake.</p>
<p>All it takes is one mistake of keeping it.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, not only do you have to be,</p>
<p>whatever you put in a chat log or whatever you put in an email</p>
<p>it has to hold up and you have to stand behind it publicly</p>
<p>when it comes out.</p>
<p>But if it comes out 10 years from now,</p>
<p>you have to stand behind it.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re seeing that now in today&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s a responsibility</p>
<p>you have to take really, really seriously.</p>
<p>If I was a parent and advising teens,</p>
<p>like you kind of have to teach them that.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a sense like,</p>
<p>no, we&rsquo;ll become more accustomed to that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But in reality, no.</p>
<p>I think in the future we&rsquo;ll still be held responsible</p>
<p>for the weird shit we do.</p>
<p>Yeah, a friend of mine,</p>
<p>his daughter got kicked out of college</p>
<p>because of something she posted in high school.</p>
<p>And the shittiest thing for him, but great for my kids.</p>
<p>Great lesson.</p>
<p>Look over there and you don&rsquo;t want that to happen to you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so in the chat logs was useful information,</p>
<p>like breadcrumbs of what,</p>
<p>of information that you can then pull out.</p>
<p>Yeah, great evidence and stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously-</p>
<p>A lot of evidence too.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of evidence.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sale of this much heroin</p>
<p>because Ross ended up getting charged</p>
<p>with czar status on certain things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a certain weight in each type of drug</p>
<p>and that you had,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s four or five employees of your empire</p>
<p>and that you made more than $10 million.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just like what the narco traffickers</p>
<p>get charged with or anybody out of Columbia.</p>
<p>And that was primarily what he was charged with</p>
<p>during when he was arrested is the drug.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he got charged</p>
<p>with some of the hacking tools too.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s in prison, what, for-</p>
<p>Two life sentences plus 40 years.</p>
<p>And no possibility of parole?</p>
<p>In the federal system,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no possibility of parole when you have life.</p>
<p>The only way you get out is if the president pardons you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a chance.</p>
<p>There is.</p>
<p>It was close.</p>
<p>I heard rumors that it was close.</p>
<p>Well, right.</p>
<p>So it depends.</p>
<p>Given, it&rsquo;s fascinating,</p>
<p>but given the political, the ideological ideas</p>
<p>that he represented and espoused,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not out of the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;ve been asked before who,</p>
<p>does he get out of prison first</p>
<p>or does Snowden come back into America?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>Snowden just became a Russian citizen.</p>
<p>I saw that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of weird theories about that one.</p>
<p>Well, actually, on another tangent, let me ask you,</p>
<p>do you think Snowden is a good or a bad person?</p>
<p>A bad person.</p>
<p>Can you make the case that he&rsquo;s a bad person?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ways of being a whistleblower</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s rules set up on how to do that.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t follow those rules.</p>
<p>I mean, they, you know, I&rsquo;m red, white, and blue,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m pretty, you know, I-</p>
<p>So you think his actions were anti-American?</p>
<p>I think the results of his actions were anti-American.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if his actions were anti-American.</p>
<p>Do you think he could have anticipated</p>
<p>the negative consequences of his action?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Should we judge him by the consequences</p>
<p>or the ideals of the intent of his actions?</p>
<p>I think we all get to judge him based on our own beliefs,</p>
<p>but I believe what he did was wrong.</p>
<p>Can you steel man the case that he&rsquo;s actually a good person</p>
<p>and good for this country, for the United States of America,</p>
<p>as a flag bearer for the whistleblowers,</p>
<p>the check on the power of government?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m not big government-type guy, you know,</p>
<p>so, you know, even that sounds weird</p>
<p>coming from a government guy for so many years,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s rules in place for a reason.</p>
<p>I mean, he put, you know, some of our best capabilities,</p>
<p>he made them publicly available.</p>
<p>They really kind of set us back in the,</p>
<p>and this isn&rsquo;t my world at all,</p>
<p>but the offensive side of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Right, so he revealed stuff that he didn&rsquo;t need to reveal</p>
<p>in order to make the point.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So if you could imagine a world where he leaked stuff</p>
<p>that revealed the mass surveillance efforts</p>
<p>and not reveal other stuff.</p>
<p>Like, is the mass surveillance, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing that, of course,</p>
<p>in the interpretation of that, there&rsquo;s fear-mongering,</p>
<p>but at the core, that was a real shock to people</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s possible for government to collect data at scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising to me that people are that shocked by it.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s conspiracies,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s, like, actual evidence</p>
<p>that that is happening.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of reality that people ignore,</p>
<p>but when it hits you in the face,</p>
<p>you realize, holy shit, we&rsquo;re living in a new world.</p>
<p>This is the new reality,</p>
<p>and we have to deal with that reality.</p>
<p>Just like you work in cybersecurity,</p>
<p>I think it really hasn&rsquo;t hit most people</p>
<p>how fucked we all are in terms of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Okay, let me rephrase that.</p>
<p>How many dangers there are in a digital world,</p>
<p>how much under attack we all are,</p>
<p>and how more intense the attacks are getting,</p>
<p>and how difficult the defense is,</p>
<p>and how important it is,</p>
<p>and how much we should value it,</p>
<p>and all the different things we should do</p>
<p>at the small and large scale to defend.</p>
<p>Like, most people really haven&rsquo;t woken up.</p>
<p>They think about privacy from tech companies.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think about attacks, cyber attacks.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re a target,</p>
<p>and that message definitely has to get out there.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have a voice, you&rsquo;re a target.</p>
<p>If the place you work, you might be a target.</p>
<p>See, your husband might work at some place,</p>
<p>because now people are working from home,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re gonna target you to get access</p>
<p>to his network in order to get in.</p>
<p>Well, in that same way, the idea that the US government</p>
<p>or any government could be doing mass surveillance</p>
<p>on its citizens is one that was a wake-up call,</p>
<p>because you could imagine the ways</p>
<p>in which that could be,</p>
<p>like, you could abuse the power of that</p>
<p>to control a citizenry for political reasons and purposes.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you know, you could abuse it.</p>
<p>I think during the part of the Snowden League,</p>
<p>saw that two NSA guys were monitoring their girlfriends,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s rules in place for that.</p>
<p>Those people should be punished for abusing that.</p>
<p>But how else are we going to hear about terrorists</p>
<p>that are in the country talking about birthday cakes?</p>
<p>And that was a case where that was the trip word,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna go bomb New York City&rsquo;s subway.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s complicated, but it just feels like</p>
<p>there should be some balance of transparency.</p>
<p>There should be a check in that power,</p>
<p>because, like, you know, in the name of the war on terror,</p>
<p>you can sort of sacrifice.</p>
<p>There is a trade-off between security and freedom,</p>
<p>but it just feels like there&rsquo;s a giant, slippery slope</p>
<p>on the sacrificing of freedom in the name of security.</p>
<p>I hear you, and, you know, we live in a world where,</p>
<p>well, I live in a world where I had to tell you exactly</p>
<p>when I arrested someone, I had to write a 50-page document</p>
<p>of how I arrested you and all the probable cause</p>
<p>I have against you and all that.</p>
<p>Well, you know, bad guys are reading that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re reading how I caught you,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re changing the way they&rsquo;re doing things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re changing their MO.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re doing it to be more secure.</p>
<p>If, you know, we tell people how we&rsquo;re monitoring,</p>
<p>you know, what we&rsquo;re surveilling, we&rsquo;re gonna lose that.</p>
<p>I mean, the terrorists are just gonna go a different way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not trying to, again, I&rsquo;m not big government.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to say that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cool that we&rsquo;re monitoring,</p>
<p>the U.S. government&rsquo;s monitoring everything.</p>
<p>You know, big tech&rsquo;s monitoring everything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just monetizing it</p>
<p>versus possibly using it against you.</p>
<p>But there is a balance, and those 50 pages,</p>
<p>they have a lot of value.</p>
<p>They make your job harder,</p>
<p>but they prevent you from abusing the power of the job.</p>
<p>Yeah. There&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s a tricky balance.</p>
<p>So the chat logs in Iceland,</p>
<p>gave you evidence of the heroin</p>
<p>and all the large-scale czar-level drug trading.</p>
<p>What else did it give you in terms of the how to catch?</p>
<p>It gave us infrastructure.</p>
<p>So the Onion name was actually running on a server in France.</p>
<p>So if you like, and it only commuted</p>
<p>through a back channel of VPN</p>
<p>to connect to the Iceland server.</p>
<p>There was a Bitcoin, like kind of vault server</p>
<p>that was also in Iceland.</p>
<p>And I think that was so that the admins</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get into the Bitcoins,</p>
<p>the other admins that were hired to work on the site.</p>
<p>So you could get into the site,</p>
<p>but you couldn&rsquo;t touch the money.</p>
<p>Only Ross had access to that.</p>
<p>And then, you know, another big mistake on Ross&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>is he had the backups for everything</p>
<p>at a data center in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put your infrastructure in the United States.</p>
<p>I mean, again, let&rsquo;s not make a playbook, but you know.</p>
<p>Well, I think these are low-hanging fruit</p>
<p>that people of competence would know already.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting that he wasn&rsquo;t competent enough</p>
<p>to make, so he was incompetent in certain ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think he was a mastermind</p>
<p>of setting up an infrastructure</p>
<p>that would protect his online business</p>
<p>because, you know, keeping chat logs, keeping a diary,</p>
<p>putting infrastructure where it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>Bad decisions.</p>
<p>How did you figure out that he&rsquo;s in San Francisco?</p>
<p>So we had that part with Jared</p>
<p>that he was on the West Coast.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>Who again is Jared?</p>
<p>Jared Day-Egan was a, he was a partner in,</p>
<p>he was a DHS agent,</p>
<p>worked for HSI, Homeland Security Investigations in Chicago.</p>
<p>He started his Silk Road investigation</p>
<p>because he was working at O&rsquo;Hare</p>
<p>and a weird package came in.</p>
<p>Come to find out, he traced it back to Silk Road.</p>
<p>So he started working at a Silk Road investigation</p>
<p>long before I started my case.</p>
<p>And he made his way up undercover</p>
<p>all the way to be an admin on Silk Road.</p>
<p>So he was talking to Ross on a Jabra server,</p>
<p>the private Jabra server, private chat communication server.</p>
<p>And we noticed that Ross&rsquo;s time zone on that Jabra server</p>
<p>was set to the West Coast.</p>
<p>So we had Pacific time on there.</p>
<p>So we had a region, 1 24th of the world was covered</p>
<p>of where we thought he might be.</p>
<p>And from there, how do you get to San Francisco?</p>
<p>There was another guy, an IRS agent</p>
<p>that was part of the team.</p>
<p>And he used a powerful tool to find his clue.</p>
<p>He used the world of Google.</p>
<p>He simply just went back and Googled around</p>
<p>for Silk Road at the time it was coming up</p>
<p>and found some posts on like some help forums</p>
<p>that this guy was starting an Onion website</p>
<p>and wanted some cryptocurrency help.</p>
<p>And if you could help him,</p>
<p>please reach out to ross.albrek at gmail.com.</p>
<p>In my world, that&rsquo;s a clue, so.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the name he used on that post was Frosty.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you had to connect Frosty</p>
<p>and other uses in Frosty and here&rsquo;s a Gmail</p>
<p>and the Gmail has the name.</p>
<p>The Gmail posted that I need help</p>
<p>under the name Frosty on this forum.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the connection of Frosty elsewhere?</p>
<p>The person logging into the Philadelphia backup server,</p>
<p>the name of the computer was Frosty.</p>
<p>Another clue in my world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>The name is there,</p>
<p>the connection to the Philadelphia server</p>
<p>and then to Iceland is there.</p>
<p>And so the rest is small details in terms of,</p>
<p>or is there interesting details?</p>
<p>No, I mean, there&rsquo;s some electronic surveillance</p>
<p>to find Ross Albrek living in a house</p>
<p>and is there, you know, is a computer at his house</p>
<p>attaching to, you know, does it have Tor traffic</p>
<p>at the same time that DPR is on?</p>
<p>Another big clue.</p>
<p>Matching up timeframes.</p>
<p>Again, just putting your email out there,</p>
<p>putting your name out there like that.</p>
<p>Like what I see from that,</p>
<p>just at the scale of that market,</p>
<p>what it just makes me wonder how many criminals</p>
<p>are out there that are not making</p>
<p>these low-hanging fruit mistakes</p>
<p>and are still successfully operating.</p>
<p>To me, it seems like you could be a criminal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much easier to be a criminal on the internet.</p>
<p>What else to you is interesting to understand</p>
<p>about that case of Ross</p>
<p>and Silk Road and just the history of it</p>
<p>from your own relationship with it,</p>
<p>from a cybersecurity perspective,</p>
<p>from an ethical perspective, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Like when you look back,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting to you about that case?</p>
<p>I think my views on the case have changed over time.</p>
<p>I mean, it was my job back then.</p>
<p>So I just looked at it as of, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going after this.</p>
<p>I sort of made a name for myself in the Bureau</p>
<p>for the anonymous case.</p>
<p>And then this one was just, I mean, this was a bigger deal.</p>
<p>I mean, they flew me down to DC</p>
<p>to meet with the director about this case.</p>
<p>The President of the United States</p>
<p>was gonna announce this case, the arrest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the government shut down two days before.</p>
<p>So it was just us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the only reason</p>
<p>I had any publicity out of it,</p>
<p>is because the government shut down</p>
<p>and the only thing that went public</p>
<p>was that affidavit with my signature at the end.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it would have just been the Attorney General</p>
<p>and the President announcing the rest of this big thing.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t have seen me.</p>
<p>Did you understand that this was a big case?</p>
<p>Yeah, I knew at the time.</p>
<p>Was it because of the scale of it or what it stood for?</p>
<p>I just knew that the public was gonna react in a big way.</p>
<p>Like the media was&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, did I think that it was gonna be on the front page</p>
<p>of every newspaper the day after the arrest?</p>
<p>No, but I could sense it.</p>
<p>Like I went like three or four days without sleep.</p>
<p>When I was out in San Francisco to arrest Ross,</p>
<p>I had sent three guys to Iceland to&hellip;</p>
<p>So it was a three-pronged approach for the takedown.</p>
<p>It was get Ross, get the Bitcoins and seize the site.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t want someone else taking control of the site.</p>
<p>And we wanted that big splash of that banner.</p>
<p>Like, look, the government found this site.</p>
<p>You might not wanna think about doing this again.</p>
<p>And you were able to pull off all three?</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s my superpower.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really good about putting smarter people than I am</p>
<p>together and on the right things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only way to do it.</p>
<p>In the business I formed, that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>I hired only smarter people than me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that smart,</p>
<p>but smart enough to know who the smart people are.</p>
<p>The team was able to do all three?</p>
<p>Yeah, we were able to get all three done.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the one guy, one of the guys,</p>
<p>the main guys I sent to Iceland, man, he was so smart.</p>
<p>I sent another guy from the FBI to France to get that part,</p>
<p>and he couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So the guy in Iceland did it from Iceland.</p>
<p>They had to pull some stuff out of memory on a computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s live process stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve done that before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you did.</p>
<p>Look what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>This is like a multi-layer interrogation going on.</p>
<p>Was there a concern that somebody else</p>
<p>would step in and control the site?</p>
<p>Absolutely, we didn&rsquo;t have insight</p>
<p>on who exactly had control.</p>
<p>So it turns out that Ross had dictatorial control.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t easy to delegate to somebody else.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think he had some sort of ideas.</p>
<p>I mean, his diary talked about walking away</p>
<p>and giving it to somebody else,</p>
<p>but he couldn&rsquo;t give up that control on anybody, apparently.</p>
<p>Which makes you think that power corrupts,</p>
<p>and his ideals were not as strong as he espoused about.</p>
<p>Because if it was about the freedom</p>
<p>of being able to buy drugs, if you want to,</p>
<p>then he surely should have found ways to delegate that power.</p>
<p>Well, he changed over time.</p>
<p>You could see it in his writings that he changed.</p>
<p>So people argue back and forth</p>
<p>that there was never murders on Silk Road.</p>
<p>When we were doing the investigation,</p>
<p>to us, there were six murders.</p>
<p>So the way we saw him at the time</p>
<p>was Ross ordered people to be murdered.</p>
<p>People stole from him and all that.</p>
<p>It was sort of an evolution from,</p>
<p>oh man, I can&rsquo;t deal with this, I can&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too much, to the last one was the guy said,</p>
<p>well, he&rsquo;s got three roommates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, we&rsquo;ll kill them too.</p>
<p>Was that ever proven in court?</p>
<p>No, the murders never went forward</p>
<p>because there was some stuff problems in that case.</p>
<p>So there was a separate case in Baltimore</p>
<p>that they had been working on for a lot longer.</p>
<p>And so, during the investigation,</p>
<p>that caused a bunch of problems</p>
<p>because now we have multiple federal agencies</p>
<p>case against the same thing.</p>
<p>How do you decide not to push forward</p>
<p>the murder investigations?</p>
<p>So there was a deconfliction meeting that happened in DC.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t happen to go to that meeting,</p>
<p>but Jared went, this is before I ever knew Jared,</p>
<p>and we have like televisions</p>
<p>where we can just sit in a room</p>
<p>and sit in on the meeting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all secured network and all that.</p>
<p>So we can talk openly about secure things.</p>
<p>And we sat in on the meeting</p>
<p>and people just kept saying the term sweat equity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got sweat equity,</p>
<p>meaning that they had worked on the case for so long</p>
<p>that they deserve to take them down.</p>
<p>And by this time, no one knew about us,</p>
<p>but we told them at the meeting</p>
<p>that we had found the server and we have a copy of it</p>
<p>and we have the infrastructure.</p>
<p>And these guys had just had communications under covers.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t really know what was going on.</p>
<p>And this wasn&rsquo;t my first deconfliction meeting.</p>
<p>We had a huge deconfliction meeting</p>
<p>during the anonymous case.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a deconfliction meeting?</p>
<p>Within your agency or other federal agencies</p>
<p>have an open investigation</p>
<p>that if you expose your case</p>
<p>or took down your case would hurt their case</p>
<p>or the other way.</p>
<p>Oh, so you kind of have a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the rival gangs meet at the table</p>
<p>in a smoke filled room and-</p>
<p>Less bullets at the end, but yes.</p>
<p>Boy, with the sweat equity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s careers at stake, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You hate that idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, why is that a stake?</p>
<p>Just because you&rsquo;ve worked on it long enough,</p>
<p>longer than I have, that means you did better?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insane to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s rewarding bad behavior.</p>
<p>And so the part of the sweat equity discussion</p>
<p>was about murder.</p>
<p>And this was, here&rsquo;s a chance to actually bust them</p>
<p>given the data you have from Iceland</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So why?</p>
<p>Well, they wanted us just to turn the data over to them.</p>
<p>To them.</p>
<p>Yeah, thanks for getting us this far.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>I mean, it came to the point where they sent us,</p>
<p>they had a picture of what they thought Ross was,</p>
<p>and it was an internet meme.</p>
<p>It really was a meme.</p>
<p>It was a photo that we could look up.</p>
<p>Like, it was insane.</p>
<p>All right, so there&rsquo;s different degrees of competence</p>
<p>all across the world between different people.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, does part of you regret</p>
<p>because you pushed forward the heroin and the drug trade,</p>
<p>but never got to the murder discussion?</p>
<p>I mean, the only regret is that the internet</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand.</p>
<p>Like, they just kind of blow that part off,</p>
<p>that he literally paid people to have people murdered.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t result in a murder,</p>
<p>and I thank God no one resulted in a murder.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s where his mind was.</p>
<p>His mind and where he wrote in his diary</p>
<p>was that I had people killed and here&rsquo;s the money.</p>
<p>He paid it.</p>
<p>He paid a large amount of Bitcoins for that murder.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t just even think about it.</p>
<p>He actually took action, but the murders never happened.</p>
<p>He took action by paying the money.</p>
<p>Correct, and the people came back with results.</p>
<p>He thought they were murdered.</p>
<p>That said, can you understand the stigma on the case</p>
<p>for the drug trade on Silk Road?</p>
<p>Like, can you make the case</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a net positive for society?</p>
<p>So there was a time period</p>
<p>of when we found out the infrastructure</p>
<p>and when we built the case against Ross.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly.</p>
<p>Six weeks, a month, two months, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>somewhere in there.</p>
<p>But then at Ross&rsquo;s sentencing,</p>
<p>there was a father that stood up</p>
<p>and talked about his son dying.</p>
<p>And I went back and kind of did the math</p>
<p>and it was between those time periods</p>
<p>of when we knew we could shut it down.</p>
<p>We could have pulled the plug on the server and gone.</p>
<p>And when Ross was arrested,</p>
<p>his son died from buying drugs on Silk Road.</p>
<p>And I still think about that father a lot.</p>
<p>But if we look at the scale at the war on drugs,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just even outside of Silk Road,</p>
<p>do you think the war on drugs by the United States</p>
<p>has alleviated more suffering</p>
<p>or caused more suffering in the world?</p>
<p>That might be above my pay scale.</p>
<p>I mean, I understand the other side of the argument.</p>
<p>I mean, people said that I don&rsquo;t have to go down</p>
<p>to the corner to buy drugs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna get shot on the corner buying drugs</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>I can just have them sent to my house.</p>
<p>People are gonna do drugs anyways.</p>
<p>I understand that argument.</p>
<p>From my personal standpoint,</p>
<p>if I made it more difficult for my children to get drugs,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m satisfied.</p>
<p>So your personal philosophy is that</p>
<p>if we legalize all drugs, including heroin and cocaine,</p>
<p>that that would not make for a better world?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, no, personally, I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>legalizing all drugs would make for a better world.</p>
<p>Can you imagine that it would?</p>
<p>Do you understand that argument?</p>
<p>Sure, I mean, as I&rsquo;ve gotten older,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started to, I like to see both sides of an argument.</p>
<p>And when I can&rsquo;t see the other side,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I really like to dive into it.</p>
<p>And I can see the other side.</p>
<p>I can see why people would say that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t wanna be my race children in a world</p>
<p>where drugs are just free for use.</p>
<p>Well, and then the other side of it is with Silk Road,</p>
<p>did, you know, taking down Silk Road,</p>
<p>did that increase or decrease the number</p>
<p>of drug trading criminals in the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>Online, I think it increased.</p>
<p>I think, you know, that is one of the things</p>
<p>I think about a lot with Silk Road</p>
<p>was that no one really knew.</p>
<p>I mean, there was, you know, thousands of users.</p>
<p>But then after that, it was on the front page of the paper</p>
<p>and there was millions of people that knew</p>
<p>about Tor and Onion Sites.</p>
<p>It was an advertisement.</p>
<p>You know, I would have thought,</p>
<p>I thought crypto was gonna crash right after that.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t like what people now see</p>
<p>that bad people are doing bad things with crypto.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll crash.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m obviously wrong on that one.</p>
<p>And I thought, you know, Ross was sentenced</p>
<p>to two life sentences plus 40 years.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s gonna start up these.</p>
<p>Dark markets exploded after that.</p>
<p>You know, some of them started as, you know,</p>
<p>opportunistic, I&rsquo;m gonna, you know,</p>
<p>take those escrow accounts and I&rsquo;m gonna steal</p>
<p>all the money that came in.</p>
<p>You know, they were for that.</p>
<p>But, you know, but there were a lot of dark markets</p>
<p>that popped up after that.</p>
<p>Now we put the playbook out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But, and also there&rsquo;s a case for,</p>
<p>do you ever think about not taking down,</p>
<p>if you have not taken down Silk Road,</p>
<p>you could use it because it&rsquo;s a market.</p>
<p>It itself is not necessarily</p>
<p>the primary criminal organization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a market for criminals.</p>
<p>So it could be used to track down criminals</p>
<p>in the physical world.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t take it down,</p>
<p>given that it was, you know, the central,</p>
<p>how centralized it was,</p>
<p>it could be used as a place to find criminals, right?</p>
<p>As opposed to-</p>
<p>So the dealers, the drug dealers?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you have the cartel, get the cartels</p>
<p>start getting involved, you go after the dealers.</p>
<p>It would have been very difficult.</p>
<p>Because of TOR and all that.</p>
<p>Because of all the protections, anonymity.</p>
<p>De-cloaking all that would have been</p>
<p>drastically more difficult.</p>
<p>And a lot of people in upper management of the FBI</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have the appetite of running something like that.</p>
<p>That would have been the FBI running a drug market.</p>
<p>How many, how many kids,</p>
<p>how many fathers would have to come in and said,</p>
<p>my kid bought while the FBI was running a site,</p>
<p>a drug site, my kid died.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t know anybody in the FBI in management</p>
<p>that would have the appetite to let us run</p>
<p>what was happening on Silk Road.</p>
<p>You know, because remember at that time</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still believing six people are dead.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still investigating, you know,</p>
<p>where are all these bodies?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s pretty much why</p>
<p>we took down Ross when we did.</p>
<p>We had to jump on it fast.</p>
<p>What else can you say about this complicated world</p>
<p>that has grown of the dark web?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>Like, it would have been something for me,</p>
<p>I thought it was gonna collapse.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s just gotten bigger</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s going on out there.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m really surprised that it hasn&rsquo;t grown</p>
<p>into other networks,</p>
<p>or people haven&rsquo;t developed other networks.</p>
<p>But TOR&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>You mean like instead of TOR?</p>
<p>Yeah, TOR&rsquo;s still the main one out there.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a few others,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not gonna put an advertisement out for them.</p>
<p>But, you know, I thought that market would have grown.</p>
<p>Yeah, my sense was, when I interacted with TOR,</p>
<p>it was that there&rsquo;s huge usability issues.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s for like legal activity.</p>
<p>Because like if you care about privacy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not as good of a browser.</p>
<p>Like, to look at stuff.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s way too slow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way too slow, but I mean, you can&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>like, I know some people would use it</p>
<p>to like view movies like Netflix.</p>
<p>You can only view certain movies in certain countries.</p>
<p>You can use it for that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s too slow even for that, so.</p>
<p>Were you ever able to hold in your mind</p>
<p>the landscape of the dark web?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s going on out there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, to me as a human being,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just difficult to understand the digital world.</p>
<p>Like these anonymous usernames.</p>
<p>Like doing anonymous activity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s hard to, what am I trying to say?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to visualize it in the way I can visualize</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about Hitler.</p>
<p>I can visualize meetings between people,</p>
<p>military strategy, deciding on certain evil atrocities,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I can visualize the people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s agreements, hands, handshakes,</p>
<p>stuff signed, groups built.</p>
<p>Like in the digital space, like with bots,</p>
<p>with anonymity, anyone human can be multiple people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just-</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all lies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all lies.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, it feels like I can&rsquo;t trust anything.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You honestly can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And like, you can talk to two different people</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same person.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so many different, you know,</p>
<p>Hector had so many different identities online,</p>
<p>the, you know, of things that, you know,</p>
<p>the lies to each other.</p>
<p>I mean, he lied to people inside his group</p>
<p>just to use another name to spy on,</p>
<p>make sure what they were talking shit behind his back</p>
<p>or weren&rsquo;t doing anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all lies and people that can keep</p>
<p>all those lies straight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable to me.</p>
<p>Ross Albrecht represents the very early days of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the competence wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Just imagine how good the people are now.</p>
<p>The kids that grow up.</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;ve learned from his mistakes.</p>
<p>Just the extreme competence.</p>
<p>You just see how good people are at video games,</p>
<p>like the level of play in terms of video games.</p>
<p>Like I used to think I sucked.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m not even like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even in the like consideration</p>
<p>of calling myself shitty at video games.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even, I&rsquo;m like non-existent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like the mold.</p>
<p>Yeah, I stopped playing because it&rsquo;s so embarrassing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like wrestling with your kid</p>
<p>and he finally beats you.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, fuck that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not wrestling with my kid ever again.</p>
<p>And in some sense, hacking at its best and its worst</p>
<p>is a kind of game.</p>
<p>And you can get exceptionally good at that kind of game.</p>
<p>And you get the accolades of it.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s power that comes along.</p>
<p>If you have success,</p>
<p>look at the kid that was hacking into Uber</p>
<p>and Rockstar Games.</p>
<p>He put it out there that he was doing it.</p>
<p>I mean, he used the name,</p>
<p>whatever hacked into Uber was his screen name.</p>
<p>He was very proud of it.</p>
<p>I mean, one building evidence against himself.</p>
<p>But he wanted that slap on the back.</p>
<p>Like, look at what a great hacker you are.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think is in the mind of that guy?</p>
<p>What do you think is in the mind of Ross?</p>
<p>Do you think they see themselves as good people?</p>
<p>Do you think they acknowledge</p>
<p>the bad they&rsquo;re doing onto the world?</p>
<p>So that Uber hacker, I think that&rsquo;s just youth</p>
<p>not realizing what consequences are,</p>
<p>I mean, based on his actions.</p>
<p>Ross was a little bit older.</p>
<p>I think Ross truly is a libertarian.</p>
<p>He truly had his beliefs that he could provide</p>
<p>the gateway for other people</p>
<p>to live that libertarian lifestyle</p>
<p>and put in their body what they want.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that was a front or a lie.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between DPR and Ross?</p>
<p>You said like, I have never met Ross until,</p>
<p>I have only had those two days of worth of interaction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting given how long you&rsquo;ve chased him</p>
<p>and then having met him,</p>
<p>what was the difference to you as a human being?</p>
<p>He was a human being.</p>
<p>He was an actual person.</p>
<p>He was nervous when we arrested him.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I learned</p>
<p>through my law enforcement career</p>
<p>is if I&rsquo;m gonna be the case agent,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be the one in charge of dealing with this person,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not putting handcuffs on him.</p>
<p>Somebody else is gonna do that.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m gonna be there to help him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m your conduit to help.</p>
<p>And so right after someone&rsquo;s arrested,</p>
<p>you obviously have had them down for weapons</p>
<p>to make sure for everybody&rsquo;s safety,</p>
<p>but then I just put my hand on their chest.</p>
<p>Just feel their heart, feel their breathing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the scariest day,</p>
<p>but then to have that human contact</p>
<p>kind of settles people down.</p>
<p>And you can kind of like, let&rsquo;s start thinking about this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you, I&rsquo;m gonna be open and honest with you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of cops out there and federal agents, cops,</p>
<p>that just go to the hard-ass tactic.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get very far with that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get very far being a mean asshole to somebody.</p>
<p>Be compassionate, be human,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna go a lot further.</p>
<p>So given everything he&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>you were still able to have compassion for him?</p>
<p>Yeah, we took him to the jail and we,</p>
<p>so it was after hours,</p>
<p>so he didn&rsquo;t get to see a judge that day.</p>
<p>So we stuck him in the San Francisco jail.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t slept for about four days</p>
<p>because I was dealing with people in Iceland,</p>
<p>bosses in DC, bosses in New York.</p>
<p>So, and I was in San Francisco.</p>
<p>So timeframe, like the Iceland people were calling me</p>
<p>when I was supposed to be sleeping, it was insane.</p>
<p>But I still went out that night</p>
<p>while Ross sat in jail and bought him breakfast.</p>
<p>I said, what do you want for breakfast?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a nice breakfast for you.</p>
<p>Because we picked him up in the morning</p>
<p>and took him over to the FBI to do the FBI booking,</p>
<p>the fingerprints and all that.</p>
<p>And I got him breakfast.</p>
<p>I mean, and you don&rsquo;t get paid back for that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking, but out of my own-</p>
<p>Did he make special requests for breakfast?</p>
<p>Yeah, he asked for certain things.</p>
<p>What can you mention?</p>
<p>Is that top secret FBI?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not top secret.</p>
<p>I think he wanted some granola bars,</p>
<p>like, and, you know, but I mean,</p>
<p>he already had lawyered up, so we, you know,</p>
<p>which is his right, he can do that.</p>
<p>So I knew we were going to work together,</p>
<p>you know, like I did with Hector.</p>
<p>But I mean, this is the guy&rsquo;s last day.</p>
<p>Most of the conversations have to be then with lawyers?</p>
<p>From that point on, I can&rsquo;t question him</p>
<p>when he asked for a lawyer,</p>
<p>or if I did, it couldn&rsquo;t be used against him.</p>
<p>So we just had conversations where I talked to him.</p>
<p>You know, he could, you know, could say things to me,</p>
<p>but then I have to remind him that he asked for a lawyer</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d have to waive that and all that.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t talk about his case so much.</p>
<p>We just talked about like human beings.</p>
<p>Did he, with his eyes, with his words,</p>
<p>reveal any kind of regret,</p>
<p>or did you see a human being changing,</p>
<p>understanding something about themselves</p>
<p>in the process of being caught?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>I mean, he did offer me $20 million to let him go</p>
<p>when we were driving to the jail.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>And I asked him what I was going to,</p>
<p>we were going to do with the agent</p>
<p>that sat in the front seat.</p>
<p>The money really broke him, huh?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think he kind of got caught up in how much money it was</p>
<p>and how, you know, when crypto started, it was pennies.</p>
<p>And by the time he got arrested, it was 120 bucks.</p>
<p>And, you know, 177,000 Bitcoins.</p>
<p>Even today, you know, that&rsquo;s a lot of Bitcoins.</p>
<p>So you really could have been,</p>
<p>if you continued to be one of the richest people</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>I possibly could have been,</p>
<p>if I took that 20 million then.</p>
<p>I could have been living,</p>
<p>we could have this conversation in Venezuela.</p>
<p>In a castle, in a palace.</p>
<p>Yeah, until it runs out</p>
<p>and then the government storms the castle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you talked to Russ since?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I would, I&rsquo;d be open to it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he probably wants to hear from me.</p>
<p>And do you know where, in which prison he is?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s somewhere out in Arizona.</p>
<p>I know he was in the one next to Supermax</p>
<p>for a little while, like the high security one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like shares the fence with Supermax,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s there anymore.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s out in Arizona.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while.</p>
<p>I wonder if you can do interviews in prison.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be nice.</p>
<p>Some people are allowed to.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ve not seen an interview with him.</p>
<p>I know people have wanted to interview him</p>
<p>about books and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Right, because the story really blew up.</p>
<p>Did it surprise to you how much the story</p>
<p>and many elements of it blew up?</p>
<p>Movies?</p>
<p>It did surprise me.</p>
<p>Like my wife&rsquo;s uncle, who I didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been married to my wife for 22 years now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he knew my name.</p>
<p>And he was excited about that.</p>
<p>He reached out when Silk Road came out.</p>
<p>So he, you know, that was surprising to see.</p>
<p>Did you think the movie on the topic was good?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with that movie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched it once.</p>
<p>It was kind of cool that Jimmy Simpson, you know,</p>
<p>was my name in the movie, but outside of that,</p>
<p>I thought it sort of missed the mark on some things.</p>
<p>When Hollywood, I don&rsquo;t think they understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting about these kinds of stories.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of things that are interesting</p>
<p>and they missed all of them.</p>
<p>So for example, I recently talked to John Carmack,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a world-class developer and so on.</p>
<p>So Hollywood would think that the interesting thing</p>
<p>about John Carmack is some kind of like shitty,</p>
<p>like a parody of a hacker or something like that.</p>
<p>They would show like really crappy,</p>
<p>like emulation of some kind of Linux terminal thing.</p>
<p>The reality is like the technical details</p>
<p>for five hours with him, for 10 hours with him</p>
<p>is what people actually want to see,</p>
<p>even people that don&rsquo;t program.</p>
<p>They want to see a brilliant mind,</p>
<p>the details that they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t understand all the details,</p>
<p>they want to have an inkling of the genius there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one way I&rsquo;m saying like,</p>
<p>that you want to reveal the genius,</p>
<p>the complexity of that world in interesting ways.</p>
<p>And to make a Hollywood almost parody caricature of it,</p>
<p>it just destroys the spirit of the thing.</p>
<p>So one, the Operation FBI is fascinating,</p>
<p>just tracking down these people</p>
<p>on the cyber security front is fascinating.</p>
<p>The other is just how you run TOR,</p>
<p>how you run this kind of organization,</p>
<p>the trust issues of the different criminal entities involved,</p>
<p>the anonymity, the low-hanging fruit,</p>
<p>the being shitty at certain parts on the technical front,</p>
<p>all of those are fascinating things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a movie should reveal.</p>
<p>Should probably be a series, honestly,</p>
<p>a Netflix series than a movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, an FX show or something like that,</p>
<p>kind of gritty.</p>
<p>Yeah, gritty, exactly, gritty.</p>
<p>I mean, shows like Chernobyl from HBO made me realize,</p>
<p>okay, you can do a good job of a difficult story</p>
<p>and reveal the human side,</p>
<p>but also reveal the technical side</p>
<p>and have some deep, profound understanding on that case,</p>
<p>on the bureaucracy of a Soviet regime.</p>
<p>In this case, you could reveal the bureaucracy,</p>
<p>the chaos of a criminal organization,</p>
<p>of a law enforcement organization.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so much to explore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like Chernobyl.</p>
<p>Whenever you watch it, I can&rsquo;t watch episode three, though,</p>
<p>the animal scene, the episode,</p>
<p>they go around shooting all the dogs and all that.</p>
<p>I gotta skip that part.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a big softie, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>I really am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll probably cry at some point.</p>
<p>I love it, I love it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me talking about that episode</p>
<p>you made about your grandmother.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that was rough.</p>
<p>Just to linger on this ethical versus legal question,</p>
<p>what do you think about people like Aaron Schwartz?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with him,</p>
<p>but he was somebody who broke the law</p>
<p>in the name of an ethical ideal.</p>
<p>He downloaded and released academic publications</p>
<p>that were behind a paywall,</p>
<p>and he was arrested for that and then committed suicide.</p>
<p>And a lot of people see him, certainly in the MIT community,</p>
<p>but throughout the world as a hero,</p>
<p>because you look at the way knowledge,</p>
<p>scientific knowledge is being put behind paywalls,</p>
<p>it does seem somehow unethical.</p>
<p>And he basically broke the law</p>
<p>to do the ethical thing.</p>
<p>Now, you could challenge it, maybe it is unethical,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a gray area, and to me, at least, it is ethical.</p>
<p>To me, at least, he is a hero,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m familiar with the paywall</p>
<p>created by the institutions that hold these publications.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re adding very little value.</p>
<p>So it is basically holding hostage</p>
<p>the work of millions of brilliant scientists</p>
<p>for some kind of, honestly,</p>
<p>a crappy capitalist institution.</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;re not actually making that much money.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me.</p>
<p>It should, to me, it should all be open public access.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason it shouldn&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>all publications should be.</p>
<p>So he stood for that ideal,</p>
<p>and was punished harshly for it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other criticism, was too harshly.</p>
<p>And of course, deeply unfortunately,</p>
<p>that also led to a suicide,</p>
<p>because he was also tormented on many levels.</p>
<p>I mean, are you familiar with him?</p>
<p>What do you think about that line</p>
<p>between what is legal and what is ethical?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s tough, it&rsquo;s a tough case.</p>
<p>I mean, the outcome was tragic, obviously.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you&rsquo;re in law enforcement,</p>
<p>you have to, your job is to enforce the laws.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not, if you&rsquo;re told</p>
<p>that you have to do a certain case,</p>
<p>and there is a violation of, at the time,</p>
<p>18 U.S.C. 1030, computer hacking,</p>
<p>you have to press forward with that.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to charge,</p>
<p>you bring the case to the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>and whether they&rsquo;re gonna press charges or not,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really pick and choose what you press</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t press forward.</p>
<p>I never felt that, at least that flexibility,</p>
<p>not in the FBI, I mean, maybe when you&rsquo;re a street cop</p>
<p>and you pull somebody over,</p>
<p>you can let them go with a warning.</p>
<p>So in the FBI, you&rsquo;re sitting in a room,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also a human being, you have compassion.</p>
<p>You arrested Ross, the hand on the chest.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a human thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t be the jury for whether</p>
<p>it was a good hack or a bad hack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all someone, a victim has come forward</p>
<p>and said, we&rsquo;re the victim of this.</p>
<p>And I agree with you, because again,</p>
<p>the basis of the internet was to share academic thought.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s where the internet was born.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not up to you.</p>
<p>So the role of the FBI is to enforce the law.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a limited number of tools</p>
<p>on our Batman belt that we can use.</p>
<p>Not to get into all the aspects of the Trump case</p>
<p>and Mar-a-Lago and the documents there.</p>
<p>I mean, the FBI has so many tools they can use</p>
<p>and a search warrant is the only way they could get in there.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other legal document or legal way</p>
<p>to enter and get those documents.</p>
<p>What do you think about the FBI and Mar-a-Lago</p>
<p>and the FBI taking the documents for Donald Trump?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough spot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really tough spot.</p>
<p>The FBI has gotten a lot of black eyes recently.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the same FBI</p>
<p>that I remember when I was there.</p>
<p>Do you think they deserve it in part?</p>
<p>Was it done clumsily?</p>
<p>Their raiding of the former president&rsquo;s residence?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>Because again, they&rsquo;re only limited</p>
<p>to what they&rsquo;re legally allowed to do.</p>
<p>And a search warrant is the only legal way of doing it.</p>
<p>I have my personal and political views on certain things.</p>
<p>I think it might be surprising to some</p>
<p>where those political points stand.</p>
<p>But you told me offline that you&rsquo;re a hardcore communist.</p>
<p>That was very surprising to me.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the only way you tried</p>
<p>to bring me into the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Exactly, I was trying to recruit you.</p>
<p>Giving you all kinds of flyers.</p>
<p>Okay, but you said like,</p>
<p>people in the FBI are just following the law,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a chain of command and so on.</p>
<p>What do you think about the conspiracy theories</p>
<p>some small number of people inside the FBI conspired</p>
<p>to undermine the presidency of Donald Trump?</p>
<p>If you were to ask me when I was inside</p>
<p>and before all this happened,</p>
<p>I would say it never happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in conspiracies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many people involved.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s gonna come out with some sort of information.</p>
<p>But I mean, the more the stuff that comes out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s surprising that agents are being fired</p>
<p>because of certain actions that are taken inside</p>
<p>and being dismissed</p>
<p>because of politically motivated actions.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s explicit or just pressure?</p>
<p>Do you think there could exist just pressure</p>
<p>at the higher ups that has a political leaning</p>
<p>and you kind of maybe don&rsquo;t explicitly order</p>
<p>any kind of thing,</p>
<p>but just kind of pressure people to lean one way</p>
<p>or the other and then create a culture</p>
<p>that leans one way or the other based on political leanings?</p>
<p>You would really, really hope not.</p>
<p>But I mean, that seems to be the narrative</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being written.</p>
<p>But when you were operating, you didn&rsquo;t feel that pressure.</p>
<p>Man, I was such a low level.</p>
<p>I had no aspirations of being a boss.</p>
<p>I wanted to be a case agent my entire life.</p>
<p>So you love the puzzle of it, the chase.</p>
<p>I love solving things, yeah.</p>
<p>To be management and manage people and all that,</p>
<p>no desire whatsoever.</p>
<p>What do you think about Mark Zuckerberg</p>
<p>on Joe Rogan&rsquo;s podcast saying that the FBI</p>
<p>warned Facebook about potential foreign interference?</p>
<p>And then Facebook inferred from that</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re talking about Hunter Biden laptop story</p>
<p>and thereby censored it.</p>
<p>What do you think about that whole story?</p>
<p>Again, you asked me when I was in the FBI,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t believed it from being on the inside</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t believe these things,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certain narrative being written</p>
<p>that is surprising to me</p>
<p>that the FBI is involved in these stories.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing there is</p>
<p>the FBI is saying that they didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>make that implication.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s interference activity happening.</p>
<p>Just watch out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a weird relationship between FBI and Facebook.</p>
<p>You could see from the best possible interpretation</p>
<p>that the FBI just wants Facebook to be aware</p>
<p>because it is a powerful platform,</p>
<p>a platform for viral spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>So in the best possible interpretation of it,</p>
<p>it makes sense for FBI to send some information</p>
<p>saying like, we&rsquo;re seeing some shady activity.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But it seems like all of that somehow escalated</p>
<p>to a political interpretation.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, it sounded like there was a wink wink with it.</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t know if Mark meant for that to be that way.</p>
<p>Again, are we being social engineered</p>
<p>or was that a true expression that Mark had?</p>
<p>And I wonder if the wink wink is direct</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just culture, really?</p>
<p>You know, maybe certain people responsible</p>
<p>on the Facebook side have a certain political lean</p>
<p>and then certain people on the FBI side</p>
<p>have a political lean when they&rsquo;re interacting together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like literally has nothing to do</p>
<p>with a giant conspiracy theory,</p>
<p>but just with a culture that has a particular political lean</p>
<p>during a particular time in history.</p>
<p>And so like maybe it could be Hunter Biden laptop one time</p>
<p>and then it could be whoever,</p>
<p>Donald Trump Jr.&rsquo;s laptop another time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough job.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re the liaison,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the FBI&rsquo;s liaison to Facebook,</p>
<p>you know, there are certain people</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sure they were offered a position at some point.</p>
<p>It seems, you know, there&rsquo;s FBI agents that go,</p>
<p>I know of a couple that&rsquo;s gone to Facebook.</p>
<p>This is a really good agent</p>
<p>that now leads up their child exploitation stuff.</p>
<p>Another squad mate runs their internal investigations,</p>
<p>both great investigators.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s good money,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re an FBI agent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s capped out at a, you know, a 1310</p>
<p>or whatever pay scale you&rsquo;re capped out at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s alluring to be, you know,</p>
<p>maybe want to please them and be asked to join them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And over time that corrupts.</p>
<p>I think there has to be an introspection</p>
<p>in tech companies about the culture that they develop,</p>
<p>about the political ideology, the bubble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see that bubble.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve asked myself a lot of questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve interviewed the Pfizer CEO,</p>
<p>what seems now a long time ago,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of criticism.</p>
<p>The positive comments,</p>
<p>but also criticism from that conversation.</p>
<p>And I did a lot of soul searching</p>
<p>about the kind of bubbles we have in this world.</p>
<p>And it makes me wonder, pharmaceutical companies,</p>
<p>they all believe they&rsquo;re doing good.</p>
<p>And I wonder, because the ideal they have</p>
<p>is to create drugs that help people and do so at scale.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to know at which point that can be corrupted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know when it was corrupted</p>
<p>and if it was corrupted and where,</p>
<p>which drugs and which companies and so on.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that complicated.</p>
<p>It seems like inside a bubble,</p>
<p>you can convince yourself if anything is good.</p>
<p>People inside the Third Reich regime</p>
<p>were able to convince themselves, I&rsquo;m sure many.</p>
<p>Just Bloodlands, there&rsquo;s another book</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been recently reading about it.</p>
<p>And the ability of humans to convince they&rsquo;re doing good</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re clearly murdering and torturing people</p>
<p>in front of their eyes is fascinating.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to convince themselves they&rsquo;re doing good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s not even an inkling of doubt.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what to make of that.</p>
<p>So it has taught me to be a little bit more careful</p>
<p>when I enter into different bubbles</p>
<p>to be skeptical about what&rsquo;s taken</p>
<p>as an assumption of truth.</p>
<p>Like you always have to be skeptical</p>
<p>about like what&rsquo;s assumed is true.</p>
<p>Is it possible it&rsquo;s not true?</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re talking about America,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s assumed that, you know,</p>
<p>in certain places that surveillance is good.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s question that assumption.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I also, it inspired me</p>
<p>to question my own assumptions that I hold as true.</p>
<p>Constantly, constantly, it&rsquo;s tough, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>I mean, do you want to be just static and not grow?</p>
<p>You have to question yourself on some of these things</p>
<p>if you want to grow as a person.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Now, one of the tough things actually</p>
<p>of being a public personality when you speak publicly</p>
<p>is you get attacked all along the way as you&rsquo;re growing.</p>
<p>And in part, a big softy as well, if I may say.</p>
<p>And those heart, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.</p>
<p>Do you pay attention to it?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>Like I have two choices.</p>
<p>One, you can shut yourself off from the world and ignore it.</p>
<p>I never found that compelling,</p>
<p>this kind of idea of like haters gonna hate.</p>
<p>Like this idea that anyone with a big platform</p>
<p>or anyone&rsquo;s ever done anything</p>
<p>has always gotten hate.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, maybe.</p>
<p>But like I still want to be vulnerable,</p>
<p>wear my heart on my sleeve, really show myself,</p>
<p>like open myself to the world, really listen to people.</p>
<p>And that means every once in a while,</p>
<p>somebody will say something that touches me</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s like, what if they&rsquo;re right?</p>
<p>Do you let that hate influence you?</p>
<p>I mean, can you be bullied into a different opinion</p>
<p>than you think you really are just because of that hate?</p>
<p>No, no, I believe not.</p>
<p>But it hurts in a way that&rsquo;s hard to explain.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, it just, it gets to like,</p>
<p>it shakes your faith in humanity actually</p>
<p>is probably why it hurts.</p>
<p>Like people that call me a Putin apologist</p>
<p>or a Zelensky apologist,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m currently getting almost an equal amount of,</p>
<p>but it hurts.</p>
<p>It hurts because I,</p>
<p>it hurts because it damages slightly my faith in humanity</p>
<p>to be able to see the love that connects us</p>
<p>and then to see that I&rsquo;m trying to find that</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;m doing my best in the limited capabilities</p>
<p>I have to find that.</p>
<p>And so to call me something like a bad actor,</p>
<p>essentially, from whatever perspective,</p>
<p>it just makes me realize, well,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t have empathy and compassion for each other.</p>
<p>And it makes me question that for a brief moment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a crack and it hurts.</p>
<p>How many people do this to your face?</p>
<p>Very few.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s online e-muscles, man.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just flexing their e-muscles.</p>
<p>I have to be honest, that, it happens.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve hung around with Rogan enough.</p>
<p>When your platform grows,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that will come up to Joe</p>
<p>and say stuff to his face that they forget.</p>
<p>They still, they forget he&rsquo;s an actual real human being.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll make accusations about him.</p>
<p>So does that cause him to wall himself off more?</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s pretty gangster on that.</p>
<p>But yeah, it still hurts.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re human, if you really feel others,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also the difference with Joe and me.</p>
<p>He has a family that he deeply loves,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an escape from the world for him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a loneliness in me that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always longing to connect with people</p>
<p>and with regular people,</p>
<p>just to learn their stories and so on.</p>
<p>And so if you open yourself up that way,</p>
<p>the things they tell you can really hurt in every way.</p>
<p>Like just me going to Ukraine,</p>
<p>just seeing so much loss and death,</p>
<p>some of it is, I mean, unforgettably haunting.</p>
<p>Not in some kind of political way, activist way,</p>
<p>or who&rsquo;s right, who&rsquo;s wrong way,</p>
<p>but just like, man, so much pain.</p>
<p>You see it and it just stays with you.</p>
<p>When you see a human being bad to another human,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get rid of that in your head.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t imagine that we can treat each other like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hard part, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, for me it is.</p>
<p>When I saw parents,</p>
<p>like when I did the child exploitation stuff,</p>
<p>when they rented their children out,</p>
<p>they literally rented infant children out</p>
<p>to others for sexual gratification.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know how a human being</p>
<p>could do that to another human being.</p>
<p>And that sounds like the kind of thing you&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>I mean, I went through a huge funk</p>
<p>when I did those cases afterwards.</p>
<p>I should have talked to somebody,</p>
<p>but in the FBI, you have to keep that machismo up</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re gonna take your gun away from you.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s examples of evil</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s like the worst of human nature,</p>
<p>but just because I have-</p>
<p>War is just as bad, I mean.</p>
<p>Somehow war, it&rsquo;s somehow understandable</p>
<p>given all the very intense propaganda that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So you can understand that there is love</p>
<p>in the heart of the soldiers on each side</p>
<p>given the information they&rsquo;re given.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people on the Russian side</p>
<p>believe they&rsquo;re saving these Ukrainian cities</p>
<p>from Nazi occupation.</p>
<p>Now, there is stories,</p>
<p>there is a lot of evidence of people</p>
<p>for fun murdering civilians.</p>
<p>Now, that is closer to the things you&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>of like evil, of evil embodied.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t interacted with that directly</p>
<p>with people who for fun murdered civilians.</p>
<p>But you know it&rsquo;s there in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not naive to it.</p>
<p>Yes, but if you experience that directly,</p>
<p>if somebody shot somebody for fun in front of me,</p>
<p>that would probably break me, yeah.</p>
<p>Like seeing it yourself, knowing that it exists</p>
<p>is different than seeing it yourself.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve interacted with the victims of that</p>
<p>and they tell me stories</p>
<p>and you see their homes destroyed,</p>
<p>destroyed for no good military reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s civilians with civilian homes being destroyed.</p>
<p>That really lingers with you.</p>
<p>But yeah, the people that are capable of that.</p>
<p>That goes with the propaganda.</p>
<p>I mean, if you were to build a story,</p>
<p>you have to have on the other side,</p>
<p>the homes are gonna be destroyed,</p>
<p>the non-military targets are gonna be destroyed.</p>
<p>To put it in perspective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure a lot of people understand</p>
<p>the deep human side</p>
<p>or even the military strategy side of this war.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of experts outside of the situation</p>
<p>that are commenting on it with certainty.</p>
<p>And that kind of hurts me</p>
<p>because I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much propaganda,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to know what is true.</p>
<p>Yeah, so my whole hope was to travel to Ukraine,</p>
<p>to travel to Russia, to talk to soldiers,</p>
<p>to talk to leaders, to talk to real people</p>
<p>that have lost homes, that have lost family members,</p>
<p>that who this war has divided,</p>
<p>who this war changed completely how they see the world.</p>
<p>Whether they have love or hate in their heart</p>
<p>to understand their stories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot on the human side of things</p>
<p>by having talked to a lot of people there.</p>
<p>But it has been on the Ukrainian side for me currently.</p>
<p>Traveling to the Russian side is more difficult.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about your now friend.</p>
<p>Can we go as far as to say his friend in Sabu,</p>
<p>Hector Maseguer.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your long story with him?</p>
<p>Can you tell me about what is LALSEC?</p>
<p>Who is Sabu?</p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s Anonymous?</p>
<p>What is Anonymous?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the right place to start that story?</p>
<p>Probably Anonymous.</p>
<p>Anonymous was a, it still is, I guess,</p>
<p>a decentralized organization.</p>
<p>They call themselves Headless,</p>
<p>but once you look into them a little ways,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really Headless.</p>
<p>The power struggle comes with whoever has a hacking ability.</p>
<p>That might be you&rsquo;re a good hacker</p>
<p>or you have a giant botnet used for DDoS.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna wield more power</p>
<p>if you can control where it goes.</p>
<p>Anonymous started doing their hacktivism stuff</p>
<p>in 2010 or so.</p>
<p>The word hack was in the media all the time then.</p>
<p>And then right around then,</p>
<p>there was a federal contractor named HBGary Federal.</p>
<p>Their CEO is Aaron Barr.</p>
<p>And Aaron Barr said he was gonna come out</p>
<p>and de-anonymize Anonymous.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna come out and talk at Black Hat</p>
<p>or Defcon or one of those and say who they are.</p>
<p>He figured it out by based on when people were online,</p>
<p>when people were in IRC, when tweets came out.</p>
<p>There was no scientific proof behind it or anything.</p>
<p>So he was just gonna falsely name people</p>
<p>that were in Anonymous.</p>
<p>So Anonymous went on the attack.</p>
<p>They went and hacked in HBGary Federal</p>
<p>and they turned his life upside down.</p>
<p>They took over his Twitter account</p>
<p>and all that stuff pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I have very mixed feelings about all of this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yet, a part of me</p>
<p>admires the positive side of the hacktivism.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is there no room for admiration there</p>
<p>of the fuck you to the man?</p>
<p>Not at the time.</p>
<p>Again, it was a violation.</p>
<p>The 18 USC 1030.</p>
<p>So it was my job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I, you know.</p>
<p>So at the time, no.</p>
<p>In retrospect, sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But what was the philosophy of the hacktivism?</p>
<p>Philosophically, were they at least expressing it</p>
<p>for the good of humanity or no?</p>
<p>They outwardly said that they were gonna go after people</p>
<p>that they thought were corrupt.</p>
<p>So they were judge and jury on corruption.</p>
<p>They were gonna go after it.</p>
<p>Once you get inside and realize what they were doing,</p>
<p>they were going after people</p>
<p>that they had an opportunity to go after.</p>
<p>So maybe someone had a zero day</p>
<p>and then they searched for servers running that zero day.</p>
<p>And then from there, let&rsquo;s find a target.</p>
<p>I mean, one time they went after a toilet paper company.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand what that toilet paper company did</p>
<p>but it was an opportunity to make a splash.</p>
<p>Is there some, some way for the joke, for the lulls?</p>
<p>It developed into that.</p>
<p>So I think the hacktivism</p>
<p>and the anonymous stuff wasn&rsquo;t so much for the lulls</p>
<p>but from that HP Gary federal hack,</p>
<p>then there were six guys that worked well together</p>
<p>and they formed a crew, a hacking crew.</p>
<p>And they kind of split off into their own private channels.</p>
<p>And that was lull sack or laughing at your security</p>
<p>was their motto.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s L-U-L-Z-S-E-C, lulls sack.</p>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p>Lulls sack.</p>
<p>And who founded that organization?</p>
<p>So Kayla and Sabu were the hackers of the group.</p>
<p>And so they really did all the work on HP Gary.</p>
<p>So these are code names.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s their online names.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re Knicks.</p>
<p>And so, you know, they, they,</p>
<p>and they, that&rsquo;s all they knew each other as, you know</p>
<p>they talked as, as those names and they worked well together.</p>
<p>And so they, they formed a hacking crew</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when they started the, the,</p>
<p>at first they didn&rsquo;t name it this</p>
<p>but it was the 50 days of lulls</p>
<p>where they would just release major, major breaches.</p>
<p>And it stirred up the media.</p>
<p>I mean, it put hacking in on, in the media every day.</p>
<p>They had 400 or 500,000 Twitter followers.</p>
<p>You know, and it was kind of interesting</p>
<p>but then they started swinging at the beehive</p>
<p>and they, they, they took out some FBI affiliated sites</p>
<p>and then they started a fuck FBI Fridays</p>
<p>where every, every Friday they would release something.</p>
<p>And we waited it for with bated breath.</p>
<p>I mean, they had us hook, line and sinker pissed.</p>
<p>We were waiting to see what was going to be dropped</p>
<p>every Friday.</p>
<p>It was, it&rsquo;s a little embarrassing looking back on it now.</p>
<p>And this is in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>Yeah, this was 2010, 2011 around there.</p>
<p>You actually linger on anonymous.</p>
<p>What, do you still understand what the heck is anonymous?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a place where you hang out.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it started on 4chan, went to 8chan</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s really just anyone.</p>
<p>You can be an anonymous right now if you wanted to.</p>
<p>Just, you&rsquo;re in there hanging out in the channel.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re probably not going to get much cred</p>
<p>until you work your way up and prove who you are</p>
<p>or someone vouches for you.</p>
<p>But anybody can be an anonymous.</p>
<p>Anybody can leave anonymous.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the leadership of anonymous?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense that there is a leadership?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a power play.</p>
<p>Now, is that someone that says this is what we&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I love the philosophical and the technical aspect</p>
<p>of all of this.</p>
<p>But I think there is a slippery slope</p>
<p>to where for the lulls, you can actually really hurt people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the terrifying thing.</p>
<p>When you attach, I&rsquo;m actually really terrified</p>
<p>of the power of the lull.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fun thing somehow becomes a slippery slope.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t quite understood the dynamics of that.</p>
<p>But even in myself, if you just have fun with a thing,</p>
<p>you lose track of the ethical grounding of the thing.</p>
<p>And so like, it feels like hacking for fun</p>
<p>can just turn it, like literally lead to nuclear war.</p>
<p>Like literally destabilize.</p>
<p>Yeah, yada, yada, yada, nuclear war.</p>
<p>I could see it, yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been more careful with the lull.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been more careful about that.</p>
<p>And I wonder about it because in internet speak,</p>
<p>somehow ethics can be put aside</p>
<p>through the slippery slope of language.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, everything becomes a joke.</p>
<p>If everything&rsquo;s a joke, then everything&rsquo;s allowed</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s allowed.</p>
<p>Then you don&rsquo;t have a sense of what is right and wrong.</p>
<p>You lose sense of what is right and wrong.</p>
<p>You still have victims.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re laughing at someone.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s the butt of this joke.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s major corporations or the individuals,</p>
<p>I mean, some of the stuff they did was just</p>
<p>releasing people&rsquo;s PII, their personal identifying</p>
<p>information and stuff like that.</p>
<p>I mean, is it a big deal?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>But if you could choose to not have your information</p>
<p>put out there, probably wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We do have a sense of what anonymous is today.</p>
<p>Has it ever been one stable organization</p>
<p>or is it a collection of hackers that kind of emerge</p>
<p>for particular tasks, for particular,</p>
<p>like, hacktivism tasks and that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a collection of people that has some hackers in it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of big hackers in it.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some that&rsquo;ll come bounce in and bounce out.</p>
<p>Even back then, there was probably just as many</p>
<p>reporters in it, people in the media in it,</p>
<p>with the hackers at the time,</p>
<p>just trying to get the inside scoop on things.</p>
<p>You know, some giving the inside scoop.</p>
<p>You know, we arrested a reporter that gave over</p>
<p>the username and password to his newspaper.</p>
<p>And, you know, just so he could break the story.</p>
<p>He trusted him.</p>
<p>Speaking of trust, reporters, boy, there&rsquo;s good ones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good ones.</p>
<p>There are.</p>
<p>There are.</p>
<p>But boy, do I have a complicated relationship with them.</p>
<p>How many stories about you are completely true?</p>
<p>You can just make stuff up on the internet.</p>
<p>And one of the things that, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many fascinating psychological,</p>
<p>sociological elements of the internet to me.</p>
<p>One of them is that you can say that Lex is a lizard, right?</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not funny, so lizard is kind of funny.</p>
<p>What should we say?</p>
<p>Lex has admitted to being an agent of the FBI, okay?</p>
<p>You can just say that, right?</p>
<p>And then the response that the internet would be like,</p>
<p>oh, is that true?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t go like, provide evidence, please, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just say like, oh, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I kind of thought he might be kind of weird.</p>
<p>And then it piles on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, hey, hey, guys.</p>
<p>Like, here&rsquo;s a random dude on the internet</p>
<p>just said a random thing.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just like pile up as, and then.</p>
<p>Yeah, Johnny6969 is now a source that says.</p>
<p>And then the thing is, I&rsquo;m a tiny guy,</p>
<p>but when it grows, if you have a big platform,</p>
<p>I feel like newspapers will pick that up</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll start to build on a story</p>
<p>and you never know where that story really started.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, actually, honestly, it&rsquo;s kind of cool</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a viral nature of the internet</p>
<p>that can just fabricate truth completely.</p>
<p>I think we have to accept that new reality</p>
<p>and try to deal with it somehow.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just complain that Johnny69</p>
<p>can start a random thing,</p>
<p>but I think in the best possible world,</p>
<p>it is the role of the journalist</p>
<p>to be the adult in the room and put a stop to it</p>
<p>versus look for the sexiest story</p>
<p>so that there could be clickbait that can generate money.</p>
<p>Journalism should be about sort of slowing things down,</p>
<p>thinking deeply through what is true or not</p>
<p>and showing that to the world.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of hunger for that.</p>
<p>And I think that would actually get</p>
<p>the most clicks in the end.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s that same pressure</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re talking about with the FBI</p>
<p>and with the tech companies about Controllers.</p>
<p>I mean, the editors have to please and get those clicks.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re measured by those clicks.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure the journalists, the true journalists,</p>
<p>the good ones out there want that,</p>
<p>but they want to stay employed too.</p>
<p>Can I actually ask you really as another tangent,</p>
<p>the Jared and others, they&rsquo;re doing undercover.</p>
<p>In terms of the tools you have</p>
<p>for catching cybersecurity criminals,</p>
<p>how much of it is undercover?</p>
<p>Undercover is a high bar to jump over.</p>
<p>You have to do a lot to start an undercover in the FBI.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of thresholds.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not your first investigative tool step.</p>
<p>You have to identify a problem</p>
<p>and then show that the lower steps can&rsquo;t get you there.</p>
<p>But I mean, I think we had an undercover</p>
<p>going on in the squad about all times.</p>
<p>When one was being shut down or taken down,</p>
<p>we were spinning up another one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a good tool to have and utilize.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a lot of work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think if you run one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never run another one in your life.</p>
<p>Oh, so it&rsquo;s like psychologically,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of work just technically,</p>
<p>but also psychologically, like you have to really-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 24 seven, you&rsquo;re inside that world.</p>
<p>Like you have to know what&rsquo;s going on and what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking on,</p>
<p>you have to remember who you are</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re, because you&rsquo;re a criminal online.</p>
<p>You have to go to a special school for it too.</p>
<p>Was that ever something compelling to you?</p>
<p>I went through the school,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a pretty open and honest guy.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s tough for me to build that wall of lies.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just not smart enough</p>
<p>to keep all the lies straight.</p>
<p>Yeah, but a guy who&rsquo;s good at building up a wall of lies</p>
<p>would say that exact same thing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so annoying the way truth works in this world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, people have told me,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to be honest and transparent,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what an agent would do, right?</p>
<p>But I feel like an agent would not wear a suit and tie.</p>
<p>I wore a suit and tie every day.</p>
<p>I was a suit and tie guy.</p>
<p>You were?</p>
<p>Yeah, every day.</p>
<p>I remember one time I wore shorts in and the SAC came in.</p>
<p>And this was when I was a rockstar at the time in the bureau</p>
<p>and I had shorts in and I said,</p>
<p>sorry, ma&rsquo;am, I apologize for my attire.</p>
<p>And she goes, you can wear bike shorts in here.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, shit, that sounds nice.</p>
<p>I never wore the bike shorts, but.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But see, I don&rsquo;t see a suit and tie as constraining.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s liberating in sorts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, shows that you&rsquo;re taking the moment seriously.</p>
<p>Well, not just that, people wanted it.</p>
<p>I mean, people expected when you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you are dressed like a perfect FBI agent.</p>
<p>When someone knocks on their door,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they want to see.</p>
<p>They want to see what Hollywood built up</p>
<p>is what an FBI agent is.</p>
<p>You show up like my friend, Il-Won.</p>
<p>He was dressed always in t-shirts and shorts.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t going to take him serious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to give him what they want.</p>
<p>I wonder how many police that can just show up</p>
<p>and say I&rsquo;m from the FBI and start interrogating them.</p>
<p>Like at a bar.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Definitely, if they&rsquo;ve had a few drinks, you can definitely.</p>
<p>Well, but people are going to recognize you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing.</p>
<p>You start taking out big cases.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t work cases anymore in the FBI.</p>
<p>Your face gets out there.</p>
<p>Your name, too.</p>
<p>Well, actually, let me ask you about that</p>
<p>before we return to our friend, Sabu.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve tracked and worked on</p>
<p>some of the most dangerous people in this world.</p>
<p>Have you ever feared for your life?</p>
<p>So I had to make a really, really</p>
<p>shitty phone call one time.</p>
<p>I was sitting in the bureau,</p>
<p>and this was right after Silk Road,</p>
<p>and Jared called me.</p>
<p>He was back in Chicago.</p>
<p>And he called me and said, hey,</p>
<p>your name and your kid&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>are on a website for an assassination.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re paying to have you guys killed.</p>
<p>Now, these things happen on the black market.</p>
<p>They come up, and people debate</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re real or not.</p>
<p>But we have to take it serious.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s paying to have me killed.</p>
<p>So I had to call my wife, and we had a word,</p>
<p>in that if I said this word,</p>
<p>and we only said it one time to each other,</p>
<p>if I said this word, this is serious.</p>
<p>Drop what you&rsquo;re doing and get to the kids.</p>
<p>And so I had to drop the word to her.</p>
<p>And I could feel the breath come out of her,</p>
<p>because she thought her kids were in danger,</p>
<p>at the time they were.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t in a state of mind to drive myself.</p>
<p>So an agent on the squad, a girl named Evelina,</p>
<p>she drove me, lights and sirens</p>
<p>all the way to my kid&rsquo;s school.</p>
<p>And we had locked, I called the school.</p>
<p>We were in a lockdown.</p>
<p>Nobody should get in or out,</p>
<p>especially someone with a gun.</p>
<p>The first thing they did</p>
<p>was let me in the building with a gun.</p>
<p>So I was a little disappointed with that.</p>
<p>My kids were, I think, kindergarten and fifth grade</p>
<p>or somewhere around there.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re closer, second year, I&rsquo;m not sure where.</p>
<p>But all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>And we had to, from there, go move into a safe house.</p>
<p>I live in New York City.</p>
<p>NYPD surrounded my house.</p>
<p>The FBI put cameras outside my house.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t drive in my neighborhood</p>
<p>without your license plate being read.</p>
<p>Hey, why is this person here?</p>
<p>Why is that person there?</p>
<p>I got to watch my house on an iPad</p>
<p>while I sat at my desk.</p>
<p>But again, I put my family through that</p>
<p>and it scared the shit out of them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, to be honest,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s sort of my mother-in-law&rsquo;s words</p>
<p>were, I thought you did cybercrime.</p>
<p>And because during Silk Road,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell my family what I was working on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>I want to escape that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be there.</p>
<p>I remember that like, so when I was in the FBI,</p>
<p>like driving in, I used to go in at 4.30 every morning</p>
<p>because I like to go to the gym</p>
<p>before I go to the desk.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be at the desk at seven.</p>
<p>So in the gym at five, a couple hours, and then go.</p>
<p>The best time I had was that drive-in in the morning</p>
<p>where I could just be myself.</p>
<p>I listened to a sports podcast out of DC.</p>
<p>And we talked about sports and the Nationals</p>
<p>and whatever it was, the Capitals.</p>
<p>It was great to not think about Silk Road for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>So, but that was my best time.</p>
<p>But yeah, again, so yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that move into the safe house.</p>
<p>I left my MP5 at home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Bureau&rsquo;s machine gun.</p>
<p>Showed my wife to just pull and spray, so.</p>
<p>But how often did you live or work and live with fear</p>
<p>in your heart?</p>
<p>It was only that time.</p>
<p>I mean, for actual physical security,</p>
<p>then, I mean, after the anonymous stuff,</p>
<p>I really tightened down to my cybersecurity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have social media.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have pictures of me and my kids online.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really, if I go to a wedding or something,</p>
<p>I say, I don&rsquo;t take my picture with my kids,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna post it someplace or something like that.</p>
<p>So that sort of security I have.</p>
<p>But just like everybody, you start to relax a little bit</p>
<p>and security breaks down, because it&rsquo;s not convenient.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also part of your job.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re much better at, I mean, your job now</p>
<p>and your job before, so you&rsquo;re probably much better</p>
<p>taking care of the low-hanging fruit, at least.</p>
<p>I understand the threat,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s what a lot of people don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>is understanding what the threat against them is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m aware of that and what possibly,</p>
<p>and I think about it, I think about things.</p>
<p>I do remember, so you tripped a memory in my mind.</p>
<p>I remember a lot of times, and I had a gun on my hip,</p>
<p>I still carry a gun to this day,</p>
<p>opening my front door and being concerned</p>
<p>what was on the other side, walking out of the house,</p>
<p>because I couldn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>I remember those four o&rsquo;clocks, heading to the car.</p>
<p>I was literally scared.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, having seen some of the things you&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>it makes you perhaps question</p>
<p>how much evil there is out there in the world,</p>
<p>how many dangerous people there are out there,</p>
<p>crazy people, even.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of crazy, there&rsquo;s a lot of evil.</p>
<p>Most people, I think, get into cybercrime</p>
<p>or just opportunistic, not necessarily evil.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really know, maybe think about the victim,</p>
<p>they just do it as a crime of opportunity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t label that as evil.</p>
<p>And one of the things about America</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m also very happy about</p>
<p>is that rule of law, despite everything we talk about,</p>
<p>there is, it&rsquo;s tough to be a criminal in the United States.</p>
<p>So if you walk outside your house,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re much safer than you are</p>
<p>in most other places in the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re safer and the system&rsquo;s tougher.</p>
<p>I mean, LulzSec, six guys, one guy in the United States,</p>
<p>five guys other places.</p>
<p>Hector was facing 125 years.</p>
<p>Those guys got slaps on the wrist</p>
<p>and went back to college.</p>
<p>You know, different laws, different places.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s Hector?</p>
<p>Tell me the story of Hector.</p>
<p>So this LulzSec organization was started.</p>
<p>So Hector was before that, he was in part anonymous.</p>
<p>He was doing all kinds of hacking stuff,</p>
<p>but then he launched LulzSec.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an old school hacker.</p>
<p>I mean, he learned how to hack,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna tell his story,</p>
<p>but he learned to hack because he grew up</p>
<p>in the Lower East Side of New York</p>
<p>and picked up some NYPD computers</p>
<p>that were left on the sidewalk for trash.</p>
<p>Taught himself how to-</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t exactly look like a hacker.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, he looks,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what he looks like,</p>
<p>but not like a technical, not what you would imagine.</p>
<p>But perhaps that&rsquo;s a Hollywood portrayal.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you get in trouble these days</p>
<p>saying what a hacker looks like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they have a traditional look.</p>
<p>Just like I said, Hollywood has an idea,</p>
<p>what an FBI looks like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can do that anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can say that anymore.</p>
<p>Well, he certainly has a big personality</p>
<p>and charisma and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Sabu.</p>
<p>I can see him selling me anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Sabu.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s convincing me of anything.</p>
<p>Two different people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Sabu and there&rsquo;s Hector.</p>
<p>Hector is a sweet guy.</p>
<p>He likes to have intellectual conversations,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just his thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d rather just sit there</p>
<p>and have a one-on-one conversation with you.</p>
<p>But Sabu, that&rsquo;s a ruthless motherfucker.</p>
<p>And you first met Sabu?</p>
<p>I was tracking Sabu.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I knew was Sabu.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know Hector.</p>
<p>And so when did your paths cross in terms of tracking?</p>
<p>When did you first take on the case?</p>
<p>The spring of 11.</p>
<p>So it was through Anonymous.</p>
<p>Through Anonymous, and really kind of LulzSec.</p>
<p>LulzSec was a big thing,</p>
<p>and it was pushed out to all the cyber,</p>
<p>56 field offices in the FBI.</p>
<p>Most of them have cyber squads or cyber units.</p>
<p>And so it was being pushed out there,</p>
<p>and it was in the news every day,</p>
<p>but it really wasn&rsquo;t ours.</p>
<p>So we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of victims</p>
<p>in our AOR area of responsibility.</p>
<p>And so we just kind of pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Then I got a tip that a local hacker in New York</p>
<p>had broken into AOL.</p>
<p>And so Olivia Olsen and I,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s another agent who she&rsquo;s still in.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a supervisor out in LA.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a great agent.</p>
<p>We went all around New York looking for this kid</p>
<p>just to see what we can find,</p>
<p>and ended up out in Staten Island at his grandmother&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t know where he was, obviously.</p>
<p>Why would she?</p>
<p>But I left my card.</p>
<p>He gave me a call that night and started talking to me.</p>
<p>And I said, let&rsquo;s just meet up tomorrow</p>
<p>at the McDonald&rsquo;s across from 26 Fed.</p>
<p>And he came in and three of us sat there and talked</p>
<p>and gave me his stuff.</p>
<p>He started telling me about the felonies</p>
<p>he was committing those days, including that break into AOL.</p>
<p>And then he finally says, you know, I can give you Sabu.</p>
<p>Sabu to us was the Kaiser Source of Hacking.</p>
<p>He was our guy.</p>
<p>He was the guy that was in the news</p>
<p>that was pissing us off.</p>
<p>So he was part of the FBI Fridays?</p>
<p>Sabu was, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, he led it.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was the leader of fuck FBI Fridays.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>What was one of the more memorable F, the triple Fs?</p>
<p>I said, what, how do you get,</p>
<p>why, how and why do you go after the beehive?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of intense.</p>
<p>You get you on the news.</p>
<p>It gets you, it&rsquo;s the lulls.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funnier to go after the big ones.</p>
<p>You know, and they weren&rsquo;t getting like real FBI.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t breaking into FBI mainframes or anything,</p>
<p>but they, you know, they were, you know,</p>
<p>affiliate sites or anything that had to do,</p>
<p>a lot of law enforcement stuff was coming out.</p>
<p>So, but, you know, we looked back.</p>
<p>And so if this kid knew that Sabu,</p>
<p>maybe there was a chance we&rsquo;d use him to lure Sabu out.</p>
<p>But we also said, well,</p>
<p>maybe this kid knows Sabu in real life.</p>
<p>And so we went and looked through the IPs</p>
<p>and 10 million IPs, we find one and it belonged to him.</p>
<p>And so that day Sabu, someone had doxxed Sabu</p>
<p>and we were a little afraid he was gonna be on the run.</p>
<p>We had a surveillance team</p>
<p>and FBI surveillance teams are awesome.</p>
<p>Like you can not even tell their FBI agents.</p>
<p>They are really that good.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s baby strollers and all,</p>
<p>whatever you wouldn&rsquo;t expect an FBI agent to have.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little like the movies.</p>
<p>A little bit, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it is true, but they fit into the area.</p>
<p>So now they&rsquo;re on the Lower East Side,</p>
<p>which is, you know, a baby stroller</p>
<p>might not fit in there as well as, you know,</p>
<p>somebody just laying on the ground or something like that.</p>
<p>They really get plenty of the character and get into it.</p>
<p>So now I can never trust a baby stroller again.</p>
<p>Well, probably shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Every baby, I&rsquo;m just like, look at,</p>
<p>stare at them suspiciously.</p>
<p>Especially if the mom&rsquo;s wearing cargo pants</p>
<p>while she pushes it, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if it&rsquo;s like a very stereotypical mom,</p>
<p>a stereotypical baby, I&rsquo;m gonna be very suspicious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna question the baby.</p>
<p>That baby&rsquo;s wired, be careful.</p>
<p>You know, we raced out there</p>
<p>and like our squad&rsquo;s not even full.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only a few guys there.</p>
<p>And like I said, I was a suit guy,</p>
<p>but that day I had shorts and a t-shirt on.</p>
<p>I had a white t-shirt on and I only bring it up</p>
<p>because Sabu makes fun of me to this day.</p>
<p>So I had a bulletproof vest and a white t-shirt on</p>
<p>and that was it.</p>
<p>I had shorts too and all that,</p>
<p>but raced over to there.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have any equipment.</p>
<p>We brought our boss&rsquo;s boss&rsquo;s boss.</p>
<p>He stopped off at NYPD, got us like a ballistic shield</p>
<p>and a battery ram if we needed it.</p>
<p>And then we get to Hector&rsquo;s house, Sabu&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s on the sixth floor.</p>
<p>And so normally, you know, we&rsquo;re the cyber dork squad.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll hop in the elevator.</p>
<p>Sixth floor is a long ways to go up</p>
<p>and bulletproof vest and a ballistic shield.</p>
<p>But we had been caught in an elevator before on a search.</p>
<p>So we didn&rsquo;t, took the stairs.</p>
<p>We get to the top, a tad winded,</p>
<p>but knocking the door and this big towering guy</p>
<p>opens the door just slightly.</p>
<p>And he sees the green vest with big yellow letters FBI</p>
<p>and he steps outside.</p>
<p>Can I help you?</p>
<p>You know, tries to social engineer us.</p>
<p>But eventually we get our way inside the house.</p>
<p>You know, I noticed a few things that are kind of</p>
<p>out of place.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a laptop charger and a flashing modem.</p>
<p>And I said, well, do you have a computer here?</p>
<p>And he says, no, there&rsquo;s no computer here.</p>
<p>So we knew the truce and then the half lies</p>
<p>and all that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So it took us about another two hours</p>
<p>and finally gave up that he was Sabu.</p>
<p>He was the guy we were looking for.</p>
<p>So we sat there and we kind of showed him</p>
<p>sort of the evidence we had against him.</p>
<p>And, you know, from his words,</p>
<p>we sat there and talked like two grown adults.</p>
<p>And, you know, I gave him the options and he said,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s talk about working together.</p>
<p>So he chose to become an informant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he chose that night,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where it kind of went to.</p>
<p>So then we brought him down to the FBI that night,</p>
<p>which was, it was a funny trip</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sitting in the back seat of the car with him.</p>
<p>And I was getting calls from all over the US</p>
<p>from different FBI agents saying</p>
<p>that we arrested the wrong guy.</p>
<p>And I was like, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, why do you think so?</p>
<p>I was like, because he says it&rsquo;s him.</p>
<p>And they still said, no, it&rsquo;s the wrong guy.</p>
<p>So I said, well, we&rsquo;ll see how it plays out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting because it&rsquo;s such a strange world.</p>
<p>Such a strange world because it&rsquo;s tough to,</p>
<p>because you still have to prove it&rsquo;s the same guy, right?</p>
<p>Because the anonymity.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we had his laptop by that point.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Him saying, that helped.</p>
<p>I gave him a clue in my world.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, if he would have fought it,</p>
<p>I mean, that definitely would have come in as evidence</p>
<p>that other FBI agents are saying it&rsquo;s not him.</p>
<p>You have to disclose that stuff.</p>
<p>So you had a lot of stuff on him.</p>
<p>What was he facing if-</p>
<p>He was facing 125 years.</p>
<p>125 years in prison.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, now that&rsquo;s if you took every charge</p>
<p>we had against him and put them consecutively.</p>
<p>No, no one ever gets charged with that.</p>
<p>But yeah, essentially it would have been 125 years.</p>
<p>You know, fast forward to the end,</p>
<p>he got thanked by the judge for his service</p>
<p>after nine months.</p>
<p>And he walked out of the court a free man.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s while being an informant.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, so the word informant here really isn&rsquo;t that good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fitting that technically,</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what he was,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t know the other people.</p>
<p>It was all anonymous.</p>
<p>He knew Nix and all that.</p>
<p>He really gave us the insight</p>
<p>of what was happening in the hacker world.</p>
<p>Like I said, he was an old school hacker.</p>
<p>He was back when hackers didn&rsquo;t work together</p>
<p>with anonymous.</p>
<p>You know, he was down, you know,</p>
<p>Cult of Dead Cow and those type guys, like way back.</p>
<p>And he was around for that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like an encyclopedia of hacking.</p>
<p>But, you know, we just-</p>
<p>Like Kiss Prime was in the nineties.</p>
<p>For terror hack.</p>
<p>But yeah, he kind of came back</p>
<p>when anonymous started going after MasterCard and PayPal</p>
<p>and all that, do the WikiLeaks stuff.</p>
<p>But even that little interaction, being an informant,</p>
<p>he probably made a lot of enemies.</p>
<p>How do you protect a guy like that?</p>
<p>He made enemies after it was revealed?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How does the FBI protect him?</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>I mean, perhaps I&rsquo;ll talk to him one day,</p>
<p>but is that guy afraid for his life?</p>
<p>I, again, I think-</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t seem like it.</p>
<p>He has very good security for himself, cyber security.</p>
<p>But, you know, yeah,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t like the negative things said about him online.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody does.</p>
<p>But, you know, I think it&rsquo;s so many years</p>
<p>of the internet kind of bitching at you and all that,</p>
<p>you get calloused.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just internet bitching.</p>
<p>And also the hacking world moves on very quickly.</p>
<p>He has kind of, they have their own wars to fight now,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not part of those wars anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still people out there that bitch and moan about him,</p>
<p>but yeah, I think it&rsquo;s less.</p>
<p>I think, you know, and he has a good message out there</p>
<p>of, you know, trying to keep kids</p>
<p>from making the same mistakes he made.</p>
<p>He tries to really preach that.</p>
<p>How do people get into this line of work?</p>
<p>Is there all kinds of ways being,</p>
<p>not your line of work, his line of work,</p>
<p>just all the stories you&rsquo;ve seen of people</p>
<p>that are in Anonymous and LulzSec and Silk Road</p>
<p>and all the cyber criminals you&rsquo;ve interacted with.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the profile of a cyber criminal?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a profile anymore.</p>
<p>You know, I used to be able to say, you know,</p>
<p>the kid in your mom&rsquo;s basement or something like that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not true anymore.</p>
<p>You know, like, it&rsquo;s wide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve arrested people</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t expect would be cyber criminals.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in the United States, it&rsquo;s international,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everything?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s international.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of the big hackers now,</p>
<p>the big arrests for hackers in England, surprisingly.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna see there&rsquo;s a lot of good hackers</p>
<p>like down in Brazil,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think Brazil law enforcement</p>
<p>is as good at hunting them down.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not gonna see the big arrests.</p>
<p>How much state-sponsored cyber attacks</p>
<p>are there, do you think?</p>
<p>More than you can imagine.</p>
<p>And what do you wanna say, an attack?</p>
<p>Was it a successful attack or just a probing?</p>
<p>Probing for information, just like feeling, you know,</p>
<p>testing that there&rsquo;s where the attack factors are,</p>
<p>trying to collect all the possible attack factors.</p>
<p>Put a Windows 7 machine on the internet,</p>
<p>forward face it, and put a packet sniffer on there,</p>
<p>and look at where the driver comes from.</p>
<p>I mean, in 24 hours,</p>
<p>you were gonna fill up a hard drive with packets</p>
<p>just coming at it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not hard to know.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just constantly probing</p>
<p>for entry points into things, you know.</p>
<p>You could go mad putting up Honeypot,</p>
<p>draws in intrusions,</p>
<p>try to see what methodologies.</p>
<p>Just to see what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>It maybe has fake information and stuff like that.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of to see what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and judge what&rsquo;s happening on the internet.</p>
<p>You know, lick your finger and test the wind</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening these days.</p>
<p>The funny thing about, like, because I&rsquo;m at MIT,</p>
<p>that attracted even more attention for the,</p>
<p>not for the lulz, but for the technical challenge.</p>
<p>It seems like people enjoy hacking MIT.</p>
<p>Just the amount of traffic MIT was getting for that,</p>
<p>in terms of just the sheer number of attacks</p>
<p>from different places, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, just like that.</p>
<p>Putting up a machine, seeing what comes.</p>
<p>NASA used to be the golden ring.</p>
<p>Now everybody got NASA.</p>
<p>That was like the early 90s.</p>
<p>If you could hack NASA, that was the,</p>
<p>now, yeah, MIT is a big one.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to see.</p>
<p>Respect.</p>
<p>Because I think in that case,</p>
<p>it comes from a somewhat good place.</p>
<p>Because, you know, they&rsquo;re not getting any money from MIT.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more for the challenge.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about that,</p>
<p>about this world of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>How big of a threat are cyber attacks</p>
<p>for companies and for individuals?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s lay out, where are we in this world?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the wild, wild west.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>people want the idea of security, but it&rsquo;s inconvenient,</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t, they push back on it.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of opportunistic,</p>
<p>nation state, financially motivated hackers,</p>
<p>hackers for the lulz.</p>
<p>You got three different tiers there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re on the prowl.</p>
<p>They have tools, they have really good tools</p>
<p>that are being used against us.</p>
<p>And at what scale?</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re thinking of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s talk about companies first.</p>
<p>So say you&rsquo;re talking to a mid-tier.</p>
<p>I wonder what the most interesting business is.</p>
<p>So Google, we can look at large tech companies,</p>
<p>or we can look at medium-sized tech companies.</p>
<p>And like, you are sitting in a room with a CTO,</p>
<p>with a CEO, and the question is, how fucked are we?</p>
<p>And what should we do?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the low-hanging fruit?</p>
<p>What are the different strategies</p>
<p>and those companies should consider?</p>
<p>I mean, the problem is they want a push button.</p>
<p>They want a out-of-the-box solution that I&rsquo;m secure.</p>
<p>They want to tell people they&rsquo;re secure, but-</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very challenging to have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>But if I could, if someone had it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be a billionaire.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be beyond a billionaire,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what everybody wants.</p>
<p>You know, you can buy all the tools you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s configuring them the proper way.</p>
<p>And if anyone&rsquo;s trying to tell you</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s one solution that fits all,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re staying whole salesmen.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people in cybersecurity</p>
<p>that are staying whole salesmen.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I feel like there&rsquo;s tools,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not configured correctly,</p>
<p>they just introduce,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t increase security significantly,</p>
<p>and they introduce a lot of pain for the people.</p>
<p>They decrease efficiency of the actual work you have to do.</p>
<p>So like, we had, I was at Google for a time,</p>
<p>and I think mostly I want to give props</p>
<p>to their security efforts, but user data,</p>
<p>so like data that belongs to users,</p>
<p>is like the holy, like the amount of security they have</p>
<p>around that is incredible.</p>
<p>So most, any time I had to work with</p>
<p>anything even resembling user data,</p>
<p>so I never got a chance to work with actual user data,</p>
<p>anything resembling that,</p>
<p>first of all, you have no access to the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to even come close</p>
<p>to the access to the internet.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much pain to actually,</p>
<p>like, interact with that data.</p>
<p>Where, I mean, it was extremely inefficient.</p>
<p>In places where I thought</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t have to be that inefficient,</p>
<p>the security was too much.</p>
<p>But I have to give respect to that,</p>
<p>in that case, you want to err on the side of security.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s Google, they were doing a good job of this.</p>
<p>The reputational harm, if it got out,</p>
<p>I mean, Google, why is Google drive-free?</p>
<p>Because they want your data.</p>
<p>They want you to park your data there.</p>
<p>So if they got hacked or leaked information,</p>
<p>the reputational harm would be tremendous.</p>
<p>But for a company that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to do that, right?</p>
<p>And the company&rsquo;s not as big as Google</p>
<p>or not as tech-savvy as Google,</p>
<p>might have a lot of trouble with doing that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Instead of increasing security,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just decrease the efficiency.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, so there&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>between IT and security.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, these mid-side companies,</p>
<p>they try to stack security into their IT department.</p>
<p>Your IT department is about business continuity.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re about trying to move business forward.</p>
<p>They want users to get the data they need</p>
<p>to do their job so the company can grow.</p>
<p>Security is not that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want you to get the data.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s fine-tuning you can do to ensure that.</p>
<p>I mean, as simple as having good onboarding procedures</p>
<p>for employees.</p>
<p>Like, you come into my company,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need access to everything.</p>
<p>Maybe you need access to something for one day.</p>
<p>Turn the access on, don&rsquo;t leave it on.</p>
<p>I mean, I was the victim of the OPM hack,</p>
<p>the Office of Personal Management,</p>
<p>because old credentials from a third-party vendor</p>
<p>were sitting there inactive.</p>
<p>And the Chinese government found those credentials</p>
<p>and were able to log in and steal all my information.</p>
<p>So a lot could be helped if you just control</p>
<p>the credentials, the access, the access control,</p>
<p>how long they last.</p>
<p>And people who need access to a certain thing</p>
<p>only get access to that thing and nothing else.</p>
<p>And then it just gets refreshed like that.</p>
<p>Access control, like we said,</p>
<p>setting up people, leaving the company,</p>
<p>get rid of their, they don&rsquo;t need control.</p>
<p>Two-factor authentication, that&rsquo;s a big thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I sound like a broken record</p>
<p>because this isn&rsquo;t anything new.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t rocket science.</p>
<p>The problem is we&rsquo;re not implementing it.</p>
<p>If we are, we&rsquo;re not doing it correctly</p>
<p>because these guys are taking us.</p>
<p>Well, two-factor authentication is a good example</p>
<p>of something that I just was annoyed by</p>
<p>for the longest time.</p>
<p>Because yes, it&rsquo;s very good,</p>
<p>but it seems that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to implement horribly</p>
<p>to where it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not convenient at all</p>
<p>for the legitimate user to use.</p>
<p>It should be trivial to do,</p>
<p>like to authenticate yourself twice should be super easy.</p>
<p>If security, if it&rsquo;s slightly inconvenient for you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thinking about how inconvenient it is for a hacker</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;re just gonna move on to the next person.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, in theory, when implemented extremely well.</p>
<p>But I just don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think actually if it&rsquo;s inconvenient,</p>
<p>it shows that system hasn&rsquo;t been thought through a lot.</p>
<p>Do you know why we need two-factor authentication?</p>
<p>People using the same password across the same site.</p>
<p>So when one site is compromised,</p>
<p>people just take that username and password,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called credential stuffing</p>
<p>and just stuff it across the internet.</p>
<p>So if 10 years ago when we told everybody,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use the same fucking password across the internet,</p>
<p>across vulnerable sites,</p>
<p>maybe two-factor wouldn&rsquo;t be needed.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you wouldn&rsquo;t need two-factor</p>
<p>if everyone did a good job with passwords.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, but I&rsquo;m saying like the two-factor authentication,</p>
<p>it should be super easy to authenticate myself</p>
<p>with some other device really quickly.</p>
<p>Like it should be frictionless.</p>
<p>Like you just hit okay?</p>
<p>Okay, and anything that belongs to me, yeah.</p>
<p>And it should, very importantly,</p>
<p>be easy to set up what belongs to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the full complexity</p>
<p>of the cyber attacks these platforms are under.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably under insane amount of attacks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got it right there.</p>
<p>People have no idea, these large companies,</p>
<p>how often they&rsquo;re attacked on a per second basis.</p>
<p>And they have to fight all that off</p>
<p>and pick out the good traffic in there.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;d wanna run a large tech company.</p>
<p>Well, what about protecting individuals?</p>
<p>For individuals, what&rsquo;s good advice</p>
<p>for to try to protect yourself</p>
<p>from this increasingly dangerous world of cyber attacks?</p>
<p>Again, educate yourself that you understand</p>
<p>that there is a threat.</p>
<p>First, you have to realize that.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re gonna step up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna do stuff a little bit more.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I guess, I think I take that</p>
<p>to a little bit extreme.</p>
<p>I remember one time my mom called me</p>
<p>and she was screaming that I woke up this morning</p>
<p>and I just clicked on a link</p>
<p>and now my phone is making weird noises.</p>
<p>And I was like, throw your phone in a glass of water.</p>
<p>Just put it in a glass of water right now.</p>
<p>And I made my mom cry.</p>
<p>It was not a pleasant thing.</p>
<p>So sometimes I go to a little extremes on those ones.</p>
<p>But understanding there&rsquo;s a risk</p>
<p>and making it a little bit more difficult</p>
<p>to become a victim.</p>
<p>I mean, just understanding certain things.</p>
<p>Simple things like, as we add more internet of the things</p>
<p>to people&rsquo;s houses, I mean,</p>
<p>how many Wi-Fi networks do people have?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normally just one.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re bumping your phones</p>
<p>and giving your password to people who come to visit.</p>
<p>Set up a guest network.</p>
<p>Set up something you can change every 30 days.</p>
<p>Simple little things like that.</p>
<p>I hate to remind you, but change your passwords.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like I&rsquo;m a broken record again.</p>
<p>But just make it more difficult for others to victimize you.</p>
<p>And then don&rsquo;t use the same password everywhere.</p>
<p>That, yes.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>I still know people that do that.</p>
<p>I mean, ask.fm got popped last week, two weeks ago.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s 350 million username and passwords</p>
<p>with connected Twitter accounts, Google accounts,</p>
<p>all the different social media accounts.</p>
<p>That is a treasure trove for the next two and a half,</p>
<p>three years of just using those credentials everywhere.</p>
<p>Using, you&rsquo;ll learn, even if it&rsquo;s not the right password,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll learn people&rsquo;s password styles.</p>
<p>Bad guys are making portfolios out of people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re figuring out how people generate their passwords</p>
<p>and kind of figuring,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s easier to crack their password.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re making a dossier on each person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 350 million dossiers just in that one hack.</p>
<p>Yahoo, there was half a billion.</p>
<p>So the thing a hacker would do with that</p>
<p>is try to find all the low-hanging fruit,</p>
<p>like have some kind of program that,</p>
<p>yeah, evaluates the strength of the passwords,</p>
<p>and then finds the weak ones.</p>
<p>And that means that this person</p>
<p>is probably the kind of person</p>
<p>that would use the same password across multiple.</p>
<p>Or even just write a program and do that.</p>
<p>Remember the Ring hack a couple of years ago?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it was, it was credential stuffing.</p>
<p>So Ring, the security system by default,</p>
<p>had two-factor, but didn&rsquo;t turn it on.</p>
<p>And they also had a don&rsquo;t try unlimited tries</p>
<p>to log into my account.</p>
<p>You can lock it out after 10.</p>
<p>By default, not turned on,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not convenient for people.</p>
<p>Ring was like, I want people to stick these little things up</p>
<p>and have security in their house,</p>
<p>but cybersecurity, don&rsquo;t make it inconvenient,</p>
<p>then people won&rsquo;t buy our product.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they got hacked.</p>
<p>They wanted to say that it&rsquo;s insecure</p>
<p>and got hacked into,</p>
<p>reputational harm right there for Ring,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t, it was just credential stuffing.</p>
<p>People bought username and passwords on the black market</p>
<p>and just wrote a bot that just went through Ring</p>
<p>and used every one of them to maybe 1% hit,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a big hit to the number of Ring users.</p>
<p>You know, you can use also password managers</p>
<p>to make the changing of the passwords easier.</p>
<p>And to make, you can charge the difficulty,</p>
<p>the number of special characters,</p>
<p>the length of it and all that.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is on websites,</p>
<p>yell at you for your password being too long</p>
<p>or having too many special characters,</p>
<p>or like, yeah, you&rsquo;re not allowed to have</p>
<p>this special character or something.</p>
<p>You can only use these three special characters.</p>
<p>Do you understand how password cracking works?</p>
<p>If you specifically tell me which password,</p>
<p>which special characters I can use?</p>
<p>I honestly just want to have a one-on-one meeting,</p>
<p>like late at night with the engineer that programmed that,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s like an intern.</p>
<p>I just want to have a sit-down meeting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I made my parents switch banks once</p>
<p>because the security was so poor.</p>
<p>I was like, you can&rsquo;t have money here.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also like the zero-day attacks,</p>
<p>like I mentioned before the QNAP NAS that got hacked.</p>
<p>Luckily, I didn&rsquo;t have anything private on there,</p>
<p>but it really woke me up to like, okay,</p>
<p>so like, you have to take everything extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the end users,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about zero-day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, you have no control over that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the engineers that made the software</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know about it.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about one days.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a patch now out there for the security.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not updating your systems</p>
<p>for these security patches, if it&rsquo;s just not on you,</p>
<p>my father-in-law has such an old iPhone,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t security patch it anymore.</p>
<p>So, and I tell him, I said,</p>
<p>this is what you&rsquo;re missing out on.</p>
<p>This is what you&rsquo;re exposing yourself to,</p>
<p>because, you know, we talked about that powerful tool</p>
<p>that how we found Ross Ulbrich at gmail.com.</p>
<p>Well, bad guys are using that too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called, you know,</p>
<p>it used to be called Google dorking.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s named kind of Google hacking</p>
<p>by the community.</p>
<p>You can go in, you know, and find a vulnerability,</p>
<p>read about the white paper,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with that software.</p>
<p>And then you can go on the internet</p>
<p>and find all of the computers</p>
<p>that are running that outdated software.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s your list, there&rsquo;s your target list.</p>
<p>I know the vulnerabilities that are running.</p>
<p>Again, not making a playbook here,</p>
<p>but, you know, that&rsquo;s how easy it is to find your targets.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the bad guys are doing.</p>
<p>Then the reverse is tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much tougher, but it&rsquo;s still doable,</p>
<p>which is like first find the target.</p>
<p>If you have specific targets to, you know,</p>
<p>hack into a Twitter account, for example.</p>
<p>Much harder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably social engineering, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the best way.</p>
<p>Probably, if you wanted something specific to that.</p>
<p>I mean, if you really want to go far, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re targeting a specific person, you know,</p>
<p>how hard is it to get into their office</p>
<p>and put a, you know, a little device,</p>
<p>USB device in line with their mouse,</p>
<p>who checks how their mouse is plugged in.</p>
<p>And you can, for 40 bucks on the black market,</p>
<p>you can buy a key logger that just USB,</p>
<p>then the mouse plugs right into it.</p>
<p>It looks like an extension on the mouse,</p>
<p>if you can even find it.</p>
<p>You can buy the stuff with a mouse inside of it</p>
<p>and just plug it into somebody&rsquo;s computer.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a key logger that lives in there</p>
<p>and calls home, sends everything you want.</p>
<p>So, I mean, and it&rsquo;s cheap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In grad school, a program that built a bunch of key loggers,</p>
<p>it was fascinating, a tracking mouse,</p>
<p>just for what I was doing as part of the research,</p>
<p>I was doing to see if by the dynamics of how you type</p>
<p>and how you move the mouse, you can tell who the person is.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s called the active authentication,</p>
<p>or like, it&rsquo;s basically biometrics</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not using bio to see how identifiable that is.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s fascinating to study that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also fascinating how damn easy it is</p>
<p>to install key loggers.</p>
<p>So, I think it&rsquo;s natural, what happens is you realize</p>
<p>how many vulnerabilities there are in this world.</p>
<p>You do that when you understand bacteria and viruses,</p>
<p>you realize they&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>In the same way with, I&rsquo;m talking about biological ones,</p>
<p>and then you realize that all the vulnerabilities</p>
<p>that are out there.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve noticed quite a lot</p>
<p>is how many people don&rsquo;t log out of their computers.</p>
<p>Just how easy physical access to systems actually is.</p>
<p>Like, in a lot of places in this world,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not talking about private homes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about companies, especially large companies.</p>
<p>It seems quite trivial in certain places that I&rsquo;ve been to,</p>
<p>to walk in and have physical access to a system,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s depressing to me.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It just, I laugh because one of my partners at Naxo</p>
<p>that I work at now,</p>
<p>he worked at a big company.</p>
<p>Like, you would know the name as soon as I told you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say it.</p>
<p>But the guy who owned the company,</p>
<p>and the company has his name on it,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to ever log into a computer.</p>
<p>It just annoyed the shit out of him.</p>
<p>So, they hired a person that stands next to his computer</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s not there, and that&rsquo;s his physical security.</p>
<p>You see, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I guess if you could afford to do that.</p>
<p>At least you&rsquo;re taking your security seriously.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of people in that case</p>
<p>would just not have a login.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, the security team there had to really work around</p>
<p>to make that work.</p>
<p>Non-compliant with company policy.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>The key log, there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a lot of threats.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to get in.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so you can&rsquo;t sit around</p>
<p>and worry about someone physically gaining access</p>
<p>to your computer with key log and stuff like that.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re traveling to a foreign country</p>
<p>and you work for the FBI, then yeah, you do.</p>
<p>You pick little, you know, sometimes some countries</p>
<p>you would bring a fake laptop</p>
<p>just to see if they stole it or accessed it.</p>
<p>I really want, especially in this modern day,</p>
<p>to just create a lot of clones of myself</p>
<p>that generate Lex sounding things</p>
<p>and just put so much information out there.</p>
<p>I actually dox myself all across the world.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re not a target, I guess.</p>
<p>Just put it out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said that, though.</p>
<p>We do these searches in FBI houses and stuff like that.</p>
<p>If someone just got like a box load</p>
<p>of like 10 terabyte drives and just encrypted them,</p>
<p>oh my God, do you know how long the FBI</p>
<p>would spin their wheels trying to get that data out there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be insane.</p>
<p>Oh, so just give them-</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even know which one you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like me printing like a treasure map</p>
<p>to a random location, just get people to go on goose chases.</p>
<p>Yeah, what about operating system?</p>
<p>What have you found, what&rsquo;s the most secure</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the least secure operating system?</p>
<p>Windows, Linux, is there no universal?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no universal security.</p>
<p>I mean, it changed.</p>
<p>People used to think Macs were the most secure</p>
<p>just because they just weren&rsquo;t out there,</p>
<p>but now kids have had access to them.</p>
<p>So I know you&rsquo;re a Linux guy, I like Linux too,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s tough to run a business on Linux.</p>
<p>People want to move more towards the Microsofts</p>
<p>and the Googles just because it&rsquo;s easier to communicate</p>
<p>with other people that maybe aren&rsquo;t computer guys.</p>
<p>So you have to just take what&rsquo;s best, what&rsquo;s easiest</p>
<p>and secure the shit out of it as much as you can</p>
<p>and just think about it.</p>
<p>What are you doing these days at Nexo?</p>
<p>So we just started Nexo.</p>
<p>So I left the government and went to a couple consultancies</p>
<p>and I started working, really all the people</p>
<p>I worked good in the government with,</p>
<p>I brought them out with me.</p>
<p>You used to work for the man and now you&rsquo;re the man.</p>
<p>Exactly, but now we formed a partnership</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a new cybersecurity firm.</p>
<p>Our launch party is actually on Thursday,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s going to be exciting.</p>
<p>Do you want to give more details about the party</p>
<p>so that somebody can hack into it?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to tell you where it is.</p>
<p>You can come if you want, but don&rsquo;t bring the hackers.</p>
<p>So Hector will be there with us.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you invited me</p>
<p>because you also say insider threat is the biggest threat.</p>
<p>By the way, can you explain what the insider threat is?</p>
<p>The biggest insider threat in my life is my children.</p>
<p>My son&rsquo;s big into Minecraft</p>
<p>and will download executables mindlessly</p>
<p>and just run them on the network.</p>
<p>So he is-</p>
<p>Do you recommend against marriage and family and kids?</p>
<p>Nope, nope.</p>
<p>From a security perspective.</p>
<p>From a security perspective, absolutely.</p>
<p>But no, I just segmentation.</p>
<p>I mean, we do it in all businesses for years.</p>
<p>Started segmenting networks, different networks.</p>
<p>I just do it at home.</p>
<p>My kid&rsquo;s on his own network.</p>
<p>It makes it a little bit easier</p>
<p>to see what they&rsquo;re doing too.</p>
<p>You can monitor traffic and then also throttle bandwidth</p>
<p>if your Netflix isn&rsquo;t playing fast enough</p>
<p>or buffers or something.</p>
<p>So you can obviously change that a little too.</p>
<p>You know they&rsquo;re going to listen to this, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to get your tricks.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;ll definitely will listen.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing more humbling than your family.</p>
<p>You think you&rsquo;ve done something big</p>
<p>and you go on a big podcast and talk to Les Freeman.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t fucking care.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re on TikTok or shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll show up on a YouTube feed or something like that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be like, oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Whatever, this guy&rsquo;s boring.</p>
<p>My son does a podcast for his school</p>
<p>and I still can&rsquo;t get him to tell.</p>
<p>So Hector and I just started a podcast</p>
<p>talking about cybersecurity.</p>
<p>We do a podcast called Hacker in the Fed.</p>
<p>It just came out yesterday, so first episode.</p>
<p>So yeah, we got 1,300 downloads the first day.</p>
<p>We were at the top of Hacker News,</p>
<p>which is a big website in our world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s called Hacker in the Fed?</p>
<p>Hacker in the Fed&rsquo;s the name of it, so.</p>
<p>Go download and listen to Hacker in the Fed.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen a video of you two together.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t wait to see what the chemistry is like.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not weird that you guys used to be enemies</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re friends?</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, we just did a trailer and all that.</p>
<p>And our producer, we have a great producer guy named Phineas</p>
<p>and he kind of pulls things out of me.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, I got one.</p>
<p>My relationship with Hector,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very close friends now.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, I arrested one of my closest friends,</p>
<p>which is a very strange relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>But he says that I changed his life.</p>
<p>I mean, he was going down a very dark path</p>
<p>and I gave him an option that one night</p>
<p>and he made the right choice.</p>
<p>I mean, he now does penetration testing.</p>
<p>He does a lot of good work and he&rsquo;s turned his life around.</p>
<p>Do you worry about cyber war in the 21st century?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>If there is a global war, it&rsquo;ll start with cyber,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not already started.</p>
<p>Do you feel like there&rsquo;s a boiling,</p>
<p>like the drums of war are beating?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening in Ukraine with Russia?</p>
<p>It feels like the United States</p>
<p>becoming more and more involved</p>
<p>in the conflict in that part of the world.</p>
<p>And China is watching very closely,</p>
<p>is starting to get involved geopolitically</p>
<p>and probably in terms of cyber.</p>
<p>Do you worry about this kind of thing</p>
<p>happening in the next decade or two,</p>
<p>like where it really escalates?</p>
<p>You know, people in the 1920s were completely terrible</p>
<p>at predicting the World War II.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re at the precipice of war potentially?</p>
<p>I think we could be.</p>
<p>I mean, I would hate to just be, you know,</p>
<p>just fear mongering out there, you know, COVID&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>So the next big thing in the media is war and all that.</p>
<p>But I mean, there&rsquo;s some flags going up</p>
<p>that are very strange to me.</p>
<p>Is there ways to avoid this?</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I hope smarter people than I are figuring it out.</p>
<p>I hope people are playing their parts</p>
<p>in talking to the right people</p>
<p>because war is the last thing I want.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s two things to be concerned about</p>
<p>on the cyber side.</p>
<p>One is the actual defense on the technical side of cyber.</p>
<p>And the other one is the panic that might happen</p>
<p>when something like some dramatic event happened</p>
<p>because of cyber, some major hack that becomes public.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly more concerned about the panic</p>
<p>because I feel like if people don&rsquo;t think about this stuff,</p>
<p>the panic can hit harder.</p>
<p>Like if they&rsquo;re not conscious about the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re constantly under attack,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;ll come like a much harder surprise.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think people will be really shocked on things.</p>
<p>I mean, so we talked about LulzSec today</p>
<p>and LulzSec was 2011.</p>
<p>They had access into the water supply system</p>
<p>of a major US city.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do anything with it.</p>
<p>They were sitting on it in case someone got arrested</p>
<p>and they were gonna maybe just expose that it&rsquo;s insecure.</p>
<p>Maybe they were gonna do something to fuck with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s 2011.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gotten a lot better since then.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably nation states or major organizations</p>
<p>that are sitting secretly on hacks like this.</p>
<p>100%, 100% they are sitting secretly</p>
<p>waiting to expose things.</p>
<p>I mean, again, I don&rsquo;t wanna scare the shit out of people,</p>
<p>but people have to understand the cyber threat.</p>
<p>I mean, there are thousands of nation state hackers</p>
<p>in some countries.</p>
<p>I mean, we have them too.</p>
<p>We have offensive hackers.</p>
<p>You know, the terrorist attacks of 9-11,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s planes that actually hit actual buildings</p>
<p>and it was visibly clear and you can trace the information.</p>
<p>With cyber attacks, say something that would result</p>
<p>in a major explosion in New York City,</p>
<p>how the hell do you trace that?</p>
<p>Like, if it&rsquo;s well done,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be extremely difficult.</p>
<p>The problem is, there&rsquo;s so many problems.</p>
<p>One of which the US government in that case</p>
<p>has complete freedom to blame anybody they want.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>And then to go start war with anybody.</p>
<p>Anybody that actually see,</p>
<p>all right, that&rsquo;s, sorry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one cynical take on it, of course.</p>
<p>No, but you&rsquo;re going down the right path.</p>
<p>I mean, the guys that flew the planes in the buildings</p>
<p>wanted attribution.</p>
<p>They took credit for it.</p>
<p>When we see the cyber attack,</p>
<p>I doubt we&rsquo;re gonna see attribution.</p>
<p>Maybe the victim side, the US government on this side</p>
<p>might come out and try to blame somebody.</p>
<p>But, you know, like you&rsquo;ve brought up,</p>
<p>they could blame anybody they want.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not really a good way of verifying that.</p>
<p>Can I just ask for your advice?</p>
<p>So in my personal case, am I being tracked?</p>
<p>How do I know?</p>
<p>How do I protect myself?</p>
<p>Should I care?</p>
<p>You are being tracked.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re being tracked by the government.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re definitely being tracked by big tech.</p>
<p>No, I mean, me personally, Lex,</p>
<p>and an escalated level.</p>
<p>So like,</p>
<p>like you mentioned, there&rsquo;s an FBI file on people.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see what&rsquo;s in that file.</p>
<p>Who did I have the argument for?</p>
<p>Oh, let me ask you, FBI.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s the cafeteria food in FBI?</p>
<p>At the Academy, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about like?</p>
<p>At headquarters?</p>
<p>Headquarters.</p>
<p>A little bit better,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where the director,</p>
<p>I mean, he eats up on the seventh floor.</p>
<p>Have you been like at Google?</p>
<p>Have you been at the Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>those cafeterias, like those?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to the Google in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to the Google in New York.</p>
<p>Yeah, the food is incredible.</p>
<p>It is great.</p>
<p>So FBI is worse.</p>
<p>Well, when you&rsquo;re going through the Academy,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t let you outside of the building,</p>
<p>so you have to eat it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the only reason people eat it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty bad.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a bar inside the FBI Academy.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Alcohol bar?</p>
<p>Yes, alcohol bar.</p>
<p>And if you, as long as you&rsquo;ve passed your PT</p>
<p>and going well, you&rsquo;re allowed to go to the bar.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>It feels like if I was a hacker,</p>
<p>I would be going after like celebrities</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re a little bit easier,</p>
<p>like celebrity celebrities, like Hollywood.</p>
<p>Well, Hollywood nudes were a big thing there</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>But not even, yeah, I guess nudes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they went after.</p>
<p>I mean, all those guys, they socialized.</p>
<p>They social engineered Apple to get backups,</p>
<p>to get the recoveries for backups.</p>
<p>And then they just pulled all their nudes.</p>
<p>And I mean, whole websites were dedicated to that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See that?</p>
<p>See, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very creepy.</p>
<p>I would go, if I was a hacker,</p>
<p>I would go after like major, like powerful people</p>
<p>and like tweet something from their account</p>
<p>and like something that, like positive, like loving.</p>
<p>But like for the walls, the obvious that it&rsquo;s a troll.</p>
<p>God, you get busted so quick.</p>
<p>By a bad hacker.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Because hackers never put things out about love.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean like, this is clearly.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is clearly Lex.</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>He talks about love in every podcast he does.</p>
<p>I would just be like, no.</p>
<p>Oh, God damn it.</p>
<p>Now somebody&rsquo;s gonna do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll blame me.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>Looking back at your life, is there something you regret?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only 44 years old.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already looking back.</p>
<p>Is there stuff that you regret?</p>
<p>EV unit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I got away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the one that got away.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it took me a while</p>
<p>into my law enforcement career</p>
<p>to learn about like the compassionate side.</p>
<p>And it took Hector Monsegur to make me realize</p>
<p>that criminals aren&rsquo;t really criminals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re human beings.</p>
<p>That really humanized the whole thing for me,</p>
<p>sitting with him for nine months.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s maybe why I had a lot more compassion</p>
<p>when I arrested Ross.</p>
<p>Probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been so compassionate</p>
<p>if it was before Hector.</p>
<p>But yeah, he changed my life</p>
<p>and showed me that humanity side of things.</p>
<p>So would it be fair to say that all the criminals</p>
<p>or most criminals are just people</p>
<p>that took a wrong turn at some point?</p>
<p>They all have the capacity for good and for evil in them?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say 99% of the criminals that I&rsquo;ve interacted with,</p>
<p>yes, the people with the child exploitation,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t have any place in my heart for them.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to people in college,</p>
<p>people in high school,</p>
<p>trying to figure out what they want to do with their life,</p>
<p>how to have a life they can be proud of,</p>
<p>how to have a career they can be proud of,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>In the US budget that was just put forward,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s $18 billion for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about a million people short</p>
<p>of where we really should be in the industry, if not more.</p>
<p>If you want job security and want to work</p>
<p>and see exciting stuff, head towards cybersecurity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good career.</p>
<p>And one thing I dislike about cybersecurity right now</p>
<p>is they expect you to come out of college</p>
<p>and have 10 years experience in protecting</p>
<p>and knowing every different Python script out there</p>
<p>and everything available.</p>
<p>The industry needs to change and let the lower people in</p>
<p>in order to broaden and get those billion jobs filled.</p>
<p>But as far as their personal security,</p>
<p>just remember, it&rsquo;s all gonna follow you.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s laws out there now</p>
<p>where you have to turn over your social media accounts</p>
<p>in order to have certain things.</p>
<p>They just changed that in New York state.</p>
<p>If you want to carry a gun,</p>
<p>you have to turn over your social media</p>
<p>to figure if you&rsquo;re a good social character.</p>
<p>So hopefully you didn&rsquo;t say something strange</p>
<p>in the last few years and it&rsquo;s gonna follow you forever.</p>
<p>I bet Ross Albrecht would tell you the same thing.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put rossalbrecht at gmail.com on things</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna last forever.</p>
<p>Yeah, people sometimes, for some reason,</p>
<p>they interact on social media</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re talking to a couple of buddies,</p>
<p>like just shooting shit and mocking</p>
<p>and like, you know, what is that?</p>
<p>Busting each other&rsquo;s chops,</p>
<p>like making fun of yourself,</p>
<p>like being, especially gaming culture,</p>
<p>like people who stream.</p>
<p>Thank God that&rsquo;s not recorded.</p>
<p>Oh my God, the things people say on those streams.</p>
<p>Yeah, but a lot of them are recorded.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole Twitch thing</p>
<p>where people stream for many hours a day.</p>
<p>And I mean, just outside of the very offensive things</p>
<p>they say, they just swear a lot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the kind of person that I would wanna hire,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna work with.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that some of us might be</p>
<p>that way privately, I guess,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re shooting shit with friends,</p>
<p>like playing a video game</p>
<p>and talking shit to each other, maybe.</p>
<p>But like, that&rsquo;s all out there.</p>
<p>You have to be conscious of the fact</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s all out there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just not, it&rsquo;s not a good look.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re, you should,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s complicated,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like against hiding who you are.</p>
<p>Oh, if you&rsquo;re an asshole, you should hide some of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but like, I just feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>When you talk shit to your friends</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re playing video games,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re an asshole,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re an asshole to your friend,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s how a lot of friends show love.</p>
<p>Yeah, an outside person can&rsquo;t judge</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;m friends with you.</p>
<p>But if I wanna be, this is our relationship.</p>
<p>If that person can say that I&rsquo;m an asshole to them,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;m an asshole to them</p>
<p>just because you saw my interaction.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll take those words out of context,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s considered who you are is dangerous.</p>
<p>And people take that very nonchalantly.</p>
<p>People treat their behavior on the internet</p>
<p>very, very carelessly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely something that you need to learn</p>
<p>and take extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Also, I think that taking that seriously</p>
<p>will help you figure out what you really stand for.</p>
<p>If you use your language carelessly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d never really ask, what do I stand for?</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s a good opportunity when you&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>to ask, what are the things that are okay to say?</p>
<p>What are the things, what are the ideas I stand behind?</p>
<p>Especially if they&rsquo;re controversial,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m willing to say them because I believe in them,</p>
<p>versus just saying random shit for the lulz.</p>
<p>Because for the random shit for the lulz,</p>
<p>keep that off the internet.</p>
<p>That said, man, I was an idiot for most of my life,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m constantly learning and growing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hate to be responsible for the kind of person</p>
<p>I was in my teens, in my 20s.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do anything offensive,</p>
<p>but it just changed as a person.</p>
<p>I used to, I guess I probably still do,</p>
<p>but I used to read so much existential literature.</p>
<p>That was a phase.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s phases.</p>
<p>Yeah, you grow and evolve as a person.</p>
<p>That changes you in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank God there wasn&rsquo;t social media</p>
<p>when I was in high school.</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I would never have gotten the FBI.</p>
<p>Would you recommend that people consider a career</p>
<p>at a place like the FBI?</p>
<p>I loved the FBI.</p>
<p>I never thought I would go anyplace else but the FBI.</p>
<p>I thought I was gonna retire with the gold watch</p>
<p>and everything from the FBI.</p>
<p>That was my plan.</p>
<p>You get a gold watch?</p>
<p>No, but you know what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, oh, it&rsquo;s an expression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s colonialism.</p>
<p>You get a gold badge.</p>
<p>You actually get your badge in Lucite,</p>
<p>and your creds, they put it in Lucite and all that.</p>
<p>Does it, by the way, just on a tangent,</p>
<p>since we like those,</p>
<p>does it hurt you that the FBI,</p>
<p>by certain people, is distrusted or even hated?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>It kills me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never, until recently,</p>
<p>sometimes be embarrassed about the FBI sometimes,</p>
<p>which is really, really hard for me to say</p>
<p>because I love that place.</p>
<p>I love the people in it.</p>
<p>I love the brotherhood that you have</p>
<p>with all the guys in your squad,</p>
<p>guys and girls.</p>
<p>I just use guys.</p>
<p>I developed a real drinking problem there</p>
<p>because we were so social of going out after work</p>
<p>and continuing on.</p>
<p>It really was a family.</p>
<p>So I do miss that.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, if someone can become an FBI agent,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty fucking cool, man.</p>
<p>The day you graduate and walk out of the academy</p>
<p>with a gun and a badge,</p>
<p>and the power to charge someone with a misdemeanor</p>
<p>for flying on the United States flag at night,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So there is a part of representing and loving your country,</p>
<p>and especially if you&rsquo;re doing cybersecurity.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of technical savvy</p>
<p>in different places in the FBI.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s different pieces.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll see an older agent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s done not cyber crime</p>
<p>come over to cyber crime at the end</p>
<p>so he can get a job once he goes out.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also some guys that come in.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t name his name, but there was a guy,</p>
<p>I think he was a hacker when he was a kid,</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s been an agent.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s way up in management.</p>
<p>Great guy.</p>
<p>I love this guy, and he knows who he is if he&rsquo;s listening.</p>
<p>He had some skills.</p>
<p>But we also lost a bunch of guys that had some skills</p>
<p>because we had one guy in the squad</p>
<p>that he had to leave the FBI</p>
<p>because his wife became a doctor</p>
<p>and she got a residency down in Houston</p>
<p>and she couldn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t allowed to transfer,</p>
<p>so he decided to keep his family versus the FBI.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some stringent rules in the FBI</p>
<p>that need to be relaxed a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love hackers turned leaders.</p>
<p>Like one of my quickly becoming good friends</p>
<p>was Mudge, he was a big hack in the 90s</p>
<p>and then now was recently Twitter chief security officer,</p>
<p>CSO, but he had a bunch of different leadership positions,</p>
<p>including being my boss at Google.</p>
<p>But originally a hacker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool to see hackers become leaders.</p>
<p>I just wonder what would cause him to stop doing it.</p>
<p>Why he would then take a managerial route,</p>
<p>for high tech companies versus-</p>
<p>I think a lot of those guys, so this is like the 90s,</p>
<p>they really were about the freedom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a philosophy to it.</p>
<p>And when I think the hacking culture evolved over the years,</p>
<p>and I think when it leaves you behind,</p>
<p>you start to realize like, oh,</p>
<p>actually what I wanna do is I wanna help the world</p>
<p>and I can do that in legitimate routes and so on.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the story that,</p>
<p>and yeah, I would love to talk to him one day.</p>
<p>But I wonder how common that is too,</p>
<p>like young hackers turn good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it like pulls you in.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not careful, it can really pull you in.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re good at it, you become powerful,</p>
<p>you become, everyone&rsquo;s slapping you on the back</p>
<p>and say, what a good job and all that at a very young age.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, I would love to get into my buddy&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>on why he stopped hacking and moved on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be a good conversation.</p>
<p>In his case, maybe it&rsquo;s always about a great woman involved,</p>
<p>a family and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That grounds you.</p>
<p>Because like we have, there is a danger to hacking</p>
<p>that once you&rsquo;re in a relationship, once you have family,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re not willing to partake in.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your story?</p>
<p>What, from childhood, what are some fond memories you have?</p>
<p>Fond memories?</p>
<p>Where did you grow up?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t give away that information.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, in Virginia.</p>
<p>In Virginia.</p>
<p>What are some rough moments?</p>
<p>What are some beautiful moments that you remember?</p>
<p>I had a very good family growing up.</p>
<p>The rough moment, and I&rsquo;ll tell you a story</p>
<p>that just happened to me two days ago</p>
<p>and it fucked me up, man, it really did.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll be the first, I&rsquo;ve never told,</p>
<p>I tried to tell my wife this two nights ago</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t get it out.</p>
<p>So my father, he&rsquo;s a disabled veteran,</p>
<p>he was a disabled veteran.</p>
<p>He was in the army and got hurt</p>
<p>and was in a wheelchair his whole life,</p>
<p>for all my growing up.</p>
<p>He was my biggest fan.</p>
<p>He just wanted to know everything about</p>
<p>what was going on in the FBI, my stories.</p>
<p>I was a local cop before the FBI</p>
<p>and I got into a high-speed car chase,</p>
<p>foot chase and all that and kicking doors in.</p>
<p>He wanted to hear the stories</p>
<p>and at some points I was kind of too cool for school</p>
<p>and, ah, dad, I just want a break and all that</p>
<p>and things going on.</p>
<p>We lost my dad during COVID, not because of COVID,</p>
<p>but it was around that time,</p>
<p>but it was right when COVID was kicking off.</p>
<p>And so he died in the hospital by himself</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t get to see him then.</p>
<p>And then my mom had some people visiting her</p>
<p>the other night, Tom and Karen Roggeberg,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll say they&rsquo;re my second biggest fans,</p>
<p>right behind my dad.</p>
<p>They always asking about me and my career</p>
<p>and they read the books and seen the movie.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll even tell you that Silk Road movie was good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll hide you on that.</p>
<p>And so they came over and I helped them with something</p>
<p>and my mom called me back a couple of days later</p>
<p>and she said, I appreciate you helping them.</p>
<p>I know fixing someone&rsquo;s Apple phone over the phone</p>
<p>really isn&rsquo;t what you do for a living.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of beneath you and all that, but I appreciate it.</p>
<p>And she said, oh, they loved hearing the stories</p>
<p>about Silk Road and all those things.</p>
<p>And she goes, your dad, he loved those stories.</p>
<p>I just wish he could have heard them.</p>
<p>He even would tell me, he would say,</p>
<p>maybe Chris will come home and I&rsquo;ll get him drunk</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll tell me the stories.</p>
<p>But, and then she goes, maybe one day in heaven</p>
<p>you can tell them those stories.</p>
<p>And I fucking lost it.</p>
<p>I literally stood in my shower sobbing like a child.</p>
<p>Just thinking about all my dad wanted was those stories.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m on a fucking podcast</p>
<p>telling the stories to the world and I didn&rsquo;t tell him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you ever have a long heart to heart with him</p>
<p>about such stories?</p>
<p>He was in the hospital one time and I went through</p>
<p>and I wanna know about his history, his life, what he did.</p>
<p>And I think he maybe sensationalized some of it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what you want.</p>
<p>Your dad&rsquo;s your hero.</p>
<p>So you wanna hear those things.</p>
<p>Is he a good storyteller?</p>
<p>Yeah, again, I don&rsquo;t know what was true and not true,</p>
<p>but some of it was really good.</p>
<p>And it was just good to hear his life,</p>
<p>but we lost him and now those stories are gone.</p>
<p>You miss him?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What did he teach you about what it means to be a man?</p>
<p>So my dad, he was an engineer.</p>
<p>And so part of his job,</p>
<p>we worked for Vermont Power and Electric or whatever it was.</p>
<p>I mean, when he first got married to my mom and all that,</p>
<p>like he flew around in a helicopter</p>
<p>checking out like power lines and dams.</p>
<p>He used to swim inside to scuba into dams</p>
<p>to check to make sure they were functioning properly</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty cool shit.</p>
<p>And then he couldn&rsquo;t walk anymore.</p>
<p>I probably would have killed myself</p>
<p>if my life switched like that so bad.</p>
<p>And my dad probably went through some dark points,</p>
<p>but he had that from me, maybe.</p>
<p>And so to get through that struggle,</p>
<p>to teach me like, you press on, you have a family,</p>
<p>people count on you, you do what you gotta do.</p>
<p>That was big.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you make him proud, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I do, but I don&rsquo;t think he knew that,</p>
<p>that I knew that.</p>
<p>Well, you get to pass on that love to your kids now.</p>
<p>I try, I try, but I can&rsquo;t impress them</p>
<p>as much as my dad impressed me.</p>
<p>I can try all I want, but.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think is the role of love?</p>
<p>Because you gave me some grief,</p>
<p>you busted my balls a little bit</p>
<p>for talking about love a lot.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of love</p>
<p>in the human condition?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the greatest thing.</p>
<p>I think everyone should be searching for it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have it, find it, get it as soon as you can.</p>
<p>I love my wife, I really do.</p>
<p>I had no idea what love was until my kids were born.</p>
<p>My son came out and, this is a funny story,</p>
<p>he came out and I just wanted him to be safe</p>
<p>and be healthy and all that.</p>
<p>And I said to the doctor, I said,</p>
<p>10 and 10, doc, 10 fingers, 10 toes, everything good.</p>
<p>And he goes, eh, nine and nine.</p>
<p>I was like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh, this is gonna suck.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ll deal with it and all that.</p>
<p>He was talking about the apnea cord</p>
<p>or some score about breathing and color and all that.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, shit.</p>
<p>But no one told me this.</p>
<p>But so I&rsquo;m just sobbing.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t even cut the umbilical cord.</p>
<p>Just fell in love with my kids when I saw them.</p>
<p>And that to me really is what love is,</p>
<p>just for them, man.</p>
<p>And I see that through your career,</p>
<p>that love developed, which is awesome.</p>
<p>Being able to see the humanity in people.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t when I was young.</p>
<p>The foolishness of youth.</p>
<p>I needed to learn that lesson hard.</p>
<p>I mean, when I was young in my career,</p>
<p>it was just about career goals</p>
<p>and arresting people became stats.</p>
<p>You arrest someone, you get a good stat,</p>
<p>you get an atta boy.</p>
<p>Maybe the boss likes it and you get a better job</p>
<p>or you move up the chain.</p>
<p>It took a real change in my life to see that humanity.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t wait to listen to you talk,</p>
<p>which is probably hilarious and insightful</p>
<p>given the life of the two you lived</p>
<p>and given how much you&rsquo;ve changed each other&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to listen, brother.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>This is a huge honor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an amazing person with an amazing life.</p>
<p>This was an awesome conversation.</p>
<p>Dude, huge fan.</p>
<p>I love the podcast.</p>
<p>Glad I could be here.</p>
<p>Thanks for the invite.</p>
<p>So exercise in the brain too.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>It was a great conversation.</p>
<p>And the heart too, right?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You got some tears there at the end.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Chris Tarbell.</p>

<p>from Benjamin Franklin.</p>
