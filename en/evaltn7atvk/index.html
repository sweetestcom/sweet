at</p><p>cholesterol you know and what we you</p><p>know as far as a ketogenic diet goes</p><p>there&rsquo;s so many people that have</p><p>questions about all different aspects</p><p>but one we&rsquo;re gonna focus on today has</p><p>to do with what happens when your</p><p>cholesterol goes up because Dave is the</p><p>man to go to I mean I think it really</p><p>takes someone from the outside of the</p><p>now profession that has enough space</p><p>enough data on logic and systems and</p><p>looking at computers to really observe</p><p>this is these interesting phenomena so</p><p>because I think your body is very</p><p>similar to a computer it has certain</p><p>systems and feedback loops and so so I</p><p>guess the the let&rsquo;s just talk about the</p><p>the most important thing I want to bring</p><p>up can we discuss what happens when you</p><p>dookied oh you&rsquo;re doing in a minute</p><p>fasting and all of a sudden your cluster</p><p>goes up and then you start freaking out</p><p>is that a concern and let&rsquo;s talk about</p><p>that well of course I per your original</p><p>comment I like to joke that the human</p><p>body was doing cloud computing long</p><p>before we were and indeed just like a</p><p>computer it can be a bit complex so I</p><p>try not to answer you know should I be</p><p>concerned or shouldn&rsquo;t I be by a single</p><p>marker but I will say this I will say</p><p>that to this very day I&rsquo;m finding more</p><p>and more that LDL is one of the least</p><p>useful markers to look at to determine</p><p>your metabolic health and that actually</p><p>there&rsquo;s a very mechanistically sensible</p><p>reason for your LDL to climb when you</p><p>grow on a low card ketogenic diet if</p><p>you&rsquo;re being fueled by fat a lot more</p><p>and so I&rsquo;m gonna try not to get into the</p><p>weeds too much I sort of want to keep</p><p>this you know friendly for for any</p><p>audience member but one of the most</p><p>common misconceptions that does need to</p><p>get relieved is that</p><p>many people think when you&rsquo;re on a</p><p>ketogenic diet that all of the fat you</p><p>eat gets burned into or gets gets broken</p><p>down into ketones and it&rsquo;s not actually</p><p>true a fraction of the fatty acids you</p><p>ingest will get turned into get ketones</p><p>and that&rsquo;s especially important for the</p><p>brain but actually the majority of</p><p>energy your tissues are using are in the</p><p>form of fatty acids that you&rsquo;re</p><p>ingesting and that are also stored in</p><p>your fat cells in your body that are</p><p>provided directly to your cells and one</p><p>of the means by which they&rsquo;re provided</p><p>or in these kinds of boats that I know</p><p>you talked about in some of your videos</p><p>before that we like to call lipoproteins</p><p>lipid carrying proteins these these</p><p>boats are actually amazing it&rsquo;s the</p><p>genius of the human body that it makes</p><p>it because it carries all of the</p><p>different lipids these fats that include</p><p>not just what you&rsquo;re using for energy</p><p>but also include cholesterol and</p><p>cholesterol it&rsquo;s a common misconception</p><p>people think of cholesterol as being the</p><p>same as poison almost and that our body</p><p>is weirdly are making this poison to</p><p>kill us but the truth is cholesterol is</p><p>in every single cell in your body</p><p>in fact the animal kingdom couldn&rsquo;t</p><p>function without cholesterol holding the</p><p>membranes of every single one of those</p><p>cells together yeah exactly and I think</p><p>that&rsquo;s a good point just to bring up</p><p>from the very beginning um we need</p><p>cholesterol to make hormones doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>would you agree that cholesterol one of</p><p>the functions is it&rsquo;s kind of like a</p><p>protective type band-aid or protective</p><p>absolutely yeah absolutely well and</p><p>another common misconception is that the</p><p>cholesterol in your blood is deleterious</p><p>and that the lower your cholesterol the</p><p>better right as I&rsquo;m as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re</p><p>aware there are many many studies that</p><p>indicate that when people really</p><p>bottomed out on cholesterol there&rsquo;s a a</p><p>wide range of different problems that</p><p>can occur there&rsquo;s lots of issues with</p><p>cognition there are a lot of problems</p><p>with sex hormones a lot of females for</p><p>example will lose their cycle</p><p>unfortunately there there are many other</p><p>issues that can come up with for example</p><p>infection and disease a lot of people</p><p>don&rsquo;t realize that these same boats were</p><p>talking about also clear pathogens in</p><p>the body and this is why people who even</p><p>have the genetic disneys known as</p><p>familial hypercholesterolemia which is</p><p>genetically they have higher levels of</p><p>lipoproteins are known to survive</p><p>pandemics which is why it was considered</p><p>an advantage before the 20th century</p><p>because you typically had a longer</p><p>survival time when infection was a much</p><p>bigger concern not that it isn&rsquo;t a big</p><p>concern now but particularly as you get</p><p>older I mean the data is very compelling</p><p>that the higher your cholesterol the</p><p>more likely your survival and it&rsquo;s</p><p>certainly something you want to be very</p><p>mindful of before you consider taking</p><p>medication wow that&rsquo;s awesome</p><p>being an engineer let&rsquo;s compare this the</p><p>feedback loop with what happens when you</p><p>increase or decrease your dietary</p><p>cluster</p><p>on that that&rsquo;s right I call it the</p><p>inversion pattern so to be sure a lot of</p><p>people go on a ketogenic diet and kind</p><p>of unintuitive Li the more the more lean</p><p>and/or fit you are surprisingly the more</p><p>likely it is that your C or LDL</p><p>cholesterol go up and that&rsquo;s what I</p><p>found in my case my sister and my dad</p><p>had also got inspired to go on the huge</p><p>ink guide at the same time I did their</p><p>cholesterol went up just slightly mine</p><p>went up by a lot and so that&rsquo;s what got</p><p>me very inspired to try to look into</p><p>what was going on and sure enough I</p><p>found that my baseline cholesterol while</p><p>higher if I then added a lot of fat like</p><p>I ate a lot more fat it would then go</p><p>down likewise if I if I fasted or if I</p><p>just brought down the total amount of</p><p>fat I was eating it would then go back</p><p>up again and this is super important to</p><p>get out to your listeners because one of</p><p>the common problems that occur with</p><p>people who try to go on a low-carb diet</p><p>and then try to score a good cholesterol</p><p>test is that though often</p><p>bring down the amount of saturated fat</p><p>they have in the days before the test</p><p>and there&rsquo;s enormous amounts of data</p><p>that both I have demonstrated and many</p><p>of my followers that that&rsquo;ll actually</p><p>spike your total and LDL cholesterol and</p><p>it typically makes your triglycerides go</p><p>higher and your HDL go lower</p><p>that&rsquo;s the inversion pattern in inverts</p><p>and so I demonstrated in my first public</p><p>presentation of my data this inversion</p><p>pattern by going the other way</p><p>I ate a ton of fat I was in fact through</p><p>this conference that I was holding the</p><p>presentation for I had a cooler next to</p><p>me where I was just constantly grabbing</p><p>meats and cheeses and I was taking it</p><p>down and in my presentation I said</p><p>you&rsquo;re actually watching my LDL</p><p>cholesterol plummet and I&rsquo;ve bet my</p><p>entire reputation all my data on it that</p><p>when I get a blood test tomorrow it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna show that it&rsquo;s dropped</p><p>substantially in 3 days and that&rsquo;s</p><p>exactly what happened and so a lot of</p><p>people said would you do a write up for</p><p>this and kind of tell us how how we can</p><p>do this and that&rsquo;s what I did at my site</p><p>cholesterol code comm it&rsquo;s now commonly</p><p>known as the Feldman protocol I&rsquo;m Bette</p><p>many of your your listeners have done</p><p>this as well because it&rsquo;s shared all</p><p>over the place it&rsquo;s unintuitive but you</p><p>eat a lot of fat coming up to a</p><p>cholesterol test and there&rsquo;s about an 85</p><p>percent success rate for the likelihood</p><p>that you&rsquo;ll actually see your LDL go</p><p>down you know this I mean it&rsquo;s right in</p><p>guidance physiology they found that the</p><p>people that eat more cholesterol goes</p><p>because there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s this balance</p><p>mechanism the body will it make</p><p>adjustments it just produces less it</p><p>controls the excess so for those of you</p><p>that miss that cholesterol co.com in</p><p>fact I want to play this I have a closed</p><p>Facebook lab and we do kind of some</p><p>experiments here and there I want to</p><p>actually see if I can have everyone do</p><p>it we have a hundred thousand people so</p><p>oh wow and everyone to do that will get</p><p>some great data just to just you know I</p><p>think you all see you you mentioned</p><p>something about hyper responders and you</p><p>want to kind of just touch on that I do</p><p>so a hyper responder is actually a term</p><p>that predates my time</p><ul><li>the ketogenic diet and what it was was</li></ul><p>basically a way to refer to those people</p><p>when they go on a ketogenic diet see a</p><p>dramatic increase in their LDL the the</p><p>common refrain is your LDL may go up a</p><p>little and may go down a little but odds</p><p>are you&rsquo;re not one of these small</p><p>subsets of people for which a lot of</p><p>people worried I myself was one of them</p><p>when I found out I was a hyper responder</p><p>Lucy is a fifty hundred percent increase</p><p>in their LDL so my LDL before I went on</p><p>huge a diet was around 131 I think was</p><p>the last test I&rsquo;d had and it had jumped</p><p>up to 270 which any doctor is gonna say</p><p>two things one they&rsquo;re gonna say stop</p><p>doing what you&rsquo;re doing and two I have</p><p>some drugs I would like you to look at</p><p>to help get that number back down and</p><p>again I&rsquo;m an engineer I will tell you</p><p>there&rsquo;s a very big difference in the</p><p>culture between those and medicine and</p><p>those in engineering and those of us in</p><p>engineering I&rsquo;m telling you you could</p><p>you could have the biggest bigwig</p><p>engineer senior engineer walk into a</p><p>meeting with a whole bunch of juniors</p><p>and if that engineer says something</p><p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous the junior engineers</p><p>will challenge and because every</p><p>engineer starts from the assumption that</p><p>they&rsquo;re skeptical of everybody and every</p><p>piece of data they&rsquo;d like to take it</p><p>apart themselves and that&rsquo;s what I did I</p><p>started taking apart the lipid system</p><p>well that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s where I found what</p><p>seems to be a big originating factor -</p><p>hyper responders the reason for the</p><p>higher amount of cholesterol that I was</p><p>getting had a lot to do with my being</p><p>leaner and thinner than my dad and my</p><p>sister who were very closely related and</p><p>I&rsquo;ll tell you I literally done an</p><p>experiment that I&rsquo;m actually still kind</p><p>of in the process of it&rsquo;s pretty long</p><p>one where I&rsquo;ve intentionally gained body</p><p>fat about 20 pounds of body fat and I</p><p>incidentally don&rsquo;t want anyone to follow</p><p>me on this one but I have a huge wealth</p><p>of biometric data leading up to this</p><p>point so I wanted to actually capture</p><p>what I believed to be would be the case</p><p>where my LDL cholesterol would be</p><p>actually</p><p>if my body fat were higher and I&rsquo;m happy</p><p>to tell you right now that that&rsquo;s</p><p>exactly what it was at the very last day</p><p>of my weight gain experiment I was back</p><p>down to 130 LDL but having having what</p><p>would be considered a typical standard</p><p>American diet because I had to leave</p><p>Quito in order to gain weight and it</p><p>worked and I was having footlong Subway</p><p>sandwiches I was having pizza and I</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t even having that much sugar it</p><p>was mainly just starches but it worked</p><p>to not only get give me a lot of weight</p><p>but on top of that it dropped my LDL</p><p>down to 130 milligrams per deciliter I</p><p>know my prior position had I shown them</p><p>my numbers from Quito and shown that my</p><p>numbers from the standard American diet</p><p>they probably go you&rsquo;re doing great</p><p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s so much better but but it</p><p>gives me a segue to talk about the two</p><p>metrics and that same lipid panel that</p><p>matters so much more and that is your</p><p>triglycerides and your HDL cholesterol</p><p>and and I&rsquo;m telling you right now that I</p><p>have a challenge that&rsquo;s not on Twitter</p><p>that they haven&rsquo;t been able to answer</p><p>yet which is I&rsquo;ve been able to find</p><p>studies that show if you stratify</p><p>populations for having low triglycerides</p><p>and high HDL cholesterol is something we</p><p>see with people going on a ketogenic</p><p>diet their total cardiovascular disease</p><p>risk and they&rsquo;re all cause mortality</p><p>improved substantially so it&rsquo;s only when</p><p>they remove those stratifications that</p><p>you get a weak correlation with LDL</p><p>cholesterol and again this is this is a</p><p>challenge I&rsquo;ve been putting out for</p><p>quite a long time now and that&rsquo;s why for</p><p>me I mean I can only speak for myself</p><p>but for me I would much rather have an</p><p>LDL of 270 so on his mind triglycerides</p><p>are super low and my HDL is super high I</p><p>see that Wow so let&rsquo;s just touch on this</p><p>one point about let&rsquo;s say for example</p><p>your triglycerides are low and your ADL</p><p>hgo is high yet you have high LDL in</p><p>someone&rsquo;s mind initially they&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>go oh my gosh that&rsquo;s the bad cholesterol</p><p>it&rsquo;s going through my blood what is it</p><p>doing do they need to do</p><p>special like at Essen and mr test to</p><p>figure out what like the type of</p><p>cholesterol you want to touch on that</p><p>high and I and I will say this the NMR</p><p>you&rsquo;re talking about it&rsquo;s a nuclear</p><p>magnetic resonance test and at the time</p><p>that I was coming into Kido I myself was</p><p>very adamant about getting that because</p><p>it it does more than just capture those</p><p>four metrics total LDL cholesterol HDL</p><p>cholesterol and triglycerides it also</p><p>grabs the boats themselves we were just</p><p>talking about the lipoproteins and it</p><p>breaks them out into their different</p><p>types so you hear about the small dense</p><p>versus the big fluffy and the small</p><p>dense is apparently more a thorough</p><p>genic as they would call which means</p><p>it&rsquo;s more likely to be associated with</p><p>the build-up of plaque and the arteries</p><p>and the big fluffy are supposed to be</p><p>generally benign so they don&rsquo;t they</p><p>don&rsquo;t have that same risk because</p><p>they&rsquo;re very buoyant they don&rsquo;t crash</p><p>into your your arteries as I heard the</p><p>refrain go but the truth is when it</p><p>comes down to it I&rsquo;ve yet to see any</p><p>compelling data that LDL particles that</p><p>aren&rsquo;t modified in some fashion that</p><p>aren&rsquo;t oxidized or glycated are in fact</p><p>a threat at all and I realize that this</p><p>is this is a something that kind of goes</p><p>against what is considered to be</p><p>conventional medical wisdom the bottom</p><p>line is is the pathogenesis the the</p><p>actual disease state has never been</p><p>demonstrated with a thorough Scott</p><p>o&rsquo;clock in the absence of injury to the</p><p>vessel walls or oxidative stress or</p><p>basically anything that shows a</p><p>breakdown of the system itself so this</p><p>is this is why like having low</p><p>triglycerides is such a good sign</p><p>because if you have a lot of boats but a</p><p>little bit of cargo it means the boats</p><p>are succeeding at dropping that cargo</p><p>off so you don&rsquo;t even need to be a big</p><p>senior engineer to realize this if</p><p>you&rsquo;re watching boats that are going out</p><p>of the harbor and they&rsquo;re coming back in</p><p>the&ndash; sounds like it&rsquo;s proper shipping</p><p>all around so let&rsquo;s just help people to</p><p>when you talk about boats you&rsquo;re talking</p><p>about the carrier of cholesterol LDL and</p><p>HDL</p><p>so basically when someone talks about</p><p>HDL LDL they&rsquo;re talking about a protein</p><p>that is caring not just cholesterol</p><p>triglycerides fat soluble vitamins and</p><p>antioxidants yeah yeah so basically</p><p>these boats are carrying material for</p><p>for healing repair building tissue</p><p>cellular functions and things like that</p><p>right basically everything your cells</p><p>need that is not already water soluble</p><p>so if you can&rsquo;t swim on its own in the</p><p>bloodstream again genius of the human</p><p>body the body says no worries I&rsquo;ve got</p><p>one kind of boat I&rsquo;m gonna pack it all</p><p>in two and the primary cargo dr. Berg</p><p>the primary cargo is fat based energy</p><p>this triglycerides and that&rsquo;s why</p><p>triglycerides being low in the blood is</p><p>a good sign we&rsquo;re actually on a</p><p>ketogenic diet we&rsquo;re actually powered by</p><p>triglycerides and that gets confusing</p><p>because a lot of people say well wait a</p><p>sec I think triglycerides go down well</p><p>triglycerides left and the bloodstream</p><p>go down because the usage is higher but</p><p>having low triglycerides in the blood</p><p>whether you&rsquo;re on a fat based diet or</p><p>not aren&rsquo;t tightly associated with</p><p>positive outcomes</p><p>so basically when we&rsquo;re talking about</p><p>LDL and H and HDL we&rsquo;re talking about</p><p>it&rsquo;s not just the cholesterol it&rsquo;s the</p><p>triglycerides they&rsquo;re caring and that</p><p>this red is used for energy and other</p><p>things yeah absolutely it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>primarily energy but it can be used for</p><p>other building materials so okay so then</p><p>let&rsquo;s just touch on another point that</p><p>you mentioned which is the the reason</p><p>why it&rsquo;s going in in the first place</p><p>well part of this picture it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>trying to fix some damage some oxidative</p><p>damage a lesion in the inside of the</p><p>artery wall right let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s touch on</p><p>that and maybe what could cause that</p><p>absolutely and you</p><ul><li>forgive me I&rsquo;m gonna geek out a little</li></ul><p>bit here okay so the best way to think</p><p>of it is when you get a cholesterol test</p><p>and you&rsquo;re capturing these LDL particles</p><p>the truth is the vast vast majority of</p><p>them started as something known as the</p><p>LDLs very low-density lipoproteins and</p><p>these vldls</p><p>are the ones that are bloated with the</p><p>triglycerides they have tons and tons of</p><p>this fat based energy those things</p><p>actually drop off the energy very very</p><p>quickly and so it&rsquo;s in just a matter of</p><p>less than an hour of the LDL is becomes</p><p>what&rsquo;s known as an ideal which is an</p><p>intermediate density lipoprotein and</p><p>then in less than half an hour it turns</p><p>into an LDL so when you see your when</p><p>you see your bloodstream as blood</p><p>markers you actually should have a small</p><p>number of those vldls and thus a small</p><p>number of triglycerides if everything is</p><p>working properly so that LDL stage</p><p>that&rsquo;s not an hour half hour that&rsquo;s 2 to</p><p>4 days now you might wonder what why</p><p>would the body want LDL particles these</p><p>boats if they no longer have any</p><p>triglycerides the energy to deliver why</p><p>would the body want them in the</p><p>bloodstream and the truth is for many</p><p>different reasons they actually serve</p><p>many roles so I discussed earlier how</p><p>they bind a pathogen so they have an</p><p>immunological role just just the same as</p><p>your monocytes for example they&rsquo;re</p><p>they&rsquo;re part of that but they&rsquo;re also</p><p>part of the reparative process so</p><p>imagine for example a whole bunch of</p><p>people whose job it is is to get into</p><p>delivery truck and in one hour they</p><p>deliver a bunch of food but then they</p><p>have kind of an all-purpose job where</p><p>they&rsquo;re traveling the neighborhood</p><p>they&rsquo;re looking for bad guys to run off</p><p>the road or they&rsquo;re looking for a house</p><p>that&rsquo;s damaged where you know they</p><p>happen to have some lumber in the back</p><p>that they can then pull up and try to</p><p>help and fix it right cells actually</p><p>have receptors yet that&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re like</p><p>little they&rsquo;re like little arms they</p><p>actually reach out to grab these when</p><p>they&rsquo;re in need of the things that are</p><p>on board and then they can</p><p>endocytosis if they actually it&rsquo;s</p><p>calling it&rsquo;s like golfing it golfing and</p><p>entirely and then they have everything</p><p>that&rsquo;s inside it for their own use</p><p>cholesterol is one of the things that&rsquo;s</p><p>part of its cargo</p><p>but the lipoprotein itself is also made</p><p>of something known as phospholipids well</p><p>guess what our cell membranes are made</p><p>of they&rsquo;re made of free cholesterol and</p><p>phospholipids so cells when they can&rsquo;t</p><p>synthesize enough on their own</p><p>fortunately the body wisely make sure a</p><p>lot of those lipoproteins are just ready</p><p>and able to be provided for the cells to</p><p>be able to get use of and that&rsquo;s why it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t surprise me by the way when many</p><p>people go on statins will report having</p><p>muscle pain particularly they tend to be</p><p>a bit more athletic this for me I mean I</p><p>and again I&rsquo;m not really put a lot of</p><p>research into this but I would not be</p><p>surprised at all if it&rsquo;s the lack of</p><p>availability for LDL particles for</p><p>muscle repair and growth which is</p><p>absolutely what they get used for so</p><p>that whole stage I mean the whole stage</p><p>of low-density lipoproteins I know it</p><p>gets villainized a lot but it&rsquo;s actually</p><p>very powerful and necessary to the body</p><p>where we find problems with LDL</p><p>particles being associated with</p><p>cardiovascular disease and risk is where</p><p>we find that they may in fact be getting</p><p>recruited at a higher amount so here&rsquo;s</p><p>what I&rsquo;m going to get a little geeky if</p><p>you don&rsquo;t mind describe those cells that</p><p>line our vessel wall they&rsquo;re called</p><p>endothelial cells and endothelial cells</p><p>when they get damaged they release a</p><p>signaling molecule that signaling</p><p>molecule is known as a cytokine and</p><p>those cytokines at a certain amount when</p><p>there&rsquo;s really a problem that actually</p><p>signals the liver to route to up</p><p>regulate more low-density lipoproteins</p><p>so it&rsquo;s actually calling for help very</p><p>specifically for low-density</p><p>lipoproteins because it&rsquo;s so important</p><p>for muscle repair when you when you</p><p>twist your ankle and you see some of the</p><p>swelling and some of the heat and so</p><p>forth there&rsquo;s dozens of different</p><p>chemical reactions that are going on</p><p>right but part of what there</p><p>trying to do the swelling itself is</p><p>they&rsquo;re trying to pool blood they&rsquo;re</p><p>trying to get those raw materials to</p><p>that area and something a lot of people</p><p>don&rsquo;t realize is there&rsquo;s something known</p><p>as growth hormone particularly</p><p>platelet-derived growth hormone that</p><p>endothelial cells when they&rsquo;re in the</p><p>presence of will express more LDL</p><p>receptors now I am an engineer dr. Byrd</p><p>I&rsquo;m an engineer and when I see processes</p><p>already in place that not only say hey</p><p>this could possibly have something to do</p><p>with lipoproteins but are specifically</p><p>receptors that bind to little poor</p><p>low-density lipoproteins themselves I</p><p>have to say give me a reason why this is</p><p>inappropriate for the body to be making</p><p>available to the cells right Wow</p><p>that is it&rsquo;s just it must from just the</p><p>level of understanding that you have it</p><p>must be almost I don&rsquo;t know how you</p><p>react to it but you have this other</p><p>group of people out there that are</p><p>saying no no no it&rsquo;s the cholesterol and</p><p>fat is that&rsquo;s the main problem which is</p><p>totally the exact opposite and I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know how you react to it but the the one</p><p>thing I want to mention is like through</p><p>you know some people are saying that no</p><p>it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the fat it&rsquo;s the</p><p>cholesterol that is causing the insulin</p><p>resistance I guess it&rsquo;s fat within the</p><p>muscle receptor for instance I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know I don&rsquo;t know exactly the argument</p><p>but it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s your thought</p><p>on that well in your you&rsquo;re talking to</p><p>somebody who probably has more personal</p><p>data points than maybe anybody you&rsquo;ll</p><p>ever even meet I I am close to about a</p><p>hundred blood draws since November 2015</p><p>and it&rsquo;s completely ridiculous I&rsquo;m</p><p>commonly referred to as a human</p><p>pincushion but I&rsquo;m a bit OCD and making</p><p>sure I conduct these experiments in a</p><p>very controlled manner and I the vast</p><p>majority of these tests I have fasting</p><p>insulin so I&rsquo;m very very mindful of</p><p>exactly</p><p>what my basal insulin loads are and from</p><p>that perspective I I have to point this</p><p>out I have observed these changes and</p><p>how much they correlate with weight gain</p><p>weight loss how much they correlate with</p><p>fasting glucose and so forth and without</p><p>question the points in which I am at the</p><p>highest levels of saturated fat in my</p><p>diet the lowest levels of carbs and at</p><p>very moderate levels of protein I have</p><p>absolutely floored near bottom insulin</p><p>levels typically under a 2 to 4 milli I</p><p>am just really really super low but on</p><p>top of that there&rsquo;s a particular group</p><p>of people that you may have heard me</p><p>talk about that are kind of step beyond</p><p>hyper responders I call them lean</p><p>massive responders they tend to have the</p><p>highest levels of LDL but they also tend</p><p>to have the lowest levels the</p><p>triglycerides and the highest levels of</p><p>HDL so they&rsquo;re almost like a super class</p><p>they operate on really really really low</p><p>levels of insulin I I call them in it</p><p>basically in a blended fasted state and</p><p>I guarantee I know several that eat 5000</p><p>calories a day mostly fat and it is</p><p>absolutely having nearly no impact on</p><p>their insulin levels because you need</p><p>insulin primarily particularly the</p><p>postcranial insulin to deal with glucose</p><p>glucose coming into the blood your body</p><p>actually slowly adjusts to exactly how</p><p>much insulin it needs to use to shuttle</p><p>energy away and it seeks to keep that as</p><p>low as possible it does this because the</p><p>higher your insulin the less capability</p><p>your body has for something known as a</p><p>tapa G and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s kind of like</p><p>the housekeeping that your cells get to</p><p>to make use of so this is why by the way</p><p>I think people on the far end I</p><p>speculates totally speculative but I</p><p>believe these people these lean mass</p><p>hype responders may be enjoying a higher</p><p>level of etapa G and might literally be</p><p>actually having their cells aged a</p><p>little slower because of that being in a</p><p>blended fastest state is very powerful</p><p>and that&rsquo;s why the ketogenic diet is so</p><p>powerful is you&rsquo;re in many</p><p>is mimicking a fasted state which there</p><p>are plenty of studies on long before the</p><p>ketogenic diet became big as to why</p><p>that&rsquo;s so good for longevity Wow</p><p>so Wow this this is fascinating what&rsquo;s</p><p>your thought on some of the top few</p><p>triggers two things that can start this</p><p>whole cascade of affect like I know</p><p>insulin is gonna be pretty one at the</p><p>top the list right yeah you talk in the</p><p>Cascade of affect that can bring around</p><p>a disease state like with cardiovascular</p><p>disease yes endothelial cells yes so</p><p>here&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s gonna get a little</p><p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s kind of almost two</p><p>channels two directions we can go and</p><p>ironically or maybe not so ironically</p><p>they both kind of end up with higher</p><p>levels of triglycerides this is why I&rsquo;m</p><p>very mindful to watch for triglycerides</p><p>so the first one is you actually reach</p><p>what is known as the personal fat</p><p>threshold and that tends to be somewhat</p><p>individualistic there can be some</p><p>commonalities with ethnicities but what</p><p>that means is you&rsquo;re probably insulin</p><p>sensitive up to a point where you&rsquo;ve now</p><p>part so much triglycerides into your</p><p>adipose tissue again your body fat that</p><p>now your body needs to find other places</p><p>to park those triglycerides so this is</p><p>where you come up with things like fatty</p><p>liver fatty pancreas even places you</p><p>really don&rsquo;t want to see fat like say</p><p>parts and heart muscle and so forth</p><p>right that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a huge sign and a</p><p>very common one for insulin resistance</p><p>and this is this is where you also tend</p><p>to see a lot of this you see a lot of</p><p>things like just a larger waist</p><p>circumference and so forth that you want</p><p>to be mindful of well this is getting</p><p>back to sort of the fasted in fed state</p><p>this is where you&rsquo;re now moving your</p><p>body into a place in which it&rsquo;s more</p><p>predominantly in what it believes is a</p><p>fed state and how you can know this is</p><p>because fasting insulin is high if</p><p>you&rsquo;re if you have fast if you&rsquo;ve fasted</p><p>for 12 hours</p><p>and your fasting insulin is above 10 for</p><p>example then what&rsquo;s going on is your</p><p>body still feels like there&rsquo;s too much</p><p>energy and that usually is the case you</p><p>find your fasting glucose is pretty high</p><p>and it&rsquo;s still keeping the insulin high</p><p>to try to put it away</p><p>well now you have less etapa Chi you</p><p>have less of your cells abilities to do</p><p>their housekeeping because it&rsquo;s like the</p><p>lunch Bell is constantly ringing right</p><p>well this is a big problem for</p><p>cardiovascular health too because now</p><p>even the endothelial cells don&rsquo;t get</p><p>their housekeeping time and they need</p><p>that state switch because a lot of</p><p>people don&rsquo;t know this high density</p><p>lipoproteins the HDL the so-called good</p><p>cholesterol they need a fasted phase</p><p>they need a low level of insulin to get</p><p>their job done so during the period of</p><p>time where insulin is high like when</p><p>people get really sick for example and</p><p>there you&rsquo;ve heard the term feed feed a</p><p>cold right there&rsquo;s there is a tiny bit</p><p>of truth to that and that that as</p><p>insulin goes up it&rsquo;s part of not just</p><p>the store and build state but it&rsquo;s also</p><p>oftentimes part of the fight state it&rsquo;s</p><p>often a way by which your body can fight</p><p>disease and my colleague Siobhan Huggins</p><p>by the way gets into this quite a bit</p><p>this is how insulin resistance can</p><p>sometimes proceed hyperinsulinemia high</p><p>levels of insulin in the blood well</p><p>again this is important because if</p><p>you&rsquo;re not getting the switch back and</p><p>forth between being fasted and being fed</p><p>and being fasted or for that matter</p><p>fighting a disease and then getting back</p><p>to fasted your your emergency vehicles</p><p>these HDL particles they don&rsquo;t have the</p><p>time to also go out and grab the excess</p><p>cholesterol that might have been used as</p><p>part of the reparative process and what</p><p>is also known very commonly in the</p><p>literature is reverse cholesterol</p><p>transport they&rsquo;re not able to get as</p><p>much of that time as they need to get it</p><p>done overall you just want to have a</p><p>larger amount of time in a fasted State</p><p>this isn&rsquo;t even by practice and fasting</p><p>but just by remaining insulin resistant</p><p>so not maxing out your personal</p><p>threshold in the first place sorry I</p><p>know there was a bit of a long-winded</p><p>answer but to really kind of unpack it</p><p>it&rsquo;s important to kind of get that sense</p><p>there I mean as an engineer it makes</p><p>perfect sense you have insulin handling</p><p>a lot of things at the same time so why</p><p>not go ahead and piggyback these other</p><p>operations on it</p><p>if throughout all of our ancestral</p><p>history we knew they were infrequent</p><p>right we knew when we eat it wasn&rsquo;t</p><p>going to be very common or if we were</p><p>eating a small amount that it wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>take a lot of insulin to deal with the</p><p>food that was necessary and therefore we</p><p>could count on many other operations you</p><p>know piggybacking on to insulin so in</p><p>short whether you&rsquo;re on a high-fat diet</p><p>or a low-fat diet or whatever diet</p><p>you&rsquo;re on if it brings about</p><p>persistently high insulin in the blood</p><p>it&rsquo;s almost necessarily the worst kind</p><p>of state you can be it Wow so let&rsquo;s go</p><p>back because there&rsquo;s one point that I</p><p>want to clarify you mentioned something</p><p>about reverse something reverse reverse</p><p>cholesterol transport yes let&rsquo;s just</p><p>define that so people drink</p><p>sure so LDL particles these ones that</p><p>we&rsquo;re talking about they&rsquo;re often talked</p><p>about as bad because they&rsquo;ll put</p><p>cholesterol into the arterial walls it&rsquo;s</p><p>really a huge oversimplification but</p><p>there is some truth to that and part of</p><p>the reparative process can be argued is</p><p>in fact atherosclerosis</p><p>it&rsquo;s just progressive atherosclerosis is</p><p>clearly bad just like progressively just</p><p>like insulin is not bad you need insulin</p><p>but progressively high levels of insulin</p><p>aren&rsquo;t bad inflammation absolutely can&rsquo;t</p><p>live without inflammation chronic</p><p>inflammation is bad right so we fully</p><p>anticipate the operating system the</p><p>human operating system fully anticipates</p><p>that cholesterol is coming in to cells</p><p>on a constant basis and for many reasons</p><p>both for the reparative and also for the</p><p>cells themselves but likewise there&rsquo;s</p><p>this whole fleet of HDL particles these</p><p>high density lipoproteins that are on</p><p>hand that are constantly also</p><p>part of the pulling it back out and</p><p>that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re commonly associated</p><p>with having better outcomes for</p><p>cardiovascular disease the higher your</p><p>HDL see almost universally the better</p><p>your outcome with cardiovascular disease</p><p>they it&rsquo;s reverse cholesterol transport</p><p>they reverse they bring it out of the</p><p>tissues and then they take it back to</p><p>the liver and some of that cholesterol</p><p>is reusable and they will use it your</p><p>body is actually greedy about holding on</p><p>to and using cholesterol it&rsquo;s very hard</p><p>for it to make and there&rsquo;s some that&rsquo;s</p><p>not so good and that that isn&rsquo;t so good</p><p>goes out through bile acids that we make</p><p>and goes into our digestive system and</p><p>that eventually gets sent back to the</p><p>other side if you know what I mean so</p><p>basically it&rsquo;s kind of a a reverse is</p><p>that a buffer or is it a reverse</p><p>everything just works in Reverse I I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d say everything works</p><p>in Reverse but it&rsquo;s basically a means by</p><p>which cholesterol has taken out of</p><p>tissues and brought to the liver kind of</p><p>recycling yeah recycling is actually a</p><p>really good way of putting it okay in</p><p>yeah so that the oxy sterols the the</p><p>oxidized cholesterol and so forth that</p><p>ends up getting sent out but anything</p><p>that&rsquo;s usable cholesterol that&rsquo;s going</p><p>to end up getting reused so so as a</p><p>reparative action you have cholesterol</p><p>you also have a calcium right calcium</p><p>tell yes calcification that tends to be</p><p>on a more advanced level though that</p><p>usually tends to that&rsquo;s kind of to keep</p><p>it layperson friendly that&rsquo;s where</p><p>things are bad to the point that we just</p><p>want to pave over the area Kathleen but</p><p>yes that would be a good way of putting</p><p>it so the coronary artery calcium</p><p>scoring test that&rsquo;s a pretty isn&rsquo;t about</p><p>it&rsquo;s a valuable test right to get great</p><p>yes yes and to be sure there is a little</p><p>bit of risk that should always be</p><p>mentioned and that there is some</p><p>exposure to radiation I think the last</p><p>one I saw was like 0.6 millisievert</p><p>something like that comparable to a</p><p>mammogram I believe a mammogram</p><p>0.4 so that would be nothing compared to</p><p>like a cat scan of your abdomen or your</p><p>kidneys right no no no in fact a cat</p><p>scan tends to be the equivalent of</p><p>around 200 chest x-rays yeah so we by</p><p>the way I just want to insert real quick</p><p>I know it&rsquo;s common practice for a</p><p>hospital to just give you a CT for any</p><p>particular reason be very mindful of</p><p>that that really is a lot of radiation</p><p>exposure and just you know I would want</p><p>to say it feel confident that what</p><p>they&rsquo;re awarding it is appropriate given</p><p>the ailments you&rsquo;re talking about oh</p><p>yeah they do and I do think it&rsquo;s a</p><p>modern problem but I&rsquo;m glad you brought</p><p>it up because I do believe that a CAC I</p><p>mean as metrics go it is one of the most</p><p>powerful neuro but there are if not be</p><p>most powerful for disease progression</p><p>detection certainly you can have heart</p><p>disease without having calcification and</p><p>that should definitely be said but if</p><p>you do have council vacation you do want</p><p>to know about it as soon as reasonably</p><p>possible and you do want to understand</p><p>its progression so it&rsquo;s not even if you</p><p>get a calcium score right now and like</p><p>what would be considered a not good one</p><p>would be say like a four hundred right</p><p>if you find out that you have a four</p><p>hundred it&rsquo;s not really the end of the</p><p>world what you want to be sure of is</p><p>that it&rsquo;s not progressing at a high rate</p><p>such as like 50% per year or something</p><p>along those lines you want to be sure</p><p>that it&rsquo;s you know if it&rsquo;s progressing</p><p>one or two percent let me put it this</p><p>way</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind have or I would rather</p><p>have a calcium score of 400 that was</p><p>progressing at 1% per year then a</p><p>calcium score of 50 that was progressing</p><p>at 50 percent breeder right that&rsquo;s like</p><p>a no-brainer for me right but that&rsquo;s but</p><p>that&rsquo;s important and I will say this one</p><p>of the most heartbreaking thing is</p><p>heartbreaking things that we have at</p><p>cholesterol code calm is people that</p><p>come that have just gotten their first</p><p>CAC and they&rsquo;re now four years into huge</p><p>Inc diet they&rsquo;ve had high LDL but</p><p>they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;re now questioning whether</p><p>the high LDL was good because their</p><p>first days</p><p>four years in says that they have like</p><p>say a 200 and the problem is is that</p><p>there&rsquo;s now no way to know how much of</p><p>that was due to the lifestyle that they</p><p>had before going ketogenic and how much</p><p>was after and that&rsquo;s why I generally</p><p>give advice to people who are pretty</p><p>sure they&rsquo;re gonna go on keto forever</p><p>that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nice to get the CAC as</p><p>close to when you started as possible so</p><p>that you can actually have bookended you</p><p>know when that data start it and that</p><p>way you can I mean first of all</p><p>certainly you would want to know if you</p><p>had a CAC of like 200 or 300 or</p><p>something at the point that you were</p><p>starting to hear genic die anyway right</p><p>um yeah okay I mean the you can&rsquo;t</p><p>evaluate something with one number you</p><p>need two numbers before and after you</p><p>need to see progression was it better</p><p>worse and so do you I&rsquo;m guessing you do</p><p>in a minute fasting not exactly I would</p><p>say probably my window so when I&rsquo;m in</p><p>the process of doing these experiments</p><p>my intermittent fasting window may be</p><p>something like 14 hours which I kind of</p><p>don&rsquo;t count because intermittent fasting</p><p>I sort of feel like you have to be at</p><p>least 16 hours to you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>like at the ride where you have to be at</p><p>least this tall I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not quite</p><p>that tall but but Gian do you do snack</p><p>between meals</p><p>I probably snack more than the typical</p><p>ketover and I and this is actually</p><p>fairly common for lean mass hyper</p><p>responders you&rsquo;ll find a lot of people</p><p>who are very lean and or athletic who</p><p>practice keto and actually they have a</p><p>few things that are in common beyond</p><p>being lean and or athletic and having</p><p>very high levels of LDL they have a very</p><p>difficult time doing fasting</p><p>particularly law particularly very</p><p>elongated fasting like multi day fasting</p><p>they also tend to have higher fasting</p><p>glucose levels which I believe is due to</p><p>more adaptive glucose pairing but it&rsquo;s</p><p>important to keep the context in mind if</p><p>if you have higher fasting glucose as</p><p>you&rsquo;ve gotten leaner and healthier and</p><p>feel great</p><p>don&rsquo;t freak out</p><p>because it&rsquo;s very likely that you also</p><p>have lower fasting insulin which is very</p><p>suggested that it&rsquo;s adaptive glucose</p><p>very and by the way lean mass type</p><p>responders also also tend to have lower</p><p>levels of beta hydroxy butyrate so</p><p>relative to a typical kid or for example</p><p>they&rsquo;ll tend to have like say you know</p><p>point 4 to 1.0 and then they&rsquo;ll be</p><p>frustrated because they&rsquo;re couch potato</p><p>keto friend you know is running it like</p><p>three or four or something along those</p><p>lines but again all of this suggests</p><p>higher faster utilization the reason I</p><p>gave a little bit of that set up is that</p><p>I probably like meeting my lean mass</p><p>type responder friends and probably just</p><p>having a tougher time fasting because my</p><p>body is already in such a blended fasted</p><p>state when I&rsquo;m down at those levels that</p><p>I get more signaling to do something</p><p>about it so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s okay in fact that</p><p>there&rsquo;s already probably much more of</p><p>the benefits of the fasted State in the</p><p>first place the downside is that you</p><p>know the famine hits Lima Cyprus martyrs</p><p>will be the first to go like there&rsquo;s a</p><p>price for getting that way in it I think</p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to worry about the</p><p>famine so that&rsquo;s good anytime Lina yeah</p><p>right exactly this is awesome</p><p>do you have any um any less last points</p><p>you want to bring up absolutely yeah so</p><p>I have to tell you dr. bird one of the</p><p>very first and biggest things that I</p><p>want to get across to your listeners is</p><p>please have a fasted cholesterol test or</p><p>for that matter any blood tests you</p><p>should be 12 to 14 hours water fasting</p><p>if you were not and I know the current</p><p>guidelines will say you don&rsquo;t really</p><p>need to be fasted but you physically are</p><p>putting triglycerides from your food</p><p>into your bloodstream and that is why</p><p>oftentimes we have a lot of people that</p><p>come to our site let&rsquo;s say ever since I</p><p>went keto it looks like my triglycerides</p><p>have exploded and look at you know score</p><p>of 200 or 300 and so the first question</p><p>out of it shoot as we go</p><p>was it a water only fasted</p><p>what tests often times let&rsquo;s say no they</p><p>then retest later and it&rsquo;s fine like</p><p>everything&rsquo;s you know below 100 or</p><p>something along those lines so that&rsquo;s</p><p>number one number two is whatever your</p><p>cholesterol score is if you see just 1%</p><p>of my research you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s</p><p>insanely dynamic it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve moved my</p><p>I move my numbers up and down hundreds</p><p>of milligrams per deciliter in just</p><p>three years I I had the unique</p><p>distinction of having changed my lipid</p><p>numbers more than anybody else in the</p><p>world and I believe anybody else could</p><p>actually do the same thing bear in mind</p><p>this is about any medication supplements</p><p>exercise anything and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s because</p><p>the human body is actually fantastically</p><p>a depth and very adaptable and</p><p>cholesterol is really just kind of a</p><p>shadow of the larger energy metabolism</p><p>so you you really need to know that the</p><p>lipid system is very dynamic and</p><p>whatever your cholesterol score is you&rsquo;d</p><p>be surprised at how quickly it can</p><p>change assuming that you&rsquo;re close to</p><p>metabolic flexibility I do want to throw</p><p>in the caveat because if you&rsquo;re kind of</p><p>down the line it may take a little more</p><p>while to recover from where you need to</p><p>be but that brings me back to the last</p><p>point I really want to get across which</p><p>is even for somebody like myself who may</p><p>be snacking more than the typical person</p><p>or eating a little bit more in the</p><p>typical person when I get down to my</p><p>leaner levels you do want to have your</p><p>body generally in a in a fasted state</p><p>most of the time like this shouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>even really be shouldn&rsquo;t really even</p><p>need to say this but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s great</p><p>about the ketogenic diet if you get it</p><p>to work properly is you should actually</p><p>be operating on very low levels of</p><p>insulin overall and I believe that if</p><p>you do it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s such a huge benefit to</p><p>longevity</p><p>so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s definitely what I want</p><p>to fit in awesome that was great advice</p><p>Thanks thank you so much for this</p><p>interview you guys you need to go to his</p><p>website it&rsquo;s cholesterol co.com</p><p>cholesterol code calm alright thanks so</p><p>much Dave I really appreciate it</p><p>thanks for having me on dr. Berg I</p><p>really love your material oh thanks</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
