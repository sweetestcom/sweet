<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>welcome back everyone hopefully you can</p>
<p>hear me anything that I say is not meant</p>
<p>to uh treat you or replace your medical</p>
<p>care uh before you implement any any of</p>
<p>the great healthy keto diet tips that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to give give you check with</p>
<p>your doctor since they have a lot of</p>
<p>experience with this area and they can</p>
<p>definitely help you all right Steve all</p>
<p>right welcome everybody and by the way</p>
<p>yeah absolutely so also everyone can</p>
<p>welcome to the inaugural edition of the</p>
<p>drberg live show now on YouTube Facebook</p>
<p>and Rumble and we were a little nervous</p>
<p>as we pushed the launch button that you</p>
<p>know something might happen with three</p>
<p>streams but so far so good so this is</p>
<p>very exciting looks like like uh we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to do it so any of you that want to</p>
<p>go experiment and look at the show on</p>
<p>Rumble uh we&rsquo;ve got one of the top slots</p>
<p>so if you go to rumble.com uh you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>find the show for sure and Terry our</p>
<p>producer is also uh going to be</p>
<p>monitoring that so if we have any</p>
<p>inaugural questions from Rumble by golly</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to put them up on the air</p>
<p>and uh so on and so uh Dr Berg among our</p>
<p>many esteemed guests in the green room</p>
<p>we have Aban Nandan who is from South</p>
<p>Jersey and may have to slip away to do</p>
<p>his work rated uh duties so Alan andan</p>
<p>if you would unmute yourself uh here you</p>
<p>are on with Dr Burke for your one</p>
<p>question and 30 seconds</p>
<p>go morning Dr Burg uh thank you for</p>
<p>having me uh we love your videos we</p>
<p>watch myself and my wife on regular</p>
<p>basis uh very informative and</p>
<p>helpful um my question is basically we</p>
<p>are vegetarian uh Indian origin and our</p>
<p>food is um mostly carbohydrates and fat</p>
<p>um how can we uh accommodate into that</p>
<p>you know intermittent fasting ketogenic</p>
<p>diet and all um so if you can advise or</p>
<p>um is it possible for you or your team</p>
<p>to study Indian food uh so you can</p>
<p>advise is how can it be</p>
<p>accommodated yeah I I definitely have</p>
<p>enough time in my spare time to do that</p>
<p>for you and I&rsquo;m being very sarcastic now</p>
<p>I I think you can do it I am going to be</p>
<p>releasing a video uh on that topic</p>
<p>because you just have to make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting certain nutrients that</p>
<p>are difficult to get when you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>vegan diet uh zinc the bio valuable zinc</p>
<p>uh the active form of vitamin A retinol</p>
<p>which is hard to get you&rsquo;ll get the beta</p>
<p>cartine but not the actual retinol but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible um you also um you know</p>
<p>B12 is a bit difficult DHA is difficult</p>
<p>omega-3 but you could get that if you do</p>
<p>algae or maybe even spirulina so I think</p>
<p>uh I think what you&rsquo;re missing is um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to get your amino</p>
<p>acids and um maybe from sparina that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good source and uh maybe you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to consume combinations of other</p>
<p>types of proteins like Walnut nuts other</p>
<p>nuts um I would say um sprouted</p>
<p>legumes and</p>
<p>um and so you&rsquo;re just going to have to</p>
<p>look at that because um it you it can be</p>
<p>done but it&rsquo;s difficult to get your</p>
<p>proteins that&rsquo;s the really the big thing</p>
<p>right there the other thing is like uh</p>
<p>trying to get your carbohydrates lower</p>
<p>right so we want them under 50 grams per</p>
<p>day that net carbs so that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re going to have to look at</p>
<p>and um I think if you can</p>
<p>do away with grains and and then try to</p>
<p>focus on some other things you can get</p>
<p>maybe certain protein from organic tofu</p>
<p>or Tempe or um certain other things it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible and I I if I&rsquo;m not mistaken I I</p>
<p>may have released a video on that</p>
<p>recently and if I didn&rsquo;t it should be</p>
<p>released coming up this next week so</p>
<p>stay tuned for more information on that</p>
<p>but um that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s I guess that</p>
<p>that would be my short answer</p>
<p>okay thank you very much you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>thanks well by the way I hold Aban</p>
<p>Nandan in the entire nation of India uh</p>
<p>responsible for at least 25 pounds of my</p>
<p>uh weight over the years because my</p>
<p>sister-in-law rahini D is from Delhi and</p>
<p>she introduced me to their delicious</p>
<p>food and I can&rsquo;t keep my mouth off of it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so awful and uh and she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>vegetarian so there&rsquo;s chicken masala and</p>
<p>doll and naan and all those wonderful</p>
<p>things and so I love them but I&rsquo;m batt</p>
<p>back against it I&rsquo;m at war with their</p>
<p>delicious food but um thanks to the Dr</p>
<p>Berg regime we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>winning at the very least uh we know</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t add a lot of sugar in</p>
<p>the recipes so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good oh it&rsquo;s all so delicious and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see um let me move my little quiz thing</p>
<p>over here the the set up slightly</p>
<p>different here folks with our Rumble uh</p>
<p>but uh here we&rsquo;re back to it Lori from</p>
<p>YouTube uh here we go again another</p>
<p>health warning about wreath were tall</p>
<p>what are your thoughts about using</p>
<p>it I did a video on that you should</p>
<p>watch it um our bodies actually make a</p>
<p>RR tool believe it or not it makes it</p>
<p>and so that study that you saw that W it</p>
<p>was considered dangerous uh it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even about dietary consumption of rol at</p>
<p>all it wasn&rsquo;t about it didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>include like um it didn&rsquo;t look at taking</p>
<p>it in large amounts from the diet so I</p>
<p>watch my video on that topic because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just another one of those things</p>
<p>that um this the science is not real a</p>
<p>science it&rsquo;s altered it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>manipulatory so take a look at it and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see the full full scoop of the</p>
<p>background all right sounds great and by</p>
<p>the way uh as you feel necessary Dr ber</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you to talk about Rumble and</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re quickly I guess uploading</p>
<p>videos that aren&rsquo;t available on YouTube</p>
<p>anymore to rumble is that</p>
<p>true that is a true statement all the</p>
<p>video videos that uh I had to take off</p>
<p>YouTube are now on Rumble so just make</p>
<p>sure you you subscribe to rumble too</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s certain videos that um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to watch and see and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain things we cannot put on</p>
<p>YouTube anymore unfortunately so um we</p>
<p>have to kind of decide what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be on what but if you are also on Rumble</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to see the full um</p>
<p>spectrum of videos that we have on the</p>
<p>the topic of Health um so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the good news that&rsquo;s exciting uh Dr Burg</p>
<p>is Relentless to make sure that you get</p>
<p>all the information in his staff of many</p>
<p>talented people are working 24/7 to make</p>
<p>that happen so keep your eye on Rumble</p>
<p>but of course we still uh you know</p>
<p>appreciate being on YouTube and Facebook</p>
<p>and the other channels that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>accustomed to but we now have a broader</p>
<p>Spectrum as Dr Berg uh called it so no</p>
<p>reason you can&rsquo;t find any information</p>
<p>give us a little time as we grow into</p>
<p>the full catalog of things on Rumble but</p>
<p>there coming in the meantime though</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not neglect people around the</p>
<p>world so we&rsquo;d like to say a good morning</p>
<p>to all of our viewers joining us today</p>
<p>from the UK Canada Mexico South Africa</p>
<p>Jordan Indonesia Ethiopia Finland Sri</p>
<p>Lanka uh Chile Israel Taiwan Poland</p>
<p>Romania uh</p>
<p>Egypt excuse me let me grab that little</p>
<p>handle it it popped up Terri is so</p>
<p>furiously loading questions that that</p>
<p>slipped away okay how about the</p>
<p>Netherlands India India thank you</p>
<p>abinandan</p>
<p>uh uh let&rsquo;s see Egypt France Morocco the</p>
<p>Netherlands India Nepal Argentina Russia</p>
<p>the Virgin Islands Peru Columbia</p>
<p>Pakistan Norway Japan Oman Ukraine</p>
<p>Trinidad our prayers go out to Ukraine</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago Greece ubekistan um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Trinidad and</p>
<p>Tobago Sweden Zambia Spain Uganda arria</p>
<p>the United Arab emirats Croatia cashmir</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t heard from them for a while</p>
<p>Bahamas Ireland Nigeria New Zealand</p>
<p>brunai Australia Cyprus Italy Qatar</p>
<p>Tanzania Switzerland Slovakia South</p>
<p>Korea Jamaica the Philippines the Czech</p>
<p>Republic Saudi Arabia Portugal uh</p>
<p>lickstein Scotland and all across the</p>
<p>United States as our list continues to</p>
<p>grow with people appreciating being able</p>
<p>to live a healthy life and avoid certain</p>
<p>diseases rather than having to cure them</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see so uh Michelle from</p>
<p>Facebook what&rsquo;s the best way to correct</p>
<p>a leaky gut</p>
<p>well your your uh glutamine is is the</p>
<p>amino acid that you you want to get more</p>
<p>of and there&rsquo;s glutamine is in mainly</p>
<p>mostly in beef red meat believe it or</p>
<p>not so if you were to do a carnivore</p>
<p>diet for a period of time um You</p>
<p>probably would actually heal that gut um</p>
<p>any type of inflammatory condition um</p>
<p>you should do more of a carnivore diet</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one thing you could do um if</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>um live in uh India like my my friend</p>
<p>just mentioned and they they do more ve</p>
<p>vegetable type things then you&rsquo;d focus</p>
<p>more on cabbage because cabbage would be</p>
<p>a the vegan version of getting enough</p>
<p>glutamine out of all the vegetables</p>
<p>cabbage is very unique in that um it</p>
<p>seems to be tolerated when people have</p>
<p>gastrointestinal problems including</p>
<p>ulcers</p>
<p>gastritis and even inflammation lower in</p>
<p>their gut which is very interesting so</p>
<p>cabbage is the thing and um and if you</p>
<p>take sauerkraut now you&rsquo;re taking it to</p>
<p>the next level because you have this</p>
<p>fermented with the Prebiotic the</p>
<p>probiotic and so uh you have a lot of</p>
<p>great things with cabbage but I would uh</p>
<p>consume more um beef and that uh is</p>
<p>really good for the gut believe it or</p>
<p>not and I&rsquo;ve never met anyone that has</p>
<p>an allergy to beef but I have met people</p>
<p>that have allergies to eggs and seafood</p>
<p>and sensitivity</p>
<p>to gluten and um soy and uh many other</p>
<p>things but not beef all right very good</p>
<p>well ladies and gentlemen drum roll</p>
<p>please sultones from Rumble I&rsquo;ve been on</p>
<p>healthy keto for 7 months I&rsquo;ve had more</p>
<p>headaches in the past seven months than</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had in the previous three years</p>
<p>what is poor Suess from Rumble doing</p>
<p>wrong I think you need mainly you need</p>
<p>more salt uh you need more salt on the</p>
<p>diet when you do keto and definitely</p>
<p>fasting um you get rid a lot of extra</p>
<p>fluid and with that fluid you there a</p>
<p>loss of electrolytes so this is why the</p>
<p>two things that you must do when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on keto is electrolytes and B vitamins</p>
<p>but one of the key electrolytes would be</p>
<p>sodium so I would just uh increase your</p>
<p>sea salt and that your headaches should</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>away well that&rsquo;s terrific well Lucy also</p>
<p>from Rumble says I just left YouTube and</p>
<p>deleted it and came to rumble thank</p>
<p>thanks to Dr Berg so it&rsquo;s important that</p>
<p>we all have a choice we like to give</p>
<p>everybody a chance but isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>wonderful to have options so good for</p>
<p>you l uh Lucy we know you&rsquo;ll be one of</p>
<p>the uh strong inaugural members to</p>
<p>rumble and we will always serve you</p>
<p>there okay consult Wade Lee what a name</p>
<p>from Rumble I have golf St stones and a</p>
<p>fatty liver how can I reverse these</p>
<p>conditions and do they reinforce each</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting about a gallstone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a super concentrated uh cholesterol</p>
<p>and the ratio of cholesterol in bile</p>
<p>salts is out of balance when you have</p>
<p>gallstone so all you have to do is just</p>
<p>flip that uh ratio to have more bile</p>
<p>salts than you do cholesterol and um you</p>
<p>can if it&rsquo;s not too big if those stones</p>
<p>are not too big one simple remedy would</p>
<p>be to start to take bio salts at the end</p>
<p>of the meal you can take them in capsule</p>
<p>form you just take take those at the end</p>
<p>of the meal and then um I would also if</p>
<p>the stones are are turning into kind of</p>
<p>more sludge you can take another thing</p>
<p>called tudka which is a type of bile</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit different and you</p>
<p>take that an empty stomach and uh so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you would want to do I have</p>
<p>a video on Rumble if you search it on um</p>
<p>how to increase your bile but that would</p>
<p>be the the answer to Stones is</p>
<p>increasing bile and and uh a couple</p>
<p>things that create a deficiency of bile</p>
<p>would be high carb refined sugars type</p>
<p>diets and cortisol with stress and too</p>
<p>much estrogen maybe from birth control</p>
<p>pills all these things contribute to uh</p>
<p>dep depleting your bile um as well as</p>
<p>going in a lowfat diet believe it or not</p>
<p>um because your body needs that fat to</p>
<p>stimulate the production of bile um so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s um it it you know it&rsquo;s not just a</p>
<p>matter of oh I&rsquo;m going to reduce my</p>
<p>cholesterol that&rsquo;s not the problem it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the it&rsquo;s the bile that you need to</p>
<p>increase so just uh watch watch my video</p>
<p>on that because I have a lot of data</p>
<p>very good let&rsquo;s go to our first quiz</p>
<p>question today and we are chalk full of</p>
<p>true falses which gives many people hope</p>
<p>that they can have 5050 chance of</p>
<p>getting it correct and here it</p>
<p>is all right uh true or false with</p>
<p>without magnesium vitamin D is</p>
<p>completely</p>
<p>ineffective all right true or false</p>
<p>audience it&rsquo;s up to you to decide let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see uh Osama from YouTube what is uh</p>
<p>your opinion on taking glutathione</p>
<p>supplements</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a what&rsquo;s called gluto</p>
<p>glutathione reduced which is what I</p>
<p>would recommend taking I I I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good idea um uh there&rsquo;s are</p>
<p>precursors NAC and and zinc are</p>
<p>precursors and selenium is the precursor</p>
<p>that you could take too but when you</p>
<p>take more glutathione it takes the</p>
<p>stress off your liver you&rsquo;re able to</p>
<p>detox more you&rsquo;re able to have this</p>
<p>better ratio of what&rsquo;s called oxidative</p>
<p>stress uh uh where you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>overcoming that because glutathione is</p>
<p>one of the most potent antioxidants uh</p>
<p>throughout the body there&rsquo;s another one</p>
<p>called um melatonin which you can get</p>
<p>from just being out in the sun too but</p>
<p>um not taking it as a supplement I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recommend that but yeah glutathion is a</p>
<p>great great thing to take for your liver</p>
<p>especially if you want to have um less</p>
<p>oxidative damage and uh more support</p>
<p>with uh things like inflammation</p>
<p>longevity repair recovery especially if</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>exercise um so I I have some videos on</p>
<p>this topic as well you should you should</p>
<p>look into okay very good and Facebook we</p>
<p>certainly aren&rsquo;t forgetting you and with</p>
<p>that Becky from Facebook what would you</p>
<p>take to lower your triglycerides uh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>already doing healthy keto uh good and</p>
<p>bad cholesterol levels are in the normal</p>
<p>range so if they&rsquo;re in a normal range</p>
<p>well if your if your triglycerides are</p>
<p>High um I would re-evaluate your carbs</p>
<p>uh make sure that you&rsquo;re not doing any</p>
<p>hidden carbs because us usually it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>hidden carbs that are causing that Spike</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>triglyceride if that&rsquo;s not the case then</p>
<p>that means that you&rsquo;re still in the</p>
<p>transition phase you&rsquo;re burning fat and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s triglycerides being um basically</p>
<p>released from your fat cells and you</p>
<p>just need to increase your exercise to</p>
<p>burn them off so that&rsquo;s another way to</p>
<p>get rid of your triglycerides is to work</p>
<p>out more because that would be a fuel</p>
<p>source that you can use to uh um run on</p>
<p>as you exercise okay very good our</p>
<p>studio audience including perhaps some</p>
<p>from Rumble because I know um that Terry</p>
<p>is monitoring that uh on the first quiz</p>
<p>question which was a true falser and it</p>
<p>asked the audience what mag without</p>
<p>magnesium vitamin D is completely</p>
<p>ineffective 55% of our respondents say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s false and 45% say it&rsquo;s true who</p>
<p>winning today Dr</p>
<p>B it&rsquo;s actually true</p>
<p>uh in order to um convert the inactive</p>
<p>to the active form of vitamin D uh</p>
<p>magnesium is essential in fact the</p>
<p>enzymes for that process are dependent</p>
<p>on magnesium which is a co-actor so this</p>
<p>is really interesting because I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to be doing a video today on the</p>
<p>relationship between vitamin D and</p>
<p>magnesium and if you have a magnesium</p>
<p>deficiency uh boy you need to know about</p>
<p>the relationship between the two because</p>
<p>first of all what is like 75% of the</p>
<p>population is deficient in vitamin D and</p>
<p>and about 45 to 50% of the population is</p>
<p>deficient in</p>
<p>magnesium that that&rsquo;s not a good</p>
<p>combination especially since these both</p>
<p>both of these work together and then if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking too much</p>
<p>calcium uh then you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>really in trouble because that calcium</p>
<p>is going to be um not being mobilized</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be kind of stuck in</p>
<p>different places in your body so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to create that video um you always</p>
<p>need magnesium to be able to allow</p>
<p>vitamin D to work so if you have vitamin</p>
<p>D symptoms deficiency</p>
<p>symptoms it and you&rsquo;re taking vitamin D</p>
<p>it could be you just need more magnesium</p>
<p>to make it work all right very good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get scientific doc Malcolm from</p>
<p>YouTube I&rsquo;m eating 100 grams of butter</p>
<p>every day on my low carb but not keto</p>
<p>diet will that create problems since I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not burning those fats while in ketosis</p>
<p>yes you are correct because if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing a high higher fats with higher</p>
<p>carbs that&rsquo;s just as bad as doing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually worse than it&rsquo;s worse than just</p>
<p>doing carbs alone because that uh like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s take for example ice cream</p>
<p>right you have sugar and you have a lot</p>
<p>of fat uh that can also U be just as</p>
<p>damaging damaging to um adding a lot of</p>
<p>sugar to protein because you&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>this called glycation glycation is where</p>
<p>you have this binding of the protein</p>
<p>with the sugar and it kind of gunks up</p>
<p>and clogs up the body in different</p>
<p>places different organs and different</p>
<p>tissues and different cells and so um</p>
<p>glycation doesn&rsquo;t just happen with the</p>
<p>sugar and protein it happens with the</p>
<p>sugar and fat too so if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do more fat you better go L carb or</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do it at all okay there it is</p>
<p>brother Rick from YouTube I have a dear</p>
<p>friend who is on dialysis and only has</p>
<p>one kidney is there any way to restore</p>
<p>his kidney&rsquo;s health so that he can get</p>
<p>off</p>
<p>dialysis I I I&rsquo;m not going to make any</p>
<p>promises but I did have a a gentleman</p>
<p>that um came to my clinic he flew to my</p>
<p>clinic and wanted some help and he was</p>
<p>on dialysis and he he uh came in the</p>
<p>middle of winter and uh there was a</p>
<p>snowstorm he was in a hotel about a half</p>
<p>a mile away he walked to my clinic he</p>
<p>was the only person that showed up that</p>
<p>day so we worked with him all day long</p>
<p>and um he was in a situation because um</p>
<p>he had to get dialysis but um you know</p>
<p>what to make a long story short he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t need dialysis um after he left</p>
<p>for a period of time and um I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what happened to him but what was</p>
<p>fascinating is we just got him on really</p>
<p>healthy healthy foods because um and he</p>
<p>did work with his doc to make make sure</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have too much of certain</p>
<p>things um but the point is that I think</p>
<p>I think I wouldn&rsquo;t um say that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terminal I I think there&rsquo;s things you</p>
<p>can do but you really need</p>
<p>to really evaluate what caused it in the</p>
<p>first place most causes of PE of</p>
<p>advanced stage kidney disease is being a</p>
<p>diabetic so if that&rsquo;s your situation</p>
<p>then think about what Creed that</p>
<p>diabetic situation usually diet usually</p>
<p>refined carbs so by getting rid of those</p>
<p>things and changing the diet hopefully</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to do something about it</p>
<p>in a positive direction okay very good</p>
<p>Vendetta uh from YouTube my 9-year-old</p>
<p>often complains of foot pain after</p>
<p>soccer practices our doctor says it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>normal for a child that is growing uh</p>
<p>time for new shoes also what&rsquo;s your best</p>
<p>advice for gaining weight while</p>
<p>occasionally suffering from gastro</p>
<p>itis okay so that and that two questions</p>
<p>I think for a child especially if you</p>
<p>have like growing pains that is simply a</p>
<p>vitamin D deficiency a child an infant a</p>
<p>newborn desperately needs a a very</p>
<p>sufficient amount of vitamin D for</p>
<p>structural development and if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough vitamin D they&rsquo;ll have all</p>
<p>sorts of structural problems with their</p>
<p>skeleton and connective tissue and and</p>
<p>things like that so uh definitely</p>
<p>increase the vitamin D and then you said</p>
<p>the other question Steve I completely uh</p>
<p>focused on the first one the second</p>
<p>question was what it was what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>best advice for gaining weight while</p>
<p>occasionally suffering from</p>
<p>gastritis well you it&rsquo;s going to have to</p>
<p>be you know I would recommend doing if</p>
<p>you want to do it healthy you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have to do it with keto but just</p>
<p>eating a lot more food and um and the</p>
<p>the other thing is uh the problem with</p>
<p>gastritis is that uh we have a weakness</p>
<p>within the ability to consume those</p>
<p>large males now you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a catch 22 it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>difficult you&rsquo;re G to have to fix the</p>
<p>the weak link first because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>necessarily in a condition where you</p>
<p>could consume large amounts of calories</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to overload the</p>
<p>system and you&rsquo;re not going to properly</p>
<p>digest that well so gastritis</p>
<p>um um one of the things that I talk</p>
<p>about with that remedy is zinc uh the</p>
<p>cabbage is good for that but I would</p>
<p>watch my videos on that and then heal</p>
<p>the system first so then you may find</p>
<p>just from doing that the assimilation of</p>
<p>amino acids proteins might do better and</p>
<p>you just might gain healthy muscle just</p>
<p>from fixing your stomach all right very</p>
<p>good or dot dot dot you can come to</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s fat Clinic that&rsquo;s me and if you</p>
<p>hang out with me for even a week or so I</p>
<p>can pile it on you when I slip off uh</p>
<p>you know the proper eating regimes I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>an expert at that so in a panic you just</p>
<p>give me a call and I&rsquo;ll show you how to</p>
<p>do that uh then you can go back to think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to go to people have that</p>
<p>important to you know to go someone has</p>
<p>experience in something like that if you</p>
<p>want to gain a lot of fat talk to</p>
<p>someone has experience that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get you Steve is the the person</p>
<p>for that oh listen audience when I blow</p>
<p>it I mean it&rsquo;s bad you know dozens of</p>
<p>donuts just fly by it&rsquo;s really bad but</p>
<p>then I suffer and come back to my senses</p>
<p>but should you need some weight I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>guy</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see Manola from YouTube what is</p>
<p>your advice for someone with a apib</p>
<p>caused by Omega free fatty acids I for</p>
<p>someone with apib that&rsquo;s caused by I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know where they know that was</p>
<p>caused by uh omega-3 fatty acids thank</p>
<p>you for your uh precious advice does</p>
<p>that make</p>
<p>sense yeah I I never I never um heard</p>
<p>any data that omega-3 fatty acids can</p>
<p>actually cause arhythmia um I do know</p>
<p>that if you have a lot of fat in general</p>
<p>and it overloads the gallbladder or the</p>
<p>bodu whatever I think that that</p>
<p>indirectly can create congestion and</p>
<p>cause your heart to skip and not beat</p>
<p>correctly but typically um the pacemaker</p>
<p>needs certain things to work and</p>
<p>um uh you need to support uh the the</p>
<p>parasympathetic nervous system which is</p>
<p>the Vegas nerve and with v a lot of one</p>
<p>and as well as the electrolytes um</p>
<p>especially potassium magnesium but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it takes a bit of time you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>like try oh I just you know for a week</p>
<p>if you have that far gone or that</p>
<p>advanced problem with atrio FIB it could</p>
<p>take some time to to bring that back so</p>
<p>those are two things I would look at</p>
<p>also I would watch my video on in um</p>
<p>EMF um electromagnetic field so uh</p>
<p>because personally with myself I had a</p>
<p>heart arhythmia issue and I was just</p>
<p>being exposed to Too Much EMF fixed it</p>
<p>and never had a problem again so</p>
<p>something to look at that&rsquo;s terrific</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s something to look at the next</p>
<p>Quiz question there you are Dr</p>
<p>Berg okay true or false the mother of</p>
<p>the apple cider vinegar you know that</p>
<p>stuff that that is at the bottom of the</p>
<p>bottle when you get this appleid of</p>
<p>vinegar um is composed of good bacteria</p>
<p>in enzymes and is an indication that</p>
<p>your apple cider vinegar is a high</p>
<p>quality product is that true or is that</p>
<p>false or is it sludge Jump On It</p>
<p>audience let&rsquo;s see Amed from Facebook</p>
<p>hello Facebook it is is it okay to eat</p>
<p>small amounts of chickpeas on healthy</p>
<p>keto um it is it is you can do that you</p>
<p>just have to count your carbs make sure</p>
<p>you have less than 50 grams of net</p>
<p>carb and there is there a lot in</p>
<p>chickpeas doc I mean spoon feel pretty</p>
<p>bad well there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some there&rsquo;s definitely some uh</p>
<p>depending on how much you have usually</p>
<p>when people are consuming sometimes they</p>
<p>do it as a uh um you know in in various</p>
<p>recipes uh like hummus so in that case</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing massive quantities and</p>
<p>plus you have the if you have some</p>
<p>really good good good stuff you have the</p>
<p>olive oil in there you have garlic in</p>
<p>there lemon juice but you got to be</p>
<p>careful of that hummus nowadays because</p>
<p>start reading the ingredients because</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even put olive oil in there</p>
<p>anymore it&rsquo;s like soy oil canola cotton</p>
<p>seed sesame seed oil or sunflower seed</p>
<p>oil now you want the olive</p>

<p>important to keep it short and sweet so</p>
<p>tell me what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on well um um first of all good morning</p>
<p>Dr Burke thank you so much for this um</p>
<p>Priceless opportunity my name is Leah</p>
<p>first I want to express my gratitude to</p>
<p>you I started to follow your Healthy</p>
<p>keto protocol strictly with your</p>
<p>electroly and seesaw old met since last</p>
<p>uh summer I&rsquo;m 43 and 5 foot tall my</p>
<p>weight went from 145 to 120 my parents</p>
<p>came for visit this summer I introduced</p>
<p>your program to them help my dad get off</p>
<p>the high blood pressure Mets which he</p>
<p>has been taking for decades and help my</p>
<p>mom get off the statens for her</p>
<p>triglyceride so we are extremely</p>
<p>grateful I did All Med with some</p>
<p>prolonged bath at a point that uh my</p>
<p>weight even went down to 115 in July I</p>
<p>know I should not step on the scales</p>
<p>often but I feel myself choppy sometimes</p>
<p>too so in in July I I think I added the</p>
<p>non 45 nutritional ease in my diet I</p>
<p>munch it whenever I want to and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know how much in total I took every</p>
<p>day I love the taste of it and feel good</p>
<p>eating it my weight just seemed to</p>
<p>slowly creep back up even though I am</p>
<p>still on om every day now my calves and</p>
<p>knees will feel swollen in the evening</p>
<p>too so I&rsquo;m so confused is it because I</p>
<p>stay in one type of fast too long or is</p>
<p>it because I eat too much nutritional</p>
<p>yeast is there a daily dose that I may</p>
<p>surpassing all right well you happen to</p>
<p>be uh talking to one person that loves</p>
<p>nutritional yeast and the uh recommended</p>
<p>dosage is nine wonderful crunchy tablets</p>
<p>per day and I I would be known to munch</p>
<p>them too anyway she&rsquo;s uh 43 5T tall went</p>
<p>from 145 to 120 that deserves a ring</p>
<p>bell um and she&rsquo;s also very delighted</p>
<p>that she Tau talked to her parents into</p>
<p>uh following it now dad&rsquo;s off blood</p>
<p>pressure medicine mom&rsquo;s off of of um uh</p>
<p>what is that stuff for um trus the</p>
<p>Statin I don&rsquo;t Statin yeah so off the</p>
<p>statins and and so on so anyway but uh</p>
<p>she she went down to 115 at one point</p>
<p>which was terrific but she&rsquo;s taking</p>
<p>nutritional yeast and I think she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>trying to see what can she do to ward</p>
<p>off any weight gain is there any sort of</p>
<p>now that she&rsquo;s there you know can she</p>
<p>eat nutritional yeast might that be</p>
<p>causing her I think she said her her</p>
<p>legs and ankles I&rsquo;m gaining weight oh</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gaining weight all right well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s stop that well don&rsquo;t hang around</p>
<p>me that&rsquo;s uh solution number one and</p>
<p>number two doc what do you think she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing pretty darn good what does she</p>
<p>need well would would ever work before</p>
<p>work again so the the big question is um</p>
<p>is she doing anything different than</p>
<p>when she was losing weight is there</p>
<p>anything different well if there is then</p>
<p>go back to what you&rsquo;re doing but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say for example she&rsquo;s doing the exact</p>
<p>same thing and now she&rsquo;s gaining weight</p>
<p>well the two things I would look at uh</p>
<p>in my little assessment of that I would</p>
<p>look at uh how is her sleep how is her</p>
<p>stress level those are the most</p>
<p>important things and then um also um is</p>
<p>she exercising can we increase</p>
<p>exercising can we increase the um the</p>
<p>fasting can we eat less frequently and</p>
<p>then can we bring the carbs down lower</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something there that we have to</p>
<p>adjust because sometimes the body gets</p>
<p>to a plateau where you need to um change</p>
<p>some things so I guess you know to</p>
<p>evaluate that I just would I would keep</p>
<p>asking those questions and seeing what</p>
<p>area that we can change easily so we can</p>
<p>actually turn things around I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>you just a quick example I worked with</p>
<p>someone that was had really good diet oh</p>
<p>my gosh it was great uh but there was</p>
<p>just not enough sleep that sleep I had</p>
<p>at the time I didn&rsquo;t know how important</p>
<p>it was but we got her to sleep a lot</p>
<p>more and boy she just just went right to</p>
<p>her goal and she maintained it because</p>
<p>the um when you don&rsquo;t sleep it affects</p>
<p>your blood sugars it affects the</p>
<p>cortisol it affects inflammation it</p>
<p>affects um your ability to burn fat in a</p>
<p>big big way and then also goes for</p>
<p>stress as well so those are the two</p>
<p>things I would look at and uh see if I</p>
<p>would improve that&rsquo;s terrific now I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t remember uh uh Leah were you also</p>
<p>not able to hear Dr Berg is that correct</p>
<p>did you not hear his response or did you</p>
<p>yeah not at all okay well sleep is one</p>
<p>big issue so make sure you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>the right kind of sleep because if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not then cortisol and blood</p>
<p>sugars and all stuff by the way we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got the cone of silence installed for</p>
<p>both Leah and Dr Berg that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here very expensive Gadget and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working well but anyway so do that</p>
<p>and also he&rsquo;s just Str normally when you</p>
<p>get really invigorated on a process and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing it and watch checking off</p>
<p>every box sometimes that can slide a</p>
<p>little bit as we get accustomed to the</p>
<p>new routine so he wants you to go back</p>
<p>and kind of carefully check to see if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing anything different and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually it you know slipping here</p>
<p>or there that might add to a little uh</p>
<p>weight gain and so on uh but boy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so close to it I&rsquo;m sure you can prove it</p>
<p>so please uh keep in touch with us oh go</p>
<p>ahead I sorry I can I squeeze one more</p>
<p>question cucumbers good to consume Okay</p>
<p>C cucumbers are they good to they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gross but are they good to consume Dr</p>
<p>bird totally fine we&rsquo;re totally</p>
<p>fine all right good they are he he gives</p>
<p>a thumbs up on the C cucumber just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get them near me and then get back with</p>
<p>us and I&rsquo;m sure the audio problem will</p>
<p>uh resolve itself next time and</p>
<p>congratulations to you and your parents</p>
<p>and we appreciate your uh you know</p>
<p>loyalty to Dr Burke you bet okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see thank you so</p>
<p>much all right let&rsquo;s see here um oh wow</p>
<p>quiz question number two</p>
<p>uh true false 100% And the question</p>
<p>asked the mother of apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>is composed of good bacteria and enzymes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an indication that it&rsquo;s a high</p>
<p>quality product it&rsquo;s got all that gush</p>
<p>in there and the audience</p>
<p>um where did that fly past uh well 100%</p>
<p>hang on uh 100% say it&rsquo;s true there we</p>
<p>go 100% says true is that gush any good</p>
<p>doc I&rsquo;m really sorry sorry to break this</p>
<p>to everyone um and I will do a video on</p>
<p>this but uh no it&rsquo;s actually completely</p>
<p>false and here&rsquo;s the data okay I I got</p>
<p>on the phone with um CEO of the</p>
<p>largest company that makes apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar in a very high quality way</p>
<p>organic in fact they used to supply</p>
<p>brags uh until they uh they sold the</p>
<p>company so um here here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>interesting information about it that</p>
<p>mother that you see at the bottom of the</p>
<p>of the bottle is</p>
<p>sediment okay it&rsquo;s sediment it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s not filtered it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>bacteria or the friend Le bacteria or</p>
<p>the enzymes the enzymes in the</p>
<p>bacteria you can&rsquo;t see them you cannot</p>
<p>see them in fact even the bacteria as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting there now breathing in</p>
<p>the air there are copious amounts of</p>
<p>bacteria in the</p>
<p>air um that you&rsquo;re breathing in that</p>
<p>even are bacteria that actually can turn</p>
<p>apples into acetic</p>
<p>acid so the point is that you can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>them so it really doesn&rsquo;t indicate um</p>
<p>high</p>
<p>quality uh it it all has to do with what</p>
<p>that company does to uh the vinegar do</p>
<p>they use heat to kill it or is it raw or</p>
<p>do they um they use high pressure system</p>
<p>to kill it so I&rsquo;m going to do a more</p>
<p>complete video on this</p>
<p>but the the mother is not not the the</p>
<p>main thing that you need to focus on</p>
<p>consuming you want to focus on getting</p>
<p>something from uh knowing the the</p>
<p>transparent source of how they produce</p>
<p>it and there&rsquo;s a lot of um companies</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t do it right but you want a</p>
<p>company that is you can get behind and I</p>
<p>I will sell fairchilds is is the best</p>
<p>company out there that uh that&rsquo;s where I</p>
<p>get my upside of vinegar for the animals</p>
<p>and myself and um he&rsquo;s an older</p>
<p>gentleman who owns it who still has a</p>
<p>lot of Integrity compared to some of</p>
<p>these other guys that he will um</p>
<p>basically Al keep it standard and and</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s more expensive to make</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t dilute his product with</p>
<p>water like brags does so you get the</p>
<p>real thing high</p>
<p>quality um and his has the mother in</p>
<p>there sometimes you see the settlement</p>
<p>sometimes you don&rsquo;t but that&rsquo;s not not</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re what you should be looking</p>
<p>for well I tell you what if Dr Berg</p>
<p>gives anybody a recommendation they</p>
<p>deserve it because he&rsquo;s fanatic about</p>
<p>quality I remember years ago over here</p>
<p>in a conversation where he was put in a</p>
<p>product that cost um I think $2,000 plus</p>
<p>per kilo versus you can buy it from</p>
<p>China or whatever for 20 bucks a kilo</p>
<p>which is the ingredient in other</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s supplements so uh if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>buying Dr Berg&rsquo;s products um I guarantee</p>
<p>you from watching him they are of the</p>
<p>utmost quality and he&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>focused on them and doesn&rsquo;t let all that</p>
<p>junk get into it so by that apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar I can guarantee you uh that is a</p>
<p>sound product and here&rsquo;s our next</p>
<p>question Dr Burg another true falser</p>
<p>okay true or false since magnesium is</p>
<p>present in so many foods it&rsquo;s fairly</p>
<p>easy to achieve your rdas which is the</p>
<p>required amounts that you need right so</p>
<p>is that true or false all right climb on</p>
<p>it audience and let&rsquo;s go back to uh in</p>
<p>this case jeie from Facebook Dr Berg you</p>
<p>changed my life we&rsquo;re glad to hear that</p>
<p>I followed your list of high histamine</p>
<p>foods to avoid and all my symptoms are</p>
<p>gone thank you you so that wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>question but a statement thank you for</p>
<p>that jeie and let&rsquo;s see um Rick from</p>
<p>YouTube why don&rsquo;t more people talk about</p>
<p>uh black codfish as being beneficial to</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>health well that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>question I I I I don&rsquo;t know they people</p>
<p>should be talking about it more I I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why they don&rsquo;t but um as you</p>
<p>might know there&rsquo;s a lot of things being</p>
<p>filtered in the news nowadays um so if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a lot of money behind it</p>
<p>maybe not they&rsquo;re not going to talk</p>
<p>about it but um yeah I I don&rsquo;t know I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know all right well let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Dusty from Rumble glad to hear from them</p>
<p>again I&rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting for</p>
<p>about 10 months but can&rsquo;t get past 18</p>
<p>hours I am 62 and a fast cyclist and</p>
<p>have always been slim the only the only</p>
<p>benefit I think this is great the only</p>
<p>benefit I&rsquo;ve seen so far is that my</p>
<p>knees feel better not other benefits I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a bit disillusioned</p>
<p>uh that I&rsquo;m not seeing more benefits</p>
<p>well you sound like you&rsquo;re in fabulous</p>
<p>shape I don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s a lot more we</p>
<p>can do for you you&rsquo;re doing great at</p>
<p>62 well the the thing is the fact that</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t go longer than 18 hours tells</p>
<p>me that you may need to go lower with</p>
<p>your carbs when you eat I didn&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not talking about lowering your calories</p>
<p>just lowering your carbs because that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make it easier to go longer um when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in fat burning you can just go a</p>
<p>lot longer between meals so maybe want</p>
<p>to increase more fat to do a longer fast</p>
<p>because um I will say if you can go to</p>
<p>20 hours of</p>
<p>fasting um that&rsquo;s kind of what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>right now 20 21 hours sometimes 22 hours</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s when you start seeing even</p>
<p>more benefits so um I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>problems you have that you need more</p>
<p>benefits maybe it&rsquo;s more cognitive maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more this but um you obviously</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a weight problem and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>exercising so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a very uh cool thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to release once I make sure</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s ready um and it uses um heart</p>
<p>rate variability technology and</p>
<p>especially if you are you know 60 and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exercising It&rsquo;s a Wonderful tool</p>
<p>to um really understand and use to your</p>
<p>advantage because you can measure it and</p>
<p>um determine what type of workout you</p>
<p>should really be focusing on to get the</p>
<p>optimum Improvement and uh and some days</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m using it there&rsquo;s some days I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like no I&rsquo;m not exercising too much</p>
<p>today I&rsquo;ll do some walking but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about it because my my autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system is not prepared to handle a run</p>
<p>up a a mountain and that&rsquo;s kind of what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing right now is running up hills</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>so stay tuned that&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>really cool tool to um help you to</p>
<p>figure things out uh without having to</p>
<p>do some expensive test all right very</p>
<p>good our question number three is a true</p>
<p>falser ask since magnes magnesium is</p>
<p>present in so many foods it&rsquo;s uh fairly</p>
<p>easy to get your uh rdas and 62% of our</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s false 38% are</p>
<p>sticking with</p>
<p>true yeah it&rsquo;s even know it&rsquo;s in a lot</p>
<p>of foods it&rsquo;s not all it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>sufficient in a lot of foods it is high</p>
<p>in spinach because dark leafy green</p>
<p>vegetables including kale and swiss</p>
<p>chard uh have a lot more chlorophyll and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you get the Magnesium um</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to get it from beef</p>
<p>or animal products I mean to a large</p>
<p>degree you you&rsquo;re going to get more if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s grass-fed but you&rsquo;re still you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still not going to get a tremendous</p>
<p>amount uh you&rsquo;re going to get some you</p>
<p>can get it from almonds but the problem</p>
<p>with almonds they have oxalates which</p>
<p>can bind up your magnesium so</p>
<p>um this is a problem oh you can get it</p>
<p>from chocolate but chocolate also has</p>
<p>sugar sometimes as well as oets so as I</p>
<p>looked at this what you would have to</p>
<p>eat to get your magnesium I was like wow</p>
<p>this is not as easy as I thought I will</p>
<p>be creating a video on this uh with some</p>
<p>solutions for example uh let&rsquo;s say you</p>
<p>want to do get your magnesium well do</p>
<p>spinach kale or swiss chard but just add</p>
<p>a little feted cheese in your salad</p>
<p>because that will help you reduce the</p>
<p>oxalates um or when you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>almonds or when you&rsquo;re eating that</p>
<p>Lily&rsquo;s Brand chocolate so the point is</p>
<p>that magnesium is a very very important</p>
<p>um mineral that um you know you really</p>
<p>need to know how you are you getting</p>
<p>enough and uh also learn about the</p>
<p>symptoms that can be created from that I</p>
<p>released a video a couple days ago you</p>
<p>should search it out it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s I I</p>
<p>thought it was a really good video</p>
<p>because it really explains the problems</p>
<p>that you get the first symptom that you</p>
<p>get with a magnesium deficiency and</p>
<p>other symptoms that you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have enough and since you</p>
<p>know 50% of the planet is deficient in</p>
<p>magnesium it might be a good idea to</p>
<p>learn more about that very good here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our next question number four for the</p>
<p>day if you stand up and you feel dizzy</p>
<p>it usually indicates what can</p>
<p>ition I think I know but I won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say anyway yeah you bet Hey listen uh</p>
<p>audience I would tell you it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>wonderful to get these Rumble questions</p>
<p>people are obviously watching and I</p>
<p>think as a safeguard it would be very</p>
<p>smart for all our Loyal YouTube users</p>
<p>and Facebook um of whom we have no issue</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re broadcasting their stuff to go</p>
<p>to rumble and just set it up sign up so</p>
<p>that if anything happens or there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>video you can&rsquo;t find you&rsquo;ll be inclined</p>
<p>to go over there and take a look cuz</p>
<p>they their management called us they</p>
<p>were very uh encouraging and welcoming</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to do everything they</p>
<p>can at Rumble to make sure that this</p>
<p>show is shown and easy to find and of</p>
<p>course no censorship whatsoever so if</p>
<p>you get a second go set yourself up with</p>
<p>Rumble if you haven&rsquo;t already but then</p>
<p>again equal opportunity broadcaster if</p>
<p>YouTube wants to keep going you can</p>
<p>watch there and Facebook and so on well</p>
<p>and Steve let me just explain for those</p>
<p>of people are are just curious like why</p>
<p>am I on Rumble well I&rsquo;m not going to put</p>
<p>all my eggs in that one basket the</p>
<p>YouTube basket um they recently passed</p>
<p>um or put out a health um new policy</p>
<p>okay A partnership with certain health</p>
<p>organizations and um this was all in the</p>
<p>name of um you know getting rid of</p>
<p>misinformation and providing high</p>
<p>quality information well I did a survey</p>
<p>50,000 people uh answered the survey I</p>
<p>will be releasing the video early next</p>
<p>week on the results of the survey but</p>
<p>one of the big things I was very</p>
<p>uh uh it was interesting to see the M</p>
<p>great majority of people said this what</p>
<p>they really want when they&rsquo;re what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to them when they go to</p>
<p>YouTube especially in the area of Health</p>
<p>they want to have alternative choices to</p>
<p>look at they want access to</p>
<p>Alternative things now Steve correct me</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m wrong but doesn&rsquo;t a choice</p>
<p>involve two or more</p>
<p>things if I give you one thing can you</p>
<p>have a choice yeah if if your parents</p>
<p>tell you to you know we have broccoli</p>
<p>and liver on the on the table that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your choice you can pick whatever you</p>
<p>want but those are that&rsquo;s your choice is</p>
<p>that really a choice well not at all and</p>
<p>the medical community itself Dr Berg and</p>
<p>I both have a a surgeon friend of ours</p>
<p>he graduated from Yale and I&rsquo;ll say this</p>
<p>again on the graduation the dean of the</p>
<p>uh of the uh University said you all</p>
<p>have received the finest medical</p>
<p>education in the world now uh and yet</p>
<p>having said that 50% of what we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taught you is demonstrably wrong with</p>
<p>new testing and it&rsquo;s your job over the</p>
<p>next 30 Years to figure out which half</p>
<p>so they the medical community the finest</p>
<p>in the world admit look we&rsquo;re not we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re fallible and things change Salt&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for you then it&rsquo;s not so having no</p>
<p>choice is dangerous uh buy out of the</p>
<p>of the medical community itself they</p>
<p>will tell you</p>
<p>that the the thing that and regarding</p>
<p>choices it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s becoming more difficult to</p>
<p>find people like me that have these</p>
<p>different videos um when you search on</p>
<p>different topics you&rsquo;re instead you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to see more more medical stuff and</p>
<p>so uh the definition of and this is a</p>
<p>specialized definition of medical</p>
<p>misinformation is anything that</p>
<p>disagrees with</p>
<p>medical so um it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like wait a second that&rsquo;s is that really</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s kind of like a a monopoly of</p>
<p>information like they&rsquo;re putting out</p>
<p>this this is this is what is credible</p>
<p>right and you don&rsquo;t get some other</p>
<p>viewpoints and that is is really</p>
<p>dangerous because</p>
<p>um when you start taking away um</p>
<p>competition in general it&rsquo;s not good for</p>
<p>the industry then you have uh one</p>
<p>Viewpoint that can push its it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>whatever so um you don&rsquo;t really I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>learn you don&rsquo;t get the truth when you</p>
<p>just have one option um you find truth</p>
<p>when you have debates right you want to</p>
<p>be able to look at different viewpoints</p>
<p>so if it&rsquo;s if this is about finding</p>
<p>truthful information this is in the</p>
<p>wrong direction yeah and you know the</p>
<p>the evidence is abundant people as we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>even heard today who have had tremendous</p>
<p>health results by following health</p>
<p>healthy habits there&rsquo;s no magic here U</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just Dr BG&rsquo;s done enormous</p>
<p>amount of research and he is not against</p>
<p>the medical community as he pointed out</p>
<p>much of the stuff he finds out comes</p>
<p>from that community and if it&rsquo;s sound he</p>
<p>supports it if the results stand behind</p>
<p>it he has no Prejudice toward the</p>
<p>medical community but certain industries</p>
<p>have Prejudice toward him and others so</p>
<p>once again we&rsquo;re glad that we have</p>
<p>another resource and you the audience</p>
<p>are safe you can find out anything you</p>
<p>want from Dr ber and Rumble and if it</p>
<p>exists on YouTube well that&rsquo;s great too</p>
<p>okay quiz question number four um was an</p>
<p>actual question it said if you stand up</p>
<p>and feel dizzy it usually indicates what</p>
<p>condition 55% of our respondents say it</p>
<p>is low blood pressure or or a static</p>
<p>hypertension 25% say it&rsquo;s low potassium</p>
<p>levels 15% say it&rsquo;s a vertigo and 5% say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dehydration those all sound like</p>
<p>pretty good</p>
<p>answers they&rsquo;re all very good answers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re all correct there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just something that&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>deeper um when you stand up you have</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>um this thing in the body that controls</p>
<p>this adaptation Mech there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>adaptation mechanism going on it&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>part of the uh recovery system like just</p>
<p>like when you run up a hill and your</p>
<p>pulse rate goes really high what caused</p>
<p>your pulse rate to go high to adapt to</p>
<p>this new change that keeps your blood up</p>
<p>into your brain so you don&rsquo;t pass out</p>
<p>well that is the sympathetic nervous</p>
<p>system and then you have the</p>
<p>parasympathetic that works with it and</p>
<p>this is that um that device that uh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to be talking about and releasing</p>
<p>very soon but the that system is located</p>
<p>a lot of it&rsquo;s located in the in the</p>
<p>adrenal glands like the sympathetic</p>
<p>nervous system is located not all of it</p>
<p>but some of it inside the adrenal glands</p>
<p>so it could mean that your adrenals are</p>
<p>are overtaxed they&rsquo;re weakened in some</p>
<p>way they&rsquo;re stressed and</p>
<p>so yes it could be low blood pressure it</p>
<p>could Bean you need more salt and</p>
<p>pottassium</p>
<p>because salt and potassium feeds</p>
<p>something called the sodium potassium</p>
<p>pump which allows um you to create</p>
<p>electrical voltage in all the cells to</p>
<p>power the nerves and the muscle so yeah</p>
<p>it could be that it could be that it</p>
<p>could be something related to um lack of</p>
<p>B1 which supports that system as well</p>
<p>but the real thing is um if you stand up</p>
<p>and you get dizzy chances are your</p>
<p>adrenals might be a little bit tired so</p>
<p>that would be probably the most likely</p>
<p>reason and um I will create some videos</p>
<p>on what you can do about that as well</p>
<p>okay very good zeli we have not</p>
<p>forgotten you and you&rsquo;re going to come</p>
<p>up right after we put up the final quiz</p>
<p>question of the day another true</p>
<p>falser okay true or false the body can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>differentiate between physical stress</p>
<p>and mental</p>
<p>stress is that true or false audience</p>
<p>and zeli who&rsquo;s coming to us from I guess</p>
<p>they call it the Big Sky country of</p>
<p>Montana zeli I hope you&rsquo;ve unmuted</p>
<p>yourself if you&rsquo;re on with Dr</p>
<p>bur zeli I think you&rsquo;re muted why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you unmute yourself</p>
<p>please okay very good am I on now you</p>
<p>sure are um good morning good morning</p>
<p>thank you for everything you do for us</p>
<p>on line and for this opportunity to ask</p>
<p>you some questions uh my doctor uh felt</p>
<p>a palpable nodule on my thyroid thyroids</p>
<p>so they did an ultrasound and found</p>
<p>three nodules all small under one</p>
<p>centimeter I guess you consider that</p>
<p>small the first one is a circumscribed</p>
<p>echogenic rounded nodule no Associated</p>
<p>Mis calcifications no increased</p>
<p>vascularity the second one is a rounded</p>
<p>hypo eoic nodule with a few course</p>
<p>calcifications and appears to be a</p>
<p>category for lesion and then there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>third small one um the dominant</p>
<p>nodule demonstrates prominent</p>
<p>vascularity no atypical appearing lymph</p>
<p>nodes and is rated as a T1 RADS category</p>
<p>4 lesion so the Doctor is recommending</p>
<p>an FNA although I am resisting that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really want to have to go through</p>
<p>a biopsy so what I wanted to know now is</p>
<p>Are there natural means I can do to</p>
<p>shrink these</p>
<p>nules yeah this is a loaded question of</p>
<p>course uh this is this is why I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to rumble so I could speak fre but but</p>
<p>just this is what I want to say as my</p>
<p>answer the area that I think you should</p>
<p>look at to do more research in is um um</p>
<p>deficiency of iodine which has been</p>
<p>known to cause nodules in the thyroid</p>
<p>okay number one and number two the area</p>
<p>of of estrogen dominance or estrogen</p>
<p>type things that can also cause nodules</p>
<p>and by the way uh iodine modulates or</p>
<p>regulates this estrogen dominance but</p>
<p>the estrogen and things that mimic</p>
<p>estrogen can also create these nodules</p>
<p>as in endocrine</p>
<p>disruptors um you can look that up too</p>
<p>in relationship to nodules and just see</p>
<p>if you can get enough information then</p>
<p>to um to be able to evaluate what you</p>
<p>should do maybe you could find uh</p>
<p>another doctor that can work with you to</p>
<p>see if if making some other changes</p>
<p>could help you to the point where you</p>
<p>maybe you didn&rsquo;t need a biopsy uh but</p>
<p>the point is that I&rsquo;m just I want to</p>
<p>just put you in a certain direction I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tell you what to do but that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>area the two areas I would research</p>
<p>estrogen dominance and iodine</p>
<p>deficiency okay thank you great you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome thank you so much Zally boy you</p>
<p>sure are great with all the medical</p>
<p>nomenclature you studied your problem</p>
<p>and I I admire that that&rsquo;s tremendous</p>
<p>okay and I also admire the audience&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ability to rip through the questions</p>
<p>even when I&rsquo;m running a little late the</p>
<p>last one the fifth one for the day true</p>
<p>false the body can&rsquo;t differentiate</p>
<p>between physical stress and mental</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>and 85% of our respondents say it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and 15% are holding out for</p>
<p>false it&rsquo;s absolutely true it it it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t so if you&rsquo;re going through being</p>
<p>chased by a tiger versus</p>
<p>going through a lot of chronic</p>
<p>stress having a lot</p>
<p>losses watching a lot of stressful news</p>
<p>things on TV like um that that&rsquo;s um the</p>
<p>body will react with a similar type</p>
<p>thing with the cortisol and the</p>
<p>adrenaline um if you really look at what</p>
<p>stress is stress is some some problem</p>
<p>without a solution because as soon as</p>
<p>you have that</p>
<p>solution the stress goes down that</p>
<p>problem goes down down right so interes</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s why even with health</p>
<p>you know you can be really stressed out</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m constantly giving people</p>
<p>Solutions so you can do this so they can</p>
<p>be less stressed out with their health</p>
<p>but um yeah that&rsquo;s um you really got to</p>
<p>look at um how much mental stress and</p>
<p>then also anytime you know there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of YouTube videos out there that are</p>
<p>constantly giving you problems about the</p>
<p>world which is on one hand important to</p>
<p>know but on the other hand if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a solution and you walk away</p>
<p>feeling worse did it really is it really</p>
<p>beneficial so I always like when people</p>
<p>if you give me a problem give me a</p>
<p>solution at the same time or don&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>me the problem all right very good well</p>
<p>by the way uh for the new audience at</p>
<p>Rumble I want to introduce myself I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>Steve we also have uh the um Wy talented</p>
<p>producer Terry but he refuses to come on</p>
<p>the air because he claims I&rsquo;m far more</p>
<p>handsome than he is so that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>humble admission from Terry uh but</p>
<p>anyway so uh you know we are going to</p>
<p>work with all of you that might be new</p>
<p>to the show on Rumble uh and take great</p>
<p>care of you your questions Etc Dr Berg</p>
<p>really pays attention to them he Combs</p>
<p>through them before and after the show</p>
<p>and I mean that to come up with fodder</p>
<p>for more videos so you&rsquo;ve got a great</p>
<p>resource here in drberg for all of those</p>
<p>that are joining new UN Rumble and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure that will be supported by all the</p>
<p>folks uh that routinely watch the show</p>
<p>and watch his videos on YouTube and</p>
<p>Facebook and once again we&rsquo;re an equal</p>
<p>opportunity broadcaster so whoever will</p>
<p>have his stuff gets a chance and if they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like it well guess what we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>other resources and we&rsquo;re so happy so</p>
<p>thank you Rumble for laying out the red</p>
<p>carpet for the show let&rsquo;s see I think we</p>
<p>got a little more time here how about ly</p>
<p>from Facebook could I be allergic to</p>
<p>eggs every time I eat eggs I get a spike</p>
<p>in my pulse rate also is green plantain</p>
<p>safe to eat on</p>
<p>keto</p>
<p>yes you can have an allergy or a</p>
<p>sensitivity to um eggs it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>going to be an allergy especially if</p>
<p>your pulse rate goes up that&rsquo;s one good</p>
<p>indication that there&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>allergic to it I would also try a high</p>
<p>quality egg just to see for the fun of</p>
<p>it if that&rsquo;s if you do better or worse</p>
<p>with that um and then the plantains I I</p>
<p>if you know you could try it out make</p>
<p>sure you just count your carbs on your</p>
<p>net carbs on that to make sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not overdoing it um but there&rsquo;s a bit of</p>
<p>starch in those plantains so there are</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called resistant starches and</p>
<p>green um bananas and things like that I</p>
<p>have done videos on that I I really um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced that it doesn&rsquo;t affect</p>
<p>your blood sugars I&rsquo;m not convinced yet</p>
<p>of that it&rsquo;s still one of those areas</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really I&rsquo;ve not had enough experience or</p>
<p>evidence to say that that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>really be good to go ahead and hey yeah</p>
<p>start having green bananas you know and</p>
<p>having some of these resistant starches</p>
<p>and uh I I think they also create a lot</p>
<p>of digestive issues um because you guess</p>
<p>what the microbes have to deal with them</p>
<p>too and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>uh problems with fermentation in your</p>
<p>gut when you consume them so yeah I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t go Hog Wild with those things</p>
<p>okay by the way this is sort of a neat</p>
<p>thing to wrap up on I think medic from</p>
<p>Rumble this guy is worth following I</p>
<p>assume he&rsquo;s talking about you I went</p>
<p>from 48 in Waist to a 32in waist Dr Berg</p>
<p>gave me what I needed to change my life</p>
<p>without drugs that my physician wanted</p>
<p>me on so there you have it take it from</p>
<p>medic from Rumble um you know I think</p>
<p>that is um you know fabulous</p>
<p>acknowledgement of what we all know who</p>
<p>have worked with Dr Berg for some</p>
<p>time awesome thank you so much for your</p>
<p>attention this thus far um stay tuned</p>
<p>for some very interesting content coming</p>
<p>coming up this next week have a</p>
<p>wonderful weekend and we&rsquo;ll see you real</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>soon</p>
<p>that</p>
