    <p>I can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s on your hat. What does it say? Super gut?</p>
<p>One of my most exciting companies called Oh, hollow.</p>
<p>Oh, Mahalo. I still have Mahalo calm.</p>
<p>No, not Mahalo. Unrelated, completely unrelated, nothing whatsoever to do with Mahalo.</p>
<p>I remember Mahalo great product. Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>become up against, you know, we were making $10 million in revenue at the peak.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And 100 people writing, like human curated search result pages.</p>
<p>I remember that.</p>
<p>Look at chat. You&rsquo;re doing so well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a great guy to reference the chat GPT thing coming out of that.</p>
<p>Well, then what happened was they did the panda update and we went from 10 million down to</p>
<p>500,000 in revenue overnight.</p>
<p>What was the panda update?</p>
<p>They looked at who the top sites were, ehow, Mahalo, etc. And they just said,</p>
<p>nobody can get any more than this amount of traffic. And they literally throttled the</p>
<p>number of unique users they would send to you. And that was it game over. And then everybody I</p>
<p>knew at Google wouldn&rsquo;t return my emails. And they were like, we don&rsquo;t have partnerships</p>
<p>with anybody. That&rsquo;s what Matt Cutts told me.</p>
<p>Are you saying that Mahalo&rsquo;s lack of success had nothing to do with a poor product</p>
<p>and execution? It was Google&rsquo;s malfeasance.</p>
<p>It got really rave reviews. It was backed by Sequoia.</p>
<p>So did the movie, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know, when you build a company that gets to 10 million in revenue in 18 months,</p>
<p>you can talk to them. But basically looking at your resume here,</p>
<p>I see that you&rsquo;ve created nothing in your entire career.</p>
<p>When you get in the arena, the arena, and you actually build a product,</p>
<p>then you can talk to me. I had the number one blog in the world, one of the top five tech</p>
<p>magazines in the world. And this is the number one tech and business podcast.</p>
<p>So good. I touched a soft spot. I got to the warm underbelly there.</p>
<p>Jake House so rarely goes after Chamath when he does. It&rsquo;s just gold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking to three founders here, Chamath. You&rsquo;re the odd person out.</p>
<p>So when you want to talk about product, then make one.</p>
<p>Okay. So gross. And yet I&rsquo;m the richest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so tilting. It must tilt you.</p>
<p>Totally fine. So&rsquo;s Kim Jong-un. So&rsquo;s Putin. Okay. There&rsquo;s a lot of rich people in the world,</p>
<p>but these are three product. Okay. Dictator. There&rsquo;s your cold open. Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s get started, everybody. It&rsquo;s been a big week. There&rsquo;s a lot to talk about.</p>
<p>Might be a little bit of a controversial spicy agenda today here on the all in podcast with me</p>
<p>again, the Sultan of science, who is tearing up the YouTube comments, everybody asking the Sultan</p>
<p>of silence to contribute more and to speak more. But when he does speak, my Lord, he drops those</p>
<p>knowledge bombs. How are you doing? Sultan of science. I&rsquo;m hanging in there. You&rsquo;re hanging</p>
<p>in there. Okay. Well, I&rsquo;m hanging in there, man. A few words, I guess. Hanging in there. Okay,</p>
<p>great. With us again, of course, another Android, David Sachs. Sachs, how are you doing?</p>
<p>I am doing fine. How are you? Wait, let me ask GPT. What&rsquo;s the question?</p>
<p>How are you doing? Let me ask it. Hold on. Let me see what it says.</p>
<p>I mean, basically chat GPT four is the ultimate Asperger&rsquo;s equalizer.</p>
<p>You guys are going to benefit most from this. I asked it. How are you? It says,</p>
<p>as an AI language model, I don&rsquo;t have feelings or consciousness, so I don&rsquo;t experience emotions</p>
<p>or states of being like a human does. However, I&rsquo;m here and ready to help you with any</p>
<p>questions or topics you&rsquo;d like to discuss. How can I assist you today?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty similar to how you feel, except you don&rsquo;t offer to help anybody. Okay. Also with us</p>
<p>is the dictator himself. I&rsquo;m here to talk about topics.</p>
<p>Looking forward to today&rsquo;s episode. And with us, the dictator with a shockingly,</p>
<p>shockingly low cut. There&rsquo;s only one button on the shirt.</p>
<p>Only one button. Okay. Made from a tiny albino baby.</p>
<p>Right here, they were like, should we put buttons in there? Like,</p>
<p>wipe the buttons. Wipe the buttons. It&rsquo;s a button conservation movement.</p>
<p>Exactly. No, no, no, no. The one button is what counts. That is a baby</p>
<p>albino rhinoceros that was killed, fed to Chamath on his vacation, and then</p>
<p>attached to his linen shirt. I guess let&rsquo;s just get this out of the way. Trump was</p>
<p>arraigned, I guess is the term. He was charged in New York with 34 felony counts of falsifying</p>
<p>business records. Alvin Bragg alleged Trump orchestrated a catch and kill scheme as well</p>
<p>to suppress damaging information before the 2016 election. Of course, Trump pleaded not guilty and</p>
<p>did a feisty press conference or speech rally at Mar-a-Lago after that. Prosecutors say the scheme</p>
<p>involved falsifying business records to conceal payments to Stormy Daniels. We know all that.</p>
<p>Same thing Michael Cohen went to jail for. The indictment wasn&rsquo;t a speaking indictment,</p>
<p>where it explained all the details. So Alvin Bragg hasn&rsquo;t tipped his cards by explaining in detail</p>
<p>what the legal theories are and which information he has. And he was pretty clear about that,</p>
<p>that he was not going to tip his cards, which makes this even more</p>
<p>hard to understand what&rsquo;s going on and creates even more divisiveness.</p>
<p>Predictably, the right is framing this as a witch hunt. But surprisingly, many on the left,</p>
<p>including former SDNY head Preet Bharara of the amazing podcast, Stay Tuned with Preet,</p>
<p>which I love. He felt this was the weakest of the four major investigations that Trump</p>
<p>is under. And he expressed some concerns on his podcast that it was light and not detailed.</p>
<p>And he might have not actually pursued this unless he had a 99% or something like that</p>
<p>chance, because it is the president&rsquo;s sacks, I guess, everybody&rsquo;s expecting us to fight over</p>
<p>this, but to just be a little preemptive here, as much as I think Trump is like the most unethical</p>
<p>person to ever hold the office, this does seem a little light. And I&rsquo;m hoping Bragg has the goods</p>
<p>on him, because why bring a misdemeanor case? You know, and these are all, I guess, misdemeanors</p>
<p>that are being elevated to felonies because of tax evasion, possibly or election interference. So</p>
<p>what are you, a steel man, or just generally speak about the case here? Because I know that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a man of law and order. Well, many people on the left are criticizing this case. Jonathan</p>
<p>Chait, who&rsquo;s a liberal writer for the New York Magazine, wrote a good column about it. And look,</p>
<p>here are the reasons why. Number one, the underlying behavior here is that Trump engaged</p>
<p>in a private settlement with Stormy Daniels. That&rsquo;s not illegal. Even if it is, you know,</p>
<p>so-called hush money, that is legal. You&rsquo;re allowed to do that.</p>
<p>Number two is that he used personal funds to do it. He did not use campaign funds.</p>
<p>And this is why Alvin Bragg has had to make this kind of distorted, ridiculous claim that he should</p>
<p>have used campaign funds to do it. But does anyone believe that if Trump had used campaign funds,</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t be alleged as the crime? So he&rsquo;s kind of damned if he does, damned if he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>here. I think that, you know, what the law is trying to do with these rules around campaign</p>
<p>funds is protect donors from candidates misappropriating them. And Trump had every</p>
<p>right to use personal funds to engage in the settlement. It&rsquo;s a major distortion of campaign</p>
<p>finance rules. Third, these campaign finance rules are federal laws. They&rsquo;re not state laws. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not up to Alvin Bragg to enforce them. And in fact, the feds looked at this and decided not</p>
<p>to prosecute it because if they did, they&rsquo;d have to enforce similar laws against Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Recall that Hillary Clinton had a problem where she used campaign funds to fund the payment to</p>
<p>Christopher Steele to write the Steele dossier. And that was a real problem. And it was miscategorized</p>
<p>as legal fees. And she had to pay a fine for that. But no one talked about locking her up over it.</p>
<p>And no one was talking about, you know, indicting her and sending her to jail.</p>
<p>And so part of the reason why I think the feds didn&rsquo;t want to look at this is because they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have to look at similar cases that are even more egregious. And then finally, the last thing is</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re well past the statute of limitations on this whole matter. So Alvin Bragg is really out</p>
<p>here on a limb. He&rsquo;s past the statute of limitations. He&rsquo;s enforcing laws that are not his business to</p>
<p>enforce. They&rsquo;re distorted interpretations of those laws. And the underlying conduct here is</p>
<p>fully legal. So I think everybody is kind of like wondering why he&rsquo;s doing this. And I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two theories. Either Alvin Bragg is incredibly stupid.</p>
<p>Aaron Powell, which he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Or he&rsquo;s incredibly smart. And the sort of three-dimensional chess explanation that</p>
<p>Ann Coulter has is that this is all a giant honeypot for Republicans because they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>rallying around Trump here because they perceive, I think correctly, that he&rsquo;s being railroaded and</p>
<p>he is the victim of a political prosecution. But in rallying around him to defend him,</p>
<p>you see that Trump&rsquo;s poll ratings among Republicans in the primary are going through the</p>
<p>roof. DeSantis&rsquo; are going down. And so what Ann Coulter fears is that this is all an elaborate</p>
<p>ruse to make Trump the nominee because Biden would much rather face a re-election against Trump than</p>
<p>against a young, youthful, vigorous governor like a DeSantis.</p>
<p>Do you think Bragg has a bunch of more information and maybe that tax evasion is the issue he&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>after? Because that seems to be the other theory here is he&rsquo;s not going to do the federal election</p>
<p>stuff. He&rsquo;s going to go after the tax evasion, which is what they already got the Trump organization</p>
<p>on when Wiesel, I guess the CFO, is going to jail for six months.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be hard to connect the dots on these things.</p>
<p>And they did 1.6 million. Fine for that company. Go ahead, Shma.</p>
<p>These are misdemeanor crimes. And to convert them to a felony, the crime needs to have been done</p>
<p>in the process of aiding and abetting another crime.</p>
<p>And tax evasion is the concept here.</p>
<p>When he listed the bullet point list of all of the reasons that are all of his evidence,</p>
<p>it seemed to point to what David said, which was just these campaign finance violations.</p>
<p>This whole thing just seems like such an enormous waste of time. Just think about</p>
<p>the amount of money that will have to be spent on just securing New York City every time he shows up</p>
<p>the five car motorcades, the Secret Service, the police, the this, the that, the disruption to</p>
<p>people for what really, ultimately, I think is right is kind of like, you know, it&rsquo;s a bit of</p>
<p>like, man, this case should have been brought years ago. Well, not at all.</p>
<p>In relation to that, they were told to stand down from doing that because of the</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t indict a sitting president. And that&rsquo;s paused. So that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>legal theory that&rsquo;s going to have to be tested.</p>
<p>Jason, the feds looked at this years ago, and they decided not to press charges.</p>
<p>They were told to not do it because he was a sitting president. No, they were.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s been out of office now for a couple of years. Why didn&rsquo;t they move forward?</p>
<p>They were. That was the process they were doing. So that&rsquo;s been established.</p>
<p>The previous DA said he was told to stand down because the pressure was in office.</p>
<p>Cyrus Vance decided not to prosecute on the same underlying offenses.</p>
<p>That was his decision. He decided not to. Who told him to stand down? No one could</p>
<p>tell him to stand down. Yeah, the office of&hellip;</p>
<p>Cyrus Vance decided not to move forward with this very same case</p>
<p>when the statute of limitations had not expired. Now it has, and Alvin Bragg&rsquo;s moved forward.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, you really have to stretch here to come up with any kind of plausibility to this</p>
<p>case. And I mean, you have to wonder why he&rsquo;s doing it. Is it just naked partisanship?</p>
<p>Or are they trying to make Trump the Republican nominee?</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s what Vance said on Meet the Press this weekend. I was asked</p>
<p>by the US Attorney&rsquo;s Office in the Southern District to stand down on the investigation.</p>
<p>And they were asked to stand down as well because of the&hellip; you can&rsquo;t indict a sitting president.</p>
<p>So anyway, all this stuff&rsquo;s going to get done in the wash. I don&rsquo;t think we have to spend too much</p>
<p>time on it because we&rsquo;ll find out, I think, in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Do the Democrats actually want him to get convicted? Then what? He&rsquo;s going to be under</p>
<p>house arrest in Mar-a-Lago because he&rsquo;s not going to be sent to jail. And then what? Then</p>
<p>DeSantis actually will win the nomination. So what exactly is the perfect outcome, which is to</p>
<p>create this theater, waste taxpayer resources only to have Trump acquitted just so that he</p>
<p>can win the nomination and then he can go against Biden and lose? This seems so far-fetched and</p>
<p>idiotic. Move on. Close this chapter and move on. Totally. This is ripping the country apart</p>
<p>for no reason and such a stupid case. Such a stupid case. Even the people who would like</p>
<p>to prosecute Trump, like you, Jason, I think have a problem with it. And one of the reasons why</p>
<p>this is going to be counterproductive even to the anti-Trump forces is that by going first with</p>
<p>this case, Alvin Bragg is poisoning the well for any future case he might bring against Trump.</p>
<p>Because now all future cases against Trump are going to be seen as painted with the same brush,</p>
<p>which is a nakedly partisan sort of witch hunt. And there may be other cases out there that have</p>
<p>more validity to them, but they&rsquo;re all going to be seen as of a piece with this sort of Alvin</p>
<p>Bragg prosecution. Yeah, that was pre-exposition. I think it&rsquo;s a logical one. I don&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>What do you think of the other three cases, January 6th, the interference in Georgia,</p>
<p>where they recorded him on tape, and then the stolen documents and the obstruction of justice?</p>
<p>Or do you think all four cases are politically motivated and none of them have any validity to</p>
<p>them, Sax? I mean, look, the question you have to ask is if Donald Trump was a private citizen</p>
<p>who never ran for president, would he be the target of any of these prosecutions? I mean,</p>
<p>he was, you know, a high profile business figure for decades and he wasn&rsquo;t prosecuted like this.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really the question you have to ask. And, you know, do we want to live-</p>
<p>Well, in this case, you actually had Cohen go to jail. Cohen did go to jail for the same crime,</p>
<p>so the answer is yes.</p>
<p>What? Michael Cohen wasn&rsquo;t prosecuted until after Trump was president, but-</p>
<p>No, what I&rsquo;m saying is, you asked if he was not president, if he would-</p>
<p>Do you really believe-</p>
<p>Let me finish. You asked if Trump was not a president, if he would have been prosecuted</p>
<p>for this crime. In fact, another person, Michael Cohen, was prosecuted for this crime and did</p>
<p>serve jail time. So the answer is yes, he would have been. And they brought these cases, this</p>
<p>banking kind of cases, and they brought the other one for the 1.6 million fine and Wieselberg going</p>
<p>to jail. So I think they would, actually. But anyway, my question to you is, of the other three,</p>
<p>are any- Do you think all four are politically motivated is my question to you? Or do you think</p>
<p>any of them have a literacy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to comment on the other cases until I see what cases actually made and what the</p>
<p>merits of them are. However, I don&rsquo;t believe that all these prosecutors all over the country</p>
<p>would be looking at Donald Trump this way if he was just a private citizen who never ran for</p>
<p>office. And I think we have a big problem in our political system when political disagreements are</p>
<p>criminalized. And this has been a nasty trend that&rsquo;s been going on for many years. It was</p>
<p>usually, I guess, practice against staffers. Here or there, you&rsquo;d have some executive branch</p>
<p>staffer would find themselves on the wrong end of a prosecution, and they&rsquo;d end up going to jail.</p>
<p>Maybe they get pardoned or not. But now it&rsquo;s reached all the way to the top. And you have</p>
<p>presidential candidates basically being prosecuted. And I do not believe they&rsquo;d be prosecuted if they</p>
<p>were not major political figures. And it looks really bad for the political figure who is leading</p>
<p>right now in the Republican Party to be Joe Biden&rsquo;s opponent in the next election to be</p>
<p>prosecuted by one of Joe Biden&rsquo;s political allies. I mean, if this were happening in some other</p>
<p>country, the United States would be criticizing it as some sort of Banana Republic type move.</p>
<p>So this is not the direction we want our politics to go. And look, I don&rsquo;t want Trump to be the</p>
<p>nominee. I support a different candidate. But I think that to be interfering in our elections,</p>
<p>for Alvin Bragg to be interfering in the political process this way is a reach, and it&rsquo;s setting a</p>
<p>horrible precedent for the future. I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about major presidential candidates</p>
<p>being prosecuted by local DAs. I mean, why would we want this?</p>
<p>So let me ask a follow up question then. The DOJ is currently investigating Hunter Biden,</p>
<p>and then obviously that goes up to the big guy with the 10%. Do you think the DOJ should be</p>
<p>investigating Hunter Biden? Or do you think we should be giving a pass to presidents and their</p>
<p>families? Well, the Hunter Biden case, I mean, this is one where you&rsquo;ve got foreign governments</p>
<p>basically paying off Hunter Biden for political access. Now, that may ultimately be legal because</p>
<p>I think influence peddling is kind of a business that takes place all over Washington. But that</p>
<p>actually does speak to the integrity of our political system. At the end of the day, would</p>
<p>I send Hunter Biden to jail? No, I don&rsquo;t think so. Like I said, I don&rsquo;t like criminalizing political</p>
<p>disagreements, but what Hunter Biden did was definitely pretty shady. And, you know, and</p>
<p>I think these are two of the&hellip; Hunter Biden and Trump and his family are both shady is my feeling</p>
<p>on it. We got to get better candidates in here. Nikki Haley, your candidate, Chamath, raised $11</p>
<p>million last week. She&rsquo;s on fire. Freeberg, you want to jump into this and touch the third rail?</p>
<p>You want us to move on? Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>All right. So there&rsquo;s been a lot of Twitter back and forth about the de-dollarization.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s real, if it&rsquo;s happening, if it&rsquo;s not&hellip; Last week, China and Brazil struck a deal</p>
<p>to trade in their own currencies. The Brazilian government announced the two countries will no</p>
<p>longer use the US dollar as an intermediary. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s for everything they trade</p>
<p>or for certain things they&rsquo;re trading. It&rsquo;ll be a straight one for Reaiz trade. China is the</p>
<p>top US rival, obviously, and Brazil is one of the largest economies in Latin America.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Generally speaking, Freeberg, I know that you have some</p>
<p>exposure here, you know, with your company that I think you spacked recently,</p>
<p>and you have some knowledge of the space, right?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, China and Brazil are pretty sizable trade partners.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s around $150 billion a year of bilateral trade. So China historically has</p>
<p>made a lot of investments through their companies in railways, infrastructure, waterways, ports,</p>
<p>and infrastructure to support the agriculture manufacturing economies in Brazil. And it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very deep tie. Obviously, the closeness of that relationship, China became a bigger trading</p>
<p>partner for Brazil in 2009, surpassing the US. By the way, China has had similar trading strategies</p>
<p>in Africa, in Australia, they&rsquo;ve bought several companies in Australia, they&rsquo;ve made massive</p>
<p>infrastructure investments. The currency of trade is one element of a broader intertwining</p>
<p>that China has kind of enabled by using its resources to invest in infrastructure development</p>
<p>and then participating in the economic value and gain that arises from that. It still also</p>
<p>supports the local country, the local population, the local economies in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth noting that the anti globalization moment that we&rsquo;re having in the US,</p>
<p>and it may be a longer term trend, doesn&rsquo;t mean that globalization and global trade is going to</p>
<p>slow down between China and other really important well resourced nations around the world. So the</p>
<p>Brazil China summit that happened a week ago, where a lot of Brazilian executives went to China</p>
<p>and had a very deep set of dialogues, but they also signed a ton of agreements on trade.</p>
<p>And also in some of those cases, the trade being done in non US dollar denominated currency</p>
<p>is worth noting as being that if the US does continue to push for de globalization,</p>
<p>we can only leverage our side of those relationships, China will continue to make</p>
<p>investments continue to develop trade and continue to develop really deep tie ins</p>
<p>with countries around the world. From a resource perspective, from an economic perspective,</p>
<p>and ultimately, the leverage will sit with them on what currency folks are going to trade in.</p>
<p>So you know what we&rsquo;re seeing with the China Saudi discussion around the Petro Yuan,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t seem to be really a standard thing yet. But we&rsquo;re starting to see inklings of some</p>
<p>deals happening in Yuan, but it&rsquo;s more related to the depth of the Chinese trade relationship</p>
<p>with all these nations around the world. So the more we kind of as the US think we want to</p>
<p>de globalize and reduce our trade relationships with other nations,</p>
<p>the more you know, we&rsquo;re out of the way and allowing China to do that. I think it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>observing that the Chinese economy will grow the depth of their relationships will grow potentially,</p>
<p>the strength and importance of their currency will continue to mount as they build these really deep</p>
<p>infrastructure and investment tie ins around the world.</p>
<p>Chamath, what does a party trading in one do with the one? Do they buy a bunch of stuff from</p>
<p>China? What happens to the one? Yeah,</p>
<p>this whole thing is a huge nothing burger. This is the third deal that China has done. The other</p>
<p>two countries are Pakistan and Brazil. And the reason why is I&rsquo;ve seen like people on Twitter</p>
<p>now breathlessly rambling on about de dollarization and all of this stuff. And</p>
<p>I think if any of these people would think from first principles, the first thing that you would</p>
<p>know is that the yuan is pegged to the US dollar. And so as long as it&rsquo;s pegged, whether you trade</p>
<p>through the US dollar, or you don&rsquo;t, and you directly go to yuan, your index to the US dollar,</p>
<p>and then you use a dollar swap to convert it into the currency you need. So I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think this is kind of like a lot of folks who don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>What do you think about the depth of China&rsquo;s trade relationship? So forget about the</p>
<p>denomination of the currency. But the fact that the statistic now is that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>try to get a top trading partner with 120 countries. You know, they surpassed the US</p>
<p>with many of these countries over the last, you know, decade or two in particular,</p>
<p>and continue to increase the scale relative to the US where we&rsquo;re kind of decreasing our</p>
<p>dependence on on nations and reducing our trading. The reason why China has had</p>
<p>so much dominance as a trading partner, and the reason why China&rsquo;s central bank has the largest</p>
<p>amount of foreign US dollar reserves, about three and a half trillion dollars, is exactly because</p>
<p>of the thing that you want to ignore in order to have this highfalutin intellectual conversation.</p>
<p>It is pegged to the US dollar. And until it is unpegged in a free floating currency,</p>
<p>we will never know what the real market clearing price is. And just China has been able to hold</p>
<p>on China has been very effectively able to manipulate this currency. Since they were</p>
<p>brought into the WTO. In order to engender that trading partner status, they were able to</p>
<p>artificially suppress the value of their currency, so that exports from China could gain</p>
<p>traction in countries all around the world, you have to take into account this currency peg.</p>
<p>And you have to ask the question, where would the currency be if it wasn&rsquo;t free floating? And</p>
<p>then what would the incentives be for folks to replace the dollar? And I think that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of interesting questions are that are worth asking. But I think you have to be a little bit</p>
<p>more intellectually honest to have the discussion. And just for clarity, Chamath, you said they</p>
<p>already have these deals with Pakistan and Pakistan, Russia, you met Pakistan and Russia,</p>
<p>I think they already have those deals with those two Pakistan and Russia.</p>
<p>Right. Okay, good. I just want to make sure it&rsquo;s clear there.</p>
<p>Sachs, do you have any thoughts on this? Is this an example of people just maybe</p>
<p>taking the Ray Dalio book and it fits a certain narrative and overhyping it? Or do you think</p>
<p>this is an actual real trend in the world to be concerned about?</p>
<p>I think D dollarization hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. But I think it&rsquo;s a risk. And I think there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>of reasons why the risk is growing. So first of all, we have $32 trillion in debt,</p>
<p>someone has to finance that debt. And the bigger that number gets, the more unattractive our debt</p>
<p>is, because they have to be concerned that we&rsquo;re eventually going to monetize the debt,</p>
<p>pay it back by printing a bunch of new dollars. So that&rsquo;s point number one is we have these massive</p>
<p>deficits and debts. Number two is that we have, I think, in the last couple of years,</p>
<p>really weaponized the dollar. So if you look at like what we&rsquo;ve done with Ukraine and Russia,</p>
<p>we basically seized hundreds of billions of dollars of Russian reserves that were held in</p>
<p>dollars. We&rsquo;ve excluded them from the swift banking system. We&rsquo;ve imposed massive sanctions</p>
<p>on them. And in fact, we now have sanctions on a huge number of countries all over the world. So</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very sanctioned happy, all of which makes these countries view the dollar as an unreliable</p>
<p>store of value, why would you store your money in something that can be taken away by the US,</p>
<p>and specifically by the State Department. So I think this is a major change in the way that</p>
<p>we view the dollar the last couple of years is we&rsquo;re going to use it as a weapon that again,</p>
<p>that makes it view that&rsquo;s not the first time we&rsquo;ve ever done that, right? We&rsquo;ve done sanctions</p>
<p>against many different. We&rsquo;ve done sanctions. But as far as I know, we&rsquo;ve never seized foreign</p>
<p>currency reserves and excluded a country from SWIFT, which is the banking system. So as an</p>
<p>instrument of US foreign policy. So I mean, I could be wrong about that. But this was a major</p>
<p>event when it happened. Remember, we also did stuff like seize the the yachts and the foreign</p>
<p>holdings of Russian oligarchs. Remember their ill gotten gains, we suddenly decided they were</p>
<p>all gotten. Let me tell you, we didn&rsquo;t think they were ill gotten when those Russian billionaires</p>
<p>were buying those yachts or buying New York real estate or London real estate or investing in</p>
<p>Facebook or investing in companies here or buying sports teams or what have you. So hold on, we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think they were ill gotten at the time that they were actually made and spent. But we</p>
<p>decided subsequently, we&rsquo;re just going to seize those things. Well, again, if you are a foreign</p>
<p>country, or a wealthy person in a foreign country, or just trying to decide where you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>keep your money, you may not want it to be liable to the vagaries of US foreign policy.</p>
<p>So I think all these things do matter. And when you&rsquo;re running the kind of debt and deficits we</p>
<p>have, and you&rsquo;re making the US dollar less attractive, you are running a risk. I mean,</p>
<p>as we should be keeping people we have disagreements with on the dollar standard,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s good in terms of power for us, which I think opens us up to a broader discussion.</p>
<p>Okay, just to clarify this, it&rsquo;s not even the dollar standard, right? Like what this deal was,</p>
<p>is to use this thing called sips and sips is the non dollar competitor to swift. And so you settle</p>
<p>right across, let&rsquo;s just say you have two trading partners in two completely different countries</p>
<p>that use a bank in each of their local areas. They typically swap the dollars and then they transfer</p>
<p>right using this this backbone of the financial infrastructure called swift.</p>
<p>China has built a competitor to it called sips CPS. And China has been going around and signing</p>
<p>folks up makes a ton of sense, right? Hey, listen, if we&rsquo;re trading between each other,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just use that. So I think it&rsquo;s important to not paint this with more of a brush than it</p>
<p>should be. I&rsquo;m not saying that D dollar ization couldn&rsquo;t happen. I just think that everybody</p>
<p>tries to take one random data point and conflate it all together to reinforce or a Dahlia point</p>
<p>from book three years ago, I do think there&rsquo;s a group of catastrophists who maybe are maybe</p>
<p>hoping this happens or it&rsquo;s a great Twitter fodder. I think we are headed for some sort</p>
<p>of government debt crisis. I said that there&rsquo;s gonna be three prongs to this financial crisis.</p>
<p>One was these long dated bonds having unrealized losses, which is causing problems in regional</p>
<p>community banks. The second piece of it&rsquo;s the commercial real estate crisis, which I think is</p>
<p>metastasizing right now, which is also going to be a banking crisis once all those unrealized</p>
<p>losses come to you. And the third piece of it is government debt crisis, we have</p>
<p>this $32 trillion debt that we&rsquo;re now having to refinance at much higher interest rates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read somewhere that half our government debt, so 16 billion is going to come due 16,</p>
<p>sorry, trillion. Yeah. And it&rsquo;s gonna have to be refinanced in the next three years,</p>
<p>the average rate on that debt is 1.7%. Well, if you want to refinance it at 10 year rates,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be looking at somewhere between three and a half or 4%, maybe more.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking at a doubling of the interest costs. And I also read that by 2030, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have over a trillion dollars of interest expense owed by the US government every year.</p>
<p>That is money that&rsquo;s not funding anyone&rsquo;s social security, it&rsquo;s not funding anyone&rsquo;s healthcare,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not funding one weapons program, it&rsquo;s not funding anything we want. It&rsquo;s this the VIG,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be more than a quarter of our total federal budget.</p>
<p>Yeah. And this is where you start gambling. When you&rsquo;re chasing that VIG payment,</p>
<p>you start taking risks.</p>
<p>This is also where you have to expect the Fed will really want inflation to stay high. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of what we&rsquo;ve said before, the only way out of this mathematically is to keep rates high.</p>
<p>But the other thing, David, that you when you mentioned all of this is,</p>
<p>what about every other country? If you think that&rsquo;s happening in the United States,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to make sure we at least consider every other major economy,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not as if they&rsquo;re pristinely sitting on the sidelines. While this happens to the US,</p>
<p>this is my whole argument the whole time, which is if you&rsquo;re going to have this argument,</p>
<p>you need to do it thoughtfully and relatively, right, because the euro is in the same amount</p>
<p>of trouble. If you look across, it&rsquo;s not as if China is actually sitting pretty and smelling</p>
<p>like roses, either. Every major economy or trading block in the world is going to go through this at</p>
<p>the same time. So it becomes a relative trade argument. And there, I just don&rsquo;t know enough to</p>
<p>know whether the US is poorly positioned versus Europe or China. But it just seems like you get</p>
<p>back to a place where it&rsquo;s like, okay, we need to find the flight to safety. What is the canonical</p>
<p>flight to safety? If it&rsquo;s not a commodity like gold, it&rsquo;s probably the dollar until it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, free bird. Obviously, other countries have even more acute problems,</p>
<p>higher debt to GB GDP, which means higher debt payments. Just rounding third here on this issue.</p>
<p>Any final thoughts on the dollarization and servicing our debt?</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re in trouble. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s unclear the timing and the path. But</p>
<p>the arithmetic is pretty simple. In addition to the point sacks made, you guys saw the news,</p>
<p>the city of Chicago has a $44 billion pension hole. That&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg on</p>
<p>unfunded pension liabilities from both state government, city government, even private</p>
<p>institutions. This is, again, hundreds of millions of people worldwide that are expecting money</p>
<p>coming to them from institutions that ultimately the federal government of the US is likely going</p>
<p>to have to backstop to some degree. So that&rsquo;s another huge check that&rsquo;s going to need to be</p>
<p>written that the federal government is inevitably going to have to write because we&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>just let all these people have no money and become starving. And Social Security right now is</p>
<p>projected to go bankrupt sometime between 2030 and 2035. So we&rsquo;re gonna have to write a check</p>
<p>to cover the hole there. Plus, the interest payment checks.</p>
<p>So much points freeberg of like,</p>
<p>relative to other societies, other countries.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the very likely case is that relative wealth will decline.</p>
<p>So in the near term, I think it&rsquo;s inevitable we have higher tax rates. I&rsquo;ve said this before,</p>
<p>because in order to kind of meet the gap, even if we have these austerity measures,</p>
<p>or reduce costs or reduce the budget as the republicans are going to push for is this debt</p>
<p>ceiling debate reaches its apex in 60 days from now, which you better believe this is going to be</p>
<p>pretty, pretty damn dramatic. And there&rsquo;s going to be real questions of what happens if the US</p>
<p>defaults on its treasuries. If the US defaults on obligations it has on treasuries, there will be</p>
<p>a real shift away from using those assets as the baseline of the risk free rate worldwide,</p>
<p>what the net what the other thing will be, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll speak about the challenges I</p>
<p>see with Bitcoin. You know, if we want to at some point, Oh, did you hit a million yet?</p>
<p>But if you put all of this together, you&rsquo;re gonna have to source income somewhere, you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to take a piece of the assets and a piece of the income away from the private citizenry. So you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to tax and that tax will be used to kind of fill some of the hole. And then more of</p>
<p>the hole will be filled by printing money. And that will lead to this kind of inflation of asset</p>
<p>values, which ultimately means that the relative cost of things go up and relative wealth goes</p>
<p>down. And I think that&rsquo;s the point to take note is that anyone who&rsquo;s concentrated assets is going</p>
<p>to have them effectively lost in the washout. Zach, you want to add?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I just want to add a couple of details there, because</p>
<p>Freeberg went pretty quickly over a couple of those examples. So just to take that,</p>
<p>that Chicago case, the numbers I saw in an article this week, I think it was in the Wall</p>
<p>Street Journal was that 80% of the property taxes in Chicago are now going just to pay for pensions.</p>
<p>So 80% are going to pay former workers, not current city workers. And moreover,</p>
<p>those pensions are only 25% funded. So they&rsquo;ve already over promised by 75%</p>
<p>benefits that they can&rsquo;t afford. How is this going to work? And you saw that we just had an election</p>
<p>there. And rather than fix the problem, they voted for a candidate, Brandon Johnson, who is even</p>
<p>softer on crime than Lori Lightfoot. And the reason for that is because the government workers unions</p>
<p>basically all supported him. So you have a situation in these blue cities and states where</p>
<p>there is a massive civil service. They are the strongest special interest in local and state</p>
<p>politics. They have already taken huge appropriations out of the state budget in the</p>
<p>form of these pensions, which aren&rsquo;t even adequately funded, we can barely afford them as</p>
<p>they are. Should we have pension sacks? What do you think? Should we just have people doing 401Ks?</p>
<p>Sure. So what happened in the 1980s, when there was a lot of pension reform,</p>
<p>in the private sectors, you move from defined benefit to define contribution.</p>
<p>So you start having more defined contribution like 401K. The way that these public pensions</p>
<p>work is defined benefit. So what they&rsquo;ll do is they&rsquo;ll say that we&rsquo;re going to take your last</p>
<p>year of employment with the city or state. And whatever the amount of money was you made that</p>
<p>last year, you&rsquo;re going to get 80% or 90% of it for the rest of your not just your life, but your</p>
<p>spouse&rsquo;s life too. And moreover, any overtime you earned becomes part of that calculation.</p>
<p>So everyone knows this game. And so what you see is in their final year,</p>
<p>state or city employees will load up on the overtime, they&rsquo;ll earn twice as much,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll get 90% of that. They get 90% of that for the rest of them and their spouse&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>We just can&rsquo;t afford to have rules like that that don&rsquo;t make any sense. And so, but the point is</p>
<p>that the benefit that&rsquo;s been defined bears no relationship to the amount of money that&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>into these pensions, right? And so you have a huge solution here, you have a huge unfunded</p>
<p>liability. Yeah. But to free burst point, every blue city and state in the country</p>
<p>is going to have this problem. And who&rsquo;s going to pick up these expenses,</p>
<p>you bring up great points, but you just mash them all together in this</p>
<p>mashed potato of random things like unfunded pension liabilities, you want remember,</p>
<p>realize trading, and they&rsquo;re like the same thing. They&rsquo;re not the same thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re driven by totally different, but we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>throw them in this like, all this debt, amalgam soup, and outcomes. So I&rsquo;m just saying like,</p>
<p>if these are important topics, but I&rsquo;m just saying, I do think they&rsquo;re motivated by totally</p>
<p>different things. And they&rsquo;re not related as much as we think they are related.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re related. Let me walk you through how they&rsquo;re related. Okay,</p>
<p>I want to hear how the Ray eyes you want trade is connected to the Chicago pension system,</p>
<p>the holes need to be filled. So the money is not going to just not get paid to the pensioners,</p>
<p>social security is not going to go away. Just like we saw in France. If you start to do that,</p>
<p>you have revolutions in the street. There&rsquo;s literally bonfires at intersections in France</p>
<p>in Paris today, because people don&rsquo;t want to wait another two years before they get their pension</p>
<p>payments. So ultimately, that check has to be written. When you add up the column of how much</p>
<p>money is not on the balance sheet today, how much liability is not on the balance sheet today,</p>
<p>that is ultimately going to have to get paid out. And the US government is going to print money to</p>
<p>pay it out. It indicates that there is a higher degree of uncertainty on whether or not I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually going to get the value back for the bonds that I&rsquo;m buying in US dollar denominated form,</p>
<p>or that the US dollar is actually going to be strong enough to cover the cost or has enough</p>
<p>kind of, you know, or has too much volatility, because of this uncertainty. And I think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really where people start to say, well, maybe the US dollar isn&rsquo;t that risk free rate,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a strong economy with a great balance sheet, great economic growth, there&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>extraordinary potential because of the freedoms that we have to operate in this country as</p>
<p>individuals, through the enterprise, through the innovation, through the entrepreneurship,</p>
<p>through the attraction of talent from all over the world to come here. But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>we do seem to have a very big set of checks that we&rsquo;re gonna have to write. And as those, you know,</p>
<p>liabilities start to mount, there becomes a real question on Do I really want to hold dollars?</p>
<p>Maybe I want to hold something else. And maybe I diversify a little bit. And maybe instead of</p>
<p>holding just dollars, I also hold other things. And as that starts to happen, you see a little</p>
<p>bit of a shift. It&rsquo;s not an overnight thing. It&rsquo;s all catastrophic one or the other. But it starts</p>
<p>to bring into question whether the US dollar is the standard de facto system that&rsquo;s used for trade</p>
<p>around the world. That&rsquo;s the point. And sacks, there is a solution to this superannuation is</p>
<p>done in the UK and in Australia, where you contribute, you&rsquo;re forced to contribute to</p>
<p>your 401k, essentially, but you get to learn how to put money away, and you become a little more.</p>
<p>You have a little more authority over your future with these pensions where you&rsquo;re responsible for</p>
<p>saving and you&rsquo;re kind of forced to save. And it seems to have worked really well in Australia</p>
<p>and other places where people have great savings. And you don&rsquo;t have this major debt load by the</p>
<p>government doing it. So it&rsquo;s something for people to look into. Sacks, did you want to add anything</p>
<p>to this? Because I think we&rsquo;ve beaten this one to death. Just make it quick.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve necessarily beaten it to death, because I think it is a huge issue. I</p>
<p>mean, look, the part of Chamath&rsquo;s argument that I agree with is that you do have to evaluate</p>
<p>the dollar on relative terms. And you can argue that the US and the dollar, it&rsquo;s still the,</p>
<p>you know, let&rsquo;s call it the most eligible bachelor in the leper colony.</p>
<p>You know, nothing started falling off on the man yet. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really good. That&rsquo;s really good. By the way, the first default</p>
<p>might be the noses fall. You know,</p>
<p>the economist Herb Stein once said that if something cannot go on forever, it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re doing right now cannot go on forever. We are running deficits and debts and unfunded</p>
<p>liabilities that we cannot afford. And so it will stop. And the only question is how it stops.</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s Yeah,</p>
<p>and it may stop in a way that is not vault. It&rsquo;s not a voluntary choice by us.</p>
<p>We crash the car, basically, guys want to make a bet a friendly wager for charity.</p>
<p>Oh, no, what happens in June? I&rsquo;ll make a bet with you guys.</p>
<p>June, you mean the debt ceiling?</p>
<p>Yeah. What do you guys think happens? You think this is going to be a</p>
<p>fractious chaotic thing where the markets get roiled?</p>
<p>No, I think is going to be a pretty</p>
<p>rubber stamp forward deal where they&rsquo;re gonna it&rsquo;s going to come down to the wire. But my</p>
<p>guess is no one&rsquo;s going to want to default on the debt. Yep. And there&rsquo;s going to be some</p>
<p>concessions on spending. And ultimately, the debt ceiling will get extended. And that those</p>
<p>concessions on spending will allow the Republican Party to save face with their voters and say,</p>
<p>look, we, we got some concessions here, I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;re going to be enough to really</p>
<p>address any of the major problems that the US is facing over the longer term.</p>
<p>But you know, certainly letting the</p>
<p>debt ceiling hit and defaulting is catastrophic. Everyone knows that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Freeberg. I think the majority case is a bunch of hand wringing, and then</p>
<p>they make a concession.</p>
<p>All the people that are interested in this topic, I would go use the Wayback Machine</p>
<p>and go and read all of the articles in the 80s, where you could replace China with Japan.</p>
<p>And what happened with Japan is that Japan just hit a demographic wall, not dissimilar to what</p>
<p>not dissimilar to what China is about to hit in the next 15 or 20 years.</p>
<p>Right? It&rsquo;s a good counter argument. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really good point. And I think that</p>
<p>there is this element of, you know, China as the primary threat. But I think the bigger problem,</p>
<p>Chamath is that we have voted ourselves into a stupor, we have allowed ourselves to accrue</p>
<p>these liabilities that are, in many cases, not on the balance sheet, that we simply cannot afford</p>
<p>to pay. And the social unrest that will arise with if and when we don&rsquo;t pay them, or the economic</p>
<p>cost of us actually paying them, either of those are going to be pretty significant. But that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>under that&rsquo;s water under the bridge. And it has nothing to do with China. It has just everything</p>
<p>to do with how the US is spending. Thank you for being intellectually honest. This is my point.</p>
<p>I agree with you about the importance of these unfunded liabilities. I just completely disagree</p>
<p>with you that this argument about these things being so hyper connected, or that all of a sudden,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at the cliff of D dollar ization. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s rooted in facts. And I think again,</p>
<p>it ignores this unbelievably important piece of logic that all of you guys that say this</p>
<p>tend to ignore. And it&rsquo;s still in it&rsquo;s not even well addressed in Dalio&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>which is it is a pegged currency. And the minute you unpack it, none of you know what happens to</p>
<p>it, except that it probably isn&rsquo;t where it&rsquo;s trading today. And if you actually then have</p>
<p>to factor in dollar reserves that everybody holds, that thing would skyrocket in value,</p>
<p>and it would crush the export value of the yuan. And it happens to all currencies. And this is</p>
<p>this funny thing that has happened to the United States, which is that it ran forward, and it</p>
<p>transitioned its economy to a service led economy faster than other countries and other economies</p>
<p>and other currencies did. And nobody wants to just talk about that. Except if we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>that sort of drives us. Good sex. I don&rsquo;t think the big risk is that all of a sudden, the dollar</p>
<p>gets replaced by the yuan as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency. I think Freeberg lays out a more</p>
<p>intermediate path, which is people start to hedge their dollar exposure. And decisions that used to</p>
<p>be automatic, like trading oil and dollars, you know, the so called petrodollar now becomes a</p>
<p>little bit, you know, more of a decision. So you know, the sound happened, that&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>with the pound sterling. It was a similar story. And it was not an overnight collapse. I mean,</p>
<p>there were certainly these kind of punctuated moments where there were hits, but, you know,</p>
<p>the history is that there was a slow devaluation over time. And the, you know, as a result of</p>
<p>obviously, the economic pressure and uncertainty. No, what happened to pound sterling was that it</p>
<p>was pegged to the US dollar, and then it became unpegged. So exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about. No,</p>
<p>even post that, even post that if it&rsquo;s a free floating currency, yeah, you&rsquo;re proving my point</p>
<p>when Soros broke the back of the US dollar, what he forced George Brown, or what he forced the</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer to do was to basically depeg the pound. And then yes, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been like this ever since. Yeah, it was what I&rsquo;m saying was not if you let it be free</p>
<p>floating, nobody wants to trade in that other currency. Everybody wants the dollar.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s right, it is the the worst affected leper in the leper colony.</p>
<p>Yes. So in the colony, this is why you have to have if you&rsquo;re going to be intellectually honest,</p>
<p>just have a relative conversation about all of the currencies, and all the things that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also going through, which are also not not perfect, the debt payments for the emerging</p>
<p>and the frontier markets are extraordinary, just realize that if you want to go and peg your</p>
<p>economy to somebody else&rsquo;s back, they also come with their own trials and tribulations that you</p>
<p>have to risk manage as well. And now you have to decide on balance, do you want to risk manage</p>
<p>a centrally governed economy, right from a central bureau, or a freewheeling democratic,</p>
<p>like these are all the discussions that people should have. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of choices there</p>
<p>just back to the the non currency part of this for a second. There are a lot of like connections</p>
<p>between these things. I actually think there is a strong connection between what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>for example, in Chicago with the out of control civil service and unfunded pensions all the way</p>
<p>to the dollar status. But there&rsquo;s also a connection between commercial real estate</p>
<p>and these pensions. So on a previous show, we talked about the commercial real estate</p>
<p>looming crisis. And a lot of people thought that, you know, some of the comments were just talking</p>
<p>our book, which is not true, I don&rsquo;t own, I don&rsquo;t have a dollar invested in these office towers.</p>
<p>But you know, who does pension funds? Yes, who owns these office towers. So you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>pension funds that are three quarters unfunded. And they may have a lot less funds than they even</p>
<p>think they do, because we&rsquo;re about to have a huge reckoning, where all of a sudden, these</p>
<p>office towers that were supposed to be blue chip, that we&rsquo;re supposed to have the best collateral</p>
<p>there was in major American cities. Now, all of a sudden, they may not be nearly as valuable as</p>
<p>they thought they were. Yeah, and and if they don&rsquo;t own the building, they definitely own the</p>
<p>debt 100% for sure. In the fixed income portfolios of all these pension systems are the debt that</p>
<p>was used to finance these buildings by the REITs and by you know, the big real estate funds that</p>
<p>put those things together. So you&rsquo;re absolutely right. They are 100% impacted by what&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>to happen. We&rsquo;re not, we&rsquo;re not going to allow given the civil unrest and social unrest risk.</p>
<p>And obviously, as a democracy, we&rsquo;re not going to allow that all to go to zero. And we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to let pensioners not get paid. Ultimately, that&rsquo;s just a kiss of death. Maybe pension</p>
<p>payments are reduced to some degree. But again, Paris is a really great example of as you start</p>
<p>to try and shift the economic guarantees that have been made to pensioners even slightly.</p>
<p>Yeah, what was it two years in retirement? 60?</p>
<p>Yeah, and it was certainly like, you know, you could sit here and argue what people for years</p>
<p>for their whole life had this expectation set. We have all for our whole careers invested in</p>
<p>the Social Security benefits that were owed as retirees through every paycheck that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>received. And those Social Security payments may not end up coming back to us if Social Security</p>
<p>is allowed to go bankrupt. So ultimately, the government has to set step in and issue new</p>
<p>dollars to make that up. Then the economic question is what happens to the value of the</p>
<p>dollar, what happens to the value of the economy, and so on as you issue trillions of dollars to</p>
<p>fill these holes. Let me ask a question that&rsquo;s a little more positive here, perhaps.</p>
<p>Which is, is there a path out of this, you know, debt cycle we&rsquo;re in? And what are the</p>
<p>top ways in which we&rsquo;re going to get ourselves out of this? I have three that come off the top</p>
<p>of my head. Hold on, I have three off the top of my head. Number one is austerity measures. Number</p>
<p>two is productivity through technology. And perhaps number three is maybe recruiting more</p>
<p>entrepreneurs here to start more companies. And, you know, fill some of these jobs. So</p>
<p>intelligent immigration, which I want to hire taxes. Yeah, number one is higher taxes,</p>
<p>in terms of what&rsquo;s likely to happen. That would be a fourth one. That&rsquo;s outstanding.</p>
<p>Yeah. So look, higher taxes, because you can go after assets, you can go after well,</p>
<p>so there will be higher taxes. Okay. So I still think I still think we&rsquo;ll end up seeing 70%</p>
<p>tax rates on the wealthiest people 70%. I don&rsquo;t see I don&rsquo;t see it being like unpopular. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be unpopular with the wealthy, it&rsquo;s going to be popular elsewhere to fill the hole.</p>
<p>Second is cut back on spending. But that&rsquo;s a really hard thing to do. Because, you know,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about in the past, people vote to get more stuff. So you put the politician in</p>
<p>is going to vote to get you more stuff, you don&rsquo;t vote people in to go cut spending. So generally,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re going to likely see number one happened first, maybe there&rsquo;ll be a reckoning</p>
<p>where you kind of reduce spending, it&rsquo;s going to take extraordinary political will, and an</p>
<p>extraordinary depth of education and diffusion of understanding of this, this key critical economic</p>
<p>problem amongst the voting class, which is a really hard thing to realize. I think number</p>
<p>three, you&rsquo;re saying get the public to understand to understand that we have to have austerity</p>
<p>measures. Yeah, number three, and basically, people are going to have to make sacrifices.</p>
<p>So the first sacrifice will be the wealthy, they&rsquo;re going to have to sacrifice their higher</p>
<p>taxes. The second sacrifice will be everyone else by seeing reduced spending and reduced kind of</p>
<p>service, the services, etc. The third is the hopeful one, but we don&rsquo;t have a guarantee on</p>
<p>this, which is do we see economic growth through productivity gains? Can we create leverage with</p>
<p>our resources and our people by using new technologies to get more with less? And you</p>
<p>know, anytime? Yeah, like, again, I gave the example last time, but when a tractor was introduced in</p>
<p>agriculture, all the people that were farming the ground didn&rsquo;t have a job anymore. But what</p>
<p>happened is new jobs emerged in making tractors and servicing those tractors in, you know, gas</p>
<p>pipelines to get gas to the tractors, all these economies emerged as a result of that economic,</p>
<p>technical innovation. So I think as we see AI and other innovations hit the market, you know, new</p>
<p>economies and new industries, hopefully, really blossom. And and we can benefit from that economic</p>
<p>growth and also lower costs for people on purchasing goods and services. We&rsquo;ve identified</p>
<p>four things when Reagan came in, wasn&rsquo;t wasn&rsquo;t the highest tax rate like like 70%. Yes, yeah,</p>
<p>that was the top marginal tax rate was 70%. And 70% is not unheard of, it will happen again in</p>
<p>this year in the US. Well, and but Reagan unleashed an economic boom by flattening the tax structure</p>
<p>because marginal tax rates created disincentive for people to work and produce more. And so there</p>
<p>is a big economic hit from this. Yeah. And remember what this 1970s were like, it was the malaise days</p>
<p>of Jimmy Carter, we had a horrible economy with high inflation, and everybody was paying high</p>
<p>tax rates, and the government wasn&rsquo;t making that much revenue, because there wasn&rsquo;t as much</p>
<p>economic activity going on. And during the 1980s, we had an economic boom, and the government</p>
<p>actually collected more revenue with lower tax rates, because so much economic progress was</p>
<p>unlocked. sex, we identified four things, just like we&rsquo;ve learned nothing, which one is the</p>
<p>most important here? Which ones are the most important? We talked about austerity, we talked</p>
<p>about increasing taxes, we talked about innovation and efficiency. And then we talked about immigration</p>
<p>recruiting more highly talented people, when you look at those four, do you have any to add to that</p>
<p>list to get out of this? And which ones do you think are the most important? And why when you</p>
<p>look at federal tax revenue, over a 50 year period, go look at the Fred charts, what you see</p>
<p>is that quite independent of the top marginal tax rate, the amount of federal receipts that the</p>
<p>government&rsquo;s able to collect is roughly around 19%, plus or minus 2%. And so you can only get</p>
<p>so much blood from a stone, you can try to raise the top marginal rates, but then rich people have</p>
<p>an incentive to basically find more tax protected strategies. So the history of this thing going</p>
<p>back 50 years is you can only extract so much from taxes. And what you&rsquo;re better off is a lower tax</p>
<p>rate that is broader based. And you go for economic growth that produces more activity. But look, if</p>
<p>you if you&rsquo;re spending too much, there&rsquo;s no way out of that. So austerity, critically important,</p>
<p>and entrepreneurial, I mean, when Bill Clinton left office, and I think Reagan through Clinton</p>
<p>was the biggest 25 year period of economic boom, we&rsquo;ve ever had federal spending, as a percentage</p>
<p>of GDP was 18 and a half percent. He got it down from like 22%. And he did it through economic</p>
<p>growth. And he bragged about it. Yep. So you know, look where you want to be is I think, federal</p>
<p>spending should be in the low 20s. I think you want tax revenue to be in the high teens 19%.</p>
<p>You can have a small deficit. Those are the conditions for economic growth.</p>
<p>Jamal, any thoughts here on our way out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take the complete opposite of all of this, which is the</p>
<p>anti chicken little version, which is I think not much at all changes. I think that jet debt to GDP</p>
<p>will continue to rise, not just for us, but for every other country in the world whose fate is</p>
<p>worse than the United States. And I think that on a relative basis, the United States will continue</p>
<p>to be exceptional. And that this will not really be an issue in our lifetimes. Okay. And I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying that&rsquo;s a good thing. And I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s a just thing. And I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I want to happen. But pragmatically, I think that that&rsquo;s what will happen. And I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that there is a magic number, where all of a sudden things start to break, where there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>magic number for jet debt to GDP, where all of a sudden everybody finds religion. Instead, I think</p>
<p>that it just creeps higher. And by the way, if you look at where debt to GDP was at the turn of</p>
<p>the 19th century, and then what happened through the World War Two, what we&rsquo;ve really done is,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve retraced a lot as well. So there have been moments where we&rsquo;ve been out over our</p>
<p>ski tips a lot. And so I think it&rsquo;s just important to keep in mind that sometimes what works just</p>
<p>continues to work. And I keep asking myself the relative question, which is what country,</p>
<p>what economy, what group of human capital is better positioned in the United States. And</p>
<p>despite all of the things that are screwed up with this country, it&rsquo;s hard to find a better</p>
<p>example. So yeah, unless you happen to have the lucky mineral or oil club, like Norway or Saudi</p>
<p>Arabia, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re going to be hard pressed to find a better place to plant your money. And I</p>
<p>think entrepreneurship and immigration are the two most important things we can do, as well as</p>
<p>austerity. And I think Joe Manchin is like, or these moderate candidates in the middle who might</p>
<p>actually be able to talk about cutting. But by the way, you said something, you said something</p>
<p>really interesting, which is if you look at Norway, Saudi, Abu Dhabi, what are those countries</p>
<p>effectively becoming by monetizing the oil, they invest in all of the economies that are working</p>
<p>perfect segue. Thank you. It&rsquo;s not as if the Saudis and Abu Dhabi and the Norwegians aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trying to invest in America. They&rsquo;re trying to put as much money to work as possible. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just trying to pace it out so that they have time diversity and asset diversity. So to your point,</p>
<p>Jason, it&rsquo;s so this is a it&rsquo;s sort of a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy. I think that</p>
<p>what has worked continues to work. And then the burden for disruption gets higher and higher.</p>
<p>Yeah, that changes. There&rsquo;s two things that work in the world, having those natural resources,</p>
<p>or having entrepreneurship. Let&rsquo;s make a segue here.</p>
<p>This is the final point on that. Oh, God, we&rsquo;ve been final point for 20 minutes here. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Quick final point. This is an important discussion, I think,</p>
<p>okay. So Adam, Adam Smith once said that there&rsquo;s a great deal of ruin in a nation, meaning</p>
<p>it takes a lot of political bungling to screw up something as big as a nation, especially a nation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the number one superpower in the world that has the world&rsquo;s reserve currency.</p>
<p>So we are, in some ways, a beneficiary and coasting on hundreds of years of excellence</p>
<p>of economic performance and great political leadership in this country. And the question</p>
<p>to ask is not whether we can still post on that, but whether the political leadership we have today</p>
<p>is living up to the standard we had in the past. And I think it&rsquo;s clearly not. And the only question</p>
<p>is when it breaks. And it&rsquo;s hard to predict exactly when it&rsquo;s going to break. But what I</p>
<p>do believe is that if we keep going the way we&rsquo;re going, it will have to stop.</p>
<p>Well said. We&rsquo;re definitely bending it right now. And when you bend it, sometimes it breaks.</p>
<p>Right. And by the way, the reason why we are going to pursue AI at breakneck speed,</p>
<p>even though it may lead to some sort of weird dystopian future,</p>
<p>is because we need that productivity boost. We have no choice now because we are so</p>
<p>tired of debt.</p>
<p>And frankly, better us than the next guy.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And better us than the next guy.</p>
<p>Whoever gets there first wins.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>Another perfect set of ways.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>Two major stories this week that we need to discuss. The first is Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s public</p>
<p>investment VC arm took a very interesting PR step of listing their funds that they have backed. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a significant list. Everybody from Andreessen Horowitz to KOTU, not surprising there. And Mark</p>
<p>Andreessen and Ben Horowitz and Adam Newman had a major keynote at a Saudi startup conference. I</p>
<p>was actually asked to keynote the next one in Riyadh, which I&rsquo;m debating doing. And then,</p>
<p>in sync with that happening, at the same time, there&rsquo;s been a debate of should LPs in America</p>
<p>be backing firms like Sequoia China, Matrix China, et cetera, because those firms are now backing</p>
<p>open AI competitors. And if we believe AI is the big race here, should we, as a country,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not allowed to back military stuff, obviously, in these countries. But how do we,</p>
<p>on this global chessboard, decide should we be taking money from Saudi? Should we be investing</p>
<p>money in AI startups in China? So I think Chamath, you&rsquo;ve got a big perspective here.</p>
<p>Globally. Let&rsquo;s start with you. Two separate issues. Any surprises here by Saudi, the kingdom</p>
<p>actually releasing the list of who they&rsquo;re backing? And why would they do that at this point in time?</p>
<p>And then us investing in China, because we are at a moment here, a crossroads, I think,</p>
<p>of should we be engaging or not engaging and building bridges with China and Saudi?</p>
<p>You know, for obvious reasons,</p>
<p>look, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, all of the UAE, these are countries that are really important</p>
<p>on the world stage, and increasingly so because they manage peace and prosperity regionally now,</p>
<p>right, they have huge balance sheets that can accelerate all kinds of projects all around the</p>
<p>world. And so they have to be taken seriously. And so this is a very smart marketing move</p>
<p>by the PIF, which is to essentially say, look, we are an established blue chip LP</p>
<p>of the blue chip organizations that you&rsquo;re used to hearing about and celebrating.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s very smart of them. Because what it does is it reinforces the feedback loop</p>
<p>that other great firms should be going to them to raise capital when it comes time for them to</p>
<p>raise their n plus first fund. And so I suspect, especially now, it makes even more sense because</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;ve heard, Friedberg mentioned it a couple of episodes ago, the United States</p>
<p>limited partner market is essentially closed for business, they have huge misallocation problems,</p>
<p>the endowments are sort of closed, the universities are closed, a lot of the family offices</p>
<p>are licking their wounds. And so this is a perfect time for folks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE to</p>
<p>basically put the foot on the gas and basically tell everybody, hey, we are open for business.</p>
<p>So I think that that makes a lot of sense. And I think that it&rsquo;ll be successful. It&rsquo;ll work,</p>
<p>especially in a moment now where US dollar flows from US dollar limited partners are</p>
<p>very difficult and harder to come by.</p>
<p>Well, and we&rsquo;re also selling billions of dollars in weapons to the kingdom.</p>
<p>And we are a major part of their valuable, their valuable security partner of the United States,</p>
<p>their valuable economic partner in the United States, it&rsquo;s no different than doing business</p>
<p>with any other country. I think it&rsquo;s smart by the PIF. On the other thing, though,</p>
<p>with US firms investing in Chinese AI, it should not be allowed. And I do think that</p>
<p>the folks that are responsible for CFIUS need to get a handle on this.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of deals where I have had to jump through a bunch of CFIUS hoops,</p>
<p>where explain CFIUS, please. So basically, CFIUS is the committee on foreign investment in the</p>
<p>United States. Now, what that means is, if folks want to invest in certain things that are on a</p>
<p>list of things, and I&rsquo;ll tell you the things that I&rsquo;ve been involved with that that came under</p>
<p>CFIUS, rocketry, and certain chip technologies are so advanced that the United States has very</p>
<p>specific rules that limit the ability for foreign actors to invest in those businesses.</p>
<p>And in those situations where a few folks invested beside me in some of these companies,</p>
<p>we had to go through a process to get CFIUS approval before that investment was allowed.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about that is that&rsquo;s about money coming in.</p>
<p>But I do think that the reverse now becomes important, because if US dollars are going</p>
<p>to go and see these extremely complicated advanced technologies abroad,</p>
<p>especially into the hands of countries that are frenemies at best of the United States,</p>
<p>I think we have a responsibility to have a point of view on that. And so I think Keith</p>
<p>Raboi was the one that was very definitive and said this should not be allowed. I do think it</p>
<p>is so early, Jason, we talked about this, we&rsquo;re on this curve of fuck around and find out which</p>
<p>means there will be some crazy examples of stuff that are very uncomfortable. Yep. I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>we want us fingerprints on this stuff being perfected outside of us borders.</p>
<p>sacks when we look at the history of engagement with China, maybe we can take a multi decade</p>
<p>globalization perspective here. When you look back on it, the engagement with China created</p>
<p>so much prosperity, so much intertwined dependency, iPhones being the best example,</p>
<p>possibly, we&rsquo;re selling them in China, we&rsquo;re making them in China. China loses Apple as a</p>
<p>customer that would be absolutely devastating for them. And it would obviously be devastating</p>
<p>for Apple as well. So when we look back on that, as a general rubric here, do you think</p>
<p>we enabled a competitor? Or we avoided future conflict because of the interdependency? And</p>
<p>where do you sit in terms of thinking about engagement, versus maybe isolation or something</p>
<p>in between those two frenemies, best of frenemies, etc. The policy of constructive engagement,</p>
<p>as it was called 20 something years ago, the the idea behind it was that if we engage with</p>
<p>China economically and help make them rich, then that they would become more like us,</p>
<p>they would somehow turn into a democracy, and they would have tremendous gratitude towards us.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d become friends. It&rsquo;s not the way it worked out. There were people who warned that</p>
<p>this was a foolish approach. So most notably, the realist scholar john Mearsheimer at the</p>
<p>University of Chicago warned back in 2002, that that was not the way this was going to play out.</p>
<p>If we made China rich, they would seek to convert that wealth into political power.</p>
<p>And then they would act the way that all other great powers have behaved throughout human history,</p>
<p>which is they want to dominate their region, and they would seek to push the United States out of</p>
<p>Asia. And the future that he predicted 20 years ago is the future that&rsquo;s come true. And I think</p>
<p>the you know, all the constructive engagers, I think, has some egg on their face. Now,</p>
<p>I understand where they&rsquo;re coming from. This is a fundamental difference between whether you see the</p>
<p>world in economic terms, which is about creating positive some games, basically trade, or whether</p>
<p>you see the world fundamentally in geopolitical terms, which is about the balance of power,</p>
<p>which is more of a zero sum game. And I think that both views, they&rsquo;re both extremely important,</p>
<p>we want to engage in positive some relationships that generate more trade and more wealth for the</p>
<p>United States. At the same time, we have to be aware and concerned about the balance of power,</p>
<p>we do not want a number two country in the world who can rival the United States,</p>
<p>in terms of power, who basically could win a security competition with us. And we certainly</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want a country in the world to be more powerful than us. So I think this is sort of</p>
<p>the yin and the yang is geopolitics versus economics. And I think what&rsquo;s happened with</p>
<p>China over the last several years is it&rsquo;s flipped, I think we used to see the relationship primarily</p>
<p>in positive some economic terms, and now we see it in geopolitical terms. And I think there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of firms now in the United States who haven&rsquo;t embraced this new reality. And to go back to your</p>
<p>question about, you know, when should a venture capital firm take money from a foreign country</p>
<p>when it should, and I think there&rsquo;s a very simple rule for this, which is, if the country is a US</p>
<p>ally, I think it&rsquo;s fair game because the US has said this is a partner of ours. So why can&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>do business with them? But if the United States government has said this is an adversary, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting yourself in a really difficult, precarious spot by doing business with them, because then you</p>
<p>have to explain yourself to the US government. Yeah, this is the very simple rule we would use</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t we would never consider taking money from Russia or China, any country that the US</p>
<p>government says is an adversary of ours. But if the US government says this is a partner and an</p>
<p>ally, then I think you could consider it. Do you think there&rsquo;s a way sacks to salvage the</p>
<p>relationship with China and make it productive? Or do you think it&rsquo;s a far gone conclusion at</p>
<p>this point, because one might argue, and I&rsquo;ve heard people argue this, maybe China would have</p>
<p>invaded Taiwan already if it wasn&rsquo;t for the interdependency. So I know we&rsquo;re dealing with,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of we&rsquo;re doing a lot of predictions here. But do you think it can be salvaged? And do</p>
<p>you think it would have been a worse relationship if we hadn&rsquo;t had this interdependency that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>built up? I&rsquo;m not quite sure that the economic interdependence theory, preventing war has been</p>
<p>definitively proven. If you go back to World War One, for example, it was the case that</p>
<p>Britain and Germany actually were each other&rsquo;s number one trading partners, and they still got</p>
<p>in World War One, for reasons that in hindsight seem really silly. So I&rsquo;m not sure that economic</p>
<p>interdependence can prevent, it certainly doesn&rsquo;t prevent security competitions from arising. And</p>
<p>therefore, I don&rsquo;t think it can necessarily prevent a war. Although, you know, having business ties</p>
<p>can lead to positive interactions. So I&rsquo;m just saying the jury&rsquo;s still out on that. But I think</p>
<p>that, like I said, I think once you&rsquo;re in a security competition, the way that we are with</p>
<p>China, I think geopolitics rather than economics is in the driver&rsquo;s seat. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>Super easy, Friberg, intellectually way, I think, to process this, you would never invest in a</p>
<p>North Korean AI company, a Russian AI company, or an Iranian AI company. How do you think about</p>
<p>China, and then just generally this topic of when to engage, when venture capitalists, when</p>
<p>startups, you know, and trade partners should engage with various countries? How do you think</p>
<p>about it, Friberg?</p>
<p>In what role as an investor?</p>
<p>Well, we could we could take multiple roles here. Founder, investor would be the top two for this</p>
<p>program, I think. Or taking money from any of those three possibilities.</p>
<p>Very few portfolio companies that don&rsquo;t benefit some way from the trade relationship with China.</p>
<p>So, you know, to Sax&rsquo;s point, I&rsquo;m not sure you can really say China is a true and complete</p>
<p>adversary in the sense that we&rsquo;re on opposite sides. There&rsquo;s obviously deep interdependencies.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s hard to kind of say, I draw the line at this kind of technology investing there,</p>
<p>but I benefit from their technology investing that&rsquo;s going on there in other ways with some</p>
<p>of my other businesses. Right? I think that that&rsquo;s really where you kind of run into a</p>
<p>bit of a conundrum that we do have a deep interdependency.</p>
<p>So, you know, like with respect to like investing in China, I don&rsquo;t know, I think the investing in</p>
<p>China thing, it&rsquo;s pretty difficult, given that there is a single power that gets to decide what</p>
<p>does or doesn&rsquo;t happen. I mean, look at what happened with Alibaba. A lot of shareholders got</p>
<p>pretty wiped out there. These governments where you have like, the potential of getting completely</p>
<p>wiped out by government action is a pretty scary place to invest in general. I&rsquo;d be more oriented</p>
<p>as an investor around those concerns than I am about, you know, it&rsquo;s really hard to do the</p>
<p>calculus on, am I helping or hurting America versus China? You know, you could argue 100</p>
<p>ways, each of those sides. What do you think of sexes framework? If we&rsquo;re partners? You know,</p>
<p>fair game, if not partners, not a good idea to put your neck out. But we&rsquo;re sorry, are you asking?</p>
<p>Are you saying like, we&rsquo;re not partners with China? Well, it seems like the US government has</p>
<p>said we&rsquo;re adversaries now, and that we&rsquo;re in a in a pretty dogged competition. Well,</p>
<p>Jake, I&rsquo;ll just be specific. I&rsquo;m talking about a situation in which you&rsquo;re taking money from them.</p>
<p>Yes, in a situation where you&rsquo;re taking money.</p>
<p>I do think that selling them products that are, you know, not like super strategic,</p>
<p>like I think selling them our most advanced chips is dangerous. But, you know, look,</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re selling them products that help restore the trade deficit and correct that.</p>
<p>Movies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with</p>
<p>selling movies or cars or something like that to China. The question is, though,</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re a venture capital firm, do you take their money? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>specifically talking about. And I think whether you&rsquo;re allowed to or not, we don&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t have to think about what complications that could cause down the road.</p>
<p>Also getting your money out of China, also a difficult task, it seems these days.</p>
<p>Cash app creator Bob Lee, aka Crazy Bob on Twitter, that was his Twitter handle was</p>
<p>stabbed to death tragically in San Francisco earlier this week. He was squares for CTM.</p>
<p>He worked at Google on Android. He was the chief product officer at mobile coin.</p>
<p>Also an angel investor in a ton of companies, figma space x clubhouse.</p>
<p>Well known in the industry. Officers responded at about 235am to a report of a stabbing</p>
<p>on the 300 block of Main Street, and arrived to find Lee who had been taken to hospital</p>
<p>and succumbed to his injuries there. No arrests has been made. A lot of San Francisco</p>
<p>politicians are sending their thoughts and prayers. But obviously, San Francisco is still</p>
<p>very dangerous place, it seems. Any thoughts on this and how it might act as some sort of</p>
<p>crossroads or not? And thoughts and prayers, obviously, to his family.</p>
<p>I think this</p>
<p>was a pretty tragic event. There&rsquo;s a lot of people who I knew that were pretty close with him. I got</p>
<p>several messages on his passing. He was I didn&rsquo;t know him. Personally, I think we met maybe once</p>
<p>or twice. He worked on Android at Google, and obviously had a key role at square in the early</p>
<p>days and was a pretty impactful and important person. But also supposedly, I didn&rsquo;t know him</p>
<p>very well again. But everyone says just such an incredibly kind and generous person. So</p>
<p>tragic loss. I used to live two blocks from where the event happened. I&rsquo;ll zoom out.</p>
<p>Is it a bad place in Soma at Rincon Center? Right by the big condo towers there. And that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>where the Salesforce offices used to be. And, you know, block from the waterfront.</p>
<p>Is a part of all that drug craziness? No, it&rsquo;s not in the heart of the camping district. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a nice area and Soma quiet area, right? So at night, there&rsquo;s no one there. I went to San Francisco</p>
<p>a few weeks ago, I told you guys, I pulled up to a restaurant on the Embarcadero. And I joked with</p>
<p>my buddy in the car. I&rsquo;m like, Oh, my car is going to get broken into while we&rsquo;re at dinner,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m parking on the street. We went to dinner 90 minutes later came out. Of course,</p>
<p>my car had been broken into the trunk had been popped up. And it&rsquo;s just like, this is the fancy</p>
<p>area of Soma, Chamath. Very fancy area of Soma. Look, here&rsquo;s the thing. If you park at a parking</p>
<p>meter in San Francisco for eight minutes too long, you get a 60 to $100 parking ticket. And San</p>
<p>Francisco has become an upside down town. What I mean by that is I think that like so much of</p>
<p>the response that we&rsquo;ve had in the last couple of years to power dynamics and concerns about the</p>
<p>powerful having too much influence over those who are less powerful, who have less influence and who</p>
<p>suffer as a result of their demeaned influence. The response has been to turn things upside down,</p>
<p>which is to give those who are lacking in the power structure everything and to try and take</p>
<p>everything away from those who are at the top of the power structure. So if you want to deal drugs</p>
<p>in the open air, if you want to walk into Walgreens and steal 1000s of dollars of goods</p>
<p>and walk out, nothing will happen to you. Because you were embedded with this powerless kind of</p>
<p>position in life. But if you have a car and you park at a parking meter, and you say at the parking</p>
<p>meter for more than 10 minutes, you get a ticket. And the consequences of responding to power</p>
<p>dynamics by flipping the power structure upside down is obviously can be more negative as we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of experiencing, I think, acutely in San Francisco, but also around the nation.</p>
<p>And by the way, I think that this applies in a lot of other ways in terms of how we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>college admissions, in terms of how we&rsquo;re selecting people for jobs, in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>recent applications for pilots for doctors, where the assessment is less about did the person who</p>
<p>was disadvantaged at the beginning of their life or career or trajectory, or educational path,</p>
<p>be given greater opportunity, and greater resources to catch up and to get there? Or did</p>
<p>we just flip the power dynamic upside down and just give them the endpoint. And as a result,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a massive kind of detriment that I think can arise. And it&rsquo;s not necessarily always the</p>
<p>case that it will arise, it is not necessarily the case that selecting someone based on some</p>
<p>demographic profiling to be an airline pilot necessarily means that that airline is more</p>
<p>likely to have airplane crashes. But in certain cases, when you don&rsquo;t prosecute certain crimes,</p>
<p>like robberies, or people walking into stores, or breaking windows or dealing drugs in the middle of</p>
<p>the street or camping on the street, and you fast forward a couple of years, that power dynamic,</p>
<p>the flip of that power dynamic causes the whole town to go upside down. And everyone who&rsquo;s sitting</p>
<p>on the bottom ends up becoming a victim themselves. And I think we&rsquo;re starting to see inklings of this</p>
<p>in San Francisco, we certainly have for years, Sachs has ranted on about this with respect to</p>
<p>some of the non prosecution that&rsquo;s happened historically. And I totally agree with him</p>
<p>on those points. And I think that it&rsquo;s come to a breaking point in San Francisco, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really a beacon for what else is going on. And you know, some people call it wokeism. I think maybe</p>
<p>this notion of wokeism is one small element or segment of the broader issue with how we are</p>
<p>tackling with and dealing with embedded power structure issues in this world today. And the</p>
<p>flipping of those power structures upside down doesn&rsquo;t necessarily yield the outcome we all want.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re starting to see reasons why.</p>
<p>Sachs, any thoughts here?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my rant.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t disagree with you.</p>
<p>Yeah. So similar to Freeberg, I didn&rsquo;t know Bob Lee, but I know many people who knew him,</p>
<p>and I was getting texts. And obviously, we feel really bad for him, his whole family, his kids,</p>
<p>his father, his co workers, friends. We don&rsquo;t know exactly what happened yet. But I think</p>
<p>we suspect, and I would bet dollars to dimes that the story is very similar to a case we had in LA</p>
<p>recently, the Brianna Kupfer case, where a young woman was basically stabbed for no reason by a</p>
<p>psychotic homeless person who had been through the revolving door of the jail and criminal justice</p>
<p>system, who could have been locked up, who was arrested multiple times, but was not kept locked</p>
<p>up because of this push for decarceration. And you can argue that maybe it&rsquo;d be better for that</p>
<p>person to be in mandatory treatment, or even maybe a mental asylum. But this idea of just</p>
<p>releasing these people onto the street, I just think is an outrageous abdication of responsibility</p>
<p>by our elected officials who run the criminal justice system, who pass our laws. And the thing</p>
<p>I just wish is that I could lock for 24 hours, the people like our supervisors, or our governor,</p>
<p>or the people who basically make these laws, or the people who are pushing for decarceration of</p>
<p>these violent offenders by these nonprofits, I wish I could lock them up in a room for 24 hours</p>
<p>with the people that they think are safe to release on our streets. Let&rsquo;s see if they really</p>
<p>would take that test. Because it seems to me that these elected leaders and these nonprofits</p>
<p>who are pushing for these outcomes, they are setting loose on us a predatory criminal or</p>
<p>psychotic element that jeopardizes our safety and makes these cities unlivable. And we should not</p>
<p>tolerate that. And quite frankly, the responsibility goes beyond those elected leaders. It goes to all</p>
<p>the voters as well, because we keep putting up with this. And where was our governor when this</p>
<p>happened? He was in Florida doing some singalong at some high school where he was trolling</p>
<p>Ron DeSantis because DeSantis has taken on DEI at that school. So that&rsquo;s where Newsom was. And he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extremely popular in California. Fighting culture wars instead of saving people. Fighting culture</p>
<p>wars in a distant state. Instead of basically fixing the criminal justice system in California,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even worse than that because he&rsquo;s actually shut down two prisons and released lots of people.</p>
<p>So where is the push for criminal justice reform in California and protecting the citizenry? And</p>
<p>until the voters in San Francisco and California start demanding this, there&rsquo;s never going to be</p>
<p>a change. So start listening to Gary Tan. Just vote for whoever the f*** Gary Tan tells you to</p>
<p>vote for, okay? I can&rsquo;t disagree. And the supervisors seem to control a lot of this.</p>
<p>And Chamath shared just this week, Mayor Francis Suarez is talking about on his Twitter,</p>
<p>the reduction in homicide shootings. And they have literally counted the,</p>
<p>if you want to say, drug addicted, mentally ill, homeless, there&rsquo;s obviously three or four</p>
<p>different things going on here when you look at the population that&rsquo;s living on the street.</p>
<p>Some number of them down on their luck, some number mentally ill, some number addicted to</p>
<p>drugs, and some number a combination of those things. He seems to be getting it done in Miami.</p>
<p>And, you know, other states seem to and other cities seem to have gotten this under control.</p>
<p>Is there any hope for San Francisco Chamath? Or is this just going to take five or 10 years to</p>
<p>bottom out? I mean, it takes regime change. I think New York had a long period of lawlessness,</p>
<p>where people were afraid to walk down the streets, it took a handful of mayors to draw a hard line</p>
<p>in the sand, to increase policing, sometimes to introduce some pretty controversial concepts at</p>
<p>the time, or at the time that were supported, which now seem controversial. You&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about stop asking for us, I think it was called the broken windows theory of policing. Yep, take</p>
<p>care of the lyrics, take care of the little things so that the little things don&rsquo;t compound into the</p>
<p>big things. But whatever you believe needs to get done. I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear that what is being</p>
<p>done isn&rsquo;t working. And so the real question is, can people see through the naked partisanship</p>
<p>to agree that this is not working? And sadly, what I would tell you guys is that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re there yet. And the reason is because America is the most divided it&rsquo;s ever been,</p>
<p>especially on issues of race and social justice and social norms. And I think that crime has</p>
<p>gotten caught and painted with that brush, which means that the idea of very aggressive policing</p>
<p>and safety are now viewed as opposite and antithetical to social justice.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how that happened. But the result of it is this, which is these folks</p>
<p>will never agree that this is not working. And you&rsquo;ll have to go through recall election after</p>
<p>recall election. And even then, it&rsquo;s not going to be enough, because the smart politicians will say</p>
<p>what they want, in terms of like, safety matters. But then a lot of voters will vote the opposite.</p>
<p>The example in Chicago that David brought up earlier is really interesting, because it was</p>
<p>essentially a social justice candidate versus a law and order candidate through their democratic</p>
<p>ranks. And the social justice candidate one, the progressive candidate one and the person</p>
<p>that wanted to tax businesses and individuals one, and the person that wanted to sort of focus</p>
<p>on law and order lost. So what does that say? It says that we are still in a moment where we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree on what is important. Yeah, that&rsquo;s really scary. And so I think you kind of have to</p>
<p>unfortunately vote with your feet if you are lucky enough to do so. And that&rsquo;s the key. Yeah.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s left over, or a lot of people who are not in a position to just up and leave.</p>
<p>And then they are unfortunately left behind.</p>
<p>Tragic situation all around. And I will never host a conference or any event in San Francisco until</p>
<p>this is solved. Because when people ask us to do events, I&rsquo;m like, people don&rsquo;t want to come to San</p>
<p>Francisco, they&rsquo;re afraid. So I do my events in Napa, or in San Mateo,</p>
<p>not not started a bilingual school, Italian English that is on the IB system,</p>
<p>international baccalaureate system. And it&rsquo;s a sister school to a school in the city,</p>
<p>we had a fundraiser, which was literally right downtown in that encampment area.</p>
<p>And when I pulled up, I was like, is this for real? It&rsquo;s an open air drug market, where folks</p>
<p>are doing drugs, selling drugs right in front of you. They&rsquo;re passed out completely incapacitated,</p>
<p>about a third of the guys are wearing balaclavas. So you can identify them, you have no idea what</p>
<p>they look like. I grew up in Brooklyn in the 70s and 80s, when it was legit, dangerous. And</p>
<p>when I walk in San Francisco, it feels much more dangerous.</p>
<p>Then the that crazy era, it feels random, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s organized crime,</p>
<p>gang crime, like I grew up in a pretty crappy neighborhood. And you knew who the gangs were,</p>
<p>you knew who the tough guys were, you knew how to avoid trouble, it didn&rsquo;t come in randomly,</p>
<p>come and stab you to death. Right? And so yeah, Jason, you become street smart growing up in a</p>
<p>culture like that, because you know how to avoid it. You know how to be alert. This doesn&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>like that. This is just like a bad roll of the dice. And you could get stabbed to death just</p>
<p>walking down the street that does not. Where Where are the politicians to stop this?</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t care. There&rsquo;s the level of corruption in San Francisco is unbelievable.</p>
<p>The incompetence amongst those supervisors, the mayor, the DAs, everybody, it&rsquo;s just incompetence.</p>
<p>And nobody has the chutzpah or the wherewithal to say enough. And I think the other group to blame</p>
<p>are all the rich people and powerful people who just haven&rsquo;t been active in politics. And I know</p>
<p>some of us have in different ways, but I think it&rsquo;s going to take a coordinated effort by people</p>
<p>who really care to vote out all these supervisors and bring in. It&rsquo;s got to be regime change. And I</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s the wherewithal to do because every time as a person who has some means</p>
<p>or is successful in some way that you stick your neck out there like you have done sacks,</p>
<p>the the attacks that you will get from this insane, left. I don&rsquo;t want to even use the word</p>
<p>woke. I think it&rsquo;s a different derangement. I think it&rsquo;s actual corruption where they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>so much money off of this homeless industrial complex. They&rsquo;re getting paid so much money that</p>
<p>the grift is so deep that they are going to fight for this. And it&rsquo;s going to take some really</p>
<p>courageous people like Gary Tan and maybe David Sacks and other folks to back a slate of people</p>
<p>to change this. And we need people to run for government who are brave and who want to put</p>
<p>their neck out there and say, enough is enough. We&rsquo;re going to police the city. I just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s going to happen. All right, listen. Yeah, I mean, the issue is that it takes more than one</p>
<p>election. So listen, I think we made a positive change by removing Chesa Boudin. I think Brooke</p>
<p>Jenkins has the right attitude. She cares about victims. I think she wants to prosecute. The issue</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;ve got a police department that&rsquo;s 50% of the number of officers that they want because</p>
<p>they flirted with this whole defund the police movement. You&rsquo;ve got the Board of Supervisors and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got an oversight board on the police that basically make their jobs harder. And it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>one election because even the mayor doesn&rsquo;t control it because the Board of Supervisors really</p>
<p>has all the power in San Francisco. So they take a job that really should be one or two people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jobs, like the DA, like the mayor, and they break it up into this like Board of Supervisors where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve now got to be familiar with a dozen different races in order to effectuate a change.</p>
<p>Well, the machine knows how to do that, but the average citizen doesn&rsquo;t. So they make it really</p>
<p>hard to effectuate change. But there are groups that are springing up in San Francisco like Grow</p>
<p>SF and people like Gary who are on top of it. And that&rsquo;s why just follow them and vote for their</p>
<p>recommendations because they&rsquo;re actually tracking how to make a difference. All right. I think on</p>
<p>that, we will wrap for the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya, the Rain Man David Sachs, and the</p>
<p>sultan of science, David Friedberg. I am the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator. We&rsquo;ll see you at the</p>
<p>All In Summit 2023 in September. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
