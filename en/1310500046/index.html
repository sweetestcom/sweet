    <p>The following is a conversation with Gary Kasparov.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s considered by many to be the greatest chess player</p>
<p>of all time.</p>
<p>From 1986 until his retirement in 2005,</p>
<p>he dominated the chess world,</p>
<p>ranking world number one for most of those 19 years.</p>
<p>While he has many historical matches</p>
<p>against human chess players,</p>
<p>in the long arc of history he may be remembered</p>
<p>for his match against the machine, IBM&rsquo;s Deep Blue.</p>
<p>His initial victories and eventual loss to Deep Blue</p>
<p>captivated the imagination of the world,</p>
<p>of what role artificial intelligence systems may play</p>
<p>in our civilization&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>That excitement inspired an entire generation</p>
<p>of AI researchers, including myself,</p>
<p>to get into the field.</p>
<p>Gary is also a pro democracy political thinker and leader,</p>
<p>a fearless human rights activist,</p>
<p>and author of several books,</p>
<p>including How Life Imitates Chess,</p>
<p>which is a book on strategy and decision making,</p>
<p>Winter is Coming,</p>
<p>which is a book articulating his opposition</p>
<p>to the Putin regime,</p>
<p>and Deep Thinking,</p>
<p>which is a book on the role</p>
<p>of both artificial intelligence and human intelligence</p>
<p>in defining our future.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Gary Kasparov.</p>
<p>As perhaps the greatest chess player of all time,</p>
<p>when you look introspectively at your psychology</p>
<p>throughout your career,</p>
<p>what was the bigger motivator,</p>
<p>the love of winning or the hatred of losing?</p>
<p>Tough question.</p>
<p>Have to confess I never heard it before,</p>
<p>which is again, congratulations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite an accomplishment.</p>
<p>Losing was always painful.</p>
<p>For me, it was almost like a physical pain</p>
<p>because I knew that if I lost the game,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just because I made a mistake.</p>
<p>So I always believed that the result of the game</p>
<p>had to be decided by the quality of my play.</p>
<p>Okay, you may say it sounds arrogant,</p>
<p>but it helped me to move forward</p>
<p>because I always knew that there was room for improvement.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p>
<p>Was there the fear of the mistake?</p>
<p>Actually, fear of mistake guarantees mistakes.</p>
<p>And the difference between top players at the very top</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s the ability to make a decision</p>
<p>without predictable consequences.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just intuitively.</p>
<p>I can go this way or that way.</p>
<p>And there are always hesitations.</p>
<p>People are like, you are just at the crossroad.</p>
<p>You can go right, you can go left, you can go straight.</p>
<p>You can turn and go back.</p>
<p>And the consequences are just very uncertain.</p>
<p>Yes, you have certain ideas what happens on the right</p>
<p>or on the left or on just if you go straight,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not enough to make well calculated choice.</p>
<p>And when you play chess at the very top,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about your inner strength.</p>
<p>So I can make this decision.</p>
<p>I will stand firm and I&rsquo;m not going to waste my time</p>
<p>because I have full confidence that I will go through.</p>
<p>Going back to your original question is,</p>
<p>I would say neither.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s love for winning, hate for losing.</p>
<p>There were important elements, psychological elements,</p>
<p>but the key element, I would say the driving force</p>
<p>was always my passion for making a difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I can move forward and I can always,</p>
<p>I can always enjoy not just playing,</p>
<p>but creating something new.</p>
<p>Creating something new.</p>
<p>How do you think about that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just finding new ideas in the openings,</p>
<p>some original plan in the middle game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, that helped me to make the transition</p>
<p>from the game of chess where I was on the very top</p>
<p>to another life where I knew I would not be number one.</p>
<p>I would not be necessarily on the top,</p>
<p>but I could still be very active and productive</p>
<p>by my ability to make a difference,</p>
<p>by influencing people, say joining the democratic movement</p>
<p>in Russia or talking to people</p>
<p>about human machine relations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things where I knew my influence</p>
<p>may not be as decisive as in chess,</p>
<p>but still strong enough to help people</p>
<p>to make their choices.</p>
<p>So you can still create something new</p>
<p>that makes a difference in the world outside of chess.</p>
<p>But wait, you&rsquo;ve kind of painted a beautiful picture</p>
<p>of your motivations in chess to create something new,</p>
<p>to look for those moments of some brilliant new ideas.</p>
<p>But were you haunted by something?</p>
<p>See, you make it seem like to be at the level you&rsquo;re at,</p>
<p>you can get away without having demons,</p>
<p>without having fears,</p>
<p>without being driven by some of the darker forces.</p>
<p>I mean, you sound almost religious.</p>
<p>The darker forces, spiritual demons.</p>
<p>I mean, do you have a call for a priest?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m dressing as.</p>
<p>Now, just let&rsquo;s go back to these crucial chess moments</p>
<p>where I had to make big decisions.</p>
<p>As I said, it was all about my belief from very early days</p>
<p>that I can make all the difference by playing well</p>
<p>or by making mistakes.</p>
<p>So yes, I always had an opponent</p>
<p>across the chess board, opposite me.</p>
<p>But no matter how strong the opponent was,</p>
<p>whether it just was ordinary player</p>
<p>or another world champion like Anatoly Karpov,</p>
<p>having all respect for my opponent,</p>
<p>I still believe that it&rsquo;s up to me to make the difference.</p>
<p>And I knew I was not invincible.</p>
<p>I made mistakes.</p>
<p>I made some blunders.</p>
<p>And with age, I made more blunders.</p>
<p>So I knew it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s very much for me</p>
<p>to be decisive factor in the game.</p>
<p>I mean, even now, look, I just,</p>
<p>my latest chess experience was horrible.</p>
<p>I mean, I played Caruana, Fabi Caruana,</p>
<p>this number two, number two,</p>
<p>number three player in the world these days.</p>
<p>We played this 960 with the Fischer,</p>
<p>so called Fischer random chess, reshuffling pieces.</p>
<p>Yeah, I lost very badly, but it&rsquo;s because I made mistakes.</p>
<p>I mean, I had so many winning positions.</p>
<p>I mean, 15 years ago, I would have crushed him.</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s, you know, while I lost,</p>
<p>I was not so much upset.</p>
<p>I mean, I know, as I said in the interview,</p>
<p>I can fight any opponent, but not my biological clock.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fighting time is always a losing proposition.</p>
<p>But even today at age 56, you know,</p>
<p>I knew that, you know, I could play great game.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t finish it because I didn&rsquo;t have enough energy</p>
<p>or just, you know,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have the same level of concentration.</p>
<p>But, you know, in number of games</p>
<p>where I completely outplayed one of the top players</p>
<p>in the world, I mean, gave me a certain amount of pleasure.</p>
<p>That is, even today, I haven&rsquo;t lost my touch.</p>
<p>Not the same, you know.</p>
<p>Okay, the jaws are not as strong</p>
<p>and the teeth are not as sharp,</p>
<p>but I could get to him just, you know,</p>
<p>almost, you know, on the ropes.</p>
<p>Still got it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, my wife said it well.</p>
<p>I mean, she said, look, Gary,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somehow, it&rsquo;s not just fighting your biological clock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, maybe it&rsquo;s a signal</p>
<p>because, you know, the goddess of chess,</p>
<p>since you spoke great about demons.</p>
<p>The goddess of chess, Keisha,</p>
<p>maybe she didn&rsquo;t want you to win</p>
<p>because, you know, if you could beat</p>
<p>number two, number three player in the world,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the top players</p>
<p>who just recently played World Championship match.</p>
<p>If you could beat him,</p>
<p>that would be really bad for the game of chess.</p>
<p>But just, what people will say,</p>
<p>oh, look, the game of chess, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not making any progress.</p>
<p>The game is just, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally devalued because, look,</p>
<p>the guy coming out of retirement,</p>
<p>you know, just, you know, winning games,</p>
<p>maybe that was good for chess, not good for you.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, look, I&rsquo;ve been following your logic.</p>
<p>We should always look for, you know, demons,</p>
<p>you know, superior forces and other things</p>
<p>that could, you know, if not dominate our lives,</p>
<p>but somehow, you know, play a significant role</p>
<p>in the outcome.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the goddess of chess had to send a message.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So Gary, you should do something else.</p>
<p>Time.</p>
<p>Now for a question that you have heard before,</p>
<p>but give me a chance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve dominated the chess world for 20 years,</p>
<p>even still got it.</p>
<p>Is there a moment, you said,</p>
<p>you always look to create something new.</p>
<p>Is there games or moments</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re especially proud of</p>
<p>in terms of your brilliance of a new creative move?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about Mikhail Tal</p>
<p>as somebody who was aggressive and creative chess player</p>
<p>in your own game.</p>
<p>Look, you mentioned Mikhail Tal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very aggressive, very sharp player,</p>
<p>famous for his combinations and sacrifices,</p>
<p>even called magician from Riga,</p>
<p>so for his very unique style.</p>
<p>But any world champion, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, yeah, was a creator.</p>
<p>Some of them were so flamboyant and flash like Tal.</p>
<p>Some of them were no just, you know,</p>
<p>less discerned at the chess board like Tigran Petrosian,</p>
<p>but every world champion, every top player</p>
<p>brought something into the game of chess.</p>
<p>And each contribution was priceless</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just about sacrifices.</p>
<p>Of course, amateurs, they enjoy, you know,</p>
<p>the brilliant games where pieces being sacrificed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all just, you know, it&rsquo;s all piece of hanging.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all of a sudden, you know,</p>
<p>being material down, a rook down,</p>
<p>or just, you know, queen down.</p>
<p>The weaker side delivers the final blow</p>
<p>on just, you know, mating opponent&rsquo;s king.</p>
<p>But there are other kinds of beauty.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a slow positional maneuvering,</p>
<p>you know, looking for weaknesses</p>
<p>and just, and gradually, you know,</p>
<p>strangling your opponent</p>
<p>and eventually delivering sort of a positional masterpiece.</p>
<p>So I think I made more difference in the game of chess</p>
<p>than I could have imagined when I started playing.</p>
<p>And the reason I thought it was time for me to leave</p>
<p>was just, I mean, I knew that I was not,</p>
<p>I was not, no longer the position to</p>
<p>bring the same kind of contribution,</p>
<p>the same kind of new knowledge into the game.</p>
<p>So, and going back,</p>
<p>I could immediately look at my games</p>
<p>against Anatoly Karpov.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just I won the match in 1985</p>
<p>and became a world champion at age 22,</p>
<p>but there were at least two games in that match.</p>
<p>Of course, the last one, game 24,</p>
<p>that was decisive game of the match,</p>
<p>I won and became world champion.</p>
<p>But also the way I won, it was a very sharp game</p>
<p>and I found a unique maneuver that was absolutely new</p>
<p>and it became some sort of just a typical now,</p>
<p>though just when the move was made,</p>
<p>was made on the board and put on display,</p>
<p>a lot of people thought it was ugly.</p>
<p>And another game, game 16 in the match</p>
<p>where I just also managed to outplay Karpov completely</p>
<p>with black pieces, just paralyzing his entire army</p>
<p>in its own camp.</p>
<p>Technically or psychologically,</p>
<p>or was that a mix of both in game 16?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it was a big blow to Karpov.</p>
<p>I think it was a big psychological victory</p>
<p>for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>One, the score was equal at the time</p>
<p>and the world champion by the rules</p>
<p>could retain his title in case of a tie.</p>
<p>So we still have, before game 16, we have nine games to go.</p>
<p>And also it was some sort of a bluff</p>
<p>because neither me nor Karpov saw the refutation</p>
<p>of this opening idea.</p>
<p>And I think it says for Karpov, it was double blow</p>
<p>because not that he lost the game, I should triple blow.</p>
<p>He lost the game, it was a brilliant game</p>
<p>and I played impeccably after just this opening bluff.</p>
<p>And then they discovered that it was a bluff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the, again, I didn&rsquo;t know, I was not bluffing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it happens very often.</p>
<p>Some ideas could be refuted.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, what I found out,</p>
<p>and this is again, going back to your spiritual theme</p>
<p>is that you could spend a lot of time working.</p>
<p>And when I say you could, it&rsquo;s in the 80s, in the 90s.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen these days because everybody</p>
<p>has a computer.</p>
<p>You could immediately see if it works or it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Machine shows your refutation in a split of a second.</p>
<p>But many of the analysis in the 80s or in the 90s,</p>
<p>they were not perfect simply because we&rsquo;re humans</p>
<p>and just you analyze the game,</p>
<p>you look for some fresh ideas.</p>
<p>And then just it happens that there was something</p>
<p>that you missed because the level of the concentration</p>
<p>at the chess board is different from when you analyze</p>
<p>the game, just moving the pieces around.</p>
<p>And, but somehow if you spend a lot of time</p>
<p>at the chess board preparing, so in your studies</p>
<p>with your coaches, hours and hours and hours,</p>
<p>and nothing of what you found could,</p>
<p>had materialized on the chess board.</p>
<p>Somehow these hours help, I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>always helped you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if the amount of work you did could be transformed</p>
<p>into some sort of spiritual energy that helped you</p>
<p>to come up with other great ideas during the board.</p>
<p>Again, even if there was no direct connection</p>
<p>between your preparation and your victory in the game,</p>
<p>there was always some sort of invisible connection</p>
<p>between the amount of work you did,</p>
<p>your dedication to actually, and your passion</p>
<p>to discover new ideas, and your ability during the game</p>
<p>at the chess board, when the clock was ticking,</p>
<p>we still had ticking clock, not digital clock at the time.</p>
<p>So to come up with some brilliance.</p>
<p>And I also can mention many games from the 90s.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the, obviously all amateurs would pick up my game</p>
<p>against Veselin Topalov in 1999 and V. Konzai.</p>
<p>Again, because it was a brilliant game,</p>
<p>the Black King traveled from its own camp</p>
<p>to into White&rsquo;s camp across the entire board.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen often, trust me, as you know,</p>
<p>in the games with professional players,</p>
<p>top professional players.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why visually it was one</p>
<p>of the most impressive victories.</p>
<p>But I could bring to your attention many other games</p>
<p>that were not so impressive for amateurs,</p>
<p>not so beautiful, just because it&rsquo;s sacrifice</p>
<p>is always beautiful, you sacrifice pieces.</p>
<p>And then eventually you have very few resources left</p>
<p>and you use them just to crush your opponent basically.</p>
<p>You have to make the king because you have almost</p>
<p>nothing left at your disposal.</p>
<p>But up to the very end, again, less and less,</p>
<p>but still up to the very end, I always had games</p>
<p>with some sort of interesting ideas</p>
<p>and games that gave me great satisfaction.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s what happened from 2005 up to these days</p>
<p>was also a very big accomplishment</p>
<p>since I had to find myself to sort of relocate myself.</p>
<p>Yeah, rechannel the creative energies.</p>
<p>Exactly, and to find something where I feel comfortable,</p>
<p>even confident that my participation</p>
<p>still makes the difference.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>So let me ask perhaps a silly question,</p>
<p>but sticking on chest for just a little longer.</p>
<p>Where do you put Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion</p>
<p>in the list of all time greats?</p>
<p>In terms of style, moments of brilliance, consistency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tricky question.</p>
<p>The moment you start ranking world champions.</p>
<p>Yeah, you lose something?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not fair because any new generation</p>
<p>knows much more about the game than the previous one.</p>
<p>So when people say, oh, Gary was the greatest,</p>
<p>Fischer was the greatest, Magnus was the greatest,</p>
<p>it disregard the fact that the great players of the past,</p>
<p>whether it was Alaskia, Capoplank, Alokian,</p>
<p>I mean, they knew so little about chess</p>
<p>by today&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>I mean, today, just any kid that spent a few years</p>
<p>with his or her chess computer knows much more</p>
<p>about the game simply just because you have access</p>
<p>to this information.</p>
<p>And it has been discovered generation after generation.</p>
<p>We added more and more knowledge to the game of chess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the gap between the world champion</p>
<p>and the rest of the field.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the, now, if you look at the gap,</p>
<p>then probably Fischer could be on top,</p>
<p>but very short period of time.</p>
<p>Then you should also add a time factor.</p>
<p>I was on top, not as big as Fischer, but much longer.</p>
<p>So, and also, unlike Fischer,</p>
<p>I succeeded in beating next generation.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if you still got the fire,</p>
<p>speaking of the next generation,</p>
<p>because you did succeed beating the next generation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>Okay, Anand, Short, Anand, the sheer of,</p>
<p>Kramnik is already 12 years younger.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the next.</p>
<p>But still yet, I competed with them</p>
<p>and I just, I beat most of them.</p>
<p>And I was still dominant when I left at age of 41.</p>
<p>So back to Magnus.</p>
<p>Magnus, I mean, consistency is phenomenal.</p>
<p>The reason Magnus is on top,</p>
<p>and it seems unbeatable today,</p>
<p>Magnus is a lethal combination of Fischer and Karpov,</p>
<p>which is very, it&rsquo;s very unusual</p>
<p>because Fischer&rsquo;s style was very dynamic,</p>
<p>just fighting to the last point,</p>
<p>just using every resource available.</p>
<p>Karpov was very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an unparalleled ability</p>
<p>to use every piece with a maximum effect.</p>
<p>Just its minimal resources always produce maximum effect.</p>
<p>So now imagine that you merge these two styles.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s squeezing every stone for a drop of water,</p>
<p>but doing it, you know, just, you know,</p>
<p>for 50, 60, 70, 80 moves.</p>
<p>I mean, Magnus could go on as long as Fischer</p>
<p>with all his passion and energy.</p>
<p>And at the same time being as meticulous</p>
<p>and deadly as Karpov by just, you know,</p>
<p>using every little advantage.</p>
<p>So, and he has good, you know, very good health.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I mean, physical conditions are, by the way,</p>
<p>very important.</p>
<p>So a lot of people don&rsquo;t recognize it.</p>
<p>Their latest study shows that chess players</p>
<p>burn thousands of calories during the game.</p>
<p>So that puts him on the top of this field</p>
<p>of the world champions.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s the discussion that is,</p>
<p>I saw recently on the internet,</p>
<p>whether Garry Kasparov of his peak,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say late eighties, could beat Magnus Carlsen today.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s certainly irrelevant</p>
<p>because Garry Kasparov in 1989, okay,</p>
<p>has played great chess,</p>
<p>but still I knew very little about chess</p>
<p>compared to Magnus Carlsen in 2019,</p>
<p>who by the way, learned from me as well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely cautious in making any judgment</p>
<p>that involves, you know, time gaps.</p>
<p>You ask, you know, soccer fans.</p>
<p>So who is your favorite?</p>
<p>Pele, Maradona, or Messi?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, who&rsquo;s your favorite?</p>
<p>Messi.</p>
<p>Yeah, why?</p>
<p>Because?</p>
<p>Maybe Maradona, maybe.</p>
<p>Not because you&rsquo;re younger, but that&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>Your instinctive answer is correct</p>
<p>because you saw, you didn&rsquo;t see Maradona in action.</p>
<p>I saw all of them in action.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why, but since, you know,</p>
<p>when I was, you know, just following it, you know,</p>
<p>just Pele and Maradona, they were just, you know,</p>
<p>they were big stars and it&rsquo;s, Messi&rsquo;s already just,</p>
<p>I was gradually losing interest in just other things.</p>
<p>So I remember Pele in 1970, the final match Brazil Italy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first World Cup soccer I watched.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the, and actually my answer when I just,</p>
<p>when I just, you know,</p>
<p>because I was asked this question as well.</p>
<p>So I say that it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s impossible to make a choice,</p>
<p>I would still probably go with Maradona for simple reason.</p>
<p>The Brazilian team in 1970 could have won without Pele.</p>
<p>It was absolutely great.</p>
<p>Still could have won, maybe, but it is,</p>
<p>Argentinian team in 1986 without Maradona</p>
<p>would not be in the final.</p>
<p>So this is, and Messi, he still hasn&rsquo;t won a title.</p>
<p>You could argue for that for an hour,</p>
<p>but you could say, if you ask Maradona,</p>
<p>if you look in his eyes, especially,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say Gary Kasparov in 1989,</p>
<p>he would have said,</p>
<p>I was sure as hell would beat Magnus Carlsen.</p>
<p>Just simply because. The confidence, the fire.</p>
<p>Simply because, again, they saw me in action.</p>
<p>So this, again, it&rsquo;s the age factor that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Definitely with the passion and energy</p>
<p>and being equipped with all modern ideas.</p>
<p>But again, then you make, you know,</p>
<p>a very just important assumption</p>
<p>that you could empower Gary Kasparov in 1989</p>
<p>with all ideas that have been accumulated over 30 years.</p>
<p>That would not be Gary Kasparov.</p>
<p>That would be someone else.</p>
<p>Because again, I belong to 1989.</p>
<p>I was way ahead of the field.</p>
<p>And I beat Karpov several times</p>
<p>in the World Championship matches.</p>
<p>And I crossed 2800, which, by the way,</p>
<p>if you look at the, in the rating,</p>
<p>which is just, even today,</p>
<p>so this is the rating that I retire.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still, you know, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a top two, three.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Caruana and Ding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the same rating now.</p>
<p>And I crossed 2800 in 1990.</p>
<p>Well, just you look at the inflation.</p>
<p>When I crossed 2800 in 1990,</p>
<p>there was only one player in 2700 category,</p>
<p>and not only Karpov.</p>
<p>Now we had more than 50.</p>
<p>So just, when you see this, so if you add inflation,</p>
<p>so I think my 2851, it could probably,</p>
<p>could be more valuable as Magnus 2882,</p>
<p>which was his highest rating.</p>
<p>But anyway, again, too many hypotheticals.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re lost to IBM Deep Blue in 1997.</p>
<p>In my eyes, that is one of the most seminal moments</p>
<p>in the history.</p>
<p>Again, I apologize for being romanticizing the notion,</p>
<p>but in the history of our civilization,</p>
<p>because humans, as the civilizations,</p>
<p>for centuries saw chess as, you know,</p>
<p>the peak of what man can accomplish</p>
<p>of intellectual mastery, right?</p>
<p>And that moment when a machine could beat a human being</p>
<p>was inspiring to just an entire,</p>
<p>anyone who cares about science, innovation,</p>
<p>an entire generation of AI researchers.</p>
<p>And yet, to you that loss, at least if reading your face,</p>
<p>was, seemed like a tragedy, extremely painful.</p>
<p>Like you said, physically painful.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>When you look back at your psychology of that loss,</p>
<p>why was it so painful?</p>
<p>Were you not able to see the seminal nature of that moment?</p>
<p>Or was that exactly why it was that painful?</p>
<p>As I already said, losing was painful, physically painful.</p>
<p>And the match I lost in 1997</p>
<p>was not the first match I lost to a machine.</p>
<p>It was the first match I lost, period.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that makes all the difference to me.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>First time I lost, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, I lost, and the reason I was so angry</p>
<p>that I just, you know, I had suspicions</p>
<p>that my loss was not just a result of my bad play.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So though I played quite poorly, you know,</p>
<p>just when you started looking at the games today,</p>
<p>I made tons of mistakes.</p>
<p>But, you know, I had all reasons to believe that,</p>
<p>you know, there were other factors</p>
<p>that had nothing to do with the game of chess.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I was angry.</p>
<p>But look, it was 22 years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s water under the bridge.</p>
<p>We can analyze this match,</p>
<p>and this is with everything you said.</p>
<p>I agree with probably one exception,</p>
<p>is that considering chess, you know,</p>
<p>as the sort of, as a pinnacle of intellectual activities,</p>
<p>was our mistake.</p>
<p>Because, you know, we just thought,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s a game of the highest intellect,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, you know, you have to be so,</p>
<p>you know, intelligent, and you could see things</p>
<p>that, you know, the ordinary mortals could not see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a game, and all machines had to do with this game</p>
<p>is just to make fewer mistakes, not to solve the game.</p>
<p>Because the game cannot be solved.</p>
<p>I mean, according to Kovalevich Shannon,</p>
<p>the number of legal moves is 10 to the 46th power.</p>
<p>Too many zeros, so just for any computer</p>
<p>to finish the job, you know, in next few billion years.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about making fewer mistakes.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the, this match,</p>
<p>this match actually, and what&rsquo;s happened afterwards</p>
<p>with other games, with Go, with Shoggy, with video games.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a demonstration that machines will always be humans</p>
<p>in what I call closed systems.</p>
<p>The moment you build a closed system,</p>
<p>no matter how the system&rsquo;s called, chess, Go, Shoggy,</p>
<p>Dota, machines will prevail simply because they will</p>
<p>bring down a number of mistakes.</p>
<p>Machines don&rsquo;t have to solve it, they just have to,</p>
<p>the way they outplay us, it&rsquo;s not by just being</p>
<p>more intelligent, it&rsquo;s just by doing something else,</p>
<p>but eventually it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s capitalizing on our mistakes.</p>
<p>When you look at the chess machines ratings today,</p>
<p>and compare this to Magnus Carlsen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same as comparing Ferrari to Usain Bolt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, the gap is, I mean, by chess standards,</p>
<p>is insane, 34, 3500 to 2800, 2850 on Magnus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like difference between Magnus and an ordinary player</p>
<p>from an open international tournament.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because machine understanding</p>
<p>is better than Magnus Carlsen,</p>
<p>but simply because it&rsquo;s steady.</p>
<p>Machine has steady hand.</p>
<p>And I think that is what we, we, we,</p>
<p>we have to learn from 1997 experience,</p>
<p>and from further encounters with computers,</p>
<p>and sort of the current state of affairs with AlphaZero,</p>
<p>beating other machines.</p>
<p>The idea that we can compete with computers</p>
<p>in so called intellectual fields,</p>
<p>it was wrong from the very beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s, by the way, the 1997 match</p>
<p>was not the first victory of machines over AlphaZero.</p>
<p>Or grandmasters.</p>
<p>No, actually it&rsquo;s, I played against</p>
<p>first decent chess computers from late, from late 80s.</p>
<p>So I played with the prototype of Deep Blue</p>
<p>called Deep Thought in 1989,</p>
<p>two rapid chess games in New York,</p>
<p>I won handily to both games.</p>
<p>We played against new chess engines like Fritz,</p>
<p>and other programs.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s the, it was Israeli program Junior</p>
<p>that appeared in 1995.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there were, there were several programs.</p>
<p>I, you know, I lost few games in Blitz.</p>
<p>I lost one match against the computer chess engine</p>
<p>1994 rapid chess.</p>
<p>So I lost one game to Deep Blue in 1996 match,</p>
<p>the man, the match I won.</p>
<p>Some people, you know, tend to forget about it</p>
<p>that I won the first match.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, we,</p>
<p>we made a very important psychological mistake</p>
<p>thinking that the reason we lost Blitz matches,</p>
<p>five, five minutes games.</p>
<p>The reason we lost some of the rapid chess matches,</p>
<p>25 minutes chess.</p>
<p>Because we didn&rsquo;t have enough time.</p>
<p>If you play a longer match,</p>
<p>we will not make the same mistakes.</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>So this, yeah, we had more time,</p>
<p>but we still make mistakes.</p>
<p>And machine also has more time.</p>
<p>And machines, machine will always, you know,</p>
<p>will always be steady and consistent</p>
<p>compared to humans instabilities and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>And today we are at the point where yes,</p>
<p>nobody talks about, you know,</p>
<p>humans playing as machines.</p>
<p>Now machines can offer handicap to top players</p>
<p>and still, you know, will, will, will be favored.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re just learning that it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no longer human versus machines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about human working with machines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I recognized in 1998,</p>
<p>just after leaking my wounds and spending one year</p>
<p>in just, you know, ruminating so the,</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s happened in this match.</p>
<p>And I knew that though we still could play</p>
<p>against the machines.</p>
<p>I had two more matches in, in 2003,</p>
<p>playing both Deep Fritz and Deep Junior.</p>
<p>Both matches ended as a tie.</p>
<p>Though these machines were not weaker,</p>
<p>at least actually probably stronger than Deep Blue.</p>
<p>And by the way, today chess app on your mobile phone</p>
<p>is probably stronger than Deep Blue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not speaking about chess engines</p>
<p>that are so much superior.</p>
<p>And by the way, when you analyze games</p>
<p>we played against Deep Blue in 1997 on your chess engine,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be laughing.</p>
<p>So this is, and it&rsquo;s also shows that&rsquo;s how chess changed</p>
<p>because chess commentators, they look at some of our games</p>
<p>like game four, game five, brilliant idea.</p>
<p>Now you ask Stockfish, you ask Houdini,</p>
<p>you ask Commodore, all the leading chess engines.</p>
<p>Within 30 seconds, they will show you how many mistakes</p>
<p>both Gary and Deep Blue made in the game</p>
<p>that was trumpeted as the, as a great chess match in 1997.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve made an interesting,</p>
<p>if you can untangle that comment.</p>
<p>So now in retrospect, it was a mistake to see chess</p>
<p>as the peak of human intellect.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that was done for centuries.</p>
<p>So by the way, in Europe, because you know,</p>
<p>you move to the far East, they will go,</p>
<p>they had show games.</p>
<p>But games, games.</p>
<p>Again, some of the games like, you know, board games.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>So if I push back a little bit, so now you say that,</p>
<p>okay, but it was a mistake to see chess as the epitome</p>
<p>and now, and then now there&rsquo;s other things maybe</p>
<p>like language, that conversation,</p>
<p>like some of the things that in your view</p>
<p>is still way out of reach of computers, but inside humans.</p>
<p>Do you think, can you talk about what those things might be?</p>
<p>And do you think just like chess, they might fall?</p>
<p>Soon with the same set of approaches,</p>
<p>if you look at AlphaZero,</p>
<p>the same kind of learning approaches</p>
<p>as the machines grow in size.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s not about growing in size.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about, again, it&rsquo;s about understanding the difference</p>
<p>between closed system and open ended system.</p>
<p>So you think that key difference,</p>
<p>so the board games are closed in terms of the rule set,</p>
<p>the actions, the state space, everything is just constrained.</p>
<p>You think once you open it, the machines are lost?</p>
<p>Not lost, but again, the effectiveness is very different</p>
<p>because machine does not understand the moment</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reaching territory of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, to put it in a different way,</p>
<p>machine doesn&rsquo;t know how to ask right questions.</p>
<p>It can ask questions, but it will never tell you</p>
<p>which questions are relevant.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s like about the, it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a direction.</p>
<p>So these, it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s in human machine relations,</p>
<p>we have to consider, so our role and people,</p>
<p>many people feel uncomfortable that this,</p>
<p>the territory that belongs to us is shrinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, so what, you know, this is,</p>
<p>eventually we&rsquo;ll belong to the last few decimal points,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like having, so a very powerful gun,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, and all you can do there is slightly,</p>
<p>you know, alter direction of the bullet.</p>
<p>Maybe, you know, 0.1 degree of this angle,</p>
<p>but that means a mile away, 10 meters of target.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, we have to recognize that is a certain</p>
<p>unique human qualities that machines in a foreseeable future</p>
<p>will not be able to reproduce.</p>
<p>And the effectiveness of this cooperation,</p>
<p>collaboration depends on our understanding</p>
<p>what exactly we can bring into the game.</p>
<p>So the greatest danger is when we try to interfere</p>
<p>with machine superior knowledge.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I always say that sometimes you&rsquo;d rather have,</p>
<p>by reading these pictures in radiology,</p>
<p>you may probably prefer an experienced nurse</p>
<p>than rather than having top professor,</p>
<p>because she will not try to interfere</p>
<p>with machines understanding.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important to know that if machines knows</p>
<p>how to do better things in 95%, 96% of territory,</p>
<p>we should not touch it because it&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in chess, recognize they do it better.</p>
<p>See where we can make the difference.</p>
<p>You mentioned AlphaZero, I mean, AlphaZero is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a first step into what you may call AI,</p>
<p>because everything that&rsquo;s being called AI today,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s one or another variation</p>
<p>of what Claude Shannon characterized as a brute force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a type A machine, whether it&rsquo;s Deep Blue,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Watson, and all these modern technologies</p>
<p>that are being trumpeted as AI, it&rsquo;s still brute force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, all they do, it&rsquo;s they do optimization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this, they are, you know, they keep, you know,</p>
<p>improving the way to process human generated data.</p>
<p>Now, AlphaZero is the first step towards, you know,</p>
<p>machine produced knowledge.</p>
<p>Which is, by the way, it&rsquo;s quite ironic</p>
<p>that the first company that championed that was IBM.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s in backgammon.</p>
<p>Interesting, in backgammon.</p>
<p>Yes, you should look at IBM, it&rsquo;s a newer gammon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the scientist called Cesaro.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still working at IBM.</p>
<p>They had it in the early 90s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the program that played, you know, the AlphaZero type,</p>
<p>so just trying to come up with own strategies.</p>
<p>But because of success of Deep Blue,</p>
<p>this project had been not abandoned,</p>
<p>but just, you know, it was put on hold.</p>
<p>And now we just, you know, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>everybody talks about this,</p>
<p>the machines generated knowledge, so as revolutionary.</p>
<p>And it is, but there&rsquo;s still, you know,</p>
<p>many open ended questions.</p>
<p>Yes, AlphaZero generates its own data.</p>
<p>Many ideas that AlphaZero generated in chess</p>
<p>were quite intriguing.</p>
<p>So I looked at these games with,</p>
<p>not just with interest, but with, you know,</p>
<p>it was quite exciting to learn how machine</p>
<p>could actually, you know, juggle all the pieces</p>
<p>and just play positions with a broken material balance,</p>
<p>sacrificing material, always being ahead of other programs,</p>
<p>you know, one or two moves ahead</p>
<p>by foreseeing the consequences,</p>
<p>not overcalculating because machines,</p>
<p>other machines were at least as powerful in calculating,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s having this unique knowledge</p>
<p>based on discovered patterns after playing 60 million games.</p>
<p>Almost something that feels like intuition.</p>
<p>Exactly, but there&rsquo;s one problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, the simple question,</p>
<p>if AlphaZero faces superior point,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say another powerful computer accompanied by a human</p>
<p>who could help just to discover certain problems,</p>
<p>because I already, I look at many AlphaZero games.</p>
<p>I visited their lab, you know,</p>
<p>spoke to Demis Hassabis and his team,</p>
<p>and I know there&rsquo;s certain weaknesses there.</p>
<p>Now, if these weaknesses are exposed,</p>
<p>the question is how many games will it take</p>
<p>for AlphaZero to correct it?</p>
<p>The answer is hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>Even if it keeps losing, it can,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just because the whole system is based.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s now, imagine so this is,</p>
<p>you can have a human by just making a few tweaks.</p>
<p>So humans are still more flexible.</p>
<p>And as long as we recognize what is our role,</p>
<p>where we can play sort of,</p>
<p>so the most valuable part in this collaboration.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it will help us to understand</p>
<p>what are the next steps in human machine collaboration.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the thing that machines</p>
<p>certainly don&rsquo;t know how to do yet, which is morality.</p>
<p>Machines and morality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another question that, you know,</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s being asked all the time these days.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s another phantom</p>
<p>that is haunting a general public</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just being fed with this,</p>
<p>you know, illusions is that how can we avoid machines,</p>
<p>you know, having bias, being prejudiced?</p>
<p>You cannot, because it&rsquo;s like looking in the mirror</p>
<p>and complaining about what you see.</p>
<p>If you have certain bias in the society,</p>
<p>machine will just follow it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s, you know, you look at the mirror,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like what you see there.</p>
<p>You can, you know, you can break it.</p>
<p>You can try to distort it.</p>
<p>Or you can try to actually change something.</p>
<p>Just by yourself.</p>
<p>By yourself, yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>is that you cannot expect machines</p>
<p>to improve the ills of our society.</p>
<p>And moreover machines will simply, you know,</p>
<p>just, you know, amplify it.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>But the thing is people are more comfortable</p>
<p>with other people doing injustice, with being biased.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not comfortable with machines</p>
<p>having the same kind of bias.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting standard</p>
<p>that we place on machines.</p>
<p>With autonomous vehicles, they have to be much safer.</p>
<p>With automated systems.</p>
<p>Of course they&rsquo;re much safer.</p>
<p>Statistically, they&rsquo;re much safer than.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not of course.</p>
<p>Why would, it&rsquo;s not of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not given.</p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles, you have to work really hard</p>
<p>to make them safer.</p>
<p>I think it just, it goes without saying</p>
<p>is the outcome of this,</p>
<p>I would call it competition with comparison is very clear.</p>
<p>But the problem is not about being, you know, safer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the 40,000 people or so every year died</p>
<p>in car accidents in the United States.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s statistics.</p>
<p>One accident with autonomous vehicle</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s front page of a newspaper.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, again, it&rsquo;s about psychology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s while people, you know,</p>
<p>kill each other in car accidents</p>
<p>because they make mistakes, they make more mistakes.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s not a question.</p>
<p>Of course we make more mistakes because we&rsquo;re human.</p>
<p>Yes, machines are old.</p>
<p>And by the way, no machine will ever reach 100% perfection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another important fake story</p>
<p>that is being fed to the public.</p>
<p>If machine doesn&rsquo;t reach 100% performance, it&rsquo;s not safe.</p>
<p>No, all you can ask any computer,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s, you know, playing chess</p>
<p>or doing the stock market calculations</p>
<p>or driving your autonomous vehicle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to make fewer mistakes.</p>
<p>And yes, I know it&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy for us to accept because ah,</p>
<p>if, you know, if you have two humans, you know,</p>
<p>colliding in their cars, okay, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if one of these cars is autonomous vehicle,</p>
<p>and by the way, even if it&rsquo;s humans fault, terrible.</p>
<p>How could you allow a machine to run</p>
<p>without a driver at the wheel?</p>
<p>So, you know, let&rsquo;s linger that for a second,</p>
<p>that double standard, the way you felt</p>
<p>with your first loss against Deep Blue,</p>
<p>were you treating the machine differently</p>
<p>than you would have a human?</p>
<p>Or, so what do you think about that difference</p>
<p>between the way we see machines and humans?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the, at that time, you know, for me it was a match.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I was angry because I believed that</p>
<p>the match was not, you know, fairly organized.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, definitely there were unfair advantages for IBM</p>
<p>and I wanted to play another match, like a rubber match.</p>
<p>So your anger or displeasure was aimed more like</p>
<p>at the humans behind IBM versus the actual pure algorithm.</p>
<p>Absolutely, look, I knew at the time,</p>
<p>and by the way, I was, objectively speaking,</p>
<p>I was stronger at that time.</p>
<p>So that probably added to my anger</p>
<p>because I knew I could beat the machine.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, so that&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>and as I lost, and I knew I was not well prepared.</p>
<p>So because they, I have to give them credit.</p>
<p>They did some good work from 1996 and I,</p>
<p>but I still could beat the machine.</p>
<p>So I made too many mistakes.</p>
<p>Also, this is the whole, it&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>the publicity around the match.</p>
<p>So I underestimated the effect, you know, just it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and being called the, you know, the brain&rsquo;s last stand,</p>
<p>you know, okay, no pressure.</p>
<p>Okay, well, let me ask.</p>
<p>So I was born also in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>What lessons do you draw from the rise and fall</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union in the 20th century?</p>
<p>When you just look at this nation</p>
<p>that is now pushing forward into what Russia is,</p>
<p>if you look at the long arc of history of the 20th century,</p>
<p>what do we take away?</p>
<p>What do we take away from that?</p>
<p>I think the lesson of history is clear.</p>
<p>Undemocratic systems, totalitarian regimes,</p>
<p>systems that are based on controlling their citizens</p>
<p>and just every aspect of their life,</p>
<p>not offering opportunities to, for private initiative,</p>
<p>central planning systems, they&rsquo;re doomed.</p>
<p>They just, you know, they cannot be driving force</p>
<p>for innovation, so they, in the history timeline,</p>
<p>I mean, they could cause certain, you know,</p>
<p>distortion of the concept of progress.</p>
<p>They, by the way, they may call themselves progressive,</p>
<p>but we know that the damage that they caused to humanity</p>
<p>is just, it&rsquo;s yet to be measured.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, they fail.</p>
<p>They fail, and the end of the Cold War was a great triumph</p>
<p>of the free world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that the free world is perfect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important to recognize the fact that,</p>
<p>I always like to mention, you know,</p>
<p>one of my favorite books, The Lord of the Rings,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no absolute good, but there is an absolute evil.</p>
<p>Good, you know, comes in many forms,</p>
<p>but we all, you know, it&rsquo;s being humans</p>
<p>or being even, you know, humans from fairy tales</p>
<p>or just some sort of mythical creatures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, you can always find spots on the songs.</p>
<p>So this is conducting war and just,</p>
<p>and fighting for justice.</p>
<p>There are always things that, you know,</p>
<p>can be easily criticized.</p>
<p>And human history is the,</p>
<p>is a never ending quest for perfection.</p>
<p>But we know that there is absolute evil.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s, for me, it&rsquo;s no clear, it&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>nobody argues about Hitler being absolute evil,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s very important to recognize</p>
<p>Stalin was absolute evil.</p>
<p>Communism caused more damage</p>
<p>than any other ideology in the 20th century.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, while we all know</p>
<p>that fascism was condemned,</p>
<p>but there was no Nuremberg for communism.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we could see, you know,</p>
<p>still the successors of Stalin</p>
<p>are feeling far more comfortable.</p>
<p>And Putin is one of them.</p>
<p>You highlight a few interesting connections actually</p>
<p>between Stalin and Hitler.</p>
<p>I mean, in terms of the adjusting</p>
<p>or clarifying the history of World War II,</p>
<p>which is very interesting.</p>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t have time.</p>
<p>So let me ask.</p>
<p>You can ask, you know,</p>
<p>I just recently delivered a speech in Toronto</p>
<p>at 80th anniversary of Molotov Ribbentrop Pact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I believe, you know,</p>
<p>just, you know, has, must be taught in the schools</p>
<p>that the World War II had been started by two dictators</p>
<p>by signing these criminal treaty,</p>
<p>collusion of two tyrants in August 1939</p>
<p>that led to the beginning of the World War II.</p>
<p>And the fact is that eventually Stalin had no choice</p>
<p>but to join allies because Hitler attacked him.</p>
<p>So it just doesn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>eliminate the fact that Stalin helped Hitler</p>
<p>to start World War II.</p>
<p>And he was one of the beneficiaries at early stage</p>
<p>by annexing a part of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>And as a result of the World War II,</p>
<p>he annexed almost entire Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>And for many Eastern European nations,</p>
<p>the end of the World War II</p>
<p>was the beginning of communist occupation.</p>
<p>So Putin, you&rsquo;ve talked about as a man who stands</p>
<p>between Russia and democracy, essentially today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a strong opponent and critic of Putin.</p>
<p>Let me ask again, how much does fear</p>
<p>enter your mind and heart?</p>
<p>So in 2007, there&rsquo;s this interesting comment</p>
<p>from Oleg Kalugin, KGB general.</p>
<p>He said that I do not talk details.</p>
<p>People who knew them are all dead now</p>
<p>because they were vocal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quiet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one man who&rsquo;s vocal and he may be in trouble.</p>
<p>World Chess champion Kasparov.</p>
<p>He has been very outspoken in his attacks on Putin.</p>
<p>And I believe he&rsquo;s probably next on the list.</p>
<p>So clearly your life has been</p>
<p>and perhaps continues to be in danger.</p>
<p>How do you think about having the views you have,</p>
<p>the ideas you have, being in opposition as you are</p>
<p>in this kind of context when your life could be in danger?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason I live in New York.</p>
<p>So it was not my first choice,</p>
<p>but I knew I had to leave Russia at one point.</p>
<p>And among other places, New York is the safest.</p>
<p>Is it safe?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, I know what happened,</p>
<p>what is happening with many of Putin&rsquo;s enemies.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I mean, what can I do?</p>
<p>I could be very proactive</p>
<p>by trying to change things I can influence.</p>
<p>But here are a few facts.</p>
<p>I cannot stop doing what I&rsquo;ve been doing for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I grew up with my family teaching me</p>
<p>sort of the wisdom of Soviet dissidents,</p>
<p>do what you must and so be.</p>
<p>I could try to be cautious by not traveling</p>
<p>to certain places where my security could be at risk.</p>
<p>There are so many invitations to speak</p>
<p>at different locations in the world.</p>
<p>And I have to say that many countries are just now</p>
<p>are not destinations that I can afford to travel.</p>
<p>My mother still lives in Moscow.</p>
<p>I meet her a few times a year.</p>
<p>She was devastated when I had to leave Russia</p>
<p>because since my father died in 1971,</p>
<p>so she was 33 and she dedicated her entire life</p>
<p>to her only son.</p>
<p>But she recognized in just a year or so</p>
<p>since I left Russia that it was the only chance</p>
<p>for me to continue my normal life.</p>
<p>So just to, I mean, to be relatively safe</p>
<p>and to do what she taught me to do to make the difference.</p>
<p>Do you think you will ever return to Russia</p>
<p>or let me ask a different way?</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>Even sooner than many people think</p>
<p>because I think Putin&rsquo;s regime</p>
<p>is facing unsurmountable difficulties.</p>
<p>And again, I read enough historical books</p>
<p>to know that dictatorships, they end suddenly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just on Sunday, dictator feels comfortable.</p>
<p>He believes he&rsquo;s popular on Monday morning, he&rsquo;s bust.</p>
<p>The good news and bad news.</p>
<p>I mean, the bad news is that I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>when and how Putin rule ends.</p>
<p>The good news, he also doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay, well put.</p>
<p>Let me ask a question that seems to preoccupy</p>
<p>the American mind from the perspective of Russia.</p>
<p>One, did Russia interfere in the 2016 U.S. election,</p>
<p>government sanction and future?</p>
<p>Two, will Russia interfere in the 2020 U.S. election?</p>
<p>And what does that interference look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very old.</p>
<p>We had such an intelligent conversation.</p>
<p>And you are ruining everything</p>
<p>by asking such a stupid question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insulting for my intellect.</p>
<p>Of course they did interfere.</p>
<p>Of course they did absolutely everything to elect Trump.</p>
<p>I mean, they said it many times.</p>
<p>It is just, you know, I met enough KGB colonels in my life</p>
<p>to tell you that, you know,</p>
<p>just the way Putin looks at Trump, this is the way.</p>
<p>Look, and I don&rsquo;t have to hear what he says,</p>
<p>what Trump says, it just is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to go through congressional investigations.</p>
<p>The way Putin looks at Trump</p>
<p>is the way the KGB officers looked at the assets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, and following to 2020,</p>
<p>of course they will do absolutely everything</p>
<p>to help Trump to survive.</p>
<p>Because I think the damage that Trump&rsquo;s reelections</p>
<p>could cause to America and to the free world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s beyond one&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>I think basically if Trump is reelected,</p>
<p>he will ruin NATO, because he&rsquo;s already heading</p>
<p>in this direction, but now he&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s still limited by the reelection hurdles.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s still in the office after November, 2020,</p>
<p>okay, January, 2021, I don&rsquo;t want to think about it.</p>
<p>My problem is not just Trump,</p>
<p>because Trump is basically, it&rsquo;s a symptom.</p>
<p>But the problem is that I don&rsquo;t see,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s the, in American political horizon,</p>
<p>politicians who could take on Trump</p>
<p>for all damage that he&rsquo;s doing for the free world.</p>
<p>Not just things that has happened</p>
<p>that went wrong in America.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the, it seems to me that the campaign,</p>
<p>political campaign on the Democratic side</p>
<p>is fixed on certain important, but still secondary issues.</p>
<p>Because when you have the foundation of the republic</p>
<p>in jeopardy, I mean, you cannot talk about healthcare.</p>
<p>I mean, I understand how important it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still secondary because the entire framework</p>
<p>of American political life is at risk.</p>
<p>And you have Vladimir Putin just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s having, fortunately, free hands</p>
<p>by attacking America and other free countries.</p>
<p>And by the way, we have so much evidence</p>
<p>about Russian interference in Brexit,</p>
<p>in elections in almost every European country.</p>
<p>And thinking that they will be shy of attacking America</p>
<p>in 2020, now with Trump in the office, yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, yeah, it definitely diminishes</p>
<p>the intellectual quality of our conversation.</p>
<p>I do what I can.</p>
<p>Last question.</p>
<p>If you can go back, just look at the entirety of your life,</p>
<p>you accomplished more than most humans will ever do.</p>
<p>If you could go back and relive a single moment</p>
<p>in your life, what would that moment be?</p>
<p>There are moments in my life when I think</p>
<p>about what could be done differently, but.</p>
<p>No, experience happiness and joy and pride.</p>
<p>Just a touch once again.</p>
<p>I know, I know, but it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>I made many mistakes in my life.</p>
<p>So I just, it&rsquo;s the, I know that at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I believe in the butterfly effect.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s the, I knew moments where I could,</p>
<p>now if I&rsquo;m there at that point in 89 and 93,</p>
<p>you pick up a year, I could improve my actions</p>
<p>by not doing this stupid thing.</p>
<p>But then how do you know</p>
<p>that I will have all other accomplishments?</p>
<p>I just, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m afraid that, you know,</p>
<p>we just have to just follow this,</p>
<p>if you may call wisdom before is gump, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the life is this, you know, it&rsquo;s, this is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a box of, of, of, of chocolate</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s inside,</p>
<p>but you have to go one by one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m happy with who I am</p>
<p>and where I am today.</p>
<p>And I am very proud, not only with my chess accomplishments,</p>
<p>but that I made this transition.</p>
<p>And since I left chess, you know,</p>
<p>I built my own reputation that had some influence</p>
<p>on the game of chess, but not, it&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>directly derived from, from, from the game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for my wife.</p>
<p>So help me to build this life.</p>
<p>We actually married in 2005.</p>
<p>It was my third marriage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I said I&rsquo;d made mistakes in my life.</p>
<p>But, and by the way, I&rsquo;m close with two kids</p>
<p>from my previous marriages.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the, I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>I managed to sort of to balance my life and,</p>
<p>and here in, I live in New York.</p>
<p>So we have our two kids born here in New York.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s new life and it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s busy.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish I could, you know, I could limit</p>
<p>my engagement in many other things that are still,</p>
<p>you know, taking time and energy,</p>
<p>but life is exciting.</p>
<p>And as long as I can feel that I have energy,</p>
<p>I have strengths, I have passion to make the difference,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a beautiful moment to end on.</p>
<p>Gary, thank you very much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
