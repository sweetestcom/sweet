    <p>The following is a conversation with Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist, astronomer,</p>
<p>and cosmologist at Harvard. He has authored over 800 papers and written 8 books,</p>
<p>including his latest, called Extraterrestrial, The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be released in a couple of weeks, so go preorder it now to show support for what I think</p>
<p>is truly an important book in that it serves as a strong example of a scientist being both</p>
<p>rigorous and open minded about the question of intelligent alien civilizations in our universe.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Zero Fasting App for intermittent fasting, Element Electrolyte</p>
<p>Drink, Sun Basket Meal Delivery Service, and Pessimist Archive History Podcast.</p>
<p>So the choices, a fasting app, fasting fuel, fast breaking, delicious meals, and a history podcast</p>
<p>that has very little to do with fasting. Choose wisely my friends, and if you wish,</p>
<p>click the sponsor links below to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say a bit more about why Avi&rsquo;s work is so exciting to me and I think to</p>
<p>a lot of people. In 2017, a strange interstellar object, now named Oumuamua, was detected traveling</p>
<p>through our solar system. Based on the evidence we have, it had strange characteristics which</p>
<p>made it not like any asteroid or comet that we&rsquo;ve seen before. Avi was one of the only</p>
<p>world class scientists who fearlessly suggested that we should be open minded about whether it</p>
<p>is naturally made or in fact is an artifact of an intelligent alien civilization. In fact,</p>
<p>he suggested that the more likely explanation given the evidence is the latter hypothesis.</p>
<p>But we also talk about a lot of fascinating mysteries in our universe including black holes,</p>
<p>dark matter, the big bang, and close to speed of light space travel. The theme throughout is that</p>
<p>in scientific pursuits, the weird things, the anomalies, the ideas that right now are considered</p>
<p>taboo should not be ignored if we are to have a chance at finding the next big breakthrough,</p>
<p>the next big paradigm shift, and also if we are to inspire the world with the power and beauty</p>
<p>of science. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify,</p>
<p>support on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation</p>
<p>with Avi Loeb. In the introduction to your new book, Extraterrestrial, you write,</p>
<p>this book confronts one of the universe&rsquo;s most profound questions, are we alone? Over time,</p>
<p>this question has been framed in different ways. Is life here on Earth the only life in the universe?</p>
<p>Are humans the only sentient intelligence in the vastness of space and time? A better, more precise</p>
<p>framing of this question would be this. Throughout the expanse of space and over the lifetime of the</p>
<p>universe, are there now or have ever been other sentient civilizations that, like ours, explored</p>
<p>the stars and left evidence of their efforts? So let me ask, are we alone? That&rsquo;s an excellent</p>
<p>question. For me, the answer is sort of clear because I start from the principle of modesty.</p>
<p>You know, if we believe that we are alone and special and unique, that shows arrogance. My</p>
<p>daughters, when they were infants, they tended to think that they are special, unique, and then they</p>
<p>went out to the street and realized that other kids are very much like them. And then they</p>
<p>developed a sense of a better perspective about themselves. And I think the only reason that we</p>
<p>are still thinking that we are special is because we haven&rsquo;t searched well enough to find others</p>
<p>that might even be better than us. And, you know, I say that because I look at the newspaper every</p>
<p>morning and I see that we do foolish things. We are not necessarily the most intelligent ones.</p>
<p>And if you think about it, if you open a recipe book, you see that out of the same ingredients,</p>
<p>you can make very different cakes, depending on how you put them together and how you heat them</p>
<p>up. And what is the chance that by taking the soup of chemicals that existed on earth and cooking it</p>
<p>one way to get our life, that you got the best cake possible? I mean, we are probably not the</p>
<p>sharpest cookie in the jar. And my question is, I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious to me that we are</p>
<p>probably not alone because half of all the sun like stars we know now as astronomers, half of</p>
<p>the sun like stars from the Kepler satellite data have a planet the size of the earth, roughly at</p>
<p>the same distance that the earth is from the sun. And that means that they can have liquid water on</p>
<p>their surface and the chemistry of life as we know it. So if you roll the dice billions of times,</p>
<p>just within the Milky Way galaxy, and then you have tens of billions of galaxies like it within</p>
<p>the observable volume of the universe, it would be extremely arrogant to think that we are special.</p>
<p>I would think that we are sort of middle of the road, typical forms of life. And that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>nobody pays attention to us. If you go down the street on a sidewalk and you see an ant,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t pay attention or a special respect to that ant, you just continue to walk. And</p>
<p>so I think that we are sort of average, not very interesting, not exciting, so nobody cares about</p>
<p>us. We tend to think that we are special, but that&rsquo;s a sign of immaturity. And we&rsquo;re very early</p>
<p>on in our development. Yes, that&rsquo;s another thing that we have our technology only for 100 years,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s evolving exponentially right now on a three year timescale. So imagine what would happen</p>
<p>in a hundred years, in a thousand years, in a million years or in a billion years. Now, the Sun</p>
<p>is actually relatively late in the star formation history of the universe. Most of the Sun like stars</p>
<p>formed earlier, and some of them already died, you know, became white dwarfs. And so if you imagine</p>
<p>that a civilization like ours existed around a typical Sun like star, by now, if they survived,</p>
<p>they could be a billion years old. And then imagine a billion year technology, it would</p>
<p>look like magic to us, you know, an approximation to God, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to understand it.</p>
<p>And so in my view, we should be humble. And by the way, we should probably just listen and not speak,</p>
<p>because there is a risk, right? If you are inferior, there is a risk if you speak too loudly,</p>
<p>something bad may happen to you. You mentioned, we should be humble also in the sense,</p>
<p>with the analogy to ants, that they might be better than us. So there&rsquo;s a kind of scale that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about. And in the question, you mentioned the word sentient. So sentience,</p>
<p>or maybe the more basic formulation is consciousness. Do you think that this</p>
<p>thing within us humans in terms of the typical life form of consciousness is the essential</p>
<p>element that permeates other, if there&rsquo;s other alien civilizations out there, that they have</p>
<p>something like consciousness as well? Or is this, I guess I&rsquo;m asking, can you try to untangle the</p>
<p>word sentient? Yeah, so that&rsquo;s a good question. I think what is most abundant, depending on how</p>
<p>long it survives. So if you look at us, as an example, we are now, we do have consciousness</p>
<p>and we do have technology. But the technologies that we are developing are also means for our</p>
<p>own destruction, as we can tell. You know, we can change the climate if we are not careful enough.</p>
<p>We can go into nuclear wars. So we are developing means for our own destruction through</p>
<p>self inflicted wounds. And it might well be that creatures like us are not long lived, that</p>
<p>crocodiles on other planets live for billions of years. They don&rsquo;t destroy themselves, they live</p>
<p>naturally. And so if you look around, the most common thing would be dumb animals that live for</p>
<p>long times, you know, not those that have conscious. But in terms of changing the environment, I think</p>
<p>since, I mean, humans develop tools, they develop the ability to construct technologies that would</p>
<p>lift us from this planet that we were born in. And that&rsquo;s something animals without a</p>
<p>conscious, consciousness cannot really do. And so I, you know, in terms of looking for things</p>
<p>that are new, that went beyond the circumstances they were born into, I would think that even if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re short lived, these are the creatures that made the biggest difference to their environment.</p>
<p>And we can search for them, you know, even if they&rsquo;re short lived, and most of the civilizations</p>
<p>are dead by now. Even if that&rsquo;s the case. That&rsquo;s sad to think about, by the way.</p>
<p>Well, but if you look on Earth, that, you know, there are lots of cultures that existed throughout</p>
<p>time, and they&rsquo;re dead by now. The Mayan culture was very sophisticated, died. But we can find</p>
<p>evidence for it and learn about it just by archaeology, digging into the ground, looking.</p>
<p>And so we can do the same thing in space, look for dead civilizations. And perhaps we can learn a</p>
<p>lesson why they died and behave better so that we will not share the same fate. So I think, you know,</p>
<p>there is a lesson to be learned from the sky. And by the way, I should also say, if we find</p>
<p>a technology that we have not dreamed of, that we can import to Earth, that may be a better</p>
<p>strategy for making a fortune than going to Silicon Valley or going to Wall Street. Because</p>
<p>you make a jump start into something of the future. So that&rsquo;s one way to do the leap is</p>
<p>actually to find, to literally discover versus come up with the idea in our own limited human</p>
<p>capacity, like a cognitive capacity. It would look like, it would feel like cheating in an exam</p>
<p>where you look over the shoulder of a student next to you. Yeah. But it&rsquo;s not good on an exam,</p>
<p>but it is good when you&rsquo;re coming up with technology that could change the fabric of</p>
<p>human civilization. But there is, you know, in my neck of the woods of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of trajectories one can imagine of creating very powerful beings,</p>
<p>the technology that&rsquo;s essentially, you know, you can call super intelligence that could achieve</p>
<p>space exploration, all those kinds of things without consciousness, without something that</p>
<p>to us humans looks like consciousness. And there, you know, there is a sad feeling I have that</p>
<p>consciousness too, in terms of us being humble, is a thing we humans take too seriously. That it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we think it&rsquo;s special just because we have it. But it could be a thing that&rsquo;s actually holding</p>
<p>us back in some kind of way. It may well be. It may well be. I should say something about AI,</p>
<p>because I do think it offers a very important step into the future. If you look at the Old</p>
<p>Testament, the Bible, there is this story about Noah&rsquo;s Ark that you might know about. Noah</p>
<p>knew about a great flood that is about to endanger all life on earth. So he decided to build an ark.</p>
<p>And the Bible actually talks about specifically what the size of this ark was, what the dimensions</p>
<p>were. Turns out it was quite similar to Oumuamua that we will discuss in a few minutes. But at any</p>
<p>event, he built this ark and he put animals on it so that they were saved from the great flood.</p>
<p>Now, you can think about doing the same on earth, because there are risks for future catastrophes.</p>
<p>You know, we could have the self inflicted wounds that we were talking about, like nuclear war,</p>
<p>changing the climate. Or there could be an asteroid impacting us, just like the dinosaurs</p>
<p>died. The dinosaurs didn&rsquo;t have science, astronomy. They couldn&rsquo;t have a warning system.</p>
<p>But there was this big stone, big rock that approached them. It must have been a beautiful</p>
<p>sight. Just when it was approaching, it got very big and then smashed them and killed them. So</p>
<p>you could have a catastrophe like that. Or in a billion years, the sun will basically boil off</p>
<p>all the oceans on earth. And currently all our eggs are in one basket, but we can spread them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like the printing press, if you think about it. The revolution that Gutenberg</p>
<p>brought is there were very few copies of the Bible at the time, and each of them was precious</p>
<p>because it was handwritten. But once the printing press produced multiple copies, you know,</p>
<p>if something bad happened to one of the copies, it wasn&rsquo;t a catastrophe. You know, it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>disaster because you had many more copies. And so if we have copies of life here on earth elsewhere,</p>
<p>then we avoid the risk of it being eliminated by a single point breakdown, catastrophe.</p>
<p>So the question is, can we build NOx spaceship that will carry life as we know it? Now,</p>
<p>you might think we have to put elephants and whales and birds on a big spaceship, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not true because all you need to know is the DNA making, the genetic making of these animals,</p>
<p>put it on a computer system that has AI plus a 3D printer so that this CubeSat, which is rather</p>
<p>small, can go with this information to another planet and use the raw materials there to produce</p>
<p>synthetic life. And that would be a way of producing copies, just like the Gutenberg printing press.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be exact copies of the humans, it could just contain some basic</p>
<p>elements of life and then have enough life on board that it could reproduce the process of</p>
<p>evolution on another place. So I mean, that also makes you sad, of course, because you confront</p>
<p>the mortality of your own little precious consciousness and all your own memories and</p>
<p>knowledge and all that stuff. But who cares? I care about mine, right? And you care about yours.</p>
<p>No, no, I actually don&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;re an astronomer, one thing that you learn from the universe</p>
<p>is to be modest because you&rsquo;re not so significant. I mean, think about it, all these emperors and</p>
<p>kings that conquered a piece of land on Earth and were extremely proud. You see these images</p>
<p>of kings and emperors that usually are alpha males and they stand strong and they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>proud of themselves. But if you think about it, there are 10 to the power 20 planets like the</p>
<p>Earth in the observable volume of the universe. And this view of conquering a piece of land and</p>
<p>even conquering all of Earth is just like an ant hugging a single grain of sand on the landscape</p>
<p>of a huge beach. That&rsquo;s not very impressive. So you can&rsquo;t be arrogant. If you see the big picture,</p>
<p>you have to be humble. Also, we are short lived. Within 100 years, that&rsquo;s it. So what does it teach</p>
<p>you? First to be humble, modest. You never have significant powers relative to the big scheme</p>
<p>of things. And second, you should appreciate every day that you live and learn about the world.</p>
<p>Humble and still grateful. Yes, exactly. Well, let&rsquo;s talk about probably the most interesting</p>
<p>object I&rsquo;ve heard about and also the most fun to pronounce. Oumuamua. Can you tell me the story</p>
<p>of this object and why it may be an important event in human history? And is it possibly a piece</p>
<p>of alien technology? Right. So this is the first object that was spotted close to Earth from</p>
<p>outside the solar system. And it was found on October 19th, 2017. And at that time, it was</p>
<p>receding away from us. And at first, astronomers thought it must be a piece of rock, you know,</p>
<p>just like all the asteroids and comets that we have seen from within the solar system.</p>
<p>And it just came from another star. I should say that the actual discovery of this object</p>
<p>was surprising to me because a decade earlier, I wrote the first paper together with Ed Turner</p>
<p>and Amaya Moro Martin that tried to predict whether the same telescope that was surveying</p>
<p>the sky, PanSTARRS from Hawaii, would find anything from interstellar space, given what</p>
<p>we know about the solar system. So if you assume that other planetary systems have similar</p>
<p>abundance of rocks and you just calculate how many should be ejected into interstellar space,</p>
<p>the conclusion is no, we shouldn&rsquo;t find anything with PanSTARRS. To me, I apologize for probably</p>
<p>revealing my stupidity, but it was surprising to me that so few interstellar objects from outside</p>
<p>this whole system have ever been detected. No, nothing. None has been. You do maybe talk about</p>
<p>it that there has been one or two rocks since then. Well, since then, there was one called</p>
<p>the Borisov. It was discovered by an amateur Russian astronomer, Gennady Borisov. And that one</p>
<p>looked like a comet. And just like a comet from within the solar system. But this is a really</p>
<p>important point. Sorry to interrupt it. You showed that it&rsquo;s unlikely that a rock from another solar</p>
<p>system would arrive to ours. Right. And so the actual detection of this one was surprising by</p>
<p>itself to me. Yes. But then, so at first they thought maybe it&rsquo;s a comet or an asteroid,</p>
<p>but then it didn&rsquo;t look like anything we&rsquo;ve seen before. Borisov did look like a comet. So people</p>
<p>asked me afterwards and said, you know, doesn&rsquo;t it convince you if Borisov looks like a comet,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it convince you that Oumuamua is also natural? And I said, you know, when I went on the</p>
<p>first date with my wife, she looked special to me. And since then I met many women. That didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>change my opinion of my wife. So, you know, that&rsquo;s not an argument. Anyway, so why did the Oumuamua</p>
<p>look weird? Let me explain. So first of all, astronomers monitored the amount of light,</p>
<p>sunlight that it reflects. And it was tumbling, spinning every eight hours. And as it was spinning,</p>
<p>the brightness that we saw from that direction, we couldn&rsquo;t resolve it because it&rsquo;s tiny. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about a hundred meters, a few hundred feet, size of a football field. And we cannot, from Earth,</p>
<p>with existing telescopes, we cannot resolve it. The only way to actually get a photograph of it</p>
<p>is to send a camera close to it. And that was not possible at the time that Oumuamua was discovered</p>
<p>because it was already moving away from us faster than any rocket we can send. It&rsquo;s sort of like a</p>
<p>guest that appeared for dinner. And then by the time we realized that it&rsquo;s weird, the guest is</p>
<p>already out the front door into the dark street. What we would like to find is an object like it</p>
<p>approaching us, because then you can send the camera irrespective of how fast it moves. And</p>
<p>if we were to find it in July 2017, that would have been possible because it was approaching us</p>
<p>at that time. Actually, I was visiting Mount Haleakala in Maui, Hawaii with my family for</p>
<p>vacation at that time in July 2017, but nobody knew at the observatory that the Oumuamua is</p>
<p>very close. That&rsquo;s sad to think about that we had the opportunity at that time to send up a camera.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry. I mean, there will be more. There will be more because I operate by the Copernican</p>
<p>principle, which says we don&rsquo;t live at a special place and we don&rsquo;t live at a special time. And</p>
<p>that means if we surveyed the sky for a few years and we had sensitivity to this region between us</p>
<p>and the sun, and we found this object with PanStars, there should be many more that we</p>
<p>will find in the future with surveys that might be even better. And actually, in three years</p>
<p>timescale, there would be the so called LSST. That&rsquo;s a survey of the Vera Rubin Observatory</p>
<p>that would be much more sensitive and could potentially find an Oumuamua like object</p>
<p>every month. OK, so I&rsquo;m just waiting for that. And the main reason for me to alert everyone</p>
<p>to the unusual properties of Oumuamua is with the hope that next time around, when we see</p>
<p>something as unusual, we would take a photograph or we would get as much evidence as possible</p>
<p>because science is based on evidence, not on prejudice. And we will get back to that theme.</p>
<p>So anyway, let me let me point out some of the properties, actually, the elongated nature,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things. So the light curve, the amount of light, sunlight that was reflected</p>
<p>from it was changing over eight hours by a factor of 10, meaning that the area of this</p>
<p>object, even though we can&rsquo;t resolve it, the area on the sky that reflects sunlight was</p>
<p>bigger by a factor of 10 in some phases as it was tumbling around than in other phases.</p>
<p>So even if you take a piece of paper that is razor thin, you know, there is a very small</p>
<p>likelihood that it&rsquo;s exactly edge on and getting a factor of 10 change in the area that you see</p>
<p>on the sky is huge. It&rsquo;s much more than any. It means that the object has an unusual geometry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at least a factor of a few more than any of the comets or asteroids that we have seen before.</p>
<p>You mentioned reflectivity. So it&rsquo;s not just the geometry, but</p>
<p>the properties of the surface of that thing. Well, if you assume the reflectivity is the same,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s just geometry. If you assume the reflectivity may change, then it could be</p>
<p>a combination of the area that you see and the reflectivity because different directions may</p>
<p>reflect differently. But the point is that it&rsquo;s very extreme. And actually the best fit</p>
<p>to the light curve that we saw was of a flat object. Unlike all the cartoons that you have seen</p>
<p>of a cigar shape, a flat object at the 90% confidence gives a better model for the way</p>
<p>that the light varied. So like flat meaning like a pancake.</p>
<p>Like a pancake. Exactly. And so that&rsquo;s, you know, the very first unusual property. But to me,</p>
<p>it was not unusual enough to think that it might be artificial. It was not significant enough.</p>
<p>Then there was no cometary tail, you know, no dust, no gas around this object. And the</p>
<p>Spitzer Space Telescope really searched very deeply for carbon based molecules. There was nothing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s definitely not a comet the way people expected it to be.</p>
<p>Can you maybe briefly mention what properties a comet that you&rsquo;re referring to usually has?</p>
<p>Right. So a comet is a rock that has some water ice on the surface. So you can think of it as an</p>
<p>icy rock. Actually comets were discovered a long time ago, but the first model that was developed</p>
<p>for them was by Fred Whipple, who was at Harvard. And I think the legend goes that he got the idea</p>
<p>from walking through Harvard Square and seeing during a winter day and seeing these icy rocks,</p>
<p>you know. So a comet is icy and an asteroid is not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a rock. It&rsquo;s just a rock.</p>
<p>Yeah. So when you have ice on the surface, when the rock gets close to the sun,</p>
<p>the sunlight warms it up and the ice sublimates, evaporates. Because the one thing about ice,</p>
<p>water ice, is it doesn&rsquo;t become liquid if you warm it up in vacuum, you know, without</p>
<p>an external pressure. It just goes straight into gas. And that&rsquo;s what you see as the tail of a</p>
<p>comet. The only way to get liquid water is to have an atmosphere like on Earth that has an external</p>
<p>pressure. Only then you get liquid. And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s essential to have an atmosphere to a planet</p>
<p>in order to have liquid water and the chemistry of life. So if you look at Mars, Mars lost its</p>
<p>atmosphere and therefore no liquid water on the surface anymore. I mean, there may have been early</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the Perseverance survey, you know, the Perseverance mission will try to find out</p>
<p>whether it had liquid water, whether there was life perhaps on it at the time, but at some point</p>
<p>it lost its atmosphere and then the liquid water was gone. So the only reason that we can live on</p>
<p>Earth is because of the atmosphere. But a comet is in vacuum pretty much. And then when it gets</p>
<p>warmed up on the surface, the water becomes, the water ice becomes gas and then you see this</p>
<p>cometary tail behind it. In addition to water, there are all kinds of carbon based molecules</p>
<p>or dust that comes off the surface. And those are detectable. Yeah, it&rsquo;s easy to detect. It&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>prominent. You see these cometary tails that look very prominent because they reflect sunlight</p>
<p>and you can see them. In fact, it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to see the nucleus of the comet</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s surrounded and shrouded with, and in this case, there was no trace of anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating. Now you might say, okay, it&rsquo;s not a comet. So that&rsquo;s what the community said.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s not a, no problem. It&rsquo;s still a rock, you know, it&rsquo;s not a comet,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a rock, bare rock. You know, okay, no problem. Then, and that&rsquo;s the thing that</p>
<p>convinced me to write about it. And then in June 2018, you know, significantly later,</p>
<p>there was a report that in fact the object exhibited an excess push in addition to the</p>
<p>force of gravity. So the sun acts on it by gravity, but then there was an extra push</p>
<p>on this object that was figured out from the orbit that you can trace. And the question was,</p>
<p>what is this excess push? So for comets, you get the rocket effect. When you evaporate gas,</p>
<p>you know, just like a jet engine on an airplane, you throw, a jet engine is very simple. You throw</p>
<p>the gas back and it pushes the airplane forward. That&rsquo;s all. That&rsquo;s how the jet. So in a case of</p>
<p>a comet, you throw gas in the direction of the sun because it, and then you get a push.</p>
<p>Okay. So in the case of comets, you can get a push, but there was no cometary tail. So then</p>
<p>people say, oh, wait a second. Is it an asteroid? No, but it behaves like a comet, but it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look like a comet. So what, well, forget about it. Business as usual. So that&rsquo;s what they mean</p>
<p>by a non gravitation acceleration. So that&rsquo;s interesting. So like the primary force acting</p>
<p>on something like just a rock, like an asteroid would be like, you can predict the trajectory</p>
<p>based on the gravity, based on gravity. And so here there&rsquo;s detected movement that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>cannot be accounted purely by the gravity of the sun. And if it was a comet, you would need about</p>
<p>a 10th of the mass of this comet, the weight of this comet to be evaporated in order to give it.</p>
<p>And there was no sign of that. No sign. 10% of the mass evaporating. It&rsquo;s huge. Think about it.</p>
<p>A hundred meter size object losing 10% of its mass. You can&rsquo;t miss that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s super weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super weird.</p>
<p>Is there a good explanation, is there in your mind a possible explanation for this?</p>
<p>So I operated just like Sherlock Holmes in a way. I said, okay, what are the possibilities? And</p>
<p>the only thing I could think, so I ruled out everything else. And I said, it must be the</p>
<p>sunlight reflected off it. Okay. So the sunlight reflects off the surface and gives it a push,</p>
<p>just like you get a push on a sail on a boat, you know, from the wind reflecting off it.</p>
<p>Now, in order for this to be effective, it turns out the object needs to be extremely thin.</p>
<p>It turns out it needs to be less than a millimeter thick. Nature does not produce such things.</p>
<p>But we produce it because it&rsquo;s called the technology of a light sail. So we are,</p>
<p>for space exploration, we are exploring this technology because it has the benefit of</p>
<p>not needing to carry the fuel with the spacecraft. So you don&rsquo;t have the fuel, you just have a</p>
<p>sail and it&rsquo;s being pushed either by sunlight or by a laser beam or whatever. So perhaps this is</p>
<p>the light sail. So this is actually the same technology with the Starshot project. Yes.</p>
<p>So people afterwards say, okay, you work on this project, you imagine. No, that&rsquo;s a pretty good</p>
<p>explanation, right? Obviously, my imagination is limited by what I know. So I would not deny that</p>
<p>working on light sails expanded my ability to imagine this possibility. But let me offer another</p>
<p>interesting anecdote. In September this year, 2020, there was another object found,</p>
<p>and it was given the name 2020SO by the Minor Planet Center. This is an organization actually</p>
<p>in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that gives names to astronomical objects found in the solar system.</p>
<p>And they gave it that name 2020SO because, you know, it looked like an object in the solar system</p>
<p>and it moved in an orbit that is similar to the orbit of the Earth, but not the same exactly.</p>
<p>And therefore it was bound to the Sun, but it also exhibited a deviation from what you expect</p>
<p>based on gravity. So the astronomers that found it extrapolated back in time and found that</p>
<p>in 1966, it intercepted the Earth. And then they went to the history books and they realized,</p>
<p>oh, there was a mission called Lunar Lander Surveyor 2 that had a rocket booster. It was</p>
<p>a failed mission, but there was a rocket booster that was kicked into space. And presumably this</p>
<p>is the rocket booster that we&rsquo;re seeing. Now, this rocket booster was sufficiently hollow and thin</p>
<p>for us to recognize that it&rsquo;s pushed by sunlight. So here is my point. We can tell from the orbit</p>
<p>of an object, obviously this object didn&rsquo;t have any cometary tail. It was artificially made. We</p>
<p>know that it was made by us and it did deviate from an orbit of a rock. So just by seeing</p>
<p>something that doesn&rsquo;t have cometary tail and deviates from an orbit shaped by gravity,</p>
<p>we can tell that it&rsquo;s artificial. In the case of Oumuamua, it couldn&rsquo;t have been sent by humans</p>
<p>because it just passed near us for a few months. We know exactly what we were doing at that time.</p>
<p>And also it was moving faster than any object that we can launch. And so obviously it came from</p>
<p>outside the solar system. And the question is who produced it? Now, I should say that when I walk</p>
<p>on vacation on the beach, I often see natural objects like seashells that are beautiful and I</p>
<p>look at them. And every now and then I stumble on a plastic bottle that was artificially produced.</p>
<p>And my point is that maybe Oumuamua was a message in a bottle. And this is simply another window</p>
<p>into searching for artifacts from other civilizations. Where do you think it could have</p>
<p>come from? And if it&rsquo;s so, okay, from a scientific perspective, the narrow minded view, as we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>probably talk about throughout, is, you know, you kind of want to stick to the things that,</p>
<p>to naturally originating objects like asteroids and comets. Okay, that&rsquo;s the space of possible</p>
<p>hypotheses. And then if we expand beyond that, you start to think, okay, these are artificially</p>
<p>constructed. Like you just said, it could be by humans. It could be by whatever that means,</p>
<p>by some kind of extraterrestrial alien civilizations. If it&rsquo;s the alien civilization</p>
<p>variety, what is this object then? That&rsquo;s an excellent question. And let me lay out,</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t have enough evidence to tell. If we had a photograph, perhaps we would have</p>
<p>more information. But there is one other peculiar fact about Oumuamua. Well, other than it was very</p>
<p>shiny, that I didn&rsquo;t mention, you know, we didn&rsquo;t detect any heat from it. And that implies that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s rather small and shiny. But the other peculiar fact is that it came from a very special frame of</p>
<p>reference. So it&rsquo;s sort of like finding a car in a parking lot, in a public parking lot, that,</p>
<p>you know, you can&rsquo;t really tell where it came from. So there is this frame of reference where</p>
<p>you average over the motions of all the stars in the neighborhood of the Sun. So you find the</p>
<p>so called local standard of rest of the galaxy. And that&rsquo;s a frame of reference that is obtained</p>
<p>by averaging the random motions of all the stars. And the Sun is moving relative to that frame at</p>
<p>some speed. But this object was at rest in that frame. And only one in 500 stars is so much at</p>
<p>rest in that frame. And that&rsquo;s why I was saying it&rsquo;s like a parking lot. It was parked there,</p>
<p>and we bumped into it. So the relative speed between the solar system and this object is just</p>
<p>because we are moving. It was sitting still. Now you ask yourself, why is it so unusual in that</p>
<p>context? You know why? Because if it was expelled from another planetary system, most likely it will</p>
<p>carry the speed of the host star that it came from. Because it was, you know, the most loosely</p>
<p>bound objects are in the periphery of the planetary system, and they move very slowly relative to the</p>
<p>star. And so they carry the, when they are ripped apart from the planetary system, most of the</p>
<p>objects will have the residual motion of the star roughly relative to the local star. But this one</p>
<p>was at rest in the local star. Now, one thing I can think of, if there is a grid of road posts,</p>
<p>you know, like for navigation system, so that you can find your way in the local frame, then that</p>
<p>would be one possibility. These are like little sensors of, that&rsquo;s fascinating to think about. So</p>
<p>there could be, I mean, not necessarily literally a grid, but just evenly, in some definition of</p>
<p>evenly spread out set of objects like these that are just out there. A lot of them. Another</p>
<p>possibility is that these are relay stations, you know, for communication. You might think,</p>
<p>in order to communicate, you need a huge beacon, a very powerful beacon. But it&rsquo;s not true. Because</p>
<p>even on Earth, you know, we have these relay stations. So you have a not so powerful beacon.</p>
<p>So it can be heard only out to a limited distance, but then you relay the message.</p>
<p>And it could be one of those. Now, after it collided with the solar system, of course,</p>
<p>it got a kick. So it&rsquo;s just like a billiard ball, you know, we gave it a kick by colliding with,</p>
<p>but most of them are not colliding with stars. And so that&rsquo;s one possibility. Okay. And there</p>
<p>should be numerous, lots of them, if that&rsquo;s the case. The other possibility is that it&rsquo;s a probe,</p>
<p>you know, that was sent in the direction of the habitable region around the Sun to find out if</p>
<p>there is life. Now, it takes tens of thousands of years for such a probe to traverse the solar</p>
<p>system from the outer edge of the Oort cloud, all the way to where we are. And, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a long journey. So when it started the journey from the edge of the solar system to</p>
<p>get to us now, you know, we were rather primitive back then, you know, we still didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>technology, there was no reason to visit, you know, there was grass around and so forth. But,</p>
<p>you know, maybe it is a probe. So you said 10,000 years, that&rsquo;s faster. So it takes that long.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands, yes. Tens of thousands of years. Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing I should</p>
<p>say is, you know, it could be just an outer layer of something else, like, you know, something that</p>
<p>was ripped apart, like a surface of an instrument. And you can have lots of these pieces, you know,</p>
<p>if something breaks, lots of these pieces spread out, like space junk. And, you know, that&hellip;</p>
<p>It could be just space junk from an alien civilization.</p>
<p>Yes. So it&rsquo;s kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>I should tell you about space junk. Let me&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes. What do you mean by space junk?</p>
<p>So, I think, you know, you might ask, why aren&rsquo;t they looking for us? One possibility</p>
<p>is that we are not interesting, like we were talking about ants. Another possibility,</p>
<p>you know, if there are millions or billions of years into their technological development,</p>
<p>they created their own habitat, their own cocoon, where they feel comfortable, they have everything</p>
<p>they need. And it&rsquo;s risky for them to establish communication with other&hellip; So they have their</p>
<p>own cocoon and they close off. They don&rsquo;t care about anything else. Now, in that case, you might</p>
<p>say, oh, so how can we find about them if they are closed off? The answer is they still have to</p>
<p>deposit trash, right? That is something from the law of thermodynamics. There must be some production</p>
<p>of trash. And, you know, we can still find about them just like investigative journalists going</p>
<p>through the trash cans of celebrities in Hollywood, you know. You can learn about the private lives</p>
<p>of those celebrities by looking at the trash.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think, you know, if we are the ants in this picture,</p>
<p>if this thing is a water bottle, or if it&rsquo;s like a smartphone, like where on the spectrum of</p>
<p>possible objects of space, because there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting trash. How interesting is this trash?</p>
<p>But imagine a caveman seeing a cell phone. The caveman would think, since the caveman played</p>
<p>with rocks all of his life, he would say, it&rsquo;s a rock, just like my fellow astronomers said.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. That&rsquo;s brilliantly put. Actually, as a scientist, do you hope it&rsquo;s a water bottle</p>
<p>or a smartphone?</p>
<p>Because I hope it&rsquo;s even more than a smartphone. I hope that it&rsquo;s something that is really</p>
<p>sophisticated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny. See, I&rsquo;m the opposite. I feel like I hope it&rsquo;s a water bottle because</p>
<p>at least we have a hope with our current set of skills to understand it. A caveman has no way of</p>
<p>understanding the smartphone. It&rsquo;s like, it will be like, I feel like a caveman has more to learn</p>
<p>from the plastic water bottle than they do from the smartphone.</p>
<p>But suppose we figure it out. If we, for example, come close to it and learn what it&rsquo;s made of.</p>
<p>And I guess a smartphone is full of like thousands of different technologies that we could</p>
<p>probably pick at. Do you have a sense of where a hypothesis of where is the cocoon that it</p>
<p>might have come from?</p>
<p>No, because, okay, so first of all, you know, the solar system, the outermost edge of the</p>
<p>solar system is called the Oort cloud. It&rsquo;s a cloud of icy rocks of different sizes that were</p>
<p>left over from the formation of the solar system. And it&rsquo;s thought to be roughly a ball or a</p>
<p>sphere. And it&rsquo;s halfway, the extent of it is roughly halfway to the nearest star. Okay, so you</p>
<p>can imagine each planetary system basically touching the Oort clouds of those stars that are</p>
<p>near us are touching each other. Space is full of these billiard balls that are very densely</p>
<p>packed. And what that means is any object that you see, irrespective of whether it came from</p>
<p>the local standard. So we said that this object is special because it came from a local standard</p>
<p>of rest. But even if it didn&rsquo;t, you would never be able to trace where it came from because all</p>
<p>these Oort clouds overlap. So if you take some direction in the sky, you will cross as many</p>
<p>stars as you have in that direction. Like, there is no way to tell which Oort cloud it came from.</p>
<p>So yes, I didn&rsquo;t realize how densely packed everything was from the perspective of the Oort</p>
<p>cloud. And that&rsquo;s really interesting. So yeah, it could be nearby, it could be very far away.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have no clue.</p>
<p>You said cocoon. And you kind of paint, I think in the book, I&rsquo;ve read a lot of your articles too</p>
<p>on the Scientific American, which are brilliant. So I&rsquo;m kind of mixing things up in my head a</p>
<p>little bit. But what does that cocoon look like? What does a civilization that&rsquo;s able to harness</p>
<p>the power of multiple suns, for example, look like? When you imagine possible civilizations that are</p>
<p>a million years more advanced than us, what do you think that actually looks like?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very different than we can imagine. By the way, I should start from the point that</p>
<p>even biological life, just without technology getting into the game, could look like something</p>
<p>we have never seen before. Take, for example, the nearest star, which is Proxima Centauri.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s four and a quarter light years away. So they will know about the results of the 2016 elections</p>
<p>only next month, in February 2021. It&rsquo;s very far away. But if you think about it, this star is a</p>
<p>dwarf star, and it&rsquo;s twice as cold as the sun. And it emits mostly infrared radiation. So if there</p>
<p>are any creatures on the planet close to it that is habitable, which is called Proxima B, there is</p>
<p>a planet in the habitable zone, in the zone just at the right distance where, in principle, liquid</p>
<p>water can be on the surface. If there are any animals there, they have infrared eyes because</p>
<p>our eyes were designed to be sensitive to where most of the sunlight is in the visible range.</p>
<p>But Proxima Centauri emits mostly infrared. So in the nearest star system, these animals would be</p>
<p>quite strange. They would have eyes that are detectors of infrared, very different from ours.</p>
<p>Moreover, this planet, Proxima B, faces the star always with the same side. So it has a permanent</p>
<p>day side and a permanent night side. And obviously the creatures that would evolve on the permanent</p>
<p>day side, which is much warmer, would be quite different than those on the permanent night side.</p>
<p>Between them, there would be a permanent sunset strip. And my daughters said that that&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>opportunity for high value real estate because you will see the sunset throughout your life,</p>
<p>right? The sun never sets on this trip. So these worlds are out of our imagination.</p>
<p>Just even the individual creatures, the sensor suite that they&rsquo;re operating with</p>
<p>might be very different. Very different. So I think when we see something like that,</p>
<p>we would be shocked not to speak about seeing technology. So I don&rsquo;t even dare to imagine.</p>
<p>And I think obviously we can bury our head in the sand and say, it&rsquo;s never aliens,</p>
<p>like many of my colleagues say. And it&rsquo;s a self fulfilling prophecy. If you never look,</p>
<p>you will never find. If you&rsquo;re not ready to find wonderful things, you will never discover them.</p>
<p>And the other thing I would like to say is reality doesn&rsquo;t care whether you ignore it or not.</p>
<p>You can ignore reality, but it&rsquo;s still there. So we can all agree, based on Twitter,</p>
<p>that aliens don&rsquo;t exist. That Umuamua was a rock. We can all agree. And you will get a lot of likes,</p>
<p>we will have a big crowd of supporters, and everyone will be happy and give each other</p>
<p>awards and honors and so forth. But Umuamua might still be an alien artifact. Who cares</p>
<p>what humans agree on? There is a reality out there. And we have to be modest enough to recognize</p>
<p>that we should make our statements based on evidence. Science is not about ourselves. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not about glorifying our image. It&rsquo;s not about getting honors, prizes. A lot of the academic</p>
<p>activity is geared towards creating your echo chamber where you have students, postdocs,</p>
<p>repeating your mantras so that your voice is heard loudly so that you can get more honors,</p>
<p>prizes, recognition. That&rsquo;s not the purpose of science. The purpose is to figure out what nature</p>
<p>is. And in the process of doing that, it&rsquo;s a learning experience. You make mistakes. Einstein</p>
<p>made three mistakes at the end of his career. He argued that in the 1930s, he argued that black</p>
<p>holes don&rsquo;t exist, gravitational waves don&rsquo;t exist, and quantum mechanics doesn&rsquo;t have spooky action</p>
<p>at a distance. And all three turned out to be wrong. So the point is that if you work at the</p>
<p>frontier, then you make mistakes. It&rsquo;s inevitable because you can&rsquo;t tell what is true or not.</p>
<p>And avoiding making mistakes in order to preserve your image makes you extremely boring. You will</p>
<p>get a prize, but you will be a boring scientist because you will keep repeating things we already</p>
<p>know. If you want to make progress, if you want to innovate, you have to take risks and you have</p>
<p>to look at the evidence. It&rsquo;s a dialogue with nature. You don&rsquo;t know the truth in advance. You</p>
<p>let nature tell you, educate you, and then you realize that what you thought before is incorrect.</p>
<p>And a lot of my colleagues prefer to be in a state where they have a monologue. You know,</p>
<p>if you look at these people that work on string theory, they have a monologue. They know what,</p>
<p>and in fact, their monologue is centered on anti de Sitter space, which we don&rsquo;t live in now.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s just like the Olympics. You define a hundred meters and you say,</p>
<p>whoever runs these hundred meters is the best athlete, the fastest. And it&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>arbitrary. You could have decided it would be 50 meters or 20 meters. Who cares? You just measure</p>
<p>the ability of people this way. So you define anti de Sitter space as a space where you do your</p>
<p>mathematical gymnastics, and then you find who can do it the best. And you give jobs based on that.</p>
<p>You give prizes. But as we said before, you know, nature doesn&rsquo;t care about, you know,</p>
<p>the prizes that you give to each other. It cares, you know, it has its own reality and we should</p>
<p>figure it out. And it&rsquo;s not about us. The scientific activity is about figuring out nature. And</p>
<p>sometimes we may be wrong. Our image will not be preserved. But that&rsquo;s the fun, you know. Kids</p>
<p>explore the world out of curiosity. And I always want to maintain my childhood curiosity. And I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care about the labels that I have. In fact, having tenure is exactly the opportunity to behave</p>
<p>like a child because you can make mistakes. And I was asked by the Harvard Gazette, you know,</p>
<p>the Pravda of Harvard, what is the one thing that you would like to change about the world?</p>
<p>And I said, I would like my colleagues to behave more like kids. That&rsquo;s the one thing I would like</p>
<p>them to do. Because something bad happens to these kids when they become tenured professors.</p>
<p>They start to worry about their ego and about themselves more than about the purpose of science,</p>
<p>which is, you know, curiosity driven, figuring out from evidence. Evidence is the key. So when</p>
<p>an object shows anomalies like Oumuamua, what&rsquo;s the problem discussing, you know, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>artificial or not? You know, so there was, I should tell you, there was a mainstream</p>
<p>paper in Nature published saying it must be natural. That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s unusual, but it must</p>
<p>be natural, period. And then at the same time, some other mainstream scientists tried to explain</p>
<p>the properties. And they came up with interpretations like it&rsquo;s a dust bunny,</p>
<p>you know, the kind that you find in a household, a collection of dust particles pushed by sunlight,</p>
<p>something we have never seen before. Or it&rsquo;s a hydrogen iceberg. It actually evaporates like</p>
<p>a comet, but hydrogen is transparent. You don&rsquo;t see it. And that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t see the cometary</p>
<p>tail. Again, we have never seen something like that. In both cases, the objects would not</p>
<p>survive the long journey. We discussed it in a paper that I wrote afterwards. But my point is,</p>
<p>those that tried to explain the unusual properties went into great length at discussing things that</p>
<p>we have never seen before. Okay? So even when you think about a natural origin, you have to come up</p>
<p>with scenarios of things that were never seen before. And by the way, they look less plausible</p>
<p>to me personally. But my point is, if we discuss things that were never seen before,</p>
<p>why not discuss, why not contemplate an artificial origin? What&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>Why do people have this pushback? You know, I worked on dark matter, and we don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>most of the matter in the universe is. It&rsquo;s called dark matter. It&rsquo;s just an acronym because we have</p>
<p>no clue. We simply don&rsquo;t know. So it could be all kinds of particles. And over the years, people</p>
<p>suggested weakly interacting massive particles, axions, all kinds of particles. And experiments</p>
<p>were made. They cost hundreds of millions of dollars. They put upper limits, constraints</p>
<p>that ruled out many of the possibilities that were proposed as natural initially. The mainstream</p>
<p>community regarded it as a mainstream activity to search the nature of the dark matter.</p>
<p>And nobody complained that it&rsquo;s speculative to consider weakly interacting massive particles.</p>
<p>Now, I ask you, why is it speculative to consider extraterrestrial technologies? We have a proof</p>
<p>that it exists here on Earth. We also know that the conditions of Earth are reproduced</p>
<p>in billions of systems throughout the Milky Way galaxy. So what&rsquo;s more conservative than to say,</p>
<p>if you arrange for similar conditions, you get the same outcome. How can you imagine this to be</p>
<p>speculative? It&rsquo;s not speculative at all. And nevertheless, it&rsquo;s regarded the periphery. And</p>
<p>at the same time, you have physicists, theoretical physicists, working on extra dimensions, super</p>
<p>symmetry, super string theory, the multiverse. Maybe we live in a simulation. All of these ideas</p>
<p>that have no grounding in reality, some of which sound to me like, you know, just like what someone</p>
<p>would say. Science fiction, basically. Because you have no way to test it, you know, through</p>
<p>experiments. And experiments really are key. It&rsquo;s not just the nuance. You say, okay, forget about</p>
<p>experiments. As some philosophers try to say, you know, if there is a consensus, what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>The point is, it&rsquo;s key. Then that&rsquo;s what Galileo found. It&rsquo;s key to have feedback from reality.</p>
<p>You know, you can think that you have a billion dollars or that you are more rich than, you know,</p>
<p>Elon Musk. That&rsquo;s fine. You can feel very happy about it. You can talk about it with your friends</p>
<p>and all of you will be happy and think about what you can do with the money. Then you go to</p>
<p>an ATM machine and you make an experiment. You check how much money you have in your checking</p>
<p>account. And if it turns out that, you know, you don&rsquo;t have much, you can&rsquo;t materialize your dreams.</p>
<p>Okay. So you realize, you have a reality check. And my point is, without experiments giving you</p>
<p>a reality check, without the ATM machine showing you whether your ideas are bankrupt or not,</p>
<p>without putting skin in the game. And by skin in the game, I mean, don&rsquo;t just talk about</p>
<p>theoretical ideas. Make them testable. If you don&rsquo;t make them testable, they&rsquo;re worthless.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like theology that is not testable. By the way, theology has some tests. Let me give you</p>
<p>three examples. It turns out that my book already inspired a PhD student at Harvard in the English</p>
<p>department to pursue a PhD in that direction. And she invited me to the PhD exam a couple of months</p>
<p>ago. And in the exam, one of the examiners, a professor, asked her, do you know why Giordano</p>
<p>Bruno was burnt at the stake? And she said, no, I think it&rsquo;s because he was an obnoxious</p>
<p>guy and irritated a lot of people, which is true. But the professor said, no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because Giordano Bruno said that other stars are just like the sun,</p>
<p>and they could have a planet like the Earth around them that could host life. And that</p>
<p>was offensive to the church. Why was it offensive? Because there is the possibility that this life</p>
<p>sinned. And if that life sinned on planets around other stars, it should have been saved by Christ.</p>
<p>And then you need multiple copies of Christ. And that&rsquo;s unacceptable. How can you have duplicates</p>
<p>of Christ? And so they burned the guy. I&rsquo;m just like loading this all in because that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>brilliant. So he was actually already, it&rsquo;s not just about the stars, it&rsquo;s anticipating that there</p>
<p>could be other life forms. Like why, if this star, if there&rsquo;s other stars, why would it be special?</p>
<p>Why would our star be special? He was making the right argument. And he would just follow that</p>
<p>all along to say like, there should be other Earth like places, there should be other life forms.</p>
<p>And then there needs to be copies of Christ. Yeah, so that was offensive. So I said to that</p>
<p>professor, I said, great, I wanted to introduce some scientific tone to the discussion. And I said,</p>
<p>this is great because now you basically laid the foundation for an experimental test of this</p>
<p>theology. What is the test? We now know that other stars are like the sun and we know they have</p>
<p>planets like the Earth around them. So suppose we find life there and we figure out that they sinned,</p>
<p>then we ask them, did you witness Christ? And if they say no, it means that this theology</p>
<p>is ruled out. So there is an experimental test. So this is experimental test number one.</p>
<p>Another experimental test, in the Bible, in the Old Testament, Abraham</p>
<p>was heard the voice, the voice of God to sacrifice his son, right? Only son. And that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>story says. Now, suppose Abraham, my name, by the way, had a voice memo up on his cell phone. He</p>
<p>could have pressed this up and recorded the voice of God. And that would have been experimental</p>
<p>evidence that God exists, right? Fortunately, he didn&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s an experimental test, right?</p>
<p>There is a third example I should tell, and that is Elie Wiesel attributed this story to Martin</p>
<p>Buber, but it&rsquo;s not clear whether it&rsquo;s true or not. At any event, the story goes that Martin</p>
<p>Buber, you know, he was a philosopher and he said, you know, the Christians, you know,</p>
<p>the Messiah arrived already and will come back again in the future. The Jews argue the Messiah</p>
<p>never came and will arrive in the future. So he said, why argue? Both sides agree that the Messiah</p>
<p>will arrive in the future. When the Messiah arrives, we can ask whether he or she will arrive</p>
<p>in the future. When the Messiah arrives, we can ask whether he or she came before, you know, like</p>
<p>visited us and then figure it out. And one side. So again, experimental test of a theology. So even</p>
<p>theology, if it puts a skin in the game, you know, if it makes a prediction, could be tested, right?</p>
<p>So why can&rsquo;t string theories test themselves? Or why can&rsquo;t, you know, even cosmic inflation? That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a model that, you know, one of the inventors from MIT, Alan Guth, argues that it&rsquo;s not falsifiable.</p>
<p>My point is a theory that cannot be falsified is not helpful because it means that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make progress. You cannot improve your understanding of nature. The only way for us to</p>
<p>learn about nature is by making hypotheses that are testable, doing the experiments and learning</p>
<p>whether we are correct or not. So B, and coupled that with a curiosity and open mindedness that</p>
<p>allows us to explore all kinds of possible hypotheses, but always the pursuit of those,</p>
<p>the scientific rigor around those hypotheses is ultimately get evidence. Knowledge of what nature</p>
<p>is should be a dialogue with nature. Yes. Rather than a monologue. Monologue, beautifully put.</p>
<p>Can we talk a little bit about the Drake equation? Another framework from which to have this kind of</p>
<p>discussion about possible civilizations out there. So let me ask, within the context of the Drake</p>
<p>equation or maybe bigger, how many alien civilizations do you think are out there?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s hard to tell because the Drake equation is again quantifying our ignorance. It&rsquo;s just a set</p>
<p>of factors. The only one that we know, or actually two that we know quite well is the rate of star</p>
<p>formation in the Milky Way galaxy, which we measured by now, and the frequency of planets</p>
<p>like the Earth around stars and at the right distance to have life. But other than that,</p>
<p>there are lots of implicit assumptions about all the other factors that will enable us to detect</p>
<p>the signal. Now, I should say the Drake equation has a very limited validity just for signals from</p>
<p>civilizations that are transmitting at the time that you&rsquo;re observing them. However, we can do</p>
<p>much better than that. We can look for artifacts that they left behind. Even if they are dead,</p>
<p>you can look for industrial pollution in the atmosphere of planets. Why do I bring this up?</p>
<p>Why do I bring this up? Again, to show you the conservatism of the mainstream in astronomy.</p>
<p>And by the way, I have leadership positions. I was chair of the astronomy department for nine</p>
<p>years, the longest serving chair at Harvard. And I&rsquo;m the chair of the board on physics and astronomy</p>
<p>of the National Academies. It&rsquo;s a primary board. And I&rsquo;m director of two centers at Harvard and so</p>
<p>forth. So I do represent the community in various ways. But at the same time, I&rsquo;m a little bit</p>
<p>disappointed by the conservatism that people have. And so let me give you an illustration of that.</p>
<p>So the astronomy community actually is going right now through the process of defining its goals for</p>
<p>the next decade. And there are proposals for telescopes that would cost billions of dollars</p>
<p>and whose goal is to find evidence for oxygen in the atmosphere of planets around other stars,</p>
<p>with the idea that this would be a marker, a signature of life. Now, the problem with that</p>
<p>is Earth didn&rsquo;t have much oxygen in its atmosphere for the first two billion years. Roughly half of</p>
<p>its life, it didn&rsquo;t have much oxygen. But it had life. It had microbial life. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear yet as of yet what the origin is for the rise in the oxygen level after two</p>
<p>billion years, about 2.4 billion years ago. But we know that a planet can have life without oxygen</p>
<p>in the atmosphere because Earth did it. The second problem with this approach is that you can have</p>
<p>oxygen from natural processes. You can break water molecules and make oxygen. So even if you find it,</p>
<p>it will never tell you that for sure life exists there. And so even with these billions of dollars,</p>
<p>the mainstream community will never be confident whether there is life. Now, how can it be</p>
<p>confident? There is actually a way. If instead of looking with the same instruments, if you look for</p>
<p>molecules that indicate industrial pollution, for example, CFCs that are produced by refrigerating</p>
<p>systems or industries here on Earth, that they do the ozone layer, you can search for that. And</p>
<p>I wrote a paper five years ago suggesting that. Now, what&rsquo;s the problem? You can just tell NASA,</p>
<p>I want to build this telescope to search for oxygen, but also for industrial pollution.</p>
<p>Nobody would say that because it sounds like on the periphery of the field. And I ask you,</p>
<p>why would? Hilarious. Because that&rsquo;s exactly, I mean, that would be saying is quite brilliant. I</p>
<p>mean, because it&rsquo;s a really strong signal. And if life, if there&rsquo;s alien civilizations out there,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re probably going to be many of them. And they&rsquo;re probably going to be more advanced</p>
<p>than us. And they&rsquo;re probably going to have something like industrial pollution, which would</p>
<p>be a much stronger signal than some basic gas, which could have a lot of different explanations.</p>
<p>So like something like oxygen or, I mean, we could talk about signs of life on Venus and so on.</p>
<p>But if you want a strong signal, it would be pollution. I love how garbage is.</p>
<p>No, but the pollution, you have to understand, we think of pollution as a problem,</p>
<p>but on a planet that was too cold, for example, to have a comfortable life on it, you can imagine</p>
<p>terraforming it and putting a blanket of polluting gases such that it will be warmer. And that would</p>
<p>be a positive change. So if an industrial or a technological civilization wants to terraform a</p>
<p>planet that otherwise is too cold for them, they will do it. So what&rsquo;s the problem of defining it</p>
<p>as a search goal using the same technologies? The problem is that there is a taboo. We&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>supposed to discuss extraterrestrial intelligence. There is no funding for this subject, not much,</p>
<p>very little. And young people, because of the bullying on Twitter, you know, all the social</p>
<p>media and elsewhere, young people with talent that are curious about these questions do not enter</p>
<p>this field of study. And obviously, if you step on the grass, it will never grow, right? So if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give funding, obviously, you know, the mainstream community says, look, nothing was</p>
<p>discovered so far. Obviously, nothing would be discovered. If talented people go to other</p>
<p>districts, you never search for it well enough, you will never find anything. I mean, look at</p>
<p>gravitational wave astrophysics. It&rsquo;s a completely new window into the universe, pioneered by Ray</p>
<p>Weiss at MIT. And at first, it was ridiculed. And thanks to some administrators at the National</p>
<p>Science Foundation, it received funding, despite the fact that the mainstream of the astronomy</p>
<p>community was very resistant to it. And now it&rsquo;s considered a frontier. So all these people that</p>
<p>I remember as a young postdoc, these people that bashed this field and said bad things about</p>
<p>people, you know, said nothing will come out of it. Now they say, oh, yeah, of course, you know,</p>
<p>the Nobel Prize was given to the LIGO collaboration. Of course, now they are supportive</p>
<p>of it. But my point is, if you suppress innovation early on, there are lots of missed opportunities.</p>
<p>The discovery of exoplanets is one example. You know, in 1952, there was an astronomer called</p>
<p>the name Otto Struve. And he wrote a paper saying, why don&rsquo;t we search for Jupiter like planets</p>
<p>close to their host star? Because if they&rsquo;re close enough, they would move the star back and forth,</p>
<p>and we can detect the signal. And so astronomers on time allocation committees of telescopes</p>
<p>for 40 years argued, this is not possible because we know why Jupiter resides so far from the Sun.</p>
<p>You cannot have Jupiter so close because there is this region where ice forms far from the Sun.</p>
<p>And beyond that region is where Jupiter like planets can form. There was a theory behind</p>
<p>it which ended up being wrong by today&rsquo;s standards. But anyway, they did not give time</p>
<p>on telescopes to search for such systems until the first system was discovered</p>
<p>four decades after Otto Struve&rsquo;s paper. And the Nobel Prize was awarded to that</p>
<p>just a couple of years ago. And then you ask yourself, okay, so science still made progress.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem? The problem is that this baby came out barely, and there was a delay of</p>
<p>four decades. So the progress was delayed. And I wonder how many babies were not born because of</p>
<p>this resistance. So there must be ideas that are as good as this one that were suppressed because</p>
<p>they were bullied, because people ridiculed them, that were actually good ideas. And these are missed</p>
<p>opportunities, babies that were never born. And I&rsquo;m willing to push this frontier of the search</p>
<p>for technologies or technological signatures of other civilizations. Because when I was young,</p>
<p>I was in the military in Israel. It&rsquo;s obligatory to serve. And there was this saying that one of</p>
<p>the soldiers sometimes has to put his body on the barbed wire so that others can go through.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m willing to suffer the pain so that younger people in the future will be able to speak freely</p>
<p>about the possibility that some of the anomalies we find in the sky are due to technological</p>
<p>signatures. And it&rsquo;s quite obvious. This is why I like the folks in artificial intelligence space,</p>
<p>Elon Musk and a few others speak about this. And they look at the long arc. They say like,</p>
<p>what, you know, this kind of, you know, you can call it like first principles thinking,</p>
<p>or you can call it anything really is like, if we just zoom out from our current bickering and our</p>
<p>current, like discussions in the what science is doing, look at the long arc of the trajectory</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re headed at. Which questions are obviously fundamental to science? And it should be asked,</p>
<p>and which is the space of hypothesis we should be exploring? And like exoplanets is a really</p>
<p>good example of one that was like an obvious one. I recently talked to Sarah Seager, and it was very</p>
<p>taboo when she was starting out to work on an exoplanet. And that was even in the 90s. And like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious should not be a taboo subject. And to me, I mean, I&rsquo;m probably ignorant, but to me,</p>
<p>exoplanets seems like it&rsquo;s ridiculous that that would ever be a taboo subject to not fund,</p>
<p>to not explore. That&rsquo;s very, but even for her, it&rsquo;s now taboo to say, like what, you know, to look for</p>
<p>industrial pollution, right? Right. And I find that ridiculous. I&rsquo;ll tell you why. She can&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>the next step. It&rsquo;s ridiculous for another reason. Not because of just the scientific benefits that</p>
<p>we might have by exploring it, but because the public cares about these questions. And the public</p>
<p>funds science. So how dare the scientists shy away from addressing these questions,</p>
<p>if they have the technology to do it. It&rsquo;s like saying, I don&rsquo;t want to look through</p>
<p>Galileo&rsquo;s telescope. It&rsquo;s exactly the same. You have the technology to explore this question,</p>
<p>to find the evidence and you shy away from it. You might ask, why do people shy away from it?</p>
<p>And perhaps it&rsquo;s because of the fact that there is science fiction. I&rsquo;m not a fan of science fiction,</p>
<p>because it has an element to it that violates the laws of physics in many of the books and the</p>
<p>films. And I cannot enjoy these things when I see the laws of physics violated. But who cares that</p>
<p>the, you know, the fact that there is science fiction. I mean, if you have the scientific</p>
<p>methodology to address the same subject, I don&rsquo;t care that other people, you know, spoke nonsense</p>
<p>about this subject or said things that make no sense. Who cares? You do your scientific work,</p>
<p>just like you explore the dark matter. You explore the possibility that umuamua is an</p>
<p>artifact. You just look for evidence and try to deduce what it means. And I have no problem with</p>
<p>doing that. To me, it sounds like any other scientific question that we have. And given</p>
<p>the public&rsquo;s interest, we have an obligation to do that. By the way, science to me is not</p>
<p>an occupation of the elite. It doesn&rsquo;t allow me to feel superior to other humans that are unable to</p>
<p>understand the math. To me, it&rsquo;s a way of life. You know, if there is a problem in the faucet or</p>
<p>in the pipe at home, I try to figure out what the problem is. And with a plumber, we figure it out</p>
<p>and we look at the clues. And the same thing in science. You look at the evidence, you try to</p>
<p>figure out what it means. It&rsquo;s common sense in a way. And it shouldn&rsquo;t be regarded as something</p>
<p>removed from the public. It should be a reflection of the public&rsquo;s interest. And I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually a crime to resist the public. If the public says, I care about this, and you say,</p>
<p>no, no, no, that&rsquo;s not sophisticated enough for me. I want to do intellectual gymnastics on</p>
<p>anti the sitter space. To me, that&rsquo;s a crime. Yes, I 100% agree. So it&rsquo;s hilarious that the very,</p>
<p>not hilarious, it&rsquo;s sad, that people who are trained in the scientific community to have the</p>
<p>tools to explore this world, to be children, to be the most effective at being children,</p>
<p>are the ones that resist being children the most. But there is a large number of people</p>
<p>that embrace the childlike wonder about the world and may not necessarily have the tools to do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the more general public. And so, I wonder if I could ask you and talk to you a little bit</p>
<p>about UFO sightings. That there&rsquo;s people, quote unquote believers, there&rsquo;s hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of UFO sightings. And I&rsquo;ve consumed some of the things that people have said about it. And one</p>
<p>thing I really like about it is how excited they are by the possibility. It&rsquo;s almost like this</p>
<p>childlike wonder about the world out there. It&rsquo;s not a fear, it&rsquo;s an excitement. Do you think,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about this possibly extraterrestrial object that visited, that flew</p>
<p>by Earth, do you think it&rsquo;s possible that out of those hundreds of thousands of UFO sightings,</p>
<p>one is an actual, one or some number is an actual sighting of a nonhuman, some alien technology.</p>
<p>And that we&rsquo;re not, we did not, we&rsquo;re too close minded to look and to see.</p>
<p>I think to answer this question, we need better evidence. My starting point, as I said,</p>
<p>out of modesty is that we are not particularly interesting. And therefore I would be hard pressed</p>
<p>to imagine that someone wants to really spy on us. So I would think, as a starting point,</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t deserve attention and we shouldn&rsquo;t expect someone, but who knows.</p>
<p>Now, the problem that I have with UFO sighting reports is that 50 years ago, there were some</p>
<p>reports of fuzzy images, saucer like things. By now, our technologies are much better. Our cameras</p>
<p>are much more sensitive. These fuzzy images should have turned into crisp, clear images</p>
<p>of things that we are confident about. And they haven&rsquo;t turned that way. It&rsquo;s always on the border</p>
<p>line of believability. And because of that, I believe that it might be most likely artifacts</p>
<p>of our instruments or some natural phenomena that we are unable to understand. Now, of course,</p>
<p>the reason you must examine those, if, for example, pilots report about them or</p>
<p>the military finds evidence for them, is because it may pose a national security threat. If another</p>
<p>country has technologies that we don&rsquo;t know about and they&rsquo;re spying on us, we need to know about</p>
<p>it. And therefore we should examine everything that looks unusual. But to associate it with an</p>
<p>alien life is a little too far for me until we have evidence that stands up to the level of</p>
<p>scientific credence, that we are 100% sure that from multiple detectors and through a scientific</p>
<p>process. Now, again, if the scientific community shies away from these reports, we will never have</p>
<p>that. It&rsquo;s like saying, I don&rsquo;t want to take photographs of something because I know what it is,</p>
<p>then you will never know what it is. But I think if some scientist, if grants, let&rsquo;s put it this</p>
<p>way, if funding will be given to scientists to follow on some of these reports and use scientific</p>
<p>instruments that are capable of detecting those sightings with much better resolution, with much</p>
<p>better information, that would be great because it will clarify the matter. These are not,</p>
<p>as you said, hundreds of thousands, these are not once in a lifetime events. So it&rsquo;s possible to</p>
<p>take scientific instrumentation and explore, go to the ocean where someone reported that there are</p>
<p>frequent events that are unusual and check it out, do a scientific experiment. Why only do experiments</p>
<p>deep into the ocean and look at the oceanography or do other things. We can do scientific</p>
<p>investigation of these sightings and figure out what they mean. I&rsquo;m very much in favor of that,</p>
<p>but until we have the evidence, I would be doubtful as to what they actually mean.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll have to be humble and acknowledge that we&rsquo;re not that interesting. It&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making me realize that because it&rsquo;s so taboo, that the people that have the equipment,</p>
<p>uh, meaning, and we&rsquo;re not just talking, everybody has cameras now, but to have a large scale,</p>
<p>like a sensor network that collects data that regularly collects, just like we look at the</p>
<p>weather, we&rsquo;re collecting information and then we can then access that information when there is</p>
<p>reports and like have it not be a taboo thing where there&rsquo;s like millions or billions of dollars</p>
<p>or billions of dollars funding this effort that by the way, inspires millions of people.</p>
<p>This is exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about. It&rsquo;s like the scientific community is afraid of a</p>
<p>topic that inspires millions of people. It&rsquo;s absurd. But if you put blinders on your eyes,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see it. Right. I should say that we do have meteors that we see. These are rocks</p>
<p>that by chance happen to collide with the earth and they, if they&rsquo;re small, they burn up in the</p>
<p>atmosphere. But if they&rsquo;re big enough, tens of meters or more, hundreds of meters, the outer</p>
<p>layer burns up, but then the core of the object makes it through. And this is our chance of putting</p>
<p>our hands around an object if this meteor came from interstellar space. So one path of discovery</p>
<p>is to search for interstellar meteors. And with a student of mine, we actually looked through the</p>
<p>record and we thought that we found one example of a meteor that was reported that might have come</p>
<p>from interstellar space. And then another approach is, for example, to look at the moon. The moon is</p>
<p>different from the earth in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t have an atmosphere. So objects do not</p>
<p>burn up on their way to it. It&rsquo;s sort of like a museum. It collects everything. Of rocks from out</p>
<p>there in deep space. Yeah. And there is no geological activity on the moon. So on earth,</p>
<p>every hundred million years, you know, we could have had computer terminals on earth that could</p>
<p>have been a civilization like ours with electronic equipment. Yes. More than a hundred million years</p>
<p>ago. And it&rsquo;s completely lost. You cannot excavate and find it, evidence for it, because in</p>
<p>archaeological digs, because the earth is being mixed on these timescales. And everything that</p>
<p>was on the surface more than a hundred million years ago is buried deep inside the earth right</p>
<p>now because of geological activity. Fascinating to think about, by the way. Yeah. But on the moon,</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t happen. The only thing that happens on the moon is you have objects impacting the moon</p>
<p>and they go 10 meters deep. So they produce some dust, but the moon keeps everything. It&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>museum. It keeps everything on the surface. So if we go to the moon, I would highly recommend</p>
<p>regarding it as an archaeological site. Yes. And looking for objects that are strange. Maybe it</p>
<p>collected some trash, you know, from interstellar space. If we could just linger on the Drake</p>
<p>equation for a little bit. We kind of talked about there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty in the parameters</p>
<p>and the Drake equation itself is very limited. But I think the parameters are interesting in</p>
<p>themselves, even if it&rsquo;s limited, because I think each one is within the reach of science,</p>
<p>right? Did you get the evidence for it? I mean, a few I find really interesting,</p>
<p>could be interesting to get your comment on. So the one with the most variance, I would say,</p>
<p>from my perspective, is the length that civilizations last. However you define it. In the Drake</p>
<p>equation, it&rsquo;s the length of how long you&rsquo;re communicating. Yeah, transmitting.</p>
<p>Transmitting. Just like you said, that&rsquo;s a wrong way to think about it, because we can be detecting</p>
<p>some other outputs of the civilizations, etc. But if we just define broadly how long those</p>
<p>civilizations last, do you have a sense of how long they might last? Like what are the great</p>
<p>filters that might destroy civilizations that we should be thinking about? And how can</p>
<p>science give us more hints on this topic? So I, as I mentioned before, operate by the</p>
<p>Copernican principle, meaning that we are not special. We don&rsquo;t live in a special place</p>
<p>and not in a special time. And by the way, it&rsquo;s just modesty encapsulated in scientific terms,</p>
<p>right? You&rsquo;re saying, I&rsquo;m not special, you know, I find conditions here, they exist</p>
<p>everywhere. So if you adopt the Copernican principle, you basically say, our civilization</p>
<p>transmitted radio signals for a hundred years, roughly, so probably it would last another</p>
<p>hundred or a few hundred and that&rsquo;s it. Because we don&rsquo;t live at a special time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you know, well, of course, if we get our act together and we somehow start</p>
<p>to cooperate rather than fighting each other, killing each other, you know, wasting a lot</p>
<p>of resources on things that would destroy our planet, maybe we can lengthen that period</p>
<p>if we get smarter. But the most natural assumption is to say that we will live into the future as</p>
<p>much as we lived from the time that we start to develop the means for our own destruction,</p>
<p>the technologies we have, which is quite pessimistic, I must say. So several centuries,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would give, unless we get our act, unless we become more intelligent</p>
<p>than the newspapers report every day. Okay. Point number one. Second, and by the way,</p>
<p>this is relevant, I should say, because there was a report about perhaps a radio signal detected</p>
<p>from Proxima Centauri. What do you make of that signal? Oh, I think it&rsquo;s some Australian guy with</p>
<p>a cell phone next to the observatory or something like that, because it was the Parkes Telescope in</p>
<p>Australia. Okay. So it&rsquo;s human created noise. Yeah. Which is always the worry because actually</p>
<p>the same observatory, the Parkes Observatory, detected a couple of years ago some signal</p>
<p>and then they realized that it comes back at lunchtime. Yes. And they said, okay, what could</p>
<p>it be? And then they figured out that it must be the microwave oven in the observatory because</p>
<p>someone was opening it before it finished and it was creating this radio signal that they detected</p>
<p>with a telescope every lunchtime. So just a cautionary remark. But the reason I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>human made, without getting to the technical details, is because of this very short window</p>
<p>by which we were transmitting radio signals out of the lifetime of the Earth. As I said,</p>
<p>100 years out of four and a half billion years that the Earth existed. So what&rsquo;s the chance</p>
<p>that another civilization, a twin civilization of ours, is transmitting radio signals exactly</p>
<p>at the time that we are looking with our radio telescopes? 10 to the minus 7. And the other</p>
<p>argument I have is that they detected it in a very narrow band of frequencies and that makes it</p>
<p>cannot be through natural processes, very narrow band, just like some radio transmissions that we</p>
<p>produce. But if it were to come from the habitable zone, from a transmitter on the surface of Proxima</p>
<p>b, this is the planet that orbits Proxima Centauri, then I calculated that the frequency</p>
<p>would drift through the Doppler effect. Just like when you hear a siren on the street, when the car</p>
<p>approaches you, it has a different pitch than when it recedes away from you, that&rsquo;s the Doppler</p>
<p>effect. And when the planet orbits the star, Proxima Centauri, you would see or detect a</p>
<p>different frequency when the planet approaches us as compared to when it recedes. So there should</p>
<p>be a frequency drift just because of the motion of the planet. And I calculated that it must be</p>
<p>much bigger than observed. So it cannot just be a transmitter sitting on the planet and sending in</p>
<p>our direction a radio signal unless they want to cancel the Doppler effect. But then they need to</p>
<p>know about us because in a different direction, it will not be cancelled. Only in our direction,</p>
<p>they can cancel it perfectly. So there is this direction of Proxima Centauri, but I have a</p>
<p>problem imagining a transmitter on the surface of a planet in the habitable zone emitting it.</p>
<p>But my main issue is really with the likelihood, given what we know about ourselves.</p>
<p>Right. In terms of the duration of the civilization.</p>
<p>The Copernican principle. Yeah.</p>
<p>So nevertheless, this particular signal is likely to be a human interference, perhaps. But</p>
<p>do you find Proxima be interesting? Or the more general question is, do you think we humans</p>
<p>will venture out into outside our solar system and potentially colonize other habitable planets?</p>
<p>Actually, I am involved in a project whose goal is to develop the technology that would allow us</p>
<p>to leave the solar system and visit the nearest stars. And that is called the Star Shot. In 2015,</p>
<p>May 2015, an entrepreneur from Silicon Valley, Yuri Milner, came to my office at Harvard and said,</p>
<p>would you be interested in leading a project that would do that in our lifetime? Because as we</p>
<p>discussed before, to traverse those distances with existing rockets would take tens of thousands of</p>
<p>years. And that&rsquo;s too long. For example, to get to Proxima Centauri with the kind of</p>
<p>spacecrafts that we already sent, like New Horizons or Voyager 1, Voyager 2, you needed to</p>
<p>send them when the first humans left Africa, so that they would arrive there now. And that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>long time to wait. So Yuri wanted to do it within a lifetime, 10, 20 years, meaning it has to move</p>
<p>at a fraction of the speed of light. So can we send a spacecraft that would be moving at the</p>
<p>fraction of the speed of light? And I said, let me look into that for six months. And with my</p>
<p>students and postdocs, we arrived to the conclusion that the only technology that can do that is the</p>
<p>light sail technology, where you basically produce a very powerful laser beam on Earth. So you can</p>
<p>collect sunlight with photovoltaic cells or whatever and then convert it into stored energy</p>
<p>and then produce a very powerful laser beam that is 100 gigawatts and focus it on a sail in space</p>
<p>that is roughly the size of a person, a couple of meters or a few meters, that weighs only a gram</p>
<p>or a few grams, very thin. And through the math, you can show that you can propel such a sail,</p>
<p>if you shine on it for a few minutes, it will traverse the distance that is five times the</p>
<p>distance to the moon, and it will get to a fifth of the speed of light. Sounds crazy. But I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked to a bunch of people and they&rsquo;re like, I know it sounds crazy, but it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>it will work. This is one of those, it&rsquo;s beautiful. I mean, this is science.</p>
<p>And the point is, people didn&rsquo;t get excited about space since the Apollo era. And it&rsquo;s about time,</p>
<p>you know, for us to go into space. A couple of months ago, I was asked to participate in a debate</p>
<p>organized by IBM and Bloomberg News. And the discussion centered on the question,</p>
<p>is the space race between the US and China good for humanity? Oh, interesting. And all the other</p>
<p>debaters were worried about the military threats. And I just couldn&rsquo;t understand what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about, because military threats come from hovering above the surface of the Earth, right?</p>
<p>And we live on a two dimensional surface, we live on the surface of the Earth. But space is</p>
<p>all about the third dimension, getting far from Earth. So if you go to Mars, or you go to a star,</p>
<p>another star, there is no military threat. What are we talking about? Space is all about,</p>
<p>you know, feeling that, you know, we are one civilization, in fact, not fighting each other,</p>
<p>just going far, and having aspirations for something that goes beyond military threats.</p>
<p>So why would we be worried that the space race will lead?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually brilliant. I didn&rsquo;t, you know, there&rsquo;s something in our discourse about it,</p>
<p>the space race is sometimes made synonymous with like the Cold War or something like that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or with wars. But really, yeah, there was a lot of ego tied up in that. I remember,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s still to this day, there&rsquo;s a lot of pride that Russians,</p>
<p>Soviet Union was the first to space. And there&rsquo;s a lot of pride in the American side that was the</p>
<p>first on the moon. But yeah, you&rsquo;re exactly right. Like, there&rsquo;s no aggression, there&rsquo;s no wars.</p>
<p>And beyond that, if you think about the global economy, right now, there is a commercial</p>
<p>interest. That&rsquo;s why Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are interested about, you know, Mars and so on.</p>
<p>There is a commercial interest, which is international. It&rsquo;s driven by money,</p>
<p>not by pride. And, you know, nations can sign treaties. First of all, there are lots of treaties</p>
<p>that were signed even before the First World War and the Second World War and the World War took</p>
<p>place. So who cares, you know, like humans, treaties do not safeguard anything, you know.</p>
<p>But beyond that, even if nations sign treaties about space exploration, you might still find</p>
<p>commercial entities that will find a way to get their launches. And, you know, so I think we</p>
<p>should rethink space. It has nothing to do with national pride. Once again, nothing to do with</p>
<p>our egos. It&rsquo;s about exploration. And the biggest problem, I think, in human history is that humans</p>
<p>tend to think about egos and about their own personal image rather than, look at the big</p>
<p>picture, you know. We will not be around for long. We are just occupying a small space right now.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s move out of this, you know, the way that Oscar Wilde said, I think is the best. He said,</p>
<p>all of us are in the gutters, but some of us are looking at the stars.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the more of us are looking at the stars, the likelier we are to, for this thing,</p>
<p>this little experiment we have going on to last a while as opposed to end too quickly. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about science of being humble. It&rsquo;s about the survival of the human species</p>
<p>as being humble. To me, it&rsquo;s incredibly inspiring, the Starshot project of,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something magical about being able to go to another habitable planet and take</p>
<p>a picture even. I mean, within our lifetime, I mean, that, with crazy technology too, which is&hellip;</p>
<p>I should tell you how it was conceived. So, I was at the time, so after six months passed,</p>
<p>after the visit of Yuri Miller, I was, usually I go in December during the winter break,</p>
<p>I go to Israel. I used to go to see my family and I get a phone call just before the weekend</p>
<p>started. I get a phone call, Yuri would like you to present your concept in two weeks at his home.</p>
<p>And I said, well, thank you for letting me know because I&rsquo;m actually out of the door of the hotel</p>
<p>to go to a goat farm in the Negev, in the southern part of Israel, because my wife wanted to have</p>
<p>to go to a place that is removed from civilization, so to speak.</p>
<p>So, we went to that goat farm and I need to make the presentation and there was no internet</p>
<p>connectivity except in the office of the goat farm. So, the following morning at 6am, I sit</p>
<p>with my back to the office of that goat farm, looking at goats that were newly born and typing</p>
<p>into my laptop, the presentation, the PowerPoint presentation about our ambitions for visiting the</p>
<p>nearest star. And that was very surreal to me. Like our origins in many ways,</p>
<p>this very primitive origins and our dreams of looking out that is brilliant. So that is</p>
<p>incredibly inspiring to me, but it&rsquo;s also inspiring of putting humans onto other</p>
<p>moons or planets. I still find going to the moon really exciting. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe I&rsquo;m just a</p>
<p>sucker for it, but it&rsquo;s really exciting. And Mars, which is a new place, a new planet, another planet</p>
<p>that might have life. I mean, there&rsquo;s something magical to that or some traces of previous life.</p>
<p>You might think that humans cannot really survive and there are risks by going there. But my point</p>
<p>is, we started from Africa and we got to apartment buildings in Manhattan, right? It&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>different environment from the jungles to live in an apartment building in a small cubicle.</p>
<p>Yes. And it took tens of thousands of years,</p>
<p>but humans adapted, right? So why couldn&rsquo;t humans also make the leap and adapt to a habitat in</p>
<p>space? Now you can build a platform that would look like an apartment building in the Bronx</p>
<p>or somewhere, but have inside of it everything that humans need. And just like the space station,</p>
<p>but bigger. And it will be a platform in space. And the advantage of that is if something bad</p>
<p>happens on Earth, you have that complex where humans live. And you can also move it back and</p>
<p>forth depending on how bright the sun gets. Because within a billion years, the sun would be</p>
<p>too hot and it will boil off all the oceans on Earth. So we cannot stay here for more than a</p>
<p>billion years. That&rsquo;s for sure. Yes. So that&rsquo;s a billion years from now. I prefer shorter term</p>
<p>deadlines. And so there&rsquo;s a lot of threats that we&rsquo;re facing currently. Do you find it exciting</p>
<p>the possibility of landing on Mars and starting little like building a Manhattan style apartment</p>
<p>building on Mars and humans occupying it? Do you think from a scientific or an engineering</p>
<p>perspective, that&rsquo;s a worthy pursuit? I think it&rsquo;s worthy. But the real issue that is often</p>
<p>underplayed is the risk to the human body from cosmic rays. These are energetic particles</p>
<p>and we are protected from them by the magnetic field around the Earth that blocks them. But if</p>
<p>you go to Mars, where there is no such magnetic field to block them, then, you know, a significant</p>
<p>fraction of the brain cells in your head will be damaged within a year. And the consequences of</p>
<p>that are not clear. I mean, it&rsquo;s quite possible that humans cannot really survive on the surface.</p>
<p>Now, it may mean that we need to dig tunnels, go underground or create some protection.</p>
<p>This is something that can be engineered. Yes. And, you know, we can start from the</p>
<p>Moon and then move to Mars. That would be a natural progression. But it&rsquo;s a big issue</p>
<p>that needs to be dealt with. I don&rsquo;t think, you know, it&rsquo;s a showstopper. I think we can overcome</p>
<p>it. But, you know, just like anything in science and technology, you have to work on it for a while,</p>
<p>figure out solutions. But it&rsquo;s not as rosy as Elon Musk talks about. I mean, Elon Musk can</p>
<p>obviously be optimistic. I think eventually it will boil down to figuring out how to cope with</p>
<p>this risk, the health risk. Yeah, I mean, in defense of optimism, I find that there&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>least a correlation, if not their best friends, is optimism and open mindedness. It&rsquo;s a necessary</p>
<p>precondition to try crazy things. And in that sense, the sense I have about going to Mars,</p>
<p>if we use today&rsquo;s logic of what kind of benefits we&rsquo;ll get from that, we&rsquo;re never going to go.</p>
<p>And like most decisions we make in life, most decisions we&rsquo;ve made as a human species</p>
<p>are irrational if you look at just today. But if you look at the long arc and the</p>
<p>possibilities that it might bring, just like humans, Europe and destroyed everybody.</p>
<p>But it was a commercial interest that drove that for trade. And, you know, it might happen again,</p>
<p>in this context, you have people like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk that are commercially driven to go</p>
<p>to space. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean that what we will ultimately find is not new worlds that have</p>
<p>nothing, you know, have much more to offer than just commercial interest. And as a side effect,</p>
<p>almost. Yeah, yeah. And then that&rsquo;s why I think, you know, we should be open minded and explore.</p>
<p>And, however, at the same time, because of the reasons you pointed out, I&rsquo;m not optimistic that</p>
<p>we will survive more than a few centuries into the future, because people do not think long term.</p>
<p>And that means that we will only survive for the short term. I don&rsquo;t know if you have thoughts</p>
<p>about this, but what are the things that worry you the most about, from the great perspective</p>
<p>of the universe, which is the great filters that destroys intelligent civilizations,</p>
<p>but for our own species here? Like, what are the things that worry you the most?</p>
<p>Yeah, the thing that worries me the most is that people pay attention to how many likes they have</p>
<p>on Twitter. And rather than, you know, basketball coaches tell the team players, keep your eyes on</p>
<p>the ball, not on the audience. The problem is we keep our eyes on the audience most of the time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep our eyes on the ball. And what does that mean? First of all, in the context of science,</p>
<p>it means pay attention to the evidence. When the evidence looks strange,</p>
<p>then we should figure it out. You know, I went to a seminar about Umuamua at Harvard,</p>
<p>and a colleague of mine that is mainstream, conservative, would never say anything that would</p>
<p>deviate from what everyone else is thinking, said to me after the seminar, I wish this object never</p>
<p>existed. Now, to me, I mean, I just couldn&rsquo;t hear that. What do you mean, nature is whatever it is,</p>
<p>you have to pay attention to it. You cannot say, you know, you cannot bury your head in this. I</p>
<p>mean, you should bless nature for giving you clues about things that you haven&rsquo;t expected.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the biggest fault that we are looking for confirmations of things we already</p>
<p>know, so that we can maintain our pride that we already knew it, and maintain our image,</p>
<p>not make mistakes, because we already knew it, therefore we expected the right thing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But science is a learning experience, and sometimes you&rsquo;re wrong. And let&rsquo;s learn from</p>
<p>those mistakes. And what&rsquo;s the problem about that? Why do we have to get, you know, prizes,</p>
<p>and why do we get to be honored and maintain our image, when the actual objective of science is</p>
<p>learning about nature?</p>
<p>And like you&rsquo;ve talked about, anomalies in this case are actually are not things that</p>
<p>are unfortunate and to be ignored are, in fact, gifts and should be the focus of science.</p>
<p>Exactly, because that&rsquo;s the way for us to improve our understanding. If you look at quantum</p>
<p>mechanics, nobody dreamed about it. And it was revolutionary, and we still don&rsquo;t fully understand</p>
<p>it. It&rsquo;s a pain for us to figure out.</p>
<p>So I understand from the perspective that&rsquo;s holding our science back, why do you have</p>
<p>a sense that that&rsquo;s also something that might be a problem for us in terms of the survival</p>
<p>of human civilization?</p>
<p>Because when you look at society, it operates by the same principles. People look for affirmation</p>
<p>by groups, and they, you know, people segregate into herds that think like them, especially</p>
<p>these days when social media is so strong, you can find your support group. And if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look for evidence for what you&rsquo;re saying, you can say crazy things as long as there</p>
<p>are enough people supporting what you say. You can even have your newspapers, you can</p>
<p>have everything to support your view, and then, you know, bad things will happen to</p>
<p>society. Because we&rsquo;re detaching ourselves from reality. And if we detach ourselves</p>
<p>from reality, all the destructive things that naturally can occur in the real world, whether</p>
<p>from nuclear weapons, all the kinds of threats that we&rsquo;re facing, even we&rsquo;re living through</p>
<p>a pandemic, the supposed, you know, a much, much worse pandemic could happen. And then</p>
<p>we could sadly, like we did this one, politicize it in some kind of way and have bickering</p>
<p>in the space of Twitter and politics, as opposed to there&rsquo;s an actual thing that can destroy</p>
<p>the human species.</p>
<p>Exactly. So the only way for us to maintain, to stay modest and learn about what really</p>
<p>happens is by looking for evidence. Again, I&rsquo;m saying, it&rsquo;s not about ourself, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about figuring out what&rsquo;s around us. And if you close yourself by surrounding yourself</p>
<p>with people that are like minded, that refuse to look at the evidence, you can do bad things.</p>
<p>And throughout human history, that&rsquo;s the origin of all the bad things that happen.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a key. It&rsquo;s a key to be modest and to look at evidence. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a nuance. Now, you might say, Oh, okay, the uneducated person might operate. No,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the scientific community operates this way. My problem is not with people that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have an academic pedigree. It&rsquo;s included everywhere in society.</p>
<p>On the topic of the discovery of evidence of alien civilizations, which is something</p>
<p>you touch on in your book, what that idea would do to societies, to the human psyche</p>
<p>and in general, do you think, and you talk about the, I still have trouble pronouncing,</p>
<p>but a Muamua wager, right? What do you think is, can you explain it? And what do you think</p>
<p>in general is the effect that such knowledge might have on human civilization?</p>
<p>Right. So Pascal had this wager about God. And by the way, there are interesting connections</p>
<p>between theology and the search for extraterrestrial life. It&rsquo;s possible that we were planted on</p>
<p>this planet by another civilization. We attribute to God powers that belong really to the technological</p>
<p>civilization. But putting that aside, Pascal basically said, there are two possibilities,</p>
<p>there are two possibilities, either God exists or not. And if God exists, the consequences</p>
<p>are quite significant. And therefore, we should consider that possibility differently than</p>
<p>equal weight to both possibilities. And I suggest that we do the same with Muamua or</p>
<p>other technological signatures, that we keep in mind the consequences and therefore pay</p>
<p>more attention to that possibility. Now, some people say extraordinary claims require extraordinary</p>
<p>evidence. My point is that the term extraordinary is really subjective. For one person, a black hole</p>
<p>is extraordinary. For another, it&rsquo;s just a consequence of Einstein&rsquo;s theory of gravity. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing extraordinary. The same about the type of dark matter, anything. So we should leave the</p>
<p>extraordinary part of that sentence. Just keep evidence, okay? So let&rsquo;s be guided by evidence.</p>
<p>And even if we have extraordinary claims, let&rsquo;s not dismiss them because the evidence is not</p>
<p>extraordinary enough. Because if we have an image of something and it looks really strange and we</p>
<p>say, oh, the image is not sufficiently sharp, therefore, we should not even pay attention to</p>
<p>this image or not even consider. I think that&rsquo;s a mistake. What we should do is say, look, there is</p>
<p>some evidence for something unusual. Let&rsquo;s try and build instruments that will give us a better</p>
<p>image. And if you just dismiss extraordinary claims, because you consider them extraordinary,</p>
<p>you avoid discovering things that you haven&rsquo;t expected. And so I believe that along the history</p>
<p>of astronomy, there are many missed opportunities. And I speak about astronomy, but I&rsquo;m sure in other</p>
<p>fields, it&rsquo;s also true. I mean, this is my expertise. For example, you know, the Astrophysical</p>
<p>Journal, which is the main primary publication in astrophysics. If you go before the 1980s,</p>
<p>there are images that were posted in the Astrophysical Journal of giant arcs, you know, arcs</p>
<p>of light surrounding clusters of galaxies. And, you know, you can find it in printed versions of</p>
<p>the Astrophysical Journal. People just ignore it. They put the image, they see the arc, they say,</p>
<p>who knows what it is and just ignore it. And then in the 1980s, the subject of gravitational</p>
<p>lensing became popular. And the idea is that you can deflect light by the force of gravity. And</p>
<p>then you can put a source behind the cluster of galaxies, and then you will get these arcs. And</p>
<p>actually, Einstein predicted it in 1940. And, you know, so these things were expected, but</p>
<p>people just had them in the images, didn&rsquo;t pay attention. So I&rsquo;m sure there are lost opportunities</p>
<p>sometimes. Even in existing data, you have things that are unusual and exceptional and are not being</p>
<p>addressed. Yeah, you actually, I think you have an article, the data is not enough from quite a few</p>
<p>years ago, where you talk, you know, we can go back to the 70s and 80s, but we can go also to the</p>
<p>Mayan civilization. Right, the Mayan civilization basically believed in astrology that you can</p>
<p>forecast the outcome of a war based on the position of the planets. And they had, you know,</p>
<p>astronomers in their culture had the highest social status. They were priests, they were elevated.</p>
<p>And the reason was that they helped politicians decide when to go to war, because they would tell</p>
<p>the politicians, you know, the planets would be in this configuration, it&rsquo;s a better chance for you</p>
<p>to win the war, go to war. And in retrospect, they collected wonderful data, but misinterpreted it,</p>
<p>because we now know that the position of Venus or Jupiter or whatever has nothing to do with the</p>
<p>outcome of World War I, World War II, you know, has nothing to do. And so we can have a prejudice</p>
<p>and collect data without actually doing the right thing with it. That&rsquo;s such a Pisces thing to say.</p>
<p>I looked up what your astrological sign is.</p>
<p>Well, so you mentioned Einstein predicted that black holes don&rsquo;t exist, or just didn&rsquo;t, or thought.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t exist in nature.</p>
<p>When Einstein came up with his theory of gravity in 1915, November 1915, a few months later,</p>
<p>another physicist, Karl Schwarzschild, he was the director of the Potsdam Observatory,</p>
<p>but he was a patriot, a German patriot. So he went into the First World War fighting for Germany.</p>
<p>But while he was at the front, he sent a postcard to Einstein saying, you know,</p>
<p>a few months after the theory was developed, saying, actually, I found a solution to your</p>
<p>equations. And that was a black hole solution. And then he died a few months later. And Einstein</p>
<p>was a pacifist, and he survived. So the lesson from this story is that if you want to work out</p>
<p>the consequences of a theory, you better be a pacifist. But the point is that this solution</p>
<p>was known shortly after Einstein came up with his theory. But in 1939, Einstein wrote a paper</p>
<p>in the Annals of Mathematics saying, even though the solution exists,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s realized in nature. And his argument was, if you imagine a star collapsing,</p>
<p>stars often spin, and the spin will prevent them from making a black hole, collapsing to a point.</p>
<p>So, I mean, can you maybe, one of the many things you have worked on, you&rsquo;re an expert in,</p>
<p>is black holes. Can you first say, what are black holes? And second, how do we know that they exist?</p>
<p>Right. So black holes are the ultimate prison. You know, you can check in, but you can never check out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s romantic.</p>
<p>You can never check out. Even light cannot escape from them. So there are extreme structures of</p>
<p>space and time. And there is this so called Schwarzschild radius or the event horizon of</p>
<p>a black hole. Once you enter into it with a spaceship, you would never be able to tweet</p>
<p>back to your friends and tell them, by the way, I asked the students in my class, freshman seminar</p>
<p>at Harvard, I said, let me give you two possible journeys that you can take. I said, suppose aliens</p>
<p>come to Earth and suggest that you would board their spaceship, would you do it? And the second</p>
<p>is, suppose you could board a spaceship that will take you into a black hole, would you do it?</p>
<p>So all of them said to the first question, yes, under one condition, that I&rsquo;ll be able to maintain</p>
<p>my social media contacts and report back, share the experience with them. Personally, I have no</p>
<p>footprint on social media.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is as a matter of principle.</p>
<p>Yeah, my wife asked me when we got married, and I honor that.</p>
<p>And I told you offline, I need to get married to such a woman. She truly is a special agent.</p>
<p>Well, she was wise enough to recognize the risk. But it saves me time. And it also keeps me away</p>
<p>from crowds. I don&rsquo;t have the notion of what a lot of other people think, so I can think</p>
<p>independently.</p>
<p>Crowd think, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. So I was surprised to hear that for students, it&rsquo;s extremely important to share</p>
<p>experiences. Even if they go on a spaceship with aliens, they still want to brag about it rather</p>
<p>than look around and see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>This is not an option when you go to the black hole, is exactly the point.</p>
<p>So for the black hole, they said no, because obviously you can find your death after you get</p>
<p>into it, you crash into singularity. There is this singularity in the center. So inside the event</p>
<p>horizon, we know that all the matter collects at a point. Now, we can&rsquo;t really predict what happens</p>
<p>at the singularity because Einstein&rsquo;s theory breaks down. And we know why it breaks down,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have quantum mechanics that talks about small distances. We don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>theory that unifies quantum mechanics and gravity so that it will predict what happens near a</p>
<p>singularity. And in fact, a couple of years ago, I had a flood in my basement. And I invited a</p>
<p>plumber to come over and figure out and we found that the sewer was clogged because of</p>
<p>tree roots that got into it. And we solved the problem. But then I thought to myself,</p>
<p>well, isn&rsquo;t that what happens at the singularity of a black hole? Because the question is,</p>
<p>where does the matter go? In the case of a home, I never thought about it, but the water,</p>
<p>all the water that we use, goes in through the sewer to some reservoir somewhere. And the question</p>
<p>is, what happens inside a black hole? And one possibility is that there is an object in the</p>
<p>middle, just like a star, and everything collects there. And the object has the maximum density that</p>
<p>we can imagine, like Planck density. It&rsquo;s the ultimate density that you can have, where gravity</p>
<p>is as strong as all the other forces. So you can imagine this object, very dense object at the</p>
<p>center that collects all the matter. Another possibility is that there is some tunnel just</p>
<p>like the sewer. It takes the matter into another place. And we don&rsquo;t know the answer. But I wrote</p>
<p>a Scientific American essay about it, admitting our ignorance. It&rsquo;s a fascinating question. What</p>
<p>happens to the matter that goes into a black hole? I actually recommend it to some of my colleagues</p>
<p>that work on string theory. At the closing of a conference, I&rsquo;m the founding director of the Black</p>
<p>Hole Initiative at Harvard, which brings together astronomers, physicists, philosophers, and</p>
<p>mathematicians. And we have a conference once a year. And at the end of one of them, since I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>director, I had to summarize. And I said that I wish we could go on a field trip to a black hole</p>
<p>nearby. And I highly recommend to my colleagues that work on string theory to enter into that</p>
<p>black hole, because then they can test their theory when they get inside. But one of the</p>
<p>string theorists in the audience, Nimar Khani Hamad, immediately raised his voice and said,</p>
<p>you have an ulterior motive for sending us into a black hole, which I didn&rsquo;t deny, but at any event.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true. That&rsquo;s true. Can you say why we know that black holes exist?</p>
<p>Right. So it&rsquo;s an interesting question because black holes were considered a theoretical</p>
<p>construct. And Einstein even denied their existence in 1939. But then in the mid 1960s, quasars were</p>
<p>discovered. These are very bright sources of light, 100 times brighter than their host galaxy,</p>
<p>which are point like at the center of galaxies. And it was immediately suggested</p>
<p>by Ed Salpeter in the West and by Yakov Zeldovich in the East, that these are black holes that</p>
<p>accrete gas, collect gas from their host galaxy that are being fed with gas. And they shine very</p>
<p>brightly because as the gas falls towards the black holes, just like water running down the sink,</p>
<p>the gas swirls and then rubs against itself and heats up and shines very brightly because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very hot close to the black hole. By viscosity, it heats up. And in the case of black holes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the turbulence, the turbulent viscosity that causes it to heat up. So we get these very bright</p>
<p>sources of light just from black holes that are supposed to be dark, nothing but black holes.</p>
<p>You know, nothing escapes from them, but they create a violent environment where gas moves</p>
<p>close to the speed of light and therefore shines very brightly, much more than any other source</p>
<p>in the sky. And we can see these quasars all the way to the edge of the universe.</p>
<p>So we have evidence now that when the universe was, you know, about 7% of its present age,</p>
<p>you know, infant, already back then you had black holes of a billion times the mass of the sun,</p>
<p>which is quite remarkable. It&rsquo;s like finding giant babies in a nursery, you know, like how can these</p>
<p>black holes grow so fast? You know, less than a billion years after the Big Bang, you already have</p>
<p>a billion times the mass of the sun in these black holes. And the answer is presumably there are very</p>
<p>quick processes that build them up. They build quickly. Very quickly. And so we see those black</p>
<p>holes, and that was found in the mid 1960s. But in 2015, exactly 100 years after Einstein came up</p>
<p>with his theory of gravity, the LIGO observatory detected gravitational waves. And these are just</p>
<p>ripples in space and time. So according to Einstein&rsquo;s theory, the innovation, the ingenuity</p>
<p>of Einstein&rsquo;s theory of gravity that was formulated in November 1915 was to say that space and time</p>
<p>are not rigid. You know, they respond to matter. So, for example, if you have two black holes and</p>
<p>they collide, it&rsquo;s just like a stone being thrown on the surface of a pond. They generate waves,</p>
<p>disturbances in space and time that propagate out at the speed of light. These are gravitational</p>
<p>waves. They create a space time storm around them, and then the waves go all the way through</p>
<p>the universe and reach us. And if you have a sensitive enough detector like LIGO, you can</p>
<p>detect these waves. And so it was not just the message that we received for the first time,</p>
<p>gravitational waves, but it was the messenger. So there are two aspects to it. One is the messenger</p>
<p>which is gravitational wave for the first time were detected directly. And the second was the</p>
<p>message, which was a collision of two black holes, because we could see the pattern of the ripples</p>
<p>in space and time. And it was fully consistent with the prediction that Schwarzschild made for</p>
<p>how the space time around the black hole is, because when two black holes collide, you can sort</p>
<p>of map from the message that you get, you can reconstruct what really happened and it&rsquo;s fully</p>
<p>consistent. And in 2017 and 2020, there&rsquo;s two Nobel prizes. That&rsquo;s right. That had to do with the</p>
<p>black holes. Can you maybe describe in the same masterful way that you&rsquo;ve already been doing what</p>
<p>the 2017 was given for the LIGO collaboration for discovering gravitation waves from collisions</p>
<p>of black holes? And the 2020 Nobel prize in physics was given for two things. One was</p>
<p>theoretical work that was done by Roger Penrose in the 1960s, demonstrating that black holes are</p>
<p>inevitable when stars collapse. And it was mostly mathematical work. And actually, Stephen Hawking</p>
<p>also contributed significantly to that frontier. And unfortunately, he is not alive, so he could</p>
<p>not be honored. So Penrose received it on his own. And then two other astronomers received it as well,</p>
<p>Andrea Ghez and Reinhard Genzel, and they provided conclusive evidence that there is a black hole at</p>
<p>the center of the Milky Way galaxy that weighs about 4 million times the mass of the sun. And</p>
<p>they found the evidence from the motion of stars very close to the black hole. Just like we see the</p>
<p>planets moving around the sun, there are stars close to the center of the galaxy and they are</p>
<p>orbiting at very high speeds of other thousands of kilometers per second or thousands of miles per</p>
<p>second per second. Think about it. Which can only be induced at those distances if there is a 4</p>
<p>million solar mass object that is extremely compact. And the only thing that is compatible</p>
<p>with the constraints is a black hole. And they actually made a movie of the motion of these</p>
<p>stars around the center. One of them moves around the center over a decade, over timescales that we</p>
<p>can monitor. And it was a breakthrough in a way. So combining LIGO with the detection of a black</p>
<p>hole at the center of the Milky Way and in many other galaxies like quasars, now I would say</p>
<p>black hole research is vogue. It&rsquo;s very much in fashion. We saw it back in 2016 when we established</p>
<p>the black hole initiative. You kind of saw that there&rsquo;s this excitement about in breakthroughs</p>
<p>and discoveries around black holes which are probably one of the most fascinating objects</p>
<p>in the universe. It&rsquo;s up there. They&rsquo;re both terrifying and beautiful and they capture the</p>
<p>entirety of the physics that we know about this universe. I should say the question is where is</p>
<p>the nearest black hole? Can we visit it? And I wrote a paper with my undergraduate student,</p>
<p>Amir Siraj, suggesting that perhaps if there is one in the solar system, we can detect it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you heard, but there is a claim that maybe there is a</p>
<p>planet nine in the solar system because we see some anomalies at the outer parts of the solar</p>
<p>system. So some people suggested maybe there is a planet out there that was not yet detected. So</p>
<p>people searched for it, didn&rsquo;t find it. It weighs roughly five times the mass of the earth. And we</p>
<p>said, okay, maybe you can&rsquo;t find it because it&rsquo;s a black hole that was formed early in the universe.</p>
<p>Where do you stand on that?</p>
<p>It could be that the dark matter is made of black holes of this mass. We don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>the dark matter is made of. It could be the black holes. So we said, but there is an experimental</p>
<p>way to test it. And the way to do it is because there is the Oort cloud of icy rocks in the outer</p>
<p>solar system. And if you imagine a black hole there, every now and then a rock will pass close</p>
<p>enough to the black hole to be disrupted by the very strong gravity close to the black hole. And</p>
<p>that would produce a flare that you can observe. And we calculated how frequently these flares</p>
<p>should occur. And with LSST on the Vera Rubin Observatory, we found that you can actually</p>
<p>test this hypothesis. And if you don&rsquo;t see flares, then you can put limits on the existence of a</p>
<p>black hole in the solar system. It would be extremely exciting if there was a black hole,</p>
<p>if planet nine was a black hole, because we could visit it and we can examine it. And it will not</p>
<p>be a matter of an object that is very removed from us. Another thing I should say is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible that the black hole affected life on Earth. The black hole at the center of the Milky</p>
<p>Way. How? That black hole right now is dormant. It&rsquo;s very faint. But we know that it flares.</p>
<p>When a star like the sun comes close to it, the star will be spaghettified, basically become a</p>
<p>stream of gas, like a spaghetti. And then the gas would fall into the black hole and there would be</p>
<p>a flare. And this process happens once every 10,000 years or so. So we expect that these flares to</p>
<p>occur every 10,000 years. But we also see evidence for the possibility that gas clouds were disrupted</p>
<p>by the black hole, because the stars that are close to the black hole are residing in a single</p>
<p>or two planes. And the only way you can get that is if they formed out of a disk of gas,</p>
<p>just like the planets in the solar system formed. So there is evidence that gas fell into the black</p>
<p>hole and powered possibly a flare. And these flares produce x rays and ultraviolet radiation</p>
<p>that could damage life if the Earth was close enough to the center of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Where we are right now, it&rsquo;s not very risky for us. But there is a theoretical argument that says</p>
<p>the solar system, the sun, was closer to the galactic center early on, and then it migrated</p>
<p>outwards. So maybe in the early stage of the solar system, the conditions were affected,</p>
<p>shaped by these flares of the black hole at the center of the galaxy. And that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>for the first two billion years, there wasn&rsquo;t any oxygen in the atmosphere, who knows. But</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just interesting to think that from a theoretical concept that Einstein resisted in 1939,</p>
<p>it may well be that black holes have influence on our life. And that it&rsquo;s just like discovering that</p>
<p>some stranger affected your family and in a way your life. And if that happens to be the case,</p>
<p>a second Nobel Prize should be given, not for just the discovery of this black hole at the</p>
<p>center of the galaxy, but perhaps for the Nobel Prize in chemistry, for the effect that it had.</p>
<p>For the effect for the interplay that resulted in some kind of, yeah, the chemical effect,</p>
<p>biology, I mean, all those kinds of things in terms of the emergence of life and the creation</p>
<p>of a habitable environment. That&rsquo;s so fascinating. And of course, like you said, dark matter, like</p>
<p>black holes have some&hellip; They could be the dark matter in principle, yes. We don&rsquo;t know what the</p>
<p>dark matter is at the moment. Does it make you sad? So you&rsquo;ve had an interaction and perhaps</p>
<p>a bit of a friendship with Stephen Hawking. Does it make you sad that he didn&rsquo;t win the Nobel?</p>
<p>Well, all together, I don&rsquo;t assign great importance to prizes because, you know,</p>
<p>Jean Paul Sartre, who I admired as a teenager, because I was interested in philosophy. When I</p>
<p>grew up on a farm in Israel, I used to collect eggs every afternoon and I would drive the tractor to</p>
<p>the hills of our village and just think about philosophy, read philosophy books. And Jean Paul</p>
<p>Sartre was one of my favorites. And he was honored with a Nobel Prize in literature. He was a</p>
<p>philosopher primarily, existentialist. And he said, the hell with it. Why should I give</p>
<p>special attention to this committee of people that get their self importance from awarding me</p>
<p>the prize? Why does that merit my attention? So he gave up on the Nobel Prize. And</p>
<p>you know, there are two benefits to that. One, that you&rsquo;re not working your entire life in the</p>
<p>direction that would satisfy the will of other people. You work independently, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>after these honors. Just for the same reason that if you&rsquo;re not living your life for making a profit</p>
<p>or money, you can live a more fulfilling life because you&rsquo;re not being swayed by the wind,</p>
<p>you know, of how to make money and so forth. The second aspect of it is, you know, that</p>
<p>very often, you know, these prizes, they distort the way we do science because instead of people</p>
<p>willing to take risks, and instead of having announcements only after a group of people</p>
<p>converges with a definite result, you know, the natural progression of science is based on trial</p>
<p>and error, you know, reporting some results, and perhaps they&rsquo;re wrong, but then other people find</p>
<p>perhaps better evidence, and then you figure out what&rsquo;s going on. And that&rsquo;s the natural way that</p>
<p>science is, you know, it&rsquo;s a learning experience. So if you give the public an image by which</p>
<p>scientists are always right, you know, and you know, some of my colleagues say we must do that,</p>
<p>because otherwise the public will never believe us that global warming is really taking place.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not true, because the public would really believe you if you show the evidence. So</p>
<p>the point is, you should be sincere. When the evidence is not absolutely clear, or where there</p>
<p>are disputes about the interpretation of the evidence, we should show ourselves. You know,</p>
<p>the king is naked, okay? There is no point in pretending that the king is dressed,</p>
<p>saying that scientists are always right. Scientists are wrong, frequently. And the only way to make</p>
<p>progress is by evidence, giving us the support that we need to make airtight arguments. So when</p>
<p>you say global warming is taking place, if the evidence is fully supportive, there are no holes</p>
<p>in the argument, then people will be convinced, because you&rsquo;re not trying to fool them. When the</p>
<p>evidence was not complete, you also show them that the evidence is not complete.</p>
<p>And when there&rsquo;s holes, you show that there&rsquo;s holes, and here&rsquo;s the methodology we&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>to try to close those holes. Exactly. Let&rsquo;s be sincere. Why pretend? So if there were no,</p>
<p>in a world where there were no prizes, no honours, we would act like kids, as I said before.</p>
<p>We would really be focusing on the ball and not on the audience. Yeah, the prizes get in the way,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so powerful. Do you think, in some sense, the few people that have turned down the prize</p>
<p>made a much more powerful statement? I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar in the space of mathematics</p>
<p>with the Fields Medal and Google Perlman turned down the prize. One of the reasons I started</p>
<p>this podcast is I&rsquo;m going to definitely talk to Putin, I&rsquo;m definitely talking to Perlman,</p>
<p>and people keep telling me it&rsquo;s impossible. I love hearing that, because I&rsquo;ll talk to both.</p>
<p>Anyway, but do you have a sense of why he turned down the prize,</p>
<p>and is that a powerful statement to you? Well, what I read is that he was disappointed by the</p>
<p>response of the community, the mainstream community, the mathematicians, to his earlier work,</p>
<p>where they dismissed it, they didn&rsquo;t attend to the details, and didn&rsquo;t treat him with proper</p>
<p>respect, because he was not considered one of them. And I think that speaks volumes about the</p>
<p>current scientific culture, which is based on groupthink and on social interaction, rather</p>
<p>than on the merit of the argument, and on the evidence in the context of physics. So in mathematics</p>
<p>there is no empirical basis, you&rsquo;re exploring ideas that are logically consistent, but nevertheless</p>
<p>there is this groupthink. And I think he was so frustrated with his past experience that he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even bother to publish his papers, he just posted them on the archive, and in a way saying, you know,</p>
<p>I know what the answer is, go look at it. And then again, in the long arc of history,</p>
<p>his work on archive will be remembered, and all the prizes, most of the prizes will be forgotten,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t kind of think about. When you look at Roger Penrose, for example,</p>
<p>is another fascinating figure, you know, it&rsquo;s possible, and forgive me if this, I&rsquo;m sure,</p>
<p>my ignorance, but he&rsquo;s also did some work on consciousness. He&rsquo;s been one of the only people</p>
<p>who spoke about consciousness, which for the longest time, and is still arguably outside</p>
<p>the realm of the sciences. It&rsquo;s still seen as a taboo subject, and he was brave enough to explore</p>
<p>it from a physics perspective, from just a philosophical perspective, but like with the rigor,</p>
<p>like proposing different kind of hypotheses of how consciousness might be able to emerge in the brain,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s possible that that is the thing he&rsquo;s remembered for if you look 100 years from now,</p>
<p>right? As opposed to the work in the black holes, which fits into what the current scientific</p>
<p>community allows to be the space of what is and isn&rsquo;t science. Yeah, it&rsquo;s really interesting to</p>
<p>look at people that are innovators, where in some phases of their career, their ideas fit into the</p>
<p>social structure that is around them, but in other phases, it doesn&rsquo;t. And when you look at them,</p>
<p>they just operated the same way throughout, and it says more about their environment than about them.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, and I don&rsquo;t know if you know who Max Tegmark is, I just recently talked to him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a friend of mine.</p>
<p>I just recently talked to him again, and he, I mean, he was a little bit more explicit about</p>
<p>saying, you know, being aware, which is something I also recommend, is like being aware where the</p>
<p>scientific community stands, and doing enough to get, like move along into your career, in your</p>
<p>career. And it&rsquo;s the necessary evil, I suppose, if you are one of those out of the box thinkers that</p>
<p>just naturally have this childlike curiosity, which Max definitely is one of them, is sometimes</p>
<p>you have to do some stuff that fits in, you publish and you get tenure and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But the tenure is a great privilege because it allows you to, in principle, explore things that</p>
<p>are not accepted by others. And unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not being taken advantage of by most people,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a waste of a very precious resource.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. The space that you kind of touched on that&rsquo;s full of theories and is perhaps</p>
<p>detached from appreciation of empirical evidence, or longing for empirical evidence, or grounding</p>
<p>in empirical evidence, is the theoretical physics community and the interest in unifying the laws</p>
<p>of physics and with the theory of everything. I&rsquo;m not sure from which direction to approach this</p>
<p>question, but how far away are we from arriving at a theory of everything, do you think? And how</p>
<p>would we, how important is it to try to arrive at it, at this kind of goal of this beautiful simple</p>
<p>theory that unlocks the very, you know, fundamental basis of our nature as we know it? And, you know,</p>
<p>and how, what are the kinds of approaches we need to take to get there?</p>
<p>Yeah, so in physics, the biggest challenge is to unify quantum mechanics with gravity.</p>
<p>And I believe that once we have experimental evidence for how this happens in nature,</p>
<p>in systems that have quantum mechanical effects, but also gravity is important,</p>
<p>then the theory will fall into our lap, okay? But the mistake that is made by the community</p>
<p>right now is to come up with the right theory from scratch. And, you know, Einstein gave the</p>
<p>illusion that you can just sit in your office and understand nature, you know, when he came up with</p>
<p>his general theory of relativity. But, you know, first of all, perhaps he was lucky, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a rule. The rule is that you need evidence to guide you, especially when dealing with quantum</p>
<p>mechanics, which is really not intuitive. And so there are two places where the two theories meet.</p>
<p>One is black holes, and there is a puzzle there. It&rsquo;s called the information paradox.</p>
<p>In principle, you can throw the Encyclopedia Britannica into a black hole. It&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>information. And then it will be gone because a black hole carries only three properties or</p>
<p>qualities, the mass, the charge, and the spin, according to Einstein. But then when Hawking</p>
<p>tried to bring in quantum mechanics to the game, he realized that black holes have a temperature</p>
<p>and they radiate. This is called Hawking radiation. It was sort of anticipated by</p>
<p>Jacob Bekenstein before him, and Hawking wanted to prove Bekenstein wrong and then figure this out.</p>
<p>And so what it means is black holes eventually evaporate. And they evaporate into radiation that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t carry this information, according to Hawking&rsquo;s calculation. And then the question is,</p>
<p>according to quantum mechanics, information must be preserved. So where did the information go</p>
<p>if a black hole is gone? And where is the information that was encoded in the Encyclopedia</p>
<p>when it went into the black hole? And to that question, we don&rsquo;t have an answer yet. It&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of those puzzles about black holes. And it touches on the interplay between quantum mechanics and</p>
<p>gravity. Another important question is what happened at the beginning of the universe?</p>
<p>What happened before the Big Bang? And by the way, on that, I should say, you know, there are some</p>
<p>conjectures. In principle, if we figure it out, if we have a theory of quantum gravity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to imagine that we will figure out how to create a universe in the laboratory.</p>
<p>And by irritating the vacuum, you might create a baby universe. And if we do that,</p>
<p>it will offer a solution to what happened before the Big Bang. Perhaps the Big Bang emerged from</p>
<p>the laboratory of another civilization. So it&rsquo;s like baby universes are being born out of</p>
<p>laboratories. And inside the baby universe, you have a civilization that brings to existence a</p>
<p>new baby universe. So just like humans, right? We have babies and they make babies. So in principle,</p>
<p>that would solve the problem of why there was a Big Bang and also what happened before the Big</p>
<p>Bang. So we came, our umbilical cord is connected to a laboratory of a civilization that produced</p>
<p>our universe once it figured out quantum gravity, you know. It&rsquo;s baby Big Bangs all the way down.</p>
<p>So if we collect data about how the universe started, we could potentially test</p>
<p>theories of, or it can educate us about how to unify quantum mechanics and gravity.</p>
<p>If we get any information about what happens near the singularity of a black hole,</p>
<p>you know, if we get a sense of, you know, somehow we learn what happens at the same,</p>
<p>that would educate. So there are places where we can search for evidence, but it&rsquo;s very challenging,</p>
<p>I should say. And my point is, you know, the string theorists, they decided that they know</p>
<p>how to approach the problem, that they don&rsquo;t have a single theory. There is a multitude of theories</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not tightly constrained and they cannot make predictions about black holes or about the</p>
<p>beginning of the universe. So at the moment I say we&rsquo;re at a loss. And the way I feel about this</p>
<p>concept of the theory of everything, we should wait until we get enough evidence to guide us.</p>
<p>And until then, you know, there are many important problems that we can address,</p>
<p>you know. Why bang our head against the wall on a problem for which we have no guidance?</p>
<p>Right. We don&rsquo;t have a good dance partner in terms of evidence. There&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;d be interesting, just like you said, I mean, the lab is one place to create</p>
<p>universes or black holes, but it&rsquo;d be fascinating if there is indeed a black hole in our solar</p>
<p>system that you can interact with. So the problem with the origin of the universe</p>
<p>is all you can do is collect data about it, right? You can&rsquo;t interact with it.</p>
<p>Well, you can, for example, detect gravitational waves that emerged from that. And, you know,</p>
<p>there is an effort to do that and that could potentially tell us something. But yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a challenge and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re stuck. So I should say, despite what physicists portray,</p>
<p>that, you know, we live through an exceptional growth in our understanding of the universe,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually pretty much stuck, I would say, because we don&rsquo;t know the nature of the dark</p>
<p>matter. Most of the matter in the universe, we don&rsquo;t know what it is. And we don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>the universe started. We don&rsquo;t know what happens in the interior of a black hole.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve thought quite a bit about dark matter as well. Do you have any kind of hypothesis,</p>
<p>interesting hypothesis? We already mentioned a few about what is dark matter and what are the</p>
<p>possible paths that we could take to unlock the mystery of dark? What is dark matter?</p>
<p>Yeah. So what we need is some anomalies that would hint what the nature of the dark matter is,</p>
<p>or to detect it in the laboratory. There are lots of laboratory experiments searching,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like searching for a needle in a haystack, because there are so many possibilities</p>
<p>for the type of particle that it may be. But maybe at some point, you know, we&rsquo;ll find either</p>
<p>a particle or black holes as the dark matter, or something else. But at the moment&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you also maybe, sorry to interrupt, comment about what is dark matter?</p>
<p>Like what, it&rsquo;s just a name we assign to what?</p>
<p>So most of the community believes that it&rsquo;s a particle that we haven&rsquo;t yet detected. It doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>interact with light, so it&rsquo;s dark. But the question is, what does it interact with,</p>
<p>and how can we find it? And for many years, physicists were guided by the idea that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some extension of the standard model of particle physics. But then they said,</p>
<p>oh, we will find some clues from the Large Hadron Collider about its nature. Or maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s related to supersymmetry, which is a new symmetry that we haven&rsquo;t found any evidence for.</p>
<p>In both cases, the Large Hadron Collider did not give us any clues. And other people search for</p>
<p>specific types of particles in the laboratory and didn&rsquo;t find any. A couple of years ago,</p>
<p>actually, around the time that I worked on Oumuamua, I also worked on the possibility that</p>
<p>the dark matter particles may have a small electric charge, which is a speculation, but</p>
<p>nobody complained about it. And, you know, it was published and I regarded it more as</p>
<p>of a speculation than the artificial origin of Oumuamua. And to me, I apply, you know,</p>
<p>as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I apply the same scientific tools in both cases. There is an</p>
<p>anomaly that led me to that discussion, which has to do with hydrogen being cold in the early</p>
<p>universe more than we expected. So we suggested maybe the dark matter particles have some small</p>
<p>charge. But then you deal with anomalies by exploring possibilities. That&rsquo;s the only way to</p>
<p>do it, and then collecting more data to check those. And searching for technological signatures</p>
<p>is the same as any other part of our scientific endeavor. We make hypotheses and we collect data,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t see any reason for having a taboo on this subject.</p>
<p>In your childlike, open minded excitement and approach to science, you&rsquo;re, I think,</p>
<p>to anyone listening to this, truly inspiring. I mean, the question I think is useful to ask</p>
<p>is by way of advice for young people. A lot of young people listen to this, whether from all</p>
<p>over the world, and teenagers, undergraduate students, even graduate students, even young</p>
<p>faculty, even older faculty, they&rsquo;re all young at heart. Like there&rsquo;s many of them young at heart.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for, but let&rsquo;s focus on the traditionally defined sort of young folks that</p>
<p>kind of graduate. Do you have advice to give to young people like that today about life,</p>
<p>maybe in general, maybe a life of curiosity in the sciences?</p>
<p>Definitely. Well, first, I should confess that I enjoy working with young people much more than</p>
<p>with senior people. And the reason is they don&rsquo;t carry a baggage of prejudice. They&rsquo;re not so</p>
<p>self centered. They&rsquo;re open to exploration. My advice, I mean, one of the lessons that</p>
<p>took me a while to learn, and I should say I lost important opportunities as a result of that. So</p>
<p>I would regard it as a mistake on my behalf, was to believe experts. So, quote unquote. So on a</p>
<p>on a number of occasions, I would come up with an original idea and then suggest it to an expert,</p>
<p>someone that works in the same field for a while. And the expert would dismiss it most of the time</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s new and was not explored, not because of the merit. And then what happened to me several</p>
<p>times is that someone else would listen to the conversation or would hear me suggesting it.</p>
<p>And I would give up because the expert said no. And then that someone else would develop it so</p>
<p>that it becomes the hottest thing in this field. And once it happened to me multiple times,</p>
<p>I then realized the hell with the experts. They don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just repeating them. They don&rsquo;t think creatively. They are being threatened by innovation. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the natural reaction of someone that cares about their ego more than about the matter</p>
<p>that we are discussing. And so I said, I don&rsquo;t care how many likes I have on Twitter. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care whether the experts say one thing or another. I will basically exercise my judgment and do the</p>
<p>best I can. Turns out that I&rsquo;m wrong. I made a mistake. That&rsquo;s part of the scientific endeavor.</p>
<p>And it took me a while to recognize that. And it was a lot of wasted opportunities. So to the</p>
<p>young people, I would recommend don&rsquo;t listen to experts. Carve your own path. Now, of course,</p>
<p>you will be wrong. You should learn from experience, just like kids do. But do it yourself.</p>
<p>Your father died in 2017. Your mother died in 2019. Do you miss them?</p>
<p>Very much so.</p>
<p>Is there a memory, that fond memory that stands out? Or maybe what have you learned from them?</p>
<p>From my mother, I mean, she was very much my inspiration for pursuing intellectual work,</p>
<p>because she studied at the university. And then because of the Second World War,</p>
<p>after the Second World War, she was born in Bulgaria. They immigrated to Israel. And she</p>
<p>and she left university to work on a farm. And later in life, when all the kids left home,</p>
<p>she went back to the university and finished the PhD. But she planted in me the intellectual</p>
<p>curiosity and valuing learning or acquiring knowledge as a very important element in life.</p>
<p>And my love with philosophy came from attending classes that she took at the university.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I was fortunate to go to some of these and they inspired me later on. And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very different than my colleagues, as you can tell, because my upbringing was quite different.</p>
<p>And the only reason I&rsquo;m doing physics or astrophysics is because of circumstances.</p>
<p>At age 18, I was asked to serve in the military. And the only way for me to pursue intellectual</p>
<p>work was to work on physics, because that was the closest to philosophy. And I was good at physics.</p>
<p>So they admitted me to an elite program called LPO that allowed me to finish my PhD</p>
<p>at age 24 and to actually propose the first international project that was funded by the</p>
<p>Star Wars initiative of Ronald Reagan. And that brought me to the US to visit Washington, DC,</p>
<p>where we were funded from. And then on one of the visits, I went to the Institute for Advanced</p>
<p>Study at Princeton and met John Bacall that later offered me a five year fellowship there. Under the</p>
<p>under the condition that I&rsquo;ll switch to astrophysics. At which point, you know, I said,</p>
<p>OK, I cannot give up on this opportunity. I&rsquo;ll do it. Switch to astrophysics. It felt like a forced</p>
<p>marriage, kind of arranged marriage. And then I was offered the position at Harvard because</p>
<p>nobody wanted that. They first selected someone else. And that someone said, I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>become a junior faculty at the Harvard Astronomy Department because the chance for being promoted</p>
<p>are very small. So he took another job. And then I was second in line. They gave it to me. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care much because I could go back to the farm any day, you know. And after three years, I was</p>
<p>tenured. And eventually, a decade later, became the chair of this department and served for nine years</p>
<p>as the chair of the astronomy department at Harvard. But at that point, it became clear</p>
<p>to me that I&rsquo;m actually married to the love of my life, even though it was an arranged marriage.</p>
<p>There are many philosophical questions in astrophysics that we can address. But I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>very different than my colleagues, you know, that were focusing on technical skills in getting to</p>
<p>this job. So my mother was really extremely instrumental in planting the seeds of thinking</p>
<p>about the big picture in me. Then my father, he was, you know, he was working in the farm.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t speak much because we sort of understood each other without speaking.</p>
<p>But what he gave me is a sense of, you know, that it&rsquo;s more important to do things than to</p>
<p>talk about them. I love the, I mean, my apologies, but MIT mind and hand. I love that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that the root of philosophy that you gain from your mom and the hand, that action is all that</p>
<p>ultimately in the end matters from your dad. That&rsquo;s really powerful. If we could take a small</p>
<p>detour into philosophy, is there by chance any books, authors, whether philosophical or not,</p>
<p>you mentioned Sartre, that stand out to you that were formative in some small or big way,</p>
<p>that perhaps you would recommend to others, maybe when you were very young or maybe later on in life?</p>
<p>Well, actually, yeah, I, you know, I read the number of existentialists that</p>
<p>appealed to me because they were authentic. You know, Sartre, you know, he declined the Nobel</p>
<p>Prize, as we discussed, but he also was mocking people that pretend to be something better than</p>
<p>they are. You know, he was living an authentic life that is sincere. And that&rsquo;s what appealed to me.</p>
<p>And Albert Camus was another French philosopher that advocated existentialism. You know, that</p>
<p>really appealed to me. That&rsquo;s probably my favorite existentialist, Camus. Yeah. Yeah. And he died at</p>
<p>a young age in an accident, unfortunately. And then, you know, people like Nietzsche that, you</p>
<p>know, broke conventions. And I noticed that Nietzsche is still extremely popular. You know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s quite surprising. He appeals to the young people of today. It&rsquo;s the childlike wonder</p>
<p>about the world. And he was unapologetic. You know, it&rsquo;s like most philosophers have a very</p>
<p>strict adherence to terminology and to the practices, academic philosophers. And Nietzsche was full of</p>
<p>contradictions. And he just, I mean, he was just this big kid with opinions and thought deeply</p>
<p>about this world. And people are really attracted to that. And surprisingly, there&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>people like that throughout history of philosophy. And that&rsquo;s why I think he&rsquo;s still drawn to them.</p>
<p>Yeah. To me, what stands out is his statement that the best way to corrupt the mind of young people</p>
<p>is to tell them that they should agree with the common view, you know. And, you know, it goes back</p>
<p>to the thread that went throughout discussion. Yes. You&rsquo;ve kind of suggested that we ought to</p>
<p>be humble about our very own existence and that our existence lasts only a short time. We talked</p>
<p>about you losing your father and your mother. Do you think about your own mortality? Are you afraid</p>
<p>of death? I&rsquo;m not afraid. You know what, Epicurus, actually Epicurus was a very wise person.</p>
<p>According to Lucretius, Epicurus didn&rsquo;t leave anything in writing. But he said that he&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>afraid of death because as long as he&rsquo;s around, death is not around. And when death will be around,</p>
<p>he will not be around. So he will never meet death. So why should you be worried about something</p>
<p>you will never meet? You know, and it&rsquo;s an interesting philosophy of life. You know,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of something that you will never encounter, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a finiteness to this experience. We live every day.</p>
<p>I mean, I think if we&rsquo;re being honest, we live every day as if it&rsquo;s going to last forever.</p>
<p>We often kind of don&rsquo;t contemplate the fact that it ends. You kind of have plans and goals and you</p>
<p>have these possibilities. You have a kind of lingering thought, especially as you get older</p>
<p>and older and older, that this is, especially when you lose friends, then you start to realize,</p>
<p>you know, it does end. But I don&rsquo;t know if you really are cognizant of that. I mean,</p>
<p>because&hellip; But you have to be careful not to be depressed by it, because otherwise you lose the</p>
<p>vitality, right? So I think the most important thing to draw from knowing that you are short lived</p>
<p>is a sense of appreciation that you&rsquo;re alive. That&rsquo;s the first thing. But more importantly,</p>
<p>a sense of modesty, because how can anyone be arrogant if they kept at the same time this</p>
<p>notion that they are short lived? I mean, you cannot be arrogant, because anything that you</p>
<p>advocate for, you know, you will not be around to do that in a hundred years. So people will</p>
<p>just forget and move on, you know. And if you keep that in mind, you know, the Caesars in ancient</p>
<p>Rome, they had a person next to them telling them, don&rsquo;t forget that you are mortal. You know,</p>
<p>there was a person with that duty because the Caesars thought that they are all powerful,</p>
<p>you know. And they had, for a good reason, someone they hired to whisper in their ear,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget that you are mortal. Yeah. Well, you&rsquo;re somebody, one of the most respected,</p>
<p>famous scientists in the world, sitting on a farm, gazing up at the stars. So you seem like</p>
<p>an appropriate person to ask the completely inappropriate question of, what do you think</p>
<p>is the meaning of it all? What&rsquo;s the meaning of life? That&rsquo;s an excellent question. And if we ever</p>
<p>find an alien that we can converse with, I would like to answer this. I would like to ask for an</p>
<p>answer to this question because&hellip; Would they have a different opinion, you think? Well, they might be</p>
<p>wiser because they lived around for a while, but I&rsquo;m afraid they will be silent. I&rsquo;m afraid they</p>
<p>will not have a good answer. And I think it&rsquo;s the process that you should get satisfied by,</p>
<p>the process of learning you should enjoy. Okay, so it&rsquo;s not so much that there is a meaning.</p>
<p>In fact, there is, as far as I can tell, things just exist, you know. And I think it&rsquo;s inappropriate</p>
<p>for us to assign a meaning for our existence because, as a civilization, we will eventually</p>
<p>perish and nothing will be&hellip; Just another planet on which life died. And if you look at the big</p>
<p>scheme of things, who cares? Who cares? And how can we assign significance to what we are doing?</p>
<p>So if you said the meaning of life is this, well, it will not be around in a billion years. So</p>
<p>it cannot be the meaning of life because nothing will be around. So I think we should just enjoy</p>
<p>the process. And it&rsquo;s like many other things in life, you enjoy good food, okay? And you can enjoy</p>
<p>learning. Why? Because it makes you appreciate better the environment that you live in.</p>
<p>And sometimes people think religion, for example, is in conflict with science, spirituality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true. If you see a watch and you look at it from the outside, you might say,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s interesting. But then if you start to open it up and learn about how it works,</p>
<p>you appreciate it more. So science is the way to learn about how the world works. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not in conflict to the meaning that you assign to all of this, but it helps you appreciate the</p>
<p>world better. So in fact, I would think that a religious person should promote science because</p>
<p>it gives you a better appreciation of what&rsquo;s around you. It&rsquo;s like if you buy in a grocery,</p>
<p>buy something, a bunch of fruits that are packed together, and you can&rsquo;t see from the outside</p>
<p>exactly what kind of fruits are inside. But if you open it up and study, you appreciate better</p>
<p>the merchandise that you get, right? So you pay the same amount of money, but at least you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s inside. So why don&rsquo;t we figure out what the world is about, what the universe contains,</p>
<p>what is the dark matter? It will help us appreciate the bigger picture. And then you can assign</p>
<p>your own flavor to what it means. Ali, I think I&rsquo;m truly grateful that a person like you,</p>
<p>exists at the center of the scientific community, gives me faith and hope about this big journey</p>
<p>that we call science. So thank you for writing the book you wrote recently. You have many other books</p>
<p>and articles that I think people should definitely read. And thank you for wasting all this time with</p>
<p>me. It&rsquo;s truly an honor. Thank you so much. It was not a waste at all. And thank you for having me.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from your questions and your remarks. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this</p>
<p>conversation with Avi Loeb. And thank you to our sponsors, Zero Fasting App for intermittent</p>
<p>fasting, Element Electro Light Drink, Sun Basket Meal Delivery Service, and Pessimist Archive</p>
<p>History Podcast. So the choice is a fasting app, fasting fuel, fast breaking, delicious meals,</p>
<p>and a history podcast that has very little, as far as I know, to do with fasting. Choose wisely,</p>
<p>my friends. And if you wish, click the sponsor links below to get a discount and to support</p>
<p>this podcast. And now let me leave you some words from Albert Einstein. The important thing is not</p>
<p>to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when</p>
<p>he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough</p>
<p>if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Thank you for listening</p>
<p>and hope to see you next time.</p>
