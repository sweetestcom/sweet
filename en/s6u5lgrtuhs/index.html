Eric Berg</p><p>hi guys welcome back and Happy Holidays</p><p>if you want to call in and this is a</p><p>live show</p><p>call the number eight six six five six</p><p>one four two nine two okay so we&rsquo;re</p><p>going to talk about Keita in a minute</p><p>fasting and any other questions related</p><p>to that or related health questions so</p><p>Sherry&rsquo;s been on the line for 31 minutes</p><p>we&rsquo;re gonna go right to Sheri first</p><p>Nashville</p><p>go ahead Sheri you&rsquo;re on the line hi dr.</p><p>Berg thank you for taking my call and</p><p>thank you for everything you do to help</p><p>us my question is this I have my husband</p><p>and I have been on keto since January of</p><p>course he lost like 50 pounds in three</p><p>months of course I have of course I have</p><p>I lost I&rsquo;ve lost 65 pounds so far</p><p>that weight loss is primarily from</p><p>January of July end of July and I have</p><p>been at a complete stall since then and</p><p>hard to believe I know but I have stayed</p><p>completely on keto</p><p>we haven&rsquo;t cheated one time my goal was</p><p>to go through at least a year without</p><p>having a cheat meal or cheat day we&rsquo;ve</p><p>done that we&rsquo;ve been very faithful to it</p><p>but I&rsquo;ve been in a complete stall</p><p>I&rsquo;ve gone through countless videos of</p><p>yours and watch to try to apply and find</p><p>out what I was maybe doing wrong I did</p><p>two intermittent fasting with basically</p><p>one meal a day and I did lose I did that</p><p>for like a week and I did that where I</p><p>was just eating and mainly a one-hour</p><p>window it&rsquo;s primarily just my dinner and</p><p>then I would fast until the next dinner</p><p>the next day and I lost five pounds like</p><p>in about a week but by the end of the</p><p>week I started gaining and I was like</p><p>gaining a pound and then another pound</p><p>and I was like that was kind of</p><p>discouraging</p><p>I very at one point for a week or two</p><p>that didn&rsquo;t break it I even we were had</p><p>kind of gotten into the keto sweets and</p><p>I said well I&rsquo;m gonna cut that out</p><p>completely to see if that helped that</p><p>didn&rsquo;t even get the scale moving</p><p>even now I only have sweets maybe once a</p><p>week I&rsquo;m just I kind of like a medicine</p><p>yes let me just ask a couple questions</p><p>real fast what&rsquo;s your age I am I&rsquo;m about</p><p>52 and just in there okay are you going</p><p>through menopause or have you gone</p><p>through menopause</p><p>I had hysterectomy about in about eight</p><p>years ago so a complete hysterectomy um</p><p>yeah and I and I have been overweight my</p><p>pretty much my entire adult life off and</p><p>on diets and and this is actually the</p><p>first thing that I&rsquo;ve ever done I&rsquo;ve</p><p>never lost as much weight before and I</p><p>have never been on anything I lasted</p><p>longer than a couple of months so this</p><p>is the one thing honestly that I can</p><p>live with and I and I haven&rsquo;t cheated</p><p>because I can live with it I love the</p><p>plan and I feel better my numbers are</p><p>great the doctor was thrilled with</p><p>everything but I&rsquo;m only about a little</p><p>over a third of what I wanted to lose</p><p>and and I feel great and everything so</p><p>let me ask you a question about that as</p><p>far as your your body goes and your do</p><p>you have a lot of loose muscle or</p><p>atrophy on your body</p><p>um when you stay loose do you have like</p><p>loose skin or do you have a loss of tone</p><p>in your body do you have a lot of like</p><p>as your body um you don&rsquo;t have good tone</p><p>is that an issue I don&rsquo;t know what Sonia</p><p>is anymore to be honest with you I I</p><p>mean yeah just from being overweight I</p><p>don&rsquo;t so let me just give you some tips</p><p>okay because I&rsquo;m gonna rapidly go</p><p>through some other calls but I want to</p><p>give you some tips sharing usually in</p><p>this situation you&rsquo;re not losing weight</p><p>you really need to shift to a different</p><p>marker and indicator because everything</p><p>else is getting better so many women</p><p>when they hit menopause they have a lot</p><p>of what&rsquo;s called atrophy and that&rsquo;s a</p><p>loss of muscle and so what happens is</p><p>that they have basically the the muscle</p><p>is basically turned to fat and they just</p><p>have lost a lot of muscle density and</p><p>mass that&rsquo;s the big thing and if you</p><p>want to go get a test I think</p><p>that&rsquo;ll be very valuable just to measure</p><p>your muscle mass now as you do this</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna be healing insulin insulin</p><p>resistance so you&rsquo;re gonna start</p><p>absorbing more amino acids that&rsquo;s</p><p>protein and your weight will go up in</p><p>some cases but it&rsquo;s not fat you&rsquo;re</p><p>gaining more muscle protein so that&rsquo;s</p><p>why you can&rsquo;t really go by weight I did</p><p>a recent video on that so I would just</p><p>ride the wave and keep doing this</p><p>because you may find that you&rsquo;re gaining</p><p>weight or maintaining on muscle density</p><p>till the point where all of a sudden</p><p>that the muscles come back and then the</p><p>fat will start coming off I would</p><p>definitely add exercise in there</p><p>very lightly and gradually increase it</p><p>but if you&rsquo;re doing one meal a day there</p><p>is no way no way you&rsquo;re going to gain</p><p>fat absolutely none and if you&rsquo;re</p><p>sleeping good and and you&rsquo;re eating the</p><p>right things and not too much fat it&rsquo;s</p><p>it has to be muscle so I think it&rsquo;s</p><p>working but you&rsquo;re taking weight as the</p><p>indicator so I wouldn&rsquo;t even worry about</p><p>weight you should be shrinking in size</p><p>and you should be getting stronger but I</p><p>think what happens is you have to gain</p><p>that muscle back all right good good</p><p>point good question so we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p><p>Keaton from New Jersey go ahead Keaton</p><p>good morning doctor good morning first</p><p>of all thanks so much for all the</p><p>wonderful videos regarding my father who</p><p>is V back in India he&rsquo;s about 75 year</p><p>old and he had his bypass a in 2011 2014</p><p>onwards he started to have a uropathy in</p><p>his right leg okay and now situation is</p><p>he cannot walk Wow he doesn&rsquo;t our</p><p>diabetes he doesn&rsquo;t have a b12</p><p>deficiency the only cause I could find</p><p>is he was prescribed statin post his</p><p>bypass surgery okay happening only in</p><p>one Lake not anywhere else so I have a</p><p>question and yes it on the right leg</p><p>yeah okay all right so let me answer</p><p>this usually on the right side of your</p><p>body it&rsquo;s going to be more related to</p><p>liver and again anything that I tell you</p><p>is</p><p>entertainment it&rsquo;s not meant to diagnose</p><p>you or give you medical treatment check</p><p>with your doctor before implementing</p><p>anything but point is there side effects</p><p>from statins which affect the liver</p><p>liver enzymes and it usually will show</p><p>up on the right side and the right leg</p><p>so honestly I think I would find an</p><p>alternative there are other statins that</p><p>are less damaging and I don&rsquo;t have them</p><p>off the top of my head I think there&rsquo;s</p><p>one called pro statin that&rsquo;s a little</p><p>less and don&rsquo;t quote me on this it&rsquo;s a</p><p>little less toxic than some of the other</p><p>ones so I&rsquo;ll release a video on that</p><p>shortly but I would take Bend boat to</p><p>mean okay that&rsquo;s the type of bb1 that</p><p>actually helps with neuropathy and it</p><p>protects the nervous system it&rsquo;s the</p><p>type of b1 that you want to take in</p><p>higher dosages to help reverse</p><p>neuropathy from blood sugar issues but I</p><p>think in his case it&rsquo;s probably side</p><p>effect from the satin buddy if he has if</p><p>he&rsquo;s on statin has high cholesterol</p><p>chances are he has insulin resistance so</p><p>again been thought to mean is what you</p><p>need to get from him change the diet get</p><p>him on a keto I&rsquo;m sure in India they</p><p>don&rsquo;t have a lot of carbs they don&rsquo;t eat</p><p>a lot of rice and I&rsquo;m being very</p><p>sarcastic all right thanks Kevin</p><p>let&rsquo;s go to Karen Karen do we have any</p><p>questions well good morning and happy</p><p>holiday yes we have questions a couple</p><p>here on menopause premenopause and hot</p><p>flashes can the keto diet help that well</p><p>when you go on a ketogenic diet it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s what what&rsquo;s happening is you&rsquo;re</p><p>switching from diesel fuel to electric</p><p>fuel in your body if you can just</p><p>imagine you&rsquo;re doing this conversion and</p><p>so it&rsquo;s going to take a huge stress off</p><p>the adrenals which usually what you need</p><p>is a really happy and healthy adrenals</p><p>as you go through menopause and the fact</p><p>that when you go through menopause the</p><p>ovaries go in retirement the adrenal</p><p>backs up the ovaries so that&rsquo;s going to</p><p>be pumping out way too much cortisol and</p><p>then that&rsquo;s when you have symptoms like</p><p>hot flashes so if your Drina &rsquo;ls are</p><p>healthier and that is you know tired you</p><p>will have a less symptom so yes the keto</p><p>and in fasting is the absolute best</p><p>thing but I will say some</p><p>go in the Quito in him in the</p><p>fascinating your period shuts off and so</p><p>that&rsquo;s a little bit of a shift in</p><p>hormones and I&rsquo;m gonna do a video on</p><p>that but that wasn&rsquo;t the question so I&rsquo;m</p><p>not going to answer that question you</p><p>have one another shortened question</p><p>Karen sure I have a question here what</p><p>would cause a white tongue and ken kitto</p><p>or intermittent fasting help it</p><p>well white tongue is up the yeast</p><p>candida too much overgrowth in your body</p><p>and that&rsquo;s really a systemic internal</p><p>issue that you need to start working on</p><p>your digestion probiotics I would do</p><p>sauerkraut I would do some good healthy</p><p>probiotic that you would take and then</p><p>avoid sugar which would which is the</p><p>ketogenic diet it&rsquo;s a low carbohydrate</p><p>diet that&rsquo;s going to help you and the</p><p>other thing is when you do in a minute</p><p>fasting Karen yes you actually put your</p><p>body into this condition was called a</p><p>tapa G okay and that means it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>like thinking about your you have a</p><p>recycling unit in your house of taking</p><p>the garbage and recycling it and going</p><p>into healthy and new raw material well</p><p>that&rsquo;s the Tov G and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p><p>triggered within a minute fasting so one</p><p>of the things that it recycles is</p><p>Candida yeast fungus mold and viruses so</p><p>you can clean all that up when you</p><p>determine fasting better than doing the</p><p>six meals a day so that&rsquo;s my answer and</p><p>also you can take some grapefruit seed</p><p>extract to help also speed up the</p><p>results now let&rsquo;s go to Frank in Seattle</p><p>he has a question about b1 go ahead</p><p>Frank</p><p>hey dr. enjoy your videos seems like you</p><p>might run out of videos ya know I&rsquo;m</p><p>running into a capacitor where I don&rsquo;t</p><p>have anything else to say so hopefully I</p><p>can get some other questions right right</p><p>umm I liked your video of your video on</p><p>the liquids he could drink but uh I went</p><p>to this one website for insulin the</p><p>insulin index you know and they had gin</p><p>is actually being the number one louis</p><p>insulin on</p><p>neck&rsquo;s gin yeah gin okay but so the big</p><p>one is the one hours away how much</p><p>should I take on a daily basis good</p><p>question</p><p>so as far as the gin don&rsquo;t take any more</p><p>than five eight shot glasses per day no</p><p>no the problem with the gin is yes it&rsquo;s</p><p>low in the glare the insulin index but</p><p>it&rsquo;s a solvent which shuts down the</p><p>liver which then creates a whole other</p><p>problem problems with ketosis and health</p><p>and regeneration it basically kills</p><p>liver cells but yeah it&rsquo;s low in the</p><p>glycan insulin index but you&rsquo;ve killed a</p><p>liver off so you have to weigh out what</p><p>would be the advantage of that</p><p>I think the Keela is a lot better no</p><p>just kidding be one you want to get that</p><p>a nutritional yeast that&rsquo;s the best</p><p>source you want a natural version you</p><p>don&rsquo;t want the synthetic unless you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing a detox as far as quantities go</p><p>you don&rsquo;t have to do the mega dosage if</p><p>you do food base or nutritional yeast</p><p>you can absorb it much better and use</p><p>smaller dosages so what I would do is I</p><p>would do either three tablespoons of</p><p>nutritional yeast a day or six tablets</p><p>of nutritional yeast today I have one in</p><p>a tablet form that is non fortified and</p><p>it has some natural b12 I like it but</p><p>you have to cut it in half and and</p><p>swallow it or because the pills are kind</p><p>of big or chew a little bit and swallow</p><p>it we&rsquo;re changing that we&rsquo;re working on</p><p>it yes IP so progress</p><p>yeah thanks Frank all right we&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>go to Karen for one more question okay</p><p>good so Kay is asking oh no I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>it&rsquo;s Faye Faye is asking she says I&rsquo;ve</p><p>lost weight on the keto diet and she</p><p>feels better is it okay to go back on to</p><p>some carbs on a moderate basis like</p><p>sweet potatoes grains fruits that&rsquo;s a</p><p>really really good question because</p><p>people did she mention like she hit her</p><p>target or something and she doesn&rsquo;t say</p><p>she just says she&rsquo;s feeling better but</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s that like keto is the</p><p>solution versus the lifestyle so so we</p><p>got to look at</p><p>you know people want to achieve a</p><p>weight-loss goal they want to achieve a</p><p>cognitive goal if you go back to the</p><p>carbs you&rsquo;re no longer gonna be in</p><p>ketosis and the benefits of anti-aging</p><p>of neuroprotection regrowing brain cells</p><p>and heart cells and all these things go</p><p>away so it&rsquo;s really if your goal is just</p><p>to kind of maintain a certain level of</p><p>existence that&rsquo;s fine if if you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have a blood sugar issue maybe you hit</p><p>your weight some people can do it I</p><p>would what I would rather you do is do</p><p>go ahead and go off the program see how</p><p>you feel and then go back on the program</p><p>and you decide what is better for you</p><p>and that way you prove it to yourself</p><p>it&rsquo;s really for me it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s going</p><p>back to what we originally did our</p><p>ancestors are did not eat five meals a</p><p>day they had maybe one or two meals if</p><p>they&rsquo;re lucky that&rsquo;s just kind of what</p><p>we&rsquo;re going back to what our bodies were</p><p>designed to do and our bodies were</p><p>designed not to consume all these carbs</p><p>so we&rsquo;re just kind of going back to that</p><p>and and that apparently works good for</p><p>our bodies so you&rsquo;re gonna actually</p><p>achieve a level of health that&rsquo;s a lot</p><p>higher on the carbs let&rsquo;s go to Larry</p><p>from Indiana hey Larry yes hi hello</p><p>there</p><p>hi did you have a question okay I&rsquo;m 65</p><p>years old and I&rsquo;m going to the gym seven</p><p>days a week using a treadmill for 30</p><p>minutes and the speed is three point</p><p>seven miles per hour and I&rsquo;m trying to</p><p>lose belly fat and build muscle okay</p><p>good</p><p>it&rsquo;s a great question Larry so exercise</p><p>is responsible for about 15% of your</p><p>weight loss exercise okay the type of</p><p>exercise that&rsquo;s going to really produce</p><p>that 15% would not be thirty minutes at</p><p>the gym because at that intensity you</p><p>might tap out your your sugar reserve</p><p>but you won&rsquo;t really do burn much fat</p><p>from that you would</p><p>to do high intense short duration lots</p><p>of rests full-body workouts the</p><p>treadmill thing really is insignificant</p><p>in fact you could even pick it up and</p><p>workout for three hours and burn like</p><p>seven or 800 calories and no weight loss</p><p>nothing so the benefit of exercise</p><p>occurs later after when you&rsquo;re sleeping</p><p>because you trigger certain hormones but</p><p>I&rsquo;m just gonna explain something the</p><p>diet is responsible for about 85% that&rsquo;s</p><p>like this significant part of weight</p><p>loss so you&rsquo;re not going to lose a lot</p><p>of weight an exercise if at all</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re doing a little too</p><p>many carbs if any carbs a glass of wine</p><p>will pretty much ruin your workout half</p><p>of a donut will do the same so I would</p><p>take my keto and immanent fasting course</p><p>I have a new course in a minute fast and</p><p>it just came out that you can find where</p><p>can you find that Karen well if you&rsquo;re</p><p>on Facebook live you just type in the</p><p>word basics basics and you will</p><p>automatically get it for you YouTube</p><p>users I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s a link</p><p>down there I haven&rsquo;t tested yes there is</p><p>a link down there</p><p>good there&rsquo;s a link down there okay good</p><p>and you can click that but that&rsquo;s what I</p><p>think you need is the basics and I think</p><p>if you do a search on exercise that</p><p>would help you I did some videos on that</p><p>it might be hard to find but that&rsquo;s a</p><p>really good point though with the</p><p>exercise you&rsquo;re not gonna see a lot of</p><p>results with your belly fat loss but you</p><p>will if you do keto in a minute fasting</p><p>like massive so thanks for your question</p><p>Larry I appreciate that let&rsquo;s go to</p><p>Derek New York you&rsquo;re from New York</p><p>right you had a question yes good</p><p>morning dr. Berg how are you a morning</p><p>great on behalf of so many people that I</p><p>know who watch your videos and follow</p><p>you we just want to say thank you for</p><p>all your videos and all your help dr.</p><p>Berg I have a it&rsquo;s something a little</p><p>bit off topic although I have lost about</p><p>40 pounds within the past two months</p><p>I got misdiagnosed with a hiatal hernia</p><p>and due to being diagnosed with that I</p><p>stopped I steered away from many</p><p>foods and I was working out in the gym</p><p>as well this caused me to lose a</p><p>significant amount of weight so two</p><p>months ago I took a ultrasound and my</p><p>gallbladder this is a gallbladder</p><p>question by the way my gallbladder was</p><p>fine and then I took I took another</p><p>ultrasound along with a hiatus again</p><p>just this week and there was some they</p><p>found some sludge and my gallbladder is</p><p>now working at only 49% and I have all</p><p>the symptoms that you mentioned with I</p><p>have bloating I&rsquo;ve had chronic</p><p>constipation</p><p>I have excess gas excess trapped gas and</p><p>I go to these doctors and they really</p><p>you know they really don&rsquo;t help me in</p><p>any sense I&rsquo;ve been seen many doctors</p><p>and I&rsquo;m just trying to alleviate this</p><p>problem before before it gets any worse</p><p>yeah okay well good good question let me</p><p>just cover that I think you&rsquo;re on the</p><p>right track if you&rsquo;re doing Aikido and</p><p>in a minute fasting especially because</p><p>when you don&rsquo;t eat it gives the</p><p>gallbladder a chance to rest and recover</p><p>and build up the concentration of bile</p><p>that you need to be normal again so when</p><p>you have sludge in the gallbladder</p><p>that&rsquo;s really a deficiency of bile and</p><p>it creates some you can create</p><p>gallstones you can create just a buildup</p><p>of some some crud in there and so what</p><p>you want to do is you want to build up</p><p>your bile reserve you could even take</p><p>bile salts as a supplement after the</p><p>meal which I think might help you</p><p>initially with the bloating but</p><p>ultimately you need to go exactly on the</p><p>program that I talked about in the and</p><p>the book here which is a lot of</p><p>vegetables because that&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>important in the liver and getting the</p><p>liver cleaned out and then also not</p><p>eating as frequent moderate amount of</p><p>protein and you&rsquo;re not going to be have</p><p>a problem with eating saturated fats</p><p>because that&rsquo;s going to stimulate the</p><p>gallbladder to release now there&rsquo;s one</p><p>last thing I think it&rsquo;ll be good I just</p><p>don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re going to find this</p><p>other than doing this do a search with</p><p>dr. Berg and then gallbladder flush</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s gallbladder flush</p><p>and there&rsquo;s some techniques in there</p><p>that I think you will really love</p><p>because in this situation you got sludge</p><p>it&rsquo;s not performing it&rsquo;s all probably</p><p>backed up it&rsquo;s creating bloating</p><p>there&rsquo;s submit like manual work that you</p><p>can do by massaging the gallbladder the</p><p>pancreas to kind of keep the flows</p><p>opening up as you start improving such</p><p>the situation so search the videos and</p><p>you would use the massage tool to kind</p><p>of work that out but also you want to do</p><p>the opposite side but that&rsquo;s what I</p><p>would do Derek thanks for the question</p><p>we&rsquo;re gonna go to Karen for another</p><p>question good I think this is on the</p><p>same path Jay Taylor is asking about</p><p>right shoulder pain and right hand hand</p><p>numbness and I know you know the answer</p><p>to this because I had the same thing</p><p>well the gallbladder is connected to the</p><p>diaphragm sort of it&rsquo;s redder Neath hair</p><p>and there&rsquo;s a little nerve that goes</p><p>bones connect yeah exactly goes up to</p><p>the right side goes up to the third</p><p>cervical vertebra in your neck but you</p><p>have at that if this thing gets flared</p><p>up it can aggravate the nerve and it&rsquo;s</p><p>flared up the gall bladder oh and it can</p><p>actually cause anything on the right</p><p>side in fact if you look at referred</p><p>pain on the right scapula this little</p><p>muscle up here on the right trap even up</p><p>in the headaches and the shoulder that&rsquo;s</p><p>all gall bladder referred so here you</p><p>are massaging this it&rsquo;s kind of like</p><p>when you step on the dog&rsquo;s tail Karen</p><p>where does he bark not out of the tail</p><p>exactly so you want to work on the gall</p><p>bladder and all of a sudden all this</p><p>clears up I had a problem with my right</p><p>shoulder pain for about 12 years didn&rsquo;t</p><p>know is the gall bladder until I started</p><p>to focus on it so I do have some videos</p><p>on that but the keto intermittent</p><p>fasting is really important you probably</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to do massive amounts of fat</p><p>and the keto bums which are the little</p><p>fat cookies on this but intermittent</p><p>fasting is gonna be important huge</p><p>amount of vegetables if you do the keto</p><p>with low months of vegetables I think</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a problem with the</p><p>gallbladder so you&rsquo;ve got to keep your</p><p>vegetables high and I also recommend</p><p>gallbladder formula if anyone has gone</p><p>better symptoms especially if they don&rsquo;t</p><p>have a gallbladder because that will</p><p>actually assist in the bloating increase</p><p>more bile okay</p><p>so so now we&rsquo;re going to go to Nicole</p><p>you had a question you&rsquo;re from Michigan</p><p>go ahead yes more so about the white</p><p>side of my face and my hair it seems</p><p>that I have more hair coming out of the</p><p>right side I have these weird freckle</p><p>spots coming onto my cheek some rosacea</p><p>I just don&rsquo;t know why the right side of</p><p>my face is doing worse than my last day</p><p>yeah so how old are you Nicole I&rsquo;m 31 31</p><p>tell me about your menstrual cycle is it</p><p>heavy is it irregular do you have any</p><p>issues with your cycle no it&rsquo;s</p><p>consistent it&rsquo;s not too much on the</p><p>heavy side I would say normal okay</p><p>yeah okay so if you&rsquo;re having acne on</p><p>one side of your face and here growth</p><p>and this is just my opinion just from</p><p>working with a lot of people I&rsquo;ve</p><p>noticed that I would check the ovary</p><p>function and I have some videos and some</p><p>natural things you can do for</p><p>menstruation and things like that but</p><p>it&rsquo;s interesting you have the left and</p><p>right side of the ovary and they</p><p>reciprocate one month one ovary works</p><p>the next month the other ovary works so</p><p>if there is more acne on one side of</p><p>your face every other month do we know</p><p>that&rsquo;s the situation and don&rsquo;t ask me</p><p>why this occurs I just notice it so</p><p>that&rsquo;s my my thing that I would do is</p><p>see if you can improve the ovary</p><p>function I have some videos on it</p><p>there&rsquo;s an eating plan for the ovarian</p><p>body type and I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s</p><p>your body type you can research research</p><p>that in my book I have a lot of data on</p><p>that one tip on that is make sure that</p><p>you do organic foods do not do</p><p>commercial anything because you want to</p><p>do do without the hormones and the food</p><p>supply without the pesticides</p><p>insecticides and all those things</p><p>because that that&rsquo;s the worst thing for</p><p>the ovary that you can do and even if</p><p>you have facial hair in general</p><p>regardless where it is that could be</p><p>something called PCOS which is high</p><p>insulin it&rsquo;s the same thing so get on</p><p>the keto and in a minute fasting and I</p><p>think you&rsquo;ll be happy</p><p>all right pick me pick me you have we</p><p>have so many good questions here I just</p><p>see this one right here I have to ask</p><p>okay it just flipped up I&rsquo;m gonna ask</p><p>this one from Tiffany first she is</p><p>feeling great she&rsquo;s been on keto for</p><p>about six weeks she asks how long will</p><p>she be doing keto before she can see a</p><p>difference in the fatty liver okay so</p><p>there&rsquo;s a couple things you should see</p><p>some results within a few months with</p><p>the fatty liver and you can go back and</p><p>get an ultrasound to see that but you</p><p>have to make sure that your vegetables</p><p>are about about eight to ten cups a day</p><p>because all this fat that&rsquo;s coming out</p><p>has to go through the liver so you want</p><p>to keep that thing flushed but I would</p><p>recommend adding to this whole program</p><p>choline you can get it in a supplement</p><p>it&rsquo;s in a powder form and take that</p><p>every single day</p><p>whatever&rsquo;s recommended on the and the</p><p>powder form because that&rsquo;ll speed up the</p><p>fat coming out of your liver</p><p>tremendously okay one more question can</p><p>I get two more questions because I found</p><p>this one you know sometimes it flips up</p><p>and then I lose it and how can I find it</p><p>okay so we have I think it&rsquo;s ro Heath</p><p>Rajah here he says tell me the truth he</p><p>only wants the truth dr. burgher about</p><p>cartilage regeneration by eating right</p><p>well I don&rsquo;t honestly I don&rsquo;t think</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna regenerate Carlos by eating</p><p>cartilage and that&rsquo;s just one point and</p><p>then the second point I&rsquo;m gonna make is</p><p>that the cartilage is a type of protein</p><p>that usually wears out when you&rsquo;re when</p><p>there&rsquo;s more inflammation in the body</p><p>and that&rsquo;s why in a diabetic situation</p><p>you lose a lot of protein protein tends</p><p>to in the muscle and the joint and you</p><p>have inflammation so as far as the diet</p><p>goes you want to do the Kino because</p><p>that cuts the carve-out which instantly</p><p>improves insulin resistance which will</p><p>then allow you to absorb more proteins</p><p>to build back up the joint the other</p><p>thing that&rsquo;s even more powerful is in a</p><p>minute fasting because that will</p><p>stimulate growth hormone which helps</p><p>build up cartilage by 2,000 percent</p><p>I mean exercise will only increase</p><p>growth home and by 450 percent so if you</p><p>were debt added them and fasting to this</p><p>you would end up with a lot better</p><p>joints all right good point one more</p><p>question I have I&rsquo;m stealing it I&rsquo;m</p><p>hogging it</p><p>Facebook Joyce asks what to do to tone</p><p>muscle and to handle loose skin are they</p><p>the same thing</p><p>well the the toning of the skin you you</p><p>can&rsquo;t do it without exercise you need to</p><p>do it exercise you have to be working</p><p>that but the tone the toning of the skin</p><p>happens when you increase growth hormone</p><p>and you lower cortisol so we have to</p><p>reduce stress gotta sleep better and</p><p>increase growth form on the two things</p><p>that well there&rsquo;s more things that sugar</p><p>growth hormone but in a minute fasting</p><p>is the most powerful second is exercise</p><p>high intensity lots of rest don&rsquo;t</p><p>overtrain and also sleep is going to be</p><p>important avoiding carbohydrates a lot</p><p>of Sun especially in the winter take</p><p>vitamin D and those are just some tips</p><p>that you can do alright so let&rsquo;s go to</p><p>Diana from Texas you to question Diana</p><p>hello hi I&rsquo;m here for your question I</p><p>started keto and I beat those machine</p><p>scans that tells you like your muscle</p><p>mass and your way and all this stuff so</p><p>I did them and I took the numbers down</p><p>and I compared to yesterday and</p><p>apparently everything was like almost</p><p>like a million pounds I gained muscle</p><p>mass I lost fat on my business I went</p><p>from a seven to a club yes I want to</p><p>know what happened so who did the test</p><p>what test was it do you remember what it</p><p>was it like an impedance test or a body</p><p>composition</p><p>well it just um a machine that you hold</p><p>with your hands like yeah it&rsquo;s like yeah</p><p>it&rsquo;s nothing big but I don&rsquo;t know people</p><p>saying that shows the numbers and he&rsquo;s</p><p>like yeah I&rsquo;ve had one of those machines</p><p>once it&rsquo;s still at my garage those are</p><p>not accurate</p><p>I would not use that as indication they</p><p>don&rsquo;t work okay I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>yeah I think you&rsquo;re doing great go by</p><p>your size there are I mean if you really</p><p>want to know do an ultrasound</p><p>but those impedance tests when you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing the hand held things I don&rsquo;t like</p><p>them okay let&rsquo;s go to Leanne say hello</p><p>say what you mean exactly I won&rsquo;t beat</p><p>around the bush Liam you had a question</p><p>about adding chlorella go ahead dr. Berg</p><p>hi how are you hello hi very good thank</p><p>you I wanted to ask you a question about</p><p>chlorella but if you don&rsquo;t mind I wanted</p><p>to share a little bit about my journey</p><p>and June of this year I decided I was</p><p>going to change my life and 32 years old</p><p>and since then I&rsquo;ve lost about 70 pounds</p><p>a few inches from my waist I religiously</p><p>follow your advice I huge salads every</p><p>day I was sugar addicted I wake up in</p><p>the morning to three o&rsquo;clock in the</p><p>morning and I go and grab a spoonful of</p><p>Nutella you know I would wake up with</p><p>agonizing heel pain wasn&rsquo;t until a</p><p>couple days ago I was chatting with a</p><p>friend talking about my progress and he</p><p>was talking about how he&rsquo;d wake up and</p><p>had these terrible pains in his feet and</p><p>I was like oh my god I haven&rsquo;t felt that</p><p>pain in days and for the last couple</p><p>days I&rsquo;ve woken up and paid attention</p><p>and I just don&rsquo;t even feel it anymore</p><p>every day I&rsquo;m taking milk thistle</p><p>tumeric apple cider vinegar ginger of</p><p>lemon take apple cider vinegar and water</p><p>before every meal I&rsquo;m taking nutritional</p><p>yeast and making kale shakes multiple</p><p>times a week so kale spinach ginger</p><p>tumeric blueberry water I feel amazing</p><p>I&rsquo;ve got three small hernias that I&rsquo;ve</p><p>got to get fixed some ultrasounds</p><p>essentially I just let my life slip away</p><p>I&rsquo;m an entrepreneur I own a business</p><p>here in canada ottawa and when i just</p><p>sort of focused on everything except for</p><p>myself and you know really focused on</p><p>creating employment for people and</p><p>anyway it&rsquo;s been amazing to listen to</p><p>you and learn from you at the same time</p><p>I learned about my hernias I learned</p><p>about a fatty liver and I didn&rsquo;t really</p><p>know how to manage that so I simply</p><p>YouTubed fatty liver and</p><p>you came up and essentially since then</p><p>that&rsquo;s early October I have been I</p><p>watched several of your videos every</p><p>single day both you and Karen last night</p><p>I had a really good time watching the</p><p>video when you&rsquo;re with the leaf blower</p><p>trying to get that shot the the recipe</p><p>is up that was pretty funny anyway I</p><p>just I loved everything you guys do I</p><p>think your mission in life is really</p><p>inspiring and it&rsquo;s extremely powerful</p><p>and the way you empower people by giving</p><p>them information that they can then use</p><p>I mean essentially just learning that I</p><p>have to control insulin as like one of</p><p>the single most important factors for me</p><p>has given me extreme clarity and focus</p><p>with what I need to do with every</p><p>decision I make when it comes to eating</p><p>you should come here and do the show</p><p>basically that&rsquo;s great great everybody</p><p>else who&rsquo;s watching everybody else who&rsquo;s</p><p>listening should just listen to him</p><p>because he&rsquo;s applying it and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s</p><p>not doing anything else but applying it</p><p>and how amazing is that</p><p>I mean accolades are to you for for</p><p>doing your homework in flying and that&rsquo;s</p><p>really it&rsquo;s really like the the single</p><p>most thing to focus on is that insulin</p><p>that&rsquo;s like behind almost so many</p><p>conditions so that&rsquo;s awesome thank you</p><p>and then you had a question about it</p><p>chlorella right yeah so basically you</p><p>know I sort of gone through the rabbit</p><p>hole of some of these videos and some</p><p>really sketchy guy started talking about</p><p>you know wheatgrass only has this much</p><p>chlorophyll and you need the superfood</p><p>chlorella and you know look it up I</p><p>bought some from the grocery store I put</p><p>it in some water a couple times and then</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tried looking for more information</p><p>obviously it&rsquo;s got a lot of chlorophyll</p><p>but then there&rsquo;s people out that are</p><p>saying like well it&rsquo;s going to give you</p><p>like iodine problems if you got thyroid</p><p>issues I don&rsquo;t think I have one but then</p><p>heavy-metal issues I don&rsquo;t know so I&rsquo;m</p><p>just sort of like yeah wondering if it&rsquo;s</p><p>something that could be beneficial and I</p><p>know it&rsquo;s like something that it seems</p><p>like like you haven&rsquo;t I know you&rsquo;ve</p><p>touched on it a little bit in some</p><p>videos but just wondering what your</p><p>general stops are let me give you a</p><p>sense on that I used to take chlorella</p><p>the problem is after about a couple of</p><p>months and I&rsquo;m not</p><p>this is gonna happen everyone it it</p><p>tends to be a powerful key leader so it</p><p>pulls it detoxifies and I started</p><p>noticing dark circles on these my eyes I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t like that so I think it&rsquo;s good</p><p>short term happened with me maybe it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t happen with other people as far</p><p>as chlorophyll in the wheat grass</p><p>there&rsquo;s different levels of chlorophyll</p><p>and different types of wheatgrass I</p><p>actually took my wheatgrass and I</p><p>measured independently with a certain</p><p>lab how much chlorophyll is in the</p><p>wheatgrass because it&rsquo;s grown on I flew</p><p>to the farm when they grow it and it&rsquo;s</p><p>just off the charts compared to the</p><p>three other companies that are the top</p><p>around I&rsquo;m not going to mention names</p><p>their chlorophyll levels and ours were</p><p>like way higher and I posted this on the</p><p>website under the wheatgrass so it has</p><p>massive quantities of chlorophyll and a</p><p>lot of other phytonutrients that are</p><p>very powerful so I think it&rsquo;s awesome I</p><p>think I&rsquo;m gonna stick with wheatgrass</p><p>juice powder chlorella it&rsquo;s a bit of a</p><p>detox thing I do not believe the</p><p>chlorella has more chlorophyll but I</p><p>can&rsquo;t tell you you know exactly but</p><p>thanks Leigh appreciate it we&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>go to Connie from California go ahead</p><p>Connie hi dr. Berg thank you for all</p><p>your videos they&rsquo;ve been really</p><p>wonderful for my husband he&rsquo;s lost 80</p><p>pounds he&rsquo;s been on the keto since May</p><p>Wow that&rsquo;s it I know it&rsquo;s wonderful</p><p>he&rsquo;s gotten what kind of a little stall</p><p>but he&rsquo;s having an issue with the right</p><p>side of his back between the waist and</p><p>under the shoulder blade with a pain and</p><p>night yeah is that cause from something</p><p>he&rsquo;s eating no that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s well it</p><p>could be but it&rsquo;s the gallbladder okay</p><p>so okay watch some of my videos in the</p><p>gallbladder but here&rsquo;s what you need to</p><p>do do in a minute fasting for sure it</p><p>could be all this fat coming through</p><p>these might have to cut down the fat a</p><p>little bit increase the vegetables and</p><p>you can do the acupressure on the</p><p>gallbladder as well and that pain should</p><p>go away really fast but right where you</p><p>said in the back part on the inside of</p><p>the scapula that&rsquo;s where the gallbladder</p><p>rule for a pain to so that&rsquo;s all it is</p><p>so yeah make those changes and should go</p><p>away pretty quick all right Karen you</p><p>have another question yes I do</p><p>Anthony is asking this is a good point</p><p>it seems to come up he&rsquo;s doing keto he&rsquo;s</p><p>lost all the weight he wants to lose he</p><p>realizes that the keto lifestyle is a</p><p>good one but how does he maintain that</p><p>without losing more weight what do you</p><p>do so this is always a trick because</p><p>here you are doing keto and fasting</p><p>which is going to it&rsquo;s running your body</p><p>on fat so you&rsquo;re going to lose fat and</p><p>get pretty lean and that is the problem</p><p>with this program you get too lean so</p><p>the only thing you can do at this point</p><p>is add in exercise more weights more</p><p>full-body less reps at the same time you</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to add the carbs in you want</p><p>to add more fat but the problem is how</p><p>you going to digest that fat so you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have to have maybe add some</p><p>violets aport gallbladder formula more</p><p>apple cider vinegar and then what you</p><p>can do is start to make sure that your</p><p>fat in the meal is higher and higher and</p><p>higher do it slowly</p><p>to the point where now your body is</p><p>burning a lot of the dietary fat as</p><p>compared to only okay that&rsquo;s the secret</p><p>all right so now we&rsquo;re oh ma</p><p>to no avail like my body is just</p><p>resisting it I was getting more toned</p><p>but now I start to see some sagging even</p><p>working out is not doing it for me and</p><p>I&rsquo;m just wondering what I&rsquo;m doing wrong</p><p>because I must be some kind of</p><p>correlation there I even tried to take</p><p>the supplement for adrenal support that</p><p>I got well the first thing I want to say</p><p>is that yeah when I think about Oklahoma</p><p>Oklahoma came through in in high school</p><p>that came through as a wrestling team</p><p>and wrestled our team and beat every</p><p>single one of us in the first match</p><p>pinned everyone so you guys have a</p><p>incredible wrestling team but on your</p><p>question there&rsquo;s a couple things that</p><p>you want to do</p><p>it&rsquo;s that after you have losses and you</p><p>know your your children that can create</p><p>a lot of stress in the body and higher</p><p>cortisol levels and I think what I would</p><p>do is support the adrenals with the</p><p>electrolyte and the nutritional yeast</p><p>tablets those too because that&rsquo;s going</p><p>to give you the unfair advantage of</p><p>started putting your body back in</p><p>ketosis but I think your issue is the</p><p>adrenal and also if you look up adrenal</p><p>stress and acupressure with this tool I</p><p>show you step-by-step of how to walk</p><p>through to pull the stress out of your</p><p>body to enhance sleep and pull stress</p><p>out that&rsquo;s the thing I think that&rsquo;s kind</p><p>of kicking your butt you said that</p><p>you&rsquo;re trying one meal a day which is</p><p>which is good but you might have a hard</p><p>time because cortisol releases sugar</p><p>okay it turns your muscles into sugar so</p><p>you&rsquo;re hitting your your problem really</p><p>is coming from the cortisol so you got</p><p>to handle the adrenal and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p><p>another thing that can stop you from</p><p>getting into ketosis so that&rsquo;s what I</p><p>would do you go on long walks lots of</p><p>space</p><p>low stress and try to get more sleep</p><p>thanks tomorrow that&rsquo;s the demand I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry Karen you had a question I do</p><p>Angelique</p><p>here on YouTube says that I&rsquo;m she&rsquo;s</p><p>having an issue with alopecia and some</p><p>constipation are those related and kinky</p><p>toe help</p><p>well alopecia usually can be it can be a</p><p>thyroid issue but it&rsquo;s an autoimmune of</p><p>the hair and so one of the best remedies</p><p>for that is selenium and then add some</p><p>seek help but I think there&rsquo;s usually an</p><p>underlying adrenal issue</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry underlying thyroid issue that</p><p>usually even happens when you have</p><p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s as well I don&rsquo;t know if</p><p>that&rsquo;s what you have but the other thing</p><p>that I would really watch out for is</p><p>anything with glyphosate which is a</p><p>herbicide it&rsquo;s in the GMO foods so make</p><p>sure you do all organic to eliminate</p><p>that because that can trigger issues</p><p>with autoimmune and also thyroid issues</p><p>and then lastly if you do the keto in a</p><p>minute fasting that takes a big stress</p><p>off the immune system and that will also</p><p>help your hair as well but it&rsquo;s not just</p><p>a matter of taking vitamins just really</p><p>got a hint and support the immune system</p><p>okay</p><p>hey juror you&rsquo;re from Dallas you had a</p><p>question about supplements for extended</p><p>fasting yes hey I&rsquo;ve been doing the 16-8</p><p>intermittent fasting working towards the</p><p>24 and have tried a couple of the you</p><p>know 24-hour fast recently tried a</p><p>36-hour fast and but from reading on</p><p>some other websites and so forth and had</p><p>a little bit of I guess dehydration</p><p>maybe from doing that so I kind of had</p><p>two part question was is 23 hours for</p><p>the the optimum spot for fasting or is</p><p>there a point of diminishing returns</p><p>after that yeah and if you&rsquo;re on if you</p><p>are fasting whether it&rsquo;s 23 hours or</p><p>longer are there some non-food</p><p>supplements that you could do you know</p><p>stayed off dehydration yeah</p><p>good question so</p><p>first of all there&rsquo;s a sweet spot for</p><p>results and and then it tends to plateau</p><p>a little bit okay but you still will</p><p>improve it&rsquo;s between 18 to 24 hours</p><p>that&rsquo;s the sweet spot so if you can get</p><p>anywhere between there and closer you</p><p>know I think if you were to do I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know a three or four hour window and</p><p>that would be really good or maybe even</p><p>a two hour window that would be a little</p><p>bit better but then after that you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna kind of level off a little bit so</p><p>and I&rsquo;m talking about the amount of</p><p>hours that you&rsquo;re going to be fasting</p><p>without eating now as far as supplements</p><p>go the two supplements that I always</p><p>recommend to do this would be the</p><p>electrolyte mix that has enough</p><p>potassium magnesium calcium trace</p><p>minerals without the sugar won&rsquo;t no</p><p>multi dextran because you need that to</p><p>actually support this machine there&rsquo;s</p><p>these new machines that are burning fat</p><p>and also B vitamins in the form of</p><p>nutritional yeast and I have something</p><p>called nutritional yeast tablets that</p><p>are really effective because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>unfortified it doesn&rsquo;t have the</p><p>synthetics plus I added two b12 so those</p><p>two together are like essential okay but</p><p>here&rsquo;s the other point when you go into</p><p>a tappa gene which your body is</p><p>recycling and it&rsquo;s adapting to this not</p><p>eating you actually preserve nutrients</p><p>your body starts holding on to nutrients</p><p>a little bit more so you don&rsquo;t have to</p><p>worry as much as you think about dumping</p><p>a ton of nutrients in the body because</p><p>your body is adapting you would think</p><p>that because you&rsquo;re not eating you&rsquo;re</p><p>starving and you&rsquo;re gonna lose a lot of</p><p>nutrients but that&rsquo;s not what really</p><p>what happens as long as the meals that</p><p>you eat our nutrient dense and you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting roughly what you need you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna be totally fine okay because</p><p>there&rsquo;s this adaptation mechanism all</p><p>right all right now let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go</p><p>over to Karen I have some cool questions</p><p>here and I hope I pronounced this right</p><p>yamagishi says what does your body do</p><p>with fats when you&rsquo;re on a high carb</p><p>diet</p><p>yeah so when you&rsquo;re in a high carb diet</p><p>the body will always as the priority</p><p>burn those carbs it will not burn fat</p><p>and that&rsquo;s a little switch it&rsquo;s like a</p><p>little mechanism in order to burn fat</p><p>you have to lower carb so if you add</p><p>both fat and sugar to the diet first of</p><p>all you&rsquo;re gonna exaggerate insulin even</p><p>more than if you ate them separately</p><p>secondly you&rsquo;re not going to burn the</p><p>fat you can only burn the carbon that&rsquo;s</p><p>the way that&rsquo;s the body has this</p><p>priority system so what does it do with</p><p>the fat then it probably puts a distort</p><p>just as additional fat I&rsquo;m sorry that&rsquo;s</p><p>sad</p><p>yeah okay I have another question okay</p><p>what okay well Flora&rsquo;s asking can she</p><p>take more than one scoop of the</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder every day even</p><p>though she&rsquo;s on intermittent fasting and</p><p>would that break the fast yeah and this</p><p>is a this is a question I just did a</p><p>video on it know you could</p><p>you&rsquo;re not gonna stimulate insulin when</p><p>you&rsquo;re on the wheatgrass juice powder</p><p>you can take more than it&rsquo;s really only</p><p>one calorie one calorie per scoop so</p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to less than one</p><p>calorie of carb you&rsquo;re not going to</p><p>stimulate you&rsquo;re not going to bump</p><p>yourself out of ketosis at all you can</p><p>do the electrolyte mix you can do the</p><p>wheatgrass and it&rsquo;s not a problem at all</p><p>but that question keeps coming up now</p><p>just because that there&rsquo;s probably gonna</p><p>be another question I&rsquo;m already</p><p>predicting what you&rsquo;re gonna ask can you</p><p>chew gum on a ketogenic diet right</p><p>without it yeah it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re psychic</p><p>so first of all there&rsquo;s sugar there&rsquo;s</p><p>aspartame and gum well yeah that&rsquo;s gonna</p><p>worse and things but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing you&rsquo;re chewing gum with xylitol no</p><p>it&rsquo;s not gonna bump you out of ketosis</p><p>it&rsquo;s such a small amount and then that</p><p>sweetness is gone within a second then</p><p>you&rsquo;re chewing this actual just like</p><p>rubber so you&rsquo;re not gonna bump yourself</p><p>out of ketosis okay so anything that you</p><p>drink tea even coffee in small amounts</p><p>is not gonna bump you out of ketosis</p><p>water will not bump you out of ketosis</p><p>okay so now let&rsquo;s go to Richard from</p><p>Houston you two question based on shift</p><p>work I work a 12-hour shift basis for</p><p>30s and more into 4:30 at</p><p>for four days about in four days almost</p><p>amigo 4:30 at night at 4:30 in the</p><p>morning and I&rsquo;m having trouble figuring</p><p>out how to switch it around yeah all</p><p>right Richard a good question I did a</p><p>video I don&rsquo;t even know if I release</p><p>that video I&rsquo;ll have to check I don&rsquo;t</p><p>think I released that video I&rsquo;m glad you</p><p>reminded me</p><p>yeah the shift work is is is it is a</p><p>pain in the butt because you&rsquo;re throwing</p><p>your body into a whole different pattern</p><p>especially if it&rsquo;s non consistent if you</p><p>were to I think what you told me is you</p><p>have a rotational ship where it&rsquo;s a</p><p>little different I think maybe I&rsquo;m heard</p><p>you incorrectly on that but the point is</p><p>you if you&rsquo;re doing shift work you want</p><p>to keep it consistent and even on the</p><p>days off if possible because your</p><p>circadian waves are gonna be all messed</p><p>up now you could probably get away with</p><p>this if you have really good adrenals</p><p>and you&rsquo;re pretty young but it&rsquo;s going</p><p>to mess up your circadian rhythm with</p><p>with with your with your fat burning and</p><p>your end ketosis as well so in the</p><p>meantime what do you do right until you</p><p>can kind of work out a schedule I would</p><p>just adapt your what you eat and your in</p><p>a minute fasting based on when you go to</p><p>work so in other words what I would do</p><p>is I would if let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re working</p><p>night shifts and then day ship and</p><p>you&rsquo;re sleeping during the day and</p><p>you&rsquo;re working at night go ahead and</p><p>just do the same thing fast for hour</p><p>ok you get up go ahead and eat and then</p><p>you&rsquo;re sleeping for a while and then go</p><p>ahead and try to try to just make sure</p><p>the most important thing is go from fast</p><p>push you&rsquo;re fasting as long as possible</p><p>and I don&rsquo;t again I would have to</p><p>clarify exactly what you said on that so</p><p>I might not be explaining this but you</p><p>want to keep the keeping a minute</p><p>fasting is the same as possible going</p><p>through this all right hey John you&rsquo;re</p><p>from Tennessee you two question about</p><p>keto and tendonitis yes I&rsquo;ve been doing</p><p>keto for about six weeks now lost 25</p><p>pounds I&rsquo;m eating two meals a day</p><p>sometimes one feeling really good</p><p>overall</p><p>but I&rsquo;ve got tendinitis above both of my</p><p>kneecaps it&rsquo;s just giving me fits and I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know what to do with that any</p><p>suggestions yeah good question</p><p>now John on a rare occasion if you ever</p><p>get an ultrasound and they there might</p><p>be a tear there if there&rsquo;s a tear like</p><p>it&rsquo;s never gonna get better so you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have to get that handled and maybe</p><p>even stem-cell might be an option but</p><p>let&rsquo;s just say there&rsquo;s no tear and you</p><p>just have tendonitis doing in a minute</p><p>fasting over a period of time will</p><p>improve that but on some cases you it</p><p>might be an old injury on the knees</p><p>camps I did a video on knee pain you</p><p>should research that and do that</p><p>technique because it&rsquo;s nothing short of</p><p>miraculous and what you&rsquo;re working on is</p><p>muscles up into the thigh and the</p><p>outside of the leg so if you have if</p><p>it&rsquo;s symmetrical on both knees on the</p><p>top of the knees then you&rsquo;d work on the</p><p>back of the knees and someone would do</p><p>some stimulation or massage or you can</p><p>even use a massage tool on that but that</p><p>will knock out pain that you can&rsquo;t get</p><p>rid of when you&rsquo;re doing in a minute</p><p>fasting because you have two things you</p><p>have inflammation that you&rsquo;re pulling</p><p>out of the body from intermittent</p><p>fasting in ketosis and and then you also</p><p>have another situation where the the</p><p>pain is in there from an old injury that</p><p>might be coming from like a different</p><p>source maybe the mechanics are off</p><p>whatever now in these videos I show you</p><p>how to get rid of it but you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>be working on other places in the body</p><p>that are on the opposite side and I</p><p>think you&rsquo;ll be impressed so that&rsquo;s what</p><p>I would do and if you would here I&rsquo;d do</p><p>a demonstration on you so thanks for</p><p>that call someone also wanted to know</p><p>about how long do you have to do fasting</p><p>before you trigger a tapa gee okay and</p><p>that is the the body&rsquo;s ability to</p><p>recycle garbage from your body and</p><p>damaged parts and turning them into good</p><p>healthy tissue again it&rsquo;s kind of like</p><p>an anti-aging process when you do in a</p><p>minute fasting the sweet spot is between</p><p>18 and 24 hours so if you can do it that</p><p>period of time and I would recommend</p><p>doing it like 20 hours if you can go to</p><p>20 hours I think you&rsquo;re being really</p><p>good shape and push it a little bit more</p><p>maybe 21 to</p><p>two hours but that&rsquo;s the sweet spot for</p><p>a tapa G and the more you the longer you</p><p>go the more you&rsquo;re gonna get but it</p><p>seems to have the plateauing effect at</p><p>around 24 hours after that so so that&rsquo;s</p><p>what you need to do in that all right</p><p>Kari yeah have any questions coming up</p><p>well I just want to say first for this</p><p>intermittent fasting email just type</p><p>basics in the facebook live comments and</p><p>then there&rsquo;s a link in YouTube it&rsquo;s a</p><p>course that you can source okay yeah of</p><p>course basics on Facebook live and</p><p>there&rsquo;s a link to click if you&rsquo;re on</p><p>YouTube</p><p>okay so Christina is asking about</p><p>estrogen dominance and what can help</p><p>with that and specifically would the</p><p>nutritional yeast do anything for that</p><p>good question</p><p>no the nutritional yeast is gonna handle</p><p>a different thing I&rsquo;m gonna handle a B</p><p>vitamin deficiencies and adaptation but</p><p>estrogen dominance is usually an over</p><p>productive ovary that you need to</p><p>support just by consuming organic foods</p><p>and get off anything that&rsquo;s GMO so like</p><p>the soy and the corn the canola oil</p><p>that&rsquo;s in the foods and also even</p><p>animals I have that as grain tell GML</p><p>that&rsquo;s gonna aggravate your problem and</p><p>keep us Trojan dominance more than</p><p>anything else so if you were to go</p><p>organic for everything I think that</p><p>would be the best solution to kind of</p><p>reduce the estrogen but there are things</p><p>you can take one would be seek help I</p><p>would do the Icelandic sea kale because</p><p>that is really good at regulating</p><p>estrogen there&rsquo;s another that product I</p><p>have called cruciferous food which has</p><p>all the cruciferous in an organic form</p><p>and that has also the ability to help</p><p>regulate estrogen it doesn&rsquo;t give you</p><p>more or take away more what it does is</p><p>balances the ratio so it brings down the</p><p>bad estrogen and it raises the good</p><p>estrogen and that would be a</p><p>concentrated cruciferous type thing and</p><p>the CCAP those are the two things I</p><p>would recommend</p><p>so let&rsquo;s go to Alex you&rsquo;re from New</p><p>Jersey your weight lifter and you had a</p><p>question about MCT oil</p><p>hey dr. Burke how you doing good thanks</p><p>for taking a call a much much much</p><p>appreciated sure so so listen I got a</p><p>question I&rsquo;ll be doing the intermittent</p><p>fasting ketogenic diet all summer a</p><p>landscaper so you know I&rsquo;m outside</p><p>constantly you know I&rsquo;m working a moving</p><p>so it fit perfectly with my lifestyle I</p><p>have a question though with lifting and</p><p>you know my strength goals sometimes you</p><p>know I integrate you know some low GI</p><p>carbs into the mix you know whether at</p><p>night if it&rsquo;s my second meal of the day</p><p>you know at the end of the week stuff</p><p>like that</p><p>things like lentils you know rarely</p><p>sweet potatoes mostly just lentils but</p><p>nonetheless I love MCT oil and my coffee</p><p>and you know in my shakes things of that</p><p>nature my question to you is if I do a</p><p>bit of a refeed say you know I&rsquo;m 25</p><p>years old I&rsquo;m about 230 pounds say I you</p><p>know have about maybe a hundred 150</p><p>grams of carbohydrates low GI carbs and</p><p>then I you know within the same few</p><p>hours have MCT oil is my body going to</p><p>use the MCT oil or is it gonna try to</p><p>use those carbs immediately and this is</p><p>during while I&rsquo;m in Kentucky ptosis I</p><p>guess up until I integrate those cards</p><p>yeah this is a really good question and</p><p>like I want to bring up because there&rsquo;s</p><p>conflicting information out on the</p><p>internet about this that you have to</p><p>refeed carbs like you have a carb</p><p>loading and even if it&rsquo;s low GI carbs or</p><p>resistance starch okay</p><p>this philosophy is that you need to do</p><p>this because the body you know needs</p><p>carbs and it&rsquo;s going to help your</p><p>muscles it&rsquo;s going to help burn fat it&rsquo;s</p><p>false information it&rsquo;s absolutely false</p><p>information there&rsquo;s if you look at</p><p>ketosis and how to get in ketosis you</p><p>have to keep the carbs between 20 and 50</p><p>grams you&rsquo;re doing 150 grams you&rsquo;re not</p><p>going to be in ketosis and it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>actually distract from building the</p><p>muscle that you want and losing</p><p>the weight if you were to add MCT oil</p><p>with these carbs what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re gonna exaggerate</p><p>insulin even more because when you</p><p>combine any fat with a carb it&rsquo;s even</p><p>worse than having them separately so as</p><p>far as food combining goes you want to</p><p>avoid carbs with protein and carbs as</p><p>fat what you want to combine is protein</p><p>and fat those are the two things you</p><p>want to do now you can do vegetables</p><p>that would be your low low glycemic carb</p><p>all those but I wouldn&rsquo;t start getting</p><p>into the lentils I wouldn&rsquo;t get into the</p><p>fruit that&rsquo;s gonna slow you down</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re over 200 pounds and</p><p>you want to lose weight it&rsquo;s false data</p><p>that you need these carbs now I think</p><p>what happens is people that are in the</p><p>transition phase and they&rsquo;re haven&rsquo;t</p><p>adapted yet 100% and they and they have</p><p>low blood sugar and they take a carb and</p><p>they feel so much more energy especially</p><p>in the workout that&rsquo;s simply because</p><p>you&rsquo;re raising the sugar up but you&rsquo;re</p><p>never going to get out of this</p><p>this blood sugar thing what you want to</p><p>do is fully adapt to the ketogenic</p><p>program to the point where when you</p><p>workout by them you you tap into that</p><p>fat you can run your body in fat you</p><p>have efficient fuel but that takes a</p><p>while to get to that state and that&rsquo;s</p><p>why I never recommend intermittent</p><p>fasting with a higher carbohydrate diet</p><p>because you&rsquo;re going to be susceptible</p><p>to the blood sugars and you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>get tired if you don&rsquo;t eat and you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to get tired if you workout why</p><p>because you haven&rsquo;t adapted to keep</p><p>tones yet so that&rsquo;s a long answer but</p><p>hope that helped all right Karen do you</p><p>have any quick questions there you</p><p>caught me off guard I was typing an</p><p>answer here yeah a lot of people asking</p><p>Karen Karen take my question there&rsquo;s so</p><p>many questions here so Diane says I was</p><p>heard that you need potassium to stop</p><p>cramping but is it really magnesium well</p><p>as far as the muscle goes the muscle</p><p>uses four main minerals for the</p><p>contraction and relaxation of the</p><p>muscles okay you have you need calcium</p><p>for the contraction you need</p><p>potassium magnesium for the relaxation</p><p>you also even need sodium so it&rsquo;s really</p><p>hard to determine exactly which mineral</p><p>that you need that you&rsquo;re deficient and</p><p>that&rsquo;s causing the cramp but if you even</p><p>add any mineral in there you especially</p><p>if it&rsquo;s calcium magnesium calcium I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry</p><p>calcium magnesium sodium or potassium</p><p>the cramps should lessen but you know</p><p>when you eat food or consume anything it</p><p>never comes as one mineral so that&rsquo;s why</p><p>I like a blend I would do electrolyte</p><p>mix or do foods high in minerals and</p><p>that&rsquo;s the best way to correct the</p><p>deeper problem but you know again you</p><p>can usually calcium will help potassium</p><p>will help magnesium will help it&rsquo;s hard</p><p>to tell which one you&rsquo;re deficient</p><p>especially protecting the blood because</p><p>these allow these minerals are inside</p><p>the cell they&rsquo;re not outside the cell so</p><p>you would have to do like a special test</p><p>to measure intracellular minerals which</p><p>people never do so you could have normal</p><p>minerals with minerals in the blood or</p><p>outside the cell but a very huge</p><p>deficiency inside the cell so again I</p><p>would just do a blend of all the</p><p>minerals electrolyte powder usually</p><p>works good I&rsquo;m gonna go to Katherine now</p><p>she has a she&rsquo;s in Baltimore you have a</p><p>question for Alzheimer&rsquo;s go ahead</p><p>Katherine yes hi um my father is is old</p><p>and frail and has Alzheimer&rsquo;s is the</p><p>ketogenic diet I I know I I went through</p><p>a lot to get into ketosis so I mean as</p><p>far as you know energy wise uh it was</p><p>difficult for me but that was because I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t do the avocados and to support my</p><p>body with all of the nutrients I just I</p><p>lowered my carbs and and ate bacon and</p><p>and cream cheese and and things like</p><p>that but I don&rsquo;t know if my father&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna have a hard time getting into</p><p>ketosis and is it safe for him to do</p><p>like you old and then is it safe for</p><p>children to do because their metabolism</p><p>is so high that they I feel like my</p><p>seven-year-old would be you know it</p><p>would be difficult for him to be healthy</p><p>and a ketogenic diet</p><p>because he&rsquo;s just he&rsquo;s it a good healthy</p><p>weight but I don&rsquo;t want him to disappear</p><p>right okay okay go ahead so let me just</p><p>answer the two questions okay for kids I</p><p>think it&rsquo;s great but I wouldn&rsquo;t do a lot</p><p>of intermittent fasting with kids and</p><p>less than you lose weight so maybe you</p><p>do three good meals at a real good</p><p>amount of quality food all you&rsquo;re trying</p><p>to do with this is you&rsquo;re trying to cut</p><p>out the refined sugars and carbs and and</p><p>not raise the insulin so much so for a I</p><p>mean the amount of sugar that I consumed</p><p>the amount of sugar that a child</p><p>consumes normally is just off the charts</p><p>so I would wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to put him</p><p>on a version of it at 7 year-olds and</p><p>then you know I mean go ahead and do the</p><p>sweet potato if you want to do that or</p><p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t do any refined sugars</p><p>okay now for your your dad I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>if it was my dad and he had Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p><p>what I would do I would it&rsquo;s an absolute</p><p>mandatory thing to do ketosis and more</p><p>importantly in a minute fasting because</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna put him in a state of</p><p>what&rsquo;s called a toffee ghee which is</p><p>very good for the brain</p><p>to help protect the brain against</p><p>something called amyloid plaque II which</p><p>is kind of this thing that you always</p><p>see in Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients in</p><p>Parkinson&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of a it disrupts</p><p>the electricity and the flow of neurons</p><p>and and all these things in the brain</p><p>and that comes from high levels of</p><p>insulin so the question is it safe well</p><p>it&rsquo;s safe it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not safe not to do</p><p>it it&rsquo;s very dangerous not to do this</p><p>because he has high insulin most</p><p>definitely and that&rsquo;s creating the</p><p>problem so the absolute best thing to do</p><p>is to put them on in a minute fasting</p><p>just like I explained in the book and in</p><p>my videos and start doing over a period</p><p>of time to the point where you can start</p><p>restoring memory and improve the</p><p>cognitive function and a nice gradient</p><p>okay all right thank you guys so much</p><p>have a great holiday and we&rsquo;re done</p><p>we&rsquo;re gonna talk to you next product</p><p>right before the New Year&rsquo;s all right</p><p>happy holiday</p><p>[Music]</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
