    <p>The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan</p>
<p>that we recorded after my recent appearance</p>
<p>on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.</p>
<p>Joe has been a inspiration to me</p>
<p>and I thank to millions of people</p>
<p>for just being somebody who puts love out there in the world</p>
<p>and being genuinely curious about wild ideas</p>
<p>from chimps and psychedelics to quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I&rsquo;ve been a fan of his podcast</p>
<p>for over a decade and now, somehow, miraculously,</p>
<p>am humbled to be able to call him a friend.</p>

<p>I usually do full ad reads here and never ads in the middle</p>
<p>but this time, I&rsquo;ll just go straight to the conversation</p>
<p>with a bit of guitar first.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;The Unlimited Breadsticks and Dollar Shave Club&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Do you ponder your mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I do think about it sometimes.</p>
<p>I mean, it does pop into my head sometimes,</p>
<p>just the fact that, I mean, I&rsquo;m 53,</p>
<p>so if everything goes great, I have less than 50 years left.</p>
<p>If everything goes great, like no car accidents,</p>
<p>no injuries.</p>
<p>But it could happen today.</p>
<p>This could be your last day.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a stoic thing to meditate on death.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of philosophers,</p>
<p>Ernest Becker and Sheldon Solomon,</p>
<p>they believe that death is at the core of everything.</p>
<p>Wrote this book, Warm at the Core.</p>
<p>So does that come into play in the way you see the world?</p>
<p>I think having a sense of urgency is very beneficial</p>
<p>and understanding that your time is limited</p>
<p>can aid you greatly.</p>
<p>I think knowing that this is a temporary time,</p>
<p>that we have finite lifespans,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s great power in that</p>
<p>because it motivates you, it gets you going.</p>
<p>I think being an immortal, living forever</p>
<p>would be one of the most depressing things,</p>
<p>particularly if everybody else was dying around you.</p>
<p>And I think one of the things that makes life</p>
<p>so interesting and fascinating is that it doesn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>You know, that you really get a brief amount of time here</p>
<p>and really by the time you&rsquo;re just starting</p>
<p>to kind of figure yourself out, who you are</p>
<p>and how not to screw things up so bad,</p>
<p>like, time&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>The ride&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>What about from your, like,</p>
<p>from your daughter&rsquo;s perspective?</p>
<p>Do you think about the world we&rsquo;re in now</p>
<p>and what kind of world you&rsquo;re gonna leave them?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>And do you worry about it?</p>
<p>I do, yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I do when I see these protests and riots and chaos</p>
<p>and so much, so much anger in the world today.</p>
<p>And then particularly today,</p>
<p>I think because of the pandemic</p>
<p>and the fact that so many folks are out of work</p>
<p>and through no fault of their own</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t make ends meet</p>
<p>and these people feel so helpless and angry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a particularly divisive time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a particularly turmoil filled time.</p>
<p>And it just doesn&rsquo;t seem like the world of a year ago even.</p>
<p>It feels very chaotic and dangerous.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a small thing,</p>
<p>like in terms of the possibilities of things</p>
<p>that could happen to the world,</p>
<p>like a pandemic like the one we&rsquo;ve experienced,</p>
<p>it really just doubles the amount of deaths</p>
<p>on a bad flu year.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s relatively speaking is a small thing</p>
<p>in comparison to super volcano eruptions,</p>
<p>asteroid impact, a real horrific pandemic</p>
<p>or one that really wipes out millions</p>
<p>and millions of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stunning how fragile civility is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stunning how fragile our society really is</p>
<p>that something like this can come along,</p>
<p>some unprecedented thing,</p>
<p>unprecedented thing can come along</p>
<p>and all of a sudden everybody&rsquo;s out of work for six months</p>
<p>and then everybody&rsquo;s at each other&rsquo;s throats.</p>
<p>And then politically everyone&rsquo;s at each other&rsquo;s throats.</p>
<p>And then with the advent of social media</p>
<p>and the images that you can see with the videos</p>
<p>of police abuse and just racial tensions</p>
<p>are at an all time high to a point where like,</p>
<p>if you asked me just five or six years ago,</p>
<p>like have racial problems in this country</p>
<p>largely been alleviated,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably say, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way better than it&rsquo;s ever been before.</p>
<p>But now you could argue that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Now you could argue it&rsquo;s no, it&rsquo;s way worse</p>
<p>in just a small amount of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way worse than it&rsquo;s ever been during my lifetime</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m aware of it.</p>
<p>Obviously when I was a young boy in the 60s,</p>
<p>they were still going through the civil rights movement,</p>
<p>but now it just seems very fever pitched.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of that is because of the pandemic</p>
<p>and is because of all the heightened just tension.</p>
<p>What I liken it to is road rage.</p>
<p>Cause you know, people have road rage,</p>
<p>not just because they&rsquo;re in the car</p>
<p>and no one can get to them,</p>
<p>but also because you&rsquo;re at a heightened state</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re driving fast</p>
<p>and you know you&rsquo;re driving fast.</p>
<p>You know, you have to make split second movements.</p>
<p>And so anybody doing something, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>what the people go crazy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re already at an eight</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in the car and they&rsquo;re moving very quickly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it feels like with today with the pandemic</p>
<p>feels like everybody is already at an eight.</p>
<p>So anything that comes along,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like light it all on fire, you know, burn it down.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s part of what I think is part of the reason</p>
<p>for a lot of the looting and the riots and all the chaos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the people that are at work,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also that everyone feels so tense already</p>
<p>and everyone feels so helpless.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know, doing something like that</p>
<p>makes people, it just, it gives people</p>
<p>a whole new motivation for chaos,</p>
<p>a whole new motivation for doing destructive things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve never experienced in my life.</p>
<p>And your better days when you see a positive future,</p>
<p>what do you think is the way out of this chaos of 2020?</p>
<p>Like if you visualize a 2025,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a better world than today.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>How do we get there and what does that look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I can honestly say I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t have said I don&rsquo;t know a year ago.</p>
<p>A year ago, I would have said, we&rsquo;re gonna be okay.</p>
<p>As much as people hate Trump, the economy is doing great.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna be fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how I feel today.</p>
<p>Today, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a clear solution politically</p>
<p>because I think if Trump wins,</p>
<p>people are gonna be furious.</p>
<p>And I think if Biden wins, people are gonna be furious.</p>
<p>Particularly like if things get more woke,</p>
<p>if people continue to enforce this force compliance</p>
<p>and make people behave a certain way and act a certain way,</p>
<p>which seems to be a part of what this whole woke thing is.</p>
<p>The most disturbing for me is that I see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I see there&rsquo;s a lot of losers that have hopped on this</p>
<p>and they shove it in people&rsquo;s faces</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have to make sense.</p>
<p>Like there was a Black Lives Matter protest</p>
<p>that stopped this woman at a restaurant.</p>
<p>They were surrounding her outside a restaurant.</p>
<p>They were forcing her to raise her fist in compliance.</p>
<p>This is a woman who&rsquo;s marched for Black Lives multiple times,</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter multiple times.</p>
<p>And the people all around her doing this were all white.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all weird.</p>
<p>My friend, Coach T, he&rsquo;s a wrestling coach,</p>
<p>is also on a podcast, my friend, Brian Moses.</p>
<p>His take on it is that black, and he&rsquo;s a black guy.</p>
<p>He says, Black Lives Matter is a white cult.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, when you see that picture,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to argue that he&rsquo;s got a point.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s clearly not all about that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of people that have jumped on board</p>
<p>that are very much like cult members.</p>
<p>Because the thing about Black Lives Matter or any movement</p>
<p>is you can&rsquo;t control who joins.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no entrance examination.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t go, okay, how do you feel about this?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your perceptions on that?</p>
<p>Like the man who shot the Trump supporter in Portland,</p>
<p>that guy who murdered the Trump supporter</p>
<p>then the cops shot him.</p>
<p>That guy was walking around with his hand on his gun</p>
<p>looking for Trump supporters.</p>
<p>Just want, I mean, he&rsquo;s a known violent guy</p>
<p>who was walking around looking for Trump supporters,</p>
<p>found one and shot one.</p>
<p>That has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a white guy, he shot another white guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just madness.</p>
<p>And that kind of madness is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s disturbing to see it ramp up so quickly.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s been riots in Portland every night.</p>
<p>Oh, excuse me, demonstrations for 101 days now.</p>
<p>101 days in a row of them lighting things on fire,</p>
<p>breaking into federal buildings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, whoever saw that coming?</p>
<p>Nobody saw that coming.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what the solution is</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know what it looks like in five years.</p>
<p>But 2025, to answer your question,</p>
<p>like it could be anything.</p>
<p>I mean, we could be looking at Mad Max.</p>
<p>We could be looking at the apocalypse.</p>
<p>We could also be looking at an invasion from another country.</p>
<p>We could be looking at a war, like a real hot war.</p>
<p>To put a little bit of responsibility on you,</p>
<p>like for me, I&rsquo;ve listened to you</p>
<p>since the Red Band, Olive Garden days,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the very beginning.</p>
<p>And there was something in the way you communicated</p>
<p>about the world, maybe there was others,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re the one I was aware of,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re open minded and like loving towards the world,</p>
<p>especially as the podcast developed.</p>
<p>Like you just demonstrated and lived</p>
<p>this kind of just kindness,</p>
<p>or maybe even like lack of jealousy</p>
<p>in your own little profession of comedy.</p>
<p>It was clear that you didn&rsquo;t succumb</p>
<p>to the weaker aspects of human nature</p>
<p>and thereby inspire like people like me,</p>
<p>who I was naturally, probably especially in like the 20s,</p>
<p>early 20s, kind of jealous on the success of others.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re really the primary person that taught me</p>
<p>to truly celebrate the success of others.</p>
<p>And so by way of question, you kind of have a role in this</p>
<p>of making a better 2025.</p>
<p>You have such a big megaphone.</p>
<p>Is there something you think you can do on this podcast</p>
<p>with the words, the way you talk,</p>
<p>the things you discuss that could create a better 2025?</p>
<p>I think if anything, I could help in leading by example,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s only gonna help the people that are listening.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what else I can do</p>
<p>in terms of like make the world a better place,</p>
<p>other than express my hopes and wishes for that</p>
<p>and just try to be as nice as I can to people</p>
<p>as often as I can.</p>
<p>But I also think that I&rsquo;ve fallen into this weird category,</p>
<p>particularly with the Spotify deal,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m one of them now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a regular person anymore.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m like some famous rich guy.</p>
<p>So you go from being a regular person</p>
<p>to a famous rich guy that&rsquo;s out of touch.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a real issue whenever you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the economy, about just real life problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It kind of hurts my heart to hear people say</p>
<p>about Elon Musk, he&rsquo;s just a billionaire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting statement.</p>
<p>But I think if you just continue being you</p>
<p>and he continue being him,</p>
<p>I think people are just voicing their worry</p>
<p>that you become some rich guy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if they&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re just finding,</p>
<p>the way he describes it, an attack vector.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think they can dismiss you by just saying,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re just a that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re easily definable.</p>
<p>Right, but there&rsquo;s truth to that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not careful, you can become out of touch.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t you become out of touch?</p>
<p>As a human off the podcast, you don&rsquo;t act like a,</p>
<p>like you talk to somebody like me.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t talk like a famous person</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t act rich, like you&rsquo;re better than others.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain, listen, I&rsquo;ve talked to quite a few,</p>
<p>you have too, but I&rsquo;ve talked to a special kind of group</p>
<p>of people that are like Nobel Prize winners, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>They sometimes have an air to them that&rsquo;s of arrogance.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t, what&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>Well, you gotta know what that is, right?</p>
<p>Like that air of arrogance comes from</p>
<p>drinking your own Koolaid.</p>
<p>You start believing that somehow or another,</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;re getting praise from all these people,</p>
<p>that you really are something different.</p>
<p>Usually it exemplifies, there&rsquo;s something there</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lack of struggle.</p>
<p>And I think a struggle is</p>
<p>probably one of the most important balancing tools</p>
<p>that a person can have.</p>
<p>And for me, I struggle mentally and I struggle physically.</p>
<p>I struggle mentally in that, like we were talking about</p>
<p>on the podcast we did previously,</p>
<p>you and I on my podcast said, I&rsquo;m not a fan of my work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of what I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m my harshest critic.</p>
<p>So anytime anybody says something bad about me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, listen, I said way worse about myself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like anything I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ruthlessly introspective.</p>
<p>And I will continue to be that way.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s the only way you could be good as a comedian.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other way.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just think you&rsquo;re awesome and just go out there.</p>
<p>You have to be like picking apart everything you do.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a balance to that too,</p>
<p>cause you have to have enough confidence</p>
<p>to go out there and perform.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t think, oh my God, I suck.</p>
<p>I know what I&rsquo;m doing, but I know what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>because I put in all that work.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons why I put in all that work</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t like the end result most of the time.</p>
<p>So I need to work at it all the time.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s physical struggle,</p>
<p>which I think balances everything out.</p>
<p>Without physical struggle, I always make the analogy</p>
<p>that the body is in a lot of ways like a battery,</p>
<p>where if you have extra charge,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it leaks out of the top</p>
<p>and it becomes unmanageable and messy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how my psyche is.</p>
<p>If I have too much energy,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m not exerting myself in a violent way,</p>
<p>like an explosive way, like wearing myself out,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like the way the world is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the way I interface with the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too tense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too quick to be upset about things.</p>
<p>But when I work out hard</p>
<p>and I put in a brutal training session, everything&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Well, the first time I talked to you, Jerry, you were doing</p>
<p>Sober October.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something in your eyes,</p>
<p>like I think you&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>that you exercise the demons out essentially.</p>
<p>So you exercise to get whatever the parts of you</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t like out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a darkness in you there,</p>
<p>like the competitiveness and the focus of that person.</p>
<p>That was a scary time in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>that Sober October thing.</p>
<p>Because my friends, we were all talking shit, right?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re competing against each other</p>
<p>in these fitness challenges.</p>
<p>And you had one point,</p>
<p>like you got a certain amount of points</p>
<p>for each minute that you went at 80% of your max heart rate.</p>
<p>And one day I got 1100 points.</p>
<p>So I did seven hours on an elliptical machine</p>
<p>watching the bathhouse scene from John Wick</p>
<p>where he murders all those people in the bathhouse.</p>
<p>I watched it probably 50 times in a row.</p>
<p>I went crazy.</p>
<p>I went crazy, but I went crazy in a weird way</p>
<p>where it brought me back to my fighting days.</p>
<p>It was like the same, that person came out again.</p>
<p>It was like, well, I didn&rsquo;t even know he was in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re like an assassin, like a killer.</p>
<p>Like I felt like a different person.</p>
<p>Is it echoes of like what Mike Tyson talked about essentially?</p>
<p>Like the&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe, but no orgasm in the oceans.</p>
<p>All the crazy shit that he was saying.</p>
<p>Is there a violent person in there?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of violence in me for sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s genetic or learned</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s because during my formative years</p>
<p>from the time I was 15 till I was 22, all I did was fight.</p>
<p>That was all I did.</p>
<p>All I did was train and compete.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I did.</p>
<p>That was my whole life.</p>
<p>Is it connected to&hellip;</p>
<p>So your mom and dad broke up early on.</p>
<p>Is it connected to the dad at all?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s connected to him also because he was violent</p>
<p>and it made me feel very scared to be around him.</p>
<p>But I also think it&rsquo;s connected in who he was as a human</p>
<p>is transferred into my DNA.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a certain amount of&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, to be prejudiced against myself,</p>
<p>I look like a violent person.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t know me, even the way I&rsquo;m built,</p>
<p>not even just the working out part,</p>
<p>just the size of my hands</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the width of my shoulders.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s most likely a lot of violence in my history,</p>
<p>in my past, in my ancestry.</p>
<p>And I think we minimize that with people.</p>
<p>So much of your behavior, when I see my daughter,</p>
<p>I have one daughter that&rsquo;s obsessive</p>
<p>in terms of she wants to get really good at things</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;ll practice things all day long.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s 100% my personality.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s me in female form.</p>
<p>But without the anger as much and without the fear,</p>
<p>she has loving household and everything like that.</p>
<p>But she has this intense obsession with doing things</p>
<p>and doing things really well and getting better.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>We have to tell her, stop doing hand springs in the house.</p>
<p>Stop, stop, come on, just sit down, have dinner.</p>
<p>Like one more, one more.</p>
<p>Like she&rsquo;s just like, she&rsquo;s psycho.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of behavior and personality</p>
<p>and a lot of these things are passed down through genetics.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how much of who you are genetically</p>
<p>is learned behavior, nature or nurture.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s learned behavior</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s intrinsically a part of you</p>
<p>because of who your parents were.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s certainly some genetic violence in me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly.</p>
<p>And then you channeled it.</p>
<p>So you figured out it&rsquo;s basically your life</p>
<p>is a productive exploration of how to channel that.</p>
<p>Yes, how to figure out how to get that monkey to sit down</p>
<p>and calm down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another person in there.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a calm, rational, kind, friendly person</p>
<p>who just wants to laugh and have fun.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s that dude who comes out</p>
<p>when I did Sober October.</p>
<p>That guy&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that guy.</p>
<p>That guy just wants to get up in the morning and go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I mean, when I was competing, it was necessary.</p>
<p>But it makes me remember.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really remember what I used to be like until that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I&rsquo;m working out seven hours a day</p>
<p>and just so obsessed.</p>
<p>And all I was thinking about was winning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I was thinking about.</p>
<p>Like if they were working out five hours a day,</p>
<p>I wanted them to know that I was gonna work out</p>
<p>an extra three hours and I was gonna get up early</p>
<p>and I was gonna text them all.</p>
<p>Hey, pussies, I&rsquo;m up already.</p>
<p>Take pictures, send selfies.</p>
<p>I was like, you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>I kept telling them, you&rsquo;re all gonna die.</p>
<p>You try to keep up with me, you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t fully joking.</p>
<p>No, I wasn&rsquo;t joking at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what was fucked up about it.</p>
<p>This is the scary thing when I interacted with Goggins</p>
<p>and what I saw in you during that time is like,</p>
<p>this guy, like, this is why I&rsquo;ve been avoiding</p>
<p>David Ganga&rsquo;s recently.</p>
<p>Is like, cause he wants to meet,</p>
<p>he wants to talk on this podcast,</p>
<p>but he also wants to run an ultra marathon with me.</p>
<p>And I felt like this is a person,</p>
<p>if I spend any time in this realm,</p>
<p>if I spend any time with a Joe Rogan of that sober October,</p>
<p>like, I might have to die to get out.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s this kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a competitive aspect that&rsquo;s super unhealthy.</p>
<p>I mean, you saw the video that we watched earlier today</p>
<p>of Goggins draining his knee.</p>
<p>That would stop me from running ever again</p>
<p>because I would think in my head, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ruin my cartilage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna need a knee replacement.</p>
<p>I would start thinking, I would go down that line,</p>
<p>but he is perpetually in this push it mindset,</p>
<p>what he calls the dog in him.</p>
<p>That dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dog.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s who he is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why he&rsquo;s so inspirational</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s fuel for millions and millions of people.</p>
<p>I mean, he really is.</p>
<p>He motivates people in a way that is so powerful,</p>
<p>but it can be very destructive.</p>
<p>I know now, especially after the sober October thing,</p>
<p>that that thing&rsquo;s still in me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>so I really haven&rsquo;t done anything physically competitive,</p>
<p>except one time I was supposed to fight Wesley Snipes.</p>
<p>It came out then too.</p>
<p>That came out too.</p>
<p>That got creepy too, but luckily that never happened.</p>
<p>But that was many months of training,</p>
<p>like training twice a day, every day,</p>
<p>kickboxing in the morning, jiu jitsu at night.</p>
<p>I was just going and going and going and going.</p>
<p>And I was just thinking just all day long.</p>
<p>But it fucks with all the other aspects of your life.</p>
<p>It fucks with your friendships.</p>
<p>It fucks with my comedy.</p>
<p>It fucks with everything.</p>
<p>Because that mindset is not a mindset of an artist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mindset of a conqueror.</p>
<p>The conqueror. Yeah.</p>
<p>Destroyer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so interesting to see Mike Tyson</p>
<p>make the switch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that whatever that is, however that fight goes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a switch.</p>
<p>He stepped into a different dimension.</p>
<p>Roy Jones Jr. is coming on my podcast soon.</p>
<p>And Roy&rsquo;s going to be on before the fight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so curious to see how it goes down,</p>
<p>but genuinely concerned.</p>
<p>Because Mike Tyson is a heavyweight.</p>
<p>And Roy Jones at his best was 168 pounds.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Roy has that room in his house, mental house,</p>
<p>of where Mike Tyson goes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he has that room.</p>
<p>Mike doesn&rsquo;t have a room.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got an empire in there.</p>
<p>He opens up the door.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole empire in his head.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s in that firmly.</p>
<p>When he got out of the weed and started training again,</p>
<p>you could see it in him.</p>
<p>And by the way, physically, in person, he looks spectacular.</p>
<p>He looks like a fucking Adonis.</p>
<p>I mean, he looks ready to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I watch his videos of him.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Have you ever considered competing in jiu jitsu?</p>
<p>No, for that very reason.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get obsessed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my number one concern.</p>
<p>I had to quit video games when we were playing video games</p>
<p>in the studio.</p>
<p>I had to quit because I was playing five hours a day,</p>
<p>like out of nowhere.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I was playing five hours a day.</p>
<p>I was coming home late for dinner.</p>
<p>I was ending podcasts early and jumping on the video games</p>
<p>and playing.</p>
<p>I get obsessed with things.</p>
<p>And I have to recognize what that is</p>
<p>and these competitive things, like competitive, especially</p>
<p>like really exciting competitive things like video games.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very dangerous for me.</p>
<p>The ultimate competitive video game is like jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>And if I was young, I most certainly would have done it.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t have a very clear career path,</p>
<p>it was something that I enjoyed.</p>
<p>My concern would be that I would become a professional jiu jitsu</p>
<p>fighter when I was young.</p>
<p>And then I would not have the energy</p>
<p>to do stand up and do all the other things</p>
<p>that I wound up doing as a career.</p>
<p>When I was 21, I quit my job teaching.</p>
<p>I was teaching at Boston University.</p>
<p>I was teaching Taekwondo there.</p>
<p>And I knew, and I also had my own school in Revere.</p>
<p>I knew I couldn&rsquo;t do it right.</p>
<p>And also be doing stand up comedy.</p>
<p>I knew I couldn&rsquo;t do both of those things.</p>
<p>There was no way.</p>
<p>You have to be cognizant of that obsessive force</p>
<p>within you to make sure.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;d have to know how to manage my mental illness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very particular mental illness.</p>
<p>And I think that mental illness, again,</p>
<p>my formative years from 15 until I was 21ish, 22,</p>
<p>those years were spent constantly</p>
<p>obsessed with martial arts.</p>
<p>That was my whole day.</p>
<p>I mean, I trained almost every day.</p>
<p>The only time I would not train is if I was either injured</p>
<p>or if I was exhausted, if I needed a day off.</p>
<p>But I was obsessed.</p>
<p>And so that part of my personality</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t nurtured is always</p>
<p>going to be there under the surface.</p>
<p>And when it gets reignited by something, it&rsquo;s very weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird feeling.</p>
<p>And it can get reignited with a video game.</p>
<p>It can get reignited with anything.</p>
<p>That obsessive whatever it is, that competitive demon.</p>
<p>Yeah, the way you talk about guitar,</p>
<p>I know you would fall in love with playing guitar.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;re very wise to not touch that thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t golf.</p>
<p>I have friends who want to golf.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, mm mm, I don&rsquo;t fucking want that thing.</p>
<p>So a lot of people ask me like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s Joe Rogan&rsquo;s jiu jitsu game like?</p>
<p>Like assuming that I somehow spend hours</p>
<p>rolling with you before and after a track.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s a good, you should at some point</p>
<p>show a technique or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be fun.</p>
<p>Sure, I mean, I&rsquo;ve got this technique online.</p>
<p>Oh, I saw you doing, I think, head and arm something online.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>I fucked my neck up doing head and arm chokes.</p>
<p>I did them so much that I,</p>
<p>because you use your neck so much with head and arm chokes,</p>
<p>I developed like a real kink in my neck.</p>
<p>And it turned out I had a bulging disc.</p>
<p>And, you know.</p>
<p>So you do it on that, just one side?</p>
<p>Well, it was, no, I could do it on the left side,</p>
<p>but I definitely am better on the right side.</p>
<p>The right side was my best side.</p>
<p>So if you were to compete, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s your A game?</p>
<p>Where would you go from standing up?</p>
<p>How would you go to submission?</p>
<p>Would you pull guard, would you take down?</p>
<p>How would you pass guard?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have good takedowns.</p>
<p>I was not a good wrestler.</p>
<p>So I would most likely either pull guard</p>
<p>or I would pull half guard.</p>
<p>Do you have a good guard?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are you comfortable being on your butt, on your back?</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m very flexible.</p>
<p>So I have a good, my rubber guard is pretty good.</p>
<p>You go to rubber guard.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have good arm bars and good triangles off my back.</p>
<p>But I also have a very good half guard,</p>
<p>but my top game is my best.</p>
<p>I have a very strong top game.</p>
<p>Do you have a half guard?</p>
<p>Do you have a preference of like what kind of guard</p>
<p>and how to pass that guard?</p>
<p>And like, yeah, like, is there a specific game plan?</p>
<p>Like, do you?</p>
<p>Double underhooks from half guard is the game plan for me.</p>
<p>If I can get double underhooks from half guard,</p>
<p>I could sweep a lot of people.</p>
<p>Underhooks of what?</p>
<p>Sorry, the arms or the legs?</p>
<p>So half guard, lockdown, right?</p>
<p>Half guard, go into lockdown, double underhooks.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Suck the body, suck the body.</p>
<p>Just pressure.</p>
<p>And yeah, massive pressure.</p>
<p>And then inch my way into a position we call the dog fight</p>
<p>and inch my way to a position</p>
<p>where I could get the person on their back.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>cause you did show me,</p>
<p>I still disagree with you about the tie thing.</p>
<p>The tie.</p>
<p>That you can choke somebody with it.</p>
<p>Oh, tie is wrong.</p>
<p>So wrong, so wrong.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not wrong with you.</p>
<p>With you, it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Cause you know.</p>
<p>No, I think there&rsquo;s a system.</p>
<p>I have this thing, Madonna hair,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna figure it out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But the.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Velcro on the back.</p>
<p>No, but see, that&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re just not the.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re cheating.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re the exact, that&rsquo;s cheating.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did, I did feel when you showed me,</p>
<p>I think you showed me the rubber guard</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s still a guard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit foreign to me.</p>
<p>I just felt that you can immediately feel,</p>
<p>not with the rubber guard,</p>
<p>but the way you move your body is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like a Shanji type of guy</p>
<p>who knows how to control another human being.</p>
<p>So like some people are a little bit more,</p>
<p>I would say agile and technical,</p>
<p>like playful and kind of.</p>
<p>Loose.</p>
<p>Loose and they work on transition, transition, transition.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a control guy.</p>
<p>Like you know how to control position</p>
<p>and advanced position.</p>
<p>Donna hair is the same way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s all about control.</p>
<p>My game is smush.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my game.</p>
<p>Smush you, grab a hold of you.</p>
<p>Once I have you, why would I let you go?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my thought is like, why would I let you go?</p>
<p>I just wanna incrementally move to a better position</p>
<p>until I can strangle you.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m much more into strangling people</p>
<p>than anything else.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is a great MMA approach for jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Well, too many people don&rsquo;t tap when you get their arms.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not opposed to arm bars.</p>
<p>I love arm bars, but everybody goes to sleep.</p>
<p>And quit from pressure too.</p>
<p>I mean, quit mentally.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a guy who&rsquo;s like a really good top game guy</p>
<p>and he mounts you, and I&rsquo;m a big fan of mounting</p>
<p>with my legs crossed, like a guard, like a top guard.</p>
<p>And so I can squeeze with both legs, smush.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just looking for people to make mistakes</p>
<p>and slowly incrementally bettering my position</p>
<p>until I can get something locked up.</p>
<p>I love jiu jitsu though, man.</p>
<p>I just wish it didn&rsquo;t injure you.</p>
<p>Jiu jitsu is like, if your joints were more durable,</p>
<p>they could figure out a way to make joints more durable.</p>
<p>God, I could do jiu jitsu forever.</p>
<p>So much fun.</p>
<p>I actually, I talked to this roboticist, Russ Tedrick.</p>
<p>He builds, he&rsquo;s one of the world class people</p>
<p>that builds humanoid robots.</p>
<p>You were interested in Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the key people in that kind of robotics.</p>
<p>So I asked him the stupidest question of like,</p>
<p>how far are we from having a robot be a UFC champion?</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s actually a really, really tough problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing that makes somebody</p>
<p>like Danielle Comey on the wrestling side special,</p>
<p>because you have to understand the movement</p>
<p>of the human body in ways that&rsquo;s so difficult to teach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so subtle.</p>
<p>The timing, the pressure points, the leverage,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just for the clinch situation.</p>
<p>And then the movement for the striking is very difficult.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re not allowed as a robot</p>
<p>to use your natural abilities of having a lot more power.</p>
<p>Right, a lot more power and more durable.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The human body, like especially meniscus.</p>
<p>Like you see the heel hook game,</p>
<p>like everybody&rsquo;s involved in leg locks and heel hooks.</p>
<p>Like all those guys wind up with torched knees.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s got torched knees.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s knees are torn apart.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t grow new meniscus.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s like one of those joints where,</p>
<p>man, when it goes, those guys are 28 years old,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve blown out knees.</p>
<p>Let me ask the ridiculous question.</p>
<p>What do you think, we&rsquo;re talking about cops,</p>
<p>what do you think is the best martial arts self defense?</p>
<p>For sure, jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Wrestling?</p>
<p>I think grappling, I should say.</p>
<p>Judo as well, especially in a cold climate,</p>
<p>if you get someone who&rsquo;s got like a heavy winter jacket on,</p>
<p>my God, like judo&rsquo;s an incredible martial art.</p>
<p>Plus concrete.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the worst place to be,</p>
<p>with a heavy winter jacket with a judo specialist</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re standing up with them, oh my God.</p>
<p>But I think grappling,</p>
<p>because in most self defense situations,</p>
<p>it usually winds up with grappling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re definitely better off, though,</p>
<p>knowing some striking,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nothing more terrifying</p>
<p>than when you go to take someone down,</p>
<p>they actually have takedown skills, but they can fight.</p>
<p>And so they have takedown defense</p>
<p>and they know how to fight,</p>
<p>and then you don&rsquo;t know how to stand up.</p>
<p>Like the worst thing in the world</p>
<p>is seeing someone like reaching</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t know how to do striking and someone cracks you.</p>
<p>What about all that Krav Maga talk,</p>
<p>which is like, you know, the whole line of argument</p>
<p>that says that jiu jitsu and wrestling</p>
<p>and all of these sports, they fundamentally take you away</p>
<p>from the nature of violence.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just teaching you how to play</p>
<p>versus the reality of violence</p>
<p>that is involved in like a self defense situation</p>
<p>that is a totally different set of skills would be needed.</p>
<p>In general, the people that say that jiu jitsu</p>
<p>or other martial arts, it&rsquo;s more of a sport</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really understand violence.</p>
<p>In general, the people that say that suck.</p>
<p>Anybody who thinks like, someone&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, hey man, I&rsquo;ll just bite you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, are you gonna bite me?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you think I&rsquo;m gonna bite you too?</p>
<p>What do you think of that?</p>
<p>What if I punch you in your fucking face?</p>
<p>You think you&rsquo;re still gonna bite me</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t even see?</p>
<p>When you barely even know you&rsquo;re alive</p>
<p>and I choke you unconscious?</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s really good at jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>good luck stabbing them with your keys.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t have a chance.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a chance.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s much better than you</p>
<p>and they trip you and get you on your back</p>
<p>and then they fucking elbow you in your face</p>
<p>and then get a head and arm choke on you,</p>
<p>all that crap, my gosh, it&rsquo;s out the window, son.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re way better off learning what works on trained killers.</p>
<p>Like this whole idea that you&rsquo;re gonna poke someone</p>
<p>in the eye and then you&rsquo;re gonna kick them in the nuts.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re going through these drills</p>
<p>that yeah, it&rsquo;s good to know what to do</p>
<p>if you run into someone who doesn&rsquo;t know how to fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way better to know what to do</p>
<p>to someone who knows how to fight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best thing.</p>
<p>Learn how to fight against people who know how to fight.</p>
<p>Like all that practice self defense</p>
<p>and they go, it&rsquo;s gonna come at you with a knife.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna grab the wrist and do that.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s good to know self defense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much more important</p>
<p>to understand martial arts comprehensively.</p>
<p>When you understand martial arts comprehensively,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s no, I shouldn&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s no Krav Maga guys,</p>
<p>but it would be shocking if a Krav Maga guy</p>
<p>and a mixed martial arts guy had a fight</p>
<p>and the mixed martial arts guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a trained killer all around didn&rsquo;t fuck that guy up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would expect would happen.</p>
<p>I would not think that some guy</p>
<p>who has a little bit of this and a little bit of that</p>
<p>and prepares for the streets is gonna be able</p>
<p>to handle a person who trains with killers</p>
<p>on a day to day basis,</p>
<p>who rolls with jujitsu black belts,</p>
<p>who trains with Muay Thai champions.</p>
<p>Like the best martial arts are the martial arts</p>
<p>that work on martial artists,</p>
<p>not the martial arts that work on untrained people.</p>
<p>What about, we&rsquo;re in Texas now.</p>
<p>What about guns?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the best martial art.</p>
<p>No, but would you, like in this crazy time,</p>
<p>should people carry guns?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a bad idea to have a gun</p>
<p>because if you need a gun, you have a gun.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t need a gun,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a person with self control,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna use it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna just randomly use it,</p>
<p>but you have something to protect you.</p>
<p>This is the whole idea of the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>The whole idea of the Second Amendment</p>
<p>gets distorted by mass shootings</p>
<p>or by terrible people who murder people</p>
<p>and do terrible things.</p>
<p>But all those things are real,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t take away from the fundamental efficacy</p>
<p>of having a firearm and defending your family</p>
<p>or defending your life.</p>
<p>And there are real live situations</p>
<p>where people have had firearms</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s protected them or their loved ones</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ve stopped shooters.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many of these stories,</p>
<p>but people don&rsquo;t like those stories</p>
<p>because then it tends to lead to this gun culture argument,</p>
<p>this pro gun culture argument</p>
<p>that people find very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Human beings are messy</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re messy in so many different ways, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re messy emotionally, we&rsquo;re messy physically,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also messy in what&rsquo;s good or bad.</p>
<p>We want things to be binary.</p>
<p>We want things to be right or wrong, one or zero.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not, but there is crime in the world.</p>
<p>There is violence in the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re better off knowing how to fight</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re better off knowing how to defend yourself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re better off having a gun.</p>
<p>And I generally think that guns,</p>
<p>I do like the idea that guns,</p>
<p>the Second Amendment helps protect the First Amendment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of sense that puts me at ease</p>
<p>knowing that so many people in this country have guns</p>
<p>that, I mean, Alex Jones,</p>
<p>I just listened to one episode of Infowars</p>
<p>for the first time.</p>
<p>Boy, he reminds me like when I drank some tequila,</p>
<p>I felt like I&rsquo;m going to some dark places today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I feel like listening to him.</p>
<p>But he talks about like that he worries about martial law.</p>
<p>So basically government overreach by,</p>
<p>which happened throughout history.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something to worry about there,</p>
<p>but it puts me at ease knowing</p>
<p>that so much of the population has guns</p>
<p>that people, government would think twice</p>
<p>before instituting martial law on cities.</p>
<p>But I actually was asking almost like</p>
<p>on the individual level,</p>
<p>I maybe shouldn&rsquo;t say this, but I don&rsquo;t yet own a gun.</p>
<p>And I felt that if I carry a gun</p>
<p>statistically just for me as a human,</p>
<p>knowing my psychology,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m more likely to die.</p>
<p>Like I feel like I would put myself in situations</p>
<p>that I shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like the way I will see the world will change</p>
<p>because my natural feeling is like when somebody,</p>
<p>when I was in Philly and I knew late at night,</p>
<p>if West Philly, when some guy looks at you</p>
<p>and you can immediately calculate</p>
<p>that this is a dangerous human being,</p>
<p>it starts with a monkey look at first.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a bigger monkey than you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I found like, for example,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do the beta thing of just looking down</p>
<p>and turning away and just getting out of trouble</p>
<p>like very politely.</p>
<p>And basically that kind of approach,</p>
<p>because if you have,</p>
<p>in terms of getting out of serious violent situations,</p>
<p>like serious something where you could die</p>
<p>versus if I had a gun, I feel like I would want to be,</p>
<p>that there would be that cowboy monkey thing</p>
<p>where I would want to put myself in situations</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m a little bit of a savior, even of myself</p>
<p>and almost create danger, which can no longer,</p>
<p>like the escalation of which I can no longer control.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re talking about taking a gun somewhere</p>
<p>versus having a gun in your home.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I mean carry on me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different situation</p>
<p>and much harder to get a warrant or a license for that.</p>
<p>Control, concealed carry licenses,</p>
<p>especially in Massachusetts, they don&rsquo;t come easy.</p>
<p>Well message, yeah, that&rsquo;s a whole nother thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying gun in the home.</p>
<p>Yeah, gun in the home, having a gun,</p>
<p>knowing how to use a gun.</p>
<p>Like I know how to use a gun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve trained many hours,</p>
<p>learning how to shoot a gun at tactical places.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of videos of me doing it on Instagram.</p>
<p>I practice and I think it&rsquo;s good to understand</p>
<p>how to be accurate.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been a fan of your podcast for a long time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t often talk about it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re always kind of looking forward,</p>
<p>but if you look at the old studio that you just left,</p>
<p>is there some epic memories that stand out to you</p>
<p>that like you almost look back,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe this happened?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, almost too many of them to count.</p>
<p>Is there something that pops into mind now?</p>
<p>All of them, Elon Musk blowing that flamethrower</p>
<p>in the middle of the hallway, I got a video of that.</p>
<p>Have you seen the video of it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you posted it on Instagram.</p>
<p>I think I did too.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s a mad man.</p>
<p>Having Bernie Sanders in there,</p>
<p>just all the fun fight companions we did</p>
<p>and all the crazy podcasts with Joey Diaz</p>
<p>and Duncan Trussell and there were so many.</p>
<p>There were so many moments.</p>
<p>Podcasts, this is a weird art form</p>
<p>and it almost sounds silly,</p>
<p>but it almost seems like something that chose me</p>
<p>rather than I chose it.</p>
<p>I think of that all the time in some strange way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m showing up as like an antenna</p>
<p>and I just plug in and twist on</p>
<p>and then I take in the thing and I put it together</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like a passenger of this weird ride.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve talked about this before.</p>
<p>I really like this idea</p>
<p>that human beings are just carriers of these ideas.</p>
<p>Ideas are the ones who are breeding.</p>
<p>So in a sense like the idea found you as a useful brain</p>
<p>to use to spread itself through the podcasting medium.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because when I think about your podcast,</p>
<p>I think about Joey Diaz.</p>
<p>I think about all those comedians you&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>I mean, I think you&rsquo;ve had Joey on,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe close to 50 times, some crazy number.</p>
<p>Is there, I mean, he is over the top offensive,</p>
<p>just that&rsquo;s who he is to the core.</p>
<p>Is there some sense where you wondered like</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s right to have the Spotify episode number one</p>
<p>with Duncan Dressel for five hours?</p>
<p>No, I wanted to do it that way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we wore NASA suits and we got high as fuck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s the whole idea behind it.</p>
<p>I mean, can you introspect that a little bit?</p>
<p>Like, can you think, like, what is that?</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a rare thing to do because you&rsquo;re not supposed</p>
<p>to talk to Duncan Dressel with a huge platform</p>
<p>that you have five hours.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because Donald Trump apparently watches your podcast.</p>
<p>So just the idea that there&rsquo;s these,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I think about,</p>
<p>these CEOs write to me that they listen to the podcast</p>
<p>that I do and I have somebody like a David Fravor</p>
<p>and I was nervous about it.</p>
<p>I was nervous to have a conversation.</p>
<p>For me, David Fravor is a Duncan Dressel, which is like.</p>
<p>Just because of his experiences with UFOs.</p>
<p>Yeah, even just the way he sees the world</p>
<p>because he is open.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s always like this,</p>
<p>but he opened himself to the possibility</p>
<p>of unconventional ideas.</p>
<p>Most people in the scientific community kind of say,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t really want to believe anything</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of hard evidence.</p>
<p>And so that was to me like a step.</p>
<p>And as the thing somehow becomes more popular,</p>
<p>there becomes this fear of like,</p>
<p>well, should I talk to this person or not?</p>
<p>And I mean, you&rsquo;re an inspiration in saying like,</p>
<p>do whatever the hell you want.</p>
<p>You have to.</p>
<p>First of all, I have what you call fuck you money.</p>
<p>And if you have fuck you money, you don&rsquo;t say fuck you.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of having the fuck you money?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wasting it.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re wasting the position.</p>
<p>Like someone said to me like,</p>
<p>why do you like sports cars so much?</p>
<p>Like how many cars do you have, a bunch of cars?</p>
<p>Because if I was a kid and I said,</p>
<p>hey, if I was that crazy rich famous guy,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t want to have a bunch of cool fucking cars.</p>
<p>Like, so I would do that.</p>
<p>Like, cause not everybody gets to do that.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re the person that gets to do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of supposed to do it.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s if you want to,</p>
<p>if that really does speak to you.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ve talked to you about this before,</p>
<p>muscle cars, specifically ones from the 1960s</p>
<p>and the early seventies.</p>
<p>They speak to me in some weird way, man.</p>
<p>I could just stare at them.</p>
<p>Like I have a 65 Corvette.</p>
<p>I walk around it sometimes at night when no one&rsquo;s around.</p>
<p>I just stare at it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite muscle car?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s your most bad ass late sixties,</p>
<p>the perfect car?</p>
<p>Probably that car.</p>
<p>Probably that 65 Corvette.</p>
<p>Yeah, I walk around it when no one&rsquo;s around.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve driven the 69 Corvette.</p>
<p>Is there a particular year that just?</p>
<p>65 is a generation two.</p>
<p>69 is generation three.</p>
<p>69 is like the, it&rsquo;s even more curvy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both awesome, just awesome in different ways.</p>
<p>But I just love muscle cars for whatever reason.</p>
<p>But the point is like, I like what I like.</p>
<p>And if I can do what I want to do,</p>
<p>I should do what I want to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not hurting anybody.</p>
<p>And the thing is like, I would do the Duncan podcast</p>
<p>if no one was listening, right?</p>
<p>If we were just starting to do a podcast together</p>
<p>and no one cared and it got like 2000 views,</p>
<p>which we did for years.</p>
<p>I would do it with Duncan and we would get high</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d talk crazy shit about aliens and spaceships</p>
<p>and maybe dude, maybe ideas are living life forms</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re inside your head.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how things get made.</p>
<p>Man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just kind of morphed me and him together in that</p>
<p>because the life form idea, life form idea is mine</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve really, I really think about a lot.</p>
<p>I think about on a technical side, by the way.</p>
<p>When I heard you say that, cause I&rsquo;ve been thinking,</p>
<p>I was like, whoa, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It might be, they might be alive</p>
<p>because they, I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck they are,</p>
<p>but when someone has an idea for, you know,</p>
<p>whatever an invention, a toaster,</p>
<p>and then they think about this,</p>
<p>all it need is like these heating elements and a spring</p>
<p>and then it pops on the stunts, have a timer.</p>
<p>And then they build this thing.</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden it&rsquo;s alive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you manifested it in a physical form.</p>
<p>Toaster is not the best example, but a car, an airplane,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about a thing,</p>
<p>like an idea comes into your head and you can say,</p>
<p>oh, well, it&rsquo;s just creativity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a part of being a person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we invented tools</p>
<p>and how, you know, we became better hunters.</p>
<p>All those things are true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that there&rsquo;s some magic to what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a possibility</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re simplifying something</p>
<p>by saying that it&rsquo;s just creativity,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just a natural human inclination to invent things.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Is it possible that ideas like creativity,</p>
<p>like we are the only animal other than,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few species that create things</p>
<p>like bees make beehives and, but it&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very uniform, you know, some animals use tools,</p>
<p>you know, like, you know,</p>
<p>champs will use like sticks to get termites</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about what we do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, it makes you wonder.</p>
<p>Cause we look at the, just look at this room that we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>look at all these electronics,</p>
<p>look at all this crazy shit that human beings have invented</p>
<p>and then built upon others inventions</p>
<p>and proved and innovated.</p>
<p>These all came out of ideas.</p>
<p>Like the idea, it germinates in someone&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>it bounces around, they write it down,</p>
<p>they share it with others,</p>
<p>the other people who have similar ideas</p>
<p>or ideas that are complimentary, they work together</p>
<p>and they change the world.</p>
<p>And the new thing in that is the idea is not the people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we think we found the ideas,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more like the ideas found us.</p>
<p>Find you, yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally in the air.</p>
<p>They come to you.</p>
<p>I always felt like that with bits.</p>
<p>Like when I come up with a bit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m always telling people</p>
<p>about the Steven Pressfield book, The War of Art,</p>
<p>because he talks about respecting the muse</p>
<p>and the idea that your ideas come when you sit down</p>
<p>and you do the work or you sit down like a professional</p>
<p>and you talk to the muse,</p>
<p>like come tell me what to do.</p>
<p>Like if the muse was a real thing,</p>
<p>as if the muse is like some mystical creature</p>
<p>that comes and delivers you ideas.</p>
<p>Even if that&rsquo;s not real, that&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>It does work like that.</p>
<p>If you do treat it like it&rsquo;s a muse</p>
<p>and you treat it with the respect</p>
<p>and you treat it like a professional,</p>
<p>the ideas do come to you.</p>
<p>I never thought about what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>is just sitting there waiting for the idea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to breed to find him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a trippy thing.</p>
<p>If you show up. That&rsquo;s trippy.</p>
<p>If you show up and put in the time</p>
<p>and focus your energy on that,</p>
<p>the ideas, they will arrive, they will arrive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the same with writing comedy.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s been many, many times</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ll come home from the comedy store</p>
<p>and I just sit down and I start writing</p>
<p>and I just, I got nothing, there&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just writing, it&rsquo;s all bullshit.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s just like, hmm.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, bam, there&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden I can&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>And then, you know, it was a couple hours later</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, whoa.</p>
<p>And then the next night I&rsquo;m on stage</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, how about that?</p>
<p>Boom, it gets this big laugh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, holy shit.</p>
<p>And I know that came out of the discipline</p>
<p>to sit down and call the muse.</p>
<p>I mean, the cool thing is the ideas have found you</p>
<p>to like, oh, I&rsquo;m gonna use this dude.</p>
<p>Like he seems to have a podcast that&rsquo;s popular.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna breed inside his brain and spread it to others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same as.</p>
<p>Or an inventor, you know, I&rsquo;m gonna use this guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like desperately seeking some sort of a product</p>
<p>to bring to market.</p>
<p>Some guy who wants to invent things,</p>
<p>is thinking about inventing things all the time.</p>
<p>These ideas, they weasel their way into your head.</p>
<p>And it seems to me also that the frequency</p>
<p>that your mind operates under has to be correct.</p>
<p>Because one of the things about creativity seems to be</p>
<p>if you think about yourself a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really into yourself or your image</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re selfish, those ideas are not,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t find you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>It stifles the creative.</p>
<p>Yeah, it stifles the opportunity</p>
<p>that the idea has to find you.</p>
<p>Yes, which is one of the reasons why joke thieves,</p>
<p>people that steal jokes are terrible writers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never like really good writers</p>
<p>who are also joke thieves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just joke thieves.</p>
<p>And then, you know, when they have to write on their own,</p>
<p>if they get exposed, they become terrible comedians.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a shadow of what they were</p>
<p>when they were stealing other people&rsquo;s ideas.</p>
<p>Because the thing that would make you steal</p>
<p>a person&rsquo;s idea is that ego part,</p>
<p>the like the wanting to claim it for yourself,</p>
<p>the wanting to be the man or the woman.</p>
<p>You know, I wanna be the person who gets out there</p>
<p>and says it and everybody&rsquo;s gonna love me for it.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t think like that and be creative.</p>
<p>It requires a humility and it requires a detachment</p>
<p>from self in order to create.</p>
<p>Like when I&rsquo;m writing, I&rsquo;m blank.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m just staring.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m just the part of my mind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s active is not like me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this weird core function part</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m not aware of my personality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to put it together</p>
<p>in a way that I know works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just being there, being present.</p>
<p>Pressfield is just, I&rsquo;m a big believer just sitting there</p>
<p>and staring at a blank page, putting in the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, and sometimes it&rsquo;s not that way.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s an inspiration.</p>
<p>Like sometimes I&rsquo;ll be sitting there at dinner</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be like, I got an idea.</p>
<p>And my wife&rsquo;s really cool about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I have an idea and I blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I have to just run out of the room real quick</p>
<p>and I write it down on my phone and then I can come back.</p>
<p>Because those are like little gifts</p>
<p>that you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhere.</p>
<p>And some people rely only on those gifts, you know?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked to comics about it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, I can&rsquo;t come up with my best ideas</p>
<p>when I don&rsquo;t write.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, I do too.</p>
<p>I come up with great ideas when I don&rsquo;t write,</p>
<p>but I also write.</p>
<p>Like you can do both of those things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>You mentioned fuck you money.</p>
<p>I feel like I have fuck you money now.</p>
<p>A year ago I was at zero, I have fuck you money now</p>
<p>because probably my standard is my,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need much in this world.</p>
<p>But because also, probably because of you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s 300 to 400,000 people.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t every episode I do.</p>
<p>And that is weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a successful television show on cable.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>But at this point, that also resulted in</p>
<p>a few money in a sense that I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need anything else in this world.</p>
<p>But so by way of asking, I&rsquo;ve looked up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve inspired me for a long time.</p>
<p>Do you have advice?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done this on the podcast side of life.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for somebody like,</p>
<p>for me and somebody like me going on this journey?</p>
<p>Eric Weinstein is going on this journey.</p>
<p>Is there advice, both small and big,</p>
<p>that you have for somebody like me?</p>
<p>The advice is to keep doing what feels right to you</p>
<p>and do what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s resonating with people</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting that big of an audience.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve listened to your podcast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very good at it.</p>
<p>So just keep doing it the way you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let anybody else get involved.</p>
<p>What about, you&rsquo;ve connected,</p>
<p>I think you met Jamie at the Comedy Store.</p>
<p>I met him at the Ice House.</p>
<p>At the Ice House?</p>
<p>Ice House.</p>
<p>Well, I think I met him at the Comedy Store,</p>
<p>but then we talked at the Ice House.</p>
<p>I mean, what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to ask him.</p>
<p>Yeah, did you think deeply about,</p>
<p>because you basically have nobody on your team.</p>
<p>And so it almost feels like a marriage.</p>
<p>Were you selective about somebody</p>
<p>to bring into your little circle?</p>
<p>Well, Jamie&rsquo;s exceptional.</p>
<p>He is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a special.</p>
<p>I mean, he might&rsquo;ve grown.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how he was in the early days.</p>
<p>Maybe you could say, but he&rsquo;s grown.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s definitely better at it,</p>
<p>but right away, he&rsquo;s exceptional.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got very little ego.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a guy who needs a lot of attention.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a guy who overestimates anything.</p>
<p>Like in terms of like a negative or positive,</p>
<p>like his interpretation of whether it&rsquo;s good things</p>
<p>that happen to the show or bad things that happen to the show,</p>
<p>he just takes it all like flat.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s chill.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just cool as fuck.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s so smart.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s so good as an audio engineer</p>
<p>and as a podcast producer, he&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s basically one of the only people</p>
<p>on this whole team.</p>
<p>So how do you find, I mean,</p>
<p>when you let people in,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure other people wanted to get involved.</p>
<p>Like, why don&rsquo;t you have a cohost that could,</p>
<p>you basically kind of, well.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the problem with the cohost.</p>
<p>Like when you and I are talking,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking, I&rsquo;m tuned in to you</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m waiting to hear what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m listening and I&rsquo;m interpreting it.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m calculating whether or not</p>
<p>I have anything to say, whether to let you keep talking,</p>
<p>whether I maybe have a question that lets you expand further</p>
<p>or whether I have a disagreement</p>
<p>or like there&rsquo;s a dance that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Now, when there&rsquo;s another person there chiming in too,</p>
<p>it fucks the dance up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like dancing.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re doing a dance with someone,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re slow dancing with someone</p>
<p>and then a third person&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>stepping on everybody&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Sometimes having a third person is fun.</p>
<p>Comedy podcasts, sometimes it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Fight companions, yeah, debate structures.</p>
<p>But even then it gets difficult</p>
<p>because people talk over each other.</p>
<p>And also I find that without headphones,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way easier to talk over each other.</p>
<p>You make mistakes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hear it the same way.</p>
<p>When you have headphones, I hear what you hear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all one sound and the audience hears exactly,</p>
<p>or rather I hear exactly what the audience hears.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s over here, my voice is louder than yours</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re over there.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t have headphones on, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not all together.</p>
<p>On that point, one of the interesting things about your show</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t almost never have done,</p>
<p>and you just generally don&rsquo;t do remote,</p>
<p>sorry, not remote calls,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t go to another person&rsquo;s location.</p>
<p>We have only done a few, a small handful.</p>
<p>And just like with Sapolsky, he should do this.</p>
<p>But I actually, we went back and forth on email.</p>
<p>I told him he needs to get his ass back in this studio.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s working on a book.</p>
<p>I was a fan of his a long time ago</p>
<p>because I became obsessed with toxoplasmosis.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve reached out to him a long time ago</p>
<p>before he was willing to do it.</p>
<p>But then I caught him in downtown LA.</p>
<p>He was there for something else.</p>
<p>And I just greedily snatched up an hour of his time.</p>
<p>Well, he doesn&rsquo;t get, I think, some of those folks</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get how much magic can happen in this podcast studio.</p>
<p>Like bigger than anything they&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>in terms of their work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about reach,</p>
<p>but in terms of the discovery of new ideas,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something magical about conversation.</p>
<p>Like somebody as brilliant as him,</p>
<p>if he gives himself over to the conversation</p>
<p>for multiple hours at a time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another place where you&rsquo;ve been an inspiration.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m getting more and more confidence</p>
<p>of telling people, like in Elon Musk,</p>
<p>that a lot of CEOs are like,</p>
<p>well, he has 30 minutes on his schedule.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, three hours.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re like, so some say no,</p>
<p>and then they come back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that started coming back to like,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re starting to get it.</p>
<p>They start to get it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re a rare beacon of hope in that sense</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some value in long form.</p>
<p>They think that nobody wants to listen</p>
<p>for more than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>They think like, I have nothing to say.</p>
<p>But the reality is if you just give yourself over</p>
<p>to like the three hours, just let it go,</p>
<p>three hours, four hours, whatever it is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much to discover</p>
<p>about what you didn&rsquo;t even know you think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to be confident that you could do it.</p>
<p>And in the beginning, I just did it</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And no one was listening.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always been a curious person.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always been interested in listening</p>
<p>to how people think about things</p>
<p>and talking to people about their mindset</p>
<p>and just expanding on my own ideas, just talking shit.</p>
<p>And so we would have these podcasts</p>
<p>and they would go on forever.</p>
<p>And my friend Ari, I never let this die down.</p>
<p>Never let him forget this.</p>
<p>He was always like, you have to edit your podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you right now, you&rsquo;re fucking up.</p>
<p>I go, why?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, because people are not gonna listen to it.</p>
<p>I go, they don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I go, you listen to part of it.</p>
<p>He goes, just do it.</p>
<p>Just, I&rsquo;m telling you, trust me,</p>
<p>cut it down to like 45 minutes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you need.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, no, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I go, I like listening to long form things.</p>
<p>No one has that kind of time.</p>
<p>I go, okay, I&rsquo;m just gonna keep doing it this way, so.</p>
<p>And it sticks to your gut.</p>
<p>No, he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>His are like two and a half hours long now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You won, but you wouldn&rsquo;t like say,</p>
<p>I mentioned to you this before, and this is gonna happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually made a lot of progress towards it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna talk to Putin,</p>
<p>but you wouldn&rsquo;t travel to Putin if you wanted to talk to you.</p>
<p>Putin is a dangerous character.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the thing with Jerry Kraft</p>
<p>where they stole his Super Bowl ring?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that was a little bit of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little bit.</p>
<p>He just decided he&rsquo;s gonna steal that Super Bowl ring.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>I think it was a&hellip;</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>Can I see your ring?</p>
<p>He shows him his ring and then he puts it on</p>
<p>and says, I can murder somebody with this ring.</p>
<p>So he&hellip;</p>
<p>And then he walks off with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible he did it as a,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a big believer in displays of power.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s possible he did that,</p>
<p>but I think he sees himself as like a tool</p>
<p>with which to demonstrate that Russia still belongs</p>
<p>on the stage of the big players.</p>
<p>And so he, a lot of actions are selected through that lens.</p>
<p>But in terms of a human being,</p>
<p>outside of any of the evils that he may or may not have done,</p>
<p>he is a really thoughtful, intelligent, fun human being.</p>
<p>Like the wit and the depth from the JRE perspective</p>
<p>is really interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like his manager now, selling the, he&rsquo;s a judo guy.</p>
<p>Trying to get Trump, he&rsquo;s really good at judo.</p>
<p>I have seen him practice judo.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a legit black belt.</p>
<p>And not only that, he loves it, not just skill wise,</p>
<p>but to talk about it, to reason about it,</p>
<p>to think about it, to MMA as well.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;d be a good conversation,</p>
<p>but you wouldn&rsquo;t travel to him.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, hold to your principle.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the core of the advice.</p>
<p>Just hold to whatever.</p>
<p>I would rather, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a person that I have to have on the show.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to talk to anybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just as happy to talk to you as I am to talk to Trump,</p>
<p>as I am to, probably more happy to talk to you,</p>
<p>as I am to talk to Mike Tyson, as I am to talk to Joey Diaz.</p>
<p>I like talking to people.</p>
<p>I enjoy doing podcasts.</p>
<p>I enjoy talking to a variety of people</p>
<p>and I schedule them based on, I want to like,</p>
<p>I try not to get too many right wing people in a row</p>
<p>or too many progressive people in a row.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get repetitive.</p>
<p>I try not to get too many fighters in a row.</p>
<p>I try to balance it out.</p>
<p>Not too many comedians.</p>
<p>Comedians are the one group where I can have three,</p>
<p>four in a row, five in a row.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s my tribe.</p>
<p>You know, those are my people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>We can talk about anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird dance.</p>
<p>You know, the conversations that you&rsquo;re doing on a podcast</p>
<p>are, they&rsquo;re a strange dance.</p>
<p>And you want to, you know,</p>
<p>you want to not step on your own feet</p>
<p>and you want to make sure that you do it in a way,</p>
<p>do the podcast in a way that&rsquo;s entertaining for people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s conversations are learning how to talk to people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird skill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird skill that took a long time</p>
<p>for me to get good at.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know it was a skill until I started doing it.</p>
<p>And then I just thought you were just talking.</p>
<p>Like, I know how to talk.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just talk to people.</p>
<p>And then along the way I realized like, oh,</p>
<p>and then when you talk to people that are bad at it,</p>
<p>you realize that it&rsquo;s a skill.</p>
<p>Like particularly one of the things about my people,</p>
<p>about comedians is a lot of them tend to want to talk,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t want to listen.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re waiting for you to stop talking so they can talk,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not necessarily thinking</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re saying, you know?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just waiting for their opportunity</p>
<p>or they talk over you or they,</p>
<p>and I try real hard not to do that and sometimes I fail,</p>
<p>but when I&rsquo;m at my best, I&rsquo;m dancing.</p>
<p>Yeah, ultimately the skill conversation</p>
<p>is just really listening, like really,</p>
<p>and listening and thinking.</p>
<p>Listening and thinking and being genuinely curious</p>
<p>and really having a take on what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>and maybe a followup question or maybe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be real, it&rsquo;s gotta be authentic.</p>
<p>And when it is authentic and it&rsquo;s real,</p>
<p>it resonates with people.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re listening and they go,</p>
<p>oh, like I&rsquo;m locked in with the way you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>Like you two guys are in a conversation and I&rsquo;m locked in.</p>
<p>When she talks and you listen, I&rsquo;m listening too.</p>
<p>When he says something to her</p>
<p>or when she says something to him,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a thing that happens during conversations</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re there, like you&rsquo;re listening to,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s with me, when I listen to a good podcast,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m in the room.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m in the room and I&rsquo;m like the friend</p>
<p>that got to sit down and listen.</p>
<p>Like, oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s a great conversation.</p>
<p>I love conversations.</p>
<p>So I love listening to them</p>
<p>and I love putting them together.</p>
<p>And the fact that this podcast has gotten so fucking big,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s stunning to me, it blows me away.</p>
<p>I never anticipated it.</p>
<p>Never thought for a second that that stupid thing</p>
<p>that I used to do in my couch, in my office</p>
<p>was the biggest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done in my life by far.</p>
<p>Like people used to make fun of it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a comedy store documentary that&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>and one of the parts of the documentary is my friend,</p>
<p>Tom Segura, when he first started doing my podcast,</p>
<p>he would be leaving and he would talk to Redband.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, what the fuck is he doing?</p>
<p>Like, why is he doing this?</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s listening?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh, some people like it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, fucking nonsense, waste of time.</p>
<p>And like in the documentary, it shows like 2000 views,</p>
<p>like one of the early Ustream episodes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t just like it,</p>
<p>really they form a friendship with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, even me when people come up to me,</p>
<p>like the love in their eyes is kind of beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a part of their life.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s also heartbreaking</p>
<p>because you realize you&rsquo;ll never really get to know them</p>
<p>back like, because they clearly are friends with you.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad to see a person who&rsquo;s clearly brilliant</p>
<p>and interesting and is friends with you,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t get a chance to return that love.</p>
<p>And I mean.</p>
<p>My kids, it took them a while to figure out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on, but people would come up to me</p>
<p>and they would say something like,</p>
<p>hey man, I fucking love you, thanks man.</p>
<p>All right, hey brother, nice to meet you.</p>
<p>My daughter was like six.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d be like, do you know him?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I don&rsquo;t know him.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, how does he know you?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s a very weird conversation I used to have</p>
<p>with young kids when I&rsquo;d explain,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d do this thing called the podcast</p>
<p>and millions of people listen.</p>
<p>So now one of my daughters is 12</p>
<p>and one of her friends is 13 and he&rsquo;s a boy</p>
<p>and he goes to school with her and he&rsquo;s obsessed with me.</p>
<p>And so she&rsquo;s weirded out.</p>
<p>And she says to him, I don&rsquo;t even think you like me.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re just into my dad, you fucking weirdo.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to have that conversation</p>
<p>in a few stages in her life.</p>
<p>Like that hard conversation with a boyfriend.</p>
<p>Yeah, probably, yeah.</p>
<p>That was the thing about men too.</p>
<p>This podcast is, my podcast is uniquely masculine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a man and I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m also a man</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have to go through some sort</p>
<p>of a corporate filter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going through executive producers</p>
<p>who tell me, don&rsquo;t have this guest on,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t talk about that.</p>
<p>We looked at focus groups and they don&rsquo;t seem to like</p>
<p>when you do this, like there&rsquo;s none of that.</p>
<p>And I just do it.</p>
<p>So I have a whole podcast where I just talk about cars</p>
<p>and people are like, I don&rsquo;t want to hear you</p>
<p>talk about cars.</p>
<p>Well, good, congratulations.</p>
<p>You found what you like.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s good news, there&rsquo;s 1500 other ones.</p>
<p>Go listen to the other episodes</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t talk about cars.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to listen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like your brand, you just are who you are</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s authentically what I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>All the podcasts, whether I&rsquo;m talking to David Fravor</p>
<p>about his experience with UFOs,</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m talking to David Sinclair about life extension,</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m talking to you about artificial intelligence</p>
<p>or what, it&rsquo;s because I want to talk to these people.</p>
<p>And that resonates.</p>
<p>I like when people are into shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this before,</p>
<p>things that I have no interest in making furniture,</p>
<p>but I like this PBS show where this guy</p>
<p>makes furniture by hand.</p>
<p>I love watching it.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s so into it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sanding this and polishing that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about furniture.</p>
<p>Furniture for me is function, like this desk.</p>
<p>Function works, but I love when people are into it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy that someone can make it and they do a great job,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not interested in the task</p>
<p>or even the finished product</p>
<p>as much as I&rsquo;m interested in someone&rsquo;s passion</p>
<p>for something.</p>
<p>The passion that they&rsquo;ve put into this, that shines through.</p>
<p>Last question.</p>
<p>I sometimes ask this just for to, what is it?</p>
<p>To challenge, to make people roll their eyes,</p>
<p>to make legitimate scientists roll their eyes.</p>
<p>Ask, what is the meaning of life, according to Joe Rogan?</p>
<p>I do not think there is a meaning.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s many, many meanings of life.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a way to navigate life that&rsquo;s enjoyable.</p>
<p>I think it requires many things.</p>
<p>It requires, first of all, it requires love.</p>
<p>You have to have loved ones.</p>
<p>You have to have family.</p>
<p>You have to have friends.</p>
<p>You have to have people that care about you</p>
<p>and you have to care about them.</p>
<p>I think that is primary.</p>
<p>Then it also requires interests.</p>
<p>There has to be things that stimulate you.</p>
<p>Now, it could be just a subsistence lifestyle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many people that believe and practice</p>
<p>this lifestyle of just living off the land</p>
<p>and hunting and fishing and living in the woods</p>
<p>and they seem incredibly happy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to be said for that.</p>
<p>That is an interest, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something and there&rsquo;s a direct connection</p>
<p>between their actions and their sustenance.</p>
<p>They get their food that way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re connected to nature</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very satisfying for them.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that, I think you need something</p>
<p>that is interesting to you,</p>
<p>something that you&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s far too many people that get sucked</p>
<p>into living a life where you&rsquo;re just doing a job,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just showing up and putting in your time</p>
<p>and then going home, but you don&rsquo;t have a passion</p>
<p>for what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the recipe for a boring</p>
<p>and very unfulfilling life.</p>
<p>You mentioned love, if we could just backtrack.</p>
<p>What, we talked about the demons</p>
<p>and the violence in there somewhere.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of love in this, in your own life?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important, man.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m so,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so interested in helping people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in people feeling good.</p>
<p>I like them to feel good.</p>
<p>I want to help them.</p>
<p>I like doing things that make them feel like,</p>
<p>oh, you care about me, like, yeah, I care about you.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>Like, I want people to feel good.</p>
<p>I want my family to feel good.</p>
<p>I want my friends to feel good.</p>
<p>I want guests to feel good about the podcast experience.</p>
<p>You know, I am, I&rsquo;m a big believer in as much as I can</p>
<p>to spread positive energy and joy and happiness</p>
<p>and relay all the good advice that I&rsquo;ve ever gotten.</p>
<p>All the things that I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>and if they can benefit people,</p>
<p>then I find that those things benefit people</p>
<p>that actually improve the quality of their life</p>
<p>or improve their success or improve their relationships.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy to do that.</p>
<p>That means a lot to me.</p>
<p>The way we interact with each other is so important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons why, like,</p>
<p>if someone gets canceled or you get publicly shamed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so devastating because there&rsquo;s all these people</p>
<p>that are negative, all this negative energy coming your way</p>
<p>and you feel it.</p>
<p>As much as I like to pretend that you&rsquo;re immune</p>
<p>to that kind of stuff</p>
<p>and some people do like to pretend that, you feel it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tangible force when people are upset at you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the same with loved ones or family</p>
<p>or anytime someone&rsquo;s upset at you,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a giant group of people</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a small amount of people.</p>
<p>That has an impact on you and your psyche</p>
<p>and your physical being.</p>
<p>So the more you can spread love</p>
<p>and the more love comes back to you,</p>
<p>you also create this butterfly effect, right?</p>
<p>Where other people start recognizing like,</p>
<p>oh, you know, when he is nice to me, I feel better</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna be nicer to people.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m nicer to people, they feel better</p>
<p>and I feel better and it spreads outward.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one thing that I&rsquo;ve done through this podcast,</p>
<p>I think, is I&rsquo;ve imparted my personal philosophy</p>
<p>in kindness and generosity to other people.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, to correct you, you didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>The ideas that are breeding themselves through your brain</p>
<p>have figured out.</p>
<p>Yes, the ideas that are alive in the air</p>
<p>that made their way into my head.</p>
<p>Love is a more efficient mechanism of spreading ideas.</p>
<p>They figured out.</p>
<p>Yes, probably, man.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>So as far as like the meaning of life,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a bit, without that, you have nothing.</p>
<p>You know, one of the biggest failures in life</p>
<p>is to be extremely successful financially,</p>
<p>but everybody hates you.</p>
<p>Everybody hates you and you&rsquo;re just miserable</p>
<p>and alone and angry and depressed and sad.</p>
<p>You know, when you hear about rich, famous people</p>
<p>that commit suicide, like, wow, you missed the mark.</p>
<p>You got some parts right,</p>
<p>but you put too many eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>You put too many eggs in the financial basket</p>
<p>or the success basket or the accomplishment basket</p>
<p>and not enough in the friendship and love basket.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a balance to that.</p>
<p>And when I talked about the violence and all that stuff,</p>
<p>like that to me is me understanding, recognizing that</p>
<p>is me trying to achieve that balance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to like go kill those demons</p>
<p>so that this boat is level, you know,</p>
<p>because if it&rsquo;s not, then the boat is like this</p>
<p>and then everything&rsquo;s all fucked up.</p>
<p>And every time we hit a wave, things fall apart.</p>
<p>Balance that boat out, figure it out, like know who you are.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t have that problem at all.</p>
<p>Some people, they could just go for walks</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re cool as a cucumber.</p>
<p>I need more, you know, I need kettlebells.</p>
<p>I need a heavy bag.</p>
<p>I need the Echo bike, you know, the Air Assault bike.</p>
<p>I need some hardcore shit.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t get that, I don&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>So I figured that out too.</p>
<p>And that makes me a nicer person.</p>
<p>That makes my interactions nicer.</p>
<p>It changes the quality of my friendships</p>
<p>and my relationships with people.</p>
<p>I think we mentioned Neuralink.</p>
<p>I can certainly guarantee that this is one of the memories</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be replaying 20, 30 years from now</p>
<p>once we get the feature ready.</p>
<p>Joe, it&rsquo;s a huge honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>I hope. It&rsquo;s an honor</p>
<p>to talk to you too, man.</p>

<p>I hope you make Texas cool again</p>
<p>and do your podcast another 10, 11, whatever,</p>
<p>however many years you&rsquo;re still on this earth.</p>
