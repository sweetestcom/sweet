    <p>The following is a conversation with Kamran Valfa,</p>
<p>a theoretical physicist at Harvard</p>
<p>specializing in string theory.</p>
<p>He is the winner of the 2017 Breakthrough Prize</p>
<p>in Fundamental Physics,</p>
<p>which is the most lucrative academic prize in the world.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Headspace, Jordan Harmer&rsquo;s show,</p>
<p>Squarespace, and Allform.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that string theory</p>
<p>is a theory of quantum gravity</p>
<p>that unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity.</p>
<p>It says that quarks, electrons, and all other particles</p>
<p>are made up of much tinier strings of vibrating energy.</p>
<p>They vibrate in 10 or more dimensions,</p>
<p>depending on the flavor of the theory.</p>
<p>Different vibrating patterns result in different particles.</p>
<p>From its origins, for a long time,</p>
<p>string theory was seen as too good not to be true,</p>
<p>but has recently fallen out of favor</p>
<p>in the physics community,</p>
<p>partly because over the past 40 years,</p>
<p>it has not been able to make any novel predictions</p>
<p>that could then be validated through experiment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to this day,</p>
<p>it remains one of our best candidates</p>
<p>for a theory of everything,</p>
<p>or a theory that unifies the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Let me mention that a similar story happened</p>
<p>with neural networks</p>
<p>in the field of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>where it fell out of favor</p>
<p>after decades of promise and research,</p>
<p>but found success again in the past decade</p>
<p>as part of the deep learning revolution.</p>
<p>So I think it pays to keep an open mind,</p>
<p>since we don&rsquo;t know which of the ideas in physics</p>
<p>may be brought back decades later</p>
<p>and be found to solve the biggest mysteries</p>
<p>in theoretical physics.</p>
<p>String theory still has that promise.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s my conversation with Kamran Wafa.</p>
<p>What is the difference between mathematics</p>
<p>and physics?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a difficult question,</p>
<p>because in many ways,</p>
<p>math and physics are unified in many ways.</p>
<p>So to distinguish them is not an easy task.</p>
<p>I would say that perhaps the goals</p>
<p>of math and physics are different.</p>
<p>Math does not care to describe reality, physics does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the major difference.</p>
<p>But a lot of the thoughts, processes, and so on,</p>
<p>which goes to understanding the nature and reality,</p>
<p>are the same things that mathematicians do.</p>
<p>So in many ways, they are similar.</p>
<p>Mathematicians care about deductive reasoning,</p>
<p>and physicists or physics in general,</p>
<p>we care less about that.</p>
<p>We care more about interconnection of ideas,</p>
<p>about how ideas support each other,</p>
<p>or if there&rsquo;s a puzzle, discord between ideas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more interesting for us.</p>
<p>And part of the reason is that we have learned in physics</p>
<p>that the ideas are not sequential.</p>
<p>And if we think that there&rsquo;s one idea</p>
<p>which is more important,</p>
<p>and we start with there and go to the next idea,</p>
<p>and next one, and deduce things from that,</p>
<p>like mathematicians do,</p>
<p>we have learned that the third or fourth thing</p>
<p>we deduce from that principle</p>
<p>turns out later on to be the actual principle.</p>
<p>And from a different perspective,</p>
<p>starting from there leads to new ideas,</p>
<p>which the original one didn&rsquo;t lead to,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the beginning of a new revolution in science.</p>
<p>So this kind of thing we have seen again and again</p>
<p>in the history of science,</p>
<p>we have learned to not like deductive reasoning</p>
<p>because that gives us a bad starting point,</p>
<p>to think that we actually have the original thought process</p>
<p>should be viewed as the primary thought,</p>
<p>and all these are deductions,</p>
<p>like the way mathematicians sometimes do.</p>
<p>So in physics, we have learned to be skeptical</p>
<p>of that way of thinking.</p>
<p>We have to be a bit open to the possibility</p>
<p>that what we thought is a deduction of a hypothesis</p>
<p>is actually the reason that&rsquo;s true is the opposite.</p>
<p>And so we reverse the order.</p>
<p>And so this switching back and forth between ideas</p>
<p>makes us more fluid about deductive fashion.</p>
<p>Of course, it sometimes gives a wrong impression</p>
<p>like physicists don&rsquo;t care about rigor.</p>
<p>They just say random things.</p>
<p>They are willing to say things that are not backed</p>
<p>by the logical reasoning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true at all.</p>
<p>So despite this fluidity</p>
<p>in saying which one is a primary thought,</p>
<p>we are very careful about trying to understand</p>
<p>what we have really understood in terms of relationship</p>
<p>between ideas.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important ingredient.</p>
<p>And in fact, solid math, being behind physics</p>
<p>is I think one of the attractive features</p>
<p>of a physical law.</p>
<p>So we look for beautiful math underpinning it.</p>
<p>Can we dig into that process of starting from one place</p>
<p>and then ending up at like the fourth step</p>
<p>and realizing all along that the place you started at</p>
<p>was wrong?</p>
<p>So is that happened when there&rsquo;s a discrepancy</p>
<p>between what the math says</p>
<p>and what the physical world shows?</p>
<p>Is that how you then can go back</p>
<p>and do the revolutionary idea</p>
<p>for different starting place altogether?</p>
<p>Perhaps I give an example to see how it goes.</p>
<p>And in fact, the historical example is Newton&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>on classical mechanics.</p>
<p>So Newton formulated the laws of mechanics,</p>
<p>the force F equals to MA and his other laws,</p>
<p>and they look very simple, elegant, and so forth.</p>
<p>Later, when we studied more examples of mechanics</p>
<p>and other similar things, physicists came up with the idea</p>
<p>that the notion of potential is interesting.</p>
<p>Potential was an abstract idea, which kind of came,</p>
<p>you could take its gradient and relate it to the force.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t really need it a priori,</p>
<p>but it solved, helped some thoughts.</p>
<p>And then later, Euler and Lagrange reformulated</p>
<p>Newtonian mechanics in a totally different way</p>
<p>in the following fashion.</p>
<p>They said, if you take,</p>
<p>if you wanna know where a particle at this point</p>
<p>and at this time, how does it get to this point</p>
<p>at the later time, is the following.</p>
<p>You take all possible paths connecting this particle</p>
<p>from going from the initial point to the final point,</p>
<p>and you compute the action.</p>
<p>And what is an action?</p>
<p>Action is the integral over time</p>
<p>of the kinetic term of the particle minus its potential.</p>
<p>So you take this integral,</p>
<p>and each path will give you some quantity.</p>
<p>And the path it actually takes, the physical path,</p>
<p>is the one which minimizes this integral or this action.</p>
<p>Now, this sounded like a backward step from Newton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s formula seemed very simple.</p>
<p>F equals to ma, and you can write F is minus</p>
<p>the gradient of the potential.</p>
<p>So why would anybody start formulating such a simple thing</p>
<p>in terms of this complicated looking principle?</p>
<p>You have to study the space of all paths and all things</p>
<p>and find the minimum, and then you get the same equation.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>So Euler and Lagrange&rsquo;s formulation of Newton,</p>
<p>which was kind of recasting in this language,</p>
<p>is just a consequence of Newton&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>F equals to ma gives you the same fact</p>
<p>that this path is a minimum action.</p>
<p>Now, what we learned later, last century,</p>
<p>was that when we deal with quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s law is only an average correct.</p>
<p>And the particle going from one to the other</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t take exactly one path.</p>
<p>It takes all the paths with the amplitude,</p>
<p>which is proportional to the exponential</p>
<p>of the action times an imaginary number, i.</p>
<p>And so this fact turned out to be the reformulation</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>We should start there as the basis of the new law,</p>
<p>which is quantum mechanics, and Newton is only</p>
<p>an approximation on the average correct.</p>
<p>And when you say amplitude, you mean probability?</p>
<p>Yes, the amplitude means if you sum up all these paths</p>
<p>with exponential i times the action,</p>
<p>if you sum this up, you get the number, complex number.</p>
<p>You square the norm of this complex number,</p>
<p>gives you a probability to go from one to the other.</p>
<p>Is there ways in which mathematics can lead us astray</p>
<p>when we use it as a tool to understand the physical world?</p>
<p>Yes, I would say that mathematics can lead us astray</p>
<p>as much as old physical ideas can lead us astray.</p>
<p>So if you get stuck in something,</p>
<p>then you can easily fool yourself</p>
<p>that just like the thought process,</p>
<p>we have to free ourselves of that.</p>
<p>Sometimes math does that role, like say,</p>
<p>oh, this is such a beautiful math.</p>
<p>I definitely want to use it somewhere.</p>
<p>And so you just get carried away</p>
<p>and you just get maybe carried too far away.</p>
<p>So that is certainly true, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more dangerous than old physical ideas.</p>
<p>To me, new math ideas is as much potential</p>
<p>to lead us astray as old physical ideas,</p>
<p>which could be long held principles of physics.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just saying that we should keep an open mind</p>
<p>about the role the math plays,</p>
<p>not to be antagonistic towards it</p>
<p>and not to over, over welcoming it.</p>
<p>We should just be open to possibilities.</p>
<p>What about looking at a particular characteristics</p>
<p>of both physical ideas and mathematical ideas,</p>
<p>which is beauty?</p>
<p>You think beauty leads us astray, meaning,</p>
<p>and you offline showed me a really nice puzzle</p>
<p>that illustrates this idea a little bit.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you can speak to that or another example</p>
<p>where beauty makes it tempting for us to assume</p>
<p>that the law and the theory we found</p>
<p>is actually one that perfectly describes reality.</p>
<p>I think that beauty does not lead us astray</p>
<p>because I feel that beauty is a requirement</p>
<p>for principles of physics.</p>
<p>So beauty is a fundamental in the universe?</p>
<p>I think beauty is fundamental.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the way many of us view it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not emergent.</p>
<p>I think Hardy is the mathematician who said</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no permanent place for ugly mathematics.</p>
<p>And so I think the same is true in physics</p>
<p>that if we find the principle which looks ugly,</p>
<p>we are not going to be, that&rsquo;s not the end stage.</p>
<p>So therefore beauty is going to lead us somewhere.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t mean beauty is enough.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean if you just have beauty,</p>
<p>if I just look at something is beautiful, then I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>Beauty is certainly a criteria that every good</p>
<p>physical theory should pass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at least the view we have.</p>
<p>Why do we have this view?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>It is partly, you could say, based on experience</p>
<p>of science over centuries, partly is philosophical view</p>
<p>of what reality is or should be.</p>
<p>And in principle, it could have been ugly</p>
<p>and we might have had to deal with it,</p>
<p>but we have gotten maybe confident through examples</p>
<p>in the history of science to look for beauty.</p>
<p>And our sense of beauty seems to incorporate</p>
<p>a lot of things that are essential for us</p>
<p>to solve some difficult problems like symmetry.</p>
<p>We find symmetry beautiful</p>
<p>and the breaking of symmetry beautiful.</p>
<p>Somehow symmetry is a fundamental part</p>
<p>of how we conceive of beauty at all layers of reality,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>Like in both the visual space, like the way we look at art,</p>
<p>we look at each other as human beings,</p>
<p>the way we look at creatures in the biological space,</p>
<p>the way we look at chemistry,</p>
<p>and then into the physics world as the work you do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder like,</p>
<p>which one is the chicken or the egg?</p>
<p>Is symmetry the chicken and our conception of beauty</p>
<p>the egg or the other way around?</p>
<p>Or somehow the fact that the symmetry is part of reality,</p>
<p>it somehow creates a brain that then is able to perceive it.</p>
<p>Or maybe this is just because we,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s so obvious, it&rsquo;s almost trivial,</p>
<p>that symmetry, of course,</p>
<p>will be part of every kind of universe that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And then any kind of organism that&rsquo;s able to observe</p>
<p>that universe is going to appreciate symmetry.</p>
<p>Well, these are good questions.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a deep understanding</p>
<p>of why we get attracted to symmetry.</p>
<p>Why do laws of nature seem to have symmetries underlying</p>
<p>them and the reasoning or the examples of whether,</p>
<p>if there wasn&rsquo;t symmetry,</p>
<p>we would have understood it or not.</p>
<p>We could have said that, yeah, if there were, you know,</p>
<p>things which didn&rsquo;t look that great,</p>
<p>we could understand them.</p>
<p>For example, we know that symmetries get broken</p>
<p>and we have appreciated nature</p>
<p>in the broken symmetry phase as well.</p>
<p>The world we live in has many things</p>
<p>which do not look symmetric,</p>
<p>but even those have underlying symmetry</p>
<p>when you look at it more deeply.</p>
<p>So we have gotten maybe spoiled perhaps</p>
<p>by the appearance of symmetry all over the place.</p>
<p>And we look for it.</p>
<p>And I think this is perhaps related to a sense of aesthetics</p>
<p>that scientists have.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t usually talk about it among scientists.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s kind of a philosophical view</p>
<p>of why do we look for simplicity or beauty or so forth.</p>
<p>And I think in a sense, scientists are a lot</p>
<p>like philosophers.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think, especially modern science</p>
<p>seems to shun philosophers and philosophical views.</p>
<p>And I think at their peril, I think in my view,</p>
<p>science owes a lot to philosophy.</p>
<p>And in my view, many scientists, in fact,</p>
<p>probably all good scientists</p>
<p>are perhaps amateur philosophers.</p>
<p>They may not state that they are philosophers</p>
<p>or they may not like to be labeled philosophers,</p>
<p>but in many ways what they do</p>
<p>is like what is philosophical takes of things.</p>
<p>Looking for simplicity or symmetry</p>
<p>is an example of that in my opinion, or seeing patterns.</p>
<p>You see, for example, another example of the symmetry</p>
<p>is like how you come up with new ideas in science.</p>
<p>You see, for example, an idea A</p>
<p>is connected with an idea B.</p>
<p>Okay, so you study this connection very deeply.</p>
<p>And then you find the cousin of an idea A,</p>
<p>let me call it A prime.</p>
<p>And then you immediately look for B prime.</p>
<p>If A is like B and if there&rsquo;s an A prime,</p>
<p>then you look for B prime.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, it completes the picture.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s philosophically appealing</p>
<p>to have more balance in terms of that.</p>
<p>And then you look for B prime and lo and behold,</p>
<p>you find this other phenomenon,</p>
<p>which is a physical phenomenon, which you call B prime.</p>
<p>So this kind of thinking motivates</p>
<p>asking questions and looking for things.</p>
<p>And it has guided scientists, I think, through many centuries</p>
<p>and I think it continues to do so today.</p>
<p>And I think if you look at the long arc of history,</p>
<p>I suspect that the things that will be remembered</p>
<p>is the philosophical flavor of the ideas of physics</p>
<p>and chemistry and computer science and mathematics.</p>
<p>Like, I think the actual details</p>
<p>will be shown to be incomplete or maybe wrong,</p>
<p>but the philosophical intuitions</p>
<p>will carry through much longer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which, if it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t figured out most of how things work,</p>
<p>currently, that it&rsquo;ll all be shown as wrong and silly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d almost be a historical artifact.</p>
<p>But the human spirit, whatever,</p>
<p>like the longing to understand,</p>
<p>the way we perceive the world, the way we conceive of it,</p>
<p>of our place in the world, those ideas will carry on.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>In fact, I believe that almost,</p>
<p>well, I believe that none of the principles</p>
<p>or laws of physics we know today are exactly correct.</p>
<p>All of them are approximations to something.</p>
<p>They are better than the previous versions that we had,</p>
<p>but none of them are exactly correct,</p>
<p>and none of them are gonna stand forever.</p>
<p>So I agree that that&rsquo;s the process we are heading,</p>
<p>we are improving.</p>
<p>And yes, indeed, the thought process</p>
<p>and that philosophical take is common.</p>
<p>So when we look at older scientists,</p>
<p>or maybe even all the way back to Greek philosophers</p>
<p>and the things that the way they thought and so on,</p>
<p>almost everything they said about nature was incorrect.</p>
<p>But the way they thought about it</p>
<p>and many things that they were thinking</p>
<p>is still valid today.</p>
<p>For example, they thought about symmetry breaking.</p>
<p>They were trying to explain the following.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful example, I think.</p>
<p>They had figured out that the Earth is round,</p>
<p>and they said, okay, Earth is round.</p>
<p>They have seen the length of the shadow of a meter stick,</p>
<p>and they have seen that if you go</p>
<p>from the equator upwards north,</p>
<p>they find that depending on how far away you are,</p>
<p>that the length of the shadow changes.</p>
<p>And from that, they had even measured</p>
<p>the radius of the Earth to good accuracy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant, by the way, the fact that they did that.</p>
<p>Very brilliant, very brilliant.</p>
<p>So these Greek philosophers are very smart.</p>
<p>And so they had taken it to the next step.</p>
<p>They asked, okay, so the Earth is round,</p>
<p>why doesn&rsquo;t it move?</p>
<p>They thought it doesn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>They were looking around, nothing seemed to move.</p>
<p>So they said, okay, we have to have a good explanation.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough for them to be there.</p>
<p>So they really wanna deeply understand that fact.</p>
<p>And they come up with a symmetry argument.</p>
<p>And the symmetry argument was,</p>
<p>oh, if the Earth is a spherical,</p>
<p>it must be at the center of the universe for sure.</p>
<p>So they said the Earth is at the center of the universe.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>And they said, if the Earth is going to move,</p>
<p>which direction does it pick?</p>
<p>Any direction it picks, it breaks that spherical symmetry</p>
<p>because you have to pick a direction.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not good because it&rsquo;s not symmetrical anymore.</p>
<p>So therefore, the Earth decides to sit put</p>
<p>because it would break the symmetry.</p>
<p>So they had the incorrect science.</p>
<p>They thought Earth doesn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>But they had this beautiful idea</p>
<p>that symmetry might explain it.</p>
<p>But they were even smarter than that.</p>
<p>Aristotle didn&rsquo;t agree with this argument.</p>
<p>He said, why do you think symmetry prevents it from moving?</p>
<p>Because the preferred position?</p>
<p>Not so.</p>
<p>He gave an example.</p>
<p>He said, suppose you are a person</p>
<p>and we put you at the center of a circle</p>
<p>and we spread food around you on a circle around you,</p>
<p>loaves of bread, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And we say, okay, stay at the center of the circle forever.</p>
<p>Are you going to do that</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s a symmetric point?</p>
<p>No, you are going to get hungry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to move towards one of those loaves of bread,</p>
<p>despite the fact that it breaks the symmetry.</p>
<p>So from this way, he tried to argue</p>
<p>being at the symmetric point</p>
<p>may not be the preferred thing to do.</p>
<p>And this idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking</p>
<p>is something we just use today</p>
<p>to describe many physical phenomena.</p>
<p>So spontaneous symmetry breaking</p>
<p>is the feature that we now use.</p>
<p>But this idea was there thousands of years ago,</p>
<p>but applied incorrectly to the physical world,</p>
<p>but now we are using it.</p>
<p>So these ideas are coming back in different forms.</p>
<p>So I agree very much that the thought process</p>
<p>is more important and these ideas are more interesting</p>
<p>than the actual applications that people may find today.</p>
<p>Did they use the language of symmetry</p>
<p>and the symmetry breaking and spontaneous symmetry breaking?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Because I could see a conception of the universe</p>
<p>that kind of tends towards perfect symmetry</p>
<p>and is stuck there, not stuck there,</p>
<p>but achieves that optimal and stays there.</p>
<p>The idea that you would spontaneously</p>
<p>break out of symmetry, like have these perturbations,</p>
<p>like jump out of symmetry and back,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really difficult idea to load into your head.</p>
<p>Like where does that come from?</p>
<p>And then the idea that you may not be</p>
<p>at the center of the universe.</p>
<p>That is a really tough idea.</p>
<p>Right, so symmetry sometimes is an explanation</p>
<p>of being at the symmetric point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes a simple explanation of many things.</p>
<p>Like if you have a bowl, a circular bowl,</p>
<p>then the bottom of it is the lowest point.</p>
<p>So if you put a pebble or something,</p>
<p>it will slide down and go there at the bottom</p>
<p>and stays there at the symmetric point</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the preferred point, the lowest energy point.</p>
<p>But if that same symmetric circular bowl that you had</p>
<p>had a bump on the bottom, the bottom might not be</p>
<p>at the center, it might be on a circle on the table,</p>
<p>in which case the pebble would not end up at the center,</p>
<p>it would be the lower energy point.</p>
<p>Symmetrical, but it breaks the symmetry</p>
<p>once it takes a point on that circle.</p>
<p>So we can have symmetry reasoning for where things end up</p>
<p>or symmetry breakings, like this example would suggest.</p>
<p>We talked about beauty.</p>
<p>I find geometry to be beautiful.</p>
<p>You have a few examples that are geometric</p>
<p>in nature in your book.</p>
<p>How can geometry in ancient times or today</p>
<p>be used to understand reality?</p>
<p>And maybe how do you think about geometry</p>
<p>as a distinct tool in mathematics and physics?</p>
<p>Yes, geometry is my favorite part of math as well.</p>
<p>And Greeks were enamored by geometry.</p>
<p>They tried to describe physical reality using geometry</p>
<p>and principles of geometry and symmetry.</p>
<p>Platonic solids, the five solids they had discovered</p>
<p>had these beautiful solids.</p>
<p>They thought it must be good for some reality.</p>
<p>There must be explaining something.</p>
<p>They attached one to air, one to fire and so forth.</p>
<p>They tried to give physical reality to symmetric objects.</p>
<p>These symmetric objects are symmetries of rotation</p>
<p>and discrete symmetry groups we call today</p>
<p>of rotation group in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Now, we know now, we kind of laugh at the way</p>
<p>they were trying to connect that symmetry</p>
<p>to the laws of the realities of physics.</p>
<p>But actually it turns out in modern days,</p>
<p>we use symmetries in not too far away</p>
<p>exactly in these kinds of thoughts processes</p>
<p>in the following way.</p>
<p>In the context of string theory,</p>
<p>which is the field light study,</p>
<p>we have these extra dimensions.</p>
<p>And these extra dimensions are compact tiny spaces typically</p>
<p>but they have different shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>We have learned that if these extra shapes and sizes</p>
<p>have symmetries, which are related</p>
<p>to the same rotation symmetries</p>
<p>that the Greek we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>if they enjoy those discrete symmetries</p>
<p>and if you take that symmetry and caution the space by it,</p>
<p>in other words, identify points under these symmetries,</p>
<p>you get properties of that space at the singular points</p>
<p>which force emanates from them.</p>
<p>What forces?</p>
<p>Forces like the ones we have seen in nature today,</p>
<p>like electric forces, like strong forces, like weak forces.</p>
<p>So these same principles that were driving them</p>
<p>to connect geometry and symmetries to nature</p>
<p>is driving today&rsquo;s physics,</p>
<p>now much more modern ideas, but nevertheless,</p>
<p>the symmetries connecting geometry to physics.</p>
<p>In fact, often sometimes we ask the following question,</p>
<p>suppose I want to get this particular physical reality,</p>
<p>I wanna have this particles with these forces and so on,</p>
<p>what do I do?</p>
<p>It turns out that you can geometrically design</p>
<p>the space to give you that.</p>
<p>You say, oh, I put the sphere here, I will do this,</p>
<p>I will shrink them.</p>
<p>So if you have two spheres touching each other</p>
<p>and shrinking to zero size, that gives you strong forces.</p>
<p>If you have one of them, it gives you the weak forces.</p>
<p>If you have this, you get that.</p>
<p>And if you want to unify forces, do the other thing.</p>
<p>So these geometrical translation of physics</p>
<p>is one of my favorite things that we have discovered</p>
<p>in modern physics and the context of string theory.</p>
<p>The sad thing is when you go into multiple dimensions</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about it is we start to lose our capacity</p>
<p>to visually intuit the world we&rsquo;re discussing.</p>
<p>And then we go into the realm of mathematics</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll lose that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our brains are such that we&rsquo;re limited.</p>
<p>But before we go into that mysterious, beautiful world,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a small step back.</p>
<p>And you also in your book have this kind of</p>
<p>through the space of puzzles, through the space of ideas,</p>
<p>have a brief history of physics, of physical ideas.</p>
<p>Now, we talked about Newtonian mechanics leading all</p>
<p>through different Lagrangian, Hamiltonian mechanics.</p>
<p>Can you describe some of the key ideas</p>
<p>in the history of physics?</p>
<p>Maybe lingering on each from electromagnetism to relativity</p>
<p>to quantum mechanics and to today,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ll talk about with quantum gravity and string theory.</p>
<p>Sure, so I mentioned the classical mechanics</p>
<p>and the Euler Lagrangian formulation.</p>
<p>One of the next important milestones for physics</p>
<p>were the discoveries of laws of electricity and magnetism.</p>
<p>So Maxwell put the discoveries all together</p>
<p>in the context of what we call the Maxwell&rsquo;s equations.</p>
<p>And he noticed that when he put these discoveries</p>
<p>that Faraday&rsquo;s and others had made about electric</p>
<p>and magnetic phenomena in terms of mathematical equations,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t quite work.</p>
<p>There was a mathematical inconsistency.</p>
<p>Now, one could have had two attitudes.</p>
<p>One would say, okay, who cares about math?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing nature, electric force, magnetic force,</p>
<p>math I don&rsquo;t care about.</p>
<p>But it bothered him.</p>
<p>It was inconsistent.</p>
<p>The equations he were writing, the two equations</p>
<p>he had written down did not agree with each other.</p>
<p>And this bothered him, but he figured out,</p>
<p>if you add this jiggle, this equation</p>
<p>by adding one little term there, it works.</p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s consistent.</p>
<p>What is the motivation for that term?</p>
<p>He said, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Have we seen it in experiments?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Why did you add it?</p>
<p>Well, because of mathematical consistency.</p>
<p>So he said, okay, math forced him to do this term.</p>
<p>He added this term, which we now today call the Maxwell term.</p>
<p>And once he added that term, his equations were nice,</p>
<p>differential equations, mathematically consistent,</p>
<p>beautiful, but he also found the new physical phenomena.</p>
<p>He found that because of that term,</p>
<p>he could now get electric and magnetic waves</p>
<p>moving through space at a speed that he could calculate.</p>
<p>So he calculated the speed of the wave</p>
<p>and lo and behold, he found it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>as the speed of light, which puzzled him</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t think light had anything</p>
<p>to do with electricity and magnetism.</p>
<p>But then he was courageous enough to say,</p>
<p>well, maybe light is nothing</p>
<p>but these electric and magnetic fields moving around.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t alive to see the verification</p>
<p>of that prediction and indeed it was true.</p>
<p>So this mathematical inconsistency,</p>
<p>which we could say this mathematical beauty drove him</p>
<p>to this physical, very important connection</p>
<p>between light and electric and magnetic phenomena,</p>
<p>which was later confirmed.</p>
<p>So then physics progresses and it comes to Einstein.</p>
<p>Einstein looks at Maxwell&rsquo;s equation,</p>
<p>says, beautiful, these are nice equation,</p>
<p>except we get one speed light.</p>
<p>Who measures this light speed?</p>
<p>And he asked the question, are you moving?</p>
<p>Are you not moving?</p>
<p>If you move, the speed of light changes,</p>
<p>but Maxwell&rsquo;s equation has no hint</p>
<p>of different speeds of light.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say, oh, only if you&rsquo;re not moving,</p>
<p>you get the speed, it&rsquo;s just you always get the speed.</p>
<p>So Einstein was very puzzled and he was daring enough</p>
<p>to say, well, you know, maybe everybody gets</p>
<p>the same speed for light.</p>
<p>And that motivated his theory of special relativity.</p>
<p>And this is an interesting example</p>
<p>because the idea was motivated from physics,</p>
<p>from Maxwell&rsquo;s equations, from the fact</p>
<p>that people try to measure the properties of ether,</p>
<p>which was supposed to be the medium</p>
<p>in which the light travels through.</p>
<p>And the idea was that only in that medium,</p>
<p>the speed of, if you&rsquo;re at risk with respect</p>
<p>to the ether, the speed, the speed of light,</p>
<p>then if you&rsquo;re moving, the speed changes</p>
<p>and people did not discover it.</p>
<p>Michelson and Morley&rsquo;s experiment showed there&rsquo;s no ether.</p>
<p>So then Einstein was courageous enough to say,</p>
<p>you know, light is the same speed for everybody,</p>
<p>regardless of whether you&rsquo;re moving or not.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is about special theory</p>
<p>of relativity is that the math underpinning it</p>
<p>is very simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a linear algebra, nothing terribly deep.</p>
<p>You can teach it at a high school level, if not earlier.</p>
<p>Okay, does that mean Einstein&rsquo;s special relativity</p>
<p>is boring?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>So this is an example where simple math, you know,</p>
<p>linear algebra leads to deep physics.</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s theory of special relativity.</p>
<p>Motivated by this inconsistency that Maxwell&rsquo;s equation</p>
<p>would suggest for the speed of light,</p>
<p>depending on who observes it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most daring idea there,</p>
<p>that the speed of light could be the same everywhere?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic, that&rsquo;s the guts of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the core of Einstein&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>That statement underlies the whole thing.</p>
<p>Speed of light is the same for everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to swallow and it doesn&rsquo;t sound right.</p>
<p>It sounds completely wrong on the face of it.</p>
<p>And it took Einstein to make this daring statement.</p>
<p>It would be laughing in some sense.</p>
<p>How could anybody make this possibly ridiculous claim?</p>
<p>And it turned out to be true.</p>
<p>How does that make you feel?</p>
<p>Because it still sounds ridiculous.</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculous until you learn</p>
<p>that our intuition is at fault</p>
<p>about the way we conceive of space and time.</p>
<p>The way we think about space and time is wrong</p>
<p>because we think about the nature of time as absolute.</p>
<p>And part of it is because we live in a situation</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t go with very high speeds.</p>
<p>There are speeds that are small</p>
<p>compared to the speed of light.</p>
<p>And therefore the phenomena we observe</p>
<p>does not distinguish the relativity of time.</p>
<p>The time also depends on who measures it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no absolute time.</p>
<p>When you say it&rsquo;s noon today and now,</p>
<p>it depends on who&rsquo;s measuring it.</p>
<p>And not everybody would agree with that statement.</p>
<p>And to see that you would have to have fast observer</p>
<p>moving speeds close to the speed of light.</p>
<p>So this shows that our intuition is at fault.</p>
<p>And a lot of the discoveries in physics</p>
<p>precisely is getting rid of the wrong old intuition.</p>
<p>And it is funny because we get rid of it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always lingers in us in some form.</p>
<p>Like even when I&rsquo;m describing it,</p>
<p>I feel like a little bit like, isn&rsquo;t it funny?</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re just feeling the same way.</p>
<p>It is, it is.</p>
<p>But we kind of replace it by an intuition.</p>
<p>And actually there&rsquo;s a very beautiful example of this,</p>
<p>how physicists do this, try to replace their intuition.</p>
<p>And I think this is one of my favorite examples</p>
<p>about how physicists develop intuition.</p>
<p>It goes to the work of Galileo.</p>
<p>So, again, let&rsquo;s go back to Greek philosophers</p>
<p>or maybe Aristotle in this case.</p>
<p>Now, again, let&rsquo;s make a criticism.</p>
<p>He thought that the heavier objects fall faster</p>
<p>than the lighter objects.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>It kind of makes sense.</p>
<p>And people say about the feather and so on,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s because of the air resistance.</p>
<p>But you might think like,</p>
<p>if you have a heavy stone and a light pebble,</p>
<p>the heavy one will fall first.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t do any experiments,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first gut reaction.</p>
<p>I would say everybody would say that&rsquo;s the natural thing.</p>
<p>Galileo did not believe this.</p>
<p>And he kind of did the experiment.</p>
<p>Famously it said he went on the top of Pisa Tower</p>
<p>and he dropped these heavy and light stones</p>
<p>and they fell at the same time</p>
<p>when he dropped it at the same time from the same height.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>So he said, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve showed that the heavy and lighter objects</p>
<p>fall at the same time.</p>
<p>I did the experiment.</p>
<p>Scientists at that time did not accept it.</p>
<p>Why was that?</p>
<p>Because at that time, science was not just experimental.</p>
<p>The experiment was not enough.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think that they have to soil their hands</p>
<p>in doing experiments to get to the reality.</p>
<p>They said, why is it the case?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>So Galileo had to come up with an explanation</p>
<p>of why heavier and lighter objects fall at the same rate.</p>
<p>This is the way he convinced them using symmetry.</p>
<p>He said, suppose you have three bricks,</p>
<p>the same shape, the same size, same mass, everything.</p>
<p>And we hold these three bricks at the same height</p>
<p>and drop them.</p>
<p>Which one will fall to the ground first?</p>
<p>Everybody said, of course, we know it&rsquo;s symmetry</p>
<p>tells you they&rsquo;re all the same shape,</p>
<p>same size, same height.</p>
<p>Of course, they fall at the same time.</p>
<p>Yeah, we know that.</p>
<p>Next, next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trivial.</p>
<p>He said, okay, what if we move these bricks around</p>
<p>with the same height?</p>
<p>Does it change the time they hit the ground?</p>
<p>They said, if it&rsquo;s the same height,</p>
<p>again, by the symmetry principle,</p>
<p>because the height translation horizontal</p>
<p>translates to the symmetry, no, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>They all fall at the same rate.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Does it matter how close I bring them together?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Okay, suppose I make the two bricks touch</p>
<p>and then let them go.</p>
<p>Do they fall at the same rate?</p>
<p>Yes, they do.</p>
<p>But then he said, well, the two bricks that touch</p>
<p>are twice more mass than this other brick.</p>
<p>And you just agreed that they fall at the same rate.</p>
<p>They say, yeah, yeah, we just agreed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So he deconfused them by the symmetry reasoning.</p>
<p>So this way of repackaging some intuition,</p>
<p>a different type of intuition.</p>
<p>When the intuitions clash,</p>
<p>then you side on the, you replace the intuition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>In some of these more difficult physical ideas,</p>
<p>physics ideas in the 20th century and the 21st century,</p>
<p>it starts becoming more and more difficult</p>
<p>to then replace the intuition.</p>
<p>What does the world look like</p>
<p>for an object traveling close to the speed of light?</p>
<p>You start to think about the edges</p>
<p>of supermassive black holes,</p>
<p>and you start to think like, what&rsquo;s that look like?</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;ve been into gravitational waves recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when the fabric of space time</p>
<p>is being morphed by gravity,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s that actually feel like?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m riding a gravitational wave, what&rsquo;s that feel like?</p>
<p>I mean, I think some of those are more sort of hippy,</p>
<p>not useful intuitions to have,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re an actual physicist</p>
<p>or whatever the particular discipline is,</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to meditate,</p>
<p>to sort of escape through thinking,</p>
<p>prolong thinking and meditation on a world,</p>
<p>like live in a visualized world that&rsquo;s not like our own</p>
<p>in order to understand a phenomenon deeply.</p>
<p>So like replace the intuition,</p>
<p>like through rigorous meditation on the idea</p>
<p>in order to conceive of it.</p>
<p>I mean, if we talk about multiple dimensions,</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way to escape</p>
<p>with a three dimensional world in our mind</p>
<p>in order to then start to reason about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, the more I talk to topologists,</p>
<p>the more they seem to not operate at all</p>
<p>in the visual space.</p>
<p>They really trust the mathematics,</p>
<p>like which is really annoying to me because topology</p>
<p>and differential geometry feels like it has a lot</p>
<p>of potential for beautiful pictures.</p>
<p>Yes, I think they do.</p>
<p>Actually, I would not be able to do my research</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t have an intuitive feel about geometry.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get to it as you mentioned before</p>
<p>that how, for example, in strength theory,</p>
<p>you deal with these extra dimensions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be very happy to describe how we do it</p>
<p>because without intuition, we will not get anywhere.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think you can just rely on formalism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any physicist just relies on formalism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not physics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not understanding.</p>
<p>So we have to intuit it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s crucial.</p>
<p>And there are steps of doing it.</p>
<p>And we learned it might not be trivial,</p>
<p>but we learn how to do it.</p>
<p>Similar to what this Galileo picture I just told you,</p>
<p>you have to build these gradually.</p>
<p>But you have to connect the bricks.</p>
<p>Exactly, you have to connect the bricks, literally.</p>
<p>So yeah, so then, so going back to your question</p>
<p>about the path of the history of the science.</p>
<p>So I was saying about the electricity and magnetism</p>
<p>and the special relativity where simple idea</p>
<p>led to special relativity.</p>
<p>But then he went further thinking about acceleration</p>
<p>in the context of relativity.</p>
<p>And he came up with general relativity</p>
<p>where he talked about the fabric of space time</p>
<p>being curved and so forth and matter</p>
<p>affecting the curvature of the space and time.</p>
<p>So this gradually became a connection</p>
<p>between geometry and physics.</p>
<p>Namely, he replaced Newton&rsquo;s gravitational force</p>
<p>with a very geometrical, beautiful picture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more elegant than Newton&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but much more complicated mathematically.</p>
<p>So when we say it&rsquo;s simpler,</p>
<p>we mean in some form it&rsquo;s simpler,</p>
<p>but not in pragmatic terms of equation solving.</p>
<p>The equations are much harder to solve</p>
<p>in Einstein&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>And in fact, so much harder that Einstein himself</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t solve many of the cases.</p>
<p>He thought, for example, you couldn&rsquo;t solve the equation</p>
<p>for a spherical symmetric matter,</p>
<p>like if you had a symmetric sun,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t think you can actually solve his equation for that.</p>
<p>And a year after he said that it was solved by Schwarzschild.</p>
<p>So it was that hard</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be that easy.</p>
<p>So yeah, deformism is hard.</p>
<p>But the contrast between the special relativity</p>
<p>and general relativity is very interesting</p>
<p>because one of them has almost trivial math</p>
<p>and the other one has super complicated math.</p>
<p>Both are physically amazingly important.</p>
<p>And so we have learned that, you know,</p>
<p>the physics may or may not require complicated math.</p>
<p>We should not shy from using complicated math</p>
<p>like Einstein did.</p>
<p>Nobody, Einstein wouldn&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna touch this math because it&rsquo;s too much,</p>
<p>you know, tensors or, you know, curvature</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t like the four dimensional space time</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t see four dimension.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t doing that.</p>
<p>He was willing to abstract from that</p>
<p>because physics drove him in that direction.</p>
<p>But his motivation was physics.</p>
<p>Physics pushed him.</p>
<p>Just like Newton pushed to develop calculus</p>
<p>because physics pushed him that he didn&rsquo;t have the tools.</p>
<p>So he had to develop the tools</p>
<p>to answer his physics questions.</p>
<p>So his motivation was physics again.</p>
<p>So to me, those are examples which show</p>
<p>that math and physics have this symbiotic relationship</p>
<p>which kind of reinforce each other.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m using, I&rsquo;m giving you examples of both of them,</p>
<p>namely Newton&rsquo;s work led to development</p>
<p>of mathematics, calculus.</p>
<p>And in the case of Einstein, he didn&rsquo;t develop</p>
<p>Riemannian geometry, he just used them.</p>
<p>So it goes both ways and in the context of modern physics,</p>
<p>we see that again and again, it goes both ways.</p>
<p>Let me ask a ridiculous question.</p>
<p>You know, you talk about your favorite soccer player,</p>
<p>the bar, I&rsquo;ll ask the same question about Einstein&rsquo;s ideas</p>
<p>which is, which one do you think</p>
<p>is the biggest leap of genius?</p>
<p>Is it the E equals MC squared?</p>
<p>Is it Brownian motion?</p>
<p>Is it special relativity, is it general relativity?</p>
<p>Which of the famous set of papers he&rsquo;s written in 1905</p>
<p>and in general, his work was the biggest leap of genius?</p>
<p>In my opinion, it&rsquo;s special relativity.</p>
<p>The idea that speed of light is the same for everybody</p>
<p>is the beginning of everything he did.</p>
<p>The beginning is the seed.</p>
<p>The beginning.</p>
<p>Once you embrace that weirdness,</p>
<p>all the weirdness, all the rest.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s, even though he says</p>
<p>the most beautiful moment for him,</p>
<p>he says that is when he realized that if you fall</p>
<p>in an elevator, you don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re falling</p>
<p>or whether you&rsquo;re in the falling elevator</p>
<p>or whether you&rsquo;re next to the earth, gravitational.</p>
<p>That to him was his aha moment,</p>
<p>which inertial mass and gravitational mass</p>
<p>being identical geometrically and so forth</p>
<p>as part of the theory, not because of, you know,</p>
<p>some funny coincidence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for him, but I feel from outside at least,</p>
<p>it feels like the speed of light being the same</p>
<p>is the really aha moment.</p>
<p>The general relativity to you is not</p>
<p>like the conception of space time.</p>
<p>In a sense, the conception of space time</p>
<p>already was part of the special relativity</p>
<p>when you talk about length contraction.</p>
<p>So general relativity takes that to the next step,</p>
<p>but beginning of it was already space,</p>
<p>length contracts, time dilates.</p>
<p>So once you talk about those, then yeah,</p>
<p>you can dilate more or less different places</p>
<p>than its curvature.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>So it kind of started just with that same simple thought.</p>
<p>Speed of light is the same for all.</p>
<p>Where does quantum mechanics come into view?</p>
<p>Exactly, so this is the next step.</p>
<p>So Einstein&rsquo;s, you know, developed general relativity</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s beginning to develop the foundation</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics at the same time,</p>
<p>the photoelectric effects and others.</p>
<p>And so quantum mechanics overtakes, in fact,</p>
<p>Einstein in many ways because he doesn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and the formulas that&rsquo;s emerging,</p>
<p>but fits his march on and try to, for example,</p>
<p>combine Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity</p>
<p>with quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So Dirac takes special relativity,</p>
<p>tries to see how is it compatible with quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Can we pause and briefly say what is quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>Oh yes, sure.</p>
<p>So quantum mechanics, so I discussed briefly</p>
<p>when I talked about the connection</p>
<p>between Newtonian mechanics</p>
<p>and the Euler Lagrange reformulation</p>
<p>of the Newtonian mechanics and interpretation</p>
<p>of this Euler Lagrange formulas in terms of the paths</p>
<p>that the particle take.</p>
<p>So when we say a particle goes from here to here,</p>
<p>we usually think it classically follows</p>
<p>a specific trajectory, but actually in quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>it follows every trajectory with different probabilities.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this fuzziness.</p>
<p>Now, most probable, it&rsquo;s the path that you actually see</p>
<p>and deviation from that is very, very unlikely</p>
<p>and probabilistically very minuscule.</p>
<p>So in everyday experiments,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t see anything deviated from what we expect,</p>
<p>but quantum mechanics tells us that the things</p>
<p>are more fuzzy.</p>
<p>Things are not as precise as the line you draw.</p>
<p>Things are a bit like cloud.</p>
<p>So if you go to microscopic scales,</p>
<p>like atomic scales and lower,</p>
<p>these phenomena become more pronounced.</p>
<p>You can see it much better.</p>
<p>The electron is not at the point,</p>
<p>but the cloud spread out around the nucleus.</p>
<p>And so this fuzziness, this probabilistic aspect of reality</p>
<p>is what quantum mechanics describes.</p>
<p>Can I briefly pause on that idea?</p>
<p>Do you think quantum mechanics</p>
<p>is just a really damn good approximation,</p>
<p>a tool for predicting reality,</p>
<p>or does it actually describe reality?</p>
<p>Do you think reality is fuzzy at that level?</p>
<p>Well, I think that reality is fuzzy at that level,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think quantum mechanics</p>
<p>is necessarily the end of the story.</p>
<p>So quantum mechanics is certainly an improvement</p>
<p>over classical physics.</p>
<p>That much we know by experiments and so forth.</p>
<p>Whether I&rsquo;m happy with quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>whether I view quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>for example, the thought,</p>
<p>the measurement description of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>am I happy with it?</p>
<p>Am I thinking that&rsquo;s the end stage or not?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re at the end of that story.</p>
<p>And many physicists may or may not view this way.</p>
<p>Some do, some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s the best we have right now,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best approximation for reality we know today.</p>
<p>And so far, we don&rsquo;t know what it is,</p>
<p>the next thing that improves it or replaces it and so on.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe any of the laws of physics we know today</p>
<p>are permanently exactly correct.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like dogmatic saying,</p>
<p>I have figured out this is the law of nature.</p>
<p>I know everything.</p>
<p>No, no, that&rsquo;s the beauty about science</p>
<p>is that we are not dogmatic.</p>
<p>And we are willing to, in fact,</p>
<p>we are encouraged to be skeptical of what we ourselves do.</p>
<p>So you were talking about Dirac.</p>
<p>Yes, I was talking about Dirac, right.</p>
<p>So Dirac was trying to now combine</p>
<p>this Schrodinger&rsquo;s equations,</p>
<p>which was described in the context of trying to talk about</p>
<p>how these probabilistic waves of electrons</p>
<p>move for the atom,</p>
<p>which was good for speeds</p>
<p>which were not too close to the speed of light,</p>
<p>to what happens when you get to the near the speed of light.</p>
<p>So then you need relativity.</p>
<p>So then Dirac tried to combine Einstein&rsquo;s relativity</p>
<p>with quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So he tried to combine them</p>
<p>and he wrote this beautiful equation, the Dirac equation,</p>
<p>which roughly speaking,</p>
<p>take the square root of the Einstein&rsquo;s equation</p>
<p>in order to connect it to Schrodinger&rsquo;s</p>
<p>time evolution operator,</p>
<p>which is first order in time derivative</p>
<p>to get rid of the naive thing</p>
<p>that Einstein&rsquo;s equation would have given,</p>
<p>which is second order.</p>
<p>So you have to take a square root.</p>
<p>Now square root usually has a plus or minus sign</p>
<p>when you take it.</p>
<p>And when he did this,</p>
<p>he originally didn&rsquo;t notice this plus,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t pay attention to this plus or minus sign,</p>
<p>but later physicists pointed out to Dirac says,</p>
<p>look, there&rsquo;s also this minus sign.</p>
<p>And if you use this minus sign,</p>
<p>you get negative energy.</p>
<p>In fact, it was very, very annoying that, you know,</p>
<p>somebody else tells you this obvious mistake you make.</p>
<p>Pauli famous physicist told Dirac, this is nonsense.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get negative energy with your equation,</p>
<p>which negative energy without any bottom,</p>
<p>you can go all the way down to negative.</p>
<p>Infinite energy, so it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Dirac thought about it.</p>
<p>And then he remembered Pauli&rsquo;s exclusion principle</p>
<p>just before him.</p>
<p>Pauli had said, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this principle called the exclusion principle</p>
<p>that, you know, two electrons cannot be on the same orbit.</p>
<p>And so Dirac said, okay, you know what?</p>
<p>All these negative energy states are filled orbits,</p>
<p>occupied.</p>
<p>So according to you,</p>
<p>Mr. Pauli, there&rsquo;s no place to go.</p>
<p>So therefore they only have to go positive.</p>
<p>Sounded like a big cheat.</p>
<p>And then Pauli said, oh, you know what?</p>
<p>We can change orbits from one orbit to another.</p>
<p>What if I take one of these negative energy orbits</p>
<p>and put it up there?</p>
<p>Then it seems to be a new particle,</p>
<p>which has opposite properties to the electron.</p>
<p>It has positive energy, but it has positive charge.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Dirac was a bit worried.</p>
<p>He said, maybe that&rsquo;s proton</p>
<p>because proton has plus charge.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure.</p>
<p>But then he said, oh, maybe it&rsquo;s proton.</p>
<p>But then they said, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>It has the same mass as the electron.</p>
<p>It cannot be proton because proton is heavier.</p>
<p>Dirac was stuck.</p>
<p>He says, well, then maybe another part we haven&rsquo;t seen.</p>
<p>By that time, Dirac himself was getting a little bit worried</p>
<p>about his own equation and his own crazy interpretation.</p>
<p>Until a few years later, Anderson,</p>
<p>in the photographic place that he had gotten</p>
<p>from these cosmic rays,</p>
<p>he discovered a particle which goes</p>
<p>in the opposite direction that the electron goes</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a magnetic field,</p>
<p>and with the same mass,</p>
<p>exactly like what Dirac had predicted.</p>
<p>And this was what we call now positron.</p>
<p>And in fact, beginning with the work of Dirac,</p>
<p>we know that every particle has an antiparticle.</p>
<p>And so this idea that there&rsquo;s an antiparticle</p>
<p>came from this simple math.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a plus and a minus</p>
<p>from the Dirac&rsquo;s quote unquote mistake.</p>
<p>So again, trying to combine ideas,</p>
<p>sometimes the math is smarter than the person</p>
<p>who uses it to apply it,</p>
<p>and you try to resist it,</p>
<p>and then you kind of confront it by criticism,</p>
<p>which is the way it should be.</p>
<p>So physicists comes and said, no, no, that&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>and you correct it, and so on.</p>
<p>So that is a development of the idea</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s particle, there&rsquo;s antiparticle, and so on.</p>
<p>So this is the beginning of development</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics and the connection with relativity,</p>
<p>but the thing was more challenging</p>
<p>because we had to also describe</p>
<p>how electric and magnetic fields work with quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>This was much more complicated</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just one point.</p>
<p>Electric and magnetic fields were everywhere.</p>
<p>So you had to talk about fluctuating</p>
<p>and a fuzziness of electrical fields</p>
<p>and magnetic fields everywhere.</p>
<p>And the math for that was very difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>And this led to a subject called quantum field theory.</p>
<p>Fields like electric and magnetic fields had to be quantum,</p>
<p>had to be described also in a wavy way.</p>
<p>Feynman in particular was one of the pioneers</p>
<p>along with Schrodingers and others</p>
<p>to try to come up with a formalism</p>
<p>to deal with fields like electric and magnetic fields,</p>
<p>interacting with electrons in a consistent quantum fashion.</p>
<p>And they developed this beautiful theory,</p>
<p>quantum electrodynamics from that.</p>
<p>And later on that same formalism,</p>
<p>quantum field theory led to the discovery of other forces</p>
<p>and other particles all consistent</p>
<p>with the idea of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So that was how physics progressed.</p>
<p>And so basically we learned that all particles</p>
<p>and all the forces are in some sense related</p>
<p>to particle exchanges.</p>
<p>And so for example, electromagnetic forces</p>
<p>are mediated by a particle we call photon and so forth.</p>
<p>And same for other forces that they discovered,</p>
<p>strong forces and the weak forces.</p>
<p>So we got the sense of what quantum field theory is.</p>
<p>Is that a big leap of an idea that particles</p>
<p>are fluctuations in the field?</p>
<p>Like the idea that everything is a field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the old Einstein, light is a wave,</p>
<p>both a particle and a wave kind of idea.</p>
<p>Is that a huge leap in our understanding</p>
<p>of conceiving the universe as fields?</p>
<p>I would say so.</p>
<p>I would say that viewing the particles,</p>
<p>this duality that Bohr mentioned</p>
<p>between particles and waves,</p>
<p>that waves can behave sometimes like particles,</p>
<p>sometimes like waves,</p>
<p>is one of the biggest leaps of imagination</p>
<p>that quantum mechanics made physics do.</p>
<p>So I agree that that is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Is duality fundamental to the universe</p>
<p>or is it just because we don&rsquo;t understand it fully?</p>
<p>Like will it eventually collapse</p>
<p>into a clean explanation that doesn&rsquo;t require duality?</p>
<p>Like that a phenomena could be two things at once</p>
<p>and both to be true.</p>
<p>So that seems weird.</p>
<p>So in fact I was going to get to that</p>
<p>when we get to string theory</p>
<p>but maybe I can comment on that now.</p>
<p>Duality turns out to be running the show today</p>
<p>and the whole thing that we are doing is string theory.</p>
<p>Duality is the name of the game.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the most beautiful subject</p>
<p>and I want to talk about it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about it in the context of string theory then.</p>
<p>So we do want to take a next step into,</p>
<p>because we mentioned general relativity,</p>
<p>we mentioned quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>is there something to be said about quantum gravity?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly the right point to talk about.</p>
<p>So namely we have talked about quantum fields</p>
<p>and I talked about electric forces,</p>
<p>photon being the particle carrying those forces.</p>
<p>So for gravity, quantizing gravitational field</p>
<p>which is this curvature of space time according to Einstein,</p>
<p>you get another particle called graviton.</p>
<p>So what about gravitons?</p>
<p>Should be there, no problem.</p>
<p>So then you start computing it.</p>
<p>What do I mean by computing it?</p>
<p>Well, you compute scattering of one graviton</p>
<p>off another graviton, maybe with graviton with an electron</p>
<p>and so on, see what you get.</p>
<p>Feynman had already mastered this quantum electrodynamics.</p>
<p>He said, no problem, let me do it.</p>
<p>Even though these are such weak forces,</p>
<p>the gravity is very weak.</p>
<p>So therefore to see them,</p>
<p>these quantum effects of gravitational waves was impossible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even impossible today.</p>
<p>So Feynman just did it for fun.</p>
<p>He usually had this mindset that I want to do something</p>
<p>which I will see in experiment,</p>
<p>but this one, let&rsquo;s just see what it does.</p>
<p>And he was surprised because the same techniques</p>
<p>he was using for doing the same calculations,</p>
<p>quantum electrodynamics, when applied to gravity failed.</p>
<p>The formulas seem to make sense,</p>
<p>but he had to do some integrals</p>
<p>and he found that when he does those integrals,</p>
<p>he got infinity and it didn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Now there were similar infinities in the other pieces</p>
<p>but he had managed to make sense out of those before.</p>
<p>This was no way he could make sense out of it.</p>
<p>He just didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s an urgent issue</p>
<p>because nobody could do the experiment.</p>
<p>So he was kind of said, okay, there&rsquo;s this thing,</p>
<p>but okay, we don&rsquo;t know how to exactly do it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>So in some sense, a natural conclusion</p>
<p>from what Feynman did could have been like,</p>
<p>gravity cannot be consistent with quantum theory,</p>
<p>but that cannot be the case</p>
<p>because gravity is in our universe,</p>
<p>quantum mechanics in our universe,</p>
<p>they both together somehow should work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not acceptable to say they don&rsquo;t work together.</p>
<p>So that was a puzzle.</p>
<p>How does it possibly work?</p>
<p>It was left open.</p>
<p>And then we get to the string theory.</p>
<p>So this is the puzzle of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>The particle description of quantum gravity failed.</p>
<p>So the infinity shows up.</p>
<p>What do we do with infinity?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the fun part.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about string theory.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss some technical basics of string theory.</p>
<p>What is string theory?</p>
<p>What is a string?</p>
<p>How many dimensions are we talking about?</p>
<p>What are the different states?</p>
<p>How do we represent the elementary particles</p>
<p>and the laws of physics using this new framework?</p>
<p>So string theory is the idea</p>
<p>that the fundamental entities are not particles,</p>
<p>but extended higher dimensional objects</p>
<p>like one dimensional strings, like loops.</p>
<p>These loops could be open like with two ends,</p>
<p>like an interval or a circle without any ends.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re vibrating and moving around in space.</p>
<p>So how big they are?</p>
<p>Well, you can of course stretch it and make it big,</p>
<p>or you can just let it be whatever it wants.</p>
<p>It can be as small as a point</p>
<p>because the circle can shrink to a point</p>
<p>and be very light,</p>
<p>or you can stretch it and becomes very massive,</p>
<p>or it could oscillate and become massive that way.</p>
<p>So it depends on which kind of state you have.</p>
<p>In fact, the string can have infinitely many modes,</p>
<p>depending on which kind of oscillation it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Like a guitar has different harmonics,</p>
<p>string has different harmonics,</p>
<p>but for the string, each harmonic is a particle.</p>
<p>So each particle will give you,</p>
<p>ah, this is a more massive harmonic, this is a less massive.</p>
<p>So the lightest harmonic, so to speak, is no harmonics,</p>
<p>which means like the string shrunk to a point,</p>
<p>and then it becomes like a massless particles</p>
<p>or light particles like photon and graviton and so forth.</p>
<p>So when you look at tiny strings,</p>
<p>which are shrunk to a point, the lightest ones,</p>
<p>they look like the particles that we think,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like particles.</p>
<p>In other words, from far away, they look like a point.</p>
<p>But of course, if you zoom in,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this tiny little circle that&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s shrunk to almost a point.</p>
<p>Should we be imagining, this is to the visual intuition,</p>
<p>should we be imagining literally strings</p>
<p>that are potentially connected as a loop or not?</p>
<p>We knew, and when somebody outside of physics</p>
<p>is imagining a basic element of string theory,</p>
<p>which is a string,</p>
<p>should we literally be thinking about a string?</p>
<p>Yes, you should literally think about string,</p>
<p>but string with zero thickness.</p>
<p>With zero thickness.</p>
<p>So notice, it&rsquo;s a loop of energy, so to speak,</p>
<p>if you can think of it that way.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a tension like a regular string,</p>
<p>if you pull it, there&rsquo;s, you know, you have to stretch it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like a thickness, like you&rsquo;re made of something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not made of atoms or something like that.</p>
<p>But it is very, very tiny.</p>
<p>Very tiny.</p>
<p>Much smaller than elementary particles of physics.</p>
<p>Much smaller.</p>
<p>So we think if you let the string to be by itself,</p>
<p>the lowest state, there&rsquo;ll be like fuzziness</p>
<p>or a size of that tiny little circle,</p>
<p>which is like a point,</p>
<p>about, could be anything between,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know the exact size,</p>
<p>but in different models have different sizes,</p>
<p>but something of the order of 10 to the minus,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>So 10 to the minus 30 centimeters,</p>
<p>just to compare it with the size of the atom,</p>
<p>which is 10 to the minus eight centimeters,</p>
<p>is 22 orders of magnitude smaller.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Unimaginably small, I would say.</p>
<p>Very small.</p>
<p>So we basically think from far away,</p>
<p>string is like a point particle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why a lot of the things that we learned</p>
<p>about point particle physics</p>
<p>carries over directly to strings.</p>
<p>So therefore there&rsquo;s not much of a mystery</p>
<p>why particle physics was successful,</p>
<p>because a string is like a particle</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not stretched.</p>
<p>But it turns out having this size,</p>
<p>being able to oscillate, get bigger,</p>
<p>turned out to be resolving this puzzles</p>
<p>that Feynman was having in calculating his diagrams,</p>
<p>and it gets rid of those infinities.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re trying to do those infinities,</p>
<p>the regions that give infinities to Feynman,</p>
<p>as soon as you get to those regions,</p>
<p>then this string starts to oscillate,</p>
<p>and these oscillation structure of the strings</p>
<p>resolves those infinities to finite answer at the end.</p>
<p>So the size of the string,</p>
<p>the fact that it&rsquo;s one dimensional,</p>
<p>gives a finite answer at the end.</p>
<p>Resolves this paradox.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps it&rsquo;s also useful to recount</p>
<p>of how string theory came to be.</p>
<p>Because it wasn&rsquo;t like somebody say,</p>
<p>well, let me solve the problem of Einstein&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>solve the problem that Feynman had with unifying</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s theory with quantum mechanics</p>
<p>by replacing the point by a string.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not the way the thought process,</p>
<p>the thought process was much more random.</p>
<p>Physicist, then it&rsquo;s John on this case,</p>
<p>was trying to describe the interactions</p>
<p>they were seeing in colliders, in accelerators.</p>
<p>And they were seeing that some process,</p>
<p>in some process, when two particles came together</p>
<p>and joined together and when they were separately,</p>
<p>in one way, and the opposite way, they behave the same way.</p>
<p>In some way, there was a symmetry, a duality,</p>
<p>which he didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>The particles didn&rsquo;t seem to have that symmetry.</p>
<p>He said, I don&rsquo;t know what it is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the reason that these colliders</p>
<p>and experiments we&rsquo;re doing seems to have the symmetry,</p>
<p>but let me write the mathematical formula,</p>
<p>which exhibits that symmetry.</p>
<p>He used gamma functions, beta functions and all that,</p>
<p>you know, complete math, no physics,</p>
<p>other than trying to get symmetry out of his equation.</p>
<p>He just wrote down a formula as the answer for a process,</p>
<p>not a method to compute it.</p>
<p>Just say, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if this was the answer?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Physics looked at this one, that&rsquo;s intriguing,</p>
<p>it has the symmetry all right, but what is this?</p>
<p>Where is this coming from?</p>
<p>Which kind of physics gives you this?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>A few years later, people saw that,</p>
<p>oh, the equation that you&rsquo;re writing,</p>
<p>the process you&rsquo;re writing in the intermediate channels</p>
<p>that particles come together,</p>
<p>seems to have all the harmonics.</p>
<p>Harmonics sounds like a string.</p>
<p>Let me see if what you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>has anything to do with the strings.</p>
<p>And people try to see if what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>has anything to do with the strings.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, indeed.</p>
<p>If I study scattering of two strings,</p>
<p>I get exactly the formula you wrote down.</p>
<p>That was the reinterpretation</p>
<p>of what he had written in the formula as the strings,</p>
<p>but still had nothing to do with gravity.</p>
<p>It had nothing to do with resolving the problems</p>
<p>of gravity with quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>It was just trying to explain a process</p>
<p>that people were seeing in hydronic physics collisions.</p>
<p>So it took a few more years to get to that point.</p>
<p>They did notice that,</p>
<p>physicists noticed that whenever you try to find</p>
<p>the spectrum of strings, you always get a massless particle</p>
<p>which has exactly the properties</p>
<p>that the graviton is supposed to have.</p>
<p>And no particle in hydronic physics that had that property.</p>
<p>You are getting a massless graviton</p>
<p>as part of this scattering without looking for it.</p>
<p>It was forced on you.</p>
<p>People were not trying to solve quantum gravity.</p>
<p>Quantum gravity was pushed on them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want this graviton.</p>
<p>Get rid of it.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t get rid of it.</p>
<p>They gave up trying to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Physicists, Sherk and Schwartz said,</p>
<p>you know what, string theory is theory of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve changed their perspective altogether.</p>
<p>We are not describing the hydronic physics.</p>
<p>We are describing this theory of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when string theory probably got like exciting</p>
<p>that this could be the unifying theory.</p>
<p>Exactly, it got exciting,</p>
<p>but at the same time, not so fast.</p>
<p>Namely, it should have been fast, but it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because particle physics through quantum field theory</p>
<p>were so successful at that time.</p>
<p>This is mid seventies, standard model of physics,</p>
<p>electromagnetism and unification of electromagnetic forces</p>
<p>with all the other forces were beginning to take place</p>
<p>without the gravity part.</p>
<p>Everything was working beautifully for particle physics.</p>
<p>And so that was the shining golden age</p>
<p>of quantum field theory and all the experiments,</p>
<p>standard model, this and that, unification,</p>
<p>spontaneous symmetry breaking was taking place.</p>
<p>All of them was nice.</p>
<p>This was kind of like a side show</p>
<p>and nobody was paying so much attention.</p>
<p>This exotic string is needed for quantum gravity.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s other ways, maybe we should do something else.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t paid much attention to.</p>
<p>And this took a little bit more effort</p>
<p>to try to actually connect it to reality.</p>
<p>There are a few more steps.</p>
<p>First of all, there was a puzzle</p>
<p>that you were getting extra dimensions.</p>
<p>String was not working well</p>
<p>with three spatial dimension on one time.</p>
<p>It needed extra dimension.</p>
<p>Now, there are different versions of strings,</p>
<p>but the version that ended up being related</p>
<p>to having particles like electron,</p>
<p>what we call fermions, needed 10 dimensions,</p>
<p>what we call super string.</p>
<p>Now, why super?</p>
<p>Why the word super?</p>
<p>It turns out this version of the string,</p>
<p>which had fermions, had an extra symmetry,</p>
<p>which we call supersymmetry.</p>
<p>This is a symmetry between a particle and another particle</p>
<p>with exactly the same properties,</p>
<p>same mass, same charge, et cetera.</p>
<p>The only difference is that one of them</p>
<p>has a little different spin than the other one.</p>
<p>And one of them is a boson, one of them is a fermion</p>
<p>because of that shift of spin.</p>
<p>Otherwise, they&rsquo;re identical.</p>
<p>So there was this symmetry.</p>
<p>String theory had this symmetry.</p>
<p>In fact, supersymmetry was discovered</p>
<p>through string theory, theoretically.</p>
<p>So theoretically, the first place that this was observed</p>
<p>when you were describing these fermionic strings.</p>
<p>So that was the beginning of the study of supersymmetry</p>
<p>was via string theory.</p>
<p>And then it had remarkable properties</p>
<p>that the symmetry meant and so forth</p>
<p>that people began studying supersymmetry after that.</p>
<p>And that was a kind of a tangent direction</p>
<p>at the beginning for string theory.</p>
<p>But people in particle physics started also thinking,</p>
<p>oh, supersymmetry is great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can have supersymmetry</p>
<p>in particle physics and so forth.</p>
<p>Forget about strings.</p>
<p>And they developed on a different track as well.</p>
<p>Supersymmetry in different models</p>
<p>became a subject on its own right,</p>
<p>understanding supersymmetry and what does this mean?</p>
<p>Because it unified bosons and fermion,</p>
<p>unified some ideas together.</p>
<p>So photon is a boson, electron is a fermion.</p>
<p>Could things like that be somehow related?</p>
<p>It was a kind of a natural kind of a question</p>
<p>to try to kind of unify</p>
<p>because in physics, we love unification.</p>
<p>Now, gradually, string theory was beginning</p>
<p>to show signs of unification.</p>
<p>It had graviton, but people found that you also have</p>
<p>things like photons in them,</p>
<p>different excitations of string behave like photons,</p>
<p>another one behaves like electron.</p>
<p>So a single string was unifying all these particles</p>
<p>into one object.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in 10 dimensions though.</p>
<p>It is not our universe</p>
<p>because we live in three plus one dimension.</p>
<p>How could that be possibly true?</p>
<p>So this was a conundrum.</p>
<p>It was elegant, it was beautiful,</p>
<p>but it was very specific</p>
<p>about which dimension you&rsquo;re getting,</p>
<p>which structure you&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t saying, oh, you just put D equals to four,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get your space time dimension that you want.</p>
<p>No, it didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>It said, I want 10 dimensions and that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>So it was very specific.</p>
<p>Now, so people try to reconcile this</p>
<p>by the idea that, you know,</p>
<p>maybe these extra dimensions are tiny.</p>
<p>So if you take three macroscopic spatial dimensions</p>
<p>on one time and six extra tiny spatial dimensions,</p>
<p>like tiny spheres or tiny circles,</p>
<p>then it avoids contradiction with manifest fact</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t seen extra dimensions in experiments today.</p>
<p>So that was a way to avoid conflict.</p>
<p>Now, this was a way to avoid conflict,</p>
<p>but it was not observed in experiments.</p>
<p>A string observed in experiments?</p>
<p>No, because it&rsquo;s so small.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s beginning to sound a little bit funny.</p>
<p>Similar feeling to the way perhaps Dirac had felt</p>
<p>about this positron plus or minus, you know,</p>
<p>it was beginning to sound a little bit like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, not only I have to have 10 dimension,</p>
<p>but I have to have this, I have to also this.</p>
<p>And so conservative physicists would say,</p>
<p>hmm, you know, I haven&rsquo;t seen these experiments.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they are really there.</p>
<p>Are you pulling my leg?</p>
<p>Do you want me to imagine things that are not there?</p>
<p>So this was an attitude of some physicists</p>
<p>towards string theory, despite the fact</p>
<p>that the puzzle of gravity and quantum mechanics</p>
<p>merging together work, but still was this skepticism.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting all these things that you want me</p>
<p>to imagine there, these extra dimensions</p>
<p>that I cannot see, aha, aha.</p>
<p>And you want me to believe that string</p>
<p>that you have not even seen the experiments are real,</p>
<p>aha, okay, what else do you want me to believe?</p>
<p>So this kind of beginning to sound a little funny.</p>
<p>Now, I will pass forward a little bit further.</p>
<p>A few decades later, when string theory became</p>
<p>the mainstream of efforts to unify the forces</p>
<p>and particles together, we learned</p>
<p>that these extra dimensions actually solved problems.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t a nuisance the way they originally appeared.</p>
<p>First of all, the properties of these extra dimensions</p>
<p>reflected the number of particles we got in four dimensions.</p>
<p>If you took these six dimensions to have like five holes</p>
<p>or four holes, change the number of particles</p>
<p>that you see in four dimensional space time,</p>
<p>you get one electron and one muon if you had this,</p>
<p>but if you did the other J shape, you get something else.</p>
<p>So geometrically, you could get different kinds of physics.</p>
<p>So it was kind of a mirroring of geometry by physics</p>
<p>down in the macroscopic space.</p>
<p>So these extra dimension were becoming useful.</p>
<p>Fine, but we didn&rsquo;t need the extra dimension</p>
<p>to just write an electron in three dimensions,</p>
<p>we did rewrote it, so what?</p>
<p>Was there any other puzzle?</p>
<p>Yes, there were, Hawking.</p>
<p>Hawking had been studying black holes in mid 70s</p>
<p>following the work of Bekenstein,</p>
<p>who had predicted that black holes have entropy.</p>
<p>So Bekenstein had tried to attach the entropy</p>
<p>to the black hole.</p>
<p>If you throw something into the black hole,</p>
<p>the entropy seems to go down</p>
<p>because you had something entropy outside the black hole</p>
<p>and you throw it, black hole was unique,</p>
<p>so the entropy did not have any, black hole had no entropy.</p>
<p>So the entropy seemed to go down.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s against the laws of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>So Bekenstein was trying to say, no, no,</p>
<p>therefore black hole must have an entropy.</p>
<p>So he was trying to understand that he found that</p>
<p>if you assign entropy to be proportional</p>
<p>to the area of the black hole, it seems to work.</p>
<p>And then Hawking found not only that&rsquo;s correct,</p>
<p>he found the correct proportionality factor</p>
<p>of a one quarter of the area and Planck units</p>
<p>is the correct amount of entropy.</p>
<p>And he gave an argument using</p>
<p>quantum semi classical arguments,</p>
<p>which means basically using a little bit</p>
<p>of a quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t have the full quantum mechanics</p>
<p>of string theory, he could do some aspects</p>
<p>of approximate quantum arguments.</p>
<p>So he heuristic quantum arguments led</p>
<p>to this entropy formula.</p>
<p>But then he didn&rsquo;t answer the following question.</p>
<p>He was getting a big entropy for the black hole,</p>
<p>the black hole with the size of the horizon</p>
<p>of a black hole is huge, has a huge amount of entropy.</p>
<p>What are the microstates of this entropy?</p>
<p>When you say, for example, the gas is entropy,</p>
<p>you count where the atoms are,</p>
<p>you count this bucket or that bucket,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an information about there and so on, you count them.</p>
<p>For the black hole, the way Hawking was thinking,</p>
<p>there was no degree of freedom, you throw them in,</p>
<p>and there was just one solution.</p>
<p>So where are these entropy?</p>
<p>What are these microscopic states?</p>
<p>They were hidden somewhere.</p>
<p>So later in string theory,</p>
<p>the work that we did with my colleague Strominger,</p>
<p>in particular showed that these ingredients</p>
<p>in string theory of black hole arise</p>
<p>from the extra dimensions.</p>
<p>So the degrees of freedom are hidden</p>
<p>in terms of things like strings,</p>
<p>wrapping these extra circles in these hidden dimensions.</p>
<p>And then we started counting how many ways</p>
<p>like the strings can wrap around this circle</p>
<p>and the extra dimension or that circle</p>
<p>and counted the microscopic degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, we got the microscopic degrees</p>
<p>of freedom that Hawking was predicting four dimensions.</p>
<p>So the extra dimensions became useful</p>
<p>for resolving a puzzle in four dimensions.</p>
<p>The puzzle was where are the degrees of freedom</p>
<p>of the black hole hidden?</p>
<p>The answer, hidden in the extra dimensions.</p>
<p>The tiny extra dimensions.</p>
<p>So then by this time, it was beginning to,</p>
<p>we see aspects that extra dimensions</p>
<p>are useful for many things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a nuisance.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t to be kind of, you know, be ashamed of.</p>
<p>It was actually in the welcome features.</p>
<p>New feature, nevertheless.</p>
<p>How do you intuit the 10 dimensional world?</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s a feature for describing certain phenomena</p>
<p>like the entropy in black holes,</p>
<p>but what you said that to you a theory becomes real</p>
<p>or becomes powerful when you can connect it</p>
<p>to some deep intuition.</p>
<p>So how do we intuit 10 dimensions?</p>
<p>Yes, so I will explain how some of the analogies work.</p>
<p>First of all, we do a lot of analogies.</p>
<p>And by analogies, we build intuition.</p>
<p>So I will start with this example.</p>
<p>I will try to explain that if we are in 10 dimensional space,</p>
<p>if we have a seven dimensional plane</p>
<p>and eight dimensional plane,</p>
<p>we ask typically in what space do they intersect each other</p>
<p>in what dimension?</p>
<p>That might sound like,</p>
<p>how do you possibly give an answer to this?</p>
<p>So we start with lower dimensions.</p>
<p>We start with two dimensions.</p>
<p>We say, if you have one dimension and a point,</p>
<p>do they intersect typically on a plane?</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>So a line one dimensional, a point zero dimension</p>
<p>on a two dimensional plane, they don&rsquo;t typically meet.</p>
<p>But if you have a one dimensional line and another line,</p>
<p>which is one plus one on a plane,</p>
<p>they typically intersect at a point.</p>
<p>Typically means if you&rsquo;re not parallel,</p>
<p>typically they intersect at a point.</p>
<p>So one plus one is two and in two dimension,</p>
<p>they intersect at the zero dimensional point.</p>
<p>So you see two dimension, one and one, two,</p>
<p>two minus two is zero.</p>
<p>So you get point out of intersection.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to three dimension.</p>
<p>You have a plane, two dimensional plane and a point.</p>
<p>Do they intersect?</p>
<p>No, two and zero.</p>
<p>How about the plane and a line?</p>
<p>A plane is two dimensional and a line is one.</p>
<p>Two plus one is three.</p>
<p>In three dimension, a plane and a line meet at points,</p>
<p>which is zero dimensional.</p>
<p>Three minus three is zero.</p>
<p>Okay, so plane and a line intersect</p>
<p>at a point in three dimension.</p>
<p>How about the plane and a plane in 3D?</p>
<p>Well, plane is two and this is two.</p>
<p>Two plus two is four.</p>
<p>In 3D, four minus three is one.</p>
<p>They intersect on a one dimensional line.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re beginning to see the pattern.</p>
<p>Okay, now come to the question.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in 10 dimension.</p>
<p>Now we have the intuition.</p>
<p>We have a seven dimensional plane</p>
<p>and eight dimensional plane in 10 dimension.</p>
<p>They intersect on a plane.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the dimension?</p>
<p>Well, seven plus eight is 15 minus 10 is five.</p>
<p>We draw the same picture as two planes</p>
<p>and we write seven dimension, eight dimension,</p>
<p>but we have gotten the intuition</p>
<p>from the lower dimensional one.</p>
<p>What to expect?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t scare us anymore.</p>
<p>So we draw this picture.</p>
<p>We cannot see all the seven dimensions</p>
<p>by looking at this two dimensional visualization of it,</p>
<p>but it has all the features we want.</p>
<p>It has, so we draw this picture.</p>
<p>It says seven, seven,</p>
<p>and they meet at the five dimensional plane.</p>
<p>It says five.</p>
<p>So we have built this intuition.</p>
<p>Now, this is an example of how we come up with intuition.</p>
<p>Let me give you more examples of it</p>
<p>because I think this will show you</p>
<p>that people have to come up with intuitions to visualize it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we will be a little bit lost.</p>
<p>So what you just described is kind of</p>
<p>in these high dimensional spaces,</p>
<p>focus on the meeting place of two planes</p>
<p>in high dimensional spaces.</p>
<p>Exactly, how the planes meet, for example,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the dimension of their intersection and so on.</p>
<p>So how do we come up with intuition?</p>
<p>We borrow examples from lower dimensions,</p>
<p>build up intuition and draw the same pictures</p>
<p>as if we are talking about 10 dimensions,</p>
<p>but we are drawing the same as a two dimensional plane</p>
<p>because we cannot do any better.</p>
<p>But our words change, but not our pictures.</p>
<p>So your sense is we can have a deep understanding</p>
<p>of reality by looking at its slices,</p>
<p>at lower dimensional slices.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And this brings me to the next example I wanna mention,</p>
<p>which is sphere.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about how do we think about the sphere?</p>
<p>Well, the sphere is a sphere, the round nice thing,</p>
<p>but sphere has a circular symmetry.</p>
<p>Now, I can describe the sphere in the following way.</p>
<p>I can describe it by an interval,</p>
<p>which is thinking about this going from the north</p>
<p>of the sphere to the south.</p>
<p>And at each point, I have a circle attached to it.</p>
<p>So you can think about the sphere as a line</p>
<p>with a circle attached with each point,</p>
<p>the circle shrinks to a point at end points</p>
<p>of the interval.</p>
<p>So I can say, oh, one way to think about the sphere</p>
<p>is an interval where at each point on that interval,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another circle I&rsquo;m not drawing.</p>
<p>But if you like, you can just draw it.</p>
<p>Say, okay, I won&rsquo;t draw it.</p>
<p>So from now on, there&rsquo;s this mnemonic.</p>
<p>I draw an interval when I wanna talk about the sphere</p>
<p>and you remember that the end points of the interval</p>
<p>mean a strong circle, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>And they say, yeah, I see, that&rsquo;s a sphere, good.</p>
<p>Now, we wanna talk about the product of two spheres.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s four dimensional, how can I visualize it?</p>
<p>Easy, you just take an interval and another interval,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just gonna be a square.</p>
<p>A square is a four dimensional space, yeah, why is that?</p>
<p>Well, at each point on the square, there&rsquo;s two circles,</p>
<p>one for each of those directions you drew.</p>
<p>And when you get to the boundaries of each direction,</p>
<p>one of the circles shrink on each edge of that square.</p>
<p>And when you get to the corners of the square,</p>
<p>all both circles shrink.</p>
<p>This is a sphere times a sphere, I have defined interval.</p>
<p>I just described for you a four dimensional space.</p>
<p>Do you want a six dimensional space?</p>
<p>No problem, take a corner of a room.</p>
<p>In fact, if you want to have a sphere times a sphere</p>
<p>times a sphere times a sphere, take a cube.</p>
<p>A cube is a rendition of this six dimensional space,</p>
<p>two sphere times another sphere times another sphere,</p>
<p>where three of the circles I&rsquo;m not drawing for you.</p>
<p>For each one of those directions, there&rsquo;s another circle.</p>
<p>But each time you get to the boundary of the cube,</p>
<p>one circle shrinks.</p>
<p>When the boundaries meet, two circles shrinks.</p>
<p>When three boundaries meet, all the three circles shrink.</p>
<p>So I just give you a picture.</p>
<p>Now, mathematicians come up with amazing things.</p>
<p>Like, you know what, I want to take a point in space</p>
<p>and blow it up.</p>
<p>You know, these concepts like topology and geometry,</p>
<p>complicated, how do you do?</p>
<p>In this picture, it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>
<p>Blow it up in this picture means the following.</p>
<p>You think about this cube, you go to the corner</p>
<p>and you chop off a corner.</p>
<p>Chopping off the corner replaces the point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Replace the point by a triangle.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re blowing up a point and then this triangle</p>
<p>is what they call P2, projective two space.</p>
<p>But these pictures are very physical and you feel it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about six dimension.</p>
<p>Four plus six is 10, the dimension of string theory.</p>
<p>So we can visualize it, no problem.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s building the intuition</p>
<p>to a complicated world of string theory.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these objects are really small.</p>
<p>And just like you said, experimental validation</p>
<p>is very difficult because the objects are way smaller</p>
<p>than anything that we currently have the tools</p>
<p>and accelerators and so on to reveal through experiment.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of skepticism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just about the nature of the theory</p>
<p>because of the 10 dimensions, as you&rsquo;ve explained,</p>
<p>but in that we can&rsquo;t experimentally validate it</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily, to date,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>predict something fundamentally new.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s beautiful as an explaining theory,</p>
<p>which means that it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that it is a fundamental theory</p>
<p>that describes reality and unifies the laws,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still a kind of skepticism.</p>
<p>And me, from sort of an outside observer perspective,</p>
<p>have been observing a little bit of a growing cynicism</p>
<p>about string theory in the recent few years.</p>
<p>Can you describe the cynicism about,</p>
<p>sort of by cynicism I mean a cynicism</p>
<p>about the hope for this theory</p>
<p>of pushing theoretical physics forward?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can you do describe why this is cynicism</p>
<p>and how do we reverse that trend?</p>
<p>Yes, first of all, the criticism for string theory</p>
<p>is healthy in a sense that in science</p>
<p>we have to have different viewpoints and that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So I welcome criticism and the reason for criticism</p>
<p>and I think that is a valid reason</p>
<p>is that there has been zero experimental evidence</p>
<p>for string theory.</p>
<p>That is no experiment has been done</p>
<p>to show that there&rsquo;s this loop of energy moving around.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a valid objection and valid worry.</p>
<p>And if I were to say, you know what,</p>
<p>string theory can never be verified</p>
<p>or experimentally checked, that&rsquo;s the way it is,</p>
<p>they would have every right to say</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re talking about is not science.</p>
<p>Because in science we will have to have</p>
<p>experimental consequences and checks.</p>
<p>The difference between string theory</p>
<p>and something which is not scientific</p>
<p>is that string theory has predictions.</p>
<p>The problem is that the predictions we have today</p>
<p>of string theory is hard to access by experiments</p>
<p>available with the energies we can achieve</p>
<p>with the colliders today.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s a problem with string theory,</p>
<p>it just means technologically we&rsquo;re not that far ahead.</p>
<p>Now, we can have two attitudes.</p>
<p>You say, well, if that&rsquo;s the case, why are you studying</p>
<p>this subject?</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t do experiment today.</p>
<p>Now, this is becoming a little bit more like mathematics</p>
<p>in that sense.</p>
<p>You say, well, I want to learn,</p>
<p>I want to know how the nature works</p>
<p>even though I cannot prove it today</p>
<p>that this is it because of experiments.</p>
<p>That should not prevent my mind not to think about it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the attitude many string theorists follow,</p>
<p>that it should be like this.</p>
<p>Now, so that&rsquo;s an answer to the criticism,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s actually a better answer to the criticism,</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have experimental evidence for string theory,</p>
<p>but we have theoretical evidence for string theory.</p>
<p>And what do I mean by theoretical evidence</p>
<p>for string theory?</p>
<p>String theory has connected different parts</p>
<p>of physics together.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>It has brought connections between part of physics,</p>
<p>although suppose you&rsquo;re just interested</p>
<p>in particle physics.</p>
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re not even interested in gravity at all.</p>
<p>It turns out there are properties</p>
<p>of certain particle physics models</p>
<p>that string theory has been able to solve using gravity,</p>
<p>using ideas from string theory,</p>
<p>ideas known as holography,</p>
<p>which is relating something which has to do with particles</p>
<p>to something having to do with gravity.</p>
<p>Why did it have to be this rich?</p>
<p>The subject is very rich.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something we were smart enough to develop.</p>
<p>It came at us.</p>
<p>As I explained to you,</p>
<p>the development of string theory</p>
<p>came from accidental discovery.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t because we were smart enough</p>
<p>to come up with the idea,</p>
<p>oh yeah, string of course has gravity in it.</p>
<p>No, it was accidental discovery.</p>
<p>So some people say it&rsquo;s not fair to say</p>
<p>we have no evidence for string theory.</p>
<p>Graviton, gravity is an evidence for string theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s predicted by string theory.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t put it by hand, we got it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a qualitative check.</p>
<p>Okay, gravity is a prediction of string theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a postdiction because we know gravity existed.</p>
<p>But still, logically it is a prediction</p>
<p>because really we didn&rsquo;t know it had the graviton</p>
<p>that we later learned that, oh, that&rsquo;s the same as gravity.</p>
<p>So literally that&rsquo;s the way it was discovered.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t put in by hand.</p>
<p>So there are many things like that,</p>
<p>that there are different facets of physics,</p>
<p>like questions in condensed matter physics,</p>
<p>questions of particle physics,</p>
<p>questions about this and that have come together</p>
<p>to find beautiful answers by using ideas</p>
<p>from string theory at the same time</p>
<p>as a lot of new math has emerged.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an aspect which I wouldn&rsquo;t emphasize</p>
<p>as evidence to physicists necessarily,</p>
<p>because they would say, okay, great, you got some math,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s it do with reality?</p>
<p>But as I explained, many of the physical principles</p>
<p>we know of have beautiful math underpinning them.</p>
<p>So it certainly leads further confidence</p>
<p>that we may not be going astray,</p>
<p>even though that&rsquo;s not the full proof as we know.</p>
<p>So there are these aspects that give further evidence</p>
<p>for string theory, connections between each other,</p>
<p>connection with the real world,</p>
<p>but then there are other things that come about</p>
<p>and I can try to give examples of that.</p>
<p>So these are further evidences</p>
<p>and these are certain predictions of string theory.</p>
<p>They are not as detailed as we want,</p>
<p>but there are still predictions.</p>
<p>Why is the dimension of space and time three plus one?</p>
<p>Say, I don&rsquo;t know, just deal with it, three plus one.</p>
<p>But in physics, we want to know why.</p>
<p>Well, take a random dimension from one to infinity.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your random dimension?</p>
<p>A random dimension from one to infinity would not be four.</p>
<p>Eight would most likely be a humongous number,</p>
<p>if not infinity.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no, if you choose any reasonable distribution</p>
<p>which goes from one to infinity,</p>
<p>three or four would not be your pick.</p>
<p>The fact that we are in three or four dimension</p>
<p>is already strange.</p>
<p>The fact that strings are sorry,</p>
<p>I cannot go beyond 10 or maybe 11 or something.</p>
<p>The fact that there&rsquo;s this upper bound,</p>
<p>the range is not from one to infinity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from one to 10 or 11 or whatnot,</p>
<p>it already brings a natural prior.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, three or four is just on the average.</p>
<p>If you pick some of the compactification,</p>
<p>then it could easily be that.</p>
<p>So in other words, it makes it much more possible</p>
<p>that it could be three of our universe.</p>
<p>So the fact that the dimension already is so small,</p>
<p>it should be surprising.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t ask that question.</p>
<p>We should be surprised because we could have conceived</p>
<p>of universes with our pre dimension.</p>
<p>Why is it that we have such a small dimension?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>So good theory of the universe should give you</p>
<p>an intuition of the why it&rsquo;s four or three plus one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not obvious that it should be.</p>
<p>That should be explained.</p>
<p>We take that as an assumption,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a thing that should be explained.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we haven&rsquo;t explained that in string theory.</p>
<p>Actually, I did write a model within string theory</p>
<p>to try to describe why we end up</p>
<p>with three plus one space time dimensions,</p>
<p>which are big compared to the rest of them.</p>
<p>And even though this has not been,</p>
<p>the technical difficulties to prove it is still not there,</p>
<p>but I will explain the idea because the idea connects</p>
<p>to some other piece of elegant math,</p>
<p>which is the following.</p>
<p>Consider a universe made of a box, three dimensional box.</p>
<p>Or in fact, if we start in string theory,</p>
<p>nine dimensional box,</p>
<p>because we have nine spatial dimension on one time.</p>
<p>So imagine a nine dimensional box.</p>
<p>So we should imagine the box of a typical size of the string,</p>
<p>which is small.</p>
<p>So the universe would naturally start</p>
<p>with a very tiny nine dimensional box.</p>
<p>What do strings do?</p>
<p>Well, strings go around the box</p>
<p>and move around and vibrate and all that,</p>
<p>but also they can wrap around one side of the box</p>
<p>to the other because I&rsquo;m imagining a box</p>
<p>with periodic boundary conditions.</p>
<p>So what we call the torus.</p>
<p>So the string can go from one side to the other.</p>
<p>This is what we call a winding string.</p>
<p>The string can wind around the box.</p>
<p>Now, suppose you have, you&rsquo;ve now evolved the universe.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s energy, the universe starts to expand.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t expand too far.</p>
<p>Why is it?</p>
<p>Well, because there are these strings</p>
<p>which are wrapped around</p>
<p>from one side of the wall to the other.</p>
<p>When the universe, the walls of the universe are growing,</p>
<p>it is stretching the string</p>
<p>and the strings are becoming very, very massive.</p>
<p>So it becomes difficult to expand.</p>
<p>It kind of puts a halt on it.</p>
<p>In order to not put a halt,</p>
<p>a string which is going this way</p>
<p>and a string which is going that way</p>
<p>should intersect each other</p>
<p>and disconnect each other and unwind.</p>
<p>So a string which winds this way</p>
<p>and the string which finds the opposite way</p>
<p>should find each other to reconnect</p>
<p>and this way disappear.</p>
<p>So if they find each other and they disappear.</p>
<p>But how can strings find each other?</p>
<p>Well, the string moves and another string moves.</p>
<p>A string is one dimensional, one plus one is two</p>
<p>and one plus one is two and two plus two is four.</p>
<p>In four dimensional space time, they will find each other.</p>
<p>In a higher dimensional space time,</p>
<p>they typically miss each other.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So if the dimension were too big,</p>
<p>they would miss each other,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to expand.</p>
<p>So in order to expand, they have to find each other</p>
<p>and three of them can find each other</p>
<p>and those can expand and the other one will be stuck.</p>
<p>So that explains why within string theory,</p>
<p>these particular dimensions are really big</p>
<p>and full of exciting stuff.</p>
<p>That could be an explanation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a model we suggested with my colleague Brandenberger.</p>
<p>But it turns out to be related to a deep piece of math.</p>
<p>You see, for mathematicians,</p>
<p>manifolds of dimension bigger than four are simple.</p>
<p>Four dimension is the hardest dimension for math,</p>
<p>it turns out.</p>
<p>And it turns out the reason it&rsquo;s difficult is the following.</p>
<p>It turns out that in higher dimension,</p>
<p>you use what&rsquo;s called surgery in mathematical terminology,</p>
<p>where you use these two dimensional tubes</p>
<p>to maneuver them off of each other.</p>
<p>So you have two plus two becoming four.</p>
<p>In higher than four dimension,</p>
<p>you can pass them through each other</p>
<p>without them intersecting.</p>
<p>In four dimension, two plus two</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t allow you to pass them through each other.</p>
<p>So the same techniques that work in higher dimension</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work in four dimension because two plus two is four.</p>
<p>The same reasoning I was just telling you</p>
<p>about strings finding each other in four</p>
<p>ends up to be the reason why four is much more complicated</p>
<p>to classify for mathematicians as well.</p>
<p>So there might be these things.</p>
<p>So I cannot say that this is the reason</p>
<p>that string theory is giving you three plus one,</p>
<p>but it could be a model for it.</p>
<p>And so there are these kinds of ideas</p>
<p>that could underlie why we have three extra dimensions</p>
<p>which are large and the rest of them are small.</p>
<p>But absolutely, we have to have a good reason.</p>
<p>We cannot leave it like that.</p>
<p>Can I ask a tricky human question?</p>
<p>So you are one of the seminal figures in string theory.</p>
<p>You got the Breakthrough Prize.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve worked with Edward Witten.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no Nobel Prize that has been given on string theory.</p>
<p>Credit assignment is tricky in science.</p>
<p>It makes you quite sad, especially big, like LIGO,</p>
<p>big experimental projects when so many incredible people</p>
<p>have been involved and yet the Nobel Prize is annoying</p>
<p>in that it&rsquo;s only given to three people.</p>
<p>Who do you think gets the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>for string theory at first?</p>
<p>If it turns out that it, if not in full, then in part,</p>
<p>is a good model of the way the physics of the universe works.</p>
<p>Who are the key figures?</p>
<p>Maybe let&rsquo;s put Nobel Prize aside.</p>
<p>Who are the key figures?</p>
<p>Okay, I like the second version of the question.</p>
<p>Because I think to try to give a prize to one person</p>
<p>in string theory doesn&rsquo;t do justice to the diversity</p>
<p>of the subject.</p>
<p>That to me is.</p>
<p>So there was quite a lot of incredible people</p>
<p>in the history of string theory.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of people.</p>
<p>I mean, starting with Veneziano,</p>
<p>who wasn&rsquo;t talking about strings.</p>
<p>I mean, he wrote down the beginning of the strings.</p>
<p>We cannot ignore that for sure.</p>
<p>And so you start with that and you go on</p>
<p>with various other figures and so on.</p>
<p>So there are different epochs in string theory</p>
<p>and different people have been pushing it.</p>
<p>And so for example, the early epoch,</p>
<p>we just told you people like Veneziano,</p>
<p>and Nambu, and the Susskind, and others were pushing it.</p>
<p>Green and Schwarz were pushing it and so forth.</p>
<p>So this was, or Scherck and so on.</p>
<p>So these were the initial periods of pioneers,</p>
<p>I would say, of string theory.</p>
<p>And then there were the mid 80s that Edward Witten</p>
<p>was the major proponent of string theory.</p>
<p>And he really changed the landscape of string theory</p>
<p>in terms of what people do and how we view it.</p>
<p>And I think his efforts brought a lot of attention</p>
<p>to the community of string theory.</p>
<p>To the community about high energy community</p>
<p>to focus on this effort as the correct theory</p>
<p>of unification of forces.</p>
<p>So he brought a lot of research as well as, of course,</p>
<p>the first rate work he himself did to this area.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in mid 80s and onwards,</p>
<p>and also in mid 90s where he was one of the proponents</p>
<p>of the duality revolution in string theory.</p>
<p>And with that came a lot of these other ideas</p>
<p>that led to breakthroughs involving, for example,</p>
<p>the example I told you about black holes and holography,</p>
<p>and the work that was later done by Maldacena</p>
<p>about the properties of duality between particle physics</p>
<p>and quantum gravity and the deeper connections</p>
<p>of holography, and it continues.</p>
<p>And there are many people within this range,</p>
<p>which I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned.</p>
<p>They have done fantastic important things.</p>
<p>How it gets recognized, I think, is secondary,</p>
<p>in my opinion, than the appreciation</p>
<p>that the effort is collective.</p>
<p>That, in fact, that to me is the more important part</p>
<p>of science that gets forgotten.</p>
<p>For some reason, humanity likes heroes,</p>
<p>and science is no exception.</p>
<p>We like heroes, but I personally try to avoid that trap.</p>
<p>I feel, in my work, most of my work is with colleagues.</p>
<p>I have much more collaborations than sole author papers,</p>
<p>and I enjoy it, and I think that that&rsquo;s, to me,</p>
<p>one of the most satisfying aspects of science</p>
<p>is to interact and learn and debate ideas with colleagues</p>
<p>because that influx of ideas enriches it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I find it interesting.</p>
<p>To me, science, if I was on an island,</p>
<p>and if I was developing string theory by myself</p>
<p>and had nothing to do with anybody,</p>
<p>it would be much less satisfying, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Even if I could take credit I did it,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t be as satisfying.</p>
<p>Sitting alone with a big metal drinking champagne, no.</p>
<p>I think, to me, the collective work is more exciting,</p>
<p>and you mentioned my getting the breakthrough.</p>
<p>When I was getting it, I made sure to mention</p>
<p>that it is because of the joint work</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve done with colleagues.</p>
<p>At that time, it was around 180 or so collaborators,</p>
<p>and I acknowledged them in the webpage for them.</p>
<p>I write all of their names</p>
<p>and the collaborations that led to this.</p>
<p>So, to me, science is fun when it&rsquo;s collaboration,</p>
<p>and yes, there are more important</p>
<p>and less important figures, as in any field,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s true in string theory as well,</p>
<p>but I think that I would like to view this</p>
<p>as a collective effort.</p>
<p>So, setting the heroes aside,</p>
<p>the Nobel Prize is a celebration of,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right way to put it,</p>
<p>that this idea turned out to be right.</p>
<p>So, like, you look at Einstein</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t believe in black holes,</p>
<p>and then black holes got their Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Do you think string theory will get its Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>Nobel Prizes, if you were to bet money?</p>
<p>If this was an investment meeting</p>
<p>and we had to bet all our money,</p>
<p>do you think he gets the Nobel Prizes?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible that none of the living physicists</p>
<p>will get the Nobel Prize in string theory,</p>
<p>but somebody will.</p>
<p>Because, unfortunately, the technology available today</p>
<p>is not very encouraging</p>
<p>in terms of seeing directly evidence for string theory.</p>
<p>Do you think it ultimately boils down to</p>
<p>the Nobel Prize will be given</p>
<p>when there is some direct or indirect evidence?</p>
<p>There would be, but I think that part of this</p>
<p>breakthrough prize was precisely the appreciation</p>
<p>that when we have sufficient evidence,</p>
<p>theoretical as it is, not experiment,</p>
<p>because of this technology lag,</p>
<p>you appreciate what you think is the correct path.</p>
<p>So, there are many people who have been recognized precisely</p>
<p>because they may not be around</p>
<p>when it actually gets experimented,</p>
<p>even though they discovered it.</p>
<p>So, there are many things like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in science.</p>
<p>So, I think that I would want to attach less significance</p>
<p>to the recognitions of people.</p>
<p>And I have a second review on this,</p>
<p>which is there are people who look at these works</p>
<p>that people have done and put them together</p>
<p>and make the next big breakthrough.</p>
<p>And they get identified with, perhaps rightly,</p>
<p>with many of these new visions.</p>
<p>But they are on the shoulders of these little scientists.</p>
<p>Which don&rsquo;t get any recognition.</p>
<p>You know, yeah, you did this little work.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you did this little work.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, five of you.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, these showed this pattern.</p>
<p>And then somebody else, it&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>To me, those little guys, which kind of like,</p>
<p>like seem to do the little calculation here,</p>
<p>a little thing there, which doesn&rsquo;t rise to the occasion</p>
<p>of this grandiose kind of thing,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make it to the New York Times headlines and so on,</p>
<p>deserve a lot of recognition.</p>
<p>And I think they don&rsquo;t get enough.</p>
<p>I would say that there should be this Nobel prize</p>
<p>for, you know, they have these Doctors Without Borders,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a huge group.</p>
<p>They should do a similar thing.</p>
<p>And these String Theors Without Borders kind of,</p>
<p>everybody is doing a lot of work.</p>
<p>And I think that I would like to see that effort recognized.</p>
<p>I think in the long arc of history,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all little guys and girls</p>
<p>standing on the shoulders of each other.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all going to look tiny in retrospect.</p>
<p>If we celebrate, the New York Times,</p>
<p>you know, as a newspaper,</p>
<p>or the idea of a newspaper in a few centuries from now</p>
<p>will be long forgotten.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree with that.</p>
<p>Especially in the context of String Theory,</p>
<p>we should have a very long term view.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Just as a tiny tangent, we mentioned Edward Witten.</p>
<p>And he, in a bunch of walks of life for me as an outsider,</p>
<p>comes up as a person who is widely considered as like</p>
<p>one of the most brilliant people in the history of physics,</p>
<p>just as a powerhouse of a human,</p>
<p>like the exceptional places that a human mind can rise to.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to work with him.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he like?</p>
<p>Yes, more than that.</p>
<p>He was my advisor, PhD advisor.</p>
<p>So I got to know him very well</p>
<p>and I benefited from his insights.</p>
<p>In fact, what you said about him is accurate.</p>
<p>He is not only brilliant,</p>
<p>but he is also multifaceted in terms of the impact</p>
<p>he has had in not only physics, but also mathematics.</p>
<p>He has gotten the Fields Medal</p>
<p>because of his work in mathematics.</p>
<p>And rightly so, he has used his knowledge of physics</p>
<p>in a way which impacted deep ideas in modern mathematics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an example of the power of these ideas</p>
<p>in modern high energy physics and string theory,</p>
<p>the applicability of it to modern mathematics.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s quite an exceptional individual.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t come across such people a lot in history.</p>
<p>So I think, yes, indeed,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of the rare figures in this history of subject.</p>
<p>He has had great impact on a lot of aspects</p>
<p>of not just string theory,</p>
<p>a lot of different areas in physics,</p>
<p>and also, yes, in mathematics as well.</p>
<p>So I think what you said about him is accurate.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of interacting with him as a student</p>
<p>and later on as colleagues writing papers together</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>What impact did he have on your life?</p>
<p>Like what have you learned from him?</p>
<p>If you were to look at the trajectory of your mind</p>
<p>of the way you approach science and physics and mathematics,</p>
<p>how did he perturb that trajectory in a way?</p>
<p>Yes, he did actually.</p>
<p>So I can explain because when I was a student,</p>
<p>I had the biggest impact by him,</p>
<p>clearly as a grad student at Princeton.</p>
<p>So I think that was a time where I was a little bit confused</p>
<p>about the relation between math and physics.</p>
<p>I got a double major in mathematics and physics</p>
<p>at MIT because I really enjoyed both.</p>
<p>And I liked the elegance and the rigor of mathematics.</p>
<p>And I liked the power of ideas in physics</p>
<p>and its applicability to reality</p>
<p>and what it teaches about the real world around us.</p>
<p>But I saw this tension between rigorous thinking</p>
<p>in mathematics and lack thereof in physics.</p>
<p>And this troubled me to no end.</p>
<p>I was troubled by that.</p>
<p>So I was at crossroads when I decided</p>
<p>to go to graduate school in physics</p>
<p>because I did not like some of the lack of rigors</p>
<p>I was seeing in physics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to me, mathematics,</p>
<p>even though it was rigorous,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see the point of it.</p>
<p>In other words, the math theorem by itself could be beautiful</p>
<p>but I really wanted more than that.</p>
<p>I wanted to say, okay, what does it teach us</p>
<p>about something else, something more than just math?</p>
<p>So I wasn&rsquo;t that enamored with just math</p>
<p>but physics was a little bit bothersome.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I decided to go to physics</p>
<p>and I decided to go to Princeton</p>
<p>and I started working with Edward Witten</p>
<p>as my thesis advisor.</p>
<p>And at that time I was trying to put physics</p>
<p>in rigorous mathematical terms.</p>
<p>I took quantum field theory.</p>
<p>I tried to make rigorous out of it and so on.</p>
<p>And no matter how hard I was trying,</p>
<p>I was not being able to do that.</p>
<p>And I was falling behind from my classes.</p>
<p>I was not learning much physics</p>
<p>and I was not making it rigorous.</p>
<p>And to me, it was this dichotomy between math and physics.</p>
<p>What am I doing?</p>
<p>I like math but this is not exactly this.</p>
<p>There comes Edward Witten as my advisor</p>
<p>and I see him in action thinking about math and physics.</p>
<p>He was amazing in math.</p>
<p>He knew all about the math.</p>
<p>It was no problem with him.</p>
<p>But he thought about physics in a way</p>
<p>which did not find this tension between the two.</p>
<p>It was much more harmonious.</p>
<p>For him, he would draw the Feynman diagrams</p>
<p>but he wouldn&rsquo;t view it as a formalism.</p>
<p>He was viewed, oh yeah, the particle goes over there</p>
<p>and this is what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And so wait, you&rsquo;re thinking really,</p>
<p>is this particle, this is really electron going there?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the form or the result perturbation.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You just feel like the electron.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re moving with this guy and do that and so on.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re thinking invariantly about physics</p>
<p>or the way he thought about relativity.</p>
<p>Like I was thinking about this momentum system.</p>
<p>He was thinking invariantly about physics,</p>
<p>just like the way you think about invariant concepts</p>
<p>and relativity, which don&rsquo;t depend on the frame of reference.</p>
<p>He was thinking about the physics in invariant ways,</p>
<p>the way that doesn&rsquo;t, that gives you a bigger perspective.</p>
<p>So this gradually helped me appreciate</p>
<p>that interconnections between ideas and physics</p>
<p>replaces mathematical rigor.</p>
<p>That the different facets reinforce each other.</p>
<p>They say, oh, I cannot rigorously define</p>
<p>what I mean by this,</p>
<p>but this thing connects with this other physics I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>and this other thing.</p>
<p>And they together form an elegant story.</p>
<p>And that replaced for me what I believed as a solidness,</p>
<p>which I found in math as a rigor, solid.</p>
<p>I found that replaced the rigor and solidness in physics.</p>
<p>So I found, okay, that&rsquo;s the way you can hang onto.</p>
<p>It is not wishy washy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like somebody is just not being able to prove it,</p>
<p>just making up a story.</p>
<p>It was more than that.</p>
<p>And it was no tension with mathematics.</p>
<p>In fact, mathematics was helping it, like friends.</p>
<p>And so much more harmonious and gives insights to physics.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think, one of the main things I learned</p>
<p>from interactions with Witten.</p>
<p>And I think that now perhaps I have taken that</p>
<p>to a far extreme.</p>
<p>Maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t go this far as I have.</p>
<p>Namely, I use physics to define new mathematics</p>
<p>in a way which would be far less rigorous</p>
<p>than a physicist might necessarily believe,</p>
<p>because I take the physical intuition,</p>
<p>perhaps literally in many ways that could teach us about.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;ve gained so much confidence</p>
<p>in physical intuition that I make bold statements</p>
<p>that sometimes takes math friends off guard.</p>
<p>So an example of it is mirror symmetry.</p>
<p>So we were studying these compactification</p>
<p>of string geometries.</p>
<p>This is after my PhD now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, by the time I come to Harvard,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re studying these aspects of string compactification</p>
<p>on these complicated manifolds,</p>
<p>six dimensional spaces called Kalabial manifolds,</p>
<p>very complicated.</p>
<p>And I noticed with a couple other colleagues</p>
<p>that there was a symmetry in physics suggested</p>
<p>between different Kalabials.</p>
<p>It suggested that you couldn&rsquo;t actually compute</p>
<p>the Euler characteristic of a Kalabia.</p>
<p>Euler characteristic is counting the number of points</p>
<p>minus the number of edges plus the number of faces minus.</p>
<p>So you can count the alternating sequence</p>
<p>of properties of a space,</p>
<p>which is a topological property of a space.</p>
<p>So Euler characteristics of the Kalabia</p>
<p>was a property of the space.</p>
<p>And so we noticed that from the physics formalism,</p>
<p>if string moves in a Kalabia,</p>
<p>you cannot distinguish,</p>
<p>we cannot compute the Euler characteristic.</p>
<p>You can only compute the absolute value of it.</p>
<p>Now this bothered us</p>
<p>because how could you not compute the actual sign</p>
<p>unless the both sides were the same?</p>
<p>So I conjectured maybe for every Kalabia</p>
<p>with Euler characteristics positive,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one with negative.</p>
<p>I told this to my colleague Yao</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s namesake is Kalabia,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m making this conjecture.</p>
<p>Is it possible that for every Kalabia,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one with the opposite Euler characteristic?</p>
<p>Sounds not reasonable.</p>
<p>I said, why?</p>
<p>He said, well, we know more Kalabias</p>
<p>with negative Euler characteristics than positive.</p>
<p>I said, but physics says we cannot distinguish them.</p>
<p>At least I don&rsquo;t see how.</p>
<p>So we conjectured that for every Kalabia</p>
<p>with one sign, there&rsquo;s the other one,</p>
<p>despite the mathematical evidence,</p>
<p>despite the expert telling us it&rsquo;s not the right idea.</p>
<p>If a few years later, this symmetry, mirror symmetry</p>
<p>between the sign with the opposite sign</p>
<p>was later confirmed by mathematicians.</p>
<p>So this is actually the opposite view.</p>
<p>That is physics is so sure about it</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going against the mathematical wisdom,</p>
<p>telling them they better look for it.</p>
<p>So taking the physical intuition literally</p>
<p>and then having that drive the mathematics.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And now we are so confident about many such examples</p>
<p>that has affected modern mathematics in ways like this,</p>
<p>that we are much more confident</p>
<p>about our understanding of what string theory is.</p>
<p>These are another aspects,</p>
<p>other aspects of why we feel string theory is correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing these kinds of things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing your talk quite a bit</p>
<p>about string theory, landscape and the swamp land.</p>
<p>What the heck are those two concepts?</p>
<p>Okay, very good question.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to what I was describing about Feynman.</p>
<p>Feynman was trying to do these diagrams for graviton</p>
<p>and electrons and all that.</p>
<p>He found that he&rsquo;s getting infinities he cannot resolve.</p>
<p>Okay, the natural conclusion is that field theories</p>
<p>and gravity and quantum theory don&rsquo;t go together</p>
<p>and you cannot have it.</p>
<p>So in other words, field theories and gravity</p>
<p>are inconsistent with quantum mechanics, period.</p>
<p>String theory came up with examples</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t address the question more broadly</p>
<p>that is it true that every field theory</p>
<p>can be coupled to gravity in a quantum mechanical way?</p>
<p>It turns out that Feynman was essentially right.</p>
<p>Almost all particle physics theories,</p>
<p>no matter what you add to it,</p>
<p>when you put gravity in it, doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Only rare exceptions work.</p>
<p>So string theory are those rare exceptions.</p>
<p>So therefore the general principle</p>
<p>that Feynman found was correct.</p>
<p>Quantum field theory and gravity and quantum mechanics</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go together except for Joule&rsquo;s exceptional cases.</p>
<p>There are exceptional cases.</p>
<p>Okay, the total vastness of quantum field theories</p>
<p>that are there we call the set of quantum field theories,</p>
<p>possible things.</p>
<p>Which ones can be consistently coupled to gravity?</p>
<p>We call that subspace the landscape.</p>
<p>The rest of them we call the swampland.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they are bad quantum field theories,</p>
<p>they are perfectly fine.</p>
<p>But when you couple them to gravity,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t make sense, unfortunately.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the ratio of them,</p>
<p>the number of theories which are consistent with gravity</p>
<p>to the ones without,</p>
<p>the ratio of the area of the landscape</p>
<p>to the swampland, in other words, is measure zero.</p>
<p>So the swampland&rsquo;s infinitely large?</p>
<p>The swampland&rsquo;s infinitely large.</p>
<p>So let me give you one example.</p>
<p>Take a theory in four dimension with matter</p>
<p>with maximum amount of supersymmetry.</p>
<p>Can you get, it turns out a theory in four dimension</p>
<p>with maximum amount of supersymmetry</p>
<p>is characterized just with one thing, a group.</p>
<p>What we call the gauge group.</p>
<p>Once you pick a group, you have to find the theory.</p>
<p>Okay, so does every group make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As far as quantum field theory, every group makes sense.</p>
<p>There are infinitely many groups,</p>
<p>there are infinitely many quantum field theories.</p>
<p>But it turns out there are only finite number of them</p>
<p>which are consistent with gravity out of that same list.</p>
<p>So you can take any group but only finite number of them,</p>
<p>the ones who&rsquo;s, what we call the rank of the group,</p>
<p>the ones whose rank is less than 23.</p>
<p>Any one bigger than rank 23 belongs to the swampland.</p>
<p>There are infinitely many of them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re beautiful field theories,</p>
<p>but not when you include gravity.</p>
<p>So then this becomes a hopeful thing.</p>
<p>So in other words, in our universe, we have gravity.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are part of that jewel subset.</p>
<p>Now, is this jewel subset small or large?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It turns out that subset is humongous,</p>
<p>but we believe still finite.</p>
<p>The set of possibilities is infinite,</p>
<p>but the set of consistent ones,</p>
<p>I mean, the set of quantum field theories are infinite,</p>
<p>but the consistent ones are finite, but humongous.</p>
<p>The fact that they&rsquo;re humongous</p>
<p>is the problem we are facing in string theory,</p>
<p>because we do not know which one of these possibilities</p>
<p>the universe we live in.</p>
<p>If we knew, we could make more specific predictions</p>
<p>about our universe.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that is one of the challenges when string theory,</p>
<p>which point on the landscape,</p>
<p>which corner of this landscape do we live in?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So what do we do?</p>
<p>Well, there are principles that are beginning to emerge.</p>
<p>So I will give you one example of it.</p>
<p>You look at the patterns of what you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>in terms of these good ones,</p>
<p>the ones which are in the landscape</p>
<p>compared to the ones which are not.</p>
<p>You find certain patterns.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one pattern.</p>
<p>You find in all the ones that you get from string theory,</p>
<p>gravitational force is always there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always, always the weakest force.</p>
<p>However, you could easily imagine field theories</p>
<p>for which gravity is not the weakest force.</p>
<p>For example, take our universe.</p>
<p>If you take mass of the electron,</p>
<p>if you increase the mass of electron by a huge factor,</p>
<p>the gravitational attraction of the electrons</p>
<p>will be bigger than the electric repulsion</p>
<p>between two electrons.</p>
<p>And the gravity will be stronger.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>It happens that it&rsquo;s not the case in our universe</p>
<p>because electron is very tiny in mass compared to that.</p>
<p>Just like our universe, gravity is the weakest force.</p>
<p>We find in all these other ones,</p>
<p>which are part of the good ones,</p>
<p>the gravity is the weakest force.</p>
<p>This is called the weak gravity conjecture.</p>
<p>We conjecture that all the points in the landscape</p>
<p>have this property.</p>
<p>Our universe being just an example of it.</p>
<p>So there are these qualitative features</p>
<p>that we are beginning to see.</p>
<p>But how do we argue for this?</p>
<p>Just by looking patterns?</p>
<p>Just by looking string theory as this?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>We need more reason, more better reasoning.</p>
<p>And it turns out there is.</p>
<p>The reasoning for this turns out to be studying black holes.</p>
<p>Ideas of black holes turn out to put certain restrictions</p>
<p>of what a good quantum filter should be.</p>
<p>It turns out using black hole,</p>
<p>the fact that the black holes evaporate,</p>
<p>the fact that the black holes evaporate</p>
<p>gives you a way to check the relation</p>
<p>between the mass and the charge of elementary particle.</p>
<p>Because what you can do, you can take a charged particle</p>
<p>and throw it into a charged black hole</p>
<p>and wait it to evaporate.</p>
<p>And by looking at the properties of evaporation,</p>
<p>you find that if it cannot evaporate particles</p>
<p>whose mass is less than their charge,</p>
<p>then it will never evaporate.</p>
<p>You will be stuck.</p>
<p>And so the possibility of a black hole evaporation</p>
<p>forces you to have particles whose mass</p>
<p>is sufficiently small so that the gravity is weaker.</p>
<p>So you connect this fact to the other fact.</p>
<p>So we begin to find different facts</p>
<p>that reinforce each other.</p>
<p>So different parts of the physics reinforce each other.</p>
<p>And once they all kind of come together,</p>
<p>you believe that you&rsquo;re getting the principle correct.</p>
<p>So weak gravity conjecture</p>
<p>is one of the principles we believe in</p>
<p>as a necessity of these conditions.</p>
<p>So these are the predictions string theory are making.</p>
<p>Is that enough?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s qualitative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a semi quantity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the mass of the electron</p>
<p>should be less than some number.</p>
<p>But that number is, if I call that number one,</p>
<p>the mass of the electron</p>
<p>turns out to be 10 to the minus 20 actually.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s much less than one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not one.</p>
<p>But on the other hand,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a similar reasoning for a big black hole</p>
<p>in our universe.</p>
<p>And if that evaporation should take place,</p>
<p>gives you another restriction,</p>
<p>tells you the mass of the electron</p>
<p>is bigger than 10 to the,</p>
<p>now in this case, bigger than something.</p>
<p>It shows bigger than 10 to the minus 30 in the Planck unit.</p>
<p>So you find, huh,</p>
<p>the mass of the electron should be less than one,</p>
<p>but bigger than 10 to the minus 30.</p>
<p>In our universe,</p>
<p>the mass of the electron is 10 to the minus 20.</p>
<p>Okay, now this kind of you could call postiction,</p>
<p>but I would say it follows from principles</p>
<p>that we now understand from string theory, first principle.</p>
<p>So we are making, beginning to make</p>
<p>these kinds of predictions,</p>
<p>which are very much connected to aspects of particle physics</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t think are related to gravity.</p>
<p>We thought, just take any electron mass you want.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>It has a problem with gravity.</p>
<p>And so that conjecture</p>
<p>has also a happy consequence</p>
<p>that it explains that our universe,</p>
<p>like why the heck is gravity so weak as a force</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not only an accident, but almost a necessity</p>
<p>if these forces are to coexist effectively?</p>
<p>Exactly, so that&rsquo;s the reinforcement</p>
<p>of what we know in our universe,</p>
<p>but we are finding that as a general principle.</p>
<p>So we want to know what aspects of our universe</p>
<p>is forced on us,</p>
<p>like the weak gravity conjecture and other aspects.</p>
<p>How much of them do we understand?</p>
<p>Can we have particles lighter than neutrinos?</p>
<p>Or maybe that&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>You see the neutrino mass,</p>
<p>it turns out to be related to dark energy</p>
<p>in a mysterious way.</p>
<p>Naively, there&rsquo;s no relation between dark energy</p>
<p>and the mass of a particle.</p>
<p>We have found arguments</p>
<p>from within the swampland kind of ideas,</p>
<p>why it has to be related.</p>
<p>And so there are beginning to be these connections</p>
<p>between graph consistency of quantum gravity</p>
<p>and aspects of our universe gradually being sharpened.</p>
<p>But we are still far from a precise quantitative prediction</p>
<p>like we have to have such and such, but that&rsquo;s the hope,</p>
<p>that we are going in that direction.</p>
<p>Coming up with the theory of everything</p>
<p>that unifies general relativity and quantum field theory</p>
<p>is one of the big dreams of human civilization.</p>
<p>Us descendants of apes wondering about how this world works.</p>
<p>So a lot of people dream.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about sort of other out there ideas,</p>
<p>theories of everything or unifying theories?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a quantum loop gravity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also more sort of like a friend of mine,</p>
<p>Eric Weinstein beginning to propose</p>
<p>something called geometric unity.</p>
<p>So these kinds of attempts,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s through mathematical physics</p>
<p>or through other avenues,</p>
<p>or with Stephen Wolfram,</p>
<p>a more computational view of the universe.</p>
<p>Again, in his case, it&rsquo;s these hyper graphs</p>
<p>that are very tiny objects as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, a string theory</p>
<p>and trying to grapple with this world.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Is there any of these theories that are compelling to you,</p>
<p>that are interesting that may turn out to be true</p>
<p>or at least may turn out to contain ideas that are useful?</p>
<p>Yes, I think the latter.</p>
<p>I would say that the containing ideas that are true</p>
<p>is my opinion was what some of these ideas might be.</p>
<p>For example, loop quantum gravity</p>
<p>is to me not a complete theory of gravity in any sense,</p>
<p>but they have some nuggets of truth in them.</p>
<p>And typically what I expect to happen,</p>
<p>and I have seen examples of this within string theory,</p>
<p>aspects which we didn&rsquo;t think are part of string theory</p>
<p>come to be part of it.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ll give you one example.</p>
<p>String was believed to be 10 dimensional.</p>
<p>And then there was this 11 dimensional super gravity.</p>
<p>Nobody know what the heck is that?</p>
<p>Why are we getting 11 dimensional super gravity</p>
<p>whereas string is saying it should be 10 dimensional?</p>
<p>11 was the maximum dimension you can have a super gravity,</p>
<p>but string was saying, sorry, we&rsquo;re 10 dimensional.</p>
<p>So for a while we thought that theory is wrong</p>
<p>because how could it be?</p>
<p>Because string theory is definitely a theory of everything.</p>
<p>We later learned that one of the circles</p>
<p>of string theory itself was tiny,</p>
<p>that we had not appreciated that fact.</p>
<p>And we discovered by doing thought experiments</p>
<p>of string theory that there&rsquo;s gotta be an extra circle</p>
<p>and that circle is connected</p>
<p>to an 11 dimensional perspective.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what later on got called M theory.</p>
<p>So there are these kinds of things</p>
<p>that we do not know what exactly string theory is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still learning.</p>
<p>So we do not have a final formulation of string theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very well could be the different facets</p>
<p>of different ideas come together</p>
<p>like loop quantum gravity or whatnot,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t put them on par.</p>
<p>Namely, loop quantum gravity is a scatter of ideas</p>
<p>about what happens to space when they get very tiny.</p>
<p>For example, you replace things by discrete data</p>
<p>and try to quantize it and so on.</p>
<p>And it sounds like a natural idea to quantize space.</p>
<p>If you were naively trying to do quantum space,</p>
<p>you might think about trying to take points</p>
<p>and put them together in some discrete fashion</p>
<p>in some way that is reminiscent of loop quantum gravity.</p>
<p>String theory is more subtle than that.</p>
<p>For example, I will just give you an example.</p>
<p>And this is the kind of thing that we didn&rsquo;t put in by hand,</p>
<p>we got it out.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s more subtle than,</p>
<p>so what happens if you squeeze the space</p>
<p>to be smaller and smaller?</p>
<p>Well, you think that after a certain distance,</p>
<p>the notion of distance should break down.</p>
<p>You know, when you go smaller than Planck scale,</p>
<p>should break down.</p>
<p>What happens in string theory?</p>
<p>We do not know the full answer to that,</p>
<p>but we know the following.</p>
<p>Namely, if you take a space</p>
<p>and bring it smaller and smaller,</p>
<p>if the box gets smaller than the Planck scale</p>
<p>by a factor of 10,</p>
<p>it is equivalent by the duality transformation</p>
<p>to a space which is 10 times bigger.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a symmetry called T duality,</p>
<p>which takes L to one over L.</p>
<p>Well, L is measured in Planck units,</p>
<p>or more precisely string units.</p>
<p>This inversion is a very subtle effect.</p>
<p>And I would not have been,</p>
<p>or any physicist would not have been able to design a theory</p>
<p>which has this property,</p>
<p>that when you make the space smaller,</p>
<p>it is as if you&rsquo;re making it bigger.</p>
<p>That means there is no experiment you can do</p>
<p>to distinguish the size of the space.</p>
<p>This is remarkable.</p>
<p>For example, Einstein would have said,</p>
<p>of course I can&rsquo;t measure the size of the space.</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>Well, I take a flashlight,</p>
<p>I send the light around,</p>
<p>measure how long it takes for the light</p>
<p>to go around the space,</p>
<p>and bring back and find the radius</p>
<p>or circumference of the universe.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>I said, well, suppose you do that,</p>
<p>and you shrink it.</p>
<p>He said, well, it gets smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>I said, well, it turns out in string theory,</p>
<p>there are two different kinds of photons.</p>
<p>One photon measures one over L,</p>
<p>the other one measures L.</p>
<p>And so this duality reformulates.</p>
<p>And when the space gets smaller,</p>
<p>it says, oh no, you better use the bigger perspective</p>
<p>because the smaller one is harder to deal with.</p>
<p>So you do this one.</p>
<p>So these examples of loop quantum gravity</p>
<p>have none of these features.</p>
<p>These features that I&rsquo;m telling you about,</p>
<p>we have learned from string theory.</p>
<p>But they nevertheless have some of these ideas</p>
<p>like topological gravity aspects</p>
<p>are emphasized in the context of loop quantum gravity</p>
<p>in some form.</p>
<p>And so these ideas might be there in some kernel,</p>
<p>in some corners of string theory.</p>
<p>In fact, I wrote a paper about topological string theory</p>
<p>and some connections with potentially loop quantum gravity,</p>
<p>which could be part of that.</p>
<p>So there are little facets of connections.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re complete,</p>
<p>but I would say most probably what will happen</p>
<p>to some of these ideas, the good ones at least,</p>
<p>they will be absorbed to string theory,</p>
<p>if they are correct.</p>
<p>Let me ask a crazy out there question.</p>
<p>Can physics help us understand life?</p>
<p>So we spoke so confidently about the laws of physics</p>
<p>being able to explain reality.</p>
<p>But, and we even said words like theory of everything,</p>
<p>implying that the word everything</p>
<p>is actually describing everything.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the four laws we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>are actually missing,</p>
<p>they are accurate in describing what they&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re missing the description</p>
<p>of a lot of other things,</p>
<p>like emergence of life</p>
<p>and emergence of perhaps consciousness.</p>
<p>So is there, do you ever think about this kind of stuff</p>
<p>where we would need to understand extra physics</p>
<p>to try to explain the emergence of these complex pockets</p>
<p>of interesting weird stuff that we call life</p>
<p>and consciousness in this big homogeneous universe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mostly boring and nothing is happening yet?</p>
<p>So first of all, we don&rsquo;t claim that string theory</p>
<p>is the theory of everything in the sense that</p>
<p>we know enough what this theory is.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know enough about string theory itself,</p>
<p>we are learning it.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t say, okay, give me whatever,</p>
<p>I will tell you how it works, no.</p>
<p>However, I would say by definition,</p>
<p>by definition to me physics is checking all reality.</p>
<p>Any form of reality, I call it physics,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my definition.</p>
<p>I mean, I may not know a lot of it,</p>
<p>like maybe the origin of life and so on,</p>
<p>maybe a piece of that,</p>
<p>but I would call that as part of physics.</p>
<p>To me, reality is what we&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim I know everything about reality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim string theory necessarily has the tools</p>
<p>right now to describe all the reality either,</p>
<p>but we are learning what it is.</p>
<p>So I would say that I would not put a border to say,</p>
<p>no, from this point onwards, it&rsquo;s not my territory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But whether we need new ideas in string theory</p>
<p>to describe other reality features, for sure I believe,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, I don&rsquo;t believe any of the laws</p>
<p>we know today is final.</p>
<p>So therefore, yes, we will need new ideas.</p>
<p>This is a very tricky thing for us to understand</p>
<p>and be precise about.</p>
<p>But just because you understand the physics</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you understand</p>
<p>the emergence of chemistry, biology, life,</p>
<p>intelligence, consciousness.</p>
<p>So those are built, it&rsquo;s like you might understand</p>
<p>the way bricks work, but to understand what it means</p>
<p>to have a happy family, you don&rsquo;t get from the bricks.</p>
<p>So directly, in theory you could,</p>
<p>if you ran the universe over again,</p>
<p>but just understanding the rules of the universe</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily give you a sense</p>
<p>of the weird, beautiful things that emerge.</p>
<p>Right, no, so let me describe what you just said.</p>
<p>So there are two questions.</p>
<p>One is whether or not the techniques I use</p>
<p>in let&rsquo;s say quantum field theory and so on</p>
<p>will describe how the society works.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s far different scales of questions</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re asking here.</p>
<p>The question is, is there a change of,</p>
<p>is there a new law which takes over</p>
<p>that cannot be connected to the older laws</p>
<p>that we know, or more fundamental laws that we know?</p>
<p>Do you need new laws to describe it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s necessarily the case</p>
<p>in many of these phenomena like chemistry</p>
<p>or so on you mentioned.</p>
<p>So we do expect in principle chemistry</p>
<p>can be described by quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s gonna be a magical thing,</p>
<p>but chemistry is complicated.</p>
<p>Yeah, indeed, there are rules of chemistry</p>
<p>that chemists have put down which has not been explained yet</p>
<p>using quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Do I believe that they will be something</p>
<p>described by quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they are going to be sitting there</p>
<p>in this just forever, but maybe it&rsquo;s too complicated</p>
<p>and maybe we&rsquo;ll wait for very powerful quantum computers</p>
<p>or whatnot to solve those problems.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think in that context</p>
<p>we have new principles to be added to fix those.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m perfectly fine in the intermediate situation</p>
<p>to have rules of thumb or principles that chemists have found</p>
<p>which are working, which are not founded</p>
<p>on the basis of quantum mechanical laws, which does the job.</p>
<p>Similarly, as biologists do not found everything</p>
<p>in terms of chemistry, but they think,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why chemistry cannot.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think necessarily they&rsquo;re doing something</p>
<p>amazingly not possible with chemistry.</p>
<p>Coming back to your question,</p>
<p>does consciousness, for example, bring this new ingredient?</p>
<p>If indeed it needs a new ingredient,</p>
<p>I will call that new ingredient part of physical law.</p>
<p>We have to understand it.</p>
<p>To me that, so I wouldn&rsquo;t put a line to say,</p>
<p>okay, from this point onwards, it&rsquo;s disconnected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fully disconnected from string theory or whatever.</p>
<p>We have to do something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a line.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to is can physics of a few centuries</p>
<p>from now that doesn&rsquo;t understand consciousness</p>
<p>be much bigger than the physics of today,</p>
<p>where the textbook grows?</p>
<p>It definitely will.</p>
<p>I would say, it will grow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it grows because of consciousness</p>
<p>being part of it or we have different view of consciousness.</p>
<p>I do not know where the consciousness will fit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be hard for me to guess.</p>
<p>I mean, I can make random guesses now</p>
<p>which probably most likely is wrong,</p>
<p>but let me just do just for the sake of discussion.</p>
<p>I could say, brain could be their quantum computer,</p>
<p>classical computer.</p>
<p>Their arguments against this being a quantum thing,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s probably classical, and if it&rsquo;s classical,</p>
<p>it could be like what we are doing in machine learning,</p>
<p>slightly more fancy and so on.</p>
<p>Okay, people can go to this argument to no end</p>
<p>and to some whether consciousness exists or not,</p>
<p>or life, does it have any meaning?</p>
<p>Or is there a phase transition where you can say,</p>
<p>does electron have a life or not?</p>
<p>At what level does a particle become life?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s no definite definition of life</p>
<p>in that same way that, we cannot say electron,</p>
<p>if you, I like this example quite a bit.</p>
<p>We distinguish between liquid and a gas phase,</p>
<p>like water is liquid or vapor is gas,</p>
<p>and we say they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>You can distinguish them.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true because we know from physics</p>
<p>that you can change temperatures and pressure</p>
<p>to go from liquid to the gas</p>
<p>without making any phase transition.</p>
<p>So there is no point that you can say this was a liquid</p>
<p>and this was a gas.</p>
<p>You can continuously change the parameters</p>
<p>to go from one to the other.</p>
<p>So at the end, it&rsquo;s very different looking.</p>
<p>Like, I know that water is different from vapor,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no precise point this happens.</p>
<p>I feel many of these things that we think,</p>
<p>like consciousness, clearly dead person</p>
<p>is not conscious and the other one is.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a difference like water and vapor,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no point you could say that this is conscious.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no sharp transition.</p>
<p>So it could very well be that what we call heuristically</p>
<p>in daily life, consciousness is similar,</p>
<p>or life is similar to that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s like that or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just hypothesizing it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no discrete phases.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no discrete phase transition like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but there might be concepts of temperature</p>
<p>and pressure that we need to understand</p>
<p>to describe what the head consciousness in life is</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re totally missing.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s not a useless question.</p>
<p>Even those questions,</p>
<p>they is back to our original discussion of philosophy.</p>
<p>I would say consciousness and free will, for example,</p>
<p>are topics that are very much so</p>
<p>in the realm of philosophy currently.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think they will always be.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m fine with some topics</p>
<p>being part of a different realm than physics today</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have the right tools,</p>
<p>just like biology was.</p>
<p>I mean, before we had DNA and all that genetics</p>
<p>and all that gradually began to take hold.</p>
<p>I mean, when people were beginning phase experiments</p>
<p>with biology and chemistry and so on,</p>
<p>gradually they came together.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t like together.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;d be perfectly understanding of a situation</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t have the tools.</p>
<p>So do these experiments that you think</p>
<p>as defines a conscious in different form</p>
<p>and gradually we&rsquo;ll build it and connect it.</p>
<p>And yes, we might discover new principles of nature</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I would say that if they are,</p>
<p>they will be deeply connected with the else.</p>
<p>We have seen in physics,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have things in isolation.</p>
<p>You cannot compartmentalize,</p>
<p>this is gravity, this is electricity, this is that.</p>
<p>We have learned they all talk to each other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to make them in one corner and don&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>So the same thing with anything, anything which is real.</p>
<p>So consciousness is real.</p>
<p>So therefore we have to connect it to everything else.</p>
<p>So to me, once you connect it,</p>
<p>you cannot say it&rsquo;s not reality.</p>
<p>And once it&rsquo;s reality, it&rsquo;s physics.</p>
<p>I call it physics.</p>
<p>It may not be the physics I know today, for sure it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but I would be surprised if there&rsquo;s disconnected realities</p>
<p>that you cannot imagine them as part of the same soup.</p>
<p>So I guess God doesn&rsquo;t have a biology or chemistry textbook</p>
<p>and mostly, or maybe he or she reads it for fun,</p>
<p>biology and chemistry,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re trying to get some work done,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be going to the physics textbook.</p>
<p>Okay, what advice, let&rsquo;s put on your wise visionary hat.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for young people today?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve dedicated your book actually to your kids,</p>
<p>to your family.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to them?</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people today</p>
<p>thinking about their career, thinking about life,</p>
<p>of how to live successful life, how to live a good life?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I have three sons.</p>
<p>And in fact, to them, I have tried not to give</p>
<p>too much advice.</p>
<p>So even though I&rsquo;ve tried to kind of not give advice,</p>
<p>maybe indirectly it has been some impact.</p>
<p>My oldest one is doing biophysics, for example,</p>
<p>and the second one is doing machine learning</p>
<p>and the third one is doing theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>So there are these facets of interest</p>
<p>which are not too far from my area,</p>
<p>but I have not tried to impact them in that way,</p>
<p>but they have followed their own interests.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the advice I would give</p>
<p>to any young person, follow your own interests</p>
<p>and let that take you wherever it takes you.</p>
<p>And this I did in my own case that I was planning</p>
<p>to study economics and electrical engineering</p>
<p>when I started at MIT.</p>
<p>And I discovered that I&rsquo;m more passionate</p>
<p>about math and physics.</p>
<p>And at that time I didn&rsquo;t feel math and physics</p>
<p>would make a good career.</p>
<p>And so I was kind of hesitant to go in that direction,</p>
<p>but I did because I kind of felt that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m driven to do.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t regret it, I&rsquo;m lucky in the sense</p>
<p>that society supports people like me</p>
<p>who are doing these abstract stuff,</p>
<p>which may or may not be experimentally verified</p>
<p>even let alone applied to the technology in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky I&rsquo;m doing that.</p>
<p>And I feel that if people follow their interests,</p>
<p>they will find the niche that they&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>And this coincidence of hopefully their interests</p>
<p>and abilities are kind of aligned,</p>
<p>at least some extent to be able to drive them</p>
<p>to something which is successful.</p>
<p>And not to be driven by things like,</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t make a good career,</p>
<p>or this doesn&rsquo;t do that, and my parents expect that,</p>
<p>or what about this?</p>
<p>And I think ultimately you have to live with yourself</p>
<p>and you only have one life and it&rsquo;s short, very short.</p>
<p>I can tell you I&rsquo;m getting there.</p>
<p>So I know it&rsquo;s short.</p>
<p>So you really want not to do things</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>So I think following an interest</p>
<p>is my strongest advice to young people.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s scary when your interest</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t directly map to a career of the past or of today.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re almost anticipating future careers</p>
<p>that could be created.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s something to that,</p>
<p>especially when the interest and the ability align,</p>
<p>that you will pave a path,</p>
<p>that will find a way to make money,</p>
<p>especially in this society,</p>
<p>in a capitalistic United States society.</p>
<p>It feels like ability and passion paves the way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>At the very least, you can sell funny T shirts.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned life is short.</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about my mortality.</p>
<p>I think that I don&rsquo;t think about my death.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about death in general too much.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s something that I can&rsquo;t do much about,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t drive my everyday action.</p>
<p>It is natural to expect</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s somewhat like the time reversal situation.</p>
<p>So we believe that we have this approximate symmetry</p>
<p>in nature, time reversal.</p>
<p>Going forward, we die.</p>
<p>Going backwards, we get born.</p>
<p>So what was it to get born?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t such a good or bad feeling.</p>
<p>I have no feeling of it.</p>
<p>So who knows what the death will feel like,</p>
<p>the moment of death or whatnot.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It is not known,</p>
<p>but in what form do we exist before or after?</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s something that it&rsquo;s partly philosophical maybe.</p>
<p>I like how you draw comfort from symmetry.</p>
<p>It does seem that there is something asymmetric here,</p>
<p>a breaking of symmetry,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something to the creative force</p>
<p>of the human spirit that goes only one way.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That it seems the finiteness of life</p>
<p>is the thing that drives the creativity.</p>
<p>And so it does seem that at least the contemplation</p>
<p>of the finiteness of life, of mortality,</p>
<p>is the thing that helps you get your stuff together.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but actually I have a different perspective</p>
<p>on that a little bit.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Namely, suppose I told you you&rsquo;re immortal.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think your life will be totally boring after that,</p>
<p>because you will not,</p>
<p>I think part of the reason we have enjoyment in life</p>
<p>is the finiteness of it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so I think mortality might be a blessing,</p>
<p>and immortality may not.</p>
<p>So I think that we value things</p>
<p>because we have that finite life.</p>
<p>We appreciate things.</p>
<p>We want to do this.</p>
<p>We want to do that.</p>
<p>We have motivation.</p>
<p>If I told you, you know, you have infinite life.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t need to do this today.</p>
<p>I have another billion or trillion or infinite life.</p>
<p>So why do I do now?</p>
<p>There is no motivation.</p>
<p>A lot of the things that we do</p>
<p>are driven by that finiteness of these resources.</p>
<p>So I think it is a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t regret it that we have more finite life.</p>
<p>And I think that the process of being part of this thing,</p>
<p>that, you know, the reality,</p>
<p>to me, part of what attracts me to science</p>
<p>is to connect to that immortality kind of,</p>
<p>namely the laws, the reality beyond us.</p>
<p>To me, I&rsquo;m resigned to the fact that not only me,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s going to die.</p>
<p>So this is a little bit of a consolation.</p>
<p>None of us are going to be around.</p>
<p>So therefore, okay,</p>
<p>and none of the people before me are around.</p>
<p>So therefore, yeah, okay,</p>
<p>this is something everybody goes through.</p>
<p>So taking that minuscule version of,</p>
<p>okay, how tiny we are and how short time it is and so on,</p>
<p>to connect to the deeper truth beyond us,</p>
<p>the reality beyond us,</p>
<p>is what sense of, quote unquote, immortality I would get.</p>
<p>Namely, at least I can hang on</p>
<p>to this little piece of truth,</p>
<p>even though I know, I know it&rsquo;s not complete.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s going to be imperfect.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s going to change and it&rsquo;s going to be improved.</p>
<p>But having a little bit deeper insight</p>
<p>than just the naive thing around us,</p>
<p>little earth here and little galaxy and so on,</p>
<p>makes me feel a little bit more pleasure to live this life.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the way I view my role as a scientist.</p>
<p>Yeah, the scarcity of this life helps us appreciate</p>
<p>the beauty of the immortal,</p>
<p>the universal truths of that physics present us.</p>
<p>And maybe one day physics will have something to say</p>
<p>about that beauty in itself,</p>
<p>explaining why the heck it&rsquo;s so beautiful</p>
<p>to appreciate the laws of physics,</p>
<p>and yet why it&rsquo;s so tragic that we would die so quickly.</p>
<p>Yes, we die so quickly.</p>
<p>So that can be a bit longer, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>It would be very nice.</p>
<p>Maybe physics will help out.</p>
<p>Well, Kamran, it was an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you so much once again</p>
<p>for painting a beautiful picture of the history of physics.</p>
<p>And it kind of presents a hopeful view</p>
<p>of the future of physics.</p>
<p>So I really, really appreciate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would talk to me</p>
<p>and waste all your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lex.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure, and I loved talking with you.</p>
<p>And this is wonderful set of discussions.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed my time with this discussion.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Kamran Vafa.</p>
<p>And thank you to Headspace, Jordan Harmerjee Show,</p>
<p>Squarespace, and Allform.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from the great Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Physics isn&rsquo;t the most important thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Love is.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
