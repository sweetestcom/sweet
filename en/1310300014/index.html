<p>Hi, Lindsay, how are you?</p>
<p>Awesome, Michelle.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s everything going in your world?</p>
<p>Everything is good.</p>
<p>Everything is good.</p>
<p>You know, recently, I mean, a couple months back, we had the midterm elections in the</p>
<p>U.S. and there were there were a lot of really close races, like some that were too close</p>
<p>to call at first, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was actually traveling in Argentina when this was happening for better or for</p>
<p>worse.</p>
<p>I guess maybe that was better to be out of the country.</p>
<p>But I remember checking the news and thinking, oh, looks like this person lost, but they</p>
<p>actually won.</p>
<p>And I was kind of bummed, but yeah, I was very close.</p>
<p>Neck and neck.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Neck and neck.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I feel like that.</p>
<p>Like when you hear too close to call, isn&rsquo;t that what you always hear on the news on election</p>
<p>night?</p>
<p>Like they go like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the start of the night.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like I remember I saw I think it was on NBC and it was like, and this race</p>
<p>is too close to call.</p>
<p>And this race is too close to call.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know, with five percent of the vote, all right, what are we even doing</p>
<p>here?</p>
<p>You know, they go for it.</p>
<p>You know, they line up all the advertisers that night or they know people are sitting</p>
<p>down to watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the same kind of announcers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that young guy from very strong, I think, Brooklyn accent, you know, that guy with the</p>
<p>dark hair.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like very sounds very Brooklyn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so funny.</p>
<p>And every year he&rsquo;s right there reporting for us.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably like in his 30s.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And which and which channel?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s CNN.</p>
<p>Oh, and I can&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Anyways, it&rsquo;s always the same people like you have that career that just analyze election</p>
<p>results.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like three of them on.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s John King.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on CNN.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Harry and 10.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re talking about Harry and 10.</p>
<p>I think it might be Harry.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Harry.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think at least for sure in the past several years, a lot of races have been too</p>
<p>close to call.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not often just like a big oh, one person.</p>
<p>It was so easy to tell that, you know, but some some are predict predictable, but sometimes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And speaking of races and competitions, I&rsquo;m really impressed to see the US.</p>
<p>I think they won their game against in the World Cup.</p>
<p>Who do they beat?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really a soccer fan, but I know it&rsquo;s a big deal that they made it to where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, that sounds right.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing well this year.</p>
<p>Pretty impressive.</p>
<p>I yeah, I, I have to confess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not watch.</p>
<p>No, not watch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never really been a big soccer country compared to other countries in the right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not even sure if that answer was correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s shameful.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So close soccer matches, close political races.</p>
<p>This is what we&rsquo;re getting into today.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re going to talk about some vocabulary today, some expressions that you can use when</p>
<p>races are really close.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s funny that we call a race like races.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not always just like an actual race, like running a race, you know, like that is</p>
<p>race.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sometimes we use race to talk about like an election to write.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of strange that we do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And where let&rsquo;s talk about connection here.</p>
<p>When and where can we why is this a good connection skill for our listeners?</p>
<p>What did you say?</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I actually remember you were talking about being out of the country.</p>
<p>I was out of the country when Obama won his first really.</p>
<p>You were in London.</p>
<p>I was in London.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I was in a bar like in an election watch party, OK, with some of my roommates and then</p>
<p>a lot of people I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And this is and I also remember where I was when Trump won.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I was.</p>
<p>And it is like when you&rsquo;re especially watching something, you know, maybe at a bar or anywhere,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re watching with like a lot of people.</p>
<p>You want to have that connection like you.</p>
<p>This is the way to kind of like start mingling with people, start talking when you&rsquo;re out</p>
<p>in an event.</p>
<p>Sometimes they have watch parties for sport games, elections, whatever it is, 100 percent.</p>
<p>And I think relationships are formed over sometimes intense experiences and nothing&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more intense than if you really believe in a political candidate or especially World</p>
<p>Cup, I guess, because the whole world loves soccer or other sporting sport matches.</p>
<p>You know, you can form intense bonds over these words or having something to say in</p>
<p>these moments, guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go over some of these these expressions today.</p>
<p>So the first one is this too close to call.</p>
<p>So, I mean, what do we mean by that?</p>
<p>Too close.</p>
<p>What do we what does it mean by call?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So when we say call, we mean decide or determine or announce a winner.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, yeah, you can&rsquo;t say who won yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s before the results are in, before the match is over.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often used with elections, as we said.</p>
<p>So, for example, Pennsylvania is too close to call, but we should have more votes coming</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in elections, there are always certain states that are too close to call.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always predictable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, sometimes these purple states.</p>
<p>And Colorado is actually technically a purple state, too.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s leaning more blue now.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>I just watched your governor on a TV show.</p>
<p>Oh, Governor Polis.</p>
<p>People love him.</p>
<p>They love him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He seems great.</p>
<p>They were saying he could end up running for president.</p>
<p>I think he should, because what I like about him, we won&rsquo;t get too much into politics here,</p>
<p>but what I like about him is that he used to be a businessman.</p>
<p>He was an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>He founded, I think, ProFlowers or Flowers.com or something like that.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t realize that.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s business-minded, which I think is important.</p>
<p>People that know the economy understand small business, but he&rsquo;s also tolerant socially.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Because you said about Trump at first, it sounded like you were describing Trump.</p>
<p>Oh, God, no, no, no.</p>
<p>The tolerant socially part was the-</p>
<p>But Trump just inherited a bunch of money and reinvested it into hotel.</p>
<p>I mean, no, that&rsquo;s not business skill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another kind of business, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about small business, like the grind.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Small business is huge.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>So the next thing you can say is neck and neck, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is to say something is very close.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it always sounds like neck and neck, but I think it&rsquo;s actually neck and neck.</p>
<p>But whatever it is, it&rsquo;s just neck and neck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Neck and neck.</p>
<p>Neck and neck.</p>
<p>The runners were neck and neck until one tripped over a tree branch.</p>
<p>Ooh, bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or they are both such talented singers.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be neck and neck.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>We just did the turkey trot-</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>With my family here in Denver-</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Right before Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
<p>And that was fun.</p>
<p>We were all kind of neck and neck until the end, and then we just sprint and see who wins,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Michelle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next expression?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, the next one we want to talk about is by a something.</p>
<p>So, we have by a hair and by a nose.</p>
<p>Oh, by a nose.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s new for me.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing as by a hair.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard it before, but I feel like I hear by a hair more frequently.</p>
<p>But think about it.</p>
<p>So, Lindsay, what is by a hair?</p>
<p>By a hair.</p>
<p>Just imagine how thick a hair, how thin one hair is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the margin, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the margin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference between this person and this person, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s an example?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>In the Kentucky Derby, the winner really won by a hair.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, that means it was just so&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, you think of the Kentucky Derby as a horse race, and you think of, like, literally,</p>
<p>you know, like&hellip;</p>
<p>You guys are on video.</p>
<p>You can see.</p>
<p>You know, by a hair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like by a teensy, teensy bit.</p>
<p>A tiny hair.</p>
<p>A tiny hair.</p>
<p>It was so close.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The NASCAR race was so close, but he won by a nose.</p>
<p>I know some people think he didn&rsquo;t win at all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking for a truly cultural experience, go to the Kentucky Derby, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so Tennessee.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in Kentucky, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>What am I thinking?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so Southern.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so&hellip;</p>
<p>They wear these big hats.</p>
<p>Hats.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what everyone thinks about.</p>
<p>Is it mint julep that they drink?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very clear tradition.</p>
<p>The Kentucky Derby is filled with tradition.</p>
<p>So if you have a chance to go, I would go if I had a chance to go for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>An experience for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What else, Michelle?</p>
<p>So the next one is down to the wire.</p>
<p>So this one can be used in a couple different ways, but we&rsquo;re just going to focus on one.</p>
<p>So for example, the race is really down to the wire.</p>
<p>We just have to see what happens.</p>
<p>So what is that?</p>
<p>How can you explain that one?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I would say it&rsquo;s, well, it&rsquo;s getting to the end, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what I think of.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably implying that it&rsquo;s close as well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Down to the wire.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to do one more, which is tight or close.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most straightforward one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most straightforward one.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how to describe a competition that is, you know, we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen.</p>
<p>So you could say it&rsquo;s going to be tight, but Vicky should pull it out in the end.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s such a tight race, but it looks like Paul will be the winner.</p>
<p>So guys, that would be the one to start with, you know, if you want to keep it simple and</p>
<p>start commenting on these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>And then you could say, oh, yeah, it&rsquo;s a real tight race, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>And then we can add in the idioms after that, right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>Fresh for everyone.</p>
<p>OK, so, Michelle, do we have any quick conversation we want to do here about this?</p>
<p>Yeah, we do.</p>
<p>I want to hear.</p>
<p>I want to hear from you.</p>
<p>Are you competitive?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably not the most competitive person.</p>
<p>I know people who are way more competitive.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>Especially, especially in things like sports, things like that, because this is not my strong</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>I am not athletic.</p>
<p>I will never win a running race.</p>
<p>And like those things I&rsquo;m OK with, with like theater and singing, I think I used to be</p>
<p>a little bit more competitive.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m just a little bit more relaxed.</p>
<p>But with like with sports, I mean, I&rsquo;m the type of person, if it&rsquo;s fun, I want to do</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like I. Yeah.</p>
<p>With bowling.</p>
<p>I am the world&rsquo;s worst bowler.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, you&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>I actually love to go bowling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But like, I don&rsquo;t have to be good at something to find ways to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So I can just enjoy the experience and kind of laugh at myself and whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing, Michelle.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I guess in some ways I could be competitive.</p>
<p>You know, where it really counts to me.</p>
<p>It depends how important it is.</p>
<p>I think in the sports or the events that we&rsquo;re better at, we tend to obviously be more competitive</p>
<p>because we want to play at a higher level and we want to test out our skills and see</p>
<p>how good we actually are.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, do you think that the world like society or culture is more competitive lately or less?</p>
<p>Or do you think we can really say, hmm, is it more competitive?</p>
<p>So I guess it would have to depend on the sector.</p>
<p>Like are we talking about business?</p>
<p>Are we talking about sports?</p>
<p>Um, I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know if I can really answer that.</p>
<p>It depends on where we&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, I think, yeah, in some ways, yes.</p>
<p>And in some ways, no.</p>
<p>Like I do think the global health crisis kind of maybe changed some things that may be making</p>
<p>some things less competitive.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, the, in some ways, like the work environment of, you know, some people started like leaving</p>
<p>the workforce or wanting to work less or, um, we talked about that recently.</p>
<p>Um, so in some ways I think people maybe, um, found different priorities.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve talked about that on the show recently when we talked about the quiet quitting thing</p>
<p>and approaching that from different angles for sure.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So in that sense, a little bit less, but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s many other ways in which we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more competitive.</p>
<p>I think in politics, we&rsquo;re probably even more so like it&rsquo;s getting more competitive and</p>
<p>not in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Not in a healthy way.</p>
<p>I think politics has become more like identity politics where we&rsquo;re in like the seventies</p>
<p>or the eighties.</p>
<p>People could probably talk about these issues and leave their identity behind and just actually</p>
<p>debate the issue itself.</p>
<p>But now it&rsquo;s like we all get it.</p>
<p>The issues intertwined with who we are and there&rsquo;s just no coming to a consensus there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s become more competitive for sure.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>Interesting how these things evolve over time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So should we do a role play?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>So here we are watching a race.</p>
<p>Hopefully the Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say it is.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s the Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Who do you think won?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s still too close to call.</p>
<p>I mean, we have a minute left actually.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>This is a tight race.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really neck and neck.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re down to the wire.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Stacey won.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That was really by a hair.</p>
<p>So Stacey must be our jockey.</p>
<p>Or the horse.</p>
<p>Or the horse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The horse&rsquo;s name could be Stacey, I guess.</p>
<p>I guess I wasn&rsquo;t writing this with the Kentucky Derby in mind, but guys, you get the point.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>So you said&hellip;</p>
<p>I said it&rsquo;s too close to call, right?</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too&hellip;</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too close to call commentary.</p>
<p>And then we say, oh, right.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>This is a tight race.</p>
<p>Tight race.</p>
<p>Some of the basic ones, you can just say it&rsquo;s a close race.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tight race.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Start with those if you feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I said, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really neck and neck.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>And then I said, yeah, we&rsquo;re down to the wire, right?</p>
<p>And then you said that was really by a hair.</p>
<p>So somebody won, but it was so close it was almost impossible to tell.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking this could be really useful because a lot of times when you get to the higher</p>
<p>levels of business, like our listeners are getting to, you might be invited by your boss</p>
<p>or by your clients.</p>
<p>You might invite your clients to come and use your company seats at a basketball game</p>
<p>or at a baseball game.</p>
<p>Often large companies will buy a box, right?</p>
<p>And then they will have that for their clients or suppliers, whatever.</p>
<p>And you need to have conversations.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s imagine maybe you don&rsquo;t actually care about what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>You still need to say something and you can say you can get away with not having insight</p>
<p>on the team or the sport by saying things like this.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I do know what you mean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just throw some things out there.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not quite sure or you don&rsquo;t really care, just say it.</p>
<p>Just build those connections.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Someone else might be saying, oh, this player, that player, oh, he should have missed that</p>
<p>layup.</p>
<p>He made a hundred of those last season.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say that because you don&rsquo;t know the sport, but you can say these things.</p>
<p>Just commentary around how close it is.</p>
<p>These are universal things that you can talk about, right?</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t feel like you can&rsquo;t comment if you don&rsquo;t know all the details.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I like the idea of, you know, where does sports intersect with business and how can we get</p>
<p>in there?</p>
<p>And, you know, most of the time you&rsquo;re not necessarily watching the game.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually just talking to the people around you, your colleagues, your clients.</p>
<p>But it matters in these moments, you know, what do you say?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good stuff, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Well, wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So, guys, this is useful for talking to people about competitions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for also predicting what you think might happen.</p>
<p>So try them out and you will, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if you are into it, right, like a presidential race, remember that, like I said before, we</p>
<p>said the relationships get formed in those intense moments.</p>
<p>So it could be a moment to really make a build a bond with someone and make it closer to</p>
<p>that connection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really important point, Lindsay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ll leave it there.</p>
