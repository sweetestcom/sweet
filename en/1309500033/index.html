<p>and let&rsquo;s get into it because this one is</p>
<p>juicy today&rsquo;s story is very interesting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I mean it&rsquo;s got everything</p>
<p>love sex money incest</p>
<p>yeah I said it</p>
<p>I mean a lot of incest going on</p>
<p>last week we had some incest</p>
<p>this week we&rsquo;ve got it</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m on some kind of role here</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t mean to sign up for my bad</p>
<p>so the story I have for you</p>
<p>today is kind of like a car accident</p>
<p>you know like you wanna look away</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so instead you just kind of break the car a little bit</p>
<p>and then like it causes a bunch of traffic behind you</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re late to work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s dive into the compelling story of Candice</p>
<p>who also went by the name Candy Mossler</p>
<p>doo doo doo</p>
<p>doo doo doo doo</p>
<p>candy Mossler</p>
<p>was described by nearly everyone who knew her</p>
<p>as a glamorous platinum blonde Barbie</p>
<p>who kept her real age a secret</p>
<p>she was a socialite by nature</p>
<p>and an adoring wife by choice</p>
<p>before Kanty met her second husband</p>
<p>his name was Jaka Mosler</p>
<p>who was a multi millionaire</p>
<p>who had an intense dedication to work</p>
<p>okay he yes</p>
<p>love to work</p>
<p>from a young age</p>
<p>Jaka Mosler was determined to provide for himself</p>
<p>and his future family</p>
<p>as his widowed mother</p>
<p>had managed to do for him as a child</p>
<p>Mosler owned a chain of banks and finance companies</p>
<p>from Florida to Texas</p>
<p>and as a result</p>
<p>he was rich</p>
<p>rich like he was rich rich</p>
<p>so Jacca was married beforehand</p>
<p>and in his first marriage</p>
<p>he fathered 4 children</p>
<p>who were set to be the apple of his eye</p>
<p>and for the first time in his life</p>
<p>work had come second</p>
<p>and his new family was first</p>
<p>in his life</p>
<p>Jack was a man</p>
<p>that many described as being an individual</p>
<p>who simply loved helping children</p>
<p>because he was raised by a single mother</p>
<p>who made sure to try her best</p>
<p>to provide for her children</p>
<p>Jack felt like he needed to</p>
<p>or wanted to do that</p>
<p>the same for other kids</p>
<p>which is like</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s so sweet you know</p>
<p>so when his first marriage fizzled out</p>
<p>for whichever reason it did</p>
<p>Jack filed for divorce</p>
<p>and his life changed directions</p>
<p>it was then that Jack met the also recently divorced</p>
<p>socialite Candy</p>
<p>funny how they always show up</p>
<p>right when you go through a divorce</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>Candy never revealed her real age to almost anyone</p>
<p>very old school</p>
<p>but it was well known</p>
<p>that Candy was at least 20 years younger than Jack</p>
<p>and the age gap really didn&rsquo;t mean anything to them</p>
<p>because they fell in love</p>
<p>and by 1949</p>
<p>Jack proposed to Candy</p>
<p>and the 2 were married</p>
<p>by springtime</p>
<p>the relationship was you know</p>
<p>it was the beginning</p>
<p>of what looked like a perfect love story</p>
<p>candy and Jack</p>
<p>moved into a 28 bedroom mansion in Houston together</p>
<p>where a lavish lifestyle</p>
<p>became the new normal for Candy</p>
<p>28 bedrooms</p>
<p>I would love to know what goes in those rooms</p>
<p>because what the hell do you need 28 bedrooms for</p>
<p>like I can understand 4</p>
<p>5 bedrooms okay</p>
<p>but what are you doing with the rest of those rooms</p>
<p>let me know down below</p>
<p>candy&rsquo;s just loving it</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>I hit the jackpot Candy</p>
<p>she always had a love for the finer things in life</p>
<p>okay and after marrying Jack</p>
<p>she was set to enjoy her new lifestyle</p>
<p>permanently</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not going anywhere</p>
<p>the couple often</p>
<p>spent their days traveling between their Houston home</p>
<p>and their posh vacation apartment</p>
<p>in Key Biscayne Florida</p>
<p>nearly 8 years into their marriage</p>
<p>Candy and Jack</p>
<p>Jack was watching the news one day</p>
<p>and he heard</p>
<p>about a man who had some kind of like</p>
<p>manic episode</p>
<p>and he ended up killing a pregnant</p>
<p>his pregnant wife</p>
<p>and her unborn child</p>
<p>in a fate of rage</p>
<p>so Jack is watching the news</p>
<p>and he hears the story</p>
<p>the man who had done this</p>
<p>his name was</p>
<p>Leonard Glenn</p>
<p>and he had a history of mental illness</p>
<p>according to officials</p>
<p>after shooting his wife</p>
<p>and stabbing his infant child</p>
<p>Glenn packed his other 4 kids into a car</p>
<p>that he crashed into the snowy banks</p>
<p>near his house</p>
<p>police intercepted</p>
<p>and brought Glenn into custody</p>
<p>immediately</p>
<p>which then left his 4 children orphaned</p>
<p>so Jack is watching the news</p>
<p>he hears the story</p>
<p>and he hears</p>
<p>about the 4 children</p>
<p>who are now orphaned</p>
<p>and his first reaction</p>
<p>was that he wanted to help</p>
<p>so Jack at this time</p>
<p>was worth over 33 million dollars</p>
<p>and he felt like okay</p>
<p>like I have more than enough money</p>
<p>and 28 rooms</p>
<p>I could definitely take on</p>
<p>extra children in my life</p>
<p>so together</p>
<p>Jack and Candy</p>
<p>decided to adopt</p>
<p>these 4 children</p>
<p>that were now orphaned</p>
<p>amazing beautiful</p>
<p>great story</p>
<p>the end I wish right</p>
<p>in the 4 years</p>
<p>following the initial adoption</p>
<p>of the Glen children</p>
<p>the life that Candy</p>
<p>and Jack had built</p>
<p>for themselves</p>
<p>was pretty pleasant</p>
<p>in fact the Mosler family was</p>
<p>seen as the</p>
<p>epitome of success</p>
<p>both in terms of money</p>
<p>and family values</p>
<p>they were just a</p>
<p>great role model</p>
<p>of course that is</p>
<p>until candy&rsquo;s nephew</p>
<p>his name was Melvin Powers</p>
<p>entered their lives</p>
<p>so who is Melvin Powers</p>
<p>you ask well</p>
<p>let me tell you</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a 24 year old</p>
<p>American businessman</p>
<p>who was originally from Birmingham</p>
<p>Alabama before</p>
<p>diving into the world of</p>
<p>Melvin was in the United States Navy</p>
<p>for a few years</p>
<p>after his time</p>
<p>at the Navy</p>
<p>he worked at a variety</p>
<p>of oddball jobs</p>
<p>that ended with him</p>
<p>receiving a conviction</p>
<p>for a con job</p>
<p>in Michigan</p>
<p>it based off what</p>
<p>I was reading</p>
<p>it kind of seemed like Melvin</p>
<p>was always looking for</p>
<p>the easy way out</p>
<p>whether it be</p>
<p>lying to get money</p>
<p>or just lying</p>
<p>to benefit himself</p>
<p>in some kind of way</p>
<p>you get what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>so the con job</p>
<p>that he was doing</p>
<p>in Michigan</p>
<p>this conviction</p>
<p>resulted in Melvin</p>
<p>receiving a sentence</p>
<p>to serve 90 days in jail</p>
<p>which he did</p>
<p>and when he was out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he was on probation</p>
<p>for his offences</p>
<p>decided he decided</p>
<p>to move to Houston</p>
<p>and the reason being is</p>
<p>because his mother</p>
<p>recommended</p>
<p>that Melvin</p>
<p>get in touch</p>
<p>with her sister Candy</p>
<p>aka his aunt</p>
<p>as she lived in Houston</p>
<p>with her business owning</p>
<p>very wealthy husband</p>
<p>so like hey</p>
<p>maybe you should get in</p>
<p>touch with my sister</p>
<p>who can maybe</p>
<p>help you out</p>
<p>so melvins thinking wow mom</p>
<p>thanks for the tip</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great idea</p>
<p>and he reaches out to</p>
<p>Candy his aunt</p>
<p>in hopes that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe her husband</p>
<p>could offer him a job</p>
<p>offer him something</p>
<p>you know to hopefully</p>
<p>get him into business</p>
<p>and start making money</p>
<p>what transpired</p>
<p>between Melvin</p>
<p>and Candy was</p>
<p>definitely different</p>
<p>than they had intended</p>
<p>the relationship</p>
<p>as aunt and nephew</p>
<p>was strange</p>
<p>from the first time</p>
<p>that they met in Houston</p>
<p>it was said</p>
<p>at this time</p>
<p>Melvin was nearly 21 years</p>
<p>younger than Candy</p>
<p>and was literally</p>
<p>her nephew by blood</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t stop the 2</p>
<p>from experiencing some</p>
<p>sexual tension</p>
<p>yeah weird yeah</p>
<p>sexual tension</p>
<p>it was happening</p>
<p>oh yes oh yes</p>
<p>now I mean we could all say</p>
<p>well maybe you know</p>
<p>Melvin was doing this on purpose because he knew</p>
<p>like he wanted to get into candy&rsquo;s pockets</p>
<p>you know her wallet</p>
<p>or maybe he was just trying to get a leg up</p>
<p>in the business world</p>
<p>through her husband</p>
<p>or maybe Candy was feeling some kind of way like she</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe she liked having this power</p>
<p>or authority over Melvin</p>
<p>that left her hot and bothered</p>
<p>those are just opinions</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>whatever it was</p>
<p>their affair lasted for years</p>
<p>yes I said affair</p>
<p>cause they cross that line baby</p>
<p>oh they crossed it</p>
<p>you nastys so</p>
<p>Candy would later say that her affair with her nephew</p>
<p>was a direct response to having discovered that Jack</p>
<p>her husband was gay</p>
<p>oh yes oh yes</p>
<p>candy said that</p>
<p>candy said that Jack</p>
<p>was struck down by a mysterious illness</p>
<p>a mysterious illness that left him a homosexual</p>
<p>and this just shattered her</p>
<p>she had no one else to talk to</p>
<p>so instead she turned to her nephew for companionship</p>
<p>which then just led into a sexual relationship</p>
<p>when Jack was in his mid 60s</p>
<p>he started to stay at their Florida vacation apartment</p>
<p>a lot longer than he normally would</p>
<p>whether it was because he was tired of his marriage</p>
<p>or maybe he just wanted to be alone</p>
<p>while he kind of experimented</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>or just explore his sexuality more</p>
<p>but he was distancing himself from Candy</p>
<p>at least that was the perception she was getting</p>
<p>well Jack was away in Florida</p>
<p>doing whatever it was he was doing</p>
<p>it was a lot easier for Melvin and Candy to hide</p>
<p>their affair</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>because he was never around</p>
<p>okay or at least</p>
<p>Candy and Melvin thought their affair was a secret</p>
<p>and no one was ever gonna know</p>
<p>Jack had agreed to originally help Melvin</p>
<p>with his business ventures</p>
<p>when he first moved to the home in Houston</p>
<p>he gave Melvin a job</p>
<p>working as a trailer sales men</p>
<p>he owned a lot</p>
<p>Melvin worked at that lot</p>
<p>selling trailers</p>
<p>candy was the one who was in charge of mainly</p>
<p>like financing anything that Melvin needed for his job</p>
<p>so Jack even allowed Melvin to move into the couple&rsquo;s</p>
<p>multi million dollar mansion</p>
<p>and live rent free</p>
<p>not long after</p>
<p>Melvin had moved in with Candy and Jack</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s win Jack and Candy</p>
<p>not Jack and Candy</p>
<p>candy and Melvin grew a little sloppy</p>
<p>in the ways that they had hid their affair from Jack</p>
<p>it was said that Jack was not a dumbass</p>
<p>he knew something was going on</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know it was between the 2 of them</p>
<p>but he knew</p>
<p>like something was just going on</p>
<p>now when Jack did find out the truth</p>
<p>what was going on</p>
<p>between Candy and Melvin</p>
<p>he was like oh heck no</p>
<p>you nasties</p>
<p>your bloodline</p>
<p>is not royal here</p>
<p>and is nothing to protect</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all are just gross</p>
<p>authorities later</p>
<p>they reported that</p>
<p>a year after Mel moved in</p>
<p>a coworker was the one who told Jack</p>
<p>about what they saw going down</p>
<p>when Jack wasn&rsquo;t around</p>
<p>this co worker also said</p>
<p>that Melvin was kind of bragging</p>
<p>about what he was doing with Candy</p>
<p>and how he was doing it</p>
<p>all for money</p>
<p>this is what Melvin said to the co worker</p>
<p>co worker told Jack</p>
<p>Jack is already like dude gross</p>
<p>so Jack goes to do some investigating</p>
<p>for his own</p>
<p>so he goes looking for candy&rsquo;s diary</p>
<p>mm hmm he knows where she keeps it</p>
<p>so he went looking</p>
<p>grabs the diary</p>
<p>opens it up</p>
<p>what does he see</p>
<p>further information</p>
<p>he reads what Candy had written down</p>
<p>over and over again</p>
<p>multiple times</p>
<p>on different pages</p>
<p>she was going on and on</p>
<p>about how she had passionate sexual relations</p>
<p>with her nephew Melvin</p>
<p>after reading candy&rsquo;s diary</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when Jack went on</p>
<p>to just fire</p>
<p>and get rid of Melvin</p>
<p>and 2 officials</p>
<p>ordered Melvin</p>
<p>to leave the mansion</p>
<p>or face a rest</p>
<p>so Melvin is just upset here</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s saying some mean things</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s telling Jack</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna get his revenge</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>not going quietly</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to fight</p>
<p>trying to stay</p>
<p>and Melvin left</p>
<p>but when he left</p>
<p>he claimed one day</p>
<p>he would return</p>
<p>quote as the owner of this mansion end quote</p>
<p>it was said</p>
<p>that this left Jack very</p>
<p>it just sat with him</p>
<p>and it kind of like</p>
<p>put some fear within him</p>
<p>he wrote in a personal memo</p>
<p>quote if Mel and Candice</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t kill me first</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to kill them</p>
<p>end quote well</p>
<p>it was said</p>
<p>it was a personal memo</p>
<p>but I believe</p>
<p>it was a diary of his own</p>
<p>a journal of his own</p>
<p>so it was said</p>
<p>directly after this whole</p>
<p>fight went down</p>
<p>Jack had kicked Melvin out of their house</p>
<p>in this big blow up</p>
<p>Jack and Candy</p>
<p>their relationship</p>
<p>just went south</p>
<p>quickly quickly</p>
<p>neither Candy nor Jack</p>
<p>felt as though they could</p>
<p>trust each other anymore</p>
<p>neither party really respected the other enough</p>
<p>to have a healthy</p>
<p>loving relationship again</p>
<p>they both obviously</p>
<p>wanted 2 different lifestyles in turn</p>
<p>they formally separated</p>
<p>later that year</p>
<p>even though the couple separated</p>
<p>Jack was still providing</p>
<p>Candy with a $5,000 weekly allowance</p>
<p>to keep her wealthy lifestyle</p>
<p>this would be nearly</p>
<p>$45,000 today</p>
<p>will equal to $45,000 today</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s still giving her an allowance</p>
<p>to make her happy</p>
<p>pretty much okay</p>
<p>despite the fact that the 2</p>
<p>obviously wanted</p>
<p>legal separation</p>
<p>from each other</p>
<p>neither of them</p>
<p>wanted to be the first</p>
<p>to file for divorce</p>
<p>firstly their relationship</p>
<p>was heavily public</p>
<p>as their social status</p>
<p>made them increasingly</p>
<p>more popular</p>
<p>as the years went on</p>
<p>the nature of</p>
<p>Jack being gay</p>
<p>is something that</p>
<p>would be considered normal today</p>
<p>but this was the 19 sixties</p>
<p>so he feared that</p>
<p>outing himself</p>
<p>or Candy outing him</p>
<p>would result</p>
<p>in people losing respect for him</p>
<p>and overall</p>
<p>just losing everything</p>
<p>so in a way</p>
<p>Jack was like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really want to</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to stir the pot</p>
<p>in a way cause</p>
<p>Candy kind of</p>
<p>she could say something</p>
<p>and it would really</p>
<p>it could ruin his life</p>
<p>candy on the other hand</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t want the public to know</p>
<p>that she had been</p>
<p>cheating on her husband</p>
<p>and not just</p>
<p>cheating on her husband</p>
<p>with her own nephew</p>
<p>because yeah</p>
<p>I mean that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna be well received</p>
<p>so candy&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to start the divorce</p>
<p>because Jack</p>
<p>could say that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having</p>
<p>sex with a nephew</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna ruin my life</p>
<p>so both are</p>
<p>kinda like you</p>
<p>say something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say something</p>
<p>you know on top of</p>
<p>just the general perception</p>
<p>reasons the 2</p>
<p>were worth a lot of</p>
<p>money together</p>
<p>if Jack decide</p>
<p>to file for divorce</p>
<p>he would have to</p>
<p>split all of his wealth</p>
<p>with her her</p>
<p>their prenuptial agreement</p>
<p>their prenup</p>
<p>if Candy decided</p>
<p>to file first</p>
<p>she would only receive 200 000</p>
<p>which was not worth it</p>
<p>in her eyes</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>only one Birkin bag</p>
<p>how dare he</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>a lot of us</p>
<p>would be like</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>the 200,000</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>the only way</p>
<p>for Candy and Melvin</p>
<p>to receive all</p>
<p>33,000,000 of</p>
<p>Jackson at Worth</p>
<p>was if Jack</p>
<p>wound up dead</p>
<p>on June 29th 1964</p>
<p>Canny decide</p>
<p>to take her 4</p>
<p>adopted children</p>
<p>to see their father</p>
<p>at his Florida apartment</p>
<p>and this is where</p>
<p>Jack was living</p>
<p>pretty much full time</p>
<p>after their separation</p>
<p>at the Florida</p>
<p>vacation home</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s living there</p>
<p>full time now</p>
<p>so she takes</p>
<p>the kids over there</p>
<p>to go to visit we guess</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>they only stayed</p>
<p>for a little bit</p>
<p>at jack&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>just for a few hours</p>
<p>and during that time</p>
<p>Candy complained</p>
<p>that her head</p>
<p>was just pounding</p>
<p>she had a migraine</p>
<p>throughout candy&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>it was said</p>
<p>that she suffered</p>
<p>from migraines</p>
<p>that were often</p>
<p>debilitating</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>excuse that</p>
<p>her head was hurting</p>
<p>it sounded about right</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t something</p>
<p>that was weird</p>
<p>so after a couple hours</p>
<p>it was said that</p>
<p>Kanye was just</p>
<p>tired of being in pain</p>
<p>so she decided</p>
<p>to take the 4</p>
<p>children into her car</p>
<p>and they drove off</p>
<p>to a nearby</p>
<p>emergency room</p>
<p>in hopes that</p>
<p>the medical</p>
<p>staff could help</p>
<p>alleviate her migraine</p>
<p>just moments</p>
<p>after Candy left</p>
<p>jack&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>an intruder</p>
<p>broke in through</p>
<p>the front door</p>
<p>he just walked in</p>
<p>I guess but</p>
<p>there was some</p>
<p>kind of scuffle</p>
<p>that had taken</p>
<p>place between</p>
<p>the intruder</p>
<p>and Jack sadly</p>
<p>the intruder</p>
<p>brutally stabbed</p>
<p>Jack in the</p>
<p>chest and the</p>
<p>repeatedly around</p>
<p>39 times in total</p>
<p>the intruder</p>
<p>frustrated with Jack</p>
<p>for not dying</p>
<p>quick enough</p>
<p>I guess they</p>
<p>took something</p>
<p>heavy to then</p>
<p>smash over Jack</p>
<p>jack&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>which killed him</p>
<p>instantly when</p>
<p>Candy and her children</p>
<p>returned to</p>
<p>jack&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>around 4 in</p>
<p>the morning</p>
<p>which is like</p>
<p>what are you doing</p>
<p>well whatever</p>
<p>so at 4 in the morning</p>
<p>they come back to the home</p>
<p>and they find Jack</p>
<p>who is just wrapped up in a blood soaked blanket</p>
<p>and is just dead</p>
<p>Candy called the police immediately</p>
<p>upon discovering her husband&rsquo;s remains</p>
<p>and when local law enforcement</p>
<p>arrived at the scene of the crime</p>
<p>they knew immediately</p>
<p>that jack&rsquo;s murder was a crime of passion</p>
<p>and they knew this</p>
<p>because of how many stab wounds there were</p>
<p>I mean it was screaming hey</p>
<p>this is personal</p>
<p>and I should have gone into a little bit deeper</p>
<p>explanation</p>
<p>I guess about how they knew that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very fascinating</p>
<p>they could tell if it&rsquo;s investigators going on</p>
<p>they can tell if it&rsquo;s somebody who knew the victim</p>
<p>just based off of how the attack went down</p>
<p>which I find fascinating</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing my voice</p>
<p>what is going on</p>
<p>not the point though</p>
<p>but they knew it was a crime of passion</p>
<p>so investigators quickly began interviewing</p>
<p>or asking questions from the neighbors</p>
<p>and some of the neighbors had remarked that they heard</p>
<p>like a panicked shouting happening</p>
<p>and various thuds happening</p>
<p>in the direction of jack&rsquo;s unit</p>
<p>sorry about that little guy</p>
<p>one neighbor said that they saw like</p>
<p>a dark haired man in dark clothing fleeing the premises</p>
<p>almost immediately after the commotion had stopped</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t get a good look at who it was</p>
<p>so Candy Candy</p>
<p>on the other hand</p>
<p>informed investigators of Jack</p>
<p>his tendencies to take home strange men</p>
<p>and suggested that you know</p>
<p>maybe this could have been an act of a jealous lover</p>
<p>so police of course</p>
<p>took this into consideration</p>
<p>and tried to track down any men</p>
<p>who had personal relationships with Jack</p>
<p>but at some point</p>
<p>early on in the investigation</p>
<p>law enforcement located jack&rsquo;s personal diary</p>
<p>yes inside this diary</p>
<p>they came across pages upon pages of just</p>
<p>weird and eerie comments concerning Candy and Melvin</p>
<p>so in this diary</p>
<p>investigators could tell that Jack was genuinely</p>
<p>afraid of his wife</p>
<p>and her lover</p>
<p>incestuous lover</p>
<p>I must say that they might kill him for his money</p>
<p>this is what he&rsquo;s writing in his diary mm hmm</p>
<p>so this alone was enough for investigators to start to</p>
<p>focus their investigation on Melvin and Candy</p>
<p>a little bit more</p>
<p>so back at jack&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>investigators hold on</p>
<p>so back at jack&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>investigators found bloody fingerprints</p>
<p>on jack&rsquo;s countertops</p>
<p>they run these bloody fingerprints</p>
<p>through you know</p>
<p>their system</p>
<p>and voila baby</p>
<p>matched Melvin</p>
<p>one of jack&rsquo;s cars was stolen</p>
<p>one of them</p>
<p>you know it was the one that Candy usually drove around</p>
<p>anyhow so they find jack&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>near a local airport</p>
<p>it was reported stolen</p>
<p>so when they find it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>okay here it is</p>
<p>so let I&rsquo;m sure it was more than that</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m making this more confusing</p>
<p>stolen car it was jack&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>now it was found</p>
<p>near a local airport</p>
<p>and was searched</p>
<p>and of course</p>
<p>like inside</p>
<p>they find a bloody fingerprint</p>
<p>they ran it through the system</p>
<p>Melvin it was linked to Melvin</p>
<p>again Melvin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a little sloppy</p>
<p>as it turned out</p>
<p>Melvin had been seen in Miami</p>
<p>over the same few days that jack&rsquo;s murder took place</p>
<p>it only took a few days</p>
<p>for police to locate and arrest Melvin</p>
<p>for the murder of Jack</p>
<p>when word got back to Candy</p>
<p>about melvin&rsquo;s arrest</p>
<p>she hired the top defense attorney to represent Melvin</p>
<p>I mean the best of the best</p>
<p>but police wholeheartedly believe that</p>
<p>Melvin did not act alone</p>
<p>they believed that Melvin was working closely with</p>
<p>Candy Mossler</p>
<p>to murder Jack Mossler</p>
<p>for his money</p>
<p>shortly after Melvins arrest</p>
<p>Candy was then taken into custody</p>
<p>for her assumed association</p>
<p>in her husband&rsquo;s murder as well</p>
<p>candy knew she wouldn&rsquo;t do well</p>
<p>behind bars</p>
<p>locked up no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna work for me</p>
<p>so she hired a team of lawyers</p>
<p>to make sure she never served a day in jail</p>
<p>now for over a year</p>
<p>after the murders</p>
<p>both Candy and Melvin were free on bond</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me started</p>
<p>at the parish trial</p>
<p>Candy and Melvin consistently asserted their innocence</p>
<p>the prosecution team presented a case</p>
<p>showing Melvin and Candy wanted Jack dead</p>
<p>so they could be together and inherit his millions</p>
<p>it was estimated that jack&rsquo;s estate was</p>
<p>worth over 200 million in gross value</p>
<p>and 22 million in net value</p>
<p>over 16 billion gross</p>
<p>and over 177 million in net value today</p>
<p>so a lot of money</p>
<p>okay like a lot of money</p>
<p>if you had 177 million</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be good for the rest of your life</p>
<p>the prosecution backed up their claim of an affair</p>
<p>with photographs of Candy and Melvin</p>
<p>that they had taken together</p>
<p>the couple they seemed to travel a lot together</p>
<p>and documented their trips</p>
<p>with photos of them</p>
<p>on ski slopes</p>
<p>at concerts and in nightclubs</p>
<p>cheese like</p>
<p>taking pictures together</p>
<p>wherever they went</p>
<p>so they brought these into the courtroom</p>
<p>and they told the jury look</p>
<p>this happy couple</p>
<p>look at them</p>
<p>here is the motive</p>
<p>they wanted the money</p>
<p>they told the jury that Jack had recently</p>
<p>learned of his wife&rsquo;s affair with her nephew</p>
<p>and in response</p>
<p>Jack was planning a divorce</p>
<p>and dropping her from his will</p>
<p>now this sudden change of events</p>
<p>is what caused Melvin to fly from Houston to Miami</p>
<p>he was seen driving candy&rsquo;s white car</p>
<p>around the time of the murder</p>
<p>in the area</p>
<p>then hours before the time of death</p>
<p>Melvin was at this place called the Stuffed</p>
<p>Shirt Lounge</p>
<p>which was a lounge bar area</p>
<p>but it was right by jack&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>and he was spotted there</p>
<p>Melvin was before leaving</p>
<p>Melvin had asked the bartender for</p>
<p>an empty bottle of Coke</p>
<p>the prosecution said that he left the bar</p>
<p>and headed to jack&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>with the Coke bottle in hand</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed</p>
<p>or it was argued</p>
<p>that this was the weapon Melvin used to</p>
<p>strike Jack in the head</p>
<p>an empty Coke can</p>
<p>like the real glass</p>
<p>coke bottles</p>
<p>those are pretty hardcore</p>
<p>I think yes</p>
<p>that sounds about right</p>
<p>then the killer used a knife</p>
<p>to stab the victim 39 times</p>
<p>candy&rsquo;s part in the murder</p>
<p>was making sure that her husband was home alone</p>
<p>she had claimed to have a migraine</p>
<p>and then insisted on taking the kids</p>
<p>the 4 children with her</p>
<p>to drive around for nearly 3 hours</p>
<p>3 and 1/2 hours</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t go to the urgent care</p>
<p>like she had said she did</p>
<p>she instead would just drove around for 3 and 1/2 hours</p>
<p>they called witnesses</p>
<p>who testified that Candy had spoken to them</p>
<p>about trying to find someone to kill her husband</p>
<p>the prosecution is</p>
<p>painting a picture that all signs point to</p>
<p>Melvin and Candy</p>
<p>I mean no ifs</p>
<p>ands or buts</p>
<p>they got the motive</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got witnesses</p>
<p>who said that Candy was asking if someone could kill</p>
<p>her husband</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s clear stay right</p>
<p>the defense team came back</p>
<p>and fought that</p>
<p>the bloody fingerprints that were found in the home car</p>
<p>could have been there</p>
<p>from days before</p>
<p>for all anyone knew</p>
<p>this was before</p>
<p>DNA testing</p>
<p>so all they knew was that there was blood and like</p>
<p>bloody fingerprints and stuff</p>
<p>but not who the blood belonged to</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re trying to fight</p>
<p>like well yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s bloody fingerprints and stuff</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know how it got there</p>
<p>could have been left there</p>
<p>from a couple days before</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s wild</p>
<p>you guys it could happen</p>
<p>candy took the stand</p>
<p>testifying that</p>
<p>on many occasions</p>
<p>she and her children had come home</p>
<p>and found Jack</p>
<p>involved with a male lover</p>
<p>the defense said that</p>
<p>any one of the random men Jack picked up</p>
<p>could have killed him</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not fair to blame it on Candy</p>
<p>or Melvin to you</p>
<p>and I I feel like this is easy right well</p>
<p>the jury took over 16 hours to deliberate</p>
<p>and they returned with a verdict</p>
<p>a verdict of not Effin guilty</p>
<p>what what what</p>
<p>yep not guilty</p>
<p>they claim that they found insufficient evidence</p>
<p>to convict the couple of murder</p>
<p>despite all of the evidence</p>
<p>that were presented to the jury</p>
<p>the diaries</p>
<p>the love affair the motive</p>
<p>the witnesses not guilty</p>
<p>now the jury they acknowledge their illicit love affair</p>
<p>but noted that the affair in itself</p>
<p>did not mean that they were responsible</p>
<p>for jack&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>all of the evidence presented at trial</p>
<p>turned out to be far too circumstantial</p>
<p>for any guilty sentence</p>
<p>in sentence</p>
<p>set for any guilty sentencing</p>
<p>there we go</p>
<p>they just felt like</p>
<p>it really didn&rsquo;t prove that they indeed did it</p>
<p>the media was reporting on all of this</p>
<p>and people were losing their shit</p>
<p>because like oh</p>
<p>money an affair</p>
<p>Jack being possibly gay</p>
<p>candy having an affair with her nephew</p>
<p>when I tell you</p>
<p>people were losing their shit</p>
<p>like they were losing it</p>
<p>this story was just like insane</p>
<p>and it got to the point</p>
<p>where they had to shut the doors to the the court</p>
<p>hearing itself</p>
<p>it was just seen as too extreme</p>
<p>too sexual for people to handle</p>
<p>they would not allow anybody to</p>
<p>like come in</p>
<p>and whatnot</p>
<p>it was wild</p>
<p>heads were exploding</p>
<p>left and right</p>
<p>based off of what I was reading and like</p>
<p>hearing and stuff</p>
<p>so after her win in court</p>
<p>Candy did what she did best</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like you know what everyone</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna throw a party</p>
<p>so she threw a party</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m celebrating that the</p>
<p>that they were found not guilty</p>
<p>god her children took one of the murder trial posters</p>
<p>that had been around town</p>
<p>to the guest</p>
<p>and had them all</p>
<p>like sign it</p>
<p>as a souvenir</p>
<p>they framed it</p>
<p>yay as a result</p>
<p>Candy and Melvin walked free</p>
<p>for a murder</p>
<p>that many are positive</p>
<p>they committed</p>
<p>like Candy had hoped</p>
<p>and dreamed for</p>
<p>she inherited her husband&rsquo;s estate</p>
<p>and his banking business</p>
<p>she changed the name of the company</p>
<p>to Candace Mosler Enterprises</p>
<p>what a shitty person she is</p>
<p>wow and just a year after winning their trial</p>
<p>Candy and Melvin split</p>
<p>but she went on to inherit</p>
<p>her deceased husband&rsquo;s millions</p>
<p>and even remarried in 1971</p>
<p>to a man named Barnett</p>
<p>but so strange</p>
<p>you guys we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>she just has a wild life Barnett</p>
<p>is it Barnett</p>
<p>you see what happened was Barnett</p>
<p>he suffered brain damage</p>
<p>the next year in a mysterious fall</p>
<p>from the couple&rsquo;s mansion&rsquo;s balcony</p>
<p>and he suffered from some serious brain damage</p>
<p>and was in a coma</p>
<p>and Kenny was like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out bye</p>
<p>okay so then in 1976</p>
<p>candy&rsquo;s body was found in a Miami hotel room</p>
<p>she was dressed only in a lace robe</p>
<p>and she had on a full face of makeup</p>
<p>as she always did</p>
<p>she had overdosed at 55 years old</p>
<p>some sources say that she was 62 years old</p>
<p>another source said she was 66 years old</p>
<p>and honestly</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t verify</p>
<p>because I just felt like it was very fitting</p>
<p>how old was she</p>
<p>nobody knows</p>
<p>you never ask a lady how old she is</p>
<p>ooh Melvin and Candy again they split</p>
<p>and when he found out that Candy had died</p>
<p>he did attend candy&rsquo;s funeral</p>
<p>with his hot new little boo thing</p>
<p>and by then</p>
<p>at that point</p>
<p>he had become a flamboyant real estate developer</p>
<p>in Houston oh yeah</p>
<p>he went on to have a very successful life</p>
<p>he was said to always dress head to toe</p>
<p>and very expensive attire</p>
<p>he owned a huge luxury yacht</p>
<p>and by 1979</p>
<p>Melvin had built a fortune</p>
<p>estimated to be worth 200 million dollars</p>
<p>he also drew attention in the early 1980s</p>
<p>by adding 23 feet to his 142 foot yacht</p>
<p>which was said to be one of the largest in</p>
<p>the Western Hemisphere</p>
<p>well Melvin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really doing it</p>
<p>Melvin groundbreaking</p>
<p>Melvin was like</p>
<p>in and out of bankruptcy</p>
<p>he had filed bankruptcy a couple times</p>
<p>but then he would like</p>
<p>bounce back</p>
<p>so something sketchy was going on</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and at the age of 68</p>
<p>Melvin was found dead at his home in Houston</p>
<p>the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences</p>
<p>said that the cause of death remained undetermined</p>
<p>that my friends</p>
<p>is a story about Candy</p>
<p>and Jack Mossler</p>
<p>and candy&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>what do I even name</p>
<p>who poor Jack</p>
<p>poor poor Jack</p>
<p>he seemed like such a great guy</p>
<p>and he totally just got taken advantage of</p>
<p>by this devil woman</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>calling her a devil woman</p>
<p>what happened to the 4 adopted children</p>
<p>you ask well</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t look into it</p>
<p>because just leave him alone</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been through enough</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you know</p>
<p>what did we learn</p>
<p>here my friends</p>
<p>well if you are wealthy</p>
<p>in this country</p>
<p>you can and probably will</p>
<p>get away with murder</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it fun</p>

<p>they get under my skin so bad</p>
<p>oh if you have money to get away with anything</p>

<p>and you could say</p>
<p>well Bailey</p>
