    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Dan Gable</p>
<p>from two years ago.</p>
<p>I did not previously publish this conversation</p>
<p>as part of this podcast, but as a separate thing.</p>
<p>And as a result, it did not receive many listens.</p>
<p>Let me be honest and say that while I usually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care about how many listens or views something gets,</p>
<p>in this one case, I feel like I failed one of my heroes.</p>
<p>I feel I didn&rsquo;t properly introduce</p>
<p>a truly special human being to an audience</p>
<p>that might find him as inspiring as I did.</p>
<p>Dan Gable is one of the greatest</p>
<p>Olympic athletes of all time.</p>
<p>Bigger than records and medals, to many like myself,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a symbol of guts, spirit, mental toughness,</p>
<p>and relentless hard work.</p>
<p>As a wrestler, he was undefeated in high school,</p>
<p>undefeated in college until his very last match.</p>
<p>And having lost that match, he found another level</p>
<p>and became a world champion and an Olympic champion.</p>
<p>And most importantly, he did so</p>
<p>perfectly dominating his opponents.</p>
<p>He did not surrender a single point</p>
<p>at the 1972 Olympic games.</p>
<p>As a coach, he led the Iowa Hawkeyes to 15 national titles</p>
<p>and 25 consecutive Big Ten championships.</p>
<p>He coached 152 All Americans, 45 national champions,</p>
<p>106 Big Ten champions, and 12 Olympians,</p>
<p>including eight medalists.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of several books,</p>
<p>including A Wrestling Life One and Two,</p>
<p>and Coaching Wrestling Successfully.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that I spent a few days in Iowa</p>
<p>and got to attend a wrestling duel meet</p>
<p>in the historic Carver Hawkeye Arena.</p>
<p>Part of me wanted to stay in Iowa forever</p>
<p>to drill takedowns, to start a family, to live life simply.</p>
<p>Wrestling is one of the pure sports,</p>
<p>both beautiful and brutal,</p>
<p>where both mental toughness and technical mastery</p>
<p>of the highest form are rewarded with victory,</p>
<p>and everything else is punished with defeat.</p>
<p>And every such loss weighs heavy on the minds</p>
<p>of anyone who has ever stepped on the wrestling mat,</p>
<p>including myself.</p>
<p>The same is true for one of the greatest wrestlers</p>
<p>in history of the sport,</p>
<p>the man who graciously welcomed me into his home</p>
<p>for this conversation, the legend, Dan Gable.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Dan Gable.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re persistent, I love that,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve been trying to get me on this podcast</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>And until I saw you on another podcast</p>
<p>and you said you were Russian, did I call you back?</p>
<p>Then it was over.</p>
<p>Because Russia to me, you know,</p>
<p>is leading the world in wrestling almost every year.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between American wrestling</p>
<p>and Russian wrestling?</p>
<p>You showed me this painting.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s MIT, it&rsquo;s science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s science.</p>
<p>And they really study the sport.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really good technically.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really, really good in strategy.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really push like the real toughness.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t push like conditioning.</p>
<p>And so Americans, we need what they have.</p>
<p>Russians need what we have.</p>
<p>And when you get the two together.</p>
<p>And for me, why I could beat the Russians</p>
<p>is because I went their way a little bit.</p>
<p>But I kept my toughness.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re known, you&rsquo;re known for your toughness.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I wasn&rsquo;t known for my art.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t known for my science.</p>
<p>So when did you become a bit of an artist?</p>
<p>It took a loss.</p>
<p>The Larry Owens loss.</p>
<p>Most people thought I was already an artist</p>
<p>just because I won 181 straight matches in seven years.</p>
<p>And not just winning, but you know,</p>
<p>kind of punishing people.</p>
<p>And from that point of view,</p>
<p>yeah, I might&rsquo;ve been pretty good,</p>
<p>but I had a long ways to go yet.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t really realize that,</p>
<p>or I should say, I didn&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>how to get it out of me until I had a loss.</p>
<p>And then I realized I gotta buckle down,</p>
<p>learn some of that science, become more of an artist.</p>
<p>How do you become an artist?</p>
<p>So the Russian way has this drilling technique,</p>
<p>thousands of reps.</p>
<p>How do you think you work on the science, the art part?</p>
<p>You gotta study the best in the world.</p>
<p>I think Dave Schultz was our guy in America</p>
<p>that probably showed us that being artistic,</p>
<p>you needed that.</p>
<p>And he studied it.</p>
<p>He went over there as a high schooler</p>
<p>and rustled in some major tournaments over there.</p>
<p>And he saw their ways.</p>
<p>He used that Russian science</p>
<p>and then he was already an American</p>
<p>and he saw how I trained athletes.</p>
<p>He saw what I did in the Olympics,</p>
<p>saw what other people, how we held up,</p>
<p>and he applied that as well.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d have to say he was more the artistic type.</p>
<p>He was more of a Russian than an American</p>
<p>when it came to wrestling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve coached 45 national champions,</p>
<p>106 Big Ten champions, and eight Olympic medalists,</p>
<p>which is incredible.</p>
<p>What is a common thread between them</p>
<p>and what are maybe some of the fundamental differences?</p>
<p>I think the common thread is that</p>
<p>they all had one of those two avenues</p>
<p>that we talked already</p>
<p>and because we intertwined them.</p>
<p>So in a Russian wrestling room, they got the same people.</p>
<p>Most of the time in an American wrestling room,</p>
<p>we had the same people.</p>
<p>But when I was out recruiting,</p>
<p>at first I recruited just attitude,</p>
<p>but I needed more than that.</p>
<p>I needed some genetics in that wrestling room</p>
<p>to actually, that hard work people,</p>
<p>they could look and see, wow,</p>
<p>that execution, that&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>But yet I can beat that guy after the first minute.</p>
<p>So you think the art, the technique is genetics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re born with it.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s not something.</p>
<p>I think your pop and your ability to move.</p>
<p>Timing.</p>
<p>And timing and your quickness and your strength.</p>
<p>The Russians, they usually picked out</p>
<p>the people that can go into that sport.</p>
<p>That was the old fashioned sports school.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s mostly like when you walk into a Russian</p>
<p>wrestling room, you see them hitting skills, techniques.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see them banging against each other that much.</p>
<p>But then when practice is over,</p>
<p>you might not see a bunch of sprints.</p>
<p>You might see them walk over to the ropes</p>
<p>and they drop down from the ceiling</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll jump up and climb a rope, boom, boom, boom.</p>
<p>And then they come down and then they don&rsquo;t jump</p>
<p>right back on.</p>
<p>They have three or four other guys go</p>
<p>and then they jump back on.</p>
<p>Whereas I probably made my guys climb them,</p>
<p>get right back down, climb them right back again.</p>
<p>But I also realized that I had to have a mix of that.</p>
<p>What was the role?</p>
<p>What was your role?</p>
<p>I mean, those guys looked up and Dan Gable</p>
<p>and what was the role in helping these athletes</p>
<p>become their best?</p>
<p>These national champions.</p>
<p>Well, you had to first of all prove that you were,</p>
<p>knew what you were doing.</p>
<p>In terms of technique or in terms of hard work?</p>
<p>Everything, everything.</p>
<p>They just, you had to be the first guy there</p>
<p>and the last guy to leave</p>
<p>and you had to be the most dedicated guy,</p>
<p>even though they were the ones that&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>win the championships.</p>
<p>You had to prove that you were gonna work just as hard</p>
<p>as they were as a coach.</p>
<p>And what does that look like?</p>
<p>So you can see it when you, you know it when you see it?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re there ahead of them</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re there after they leave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m picking up after them and you&rsquo;re analyzing them.</p>
<p>You outwork them, you outwork them and you outthink them.</p>
<p>And so, you know, use that type of strategy.</p>
<p>And over time, when you prove it works,</p>
<p>because some of my kids that were the best kids</p>
<p>in the world really shouldn&rsquo;t have been a wrestler.</p>
<p>I mean, they weren&rsquo;t very coordinated,</p>
<p>but they worked so hard to develop themselves.</p>
<p>What was your role in that process?</p>
<p>I mean, that means pushing kids to their limit.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can&rsquo;t push kids to their limit.</p>
<p>And even when you push them to their limit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not their limit</p>
<p>because their limit&rsquo;s above and beyond that.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, coaches sometimes accidentally don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they lose kids because of the heat,</p>
<p>because of hard work and all that.</p>
<p>And you gotta know when to back off.</p>
<p>You gotta read your athletes.</p>
<p>And by that, I mean, you gotta know them pretty well.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, you make a little bit of a mistake,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t react right on that mistake</p>
<p>before it gets too far, then it&rsquo;s gonna be a casualty.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean somebody dying necessarily,</p>
<p>but maybe something that could turn them off</p>
<p>or maybe something that could run them away</p>
<p>or maybe something that, wow, that was close.</p>
<p>Maybe shouldn&rsquo;t have pushed them that far.</p>
<p>So you really have to be very educated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just what you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what you know about them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about the team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about each guy on the team.</p>
<p>Individuals, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, each person on the team.</p>
<p>And you know it how?</p>
<p>You see it in their eyes?</p>
<p>You know it how because you&rsquo;re the first one there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the last one to leave</p>
<p>and you set in the environment with them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re there in the morning for practice sometimes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re there in the afternoon for two or three hours.</p>
<p>After practice, you might have a hot room</p>
<p>or you might have a sauna or a steam or a whirlpool</p>
<p>and you get in there with them and you listen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just feeding out information.</p>
<p>You do that, but you&rsquo;re taking in a lot of that too.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m telling you, when you get in an atmosphere</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re relaxed and they feel comfortable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a massage.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s after practice in one of those areas</p>
<p>that people are around you, you learn a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, you got a lot to learn as a coach.</p>
<p>And when you get in that atmosphere,</p>
<p>when all of a sudden you feel like very comfortable,</p>
<p>words start flowing.</p>
<p>And when those words flow, you take them in as a coach.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something probably gonna be said</p>
<p>that you can do and act upon</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna help certain situations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve saved a couple of kids lives for sure</p>
<p>that were on the brink.</p>
<p>Sometimes performance is at such a high level</p>
<p>in a high level atmosphere</p>
<p>that life and death is actually involved.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean pushing a kid to where he just dies,</p>
<p>but I mean, he might feel himself as a failure.</p>
<p>He might go home and take his own life.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, but that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting so much heart,</p>
<p>so much blood and heart and sweat</p>
<p>and your whole meaning of life becomes winning.</p>
<p>So, and sometimes it&rsquo;s so hard to lose within that context.</p>
<p>So if in your, I think the first wrestling life</p>
<p>you wrote about Chad Zapato who lost,</p>
<p>I mean, incredible wrestler,</p>
<p>but lost in three finals in the nationals</p>
<p>and has this tattoo of a hawk clawing out the human heart.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what lessons, is there any lessons</p>
<p>from the incredible wrestling he&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>but also the incredible suffering that he went through</p>
<p>on himself?</p>
<p>Yeah, again, you like that word suffering, which is okay.</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, keep it, keep it.</p>
<p>Cause it fits right in where I want.</p>
<p>I have to turn that suffering around</p>
<p>to where he makes and feels good about himself</p>
<p>or better, doesn&rsquo;t have to feel perfect.</p>
<p>Cause he did lose, you know?</p>
<p>And so, but you have to actually get him to realize</p>
<p>that yeah, he&rsquo;s still unique</p>
<p>compared to the walk of the earth.</p>
<p>He was unbelievably unique right at the top,</p>
<p>just a little bit short of,</p>
<p>but because it was, you know, he felt the suffering,</p>
<p>you now have to go about and change that</p>
<p>and put it into goodwill some way.</p>
<p>And because he&rsquo;s, you really have a lot of goodwill,</p>
<p>you can do a lot of goodwill.</p>
<p>And so, and it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>It took him probably years, years of tattooing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Years of covering the tattoos.</p>
<p>And, you know, he told me he moved to,</p>
<p>I go, why are you moving to California?</p>
<p>Cause he was here for a couple of years</p>
<p>after his wrestling was done, cause he had a good job</p>
<p>around here and he was, I thought he was doing a good job,</p>
<p>but he just, he said, I had to escape, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the same as the covering up the tattoo.</p>
<p>I had a wrestling terminology.</p>
<p>I have to get, I hate to say this, I hate to say this.</p>
<p>I go, where are you going?</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m gonna go to California.</p>
<p>And I go, is there any reason why you&rsquo;re going to California?</p>
<p>And he says, that&rsquo;s where everybody goes to hide.</p>
<p>But I said, I think you&rsquo;re wrong there,</p>
<p>but you know, I think what will determine your life</p>
<p>will be what you do from now on, you know?</p>
<p>And if you can find, and he&rsquo;s actually turned it around.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s actually turned it around.</p>
<p>You have to discover that yourself.</p>
<p>Exactly, and he went someplace</p>
<p>that he thought he could fit into, and I think he did.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s got a good job, and he&rsquo;s helping people,</p>
<p>and he covered that tattoo with feathers, another tattoo.</p>
<p>Well, in the end, it&rsquo;s a beautiful story.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is, it really is.</p>
<p>Suffering and overcoming.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he&rsquo;s not done yet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not done yet.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s not done.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a lot more to do.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Roger Bannister,</p>
<p>again, I think in your first book,</p>
<p>and somebody you looked up to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the man who broke the four minute mile, right?</p>
<p>When everybody said it was impossible,</p>
<p>everyone thought it was impossible.</p>
<p>Oh, they thought he would die.</p>
<p>He would die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not humanly possible, yeah.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve done your homework.</p>
<p>For what, the book, or what?</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, for me, you&rsquo;ve done your homework.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, but yeah.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I was sitting here by Putin to do research, yeah.</p>
<p>So what lesson do you take from that story for yourself,</p>
<p>the impossible, trying to accomplish the impossible?</p>
<p>Well, the impossible is possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that simple.</p>
<p>Time changes things.</p>
<p>I mean, if you looked at where the mile time is right now,</p>
<p>compared to that four minute mile,</p>
<p>which when it was broke by a couple of tenths,</p>
<p>or three or four tenths,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s now broke by another 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Yeah, by several hundred people, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, by tons of people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty much common knowledge</p>
<p>that you gotta run a four minute mile</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna go somewhere now,</p>
<p>or below if you&rsquo;re gonna win events at major level,</p>
<p>that you gotta be able to do that.</p>
<p>And so you can take that,</p>
<p>and you can look at what in time history</p>
<p>has as its record performance,</p>
<p>and you can realize that that record performance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna change.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t take into all the factors of knowledge.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t take in all the factors of better shoes.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t take in all the factors</p>
<p>of better understanding of nutrition.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like me as an athlete.</p>
<p>I went to practice every day in high school</p>
<p>for at least my sophomore, and my junior,</p>
<p>and part of my senior year,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden a new rule came up.</p>
<p>It said, the rule said before that,</p>
<p>it said at least most of the coaches,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want you drinking water at practice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And okay, why?</p>
<p>Because you gotta toughen you up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weakness, water.</p>
<p>And so we would go through practice.</p>
<p>I mean, and you&rsquo;re sweating,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re sweating so much</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re almost out of sweat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re mostly at the end of practice,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not even wrestling.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re setting against the wall.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re tired.</p>
<p>So then all of a sudden they say,</p>
<p>okay, go ahead and drink water during practice,</p>
<p>drink greater aid during practice.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden at the end of practice,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still out there competing.</p>
<p>And so I look at my career for two and a half years</p>
<p>where I, and junior high too.</p>
<p>So I got another three years</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t really, wasn&rsquo;t able to push</p>
<p>as good as I could because I just was probably under.</p>
<p>Under hydrated.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, but at the individual level,</p>
<p>in terms of the impossible,</p>
<p>when did you first believe the thing</p>
<p>that maybe probably people would laugh at you about</p>
<p>was that you would be an Olympic champion?</p>
<p>Well, I always visualized me being the best.</p>
<p>You believed it in the very beginning.</p>
<p>Forever, forever.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was, because I was,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d call it a dreamer or somebody that,</p>
<p>I was just involved with competitive sports</p>
<p>at the YMCA from age five.</p>
<p>Did you tell people that dream</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna be Olympic champion one day?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be the best in the world?</p>
<p>I think they knew.</p>
<p>And the only reason why they knew,</p>
<p>cause there was something a little different</p>
<p>about this guy.</p>
<p>He was.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna stop.</p>
<p>Well, he was out in the yard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he was swinging baseball bats.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He was swinging baseball at six, at seven,</p>
<p>and eight, and nine, and 10.</p>
<p>And he was swinging baseball bats,</p>
<p>so much right handed and so much left hand</p>
<p>with nobody even there throwing the ball.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That all of a sudden when they walked by,</p>
<p>all of a sudden the grass was down to dirt</p>
<p>on both sides.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, they saw me out in the yard</p>
<p>playing by myself sports,</p>
<p>or you get the neighborhood kids and you play a lot.</p>
<p>But if they weren&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>if you walked in my front room,</p>
<p>I was hiking a ball like I was the quarterback.</p>
<p>And I was running and running through the furniture,</p>
<p>that type stuff.</p>
<p>So who saw this guy mostly was probably the parents.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the coaches at the YMCA level,</p>
<p>the junior high level,</p>
<p>they saw this guy come first and end up last.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t that great.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t the fastest guy at that time.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t the strongest guy.</p>
<p>Actually, before I went to the Olympics,</p>
<p>when they tested me, they tested everybody.</p>
<p>And I probably came back with one of the highest scores,</p>
<p>but it was not like the highest person on this</p>
<p>and this and that.</p>
<p>I was all high across the board,</p>
<p>straight across the board high on every one of them.</p>
<p>But there was always people that were higher than me.</p>
<p>Genetics.</p>
<p>But then they would go down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then they would test on something else and go back up.</p>
<p>Mine stayed high all across the board.</p>
<p>And so I really didn&rsquo;t have too many flaws,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t have any things that also said</p>
<p>that you were gonna be unscored upon at the Olympic games.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So take me through that day, if you could.</p>
<p>1972, when you were going for the 68 kilogram</p>
<p>freestyle wrestling gold,</p>
<p>you scored 57 points, if I&rsquo;m correct,</p>
<p>and had zero points scored on you.</p>
<p>57, zero.</p>
<p>So maybe take me through almost the details.</p>
<p>What was your routine?</p>
<p>What was your process?</p>
<p>What was going through your mind,</p>
<p>your thoughts of that day?</p>
<p>Yeah, first of all, it was quite a day</p>
<p>because we weighed in every day at that time.</p>
<p>In the morning?</p>
<p>Yeah, we weighed in two hours</p>
<p>before the start of the competition.</p>
<p>And so that didn&rsquo;t mean that you weighed in two hours</p>
<p>before you wrestled,</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re gonna wrestle</p>
<p>right away or later on.</p>
<p>In fact, in that day,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I wrestled until later on in the evening.</p>
<p>So had all day to recover,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t really need it anyway,</p>
<p>because I wasn&rsquo;t really pulling a whole lot of weight,</p>
<p>but it was just interesting.</p>
<p>But what was in your mind?</p>
<p>What were you thinking?</p>
<p>Were you nervous?</p>
<p>Were you?</p>
<p>I was confident.</p>
<p>You knew you were gonna win the gold.</p>
<p>Yeah, I knew I was gonna win.</p>
<p>But in reality, I didn&rsquo;t know it</p>
<p>from a cocky point of view.</p>
<p>I only knew it because for the last</p>
<p>one, two, three and a half years,</p>
<p>I had been going to practice,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d win in every practice.</p>
<p>You felt good, you won.</p>
<p>And I hardly ever lose a takedown.</p>
<p>And if I lost, if somebody scored on me,</p>
<p>it was like when I went to bed,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t sleep until I figured it out.</p>
<p>Or if I didn&rsquo;t figure it out,</p>
<p>I would fall asleep and I would wake up</p>
<p>with the answer of what I needed,</p>
<p>why I got scored upon.</p>
<p>So maybe now that you&rsquo;ve won the gold,</p>
<p>can you tell me in the practice room</p>
<p>when somebody took you down,</p>
<p>how do you take Dan Gable down in the practice room?</p>
<p>Timing, technique?</p>
<p>Very difficult, but somebody could,</p>
<p>because they were going for one move.</p>
<p>All I wanted was one move.</p>
<p>Whereas if you can arrest somebody,</p>
<p>arrest them the whole practice or half a practice</p>
<p>for at least 10, 15 minutes,</p>
<p>and they were maybe gonna score</p>
<p>if they could work it in their mind.</p>
<p>But they knew that was gonna be their victory.</p>
<p>So in the practice room, maybe you can educate me,</p>
<p>at that, when you&rsquo;re going for the Olympic gold,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t want to allow any takedowns.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no such thing as working</p>
<p>on some kind of weird position,</p>
<p>a weak point or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to not let down, take down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like what we were saying before.</p>
<p>If something happened and somebody scored on me</p>
<p>in a certain way, I would go over that situation,</p>
<p>over that situation, over it again,</p>
<p>and I would come up with an answer.</p>
<p>And then I would actually test it.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t go right back the next day</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t want the guy to not have some,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want him to think that I was thinking</p>
<p>about it all night, I didn&rsquo;t tell him.</p>
<p>But maybe three days later when he wrestled again,</p>
<p>I actually had it figured out because he wasn&rsquo;t able to.</p>
<p>Or even if I was in on a takedown, an offensive move,</p>
<p>and I got stopped and didn&rsquo;t score,</p>
<p>I had to go back and filter that.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t something that usually I couldn&rsquo;t solve.</p>
<p>I could usually solve it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the Olympic games.</p>
<p>So I get up in the Olympic in the morning</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure when the weigh ins were,</p>
<p>but I think I was probably a pound over.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about a half a kilo and 1.1 pounds is a kilo</p>
<p>because we went in kilograms.</p>
<p>So what do you do with that pound?</p>
<p>You aren&rsquo;t off or?</p>
<p>No, I just went over to the, they had a sauna there</p>
<p>and I got in the sauna.</p>
<p>And the funny thing was the morning of the finals,</p>
<p>there was another athlete in the sauna.</p>
<p>And it was American or?</p>
<p>No, it was a European.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember where she was from.</p>
<p>Not a Russian.</p>
<p>Well, you know what?</p>
<p>I kind of think it was a plot because it was a girl.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t have her top on.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>And that was pretty common.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it was kind of interesting.</p>
<p>You think back about it because there&rsquo;s some funny things</p>
<p>that go on behind the scenes in Olympic games,</p>
<p>in world games, anytime when you have country</p>
<p>against country.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s some crazy stuff that goes on.</p>
<p>Did any of it affect you?</p>
<p>Was there any?</p>
<p>Well, I almost stayed too long in the sauna.</p>
<p>You lost a little bit over a pound.</p>
<p>I lost a little more than a pound.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t really bother me</p>
<p>because I wasn&rsquo;t like cutting a lot of weight.</p>
<p>So your match against the Russian, the&hellip;</p>
<p>Azhelyov.</p>
<p>Yeah, Azhelyov.</p>
<p>He went on to be a two time world champion,</p>
<p>a silver medalist as well.</p>
<p>I mean, this is an incredible wrestler.</p>
<p>So what was going through your mind</p>
<p>before stepping on the mat with that guy?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve beaten a bunch of wrestlers,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had a point scored on you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re stepping on the mat against this Russian</p>
<p>who you said was really, they picked,</p>
<p>the Soviets picked to beat you.</p>
<p>Right, and I know why they picked him</p>
<p>because he had a great attitude.</p>
<p>So he wasn&rsquo;t just the typical artist.</p>
<p>He was a good artist.</p>
<p>He hooked elbows like Azhelyov.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s from that area of the world</p>
<p>where they have some of those types of moves.</p>
<p>But he, and he was a goer,</p>
<p>but by cutting him down a weight,</p>
<p>he lost some of that go.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if, you gotta,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a process you gotta go about scientifically.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, if you don&rsquo;t do it as an American,</p>
<p>it can really hurt your performance.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t do it as a Russian,</p>
<p>it can hurt your performance.</p>
<p>And they already didn&rsquo;t really do that a lot</p>
<p>where you usually wrestle the weight</p>
<p>where it was more like your weight.</p>
<p>And so by cutting him down,</p>
<p>maybe slowed his belief down a little bit.</p>
<p>So you saw it in him.</p>
<p>The spirit was a little bit gone when you were facing him.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then he came back and he won rest of the matches</p>
<p>and he was in the round robin</p>
<p>and he was able to go to the finals,</p>
<p>but he had lost another match actually</p>
<p>against in the round robin against the Japanese.</p>
<p>So I think I had already gained enough of artistic,</p>
<p>being able to finish a match.</p>
<p>Once I lost my match in college for the last two years,</p>
<p>I took on some of that artistic work.</p>
<p>And I think that he was already hoping to win,</p>
<p>but he was hoping to win by a long ways</p>
<p>because he had to pin me or beat me by eight points</p>
<p>to be able to win the gold.</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t gonna happen.</p>
<p>I mean, the chances of pin is pretty good.</p>
<p>Is it hard to pin Dan Gable versus take down?</p>
<p>Like, have you taken risks where you could pay for them?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember too many that I took</p>
<p>that would actually put me in a danger position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken risk, but the risks were so scientifically,</p>
<p>technically correct that I wouldn&rsquo;t land</p>
<p>in that danger zone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if I&rsquo;m gonna lock up and throw you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna throw you to my own back</p>
<p>and roll you through.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna turn in the air.</p>
<p>So you were scientific about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I learned the hard way.</p>
<p>Early on, there was moves from collegiate wrestling</p>
<p>that you did that exposed your shoulders,</p>
<p>which it cost me in some early freestyle matches</p>
<p>against great wrestlers.</p>
<p>But I would go back to my collegiate escaping type moves</p>
<p>to where I hit a Granby roll</p>
<p>where you expose your shoulders</p>
<p>and you lose two points every time.</p>
<p>But you learn that that&rsquo;s not the system.</p>
<p>But if you hadn&rsquo;t wrestled much,</p>
<p>you would get exposed under maybe a desperate situation.</p>
<p>You would hit it.</p>
<p>So you won the gold.</p>
<p>How did it feel?</p>
<p>I think it would have,</p>
<p>I think the question would be how would it feel</p>
<p>if you lost the gold for me?</p>
<p>Because I already went through that once.</p>
<p>Not at that highest level,</p>
<p>but the National Collegiate Championship level</p>
<p>my senior year.</p>
<p>The Larry Owings loss.</p>
<p>Larry Owings, yeah.</p>
<p>And that didn&rsquo;t sit well.</p>
<p>Were you afraid of that happening again</p>
<p>at the Olympic level?</p>
<p>Was that even a thought?</p>
<p>No, I really wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But it was why I changed my philosophy of training</p>
<p>and added to the scientific artist type.</p>
<p>And if I had won that match,</p>
<p>even though I wouldn&rsquo;t have felt good about it,</p>
<p>even though I squeaked it out,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t feeling good about that match.</p>
<p>It would have affected me a little bit,</p>
<p>but if I&rsquo;d have won it,</p>
<p>I would have got over it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not over it now.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know why I was doing this kind of stuff</p>
<p>right before my match.</p>
<p>By that, I mean this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Interviews, yeah, journalists.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I really wasn&rsquo;t a good talker then.</p>
<p>I mean, me and you were talking pretty good right now,</p>
<p>except for I got a little cold,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I could say two words hardly then.</p>
<p>And they took takes.</p>
<p>Wide World of Sports said,</p>
<p>hey, we want you to be the introduction</p>
<p>for our next week&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>So I just say, hey, I&rsquo;m Dan Gable.</p>
<p>Come watch me as I finish my career undefeated 182 and 0.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they want me to say.</p>
<p>Everybody assumed you&rsquo;d be undefeated.</p>
<p>And I said it.</p>
<p>I had to take it 22 times.</p>
<p>And the last two or three times they wrote it out</p>
<p>and I read it and it still wasn&rsquo;t like I just said it.</p>
<p>I was reading it like, hi, I&rsquo;m Dan Gable.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You know, that type of stuff.</p>
<p>So, and he finally just closed the book and said,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s good enough.</p>
<p>But I turned and it was my time to wrestle.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you just, you learn that,</p>
<p>and for me it was great coaching experience</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what I turned into be.</p>
<p>You know, I coached for longer than I wrestled.</p>
<p>And I put out a lot of champions,</p>
<p>but you learn through mistakes that even in your own career</p>
<p>that you had made, you know, it&rsquo;s an ever learning process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ever learning process.</p>
<p>Have you ever been afraid on the mat?</p>
<p>Does fear have any role do you think for a wrestler</p>
<p>or it must be out there?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sure fear is out there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that was to my advantage almost every time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure in my Olympic finals, I was really off.</p>
<p>He had these doubts.</p>
<p>He probably had these doubts.</p>
<p>And that gives me the edge.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if I really ever had fear,</p>
<p>but obviously there was points in times</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t perform as well, not many, but a few.</p>
<p>And if I look back of it, look back at it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was that American, you know,</p>
<p>raw, raw, raw stuff.</p>
<p>I think it was probably the fear</p>
<p>of not being an artist as much.</p>
<p>You know, maybe this guy might be better</p>
<p>than me scientifically.</p>
<p>And you know, you&rsquo;re a scientist.</p>
<p>I think that got to me more than anything else.</p>
<p>I said early on that I want to eliminate</p>
<p>ever having to worry about getting tired in a match.</p>
<p>So I kind of eliminated that.</p>
<p>So I got rid of that point.</p>
<p>And I do think that in wrestling,</p>
<p>that is one of the fears that a lot of wrestlers have,</p>
<p>actually how they feel during the match</p>
<p>and are they gonna get tired</p>
<p>and is it gonna affect my performance?</p>
<p>And as a coach, that really was one of the things</p>
<p>I tried to eliminate on all my athletes.</p>
<p>So there wasn&rsquo;t that fear factor,</p>
<p>but that fear factor would be put upon my opponent,</p>
<p>which would give me an edge.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what I needed as much.</p>
<p>I needed to just focus,</p>
<p>make sure that I was doing the right things.</p>
<p>And I needed my team to be focused.</p>
<p>So I made sure that for my mistakes as an athlete</p>
<p>or even as a coach sometimes, that I didn&rsquo;t repeat them.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t repeat them.</p>
<p>And if you make a mistake once and then you can repeat it,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s like you didn&rsquo;t learn anything.</p>
<p>Your goal throughout your wrestling career,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve beautifully put,</p>
<p>was to work so hard that you pass out on the mat, right?</p>
<p>That you would be carried off the mat.</p>
<p>So you never did successfully in,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the ways you failed in your career</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve never worked so hard that you&rsquo;ve passed out.</p>
<p>Have you ever come close?</p>
<p>Do you remember a time that you&rsquo;ve come close</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been pushed to the limits of exhaustion?</p>
<p>You know, the question is really a good question</p>
<p>about that pushing to you collapse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t, as a coach today, I don&rsquo;t think I get,</p>
<p>if I said that to my athletes,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I could get in trouble.</p>
<p>Because, you know, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s understood, isn&rsquo;t it, by the athletes?</p>
<p>Yeah, they understand it.</p>
<p>But the outside might not understand it.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s almost like, what do you mean there?</p>
<p>You push them to the point where they go collapse.</p>
<p>It means they may die or something might happen to them.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have our kid in that type of atmosphere.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s highly unlikely</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna tell you, there&rsquo;s many times in a practice</p>
<p>where I had pushed myself to all of a sudden</p>
<p>the whistle blew or it was time to stop.</p>
<p>And when I got up off the mat or wherever I was at</p>
<p>and I needed water, I needed fresh air,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re usually in a fairly small room</p>
<p>with a lot of guys that the heat rises</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to breathe.</p>
<p>And that I can remember, and I stayed a lot of times</p>
<p>not by the door, the far end of the room.</p>
<p>I can remember walking from the far end of the room</p>
<p>to that door.</p>
<p>And I can remember, am I gonna make it the next step?</p>
<p>Am I gonna make it the next step?</p>
<p>I need air, I need water, I need oxygen,</p>
<p>I need to get out of here.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t happen often,</p>
<p>but I can recount four or five times in my career</p>
<p>that I pushed myself to that level</p>
<p>where I thought I was gonna maybe go out,</p>
<p>but every step I was dizzy.</p>
<p>But once I got to that door,</p>
<p>I was able to open it and go out and grab the water</p>
<p>and get cold water in my face.</p>
<p>And so, no, I never really was able to do that.</p>
<p>And I think the story is in a book</p>
<p>where my daughter pushed a collapse, Molly.</p>
<p>It made you proud.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, and she didn&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>But she pushed a collapse.</p>
<p>Now, did she suffer because of that?</p>
<p>Well, she didn&rsquo;t get to go to the next event</p>
<p>because she had to qualify.</p>
<p>But I think it probably helped her too,</p>
<p>realizing because she was winning the race</p>
<p>and she was beating people she normally never pushed,</p>
<p>but she was at a new level that she had never been before</p>
<p>and she only needed about five feet to finish.</p>
<p>And it was just one of those things that</p>
<p>I bet there was a lot of learning that she did there.</p>
<p>And it probably made her realize that she could be better,</p>
<p>but she had to hold up though.</p>
<p>So you mentioned in Wrestling Life</p>
<p>that the Brands Brothers looked up to Roy Salger,</p>
<p>who was known for pushing the limits of physical wrestling,</p>
<p>but not getting too rough.</p>
<p>So how do you find the line</p>
<p>between extreme physical wrestling,</p>
<p>but at the same time not rough wrestling or angry wrestling?</p>
<p>So that line between aggression, tough wrestling and anger.</p>
<p>Well, I think anger would cause less successful wrestling.</p>
<p>I think anger would cause you to make mistakes</p>
<p>and actually get out of position</p>
<p>because I think anger is kind of a loss of control.</p>
<p>And there can be a furious type of attack,</p>
<p>but I think if it crosses the line to anger,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna be vulnerable.</p>
<p>And so Royce and the Brands wrestled to the edge,</p>
<p>through the edge, but when the whistle blew,</p>
<p>they stopped.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s people that when the whistle blows,</p>
<p>they keep going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in a football game,</p>
<p>a fight breaks out and it&rsquo;s after the whistles blow.</p>
<p>Well, when the whistle blew, they backed off.</p>
<p>So that whistle was something that in a match,</p>
<p>that kind of gave them the boundaries.</p>
<p>But perhaps it could be a little bit of fuel.</p>
<p>So in Wrestling Tough, the book that you just got</p>
<p>from Mike Chapman, the new edition,</p>
<p>talks about Bill Cole, undefeated Northern Iowa wrestler.</p>
<p>And how he talked about how my strength, speed</p>
<p>and ability to think were increased tremendously</p>
<p>by just sitting apart from the action prior to the match</p>
<p>and getting into a state of controlled anger.</p>
<p>So can anger, controlled, so anger could be fuel</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s controlled.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>You had that line.</p>
<p>One side of the line, you can have an anger</p>
<p>for performance and the other side of the line,</p>
<p>if you go beyond that, it&rsquo;s not gonna be for performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be for not performance</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna lose points.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fine line.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a fine line.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about Roy Selger.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about Tom Brands.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about Terry Brands.</p>
<p>I mean, you got world championship titles there.</p>
<p>You got Olympic championship title there.</p>
<p>You got a world silver medalist in Roy Selger.</p>
<p>And when I talked to him about the world silver medalist,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s haunted by that.</p>
<p>Cause he was actually 20 seconds away from winning</p>
<p>when he got beat in the end there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s part of the game.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know whether he&rsquo;s okay with it or not.</p>
<p>Cause he says every, after talking about things,</p>
<p>he goes, I&rsquo;m okay with it now.</p>
<p>But then he keeps talking about it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really think he&rsquo;s okay with it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard for him to actually make amends to himself</p>
<p>when you really don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s no matter what the situation,</p>
<p>even with the Owings loss.</p>
<p>Yeah, it still eats it.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, I&rsquo;m a world champion.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not, and he wanted to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Olympic champion.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not, he wanted to be.</p>
<p>One of the greatest coaches of all time.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s like, why do I keep going back to it?</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t get over those things.</p>
<p>So Roy really keeps going back to it,</p>
<p>even though he says he&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But then he realizes he&rsquo;s really not fine</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just the nature of the game.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why he was able to win national titles</p>
<p>and make world teams and stuff like that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s analyzed all the people that he&rsquo;s wrestled,</p>
<p>and a lot of them have won world and Olympic championships.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s beaten every one of them at one time or another.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t get to that world championship gold</p>
<p>or Olympic gold.</p>
<p>And he says it because they did it.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s showing people that I beaten those guys.</p>
<p>But apparently he didn&rsquo;t beat them at the right time.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s still haunting.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get away from that stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just like anything in life that&rsquo;s really high.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be athletics.</p>
<p>I mean, you think I&rsquo;m ever gonna get over</p>
<p>the murder of my sister?</p>
<p>And you might not even know that.</p>
<p>Let me pause for a second, please.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about it, you&rsquo;ve written about it.</p>
<p>So I hope it&rsquo;s okay for me to say that your sister,</p>
<p>your older sister, on May 31st, 1964,</p>
<p>was raped and murdered by a local boy.</p>
<p>So the echoes of pain and anger from that tragic day,</p>
<p>do they ripple through your life still?</p>
<p>Through your wrestling, through your coaching,</p>
<p>through the way you, when you wake up in the morning?</p>
<p>What is that like?</p>
<p>It can be very emotional to me under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>And it can be the mood I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>It can be maybe if I&rsquo;ve had a Mountain Dew</p>
<p>or maybe if I&rsquo;ve had a Gable beer.</p>
<p>Yeah, or maybe if you turn the country music</p>
<p>up a little bit loud, emotions come out</p>
<p>and everybody has them in their life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so happens, what brings it out?</p>
<p>And hopefully it&rsquo;s nothing that you do</p>
<p>to the extreme point to where it brings it out.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s not extreme.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to have any of that really,</p>
<p>I can get emotional.</p>
<p>How did that change you as a man?</p>
<p>What it did was realize</p>
<p>that I was already pretty well developed</p>
<p>because I was only a sophomore,</p>
<p>15 years old in high school.</p>
<p>And I had parents that weren&rsquo;t making it.</p>
<p>And my parents are a lot older than me.</p>
<p>And now that we&rsquo;re down just to me and my parents,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna be around the house for another two years.</p>
<p>And they had just lost a daughter</p>
<p>that was the only other sibling.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t handling it.</p>
<p>They were the ones that were suffering much more than me,</p>
<p>even though I always look back upon one area</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t good at was communication at that time,</p>
<p>except inside the resident room,</p>
<p>because I had been tipped off.</p>
<p>Tipped off, what do you mean?</p>
<p>Well, then everybody said that something to me</p>
<p>about my sister just three weeks before that,</p>
<p>that really wasn&rsquo;t normal or practical.</p>
<p>And I said nothing to nobody.</p>
<p>Is there a part of you that blames yourself?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m 15 years old and you make mistakes.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t really act on everything</p>
<p>that happens in your life.</p>
<p>But I can tell you how it affected me.</p>
<p>And I acted a lot on anything</p>
<p>that maybe wasn&rsquo;t even of that consequence.</p>
<p>I mean, cause I had four daughters</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m telling you when they left every time</p>
<p>to go somewhere in a car or go out with someplace,</p>
<p>I always said something to them.</p>
<p>And they would always say, dad, you said that last night.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>What, like I love you or like be careful?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say like, don&rsquo;t be driving and drinking</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t be in a car with somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s of the same nature,</p>
<p>or stay out of trouble.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go be somewhere where you have,</p>
<p>I said, you know how to get out of a car</p>
<p>if your car goes into the river.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always thinking ahead a little bit,</p>
<p>just in case of something did happen.</p>
<p>And it goes back to that walk to school</p>
<p>with that young man that when he was talking to me</p>
<p>and I just, I took it and I kept it inside me.</p>
<p>And once I found out she had been murdered,</p>
<p>it took me maybe 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And I told my dad, I think I know who killed her.</p>
<p>And he looked at me and he just like,</p>
<p>he slapped me actually.</p>
<p>He pushed me against the car.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t slap me.</p>
<p>He pushed me against the car.</p>
<p>My mom slaps me.</p>
<p>She was the one that slapped me around a little bit.</p>
<p>But my dad, he pushed me against the car and go,</p>
<p>what do you mean you might know something about this?</p>
<p>I said, dad, I don&rsquo;t for sure,</p>
<p>but, and I would probably all crying,</p>
<p>but, and I don&rsquo;t, I doubt if I was crying yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably cried a lot of tears since,</p>
<p>but, you know, I just said,</p>
<p>hey, I was walking to school with this neighbor</p>
<p>and I never had walked to school with him before.</p>
<p>And he was kind of a troubled kid.</p>
<p>And he said something about Diane and it wasn&rsquo;t good,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t, he goes, why didn&rsquo;t you say something?</p>
<p>I said, daddy, I just boy talk, you know?</p>
<p>So, you know, and so he hugged me, he hugged me,</p>
<p>he hugged me and, you know, it was one of these things</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s definitely made me a lot of who I am</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s been a lot of choices and I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I took the word choice out of my life</p>
<p>and I just like to say, okay, do the right thing,</p>
<p>do the thing that you should do.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t really, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>are you gonna do this or this?</p>
<p>Well, what do you mean?</p>
<p>Which one&rsquo;s better?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Well, then I&rsquo;m, so I don&rsquo;t have that choice.</p>
<p>Just give me the right way to go.</p>
<p>And so not that I&rsquo;ve been perfect by any means,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s made a big difference in my life</p>
<p>on how I handle my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably given me the opportunity</p>
<p>to be married for 44 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just given me opportunities to be better in my life.</p>
<p>And I, you know, I wanna thank my sister for that,</p>
<p>you know, and I think my family was ready to make a split</p>
<p>because of that incident, they&rsquo;re blaming each other.</p>
<p>And I think that I was able to help, but more than that,</p>
<p>they really liked each other,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t really know it at the time</p>
<p>until I got out of the house.</p>
<p>Two years later, it probably was going on</p>
<p>for a couple of years until I moved on and went to college.</p>
<p>Then they found out they really liked each other</p>
<p>when they were alone and it worked out pretty good.</p>
<p>But I think them being able to follow me,</p>
<p>not just through college and the Olympics and worlds,</p>
<p>but my coaching.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same, the same success and factor,</p>
<p>you know, the excitement and all those things</p>
<p>gave them a real purpose.</p>
<p>And it gave my four daughters, it gave my wife,</p>
<p>you know, a real purpose to be able to be close</p>
<p>to all these champions and championships.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a family of 22</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all interested in what we&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going good, knock on wood.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s something that when all of a sudden</p>
<p>you got too much time in your hands</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not doing and accomplishing much</p>
<p>that things probably, you know, get off track.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of family in wrestling?</p>
<p>Can a man do it alone?</p>
<p>And if not, where&rsquo;s family most important?</p>
<p>You know, you can do it alone, but why would you want to?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think the chances of doing it alone</p>
<p>are much less than the chances of doing it together.</p>
<p>I know they say, don&rsquo;t bring your profession home sometimes.</p>
<p>They say that, I never got away from my profession.</p>
<p>And you know, sometimes I, it&rsquo;s like my house right here.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m moving home and I&rsquo;m not going to have an office</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not going to coach anymore</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not going to be an assistant athletic director</p>
<p>for a while, that you got to do something</p>
<p>that gives you a little bit of a break.</p>
<p>Not you necessarily, maybe the person you&rsquo;re living with.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if you looked outside there,</p>
<p>I got a cabin right out in my backyard.</p>
<p>You probably can&rsquo;t see it right there, but.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in the cabin?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my house away from my house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only 30 feet from my house and it&rsquo;s my office</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s my workout room.</p>
<p>I got a sauna there, it&rsquo;s a bed upstairs if I need it.</p>
<p>If I ever get too close and she says,</p>
<p>hey, why don&rsquo;t you go sleep in the other house?</p>
<p>But you know, it kicks me out of the bed, but.</p>
<p>Get the heck out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never happened.</p>
<p>But I do spend a lot of time out there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, you got to have a little distance</p>
<p>sometimes and you got to know your role.</p>
<p>And so all of a sudden when you&rsquo;re a guy that&rsquo;s been gone</p>
<p>your whole life from eight o clock in the morning</p>
<p>until close to seven, three or eight o clock at night.</p>
<p>So 11, 12 hours a day, then all of a sudden</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gone as much, even though you still work.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s trying to slow me down now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing not so much like here, what we&rsquo;re doing right now,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s when I get in the car and drive somewhere</p>
<p>or fly somewhere, you know, like just last night</p>
<p>I just went to bed and I hadn&rsquo;t told her</p>
<p>that this guy called me and he wants me to speak</p>
<p>for a bit, want to build another, wrestling wants</p>
<p>to start another wrestlers and business networking out</p>
<p>in Delaware because we don&rsquo;t have any colleges</p>
<p>in wrestling in Delaware.</p>
<p>And so I said, well, you know, I&rsquo;m glad to do that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s my life, you know?</p>
<p>So, but then all of a sudden I didn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>to my wife until all of a sudden this morning.</p>
<p>And I told her that I might go on the Friday</p>
<p>the 21st of December.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Well, I said, that&rsquo;s not Christmas.</p>
<p>She goes, we&rsquo;re celebrating Christmas that weekend early</p>
<p>because a lot of the family can&rsquo;t be here</p>
<p>except for that weekend.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I said, oh, well, that&rsquo;s not gonna work.</p>
<p>But I kind of didn&rsquo;t say anything to her at first.</p>
<p>And then, well, I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>she started getting a little emotional.</p>
<p>And if I want to stay married for another year, 45 years,</p>
<p>then I better tell those people that I got family</p>
<p>obligations because that depends what&rsquo;s most important.</p>
<p>I love wrestling.</p>
<p>I love wrestling and I want to start another,</p>
<p>start another wrestlers and business network.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more than one Dan Gable out there.</p>
<p>Well, maybe not, but there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that are maybe even closer and they got big names.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re doing pretty well right now.</p>
<p>I mean, we got first two years ago</p>
<p>and we got second this year.</p>
<p>And then we got the women&rsquo;s freestyles</p>
<p>doing good in wrestling.</p>
<p>We got to work a little bit on our Greco yet,</p>
<p>but they are working on it.</p>
<p>But our men&rsquo;s freestyle team right now are excellent.</p>
<p>And the key for them is to get them all on the same page</p>
<p>instead of just have new highlights.</p>
<p>And by that, I&rsquo;m saying, you look and see who won this year.</p>
<p>Well, the three guys that have never won before</p>
<p>won this year.</p>
<p>We had three world champions.</p>
<p>Our two past world champions didn&rsquo;t win this year.</p>
<p>I mean, they did okay, they got medals.</p>
<p>Did Borrows win?</p>
<p>No, he did not.</p>
<p>He got third.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right, he got bronze, yeah.</p>
<p>And Sajilov got, I mean, Snyder got second.</p>
<p>So those two are our main guys.</p>
<p>So the three new guys that came through</p>
<p>were guys that hadn&rsquo;t won world gold.</p>
<p>In fact, two of them have never made a world team before.</p>
<p>And so we have three world champions this year,</p>
<p>but we needed all five of them to come through</p>
<p>to win the championships.</p>
<p>And so the key really is getting them all to do the same</p>
<p>at the same time, year in and year out,</p>
<p>and not just based on, okay, Borrows got beat this year,</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;ll win next year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be every year if you&rsquo;re capable of doing that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the coaching staff has to do.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s kind of funny that I do have a lot of influence</p>
<p>actually on the coaching staffs right now at the USA level</p>
<p>because the women&rsquo;s freestyle guy is Terry Steiner.</p>
<p>And he wrestled for me, he was a national champion.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a twin brother that&rsquo;s at Fresno State.</p>
<p>And then Billy Zaddik is the freestyle coach</p>
<p>and he wrestled for the Hawkeyes back in the early days.</p>
<p>And he was the national champion.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a lot of former Gable influence on there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You got deep roots in there.</p>
<p>In 2013, the International Olympic Committee, IOC,</p>
<p>voted wrestling out of the Olympics.</p>
<p>So a lot of folks know about this,</p>
<p>the absurdity of it and so on.</p>
<p>But in a big picture, you can step back now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s five years later.</p>
<p>What did you learn from that experience?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, did it surprise me?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But did it really surprise me?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You gotta run.</p>
<p>You gotta have people running the organization</p>
<p>that are top notch.</p>
<p>If you take anything for granted</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not the person of authority,</p>
<p>somebody can kick you out.</p>
<p>And even though we had a lot of authority</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re wrestling,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re one of the first sports in the Olympics ever,</p>
<p>and that we think that we&rsquo;re in 180 some countries</p>
<p>and some of the number one countries in the world</p>
<p>that are politically strong have the sport,</p>
<p>we thought we were okay.</p>
<p>But then you gotta look and see who&rsquo;s running the IOC.</p>
<p>The IOC, the International Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>And then you gotta see that in wrestling,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have anybody in there.</p>
<p>I mean, that shocked me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never had anybody on the IOC from wrestling.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>Because we didn&rsquo;t have to, but yes, that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>You have to.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have somebody looking out for you</p>
<p>right within the structure,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s pretty easy for people to turn their head.</p>
<p>But all it took was the statement,</p>
<p>you guys are kicked out of the Olympics.</p>
<p>You guys are done.</p>
<p>Everybody came together.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s the first time in history</p>
<p>that probably all this competitive people</p>
<p>that were working for their own agenda</p>
<p>turned that agenda to the sport.</p>
<p>So that made a big difference and we got a lot done.</p>
<p>In fact, in America, there was several people</p>
<p>that were really out there that we didn&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>until this point in time.</p>
<p>And when they came aboard, now they&rsquo;re still aboard.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re doing everything perfect</p>
<p>because just because we got voted back in</p>
<p>before we even got kicked out really,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re by any means safe.</p>
<p>We have to do some of the things that I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>or some of the things that we didn&rsquo;t do before.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t fall right back into the same mess.</p>
<p>And so our leadership got changed and it&rsquo;s better,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gotta stay better.</p>
<p>But there are things that we could still be doing</p>
<p>to make sure that we don&rsquo;t have situations like this happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you, when I first learned about it,</p>
<p>I was like, I broke down and wept again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like every once in a while,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll break down and cry about my sister</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll break down, I don&rsquo;t know if I cry</p>
<p>about losing the owings, but I probably get more determined.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s kind of, you have to go back</p>
<p>and think about those moments when you heard,</p>
<p>when I heard that moment and it just overcame me.</p>
<p>It was like four o clock, 4.30 in the morning</p>
<p>when I heard about it.</p>
<p>And my wife had been up looking at the internet</p>
<p>and she woke me up and I thought she was joking,</p>
<p>but I jumped out of bed really quick when she said that.</p>
<p>I knew she was serious.</p>
<p>And I started making phone calls right then</p>
<p>to find out if it was true.</p>
<p>And when I found out it was true,</p>
<p>it was just like devastating.</p>
<p>And it was one of these things that it&rsquo;s a nightmare,</p>
<p>and, but you don&rsquo;t let it happen again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>You keep getting stronger.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if people haven&rsquo;t read,</p>
<p>they should read The Loss of Dan Gable</p>
<p>by Ray Thompson, the ESPN article.</p>
<p>That kind of, in this very beautiful poetic way,</p>
<p>ties together all the losses of Dan Gable,</p>
<p>the losing your sister, losing to Larry Owens,</p>
<p>losing wrestling from the Olympics,</p>
<p>all of these tragedies of various forms.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, well, the IOC, there&rsquo;s politics,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sort of being very pragmatic.</p>
<p>But stepping back, wrestling is one of the oldest forms</p>
<p>of combat, period.</p>
<p>Dating back, there&rsquo;s cave drawings 15,000 years ago.</p>
<p>And if you look at the ancient Olympics,</p>
<p>the Greek Olympics, 2,700 years ago,</p>
<p>did you ever, when you wrestled or coached,</p>
<p>do you now see wrestling in this way,</p>
<p>freestyle and folk style wrestling,</p>
<p>the purity of sort of two human beings locked in combat,</p>
<p>the roots of that as just human beings,</p>
<p>this fair struggle between two men or two women?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I ever looked at it</p>
<p>as anything but just a combat.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s times that have made me</p>
<p>figure out how to make that combat better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little markers or little points in time in your life</p>
<p>that make you wonder, or I should say determined,</p>
<p>to be able to get more out of yourself</p>
<p>and to be able to take it to a new level.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think people can actually feel that way</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;ve actually had a lot of accomplishments</p>
<p>in anything.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s anything out there.</p>
<p>I mean, no matter what sport</p>
<p>or breaking the four minute mile,</p>
<p>I mean, when you broke that, when they broke that,</p>
<p>Roger Bannister broke that four minute mile,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine him breaking it</p>
<p>from his best time being 4.30.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of these things that along the line</p>
<p>that he did had some close calls</p>
<p>or he had some coaching that was giving him</p>
<p>the opportunity to become a little better.</p>
<p>But I think because he was doing well</p>
<p>and being very successful, that the opportunity came.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s for me, it&rsquo;s like the same thing.</p>
<p>I had so much success</p>
<p>and so many practices that went well</p>
<p>and so much goodness out of this sport</p>
<p>that it gave me the opportunity to really look more finite</p>
<p>and look more how I can even make it better.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, if you look at my library upstairs,</p>
<p>I got a library upstairs</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of books up there from the family.</p>
<p>But if you look at the Gable books up there,</p>
<p>I got a lot of Russian technique books.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t read the book, but I can see the diagrams</p>
<p>and I can see the figures.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really show it in pictures.</p>
<p>They do it in drawings.</p>
<p>And so it was like when I was trying to beat the best</p>
<p>that has labeled the best</p>
<p>because they win the world championships every year</p>
<p>since they&rsquo;ve been just about involved.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think they got started involved</p>
<p>till like the fifties, but it&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>you study the best who&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>but then you don&rsquo;t focus so much on the best</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t beat the best.</p>
<p>You learn from them,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something that they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that you can have.</p>
<p>Toughness to technique, to the art, to the science.</p>
<p>Yeah, all that stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I even talking to you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sitting over there and you love MIT</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re bragging about it over Harvard.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>In your eyes and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And it might be, but it&rsquo;s the same type of thing</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;re probably stealing</p>
<p>from Harvard, but you won&rsquo;t give them credit.</p>
<p>Well, Dan, in the interest of time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that you&rsquo;re pretty serious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pretty seriously into fishing.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the biggest fish you ever caught?</p>
<p>What are we talking about here?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever caught a big ocean fish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m a river lake fisherman.</p>
<p>I have fish in the&hellip;</p>
<p>Trout?</p>
<p>No, probably Northern.</p>
<p>I probably caught a Northern that weighed 20 some pounds.</p>
<p>The fish I like to catch is walleyes.</p>
<p>And the reason why I like to catch them</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re really good eating fish.</p>
<p>And the best eating fish are not the real big ones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I got people hunting deer right on my land</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking for the big bucks,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not the best eaters if you want to eat,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re the best trophy.</p>
<p>So I do have a couple of trophy walleyes on the wall,</p>
<p>but most of the time I throw the big ones back</p>
<p>and put them back in there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know there&rsquo;s a book by Hemingway</p>
<p>called Old Man in the Sea.</p>
<p>Heard of it.</p>
<p>Ernest Hemingway?</p>
<p>Ernest Hemingway, yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an old man that basically</p>
<p>catches an 18 footer, but it can&rsquo;t pull it in,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the strength.</p>
<p>So they together spend while the sharks eat away at it.</p>
<p>I mean, this is very powerful story.</p>
<p>I think one of the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>but he says, it&rsquo;s better to be lucky.</p>
<p>The old man says, it&rsquo;s better to be lucky,</p>
<p>but I would rather be exact that way</p>
<p>when luck comes, you&rsquo;re ready.</p>
<p>So let me ask, what do you think about luck?</p>
<p>Do you believe in free will that we have actions</p>
<p>that control the direction, destination of our life,</p>
<p>or does luck and some other outside forces</p>
<p>really land you where you end up?</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;m not about luck,</p>
<p>but I do think luck is involved.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s mostly created,</p>
<p>just how lucky you are through preparations.</p>
<p>And things have happened in my life forever,</p>
<p>and a lot of good things.</p>
<p>And a lot of people could say,</p>
<p>hey, you&rsquo;ve been pretty lucky to win all these awards.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, if you analyze my life,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was involved with luck.</p>
<p>I think it was more involved with preparation.</p>
<p>And again, science, had you been smarter,</p>
<p>had you understood that you could do some things</p>
<p>and be just as lucky, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m only as smart as today.</p>
<p>So when I was training in my life,</p>
<p>and me even training people in my life,</p>
<p>as of that moment, that&rsquo;s how lucky I am</p>
<p>to be able to have whatever is available to me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what, you call that a lot of science.</p>
<p>So for me, I think that, like right now, if I look back,</p>
<p>I do a lot of things different,</p>
<p>just because things are proven differently.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d give people water during practice, and I did.</p>
<p>And I would let them change their wrestling shoes</p>
<p>into running shoes to run sprints on the concrete.</p>
<p>Or I would actually, maybe I&rsquo;ve had a guy climb 12 ropes</p>
<p>after practice, one after another.</p>
<p>And then maybe the next day I&rsquo;d do it again.</p>
<p>Ah, I might not make him do it the next day.</p>
<p>I might let him recover a little bit more.</p>
<p>And you gotta learn, keep adding to your philosophy.</p>
<p>And your philosophy may have been great at that time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s at that time.</p>
<p>And what is really important is where you at</p>
<p>with this time, today.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s better ways to do things.</p>
<p>Now, if you ever take attitude out of it,</p>
<p>and just depend on total science,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not gonna be as,</p>
<p>as you know, I think as I listened to a couple people</p>
<p>that are really pretty famous people.</p>
<p>One of them was John Irving.</p>
<p>He was a writer.</p>
<p>And he told me, he says,</p>
<p>you think I really learned how to be a great writer</p>
<p>in writing school?</p>
<p>He said, yeah, I learned a lot there.</p>
<p>But really what gave me the ability to stay focused,</p>
<p>to work extra hours, to be more disciplined,</p>
<p>was wrestling practices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, he was a wrestler, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, he goes, I go back to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what gave me that chance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a guy in Iowa, that guy named Norman Borlaug.</p>
<p>He learned, he invented a process</p>
<p>to feed the underprivileged countries of the world.</p>
<p>And he was a wrestler, and he said the same thing.</p>
<p>And he worked extremely hard.</p>
<p>And he said, I give a lot of credit</p>
<p>to the sport of wrestling.</p>
<p>And even though I&rsquo;m known for this,</p>
<p>and I got a statue in Washington, DC,</p>
<p>because I saved a billion lives plus,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give wrestling a lot of credit.</p>
<p>So I think some of these MMA stars</p>
<p>and some of these guys that maybe weren&rsquo;t wrestlers,</p>
<p>that had to wrestle, had to fight wrestling guys and stuff,</p>
<p>missed a little bit there.</p>
<p>But I think the ones that did have wrestling</p>
<p>probably have a really good chance</p>
<p>and can adapt to the other ones.</p>
<p>But I think every martial art or every activity is good,</p>
<p>and you probably can&rsquo;t skip any.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re ever gonna overlook</p>
<p>and say that wrestling&rsquo;s not valuable, because it is.</p>
<p>However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re gonna make it.</p>
<p>You still gotta take the values and apply it,</p>
<p>whatever area you&rsquo;re gonna be in.</p>
<p>And some people forget that.</p>
<p>Some people can&rsquo;t get over the highness</p>
<p>of getting your arm raised in a wrestling match.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even greater than me getting my arm raised</p>
<p>is that if I&rsquo;m a coach or if I belong with you,</p>
<p>that you get your arm raised.</p>
<p>And even if you don&rsquo;t get your arm raised,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what you walk away with</p>
<p>and how you learn to handle that as well.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s gonna be some losses,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want many.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t wanna get used to losing,</p>
<p>I can tell you that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the hunger for the win.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the brotherhood, the sisterhood of the wrestling room.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard work and science</p>
