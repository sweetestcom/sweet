    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing focus and concentration</p>
<p>and tools for improving your focus and concentration.</p>
<p>This is a topic that I&rsquo;ve covered previously</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast, but in different contexts.</p>
<p>For instance, we had a very popular episode on ADHD,</p>
<p>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,</p>
<p>which of course relates to the topic of focus</p>
<p>and how to improve focus.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also talked a lot about dopamine motivation and drive.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s the title of your previous,</p>
<p>also quite popular episode of this podcast.</p>
<p>But never before have we had a single episode</p>
<p>solely devoted to the tools</p>
<p>to improve focus and concentration.</p>
<p>The rationale for recording this episode</p>
<p>is to provide people one location where they can go</p>
<p>and quickly access the specific tools</p>
<p>for increasing focus and concentration</p>
<p>that are known to be the most powerful tools</p>
<p>and the most up-to-date tools.</p>
<p>In fact, today&rsquo;s episode is going to include</p>
<p>description of several peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>and the tools that emerge</p>
<p>from those scientific peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that point to new and fortunately even briefer protocols</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;ve described before.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m basically describing here</p>
<p>is tools that in a very short amount of time</p>
<p>will allow you to significantly increase</p>
<p>your focus and concentration abilities.</p>
<p>Those tools will include behavioral tools,</p>
<p>nutrition-based tools, supplement-based tools,</p>
<p>brain machine interface-based tools,</p>
<p>and for those of you that are working with physician,</p>
<p>prescription drug tools.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode ought to benefit anybody,</p>
<p>young or old or anything in between,</p>
<p>whether or not you have ADHD or not.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is going to give you tools</p>
<p>that you can apply in your daily life.</p>
<p>Most all of them are completely zero cost</p>
<p>and those tools will allow you to tap into the neurochemistry</p>
<p>and the neural circuits within your brain and body</p>
<p>that peer-reviewed science has reliably shown</p>
<p>can significantly improve your focus</p>
<p>and concentration abilities.</p>
<p>Just to give you a little teaser of the kinds of tools</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to provide you on today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>a previous guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>was Dr. Wendy Suzuki.</p>
<p>Dr. Suzuki is a professor of psychology and neuroscience</p>
<p>at New York University or NYU, as it&rsquo;s commonly referred to.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also the Dean of Arts and Sciences at NYU.</p>
<p>Her laboratory made a very important discovery,</p>
<p>which was that a very brief, just 12, actually 13,</p>
<p>if you really count the intro,</p>
<p>but 13 minute daily meditation</p>
<p>performed for a period of about eight weeks</p>
<p>significantly increased people&rsquo;s focus</p>
<p>and concentration abilities.</p>
<p>And the great news is you didn&rsquo;t need all eight weeks.</p>
<p>It was just that&rsquo;s how long that you ran the study.</p>
<p>So during today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I will describe that protocol in detail.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also provide you an even briefer alternative</p>
<p>to that protocol that you can use if, for instance,</p>
<p>you find yourself with only three minutes or four minutes</p>
<p>or five minutes a day to meditate.</p>
<p>The great news is there&rsquo;s quality peer-reviewed science</p>
<p>to support that form of meditation</p>
<p>for improving focus and concentration.</p>
<p>And that falls under the bin of these zero cost tools</p>
<p>that you can really use to tap into the neurochemistry</p>
<p>and neural circuits that really allow you to take control</p>
<p>of your cognitive abilities and improve them over time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also provide you important details about that protocol</p>
<p>and other protocols.</p>
<p>For instance, contrary to popular belief, it is not,</p>
<p>I repeat, it is not a good idea</p>
<p>to do a focused based meditation</p>
<p>within the four hours before bedtime.</p>
<p>Many people, including some of the subjects in that study</p>
<p>performed by the Suzuki Lab,</p>
<p>found that when they did a focusing meditation protocol,</p>
<p>even if it was very calming,</p>
<p>it led to difficulties in falling and staying asleep.</p>
<p>So that runs counter to a lot of what we&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>about meditation being great for sleep.</p>
<p>It turns out meditation might be great for sleep.</p>
<p>It certainly is great for improving focus capacity,</p>
<p>but I highly recommend that if you&rsquo;re going to apply</p>
<p>a focus meditation tool</p>
<p>in order to improve your focus and concentration,</p>
<p>that you make sure that that&rsquo;s performed</p>
<p>not within four hours prior to bedtime.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just a brief example</p>
<p>of the sorts of tools and protocols</p>
<p>and details about the tools and protocols</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll provide on today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>I should mention that we have provided links</p>
<p>in the show note captions</p>
<p>so that you can quickly go to the studies that we describe,</p>
<p>as well as some of the behavioral tools</p>
<p>and other tools that we&rsquo;ll cover.</p>
<p>Things like the use of binaural beats, supplements, et cetera.</p>
<p>Our goal here, again, is to provide you</p>
<p>the maximum number of tools for focus and concentration</p>
<p>that you can pick from and choose from</p>
<p>and apply in your life</p>
<p>and try and eliminate as much of the legwork required</p>
<p>to seek out and apply those tools.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about focus and concentration</p>
<p>and how you can improve your focus and concentration</p>
<p>using science-based protocols.</p>
<p>Now, because today&rsquo;s episode is mainly focused on tools</p>
<p>and not so much the underlying mechanisms,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mainly going to focus on what to do and when</p>
<p>and how to do it.</p>
<p>But I just want to take about three minutes</p>
<p>and briefly describe a model</p>
<p>that is a visual image that you can put in your mind</p>
<p>that will help you incorporate the tools that I&rsquo;ll provide,</p>
<p>and that generally will help you understand</p>
<p>at a mechanistic level how focus and concentration work.</p>
<p>So what I want you to imagine is an arrow.</p>
<p>And an arrow, of course, has an arrow head,</p>
<p>and it has the shaft of that arrow.</p>
<p>And in the context of the neuroscience</p>
<p>of focus and concentration,</p>
<p>the neurochemical system that really represents</p>
<p>the shaft of that arrow, right, the straight line,</p>
<p>is epinephrine, also called adrenaline.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;ll refer to adrenaline</p>
<p>and epinephrine interchangeably.</p>
<p>Turns out that epinephrine slash adrenaline</p>
<p>are released within your brain from a little location,</p>
<p>a little cluster of neurons called locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>but you do not need to remember that name,</p>
<p>and from your body from the adrenal glands.</p>
<p>And the release of epinephrine from those two locations</p>
<p>overall increases energy.</p>
<p>It increases alertness.</p>
<p>It does not alone increase focus, okay?</p>
<p>So the reason I&rsquo;ve assigned epinephrine, adrenaline,</p>
<p>as the shaft of the arrow is that if focus is the arrow,</p>
<p>there is no focus without epinephrine.</p>
<p>So things, whether or not they&rsquo;re behavioral</p>
<p>or psychological or supplements or drugs</p>
<p>that increase epinephrine allow focus to occur.</p>
<p>They are necessary for focus,</p>
<p>but they are not sufficient for focus.</p>
<p>That is, they are required,</p>
<p>but they are not enough to create focus.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to need epinephrine in the equation.</p>
<p>Without epinephrine, there is no focus or concentration.</p>
<p>Now, the arrowhead on this metaphorical arrowhead</p>
<p>that represents focus and concentration</p>
<p>is going to be represented or related</p>
<p>to the mechanisms of acetylcholine,</p>
<p>a different neurochemical</p>
<p>that also exists in the brain and body.</p>
<p>In fact, in the body, it&rsquo;s responsible for the contraction</p>
<p>and movement of your muscles.</p>
<p>But today we&rsquo;re talking about acetylcholine</p>
<p>not in that context,</p>
<p>but rather in the context of its release within the brain.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is released</p>
<p>from a couple of different locations in the brain.</p>
<p>And the best way to think about it</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s like a spotlight.</p>
<p>It highlights specific neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>that should be active or more active, I should say,</p>
<p>than the other neurons in the environment.</p>
<p>So the reason I&rsquo;ve assigned the arrowhead to acetylcholine</p>
<p>and acetylcholine to the arrowhead</p>
<p>is that if you have an arrow with a very big arrowhead</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really broad, really blunt,</p>
<p>imagine a mile wide arrowhead,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not very focused on any one location.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really pointing to any one location, is it?</p>
<p>But with a narrow, really tightly focused arrowhead,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s focused on one location.</p>
<p>So we have alertness, epinephrine,</p>
<p>and then we have the actual direction</p>
<p>in which our concentration and focus is placed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, at least in this mental model,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m creating acetylcholine.</p>
<p>And then in order to have ongoing focus,</p>
<p>we need another neurochemical.</p>
<p>And it turns out that that third neurochemical is dopamine,</p>
<p>a molecule often associated with pleasure and reward,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really the molecule of motivation.</p>
<p>So here, I want you to imagine in your mind an arrow</p>
<p>with an arrowhead, think acetylcholine and the arrowhead,</p>
<p>a shaft or a line behind that arrowhead,</p>
<p>which is epinephrine, also called adrenaline,</p>
<p>and then behind it, a sort of an engine</p>
<p>that keeps that focus moving forward, right?</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t just want to be focused for a moment,</p>
<p>we want to be able to focus for 10 minutes,</p>
<p>or for an hour, or maybe even for two hours.</p>
<p>Turns out there&rsquo;s an optimal duration to focus,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll teach you that in just a little bit.</p>
<p>But these three neurochemicals together,</p>
<p>acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine,</p>
<p>really allow you to get focused, to focus very precisely,</p>
<p>and in fact, increasingly precisely over time,</p>
<p>to really narrow and narrow and narrow your focus</p>
<p>progressively within a single bout of focus,</p>
<p>and to continue to do that,</p>
<p>and to be able to do that repeatedly whenever you want.</p>
<p>So here, I&rsquo;m purely talking in metaphor,</p>
<p>and in models, and mental models of arrows,</p>
<p>but in a moment or two,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start transitioning to discussing tools</p>
<p>in which I&rsquo;ll talk about increasing dopamine</p>
<p>and acetylcholine, or increasing epinephrine and dopamine</p>
<p>in various combinations with various approaches.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;d like you to conceptualize</p>
<p>is how those are contributing</p>
<p>to creating a very narrowly pointed arrow</p>
<p>that has the capacity to continue moving forward</p>
<p>over and over so that you can focus as sharply</p>
<p>and as long as you like.</p>
<p>And of course, for those of you</p>
<p>that want to get really down in the weeds</p>
<p>of how dopamine works,</p>
<p>we have an entire episode about dopamine motivation and drive</p>
<p>that really gets into neurotransmitter release,</p>
<p>and dopamine baselines, and thresholds,</p>
<p>and all of that sort of thing.</p>
<p>We also have episodes on focus,</p>
<p>much longer episodes, I should say, on focus,</p>
<p>that incorporate a lot of the biology of acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Turns out acetylcholine is also involved</p>
<p>in neuroplasticity, et cetera.</p>
<p>And epinephrine, of course, relates to stress</p>
<p>and our capacity to deal with and buffer stress,</p>
<p>and on and on.</p>
<p>Those episodes are all available to you</p>
<p>in their long form at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>You can find them very easily.</p>
<p>They are all timestamps.</p>
<p>You can navigate to the particular topics</p>
<p>most of interest to you.</p>
<p>I mentioned this all not as a diversion</p>
<p>from what we want to cover today,</p>
<p>but I know that some of you are hungry</p>
<p>for a lot more mechanism,</p>
<p>but today&rsquo;s episode is really mainly focused on the tools.</p>
<p>I will, of course, touch on mechanism,</p>
<p>but if you really want to do the deep dive on mechanism,</p>
<p>go to hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have more than you ever could want</p>
<p>about those mechanisms.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s jump into the tools for concentration and focus.</p>
<p>If you want to think about tools of any kind</p>
<p>to modify your biology or physiology in any way,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s for cognitive function,</p>
<p>or you want to get better at exercising,</p>
<p>or you want to build muscle,</p>
<p>or you want to improve your hormones,</p>
<p>you need to think and understand tools</p>
<p>in the context of modulation and mediation.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s quite simple, really.</p>
<p>Mediation is how specific types of chemicals,</p>
<p>and cells, and circuits, and organs</p>
<p>control very specific things in your brain and body,</p>
<p>whereas modulation is the ability of chemicals,</p>
<p>and cells, and circuits to adjust how different things</p>
<p>change, how different things work in your brain and body,</p>
<p>but to do it more broadly.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this?</p>
<p>Let me give an example.</p>
<p>For instance, I&rsquo;m going to tell you now</p>
<p>that one of the most important things</p>
<p>to build and maintain your focus and concentration</p>
<p>is to optimize your sleeping behavior.</p>
<p>That is to get enough quality sleep,</p>
<p>I would say 80% of the nights of your life.</p>
<p>Not everyone can get optimal sleep</p>
<p>100% of the nights of their life.</p>
<p>Nobody, truly nobody achieves that.</p>
<p>However, sleep has been shown to relate</p>
<p>to cognitive performance, physical performance,</p>
<p>hormone output, and so many other things,</p>
<p>including immune system function.</p>
<p>What we can reliably say is that sleep modulates</p>
<p>just about every process in your brain and body.</p>
<p>So you have to get great sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no tool that&rsquo;s going to allow you</p>
<p>to overcome chronic sleep deprivation</p>
<p>and allow you to remain focused.</p>
<p>No pill, no device, no supplement, no protocol whatsoever.</p>
<p>There are tools to overcome one night</p>
<p>or maybe two nights of sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about those, but at a fundamental level,</p>
<p>we need to do the things that modulate</p>
<p>our focus and attention in powerful ways,</p>
<p>and sleep really is that thing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done two episodes, one called Master Your Sleep,</p>
<p>and the other episode is Perfect Your Sleep.</p>
<p>The Perfect Your Sleep is a little bit more</p>
<p>like this episode, more focused on protocols.</p>
<p>Master Your Sleep includes protocols and mechanism.</p>
<p>Again, you can find those at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>We also have a sleep toolkit,</p>
<p>a distilled list of things to do</p>
<p>in order to optimize your sleep.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you download that.</p>
<p>You can go to hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>go to the Neural Network Newsletter.</p>
<p>It is listed there.</p>
<p>If you want, you can sign up for the newsletter,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>You can simply download the PDF of that toolkit</p>
<p>for zero cost.</p>
<p>Why do I say sleep modulates focus and attention?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll give an analogy.</p>
<p>If right now someone pulled a fire alarm in this building,</p>
<p>or if we had a fire in this building,</p>
<p>my attention would drift.</p>
<p>It would not be on recording this podcast.</p>
<p>It would be on something else.</p>
<p>But would I say that the fire alarm mediates attention?</p>
<p>I mean, fire alarms are not really involved in attention.</p>
<p>No, rather they modulate my attention.</p>
<p>The noise in the room modulates my attention.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a bit different</p>
<p>than a tool that I&rsquo;ll provide later.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just give you a little hint of now.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll give it to you now,</p>
<p>which is that 40 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>have been shown in a number of peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>to increase focus and concentration.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;d like to access 40 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>in order to improve your focus and concentration,</p>
<p>you can do that.</p>
<p>You can actually get it at zero cost.</p>
<p>You can go into the app store,</p>
<p>for instance, the Apple app store.</p>
<p>This is also available for Android phone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an app called Brainwave, and you can go there.</p>
<p>You can dial in 40 Hertz</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll play these binaural beats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been shown in multiple quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that playing a pattern of sound waves to one ear,</p>
<p>do-do-do-do-do, and the other ear,</p>
<p>which is slightly offset in frequency,</p>
<p>meaning not quite the same frequency,</p>
<p>so more like do-do-do-do,</p>
<p>that that combination of frequencies</p>
<p>played to the different ears</p>
<p>actually get integrated within deep brain centers</p>
<p>and can increase focus and concentration</p>
<p>in part by increasing levels of the neurochemical dopamine</p>
<p>and acetylcholine, which we talked about</p>
<p>a little bit earlier in this arrow model of focus.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll provide a link to that app.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any relationship to that app,</p>
<p>I should mention, but it&rsquo;s an excellent one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ve used for many years.</p>
<p>There are also additional functions within the app,</p>
<p>such as for sleep and for other things,</p>
<p>but the 40 Hertz, 40HZ is the way it reads out.</p>
<p>40 Hertz stimulation has been shown</p>
<p>to improve focus and concentration.</p>
<p>Here is my recommendation in the way that I use it.</p>
<p>I would not use 40 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>every time I&rsquo;m doing a bout of work.</p>
<p>What I tend to do is use it for about five minutes</p>
<p>prior to that work, and then turn it off</p>
<p>and then do the work,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about other tools to use during that work,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s reading or math,</p>
<p>or even just emailing or something</p>
<p>where I require a bunch of focus for a while.</p>
<p>However, there are times in which I&rsquo;m in an area</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m in a state of mind</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m feeling very distractible,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll keep the 40 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>on the entire time I&rsquo;m doing that bout of cognitive work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also sometimes use the 40 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>prior to a workout, in particular weight workouts,</p>
<p>where I really want to be able to focus on</p>
<p>and contract specific muscles.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very useful tool,</p>
<p>again, supported by quality peer-reviewed science,</p>
<p>zero cost available out there,</p>
<p>not just in the Brainwave app, but in multiple apps.</p>
<p>I think many of you will benefit from it.</p>
<p>Some of you might not experience it immediately</p>
<p>as a total dropping into a tunnel of focus</p>
<p>in the same way that you might with, say,</p>
<p>the sorts of neurochemicals that we&rsquo;ll talk about later,</p>
<p>like alpha-GPC and some of these other things</p>
<p>that change neurochemicals directly.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, 40 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>are a very powerful tool.</p>
<p>Again, zero cost, non-pharmacologic tool</p>
<p>that tap into your own endogenous, meaning within you,</p>
<p>or exists within you physiology</p>
<p>in order to increase acetylcholine</p>
<p>and some other neurochemicals.</p>
<p>And they have been shown to work quite well.</p>
<p>Okay, so assuming that you are sleeping well</p>
<p>80% of the nights of your life,</p>
<p>or at least working on the various protocols and tools</p>
<p>to sleep well and sufficiently long,</p>
<p>80% of the nights of your life,</p>
<p>and you are interested in additional tools</p>
<p>that are sound-based in order to improve</p>
<p>your ability to concentrate and focus,</p>
<p>there are quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>supporting the idea that white noise or pink noise,</p>
<p>and believe it or not, there is something called pink noise.</p>
<p>It has to do with the specific frequencies of sound</p>
<p>that are in the noise.</p>
<p>Well, white noise and pink noise</p>
<p>have been shown to not improve concentration per se,</p>
<p>but to improve people&rsquo;s ability to transition</p>
<p>into concentrated states.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t tend to use white noise and pink noise</p>
<p>while I work, but I know a number of people that do.</p>
<p>I know people that also use what&rsquo;s called brown noise.</p>
<p>The folks I know from the engineering</p>
<p>and computer science side get really into these details</p>
<p>of white noise, pink noise, brown noise.</p>
<p>You can find white noise, pink noise, or brown noise</p>
<p>and listen to it through headphones or in the room.</p>
<p>There is indeed some data to support the fact</p>
<p>that white noise, and to some extent,</p>
<p>pink noise and brown noise can support the release</p>
<p>of particular neurochemicals, but more data showing</p>
<p>that they can amplify the activity of neurons</p>
<p>in the so-called prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>this front area, sort of the bumper behind your forehead</p>
<p>that is directly related to your ability</p>
<p>to direct your own focus and remain focused</p>
<p>on certain things.</p>
<p>So you have the option of either using binaural beats before</p>
<p>but not during your work, that is 40 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>or 40 Hertz binaural beats throughout your attempt to focus.</p>
<p>You also have the option of not using binaural beats</p>
<p>but using white noise, pink noise, or brown noise.</p>
<p>Again, there are a lot of zero cost apps.</p>
<p>You can find also white noise, pink noise,</p>
<p>and brown noise on YouTube.</p>
<p>Again, these are tools that really have been shown</p>
<p>over and over in humans to allow people to focus</p>
<p>with more depth and to decrease the transition time</p>
<p>into focus.</p>
<p>This is a really key point.</p>
<p>A lot of people are challenged</p>
<p>with getting into a mode of focus.</p>
<p>None of us, however, should be expected to just sit down</p>
<p>and drop directly into a state of focus.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s completely an unfair request of ourselves.</p>
<p>I mean, for instance, you wouldn&rsquo;t expect yourself</p>
<p>to go out on the track or go out for a run and not warm up.</p>
<p>You might jog for a few minutes or even walk</p>
<p>before you would jog and then jog before you would run,</p>
<p>right, I would hope you would do that.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re doing resistance training,</p>
<p>I doubt that you go over and load up the bar</p>
<p>or the machine with the maximum amount of weight</p>
<p>that you can move and then just drop right into that.</p>
<p>You always do a warmup.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very important to understand mental work,</p>
<p>focus, and concentration as requiring that warmup.</p>
<p>What is that warmup?</p>
<p>Well, you know what that warmup is.</p>
<p>That warmup is the ramping up or the increase</p>
<p>of epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, and dopamine,</p>
<p>right, the way that neurochemicals work</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t just get to flip switches in our brain</p>
<p>because we decide to, that&rsquo;s a fantasy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the limitless movie</p>
<p>or, you know, movies and ideas that suddenly, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to flip a switch on your arm</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you&rsquo;re going to be in a laser focus.</p>
<p>That is just not the way that your nervous system works.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gradual dropping into any state,</p>
<p>whether or not that state is sleep, right?</p>
<p>You go from shallow sleep to deep sleep</p>
<p>and then out eventually.</p>
<p>Focus too, you go from shallow focus</p>
<p>to increasingly deep focus.</p>
<p>That is in our metaphor of the arrow, it&rsquo;s very broad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pointed at a lot of things.</p>
<p>And over time, as we drop into focus,</p>
<p>that arrow is narrowing and narrowing and narrowing.</p>
<p>In fact, probably better to think about it narrowing</p>
<p>and then sometimes oscillating and getting wider again.</p>
<p>You know, we might hear something down the hallway</p>
<p>or more typically our phone will buzz</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll think, oh, I wonder what so-and-so is doing</p>
<p>or I hadn&rsquo;t contacted them about something.</p>
<p>Your focus is dynamic.</p>
<p>It is not what we call a step function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you go from unfocused to focused</p>
<p>and then you drop into your maximum focus.</p>
<p>By understanding that it&rsquo;s dynamic,</p>
<p>by understanding that you are going to be continually</p>
<p>going in and out of progressively</p>
<p>but varying levels of focus,</p>
<p>you will greatly release the pressure on yourself</p>
<p>to feel focused all the time when you want to be.</p>
<p>This is very key.</p>
<p>People who are very good at focusing understand this</p>
<p>and understand that they can&rsquo;t expect themselves</p>
<p>to just immediately focus</p>
<p>and then snap into or out of focus, okay?</p>
<p>So be patient with yourself</p>
<p>and also understand that focus is an ability</p>
<p>that you can improve your ability to focus</p>
<p>by engaging the neural circuits responsible for focus</p>
<p>repeatedly over time through so-called neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the ability of your nervous system to change</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>And that has a couple of different components</p>
<p>but put very simply, what we repeat</p>
<p>gets etched into our nervous system</p>
<p>and becomes easier over time.</p>
<p>And the more emotionally important</p>
<p>or vital something feels to us,</p>
<p>the more likely it is to trigger neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about how to increase neural circuits for focus later</p>
<p>but right now what you have in hand</p>
<p>is the key importance of sleep.</p>
<p>And I, again, will direct you to hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>and the Neural Network Newsletter</p>
<p>to really work on optimizing your sleep.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also got two auditory sound-based tools</p>
<p>for improving focus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 40 Hertz binaural beats used before</p>
<p>or during bouts of focusing concentration.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like those, or even if you do,</p>
<p>you might alternate them with</p>
<p>or occasionally use white noise, pink noise, or brown noise,</p>
<p>also readily available at zero cost.</p>
<p>A question I often get is how long should I try to focus?</p>
<p>Well, the research literature point to the key importance</p>
<p>of so-called ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve all probably heard of circadian cycles</p>
<p>or circadian biology, circa the day, circadian,</p>
<p>is about 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>Well, our brain and body operate within that day</p>
<p>or within each and every day, I should say,</p>
<p>with 90-minute ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>So my suggestion would be</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re going to sit down and try and focus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to try and do a focused bout</p>
<p>of physical exercise or skill learning or musical learning,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re even just having a conversation.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re a therapist or you&rsquo;re attending therapy</p>
<p>or a class, how long should it be?</p>
<p>And the ideal duration is about 90 minutes,</p>
<p>not exactly 90 minutes,</p>
<p>but we can reliably say 90 minutes or less, okay?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the full 90 minutes,</p>
<p>but trying to push yourself to be able to drop</p>
<p>into two hours of focus or three hours of focus</p>
<p>while possible is not really in line</p>
<p>with what we know about the underlying biology.</p>
<p>Everything from our sleep states</p>
<p>or the different stages of sleep and our waking states</p>
<p>is divided into these 90-minute cycles</p>
<p>or so-called ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>So what I like to do is set a timer for 90 minutes.</p>
<p>I acknowledge and accept the fact that under most conditions,</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m really pressed for a deadline</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m optimally caffeinated, et cetera,</p>
<p>the first five to 10 minutes of that 90 minutes</p>
<p>are a transition time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the warmup for focus,</p>
<p>but I do include it in that 90 minutes.</p>
<p>And then I really try and drop into</p>
<p>doing focused mental work or learning of some sort.</p>
<p>Again, this could be physical as well,</p>
<p>motor skill learning,</p>
<p>or I think we&rsquo;re running or lifting weights, et cetera,</p>
<p>and really try and drop into that</p>
<p>across the full 90 minutes.</p>
<p>Again, accepting the fact, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an idea,</p>
<p>the fact that occasionally our focus will flicker.</p>
<p>It will jump out of focus.</p>
<p>And then a big part of being able to focus</p>
<p>is to go back to focusing.</p>
<p>The way I&rsquo;d like you to conceptualize this perhaps</p>
<p>is that arrowhead suddenly getting very, very broad,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re focusing on many things,</p>
<p>or that arrow shifts to a different location in the room.</p>
<p>The key is to be able to shift it back</p>
<p>and to narrow it once again.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an active process,</p>
<p>so much so that it requires a lot of metabolic energy.</p>
<p>Your brain is the chief consumer of metabolic energy.</p>
<p>The calories that you consume</p>
<p>is so-called basal metabolic rate.</p>
<p>Most of that isn&rsquo;t related to movement</p>
<p>or heartbeat or breathing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to brain function.</p>
<p>Your brain is a glutton with respect to caloric need.</p>
<p>So understand that at the end of 90 minutes,</p>
<p>or maybe even after 45 minutes,</p>
<p>you might feel rather tired or even exhausted.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important that after about a focus</p>
<p>that you take at least 10 minutes,</p>
<p>and ideally as long as 30 minutes,</p>
<p>and go through what I call deliberate defocus.</p>
<p>You really want to focus on somewhat menial tasks</p>
<p>or things that really don&rsquo;t require</p>
<p>a ton of your concentration.</p>
<p>This is starting to become a little bit</p>
<p>of a movement out there in the kind of pop psychology</p>
<p>and optimization world.</p>
<p>This idea of not looking at your phone</p>
<p>as you walk down the hall to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Certainly not looking at your phone in the bathroom.</p>
<p>And I should mention, by the way,</p>
<p>this is a particular annoyance of mine.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that wait times for restrooms</p>
<p>and public places has increased substantially</p>
<p>in the last 10 years?</p>
<p>The reason for that is not digestive, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>I mean, it might be the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>but chances are it&rsquo;s because people are on their phones</p>
<p>in the bathroom.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing yourself and everybody else a favor</p>
<p>by staying off your phone in the restroom,</p>
<p>staying off your phone while walking down the hall.</p>
<p>Try and give yourself some time to deliberately decompress,</p>
<p>to let your mental states idle,</p>
<p>to not be focused on any one thing.</p>
<p>That period of idling is essential</p>
<p>for your ability to focus,</p>
<p>much in the same way that rest between sets</p>
<p>of resistance training or rest between exercise</p>
<p>is vital to being able to focus and perform</p>
<p>during the actual sets or during the actual bouts</p>
<p>of running or cycling or whatever</p>
<p>your particular form of exercise might be.</p>
<p>So deliberate decompression is key.</p>
<p>And I know this is hard because we&rsquo;re all being drawn in</p>
<p>by the incredible rich array of sensory information</p>
<p>available on our phones and other devices,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough.</p>
<p>Our ability to focus is not just related</p>
<p>to what happens during the entry</p>
<p>and movement through those focus bouts,</p>
<p>but after those focus bouts,</p>
<p>we really need to deliberately decompress.</p>
<p>And of course, the ultimate decompress,</p>
<p>the time in which we are not directing</p>
<p>our thinking and our action is during sleep.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s no wonder,</p>
<p>or I should say it holds together logically</p>
<p>that that deep long-lasting duration</p>
<p>of not controlling where our mind is at</p>
<p>is in fact the ultimate form of restoration,</p>
<p>even if we have very intense dreams.</p>
<p>So take that period after each 90 minute</p>
<p>or less focus bout, right?</p>
<p>Remember those focus bouts don&rsquo;t have to be full 90 minutes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you do 45 minutes of work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just done with it.</p>
<p>Set it down and go do something for maybe five, 10,</p>
<p>maybe even 30 minutes that is functional for your day,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Just not just walking around in circles</p>
<p>or staring up at the sky,</p>
<p>although if you can do that, do that.</p>
<p>Most of us have other things to do,</p>
<p>but do things that are rather automatic</p>
<p>or reflexive for you,</p>
<p>and try not to do any focused reading,</p>
<p>try not to bring your vision into a tight location,</p>
<p>such as your phone,</p>
<p>and try and deliberately decompress</p>
<p>because that will allow you to drop</p>
<p>into intense bouts of focus again,</p>
<p>repeatedly and repeatedly throughout the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often asked how many ultradian cycles</p>
<p>one can perform throughout the day.</p>
<p>That depends on how well you&rsquo;ve slept,</p>
<p>how well you are nourished,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>and how well trained up your focus capacity is.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the paradox.</p>
<p>If you are very trained at focusing,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re very good at dropping into focus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually going to need</p>
<p>more deliberate decompression and defocus.</p>
<p>And I recommend only doing about two,</p>
<p>maybe three deep work sessions per day.</p>
<p>So not one 90-minute session</p>
<p>then expecting yourself to do another one,</p>
<p>another one, another one,</p>
<p>but rather one deep work 90-minute session</p>
<p>and maybe another in the afternoon.</p>
<p>A lot of people get surprised by this and say,</p>
<p>wait, how many people can afford</p>
<p>to just work three hours a day?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying just work three hours a day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really talking about the hard mental work.</p>
<p>And again, somewhat paradoxically,</p>
<p>the more you can concentrate,</p>
<p>the more deeply you can concentrate,</p>
<p>the fewer deep work concentration bouts</p>
<p>you can actually perform each day.</p>
<p>It makes sense, however,</p>
<p>if you think about it in the context</p>
<p>of say resistance training.</p>
<p>If you are stronger and stronger in the gym</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re an endurance athlete</p>
<p>and you can run ultra marathons 100 miles or so,</p>
<p>you are essentially cutting a deeper cut</p>
<p>into your recovery capacity</p>
<p>than somebody who&rsquo;s not very skilled at those things</p>
<p>or can&rsquo;t perform as much intense work.</p>
<p>So the intensity of the work scales directly</p>
<p>with how long you need to rest after that work.</p>
<p>I, at this stage of my life,</p>
<p>am pretty good at dropping into</p>
<p>and maintaining focused bouts of concentration,</p>
<p>provided the landscape of my life is right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have some burning, stressful thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s essential or an emergency that I&rsquo;m tending to</p>
<p>and that I put my phone away or turn it off.</p>
<p>I can do three 90-minute focus bouts per day,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>And then in between those focus bouts,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing other things that require less focus.</p>
<p>Some of you may be able to perform four.</p>
<p>What I highly recommend is that you try doing at least one,</p>
<p>that is one 90-minute or less</p>
<p>bout of focused, concentrated work per day.</p>
<p>And yes, that means the weekends too.</p>
<p>And on the weekends, I like to read a book</p>
<p>with my phone nowhere in sight, not on a device.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;ll listen to an audio book sometimes</p>
<p>while taking a walk,</p>
<p>but really concentrating on what I&rsquo;m trying to learn,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m hearing and what I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>
<p>So again, a daily 90-minute bout is one to start with.</p>
<p>And I would say after about four weeks of that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re able to stay concentrated,</p>
<p>work through the agitation,</p>
<p>then I would consider increasing the number of focus bouts.</p>
<p>Again, this is not to say that you should go to your teacher</p>
<p>or your PhD advisor or your parent or your friends</p>
<p>and say, listen, I can&rsquo;t really concentrate</p>
<p>or think about anything for more than 90 minutes per day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>These are deep focus bouts.</p>
<p>These are bouts of work,</p>
<p>or I should say mental work or physical work</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re really forcing yourself to focus and refocus,</p>
<p>to sharpen the head of that arrowhead,</p>
<p>to redirect it to what you&rsquo;re trying to concentrate on.</p>
<p>And it is indeed hard work.</p>
<p>I would even think about it more or less</p>
<p>like a workout of any kind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>

<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>I mentioned the topic of nutrition a little bit ago.</p>
<p>And of course, nutrition is a complicated topic.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the quickest ways to get yourself</p>
<p>into a battle online</p>
<p>is to say something definitive about nutrition.</p>
<p>I just want to clearly state my stance about nutrition.</p>
<p>I fully support and applaud those of you</p>
<p>that are vegans for whatever reason,</p>
<p>those of you that are pure carnivore for whatever reason,</p>
<p>and those of you that are omnivores for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I happen to be an omnivore.</p>
<p>My goal is always to eat high quality,</p>
<p>minimally or non-processed foods,</p>
<p>and to eat things in moderation.</p>
<p>So I do eat some meat from sustainable sources</p>
<p>or from organic sources.</p>
<p>I eat some starches and I eat vegetables and I eat fruits.</p>
<p>I try not to eat sugars,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t really like highly processed foods</p>
<p>at this point in my life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me, that&rsquo;s what I do,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m certainly not dictating what people should eat.</p>
<p>I know certain people are ketogenic,</p>
<p>and I can say that for people who achieve ketosis</p>
<p>and can get into ketosis, yes, indeed,</p>
<p>there is a mental state associated with ketosis</p>
<p>that will allow your brain to function</p>
<p>and to think really clearly</p>
<p>that many people find very attractive</p>
<p>and keep them going back over and over again</p>
<p>to a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody who, for instance,</p>
<p>has not been in ketosis many times in my life,</p>
<p>at least not deliberately so,</p>
<p>but I actually will ingest liquid ketones</p>
<p>from time to time because of the further</p>
<p>cognitive enhancement or physical enhancement</p>
<p>that I experience on top of nutrition</p>
<p>that does include some carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of different ways to approach all this.</p>
<p>Whether or not you&rsquo;re a vegan, omnivore,</p>
<p>vegetarian, carnivore, et cetera, the point is this.</p>
<p>Your ability to focus, and in fact,</p>
<p>your ability of neurons to encode</p>
<p>specific information in your environment,</p>
<p>that is to represent what&rsquo;s out there in the world,</p>
<p>is actually related to your blood glucose level.</p>
<p>Now, here I&rsquo;m setting aside the discussion</p>
<p>of ketosis and ketogenic diets for the moment,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a beautiful study</p>
<p>that was published in Neuron not long ago</p>
<p>that showed that the tuning,</p>
<p>that is the precision with which neurons in the brain</p>
<p>represent things in our environment,</p>
<p>is actually much greater</p>
<p>when there is sufficient glucose in the brain.</p>
<p>Translated into English, this means that when we are fasted</p>
<p>or when our blood glucose is very low,</p>
<p>we aren&rsquo;t able to perceive and think about things as clearly.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a twist to this, however.</p>
<p>Many people who practice intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>and I should say I practice</p>
<p>a sort of pseudo-intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>I generally eat my meals between the hours</p>
<p>of 11 a.m. and 8 p.m.,</p>
<p>although sometimes there&rsquo;s some wiggle around that.</p>
<p>Occasionally I have an early breakfast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super rigid about it,</p>
<p>but I know there are a number of people</p>
<p>who are doing longer fasts</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re eating in a six-hour window.</p>
<p>We did an entire episode about fasting.</p>
<p>You can, again, find that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll likely have Sachin Panda,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an expert in intermittent fasting, on the podcast.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting</p>
<p>has a lot of different potential benefits.</p>
<p>For some people, it&rsquo;s a convenient way</p>
<p>to restrict their calories.</p>
<p>For other people, it&rsquo;s a convenient way to avoid eating.</p>
<p>That is, it&rsquo;s easier to not eat</p>
<p>than to eat a small portion,</p>
<p>so they opt for intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But one of the things that you hear very often</p>
<p>is that some people like being fasted</p>
<p>because they like the clarity of mind that it provides.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the situation.</p>
<p>Neurons, unless you&rsquo;re in a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>really thrive on glucose.</p>
<p>They love glucose.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>your ability to think and perceive things</p>
<p>is actually enhanced</p>
<p>by having sufficient glucose in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>So why would it be that some people experience</p>
<p>a heightened state of mental clarity when they are fasted?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly experienced that before.</p>
<p>Well, I should say that provided you&rsquo;re well-hydrated enough</p>
<p>and you have enough electrolytes in your system,</p>
<p>what tends to happen is that when you ingest food,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a shift in your nervous system</p>
<p>towards so-called parasympathetic mode.</p>
<p>That is, the more relaxed,</p>
<p>you probably heard it as rest and digest,</p>
<p>although it does other things,</p>
<p>a more relaxed mode that can indeed make us very sleepy.</p>
<p>If we have too many carbohydrates,</p>
<p>it actually can make us quite sleepy.</p>
<p>However, if we have any food,</p>
<p>if we have enough of it,</p>
<p>that is, if our gut is full,</p>
<p>it diverts blood to our gut,</p>
<p>and we become sleepy and we can&rsquo;t focus as well.</p>
<p>So a lot of people really like fasting</p>
<p>in the state of being fasted for focus and concentration</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>as much of that parasympathetic activation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just not as sleepy.</p>
<p>And in fact, under those conditions,</p>
<p>half as much caffeine will give you just as much lift</p>
<p>as twice as much caffeine</p>
<p>will give you on a full belly of pasta.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the way that caffeine interacts</p>
<p>with blood glucose.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;d like you to imagine</p>
<p>is if you had a measure of focus from zero to 10,</p>
<p>these are arbitrary units,</p>
<p>10 being maximally focused</p>
<p>and zero being not focused at all.</p>
<p>Imagine a U-shaped function, right?</p>
<p>Where if you&rsquo;re very fasted,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a high degree</p>
<p>of focus and concentration.</p>
<p>But then if you ingest some food and your belly is full,</p>
<p>your focus and concentration is reduced.</p>
<p>But having enough blood glucose</p>
<p>and maybe even elevated blood glucose</p>
<p>will increase cognitive function.</p>
<p>So there are two ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>On one end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>blood glucose is relatively low and you&rsquo;re fasted</p>
<p>and you can think and behave in a very concentrated way.</p>
<p>And on the other end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>you have a lot of blood glucose,</p>
<p>or I should say sufficient blood glucose.</p>
<p>You never want your blood glucose to be too high.</p>
<p>And that allows your neurons to encode and perceive</p>
<p>and basically allow you to think really clearly.</p>
<p>So you sort of have to pick your condition.</p>
<p>What do you want for your balance of focus and concentration?</p>
<p>I actually do both.</p>
<p>So what I do is, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>I eat my meal sometime around 11 a.m.,</p>
<p>my first meal typically,</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m very hungry when I wake up.</p>
<p>And so I will do my workout and one bout of focused work.</p>
<p>I always think of this as my hard work early in the day.</p>
<p>And I do that fasted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be consuming water with electrolytes,</p>
<p>maybe Element or other electrolytes,</p>
<p>maybe some caffeine as well</p>
<p>in the form of Yerba Mate or coffee.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my first focus bout of 90 minutes or less.</p>
<p>That is essentially done fasted.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll eat.</p>
<p>And then I do notice after I eat,</p>
<p>I actually have a diminished capacity to focus.</p>
<p>But then again, in the afternoon,</p>
<p>I will do another 90 minute bout of focus</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about some of the tools I use</p>
<p>to make sure that that bout of focus is optimal</p>
<p>for getting the most amount of focused work done,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s mental work or physical work,</p>
<p>although I tend to do my physical work early in the day</p>
<p>and my mental work both early and late in the day.</p>
<p>So to make this very simple,</p>
<p>or as simple as I can for you,</p>
<p>being fasted is great for focus and concentration,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re not thinking about food the entire time.</p>
<p>And being fed is terrific for focus and concentration,</p>
<p>because it actually can improve neuronal function</p>
<p>provided that you didn&rsquo;t eat too much food.</p>
<p>So one way to manage this is if you&rsquo;re going to have a lunch</p>
<p>to make sure that you don&rsquo;t stuff yourself at lunch,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not overeating and to not get quite so full</p>
<p>that you push your nervous system</p>
<p>into this parasympathetic mode</p>
<p>and make it hard to focus in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people experience a dip</p>
<p>or even a crash in energy in the afternoon</p>
<p>that make it really hard to focus.</p>
<p>For that reason, I&rsquo;ll just remind people of a tool</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about many times before,</p>
<p>which is based on the biology of adenosine</p>
<p>and caffeine, et cetera,</p>
<p>which is to delay your first caffeine intake</p>
<p>to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up.</p>
<p>I know that can be painful for certain people.</p>
<p>I violate that rule when I&rsquo;m working out</p>
<p>very early in the morning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll drink my caffeine before my workout,</p>
<p>which often occurs within 30 to 60 minutes of waking.</p>
<p>But in general, unless I&rsquo;m working out very early,</p>
<p>I will ingest my caffeine 90 to 120 minutes</p>
<p>after I wake up.</p>
<p>So again, I want to emphasize</p>
<p>that if you hear somebody out there say</p>
<p>being fasted is optimal for focus and concentration,</p>
<p>well, that is true in one context</p>
<p>and perhaps ideal for a certain part of the day.</p>
<p>And other people will say,</p>
<p>no, you know, neurons run on glucose.</p>
<p>You need glucose in your bloodstream</p>
<p>in order to get those neurons to be tuned.</p>
<p>That is to respond with electrical activity</p>
<p>in the optimal way when you&rsquo;re reading something</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re trying to perform exercise.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s also true.</p>
<p>And of course you can incorporate both.</p>
<p>I, in fact, as I just described,</p>
<p>incorporate both fasted states and fed states</p>
<p>in order to optimize my concentration and focus.</p>
<p>And as a brief note about ketosis,</p>
<p>for those of you that actually managed</p>
<p>to transition into ketosis</p>
<p>and are maintaining a ketogenic state,</p>
<p>that, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>can enhance brain function, concentration, and focus</p>
<p>because of the way in which ketones can be used</p>
<p>as a so-called optimal fuel for neurons.</p>
<p>The ketogenic diet was originally designed, if you will,</p>
<p>for epilepsy.</p>
<p>It has a whole relationship to epilepsy</p>
<p>and controlling epileptic seizures.</p>
<p>And it can, in fact, allow people</p>
<p>to achieve focus-concentrated brain states.</p>
<p>So in the future, I&rsquo;ll do an episode about ketosis</p>
<p>and be sure to circle back on how to optimize ketosis</p>
<p>for focus and concentration.</p>
<p>Although I have to believe</p>
<p>that most of the people listening to this</p>
<p>are probably not in ketosis or following a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I mainly focused on fasted states</p>
<p>and fed states.</p>
<p>And just to make sure that I&rsquo;m thorough,</p>
<p>a fasted state, to me, would be a state</p>
<p>in which you haven&rsquo;t ingested any calories,</p>
<p>but may have ingested caffeine</p>
<p>or maybe even a small amount of artificial sweetener</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>but really haven&rsquo;t ingested</p>
<p>any significant number of calories</p>
<p>in the previous four to eight or maybe even 12 hours.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s tremendous variation here</p>
<p>depending on how long people have fasted,</p>
<p>whether or not we&rsquo;re talking about the state</p>
<p>right after people wake up, et cetera.</p>
<p>Again, if you&rsquo;re interested in intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>both for sake of mental and physical health and performance,</p>
<p>check out our episode on fasting at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>I also want to touch back on this idea</p>
<p>of which foods can increase focus.</p>
<p>You know, in the episode on ADHD that I did,</p>
<p>I touched on this quite a bit</p>
<p>as it relates to elimination diets.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a whole industry</p>
<p>and a ton of interest, for obvious reasons,</p>
<p>into what sorts of things kids and adults</p>
<p>should and shouldn&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>in order to reduce symptoms of ADHD.</p>
<p>I think that the sum total of those data</p>
<p>point to the fact that reducing simple sugar intake</p>
<p>and certainly highly processed foods,</p>
<p>so ice cream, candy, chips, et cetera,</p>
<p>those sorts of things really does seem to improve symptoms</p>
<p>of ADHD in both children and adults.</p>
<p>But once you move past that and you start to say,</p>
<p>well, which foods can improve concentration and focus?</p>
<p>Well, foods that, for instance, include a lot of tyrosine,</p>
<p>which is a precursor to dopamine,</p>
<p>and now you know why dopamine is important in this context,</p>
<p>are certainly going to increase concentration and focus.</p>
<p>So things like Parmesan cheese, certain meats, certain nuts,</p>
<p>you can look up which foods</p>
<p>contain high amounts of tyrosine.</p>
<p>There are also some fruits and vegetables</p>
<p>that include higher amounts of tyrosine.</p>
<p>But to be quite direct,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether or not you&rsquo;re ingesting foods</p>
<p>that are rich in the precursor amino acids to dopamine,</p>
<p>acetylcholine, et cetera,</p>
<p>if you are consuming large amounts of those foods.</p>
<p>That is, one can look and see, for instance,</p>
<p>that a steak includes a lot of the precursors</p>
<p>to acetylcholine.</p>
<p>It has amino acid precursors to dopamine as well,</p>
<p>and there are other foods that will do that as well.</p>
<p>But if I were to ingest, say, two ribeye steaks,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of meat,</p>
<p>and it will direct a lot of blood to my gut,</p>
<p>and it will cause me to be sleepy,</p>
<p>and that will create challenges in me</p>
<p>being able to achieve states of focus and concentration.</p>
<p>So the simple way to put this is,</p>
<p>if you eat too much or you eat a very large volume of food,</p>
<p>you are going to diminish your focus and concentration.</p>
<p>The key is to eat enough that you&rsquo;re nourished</p>
<p>for the certain activities, mental and physical,</p>
<p>that you need to perform.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re eating large meals,</p>
<p>you are going to diminish your concentration and focus.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>I know many people are curious as to whether or not caffeine</p>
<p>can improve focus and concentration, and indeed it can.</p>
<p>There is an immense amount of data supporting the idea</p>
<p>that caffeine, provided it&rsquo;s consumed</p>
<p>in the appropriate dosages,</p>
<p>can improve mental performance and physical performance,</p>
<p>and it largely does that through improvements</p>
<p>in focus and concentration.</p>
<p>The dosage of caffeine, of course,</p>
<p>is going to depend on how caffeine adapted you are,</p>
<p>how much caffeine tolerance you have.</p>
<p>And that is going to vary tremendously</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you ingest that caffeine</p>
<p>with or without food, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>But there is a kind of general range</p>
<p>in which we can talk about caffeine</p>
<p>as being useful for focus and concentration.</p>
<p>And the range is basically from 100 milligrams</p>
<p>to 400 milligrams.</p>
<p>I want to caution everybody out there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who suffers from anxiety</p>
<p>or panic attacks, and you&rsquo;re not used to ingesting caffeine,</p>
<p>and you run out and ingest 400 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>in the form of espresso, or yerba mate,</p>
<p>or an energy drink, or in pill form,</p>
<p>that is going to be very uncomfortable for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Your heart rate is going to increase.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be quite panicked, in fact,</p>
<p>or at least anxious.</p>
<p>So be cautious with your use and adopting of caffeine</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not already caffeine adapted.</p>
<p>But most people do quite well</p>
<p>to ingest 100 to 200 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>prior to doing some focused work.</p>
<p>And again, I recommend delaying your caffeine intake</p>
<p>to 90 to 120 minutes after waking,</p>
<p>unless you are using that caffeine</p>
<p>to really jolt your system before a workout.</p>
<p>Caffeine can, of course, be ingested in various forms,</p>
<p>even pill form.</p>
<p>But most people ingest it in the form of coffee,</p>
<p>or my particular favorite way to ingest caffeine</p>
<p>is yerba mate.</p>
<p>It is important, and I should note,</p>
<p>that you should actively avoid</p>
<p>the smoked versions of yerba mate</p>
<p>as they contain a lot of carcinogenic</p>
<p>cancer-promoting compounds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some great yerba mate brands out there.</p>
<p>The most cost-effective way to consume it</p>
<p>would be to use the loose leaf tea</p>
<p>and to pour water over that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one particular brand that I like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any affiliation to them whatsoever,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been using it for years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Anna Park.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an organic brand that is sold.</p>
<p>I buy mine on Amazon,</p>
<p>but you can find it elsewhere on the internet as well.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t have any affiliation to them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very cost-effective, very clean.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have the smoked flavor,</p>
<p>at least the one that I buy is not the smoked variety,</p>
<p>so none of the carcinogenic compounds are in there,</p>
<p>at least that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>And I like the way it tastes,</p>
<p>and it provides a very even lift and stimulant</p>
<p>that I think certainly works for me</p>
<p>and that a number of people I know</p>
<p>that have suggested to also enjoy.</p>
<p>Yerba mate or caffeine also have other additional benefits.</p>
<p>In particular, the caffeine in yerba mate and coffee</p>
<p>and other sources of caffeine</p>
<p>are known to increase the density and efficacy,</p>
<p>that is the number and the function of dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>And this has been shown in humans several times.</p>
<p>So by ingesting caffeine pretty regularly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually increasing the ability of dopamine</p>
<p>to have this effect of increasing motivation and drive.</p>
<p>I tend to ingest caffeine only early in the day.</p>
<p>I tend to cut off my caffeine intake</p>
<p>somewhere around one or 2 p.m.</p>
<p>to ensure that I can get into a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>But I realize that there are people out there</p>
<p>that ingest caffeine as late as two or three</p>
<p>in the afternoon and can still sleep fine.</p>
<p>I will caution those of you that think</p>
<p>that you can drink caffeine in the evening or nighttime</p>
<p>and still fall asleep.</p>
<p>All of the research points to the fact</p>
<p>that the architecture of your sleep</p>
<p>and the depth of your sleep is disrupted.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re able to fall and stay asleep,</p>
<p>the sleep you&rsquo;re getting is simply not as good</p>
<p>as the sleep you would get</p>
<p>if you were to shut off your caffeine intake</p>
<p>at least eight hours before bedtime,</p>
<p>and ideally more like 10 or even 12 hours</p>
<p>before bedtime.</p>
<p>But of course, there are practical constraints as well.</p>
<p>Okay, so caffeine is increasing dopamine&rsquo;s function</p>
<p>by changing the number and efficacy of dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>But of course, it also increases our wakefulness,</p>
<p>our alertness, and that is largely</p>
<p>through the neurochemical systems related to adenosine,</p>
<p>which is a molecule that builds up in our brain and body</p>
<p>the longer we are awake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the sleepiness system, if you will.</p>
<p>Makes us feel fatigued or tired.</p>
<p>And caffeine also operates on the epinephrine,</p>
<p>the adrenaline system.</p>
<p>In fact, if we ingest too much caffeine,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll sometimes get the jitters.</p>
<p>Those jitters are really the sympathetic,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called, nervous system&rsquo;s bias toward movement.</p>
<p>And our pupils will dilate.</p>
<p>They actually get broader.</p>
<p>Now, somewhat paradoxically, when our pupils get bigger,</p>
<p>the pupils of our eyes, that is,</p>
<p>our visual world actually narrows.</p>
<p>It becomes more tunnel-like.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t realize this.</p>
<p>When our pupils are really small,</p>
<p>that means we are relaxed.</p>
<p>So if you ever see someone with really tiny</p>
<p>or pin-sized pupils, they&rsquo;re very relaxed.</p>
<p>If their pupils are very big, they&rsquo;re very dilated,</p>
<p>well then, they are very amped up.</p>
<p>They are very, very alert.</p>
<p>Caffeine increases alertness by increasing epinephrine,</p>
<p>adrenaline release, both in the brain and within the body.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s another way that it facilitates</p>
<p>focus and concentration.</p>
<p>Now, there are other ways to increase epinephrine</p>
<p>in the brain and body besides caffeine or other stimulants.</p>
<p>And in fact, that has been studied.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an excellent study that was carried out</p>
<p>not that long ago on how stress itself</p>
<p>can increase our ability to focus and concentrate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, how stress itself</p>
<p>can increase focus and concentration.</p>
<p>You know, most people think of stress</p>
<p>as impairing our ability to focus,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually not true.</p>
<p>When we are stressed, it involves the deployment,</p>
<p>the release of adrenaline, epinephrine,</p>
<p>and that adrenaline both changes our visual field,</p>
<p>in other words, it narrows our vision</p>
<p>to a more tunnel-like focus.</p>
<p>That is, it makes the arrow in our metaphor</p>
<p>of the arrow more sharp,</p>
<p>and it improves our concentration.</p>
<p>This makes sense given what we know about stress.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re stressed, we tend to be stressed</p>
<p>about a specific thing.</p>
<p>We start anticipating or wondering or thinking about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen next, what led up to this?</p>
<p>How is this going to impact me?</p>
<p>How do I feel right now?</p>
<p>It really narrows the context</p>
<p>of our thinking and our behavior.</p>
<p>So one of my favorite studies that really illustrates</p>
<p>how stress can improve concentration and performance</p>
<p>is one that was published not that long ago,</p>
<p>and I will provide a link to this in the show notes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a paper published</p>
<p>in the journal Experimental Psychology in 2020.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is, not surprisingly,</p>
<p>Acute Stress Improves Concentration Performance,</p>
<p>first author DeGroote, D-E-G-R-O-O-T-E.</p>
<p>And this study involved taking a number of subjects</p>
<p>and stressing them out or not prior to a cognitive</p>
<p>or concentration task.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of data in this paper,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just going to home in on one specific set of data.</p>
<p>And I should mention as I go there that they measured things</p>
<p>like cortisol, a stress hormone, and they measured anxiety.</p>
<p>It was a quite thorough study.</p>
<p>And what they found was that concentration performance</p>
<p>improved many fold, I should say,</p>
<p>from there was a greater than doubling of concentration</p>
<p>and performance in the stress group.</p>
<p>And stress in this context was provided</p>
<p>using a standard way of inducing stress.</p>
<p>What they basically do is they bring subjects</p>
<p>into the laboratory and they have to either do something</p>
<p>fairly mundane in the control group,</p>
<p>or they have to do a simulated job interview,</p>
<p>an arithmetic task, and they&rsquo;re being evaluated</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t intense psychosocial stress.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not watching anything disturbing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not being traumatized in any kind of way.</p>
<p>This is fairly low levels of stress that rates their levels</p>
<p>of epinephrine, and we know this from this study,</p>
<p>and other levels of cortisol and other stress hormone</p>
<p>modestly within their brain and blood.</p>
<p>But that even modest increase in these stress hormones</p>
<p>and their reported psychological levels of stress</p>
<p>really enhanced their focus and concentration.</p>
<p>This may come as surprising because you,</p>
<p>like many people think, gosh,</p>
<p>stress really diminishes cognitive performance,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>Stress improves cognitive performance.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are other ways</p>
<p>to increase stress levels and to do that in healthy ways</p>
<p>to improve concentration and performance.</p>
<p>And one of the best ways to do that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so sure fire and it&rsquo;s generally safe,</p>
<p>provided you do it safely, is deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve talked about on the podcast before,</p>
<p>but deliberate cold exposure can be achieved</p>
<p>by getting into a cold shower for one to five minutes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not used to it,</p>
<p>you probably want to start with one minute,</p>
<p>or you can get into an ice bath,</p>
<p>or nowadays there are a number of different</p>
<p>commercial sources of circulating cold water,</p>
<p>or if you have access to a body of cold water,</p>
<p>like a lake or a pool or an ocean.</p>
<p>We know that getting into cold water or under cold water</p>
<p>greatly increases epinephrine levels</p>
<p>and dopamine levels in the brain and blood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful study that was published</p>
<p>in the European Journal of Physiology</p>
<p>that showed that the increases in dopamine are massive,</p>
<p>you know, near doubling or more of dopamine levels</p>
<p>that are very long lasting for hours.</p>
<p>And epinephrine and indeed cortisol levels</p>
<p>are also increased, and in ways that support</p>
<p>not just immune system function, because they do that,</p>
<p>and mood, because it does that,</p>
<p>but they can really improve concentration and focus.</p>
<p>I touched on this a little bit in an episode about memory,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an age-old practice,</p>
<p>really dating back to medieval times,</p>
<p>of putting people into cold water</p>
<p>right after they learn something</p>
<p>in order to spike, to increase their epinephrine</p>
<p>as a way to consolidate those memories.</p>
<p>For sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in ways</p>
<p>to improve focus and concentration,</p>
<p>you need to increase your epinephrine,</p>
<p>your adrenaline levels.</p>
<p>Cold water exposure</p>
<p>is one of the most efficient ways to do that.</p>
<p>This is not a biohack.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the word hack.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s commonly used,</p>
<p>but a hack is something where you&rsquo;re using one thing</p>
<p>for a different purpose</p>
<p>than it was originally intended for.</p>
<p>And here, I&rsquo;m not referring to the shower or the cold bath,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to epinephrine.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is a neurochemical</p>
<p>that will place your vision into more of a tunnel mode,</p>
<p>which will allow you to focus on cognitive work</p>
<p>or physical work in a more specific way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be as distractible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very easy to achieve</p>
<p>by getting into a cold shower</p>
<p>or a cold body of water for a brief period of time.</p>
<p>People always ask how long to get under or into cold water</p>
<p>and how cold to make it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, it should be uncomfortably cold,</p>
<p>but safe to stay in for one to five minutes.</p>
<p>Okay, so uncomfortably cold that you really want to get out,</p>
<p>but safe to stay in.</p>
<p>Not so cold that it&rsquo;s going to give you a heart attack</p>
<p>and not so warm that it&rsquo;s comfortable</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t create that adrenaline release.</p>
<p>Cold water exposure, I should say deliberate cold water</p>
<p>or non-deliberate cold water exposure,</p>
<p>reliably increases epinephrine levels.</p>
<p>It is incredibly useful as a tool for this.</p>
<p>And it is in fact zero cost or even negative zero cost.</p>
<p>How could it be negative zero cost?</p>
<p>Well, you can certainly save on your heating bill</p>
<p>by taking a cold shower, so that&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>And for those of you that have access to devices</p>
<p>or locations where you can get into cold water,</p>
<p>you can submerge, well, then that can work.</p>
<p>For those of you that don&rsquo;t, maybe you take a cold bath,</p>
<p>you get in up to your neck,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be most efficient.</p>
<p>For those of you that can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get under a cold shower.</p>
<p>Again, it should be uncomfortably cold</p>
<p>to the point where you want to get out,</p>
<p>but that you can safely stay in for one to five minutes.</p>
<p>How long should you do it before a work bout?</p>
<p>Well, if you get into really cold water,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uncomfortably cold and get out</p>
<p>after about three minutes, you&rsquo;re probably good to go.</p>
<p>Dry off and get to work.</p>
<p>Some of you might think this is a little bit silly</p>
<p>as a tool for focus and concentration,</p>
<p>but if you look at the data on epinephrine</p>
<p>and how powerfully it can increase focus,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be very impressed.</p>
<p>I mean, it certainly can increase one&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to attend to specific visual stimuli.</p>
<p>So for reading or math work, et cetera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very useful.</p>
<p>And of course, you don&rsquo;t want to make it so cold</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re shivering and chattering the whole time.</p>
<p>And of course you could, if you like,</p>
<p>combine this with 40 Hertz binaural beats.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why you couldn&rsquo;t combine</p>
<p>the two protocols.</p>
<p>But the point here is that a lot of people would love to,</p>
<p>and I think ought to, leverage the health-promoting</p>
<p>and powerful effects of increasing epinephrine</p>
<p>on focus and concentration.</p>
<p>And running out and getting stressed by a life event</p>
<p>or getting into an argument or something like that</p>
<p>simply as a way to increase focus and concentration</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem that adaptive to me.</p>
<p>So deliberate cold exposure is a straightforward way</p>
<p>to do that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t involve anyone else.</p>
<p>I suppose you could do it with somebody else,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t require anyone else.</p>
<p>And again, there are zero, low,</p>
<p>and even negative cost ways to approach that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to know how long the positive effects</p>
<p>of epinephrine last toward improving focus</p>
<p>and concentration, well, if we look to that study</p>
<p>from DeGroote et al.,</p>
<p>the Acute Stress Improves Cognitive Performance Study,</p>
<p>they measured concentration before and 30 minutes</p>
<p>after the stress was induced.</p>
<p>And there does appear to be a quite long-lasting,</p>
<p>really up to an hour or more,</p>
<p>effect of increasing epinephrine.</p>
<p>So how might you apply these sorts of protocols</p>
<p>early in the day or later in the day?</p>
<p>Well, one suggestion or one potential protocol would be</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to sit down and do some work,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re already feeling alert and focused,</p>
<p>no need to reach to this tool.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re feeling like your focus and alertness</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t quite where you&rsquo;d like it to be,</p>
<p>you could take a three-minute very cold shower</p>
<p>or submerge yourself in cold water for three minutes.</p>
<p>You might have a cup of coffee as well,</p>
<p>and then sit down and do that work.</p>
<p>Maybe even throw in the 40 Hertz binaural beats.</p>
<p>All of that would be layering in the different systems,</p>
<p>the different neurochemicals,</p>
<p>such as acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine</p>
<p>that are going to lend themselves</p>
<p>to a really terrific 90-minute or less workabout.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to discuss some of the purely behavioral tools</p>
<p>that quality peer-reviewed science say</p>
<p>can improve focus and concentration significantly.</p>
<p>At the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I talked about the study from Dr. Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>where they explored a 13-minute meditation</p>
<p>done every day for a period of eight weeks.</p>
<p>That meditation led to significant improvements</p>
<p>in focus and concentration ability,</p>
<p>as well as other aspects of cognitive performance.</p>
<p>It also improved mood and reduced stress.</p>
<p>So you might be wondering what exactly is this meditation?</p>
<p>The meditation is very simple,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one that anyone can perform.</p>
<p>What you would want to do is set a timer</p>
<p>for about 13 minutes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it has to be exactly 13 minutes,</p>
<p>but since that&rsquo;s what they included in the study,</p>
<p>you would set a timer for 13 minutes.</p>
<p>You would sit or lie down, close your eyes,</p>
<p>and you would simply focus on your breathing.</p>
<p>Most people are going to benefit</p>
<p>from only doing that breathing through their nose,</p>
<p>but if you have some sort of obstruction</p>
<p>or inability to breathe just through your nose,</p>
<p>you could probably also do it by breathing</p>
<p>through your nose and mouth or just your mouth.</p>
<p>But ideally, you would do just nasal breathing</p>
<p>for a period of 13 minutes,</p>
<p>concentrating on that breathing,</p>
<p>and concentrating, meaning bringing your awareness,</p>
<p>your so-called interoceptive awareness,</p>
<p>if you wanted to get really technical about it,</p>
<p>your interoceptive awareness to a point</p>
<p>just about an inch inside of your forehead.</p>
<p>Now, of course, that might sound kind of gory</p>
<p>to some of you who&rsquo;ve never actually</p>
<p>been inside your forehead,</p>
<p>but just about an inch behind your forehead</p>
<p>is where you would want to place your concentration</p>
<p>while also concentrating on your breathing.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the thing about meditation</p>
<p>that all studies of meditation show,</p>
<p>which is that unless you are a very experienced meditator,</p>
<p>your concentration, your focus will drift</p>
<p>away from your breathing and away from that location</p>
<p>about an inch inside your head, inside your brain,</p>
<p>about just behind your forehead.</p>
<p>That will happen maybe every 10 seconds,</p>
<p>every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds.</p>
<p>But an important part of such a meditation practice</p>
<p>to improve concentration and focus</p>
<p>is that you are continually refocusing</p>
<p>back to that specific location</p>
<p>and refocusing back on your breath.</p>
<p>This is something that, again, is not often discussed.</p>
<p>People think that if you do a meditation</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re supposed to concentrate on your breath,</p>
<p>that if your mind drifts,</p>
<p>that somehow you failed in that meditation,</p>
<p>but actually that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>A huge component of improving your ability</p>
<p>to focus and concentrate by way of neural plasticity,</p>
<p>rewiring of the circuits for focus and concentration</p>
<p>is the repeated return to a state of focus</p>
<p>from a state of non-focus or diminished focus, okay?</p>
<p>So think about it like trying to drive down the freeway</p>
<p>and staying between the lane lines, excuse me,</p>
<p>and every once in a while,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a bit of drift on the vehicle,</p>
<p>maybe the wheels aren&rsquo;t aligned correctly</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s something else wrong with the chassis</p>
<p>or the steering device,</p>
<p>it starts to drift right a little bit.</p>
<p>Then you hit the rumble strip to go,</p>
<p>and then you pull back to the center.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what a focused meditation practice is about,</p>
<p>as opposed to expecting yourself</p>
<p>to stay between the mental lane lines, so to speak.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s going to do a practice</p>
<p>of the sort that I described,</p>
<p>13-minute meditation practice every day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d want to sit or lie down, close your eyes,</p>
<p>start to concentrate on your breath,</p>
<p>focus your attention on a location</p>
<p>about an inch behind your forehead,</p>
<p>and then fully expect that at some point</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be thinking about something else,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a cue to focus back to that location,</p>
<p>just about an inch behind your forehead</p>
<p>and back to your breath.</p>
<p>By doing that repeatedly over and over,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re really training up</p>
<p>is the network within your brain</p>
<p>that indeed includes that prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re focusing on,</p>
<p>as well as some other structures,</p>
<p>the inferotemporal cortex, indeed the hippocampus,</p>
<p>a structure associated with memory,</p>
<p>and other components of the neural circuit</p>
<p>that are involved in directing</p>
<p>our mental focus and concentration.</p>
<p>Again, I can&rsquo;t emphasize the importance</p>
<p>of this practice being one of focusing and refocusing.</p>
<p>In fact, I would prefer to call such a practice</p>
<p>a refocus-focused meditation,</p>
<p>or a constantly refocusing,</p>
<p>or maybe you all can come up with a better name for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not that good at naming things.</p>
<p>But this sort of meditation practice</p>
<p>has been shown in the study by the Suzuki Lab</p>
<p>and other studies to really improve people&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to focus and remain focused,</p>
<p>so much so that in the beautiful book,</p>
<p>Altered States,</p>
<p>they describe a number of different meditation practices,</p>
<p>some a little bit longer than the one that I described,</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s 17 minutes, another one that&rsquo;s 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Some people will meditate as long as 60 minutes a day,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s quite a long time, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The point here isn&rsquo;t how long you focus,</p>
<p>or somehow trying to achieve total focus</p>
<p>for the entire 13-minute, or 17-minute,</p>
<p>or 60-minute bout of meditation.</p>
<p>While that would be wonderful,</p>
<p>and I think many people aspire to do that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of hard mental work.</p>
<p>I think for most people out there, including myself,</p>
<p>a relatively short meditation practice of about 13 minutes,</p>
<p>in which you fully expect your focus</p>
<p>and concentration to drift,</p>
<p>but that you are continually refocusing</p>
<p>is going to be the most effective.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, the most effective at teaching yourself</p>
<p>to focus and stay concentrated.</p>
<p>In fact, I invite you to interpret every time</p>
<p>that you focus off that location</p>
<p>about one inch behind your forehead</p>
<p>as an opportunity to refocus</p>
<p>and think about the refocusing as the trigger</p>
<p>for teaching your neural circuits</p>
<p>how to focus for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>And as a bonus to that sort of meditation practice,</p>
<p>the study from Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab also showed</p>
<p>that people experience improvements in sleep</p>
<p>and improvements in memory.</p>
<p>So not just improvements in mood and reduction in stress</p>
<p>and improvements in focus and concentration,</p>
<p>but all these other positive benefits</p>
<p>from just doing that 13-minute-a-day meditation practice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ve started to adopt</p>
<p>and have felt tremendous benefit from,</p>
<p>and that I encourage many of you to try as well.</p>
<p>The one cautionary note is the one that I mentioned</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>which is because the refocus, as I&rsquo;ll call it,</p>
<p>meditation does involve a significant amount of effort</p>
<p>and engagement of these prefrontal cortical circuits,</p>
<p>it is disruptive to sleep</p>
<p>if performed too closely to sleep.</p>
<p>So if you are going to do that practice,</p>
<p>I recommend that you not do it</p>
<p>within the four hours prior to your bedtime.</p>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned that I would talk about ways</p>
<p>to improve focus if you are sleep-deprived.</p>
<p>This is something that I&rsquo;m all too familiar with.</p>
<p>I put a lot of effort into optimizing my sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that with each passing year,</p>
<p>I put more and more effort into, again,</p>
<p>because sleep is so vital for mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance of all kinds.</p>
<p>But certainly in my role as a student,</p>
<p>in my role as a professor, and in my role in life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had numerous times</p>
<p>in which I simply did not get enough sleep</p>
<p>or my sleep was terrible for whatever reason,</p>
<p>and yet I still had work demands and social demands,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>One practice that is very effective</p>
<p>at allowing you to focus better than you would otherwise</p>
<p>under conditions of sleep deprivation</p>
<p>is so-called non-sleep deep rest, or NSDR.</p>
<p>This is also referred to sometimes as yoga nidra.</p>
<p>Yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep.</p>
<p>Yoga nidra is a practice of lying down</p>
<p>for about 10 to 30, sometimes even as long as 60 minutes.</p>
<p>You listen to a script, it&rsquo;s an audio script,</p>
<p>that takes you through a progressive deep relaxation.</p>
<p>It involves a body scan, some long exhale breathing.</p>
<p>It is very restorative in the sense</p>
<p>that one tends to emerge from yoga nidra or NSDR</p>
<p>feeling greatly refreshed</p>
<p>compared to how you felt prior to it.</p>
<p>There is also terrific neuroimaging data</p>
<p>from laboratories in Denmark</p>
<p>showing that there&rsquo;s a restoration of dopamine levels</p>
<p>in the so-called basal ganglia after NSDR, aka yoga nidra.</p>
<p>Whether or not you call it yoga nidra or NSDR,</p>
<p>which is what I refer to it as, non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>you can find these scripts at zero cost, multiple places.</p>
<p>You can find there are certain apps</p>
<p>that are NSDR or yoga nidra apps.</p>
<p>There is a NSDR protocol that was put out there by Madefor,</p>
<p>which is on YouTube that you can access for free.</p>
<p>There is a NSDR, or I should say a number of NSDR protocols</p>
<p>through the Virtusan app.</p>
<p>There are, again, number of different places</p>
<p>that one can access NSDR protocols.</p>
<p>I do NSDR for 10 to 30 minutes per day, every single day,</p>
<p>not just on days where I&rsquo;m sleep-deprived.</p>
<p>If I happen to be sleep-deprived,</p>
<p>I would extend that NSDR to 30 or 60 minutes.</p>
<p>And when you do that NSDR</p>
<p>will depend on when you have time for that NSDR.</p>
<p>When I haven&rsquo;t slept well,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll try and do is find a quiet place</p>
<p>where I can do NSDR for 30 or ideally 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Sometimes I will fall back asleep during that NSDR.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine if you do that,</p>
<p>but most people will stay awake during the NSDR.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll emerge from that and go about my day.</p>
<p>If in the afternoon I&rsquo;m very fatigued</p>
<p>because of lack of sleep,</p>
<p>I might do another NSDR of 10 to 30 or 60 minutes,</p>
<p>and then another work bout.</p>
<p>Again, NSDR is something I do every day.</p>
<p>I talk a lot about this in the episodes related to sleep</p>
<p>because it can help you get better at falling</p>
<p>and staying asleep at night,</p>
<p>in addition to feeling restorative</p>
<p>in that immediate timeframe of the day</p>
<p>in which you do NSDR.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s immensely beneficial at various times</p>
<p>and for various purposes.</p>
<p>But here within the context of trying to concentrate</p>
<p>and focus when you&rsquo;re sleep deprived,</p>
<p>NSDR, aka yoga nidra, is an immensely beneficial practice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s growing amounts of quality science</p>
<p>pointing to the neurochemical replenishing effects,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, dopamine,</p>
<p>but also the potential for NSDR</p>
<p>to replace sleep that you&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>I would never want anyone to try and use NSDR</p>
<p>as a total replacement for sleep,</p>
<p>but under conditions in which you cannot control your sleep,</p>
<p>NSDR is going to be the best way</p>
<p>that I am aware of to restore your ability</p>
<p>to focus and concentrate for whatever purpose.</p>
<p>And if you emerge from your NSDR</p>
<p>and then drink some caffeine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice an even greater capacity</p>
<p>for focus and concentration</p>
<p>for all the reasons directly related to caffeine.</p>
<p>So again, NSDR is a general tool</p>
<p>for enhancing your ability to sleep.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a tool that you can use</p>
<p>in order to compensate for,</p>
<p>at least to some degree,</p>
<p>compensate for lost sleep</p>
<p>when you need to focus and concentrate.</p>
<p>One thing that really contrasts NSDR and yoga nidra</p>
<p>with the sort of focus meditation</p>
<p>that I talked about a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>the 13-minute meditation,</p>
<p>is that during the 13-minute meditation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actively trying to refocus and focus,</p>
<p>whereas during NSDR and yoga nidra,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually trying to defocus.</p>
<p>So you can think of the 13-minute meditation</p>
<p>for refocusing and focusing</p>
<p>as directly tapping into and mediating improvements</p>
<p>in the circuitry for focus and concentration,</p>
<p>whereas you can think of NSDR and yoga nidra</p>
<p>as modulating your brain and body state</p>
<p>to allow you to focus and concentrate better.</p>
<p>Now, another tool that you can use</p>
<p>to directly tap into the circuits</p>
<p>for focus and concentration</p>
<p>and to greatly accelerate neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the improvements, or I should say,</p>
<p>the changes in those circuits</p>
<p>that will allow you to focus and concentrate better,</p>
<p>is hypnosis.</p>
<p>A lot of people hear hypnosis</p>
<p>and they think stage hypnosis,</p>
<p>you know, people squawking like chickens</p>
<p>and doing things against their will.</p>
<p>But actually hypnosis is a atypical</p>
<p>but highly accessible brain state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been studied with a lot of rigor</p>
<p>at Stanford University School of Medicine</p>
<p>by my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been a guest on this podcast previously.</p>
<p>Hypnosis is a unique brain state</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one in which you are deeply focused</p>
<p>and yet deeply relaxed.</p>
<p>So to just sort of set up the array of practices here</p>
<p>so you can think about them logically,</p>
<p>the focus-refocus meditation is based on</p>
<p>and focused on focus, no pun intended.</p>
<p>NSDR and yoga nidra are aimed at deep relaxation.</p>
<p>Hypnosis is this atypical, very powerful brain state</p>
<p>in which you combine high levels of focus</p>
<p>and deep relaxation.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a little bit of a tough one</p>
<p>to just take oneself into,</p>
<p>but fortunately there&rsquo;s a tool</p>
<p>based on a lot of quality peer-reviewed research</p>
<p>from the Spiegel Lab and other labs,</p>
<p>and that is the Reveri app, R-E-V-E-R-I.</p>
<p>The Reveri app is available for no cost,</p>
<p>at least for a period of time,</p>
<p>and then I think they place certain elements</p>
<p>of it behind a paywall,</p>
<p>but you can try it zero cost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available for Apple soon,</p>
<p>I think also to be available for Android,</p>
<p>and they have specific hypnosis protocols</p>
<p>that you listen to, and these are very brief protocols.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re listening to a particular audio script</p>
<p>of David Spiegel himself,</p>
<p>and some progressive breathing</p>
<p>and actually some eye movements</p>
<p>that are directly linked to the neural circuits</p>
<p>that allow for these highly focused, deeply relaxed states.</p>
<p>And there are components within the Reveri app</p>
<p>specifically geared towards</p>
<p>improving focus and concentration.</p>
<p>So again, there&rsquo;s meditation for focus,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,</p>
<p>which take you into deep relaxation,</p>
<p>and then hypnosis is this very special,</p>
<p>very directed state of highly focused</p>
<p>and highly relaxed, or I should say deeply relaxed,</p>
<p>that allow access to the neural circuits</p>
<p>for focusing concentration</p>
<p>and allow you to tune those up</p>
<p>and to improve those very significantly</p>
<p>in a very brief amount of time.</p>
<p>And again, some of those hypnosis scripts</p>
<p>are as short as eight minutes,</p>
<p>some are as long as 13 minutes.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>are zero cost tools that directly tap</p>
<p>into the neural circuits,</p>
<p>the components within your brain</p>
<p>that allow for deep relaxation,</p>
<p>allow for deep focus,</p>
<p>and improve your ability to focus and concentrate over time</p>
<p>simply by repeating these.</p>
<p>How often do you need to repeat the Reveri hypnosis</p>
<p>for focus and concentration before you see benefits?</p>
<p>Well, that will vary from person to person.</p>
<p>I tend to use it once every third or fourth day</p>
<p>and have experienced tremendous benefits from it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m unique in that sense.</p>
<p>They have a lot of data to support this Reveri app</p>
<p>and the protocols within it.</p>
<p>How long do you have to do NSDR</p>
<p>before you experience those benefits?</p>
<p>There, I would say the first time and every time</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so deeply relaxing</p>
<p>that you emerge from it feeling quite restored</p>
<p>relative to how you went into it.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier in the study on meditation,</p>
<p>it took about eight weeks to see the effects</p>
<p>that they observed in that study,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t observe shorter time points.</p>
<p>So I highly encourage people to explore meditation</p>
<p>geared towards focus and refocus,</p>
<p>also NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, aka Yoga Nidra,</p>
<p>and the Reveri app,</p>
<p>specifically the hypnosis within the Reveri app</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s geared towards improving focus and concentration.</p>
<p>All of these have terrific science to support them.</p>
<p>This is not woo science or hacks</p>
<p>or just something that people came up with.</p>
<p>This is all grounded in work</p>
<p>from some of the best universities in the world,</p>
<p>from excellent groups</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve looked at underlying neural mechanisms</p>
<p>and measured things with a lot of rigor, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>These tools are available to you.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you use them.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in the optimal time of day to do these,</p>
<p>we already mentioned that the focus refocus meditation</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be done too close to sleep.</p>
<p>The Reveri hypnosis app can be done at any time.</p>
<p>Really, in fact,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a component of falling back asleep in there.</p>
<p>In other words, a hypnosis</p>
<p>specifically geared toward helping people</p>
<p>teach themselves to fall back asleep</p>
<p>when they wake up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>NSDR, I always say, can be done first thing in the morning,</p>
<p>in the afternoon, or any time of day.</p>
<p>And in fact, I&rsquo;ll sometimes do that</p>
<p>in the middle of the night</p>
<p>if I happen to wake up and need to get back to sleep.</p>
<p>So really these tools can be applied most any time of day,</p>
<p>except for that one caveat</p>
<p>about the focus refocus meditation</p>
<p>not being done too close to sleep.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s another set of behavioral tools</p>
<p>that can really help enhance one&rsquo;s ability to focus.</p>
<p>And those are visual-based tools.</p>
<p>In fact, the tools I&rsquo;m about to describe</p>
<p>are actually being employed in a number of schools</p>
<p>in China and elsewhere in order to teach children</p>
<p>to focus better and for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>The key principle here is that</p>
<p>much of our cognitive focus,</p>
<p>our ability to think about something in a very specific way</p>
<p>and stay focused on it to read</p>
<p>or to follow a line of conversation</p>
<p>or math or music, et cetera,</p>
<p>is going to be directed by our visual system.</p>
<p>Our visual system has two forms of attention and focus.</p>
<p>One is overt focus, which is very straightforward.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m looking at the tip of my pen,</p>
<p>for those of you listening right now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at the tip of my pen, that&rsquo;s overt focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m focusing on it with my eyes.</p>
<p>And of course the rest of my brain then will follow</p>
<p>and start to analyze the details of what I&rsquo;m seeing,</p>
<p>the contours of the pen, et cetera.</p>
<p>It seems sort of obvious when you first hear it,</p>
<p>but our cognitive focus tends to follow</p>
<p>our overt visual focus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also why they put blinders on horses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also why sometimes wearing a hoodie or a hat</p>
<p>or limiting your visual field in some way</p>
<p>can help you enhance your cognitive focus.</p>
<p>It can help limit distraction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not seeing as much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why when we ingest caffeine</p>
<p>or any kind of stimulant or we are stressed</p>
<p>and our pupils dilate and our vision becomes</p>
<p>more tunnel-like, less panoramic, but more tunnel-like,</p>
<p>you know, they say a soda straw view of the world</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re looking through a tunnel,</p>
<p>your focus, your visual focus is actually driving</p>
<p>your cognitive focus.</p>
<p>Your cognitive focus is narrower than it would be</p>
<p>if you were seeing the whole scene that you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So when you hear this, it sounds obvious,</p>
<p>but for many people, including many scientists,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not obvious that this would be the case.</p>
<p>However, that is the case.</p>
<p>Your visual focus drives your cognitive focus.</p>
<p>So what is a practice that has been studied</p>
<p>in various laboratories and that&rsquo;s being employed</p>
<p>in various schools is to have children or adults</p>
<p>visually focus on one location for a given period of time.</p>
<p>How long?</p>
<p>Anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, three minutes is a long time</p>
<p>to maintain visual focus at one location.</p>
<p>If you were to try that right now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably find it to be a bit of a strain,</p>
<p>but if you want to try it, you can.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, you, yes, are allowed to blink,</p>
<p>but also keep in mind that meditation refocusing practice</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>that the refocusing is the key component</p>
<p>of teaching yourself or your brain,</p>
<p>you are your brain, your brain is you,</p>
<p>but to teach yourself how to focus better.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to incorporate this practice,</p>
<p>what you would want to do is pick a location.</p>
<p>It could be on a wall,</p>
<p>it could be on your computer in front of you,</p>
<p>although I would encourage it to not be the contents</p>
<p>of your computer screen.</p>
<p>You might just want to blank your screen.</p>
<p>You might want to put a piece of paper</p>
<p>with a crosshatch there, any sort of visual target,</p>
<p>or you can imagine a visual target,</p>
<p>and then focus your visual attention on that target</p>
<p>and try to breathe normally, try and stay relaxed,</p>
<p>and certainly allow yourself to blink</p>
<p>so that your eyes don&rsquo;t dry out.</p>
<p>This is not a test of how long you can go without blinking.</p>
<p>By focusing on that particular location</p>
<p>and by forcing yourself to refocus on that location,</p>
<p>anytime your gaze, your vision drifts from that location,</p>
<p>you are encouraging the circuits for focus</p>
<p>to get better at focusing for longer and longer</p>
<p>and at refocusing when your focus drifts off</p>
<p>of that location.</p>
<p>This is incorporating neural circuits,</p>
<p>including the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>things like the frontal eye fields.</p>
<p>For those of you curious about the underlying biology,</p>
<p>this practice is recruiting certain elements</p>
<p>of your so-called prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>also the frontal eye fields,</p>
<p>which are locations not far from the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>that are involved in deliberately directing your gaze</p>
<p>to particular locations in space, not outer space,</p>
<p>although you could do this by focusing on stars, I suppose,</p>
<p>but in visual space.</p>
<p>Now, I mentioned before</p>
<p>that this is overt visual focus and attention.</p>
<p>You are overtly looking at that location,</p>
<p>but one also very powerful practice</p>
<p>for improving focus and concentration</p>
<p>is to use covert focus.</p>
<p>Covert focus is where my gaze,</p>
<p>my eyes are focused on one location, such as my pen,</p>
<p>but my focus is actually directed elsewhere</p>
<p>in the room or location that I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>My mind and, to some extent, my peripheral vision</p>
<p>is focused, in this case, on the door just to my left</p>
<p>in the room that I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>That takes a little bit more effort.</p>
<p>This is something that all old world primates,</p>
<p>of which we are old world primates, are able to do,</p>
<p>and it probably evolved as part of the mechanism</p>
<p>by which animals could evaluate their scene,</p>
<p>evaluate predators, evaluate other primates</p>
<p>while not necessarily staring at them directly</p>
<p>so they can obtain information.</p>
<p>We can obtain information</p>
<p>without having to direct our gaze</p>
<p>specifically to one location.</p>
<p>Maybe we can obtain information from multiple locations.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can.</p>
<p>Without getting too far down the rabbit hole</p>
<p>of how vision and cognition relate,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve done episodes on that previously,</p>
<p>and simply focusing on the tools</p>
<p>that can be incorporated to improve focus and concentration,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what I recommend.</p>
<p>Set yourself a low bar at first and set a timer</p>
<p>and try to focus on one location for 30 seconds,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it for that day.</p>
<p>The next day, you might add five seconds,</p>
<p>and then the next day, five seconds after that.</p>
<p>If you miss a day, no big deal.</p>
<p>Simply do the practice for the same amount of time</p>
<p>that you did the last time that you did the practice,</p>
<p>and then gradually try and increase the amount of time</p>
<p>that you can focus on one visual location overtly</p>
<p>by looking directly at that location.</p>
<p>If you like, and if you feel you have the ability,</p>
<p>you can try and do this through covert attention and focus</p>
<p>by looking straightforward, for instance,</p>
<p>and attending to something in the corner of the room</p>
<p>and trying to do that for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find that that&rsquo;s quite a bit harder,</p>
<p>and then extending that by five seconds</p>
<p>every time you do the practice.</p>
<p>This is something that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you necessarily have to build up to being able to do</p>
<p>for a full hour in order to extract the benefits.</p>
<p>In fact, the best way to think about this practice</p>
<p>is as a means to get into a focused state.</p>
<p>If you remember back about an hour or so ago,</p>
<p>I was talking about how focused states</p>
<p>are not a drop all the way in and then exit type phenomenon.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just drop into a focused state</p>
<p>the same way we don&rsquo;t drop into the peak performance</p>
<p>of a workout, we warm up.</p>
<p>So what I recommend is having a 30 second</p>
<p>to three minute period at the beginning of about a focus</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to do work or physical work,</p>
<p>and anchoring your vision to one location</p>
<p>somewhere in the room, or if you want to do it covertly,</p>
<p>setting a timer and trying to do that</p>
<p>for anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing when you exercise that practice</p>
<p>is you are ramping up neural activity</p>
<p>within the neural circuits</p>
<p>that create focus and concentration.</p>
<p>Then I would stop looking at that location</p>
<p>or that covert location,</p>
<p>and then I would move to the work that you&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>either mental work or physical work.</p>
<p>And if about halfway through your 90 minute bout,</p>
<p>or at some point in your 90 minute bout of work or exercise,</p>
<p>you feel that your concentration is drifting,</p>
<p>rather than look at your phone</p>
<p>and scroll through the thousands of contexts</p>
<p>that exist within social media or your phone,</p>
<p>try just picking a location again on the wall,</p>
<p>focusing back on that location,</p>
<p>using that as a ramp up to then direct your focus</p>
<p>back towards if your weight training sets and reps</p>
<p>that you might be performing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running, you might do this,</p>
<p>or cycling, you might do this</p>
<p>by focusing on a particular location</p>
<p>and really homing in on that location physically.</p>
<p>And this is a practice that a lot of athletes use, in fact.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re say doing musical practice or math,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;d want to focus on something</p>
<p>other than the task that you&rsquo;re trying to perform.</p>
<p>But again, using visual focus as a way to ramp up</p>
<p>and increase your overall ability to focus and concentrate,</p>
<p>and then applying that to whatever it is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to learn or perform.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to talk about compounds</p>
<p>that can improve concentration and focus.</p>
<p>And these are most often consumed as supplements,</p>
<p>although some of them I should mention</p>
<p>can also be derived from food.</p>
<p>Again, I just want to remind you that there are things,</p>
<p>in this case compounds,</p>
<p>that can modulate a biological mechanism.</p>
<p>That is, can modulate focus and concentration.</p>
<p>And there are compounds that can mediate,</p>
<p>can directly contribute to concentration and focus.</p>
<p>One of the key compounds</p>
<p>that supports concentration and focus,</p>
<p>because it generally supports mood,</p>
<p>concentration, and focus, and brain function in general,</p>
<p>are the omega-3 essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the omega-3 essential fatty acids</p>
<p>in a variety of contexts, in particular depression,</p>
<p>but also ADHD.</p>
<p>There are interesting data on that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really clear that getting somewhere</p>
<p>between one and three grams of EPA,</p>
<p>that is one to three grams of EPA,</p>
<p>essential fatty acid per day, can improve outcomes.</p>
<p>That is, can improve mood</p>
<p>and can improve cognitive function.</p>
<p>And while there&rsquo;s some debate</p>
<p>about whether or not it can improve cardiac function,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear, at least to me,</p>
<p>that ingesting one to three grams</p>
<p>of EPA essential fatty acids per day is beneficial.</p>
<p>But again, in the context of focus and concentration,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in modulating the neural circuits and brain function</p>
<p>that are going to support focus and concentration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if taking one to three grams</p>
<p>of EPA essential fatty acids per day</p>
<p>is going to tap directly into only the circuits</p>
<p>for focus and concentration.</p>
<p>That said, and as discussed on the episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast with Dr. Rhonda Patrick</p>
<p>and on the episode on ADHD that I did</p>
<p>and on the episode on depression that I did,</p>
<p>I make it a point to ingest one to three grams</p>
<p>of EPAs per day.</p>
<p>You can get those EPAs from other sources</p>
<p>besides supplements, of course,</p>
<p>but supplements are going to be the easiest way to do that.</p>
<p>You could do that through liquid form, fish oil,</p>
<p>cod liver oil, some people who are vegan</p>
<p>opt for other sources of EPAs.</p>
<p>You can find those out there, certainly.</p>
<p>Some people even use prescription EPAs</p>
<p>to get the dosage really high.</p>
<p>Dr. Rhonda Patrick talked about this in the episode with me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually something that she does.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take the prescription form.</p>
<p>I get them through pill form</p>
<p>through our supplement affiliate, which is Momentous.</p>
<p>But there are a number of different quality sources</p>
<p>of EPAs out there.</p>
<p>And some of those quality sources also include things</p>
<p>like fatty fish, algae, and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll leave it to you as to whether or not</p>
<p>you supplement with omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>in order to get that one to three grams per day</p>
<p>or whether or not you do it through food.</p>
<p>But I would encourage you to try and reach that threshold</p>
<p>because there are a number of known positive effects</p>
<p>for mood and brain function generally.</p>
<p>The other thing that can positively modulate brain function</p>
<p>and that actually works as a fuel for neurons to function</p>
<p>and can improve cognitive performance</p>
<p>in particular within the brain circuits</p>
<p>such as the prefrontal cortex that are involved</p>
<p>in concentration and focus is creatine.</p>
<p>I know many people are familiar with creatine monohydrate</p>
<p>for its effects on muscle growth</p>
<p>and strength and performance.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s quite clear that the bulk of scientific studies</p>
<p>have examined the role of creatine in the clinical context</p>
<p>and as its role in improving cognitive performance.</p>
<p>So my read of the literature has led to a practice</p>
<p>in which I ingest five grams per day</p>
<p>of creatine monohydrate,</p>
<p>the sort of standard form that&rsquo;s available in.</p>
<p>This is generally available as a powder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly how I take it.</p>
<p>I take the creatine powder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mix it with water or with my athletic greens</p>
<p>or some sort of electrolyte drink,</p>
<p>whatever liquid happens to be convenient to ingest that in.</p>
<p>The time of day doesn&rsquo;t really seem to be important.</p>
<p>Some people are strong believers</p>
<p>in consuming creatine post-workout.</p>
<p>While that might be beneficial,</p>
<p>I simply take it in the morning or post-workout.</p>
<p>It sort of depends on when I remember to take it.</p>
<p>But that five grams of creatine per day,</p>
<p>in my case, really isn&rsquo;t geared towards muscle growth</p>
<p>or strength or performance</p>
<p>as much as geared toward tapping</p>
<p>into the creatine phosphate system within the brain</p>
<p>and specifically the benefits of creatine</p>
<p>for prefrontal cortical networks.</p>
<p>Again, modulating, not directly mediating,</p>
<p>but modulating and generally supporting</p>
<p>the brain networks that are going to allow me</p>
<p>to generate focus and concentration.</p>
<p>So much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>creatine monohydrate five grams a day</p>
<p>seems to generally support brain function,</p>
<p>which will generally support concentration and focus.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of compounds</p>
<p>that more specifically mediate concentration and focus,</p>
<p>we have to go back to that arrow metaphor model</p>
<p>that we talked about at the beginning of the episode</p>
<p>that included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,</p>
<p>which acts as this attentional spotlight.</p>
<p>In fact, acetylcholine and elevated levels of acetylcholine</p>
<p>have been shown over and over again</p>
<p>through beautiful work from Mike Merzenich&rsquo;s lab at UCSF</p>
<p>and the Kilgard lab down in Houston</p>
<p>and a number of other labs,</p>
<p>including Norm Weinberger&rsquo;s lab at UC Irvine again,</p>
<p>to improve or even directly gate neuroplasticity</p>
<p>by increasing focus directly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of word soup,</p>
<p>but basically what happens is</p>
<p>if acetylcholine transmission is increased</p>
<p>even transiently within the brain,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a greater opportunity</p>
<p>for neuroplasticity to take place.</p>
<p>And the reason there&rsquo;s a greater opportunity</p>
<p>for neuroplasticity, aka learning, to take place</p>
<p>is by way of the increased focus</p>
<p>that spiking acetylcholine can provide.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>there are a number of different foods which contain choline.</p>
<p>You can look those up online.</p>
<p>Choline acting as an amino acid precursor to acetylcholine,</p>
<p>but of course there are compounds,</p>
<p>there are supplements that can further</p>
<p>and more acutely increase acetylcholine,</p>
<p>and indeed I use these myself.</p>
<p>The most effective one I&rsquo;ve found is alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>Alpha-GPC consumed at dosages of 300 milligrams</p>
<p>to 600 milligrams prior to a workout</p>
<p>greatly increase one&rsquo;s ability to focus and concentrate.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s been my experience.</p>
<p>And there are some good data in humans.</p>
<p>So how would I use alpha-GPC?</p>
<p>I would use alpha-GPC by taking it about 10 to 20 minutes</p>
<p>prior to any time I want to focus</p>
<p>or concentrate very deeply.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken as much as 600 milligrams at one time,</p>
<p>although I find that 300 milligrams is enough for me</p>
<p>and I tend to be quite sensitive to supplements</p>
<p>and caffeine in general,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll sometimes take it alongside Yerba Mate</p>
<p>or with Yerba Mate or with coffee prior to a workout</p>
<p>or prior to a bout of work</p>
<p>in which I&rsquo;m focusing on mental work.</p>
<p>So it could be reading, writing,</p>
<p>could be math, could be data analysis,</p>
<p>could be anything where I need</p>
<p>a lot of focus and concentration.</p>
<p>Now, a number of people have contacted me</p>
<p>about a recent study suggesting that alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>when taken chronically over many years,</p>
<p>could increase one&rsquo;s vulnerability to stroke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at those data and my read of the data</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re not very conclusive,</p>
<p>although anytime you see something like that,</p>
<p>you know, a study that&rsquo;s pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that a given compound might increase</p>
<p>the propensity for stroke,</p>
<p>you obviously want to be concerned.</p>
<p>So we have to ask ourselves how,</p>
<p>by what mechanism that is,</p>
<p>could alpha-GPC be increasing the susceptibility to stroke?</p>
<p>And it seems to be related to increases in TMAO,</p>
<p>which is a marker related to the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>One known way to offset increases in TMAO</p>
<p>that are associated either with alpha-GPC</p>
<p>or increases due to other things,</p>
<p>so ingestion of particular food compounds</p>
<p>actually can increase TMAO,</p>
<p>is to offset that by taking 600 milligrams of garlic.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve been taking alpha-GPC pretty consistently</p>
<p>for a number of years.</p>
<p>I do not take it every day.</p>
<p>I would say I take it about four days per week,</p>
<p>again, prior to workouts or bouts of cognitive work.</p>
<p>I have not seen my TMAO spike,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve evaluated that by way of blood tests,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, I take 600 milligrams of garlic</p>
<p>in capsule form anytime I eat anyway,</p>
<p>and I do that for general cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some interesting data</p>
<p>on immune system function, et cetera, for garlic.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been consuming 600 milligram capsules of garlic</p>
<p>for some period of time.</p>
<p>Some days I&rsquo;ll ingest just one 600 milligram capsule,</p>
<p>other times I&rsquo;ll take two,</p>
<p>but based on this recent study</p>
<p>and the concerns about TMAO,</p>
<p>I make it a point to always ingest</p>
<p>a 600 milligram capsule of garlic</p>
<p>anytime I take alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>which again, for me, is about four days per week.</p>
<p>So in our model of attention and focus,</p>
<p>you can now clearly see why taking alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>which increases acetylcholine transmission,</p>
<p>would be beneficial for concentration and focus,</p>
<p>and why taking it with a double espresso</p>
<p>or why taking it with yerba mate</p>
<p>would further increase concentration and focus</p>
<p>because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>caffeine is going to increase epinephrine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also going to increase the density</p>
<p>of dopamine receptors,</p>
<p>and the alpha-GPC is going to increase acetylcholine,</p>
<p>this spotlighting for cognition,</p>
<p>this ability to really amplify the activity</p>
<p>of specific neural networks,</p>
<p>which is largely what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to focus</p>
<p>and pay attention to something specifically.</p>
<p>So if one wants to increase</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine transmission in the brain and body</p>
<p>for sake of increasing concentration and focus,</p>
<p>one of the most efficient ways to do that</p>
<p>is by ingestion of the amino acid L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>Again, L-tyrosine can be derived from food sources.</p>
<p>I invite you to look up those various food sources</p>
<p>on the web, simply go to a web browser</p>
<p>and put in foods that contain a lot of L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a rich array of choices to select from.</p>
<p>But in my case, I use L-tyrosine in capsule form.</p>
<p>I will take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>300 milligrams of alpha-GPC, and a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m careful to do this early in the day,</p>
<p>certainly not after two or 3 p.m.,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to diminish my ability</p>
<p>to fall and stay asleep that night.</p>
<p>Do this early in the day before a workout</p>
<p>or before a bout of concentrated mental work.</p>
<p>Again, I tend to do this about four days per week,</p>
<p>so certainly not every time I sit down to do work.</p>
<p>And I should also mention</p>
<p>that I still tend to do the behavioral tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tend to use five minutes of binaural beats</p>
<p>or binaural beats throughout the work session,</p>
<p>sometimes do an ice bath or a cold shower before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give the impression</p>
<p>that I combine every tool that I&rsquo;ve talked about today</p>
<p>for a given work bout.</p>
<p>I mean, that would be pretty wild too.</p>
<p>Take a cold shower, pop an L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>take an alpha-GPC, drink two espresso,</p>
<p>listen to binaural beats.</p>
<p>That, to me, seems like a very inefficient way</p>
<p>to go about life.</p>
<p>In fact, I make it a point to try and use tools</p>
<p>to increase my ability to concentrate and focus,</p>
<p>but not to combine more than two or three of them</p>
<p>at any one time.</p>
<p>And when I say two or three,</p>
<p>what I mean is I will use supplements like alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>L-tyrosine, and caffeine together before certain work bouts.</p>
<p>I might use the visual practice</p>
<p>of focusing on a given location for a minute</p>
<p>before I begin that work bout.</p>
<p>I might combine those.</p>
<p>Then another time,</p>
<p>I might take a cold shower prior to doing some work.</p>
<p>Other days, I confess, I&rsquo;ve slept very well,</p>
<p>or my enthusiasm about what I&rsquo;m about to work on</p>
<p>is such that I don&rsquo;t require any of these tools.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s no requirement.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pressure to use any of these tools,</p>
<p>behavioral, supplement-based, or otherwise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply a matter of using the tools</p>
<p>that are going to allow you to achieve the states</p>
<p>you want to achieve and to improve your ability</p>
<p>to go into those states without any help at all.</p>
<p>And this is what I find</p>
<p>particularly attractive about supplements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much that they put you</p>
<p>into the ideal state for that work,</p>
<p>and then you accomplish that work,</p>
<p>and then you always rely on those supplements.</p>
<p>I prefer to look at supplements of the sort</p>
<p>that I just described as a route</p>
<p>into a deeper trench of focus and concentration</p>
<p>that I use as a tool to teach myself</p>
<p>to focus and concentrate more deeply,</p>
<p>such that I don&rsquo;t need those tools every single time</p>
<p>I try and focus and concentrate.</p>
<p>I think this is an important point</p>
<p>because I think that many people think of supplements</p>
<p>as a crutch or a way of simply getting into a state</p>
<p>for which no other tool will suffice or replace.</p>
<p>But in that context,</p>
<p>I want to remind you of the larger context of pharmacology,</p>
<p>which is the vast landscape of prescription pharmacology</p>
<p>for ADHD, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
<p>Now, I covered that landscape in intense detail</p>
<p>on the episode on ADHD and focus.</p>
<p>And just to summarize, there is, of course,</p>
<p>Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, Modafinil, R-Modafinil,</p>
<p>a number of different compounds,</p>
<p>all of which generally increase</p>
<p>dopamine transmission in the brain, so increasing dopamine,</p>
<p>and all of which generally increase epinephrine,</p>
<p>adrenaline transmission in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And many of those compounds have been of tremendous benefit</p>
<p>to children and even some adults who suffer from ADHD.</p>
<p>So properly prescribed at the appropriate dosage,</p>
<p>those compounds can really help people</p>
<p>with clinically diagnosed ADHD.</p>
<p>The way they help those people is a bit surprising,</p>
<p>however.</p>
<p>You might think, well, they turn on the brain chemicals</p>
<p>that allow those people to concentrate and focus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but they also have the benefit</p>
<p>of teaching those brain circuits how to engage.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why somewhat paradoxically</p>
<p>giving a stimulant like Ritalin or Adderall</p>
<p>to a kid that legitimately needs it.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don&rsquo;t want to do this without the oversight</p>
<p>and careful evaluation of a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>but giving that to a kid who has severe ADHD,</p>
<p>you would think would make them more rambunctious,</p>
<p>less able to focus, and more distractible overall.</p>
<p>After all, Ritalin, modafinil, armodafinil,</p>
<p>all these things are stimulants.</p>
<p>So you take a kid who has attention deficit</p>
<p>hyperactivity disorder and give them these drugs</p>
<p>that increase transmission of dopamine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d think, wow, it&rsquo;s going to make them</p>
<p>even more distractible and hyperactive.</p>
<p>And indeed, it has the opposite effect.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make them feel calm,</p>
<p>but it makes them feel that they can focus.</p>
<p>They really can anchor their attention.</p>
<p>And the idea is that it&rsquo;s teaching those neural circuits,</p>
<p>or those neural circuits rather are teaching themselves</p>
<p>to engage and to focus and concentrate.</p>
<p>And the ideal situation is one in which the total dosage</p>
<p>of those compounds, those drugs can be reduced over time</p>
<p>as those circuits learn to come online</p>
<p>through purely behavioral tools.</p>
<p>Now, oftentimes there&rsquo;s a maintenance of those drugs</p>
<p>over long periods of time,</p>
<p>although there is a common practice nowadays</p>
<p>of trying to diminish the dosage overall.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the context of ADHD and prescription medication.</p>
<p>And I acknowledge that a lot, indeed,</p>
<p>80% or more of college students, say the statistics,</p>
<p>are using prescription drugs when they are not in fact</p>
<p>prescribed those prescription drugs.</p>
<p>So basically what I&rsquo;m saying is there are a lot of people</p>
<p>using drugs designed for ADHD and narcolepsy</p>
<p>because those drugs will effectively increase focus</p>
<p>and concentration, but I strongly discourage the use</p>
<p>of powerful prescription drugs</p>
<p>that have not been prescribed to you.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s illegal.</p>
<p>Second of all, it&rsquo;s quite dangerous to hit the accelerator</p>
<p>of those neural circuits with such vigor</p>
<p>because it can increase dependency</p>
<p>and they can have a number of other side effects</p>
<p>outside the context of clinically diagnosed</p>
<p>and prescribed ADHD medication.</p>
<p>But in the context of supplementation,</p>
<p>the increase in dopamine, acetylcholine, and epinephrine</p>
<p>that one can achieve from say 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>300 milligrams of alpha-GPC, and a cup of coffee</p>
<p>is going to be substantially less</p>
<p>than one would see for a prescription drug.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re getting a modest effect</p>
<p>that can similarly teach those brain circuits</p>
<p>for focus and concentration how to engage better.</p>
<p>But as a general backdrop to all of this,</p>
<p>I always say, and I&rsquo;ll say it again and again,</p>
<p>probably until the day I die,</p>
<p>which hopefully is a long time from now,</p>
<p>but regardless, it&rsquo;ll be the same message.</p>
<p>I always believe that behavioral tools should come first.</p>
<p>Behavioral tools should come first.</p>
<p>Then focus on nutrition.</p>
<p>In fact, I would say behavioral and nutrition tools,</p>
<p>and of course, get excellent sleep.</p>
<p>Then focus on supplementation.</p>
<p>And then, and only if those are failing</p>
<p>to bring your brain and body to the state you need to be in</p>
<p>to perform well in school and work and life, et cetera,</p>
<p>do I recommend that people lean on prescription drugs?</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a caveat to that,</p>
<p>which is under conditions like severe eating disorders,</p>
<p>obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, depression,</p>
<p>where people are truly at risk of suicide</p>
<p>or severe mental health effects or behavioral health effects</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really at, their lives are at risk</p>
<p>and their overall mood and wellbeing is at risk,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often the case that people cannot access</p>
<p>the brain states required to shift themselves</p>
<p>purely with behavioral tools, nutrition, et cetera.</p>
<p>So again, for the typical person who&rsquo;s not suffering</p>
<p>from one of the psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>that I mentioned before or other psychiatric disorders,</p>
<p>schizophrenia, et cetera,</p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to look to behavioral tools first,</p>
<p>nutrition, then supplementation,</p>
<p>then and only if there&rsquo;s a remaining need</p>
<p>to prescription drugs.</p>
<p>This contrasts very much with the typical scenario</p>
<p>I hear about these days where college students</p>
<p>or other people will say,</p>
<p>oh yeah, I hear that there&rsquo;s this drug,</p>
<p>Ritalin or Vyvanse that can immediately put me</p>
<p>into a state of heightened focus and concentration.</p>
<p>Now, listen, if you have ADHD, by all means,</p>
<p>talk to a physician, talk to a great psychiatrist</p>
<p>and figure out whether or not that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t, again, behavioral tools,</p>
<p>nutrition, supplementation,</p>
<p>and in particular, those behavioral tools</p>
<p>are going to be the ones that are going to allow you</p>
<p>to teach your neural circuits</p>
<p>how to focus and concentrate better.</p>
<p>And I cannot overstate the importance of that,</p>
<p>that the behavioral tools, and to some extent,</p>
<p>the supplementation combined with behavioral tools</p>
<p>really allow you to train up your neural circuits</p>
<p>so that you can focus and concentrate to the depth</p>
<p>and the degree and the duration</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to best serve your mental and physical goals.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s one other compound</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve used from time to time</p>
<p>and that I continue to use</p>
<p>in order to increase focus and concentration.</p>
<p>And I will use this in combination</p>
<p>with the other supplements I talked about before,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s phenylethylamine.</p>
<p>Phenylethylamine is in the dopamine synthesis pathway,</p>
<p>so it increases dopamine transmission</p>
<p>and tends to function a little bit differently</p>
<p>than L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>So every once in a while, I&rsquo;ll swap out L-tyrosine</p>
<p>and put in 500 milligrams of phenylethylamine,</p>
<p>or sometimes if I really want to push a little bit harder</p>
<p>on the dopamine system,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to be doing a long bout of intense work,</p>
<p>I will take the 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>the 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll generally take that with some caffeine.</p>
<p>And I should mention, I don&rsquo;t go past</p>
<p>about 100 or 200 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t really like feeling too jittery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really my goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the goal to be alert, but not so alert</p>
<p>that I really can&rsquo;t focus on anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in having an anxiety attack after all.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll sometimes either swap in</p>
<p>or I will add that 500 milligrams of phenylethylamine.</p>
<p>Phenylethylamine is in the PEA pathway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this in a previous podcast</p>
<p>on dopamine motivation and drive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very short-lived compound,</p>
<p>so what I&rsquo;ll tend to do is take it once</p>
<p>at the beginning of the work bout,</p>
<p>and sometimes in the middle of the work bout,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take another 500 milligram capsule.</p>
<p>But what I just described of combining</p>
<p>all of those compounds, alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>phenylethylamine, and caffeine,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fairly rare occurrence that I&rsquo;ll combine all four,</p>
<p>and really only under conditions in which I have to do</p>
<p>an intensely challenging bout of mental or physical work.</p>
<p>I would say the frequency at which I combine</p>
<p>all four of those things is probably about</p>
<p>once every two weeks, and typically more like once a month.</p>
<p>Again, being careful to do that</p>
<p>in the early part of the day,</p>
<p>certainly before the noon hour,</p>
<p>so that I am in no way going to disrupt my sleep.</p>
<p>I realize that many of you are probably wondering about</p>
<p>or hoping that I&rsquo;ll discuss things like lion&rsquo;s mane</p>
<p>or the racetams or some of the other compounds</p>
<p>that are known to powerfully modulate</p>
<p>the dopamine, epinephrine, and acetylcholine systems.</p>
<p>To be quite direct, there are far too many</p>
<p>of these compounds to review in a single episode,</p>
<p>and they all generally tap into the same set of processes.</p>
<p>Again, epinephrine, that shaft of the arrowhead</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re thinking of as focus,</p>
<p>acetylcholine, which is the arrowhead itself,</p>
<p>and then dopamine, which is the sort of propeller</p>
<p>behind the arrow that allows it to continually drive forward</p>
<p>through a bout of mental or physical work.</p>
<p>There is a wonderful site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned it several times before on this podcast.</p>
<p>That is examine.com.</p>
<p>That wonderful site that is examine.com</p>
<p>has recently been updated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve changed their format.</p>
<p>It was terrific before.</p>
<p>It provided links to relevant studies.</p>
<p>It talked about specific compounds.</p>
<p>It talked about the magnitude of effect.</p>
<p>It talked about the human effect matrix.</p>
<p>It really focused on human studies</p>
<p>with links to those studies and on and on.</p>
<p>The new revamped version of examine.com is even better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really next, next level.</p>
<p>I really applaud them for doing such a terrific job</p>
<p>in organizing the information.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting pages</p>
<p>that you can read there about different compounds.</p>
<p>So you can put in any compound, ginkgo biloba,</p>
<p>phosphatidylserine, alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to get a rich array of information</p>
<p>about those compounds.</p>
<p>And if you were to put in a specific goal state,</p>
<p>that is focus or concentration or sleep</p>
<p>or hormones like testosterone, et cetera,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get a rich array of compounds, supplements,</p>
<p>as well as links to the studies on those compounds</p>
<p>and some details about those particular studies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolutely phenomenal site.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that I rely on and that I know thousands,</p>
<p>if not millions of other people rely on.</p>
<p>And I encourage you to check it out.</p>
<p>Again, the URL is examine.com.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;ve talked about a number of different tools</p>
<p>and to some extent,</p>
<p>some mechanisms involved in concentration and focus.</p>
<p>And really the goal has been to provide you</p>
<p>an understanding of the neurochemical systems</p>
<p>and a little bit about the neural circuits</p>
<p>that can allow you to achieve states of attention and focus.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve covered these topics in tremendous depth</p>
<p>as it relates to mechanism and also focused on tools.</p>
<p>Today, I largely focused on tools.</p>
<p>We talked about behavioral tools like a meditation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 13 minutes long,</p>
<p>done daily specifically to improve your ability to focus.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are data to support that it will.</p>
<p>Talked about hypnosis.</p>
<p>We talked about visual focus, overt and covert.</p>
<p>We talked about various supplements,</p>
<p>such as alpha-GPC, phenolethylamine, L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>supplements that I use to directly modulate</p>
<p>the neural circuits for concentration and focus.</p>
<p>Also talked about creatine, the omega-3s.</p>
<p>Talked about the importance of sleep,</p>
<p>which modulates our ability to function mentally</p>
<p>and physically overall.</p>
<p>So optimize that sleep.</p>
<p>And we talked about a number of other protocols</p>
<p>that you can incorporate.</p>
<p>My hope in giving you all this information</p>
<p>in one single location is that you will be able to pick</p>
<p>and choose which of these protocols</p>
<p>you would like to incorporate into your attempts</p>
<p>to improve your focus and concentration.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t recommend doing all of these protocols</p>
<p>all at once.</p>
<p>What I recommend is picking a handful of them,</p>
<p>maybe one or two, maybe three or four,</p>
<p>and trying them in different combinations</p>
<p>at different times of day and for different purposes,</p>
<p>for mental work, for physical work, et cetera.</p>
<p>Find what is best for you.</p>
<p>Once again, the goal is to teach your brain,</p>
<p>that is to increase neuroplasticity in the neural circuits</p>
<p>that allow you not just to focus,</p>
<p>but to refocus your attention.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s also critical to be able to defocus.</p>
<p>I highly encourage people to take a period of time each day</p>
<p>to daydream, to walk down the hall</p>
<p>without looking at your phone,</p>
<p>to not have to incorporate more sensory information,</p>
<p>to not place increasing demands on yourself to focus,</p>
<p>and see and realize how having a period</p>
<p>of deliberate decompression and defocusing</p>
<p>can allow your brain to focus so much better</p>
<p>when you do decide to return to about</p>
<p>a focus-concentrated work or physical work.</p>
<p>So I want to thank you for joining me for this discussion</p>
<p>about tools for focus and concentration.</p>

<p>During today&rsquo;s episode and on many previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like sleep and enhancing focus</p>
<p>and hormone augmentation and so forth.</p>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered</p>
<p>with Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>because they are of the very highest quality,</p>
<p>they ship internationally,</p>
<p>and they have single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>in dosages that will allow you to construct the best,</p>
<p>most biologically and cost-effective</p>
<p>supplementation protocol for your needs.</p>

<p>and topics of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>much of which is unique from the contents,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s certainly the format covered</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on Instagram</p>

<p>that you can download as PDFs right away</p>
<p>without even having to sign up.</p>
<p>So thank you once again for joining me</p>
<p>for today&rsquo;s discussion all about the mechanisms</p>
<p>and especially the tools</p>
<p>for enhancing concentration and focus.</p>
