    <p>The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll, Part 2, the second time we&rsquo;ve spoken</p>
<p>on the podcast.</p>
<p>You can get the link to the first time in the description.</p>
<p>This time we focus on quantum mechanics and the many worlds interpretation that he details</p>
<p>elegantly in his new book titled Something Deeply Hidden.</p>
<p>I own and enjoy both the eBook and audiobook versions of it.</p>
<p>Listening to Sean read about entanglement, complementarity, and the emergence of space</p>
<p>time reminds me of Bob Ross teaching the world how to paint on his old television show.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know who Bob Ross is, you&rsquo;re truly missing out.</p>
<p>Look him up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll make you fall in love with painting.</p>
<p>Sean Carroll is the Bob Ross of theoretical physics.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of several popular books, a host of a great podcast called Mindscape,</p>
<p>and is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and the Santa Fe Institute, specializing in</p>
<p>quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>

<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Sean Carroll.</p>
<p>Isaac Newton developed what we now call classical mechanics that you describe very nicely in</p>
<p>your new book, as you do with a lot of basic concepts in physics.</p>
<p>So with classical mechanics, I can throw a rock and can predict the trajectory of that</p>
<p>rock&rsquo;s flight.</p>
<p>But if we could put ourselves back into Newton&rsquo;s time, his theories work to predict things,</p>
<p>but as I understand, he himself thought that they were, their interpretations of those</p>
<p>predictions were absurd.</p>
<p>Perhaps he just said it for religious reasons and so on, but in particular, sort of a world</p>
<p>of interaction without contact, so action at a distance.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t make sense to him on a sort of a human interpretation level.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to you that things can affect other things at a distance?</p>
<p>It does, but that was one of Newton&rsquo;s worries.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually right in a slightly different way about the religious worries.</p>
<p>He was smart enough, this is off the topic but still fascinating, Newton almost invented</p>
<p>chaos theory as soon as he invented classical mechanics.</p>
<p>He realized that in the solar system, so he was able to explain how planets move around</p>
<p>the Sun, but typically you would describe the orbit of the Earth ignoring the effects</p>
<p>of Jupiter and Saturn and so forth, just doing the Earth and the Sun.</p>
<p>He kind of knew, even though he couldn&rsquo;t do the math, that if you included the effects</p>
<p>of Jupiter and Saturn and the other planets, the solar system would be unstable, like the</p>
<p>orbits of the planets would get out of whack.</p>
<p>So he thought that God would intervene occasionally to sort of move the planets back into orbit,</p>
<p>which is the only way you could explain how they were there presumably forever.</p>
<p>But the worries about classical mechanics were a little bit different, the worry about</p>
<p>gravity in particular.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a worry about classical mechanics, it was a worry about gravity.</p>
<p>How in the world does the Earth know that there&rsquo;s something called the Sun, 93 million</p>
<p>miles away, that is exerting gravitational force on it?</p>
<p>And he literally said, you know, I leave that for future generations to think about because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is.</p>
<p>And in fact, people under emphasized this, but future generations figured it out.</p>
<p>Pierre Simone Laplace in circa 1800 showed that you could rewrite Newtonian gravity as</p>
<p>a field theory.</p>
<p>So instead of just talking about the force due to gravity, you can talk about the gravitational</p>
<p>field or the gravitational potential field, and then there&rsquo;s no action at a distance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly the same theory empirically, it makes exactly the same predictions.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s happening is instead of the Sun just reaching out across the void, there is</p>
<p>a gravitational field in between the Sun and the Earth that obeys an equation, Laplace&rsquo;s</p>
<p>equation, cleverly enough, and that tells us exactly what the field does.</p>
<p>So even in Newtonian gravity, you don&rsquo;t need action at a distance.</p>
<p>Now what many people say is that Einstein solved this problem because he invented general</p>
<p>relativity.</p>
<p>And in general relativity, there&rsquo;s certainly a field in between the Earth and the Sun.</p>
<p>But also there&rsquo;s the speed of light as a limit.</p>
<p>In Laplace&rsquo;s theory, which was exactly Newton&rsquo;s theory, just in a different mathematical language,</p>
<p>there could still be instantaneous action across the universe, whereas in general relativity,</p>
<p>if you shake something here, its gravitational impulse radiates out at the speed of light</p>
<p>and we call that a gravitational wave and we can detect those.</p>
<p>So but I really, it rubs me the wrong way to think that we should presume the answer</p>
<p>should look one way or the other.</p>
<p>Like if it turned out that there was action at a distance in physics and that was the</p>
<p>best way to describe things, then I would do it that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a very deep question because when we don&rsquo;t know what the right laws of</p>
<p>physics are, when we&rsquo;re guessing at them, when we&rsquo;re hypothesizing at what they might</p>
<p>be, we are often guided by our intuitions about what they should be.</p>
<p>I mean, Einstein famously was very guided by his intuitions and he did not like the</p>
<p>idea of action at a distance.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether he was right or not.</p>
<p>It depends on your interpretation of quantum mechanics and it depends on even how you talk</p>
<p>about quantum mechanics within any one interpretation.</p>
<p>So if you see every force as a field or any other interpretation of action at a distance,</p>
<p>just stepping back to sort of caveman thinking, like do you really, can you really sort of</p>
<p>understand what it means for a force to be a field that&rsquo;s everywhere?</p>
<p>So if you look at gravity, like what do you think about?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Is this something that you&rsquo;ve been conditioned by society to think that, to map the fact</p>
<p>that science is extremely well predictive of something to believing that you actually</p>
<p>understand it?</p>
<p>Like you can intuitively, the degree that human beings can understand anything that</p>
<p>you actually understand it.</p>
<p>Or are you just trusting the beauty and the power of the predictive power of science?</p>
<p>That depends on what you mean by this idea of truly understanding something, right?</p>
<p>You know, I mean, can I truly understand Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s easy to state it, but do I really appreciate what it means for incredibly</p>
<p>large numbers, right?</p>
<p>I think yes, I think I do understand it, but like if you want to just push people on well,</p>
<p>but your intuition doesn&rsquo;t go to the places where Andrew Wiles needed to go to prove Fermat&rsquo;s</p>
<p>last theorem, then I can say fine, but I still think I understand the theorem.</p>
<p>And likewise, I think that I do have a pretty good intuitive understanding of fields pervading</p>
<p>space time, whether it&rsquo;s the gravitational field or the electromagnetic field or whatever,</p>
<p>the Higgs field.</p>
<p>Of course, one&rsquo;s intuition gets worse and worse as you get trickier in the quantum field</p>
<p>theory and all sorts of new phenomena that come up in quantum field theory.</p>
<p>So our intuitions aren&rsquo;t perfect, but I think it&rsquo;s also okay to say that our intuitions</p>
<p>get trained, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, I have different intuitions now than I had when I was a baby.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, an intuition is not necessarily intrinsic to who we are.</p>
<p>We can train it a little bit.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going to bring in Noam Chomsky for a second, who thinks that our</p>
<p>cognitive abilities are sort of evolved through time, and so they&rsquo;re biologically constrained.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a clear limit, as he puts it, to our cognitive abilities, and it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>harsh limit.</p>
<p>But you actually kind of said something interesting in nature versus nurture thing here, is we</p>
<p>can train our intuitions to sort of build up the cognitive muscles to be able to understand</p>
<p>some of these tricky concepts.</p>
<p>So do you think there&rsquo;s limits to our understanding that&rsquo;s deeply rooted, hardcoded into our biology</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t overcome?</p>
<p>There could be limits to things like our ability to visualize, okay?</p>
<p>But when someone like Ed Witten proves a theorem about, you know, 100 dimensional mathematical</p>
<p>spaces, he&rsquo;s not visualizing it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing the math.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t stop him from understanding the result.</p>
<p>I think, and I would love to understand this better, but my rough feeling, which is not</p>
<p>very educated, is that, you know, there&rsquo;s some threshold that one crosses in abstraction</p>
<p>when one becomes kind of like a Turing machine, right?</p>
<p>One has the ability to contain in one&rsquo;s brain logical, formal, symbolic structures and manipulate</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a leap that we can make as human beings that dogs and cats haven&rsquo;t made.</p>
<p>And once you get there, I&rsquo;m not sure that there are any limits to our ability to understand</p>
<p>the scientific world at all.</p>
<p>Maybe there are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly limits in our ability to calculate things, right?</p>
<p>You know, people are not very good at taking cube roots of million digit numbers in their</p>
<p>head.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not an element of understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not a limit in principle.</p>
<p>So of course, as a human, you would say there doesn&rsquo;t feel to be limits to our understanding.</p>
<p>But sort of, have you thought that the universe is actually a lot simpler than it appears</p>
<p>to us?</p>
<p>And we just will never be able to, like, it&rsquo;s outside of our, okay.</p>
<p>So us, our cognitive abilities combined with our mathematical prowess and whatever kind</p>
<p>of experimental simulation devices we can put together, is there limits to that?</p>
<p>Is it possible there&rsquo;s limits to that?</p>
<p>Well, of course it&rsquo;s possible that there are limits to that.</p>
<p>Is there any good reason to think that we&rsquo;re anywhere close to the limits is a harder question.</p>
<p>Look, imagine asking this question 500 years ago to the world&rsquo;s greatest thinkers, right?</p>
<p>Like are we approaching the limits of our ability to understand the natural world?</p>
<p>And by definition, there are questions about the natural world that are most interesting</p>
<p>to us that are the ones we don&rsquo;t quite yet understand, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always, we&rsquo;re always faced with these puzzles we don&rsquo;t yet know.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what they would have said 500 years ago, but they didn&rsquo;t even know about</p>
<p>classical mechanics, much less quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So we know that they were nowhere close to how well they could do, right?</p>
<p>They could do enormously better than they were doing at the time.</p>
<p>I see no reason why the same thing isn&rsquo;t true for us today.</p>
<p>So of all the worries that keep me awake at night, the human mind&rsquo;s inability to rationally</p>
<p>comprehend the world is low on the list.</p>
<p>Well put.</p>
<p>So one interesting philosophical point that quantum mechanics bring up is the, that you</p>
<p>talk about the distinction between the world as it is and the world as we observe it.</p>
<p>So staying at the human level for a second, how big is the gap between what our perception</p>
<p>system allows us to see and the world as it is outside our mind&rsquo;s eye sort of, sort of</p>
<p>not at the quantum mechanical level, but as just our, these particular tools we have,</p>
<p>which is the few senses and cognitive abilities to process those senses.</p>
<p>Well, that last phrase, having the cognitive abilities to process them carries a lot, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there is our sort of intuitive understanding of the world.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to teach people about gravity for them to know that apples fall from trees,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that we figure out pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Project permanence, things like that, the three dimensionality of space, even if we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the mathematical language to say that, we kind of know that it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no one opens their eyes and sees atoms, right?</p>
<p>Or molecules or cells for that matter, forget about quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So but we got there, we got to understanding that there are atoms and cells using the combination</p>
<p>of our senses and our cognitive capacities.</p>
<p>So adding the ability of our cognitive capacities to our senses is adding an enormous amount</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it is a hard and fast boundary.</p>
<p>You know, if you believe in cells, if you believe that we understand those, then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no reason you believe we can&rsquo;t believe in quantum mechanics just as well.</p>
<p>What to you is the most beautiful idea in physics?</p>
<p>Conservation of momentum.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you were Aristotle, when Aristotle wrote his book on physics, he made the following</p>
<p>very obvious point.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on video here, right?</p>
<p>So people can see this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if I push the bottle, let me cover this bottle so we do not have a mess, but okay.</p>
<p>So I push the bottle, it moves, and if I stop pushing, it stops moving.</p>
<p>And this kind of thing is repeated a large number of times all over the place.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t keep pushing things, they stop moving.</p>
<p>This is an indisputably true fact about our everyday environment, okay?</p>
<p>And for Aristotle, this blew up into a whole picture of the world in which things had natures</p>
<p>and teleologies, and they had places they wanted to be, and when you were pushing them,</p>
<p>you were moving them away from where they wanted to be, and they would return and stuff</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>And it took a thousand years or 1500 years for people to say, actually, if it weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>for things like dissipation and air resistance and friction and so forth, the natural thing</p>
<p>is for things to move forever in a straight line, there&rsquo;s a constant velocity, right?</p>
<p>Conservation of momentum.</p>
<p>And the reason why I think that&rsquo;s the most beautiful idea in physics is because it shifts</p>
<p>us from a view of natures and teleology to a view of patterns in the world.</p>
<p>So when you were Aristotle, you needed to talk a vocabulary of why is this happening,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the purpose of it, what&rsquo;s the cause, etc., because, you know, it&rsquo;s nature does</p>
<p>or does not want to do that, whereas once you believe in conservation of momentum, things</p>
<p>just happen.</p>
<p>They just follow the pattern.</p>
<p>You give me, you have Laplace&rsquo;s demon, ultimately, right?</p>
<p>You give me the state of the world today, I can predict what it&rsquo;s going to do in the</p>
<p>future, I can predict where it was in the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impersonal, and it&rsquo;s also instantaneous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not directed toward any future goals, it&rsquo;s just doing what it does given the current</p>
<p>state of the universe.</p>
<p>I think even more than either classical mechanics or quantum mechanics, that is the profound</p>
<p>deep insight that gets modern science off the ground.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need natures and purposes and goals, you just need some patterns.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the first moment in our understanding of the way the universe works where you branch</p>
<p>from the intuitive physical space to kind of the space of ideas.</p>
<p>And also the other point you said, which is, conveniently, most of the interesting ideas</p>
<p>are acting in the moment.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know the history of time or the future.</p>
<p>And of course, this took a long time to get there, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the conservation of momentum itself took hundreds of years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, because like, someone would say something interesting, and then the next interesting</p>
<p>thing would be said like 150 or 200 years later, right?</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t even talking to each other, they were reading each other&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>And probably the first person to directly say that in outer space, in the vacuum, a</p>
<p>projectile would move at a constant velocity was Avicenna, Ibn Sina in the Persian Golden</p>
<p>Age, circa 1000.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t like the idea.</p>
<p>He used that, just like Schrodinger used Schrodinger&rsquo;s cat to say, surely you don&rsquo;t believe that,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Ibn Sina was saying, surely you don&rsquo;t believe there really is a vacuum, because if there</p>
<p>was a really vacuum, things could keep moving forever, right?</p>
<p>But still, he got right the idea that there was this conservation of something impetus</p>
<p>or mile, he would call it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s 500 years, 600 years before classical mechanics and Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>So Galileo played a big role in this, but he didn&rsquo;t exactly get it right.</p>
<p>And so it just takes a long time for this to sink in, because it is so against our everyday</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p>Do you think it was a big leap, a brave or a difficult leap of sort of math and science</p>
<p>to be able to say that momentum is conserved?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s an example of human reason in action.</p>
<p>You know, even Aristotle knew that his theory had issues, because you could fire an arrow</p>
<p>and it would go a long way before it stopped.</p>
<p>So if his theory was things just automatically stop, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>And he had this elaborate story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard the story, but the arrow would push the air in front of it</p>
<p>away and the molecules of air would run around to the back of the arrow and push it again.</p>
<p>And anyone reading this is going like, really, that&rsquo;s what you thought?</p>
<p>But it was that kind of thought experiment that ultimately got people to say like, actually,</p>
<p>no, if it weren&rsquo;t for the air molecules at all, the arrow would just go on by itself.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always this give and take between thought and experience, back and forth, right?</p>
<p>Theory and experiment, we would say today.</p>
<p>Another big question that I think comes up, certainly with quantum mechanics, is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the difference between math and physics to you?</p>
<p>To me, you know, very, very roughly, math is about the logical structure of all possible</p>
<p>worlds and physics is about our actual world.</p>
<p>And it just feels like our actual world is a gray area when you start talking about interpretations</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics, or no?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly using the word world in the broadest sense, all of reality.</p>
<p>So I think that reality is specific.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s every possible thing going on in reality.</p>
<p>I think that there are rules, whether it&rsquo;s the Schrodinger equation or whatever.</p>
<p>So I think that there&rsquo;s a sensible notion of the set of all possible worlds and we live</p>
<p>in one of them.</p>
<p>The world that we&rsquo;re talking about might be a multiverse, might be many worlds of quantum</p>
<p>mechanics, might be much bigger than the world of our everyday experience, but it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>one physically contiguous world in some sense.</p>
<p>But so if you look at the overlap of math and physics, it feels like when physics tries</p>
<p>to reach for understanding of our world, it uses the tools of math to sort of reach beyond</p>
<p>the limit of our current understanding.</p>
<p>What do you make of that process of sort of using math to, so you start maybe with intuition</p>
<p>or you might start with the math and then build up an intuition or, but this kind of</p>
<p>reaching into the darkness, into the mystery of the world with math.</p>
<p>Well, I think I would put it a little bit differently.</p>
<p>I think we have theories, theories of the physical world, which we then extrapolate</p>
<p>and ask, you know, what do we conclude if we take these seriously well beyond where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve actually tested them?</p>
<p>It is separately true that math is really, really useful when we construct physical theories</p>
<p>and you know, famously Eugene Wigner asked about the unreasonable success of mathematics</p>
<p>and physics.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a little bit wrong because anything that could happen, any other theory</p>
<p>of physics that wasn&rsquo;t the real world, but some other world, you could always describe</p>
<p>it mathematically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that it might be a mess.</p>
<p>The surprising thing is not that math works, but that the math is so simple and easy that</p>
<p>you can write it down on a t shirt, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what is amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an enormous compression of information that seems to be valid in the real world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting fact about our world, which maybe we could hope to explain or just</p>
<p>take as a brute fact.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But once you have that, you know, there&rsquo;s this indelible relationship between math and</p>
<p>physics, but philosophically I do want to separate them.</p>
<p>What we extrapolate, we don&rsquo;t extrapolate math because there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of wrong</p>
<p>math, you know, that doesn&rsquo;t apply to our world, right?</p>
<p>We extrapolate the physical theory that we best think explains our world.</p>
<p>Again, an unanswerable question.</p>
<p>Why do you think our world is so easily compressible into beautiful equations?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, like I just hinted at, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s an answer to that question.</p>
<p>There could be.</p>
<p>What would an answer look like?</p>
<p>Well, an answer could look like if you showed that there was something about our world that</p>
<p>maximizes something.</p>
<p>You know, the mean of the simplicity and the powerfulness of the laws of physics or, you</p>
<p>know, maybe we&rsquo;re just generic.</p>
<p>Maybe in the set of all possible worlds, this is what the world would look like, right?</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>I tend to think not.</p>
<p>I tend to think that there is something specific and rock bottom about the facts of our world</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have further explanation.</p>
<p>Like the fact of the world exists at all.</p>
<p>And furthermore, the specific laws of physics that we have.</p>
<p>I think that in some sense, we&rsquo;re just going to, at some level, we&rsquo;re going to say, and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it is.</p>
<p>And, you know, we can&rsquo;t explain anything more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how, if we&rsquo;re anywhere close to that right now, but that seems plausible</p>
<p>to me.</p>
<p>And speaking of rock bottom, one of the things sort of your book kind of reminded me or revealed</p>
<p>to me is that what&rsquo;s fundamental and what&rsquo;s emergent, it just feels like I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know anymore what&rsquo;s fundamental in physics, if there&rsquo;s anything.</p>
<p>It feels like everything, especially with quantum mechanics, is revealing to us is that</p>
<p>most interesting things that I would, as a limited human would think are fundamental</p>
<p>can actually be explained as emergent from the more deeper laws.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t know, of course.</p>
<p>You had to get that on the table.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what is fundamental.</p>
<p>We do have reasons to say that certain things are more fundamental than others, right?</p>
<p>Atoms and molecules are more fundamental than cells and organs.</p>
<p>Quantum fields are more fundamental than atoms and molecules.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if that ever bottoms out.</p>
<p>I do think that there&rsquo;s sensible ways to think about this.</p>
<p>If you describe something like this table as a table, it has a height and a width and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made of a certain material and it has a certain solidity and weight and so forth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very useful description as far as it goes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole other description of this table in terms of a whole collection of atoms</p>
<p>strung together in certain ways.</p>
<p>The language of the atoms is more comprehensive than the language of the table.</p>
<p>You could break apart the table, smash it to pieces, still talk about it as atoms, but</p>
<p>you could no longer talk about it as a table, right?</p>
<p>So I think that this comprehensiveness, the domain of validity of a theory gets broader</p>
<p>and broader as the theory gets more and more fundamental.</p>
<p>So what do you think Newton would say?</p>
<p>Maybe right in the book review, if you read your latest book on quantum mechanics, something</p>
<p>deeply hidden.</p>
<p>It would take a long time for him to think that any of this was making any sense.</p>
<p>You catch him up pretty quick in the beginning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You give him a shout out in the beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>He is the man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to say that Newton was the greatest scientist who ever lived.</p>
<p>He invented calculus in his spare time, which would have made him the greatest mathematician</p>
<p>just all by himself, all by that one thing.</p>
<p>But of course, it&rsquo;s funny because Newton was in some sense still a pre modern thinker.</p>
<p>Rocky Kolb, who is a cosmologist at the University of Chicago said that Galileo, even though</p>
<p>he came before Newton, was a more modern thinker than Newton was.</p>
<p>If you got Galileo and brought him to the present day, it would take him six months</p>
<p>to catch up and then he&rsquo;d be in your office telling you why your most recent paper was</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>Whereas Newton just thought in this kind of more mystical way.</p>
<p>He wrote a lot more about the Bible and alchemy than he ever did about physics, but he was</p>
<p>also more brilliant than anybody else and way more mathematically astute than Galileo.</p>
<p>So I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He might have, he might just, yeah, say like, give me the textbooks, leave me alone for</p>
<p>a few months and then be caught up.</p>
<p>But he might have had mental blocks against seeing the world in this way.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Or perhaps find an interesting mystical interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Very possible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there any other scientists or philosophers through history that you would like to know</p>
<p>their opinion of your book?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I mean, Einstein is the obvious one, right?</p>
<p>We all, I mean, he was not that long ago, but I even speculated at the end of my book</p>
<p>about what his opinion would be.</p>
<p>I am curious as to, you know, what about older philosophers like Hume or Kant, right?</p>
<p>Like what would they have thought?</p>
<p>Or Aristotle, you know, what would they have thought about modern physics?</p>
<p>Because they do in philosophy, your predilections end up playing a much bigger role in your</p>
<p>ultimate conclusions because you&rsquo;re not as tied down by what the data is in physics.</p>
<p>You know, physics is lucky because we can&rsquo;t stray too far off the reservation as long</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re trying to explain the world that we actually see in our telescopes and microscopes.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just not fair to play that game because the people we&rsquo;re thinking about didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>a whole bunch of things that we know, right?</p>
<p>Like we lived through a lot that they didn&rsquo;t live through.</p>
<p>So by the time we got them caught up, they&rsquo;d be different people.</p>
<p>So let me ask a bunch of basic questions.</p>
<p>I think it would be interesting, useful for people who are not familiar, but even for</p>
<p>people who are extremely well familiar.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what is quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is the paradigm of physics that came into being in the early part of</p>
<p>the 20th century that replaced classical mechanics, and it replaced classical mechanics in a weird</p>
<p>way that we&rsquo;re still coming to terms with.</p>
<p>So in classical mechanics, you have an object, it has a location, it has a velocity, and</p>
<p>if you know the location and velocity of everything in the world, you can say what everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to do.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics has an aspect of it that is kind of on the same lines.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called the quantum state or the wave function.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an equation governing what the quantum state does.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very much like classical mechanics.</p>
<p>The wave function is different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of a wave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vector in a huge dimensional vector space rather than a position and a velocity,</p>
<p>but okay, that&rsquo;s a detail.</p>
<p>The equation is the Schrodinger equation, not Newton&rsquo;s laws, but okay, again, a detail.</p>
<p>Where quantum mechanics really becomes weird and different is that there&rsquo;s a whole other</p>
<p>set of rules in our textbook formulation of quantum mechanics in addition to saying that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a quantum state and it evolves in time.</p>
<p>And all these new rules have to do with what happens when you look at the system, when</p>
<p>you observe it, when you measure it.</p>
<p>In classical mechanics, there were no rules about observing.</p>
<p>You just look at it and you see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>That was it, right?</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, the way we teach it, there&rsquo;s something profoundly fundamental about</p>
<p>the act of measurement or observation, and the system dramatically changes its state.</p>
<p>Even though it has a wave function, like the electron in an atom is not orbiting in a circle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of spread out in a cloud, when you look at it, you don&rsquo;t see that cloud.</p>
<p>When you look at it, it looks like a particle with a location.</p>
<p>So it dramatically changes its state right away, and the effects of that change can be</p>
<p>instantly seen in what the electron does next.</p>
<p>So again, we need to be careful because we don&rsquo;t agree on what quantum mechanics says.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I need to say like in the textbook view, et cetera, right?</p>
<p>But in the textbook view, quantum mechanics, unlike any other theory of physics, gives</p>
<p>a fundamental role to the act of measurement.</p>
<p>So maybe even more basic, what is an atom and what is an electron?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>This all came together in a few years around the turn of the last century, right?</p>
<p>Around the year 1900.</p>
<p>Atoms predated then, of course, the word atom goes back to the ancient Greeks, but it was</p>
<p>the chemists in the 1800s that really first got experimental evidence for atoms.</p>
<p>They realized that there were two different types of tin oxide.</p>
<p>And in these two different types of tin oxide, there was exactly twice as much oxygen in</p>
<p>one type as the other.</p>
<p>And like, why is that?</p>
<p>Why is it never 1.5 times as much, right?</p>
<p>And so Dalton said, well, it&rsquo;s because there are tin atoms and oxygen atoms, and one form</p>
<p>of tin oxide is one atom of tin and one atom of oxygen, and the other is one atom of tin</p>
<p>and two atoms of oxygen.</p>
<p>And on the basis of this, you know, a speculation, a theory, right, a hypothesis, but then on</p>
<p>the basis of that, you make other predictions, and the chemists became quickly convinced</p>
<p>that atoms were real.</p>
<p>The physicists took a lot longer to catch on, but eventually they did.</p>
<p>And I mean, Boltzmann, who believed in atoms, had a really tough time his whole life because</p>
<p>he worked in Germany where atoms were not popular.</p>
<p>They were popular in England, but not in Germany.</p>
<p>And there, in general, the idea of atoms is, it&rsquo;s the most, the smallest building block</p>
<p>of the universe for them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of how they thought it was.</p>
<p>That was the Greek idea, but the chemists in the 1800s jumped the gun a little bit.</p>
<p>So these days, an atom is the smallest building block of a chemical element, right?</p>
<p>Hydrogen, tin, oxygen, carbon, whatever, but we know that atoms can be broken up further</p>
<p>than that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what physicists discovered in the early 1900s, Rutherford, especially, and his colleagues.</p>
<p>So the atom that we think about now, the cartoon, is that picture you&rsquo;ve always seen of a little</p>
<p>nucleus and then electrons orbiting it like a little solar system.</p>
<p>And we now know the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>So the weight of the atom, the mass, is almost all in its nucleus.</p>
<p>Protons and neutrons are something like 1800 times as heavy as electrons are.</p>
<p>Protons are much lighter, but because they&rsquo;re lighter, they give all the life to the atoms.</p>
<p>So when atoms get together, combine chemically, when electricity flows through a system, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all the electrons that are doing all the work.</p>
<p>And where quantum mechanics steps in, as you mentioned, with the position of velocity with</p>
<p>classical mechanics and quantum mechanics is modeling the behavior of the electron.</p>
<p>I mean, you can model the behavior of anything, but the electron, because that&rsquo;s where the</p>
<p>fun is.</p>
<p>The electron was the biggest challenge right from the start.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a wave function?</p>
<p>You said it&rsquo;s an interesting detail, but in any interpretation, what is the wave function</p>
<p>in quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>Well, you know, we had this idea from Rutherford that atoms look like little solar systems,</p>
<p>but people very quickly realize that can&rsquo;t possibly be right because if an electron is</p>
<p>orbiting in a circle, it will give off light.</p>
<p>All the light that we have in this room comes from electrons zooming up and down and wiggling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what electromagnetic waves are.</p>
<p>And you can calculate how long would it take for the electron just to spiral into the nucleus?</p>
<p>And the answer is 10 to the minus 11 seconds, okay, 100 billionth of a second.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people had realized that light, which we understood from the 1800s was a wave,</p>
<p>had properties that were similar to that of particles, right?</p>
<p>This is Einstein and Planck and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So if something that we agree was a wave had particle like properties, then maybe something</p>
<p>we think is a particle, the electron has wave like properties, right?</p>
<p>And so a bunch of people eventually came to the conclusion, don&rsquo;t think about the electron</p>
<p>as a little point particle orbiting like a solar system.</p>
<p>Think of it as a wave that is spread out.</p>
<p>They cleverly gave this the name the wave function, which is the dopiest name in the</p>
<p>world for one of the most profound things in the universe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally a number at every point in space, which is the value of the electron&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wave function at that point.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only one wave function.</p>
<p>Yeah, they eventually figured that out.</p>
<p>That took longer.</p>
<p>But when you have two electrons, you do not have a wave function for electron one and</p>
<p>a wave function for electron two.</p>
<p>You have one combined wave function for both of them.</p>
<p>And indeed, as you say, there&rsquo;s only one wave function for the entire universe at once.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where this beautiful dance, can you say what is entanglement?</p>
<p>It seems one of the most fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s temporarily buy into the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And what that says is that this wave function, so it&rsquo;s very small outside the atom, very</p>
<p>big in the atom, basically the wave function, you take it and you square it, you square</p>
<p>the number that gives you the probability of observing the system at that location.</p>
<p>So if you say that for two electrons, there&rsquo;s only one wave function, and that wave function</p>
<p>gives you the probability of observing both electrons at once doing something, okay?</p>
<p>So maybe the electron can be here or here, here, here, and the other electron can also</p>
<p>be there.</p>
<p>But we have a wave function set up where we don&rsquo;t know where either electron is going</p>
<p>to be seen.</p>
<p>But we know they&rsquo;ll both be seen in the same place, okay?</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know exactly what we&rsquo;re going to see for either electron, but there&rsquo;s entanglement</p>
<p>between the two of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sort of conditional statement.</p>
<p>If we see one in one location, then we know the other one&rsquo;s going to be doing a certain</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a feature of quantum mechanics that is nowhere to be found in classical mechanics.</p>
<p>In classical mechanics, there&rsquo;s no way I can say, well, I don&rsquo;t know where either one of</p>
<p>these particles is, but if I know, if I find out where this one is, then I know where the</p>
<p>other one is.</p>
<p>That just never happens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re truly separate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it feels like, if you think of a wave function like as a dance floor,</p>
<p>it seems like entanglement is strongest between things that are dancing together closest.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a closeness that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s another step.</p>
<p>We have to be careful here because in principle, if you&rsquo;re talking about the entanglement of</p>
<p>two electrons, for example, they can be totally entangled or totally unentangled no matter</p>
<p>where they are in the universe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no relationship between the amount of entanglement and the distance between two</p>
<p>electrons.</p>
<p>But we now know that the reality of our best way of understanding the world is through</p>
<p>quantum fields, not through particles.</p>
<p>So even the electron, not just gravity and electromagnetism, but even the electron and</p>
<p>the quarks and so forth are really vibrations in quantum fields.</p>
<p>So even empty space is full of vibrating quantum fields.</p>
<p>And those quantum fields in empty space are entangled with each other in exactly the way</p>
<p>you just said.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re nearby, if you have like two vibrating quantum fields that are nearby, then they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be highly entangled.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re far away, they will not be entangled.</p>
<p>So what do quantum fields in a vacuum look like?</p>
<p>Empty space?</p>
<p>Just like empty space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as empty as it can be.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still a field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, what does nothing look like?</p>
<p>Just like right here, this location in space, there&rsquo;s a gravitational field, which I can</p>
<p>detect by dropping something.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it, but there it is.</p>
<p>So we got a little bit of an idea of entanglement.</p>
<p>Now, what is Hilbert space and Euclidean space?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, I think that people are very welcome to go through their lives not knowing</p>
<p>what Hilbert space is.</p>
<p>But if you dig into a little bit more into quantum mechanics, it becomes necessary.</p>
<p>You know, the English language was invented long before quantum mechanics, or various</p>
<p>forms of higher mathematics were invented.</p>
<p>So we use the word space to mean different things.</p>
<p>Of course, most of us think of space as this three dimensional world in which we live,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>I mean, some of us just think of it as outer space.</p>
<p>Okay, but space around us gives us the three dimensional location of things and objects.</p>
<p>But mathematicians use any generic abstract collection of elements as a space, okay?</p>
<p>A space of possibilities, you know, momentum space, etc.</p>
<p>So Hilbert space is the space of all possible quantum wave functions, either for the universe</p>
<p>or for some specific system.</p>
<p>And it could be an infinite dimensional space, or it could be just really, really large dimensional</p>
<p>but finite.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know because we don&rsquo;t know the final theory of everything.</p>
<p>But this abstract Hilbert space is really, really, really big and has no immediate connection</p>
<p>to the three dimensional space in which we live.</p>
<p>What do dimensions in Hilbert space mean?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just a way of mathematically representing how much information is contained</p>
<p>in the state of the system.</p>
<p>How many numbers do you have to give me to specify what the thing is doing?</p>
<p>So in classical mechanics, I give you the location of something by giving you three</p>
<p>numbers, right?</p>
<p>Up, down, left, X, Y, Z coordinates.</p>
<p>But then I might want to give you its entire state, physical state, which means both its</p>
<p>position and also its velocity.</p>
<p>The velocity also has three components.</p>
<p>So its state lives in something called phase space, which is six dimensional, three dimensions</p>
<p>of position, three dimensions of velocity.</p>
<p>And then if it also has an orientation in space, that&rsquo;s another three dimensions and</p>
<p>so forth.</p>
<p>So as you describe more and more information about the system, you have an abstract mathematical</p>
<p>space that has more and more numbers that you need to give.</p>
<p>And each one of those numbers corresponds to a dimension in that space.</p>
<p>So in terms of the amount of information, what is entropy?</p>
<p>This mystical word that&rsquo;s overused in math and physics, but has a very specific meaning</p>
<p>in this context.</p>
<p>Sadly, it has more than one very specific meeting.</p>
<p>This is the reason why it is hard.</p>
<p>Entropy means different things even to different physicists.</p>
<p>But one way of thinking about it is a measure of how much we don&rsquo;t know about the state</p>
<p>of a system.</p>
<p>So if I have a bottle of water molecules, and I know that, OK, there&rsquo;s a certain number</p>
<p>of water molecules.</p>
<p>I could weigh it and figure out.</p>
<p>I know the volume of it, and I know the temperature and pressure and things like that.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t know the exact position and velocity of every water molecule.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain amount of information I know, a certain amount that I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that is part of the complete state of the system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the entropy characterizes, how much unknown information there is, the</p>
<p>difference between what I do know about the system and its full exact microscopic state.</p>
<p>So when we try to describe a quantum mechanical system, is it infinite or finite but very</p>
<p>large?</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That depends on the system.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s easy to mathematically write down a system that would have a potentially</p>
<p>infinite entropy, an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go back a little bit.</p>
<p>We said that the Hilbert space was the space in which quantum wave functions lived for</p>
<p>different systems that will be different sizes.</p>
<p>They could be infinite or finite.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the number of numbers, the number of pieces of information you could potentially</p>
<p>give me about the system.</p>
<p>So the bigger Hilbert space is, the bigger the entropy of that system could be, depending</p>
<p>on what I know about it.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t know anything about it, then it has a huge entropy, right, but only up to</p>
<p>the size of its Hilbert space.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know in the real physical world whether or not, you know, this region of space</p>
<p>that contains that water bottle has potentially an infinite entropy or just a finite entropy.</p>
<p>We have different arguments on different sides.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s infinite, how do you think about infinity?</p>
<p>Is this something you can, your cognitive abilities are able to process or is it just</p>
<p>a mathematical tool?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhere in between, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we can say things about it.</p>
<p>We can use mathematical tools to manipulate infinity very, very accurately.</p>
<p>We can define what we mean.</p>
<p>You know, for any number n, there&rsquo;s a number bigger than it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no biggest number, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something called the total number of all numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s infinite.</p>
<p>But it is hard to wrap your brain around that, and I think that gives people pause because</p>
<p>we talk about infinity as if it&rsquo;s a number, but it has plenty of properties that real</p>
<p>numbers don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>You know, if you multiply infinity by two, you get infinity again, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit different than what we&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But are you comfortable with the idea that in thinking of what the real world actually</p>
<p>is that infinity could be part of that world?</p>
<p>Are you comfortable that a world in some dimension, in some aspect?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m comfortable with lots of things.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I don&rsquo;t want my level of comfort to affect what I think about the world.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m pretty open minded about what the world could be at the fundamental level.</p>
<p>Yeah, but infinity is a tricky one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not almost a question of comfort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question of, is it an overreach of our intuition?</p>
<p>Sort of, it could be a convenient, almost like when you add a constant to an equation</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;ll help, it just feels like it&rsquo;s useful to at least be able to imagine</p>
<p>a concept, not directly, but in some kind of way that this feels like it&rsquo;s a description</p>
<p>of the real world.</p>
<p>Think of it this way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only three numbers that are simple.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s zero, there&rsquo;s one, and there&rsquo;s infinity.</p>
<p>A number like 318 is just bizarre.</p>
<p>You need a lot of bits to give me what that number is.</p>
<p>But zero and one and infinity, like once you have 300 things, you might as well have infinity</p>
<p>things, right?</p>
<p>Otherwise, you have to say when to stop making the things, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense in which infinity is a very natural number of things to exist.</p>
<p>I was never comfortable with infinity because it&rsquo;s just such a, it was too good to be true.</p>
<p>Because in math, it just helps make things work out.</p>
<p>When things get very large, close to infinity, things seem to work out nicely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like, because my deepest passion is probably psychology.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m uncomfortable how in the average, the beauty of how much we vary is lost.</p>
<p>In that same kind of sense, infinity seems like a convenient way to erase the details.</p>
<p>But the thing about infinity is it seems to pop up whether we like it or not, right?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re trying to be a computer scientist, you ask yourself, well, how long will it take</p>
<p>this program to run?</p>
<p>And you realize, well, for some of them, the answer is infinitely long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because you tried to get there.</p>
<p>You wrote a five line computer program, it doesn&rsquo;t halt.</p>
<p>So coming back to the textbook definition of quantum mechanics, this idea that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we talked about, can you, this one of the most interesting philosophical points,</p>
<p>we talked at the human level, but at the physics level, that at least the textbook definition</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics separates what is observed and what is real.</p>
<p>One, how does that make you feel?</p>
<p>And two, what does it then mean to observe something and why is it different than what</p>
<p>is real?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, my personal feeling, such as it is, is that things like measurement</p>
<p>and observers and stuff like that are not going to play a fundamental role in the ultimate</p>
<p>laws of physics.</p>
<p>But my feeling that way is because so far, that&rsquo;s where all the evidence has been pointing.</p>
<p>I could be wrong.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certainly a sense in which it would be infinitely cool if somehow observation</p>
<p>or mental cogitation did play a fundamental role in the nature of reality.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t see any evidence for it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not spending a lot of time worrying about that possibility.</p>
<p>So what do you do about the fact that in the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>this idea of measurement or looking at things seems to play an important role?</p>
<p>Well, you come up with better interpretations of quantum mechanics and there are several</p>
<p>alternatives.</p>
<p>My favorite is the many worlds interpretation, which says two things.</p>
<p>Number one, you, the observer, are just a quantum system like anything else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing special about you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get so proud of yourself, you know, you&rsquo;re just a bunch of atoms.</p>
<p>You have a wave function, you obey the Schrodinger equation like everything else.</p>
<p>And number two, when you think you&rsquo;re measuring something or observing something, what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>happening is you&rsquo;re becoming entangled with that thing.</p>
<p>So when you think there&rsquo;s a wave function for the electron, it&rsquo;s all spread out.</p>
<p>But you look at it and you only see it in one location.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really happening is that there&rsquo;s still the wave function for the electron in all</p>
<p>those locations.</p>
<p>But now it&rsquo;s entangled with the wave function of you in the following way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s part of the wave function that says the electron was here and you think you saw</p>
<p>it there.</p>
<p>The electron was there and you think you saw it there.</p>
<p>The electron was over there and you think you saw it there, etc.</p>
<p>So in all of those different parts of the wave function, once they come into being,</p>
<p>no longer talk to each other.</p>
<p>They no longer interact or influence each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if they are separate worlds.</p>
<p>So this was the invention of Hugh Everett III, who was a graduate student at Princeton</p>
<p>in the 1950s.</p>
<p>And he said, basically, look, you don&rsquo;t need all these extra rules about looking at things.</p>
<p>Just listen to what the Schrodinger equation is telling you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling you that you have a wave function, that you become entangled, and that the different</p>
<p>versions of you no longer talk to each other.</p>
<p>So just accept it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just he did therapy more than anything else.</p>
<p>He said, like, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need all these extra rules.</p>
<p>All you need to do is believe the Schrodinger equation.</p>
<p>The cost is there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of extra worlds out there.</p>
<p>So are the worlds being created whether there&rsquo;s an observer or not?</p>
<p>The worlds are created any time a quantum system that&rsquo;s in a superposition becomes entangled</p>
<p>with the outside world.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the outside world?</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s back up.</p>
<p>Whatever it really says, what his theory is, is there&rsquo;s a wave function of the universe</p>
<p>and it obeys the Schrodinger equation all the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the full theory right there.</p>
<p>The question, all of the work is how in the world do you map that theory onto reality,</p>
<p>onto what we observe?</p>
<p>So part of it is carving up the wave function into these separate worlds, saying, look,</p>
<p>it describes a whole bunch of things that don&rsquo;t interact with each other.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call them separate worlds.</p>
<p>Another part is distinguishing between systems and their environments.</p>
<p>The environment is basically all the degrees of freedom, all the things going on in the</p>
<p>world that you don&rsquo;t keep track of.</p>
<p>So again, in the bottle of water, I might keep track of the total amount of water and</p>
<p>the volume.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t keep track of the individual positions and velocities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t keep track of all the photons or the air molecules in this room.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the outside world.</p>
<p>The outside world is all the parts of the universe that you&rsquo;re not keeping track of</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re asking about the behavior of subsystem of it.</p>
<p>So how many worlds are there?</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t know that one either.</p>
<p>There could be an infinite number.</p>
<p>There could be only a finite number, but it&rsquo;s a big number one way or the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a very, very big number.</p>
<p>In one of the talks, somebody asked, well, if it&rsquo;s finite.</p>
<p>So actually I&rsquo;m not sure exactly the logic you used to derive this, but is there going</p>
<p>to be overlap, a duplicate world that you return to?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned, and I&rsquo;d love if you can elaborate on sort of idea that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some kind of equilibrium that these splitting worlds arrive at and then</p>
<p>maybe over time, maybe somehow connected to entropy, you get a large number of worlds</p>
<p>that are very similar to each other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this question of whether or not Hilbert space is finite or infinite dimensional is</p>
<p>actually secretly connected to gravity and cosmology.</p>
<p>This is the part that we&rsquo;re still struggling to understand right now, but we discovered</p>
<p>back in 1998 that our universe is accelerating and what that means if it continues, which</p>
<p>we think it probably will, but we&rsquo;re not sure.</p>
<p>But if it does, that means there&rsquo;s a horizon around us.</p>
<p>Because the universe is not only expanding, but expanding faster and faster, things can</p>
<p>get so far away from us that from our perspective, it looks like they&rsquo;re moving away faster in</p>
<p>the speed of light.</p>
<p>We will never see them again.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s literally a horizon around us and that horizon approaches some fixed distance</p>
<p>away from us.</p>
<p>And you can then argue that within that horizon, there&rsquo;s only a finite number of things that</p>
<p>can possibly happen, the finite dimensional Hilbert space.</p>
<p>In fact, we even have a guess for what the dimensionality is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 122.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very large number.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Just to compare, the age of the universe is something like 10 to the 14 seconds, 10 to</p>
<p>the 17 or 18 seconds maybe.</p>
<p>The number of particles in the universe is 10 to the 88th.</p>
<p>But the number of dimensions of Hilbert space is 10 to the 10 to the 122.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just crazy big.</p>
<p>If that story is right, that in our observable horizon, there&rsquo;s only a finite dimensional</p>
<p>Hilbert space, then this idea of branching of the wave function of the universe into</p>
<p>multiple distinct separate branches has to reach a limit at some time.</p>
<p>Once you branch that many times, you&rsquo;ve run out of room in Hilbert space.</p>
<p>And roughly speaking, that corresponds to the universe just expanding and emptying out</p>
<p>and cooling off and entering a phase where it&rsquo;s just empty space, literally forever.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between splitting and copying, do you think?</p>
<p>In terms of, a lot of this is an interpretation that helps us sort of model the world.</p>
<p>So perhaps shouldn&rsquo;t be thought of as like, you know, philosophically or metaphysically.</p>
<p>But in even at the physics level, do you see a difference between generating new copies</p>
<p>of the world or splitting?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s better to think of in quantum mechanics in many worlds, the universe splits</p>
<p>rather than new copies, because people otherwise worry about things like energy conservation.</p>
<p>And no one who understands quantum mechanics worries about energy conservation, because</p>
<p>the equation is perfectly clear.</p>
<p>But if all you know is that someone told you the universe duplicates, then you have a reasonable</p>
<p>worry about where all the energy for that came from.</p>
<p>So a pre existing universe splitting into two skinnier universes is a better way of</p>
<p>thinking about it.</p>
<p>And mathematically, it&rsquo;s just like, you know, if you draw an x and y axis, and you draw</p>
<p>a vector of length one, 45 degree angle, you know that you can write that vector of length</p>
<p>one as the sum of two vectors pointing along x and y of length one over the square root</p>
<p>of two.</p>
<p>Okay, so I write one arrow as the sum of two arrows.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a conservation of arrowness, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s now two arrows, but the length is the same, I just I&rsquo;m describing it in a</p>
<p>different way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what happens when the universe branches, the the wave function of the universe</p>
<p>is a big old vector.</p>
<p>So to somebody who brings up a question of saying, doesn&rsquo;t this violate the conservation</p>
<p>of energy?</p>
<p>Can you give further elaboration?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just be super duper perfectly clear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s zero question about whether or not many worlds violates conservation of energy.</p>
<p>Yes, it does not.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And I say this definitively, because there are other questions that I think there&rsquo;s answers</p>
<p>to, but they&rsquo;re legitimate questions, right about, you know, where does probability come</p>
<p>from and things like that, this conservation of energy question, we know the answer to</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And the answer to it is that energy is conserved.</p>
<p>All of the effort goes into how best to translate what the equation unambiguously says into</p>
<p>plain English, right?</p>
<p>So this idea that there&rsquo;s a universe that has that that the universe comes equipped</p>
<p>with a thickness, and it sort of divides up into thinner pieces, but the total amount</p>
<p>of universe is is conserved over time, is a reasonably good way of putting English words</p>
<p>to the underlying mathematics.</p>
<p>So one of my favorite things about many worlds is, I mean, I love that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>controversial in science.</p>
<p>And for some reason, it makes people actually not like upset, but just get excited.</p>
<p>Why do you think it is a controversial idea?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of, it&rsquo;s actually one of the cleanest ways to think about quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So why do you think there&rsquo;s a discomfort a little bit among certain people?</p>
<p>Well, I draw the distinction in my book between two different kinds of simplicity in a physical</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simplicity in the theory itself, right?</p>
<p>How we describe what&rsquo;s going on according to the theory by its own rights.</p>
<p>But then, you know, theory is just some sort of abstract mathematical formalism, you have</p>
<p>to map it onto the world somehow, right?</p>
<p>And sometimes, like for Newtonian physics, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious, like, okay, here is a</p>
<p>bottle and has a center of mass and things like that.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a little bit harder with general relativity, curvature of space time is a little</p>
<p>bit harder to grasp.</p>
<p>quantum mechanics is very hard to map what you&rsquo;re the language you&rsquo;re talking in a wave</p>
<p>functions and things like that on to reality.</p>
<p>And many worlds is the version of quantum mechanics where it is hardest to map on the</p>
<p>underlying formalism to reality.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the lack of simplicity comes in, not in the theory, but in how we use the</p>
<p>theory to map on to reality.</p>
<p>In fact, all of the work in sort of elaborating many worlds quantum mechanics is in the this</p>
<p>effort to map it on to the world that we see.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s perfectly legitimate to be bugged by that, right?</p>
<p>To say like, well, no, that&rsquo;s just too far away from my experience, I am therefore intrinsically</p>
<p>skeptical of it.</p>
<p>Of course, you should give up on that skepticism if there are no alternatives.</p>
<p>And this theory always keeps working, then eventually you should overcome your skepticism.</p>
<p>But right now there are alternatives that are that, you know, people work to make alternatives</p>
<p>that are by their nature closer to what we observe directly.</p>
<p>Can you describe the alternatives?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we touched on it, sort of the Copenhagen interpretation and the many worlds.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a difference between the Everettian many worlds and many worlds as it is now,</p>
<p>like has the idea sort of developed and so on.</p>
<p>And just in general, what is the space of promising contenders?</p>
<p>We have democratic debates now, there&rsquo;s a bunch of candidates.</p>
<p>12 candidates on stage.</p>
<p>What are the quantum mechanical candidates on stage for the debate?</p>
<p>So if you had a debate between quantum mechanical contenders, there&rsquo;d be no problem getting</p>
<p>12 people up there on stage, but there would still be only three front runners.</p>
<p>And right now the front runners would be Everett, hidden variable theories are another one.</p>
<p>So the hidden variable theories say that the wave function is real, but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>in addition to the wave function.</p>
<p>The wave function is not everything, it&rsquo;s part of reality, but it&rsquo;s not everything.</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not sure, but in the simplest version of the theory, there are literally particles.</p>
<p>So many worlds says that quantum systems are sometimes are wave like in some ways and particle</p>
<p>like in another because they really, really are waves, but under certain observational</p>
<p>circumstances they look like particles.</p>
<p>Whereas hidden variable says they look like waves and particles because there are both</p>
<p>waves and particles involved in the dynamics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s easy to do if your particles are just non relativistic Newtonian particles</p>
<p>moving around.</p>
<p>They get pushed around by the wave function roughly.</p>
<p>It becomes much harder when you take quantum field theory or quantum gravity into account.</p>
<p>The other big contender are spontaneous collapse theories.</p>
<p>So in the conventional textbook interpretation, we say when you look at a quantum system,</p>
<p>its wave function collapses and you see it in one location, a spontaneous collapse theory</p>
<p>says that every particle has a chance per second of having its wave function spontaneously</p>
<p>collapse.</p>
<p>The chance is very small for a typical particle, it will take hundreds of millions of years</p>
<p>before it happens even once, but in a table or some macroscopic object, there are way</p>
<p>more than a hundred million particles and they&rsquo;re all entangled with each other.</p>
<p>So when one of them collapses, it brings everything else along with it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a slight variation of this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a spontaneous collapse theory.</p>
<p>There are also induced collapse theories like Roger Penrose thinks that when the gravitational</p>
<p>difference between two parts of the wave function becomes too large, the wave function collapses</p>
<p>automatically.</p>
<p>So those are basically in my mind, the three big alternatives, many worlds, which is just</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wave function and always obeys the Schrodinger equation, hidden variables.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wave function that always obeys the Schrodinger equation, but there are also</p>
<p>new variables or collapse theories, which the wave function sometimes obeys the Schrodinger</p>
<p>equation and sometimes it collapses.</p>
<p>So you can see that the alternatives are more complicated in their formalism than many worlds</p>
<p>is, but they are closer to our experience.</p>
<p>So just this moment of collapse, do you think of it as a wave function, fundamentally sort</p>
<p>of a probabilistic description of the world and this collapse sort of reducing that part</p>
<p>of the world into something deterministic, where again, you can now describe the position</p>
<p>and the velocity in this simple classical model?</p>
<p>Well there is&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that how you think about collapse?</p>
<p>There is a fourth category, there&rsquo;s a fourth contender, there&rsquo;s a mayor Pete of quantum</p>
<p>mechanical interpretations, which are called epistemic interpretations.</p>
<p>And what they say is all the wave function is, is a way of making predictions for experimental</p>
<p>outcomes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not mapping onto an element of reality in any real sense.</p>
<p>And in fact, two different people might have two different wave functions for the same</p>
<p>physical system because they know different things about it, right?</p>
<p>The wave function is really just a prediction mechanism.</p>
<p>And then the problem with those epistemic interpretations is if you say, okay, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>predicting about what, like what is the thing that is being predicted?</p>
<p>And they say, no, no, no, that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re here for.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just here to tell you what the observational outcomes are going to be.</p>
<p>But the other, the other interpretations kind of think that the wave function is real.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an ontic interpretation of the wave function, ontology being the study of what</p>
<p>is real, what exists, as opposed to an epistemic interpretation of the wave function, epistemology</p>
<p>being the study of what we know.</p>
<p>That would actually just love to see that debate on stage.</p>
<p>There was a version of it on stage at the world science festival a few years ago that</p>
<p>you can look up online.</p>
<p>On YouTube?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on YouTube.</p>
<p>Okay, awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll link it and watch it.</p>
<p>Who won?</p>
<p>I won.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there was no vote, there was no vote, but those there&rsquo;s Brian Green was</p>
<p>the moderator and David Albert stood up for a spontaneous collapse and Shelley Goldstein</p>
<p>was there for hidden variables and R√ºdiger Schock was there for epistemic approaches.</p>
<p>Why do you, I think you mentioned it, but just to elaborate, why do you find many worlds</p>
<p>so compelling?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s two reasons actually.</p>
<p>One is, like I said, it is the simplest, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the most bare bones, austere, pure version of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And I am someone who is very willing to put a lot of work into mapping the formalism onto</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m less willing to complicate the formalism itself.</p>
<p>But the other big reason is that there&rsquo;s something called modern physics with quantum fields</p>
<p>and quantum gravity and holography and space time doing things like that.</p>
<p>And when you take any of the other versions of quantum theory, they bring along classical</p>
<p>baggage, all of the other versions of quantum mechanics, prejudice or privilege some version</p>
<p>of classical reality like locations in space, okay?</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a barrier to doing better at understanding the theory of everything</p>
<p>and understanding quantum gravity and the emergence of space time.</p>
<p>Whenever if you change your theory from, you know, here&rsquo;s a harmonic oscillator, oh, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a spin, here&rsquo;s an electromagnetic field, in hidden variable theories or dynamical collapse</p>
<p>theories.</p>
<p>You have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>You have to say like, well, what are the hidden variables for this theory or how does it collapse</p>
<p>or whatever?</p>
<p>Whereas many worlds is plug and play.</p>
<p>You tell me the theory and I can give you as many worlds version.</p>
<p>So when we have a situation like we have with gravity and space time, where the classical</p>
<p>description seems to break down in a dramatic way, then I think you should start from the</p>
<p>most quantum theory that you have, which is really many worlds.</p>
<p>So start with the quantum theory and try to build up a model of space time, the emergence</p>
<p>of space time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I thought space time was fundamental.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>So this sort of dream that Einstein had that everybody had and everybody has of, you know,</p>
<p>the theory of everything.</p>
<p>So how do we build up from many worlds from quantum mechanics, a model of space time model</p>
<p>of gravity?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, let me first mention very quickly why we think it&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve had gravity in the form that Einstein bequeathed it to us for over a hundred</p>
<p>years now, like 1915 or 1916, he put general relativity in the final form.</p>
<p>So gravity is the curvature of space time and there&rsquo;s a field that pervades all the</p>
<p>universe that tells us how curved space time is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fundamentally classical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s totally classical.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But we also have a formalism, an algorithm for taking a classical theory and quantizing</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>This is how we get quantum electrodynamics, for example.</p>
<p>And it could be tricky.</p>
<p>I mean, you think you&rsquo;re quantizing something, so that means taking a classical theory and</p>
<p>promoting it to a quantum mechanical theory.</p>
<p>But you can run into problems.</p>
<p>So they ran into problems and they did that with electromagnetism, namely that certain</p>
<p>quantities were infinity and you don&rsquo;t like infinity, right?</p>
<p>So Feynman and Tominaga and Schwinger won the Nobel Prize for teaching us how to deal</p>
<p>with the infinities.</p>
<p>And then Ken Wilson won another Nobel Prize for saying you shouldn&rsquo;t have been worried</p>
<p>about those infinities after all.</p>
<p>But still, that was the, it&rsquo;s always the thought that that&rsquo;s how you will make a good quantum</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start with a classical theory and quantize it.</p>
<p>So if we have a classical theory, general relativity, we can quantize it or we can try</p>
<p>to, but we run into even bigger problems with gravity than we ran into with electromagnetism.</p>
<p>And so far, those problems are insurmountable.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve not been able to get a successful theory of gravity, quantum gravity, by starting with</p>
<p>classical general relativity and quantizing it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s evidence that, there&rsquo;s a good reason why this is true, that whatever the</p>
<p>quantum theory of gravity is, it&rsquo;s not a field theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that has weird nonlocal features built into it somehow that we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>We get this idea from black holes and Hawking radiation and information conservation and</p>
<p>a whole bunch of other ideas I talk about in the book.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s true, if the fundamental theory isn&rsquo;t even local in the sense that an ordinary</p>
<p>quantum field theory would be, then we just don&rsquo;t know where to start in terms of getting</p>
<p>a classical precursor and quantizing it.</p>
<p>So the only sensible thing, or at least the next obvious sensible thing to me would be</p>
<p>to say, okay, let&rsquo;s just start intrinsically quantum and work backwards, see if we can</p>
<p>find a classical limit.</p>
<p>So the idea of locality, the fact that locality is not fundamental to the nature of our existence,</p>
<p>I guess in that sense, modeling everything as a field makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Stuff that&rsquo;s close by interacts, stuff that&rsquo;s far away doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s locality and why is it not fundamental?</p>
<p>And how is that even possible?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, locality is the answer to the question that Isaac Newton was worried about back in</p>
<p>the beginning of our conversation, right?</p>
<p>I mean, how can the earth know what the gravitational field of the sun is?</p>
<p>And the answer as spelled out by Laplace and Einstein and others is that there&rsquo;s a field</p>
<p>in between.</p>
<p>And the way a field works is that what&rsquo;s happening to the field at this point in space only depends</p>
<p>directly on what&rsquo;s happening at points right next to it.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s happening at those points depends on what&rsquo;s happening right next to those, right?</p>
<p>And so you can build up an influence across space through only local interactions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what locality means.</p>
<p>What happens here is only affected by what&rsquo;s happening right next to it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s locality.</p>
<p>The idea of locality is built into every field theory, including general relativity as a</p>
<p>classical theory.</p>
<p>It seems to break down when we talk about black holes and, you know, Hawking taught</p>
<p>us in the 1970s that black holes radiate, they give off, they eventually evaporate away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not completely black once we take quantum mechanics into account.</p>
<p>And we think, we don&rsquo;t know for sure, but most of us think that if you make a black</p>
<p>hole out of certain stuff, then like Laplace&rsquo;s demon taught us, you should be able to predict</p>
<p>what that black hole will turn into if it&rsquo;s just obeying the Schrodinger equation.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s true, there are good arguments that can&rsquo;t happen while preserving locality</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the information seems to be spread out nonlocally in interesting ways.</p>
<p>And people should, you talk about holography with the Leonard Susskind on your Mindscape</p>
<p>podcast.</p>
<p>Oh yes, I have a podcast.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even mention that.</p>
<p>This is terrible.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m going to, I&rsquo;m going to ask you questions about that too, and I&rsquo;ve been not shutting</p>
<p>up about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite science podcast.</p>
<p>So, or not, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s not even a science podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a scientist doing a podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So holography is this idea when you have a black hole and black hole is a region of space</p>
<p>inside of which gravity is so strong that you can&rsquo;t escape.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this weird feature of black holes that, again, it&rsquo;s totally a thought experiment</p>
<p>feature because we haven&rsquo;t gone and probed any yet.</p>
<p>But there seems to be one way of thinking about what happens inside a black hole as</p>
<p>seen by an observer who&rsquo;s falling in, which is actually pretty normal.</p>
<p>Like everything looks pretty normal until you hit the singularity and you die.</p>
<p>But from the point of view of the outside observer, it seems like all the information</p>
<p>that fell in is actually smeared over the horizon in a nonlocal way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s puzzling and that&rsquo;s, so holography because that&rsquo;s a two dimensional surface that</p>
<p>is encapsulating the whole three dimensional thing inside, right?</p>
<p>Still trying to deal with that.</p>
<p>Still trying to figure out how to get there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an indication that we need to think a little bit more subtly when we quantize</p>
<p>gravity.</p>
<p>And because you can describe everything that&rsquo;s going on in the three dimensional space by</p>
<p>looking at the two dimensional projection of it, it means that locality doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not necessary.</p>
<p>Well, it means that somehow it&rsquo;s only a good approximation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to feel about that?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to feel liberated.</p>
<p>You know, space is just a good approximation and this was always going to be true once</p>
<p>you started quantizing gravity.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just beginning now to face up to the dramatic implications of quantizing gravity.</p>
<p>Is there other weird stuff that happens to quantum mechanics in black hole?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that anything weird has happened with quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>I think weird things happen with space time.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Like quantum mechanics is still just quantum mechanics, but our ordinary notions of space</p>
<p>time don&rsquo;t really quite work.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a principle that goes hand in hand with holography called complementarity,</p>
<p>which says that there&rsquo;s no one unique way to describe what&rsquo;s going on inside a black</p>
<p>hole.</p>
<p>Different observers will have different descriptions, both of which are accurate, but sound completely</p>
<p>incompatible with each other.</p>
<p>So depends on how you look at it.</p>
<p>The word complementarity in this context is borrowed from Niels Bohr, who points out you</p>
<p>can measure the position or you can measure the momentum.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t measure both at the same time in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So a couple of questions on many worlds.</p>
<p>How does many worlds help us understand our particular branch of reality?</p>
<p>So okay, that&rsquo;s fine and good that is everything is splitting, but we&rsquo;re just traveling down</p>
<p>a single branch of it.</p>
<p>So how does it help us understand our little unique branch?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the point is that we didn&rsquo;t invent many worlds because we thought it was cool</p>
<p>to have a whole bunch of worlds, right?</p>
<p>We invented it because we were trying to account for what we observe here in our world.</p>
<p>And what we observe here in our world are wave functions collapsing, okay?</p>
<p>We do have a position, a situation where the electron seems to be spread out.</p>
<p>But then when we look at it, we don&rsquo;t see it spread out.</p>
<p>We see it located somewhere.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the measurement problem of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we have to face up to.</p>
<p>So many worlds is just a proposed solution to that problem.</p>
<p>And the answer is nothing special is happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still just the Schrodinger equation, but you have a wave function too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a different answer than would be given in hidden variables or dynamical collapse</p>
<p>theories or whatever.</p>
<p>So the entire point of many worlds is to explain what we observe, but it tries to explain what</p>
<p>we already have observed, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not trying to be different from what we&rsquo;ve observed because that would be something</p>
<p>other than quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>But you know, the idea that there&rsquo;s worlds that we didn&rsquo;t observe that keep branching</p>
<p>off is kind of, it&rsquo;s stimulating to the imagination.</p>
<p>So is it possible to hop from, you mentioned the branches are independent.</p>
<p>Is it possible to hop from one to the other?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a physical limit.</p>
<p>The theory says it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s already a copy of you in the other world, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Leave them alone.</p>
<p>No, but there&rsquo;s a fear of missing out, FOMO, that I feel like immediately start to wonder</p>
<p>if that other copy is having more or less fun.</p>
<p>Well, the downside to many worlds is that you&rsquo;re missing out on an enormous amount.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always what it&rsquo;s going to be like.</p>
<p>And I mean, there&rsquo;s a certain stage of acceptance in that.</p>
<p>In terms of rewinding, do you think we can rewind the system back, sort of the nice thing</p>
<p>about many worlds, I guess, is it really emphasizes the, maybe you can correct me, but the deterministic</p>
<p>nature of a branch and it feels like it could be rewound back.</p>
<p>Is it, do you see it as something that could be perfectly rewound back, rewinding back?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at a fancy French restaurant and there&rsquo;s a nice linen white tablecloth and</p>
<p>you have your glass of Bordeaux and you knock it over and the wine spills across the tablecloth.</p>
<p>If the world were classical, okay, it would be possible that if you just lifted the wine</p>
<p>glass up, you&rsquo;d be lucky enough that every molecule of wine would hop back into the glass,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen in the real world.</p>
<p>And the quantum wave function is exactly the same way.</p>
<p>It is possible in principle to rewind everything if you start from perfect knowledge of the</p>
<p>entire wave function of the universe.</p>
<p>In practice, it&rsquo;s never going to happen.</p>
<p>So time travel, not possible.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>At least quantum mechanics has no help.</p>
<p>What about memory?</p>
<p>Does the universe have a memory of itself where we could, in, in, so not time travel,</p>
<p>but peek back in time and do a little like replay?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s exactly the same in quantum mechanics as classical mechanics.</p>
<p>So whatever you want to say about that, you know, the fundamental laws of physics in either</p>
<p>many worlds, quantum mechanics or Newtonian physics conserve information.</p>
<p>So if you have all the information about the quantum state of the world right now, your</p>
<p>Laplace is demon like in your knowledge and calculational capacity, you can wind the clock</p>
<p>backward.</p>
<p>But none of us is.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And, you know, so in practice you can never do that.</p>
<p>You can do experiments over and over again, starting from the same initial conditions</p>
<p>for small systems.</p>
<p>But once things get to be large, Avogadro&rsquo;s number of particles, right?</p>
<p>Bigger than a cell, no chance.</p>
<p>We we&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about arrow of time last time, but in many worlds that there</p>
<p>is a kind of implied arrow of time, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about the arrow of time that has to do with the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the arrow of time that&rsquo;s emergent or fundamental.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, I guess.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s emergent.</p>
<p>Is that, does everyone agree on that?</p>
<p>Well, nobody agrees with everything.</p>
<p>They should.</p>
<p>So that arrow of time, is that different than the arrow of time that&rsquo;s implied by many worlds?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not different, actually, no.</p>
<p>In both cases, you have fundamental laws of physics that are completely reversible.</p>
<p>If you give me the state of the universe at one moment in time, I can run the clock forward</p>
<p>or backward equally well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no arrow of time built into the laws of physics at the most fundamental level.</p>
<p>But what we do have are special initial conditions 14 billion years ago near the Big Bang.</p>
<p>In thermodynamics, those special initial conditions take the form of things were low entropy and</p>
<p>entropy has been increasing ever since, making the universe more disorganized and chaotic</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the arrow of time.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, the special initial conditions take the form of there was only</p>
<p>one branch of the wave function and the universe has been branching more and more ever since.</p>
<p>Okay, so if time is emergent, so it seems like our human cognitive capacity likes to</p>
<p>take things that are emergent and assume and feel like they&rsquo;re fundamental.</p>
<p>So what, so if time is emergent and locality, like is space emergent?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t say time was emergent, I said the arrow of time was emergent.</p>
<p>Those are different.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between the arrow of time and time?</p>
<p>Are you using arrow of time to simply mean this, they&rsquo;re synonymous with the second law</p>
<p>of thermodynamics?</p>
<p>No, but the arrow of time is the difference between the past and future.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s space, but there&rsquo;s no arrow of space.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t feel that space has to have an arrow, right?</p>
<p>You could live in thermodynamic equilibrium, there&rsquo;d be no arrow of time, but there&rsquo;d still</p>
<p>be time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d still be a difference between now and the future or whatever.</p>
<p>So if nothing changes, there&rsquo;s still time.</p>
<p>Well things could even change, like if the whole universe consisted of the earth going</p>
<p>around the sun, it would just go in circles or ellipses, right?</p>
<p>Things would change, but it&rsquo;s not increasing entropy, there&rsquo;s no arrow.</p>
<p>If you took a movie of that and I played you the movie backward, you would never know.</p>
<p>So the arrow of time can theoretically point in the other direction for briefly.</p>
<p>To the extent that it points in different directions, it&rsquo;s not a very good arrow.</p>
<p>I mean, the arrow of time in the macroscopic world is so powerful that there&rsquo;s just no</p>
<p>chance of going back.</p>
<p>When you get down to tiny systems with only three or four moving parts, then entropy can</p>
<p>fluctuate up and down.</p>
<p>What does it mean for space to be an emergent phenomenon?</p>
<p>It means that the fundamental description of the world does not include the word space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be something like a vector in Hilbert space, right, and you have to say, well why</p>
<p>is there a good approximate description which involves three dimensional space and stuff</p>
<p>inside it?</p>
<p>Okay, so time and space are emergent.</p>
<p>We kind of mentioned in the beginning, can you elaborate, what do you feel hope is fundamental</p>
<p>in our universe?</p>
<p>A wave function living in Hilbert space.</p>
<p>A wave function in Hilbert space that we can&rsquo;t intellectualize or visualize really.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t visualize it, we can intellectualize it very easily.</p>
<p>Like how do you think about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vector in a 10 to the 10 to the 122 dimensional vector space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex vector, unit norm, it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>When you put it that way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so hard, really?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yep, quantum computers, there&rsquo;s some excitement, actually a lot of excitement</p>
<p>with people that it will allow us to simulate quantum mechanical systems.</p>
<p>What kind of questions do you about quantum mechanics, about the things we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about, do you think, do you hope we can answer through quantum simulation?</p>
<p>Well I think that there are, there&rsquo;s a whole fascinating frontier of things you can do</p>
<p>with quantum computers.</p>
<p>Both sort of practical things with cryptography or money, privacy eavesdropping, sorting things,</p>
<p>simulating quantum systems, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a broader question maybe even outside of quantum computers.</p>
<p>Some of the theories that we&rsquo;ve been talking about, what&rsquo;s your hope, what&rsquo;s most promising</p>
<p>to test these theories?</p>
<p>What are kind of experiments we can conduct, whether in simulation or in the physical world</p>
<p>that would validate or disprove or expand these theories?</p>
<p>Well I think for, there&rsquo;s two parts of that question.</p>
<p>One is many worlds and the other one is sort of emergent space time.</p>
<p>For many worlds, you know, there are experiments ongoing to test whether or not wave functions</p>
<p>spontaneously collapse.</p>
<p>And if they do, then that rules out many worlds and that would be falsified.</p>
<p>If there are hidden variables, there&rsquo;s a theorem that seems to indicate that the predictions</p>
<p>will always be the same as many worlds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little skeptical of this theorem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not complete.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t internalized it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t made it in part of my intuitive view of the world yet, so there might be loopholes</p>
<p>to that theorem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about that.</p>
<p>Part of me thinks that there should be different experimental predictions if there are hidden</p>
<p>variables, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>But otherwise, it&rsquo;s just quantum mechanics all the way down.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this cottage industry in science journalism of writing breathless articles</p>
<p>that say, you know, quantum mechanics shown to be more astonishing than ever before thought.</p>
<p>And really, it&rsquo;s the same quantum mechanics we&rsquo;ve been doing since 1926.</p>
<p>Whereas with the emergent space time stuff, we know a lot less about what the theory is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a very primitive state.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even really have a safely written down, respectable, honest theory yet.</p>
<p>So there could very well be experimental predictions we just don&rsquo;t know about yet.</p>
<p>That is one of the things that we&rsquo;re trying to figure out.</p>
<p>Yeah, for emergent space time, you need really big stuff, right?</p>
<p>Well, or really fast stuff, or really energetic stuff.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>You know, so there could be violations of the speed of light if you have emergent space</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Not going faster than the speed of light, but the speed of light could be different</p>
<p>for light of different wavelengths, right?</p>
<p>That would be a dramatic violation of physics as we know it, but it could be possible.</p>
<p>Or not.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not an absolute prediction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>The theories are just not well developed enough yet to say.</p>
<p>Is there anything that quantum mechanics can teach us about human nature or the human mind?</p>
<p>If you think about sort of consciousness and these kinds of topics, is there&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly excessively used, as you point out.</p>
<p>The word quantum is used for everything besides quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>But in more seriousness, is there something that goes to the human level and can help</p>
<p>us understand our mind?</p>
<p>Not really is the short answer, you know.</p>
<p>Minds are pretty classical.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know this for sure, but I don&rsquo;t think that phenomena like entanglement are crucial</p>
<p>to how the human mind works.</p>
<p>What about consciousness?</p>
<p>So you mentioned, I think early on in the conversation, you said it would be unlikely,</p>
<p>but incredible if sort of the observer is somehow a fundamental part.</p>
<p>So observer, not to romanticize the notion, but seems interlinked to the idea of consciousness.</p>
<p>So if consciousness, as the panpsychists believe, is fundamental to the universe, is that possible?</p>
<p>Is that weight&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, every&hellip;</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Just like Joe Rogan likes to say, it&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>But okay.</p>
<p>But is it on a spectrum of crazy out there?</p>
<p>How the statistically speaking, how often do you ponder the possibility that consciousness</p>
<p>is fundamental or the observer is fundamental to&hellip;</p>
<p>Personally don&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p>There are people who do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a thorough physicalist when it comes to consciousness.</p>
<p>I do not think that there are any separate mental states or mental properties.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re all emergent, just like space time is and space time is hard enough to understand.</p>
<p>So the fact that we don&rsquo;t yet understand consciousness is not at all surprising to me.</p>
<p>You, as we mentioned, have an amazing podcast called Mindscape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as I said, one of my favorite podcasts sort of both for your explanation of physics,</p>
<p>which a lot of people love, and when you venture out into things that are beyond your expertise,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a really smart person exploring even questions like morality, for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I think you did a solo episode and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of really interesting conversations that you have.</p>
<p>What are some from memory, amazing conversations that pop to mind that you&rsquo;ve had?</p>
<p>What did you learn from them?</p>
<p>Something that maybe changed your mind or just inspired you or just what did this whole</p>
<p>experience of having conversations, what stands out to you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unfair question.</p>
<p>Totally unfair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s often the ones I feel like the ones I do on physics and closely related</p>
<p>science or even philosophy ones are like, I know this stuff and I&rsquo;m helping people learn</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>But I learn more from the ones that have nothing to do with physics or philosophy, right?</p>
<p>So talking to Wynton Marsalis about jazz or talking to a Master Sommelier about wine,</p>
<p>talking to Will Wilkinson about partisan polarization and the urban rural divide, talking to psychologists</p>
<p>like Carol Tavris about cognitive dissonance and how those things work.</p>
<p>Scott Derrickson who is the director of the movie Dr. Strange, I had a wonderful conversation</p>
<p>with him where we went through the mechanics of making a blockbuster superhero movie, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s also not a naturalist, he&rsquo;s an evangelical Christian so we talked about the nature of</p>
<p>reality there.</p>
<p>I want to have a couple more, you know, discussions with highly educated theists who know the</p>
<p>theology really well but I haven&rsquo;t quite arranged those yet.</p>
<p>I would love to hear that.</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s, how comfortable are you venturing into questions of religion?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m totally comfortable doing it.</p>
<p>You know, I did talk with Alan Lightman who is also an atheist but he, you know, he is</p>
<p>trying to rescue the sort of spiritual side of things for atheism and I did talk to very</p>
<p>vocal atheists like Alex Rosenberg so I need to talk to some, I&rsquo;ve talked to some religious</p>
<p>believers but I need to talk to more.</p>
<p>How have you changed through having all these conversations?</p>
<p>You know, part of the motivation was I had a long stack of books that I hadn&rsquo;t read and</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find time to read them and I figured if I interviewed their authors, forced me</p>
<p>to read them, right, and that has totally worked by the way.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m annoyed that people write such long books.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m still very much learning how to be a good interviewer.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a skill that, you know, I think I have good questions but, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the give and take that is still I think I can be better at.</p>
<p>Like I want to offer something to the conversation but not too much, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had conversations where I barely talked at all and I have conversations where I talked</p>
<p>half the time and I think there&rsquo;s a happy medium in between there.</p>
<p>So I think I remember listening to, without mentioning names, some of your conversations</p>
<p>where I wish you would have disagreed more.</p>
<p>As a listener, it&rsquo;s more fun sometimes.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a very good question because, you know, everyone has an attitude toward</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Like some people are really there to basically give their point of view and their guest is</p>
<p>supposed to, you know, respond accordingly.</p>
<p>I want to sort of get my view on the record but I don&rsquo;t want to dwell on it when I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>to someone like David Chalmers who I disagree with a lot.</p>
<p>You know, I want to say like, here&rsquo;s why I disagree with you but, you know, we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>to listen to you.</p>
<p>Like I have an episode every week and you&rsquo;re only on once a week, right?</p>
<p>So I have an upcoming podcast episode with Philip Goff who is a much more dedicated pan</p>
<p>psychist and so there we really get into it.</p>
<p>I think that I probably have disagreed with him more on that episode than I ever have</p>
<p>with another podcast guest but that&rsquo;s what he wanted so it worked very well.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That kind of debate structure is beautiful when it&rsquo;s done right.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re, when you can detect that the intent is that you have fundamental respect</p>
<p>for the person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That, and that&rsquo;s, for some reason, it&rsquo;s super fun to listen to when two really smart people</p>
<p>are just arguing and sometimes lose their shit a little bit if I may say so.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a fine line because I have zero interest in bringing, I mean, like, I mean,</p>
<p>maybe you implied this, I have zero interest in bringing on people for whom I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any intellectual respect.</p>
<p>Like I constantly get requests like, you know, bring on a flat earther or whatever and really</p>
<p>slap them down or a creationist, like I have zero interest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to bring on, you know, a religious person, a believer, but I want someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smart and can act in good faith and can talk, not a charlatan or a lunatic, right?</p>
<p>So I will only, I will happily bring on people with whom I disagree, but only people from</p>
<p>whom I think the audience can learn something interesting.</p>
<p>So let me ask, the idea of charlatan is an interesting idea.</p>
<p>You might be more educated on this topic than me, but there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s folks, for example,</p>
<p>who argue various aspects of evolution sort of try to approach and say that evolution</p>
<p>sort of our current theory of evolution has many holes in it, has many flaws.</p>
<p>And they argue that I think like Cambridge, Cambrian explosion, which is like a huge added</p>
<p>variability of species, doesn&rsquo;t make sense under our current description of evolution</p>
<p>and theory of evolution sort of, if you had to, were to have the conversation with people</p>
<p>like that, how do you know that they&rsquo;re the difference in outside the box thinkers and</p>
<p>people who are fundamentally unscientific and even bordering on charlatans?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And you know, the further you get away from my expertise, the harder it is for me to really</p>
<p>judge exactly those things.</p>
<p>And, you know, yeah, I don&rsquo;t have a satisfying answer for that one because I think the example</p>
<p>you use of someone who, you know, believes in the basic structure of natural selection,</p>
<p>but thinks that, you know, this particular thing cannot be understood in the terms of</p>
<p>our current understanding of Darwinism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a perfect edge case where it&rsquo;s hard to tell, right?</p>
<p>And I would have, I would try to talk to people who I do respect and who do know things and</p>
<p>I would have to, you know, given that I&rsquo;m a physicist, I know that physicists will sometimes</p>
<p>be too dismissive of alternative points of view.</p>
<p>I have to take into account that biologists can also be too dismissive of alternative points</p>
<p>of view.</p>
<p>So, yeah, that&rsquo;s a tricky one.</p>
<p>Have you gotten heat yet?</p>
<p>I get heat all the time.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s always something, I mean, it&rsquo;s hilarious because I do have, I try very hard</p>
<p>not to like have the same topic several times in a row.</p>
<p>I did have like two climate change episodes, but they were from very different perspectives,</p>
<p>but I like to mix it up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m having fun.</p>
<p>And every time I do an episode, someone says, oh, the person you should really get on to</p>
<p>talk about exactly that is this other person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, I don&rsquo;t, but I did that now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do that anymore.</p>
<p>Well, I hope you keep doing it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re inspiring millions of people, your books, your podcasts.</p>
<p>Sean, it&rsquo;s an honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Lex.</p>
