    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Peter Atiyah.</p>
<p>Dr. Atiyah is a physician who&rsquo;s focused</p>
<p>on nutritional, supplementation-based, behavioral,</p>
<p>prescription drug, and other interventions</p>
<p>that promote healthspan and lifespan.</p>
<p>His expertise spans from exercise physiology</p>
<p>to sleep physiology, emotional and mental health,</p>
<p>and pharmacology.</p>
<p>Today, we talk about all those areas of health,</p>
<p>starting with the very basics,</p>
<p>such as how to evaluate one&rsquo;s own health status</p>
<p>and how to define one&rsquo;s health trajectory.</p>
<p>We also talk about the various sorts of interventions</p>
<p>that one can take in order to optimize vitality</p>
<p>while also extending longevity, that is lifespan.</p>
<p>Dr. Atiyah is uniquely qualified</p>
<p>to focus on the complete depth and breadth</p>
<p>of topics that we cover.</p>
<p>And indeed, these are the same topics</p>
<p>that he works with his patients on in his clinic every day.</p>
<p>Dr. Atiyah earned his Bachelor of Science</p>
<p>in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics</p>
<p>and his MD from Stanford University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>He then went on to train</p>
<p>at Johns Hopkins Hospital in General Surgery,</p>
<p>one of the premier hospitals in the world,</p>
<p>where he was the recipient of several prestigious awards,</p>
<p>including Resident of the Year.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been an author</p>
<p>on comprehensive reviews of general surgery.</p>
<p>He spent two years at the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>as a Surgical Oncology Fellow</p>
<p>at the National Cancer Institute,</p>
<p>where his work focused on immune-based therapies</p>
<p>for melanoma.</p>
<p>In the fields of science and medicine,</p>
<p>it is well understood that we are much the product</p>
<p>of our mentors and the mentoring we receive.</p>
<p>Dr. Atiyah has trained with some of the best</p>
<p>and most innovative lipidologists, endocrinologists,</p>
<p>gynecologists, sleep physiologists,</p>
<p>and longevity scientists in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>So the expertise that funnels through him</p>
<p>and that he shares with us today</p>
<p>is really harnessed from the best of the best</p>
<p>and his extensive training and expertise.</p>
<p>By the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will have answers to important basic questions</p>
<p>such as, should you have blood work?</p>
<p>How often should you do blood work?</p>
<p>What specific things should you be looking for</p>
<p>on that blood work that are either counterintuitive</p>
<p>or not often discussed,</p>
<p>and yet that immediately and in the long-term</p>
<p>influence your lifespan and healthspan?</p>
<p>We talk about hormone health and hormone therapies</p>
<p>for both men and women.</p>
<p>We talk about drug therapies that can influence the mind</p>
<p>as well as the body.</p>
<p>And of course, we talk about supplementation,</p>
<p>nutrition, exercise,</p>
<p>and predictors of lifespan and healthspan.</p>
<p>It is an episode rich with information.</p>
<p>For some of you, you may want to get out a pen and paper</p>
<p>in order to take notes.</p>
<p>For others of you that learn better simply by listening,</p>
<p>I just want to remind you</p>
<p>that we have timestamped all this information</p>
<p>so that you can go back to the specific topics</p>
<p>most of interest to you.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Peter Atiyah.</p>
<p>Peter, thanks for joining me today.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to this for a very long time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of your podcast.</p>
<p>I know that you went to Stanford</p>
<p>and worked with a number of people</p>
<p>that are colleagues of mine.</p>
<p>So for me, this is already a thrill</p>
<p>just to be doing this.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, likewise.</p>
<p>I have a ton of questions,</p>
<p>but I want to start off with something</p>
<p>that I wonder a lot about,</p>
<p>and that I know many other people wonder about,</p>
<p>which is how to assess their current health</p>
<p>and their trajectory in terms of health and wellbeing,</p>
<p>specifically as it relates to blood work.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts on blood work?</p>
<p>Is it necessary for the typical person?</p>
<p>So this is somebody who&rsquo;s not dealing</p>
<p>with some acute syndrome or illness.</p>
<p>And at what age would you suggest</p>
<p>people start getting blood work?</p>
<p>How frequently should they get blood work?</p>
<p>How often do you get blood work done, et cetera?</p>
<p>The way I talk about this with patients</p>
<p>is first taking everything back to the objective.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the thing we&rsquo;re trying to optimize?</p>
<p>So if a person says,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m trying to break 10 hours for an Ironman,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that blood work</p>
<p>is going to be a game-changing aspect</p>
<p>of their trajectory and their training.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna benefit much more</p>
<p>from sort of functional analyses of performance.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m assuming, based on the question,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really coming at this</p>
<p>through the lens of living longer and living better</p>
<p>through the lifespan, healthspan lens?</p>
<p>Yeah, and just, I think most people</p>
<p>have some sense of their vitality or lack of vitality,</p>
<p>but I think everyone wonders</p>
<p>whether or not they could feel better</p>
<p>and whether or not blood work will give them a window</p>
<p>into how they might go about feeling better.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it does to some extent,</p>
<p>but I also think that it has a lot of blind spots.</p>
<p>So I kind of break things down into the two vectors</p>
<p>that make up longevity,</p>
<p>which are lifespan and healthspan.</p>
<p>So lifespan is the easiest of those vectors to understand</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pretty binary, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re alive or you&rsquo;re not alive,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re respiring or you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you make ATP or you don&rsquo;t, end of story.</p>
<p>So what gets in the way of lifespan</p>
<p>is essentially the four horsemen of disease, right?</p>
<p>So atherosclerotic disease, cancer,</p>
<p>neurodegenerative disease, and metabolic disease,</p>
<p>which directly isn&rsquo;t the cause of many deaths,</p>
<p>but basically creates the foundation</p>
<p>to all of those other diseases.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a non-smoker,</p>
<p>what I just rattled off is about 80% of your death.</p>
<p>So how does blood work help address those?</p>
<p>It varies.</p>
<p>So on the atherosclerotic standpoint,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very good predictor of risk</p>
<p>if you know what to look for.</p>
<p>So primarily ApoB would be the single most important</p>
<p>lipoprotein that we care about.</p>
<p>I can explain what that means in a second.</p>
<p>And then also other markers of inflammation,</p>
<p>endothelial health, and metabolic health.</p>
<p>When it comes to cancer,</p>
<p>blood testing in the sense of biomarkers</p>
<p>is not particularly helpful</p>
<p>outside of knowing that the second leading</p>
<p>environmental or modifiable cause of cancer</p>
<p>is metabolic ill health after smoking.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t actually know a lot about cancer</p>
<p>in the sense of what causes it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really stochastic and it&rsquo;s a lot of bad luck.</p>
<p>So we know that smoking drives it</p>
<p>and we know that even though epidemiologically</p>
<p>we say obesity drives it,</p>
<p>what it really means is metabolic poor health.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the hyperinsulinemia</p>
<p>that comes with obesity that drives it.</p>
<p>So biomarkers help with that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still an enormous blind spot to cancer.</p>
<p>We could talk about liquid biopsies aside</p>
<p>because those aren&rsquo;t really biomarker studies,</p>
<p>but put that away.</p>
<p>On the neurodegenerative side,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have a lot of insight</p>
<p>that comes to understanding Parkinson&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>but when it comes to dementia,</p>
<p>particularly Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>which is the most prevalent form of dementia,</p>
<p>I think the biomarkers can be quite helpful.</p>
<p>They overlap a lot with the atherosclerotic diseases.</p>
<p>So the same things that drive the risk of heart disease</p>
<p>are driving the risk of dementia.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some novel stuff as well.</p>
<p>If you include genetic testing,</p>
<p>which you can get out of a blood test,</p>
<p>we get a whole suite of genes,</p>
<p>not just APOE, but far more nuanced stuff than that</p>
<p>that can also play a role.</p>
<p>So you can stratify risk in that sense.</p>
<p>So in aggregate, I would say,</p>
<p>blood testing with biomarkers</p>
<p>provides pretty good insight into lifespan.</p>
<p>When you get into healthspan,</p>
<p>you have kind of the cognitive, physical, emotional domains.</p>
<p>I think here the biomarkers are far less helpful.</p>
<p>And here we kind of rely more on functional testing.</p>
<p>So when it comes to sort of the cognitive piece,</p>
<p>you can do cognitive testing.</p>
<p>In terms of long-term risk,</p>
<p>a lot of the things that imply good cognitive health</p>
<p>as you age are in line with the same things</p>
<p>that you would do to reduce the risk of dementia.</p>
<p>So all the biomarkers that you would look to improve</p>
<p>through dementia risk reduction,</p>
<p>you would be improving through cognitive health.</p>
<p>On the physical side, I mean,</p>
<p>outside of looking at hormone levels and things,</p>
<p>which we look at extensively,</p>
<p>and understanding how those might aid in</p>
<p>or prevent some of the metrics that matter,</p>
<p>it really is, this is a biomarker aside thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d be much more interested</p>
<p>in a person&rsquo;s DEXA, CPET testing, VO2 max testing,</p>
<p>zone two lactate testing, fat oxidation.</p>
<p>Those, what I would consider more functional tests</p>
<p>that give me far more insight into that.</p>
<p>And then of course the emotional piece,</p>
<p>which depending on who you are,</p>
<p>might be the single most important piece</p>
<p>without which none of this other stuff matters, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a totally miserable human being,</p>
<p>your relationships suck.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of this other stuff matters.</p>
<p>And certainly there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m looking at in biomarkers</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s giving me great insight into that.</p>
<p>Do you ask about emotional state,</p>
<p>or do you try and assess emotional state indirectly</p>
<p>when you do an intake with one of your patients?</p>
<p>Probably not so much in the intake,</p>
<p>because I think it takes a while</p>
<p>to form a relationship with a patient</p>
<p>before that starts to become something</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re necessarily gonna wanna talk with you about.</p>
<p>But I definitely think of it</p>
<p>as an important part of what we do.</p>
<p>And I think without it,</p>
<p>none of this other stuff really matters.</p>
<p>Again, the irony of thinking about</p>
<p>how many years I spent sort of in pursuit</p>
<p>of fully optimizing every detail of everything</p>
<p>without any attention being paid to that dimension</p>
<p>is not lost on me.</p>
<p>And look, there are some patients who they,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just not something that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s compartmentalized.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re doing well in that department,</p>
<p>or maybe they aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but they just aren&rsquo;t willing to engage on that yet.</p>
<p>In terms of frequency of blood testing,</p>
<p>if somebody feels pretty good</p>
<p>and is taking a number of steps,</p>
<p>exercise, nutrition, et cetera,</p>
<p>to try and extend lifespan and improve healthspan,</p>
<p>is once a year frequent enough?</p>
<p>And should a 20-year-old start getting blood work done</p>
<p>just to get a window into what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>assuming that they can afford it</p>
<p>or their insurance can cover it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, I certainly think</p>
<p>everybody should be screened early in life</p>
<p>because if you look at,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s the single most prevalent genetic driver</p>
<p>of atherosclerosis is LP little a.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, most physicians</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what LP little a is,</p>
<p>and yet somewhere between 8% and 12% of the population</p>
<p>has a high enough, and depending on who you,</p>
<p>I had a recent guest on my podcast</p>
<p>who suggested it could be as high as 20%,</p>
<p>have a high enough LP little a</p>
<p>that it is contributing to atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>So to not want to know that</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s genetically determined, right?</p>
<p>This is something that you&rsquo;re born with this</p>
<p>and you only need to really check it once.</p>
<p>Why we wouldn&rsquo;t wanna know that in a 20-year-old</p>
<p>when it can contribute to a lot of the early atherosclerosis</p>
<p>we see in people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s leaving money on the table, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The frequency with which you need to test</p>
<p>really comes down to the state of interventions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it makes sense to just do blood tests</p>
<p>for the sake of doing blood tests.</p>
<p>There has to be kind of a reason.</p>
<p>Is something changing?</p>
<p>A blood test is, for the most part, a static intervention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a look at a window in time,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s benefit in having a few of those</p>
<p>over the course of a year</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re unsure about a level.</p>
<p>So if something comes back and it doesn&rsquo;t look great,</p>
<p>yeah, it might make sense just to recheck it</p>
<p>without reacting to it.</p>
<p>But typically, in patients,</p>
<p>we might check blood two to four times a year,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also probably doing things in there</p>
<p>to now check like, hey, we gave this drug.</p>
<p>Did it have the desired outcome?</p>
<p>You put on three pounds of muscle</p>
<p>and lost three pounds of fat.</p>
<p>Did it have the desired outcome?</p>
<p>Speaking of tracking weight and fat, lean mass percentages,</p>
<p>is that something that you recommend</p>
<p>your patients do pretty often?</p>
<p>I know people that step on the scale every day.</p>
<p>I know people like myself that, frankly,</p>
<p>might step on the scale three times a year.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>I pay attention to other things that are far more subjective.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m making a huge mistake.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about quantitative measurements</p>
<p>of weight, BMI, for the typical person?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re pretty crude.</p>
<p>I think a DEXA, I&rsquo;d rather take a DEXA annually</p>
<p>and then maybe follow weight a little bit more closely</p>
<p>to get a sense of it.</p>
<p>And so with a DEXA, you&rsquo;re getting,</p>
<p>at least the way we look at the data,</p>
<p>four pieces of information.</p>
<p>Now, most people, when they do a DEXA,</p>
<p>should I explain what that is?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think some people might not know what DEXA is.</p>
<p>In fact, I confess I have a crude understanding</p>
<p>of what it is, tell me where I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>and hopefully where I&rsquo;m at least partially right.</p>
<p>My understanding is that there are a number</p>
<p>of different ways to measure lean mass</p>
<p>to non-lean mass ratio.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one where they put you underwater.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one where they put you into some sort</p>
<p>of non-underwater chamber.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s calipering.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the looking in the mirror</p>
<p>and pinching and changing the lighting.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny, if you&rsquo;ve done it enough,</p>
<p>I can sort of tell my body fat by my abs, right?</p>
<p>So I can sort of tell by how good the six pack</p>
<p>or how bad the six pack is, what the leanness is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually not a terrible way to do it.</p>
<p>A bodybuilder, for example, which I&rsquo;ve never been,</p>
<p>can tell you the difference between being 6%, 7%, 8%, 10%,</p>
<p>just based on the degree of visibility within the abs.</p>
<p>But basically, a DEXA scan is an X-ray.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same principle as just getting a chest X-ray</p>
<p>where ionizing radiation is passed through the body</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a plate behind the body</p>
<p>that collects what comes through.</p>
<p>And the denser the medium that the electrons</p>
<p>are trying to go through,</p>
<p>the less of them that are collected.</p>
<p>So when you look at an X-ray,</p>
<p>as everybody&rsquo;s probably seen an X-ray,</p>
<p>that which is white is most dense.</p>
<p>So if you had a piece of metal in your pocket,</p>
<p>it would show up as a bright white thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why ribs and bones show up as white.</p>
<p>And the things that are the least dense,</p>
<p>like the lungs where it&rsquo;s just air, are the blackest.</p>
<p>And everything is a shade of gray in between.</p>
<p>So a DEXA is just doing that effectively,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a moving X-ray.</p>
<p>So you lay down on a bed and it takes maybe 10 minutes</p>
<p>and this little very low power X-ray</p>
<p>kind of goes over your body.</p>
<p>And the plate beneath it is collecting information</p>
<p>that is basically allowing it to differentiate</p>
<p>between three things, bone mineral content, fat, other.</p>
<p>Other.</p>
<p>And the other is quantified as lean body mass.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s organs, muscles, everything else.</p>
<p>So when most people do a DEXA,</p>
<p>they get the report back and the reports are horrible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to see one company that can do this</p>
<p>in a way that isn&rsquo;t abjectly horrible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve created our own templates.</p>
<p>So we have our own dashboard for how we do this</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve just given up on trying to use theirs.</p>
<p>But the first thing most people look at</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s my body fat?</p>
<p>And this is the gold standard outside of like MRI</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s only used for research purposes.</p>
<p>So a DEXA is going to produce a far better estimate</p>
<p>of body fat than calipers or buoyancy testing</p>
<p>or things like that,</p>
<p>provided the machinery is well calibrated</p>
<p>and the operator knows how to use it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some people argue that in the hands of like</p>
<p>the guy who&rsquo;s been doing calipers his whole life,</p>
<p>it could probably be comparable with calipers.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, for an off the shelf tech,</p>
<p>DEXA is amazing.</p>
<p>Of the four things that get spit out</p>
<p>of the DEXA, we think that the body fat</p>
<p>is the least interesting.</p>
<p>And so I would rank that as fourth</p>
<p>on the list of what&rsquo;s germane to your health.</p>
<p>The other three things that you get spit out</p>
<p>are bone mineral density, visceral fat,</p>
<p>and then the metrics that allow you to compute,</p>
<p>like to basically compute what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>appendicular lean mass index and fat free mass index.</p>
<p>And so those three metrics are significantly</p>
<p>more important than body fat.</p>
<p>And the reason is as follows, right?</p>
<p>So bone mineral density basically speaks</p>
<p>to your risk of osteoporosis and osteopenia.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t sound very sexy to people our age,</p>
<p>you know, 50 year old guys listening to this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, big deal.</p>
<p>But for a 50 year old woman, this is a huge deal, right?</p>
<p>A woman who&rsquo;s just about to go through menopause</p>
<p>or has just gone through menopause</p>
<p>is at an enormous risk for osteopenia</p>
<p>and then ultimately osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Because estrogen is the single most important hormone</p>
<p>in regulating bone mineral density.</p>
<p>And we can come back and talk about why that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very interesting how the biomechanics</p>
<p>of bones work and why estrogen specifically is so important.</p>
<p>And this is a huge cause of morbidity, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, if you&rsquo;re over the age of 65</p>
<p>and you fall and break your hip,</p>
<p>your one year morbidity is about 30 to 40%.</p>
<p>Which again, just to put that in English,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re 65 or older, you fall and break your hip,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a 30 to 40% chance you&rsquo;re dead in a year.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Bones matter.</p>
<p>So we want to really get a sense of where you stack up</p>
<p>for your age, for your sex.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re anywhere off the pace,</p>
<p>we have to ramp up our strategy and be super aggressive</p>
<p>about how to increase that,</p>
<p>or at a minimum, prevent any further decay.</p>
<p>And are there age related charts</p>
<p>for these sorts of things?</p>
<p>Yeah, this all gets spit out</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s called a Z-score.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re looking at your BMD,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to give you a Z-score.</p>
<p>So a Z-score of zero means, and you understand this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s Z-score referring</p>
<p>to a probability distribution in a standard mode.</p>
<p>So Z-score of zero means you&rsquo;re at the 50th percentile</p>
<p>for your age and sex.</p>
<p>A Z-score of plus one,</p>
<p>your one standard deviation above, minus one below, et cetera.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a T-score, which is doing the same thing,</p>
<p>but comparing you to a young person.</p>
<p>And so the T-score is technically used</p>
<p>to make the diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis.</p>
<p>We tend to look more at the Z-score</p>
<p>and basically say, look,</p>
<p>if your Z-score right now is minus one in four years,</p>
<p>I want your Z-score to be zero.</p>
<p>Not necessarily because you&rsquo;ve increased that entire way,</p>
<p>but maybe you&rsquo;ve increased slightly</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s expected that you would have declined.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>What are some things that we can do</p>
<p>to improve bone mineral density at any age?</p>
<p>So it turns out there&rsquo;s a real critical window</p>
<p>in which we are malleable.</p>
<p>So depending on the age at which someone&rsquo;s listening</p>
<p>to us discuss this, if you&rsquo;re under 20, 25,</p>
<p>you are still in that time of your life</p>
<p>when you are able to reach your potential.</p>
<p>So it turns out that strength training</p>
<p>is probably the single best thing you can do.</p>
<p>And this was a surprise to me</p>
<p>because we did an AMA on this topic a little while ago,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when I got really deep on this with our analysts.</p>
<p>My assumption was a running must be the best,</p>
<p>some sort of impact must be the best thing you can do.</p>
<p>I assumed running would be better than swimming and cycling,</p>
<p>but it turned out that power lifting</p>
<p>was probably the best thing you could do.</p>
<p>And I think once you understand how bones work,</p>
<p>it became more clear, which is power lifting</p>
<p>is really putting more of a sheer force</p>
<p>from the muscle via the tendon onto the bone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the bones are really sensing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sensing that sheer force</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being applied through the bone</p>
<p>in a compressive way, depending on the bone, of course.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s basically activating the osteoblasts,</p>
<p>which are the cells that are allowing bone to be built.</p>
<p>So this turns out to be probably more important for females</p>
<p>because how high you can get</p>
<p>during that period of development,</p>
<p>say till you&rsquo;re 20 or 25,</p>
<p>basically sets your trajectory for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>So where we get into real trouble is with patients</p>
<p>who, for example, used large amounts of inhaled steroids</p>
<p>during that period of their life,</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s say they had really bad asthma,</p>
<p>or patients who needed large amounts of corticosteroids</p>
<p>for some other immune-related condition.</p>
<p>So during their critical window of development,</p>
<p>they were taking a drug that was impairing this process.</p>
<p>So we have some patients like that in our practice,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just an enormous liability</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re working really hard to overcome,</p>
<p>with nutrition, with hormones, with drugs, with training.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just something you have to be aware of.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware that inhalants for asthma</p>
<p>and things of that sort can impair bone mineral density.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re steroid-based.</p>
<p>Some of them, of course, are just beta agonists,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>So anything corticosterone-like.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Interesting, and then I always get asked this question,</p>
<p>and I always reflexively want to say no,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t really know the answer, so I don&rsquo;t reply.</p>
<p>What about topical corticosterone?</p>
<p>A lot of people will put cortisone cream.</p>
<p>To me, it seems almost inconceivable</p>
<p>that it would have a systemic effect,</p>
<p>but then again, what do I know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all dose and time-related.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve got a little rash under my skin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put corticosteroids on, probably not.</p>
<p>But certainly, with enough of it put on,</p>
<p>I mean, it is absorbed, so it could be an issue.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not typically what we&rsquo;re concerned with.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re mostly concerned with people</p>
<p>that are taking even modest amounts of prednisone</p>
<p>for months, years at a time.</p>
<p>Or like I said, kids that are using steroid inhalers</p>
<p>for years and years and years.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not suggesting that if your kid&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on a steroid inhaler, they shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>You have to solve the most important problem,</p>
<p>and if asthma is the most important problem, so be it.</p>
<p>I think you just want to turn that into,</p>
<p>okay, well, how much more imperative is it</p>
<p>that our kid is doing things</p>
<p>that are putting a high amount of stress on their bones</p>
<p>and via their muscles to make sure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in that maximal capacity to build?</p>
<p>Do you think that somebody in their 30s or 40s or 50s</p>
<p>could still benefit from strength training</p>
<p>in terms of bone mineral density and longevity</p>
<p>as it relates to bone mineral density,</p>
<p>given that there&rsquo;s this key window earlier?</p>
<p>They might&rsquo;ve missed that window.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, no, no, this is essential for the rest of life</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re now trying to prevent the fall off.</p>
<p>So basically, the way it works is you&rsquo;re sort of,</p>
<p>from birth to, say, 20, you&rsquo;re in growth.</p>
<p>From 20 to 50, you plateau.</p>
<p>At 50, men start to decline, but it&rsquo;s really small.</p>
<p>Women start to decline, and it&rsquo;s precipitous.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s related to the drop in estrogen</p>
<p>associated with menopause or premenopause.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And can we get into any of the broad contours</p>
<p>of what that strength training looks like?</p>
<p>We had Dr. Andy Galpin on the show.</p>
<p>He talked a lot about ways to build strength</p>
<p>versus hypertrophy, versus endurance, et cetera.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s pretty good agreement</p>
<p>across the fields of physiotherapy, et cetera,</p>
<p>physiology and medicine, in terms of how to do that.</p>
<p>But my understanding is fairly low repetition ranges,</p>
<p>so this is anywhere from one to six repetitions,</p>
<p>typically not aiming for a pump, hypertrophy,</p>
<p>that sort of thing, but heavy loads</p>
<p>that are hard to move, 80% of one repetition maximum</p>
<p>or more, done with long rest periods,</p>
<p>two to three times a week type thing.</p>
<p>Is that about right?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you look at the literature on this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna tell you, it&rsquo;s gonna differentiate</p>
<p>power lifting from weight lifting.</p>
<p>In other words, yeah, you do need to be kind of</p>
<p>moving against a very heavy load.</p>
<p>Now again, that can look very different</p>
<p>depending on your level of experience.</p>
<p>Like, I really like dead lifting.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, I can count the number of days</p>
<p>left in my life when I&rsquo;m gonna wanna do</p>
<p>sets over 400 pounds, but I&rsquo;ll pick and choose</p>
<p>the days that I do, but I grew up doing those things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m comfortable with those movements.</p>
<p>If I had a 60-year-old woman who&rsquo;s never lifted weights</p>
<p>in her life, who we now have to get lifting,</p>
<p>I mean, we could get her to dead lift,</p>
<p>but I think I wouldn&rsquo;t make perfect the enemy of good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to put her on a leg press machine</p>
<p>and just get her doing that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as pure a movement as a dead lift,</p>
<p>but who cares, right?</p>
<p>We can still put her at a heavy load for her</p>
<p>and do so safely.</p>
<p>So now that said, I mean, there was a study</p>
<p>that was done in Australia, and I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>hopefully we can find a link to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a video on YouTube that actually kind of</p>
<p>has the PI sort of walking through the results.</p>
<p>I could send it to you, Everett.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just amazing.</p>
<p>They took a group of older women,</p>
<p>they looked like they were in their 60s or 70s,</p>
<p>who had never lifted weights in their life,</p>
<p>who had osteopenia, and some probably</p>
<p>already had osteoporosis, and they basically</p>
<p>just put them on a strength training protocol.</p>
<p>And it is remarkable to watch these women.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing good mornings, they&rsquo;re doing dead lifts,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re picking heavy things up off the ground.</p>
<p>I think one woman was picking up,</p>
<p>God, I wanna say she was picking like 50, 60 kilos up</p>
<p>off the ground, I mean, just staggering sums of weight</p>
<p>for these women who have never done anything.</p>
<p>And their bone health is improving at this age.</p>
<p>So the goal, frankly, is to just never get to the point</p>
<p>where you have to do this for the first time.</p>
<p>Strength training is such an essential part</p>
<p>of our existence that it&rsquo;s never too late to start,</p>
<p>but you should never stop.</p>
<p>Love that advice.</p>
<p>Is it a systemic effect or a local effect?</p>
<p>So for instance, let&rsquo;s say that,</p>
<p>well, my mother&rsquo;s in her late 70s.</p>
<p>She actually used to be really strong.</p>
<p>When we were kids, she could move this fish tank</p>
<p>that was in my room long before I could move it.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s really strong.</p>
<p>Over the years, I wouldn&rsquo;t call her frail by any means,</p>
<p>but I certainly think she could benefit</p>
<p>from some strength training.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say she were to start doing some leg presses</p>
<p>or start even with air squats</p>
<p>and maybe work up to some pushups.</p>
<p>Are the effects all local?</p>
<p>Meaning if she were to just train her legs</p>
<p>or just do pushups,</p>
<p>would it only be the loads applied</p>
<p>to the limbs and muscles and tissues that were involved?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where the bulk of it is, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you need to train the whole body essentially.</p>
<p>Yeah, now keep in mind,</p>
<p>the diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis</p>
<p>is based on only three locations,</p>
<p>the left hip, the right hip, and the lumbar spine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just the convention</p>
<p>by which we make the diagnosis.</p>
<p>And I think part of that has to do with</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the majority of the insults occur.</p>
<p>Now, not all of the insults.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people that have,</p>
<p>because of horrible bone density,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fracturing ankles and tibia, fibula,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re having low-tib fib fractures just walking.</p>
<p>So clearly bone density outside of those regions does matter</p>
<p>but much of it is really focused on,</p>
<p>and by the way, you fall, you break a wrist.</p>
<p>So this is a systemic issue,</p>
<p>but the majority of the response is a local response</p>
<p>because it really comes down to</p>
<p>putting a load directly on that bone</p>
<p>and then having that bone in kind respond</p>
<p>by laying down more bone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics</p>
<p>that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>You mentioned falling and the problems with falling</p>
<p>and breaking things and mortality related to that.</p>
<p>I wonder whether or not there are also</p>
<p>health-related effects of just having weak bones</p>
<p>that are not just about falling and breaking a bone</p>
<p>and dying a year later,</p>
<p>even though that&rsquo;s obviously very severe.</p>
<p>Because I think when people hear about that,</p>
<p>some people might think, well, I&rsquo;ll just be more careful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just move more slowly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sit in a wheelchair if I need to,</p>
<p>even though I might be able to walk</p>
<p>if it keeps me from falling.</p>
<p>Some people, I think, adopt that mentality.</p>
<p>What are some of the benefits of having</p>
<p>high bone mineral density for men and women</p>
<p>that are perhaps independent of risk of injury?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s actually the inverse</p>
<p>of what you just said, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like, you have to sort of</p>
<p>be able to articulate what it is you want</p>
<p>in your marginal decade.</p>
<p>So we use this thing in our practice</p>
<p>called the marginal decade.</p>
<p>Marginal decade is the last decade of your life.</p>
<p>So everyone will have a marginal decade.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing I can tell you</p>
<p>with absolute certainty, right?</p>
<p>I believe you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no immortality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no hidden elixir that&rsquo;s gonna help us live</p>
<p>to be, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re all gonna be in our last decade at some point.</p>
<p>And outside of people who die suddenly</p>
<p>or through an accident,</p>
<p>most of us know when we&rsquo;re in that marginal decade.</p>
<p>You might not know the day you enter it,</p>
<p>but most people who are old enough,</p>
<p>if you tell them, are you in the last decade of your life?</p>
<p>They probably have a sense that they are.</p>
<p>So I think the exercise that we like to go through</p>
<p>with our patients very early on</p>
<p>is have them in exquisite detail,</p>
<p>more detail than they&rsquo;ve ever considered.</p>
<p>So we have to prompt them with like 50 questions,</p>
<p>lay out what their marginal decade should look like.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a serious exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very serious exercise, right?</p>
<p>Like what, tell me everything that is going to happen</p>
<p>in your marginal decade.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when it&rsquo;s gonna be, Andrew.</p>
<p>It could be 87 to 97 if we&rsquo;re doing well, right?</p>
<p>It might be 79 to 89.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it would really be a very nuanced exploration</p>
<p>of that topic.</p>
<p>And I think until you do that,</p>
<p>all of this other stuff is just abstract</p>
<p>and kind of nonsense.</p>
<p>Until a person can tell you what it is</p>
<p>that they want to be doing in that last decade,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t design a program to get them there.</p>
<p>I mean, think about it.</p>
<p>Someone wants to do an Ironman.</p>
<p>We take it for granted that we know what the objective is.</p>
<p>I have to be able to swim two and a half miles.</p>
<p>I have to be able to get out, take my wetsuit off,</p>
<p>hop on my bike, ride 112 miles, get off my bike,</p>
<p>take the bike shoes off, put the run shoes on,</p>
<p>run 26.2 miles.</p>
<p>Like we get it.</p>
<p>We know what the objective is.</p>
<p>And only by knowing that can you train.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if I said to you,</p>
<p>Andrew, I&rsquo;m going to have you do an athletic event</p>
<p>in a year, start training.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna tell you what it is.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>
<p>Could be playing basketball.</p>
<p>It could be swimming to Catalina Island.</p>
<p>It could be running a hundred miles.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it.</p>
<p>So similarly, if we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what our marginal decade is meant to be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way to train for it.</p>
<p>Do you think this is a good exercise</p>
<p>for anyone and everyone to do on their own,</p>
<p>regardless of age here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing this and I&rsquo;m thinking,</p>
<p>I need to think about when my last decade might be</p>
<p>and what I want that to look like.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, when I say we do it with our patients,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only because that&rsquo;s the population I work with,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s simply no reason</p>
<p>everybody shouldn&rsquo;t be going through this exercise.</p>
<p>And then you sort of back script from there,</p>
<p>figure out what people should be doing,</p>
<p>given their current health status.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>We call it back casting.</p>
<p>So the first step we do is once we&rsquo;ve really delineated</p>
<p>what the objective function looks like,</p>
<p>we then say, okay, how do you break down that</p>
<p>into metrics that we can measure?</p>
<p>So, you know, you described doing a whole bunch of things.</p>
<p>Okay, just to let you know,</p>
<p>to do that will require a VO2 max of 30 milliliters</p>
<p>of oxygen per minute per kilogram.</p>
<p>And the person will say, okay, what does that mean?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll say, well, that&rsquo;s a measure</p>
<p>of your maximal uptake of oxygen.</p>
<p>And that declines at about 8% to 10% per decade.</p>
<p>So if you have to be at 30,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just assume you&rsquo;re going to be doing that at 90.</p>
<p>So what do you need to be at 80, 70, 60, 50?</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s what it would need to be at 50.</p>
<p>Okay, what are you now?</p>
<p>Ah, there&rsquo;s a big gap.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re below where you need to be now.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re obviously higher than 30 now,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re only at 42 now,</p>
<p>and you need to be at 30 in 40 years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna cut it.</p>
<p>You have to be a lot fitter.</p>
<p>Okay, now let&rsquo;s do the same exercise</p>
<p>around strength and stability.</p>
<p>And without exception,</p>
<p>most people, when they do this exercise,</p>
<p>will find out they&rsquo;re well below where they need to be.</p>
<p>So the gravity of aging is more vicious than people realize.</p>
<p>And therefore, the height of your glider</p>
<p>needs to be much higher than you think it is</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re our age.</p>
<p>If you wanna be able to do the things</p>
<p>we probably wanna be able to do when we&rsquo;re 90.</p>
<p>I absolutely love this approach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done it in terms of my health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought about what I wanna accomplish</p>
<p>in the next three to six months or next year or so.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s a great approach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s forecasting.</p>
<p>Forecasting is fantastic.</p>
<p>Forecasting is really good at short-term things.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work for long-term things.</p>
<p>Long-term, you have to do backcasting.</p>
<p>This backcasting approach really appeals to me</p>
<p>because in my career, well, I never anticipate,</p>
<p>excuse me, I never anticipated I&rsquo;d be podcasting.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I did at some point as an undergraduate.</p>
<p>I looked, professors,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that looks like a pretty good life.</p>
<p>They seem pretty happy.</p>
<p>I talked to a few of them,</p>
<p>and then I figured out what I need to do at each stage</p>
<p>in order to get to that next rung on the ladder.</p>
<p>And just kind of figured it out</p>
<p>in a backcasting kind of way, as you refer to it.</p>
<p>I think this is incredibly useful</p>
<p>because it puts all the questions about blood work</p>
<p>and how often to get blood work</p>
<p>and what to measure in a really nice context</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a highly individualized.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of this before, so.</p>
<p>And I should give a nod to Annie Duke.</p>
<p>I used to always refer to this as reverse engineering.</p>
<p>But in Annie Duke&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>she wrote about this exact thing and called it backcasting.</p>
<p>And I was like, I like the term backcasting better.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more intuitive than reverse engineering.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a real genius to it.</p>
<p>And I think it,</p>
<p>because it sets so many things</p>
<p>into the appropriate bins and trajectories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard you talk before about some of the prime movers</p>
<p>for longevity and all risk mortality.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love for you to review a little bit of that for us.</p>
<p>I think we all know that we shouldn&rsquo;t smoke</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very likely that we&rsquo;ll die earlier</p>
<p>if we smoke nicotine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m neither a marijuana nor a nicotine smoker,</p>
<p>so I feel on stable ground there.</p>
<p>But anytime we see smoking nowadays,</p>
<p>people really want to distinguish</p>
<p>between cannabis and nicotine.</p>
<p>So I am curious about any differences there</p>
<p>in terms of impact on longevity.</p>
<p>But in that context,</p>
<p>what are the things that anyone and everyone can do,</p>
<p>should do to live longer, basically?</p>
<p>How long you got?</p>
<p>Well, you tell me, you tell me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to live to be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like my final decade to be between 90 and 100.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I meant how long do you, but yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>And will we spend from now until you&rsquo;re 90</p>
<p>talking about this?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a risk of that, but top contour is fine.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve done a lot of content on this</p>
<p>and we will give people links</p>
<p>to some of that more in-depth content.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say we were on a short flight</p>
<p>from here to San Diego.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in Los Angeles now.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got takeoff and landing</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t want to kink our neck too much</p>
<p>by doing this thing.</p>
<p>So if I just said, hey, give me the extended version</p>
<p>of the three by five card.</p>
<p>What does that look like?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with a couple of the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve already highlighted.</p>
<p>So smoking, how much does smoking increase your risk</p>
<p>of all cause mortality?</p>
<p>And the reason we like to talk about what&rsquo;s called ACM</p>
<p>or all cause mortality is it&rsquo;s really agnostic</p>
<p>to how you die.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t always make sense.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re talking about a very specific intervention</p>
<p>like a anti-cancer therapeutic,</p>
<p>you really care about cancer specific mortality</p>
<p>or heart specific mortality.</p>
<p>But when we talk about these sort of broad things,</p>
<p>we like to talk about ACM.</p>
<p>So using smoking, smoking is approximately</p>
<p>a 40% increase in the risk of ACM.</p>
<p>What does that translate to?</p>
<p>And that means I&rsquo;m shortening my life by 40%.</p>
<p>No, it means at any point in time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a 40% greater risk that you&rsquo;re gonna die</p>
<p>relative to a non-smoker and a never smoker.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to distinguish.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean your lifespan is gonna be 40% less.</p>
<p>It means at any point in time standing there,</p>
<p>your risk of death is 40% higher.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;ll catch up with you, right?</p>
<p>At some point that catches up.</p>
<p>High blood pressure, it&rsquo;s about a 20 to 25% increase</p>
<p>in all-cause mortality.</p>
<p>You take something really extreme</p>
<p>like end-stage kidney disease.</p>
<p>So these are patients that are on dialysis</p>
<p>waiting for an organ.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s a confounder there</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s the underlying condition</p>
<p>that leads you to that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s profound hypertension,</p>
<p>significant type two diabetes that&rsquo;s been uncontrolled.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s enormous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about 175% increase in ACM.</p>
<p>So the hazard ratio is like 2.75.</p>
<p>Type two diabetes is probably about a 1.25 as well.</p>
<p>So 25% increase.</p>
<p>So now the question is like, how do you improve?</p>
<p>So what are the things that improve those?</p>
<p>So now here we do this by comparing</p>
<p>low to high achievers and other metrics.</p>
<p>So if you look at low muscle mass versus high muscle mass,</p>
<p>what is the improvement?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty significant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about three X.</p>
<p>So if you compare low muscle mass people</p>
<p>to high muscle mass people as they age,</p>
<p>the low muscle mass people have about a three X</p>
<p>hazard ratio or a 200% increase in all-cause mortality.</p>
<p>Now, if you look at the data more carefully,</p>
<p>you realize that it&rsquo;s probably less the muscle mass</p>
<p>fully doing that,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more the high association with strength.</p>
<p>And when you start to tease out strength,</p>
<p>you can realize that strength could be</p>
<p>probably three and a half X as a hazard ratio,</p>
<p>meaning about 250% greater risk</p>
<p>if you have low strength to high strength.</p>
<p>High strength is the ability to move loads</p>
<p>at 80 to 90% of one repetition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all defined by given studies.</p>
<p>So the most common things that are used are actually,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re used for the purposes of experiments</p>
<p>that make it easy to do.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even think they&rsquo;re the best metrics.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re usually using like grip strength,</p>
<p>leg extensions, and like wall sits, squats, things like that.</p>
<p>So how long can you sit in a squatted position</p>
<p>at 90 degrees without support</p>
<p>would be a great demonstration of quad strength,</p>
<p>a leg extension, how much weight can you hold</p>
<p>for how long relative to body weight, things like that.</p>
<p>We have a whole strength program</p>
<p>that we do with our patients.</p>
<p>We have something called the SMA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the Strength Metrics Assessment,</p>
<p>and we put them through 11 tests that are really difficult.</p>
<p>Like a dead hang is one of them.</p>
<p>Like how long can you dead hang your body weight,</p>
<p>stuff like that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to be more granular in that insight,</p>
<p>but tie it back to these principles.</p>
<p>If you look at cardiorespiratory fitness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even more profound.</p>
<p>So if you look at people who are in the bottom 25%</p>
<p>for their age and sex in terms of VO2 max,</p>
<p>and you compare them to the people</p>
<p>that are just at the 50th to 75th percentile,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about a two X difference roughly</p>
<p>in the risk of ACM.</p>
<p>If you compare the bottom 25% to the top 2.5%,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re talking about bottom quarter</p>
<p>to the elite for a given age,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about five X.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>400% difference in all-cause mortality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the single strongest association</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen for any modifiable behavior.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>So when you say elite,</p>
<p>these are people that are running marathons</p>
<p>at a pretty rapid clip?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like what the VO2 max is for that.</p>
<p>Like my VO2 max would be in the elite for my age group.</p>
<p>My VO2 max.</p>
<p>But again, I&rsquo;m training very deliberately</p>
<p>to make sure that it&rsquo;s in that.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t consider myself elite at anything anymore,</p>
<p>but I still maintain a VO2 max that is elite for my age.</p>
<p>I consider you an elite physician and podcaster.</p>
<p>And guy all around.</p>
<p>But true.</p>
<p>But in terms of, okay, so for the-</p>
<p>But the point is like you don&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>a world-class athlete to be elite here.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So maybe we can talk a little bit about the specifics</p>
<p>around the training to get into the top two tiers there,</p>
<p>because it seems that those are enormous positive effects</p>
<p>of cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>far greater than the sorts of numbers that I see around,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say supplement A or supplement B.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>like this is my whole pet peeve in life, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I just can&rsquo;t get enough of the machinating</p>
<p>and arguing about this supplement versus that supplement.</p>
<p>And I feel like you shouldn&rsquo;t be having those arguments</p>
<p>until you have your exercise house in order.</p>
<p>You know, you shouldn&rsquo;t be arguing about your,</p>
<p>this nuance of your carnivore diet</p>
<p>versus this nuance of your paleo diet</p>
<p>versus this nuance of your vegan diet,</p>
<p>like until you can deadlift your body weight for 10 reps.</p>
<p>Like then you can come and talk about those things.</p>
<p>Or something like, let&rsquo;s just go up with some metrics.</p>
<p>Like until your VO2 max is at least to the 75th percentile</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to dead hang for at least a minute</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to wall sit for at least two,</p>
<p>like we could rattle off</p>
<p>a bunch of relatively low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>I wish there was a rule that said like,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t talk about anything else, health related.</p>
<p>We can make that rule.</p>
<p>No one will listen to it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>We can make whatever rules we want.</p>
<p>We can call it Atiyah&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve done before in this podcast</p>
<p>and on social media is just borrowing</p>
<p>from the tradition in science,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s inappropriate to name something after yourself</p>
<p>unless you were a scientist before 1950,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s totally appropriate to name things</p>
<p>after other people.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to call it Atiyah&rsquo;s rule</p>
<p>until you can do the following things.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t talk about-</p>
<p>Please refrain from talking about supplements and nutrition.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>Hereafter thought of, referred to,</p>
<p>and referenced as Atiyah&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>I coined the phrase, not him.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no ego involved, but it is now Atiyah&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>Watch out.</p>
<p>Hashtag Atiyah&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>Wikipedia entry, Atiyah&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, and I am serious about that,</p>
<p>dead hang for about a minute.</p>
<p>Seems like a really good goal for a lot of people,</p>
<p>at least-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our goal.</p>
<p>I think we have a minute and a half</p>
<p>is the goal for a 40-year-old woman.</p>
<p>Two minutes is the goal for a 40-year-old man.</p>
<p>So we adjust them up and down based on age and gender.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And then the wall sit, what are some numbers?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t use a wall sit.</p>
<p>We do just a straight squat, air squat, at 90 degrees.</p>
<p>And I believe two minutes is the standard</p>
<p>for both men and women at 40.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And then, because for some people thinking</p>
<p>in terms of VO2 max is a little more complicated,</p>
<p>they might not have access to the equipment</p>
<p>or to measure it, et cetera.</p>
<p>What can we talk about, think about</p>
<p>in terms of cardiovascular?</p>
<p>So run a mile at seven minutes or less,</p>
<p>eight minutes or less?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>So there are really good VO2 max estimators online,</p>
<p>and you can plug in your activity du jour.</p>
<p>So it would be at a bike run or rowing machine,</p>
<p>and it can give you a sense of that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t remember, I used to know all of those,</p>
<p>but now that I just actually do the testing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s exactly that line of thinking.</p>
<p>Can you run a mile in this time?</p>
<p>If you can, your VO2 max is approximately this.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And I think somewhere in my podcast realm,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got all those charts posted of,</p>
<p>this is by age, by sex,</p>
<p>this is what the VO2 max is in each of those buckets.</p>
<p>Terrific, we&rsquo;ll provide links to those.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have our people find those links.</p>
<p>And then you mentioned deadlifting body weight 10 times.</p>
<p>I just made that one up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not one that we include, but something.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>We use farmer carries.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll say for a male,</p>
<p>you should be able to farmer carry your body weight</p>
<p>for, I think we have two minutes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s half your body weight in each hand.</p>
<p>You should be able to walk with that for two minutes.</p>
<p>For women, I think we&rsquo;re doing 75% of body weight</p>
<p>or something like that, yeah.</p>
<p>Great, I love it.</p>
<p>As indirect measures of how healthy we are</p>
<p>and how long we&rsquo;re going to live.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically grip strength, it&rsquo;s mobility.</p>
<p>I mean, again, walking with that much weight</p>
<p>for some people initially is really hard.</p>
<p>We use different things like vertical jump,</p>
<p>ground contact time, if you&rsquo;re jumping off a box,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really trying to capture,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an evolution, right?</p>
<p>I think the test is going to get only more and more involved</p>
<p>as we get involved.</p>
<p>Because it took us about a year.</p>
<p>Beth Lewis did the majority of the work to develop this.</p>
<p>Beth runs our strength and stability program</p>
<p>in the practice.</p>
<p>And basically I just tasked her with like,</p>
<p>hey, go out to the literature and come up with</p>
<p>all of the best movements that we think are proxies</p>
<p>for what you need to be like the most kick-ass,</p>
<p>you know, what we call centenarian decathlete,</p>
<p>which is the person living in their marginal decade</p>
<p>at the best.</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;m about to say is certainly a mechanistic leap.</p>
<p>But if you look at the literature</p>
<p>on exercise-related neurogenesis in mice</p>
<p>or brain atrophy or brain hypertrophy, et cetera,</p>
<p>in animal models, it&rsquo;s very clear that the best way</p>
<p>to get a nervous system to atrophy, to lose neurons,</p>
<p>shrink neurons, or lose connections between neurons</p>
<p>is to stop that animal from moving</p>
<p>or to de-enrich its environment,</p>
<p>deprive it of some sensory input</p>
<p>or multiple sensory inputs.</p>
<p>And the best way to enhance the size of neurons,</p>
<p>the number of connections between neurons,</p>
<p>and maybe even the number of neurons</p>
<p>is to enrich its environment and get it moving</p>
<p>while enriching that environment.</p>
<p>You know, Andrew, I think it&rsquo;s very difficult for me</p>
<p>to say that the same is not true in humans.</p>
<p>And so the first time this became clear to me was in 2014.</p>
<p>I had an analyst, Dan Pellichar,</p>
<p>and I said, Dan, I&rsquo;m gonna give you a project</p>
<p>that is vexing me to no end, which is,</p>
<p>I want you to look at all of the literature</p>
<p>that we have, both mechanistic and clinical trial data</p>
<p>that talks about Alzheimer&rsquo;s prevention.</p>
<p>And I wanna know every single type of input.</p>
<p>And I wanna have a clear sense of via what mechanism</p>
<p>does it offer what mode of protection?</p>
<p>And it took Dan, and this was obviously,</p>
<p>we iterated a lot on this together.</p>
<p>And he came back with kind of an amazing presentation</p>
<p>that took, I don&rsquo;t know, nine months to a year of work.</p>
<p>And what amazed me was when he came back to it,</p>
<p>he said, the single greatest efficacy</p>
<p>we can point to is exercise.</p>
<p>And I was like, Dan, that&rsquo;s gotta be nonsense, dude.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way exercise is the single best thing</p>
<p>you can do for the brain.</p>
<p>There has to be some drug you&rsquo;ve missed.</p>
<p>There has to be some other thing that you&rsquo;ve missed.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, no, this is hands down the best thing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just what it&rsquo;s doing to BDNF.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just what it&rsquo;s doing to vascular endothelium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just what it&rsquo;s doing to glucose disposal</p>
<p>and insulin signaling and all these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just touching every aspect of the brain.</p>
<p>And I was very skeptical for about six months,</p>
<p>kind of really pushed on him.</p>
<p>And I was like, I think you&rsquo;re missing something, Dan.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re missing something.</p>
<p>And then finally in the end, looped in Richard Isaacson,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a neurologist that we work with really closely</p>
<p>on Alzheimer&rsquo;s prevention.</p>
<p>And ultimately it turned into a paper that we wrote</p>
<p>basically about this topic and a few others.</p>
<p>Because again, I thought, are you sure it&rsquo;s not EPA and DHA?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s gotta have a bigger impact.</p>
<p>And again, there are a lot of things that I think do matter.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole host of things that we do</p>
<p>for Alzheimer&rsquo;s prevention.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one thing that I&rsquo;ll tell patients</p>
<p>is more important than exercising.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s not the sort of pathetic</p>
<p>recommendations that are made.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, you have to exercise a lot more</p>
<p>if you wanna get this maximum benefit.</p>
<p>You will get, you know, the maximum benefit</p>
<p>comes going from nothing to something.</p>
<p>So if you go from being completely sedentary</p>
<p>to doing 15 met hours per week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get probably a 50% reduction in risk.</p>
<p>So a met hour, a met just for people who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is a metabolic equivalent.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re exerting about 1.3 mets sitting here talking.</p>
<p>If we were sitting here being quiet,</p>
<p>it would be about one met.</p>
<p>You know, walking really briskly would be about five mets.</p>
<p>So 15 met hours per week would be three,</p>
<p>one hour really brisk walks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a lot of work.</p>
<p>But just going from doing nothing to doing that</p>
<p>would give you 50% of the benefit</p>
<p>that you would get from going all the way.</p>
<p>Now, again, I think I&rsquo;m personally a little skeptical</p>
<p>of how much that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably a bit less than that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s more upside than people appreciate,</p>
<p>but the studies I don&rsquo;t think can truly capture that.</p>
<p>But look, you know, there&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>to not be exercising more than that</p>
<p>and capture more benefit,</p>
<p>even though the rate at which you accrue it is less.</p>
<p>And it also speaks to the healthspan side of this,</p>
<p>which is not necessarily captured in those data.</p>
<p>The healthspan gets back to the functional piece</p>
<p>that we opened with,</p>
<p>which is what do you want to be doing</p>
<p>in your marginal decade?</p>
<p>Do you want to be able to pick up a great grandkid</p>
<p>if they come running at you?</p>
<p>Do you want to be able to get up off the floor?</p>
<p>Do you want to be able to play on the floor with a kid</p>
<p>and then get up on your own?</p>
<p>And I think most people are thinking final years of life,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to think,</p>
<p>how can they take themselves to the bathroom?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thinking, how can they sit up off the toilet?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, really basic,</p>
<p>vegetative type functions, right?</p>
<p>At some level.</p>
<p>I love this, again, this idea of marginal decade</p>
<p>and using that as a way to back cast</p>
<p>to actual methods and behaviors</p>
<p>and protocols that one should be doing on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use Anika data, as it&rsquo;s now called,</p>
<p>to cite just, I know three Nobel Prize winners,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t mean anything</p>
<p>except that they did beautiful work.</p>
<p>But the point is that they&rsquo;re all in their 90s.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll name them because I&rsquo;m complimenting them</p>
<p>for what they&rsquo;ve done, not just their work,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;m about to describe.</p>
<p>So Eric Kandel at Columbia.</p>
<p>Nobel Prize winner for work on memory.</p>
<p>Torrence and Wiesel for work on neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And then Richard Axel, who&rsquo;s also at Columbia,</p>
<p>Nobel Prize winning work for molecular biology</p>
<p>of smell and molecular biology generally.</p>
<p>All three of them still alive.</p>
<p>Richard&rsquo;s younger compared to the other two.</p>
<p>All three of them either swim, jog, or play tennis</p>
<p>or racquetball, I think is Richard&rsquo;s thing,</p>
<p>multiple times per week.</p>
<p>Eric was, they&rsquo;re all cognitively still extremely sharp,</p>
<p>still interested in the arts, doing science,</p>
<p>curious about science, running laboratories,</p>
<p>writing books, going on podcasts.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s anecdata, but I was kind of surprised</p>
<p>to learn that colleagues that were so intellectually strong</p>
<p>were also so obsessed with exercise.</p>
<p>I mean, they really are obsessed with their exercise routine</p>
<p>and early on linked that to some</p>
<p>of their intellectual vigor over time.</p>
<p>I want to just also use it as a jumping off point</p>
<p>to ask about one kind of niche thing, but it comes up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to out</p>
<p>which one of those told me this,</p>
<p>but one of those three individuals</p>
<p>chews an excessive amount of Nicorette.</p>
<p>Used to be a smoker and I asked him why.</p>
<p>And he said, because in his estimation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s protective against Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or at least the nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation</p>
<p>of nicotine, because nicotine is an acetylcholine receptor,</p>
<p>obviously, is known to create a state of focus</p>
<p>and neural enhancement.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about not smoking?</p>
<p>I just want to be really clear.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t smoke nicotine, vape nicotine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to shorten your life.</p>
<p>Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, in my opinion.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts about augmenting acetylcholine</p>
<p>through the use of nicotine</p>
<p>in order to keep the brain healthy and focused?</p>
<p>Again, this is one Nobel prize winner.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a truly N of one, but he&rsquo;s so convinced</p>
<p>that this matches up with the mechanistic data</p>
<p>on acetylcholine and cognition</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d love to get your thoughts on it.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t speak to the AD prevention component of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to run that by a couple of my colleagues</p>
<p>who I collaborate with on that.</p>
<p>But I can definitely speak</p>
<p>to the cognitive enhancement piece of it.</p>
<p>And I actually did an AMA on this probably a year ago</p>
<p>where I went into all of the gory details of it</p>
<p>and talked about my own use of nicotine,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll cycle on and off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing it for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>What form do you take it in?</p>
<p>I used to use the gum.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the gum anymore.</p>
<p>So now I like these little lozenges.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you a funny story about this.</p>
<p>So our mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair,</p>
<p>mentioned a company to me a year ago.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, hey, have you heard of this company?</p>
<p>And I forget the name of the company,</p>
<p>but he gave me some name.</p>
<p>So I go online and it&rsquo;s like this company selling nicotine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I wonder why he&rsquo;s asking me to do this.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll just order a bunch and then we&rsquo;ll figure out why.</p>
<p>Because there was some reason we were doing this</p>
<p>potentially through an investment.</p>
<p>So I get up, literally ordered a lifetime supply</p>
<p>of this stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really nice little patch.</p>
<p>Because the thing I didn&rsquo;t like about the gum</p>
<p>was I hated just the taste of it.</p>
<p>So then the next week I&rsquo;m talking to David.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, by the way,</p>
<p>I ordered all that nicotine stuff you told me about.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, what?</p>
<p>And he goes, oh, oh, the company&rsquo;s name was something else.</p>
<p>It was totally unrelated.</p>
<p>I was like, oh God.</p>
<p>So the short answer is I think this stuff</p>
<p>is absolutely a concentration enhancing substance.</p>
<p>It is addictive and people need to be wary of that.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not addictive to everybody.</p>
<p>I personally experience no addiction to it whatsoever.</p>
<p>So I could do it every day for 30 days</p>
<p>and stop and experience no withdrawal.</p>
<p>I could forget about it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really seem to matter.</p>
<p>You have to be careful with the dose, truthfully.</p>
<p>Remember, one cigarette is about one milligram of nicotine.</p>
<p>And a lot of these lozenges will plow</p>
<p>four to eight milligrams into you in one shot.</p>
<p>And for someone who is naive to that, like I am,</p>
<p>four milligrams is a lot of nicotine in one bolus.</p>
<p>So you just have to be very mindful of it.</p>
<p>I got a lot of flack when I did this AMA for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>But people were like, how can you, as a doctor,</p>
<p>encourage people to use nicotine?</p>
<p>And I was like, first of all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not encouraging anybody to use it.</p>
<p>I just wanna be able to talk about the biochemistry of it.</p>
<p>And if disclosing that I use it from time to time</p>
<p>is an endorsement, then I apologize for that.</p>
<p>But on the list of things that you can do</p>
<p>to make your brain a little more focused,</p>
<p>I would consider this infinitely safer</p>
<p>than what a lot of people are doing,</p>
<p>which is using stimulants.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, I just tell patients outright,</p>
<p>like we are under no circumstance prescribing stimulants.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, we&rsquo;re not giving anybody Adderall.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not giving anybody Vyvanse or any of these things.</p>
<p>Not to say they don&rsquo;t have an inappropriate clinical use,</p>
<p>but they should be prescribed under the care of somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s really monitoring the use case for it.</p>
<p>And using that as a tool to enhance concentration</p>
<p>and cognitive performance</p>
<p>is not something we&rsquo;re comfortable doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s rampant on college campuses.</p>
<p>I can only imagine.</p>
<p>R-modafinil, modafinil,</p>
<p>which are slightly different, of course.</p>
<p>So non-clinical use, not prescribed for ADHD,</p>
<p>but just it&rsquo;s rampant.</p>
<p>Recreational use, study-based use.</p>
<p>But the data I&rsquo;ve seen on modafinil</p>
<p>suggests that it only really provides a nootropic benefit</p>
<p>in someone who is deprived of sleep.</p>
<p>Is there data that in a totally well-rested person,</p>
<p>there is a nootropic benefit of modafinil?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I had one experience with R-modafinil</p>
<p>where I took a half a recommended dose.</p>
<p>This was prescribed by a doctor.</p>
<p>I went to give a talk.</p>
<p>This was in Hawaii.</p>
<p>And four hours into the talk,</p>
<p>my co-speaker came up to me and just said,</p>
<p>well, first of all,</p>
<p>you got a little bit of a spit in the corner of your mouth.</p>
<p>And second of all,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t blinked in three minutes.</p>
<p>And third, there&rsquo;s only two people left in the audience.</p>
<p>I was so lasered in that I kind of forgot the context.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit of a kind of a tunnel vision OCD type.</p>
<p>Anyway, but that was all it took.</p>
<p>I never took any more of it.</p>
<p>It was a powerful stimulant.</p>
<p>I take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC now and again</p>
<p>before some cognitive work, sometimes before workouts.</p>
<p>And I do subjectively feel that it narrows my focus</p>
<p>in a nice way,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t take it more than once or twice a day</p>
<p>and more than once or twice a week.</p>
<p>I just-</p>
<p>This is an example of where,</p>
<p>you know how we&rsquo;re talking about exercise</p>
<p>versus sort of nutrition and supplements for longevity.</p>
<p>I think there may be a whole bunch of things</p>
<p>that are kind of interesting around focus,</p>
<p>but nothing would compare to changing our environment.</p>
<p>Like, I think that if I compare my focus today</p>
<p>to my focus when I was in college, there&rsquo;s no comparison.</p>
<p>Like in college, I was truly a robot,</p>
<p>but I think a large part of it was there was no distraction.</p>
<p>There was no email, there was no social media,</p>
<p>there was no internet.</p>
<p>I mean, I was in college when Mosaic launched</p>
<p>in the early nineties.</p>
<p>Like I, you know, and you had to walk like a mile</p>
<p>to get to the computer lab on a big sun workstation</p>
<p>to do anything in, you know, some computer code language.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re sitting in your room studying,</p>
<p>there was no distraction.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a far greater component</p>
<p>of what it means to be focused</p>
<p>than the challenges we have today.</p>
<p>So, you know, my thoughts on this would be</p>
<p>if we really wanted to return to a state of focus,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to individually do something about,</p>
<p>you know, our environment.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve tried every little trick I can think of,</p>
<p>like closing my browsers when I&rsquo;m writing and stuff.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;m just not strong enough willed.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll pick up my phone every 20 minutes</p>
<p>to look and see if I miss the text message</p>
<p>or something stupid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty infrequent.</p>
<p>I did a episode on habits and looking at the data.</p>
<p>It seems that people are getting interrupted</p>
<p>or interrupting themselves about once every three minutes</p>
<p>in the typical workplace.</p>
<p>Now that typical has changed</p>
<p>with a lot more people working at home.</p>
<p>I do put my phone away when I try and work</p>
<p>that nothing focuses me like a deadline,</p>
<p>a little bit of a fear-based urgency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Grant deadlines, you know, drop deadlines, as I call them,</p>
<p>or podcasts we&rsquo;re going to record today</p>
<p>that nothing works quite like it, but such is life.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for that offshoot about nicotine.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re not recommending it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s clear that augmenting the acetylcholine system,</p>
<p>which is what nicotine does in its various forms,</p>
<p>and some related type pharmacology does enhance focus</p>
<p>and pretty potently.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s going to be an interesting area</p>
<p>for real clinical trials and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Love to chat about hormone therapies and hormones generally.</p>
<p>When Robert Sapolsky came on the podcast,</p>
<p>we talked a little bit about menopause</p>
<p>and the data around menopause.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very interested in these findings</p>
<p>that I think I&rsquo;m going to get this right,</p>
<p>that whether or not women benefit</p>
<p>from estrogen therapy to offset menopause</p>
<p>really depends on when that therapy is initiated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re aware of those data,</p>
<p>but he claimed that if they begin estrogen therapy</p>
<p>in the middle to tail end of menopause,</p>
<p>the outcomes can be quite bad.</p>
<p>Whereas if they initiate those estrogen therapies</p>
<p>as they enter menopause or even before menopause,</p>
<p>then the outcomes can be quite good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what percentage of the patients you treat</p>
<p>are male versus female</p>
<p>and what ages those patients are, of course,</p>
<p>but what are your thoughts about estrogen therapy</p>
<p>for women, menopause,</p>
<p>and hormone therapies generally for women?</p>
<p>Maybe even testosterone therapy.</p>
<p>You hear about that these days.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll talk about men.</p>
<p>So our practice is probably 70, 30, male, female.</p>
<p>So we have lots of women,</p>
<p>and this is a very important topic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also probably, let me think.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure I&rsquo;m not being hyperbolic</p>
<p>when I say this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think I am.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hands down the biggest screw up</p>
<p>of the entire medical field in the last 25 years.</p>
<p>Now again, it&rsquo;s possible in the next hour,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll think of, nope, there&rsquo;s a bigger screw up.</p>
<p>Another giant screw up.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think I will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty confident that I won&rsquo;t be able to think</p>
<p>of a bigger act of incompetence</p>
<p>than what happened with the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative</p>
<p>in the late 90s and early 2000s,</p>
<p>which is effectively the study</p>
<p>that turned the entire medical field</p>
<p>off hormone replacement therapy for women.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important, I think,</p>
<p>to explain what the study looked at.</p>
<p>So this was a study that was conducted</p>
<p>in response to the widely held belief</p>
<p>in the 70s and 80s</p>
<p>that women should be placed on hormones</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re going through menopause, right?</p>
<p>Menopause is, I guess, maybe I&rsquo;ll even take a step back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much your audience is familiar</p>
<p>with how estrogen, progesterone work.</p>
<p>Is it worth going into that stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably worth mentioning a bit of the top contour.</p>
<p>Some of them might be familiar with it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done episodes on estrogen, testosterone,</p>
<p>but frankly, as I think back to those,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t really go into the biology</p>
<p>of estrogen, testosterone enough.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I mean, actually an interesting aside</p>
<p>that I always tell my female patients</p>
<p>who get a kick out of this.</p>
<p>When you look at a woman&rsquo;s labs,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see her estrogen, her progesterone,</p>
<p>her FSH, her LH, her testosterone,</p>
<p>her sex hormone binding globulin, all these things.</p>
<p>But based on the units they&rsquo;re reported in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very distorting picture</p>
<p>of what the most common androgen is in her body.</p>
<p>If you actually convert them to the same units,</p>
<p>she has much more testosterone in her body than estrogen.</p>
<p>Interesting. Yeah.</p>
<p>I did not know that. Yeah.</p>
<p>Then again, I&rsquo;ve never been a woman</p>
<p>getting my hormone profile done.</p>
<p>Yeah, so even though a woman&rsquo;s testosterone</p>
<p>is much less than a man&rsquo;s level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still more than she has estrogen in her body.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So phenotypically, right,</p>
<p>estrogen is the hormone that&rsquo;s dominating.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the, you know,</p>
<p>she has much higher estrogen than a man</p>
<p>and much lower testosterone than a man,</p>
<p>but in absolute amounts,</p>
<p>she has more testosterone than estrogen.</p>
<p>Just worth pointing that out.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>So, you know, what&rsquo;s happening to a woman</p>
<p>from the age she starts menstruating</p>
<p>until she goes through menopause,</p>
<p>outside of pregnancy and birth control</p>
<p>and stuff like that,</p>
<p>is she has this cycle, you know,</p>
<p>roughly every 28 days, but it can vary,</p>
<p>where at the beginning of her period,</p>
<p>we call that day zero,</p>
<p>her estrogen and progesterone are very low.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t measure them.</p>
<p>And then what happens is the estrogen level starts to rise,</p>
<p>and it rises in response to a hormone</p>
<p>called follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH,</p>
<p>that is getting her ready to ovulate.</p>
<p>And she ovulates at about the midpoint of her cycle.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re just gonna make the math easy,</p>
<p>on day 14, she&rsquo;s going to release a follicle</p>
<p>from one of her ovaries.</p>
<p>And the estrogen level is sort of rising, rising, rising.</p>
<p>We love to measure hormones on day five,</p>
<p>because I wanna have a standardized way</p>
<p>in which I measure her hormones.</p>
<p>So our women know if we&rsquo;re in the business</p>
<p>of trying to understand her hormones,</p>
<p>the day her period starts,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just a day of spotting,</p>
<p>that becomes our benchmark.</p>
<p>And then day five, I wanna see every hormone on that day.</p>
<p>And if everything is going well,</p>
<p>I know what her FSH, LH, estradiol,</p>
<p>and progesterone should be on that day.</p>
<p>So the estrogen rises, starts to come down a little bit</p>
<p>as she ovulates, and then the luteinizing hormone kicks on,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s now going to prepare her uterus</p>
<p>for the lining to accommodate a pregnancy.</p>
<p>So now you start to see estradiol go back,</p>
<p>but now for the first time, progesterone goes up.</p>
<p>So progesterone has been doing nothing for 14 days,</p>
<p>and now it starts to rise.</p>
<p>And actually, progesterone is the hormone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dominating the second half,</p>
<p>which is called her luteal cycle.</p>
<p>So the first 14 days is the follicular cycle,</p>
<p>second is the luteal cycle.</p>
<p>So once you get to about the halfway point of that,</p>
<p>which is now, just to do the math, 21 days in,</p>
<p>the body has figured out if she&rsquo;s pregnant or not.</p>
<p>And again, most of the time, she&rsquo;s not gonna be pregnant.</p>
<p>So the body says, oh, I don&rsquo;t need this lining</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been preparing, I&rsquo;m going to shed it.</p>
<p>So now progesterone and estrogen start crashing,</p>
<p>and the lining is what is being shed,</p>
<p>and that is the menses.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s that last seven days of that cycle</p>
<p>that in a susceptible woman</p>
<p>is what creates those PMS symptoms.</p>
<p>So actually, this is something</p>
<p>that you would probably have a better understanding</p>
<p>of than me.</p>
<p>There is something about this in a susceptible woman</p>
<p>where the enormous reduction of progesterone so quickly</p>
<p>is probably impacting something in her brain.</p>
<p>So I think this is a legitimate thing, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like, oh, she&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s having all these PMS symptoms.</p>
<p>We know that that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>because if you put women on progesterone</p>
<p>for those seven days, those symptoms go away.</p>
<p>So if you can stabilize their progesterone</p>
<p>during the last half of their luteal phase,</p>
<p>and sometimes we would just do it</p>
<p>for the entire luteal phase,</p>
<p>just put them on a low dose of progesterone,</p>
<p>all PMS symptoms vanish.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to look up where the progesterone receptors</p>
<p>are located in the brain.</p>
<p>The Allen Brain Institute now has beautiful data</p>
<p>of in-situ hybridization,</p>
<p>which for folks that don&rsquo;t understand is looking at RNA</p>
<p>or where genes and proteins ought to be expressed</p>
<p>in the human brain by using actual human brain tissue</p>
<p>sections as opposed to just mice.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll take a look.</p>
<p>I think some insight into what that progesterone</p>
<p>emotionality link might be</p>
<p>and where it might exist neural circuit-wise.</p>
<p>So then when the estrogen and progesterone</p>
<p>reach their nadir again, that starts the cycle.</p>
<p>So that cycle is happening over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Okay, so it became well-known in the 50s</p>
<p>that, okay, a woman&rsquo;s going to stop menstruating</p>
<p>at some point, her estrogen goes down.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just give her estrogen?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s clearly going to help</p>
<p>with some of the symptoms of menopause.</p>
<p>So what do women experience when they go through menopause?</p>
<p>The first symptoms are what are called vasomotor symptoms.</p>
<p>So this is usually in the form of night sweats, hot flashes.</p>
<p>So, and depending on the woman,</p>
<p>this can be really significant, right?</p>
<p>These are women who can have a hard time sleeping.</p>
<p>They can be having hot flashes during the middle of the day.</p>
<p>They can wake up soaked in a pool of sweat.</p>
<p>Those tend to pass after a couple of years</p>
<p>and then they get into sort of the more</p>
<p>long-term complications of menopause.</p>
<p>So what we call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness,</p>
<p>and then the stuff that we talked about a while ago,</p>
<p>which is the osteopenia, osteoporosis.</p>
<p>A lot of women will complain of brain fog.</p>
<p>So, I mean, clearly this was an issue</p>
<p>and it was recognized 70 years ago.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we give women estrogen back</p>
<p>to replace that hormone?</p>
<p>And so that went on for a couple of decades,</p>
<p>maybe less, maybe a decade.</p>
<p>And then it was realized, wait a minute,</p>
<p>we were driving up the risk of uterine cancer.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is if you just give estrogen</p>
<p>with no progesterone to antagonize it,</p>
<p>you will thicken the endometrium endlessly</p>
<p>and you will increase the risk of hyperplasia.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ll definitely undergo hyperplasia</p>
<p>and then ultimately dysplasia.</p>
<p>Dysplasia is pre-cancerous</p>
<p>and ultimately we were seeing that.</p>
<p>So people figured out, well, actually,</p>
<p>if you want to give estrogen to a woman</p>
<p>who still has her uterus,</p>
<p>you have to give her progesterone as well.</p>
<p>You have to be able to have a hormone</p>
<p>to oppose the estrogen.</p>
<p>And then that became effectively in the 19,</p>
<p>call it the 1970s-ish, the standard for HRT.</p>
<p>So in the early 1990s, the NIH said,</p>
<p>look, we haven&rsquo;t really studied this.</p>
<p>We have a ton of epidemiology that says</p>
<p>giving women hormones seems to be doing really good things.</p>
<p>They feel better, so all their symptoms go away.</p>
<p>They seem to have lower risk of heart disease,</p>
<p>lower risk of cardiovascular disease,</p>
<p>pardon me, lower risk of cardiovascular disease,</p>
<p>lower risk of bone fractures.</p>
<p>Everything seems to get better.</p>
<p>Lower risk of diabetes.</p>
<p>But we haven&rsquo;t tested this in a randomized prospective trial.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do this.</p>
<p>So that became the WHI.</p>
<p>And it randomized, it had two parallel arms.</p>
<p>So it had a group for women who did not have a uterus.</p>
<p>So these are women that had undergone hysterectomy</p>
<p>for some other reason.</p>
<p>And then it had a group for women</p>
<p>that did have their uterus.</p>
<p>In the first group, there was a placebo arm</p>
<p>and then an estrogen-only arm.</p>
<p>And in the other group,</p>
<p>there was a progesterone plus estrogen versus a placebo.</p>
<p>Everything about the way this study was done</p>
<p>is a bit wonky.</p>
<p>Some of it is justifiable, but it&rsquo;s important to understand.</p>
<p>First, the women were all way outside of menopause.</p>
<p>So none of these women were started</p>
<p>when you would normally start HRT.</p>
<p>And there were probably several reasons for that,</p>
<p>but one of them is,</p>
<p>and I think this is a legitimate reason,</p>
<p>they wanted hard outcomes.</p>
<p>They wanted to know death rates.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re doing this on women in their 50s,</p>
<p>you just weren&rsquo;t gonna get it, right?</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>You gotta wait too long.</p>
<p>Yeah, you gotta wait too long.</p>
<p>And this was only gonna be like a seven to 10-year study.</p>
<p>So they had to do this on women who were much older.</p>
<p>They also disproportionately took much sicker women.</p>
<p>I believe the prevalence,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m gonna get some of these numbers wrong</p>
<p>and people are gonna get all phosphorylated,</p>
<p>but I mean, I&rsquo;m in the ballpark, right?</p>
<p>Something like 30, 40% of these women were smokers.</p>
<p>The prevalence of obesity, diabetes was enormous.</p>
<p>So they really disproportionately</p>
<p>picked the most unhealthy population they could</p>
<p>that was pretty advanced in age.</p>
<p>And again, I think part of that was to say,</p>
<p>look, we wanna make sure that after seven years,</p>
<p>we really know if there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>in these causes of death.</p>
<p>The other thing is, this is kind of weird.</p>
<p>Although again, I understand their rationale for it,</p>
<p>but this is a great example of be very careful</p>
<p>when you look at a clinical trial</p>
<p>that it remotely represents the patients</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re interested in treating.</p>
<p>So they also treated no patients who were symptomatic.</p>
<p>The rationale being, if we include in the study</p>
<p>patients who are symptomatic,</p>
<p>those who are randomized to placebo will drop out.</p>
<p>Okay, it makes sense in terms of study design,</p>
<p>makes no sense if the study design</p>
<p>is intended to mimic the real world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s just keep track of the three issues.</p>
<p>We have a disproportionately unhealthy patient population</p>
<p>who are not symptomatic,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re starting them more than 10 years after menopause.</p>
<p>The next thing that they did,</p>
<p>which again, I understand why they did it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s now the fourth strike against this study is,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve spoken with the PI of the study</p>
<p>and asked this question point blank.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually going to have her on my podcast</p>
<p>at some point soon to go over this in more detail,</p>
<p>is why did you use conjugated equine estrogen and MPA,</p>
<p>which is a synthetic form of progesterone?</p>
<p>Horse?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Estrogen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horse urine.</p>
<p>They collect horse urine.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re getting the&hellip;</p>
<p>Horses do urinate a lot, or at least when they urinate,</p>
<p>it seems like a large volume of urine</p>
<p>from what I&rsquo;ve observed.</p>
<p>You have a lot of experience with this?</p>
<p>No, but my sister rode horses for a little while.</p>
<p>My high school girlfriend had a horse and that thing,</p>
<p>I mean, the peas were legendary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a male horse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, so the conjugated equine estrogen</p>
<p>is the estrogen that&rsquo;s collected from female horses,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s a synthetic progesterone.</p>
<p>And I said to the person, I said,</p>
<p>well, why didn&rsquo;t you use what we use today,</p>
<p>which is bio-identical estrogen and progesterone?</p>
<p>Like today, when we put women on estrogen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an FDA product called the Vivelle Dot.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a patch that you just put on,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s estradiol, but it&rsquo;s bio-identical estradiol.</p>
<p>And we use what&rsquo;s called micronized progesterone,</p>
<p>so bio-identical progesterone.</p>
<p>And she said, well, at the time,</p>
<p>we just wanted to test what was currently being used.</p>
<p>I said, totally makes sense.</p>
<p>But again, now you have four considerations</p>
<p>that you have to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Okay, so despite those four considerations,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna make a case for you</p>
<p>why I think the MPA created a real problem in that study,</p>
<p>the synthetic progesterone.</p>
<p>When the preliminary results were first made available,</p>
<p>but not yet peer-reviewed and not yet published,</p>
<p>there was a huge fiasco, huge press announcement about it,</p>
<p>suggesting that the women receiving the CEE plus MPA</p>
<p>in the group with the uterus</p>
<p>had a higher incidence of breast cancer.</p>
<p>And that basically became the headline that never went away,</p>
<p>though it turned out not to be true.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the numbers.</p>
<p>What was the increase in the risk of breast cancer</p>
<p>in that group?</p>
<p>Which gets to my, one of my,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever listened to me on the podcast,</p>
<p>rail on something.</p>
<p>Listen, I have about 3,800 pet peeves and counting.</p>
<p>My laboratory staff know these, know a good number of them.</p>
<p>So you do not have to apologize for having many pet peeves,</p>
<p>because as long as they have experience</p>
<p>and data to support them, it provides a better life.</p>
<p>So one of my biggest pet peeves is,</p>
<p>and my team knows this,</p>
<p>because sometimes they&rsquo;ll occasionally,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;ll do this and I&rsquo;ll have to remind them.</p>
<p>You never talk about a relative risk change</p>
<p>without an absolute risk accommodating it, right?</p>
<p>So what does that look like?</p>
<p>So the relative risk increase of breast cancer</p>
<p>in the estrogen plus MPA group versus the placebo</p>
<p>was 25, 27%.</p>
<p>And that became the only headline.</p>
<p>HRT increases risk of breast cancer by 27%.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true at all today,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s even look at the data.</p>
<p>What was the ARR?</p>
<p>What was the absolute risk increase?</p>
<p>It was a difference between five cases per 1,000</p>
<p>and four cases per 1,000.</p>
<p>So the ARR was 0.1%,</p>
<p>one case in 1,000.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true, going from four in 1,000 to five in 1,000</p>
<p>is a 25% increase,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a completely inappropriate context.</p>
<p>I agree, and I feel like headlines of that sort,</p>
<p>which have come up recently</p>
<p>around various dietary interventions,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t go there, at least not for the time being,</p>
<p>are nothing short of criminal</p>
<p>because they really distort people&rsquo;s thinking,</p>
<p>but also they steer the course of science and medicine</p>
<p>for, as you pointed out, for decades, if not longer.</p>
<p>And they can really take us off our health track</p>
<p>in serious ways.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll bring this meandering to a close,</p>
<p>which is to say, even though I could spend the next hour</p>
<p>talking about all of the ways in which this study was flawed</p>
<p>and all of the very unethical things</p>
<p>that were done by a number of the investigators</p>
<p>who went out of their way</p>
<p>to mask the truth of this study from the world,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell a woman today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna start you on this</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going through menopause.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using bioidentical hormones,</p>
<p>and if your upper bound risk of breast cancer</p>
<p>is one case in 1,000,</p>
<p>you should at least weigh that</p>
<p>against all of the other benefits, which I&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s something else I wanna say</p>
<p>because a moment ago I alluded to the fact</p>
<p>that I think the MPA might have been</p>
<p>the biggest issue in that study.</p>
<p>So there were two findings in that study that were negative.</p>
<p>One was the small increase in the risk of heart disease</p>
<p>and a small increase in the risk of breast cancer.</p>
<p>But consider the other group.</p>
<p>We forgot about the group that didn&rsquo;t have a uterus</p>
<p>because remember those women</p>
<p>got estrogen only versus placebo.</p>
<p>What was the difference in breast cancer there?</p>
<p>Well, this is interesting</p>
<p>because it didn&rsquo;t reach statistical significance,</p>
<p>but its p-value was 0.06 or 0.07.</p>
<p>So it came very close, but it was in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>It was a 24% risk reduction, about one in 1,000 as well.</p>
<p>So when you had estrogen plus MPA,</p>
<p>you had a barely statistically significant,</p>
<p>the p-value was 0.05.</p>
<p>So it just hit statistical significance,</p>
<p>one in 1,000 cases for breast cancer.</p>
<p>And then you had one in 1,000 cases,</p>
<p>but p-value of 0.07 for reduction of risk of breast cancer,</p>
<p>which to me suggests that the MPA,</p>
<p>the synthetic progesterone,</p>
<p>was playing more of a role than anything else.</p>
<p>The second thing I point out is oral estrogen,</p>
<p>which we no longer use, does increase coagulability.</p>
<p>It does increase the ability of the blood</p>
<p>to clot a little bit.</p>
<p>And when we look at the more recent data on HRT</p>
<p>using hoppical estrogen or patches of estrogen,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t see that at all.</p>
<p>In fact, we see the opposite now.</p>
<p>So now we see the risk of heart disease</p>
<p>going down in women with estradiol.</p>
<p>And some women will be arriving to those treatments</p>
<p>with mutations and things like factor V Leiden</p>
<p>and other clotting factors.</p>
<p>Is it appropriate to say that everyone,</p>
<p>both male and female,</p>
<p>should know whether or not they have mutant forms</p>
<p>of factor V Leiden?</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t typically test people for factor V.</p>
<p>My wife actually has it,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t learn it until she had HELP syndrome,</p>
<p>giving birth to our first daughter.</p>
<p>But, you know, we kind of look for more family history</p>
<p>reason to be testing things like that.</p>
<p>We take a pretty detailed family history,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll kind of look for clotting issues there.</p>
<p>What about, so your reflex nowadays</p>
<p>is to put women on these topical estrogen therapies.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s to basically have the discussion, right?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s where we still struggle, right?</p>
<p>Is, you know, we, if it were up to me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d prefer for a woman&rsquo;s HRT to be provided by her GYN</p>
<p>because we want to be able to work in partnership</p>
<p>with the GYN who,</p>
<p>we would like to see an endometrial ultrasound</p>
<p>done every year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, some would argue that&rsquo;s overkill,</p>
<p>but, you know, we think she&rsquo;d be having a pap smear</p>
<p>every year as well.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re looking at the cervix,</p>
<p>we want to look at the endometrium,</p>
<p>we want to make sure the lining isn&rsquo;t too thick.</p>
<p>The other thing I should say, Andrew,</p>
<p>is today we now realize that not all women</p>
<p>can tolerate estrogen, pardon me, progesterone.</p>
<p>So you have to be careful.</p>
<p>So assuming, again, a woman still has her uterus,</p>
<p>the estrogen solves most of the problems,</p>
<p>but then you have to decide,</p>
<p>can she tolerate the progesterone?</p>
<p>And it needs to be, if given systemically,</p>
<p>like 100 to 200 milligrams.</p>
<p>And for some women, that is a life-saving intervention.</p>
<p>I mean, they start sleeping better,</p>
<p>their hair gets thicker, they feel better.</p>
<p>But for some women, it literally drives them crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the reciprocal of what we were seeing</p>
<p>in the case of women with PMS.</p>
<p>So in those situations, we say, great,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re done with oral progesterone.</p>
<p>We just use a progesterone-coated IUD.</p>
<p>So then you get the local progesterone in the uterus</p>
<p>for protection in the systemic estrogen.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>What about oral contraception in women?</p>
<p>So the use of estrogen chronically</p>
<p>through people&rsquo;s college years or 20s, 30s,</p>
<p>maybe even teens, who knows?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s known about the long-term effects, if any?</p>
<p>I gotta be honest with you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I know enough to comment on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that really impacts</p>
<p>my patient population.</p>
<p>You know, at least in what I see,</p>
<p>more women are using IUDs for contraception than OCs.</p>
<p>I mean, we use OCs sometimes in women</p>
<p>who are premenopausal for symptomatic control,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll typically use like a low, low estrogen,</p>
<p>so a very low synthetic estrogen,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t like using these very much,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s the only thing that we can get</p>
<p>to control certain symptoms,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll use it like half her cycle.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s typically not something</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re that experienced with.</p>
<p>What about testosterone, because you mentioned</p>
<p>that nanogram per mil,</p>
<p>when you set everything to the same,</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s nanogram per deciliter,</p>
<p>as it would be to kind of normalize everything.</p>
<p>Versus picogram per mole.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, and so what Peter was pointing out before</p>
<p>is that you look at your charts</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all in these different measures,</p>
<p>and so when you normalize,</p>
<p>testosterone is actually higher than estrogen</p>
<p>in women, that&rsquo;s a surprise to me.</p>
<p>Do you prescribe testosterone therapy to women ever?</p>
<p>We do sometimes, but I do it with much more caution</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have the data, right?</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ll say is, look, I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now really outside of an area</p>
<p>where I can point to a lot of data.</p>
<p>Like when it comes to estrogen and progesterone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll happily go toe-to-toe with anybody</p>
<p>who wants to make the case that it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>Similarly, when it comes to using testosterone in men,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spend all day and I can go through that literature</p>
<p>until the other person cries</p>
<p>and wants to just call uncle, right?</p>
<p>And then you prescribe them testosterone.</p>
<p>When it comes to estrogen,</p>
<p>testosterone in women, don&rsquo;t have that data.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to see that trial done.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the sweet spot?</p>
<p>How do we reconcile that?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not something I consider standard,</p>
<p>and basically, if a woman is,</p>
<p>if her testosterone, first of all, is staggeringly low,</p>
<p>and again, even though her testosterone is low</p>
<p>compared to a male, we still have a range.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s really at the bottom of that range,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s really having difficulty putting on muscle mass</p>
<p>and really complaining of low libido,</p>
<p>I think in that situation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go ahead and use topical testosterone</p>
<p>and replace her to a level</p>
<p>that is still physiologically normal.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s key because when people hear HRT,</p>
<p>they think about super physiological.</p>
<p>It seems to be the term.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I&rsquo;ve never seen a single symptom</p>
<p>in a single woman that I&rsquo;ve put testosterone on</p>
<p>in terms of acne, body hair, things like that.</p>
<p>Those are real symptoms that you have to be aware of,</p>
<p>but clitoral enlargement and things like that,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t happen under physiologic normal conditions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk a little bit</p>
<p>about hormone replacement therapy in men.</p>
<p>When one looks on social media and the internet,</p>
<p>there seems to be a younger and younger cohort</p>
<p>of guys and people in their teens and 20s</p>
<p>showing up to the table,</p>
<p>thinking that injecting testosterone cypionate</p>
<p>or taking Anivar or whatever it is</p>
<p>is going to be the right idea.</p>
<p>They mainly seem to be focused on cosmetic effects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a physician,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t say whether or not</p>
<p>they were actually hypergonadal, et cetera,</p>
<p>but it seems to me, again, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but it seems to me that similar to the Atiyah&rsquo;s rule</p>
<p>as it relates to longevity,</p>
<p>that we could come up with a broad contour rule</p>
<p>in which if a male of any age</p>
<p>is not trying to get decent sleep,</p>
<p>exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition,</p>
<p>minding their social connections, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>the idea of going straight to testosterone</p>
<p>seems like a bad idea.</p>
<p>That said, just like with depression and antidepressants,</p>
<p>there is a kind of a cliff</p>
<p>after which low enough testosterone</p>
<p>or low enough serotonin prevents people</p>
<p>from sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I do want to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>But with that in mind,</p>
<p>how do you think about,</p>
<p>and perhaps occasionally prescribe</p>
<p>and direct your patients</p>
<p>in terms of hormone replacement therapy in men,</p>
<p>person in their 30s, person in their 40s,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing almost all the other things correctly,</p>
<p>what sorts of levels do you think are meaningful?</p>
<p>Because the range is tremendous in terms of blood tests,</p>
<p>300 nanograms per deciliter,</p>
<p>I think on the low end now in the US,</p>
<p>all the way up to 900 or 1,200.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an enormous range.</p>
<p>What are some of the other hormones you like to look at?</p>
<p>Estrogen, DHT, and so on.</p>
<p>So, a lot to unpack there.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with the ranges, right?</p>
<p>So the ranges you gave are for total testosterone, of course.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time looking at that.</p>
<p>I used to spend more time looking at total and free</p>
<p>when I used more tricks to modulate it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually far more simple</p>
<p>in my manipulation of testosterone today</p>
<p>than I was six or seven years ago.</p>
<p>Six or seven years ago,</p>
<p>I mean, we would use a microdose of Anivar</p>
<p>to lower SHBG in a person who had normal testosterone,</p>
<p>but low free testosterone.</p>
<p>What was a low dose of Anivar in that context?</p>
<p>10 milligrams subling, two to three times a week.</p>
<p>Anivar basically being DHT.</p>
<p>Oxandrolone.</p>
<p>Oxandrolone, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re not recommending this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, if you&rsquo;re playing a competitive sport,</p>
<p>it can get you banned from that sport.</p>
<p>No, no, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It can also get you banned from having children</p>
<p>if you do it incorrectly.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a microdose of this has to be small enough</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t impair your body&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to make testosterone.</p>
<p>But Anivar has such a high affinity for SHBG</p>
<p>that it basically distracts your SHBG</p>
<p>from binding your testosterone.</p>
<p>Freeing up testosterone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So the goal was how do I just give you</p>
<p>more free testosterone?</p>
<p>So if a patient shows up and they&rsquo;ve got a total testosterone</p>
<p>of 900 nanograms per deciliter,</p>
<p>which would place them at,</p>
<p>depending on the scale you look at,</p>
<p>the scale we look at,</p>
<p>that would place you at about the 70th percentile.</p>
<p>But your free testosterone is eight nanograms</p>
<p>per deciliter.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty bad.</p>
<p>That means you&rsquo;re less than 1% free.</p>
<p>A guy should be about 2% free T.</p>
<p>So that dude should be closer</p>
<p>to 16 to 18 nanograms per deciliter.</p>
<p>So in that situation that I just gave you,</p>
<p>his SHBG is really high.</p>
<p>His SHBG is probably in the 80 to 90 range.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very high.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I think the upper range is somewhere around 55, 56.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So we would first backstall for what&rsquo;s driving his SHBG.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s basically three hormones.</p>
<p>So genetics plays a huge role in this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that just out of the box,</p>
<p>people have a different like set point for SHBG.</p>
<p>Mine is incredibly low.</p>
<p>My SHBG is like kind of in the 30s, 20s to 30s.</p>
<p>But from a hormone perspective,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s basically three hormones that run it.</p>
<p>So estradiol being probably the most important,</p>
<p>insulin and thyroxine.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna look at all of those</p>
<p>and decide if any of those are playing a role.</p>
<p>So insulin suppresses it.</p>
<p>So this is actually the great irony</p>
<p>of helping a person get metabolically healthy</p>
<p>is in the short run,</p>
<p>you can actually lower their free testosterone,</p>
<p>all things equal.</p>
<p>Because as insulin comes down, SHBG goes up.</p>
<p>And if testosterone hasn&rsquo;t gone up with it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lowering free testosterone.</p>
<p>So somebody who goes on a very low carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>and attempt to drop some water and drop some weight</p>
<p>is going to increase their SHBG.</p>
<p>Yeah, if their insulin goes down.</p>
<p>Find up testosterone, less free testosterone.</p>
<p>I can tell the carnivore diet people</p>
<p>are gonna be coming after me with bone marrow in hand.</p>
<p>But then again,</p>
<p>after this discussion extends a little further,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the vegans will be coming after me</p>
<p>with celery stalks.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>So then the same as with estradiol.</p>
<p>So except in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>So higher estradiol is higher SHBG.</p>
<p>So again, occasionally you&rsquo;ll see a guy</p>
<p>with normal testosterone,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a very high aromatase activity person.</p>
<p>So he has a lot of the enzyme</p>
<p>that converts testosterone into estradiol.</p>
<p>You can lower estradiol a bit with an aromatase inhibitor.</p>
<p>And that can bring down SHBG.</p>
<p>Now, again, these things individually</p>
<p>are rarely enough to move the needle.</p>
<p>The last is thyroxine.</p>
<p>So if you have a person whose thyroid is out of whack,</p>
<p>you have to fix that before you,</p>
<p>if their T4 is out of whack,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna interfere with SHBG.</p>
<p>There are also some supplements,</p>
<p>which I think you&rsquo;ve probably talked about these</p>
<p>on the podcast.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve heard you talk about these on the podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are a few that will adjust.</p>
<p>There is this idea.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a much better review that just came out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send it to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love your thoughts on it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been perusing it line by line.</p>
<p>But I love input from experts like you</p>
<p>on the use of Tonga Ali for reducing SHBG.</p>
<p>In my experience, it does free up some testosterone,</p>
<p>by which mechanism, it isn&rsquo;t exactly clear.</p>
<p>And the effects aren&rsquo;t that dramatic, right?</p>
<p>There are probably multiple effects.</p>
<p>For all we know, it increases libido,</p>
<p>and it does generally by way of increasing estrogen</p>
<p>slightly, which can also increase libido</p>
<p>in some individuals.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know the exact mode of action.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about a few.</p>
<p>The one that a few years back people were claiming</p>
<p>could reduce SHBG was stinging nettles.</p>
<p>Stinging nettle, well, just urine seems to be,</p>
<p>or urinating seems to be coming up multiple times</p>
<p>on this podcast for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Stinging nettle extract, I took the most pronounced effect</p>
<p>of that was you could basically urinate over a car</p>
<p>when taking SHBG.</p>
<p>What the underlying mechanism of that was, I do not know.</p>
<p>I took it for a short while.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t drop my SHBG very much.</p>
<p>But it did drop my DHT sufficiently</p>
<p>so that I stopped taking it.</p>
<p>I do not like anything that impedes DHT.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if my hairline retreats.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about any of that.</p>
<p>DHT to me is something to be hoveted and held onto</p>
<p>because you feel so much better when your DHT</p>
<p>is in the appropriate range.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d love your thoughts on that.</p>
<p>Yeah, again, it really depends on the guy.</p>
<p>And it depends on what risk you&rsquo;re trying to manage, right?</p>
<p>So prostate size starts to become one of the issues</p>
<p>with DHT.</p>
<p>Luckily, my prostate specific antigen is low.</p>
<p>And DHT, the things that I know can reduce it</p>
<p>are things like finasteride, Propecia, things like that.</p>
<p>Right, things that people take to try and avoid hair loss</p>
<p>can dramatically reduce DHT and lead to all sorts</p>
<p>of terrible sexual side effects,</p>
<p>mood-based side effects, et cetera.</p>
<p>But yeah, so I&rsquo;m not aware of anything</p>
<p>that can be taken in supplement form</p>
<p>that can really profoundly drop SHBG.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t spend much attention on it anymore.</p>
<p>Basically, I used to have</p>
<p>a much more complicated differential diagnosis</p>
<p>eight years ago.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I would drive patients nuts</p>
<p>with the whiteboard diagrams I would draw for them.</p>
<p>When in the end, I think they were just like,</p>
<p>dude, just what do I need to take?</p>
<p>Today, we take a much more simple approach.</p>
<p>So the first question is,</p>
<p>should you or should you have your free testosterone</p>
<p>being higher?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the metric I care about,</p>
<p>is free testosterone is the first most important.</p>
<p>The second most important is estradiol.</p>
<p>And sorry to interrupt you.</p>
<p>You said, if you look at your total testosterone,</p>
<p>you want the free T to be about 2% of your total.</p>
<p>Well, it should be, right?</p>
<p>I might not change that anymore.</p>
<p>So in other words, if a guy&rsquo;s at 1%,</p>
<p>then I know I have to really boost his total testosterone.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s only gonna get one to one and a half percent</p>
<p>of it converted to free, I need to boost him.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s outside the range.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll have a guy who&rsquo;s free T,</p>
<p>I might have to get a guy&rsquo;s total T up to 1,500</p>
<p>to get his free T to 18.</p>
<p>I see, so free T is the target.</p>
<p>I like this approach. Free T is what we treat.</p>
<p>And do you still use antivirals,</p>
<p>oxandrol, sorry, to try and lower SHBG?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s too potent?</p>
<p>No, because it&rsquo;s just too complicated for patients.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a drug that can&rsquo;t be taken orally,</p>
<p>so you have to take it under the tongue.</p>
<p>Like a troche or something.</p>
<p>Right, but then, you know, I had one patient once</p>
<p>who, even though we told him about 87 times that,</p>
<p>he was like swallowing the antivirals and his liver function,</p>
<p>and he was like, we&rsquo;re talking 10 milligrams</p>
<p>three times a week is a tiny dose.</p>
<p>And three months of him or whatever,</p>
<p>two months of him swallowing that every time</p>
<p>tripled his liver function test.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just, I was like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not worth the hassle of doing this</p>
<p>for, you know, perfection.</p>
<p>In reality, we can fix this another way.</p>
<p>So the first order question is,</p>
<p>do we believe clinically you will benefit</p>
<p>from normalizing your free testosterone,</p>
<p>or taking it to a level,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it 80th to 90th percentile.</p>
<p>So upper normal limit of physiologic ranges.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first order question.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to come down to symptoms,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to come down to some biomarkers.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, two years ago,</p>
<p>was it two years ago or maybe a year ago,</p>
<p>very good study came out that looked at pre-diabetic men,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve probably talked about this study,</p>
<p>and looking at insulin resistance and glucose disposal</p>
<p>with and without testosterone.</p>
<p>And the evidence was overwhelmingly clear.</p>
<p>Testosterone improves glycemic control.</p>
<p>Testosterone improves insulin signaling.</p>
<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, by the way,</p>
<p>given the role muscles play</p>
<p>as a glucose reservoir and a glucose sink.</p>
<p>So now I include that as one of the things</p>
<p>that we will consider as a factor for using testosterone.</p>
<p>Now, again, it&rsquo;s not the only one.</p>
<p>So you can accomplish that with exercise,</p>
<p>you can accomplish that with these other things,</p>
<p>but then you get into a little bit of the vicious cycle</p>
<p>of will having a normalized testosterone</p>
<p>facilitate you doing those things better?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just assume we come to the decision</p>
<p>that this person is a good candidate</p>
<p>for testosterone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>The next question is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the method we&rsquo;re going to do it?</p>
<p>Are we going to do it indirectly or directly?</p>
<p>Now, we used to use a lot of clomid in our practice.</p>
<p>And have you talked about clomid on the podcast?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t talked too much about it.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about the fact</p>
<p>that some people taking things like an astrazole</p>
<p>to reduce aromatase activity can potentially run</p>
<p>into trouble because they think,</p>
<p>oh, well, more testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad,</p>
<p>and then they end up with issues like joint pain,</p>
<p>memory issues, and severe drops in libido.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of the reason why-</p>
<p>And even fat accumulation.</p>
<p>So if estrogen is too low, you can develop adiposity</p>
<p>in a way that you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great New England journal paper,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably 10 years old now,</p>
<p>that looked at, I believe it was five different doses</p>
<p>of testosterone cypionate.</p>
<p>So these men were chemically castrated</p>
<p>and divided into 10 groups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>Somebody signed up for this study.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you were with and without an astrazole</p>
<p>and five doses of testosterone.</p>
<p>So now you basically had five testosterone levels,</p>
<p>plus or minus high or low estradiol.</p>
<p>And the results were really clear</p>
<p>that the higher your testosterone</p>
<p>and the more your estradiol was in kind of that 30 to 50</p>
<p>range, the better you were.</p>
<p>So if estrogen was too low,</p>
<p>even in the presence of high testosterone,</p>
<p>the outcomes were less significant.</p>
<p>And this is 30 to 50 nanograms per deciliter,</p>
<p>not 30 to 50% of one&rsquo;s testosterone.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Okay, so we haven&rsquo;t talked, but clomid is,</p>
<p>we have not talked a lot about clomid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get your thoughts on clomid.</p>
<p>So clomiphene is a fertility drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a synthetic hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually two drugs, m-clomiphene</p>
<p>and I forget the other one.</p>
<p>And it tells the pituitary to secrete FSH and LH.</p>
<p>So the advantage of clomid is it&rsquo;s oral</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s meant to be taken orally.</p>
<p>So, you know, a typical starting dose</p>
<p>would be like 50 milligrams, three times a week.</p>
<p>And if you do that, you&rsquo;ll notice in most men,</p>
<p>especially young men, FSH, LH goes up.</p>
<p>In any man, the FSH and LH go up.</p>
<p>But if a man still has testicular reserve,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll make lots of testosterone in response to that.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s the first order question</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to answer is,</p>
<p>do you, is your failure to make testosterone</p>
<p>central or peripheral?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think just one point out,</p>
<p>again, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but my understanding is that a lot of the drugs</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>the synthetic compounds, testosterone, estrogen,</p>
<p>things related to growth hormone, et cetera,</p>
<p>were discovered and designed in order to treat,</p>
<p>and excuse me, in order to isolate</p>
<p>and treat exactly these kinds of syndromes,</p>
<p>whether or not it was the hypothalamus, the pituitary,</p>
<p>or the target tissue, the ovaries or the testes, correct?</p>
<p>Correct, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the easiest way to go about doing this</p>
<p>is just give the hormone that&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>without attention to where the deficiency is.</p>
<p>Why this becomes relevant is,</p>
<p>if you have a 35-year-old guy whose testosterone is low,</p>
<p>but you can demonstrate that it&rsquo;s low</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not getting enough of a signal</p>
<p>from the pituitary,</p>
<p>why would you bother giving him more testosterone</p>
<p>when he has the capacity,</p>
<p>he has the Leydig cells and the Sertulli cells</p>
<p>to make testosterone, he just needs the signal.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though not always,</p>
<p>just a course of Clomid can wake him up</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s back to making normal testosterone.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;ll do this three times a week,</p>
<p>50 milligrams three times a week for a short course,</p>
<p>and then-</p>
<p>Yeah, we would do it for eight to 12 weeks</p>
<p>and then we reevaluate.</p>
<p>And estrogen and testosterone will increase in parallel.</p>
<p>Yes, and again, it depends.</p>
<p>Aromatase activity is dependent</p>
<p>on how much body fat you have and genetics.</p>
<p>And if estradiol gets too high,</p>
<p>we think if it gets over about 55, 60,</p>
<p>we will give micro doses of an astrozole.</p>
<p>But it has to be real micro doses.</p>
<p>I mean, you cannot pound people with an astrozole.</p>
<p>To give you perspective,</p>
<p>the sort of on-label use,</p>
<p>like if you just go to a pharmacy and order an astrozole,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get one milligram tablets.</p>
<p>Like we can&rsquo;t give anybody a milligram.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll feel like garbage.</p>
<p>We have to have it compounded at 0.1 milligrams</p>
<p>and we might give a patient 0.1 two to three times a week.</p>
<p>That would be a big dose of an astrozole.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that the typical TRT clinic out there</p>
<p>is giving 200 milligrams per mil,</p>
<p>one mil, 200 milligrams of testosterone once every two weeks</p>
<p>and then hitting people with multiple milligrams</p>
<p>of an astrozole and they&rsquo;re all over the place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really understood.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of blows my mind</p>
<p>that these TRT clinics are up all over the place</p>
<p>given how bad, I mean, I see the results</p>
<p>because I have patients that come from them</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t understand like why they&rsquo;re so incompetent.</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s worse than that.</p>
<p>I think that they simply don&rsquo;t understand and don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a pill mill and it&rsquo;s a money mill.</p>
<p>I think that nowadays it seems almost everybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing TRT is taking lower doses more frequently</p>
<p>every other day or twice a week, dividing the dose</p>
<p>and being very, very careful with these estrogen</p>
<p>or aromatase blockers.</p>
<p>Most of our patients do not take aromatase inhibitors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not needed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really only the high aromatizers that need it.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, when we&rsquo;ll talk about testosterone,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about dosing there.</p>
<p>Because I agree, the more frequently</p>
<p>you can take it, the better.</p>
<p>And frankly, you don&rsquo;t need to go more frequently</p>
<p>than twice a week.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so slow-acting.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, the half-life of the drug is,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s about three and a half days</p>
<p>is the plasma half-life or something like that.</p>
<p>It could be off a little bit,</p>
<p>but twice a week dosing is really nice.</p>
<p>So if you go to like a testosterone clinic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s giving you 200 every two weeks,</p>
<p>50 twice a week is the same total dose.</p>
<p>Which, by the way, is a physiologic dose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to give somebody</p>
<p>any of the side effects you would see.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get acne with that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get gynecomastia.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get anything.</p>
<p>The only real side effect you get from that</p>
<p>is you will get testicular atrophy.</p>
<p>That is enough to suppress.</p>
<p>Yeah, to maintain fertility,</p>
<p>what do you typically do for-</p>
<p>Well, so this is where,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll finish the story on Clomid,</p>
<p>because we currently do not use Clomid.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s due to a really interesting observation</p>
<p>that we made that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>has been reported in the literature yet,</p>
<p>which is that Clomid was increasing levels of a sterol</p>
<p>that we also happened to measure called desmosterol.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not familiar with that.</p>
<p>So in the way that cholesterol is made,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made by, there&rsquo;s two pathways that make cholesterol.</p>
<p>So it starts with two carbon subunits, like acetyl-CoA,</p>
<p>and it kind of marches down a pathway, bifurcates,</p>
<p>and cholesterol is the finished product of both.</p>
<p>But in one of those pathways,</p>
<p>the molecule right before cholesterol is called desmosterol.</p>
<p>In the other pathway, it&rsquo;s called lethosterol.</p>
<p>So we constantly measure lethosterol and desmosterol</p>
<p>because we want to know how much cholesterol</p>
<p>is being synthesized in the body,</p>
<p>not just what your cholesterol is.</p>
<p>We wanna know how much cholesterol you reabsorb.</p>
<p>And those markers are really important to us</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re looking at cardiovascular disease risk.</p>
<p>So when we gave patients Clomid,</p>
<p>we were noticing a almost universal rise</p>
<p>in their desmosterol levels.</p>
<p>Now, the most obvious explanation for that,</p>
<p>though the last time I looked,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find clear explanation for this</p>
<p>in any of the clinical trials</p>
<p>that led to the approval of Clomid.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if it was described.</p>
<p>In fact, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t known.</p>
<p>I suspect it is inhibiting the enzyme,</p>
<p>which I think is called delta-24 desaturase</p>
<p>that turns desmosterol into cholesterol.</p>
<p>Makes sense if you inhibit that enzyme,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see a rise in desmosterol.</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t have been a concern to me</p>
<p>if not for the fact that Tom Dayspring,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the physicians we work with,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the world&rsquo;s experts in lipids,</p>
<p>pointed out a very obscure story,</p>
<p>which was that the very first drug ever approved</p>
<p>to treat cardiovascular disease,</p>
<p>at least to treat hypercholesterolemia,</p>
<p>was a drug that attacked the same enzyme.</p>
<p>So this was in the early 1960s, I believe,</p>
<p>maybe the mid-60s.</p>
<p>This drug was approved and it lowered cholesterol.</p>
<p>And it was approved on the basis of lowering cholesterol.</p>
<p>Now, today, no drug for ASCVD is approved</p>
<p>on the basis of it lowering cholesterol.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a high enough bar.</p>
<p>You have to reduce events.</p>
<p>You actually have to show</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re preventing heart attacks and death.</p>
<p>But at the time, it was like, hey, it lowers cholesterol,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be good.</p>
<p>Well, in the late 60s, it was pulled from the market</p>
<p>because events were going up.</p>
<p>So cholesterol was coming down, events were going up.</p>
<p>How could that be?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What we are suspecting is that desmosterol,</p>
<p>which is still a sterol, was potentially more damaging</p>
<p>and created more oxidative stress in the endothelium,</p>
<p>in the sub-endothelial space than cholesterol.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Which would at least suggest to us,</p>
<p>and again, we&rsquo;re taking a lot of leaps here,</p>
<p>that maybe having high desmosterol,</p>
<p>very high desmosterol, is not a good thing.</p>
<p>And so, once we kind of pieced all that together</p>
<p>a few years ago, we were like,</p>
<p>yeah, we&rsquo;re just not gonna prescribe clomid anymore.</p>
<p>And we then switched to HCG,</p>
<p>which we used to use sometimes instead of clomid,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more cumbersome to work with.</p>
<p>It needs to be refrigerated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a much more fragile molecule.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we talked about this once.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like if you accidentally</p>
<p>knock over the little bottle, it&rsquo;s basically gone bad.</p>
<p>Yeah. Travel with it</p>
<p>is very challenging. Can&rsquo;t travel with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a needle.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s an injection, sub-Q, so easy to administer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not IM or anything like that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just more of a hassle factor.</p>
<p>But that said, it has the benefit that clomid does,</p>
<p>which is it preserves testicular function.</p>
<p>It preserves testicular volume.</p>
<p>So, you know, bodybuilders will often use this</p>
<p>in their post-cycle therapy</p>
<p>as a way to kind of recover function.</p>
<p>And we would just use it now as ongoing therapy</p>
<p>for a guy who still has testicular reserve.</p>
<p>So on its own, no testosterone,</p>
<p>no aromatase inhibitor, nothing,</p>
<p>just a way to crank out a bit more testosterone</p>
<p>from the testes, maybe some additional estrogen also.</p>
<p>HCG is a different model.</p>
<p>HCG is just an analog of luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically like giving them luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna crush endogenous luteinizing hormone levels,</p>
<p>right, because it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Yeah, and you don&rsquo;t really see much of an impact on LH,</p>
<p>but you do see endogenous testosterone production go down.</p>
<p>Actually, no, I correct that.</p>
<p>Both FSH and LH will go down on a high enough dose.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Just as a mention in here, I&rsquo;m not making recommendations,</p>
<p>but one supplement I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about publicly</p>
<p>is Phytogeoagrestis, which is this weird Nigerian shrub</p>
<p>that does-</p>
<p>You talked about this on Tim&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>On Tim&rsquo;s podcast and Joe&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>And, you know, there was a bit of a backlash</p>
<p>because it does turn out that at high doses,</p>
<p>in rodent studies, it can cause some toxicity</p>
<p>to the testes.</p>
<p>But at lower doses,</p>
<p>it does seem to increase luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>And after talking about this,</p>
<p>a number of people went out there,</p>
<p>did pre and post blood work,</p>
<p>and the consistent effect seems to be an increase</p>
<p>in luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a noticeable effect on testicular size and volume.</p>
<p>So a lot of people take this and be like,</p>
<p>oh, you know, their balls are getting bigger.</p>
<p>And so they get all excited</p>
<p>that something good is happening.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know the long-term safety and efficacy</p>
<p>of something like Fidogio,</p>
<p>whether or not it needs to be cycled.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is why I&rsquo;m also very leery</p>
<p>of the supplements in this space,</p>
<p>because at least when we&rsquo;re using HCG or testosterone,</p>
<p>like we have so many years of data.</p>
<p>You have to remember how many women are using this stuff</p>
<p>for reproductive medicine.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think the FDA has a lot of faults.</p>
<p>I think I have an entire podcast devoted</p>
<p>to the corruption of the FDA</p>
<p>and all of the mistakes that have been made</p>
<p>with respect to their oversight in especially generic drugs.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s way more regulated than the wild, wild west</p>
<p>of nutty supplement land.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think that the reason for talking about things</p>
<p>like Tongad and Fidogio</p>
<p>was to provide some intermediate discussion</p>
<p>between doing all the correct things,</p>
<p>but no supplementation or hormone therapy,</p>
<p>and then going straight to hormone therapy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like the leap from,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t focus very well to Ritalin, right?</p>
<p>Without a real diagnosis of ADHD</p>
<p>to, oh, well, maybe some things like</p>
<p>alpha GPC low doses of nicotine, right?</p>
<p>But I agree entirely.</p>
<p>I mean, the sourcing is important.</p>
<p>The dosages are worked out empirically on an individual basis</p>
<p>and there aren&rsquo;t randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>There just aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, have kind of like a seven,</p>
<p>this is another Peter principle, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got a lot of patients that come into the practice</p>
<p>and, you know, during our intake,</p>
<p>we go through what drugs and supplements</p>
<p>are you taking right now?</p>
<p>And a lot of people come in, I&rsquo;m not taking anything, Peter.</p>
<p>I just, you&rsquo;re in charge now.</p>
<p>Like, tell me what you think.</p>
<p>And then you get a lot of people that come in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re gonna need an extra few pages</p>
<p>for this part of the documentation.</p>
<p>People who travel with a suitcase that you can hear</p>
<p>as they walk through the airport from all the pills.</p>
<p>So I give these patients a little homework exercise,</p>
<p>which is you have to answer these seven questions</p>
<p>for every supplement you take.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the spreadsheet and let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>And it basically just runs through,</p>
<p>like, you know, it&rsquo;s basically walking you through</p>
<p>the logic of why do you take this molecule?</p>
<p>And I think for many people,</p>
<p>when they do that, it&rsquo;s very sobering, right?</p>
<p>They kind of, a lot of them will come back and be like,</p>
<p>you know what, I don&rsquo;t think I can come up with any reason</p>
<p>along this really rigorous line of thinking</p>
<p>as to why I&rsquo;m taking 80% of this stuff.</p>
<p>Well, I know people,</p>
<p>and actually we know some of the same people</p>
<p>who are fanatic about, like, red light on the testes,</p>
<p>sunning their testes, putting ice packs on their testes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of all over the place.</p>
<p>The number of things that people are trying and doing</p>
<p>in order to increase testosterone output</p>
<p>from their testes is pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>And that said, among some of the women I know,</p>
<p>the number of things that they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to try and promote longevity and fertility,</p>
<p>and in particular skin health, hair health,</p>
<p>and nail health is also kind of outrageous.</p>
<p>Everything from collagen to red light therapies,</p>
<p>which may actually have some efficacy in certain cases,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a hunger there, right?</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>One of the things that I hope gets a lot more attention</p>
<p>is the use of rapamycin for preserving ovarian health.</p>
<p>So the animal literature on this is pretty impressive.</p>
<p>So in mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life.</p>
<p>And so it makes sense, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it totally makes sense</p>
<p>why the most potent geroprotective molecule we have</p>
<p>would also preserve and extend ovarian life,</p>
<p>at least in mice.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love to see the clinical trials done in women</p>
<p>to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>I definitely want to come back to this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a key thing.</p>
<p>I know that a lot of people are interested</p>
<p>in female fertility out there,</p>
<p>including their male partners.</p>
<p>So going back to,</p>
<p>so now I understand why you don&rsquo;t prescribe clomiphene</p>
<p>because of this potential dysmosterol link.</p>
<p>What about testosterone therapy?</p>
<p>So less frequent, lower doses,</p>
<p>less or no estrogen inhibition or aromatase inhibition.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only using an aromatase blocker</p>
<p>and we use aromatics when we do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to get that estradiol into the range we want.</p>
<p>I like to see it between 30 and 50.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sweet spot.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I would say like a third,</p>
<p>maybe not even a third,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say probably 20% of men require a microdose</p>
<p>of anastrozole to get into that range.</p>
<p>Most do not.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d rather err on the side of being a little high</p>
<p>than a little low.</p>
<p>So I never really want to be below 25.</p>
<p>If, unless sometimes it&rsquo;s just below 25 and it is,</p>
<p>it is what it is, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re suppressing it to below 25,</p>
<p>I never want to be in that zone.</p>
<p>And then yes, so TRT is ultimately,</p>
<p>giving testosterone cipionate is usually what we use.</p>
<p>Injectable, so as opposed to cream or pellet.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>I used to use pellets with women</p>
<p>for some who were really adamant</p>
<p>about the convenience of it.</p>
<p>But for a bunch of reasons, I just,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly not doing that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of pellets in men.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t control the dosage once it&rsquo;s in, right?</p>
<p>Well, even if you know the dose,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s obviously a problem.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think, there&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>between putting a pellet into a man and a woman.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re putting a estrogen pellet into a woman,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s that big.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re putting enough pellets into a man</p>
<p>for six months of testosterone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s two sums of pellets that are longer than my finger.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re putting like a V-shape.</p>
<p>Where are you putting this?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting it into the gluteal fat.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a more morbid procedure</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>I think if you know how to manage it,</p>
<p>you know, through sort of the injections.</p>
<p>Injections are no big deal.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, especially now if you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re having them do sub-Q injections anyway.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not IM.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using a five eighths inch</p>
<p>to a one inch 25 gauge needle,</p>
<p>which is about the smallest needle</p>
<p>you can push the oil through once to twice a week,</p>
<p>depending on, and by the way, if they&rsquo;re real needle fobs,</p>
<p>we use Ziosted, which is a preloaded pen.</p>
<p>And are you having all men take HCG</p>
<p>to maintain fertility and testicular size?</p>
<p>Only if they want to.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and by the way, we do not like to use TRT</p>
<p>in men who, we don&rsquo;t like to use testosterone specifically</p>
<p>in men who still want to maintain fertility.</p>
<p>We just steer them away from that.</p>
<p>Because total sperm count goes down.</p>
<p>Yeah, we just say, why risk it?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;d rather use HCG.</p>
<p>Just on its own.</p>
<p>Just wait, just wait till you&rsquo;re done reproducing.</p>
<p>Bank sperm, wait till you&rsquo;re done reproducing</p>
<p>before we go to testosterone.</p>
<p>What are some of the benefits</p>
<p>and what are some of the cautionary notes</p>
<p>with appropriate TRT,</p>
<p>meaning of the kind of contour</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about here,</p>
<p>a lower dose with the yes or no low estrogen control?</p>
<p>People, what generally people report,</p>
<p>how do they feel?</p>
<p>What does it allow them to do</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t do or feel before?</p>
<p>In terms of what are the markers to look for?</p>
<p>Is it LDL, blood pressure, water retention,</p>
<p>acne, those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Are there some other things as well?</p>
<p>Yeah, it depends on the doses, right?</p>
<p>I mean, again, we&rsquo;re using these in really low doses.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty rare that we&rsquo;d have a patient</p>
<p>on more than 100 milligrams a week of testosterone.</p>
<p>I think for comparison, like a bodybuilder</p>
<p>could easily take 500 to 1,000 during a high growth phase.</p>
<p>I know some of these guys, they go ballistic</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re doing moderate levels of testosterone,</p>
<p>so being eight, but they&rsquo;re also taking</p>
<p>Dianabol, Oxandrolone,</p>
<p>SARMs and a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>I mean, their stacks are kind of ridiculous.</p>
<p>I mean, no disrespect to that sport,</p>
<p>but I mean, people are dying like crazy in that sport</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outside of physiology.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think for 99% of people listening,</p>
<p>they just, they look, they hear bodybuilder</p>
<p>and they just get like, why would somebody do that anyway?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the typical response.</p>
<p>So the point is a lot of,</p>
<p>but we owe those guys a great deal of gratitude</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve shown us the boundaries.</p>
<p>Including the women.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so those bodybuilders have taught us a lot</p>
<p>about like what happens.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, the bloating, the water retention,</p>
<p>acne, hair loss, hair growth, all of those things,</p>
<p>we understand the truth of it is,</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t see those things in our patients.</p>
<p>But a hundred milligrams per week is a very low output.</p>
<p>My understanding is-</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a physiologic dose.</p>
<p>I mean, the reality of it is it&rsquo;s enough for most people.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s probably the highest we&rsquo;ve ever had to go</p>
<p>is maybe 70 twice a week.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the youngest patient you&rsquo;ve ever had to put on TRT?</p>
<p>Actual testosterone?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Probably, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about maybe 40.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s great for people to hear</p>
<p>because I know that a lot of guys in their 20s</p>
<p>are thinking TRT is the way to go.</p>
<p>And I would argue, unless you&rsquo;re doing everything else right</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re still hypogonadal and you&rsquo;re really struggling,</p>
<p>put that time off because also the fertility issue,</p>
<p>you want to delay, delay, delay.</p>
<p>Well, again, it depends if when we say TRT,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in your 20s and there&rsquo;s no other way,</p>
<p>I would hope you would be steered toward HCG</p>
<p>to at least preserve testicular function.</p>
<p>Now, again, we don&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>if after being on HCG for 10 years,</p>
<p>your pituitary will still work.</p>
<p>Right, you won&rsquo;t be able to make your own luteinizing.</p>
<p>Exactly, so it might be the case</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to need something upstream of that,</p>
<p>like Clomid to kickstart it.</p>
<p>But again, I don&rsquo;t want anybody who&rsquo;s listening to this</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s using Clomid for fertility</p>
<p>to think that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with it.</p>
<p>My concern over this became like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to be on this for 10 years,</p>
<p>is it problematic?</p>
<p>Not if you&rsquo;re using this for a course of IVF</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So again, if we felt that someone&rsquo;s pituitary</p>
<p>was not working, I would be happy to put three months</p>
<p>of Clomid on them to kind of try to see</p>
<p>if we could blast it back.</p>
<p>Do you have men cycle on and off testosterone</p>
<p>at these low dosages?</p>
<p>Are they taking a month vacation from it every once in a while?</p>
<p>Yeah, it totally depends.</p>
<p>You know, I was talking to a patient yesterday</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re going to do,</p>
<p>we just decided to change his cycle,</p>
<p>eight weeks on, then eight weeks on HCG,</p>
<p>eight weeks on, then eight weeks on HCG.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to be a cycle</p>
<p>that maintains his testosterone level,</p>
<p>but fluctuates between endogenous, exogenous,</p>
<p>endogenous, exogenous.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;ll just do testosterone on, off, on, off.</p>
<p>And there it&rsquo;s like, how much can he replenish naturally,</p>
<p>but understanding his T will dip during those off cycles.</p>
<p>Seems to me there&rsquo;s a tremendous incentive</p>
<p>for somebody to develop a molecule</p>
<p>that can directly target SHBG,</p>
<p>besides oxandrolone anamore, right?</p>
<p>If one could just drop SHBG, just the tiniest bit,</p>
<p>it seems like one could adjust the free T</p>
<p>in a way that would be great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that molecule is so hard to target,</p>
<p>but somebody ought to do it.</p>
<p>The chemistry can&rsquo;t be that hard.</p>
<p>I talked with Patrick Arnold about this</p>
<p>many, many years ago.</p>
<p>I wish I could remember what his idea,</p>
<p>he had a comment about this that at the time made sense,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t remember what it was,</p>
<p>because I had that thought too, like, man,</p>
<p>especially for that subset of guys</p>
<p>who have normal testosterone,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just overbinding it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad that you brought up this issue</p>
<p>of total testosterone versus free T.</p>
<p>And the reason is, ever since going on podcasts</p>
<p>and talking about this stuff,</p>
<p>and talking about it on this podcast,</p>
<p>people will send me their numbers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll send me their charts,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll send photos of themselves.</p>
<p>And I can tell you, while I&rsquo;m not a clinician</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t done fancy statistics on it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little correlation</p>
<p>between someone&rsquo;s absolute testosterone and how they appear.</p>
<p>I mean, some of these guys look really lean, really strong,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll say, oh, total testosterone is 550, 480, right?</p>
<p>And then other people, you know, testosterone is 860,</p>
<p>but you look at them and you think,</p>
<p>oh, they kind of have a kind of a doughy look to them.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s got to be this free testosterone thing,</p>
<p>plus estrogen, et cetera.</p>
<p>Well, but also training and nutrition too, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I just think, I think for all this talk</p>
<p>about testosterone, which I enjoy talking about,</p>
<p>and I enjoy talking about the data</p>
<p>on long-term health consequences of testosterone,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s another controversial topic,</p>
<p>I also think people kind of overstate its importance.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a group of people who think,</p>
<p>if I could just fix my testosterone,</p>
<p>everything will be better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of like, no, actually that&rsquo;s not true at all.</p>
<p>Really, the only purpose in my mind of fixing testosterone</p>
<p>is to give you the capacity to work harder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really going to help you recover</p>
<p>more from your workouts.</p>
<p>This should just give you a greater ability</p>
<p>to experience muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>So, you know, if I just give you a bunch of testosterone</p>
<p>and you sit on the couch and your nutrition doesn&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not exercising anymore,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna experience any benefits of this thing.</p>
<p>I mean, my testosterone level has fluctuated</p>
<p>quite a bit throughout my life.</p>
<p>And when I think about, as an adult,</p>
<p>not sort of including when I was sort of</p>
<p>a fanatical teenager, but as an adult,</p>
<p>when was I at my absolute most insane physique?</p>
<p>Like my best performance on a DEXA scan</p>
<p>would have been 30, I was 38 years old.</p>
<p>By DEXA, I was 7% body fat.</p>
<p>My fat-free mass index was like 23.2,</p>
<p>23.3 kilograms per meter squared.</p>
<p>I mean, I was huge, strong, and totally ripped.</p>
<p>My testosterone was in the toilet.</p>
<p>I was overtraining like crazy.</p>
<p>I was, you know, exercising probably 26 hours a week,</p>
<p>killing it in the gym, swimming like a banshee,</p>
<p>cycling like my life depended on it,</p>
<p>grossly overtrained, low T, but, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, physically looked like twice the guy I am today.</p>
<p>You know, today my T&rsquo;s probably twice as high</p>
<p>as it was then.</p>
<p>So, you know, now you could say,</p>
<p>well, Peter, what if you took T back then?</p>
<p>How much better could you have been?</p>
<p>Sure, but again, I think the take home</p>
<p>is just giving somebody T doesn&rsquo;t do much of anything.</p>
<p>It probably helps on the insulin resistance front</p>
<p>without any other thing, but to me, that&rsquo;s a waste.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s squandering the gift that it is giving you,</p>
<p>which is the ability to do more work</p>
<p>and, you know, capture the benefit of it</p>
<p>via muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>I agree, and I think that the psychological effect</p>
<p>of testosterone, whether or not it&rsquo;s exogenous</p>
<p>or endogenous, is it makes effort feel good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At some level, it really seems to do that.</p>
<p>And Sapolsky tells me the main reason,</p>
<p>or mechanistically, the main reason that it can do that</p>
<p>is by adjusting levels of activity in the amygdala.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s some interesting imaging there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to chat more about the cholesterol pathway.</p>
<p>And I know this is a huge landscape as well,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re doing a good job of diving in deep,</p>
<p>but not getting stuck in the underlying currents at all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tremendous debate about whether or not</p>
<p>dietary cholesterol directly relates to,</p>
<p>or does not relate to serum cholesterol, LDL and HDL.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my-</p>
<p>Is there?</p>
<p>I think, well, let me put it this way.</p>
<p>There are people that argue, I&rsquo;m certainly not arguing,</p>
<p>there are people that argue that</p>
<p>if one eats a ton of saturated fat,</p>
<p>that LDL goes up and HDL goes down.</p>
<p>Okay, but that&rsquo;s not dietary cholesterol per se.</p>
<p>No, not dietary cholesterol per se.</p>
<p>And then there are people that argue that</p>
<p>any increase in saturated fat intake is going to be bad,</p>
<p>that you already synthesize enough cholesterol</p>
<p>for hormone production, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about this in terms of</p>
<p>how one should read their charts.</p>
<p>My LDL is in what I&rsquo;m told is healthy range.</p>
<p>My HDL is in what I&rsquo;m told is healthy range.</p>
<p>I do try and not overeat things like</p>
<p>butter, cheese and red meat,</p>
<p>but I do eat some of those things and I feel pretty good.</p>
<p>But most people are operating under the assumption</p>
<p>that eating saturated fat is bad</p>
<p>and you only do it insofar as you want to taste it.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s a small group of people</p>
<p>that love to eat organs and meats</p>
<p>and really pack cholesterol and would argue that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if your LDL is 870,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to impact your health.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol,</p>
<p>saturated fat, at least in your view?</p>
<p>So first let&rsquo;s differentiate between cholesterol and fat</p>
<p>just for the listener, because we use them,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make sure people understand.</p>
<p>So cholesterol is a really complicated molecule.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a ringed molecule.</p>
<p>God, I used to know exactly what its structure was,</p>
<p>but like it could have 36 carbons for all I remember.</p>
<p>It is a lipid, so it is a hydrophobic molecule</p>
<p>that is synthesized by every cell in the human body.</p>
<p>It is so important that without it,</p>
<p>if you look at sort of genetic conditions</p>
<p>that impair cholesterol synthesis,</p>
<p>depending on their severity, they can be fatal in utero.</p>
<p>So in other words, anything that really interferes</p>
<p>with our ability to produce cholesterol</p>
<p>is a threat to us as a species.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is cholesterol makes up</p>
<p>the cell membrane of every cell in our body.</p>
<p>So as you know, but maybe the listeners don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>even though a cell is a spherical thing,</p>
<p>it has to be fluid, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a rigid sphere, like a blow up ball, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be able to kind of move in this way</p>
<p>to mesh with other cells.</p>
<p>It also has to accommodate having porous structures</p>
<p>that traverse its membrane to allow ions</p>
<p>and things like that to go across.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s cholesterol that gives the fluidity</p>
<p>to that membrane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, as you&rsquo;re alluding to,</p>
<p>the backbone of some of the most important hormones</p>
<p>in our body, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,</p>
<p>cortisol, so we have this thing, super important, okay.</p>
<p>Then let&rsquo;s talk about does cholesterol,</p>
<p>can you get cholesterol in your diet?</p>
<p>Yes, you can eat foods that are rich in cholesterol.</p>
<p>What was known in 1960,</p>
<p>but somehow escaped everybody&rsquo;s imagination</p>
<p>until finally the American Heart Association</p>
<p>acknowledged this a few years ago,</p>
<p>is that the cholesterol you eat</p>
<p>does not really make it into your body.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is it&rsquo;s esterified.</p>
<p>So we have, and not to get too nerdy,</p>
<p>but I think people, I think if,</p>
<p>I really think it&rsquo;s important people understand</p>
<p>how this thing works.</p>
<p>So we have cells in our gut and enterocytes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the endothelial cells of our gut.</p>
<p>They have, each one of them has basically</p>
<p>two transporters on them.</p>
<p>So the first is called the Niemann-Pick</p>
<p>C1-Like-1 transporter.</p>
<p>The second is called the ATP binding cassette G5-G8.</p>
<p>Okay, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like-1 transporter</p>
<p>will bring in any sterol,</p>
<p>cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol,</p>
<p>any sterol that fits through the door will come in.</p>
<p>Virtually all of that is the cholesterol we produce</p>
<p>that gets taken back to the liver</p>
<p>that the liver packages in bile and secretes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what aids in our digestion,</p>
<p>which is another thing I should have mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>In addition to using cholesterol</p>
<p>for cell membranes and hormones,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to digest our food without cholesterol</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s what makes up the bile salts.</p>
<p>So our own cholesterol is basically recirculated</p>
<p>in a pool throughout our body,</p>
<p>and this is the way it gets back into the body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s through this Niemann-Pick C1-Like-1 transporter.</p>
<p>When it gets in there, the body,</p>
<p>this is the checkpoint of regulation.</p>
<p>This is where the body says,</p>
<p>do you have enough cholesterol in the body, yes or no?</p>
<p>If yes, I will let that cholesterol</p>
<p>make its way into the circulation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll go off the basolateral side of the cell,</p>
<p>not the luminal side, into the body.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the body says,</p>
<p>you know what, we have enough cholesterol.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna let you poop this out,</p>
<p>and now the ATP binding cassette will shoot it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll go back into the luminal side, and away it goes.</p>
<p>So all of the cholesterol in our body is not esterified,</p>
<p>meaning it doesn&rsquo;t have that big,</p>
<p>bulky side chain attached to it.</p>
<p>The cholesterol you eat is esterified,</p>
<p>and an esterified cholesterol molecule</p>
<p>simply can&rsquo;t physically pass</p>
<p>through that Niemann-Pick C1-Like-1 transporter.</p>
<p>Now, we probably manage to de-esterify</p>
<p>10 to 15% of our dietary cholesterol.</p>
<p>So in other words, there are small amounts</p>
<p>of dietary cholesterol that do make their way</p>
<p>into our circulation,</p>
<p>but it represents a small fraction</p>
<p>of our total body&rsquo;s pool of cholesterol.</p>
<p>Again, this was known even by Ancel Keys,</p>
<p>the guy who turned fat</p>
<p>into the biggest boogeyman of all time.</p>
<p>Ancel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Dietary cholesterol plays no role in serum cholesterol.</p>
<p>Again, it took the American Heart Association</p>
<p>another 60 years to figure that out,</p>
<p>but even now they acknowledge that.</p>
<p>Dietary cholesterol has no bearing.</p>
<p>So why is it that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to find studies,</p>
<p>or at least people who are highly credentialed</p>
<p>from good institutions,</p>
<p>claiming that eating saturated fat,</p>
<p>cheese and- Saturated fat&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Saturated fat, red meat,</p>
<p>things that are rich in cholesterol,</p>
<p>to be more specific,</p>
<p>is bad for us in terms of our eventual LDL.</p>
<p>So this is two different things.</p>
<p>So saturated fat consumption in many people</p>
<p>will raise LDL cholesterol.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to differentiate between the-</p>
<p>What is saturated fat?</p>
<p>So saturated fat, of course, is a fatty acid,</p>
<p>just so people understand.</p>
<p>Totally different molecule from cholesterol.</p>
<p>Cholesterol is this very complicated ring structure,</p>
<p>multiple rings stuck together.</p>
<p>SFA, saturated fat, is just a long-chain fatty acid</p>
<p>that is fully saturated, meaning it has no double bonds,</p>
<p>and it can exist in isolation,</p>
<p>it can exist in a triglyceride, triacylglyceride,</p>
<p>or a phospholipid, or all sorts of things like that.</p>
<p>So when we eat foods that contain fat,</p>
<p>basically there are three distinctions for that fat.</p>
<p>Is it saturated?</p>
<p>Is it monounsaturated, one double bond?</p>
<p>Or is it polyunsaturated, two or more double bonds?</p>
<p>The observation that eating saturated fat</p>
<p>raises cholesterol is generally correct.</p>
<p>But again, now it makes-</p>
<p>Because if we&rsquo;re gonna start talking about LDL,</p>
<p>we have to explain what LDL is.</p>
<p>This is another one of those things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just so grossly misunderstood</p>
<p>that it makes having discussions about this</p>
<p>very complicated.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the cholesterol problem.</p>
<p>So every cell in our body makes cholesterol,</p>
<p>and almost without exception, they make enough.</p>
<p>There are a handful of times, however,</p>
<p>when a cell needs to borrow cholesterol from another cell.</p>
<p>Okay, so how would you do this?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re playing God for a minute</p>
<p>and you wanna design a system,</p>
<p>you have to be able to transport cholesterol</p>
<p>from one cell to another.</p>
<p>The most logical place you would transport this</p>
<p>is through the circulation.</p>
<p>And the problem with circulation is it&rsquo;s water.</p>
<p>Plasma is water.</p>
<p>So now you have this problem,</p>
<p>which is I want to transport cargo</p>
<p>that is hydrophobic in a hydrophilic medium.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So if you think about all the things</p>
<p>that we transport in our blood,</p>
<p>sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re water-soluble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>They just move back and forth in our blood with no chaperone.</p>
<p>But when you wanna move cholesterol,</p>
<p>you have to package it in something that&rsquo;s hydrophilic.</p>
<p>That something is called a lipoprotein.</p>
<p>So we have these spherical molecules</p>
<p>that are lipid on the inside,</p>
<p>protein on the outside, lipoprotein.</p>
<p>And inside they contain cholesterol and triglycerides.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got the spherical thing,</p>
<p>triglyceride, cholesterol on the inside,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s chaperoned by a hydrophilic molecule</p>
<p>that allows it to move through our circulation.</p>
<p>And those lipoproteins exist in different densities.</p>
<p>So if you run these out on a gel electrophoresis plate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll identify different densities.</p>
<p>The density is a function of how much protein</p>
<p>and how much lipid is in it.</p>
<p>So the highest density of this</p>
<p>is called a high-density lipoprotein.</p>
<p>And the lowest density of this</p>
<p>is called a very low-density lipoprotein, a VLDL.</p>
<p>And then next to that, you have an LDL,</p>
<p>a low-density lipoprotein.</p>
<p>And then next to that, you have an IDL,</p>
<p>an intermediate-density lipoprotein.</p>
<p>So it actually goes VLDL, IDL, LDL.</p>
<p>But anyway, so when people say my LDL is high,</p>
<p>or my LDL is 100, what are they saying?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying the cholesterol concentration</p>
<p>of my LDL particles is 100 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>So the total cholesterol concentration</p>
<p>you have in your circulation</p>
<p>is that number that says total cholesterol.</p>
<p>So if someone&rsquo;s blood panel says my total cholesterol&rsquo;s 200,</p>
<p>it means that if you take all the lipoproteins</p>
<p>in their circulation, bust them open,</p>
<p>and measure the cholesterol content,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 200 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>And for all intents and purposes,</p>
<p>because the IDLs are so short-lived,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically the sum of your LDL cholesterol,</p>
<p>your VLDL cholesterol, and your HDL cholesterol.</p>
<p>Those three things sum to your total cholesterol.</p>
<p>What about LDL-a that you mentioned earlier?</p>
<p>LP-a is another, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s another actor.</p>
<p>He is a special type of LDL that, again,</p>
<p>in sort of 10 to 20% of the population</p>
<p>is a really bad actor.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an LDL that has another apolipoprotein on it</p>
<p>called apolipoprotein little a.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;ll just say on this,</p>
<p>because earlier I mentioned APO-B,</p>
<p>there are two broad families of lipoproteins.</p>
<p>There are those that are wrapped in APO-Bs</p>
<p>and those that are wrapped in APO-As.</p>
<p>The APO-A family is the HDL family.</p>
<p>The APO-B family is the VLDL, IDL, LDL family.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So for somebody who, let&rsquo;s say their total cholesterol is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just stay with 200 for simplicity,</p>
<p>what do you like to see in terms of the HDL, LDL ratio?</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p>
<p>I only care about APO-B.</p>
<p>I only care about APO-B.</p>
<p>I care about the causative agent of atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>APO-B is the thing that drives atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>And what levels are attractive or repulsive for you</p>
<p>when you see levels of APO-B that are blank,</p>
<p>you get really concerned?</p>
<p>It depends on the person&rsquo;s objectives.</p>
<p>So again, we take a very different view.</p>
<p>I mean, we have-</p>
<p>Vitality now, and I want to live to be 100.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m becoming some taper.</p>
<p>If you tell me you want to live to be 100,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need to keep your APO-B</p>
<p>below 30 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I want to live to be 100, but I also,</p>
<p>well, how about I don&rsquo;t care how long I live,</p>
<p>but I want to feel great while I live.</p>
<p>Again, it depends, right?</p>
<p>Like anybody who&rsquo;s had a heart attack</p>
<p>is going to be compromised in their ability</p>
<p>to feel well after, right?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>I guess I make, say it that way,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re going to tell me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m in order to achieve that live to 100 level,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to give up my personal life</p>
<p>and my brain functioning,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m not really interested in it.</p>
<p>Sure, but to get LDL levels,</p>
<p>and really, again, people think of it as LDL.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really APO-B, right?</p>
<p>APO-B is this total concentration of LDL and VLDL.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what matters.</p>
<p>Those are the big atherogenic particles.</p>
<p>LDL also includes the LP little a,</p>
<p>although the concentration of LP little a</p>
<p>is relatively speaking so small</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t generally show up as much in the APO-B.</p>
<p>So we treat APO-B,</p>
<p>and basically what it comes down to is</p>
<p>you want APO-B to be as close to the level</p>
<p>as it was when you were born.</p>
<p>So we start developing heart disease when we&rsquo;re born.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>The autopsy studies make this abundantly clear.</p>
<p>When you look at autopsies of young people</p>
<p>who are dying in their 20s,</p>
<p>and this was first done in the 1970s,</p>
<p>it was again repeated.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s always done after we have a war, right?</p>
<p>So in the 1970s, it was done on people who died in Vietnam.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, it was done on mostly young men,</p>
<p>but some young women who were dying in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And we saw without any ambiguity</p>
<p>that cardiovascular disease is already taking hold</p>
<p>in people who are 18, 19, 20 years old.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And to be clear,</p>
<p>they aren&rsquo;t gonna die of atherosclerosis at that age.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still 40, 50 years away from it,</p>
<p>but this is a lifelong disease.</p>
<p>And we also know that the disease can&rsquo;t really develop</p>
<p>until APO-B reaches a certain threshold.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the threshold that most of us get to</p>
<p>by the time we&rsquo;re sort of in our teens.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this really young APO-B level</p>
<p>of kind of 20 to 30 milligrams per deciliter</p>
<p>that makes it impossible to get atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>So APO-B is necessary,</p>
<p>but not sufficient to develop ASCVD.</p>
<p>Now that, go ahead.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I was just gonna ask,</p>
<p>what are some of the top behavioral,</p>
<p>nutritional, supplementation, if any,</p>
<p>based and prescription drug based ways to target APO-B?</p>
<p>Well, nutritionally,</p>
<p>you basically have two big tools, right?</p>
<p>And it depends on what&rsquo;s driving up APO-B.</p>
<p>So APO-B, remember,</p>
<p>is the concentration of LDL and VLDL particles.</p>
<p>And what do they carry?</p>
<p>Cholesterol and triglycerides.</p>
<p>So anything that reduces cholesterol</p>
<p>and reduces triglycerides is going to reduce APO-B.</p>
<p>Triglycerides are generally driven by carbohydrate intake.</p>
<p>So more insulin resistance,</p>
<p>more carbohydrate intake, more triglycerides.</p>
<p>So we, I mean, clinically,</p>
<p>this is readily apparent to anyone who treats patients.</p>
<p>If you restrict carbohydrates,</p>
<p>you will reduce triglycerides.</p>
<p>That just happens all day long.</p>
<p>But if you reduce triglycerides</p>
<p>by raising fat intake so much,</p>
<p>it can still raise APO-B.</p>
<p>So you have to be able to think about it.</p>
<p>So in an ideal world, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>can you lower saturated fat,</p>
<p>which tends to be the one that is most driving APO-B,</p>
<p>while lowering carbohydrate,</p>
<p>and then see what you can get.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the reality of it is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nobody with dietary intervention</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to get to a level</p>
<p>of 30 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never seen any.</p>
<p>Pure dietary intervention.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what are the other things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be pharmacologic at this point.</p>
<p>Statin type interventions?</p>
<p>Well, now you have multiple classes of drugs.</p>
<p>So the tried and true is the statin.</p>
<p>So statins work by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis.</p>
<p>And the net effect of that is that the,</p>
<p>so the liver is really sensitive to cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t want too much.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t want too little.</p>
<p>When you inhibit cholesterol synthesis,</p>
<p>the liver says, I want more cholesterol.</p>
<p>So it puts more LDL receptors on its surface,</p>
<p>and it pulls the LDL out of circulation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what lowers the LDL in the circulation.</p>
<p>So again, nine statins in use today.</p>
<p>We typically use four of them.</p>
<p>The side effect profile,</p>
<p>contrary to kind of all the sort of statin hating propaganda</p>
<p>out there, very benign, right?</p>
<p>5% of people experience muscle soreness,</p>
<p>which reverses upon cessation.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Cognitive effects?</p>
<p>Again, I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>in terms of actual comparing it at a placebo,</p>
<p>no effect whatsoever, right?</p>
<p>So does that mean that you put a patient on it,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t complain of something?</p>
<p>No, but if you look at clinical trials,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no evidence whatsoever</p>
<p>that statins impair cognition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also no evidence in clinical trials</p>
<p>that they accelerate the risk of neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>Now we will, there&rsquo;s a very nuanced case we make,</p>
<p>Andrew, which is we&rsquo;ll look at patients</p>
<p>with highly suppressed desmosterol levels,</p>
<p>we will back off.</p>
<p>We do want to maintain desmosterol above a certain level</p>
<p>because of some evidence that is still,</p>
<p>I think, very preliminary,</p>
<p>but enough for us that we say, why take the chance?</p>
<p>We have so many other tools to lower cholesterol.</p>
<p>Why would we over suppress synthesis</p>
<p>in a susceptible individual?</p>
<p>So the next tool you look at is a drug</p>
<p>that blocks the absorption or the reabsorption</p>
<p>of cholesterol.</p>
<p>Remember that Neiman-Pixie one-like-one transporter?</p>
<p>So that guy has a drug called ezetimibe</p>
<p>that just mechanically blocks it.</p>
<p>So in people, and that&rsquo;s why I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>we measure all those sterols in people.</p>
<p>So we also measure things called phytosterols,</p>
<p>and the phytosterols give us an indication</p>
<p>of how active that transporter is.</p>
<p>So the higher your phytosterols,</p>
<p>the more likely you are to respond to ezetimibe.</p>
<p>Next class of drugs is a drug</p>
<p>that blocks cholesterol synthesis, but only in the liver.</p>
<p>So the statin does it globally.</p>
<p>This other drug called benpedoic acid</p>
<p>does it only in the liver.</p>
<p>So it has a very similar mechanism to statins,</p>
<p>different enzyme, not quite as potent,</p>
<p>but way fewer side effects.</p>
<p>So any patient that&rsquo;s having a response to statins</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s adverse will try this other thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it called one more time?</p>
<p>Benpedoic acid.</p>
<p>Benpedoic acid.</p>
<p>The most potent drug of the lot is the PCSK9 inhibitor.</p>
<p>So PCSK9 is a protein that was discovered</p>
<p>in the late 90s, I believe,</p>
<p>is responsible for the degradation of LDL receptors.</p>
<p>This was first discovered in people</p>
<p>who had a condition called familial hypercholesterolemia,</p>
<p>or FH.</p>
<p>So these are people that have incredibly high cholesterol.</p>
<p>Typically, their total cholesterol level is 300.</p>
<p>Their LDL cholesterol is typically, you know,</p>
<p>north of 200 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>This is a disease that is defined by the phenotype,</p>
<p>not the genotype.</p>
<p>So the phenotype has a very clear definition,</p>
<p>which I basically just gave you.</p>
<p>The genotype is there&rsquo;s a million paths to get there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s over 3,000 mutations</p>
<p>that are known to produce that phenotype.</p>
<p>This was discovered to be one of them.</p>
<p>In people who had hyperfunctioning PCSK9,</p>
<p>this protein was just constantly hammering</p>
<p>and destroying the LDL receptors.</p>
<p>And so their LDL would be huge.</p>
<p>And by extension, their total cholesterol would be.</p>
<p>So in 2006, Helen Hobbs and colleagues</p>
<p>discovered an opposite group of population,</p>
<p>people who had LDL cholesterol naturally</p>
<p>of 10 to 20 milligrams per deciliter,</p>
<p>which would be an ApoB of about 20 milligrams per deciliter,</p>
<p>and who never got heart disease.</p>
<p>They were immune to heart disease,</p>
<p>no matter how long they live.</p>
<p>And they had the opposite.</p>
<p>They had hypofunctioning PCSK9.</p>
<p>And so that was 2006, the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>That basically got a whole bunch of drug companies</p>
<p>hot on the trail of producing a drug to mimic it.</p>
<p>So now we have these antibodies,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wildly effective.</p>
<p>What percentage of your patients over 45</p>
<p>do you have on either a statin</p>
<p>or on one of these other classifiers?</p>
<p>Well, often it&rsquo;s in combinations, and I would say 80%.</p>
<p>Eight zero?</p>
<p>Well, you have to remember what our objective is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the business of trying to make sure</p>
<p>people live as long as possible.</p>
<p>And you have to take a sort of worldview of this, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most prevalent cause of death globally?</p>
<p>Is it cardiovascular disease?</p>
<p>Yeah, and how close is it?</p>
<p>So the last year before COVID,</p>
<p>COVID kind of messes up these numbers a little bit,</p>
<p>but if you go to 2019,</p>
<p>18.6 million people died of heart disease.</p>
<p>Number two, cancer, 10 million.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s in the zip code of atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>And if you remember what I just said,</p>
<p>if you took everybody in their 20s</p>
<p>and reduced them to a level of that of a child,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d make ASCVD an orphan disease.</p>
<p>So the question is, can you do that?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we hear more about this?</p>
<p>I realize there&rsquo;s some nuance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not straightforward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as simple as saying,</p>
<p>eat less cheese, red meat, and watch your LDL.</p>
<p>Get on a statin.</p>
<p>But why do we hear so little about ApoB</p>
<p>in the general discussion?</p>
<p>Social media is such a skewed landscape, as we know.</p>
<p>People shouting into tunnels of varying clarity.</p>
<p>Some are beautiful bronze tunnels with clean walls,</p>
<p>and others are sewer lines.</p>
<p>And they all converge in the same place, as we know.</p>
<p>But why do we hear so little about this?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not on a statin,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m beginning to think</p>
<p>that maybe that might be a good idea to consider,</p>
<p>one of these other compounds.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the last time I looked at my ApoB specifically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing my physician did.</p>
<p>But why don&rsquo;t we hear more about this?</p>
<p>This sounds so important.</p>
<p>It sounds like the most important conversation,</p>
<p>because all the hormone stuff,</p>
<p>and all the stuff about smoking,</p>
<p>and head injuries, and ADHD, and all the rest,</p>
<p>I mean, is irrelevant if you&rsquo;re dead, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have a great insight</p>
<p>as to why this isn&rsquo;t more front and center.</p>
<p>I think the bigger problem is,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we even understand how to think about it?</p>
<p>I mean, and there&rsquo;s a whole chapter in my book</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on that really gets to this problem,</p>
<p>of why aren&rsquo;t we looking at atherosclerosis</p>
<p>in terms of treating the causative agent?</p>
<p>Instead, we look at modifying 10-year risk.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the fundamental difference</p>
<p>between what I call medicine 2.0 and medicine 3.0.</p>
<p>Medicine 2.0, which is what we&rsquo;re generally practicing today,</p>
<p>when it comes to ASCBD, says, look, we will treat you.</p>
<p>We will lower that LDL cholesterol.</p>
<p>They still don&rsquo;t talk about ApoB,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a very American thing.</p>
<p>If you go outside of the United States,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s talking about ApoB.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the guidelines in Europe and Canada,</p>
<p>and everywhere else.</p>
<p>The United States is very stubborn on this,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s due to a couple of really weird personalities</p>
<p>in the lipid world.</p>
<p>But the paradigm is,</p>
<p>when your 10-year risk reaches 5%,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a 5% chance</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna have a heart attack, stroke, or die</p>
<p>in the next 10 years, now it&rsquo;s time to treat you.</p>
<p>Medicine 3.0 says, that&rsquo;s not the way to think about it.</p>
<p>You treat the causative agent.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a causative agent, you treat it.</p>
<p>If blood pressure raises the risk of heart disease,</p>
<p>you lower blood pressure.</p>
<p>If smoking raises the risk of something, you treat smoking.</p>
<p>And the reason that the risk model is so bad</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking at 10-year risk</p>
<p>is age is the biggest driver of risk.</p>
<p>I mean, bar none, right?</p>
<p>So if you take a 70-year-old with perfect lipids</p>
<p>and perfect blood pressure and perfect everything,</p>
<p>their 10-year risk of ASCVD</p>
<p>is probably four to five times higher</p>
<p>than the most unhealthy 30-year-old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even close.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot like eye disease.</p>
<p>There are exceptions, of course,</p>
<p>but you always say that the biggest risk factor</p>
<p>for going blind from glaucoma is being an older person,</p>
<p>frankly.</p>
<p>Right, so if you could identify</p>
<p>what the risk factors are for glaucoma,</p>
<p>imagine if the paradigm was,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only gonna treat it</p>
<p>when your risk of blindness reaches 5%,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t triggered until you&rsquo;re old enough anyway.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather know that when you&rsquo;re 30</p>
<p>and say, wait, if maybe being in the sun without sunglasses</p>
<p>or using this type of eyedrop or something like that</p>
<p>has a negative impact, I would rather know that sooner.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the fundamental difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a philosophical difference with respect to prevention.</p>
<p>And I will acknowledge that in one element of prevention,</p>
<p>I make no consideration.</p>
<p>I am only coming at this</p>
<p>through the lens of the individual.</p>
<p>I am never coming at this through the lens of society.</p>
<p>That makes my life easier</p>
<p>and it makes the problem I&rsquo;m solving easier.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to answer</p>
<p>the quality-adjusted-life-year problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to ask the question,</p>
<p>is it economical to treat people at 30?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question.</p>
<p>But I also know that when you&rsquo;re trying to solve</p>
<p>really complicated problems,</p>
<p>the more you can simplify, the better.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve just acknowledged openly, not solving that.</p>
<p>If you wanna criticize me for it, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be transparent.</p>
<p>But all I care about is the person I&rsquo;m sitting across from.</p>
<p>And in that situation, it&rsquo;s really their decision</p>
<p>if they can justify the cost of treatment.</p>
<p>An esoteric question and then a less esoteric question.</p>
<p>The esoteric question relates to something</p>
<p>that I think is a little bit niche, but not necessarily so,</p>
<p>which is peptides and stem cells and PRP.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna go off on too much of a tangent on rehab,</p>
<p>but I know you&rsquo;ve done a number of posts</p>
<p>on social media recently that were,</p>
<p>I have to just tell you, are really thoughtful</p>
<p>and I really appreciate that you&rsquo;re willing</p>
<p>to share your own tissue rehabilitation experience</p>
<p>and point people that because this is a landscape</p>
<p>that a lot of people are in</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know how to navigate it.</p>
<p>And a mutual friend of ours, not to be named,</p>
<p>sent me a text and said, I&rsquo;m gonna be talking to Atiya</p>
<p>and what do you know about studies</p>
<p>on things like BPC-157, this gastric peptide,</p>
<p>that anecdotally, again, anecdotally,</p>
<p>people report getting injections of this</p>
<p>in the shoulder, knee, et cetera,</p>
<p>and feeling so much better, so much faster,</p>
<p>but there really aren&rsquo;t good studies, controlled studies.</p>
<p>And you hear all the same sorts of things</p>
<p>about platelet-rich plasma, PRP,</p>
<p>which if someone tells you there are a lot of stem cells</p>
<p>in them, they&rsquo;re lying.</p>
<p>There are not a lot of stem cells in them.</p>
<p>And you also hear about stem cells,</p>
<p>which are not FDA approved, at least for most uses</p>
<p>in this country, but are certainly,</p>
<p>people are flying down to Columbia and getting injections.</p>
<p>And what is your understanding or experience</p>
<p>with things like BPC-157, specifically,</p>
<p>because peptides is a huge landscape,</p>
<p>we should probably do a whole episode on peptides.</p>
<p>Things like PRP, PRP is now approved for,</p>
<p>I mean, women are getting injections of this</p>
<p>into their ovaries to improve follicle count.</p>
<p>People are getting injections of PRP</p>
<p>into every tissue and organ.</p>
<p>Hell, men are getting injected into their penis,</p>
<p>so I hear, for all sorts of reasons that are unclear to me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the deal with PRP, BPC-157, and stem cells?</p>
<p>Do you ever see interesting effects?</p>
<p>Are you curious about these compounds?</p>
<p>Do you prescribe or direct people towards these?</p>
<p>The FDA approved ones, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, so short answer is I&rsquo;m definitely curious about them,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d love to see the work done,</p>
<p>but I also think this is about</p>
<p>as wild, wild west as it gets.</p>
<p>PRP, less so, but certainly stem cells and peptides.</p>
<p>And I just think,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna do something without a clinical trial,</p>
<p>you gotta show up with a lot more data, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s use rapamycin as an example, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge proponent of rapamycin,</p>
<p>and you can say, well, Peter,</p>
<p>how can you take or prescribe rapamycin</p>
<p>for geroprotective effects</p>
<p>when we do not have a human clinical trial</p>
<p>demonstrating that it lengthens life?</p>
<p>And the answer is, because I have 84 other pieces of data</p>
<p>that all point in the same direction</p>
<p>across every model organism</p>
<p>going back more than a billion years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really different from,</p>
<p>Joey, Sammy, and Sally did this thing,</p>
<p>and I think it works.</p>
<p>And they just can&rsquo;t be compared.</p>
<p>Now, I have no idea if stem cells work.</p>
<p>I have no idea if BPC-157 works.</p>
<p>I have no idea, frankly, if PRP even works,</p>
<p>though it might seem to have some efficacy</p>
<p>and some indications.</p>
<p>For example, maybe when it comes to early hair loss,</p>
<p>maybe when it comes to certain joint issues.</p>
<p>But the reality of it is,</p>
<p>I think we just have to accept the fact</p>
<p>that everything we do has an opportunity cost,</p>
<p>and that opportunity cost is sometimes financial,</p>
<p>but I actually find a lot of times</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in time and effort and energy</p>
<p>that goes into something.</p>
<p>Now, when I was waiting to get my shoulder surgery,</p>
<p>this is an injury that I&rsquo;ve had forever, right?</p>
<p>This is an injury, this injury was actually</p>
<p>probably the greatest source of discomfort</p>
<p>I had swimming the Catalina Channel the last time in 2009.</p>
<p>So that tells you how long I&rsquo;ve had this injury.</p>
<p>But I sort of knew at some point,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to have it fixed.</p>
<p>And I sort of went down this rabbit hole,</p>
<p>like, hey, is there anything I can do</p>
<p>to avoid having surgery?</p>
<p>Would infusing a million stem cells into it work?</p>
<p>And in speaking with as many orthopedic surgeons as I could,</p>
<p>the answer was kind of unambiguously, no.</p>
<p>And by the way, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you wouldn&rsquo;t feel better</p>
<p>if I injected a bunch of stem cells into your shoulder.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons that might make you feel better,</p>
<p>just like there are a bunch of reasons you can feel better</p>
<p>if somebody injects saline directly into your joint.</p>
<p>So the question is,</p>
<p>is it going to fix the underlying problem?</p>
<p>And if so, will it do so by what mechanism?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty sure that if you took 1,000 people</p>
<p>with my particular injury and injected them with stem cells,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t do a thing because of the nature of my injury.</p>
<p>I had a complete labral tear.</p>
<p>Are there some injuries that might benefit from it?</p>
<p>Yeah, possible.</p>
<p>So the question is, how would you design the trial</p>
<p>to narrow down your patient population correctly</p>
<p>so that you might see a signal?</p>
<p>Because the other risk of doing a trial</p>
<p>is you have too much of a heterogeneous patient population.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what the heck you&rsquo;re really doing</p>
<p>and you get meaningless results.</p>
<p>You get a null result when in fact there&rsquo;s a small signal,</p>
<p>but you were underpowered to pick it up</p>
<p>because you only had 10% of your patient population</p>
<p>that was the right patient population to get that.</p>
<p>So will we ever get there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know because I don&rsquo;t see what the incentive is.</p>
<p>You have people who are making money hand over fist</p>
<p>doing procedures on the basis of I&rsquo;m not sure what,</p>
<p>what would their motivation or incentive be</p>
<p>to sort of see this legitimized?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d really have to be able to say,</p>
<p>well, there really needs to be</p>
<p>sort of a pharma angle to this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of one of the wishes I had, right?</p>
<p>Like if I was a billionaire,</p>
<p>I feel like the way I would probably waste all of my money</p>
<p>would be running clinical trials</p>
<p>on stuff nobody cared about.</p>
<p>It would just be-</p>
<p>Likewise, I would join you because that would be,</p>
<p>yesterday we recorded a sit down with somebody from Caltech</p>
<p>who works on aggression and rage</p>
<p>and other things related to that.</p>
<p>And has identified peptides that are approved,</p>
<p>the FDA for other reasons that seem to adjust anxiety,</p>
<p>might even adjust aggression and pathologic aggression</p>
<p>and went off on to a long description</p>
<p>of why none of these drugs exist on the market</p>
<p>for the treatment of psychiatric illness</p>
<p>and yet probably would work.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s missing is a billionaire</p>
<p>or a billion dollar company</p>
<p>that is willing to invest in something</p>
<p>that very likely will work,</p>
<p>but the market value isn&rsquo;t quite there</p>
<p>or it failed in a previous trial.</p>
<p>And so no one wants to touch it with a 10 foot pole.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone listening to this will be incentivized</p>
<p>to provide this sort of a venue for that,</p>
<p>the kind of work that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I have to ask-</p>
<p>But I want to make one other point, Andrew,</p>
<p>which is to me, the problem with a lot of these things</p>
<p>is it gets, it&rsquo;s a crutch.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s sort of like what we talked about with like,</p>
<p>hey, just fix my T-man and everything&rsquo;s going to be fine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, that&rsquo;s just the beginning.</p>
<p>You know, what I worry about when I see people</p>
<p>who are clamoring for this stuff</p>
<p>is a lot of times they don&rsquo;t realize that</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s psychologically or otherwise,</p>
<p>they sort of say, well, now that I&rsquo;ve had this thing done,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to do the hard work of the real rehab.</p>
<p>I mean, if I&rsquo;ve learned anything</p>
<p>through my shoulder surgery,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m now three and a half months out.</p>
<p>How does it feel?</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I still can&rsquo;t do a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be, you know, a while.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t even been able to shoot a bow yet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll probably be a year before I&rsquo;ll go back to,</p>
<p>you know, long dead hangs and heavy deadlifts.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe nine months,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you know, I&rsquo;m not there yet.</p>
<p>But what I learned through a really amazing prehab</p>
<p>and rehab process is like, you just got to do the work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s freaking hard.</p>
<p>Shoulders are the most tedious, boring thing in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, three days a week, I am doing, four days a week,</p>
<p>I am doing one hour of just dedicated stuff</p>
<p>for this shoulder that is super uncomfortable,</p>
<p>super boring, super frustrating.</p>
<p>But I mean, I have faith in the methodology, right?</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people are saying,</p>
<p>just shoot the stem cells into me,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have to do any of that stuff.</p>
<p>And the reality of it is,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very dangerous place to be.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried BPC 157?</p>
<p>Yeah, we tried it.</p>
<p>We had, you know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago,</p>
<p>we had a bunch of patients ask about it.</p>
<p>So, you know, my view is, okay,</p>
<p>I was pretty convinced that there was no safety downside</p>
<p>to it, so I was like, well,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t prescribe it to a patient</p>
<p>unless I tried it myself.</p>
<p>So me and another doc in the practice, Ralph,</p>
<p>we did it for, I don&rsquo;t know, a couple months.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t notice a single thing.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for that.</p>
<p>Shifting to a less esoteric,</p>
<p>but, and I think probably more important topic overall,</p>
<p>metabolomics.</p>
<p>Talking about this before we sat down to record.</p>
<p>What is, what are metabolomics?</p>
<p>Why should we be thinking about them?</p>
<p>I have some idea of what it might be about,</p>
<p>but most people, I think,</p>
<p>are not thinking about metabolomics at all.</p>
<p>And for those that are, I&rsquo;m sure they could learn more.</p>
<p>So tell us about metabolomics</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;d like to see more of</p>
<p>in the world of metabolomics.</p>
<p>Yeah, so omics is just the term</p>
<p>that we use to describe the study of something.</p>
<p>So genomics, right, is like the broad study of genes</p>
<p>and, you know, proteomics,</p>
<p>the broad study of proteins and things like that.</p>
<p>So metabolomics is just study of metabolites.</p>
<p>And metabolites, unlike a lot of these other things,</p>
<p>there are a relatively finite number of these things,</p>
<p>many of which are known, but some of which are not known.</p>
<p>And so glucose is a metabolite.</p>
<p>Acetyl-CoA is a metabolite.</p>
<p>Lactate is a metabolite.</p>
<p>And so the question is,</p>
<p>what do we know about these things and how they work?</p>
<p>And more importantly,</p>
<p>what do we know about certain physiologic states</p>
<p>and the metabolomic profile that results from them?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s use two extreme examples, like exercise.</p>
<p>Everybody understands the data are unambiguously clear.</p>
<p>Exercise produces about the most favorable phenotype</p>
<p>imaginable.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to take a genomics approach</p>
<p>to understanding that, you might look at,</p>
<p>is there a change in the genome when you exercise?</p>
<p>And the answer is, you know, probably not,</p>
<p>but maybe if you looked at the, you know,</p>
<p>methylation patterns in epigenome,</p>
<p>you could look at epigenomic studies.</p>
<p>But you might instead look at</p>
<p>kind of the proteomic side of that.</p>
<p>Like, what is gene expression doing?</p>
<p>And there you would see a lot of changes.</p>
<p>Well, what I don&rsquo;t think people are really understanding,</p>
<p>although there was a very interesting paper</p>
<p>that just came out two weeks ago</p>
<p>that looks for novel metabolites that are changing.</p>
<p>Is there a huge signal in a metabolomic profile</p>
<p>that looks different in the state of exercise</p>
<p>versus non-exercise?</p>
<p>And could that represent part of how exercise</p>
<p>is transmitting its benefit through the body?</p>
<p>You know, people always talk about</p>
<p>the holy grail of metabolomics would be,</p>
<p>can you find a pill to mimic exercise?</p>
<p>And I think the answer to that question</p>
<p>is going to be undoubtedly no, for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One, even if you could mimic the longevity,</p>
<p>sort of lifespan parts of it,</p>
<p>you could never mimic the healthspan parts of it.</p>
<p>But what if you could do both, right?</p>
<p>What if there were small molecules</p>
<p>that can replicate some of the protective benefits</p>
<p>of exercise and you could combine those with exercise?</p>
<p>What if those could be treatments for other disease states</p>
<p>like diabetes, things like that?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think this field of metabolomics</p>
<p>is relatively untapped,</p>
<p>and I think potentially the next sort of frontier.</p>
<p>Speaking of frontiers, I hear a lot nowadays</p>
<p>about GLP-1 and pharmacology, prescription drugs</p>
<p>that mimic or increase GLP-1 directly.</p>
<p>Glucagon-like peptide, people are talking about this</p>
<p>as the blockbuster obesity drug.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard this much talk about a drug</p>
<p>to adjust human body weight favorably</p>
<p>since the discussions of Fen-Phen when I was in college.</p>
<p>And then of course, Fen-Phen was pulled from the market</p>
<p>because people were dying, not left and right,</p>
<p>but enough people died that they pulled it from the market.</p>
<p>Which by the way, is an interesting story.</p>
<p>It was the enantiomer that they chose to use</p>
<p>that was the wrong enantiomer.</p>
<p>And what it resulted in was, God, I think it was like-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mitral valve, prolapse.</p>
<p>It was an MVP, yeah, it was something in the mitral valve.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the chordae tendineae were rupturing</p>
<p>in the mitral valve, and it was mostly young women,</p>
<p>I think, were getting horrible pulmonary disease</p>
<p>as a result of it, probably pulmonary hypertension</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But there were two enantiomers of the drug,</p>
<p>and had they just used the other one,</p>
<p>this issue wouldn&rsquo;t have happened,</p>
<p>and there was a stupid reason why they made the choice</p>
<p>to use the one they did.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of those things where once you make the mistake</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never going back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like that company could say,</p>
<p>okay, we want to do over,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to do it with the right version.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a tragic outcome.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I think the GLP-1 agonists have more efficacy,</p>
<p>and for all intensity and for everything we can see,</p>
<p>certainly seem safer.</p>
<p>Are you excited about them?</p>
<p>Yeah, I am, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re just seeing</p>
<p>the kind of tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not miracle drugs, right?</p>
<p>They come with problems, right?</p>
<p>Which is, you know, they&rsquo;re catabolic across the board.</p>
<p>So patients are losing fat,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re losing muscle as well.</p>
<p>So, you know-</p>
<p>You just sent all the gym jockeys</p>
<p>running from semi-glutathione.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you have to say.</p>
<p>All you have to say nowadays about something</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s going to drop testosterone,</p>
<p>lower fertility, change someone&rsquo;s skin, hair, and nails,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like people,</p>
<p>it could extend life to being 250 years old</p>
<p>and people are gone.</p>
<p>Humans are humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a neuroscience and psychology issue,</p>
<p>not a biology medicine issue.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m pleased to hear that you&rsquo;re excited by them</p>
<p>because I hear a lot of excitement.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard anything disastrous about them.</p>
<p>It takes a while to get people up to dose.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re looking at semi-glutide,</p>
<p>the dose that was studied,</p>
<p>so they did a one-year trial,</p>
<p>or maybe it was a little over that, maybe 60 weeks,</p>
<p>but it took about 16 weeks to get the patients</p>
<p>comfortably up to 2.4 milligrams weekly,</p>
<p>which was the dose that they ultimately stayed on.</p>
<p>In our experience, when we use it,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even usually go up to 2.4 milligrams.</p>
<p>We can usually get enough benefit</p>
<p>between one and two milligrams,</p>
<p>and we usually move people along a little bit quicker,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve definitely had our share of patients</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t tolerate it due to the nausea.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Which might be part of how it&rsquo;s working, right,</p>
<p>is the sort of suppression of appetite,</p>
<p>which if taken to an extreme, can produce nausea.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think most of the effect of semi-glutide</p>
<p>is central, not peripheral.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I saw one paper that GLP-1 is acting</p>
<p>both on cells in the periphery to cause gut distention</p>
<p>in some ways, or sort of make people feel full</p>
<p>through promotion of literally mechanoreceptors</p>
<p>that make people feel as if their stomach is distended,</p>
<p>even though their stomach is empty,</p>
<p>and then perhaps some central hypothalamic effects.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>I would bet 80% of it&rsquo;s in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>It is also improving insulin sensitivity in the periphery,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s accounting</p>
<p>for much of its benefit.</p>
<p>Super interesting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s next-gen versions of these</p>
<p>that seem to be more long-lasting.</p>
<p>So right now, if you look at coming off semi-glutide,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see a weight regain.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s newer versions that seem to preserve</p>
<p>the weight loss, even off the drug.</p>
<p>So it begs the ultimate question, which is like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the total use case for this gonna be?</p>
<p>Is this gonna be a drug you cycle on and off,</p>
<p>or is it gonna be a drug that a person</p>
<p>has to stay on indefinitely?</p>
<p>And if so, will they become tachyphylactic?</p>
<p>Will they gain a resistance to it?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still super early days on these things.</p>
<p>My hope is that it would be a little bit like</p>
<p>the way that you described testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen therapies,</p>
<p>that it would allow people to do more of the behavioral work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely required for healthspan and lifespan.</p>
<p>Yep, and we&rsquo;ve also seen on the flip side of that,</p>
<p>you can cheat through semi-glutide, right?</p>
<p>You can drink a lot of calories</p>
<p>and sort of get around the drug.</p>
<p>So for example, we always encourage patients</p>
<p>who wanna lose weight to really just eliminate alcohol.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the cheapest, easiest trick to lose weight.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re still drinking a lot of alcohol,</p>
<p>which is incredibly caloric,</p>
<p>and just drinking a lot of caloric stuff,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen that that&rsquo;s less,</p>
<p>this is just anecdotal with our patients,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve seen that it&rsquo;s easier to get around</p>
<p>the benefits of the drug that way.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I so appreciate your answers today.</p>
<p>First of all, they were incredibly thorough</p>
<p>and pointed towards real-world application.</p>
<p>I also just wanna thank you more broadly</p>
<p>for the work that you do,</p>
<p>because obviously you have this incredible</p>
<p>clinical experience and patient population</p>
<p>that you work very closely with,</p>
<p>but I see you really as one of the few,</p>
<p>both clinicians, and I realize you&rsquo;re an MD.</p>
<p>Did you do a PhD as well?</p>
<p>No, but I consider you a scientist-clinician,</p>
<p>clinician-scientist is the appropriate wording of that,</p>
<p>of course, in the way that you really</p>
<p>still drill into studies in detail.</p>
<p>I know a lot of clinicians,</p>
<p>not all of them do that, for sure.</p>
<p>And the fact that you&rsquo;re so hungry</p>
<p>for the new incoming knowledge,</p>
<p>as well as the old literature.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an incredibly rich data set</p>
<p>in that brain of yours,</p>
<p>and I really appreciate you sharing it with us,</p>
<p>both in your podcast and the upcoming book,</p>
<p>which I think we&rsquo;ll certainly have you on here again</p>
<p>in anticipation of that,</p>
<p>but I know I and a ton of other people</p>
<p>are really excited for the book</p>
<p>and in the way that you approach social media</p>
<p>and podcasts and going on podcasts.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I learned a ton.</p>

<p>anywhere from three to 10 minutes</p>
<p>that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols</p>
<p>related to sleep, to focus, interviews with various guests.</p>
<p>We talk about things like caffeine,</p>
<p>when to drink caffeine relative to sleep,</p>
<p>alcohol, when and how,</p>
<p>and if anyone should ingest it relative to sleep,</p>
<p>dopamine, serotonin, mental health, physical health,</p>
<p>and on and on.</p>
<p>All the things that relate to the topics</p>
<p>most of interest to you.</p>
<p>You can find that easily by going to YouTube,</p>
<p>look for Huberman Lab clips in the search area,</p>
<p>and it will take you there.</p>
<p>Subscribe, and we are constantly updating those</p>
<p>with new clips.</p>
<p>This is especially useful, I believe,</p>
<p>for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re still working through the back catalog</p>
<p>of Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>which admittedly can be rather long.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
