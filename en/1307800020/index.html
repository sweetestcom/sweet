    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 19, The Romanization of Britain.</p>
<p>In this episode, I&rsquo;m going to look at the emergence of the Roman Empire following the</p>
<p>death of Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to look at what happened when the Romans decided to make another attempt</p>
<p>to conquer Britain.</p>
<p>As you probably already know, the Romans had more luck this second time around.</p>
<p>Britain finally became part of the Roman Empire, or at least part of it did.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to explore how Roman economics and culture began to transform Celtic Britain</p>
<p>into a new Romanized Britain.</p>
<p>And along the way, I&rsquo;ll look at how modern English reflects some of these changes.</p>
<p>So this episode will focus on the early period of the Roman Empire and the Roman occupation</p>
<p>of Britain.</p>
<p>As for the end of the Roman Empire, at least in Western Europe, that part of the story</p>
<p>is closely associated with the rise of the Germanic tribes to the north.</p>
<p>And so next time, I&rsquo;m going to begin looking at those Germanic tribes in detail.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve intentionally delayed any detailed discussion of those tribes up to this point.</p>
<p>But after this episode, we&rsquo;ll be ready to look at the ultimate Germanic roots of English.</p>
<p>But let me note that Latin will continue to be an integral part of the story of English,</p>
<p>so we won&rsquo;t be leaving Latin behind, not by any means.</p>
<p>But the overall focus will shift across the Rhine next time into Germany and the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>As for this episode, let&rsquo;s pick up with the spread of the Roman Republic into Western</p>
<p>Europe under Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll recall, Caesar led the expeditions which ultimately resulted in the Roman conquest</p>
<p>of Gaul.</p>
<p>And this was part of the overall spread of Rome throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And with the spread of Rome into Western Europe, we can start to see the early fault</p>
<p>lines for the division of the empire into Western and Eastern sections.</p>
<p>In the East, there were pre-existing ancient civilizations with a common lingua franca</p>
<p>in Greek.</p>
<p>But in the West, the Celtic cultures of Europe were far less advanced.</p>
<p>So Roman culture was able to replace the native cultures there much more easily.</p>
<p>Now, Roman wealth and culture was actually embraced in many of these regions, even if</p>
<p>the Romans themselves were not always welcome.</p>
<p>So Romanization was much more effective in these Western regions, and the new societies</p>
<p>which emerged bore a distinctly Roman appearance.</p>
<p>Now following Caesar&rsquo;s conquest of Gaul, the territory was thoroughly Romanized.</p>
<p>The Roman culture and the Roman language soon replaced the native Celtic traditions and</p>
<p>languages there.</p>
<p>And Caesar&rsquo;s victory over Pompey in the Roman Civil War had left Caesar as the dominant</p>
<p>political and military leader in Rome.</p>
<p>He effectively became the dictator of Rome, but unlike his predecessors, he didn&rsquo;t serve</p>
<p>for a period of six months.</p>
<p>He was dictator for life, which, as it turned out, was actually not all that long.</p>
<p>In 44 BC, less than five years after his victory over his political rivals in Rome, Caesar</p>
<p>was stabbed to death by a group of senators who were alarmed by his rise to power and</p>
<p>his disregard of traditional Roman institutions.</p>
<p>Now if the plan was to return Rome to some form of rule by the Senate, it failed.</p>
<p>Left with a choice between anarchy and one-man rule, Rome was ultimately forced to accept</p>
<p>one-man rule.</p>
<p>After Caesar&rsquo;s assassination, a civil war ensued, with Mark Antony briefly emerging</p>
<p>as the leader of Rome, but fortunes soon turned against him and his wife, the Egyptian</p>
<p>queen Cleopatra.</p>
<p>And in 31 BC, their forces were defeated by those of the grand-nephew and adopted son</p>
<p>of Caesar, Octavian.</p>
<p>After their defeat, Mark Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide, and Octavian finally emerged</p>
<p>from all of this civil strife as the ultimate victor in the battle for control of Rome.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Octavian, Rome completed the transition from republic to empire.</p>
<p>His reforms were actually very successful in bringing about peace and prosperity to</p>
<p>the empire, and this period came to be known as the Pax Romana, meaning the Roman Peace.</p>
<p>And Octavian preserved the Senate as an institution, but it offered very little check on his powers.</p>
<p>Octavian controlled the army, and he concentrated many political positions in himself.</p>
<p>He could initiate legislation, and he could veto the Senate&rsquo;s legislation.</p>
<p>In 27 BC, Octavian was given the name Augustus, which was the name that carried with it a</p>
<p>sense of reverence.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned in the last episode, he had the seventh month of the Roman calendar</p>
<p>named in his honor, thereby creating the month of August.</p>
<p>And this followed July, which had been named for Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>By the time of Octavian, or Augustus, the terms Rome or Roman no longer meant the city</p>
<p>of Rome itself.</p>
<p>It now referred to the entire Roman Empire.</p>
<p>And by the third century, every free inhabitant of the empire received Roman citizenship.</p>
<p>So Rome started to become a very general term for things associated with the empire itself.</p>
<p>Now Augustus was a very young man when he became the ruler of Rome, and he died at the</p>
<p>age of 76.</p>
<p>And his rule is considered by many historians to represent the peak of Roman culture with</p>
<p>its blend of Greek and Roman elements.</p>
<p>And Augustus was succeeded by Tiberius and then Caligula.</p>
<p>And the rule of Caligula was marked by cruelty and excess and incompetence and probably mental</p>
<p>illness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to deal with all of his exploits here, like attempting to make his own horse</p>
<p>a consul, but it was his successor who&rsquo;s far more important to our story of the history</p>
<p>of English.</p>
<p>Caligula&rsquo;s cruelty and insanity ultimately led to his assassination in the year 41 AD.</p>
<p>And from this point on, we can just assume that all dates are AD or Common Era, unless</p>
<p>I know it otherwise.</p>
<p>After the death of Caligula, his uncle Claudius became emperor.</p>
<p>And it was Claudius who once again looked to Britain as a possible location for Roman</p>
<p>conquest.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind about Claudius is that he had been very sick as a child, and</p>
<p>he was still frail as an adult.</p>
<p>He had a limp, a stutter, and a slight deafness.</p>
<p>And his poor health may have actually been an asset earlier in his life because he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really considered much of a political threat, and he survived the political attacks and</p>
<p>assassinations which befell other Roman nobles during the reigns of Tiberius and Caligula.</p>
<p>But now that he was emperor of Rome, his frailty was a major liability.</p>
<p>He knew that he would become the target of attacks.</p>
<p>So what was the best way for a Roman emperor to secure his position?</p>
<p>The answer was simple ‚Äì conquest.</p>
<p>When an emperor conquered a foreign territory, the emperor himself was the conqueror, and</p>
<p>it gave the emperor a great deal of prestige and clout.</p>
<p>And in the case of Claudius, it would remove any doubts as to his physical ability to rule.</p>
<p>To the Romans, Britain was considered the edge of the world.</p>
<p>It was beyond Gaul, across the sea.</p>
<p>And even Julius Caesar wasn&rsquo;t able to fully conquer it during his two campaigns there.</p>
<p>There were all kinds of rumors about the savages who lived there, and the Romans were particularly</p>
<p>concerned about the mysterious power of the Celtic druids.</p>
<p>Between Caesar&rsquo;s attempts to invade the island in the first century BC and Claudius&rsquo; expedition</p>
<p>around a century later, there was actually a fair amount of trade with Rome.</p>
<p>There were about 20 major Celtic tribes in Britain, and Rome actually had entered into</p>
<p>alliances with some of those tribes in southern Britain.</p>
<p>And Roman coins were being minted by this point in and around modern Belgium, which</p>
<p>was part of the northernmost region of Roman Gaul.</p>
<p>And these coins were actually in demand among the Celtic tribes in southern Britain.</p>
<p>These coins were payment for British goods like cattle, grain, tin, iron, hunting dogs,</p>
<p>and even slaves.</p>
<p>Rome also traded Roman luxury goods for those items, including wine and olive oil.</p>
<p>But the Celtic tribes had reached a stage of economic development where Roman coins</p>
<p>were also an acceptable form of currency.</p>
<p>And some of the Celtic tribal kings had even established their own mints to make their</p>
<p>own coins.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these Celtic British coins were inscribed in Latin, because the Celtic</p>
<p>languages weren&rsquo;t written down at that point.</p>
<p>The inscriptions even called the Celtic kings Rex, using the Latin term for king.</p>
<p>So even at this early stage, we can see an economy that was in transition to an economy</p>
<p>based on currency and minted coins, even before the Roman conquest.</p>
<p>But trade and political alliances were not enough for Emperor Claudius.</p>
<p>He needed a new territory to conquer, and Britain would serve that purpose very well.</p>
<p>In the year 43, four Roman legions consisting of about 25,000 men landed in southeastern Britain.</p>
<p>From there, the Roman armies advanced northward and westward.</p>
<p>The exact location where the Romans landed and the exact tracks of the Roman army after</p>
<p>that, they&rsquo;re really unknown.</p>
<p>But we do know that one of the first major obstacles for the Roman army was the River</p>
<p>Thames.</p>
<p>And they apparently built a bridge to cross it, and a settlement soon began to emerge</p>
<p>at this crossing point.</p>
<p>And this early Roman city was called Londinium, and of course it&rsquo;s known today as London.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, the original name Londinium appears to be a Celtic word, which the Romans</p>
<p>borrowed and modified.</p>
<p>Now the story of the Roman invasion of Britain actually parallels the Roman invasion of Gaul</p>
<p>in many respects.</p>
<p>Just like in Gaul, the various Celtic tribes in Britain were prone to infighting, and they</p>
<p>were never able to form a cohesive alliance against the Romans.</p>
<p>One tribe would ally itself with the Romans for the sole purpose of defeating a neighboring</p>
<p>tribe.</p>
<p>And this divide-and-conquer approach, which the Romans had used so effectively in Gaul,</p>
<p>would continue to be Rome&rsquo;s best weapon in Britain as well.</p>
<p>The Romans initially conquered and settled in the southeastern region of Britain.</p>
<p>And this region had already established trading relations with the Romans, and remember that</p>
<p>some of these tribes had alliances with the Romans before the Roman invasion occurred.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not surprising that the Romans found the least resistance in these areas.</p>
<p>And many of the native elites in this region actually embraced Rome, which helped Rome</p>
<p>establish a secure base there.</p>
<p>Within the next three years or so after the Roman invasion, Rome had conquered much of</p>
<p>modern-day England.</p>
<p>But the native Celtic tribes continued to resist the Romans to the west in Wales and</p>
<p>Cornwall, and further north in central and northern Britain.</p>
<p>These tribes had elected to engage in a guerrilla war against the Romans, and that was something</p>
<p>the Romans weren&rsquo;t really accustomed to.</p>
<p>The Romans eventually realized that a regional base in the south wasn&rsquo;t going to be enough</p>
<p>if they wanted to conquer the entire island.</p>
<p>They were going to have to engage those western and northern tribes, and that&rsquo;s eventually</p>
<p>what they did.</p>
<p>The Roman campaigns against these western and northern tribes ultimately proved successful,</p>
<p>at least in part.</p>
<p>After several decades of hard fighting, the Romans were finally able to subdue the tribes</p>
<p>in Wales, as well as the tribes in some of the northern portions of Britain.</p>
<p>But the Romans were never able to conquer the northernmost region, which we know today</p>
<p>as Scotland.</p>
<p>In fact, the later Emperor Hadrian built the now-famous Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall across northern</p>
<p>Britain to establish the limits of Roman occupation, and to protect it against those tribes to</p>
<p>the north.</p>
<p>These tribes in modern-day Scotland included the Scots and another group called the Picts.</p>
<p>The Picts occupied northeast Scotland, and they were known to paint their bodies.</p>
<p>The term Picts means painted people in Latin.</p>
<p>There is some disagreement among modern historians as to whether they were Celtic or not.</p>
<p>Their language actually appears to be a blend of Celtic and older native language.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is that the Romans finally gave up on trying to conquer that northernmost</p>
<p>region, and Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall became the de facto border of the Roman territory.</p>
<p>The Romans also never tried to invade Ireland to the west, so that meant that the regions</p>
<p>which we know today as Scotland and Ireland retained their Celtic culture and languages.</p>
<p>So just like the Anglo-Saxons several centuries later, the Romans never realized a complete</p>
<p>conquest of the British Isles, only a portion of it, albeit a very large portion of it.</p>
<p>Now I mentioned in an earlier episode that the word breeches was a native Celtic word</p>
<p>for pants, and we know from recorded sources that the Romans were once amused by these</p>
<p>barbarian garments, but they soon decided they weren&rsquo;t such a bad idea after all.</p>
<p>The Roman togas didn&rsquo;t provide much warmth in the chilly and wet climate of Britain,</p>
<p>so the Romans themselves soon began to wear breeches or pants in Britain.</p>
<p>Now no discussion about the Roman invasion of Britain would be complete without mentioning</p>
<p>one of the earliest known military heroes in British history.</p>
<p>And this native military and political hero was in fact a heroine, and I&rsquo;m referring</p>
<p>to the Celtic Queen Boudicca, or as she&rsquo;s sometimes called, Boudicea.</p>
<p>I noted that there were many parallels between the Roman occupation of Britain and the earlier</p>
<p>Roman occupation of Gaul, and as you may recall from the earlier episode on Caesar&rsquo;s invasion</p>
<p>of Gaul, just as he had completed his initial conquest, a full-scale revolt broke out under</p>
<p>the leadership of Vercingetorix, and something very similar happened here again in eastern</p>
<p>Britain.</p>
<p>Now shortly after the death of the Emperor Claudius, his successor Nero became emperor.</p>
<p>The Iceni tribe was located in eastern Britain, and it was a very large and important Celtic</p>
<p>tribe which generally had a very good relationship with Rome.</p>
<p>And in the year 60, the Iceni king died without a male heir.</p>
<p>So he divided his wealth between his two daughters and the Roman emperor, Nero.</p>
<p>Now he apparently thought that this would ensure imperial protection for his family,</p>
<p>but he couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong.</p>
<p>The Romans seized the opportunity and annexed his kingdom.</p>
<p>But more than that, they flogged his wife, Boudica, and they raped his daughters, and</p>
<p>they confiscated the property of the Iceni chiefs.</p>
<p>Queen Boudica and the Iceni were incensed.</p>
<p>And under Boudica&rsquo;s leadership, the Iceni tribe launched a full-scale revolt against</p>
<p>the Romans.</p>
<p>And after they began their attacks against the Romans, other Celtic tribes in Britain</p>
<p>began to join the revolt.</p>
<p>And the Iceni sacked several towns occupied by Romans, including Londinium.</p>
<p>And the Romans actually had to withdraw from London, thereby leaving it to be plundered</p>
<p>by the rebels.</p>
<p>And according to the Roman historian Tacitus, about 70,000 Romans and their allies and townspeople</p>
<p>were killed by the Iceni and their allies.</p>
<p>Now all of this happened at a time when the Romans had initiated a campaign in Wales,</p>
<p>so they had to immediately recall those troops to deal with the rebellion in the east.</p>
<p>The Romans were then able to inflict a defeat on Boudica just west of London.</p>
<p>And the tide by this point had started to change, and the Roman army finally put down</p>
<p>the revolt in the following year, 61 AD.</p>
<p>And in response, Boudica poisoned herself, thereby effectively ending the last real chance</p>
<p>the Celtic tribes had to get rid of the Roman invaders.</p>
<p>Now after the revolt, the process of Romanization was able to take place in southern and central</p>
<p>Britain with relatively little resistance.</p>
<p>The Romans often converted the existing Celtic towns into Roman towns.</p>
<p>And this was unlike what happened in Gaul, where Celtic towns were often depopulated</p>
<p>and new Roman towns were built.</p>
<p>The Romans also built roads between the existing towns in Britain, and in fact these roads</p>
<p>formed the basis of many modern roads in Britain.</p>
<p>And by this point, the Romans had conquest and colonization down to a science.</p>
<p>Prominent local leaders were made auxiliary officers and were encouraged to adopt Roman</p>
<p>culture.</p>
<p>And the Romans took the sons of Celtic chiefs and they educated them as Romans, including</p>
<p>grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, and music.</p>
<p>They also learned Latin.</p>
<p>And the sons grew up to be local leaders, and their sons were given the same education.</p>
<p>And these subsequent generations welcomed Roman culture.</p>
<p>And since this Romanization was focused at the higher levels of Celtic society, it tended</p>
<p>to filter down to the lower levels and tended to ensure that there was little organized</p>
<p>opposition to the Roman presence.</p>
<p>Latin was also made the official language of Roman Britain.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t mean everyone started speaking Latin.</p>
<p>During the period of the Roman occupation, most native Britons continued to speak Celtic</p>
<p>languages, especially in rural areas.</p>
<p>And Latin was spoken by some people in Britain, mainly by the governing classes and administrators,</p>
<p>and by the soldiers who were stationed there, and by certain traders.</p>
<p>And some of the better educated natives also learned Latin.</p>
<p>So basically Latin was spoken in and around the Roman-occupied towns.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important to understand that Britain never experienced the degree of Romanization</p>
<p>that Gaul did.</p>
<p>The Romans arrived later in Britain, and ultimately they left earlier.</p>
<p>And it was also much farther away from Rome.</p>
<p>So Latin never made the inroads in Britain that it did elsewhere.</p>
<p>It remained a second language, although it did have a great deal of prestige among those</p>
<p>who spoke it.</p>
<p>And it should be noted that Latin was the only written language in Britain at the time,</p>
<p>because the Celts in Britain were still illiterate.</p>
<p>Speaking of writing, the Latin word for writing was scribra, and a professional who copied</p>
<p>texts was a scriba.</p>
<p>And this word comes into English as scribe.</p>
<p>It also comes in as the word script.</p>
<p>And we see it in the word description.</p>
<p>And when actors learn their parts, they have to memorize a script, which is a shortened</p>
<p>version of the word manuscript.</p>
<p>Postscript and inscription are just a few of the other words which contain the word</p>
<p>script and which derive from the Latin word for writing.</p>
<p>And the power of Roman civilization in Western Europe is reflected in the fact that the Romance</p>
<p>languages, and most of the Celtic languages, and most of the Germanic languages all use</p>
<p>this Latin word scribra as the basis of their respective words for write.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, English is one of the few exceptions to that rule.</p>
<p>Even though English has borrowed in the Latin word in certain contexts like scribe and script,</p>
<p>the English word write comes from an old English word, written.</p>
<p>And of course, if you were someone who could read and write, you were literate, another</p>
<p>word that comes to us from Latin.</p>
<p>The Romans used the word litera to mean individual letters of the alphabet.</p>
<p>And the plural version, literae, referred to a letter written to someone.</p>
<p>Now ultimately, English lost the distinction between the individual and the plural versions.</p>
<p>And today, it uses the word letter for both.</p>
<p>So we use letters to write letters.</p>
<p>As I noted, the words literate and literacy come from the same root.</p>
<p>Alliteration, which is the repetition of a sound, also comes from the same root.</p>
<p>Now even though many Britons continued to speak Celtic languages during this period</p>
<p>of Roman occupation, there&rsquo;s no doubt that the overall culture of Britain began to change</p>
<p>during this period.</p>
<p>Even though the overall effects of Romanization in Britain were more limited than in Gaul,</p>
<p>we can still start to see a society that was becoming more and more Roman.</p>
<p>And one place where we can start to see the Roman influences is in the names of certain</p>
<p>cities.</p>
<p>Now after the Roman army arrived, it established camps, which were basically forts or military</p>
<p>stations.</p>
<p>And they did it throughout the region.</p>
<p>And these camps also recruited locals for enlistment in the Roman army.</p>
<p>And some of these camps emerged as modern cities.</p>
<p>The Latin word for camp was castra.</p>
<p>And many modern cities in Britain that begin or end in caster or chester come from this</p>
<p>Roman word for camp.</p>
<p>So we see it in city names like Chesterfield, Manchester, Dorchester, Winchester, and Lancaster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also found in city names like Gloucester and Worcester, which are no longer pronounced</p>
<p>like their spell.</p>
<p>Both words end in c-e-s-t-e-r when spelled out, so we see the Roman word for camp in</p>
<p>those names as well.</p>
<p>So from that word castra, which meant camp or fort, the Romans developed the word castellum,</p>
<p>which meant a fortified village.</p>
<p>And castellum passed from French into English as castle, meaning a type of fortress.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no coincidence that the word castle came into English from French.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll eventually see, when the Norman French invaded England in 1066, they not only</p>
<p>brought the French language with them, but they also constructed many large castles to</p>
<p>subdue the native population.</p>
<p>Now some of these early Roman camps emerged into modern cities, but they were merely villages</p>
<p>during the Roman period.</p>
<p>And I want to talk about that word village because it actually provides a nice transition</p>
<p>to the next topic I want to discuss, which is Roman law.</p>
<p>The word village comes from the Roman word villa, and shortly after the ancient city</p>
<p>of Rome emerged as an actual city, some wealthy Romans decided they didn&rsquo;t like living in</p>
<p>such a crowded place, so they built houses outside of Rome in the country.</p>
<p>And this type of estate was called a villa in Latin.</p>
<p>And the same basic process happened in Britain after the Romans took over there as well.</p>
<p>Villas began to pop up in Britain around and outside of the Roman towns.</p>
<p>Researchers have identified over 600 sites in Britain which were once occupied by a Roman-style villa.</p>
<p>And like so much of the Roman influence in Britain, these villas were primarily located</p>
<p>in the southern and eastern portions of the island.</p>
<p>Some of them were very small, and some were very grand, consisting of hundreds and even</p>
<p>thousands of acres, but most were somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>But they were all constructed in a style that was common throughout the Roman Empire at</p>
<p>this point, including Italy and the Roman territory of Gaul.</p>
<p>This word villa has filtered down to us in modern English in its original form, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also created several new words.</p>
<p>These country houses were often so large that they required caretakers and other help.</p>
<p>And this eventually resulted in an entire community around the villa.</p>
<p>And this was the origin of the term village to refer to a small settlement.</p>
<p>But what about the people who lived in those villages?</p>
<p>The Romans called them villani, and early French adopted the term as villienne.</p>
<p>And as the Romans began to occupy much of Western Europe, we can start to see the emergence</p>
<p>of the later-day feudal system with this arrangement.</p>
<p>In later France, the term villienne came to refer to the peasants or common people who</p>
<p>provided service to the lord who occupied the estate.</p>
<p>And these people were often viewed as crude, uncivilized, and amoral.</p>
<p>And English later borrowed the word as villain.</p>
<p>So villain comes from the same Latin root as village.</p>
<p>And much like the creation of the word castle from the original Latin word meaning camp,</p>
<p>we can see in the evolution of these words a changing economic and social system.</p>
<p>Roman camps and villages gave us medieval French castles and villains.</p>
<p>Again, the medieval feudal system emerged after the decline of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>But certain aspects of that system did have its roots in Roman law and economics.</p>
<p>Roman law distinguished between wealthy men and poor men.</p>
<p>A poor man would get harsher punishment than a rich man for the same crime.</p>
<p>And this wasn&rsquo;t just a consequence of having better representation in court like today.</p>
<p>It was actually part of the law itself.</p>
<p>Despite this obvious unfairness given our modern sensibilities, many historians consider</p>
<p>the formal Roman legal codes to be one of the greatest gifts to the modern world.</p>
<p>Roman law actually began with something called the Laws of the Twelve Tables, which were</p>
<p>adopted shortly after the last Etruscan king was expelled from Rome.</p>
<p>And these laws were engraved on bronze tablets and displayed in the Roman Forum.</p>
<p>And this was really the foundation of Roman law.</p>
<p>You may remember from an earlier episode that the Roman word forum gave us the modern</p>
<p>English word forensic, referring to the law in the courts.</p>
<p>Over time, these laws were expanded, first during the Roman Republic, and then later</p>
<p>under the Empire.</p>
<p>And as the Roman Empire expanded and acquired new territories and new peoples, they encountered</p>
<p>new systems of law and justice.</p>
<p>The Romans adopted elements of these non-Roman laws into a universal Roman legal code, which</p>
<p>could be implemented throughout the vast and varied empire.</p>
<p>The Romans had also adopted from the Greeks the concept of natural law, or universal law.</p>
<p>This was the notion that there are certain forms of behavior which we all share as humans,</p>
<p>which are not tied to any specific society or culture.</p>
<p>So murder, rape, death, and incest were considered unlawful based on universal concepts.</p>
<p>Now modern anthropologists would probably quibble with the notion of a universal law</p>
<p>which we all share, but the Greeks and the Romans accepted it, and the Romans based their</p>
<p>legal code around it.</p>
<p>The Roman legal code was codified in the 6th century by the Emperor Justinian, and it still</p>
<p>serves as the basis of many modern European legal systems.</p>
<p>Roman law was highly developed, and not surprisingly, it&rsquo;s the source of many of our modern legal</p>
<p>terms.</p>
<p>The Latin verb stara meant to stand, and it&rsquo;s the root of the words stance, staunch, status,</p>
<p>stationary, and constant.</p>
<p>This verb was combined with trace or tria, meaning three, and produced a reconstructed</p>
<p>Latin word tristis, and this is the basis of legal words like testimony and testament</p>
<p>in modern English.</p>
<p>So why would three be incorporated into the verb stand to produce these words testimony</p>
<p>and testament?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because it reflects an aspect of threeness which was common in Roman law.</p>
<p>The testimony of a witness is the perspective of a third party.</p>
<p>In certain cases under Roman law, three people had to witness an action before a person could</p>
<p>be found guilty of the accusation.</p>
<p>The last will and testament reflects the fact that traditionally it had to be signed</p>
<p>by the person making the will, as well as two witnesses.</p>
<p>So that makes three.</p>
<p>And the Latin term obligatio meant the actual physical binding of a person to something.</p>
<p>Under Roman law, a defaulting debtor was physically bound and delivered to his creditor as a prisoner.</p>
<p>And after the debtor&rsquo;s prison was abandoned, the term came to represent just the legal</p>
<p>duty owed by a debtor to a creditor.</p>
<p>And this is the context in which the term obligation arose.</p>
<p>A common source of disputes for Roman authorities was the use of small streams and rivers by</p>
<p>property owners and traders.</p>
<p>Sometimes multiple individuals would claim competing rights to use the same stream or</p>
<p>some portion of it.</p>
<p>And in Latin, a stream is called a rivus.</p>
<p>And those who competed for the use of the stream were called rivalis.</p>
<p>And this is the same word which comes to us in English as rivals, meaning competitors.</p>
<p>And Roman legal records confirm many court cases between rivalis over the use of rivers</p>
<p>and streams.</p>
<p>So the modern English words rivals and rivalry come from this source.</p>
<p>Words like subpoena and libel also come from Latin.</p>
<p>In fact, legal systems throughout the English-speaking world are dominated by Latin terms.</p>
<p>Many of these legal terms come into English after 1066 with the Norman French, who had</p>
<p>to impose law and order on those defeated Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll cover some of those legal terms later.</p>
<p>But modern legal traditions also borrow words directly from Latin without any modification.</p>
<p>And many of those terms are now part of the common English language.</p>
<p>This includes terms like bona fide, de facto, in absentia, in toto, per annum, per capita,</p>
<p>per se, prima facie, quid pro quo, status quo, verbatim, and vice versa.</p>
<p>All of these terms have passed into modern English in basically their original Latin</p>
<p>form.</p>
<p>Now I mentioned that Roman law was connected to the Roman Forum, which was the center of</p>
<p>Roman politics and law.</p>
<p>And now, in Britain, the Romans transfer the idea of the Roman Forum to the new towns built</p>
<p>by the Romans.</p>
<p>Roman-style forums were established in towns like Exeter, Lincoln, and St. Albans.</p>
<p>And courts of justice were also established there.</p>
<p>And these courts consulted the written Roman legal codes and applied Roman law.</p>
<p>So the Celtic tradition of trial by druids in the forest was gradually being replaced</p>
<p>by these formal legal proceedings.</p>
<p>And this is just one example of the transition of Britain from an ancient Celtic tribal society</p>
<p>to a more rigid, formal, and structured Roman society.</p>
<p>Now I mentioned that the Romans constructed their own mini-versions of the Roman Forum</p>
<p>in the occupied towns in Britain.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that the Roman Forum was not just a place for legal and political activities.</p>
<p>It was also the commercial center of Rome.</p>
<p>In fact, the Forum in Rome began as a marketplace.</p>
<p>And over time, as people congregated there, it became the location for aspiring politicians</p>
<p>to give political speeches.</p>
<p>And from there, the legal and political aspects of the Forum grew.</p>
<p>But it always remained a commercial center.</p>
<p>And these new British forums also served as Roman-style marketplaces.</p>
<p>And after the Roman occupation, trade between the native Britons and the Roman Empire grew</p>
<p>exponentially.</p>
<p>And as a result, wealth began to flow into the Romanized areas of Britain, as British</p>
<p>exports to the empire grew.</p>
<p>The newfound wealth also had its own Romanizing effects.</p>
<p>Roman-style public baths became common.</p>
<p>And Roman luxury goods were consumed.</p>
<p>By the way, all those new straight roads which the Romans built to facilitate the movement</p>
<p>of troops, well, they also facilitated the movement of goods.</p>
<p>And as we know from modern economics, you have to have an infrastructure to support</p>
<p>economic growth.</p>
<p>And since military conquests and economic growth were intertwined in the Roman mind,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not surprising that the Romans figured out how to transform military infrastructure</p>
<p>into economic infrastructure.</p>
<p>The same roads that allowed the Romans to easily move troops from one town to the next,</p>
<p>well, they also allowed traders to move goods between those towns.</p>
<p>And that meant goods produced in one town could easily be sold in another town.</p>
<p>That meant that even the domestic market for local goods was now bigger.</p>
<p>And with more potential buyers, you can sell more produce for more money.</p>
<p>And when exports to the rest of the Roman Empire were taken into account, you can see</p>
<p>how quickly the economy began to grow in some of these regions.</p>
<p>And of course, the Romans got to tax all of that new wealth, so the economic benefits</p>
<p>were mutual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also part of the reason why the Roman Empire was so wealthy as it was growing and</p>
<p>expanding.</p>
<p>But its wealth began to decline when the empire ran out of new territories to conquer.</p>
<p>Empires are expensive, and massive empires are really expensive.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not growing the empire, it starts to stagnate and collapse under its</p>
<p>own weight.</p>
<p>And this was one of the many factors that contributed to the ultimate decline of the</p>
<p>Roman Empire.</p>
<p>But for now, with the conquest of Britain, it was pretty much at its peak of power and</p>
<p>territory.</p>
<p>And as I said, Britain was enjoying the mutual economic benefits of being a newly acquired</p>
<p>Roman territory.</p>
<p>And all of this wealth, and the luxury goods it could buy, helped to ensure the ongoing</p>
<p>cooperation of the native Britons.</p>
<p>And this was how Romanization worked.</p>
<p>And it worked pretty well, at least in the southeastern portions of Britain where the</p>
<p>Roman presence was at its strongest.</p>
<p>And for these same reasons, Latin probably had its strongest impact in this same region.</p>
<p>Now speaking of the growing wealth in Britain after the Roman conquest, I noted earlier</p>
<p>that Roman coins were actually being used throughout southern Britain even before the</p>
<p>Roman occupation there.</p>
<p>And of course, after the occupation, Roman currency poured into Britain.</p>
<p>And this too was another catalyst for economic growth.</p>
<p>A common stable currency makes it much easier to buy and sell goods than the old-fashioned</p>
<p>barter or trade system.</p>
<p>And if that currency happens to be an international currency, well, that&rsquo;s even better.</p>
<p>So now the Romanized Britons were operating on the same monetary system with the same</p>
<p>currency as the rest of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Again, this makes trade much more efficient.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the United States adopted a common currency soon after it gained its independence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have a euro today.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about Roman currency and the effect Latin has had on modern English words</p>
<p>related to money and currency.</p>
<p>Roman coins can be traced back to the first Roman mint, which was established around 289</p>
<p>B.C.</p>
<p>And like everything else in ancient Rome, it had a goddess, and she was named Juno.</p>
<p>Now Juno was actually one of the most important Roman deities.</p>
<p>She was the wife and sister of Jupiter.</p>
<p>And Jupiter&rsquo;s daughter was Minerva.</p>
<p>And a temple was constructed in honor of all three of those deities on the Capitoline Hill</p>
<p>in the 4th century B.C.</p>
<p>This temple was divided into separate sections for each of the three deities.</p>
<p>Now with regard to Juno, she was the queen of the gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned in the last episode, her name is the basis of the name of the month</p>
<p>of June.</p>
<p>She was also considered a goddess of warning.</p>
<p>The Romans believed that Juno warned them in times of imminent danger.</p>
<p>Now the Latin verb meaning to warn was minera.</p>
<p>And since Juno was the goddess of warning, she was sometimes called Juno Mineta, which</p>
<p>came from the Latin word meaning to warn.</p>
<p>Now I mentioned that the first Roman mint was established around 289 B.C.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, this mint was constructed in a building which adjoined Juno&rsquo;s temple,</p>
<p>which was known as the Temple of Juno Mineta.</p>
<p>And since Roman money was coined there, many of the coins minted there featured Juno on</p>
<p>one side of the coin.</p>
<p>And eventually the term moneta became associated with both the mint itself and the coins that</p>
<p>were produced there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the term moneta came to be associated with Roman coins and money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the ultimate root of the English word money, as well as the word mint.</p>
<p>Both come from the name of Juno Moneta.</p>
<p>The modern British pound sterling originated well after the Romans, during the Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>period in Britain.</p>
<p>The word pound comes from the Old English word pund, which was used as a weight measurement,</p>
<p>in the same sense that we use the word pound today as a weight measurement.</p>
<p>But the Anglo-Saxons called a pound of silver simply a pound.</p>
<p>So the use of the word as currency comes from its original use as a weight measurement.</p>
<p>And it literally meant a pound of silver, or more particularly, it meant a silver coin</p>
<p>weighing a pound.</p>
<p>But the Anglo-Saxons didn&rsquo;t invent the idea of minting silver coins weighing a pound.</p>
<p>That idea actually came from Charlemagne in the Frankish kingdom, which had emerged from</p>
<p>Roman Gaul.</p>
<p>The Romans had established the weight measurement, which we know today as the pound.</p>
<p>And in fact, the Romans called it a libra, and that&rsquo;s why when we abbreviate a pound</p>
<p>of weight in modern English, we still use the initials LD, which reflects the Latin</p>
<p>origin of the weight measurement.</p>
<p>By the time of Charlemagne, this word had evolved into early French as livre, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what Charlemagne called this early French one-pound silver coin.</p>
<p>Since it weighed a livre, he called it a livre.</p>
<p>And the Anglo-Saxons picked up on this idea.</p>
<p>They not only adopted the idea of a silver coin weighing a pound, but they also copied</p>
<p>the idea of naming the coin after how much it weighed.</p>
<p>But again, Old English had its own native term for a Roman libra.</p>
<p>It was the English pund.</p>
<p>So the coin was called a pund and eventually passed into modern English as a pound.</p>
<p>By the way, the terms pence and penny each derived from a separate Old English word,</p>
<p>which was penning.</p>
<p>But the American term cent for a penny developed after the establishment of the U.S. currency</p>
<p>after the American Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>Now as I&rsquo;ve mentioned in earlier episodes, cent ultimately comes from the Latin word</p>
<p>centum, meaning hundred.</p>
<p>And the word was shortened in French and the k sound became an s sound, thereby giving</p>
<p>us the word cent, as in percent, meaning per 100.</p>
<p>And it was in this sense that the word cent was used to refer to one one-hundredth of</p>
<p>a dollar.</p>
<p>And the word dime comes from the Latin word decima, which meant tenth, and has the same</p>
<p>root for ten, deca, which is found in words like decade and decathlon.</p>
<p>Of course a dime is one-tenth of a dollar.</p>
<p>And the k sound in the middle of the word decima eventually fell away and the word went</p>
<p>from decima to dime.</p>
<p>A quarter in modern English means one-fourth of something or one quarter of something.</p>
<p>And it comes to us from Latin where it meant the same thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we call the U.S. coin, which represents one-fourth of a dollar, a quarter.</p>
<p>A nickel is actually named for the metal nickel, which comprises about one-fourth</p>
<p>of a nickel&rsquo;s weight.</p>
<p>Nickel itself is a Germanic word originally used by miners to refer to a demonic spirit</p>
<p>believed to live in mines.</p>
<p>So what about the dollar?</p>
<p>Well dollar actually comes from the name of a coin that was minted in the area we know</p>
<p>today as Germany in the 1500s.</p>
<p>Around the year 1516, a silver mine was discovered in a small town in Bohemia called Jochemsthal.</p>
<p>And within a couple of years, one-ounce silver coins were being minted there.</p>
<p>The coin was called the Jochemsthaler.</p>
<p>And over time it was shortened to just thaler.</p>
<p>And the Dutch and Low German speakers pronounced it as dollar.</p>
<p>By the 1700s, the coin was being used internationally.</p>
<p>An English colonist in America used the term in reference to both the original German dollar</p>
<p>as well as to other coins that were designed to resemble it, like the Spanish peso.</p>
<p>And after the Revolutionary War in the United States, Thomas Jefferson recommended that</p>
<p>the dollar be used as the standard name of the currency of the new country.</p>
<p>This name was partly a demonstration of independence by the early American founders.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to use the term pound for the new currency since that term was associated</p>
<p>with Britain.</p>
<p>And since the Spanish peso was in common use in America at the time, and since the peso</p>
<p>was sometimes called a dollar in the U.S. since it resembled a German dollar coin, that</p>
<p>seemed like a good name for the new U.S. currency.</p>
<p>So the new currency became the dollar.</p>
<p>But what about a dollar bill?</p>
<p>Well the bill takes us back to the Romans.</p>
<p>Roman children often wore a round, bubble-like locket called a bulla.</p>
<p>And in the Middle Ages, it became common to seal official documents with a round, bubble-like</p>
<p>seal.</p>
<p>And this type of sealed official document came to be called a bulla as well.</p>
<p>And the term eventually became billa, and it meant an account or an invoice during the</p>
<p>Middle Ages.</p>
<p>And a bill of exchange eventually was shortened to simply bill to mean a piece of currency,</p>
<p>as in dollar bill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the root of the use of the term bill to mean a piece of legislation.</p>
<p>Now again, let&rsquo;s go back to Rome to the year 309 A.D.</p>
<p>So this would have been a couple of centuries after the empire had expanded into Britain.</p>
<p>And in that year, the Roman Emperor Constantine minted a coin called a solidus.</p>
<p>And this is the root of the English word solid, but more significantly it&rsquo;s the root of the</p>
<p>word soldier.</p>
<p>Soldier originally meant mercenary in Old French.</p>
<p>And payment to someone was called sold in Old French from the name of the early Roman</p>
<p>coin the solidus.</p>
<p>And that made a person who received payment to fight in a war a soldier.</p>
<p>The word came into English after the Norman invasion as soldier.</p>
<p>And speaking of paying Roman soldiers, I mentioned in an earlier episode that Roman</p>
<p>soldiers were paid a salt allowance, which was called a solarium, from the word sal,</p>
<p>meaning salt.</p>
<p>And this eventually gave us the word salary.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the basis of the phrase worth one&rsquo;s salt.</p>
<p>By the way, the term bank actually comes to us from medieval Italian, where modern banking</p>
<p>first emerged.</p>
<p>The moneylenders operated from bancas, which meant benches.</p>
<p>When an Italian moneylender ran out of money, his banca was disbanded and he became bancarodo,</p>
<p>which is the origin of the term bankrupt.</p>
<p>And speaking of bankruptcy, it reflects the fact that some people had lots of money and</p>
<p>some people had very little, if any at all.</p>
<p>And I noted earlier that these distinctions were important in Rome because the Roman legal</p>
<p>code actually made distinctions between wealthy men and poor men.</p>
<p>And I also noted that these distinctions can be seen in the evolution of the word villain</p>
<p>from the original Latin word villa for a home or estate in the country.</p>
<p>A common person or peasant was a villain, which eventually produced the English word</p>
<p>villain, meaning someone not to be trusted.</p>
<p>But again, this evolution of the word villa into villain happened after the Roman period.</p>
<p>As for the Romans themselves, they actually had lots of different terms for people.</p>
<p>And some of those terms were based around the class or social status of certain people.</p>
<p>The term populus was a very general term, which referred to human beings in general.</p>
<p>And from that word, we get words like people and population, which refers to the people</p>
<p>who inhabit a certain area and popular, which is something that reflects the wishes of the</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>Now the Latin word for father, which I&rsquo;ve mentioned quite a few times in this podcast</p>
<p>series was pater or pater.</p>
<p>This word was used as the basis of a Latin word describing wealthy, prominent, or powerful</p>
<p>Romans, basically Roman nobles and aristocrats.</p>
<p>This word was patricius, which ultimately produced the word patrician in modern English.</p>
<p>Now in contrast to the patricians, Rome also obviously had many commoners.</p>
<p>The Romans used the word plebe to refer to a commoner.</p>
<p>We sometimes see that word in English words like plebeian and plebiscite.</p>
<p>But the key here is to note that the Romans were making these general class distinctions</p>
<p>very early on.</p>
<p>The Romans also used the term vulgar to refer to lower class commoners.</p>
<p>And we see that word in the term vulgar Latin to refer to the Latin dialects of the common</p>
<p>people in various regions of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Originally it just referred to things associated with commoners.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s since taken on a much more negative connotation in modern times, and it&rsquo;s reflected</p>
<p>in modern English words like vulgar and vulgarity.</p>
<p>Another Latin word sometimes used for common people or peasants was the adjective paganus.</p>
<p>This eventually came to mean people who didn&rsquo;t serve in the military, so it came to mean</p>
<p>civilians.</p>
<p>During the spread of the early church, the early Christians considered themselves soldiers</p>
<p>of Christ.</p>
<p>So that term paganus came to describe those people who were not Christian soldiers or</p>
<p>not Christians, and it&rsquo;s the basis of the later English term pagan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an old saying that misery loves company, and that was probably true for the Romans</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>The Romans combined the words come, meaning with, and panis, meaning bread, to produce</p>
<p>the word companionium, which meant person with whom you shared bread or food.</p>
<p>This became the word companion in English, and it&rsquo;s also the root of the word company,</p>
<p>which initially meant a close relationship, as in we enjoy each other&rsquo;s company, but it</p>
<p>later came to mean a close business relationship, as in I&rsquo;m tired of working for this company.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve mentioned in earlier episodes that the Romans also had a term for crude or uncivilized</p>
<p>foreigners, which is passed into modern English.</p>
<p>That term was barbarian, and it was ultimately borrowed from Greek.</p>
<p>The Latin term barbarus was an adjective used to describe crude and savage foreigners.</p>
<p>Now medieval Latin created the term bravis, which meant cutthroat or villain, and some</p>
<p>linguists believe that this word bravis came from that original word barbarus, but this</p>
<p>etymology is disputed.</p>
<p>We do know that this word bravis created the word brave, meaning a wild savage, as in an</p>
<p>Indian brave, as used by European settlers in reference to Native Americans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the origin of the word bravo to describe a brave or bold performance.</p>
<p>And speaking of foreigners, there&rsquo;s another English word which has an interesting etymology</p>
<p>related to the Latin word for foreigners.</p>
<p>In an earlier episode of the podcast, I mentioned that the Latin term agar meant field in Latin.</p>
<p>It shares the same Indo-European root with the Greek word agros, which gives us modern</p>
<p>English words like agriculture.</p>
<p>And this same root provided the English word acre from Old English.</p>
<p>Well, the Romans combined the Latin prefix per, meaning through, with that Latin term</p>
<p>agar, meaning field, to create the term peregrinus, which literally meant through the field.</p>
<p>And this term was used to describe a visitor who came from another place and therefore</p>
<p>had to cross the field to arrive from elsewhere.</p>
<p>This term peregrinus evolved into the word pelegrin, which meant foreigner.</p>
<p>And this term eventually evolved into the modern English word pilgrim, but it was initially</p>
<p>used to refer to Christians who traveled to sacred sites and foreign lands, and it</p>
<p>also resulted in the term pilgrimage.</p>
<p>And lastly, in my look at Roman words for people, the Romans called a young boy a pupus</p>
<p>and a young girl a pupa.</p>
<p>Now, pupa also meant doll in Latin, so apparently they equated little girls and dolls.</p>
<p>Since those who began their learning in school were young boys and young girls, the terms</p>
<p>became the source of the word pupil in English, meaning a student.</p>
<p>The Romans also noticed that when you look into the very center of a person&rsquo;s eye, you</p>
<p>can see a very small image of yourself reflected in the eyeball.</p>
<p>They therefore used the word pupula, which literally meant little doll, to name that</p>
<p>part of the eye, which also became pupil in modern English.</p>
<p>The same word pupula, meaning little doll, is the source of the English word puppet.</p>
<p>And even the English word puppy, meaning little dog, also comes from the same word pupula.</p>
<p>So pupil, meaning a student, and pupil, meaning part of the eye, and puppet and puppy, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all derived from the same Latin root words.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn our attention back to Roman Britain.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted, despite problems in the North and the West, the Romans were able to establish</p>
<p>a strong foothold in the southern and eastern portions of Britain.</p>
<p>And in this region, Romanization was at its strongest.</p>
<p>And even though Latin had to compete with the native Celtic languages, it had its strongest</p>
<p>presence in this southeastern region.</p>
<p>The Latin names for the months, which I mentioned in the last episode, they began to be used</p>
<p>in Britain during this Roman period.</p>
<p>But the Germanic names for the days of the week would arrive later with the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>The Romans also had a version of bless you in response to a sneeze, and some historians</p>
<p>believe that the modern bless you came into Britain with the Romans during this period.</p>
<p>Wedding customs like a wedding cake, a wedding ring, a bridesmaid, and a brides veil, these</p>
<p>were all Roman wedding traditions which came into Britain with the Romans.</p>
<p>Also the tradition of putting flowers on a grave came to Britain with the Romans.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever heard someone say that their ears are burning because someone is</p>
<p>talking about them, well that too is a saying and belief that came to Britain with the Romans.</p>
<p>So at this point in our story, we now have the Roman Empire at its peak.</p>
<p>Its influence was spread throughout the Mediterranean and Western Europe.</p>
<p>But Rome&rsquo;s days were numbered.</p>
<p>To the east, the Roman army had pretty much given up on trying to conquer the vast territory</p>
<p>occupied by the Germanic-speaking tribes.</p>
<p>The Rhine and the Danube had become the de facto border between the Romans and the early</p>
<p>Germans.</p>
<p>And since Rome could no longer expand, economic decay began to set in.</p>
<p>Internal corruption and struggles for power made the problems even worse.</p>
<p>And all of this was exacerbated by invading Germanic tribes who sought to take advantage</p>
<p>of the weakening empire.</p>
<p>And one group of those tribes were the Anglo-Saxons who would eventually find their way to that</p>
<p>Romanized island of Britain in the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>So next time, I&rsquo;m going to begin looking at the Germanic tribes, who were the ancestors</p>
<p>of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>So until then, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
