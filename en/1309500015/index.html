<p>gonna add that to my resume</p>
<p>bringing relationships together</p>
<p>okay enough blabbing let&rsquo;s get into today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story which is about Matrice Richardson</p>
<p>and her very</p>
<p>sad story they&rsquo;re all sad</p>
<p>today I want to talk about Matrice</p>
<p>Richardson and she was born on April 30th 1985</p>
<p>her parents were Latisse Sutton</p>
<p>and Michael Richardson</p>
<p>latisse and</p>
<p>Michael they had met as juniors</p>
<p>at their high</p>
<p>school and then Lettis had become pregnant</p>
<p>when she was entering her</p>
<p>senior year of high school</p>
<p>she was determined so like to keep good grades</p>
<p>and just to be successful in life and she also had</p>
<p>moved in with her grandmother</p>
<p>Mildred and she was</p>
<p>considered more as lettie&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>than her grandmother</p>
<p>so she was very</p>
<p>close with her</p>
<p>when Matrice was born</p>
<p>her great Grandma</p>
<p>Mildred she would</p>
<p>watch over Matrice</p>
<p>so that Lettiece</p>
<p>and Michael</p>
<p>could go to</p>
<p>school and then when they</p>
<p>graduated also</p>
<p>Mildred she would</p>
<p>watch over Matrice</p>
<p>so both parents</p>
<p>could work so Michael</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s father well he was working at a fast food</p>
<p>restaurant and then he</p>
<p>ended up to start selling drugs on the side</p>
<p>it was a way to make easy</p>
<p>money was quick</p>
<p>it was way more</p>
<p>than what he made at the fast food restaurant</p>
<p>and he was just kind of living</p>
<p>living paycheck</p>
<p>to paycheck so he was like okay I&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>you know sell drugs it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what he wanted to do but it&rsquo;s what he did unfortunately</p>
<p>it just kind of got out of control and he</p>
<p>ended up getting caught and he</p>
<p>he ended up getting locked up he went to jail</p>
<p>and when he was locked up Matrice</p>
<p>was 4 years old so she was</p>
<p>still pretty</p>
<p>young he was sentenced to</p>
<p>serve 8 years in</p>
<p>state prison</p>
<p>and then in 1993</p>
<p>he was released</p>
<p>but Letteece</p>
<p>is girlfriend</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna wait around for him</p>
<p>while he was in jail I mean</p>
<p>she had a family</p>
<p>to take care of and she just had to keep</p>
<p>with her life he was in prison she</p>
<p>started to see</p>
<p>other people and she</p>
<p>ended up meeting a guy</p>
<p>named Larry</p>
<p>Sutton and then the 2</p>
<p>would end up</p>
<p>marrying and</p>
<p>Larry would become</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s stepfather</p>
<p>so at this time they were living in Los Angeles</p>
<p>and then in 1993 the LA riots</p>
<p>are going on</p>
<p>and if you were in Los Angeles like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it was I mean I wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>based off of</p>
<p>stuff I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>there was growing</p>
<p>violence and then there was a lot of racial tensions</p>
<p>going on so</p>
<p>Lettees and</p>
<p>Larry made the decision to move to</p>
<p>Covina which is</p>
<p>a Los Angeles suburb it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sound like it</p>
<p>would be that much different but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>way more quiet over there I mean I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like now not that it matters okay</p>
<p>so it was just more of like the</p>
<p>suburbs there was a lot of families there it was more</p>
<p>quiet and it gave Matrice</p>
<p>the opportunity</p>
<p>build a good future</p>
<p>do well in school</p>
<p>and not be surrounded by</p>
<p>all the city violence that was happening at that time</p>
<p>so from an early</p>
<p>age obvious that Matrice</p>
<p>was a pretty</p>
<p>smart cookie</p>
<p>her mom would</p>
<p>say in interviews that she used to tell Matrice</p>
<p>all the time that you can do whatever you want</p>
<p>in this life but you have to make sure to always give</p>
<p>100 and she</p>
<p>could achieve whatever her</p>
<p>heart desired</p>
<p>and then throughout</p>
<p>school Matrice</p>
<p>she always had</p>
<p>super high grades it</p>
<p>would be said that Matrice</p>
<p>would get kind of</p>
<p>bored throughout</p>
<p>school because it was almost too easy for her</p>
<p>I wish I had that problem in</p>
<p>school in middle</p>
<p>school she joined the cheerleading team</p>
<p>and she would continue</p>
<p>well into high</p>
<p>school where</p>
<p>she was involved in multiple cheerleading competitions</p>
<p>she also loved</p>
<p>dance she loved</p>
<p>dancing she was someone that everyone</p>
<p>loved to be around because she was just so</p>
<p>happy and it was like contagious and</p>
<p>she just was</p>
<p>sounded like a very very</p>
<p>great person</p>
<p>in high school though her interest in</p>
<p>doing outdoor</p>
<p>activities it</p>
<p>began to change</p>
<p>she just had no interest</p>
<p>in it before</p>
<p>she would play</p>
<p>outdoor sports or</p>
<p>go outside with her family and go for a walk</p>
<p>garden with her</p>
<p>grandmother</p>
<p>her great grandmother Matrice just kind of stopped</p>
<p>involving herself in that like she took no interest in</p>
<p>going outside she</p>
<p>started to say that she didn&rsquo;t like being around</p>
<p>like bugs and she didn&rsquo;t want to get dirty</p>
<p>so instead she</p>
<p>would just stay inside she would do</p>
<p>crossword puzzles</p>
<p>she would watch TV</p>
<p>dance write in her journal</p>
<p>so then when Matrice got her driver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>license I mean like</p>
<p>or any teenager it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best day of your life and then you&rsquo;re determined</p>
<p>to not walk anywhere</p>
<p>never walking</p>
<p>again I&rsquo;m only driving</p>
<p>so according to her</p>
<p>mother matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother she fell in love with</p>
<p>psychology and learning</p>
<p>about how the mind worked</p>
<p>why people did</p>
<p>certain things they did</p>
<p>and she was fascinated just overall with psychology</p>
<p>so then after high</p>
<p>school Matrice</p>
<p>she went on</p>
<p>to Cal State</p>
<p>Fullerton and it was</p>
<p>about 20 miles</p>
<p>south of Covina</p>
<p>rather than commuting driving back and forth</p>
<p>every day matrice&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>she suggested that Matrice</p>
<p>move in with her</p>
<p>great grandmother</p>
<p>Mildred that wasn&rsquo;t far from</p>
<p>school she was</p>
<p>there living by herself so she was more than</p>
<p>happy to have</p>
<p>somebody come live with her cause yeah</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna be</p>
<p>alone all the time</p>
<p>so Matrice was more than</p>
<p>happy to go stay with her</p>
<p>her great grandmother she jumped</p>
<p>right into the college life</p>
<p>she was just living it up so Matrice</p>
<p>was the first family</p>
<p>member to attend college and</p>
<p>much like she did in high</p>
<p>school she was</p>
<p>crushing it and she</p>
<p>quickly rise to the top she got onto the dean&rsquo;s list</p>
<p>and then she also</p>
<p>found a job working at Santa Fe</p>
<p>Springs Shop</p>
<p>shipping company Matrice</p>
<p>stood out as a top student</p>
<p>and she decided she wanted to pursue a career in</p>
<p>psychology and she was determined</p>
<p>to achieve that</p>
<p>and then in</p>
<p>2008 Matrice</p>
<p>graduated Cal</p>
<p>State Fullerton and</p>
<p>she was looking at grad</p>
<p>schools to pursue</p>
<p>her master&rsquo;s degree in</p>
<p>psychology as well she</p>
<p>taken a job dancing at Debras</p>
<p>which was a gay and lesbian</p>
<p>nightclub in Long Beach</p>
<p>it might still be there</p>
<p>but Matrice</p>
<p>she used a stage name</p>
<p>Hazel and she</p>
<p>printed business cards</p>
<p>and on the business card it had her</p>
<p>picture obviously</p>
<p>her name and matrice&rsquo;s real father Michael</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t approve of her</p>
<p>working at this</p>
<p>nightclub he warned her that this</p>
<p>could potentially lead her to a lot of</p>
<p>trouble or get herself into</p>
<p>trouble but Matrice said like she wasn&rsquo;t a stripper</p>
<p>she was just</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>you know like a go go dancer</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re a stripper there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that either so Matrice</p>
<p>tried to explain this to him but you know</p>
<p>dads they just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand and then</p>
<p>while dancing Matrice decided</p>
<p>to try modeling so she</p>
<p>began going to job interviews and like</p>
<p>sketchy ass areas</p>
<p>and friends were really concerned</p>
<p>that she could end up in a really bad situation and</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t meet up with</p>
<p>these people in</p>
<p>sketchy places</p>
<p>maybe go to a public</p>
<p>place but she wanted to pursue modeling</p>
<p>so during this time</p>
<p>um Matrice met this girl</p>
<p>named Vanessa</p>
<p>and I guess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to say because some people were saying</p>
<p>that they were dating and some people were saying</p>
<p>that Matrice was really interested in Vanessa but they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t dating because Vanessa technically had a</p>
<p>girlfriend there was some kind of like love triangle</p>
<p>going on and Matrice</p>
<p>really liked this girl Vanessa</p>
<p>and wanted to</p>
<p>pursue her but Vanessa was</p>
<p>not had the same feelings back</p>
<p>and then also during this time Matrice</p>
<p>she had attended a</p>
<p>party at the Playboy Mansion and she was a</p>
<p>guest model friends</p>
<p>could see that there was like something different</p>
<p>about Matrice</p>
<p>she seemed more stressed</p>
<p>and irritated and</p>
<p>they think it was because of the relationship that was</p>
<p>going on with Vanessa</p>
<p>again I&rsquo;m not 100 sure what</p>
<p>fully was going on but</p>
<p>she was in the picture</p>
<p>eventually Vanessa had told Matrice</p>
<p>that she needed</p>
<p>to back off or at</p>
<p>least she wasn&rsquo;t interested in her</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s when friends</p>
<p>really noticed a drastic</p>
<p>change in the way Matrice</p>
<p>had begun acting she just seemed</p>
<p>really withdrawn</p>
<p>matrice used to like call and text friends all the time</p>
<p>and she just</p>
<p>completely stopped and if she did it</p>
<p>would be like</p>
<p>weird text messages that didn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>and then friends noticed</p>
<p>on her Facebook</p>
<p>and her MySpace because MySpace was</p>
<p>still around then</p>
<p>I think they were constantly being updated with random</p>
<p>thoughts and</p>
<p>statements at all</p>
<p>hours of the day</p>
<p>one of the posts that she had posted was</p>
<p>have you ever woke up at 7 a</p>
<p>m crying on a Saturday</p>
<p>cause now that you see the</p>
<p>light you see all the people lost in the dark and</p>
<p>quote I mean I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>posts like this before</p>
<p>I guess have I</p>
<p>have you I don&rsquo;t know but it was just different for</p>
<p>something that Matrice</p>
<p>would be posting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the New Year</p>
<p>a magic spoon is perfect</p>
<p>for meeting your goals whether it&rsquo;s eating healthier</p>
<p>or saving more time in your morning routine</p>
<p>so as summer 2009 was coming to a</p>
<p>close her behaviors became more</p>
<p>erratic and</p>
<p>a little difficult to</p>
<p>track she started</p>
<p>to withdraw more like from friends and from family</p>
<p>in text messages matrice</p>
<p>would not make any</p>
<p>sense like her</p>
<p>sentences would be disjointed</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t appear to be connected to like any</p>
<p>particular topic</p>
<p>her explanations for her behavior</p>
<p>it made even less</p>
<p>sense on one occasion</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s mother Letees</p>
<p>she had texted her asking her</p>
<p>daughter like hey what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on matrice</p>
<p>responded with a text message that said</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing</p>
<p>a book because you told me I can be anything I wanted</p>
<p>you told me I was Miss America</p>
<p>you told me I was america&rsquo;s Next Top Model</p>
<p>now do you know what I want to be when I grow up Miss</p>
<p>Mother Nature</p>
<p>because Miss America</p>
<p>is fake ass</p>
<p>joke so I&rsquo;m trying to find my way to Michelle</p>
<p>Obama to see if she will talk to Mr</p>
<p>Obama about creating my position within the White House</p>
<p>and quote so this is</p>
<p>concerning to her</p>
<p>mother at least because like this isn&rsquo;t something that</p>
<p>matrice like what</p>
<p>what is going on</p>
<p>is what her mom is</p>
<p>realizing Matrice</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>have an explanation she&rsquo;s giving her kind of like</p>
<p>the run around or giving her text messages like that</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite make sense as to a</p>
<p>just what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on you know and then</p>
<p>on September 16th it began</p>
<p>like any normal last day</p>
<p>like they always do in</p>
<p>these stories</p>
<p>early in that morning</p>
<p>Letteece received a few text messages from her</p>
<p>daughter that</p>
<p>again didn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>a lot of sense</p>
<p>and according</p>
<p>to a co worker Matrice</p>
<p>she had showed up to the</p>
<p>shipping company that morning and</p>
<p>she was in a really good mood</p>
<p>everything seemed</p>
<p>normal but when Matrice</p>
<p>went on her</p>
<p>lunch break she didn&rsquo;t return</p>
<p>she hadn&rsquo;t told anybody</p>
<p>where she was</p>
<p>going or that she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be returning</p>
<p>and then on Wednesday</p>
<p>nights matrice</p>
<p>and her great</p>
<p>grandmother they</p>
<p>would sit down together and have dinner</p>
<p>but on this day</p>
<p>Matrice when she got home she explained that she had</p>
<p>a change of plans</p>
<p>she told her</p>
<p>great grandmother that the ocean</p>
<p>was calling her name she needed to go to the beach</p>
<p>so she told her</p>
<p>great grandmother hey I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>skip dinner just for tonight I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>drive down to Malibu along</p>
<p>the scenic Pacific</p>
<p>Coast Highway</p>
<p>and as far as Mildred knew her</p>
<p>great grandmother</p>
<p>everything seemed fine</p>
<p>there is nothing</p>
<p>concerning about</p>
<p>her behavior or her plans she didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think anything of it</p>
<p>matrice left the</p>
<p>house at around 5 p m</p>
<p>and headed towards Malibu</p>
<p>at least we</p>
<p>think sometime between 4 pm and 7 pm</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s aunt her name was Lauren</p>
<p>she came home</p>
<p>and then she saw</p>
<p>like all over her lawn</p>
<p>and the steps to the front door</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>bunch of business cards</p>
<p>everywhere and she when she</p>
<p>picked it up she looked and she saw that it was Matrice</p>
<p>her business cards were like scattered</p>
<p>everywhere and</p>
<p>she thought well oh like matrice must have stopped by</p>
<p>and she must have</p>
<p>dropped all these</p>
<p>why Matrice</p>
<p>went there nobody</p>
<p>nobody really knows Lauren the aunt she discovered</p>
<p>a strange note that was like tucked</p>
<p>under the windshield wiper of her husband&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>it was in matrice&rsquo;s handwriting</p>
<p>but it made</p>
<p>no sense there was a</p>
<p>smiley face</p>
<p>drawn on the page</p>
<p>along with the</p>
<p>statement quote I</p>
<p>Uncle Johnny Jimmy</p>
<p>nobody knows on the</p>
<p>right hand side of the letter was written quote</p>
<p>black women</p>
<p>scorned end</p>
<p>quote Lauren</p>
<p>the aunt she wasn&rsquo;t really sure</p>
<p>what to make of it I mean what</p>
<p>would you do I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I would do</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like okay</p>
<p>thanks she didn&rsquo;t really overthink it she</p>
<p>would go on</p>
<p>to say that she felt like in the pit of her stomach</p>
<p>that something just was off something wasn&rsquo;t right</p>
<p>and if you ever</p>
<p>have that feeling you need to listen to it</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s believed that Matrice</p>
<p>had arrived in Malibu</p>
<p>around 7 PM</p>
<p>she like stopped to watch the</p>
<p>sunset and then</p>
<p>she got back into her car and</p>
<p>began to drive</p>
<p>along Pacific</p>
<p>Coast Highway</p>
<p>which is a really beautiful</p>
<p>area you get a nice</p>
<p>view of the</p>
<p>ocean and just really pretty so</p>
<p>while she&rsquo;s driving she comes across this restaurant</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called joffrey&rsquo;s or jeffrey&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s joffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or jeffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and let me tell you this restaurant</p>
<p>is bougie okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one of those</p>
<p>places where</p>
<p>bread costs $50</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been there before</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have $1 menu</p>
<p>so Malibu is not really a</p>
<p>place that Matrice</p>
<p>you know has</p>
<p>spent like a</p>
<p>great deal of her time in</p>
<p>she sees this</p>
<p>place joffrey&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>she decides that she wants to go in and</p>
<p>enjoy the view and then get some</p>
<p>good food as well so she pulls into the parking lot</p>
<p>and the parking is valet</p>
<p>only valet man explained that like he was</p>
<p>gonna go park another car</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d come back get matrice&rsquo;s car and move that</p>
<p>so pretty much she&rsquo;s saying like just</p>
<p>hold on 5 minutes</p>
<p>so she agreed so then as soon as the valet</p>
<p>guy drove away</p>
<p>with another customer&rsquo;s car she got out of her car</p>
<p>and then she</p>
<p>climbed into the valet</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s car and</p>
<p>like another car that he had a park</p>
<p>or it was his car just had the valet</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s car when the valet</p>
<p>guy came back</p>
<p>now get matrice&rsquo;s car he saw that Matrice</p>
<p>was in this</p>
<p>other car and he was like what are you doing</p>
<p>her response to him was</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s subliminal</p>
<p>end quote so the valet guy is like</p>
<p>what are you doing</p>
<p>and then she</p>
<p>later explained to the valet</p>
<p>guy that she needed to avenge the</p>
<p>death of Michael Jackson</p>
<p>and then she just like sat in the car digging through</p>
<p>all of the Cds that were in this car wasn&rsquo;t her car</p>
<p>so then Matrice</p>
<p>she handed the valet guy</p>
<p>her car keys</p>
<p>and then she turns to the ballet</p>
<p>guy and she asks is Vanessa here</p>
<p>and the ballet guy</p>
<p>is like I don&rsquo;t know who the hell Vanessa is matrice</p>
<p>warned him to</p>
<p>watch out for a</p>
<p>woman with tattooed arms</p>
<p>matrice walks into the restaurant</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just kind of like</p>
<p>rousing around and the valet guy</p>
<p>tells the hostess to keep her eye</p>
<p>on Matrice because she was acting just really strange</p>
<p>so Matrice had</p>
<p>asked for a</p>
<p>table for one and she was led into the main dining area</p>
<p>now again like this place is</p>
<p>super fancy</p>
<p>I mean people don&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>dressed in like</p>
<p>tuxedos and</p>
<p>stuff but you know a little bit nicer</p>
<p>so Matrice did</p>
<p>stand out a</p>
<p>little bit because she was wearing a Bob Marley T</p>
<p>shirt and then she had a long</p>
<p>sleeve shirt</p>
<p>underneath it she</p>
<p>had on vans a pink alligator belt to hold up her jeans</p>
<p>she also had on rostafari and hat</p>
<p>so she orders a cocktail</p>
<p>and then she also</p>
<p>ordered a Kobe</p>
<p>steak which is like 65</p>
<p>not that it matters but like</p>
<p>treat yourself</p>
<p>but while waiting for</p>
<p>her food to come out</p>
<p>she noticed like a</p>
<p>table it was nearby</p>
<p>and it had a</p>
<p>group of people it was like</p>
<p>7 different people</p>
<p>so she approaches this table</p>
<p>and she kind of invites herself in</p>
<p>their party the people that were seated</p>
<p>they said that</p>
<p>Matrice was just making really strange comments</p>
<p>she told this</p>
<p>table that she was from another planet</p>
<p>that her mom was planet</p>
<p>Earth so then</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s food comes out</p>
<p>so she goes back to her</p>
<p>table and she eats for 65</p>
<p>it better be a life changing</p>
<p>state so then once Matrice was done</p>
<p>eating her meal she went</p>
<p>over back over to the table</p>
<p>of people that she was talking to</p>
<p>once they were done eating they paid</p>
<p>their Bill and then they were getting</p>
<p>ready to leave</p>
<p>and I guess Matrice</p>
<p>she got up and she started to</p>
<p>leave with them</p>
<p>she told the people at the</p>
<p>table that she was</p>
<p>going to Hawaii soon</p>
<p>and that she</p>
<p>would contact them when she arrived</p>
<p>so then Matrice</p>
<p>was following the 7</p>
<p>individuals out of the restaurant</p>
<p>cause they were getting</p>
<p>ready to leave so Matrice was like following with them</p>
<p>but she was stopped by the manager</p>
<p>and said like</p>
<p>where are you going you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t paid your Bill yet and her Bill was like</p>
<p>it was like 90</p>
<p>for the 2 things she</p>
<p>ordered and</p>
<p>so the manager was like you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t paid</p>
<p>and Matrice was saying that her Bill was paid for</p>
<p>that the people at the</p>
<p>table they paid for it</p>
<p>and the manager said like</p>
<p>no the manager</p>
<p>asked Matrice</p>
<p>well they didn&rsquo;t pay for it you have to pay us</p>
<p>how are you</p>
<p>gonna pay for this</p>
<p>and Matrice</p>
<p>responded by saying</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m busted what are we gonna do</p>
<p>matrice also told the manager that she was from Mars</p>
<p>she emptied out her pockets to show that she had no</p>
<p>money so since she was not able to pay</p>
<p>the Bill and her odd behavior</p>
<p>the manager told the hostess to call the police</p>
<p>while on the</p>
<p>phone with the police</p>
<p>the hostess explained what was going on</p>
<p>and the hostess</p>
<p>explained that like this customer she&rsquo;s on drugs or</p>
<p>she might have some like mental issues</p>
<p>so police were in route</p>
<p>okay so then the hostess allowed Matrice</p>
<p>to make a phone call and the only</p>
<p>phone number Matrice</p>
<p>could seem to remember was mildred&rsquo;s number her</p>
<p>great grandmother she called her</p>
<p>great grandmother Mildred</p>
<p>and Mildred</p>
<p>actually offered</p>
<p>to give her credit card information over the</p>
<p>phone so that she</p>
<p>could pay the Bill</p>
<p>but unfortunately the the restaurant</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t accept her credit card number over the</p>
<p>phone um she had to be there in person to like</p>
<p>you know sign the receipt</p>
<p>which I think is really stupid</p>
<p>cause I feel like I&rsquo;ve been places</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve accepted credit card payment over the</p>
<p>phone but I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so now it was like 9 p</p>
<p>m at night and</p>
<p>3 officers arrived</p>
<p>at joffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and the officers</p>
<p>asked them a tree some questions like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on trying to see like</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>mentally and Matrice says that</p>
<p>her wallet was in her car</p>
<p>and she could pay for it</p>
<p>cause her wallet was</p>
<p>simply in her car so then the officers they</p>
<p>started looking through her car to retrieve her wallet</p>
<p>but when they were</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>her car they realized it was a mess there was just</p>
<p>stuff everywhere</p>
<p>papers garbage</p>
<p>items all over the</p>
<p>place they could not</p>
<p>find her wallet but they did find her license</p>
<p>and they also</p>
<p>found a small amount of marijuana</p>
<p>like it wasn&rsquo;t enough to warrant</p>
<p>an arrest it</p>
<p>could easily just have been</p>
<p>taken care of with a misdemeanor</p>
<p>ticket so then Matrice</p>
<p>was given a sobriety</p>
<p>test and she</p>
<p>ended up passing like she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>under the influence of anything</p>
<p>when they couldn&rsquo;t locate her wallet that&rsquo;s when they</p>
<p>asked the manager okay</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>wanna Joe do you</p>
<p>wanna let her go or do you</p>
<p>wanna like press charges</p>
<p>and the owner decided that he wanted to</p>
<p>press charges</p>
<p>against Matrice</p>
<p>so at this time Matrice</p>
<p>is 24 years old I don&rsquo;t know if I ever mentioned that</p>
<p>but she was handcuffed</p>
<p>and she was placed into the back of the patrol car</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>taken down to sheriff&rsquo;s station</p>
<p>so I believe that the restaurant was on the phone</p>
<p>with matrice&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>grandmother Mildred</p>
<p>and then Mildred</p>
<p>was told that Matrice was</p>
<p>going down to the police station mildred</p>
<p>called matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother and let her know like what was going on</p>
<p>so then matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother called the police station</p>
<p>and she had asked</p>
<p>the police station is Matrice</p>
<p>going to be released tonight or tomorrow</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen because</p>
<p>she was gonna</p>
<p>drive down there</p>
<p>to the police station to pick up Matrice</p>
<p>but if she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to be released</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t wanna bother driving all the way out there</p>
<p>to pick her up because she had a 10 year old</p>
<p>daughter at home who was</p>
<p>still sleeping</p>
<p>so it was just gonna be</p>
<p>an inconvenience to</p>
<p>drive all the way down there</p>
<p>for her to not even</p>
<p>get released</p>
<p>the police station informed her</p>
<p>which will be released tomorrow</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll make sure to have</p>
<p>Matrice call you</p>
<p>and let you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on and what not</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>is like okay well you know I&rsquo;ll wait for the call</p>
<p>at least like I don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>drive all the way out there tonight</p>
<p>and matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother later on</p>
<p>would say like oh</p>
<p>I was kind of glad</p>
<p>knowing that she was safe and</p>
<p>locked up all</p>
<p>night versus</p>
<p>her just being out there cause</p>
<p>really out of</p>
<p>character for her to be acting like this and</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want her out on the</p>
<p>street cause</p>
<p>who knows what</p>
<p>would happen</p>
<p>so her mom was kind of not</p>
<p>happy that she got in</p>
<p>trouble had</p>
<p>peace of mind</p>
<p>knowing that Matrice</p>
<p>would be in a safe spot</p>
<p>so once my Teresa</p>
<p>arrived she was put in a cell she was being</p>
<p>charged for</p>
<p>possession of marijuana</p>
<p>and defrauding an innkeeper</p>
<p>which I thought was</p>
<p>weird because</p>
<p>I thought she didn&rsquo;t have enough marijuana to be</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what she was being</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>and for some odd reason</p>
<p>when Matrice was arrested</p>
<p>the deputy who was filing the</p>
<p>paperwork and whatnot</p>
<p>they made no mention and no notes</p>
<p>about matrice&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>like she was acting and saying strange</p>
<p>things and normally you</p>
<p>would kind of take note of this</p>
<p>there was nothing written in the reports that</p>
<p>would suggest</p>
<p>any questions existed</p>
<p>about her mental</p>
<p>state at the time</p>
<p>the reason for this has been</p>
<p>heavily debated</p>
<p>and the general consensus</p>
<p>seems to believe</p>
<p>that this was done either to</p>
<p>avoid the additional</p>
<p>paperwork or because the deputy</p>
<p>felt that Matrice was fine</p>
<p>had she been written</p>
<p>in as possibly being</p>
<p>mentally unstable she</p>
<p>could have been held</p>
<p>under a closer observation</p>
<p>or she could have even</p>
<p>been brought down for a 72 hour</p>
<p>psych holds</p>
<p>and evaluation</p>
<p>according to the call log book Matrice</p>
<p>had placed 4 different</p>
<p>phone calls and it was</p>
<p>scene is kind of</p>
<p>weird because she made 4</p>
<p>phone calls but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re unsure who they were too</p>
<p>one of them was not</p>
<p>to her great</p>
<p>grandmother</p>
<p>which was the only</p>
<p>phone number she seemed to remember</p>
<p>and unfortunately of course</p>
<p>like that night</p>
<p>normally in jail like there&rsquo;s a pay</p>
<p>phone and anyone who got arrested can make a</p>
<p>phone call normally</p>
<p>when they make</p>
<p>these phone calls they are recorded</p>
<p>but of course</p>
<p>pay phone was out of</p>
<p>order that day or night</p>
<p>so they had Matrice</p>
<p>use the phone</p>
<p>on their desk like it was just a normal</p>
<p>phone and it wasn&rsquo;t recorded recorded</p>
<p>nobody knows who she</p>
<p>called multiple deputies who were interviewed they all</p>
<p>heard Matrice</p>
<p>talking on the phone</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who she was talking to or what they can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>what exactly she was saying but they know that she was</p>
<p>on the phone and she</p>
<p>was talking whether she was talking to somebody or not</p>
<p>she could have even</p>
<p>just been talking to herself pretending she was on the</p>
<p>phone but I</p>
<p>guess we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never really know</p>
<p>meanwhile at home</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s mother she was like getting</p>
<p>ready for bed she was</p>
<p>kind of waiting to see if</p>
<p>matrice was</p>
<p>gonna call her but she</p>
<p>never came through so okay well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wake up</p>
<p>early and then I&rsquo;ll head out</p>
<p>there and get it all settled and see what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>that was her plan</p>
<p>her mother had gone asleep</p>
<p>so then September 17th</p>
<p>at 5 20 a m</p>
<p>Latisse matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother she calls a</p>
<p>sheriff station and ask what it</p>
<p>would cost to bail her</p>
<p>daughter out or like how it works really she</p>
<p>was informed that Matrice had been released overnight</p>
<p>suspicious so then when she finds out that Matrice</p>
<p>has been released she&rsquo;s like um</p>
<p>what and she</p>
<p>asked why has Matrice</p>
<p>been released</p>
<p>like you guys told me she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna be released</p>
<p>this morning the person on the</p>
<p>phone with her mom said well she</p>
<p>was released because she had no previous like record</p>
<p>and her charges they were not like big enough</p>
<p>to warrant holding her</p>
<p>it would have been</p>
<p>against the</p>
<p>department&rsquo;s policy to hold her overnight</p>
<p>so why&rsquo;d they bring her</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>again I know nothing</p>
<p>they said on the</p>
<p>phone that Matrice was told okay she could</p>
<p>you could stay in the cell if you want to</p>
<p>that way you have somewhere to stay tonight</p>
<p>and Matrice</p>
<p>turned them down</p>
<p>and then they also offered her to stay in the</p>
<p>lobby and wait</p>
<p>and Matrice also said no no thanks</p>
<p>so they told matrice&rsquo;s mom on the</p>
<p>phone this like she didn&rsquo;t want to stay</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t force her</p>
<p>when asked about matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>state of mind the sheriff&rsquo;s department said</p>
<p>that she was showing like no signs of a mental illness</p>
<p>she was an intoxicated she was fine</p>
<p>quote she&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>adult end quote</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not wrong</p>
<p>about that like they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>force her to stay if she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to stay but</p>
<p>so Matrice had been released at 1215 a</p>
<p>m She had no car she had</p>
<p>no money her wallet was in her her car no money</p>
<p>she had no phone no food nothing like</p>
<p>1215 in the morning</p>
<p>she was released bye</p>
<p>what are you supposed to do she can&rsquo;t get anywhere</p>
<p>1215 in the morning a</p>
<p>young woman like what</p>
<p>jeez yeah she&rsquo;ll be fine</p>
<p>her car was</p>
<p>actually at an impound center that was like 15</p>
<p>miles away so it&rsquo;s not like she was</p>
<p>flipping close</p>
<p>and even if she did get there most likely they</p>
<p>would be closed</p>
<p>so like what was she supposed to do</p>
<p>at no point did deputies or anyone</p>
<p>offer her a ride so</p>
<p>again what is she supposed to do what did they</p>
<p>think was gonna happen</p>
<p>so then lettie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s mother she calls everyone</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s calling everyone to see like hey have you</p>
<p>heard from Matrice</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s calling around just trying to see</p>
<p>maybe Matrice</p>
<p>like showed up somewhere</p>
<p>and like just didn&rsquo;t let her know I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so when she&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>these calls she&rsquo;s realizing</p>
<p>nobody has heard from Matrice like</p>
<p>nobody knows</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>and she starts to kind of like</p>
<p>freak she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>starts to panic</p>
<p>as any of us</p>
<p>would so then</p>
<p>leticia&rsquo;s feeling</p>
<p>worried she&rsquo;s feeling scared</p>
<p>so she and just really upset</p>
<p>so she calls</p>
<p>the sheriff station back it&rsquo;s been 15 minutes</p>
<p>since her last call</p>
<p>she calls them back and she&rsquo;s like I</p>
<p>wanna file a missing persons report on my</p>
<p>daughter because</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s seen her nobody knows</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on like I&rsquo;m really worried</p>
<p>and she was told over the</p>
<p>phone that they usually wait</p>
<p>about 24 hours</p>
<p>unless there</p>
<p>are serious circumstances</p>
<p>but for the most part you</p>
<p>should wait 24</p>
<p>hours because</p>
<p>she might show up the police station had convinced</p>
<p>Leticia to just wait</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll show up just wait</p>
<p>so then back at the police station it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about 6 30 a m</p>
<p>The sheriff station they receive a</p>
<p>phone call from a guy</p>
<p>named Bill Smith</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a retired reporter who</p>
<p>lived in an area called Monte</p>
<p>Nido monte Nido</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>Malibu area</p>
<p>but over there there&rsquo;s a lot of canyons</p>
<p>hiking area</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ranches</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not far from the station it&rsquo;s like 6</p>
<p>miles from the police station anyways</p>
<p>so this Bill guy he calls the sheriff&rsquo;s office he says</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>young lady she&rsquo;s a slim</p>
<p>black woman with Afro hair walking through his backyard</p>
<p>those are his words according to this guy Mr</p>
<p>Smith he asked</p>
<p>the woman is she all right like</p>
<p>first of all you&rsquo;re in my backyard but</p>
<p>are you all right</p>
<p>and she said that she was just resting</p>
<p>so then this guy Mr Smith</p>
<p>he goes back into</p>
<p>doing whatever it is he was doing at the time</p>
<p>he kind of like goes back to doing that</p>
<p>and then he looks out his window again</p>
<p>to see if she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still there</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>so he called the police</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>houses like</p>
<p>crammed on top of one</p>
<p>another out there it&rsquo;s like a lot of land and what not</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>where this lady come from</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>second of all</p>
<p>where is she going</p>
<p>3rd of all why is she in my yard</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why he called the police in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>cause at first I was like why do you call the police</p>
<p>on that but I</p>
<p>guess people just call the police so then a deputy</p>
<p>goes out to see this Bill guy and</p>
<p>check on to see if the woman</p>
<p>still there</p>
<p>but when the sheriff went out</p>
<p>there they didn&rsquo;t find anybody they didn&rsquo;t see anybody</p>
<p>who was just wandering</p>
<p>around they didn&rsquo;t find anyone who fit the description</p>
<p>so that was really that so then matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother Lettice</p>
<p>she arrived at the station and she finally</p>
<p>was like okay I need to file a missing person&rsquo;s report</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a couple</p>
<p>hours now she</p>
<p>still hasn&rsquo;t shown up I need to file this report so</p>
<p>while she was there</p>
<p>the police officers were like oh we got a call from</p>
<p>this guy out in Monte</p>
<p>Nito we got a call from this guy out there and they</p>
<p>think like they spotted her out there</p>
<p>so then Letteece was</p>
<p>given directions</p>
<p>where this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house was or like how to get there</p>
<p>so Lettis she fouls the missing</p>
<p>persons report</p>
<p>and then she heads out to the area where</p>
<p>maybe somebody saw</p>
<p>a trace latisse</p>
<p>would say that she had that really bad gut feeling</p>
<p>she was like I just know something&rsquo;s up something&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right now the area that Matrice</p>
<p>may have been at</p>
<p>it was really difficult</p>
<p>to get there it was extremely rugged and remote with</p>
<p>steep canyons difficult terrain</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t easy to</p>
<p>go looking for somebody</p>
<p>or something out there</p>
<p>matrice matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother she stated that matrice</p>
<p>she hated walking</p>
<p>she did not like being out in nature and she was</p>
<p>deathly afraid of the dark so didn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>as to why she</p>
<p>would be out there</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like no</p>
<p>street lights or anything</p>
<p>it was at night time it was it&rsquo;s like pitch</p>
<p>black out there it&rsquo;s just the moonlight</p>
<p>which is kind of</p>
<p>nice but like not really if you&rsquo;re scared of the dark</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still talking why am I</p>
<p>still talking 48</p>
<p>hours after matrice&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>on September 19th that&rsquo;s when the</p>
<p>first official</p>
<p>search went</p>
<p>ahead and some reports say it was 8 hours</p>
<p>after matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disappearance but the family says it was 48</p>
<p>hours later so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a big difference too</p>
<p>so they brought out a</p>
<p>tracking dog or the</p>
<p>search dogs that</p>
<p>smell stuff and they brought him to bill&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>Mr Smith remember him</p>
<p>so they brought the</p>
<p>dog out there to see if he picked up matrice&rsquo;s scent</p>
<p>in hopes that they get led in the</p>
<p>right direction</p>
<p>and the dog picks up matrice&rsquo;s scent</p>
<p>and the dog led them up to like a nearby neighbor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and then</p>
<p>the scent was lost</p>
<p>so the search lasted</p>
<p>about 8 hours</p>
<p>and then they called it off so then</p>
<p>4 days go by it&rsquo;s now September 23rd and the case is</p>
<p>transferred from LAPD</p>
<p>Missing Persons Unit to</p>
<p>their robbery</p>
<p>homicide Division</p>
<p>so the first</p>
<p>thing that they wanted to do was examine</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>and see if there&rsquo;s any like signs or</p>
<p>indications of</p>
<p>where maybe she was going</p>
<p>like her plan</p>
<p>for the day was</p>
<p>phone numbers</p>
<p>whatever they could find</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;ll find something in the car</p>
<p>once detectives are going</p>
<p>her car they come across matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phone and her wallet</p>
<p>which is in the car</p>
<p>and in her wallet was her debit card</p>
<p>so they check like her big</p>
<p>bank statements to make she&rsquo;s not withdrawing</p>
<p>money or anything or</p>
<p>they go through her bank</p>
<p>statements and they</p>
<p>see like she has over $2,000 in her bank account so she</p>
<p>could have easily paid her Bill in the</p>
<p>first place if she had</p>
<p>been able to go get her wallet from her car</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of like oh my gosh all this</p>
<p>could have just been</p>
<p>prevented if she</p>
<p>was able to go get her wallet</p>
<p>they also found her</p>
<p>journal in her car and</p>
<p>so they go through her journal</p>
<p>it would kind of help them see</p>
<p>maybe what her mindset was</p>
<p>before disappearing and a</p>
<p>psychologist working with LAPD speculated</p>
<p>that Matrice was most likely suffering from</p>
<p>some kind of mental illness specifically like</p>
<p>maybe possibly it was bipolar disorder</p>
<p>the media picks up the story</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re saying that a</p>
<p>young African American woman</p>
<p>has been arrested and brought to the sheriff&rsquo;s station</p>
<p>and then allowed her to</p>
<p>leave on her own</p>
<p>despite questions of her mental health the arguments</p>
<p>quickly became a question of why</p>
<p>deputies didn&rsquo;t offer her a ride when</p>
<p>just a few years</p>
<p>earlier Mel Gibson was arrested for a DUI</p>
<p>and he was brought to the same station</p>
<p>he was booked and</p>
<p>everything and then once he was released</p>
<p>police gave him a ride</p>
<p>back to his vehicle</p>
<p>so everyone saying like a</p>
<p>famous actor</p>
<p>Mel Gibson why are they giving him a ride and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not able to give a</p>
<p>young woman a ride at 12 in the morning</p>
<p>when she has no car or wallet</p>
<p>or phone like</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>point I agree</p>
<p>so matrice&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>obviously they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>angry plus her</p>
<p>heart broken like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s their</p>
<p>daughter at</p>
<p>where is their</p>
<p>daughter at</p>
<p>so matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother wants to know</p>
<p>why her daughter was released when she had been</p>
<p>assured that she</p>
<p>would be held</p>
<p>and not released</p>
<p>until the morning the sheriff&rsquo;s department</p>
<p>denied any knowledge</p>
<p>of matrice&rsquo;s possible mental health issues but</p>
<p>there was an</p>
<p>email from September</p>
<p>20th between the station&rsquo;s lieutenant</p>
<p>and captain</p>
<p>which the lieutenant</p>
<p>explained that</p>
<p>he felt she was acting unusual and uneasy</p>
<p>about letting her go like this is what it says in the</p>
<p>email and then the sheriff station</p>
<p>they stand by</p>
<p>the fact that they had no idea and they don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>recollection of writing this email</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t say this even though there was like an</p>
<p>email side note</p>
<p>side note these cases</p>
<p>especially when like</p>
<p>maybe the the police are like</p>
<p>the bad ones here</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they just own up and say we made a</p>
<p>great mistake like I</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get that why do they always</p>
<p>stand by the fact that they did</p>
<p>everything right</p>
<p>and then in the end</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t and then it makes them look even</p>
<p>worse like why do they do that</p>
<p>can someone explain</p>
<p>so due to like obvious</p>
<p>conflicting information</p>
<p>tensions were</p>
<p>growing between the family and law enforcement</p>
<p>so letteece</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>she hired a</p>
<p>civil rights attorney</p>
<p>several months have passed</p>
<p>but the family and friends</p>
<p>still they searched the area</p>
<p>they handed out flyers trying to keep and</p>
<p>bring awareness</p>
<p>about matrice&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>just reminding people to keep</p>
<p>their eyes open</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t forget</p>
<p>about her and then January 9th</p>
<p>2010 so 4 months after the</p>
<p>disappearance</p>
<p>authorities volunteers</p>
<p>search and rescue teams</p>
<p>totaling to about</p>
<p>250 individuals they</p>
<p>searched the area that Matrice was last seen</p>
<p>they were looking for anything a shoelace</p>
<p>clothing crumbs</p>
<p>they were just looking for anything</p>
<p>that would hopefully</p>
<p>give them some answers and</p>
<p>nothing not a shred of evidence was found</p>
<p>shortly after the</p>
<p>search for Matrice</p>
<p>Michael matrice&rsquo;s real father</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s driving</p>
<p>out to Las Vegas</p>
<p>he reports seeing Matrice</p>
<p>and he alleges to have seen her working as a prostitute</p>
<p>and speculates</p>
<p>that she may have been recruited by someone</p>
<p>she met through</p>
<p>the Playboy Mansion or</p>
<p>dancing at her job</p>
<p>and then according to Michael</p>
<p>he says that he called out her name</p>
<p>he was yelling matrice</p>
<p>matrice and he runs</p>
<p>after her but the</p>
<p>woman whoever it was</p>
<p>she ran off into the crowd</p>
<p>but Michael was like I saw her I know I did</p>
<p>so March 29th</p>
<p>which is like 6 months</p>
<p>after the disappearance</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s family is brought in</p>
<p>to the sheriff&rsquo;s station</p>
<p>sheriff&rsquo;s department</p>
<p>to be shown</p>
<p>the surveillance footage</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been asking for this footage for a long time</p>
<p>but the police officers constantly said over and over</p>
<p>again that there was no surveillance cameras and that</p>
<p>they have cameras in the station but they don&rsquo;t record</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just there to monitor</p>
<p>they kept telling the family over and over</p>
<p>again there is no</p>
<p>there is no footage there is nothing</p>
<p>nothing at all</p>
<p>they magically find this footage</p>
<p>cause yeah civil</p>
<p>Rights Attorney was like really pushing for it heavy</p>
<p>so good for them</p>
<p>so frustrating</p>
<p>because if they didn&rsquo;t have an attorney or somebody</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know but they probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have seen the footage</p>
<p>anyway so out of thin air</p>
<p>this footage appeared</p>
<p>magically appears poof</p>
<p>they have footage</p>
<p>oh weird they</p>
<p>watch the footage and they see that okay like</p>
<p>Matrice is acting</p>
<p>really weird</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s holding onto the cell bars and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>swaying her body from side to side</p>
<p>she looked like she was really agitated</p>
<p>annoyed her family says her behavior</p>
<p>is abnormal</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s acting it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;s acting very strange</p>
<p>and the sheriff&rsquo;s department</p>
<p>disagree they&rsquo;re like no she looked normal to us</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we released her but</p>
<p>based off the footage the official release time was</p>
<p>about 12 28 am</p>
<p>the jailer walks around the door</p>
<p>and as the jailer is reentering another deputy</p>
<p>can be seen exiting the</p>
<p>building the family had been told that</p>
<p>no deputies were present at the time of her release</p>
<p>and now they</p>
<p>begin to wonder like hey</p>
<p>did this deputy</p>
<p>give her a ride</p>
<p>did he have</p>
<p>something to do with it did he see something like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s this guy at</p>
<p>so then the deputy that was seen leaving he was</p>
<p>interviewed or</p>
<p>asked questions</p>
<p>and he said I didn&rsquo;t see her leaving I don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>these skies are</p>
<p>super helpful</p>
<p>now in June a former friend of matrice&rsquo;s believes he</p>
<p>spotted her</p>
<p>in Las Vegas as well</p>
<p>so according to this guy he</p>
<p>saw her in a casino he called</p>
<p>out her name she appeared nervous and then ran away so</p>
<p>since this is 2 times now someone spotted her or</p>
<p>thinks they spotted her in Las Vegas</p>
<p>investigators were sent out there to</p>
<p>investigate</p>
<p>more than 70 people had reported seeing Matrice</p>
<p>there but after looking around and</p>
<p>investigating questioning people they</p>
<p>did not come across her and they</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t seem to find</p>
<p>where she could</p>
<p>be at so that was the end of that so then August 9</p>
<p>2010 2 park rangers were out there in that Monte</p>
<p>Nito place nido</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re like walking around</p>
<p>hiking this</p>
<p>area extremely difficult to walk in this area and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>known as the Dark Canyon</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s incredibly</p>
<p>steep it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>to maneuver through this Canyon like they</p>
<p>do not recommend</p>
<p>anybody really go out there</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s rough</p>
<p>okay during</p>
<p>their descent they kind of discover</p>
<p>what seems to be</p>
<p>a body they see a skull with</p>
<p>curls of dark hair</p>
<p>still attached</p>
<p>nearby there were</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s clothing</p>
<p>the remains</p>
<p>later would be confirmed to be</p>
<p>those of Matrice</p>
<p>so matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right leg was located</p>
<p>about 6ft up</p>
<p>from the Canyon from</p>
<p>where her body had been</p>
<p>found and then there were no</p>
<p>signs of animals having</p>
<p>found or disturbed the body</p>
<p>her left arm was flexed</p>
<p>tightly and what baffles</p>
<p>law enforcement officials is the idea that Matrice</p>
<p>could have been</p>
<p>lying in that Canyon for nearly a year</p>
<p>and yet no animals</p>
<p>found her her body seemed undisturbed this</p>
<p>particular area</p>
<p>I mean they have coyotes they have scavenger birds</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s suspicious</p>
<p>also this area</p>
<p>where matrice&rsquo;s remains were</p>
<p>found it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>difficult to get there so the corner like couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get up there</p>
<p>with their car</p>
<p>apparently they had to take matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>by a helicopter</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t able to get</p>
<p>pictures of how matrice</p>
<p>her body and her remains were found</p>
<p>luckily one of the park ranger guys he actually took a</p>
<p>photo on his cell phone</p>
<p>and that was like the</p>
<p>photo that was used</p>
<p>to see the scene</p>
<p>so according</p>
<p>to the medical examiner there was no signs of</p>
<p>trauma to the body</p>
<p>no outward signs of physical violence</p>
<p>nothing to explain</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>her cause of</p>
<p>death is ruled to be undetermined</p>
<p>the only clothing that was recovered was</p>
<p>her jeans and a belt</p>
<p>and bra 2 of her</p>
<p>shirts were missing</p>
<p>socks underwear</p>
<p>shoes they were all missing they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>located like around the</p>
<p>area at all police said animals must have gone to them</p>
<p>so what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying is animals now know how to undress people</p>
<p>you better watch out you guys</p>
<p>next time you&rsquo;re out camping a coyote</p>
<p>might try and take off your</p>
<p>clothes I&rsquo;m being facetious</p>
<p>because why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t they mess with</p>
<p>the body if it&rsquo;s been almost like a year now</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense so Letteece</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>decided to hire a forensic anthropologist</p>
<p>so he takes a look at the</p>
<p>photographs that were</p>
<p>taken when they</p>
<p>found matresa&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and remember they were</p>
<p>taken on a cell</p>
<p>phone because they couldn&rsquo;t get proper</p>
<p>photos of the</p>
<p>scene and what not</p>
<p>when they originally</p>
<p>found matrice&rsquo;s body her</p>
<p>skull was completely detached</p>
<p>and it was resting</p>
<p>upside on the</p>
<p>upper torso</p>
<p>5 of her neck bones were not recovered</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s hard to believe her body was</p>
<p>still intact which</p>
<p>was what the sheriff and lieutenants were saying</p>
<p>when they found her body</p>
<p>everything was like untouched</p>
<p>but they were lying</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know why why are you lying</p>
<p>and then the forensic anthropologist had a</p>
<p>great deal of questions</p>
<p>about the way matrice&rsquo;s remains</p>
<p>were discovered in an interview he was explained that</p>
<p>the left arm it was like flexed and it was like in a</p>
<p>weird position something that</p>
<p>would not happen if you</p>
<p>died the way she had supposedly died</p>
<p>he knew like it</p>
<p>could not be created by environmental conditions</p>
<p>where the body was</p>
<p>found there was nothing present to hold her arm in</p>
<p>such a position that was</p>
<p>defying gravity</p>
<p>and he says the initial assumption</p>
<p>should have been homicide</p>
<p>and the scene</p>
<p>should have been</p>
<p>treated as such</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>matrice&rsquo;s hair wasn&rsquo;t examined at all</p>
<p>some hair was</p>
<p>still attached to her skull</p>
<p>but other hairs were</p>
<p>found nearby</p>
<p>there were some reports that said it was like her hair</p>
<p>and there were some</p>
<p>other reports that said it was like</p>
<p>someone else&rsquo;s hair but an earring was</p>
<p>found tangled up in her hair as well</p>
<p>and it was not attached to her body</p>
<p>but it was an earring which</p>
<p>Matrice was not</p>
<p>reported to be wearing at the time that she vanished</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t examined at all</p>
<p>and then matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>remains and</p>
<p>clothing were not examined for</p>
<p>fibers or hairs related to the possible suspect</p>
<p>the surrounding area wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>checked for</p>
<p>blood he noticed that matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>teeth had a pinkish hue to them</p>
<p>which could suggest</p>
<p>strangulation but the neck bones</p>
<p>are necessary to determine</p>
<p>if it was a strangulation but they were</p>
<p>never recovered no one knows</p>
<p>where her neck bones are</p>
<p>so then July</p>
<p>2011 matrice&rsquo;s body was exhumed and</p>
<p>it was brought to the LA sheriff&rsquo;s Department crime lab</p>
<p>for examination the corner came to the same conclusion</p>
<p>which was undetermined</p>
<p>cause of death and no signs of homicide which</p>
<p>why I don&rsquo;t know so this</p>
<p>upsets the family as it</p>
<p>should lettis and Michael</p>
<p>they both separately</p>
<p>filed lawsuits</p>
<p>against the LA sheriff&rsquo;s Department</p>
<p>which was settled</p>
<p>and both of them were awarded a good amount of</p>
<p>money the sheriff&rsquo;s Department they do not and</p>
<p>will not seem to</p>
<p>admit that they did any</p>
<p>wrongdoing on their part</p>
<p>so the family reached out</p>
<p>to California Attorney</p>
<p>general&rsquo;s office asking</p>
<p>them to review the sheriff&rsquo;s department&rsquo;s handling</p>
<p>of the case</p>
<p>in 2016 they</p>
<p>state that they were</p>
<p>going to begin</p>
<p>criminal investigation</p>
<p>in connection with the case and after</p>
<p>a year long investigation</p>
<p>they concluded insufficient</p>
<p>evidence to support</p>
<p>a criminal prosecution</p>
<p>for destruction alteration</p>
<p>or concealment</p>
<p>of evidence</p>
<p>so the family was trying to sue</p>
<p>the sheriff&rsquo;s department for</p>
<p>not doing the</p>
<p>right thing</p>
<p>okay I mean they originally</p>
<p>were trying to</p>
<p>hide the fact</p>
<p>that they had security footage they let Matrice out</p>
<p>even though</p>
<p>multiple people say that Matrice was acting</p>
<p>weird or seemed</p>
<p>mentally ill</p>
<p>they let her go without her phone</p>
<p>wallet anything</p>
<p>so yes I think they</p>
<p>should be in</p>
<p>trouble for that come on this</p>
<p>could have all been prevented</p>
<p>so it was later</p>
<p>explained that</p>
<p>sadly even if they had</p>
<p>discovered evidence</p>
<p>to prosecute</p>
<p>the people involved at</p>
<p>the sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>station there</p>
<p>would be little that they</p>
<p>could do because</p>
<p>the statue of</p>
<p>limitation it ran out in 2014</p>
<p>think the family just honestly wanted closure</p>
<p>and for people to be held accountable</p>
<p>which they deserve</p>
<p>so there are many people who believe</p>
<p>that there are answers as to what happened to Matrice</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re out there but someone has to know the truth</p>
<p>and hopefully someone will</p>
<p>speak up and come</p>
<p>forward and say what happened for now there are just</p>
<p>theories as to what happened that are</p>
<p>floating around there&rsquo;s a lot of theories there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>theories that say the police department was trying to</p>
<p>cover up some kind of</p>
<p>bigger involvement with something</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite find like an</p>
<p>answer as to</p>
<p>what they were hiding</p>
<p>but that was</p>
<p>one theory another theory is just that Matrice</p>
<p>was suffering from a mental illness</p>
<p>she went down into that Canyon and she died</p>
<p>and then another theory is that</p>
<p>the LA Sheriff Department played a role</p>
<p>in matrice&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>some people believe that letting her go was purely</p>
<p>negligent while</p>
<p>others believe</p>
<p>the investigation itself may have been a mass</p>
<p>cover up to conceal criminal acts by the deputies</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>final theory suggests that matrice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death was a homicide and that Matrice</p>
<p>may have come across someone who offered her a ride</p>
<p>and then she was</p>
<p>later murdered</p>
<p>or when she approached the dark Canyon area someone</p>
<p>maybe like saw her</p>
<p>or found her</p>
<p>or they were down there too and then they</p>
<p>killed her if Matrice had simply been</p>
<p>held in jail</p>
<p>or held in the office or</p>
<p>given a ride home</p>
<p>his story would be</p>
<p>completely different the family hopes that</p>
<p>they will somehow</p>
<p>find a way to obtain the answers and get justice for</p>
<p>their daughter</p>
<p>and yeah that&rsquo;s the story</p>
<p>about matrice</p>
<p>about how shitty that police department is</p>
<p>and how they hold</p>
<p>no responsibility for what they did</p>
<p>if you know anything</p>
<p>about what had happened to Matrice</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave in the description box</p>
<p>below maybe</p>
<p>where you can</p>
<p>reach out and speak up I</p>
<p>should probably do that with all of the stories I talk</p>
<p>about which I will okay</p>
<p>good call anyways</p>
<p>um so this story is odd like what happened to Matrice</p>
<p>nobody knows</p>
<p>the location</p>
<p>where she was</p>
<p>found it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>hard to get to that area I feel like there&rsquo;s no way she</p>
<p>would have just wandered over there</p>
<p>and if she did wander over there why</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t the animals and</p>
<p>like how was her body</p>
<p>still in such</p>
<p>like quote unquote like good condition</p>
<p>when it has been out there for almost a year</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know like</p>
<p>where the neighbors looked at more heavily</p>
<p>it seems like the</p>
<p>police department didn&rsquo;t even want to deal with it so</p>
<p>anyways I would love to hear your theories on what you</p>
<p>think may have happened</p>
<p>thank you guys so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today I hope</p>
<p>that you have a really good day you make good choices</p>
<p>please be safe out there and</p>
<p>I never know how to end</p>
<p>these because it&rsquo;s always like a really sad</p>
<p>story and then I&rsquo;m like bye but</p>
<p>other than that I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys very soon bye</p>
