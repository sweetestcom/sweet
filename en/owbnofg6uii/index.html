insulin resistance and gluconeogenesis now first of all let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what gluconeogenesis is glucose means glucose it&amp;rsquo;s sugar neo means new and genesis means the creation of so gluconeogenesis is the new creation of glucose made by your liver and it&amp;rsquo;s stimulated by a hormone called glucagon and it&amp;rsquo;s inhibited or turned off by your favorite hormone called insulin which is triggered by more glucose from the diet but what happens with gluconeogenesis is the body is making new sugar out of non-carbohydrate sources so it&amp;rsquo;s making sugar out of protein out of fat out of ketones why because there&amp;rsquo;s always a certain amount of sugar that your body does need and it&amp;rsquo;s not required to come from the diet your body can make it from other sources but what happens when you have insulin resistance things kind of become a little crazy because insulin resistance is a kind of a precursor for pre-diabetes and when you have pre-diabetes you have insulin resistance but also you&amp;rsquo;re going to have insulin resistance when you become a diabetic so when someone starts to cut out their carbohydrates because they&amp;rsquo;re a pre-diabetic or a diabetic or they&amp;rsquo;re on the ketogenic diet because they finally realized that diabetes or pre-diabetes is high sugar and having a high carb diet contributes to that and it makes it worse they finally had that realization so now what they&amp;rsquo;re going to do is cut the carbs out but when they check their sugars sometimes their sugar is too high now how can that be they&amp;rsquo;re not eating any sugar well if you&amp;rsquo;re not eating any sugar and you have high sugar that means it must be coming from gluconeogenesis now the question is why would the body be making more sugar well because the sensor the turn off signal the off switch is apparently not there in sufficient quantities so obviously you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough insulin because the insulin resistance is so strong you have so much resistance that insulin is not able to get through and so your body is sensing a low insulin situation so then it&amp;rsquo;s just going to make more sugar so if the blood sugars are that high then that&amp;rsquo;s the reason why oh i made a run just give it more time keep doing keto keep doing fasting and eventually the insulin resistance will improve to the point where your liver won&amp;rsquo;t keep making sugar anymore so we really have two situations we have insulin resistance over here and then we have the pancreas making insulin over here the beta cell and the pancreas makes insulin and so the pancreas cell will make more insulin if you&amp;rsquo;re eating more sugar why because it&amp;rsquo;s trying to compensate for that and as you&amp;rsquo;re making more insulin the insulin resistance will become more resistive simply because you have too much insulin because your carbs are too high so there&amp;rsquo;s really two situations going on so here&amp;rsquo;s what happens okay so you have this insulin resistance and then eventually you become a pre-diabetic now that&amp;rsquo;s where the blood sugars are starting to creep up to a certain amount not astronomical but just a certain amount so obviously there&amp;rsquo;s not enough insulin to push it down because of the insulin resistance so this goes on for a period of time as a pre-diabetic and then eventually you become a diabetic where the blood sugars start going really out of control and that is a major deficiency of insulin both because we have the insulin resistance and because the pancreas cell now can no longer compensate and make this excessive amount of insulin to keep your blood sugars in check so we have a situation where we have insulin resistance and a complete exhausted pancreas and if the person keeps doing more and more carbs then the doctors will eventually give you insulin on top of that so i mean the whole thing could be prevented and treated just by getting off these down carbs but that never happens we use these medications to manipulate these values unfortunately the whole point of this video is to tell you that we also have another situation involved in diabetes and that is this gluconeogenesis this liver making sugar okay so this goes beyond the carbs in the diet so when you&amp;rsquo;re diabetic a major contributing factor to your blood sugars is gluconeogenesis the liver is making new sugar so the solution or the answer to this is number one get unhealthy keto cut the carbs down make sure you provide all the nutrients and the phytonutrients to counter all the complications that occur and then give it time because it&amp;rsquo;s going to take time to reverse this it may take months to even a couple years so don&amp;rsquo;t give up if you run into a barrier find the solution and stick with it so if you&amp;rsquo;re enjoying my content which i hope you

gluconeogenesis now first of all let&rsquo;s talk about  </p><p>what gluconeogenesis is glucose means glucose 
it&rsquo;s sugar neo means new and genesis means the  </p><p>creation of so gluconeogenesis is the new creation 
of glucose made by your liver and it&rsquo;s stimulated  </p><p>by a hormone called glucagon and it&rsquo;s inhibited or 
turned off by your favorite hormone called insulin  </p><p>which is triggered by more glucose from the diet 
but what happens with gluconeogenesis is the body  </p><p>is making new sugar out of non-carbohydrate 
sources so it&rsquo;s making sugar out of protein  </p><p>out of fat out of ketones why because there&rsquo;s 
always a certain amount of sugar that your body  </p><p>does need and it&rsquo;s not required to come from the 
diet your body can make it from other sources  </p><p>but what happens when you have insulin resistance 
things kind of become a little crazy because  </p><p>insulin resistance is a kind of a precursor for 
pre-diabetes and when you have pre-diabetes you  </p><p>have insulin resistance but also you&rsquo;re going to 
have insulin resistance when you become a diabetic  </p><p>so when someone starts to cut out their 
carbohydrates because they&rsquo;re a pre-diabetic  </p><p>or a diabetic or they&rsquo;re on the ketogenic diet 
because they finally realized that diabetes or  </p><p>pre-diabetes is high sugar and having a high carb 
diet contributes to that and it makes it worse  </p><p>they finally had that realization so now what 
they&rsquo;re going to do is cut the carbs out but  </p><p>when they check their sugars sometimes their sugar 
is too high now how can that be they&rsquo;re not eating  </p><p>any sugar well if you&rsquo;re not eating any sugar and 
you have high sugar that means it must be coming  </p><p>from gluconeogenesis now the question is why 
would the body be making more sugar well because  </p><p>the sensor the turn off signal the off switch is 
apparently not there in sufficient quantities so  </p><p>obviously you don&rsquo;t have enough insulin because 
the insulin resistance is so strong you have so  </p><p>much resistance that insulin is not able to 
get through and so your body is sensing a low  </p><p>insulin situation so then it&rsquo;s just going to make 
more sugar so if the blood sugars are that high  </p><p>then that&rsquo;s the reason why oh i made a run just 
give it more time keep doing keto keep doing  </p><p>fasting and eventually the insulin resistance 
will improve to the point where your liver won&rsquo;t  </p><p>keep making sugar anymore so we really have two 
situations we have insulin resistance over here  </p><p>and then we have the pancreas making insulin over 
here the beta cell and the pancreas makes insulin  </p><p>and so the pancreas cell will make more insulin 
if you&rsquo;re eating more sugar why because it&rsquo;s  </p><p>trying to compensate for that and as you&rsquo;re making 
more insulin the insulin resistance will become  </p><p>more resistive simply because you have too much 
insulin because your carbs are too high so there&rsquo;s  </p><p>really two situations going on so here&rsquo;s what 
happens okay so you have this insulin resistance  </p><p>and then eventually you become a pre-diabetic 
now that&rsquo;s where the blood sugars are starting  </p><p>to creep up to a certain amount not 
astronomical but just a certain amount  </p><p>so obviously there&rsquo;s not enough insulin to push 
it down because of the insulin resistance so this  </p><p>goes on for a period of time as a pre-diabetic 
and then eventually you become a diabetic  </p><p>where the blood sugars start going really 
out of control and that is a major deficiency  </p><p>of insulin both because we have the insulin 
resistance and because the pancreas cell now  </p><p>can no longer compensate and make this excessive 
amount of insulin to keep your blood sugars in  </p><p>check so we have a situation where we have insulin 
resistance and a complete exhausted pancreas  </p><p>and if the person keeps doing more and more 
carbs then the doctors will eventually give  </p><p>you insulin on top of that so i mean the 
whole thing could be prevented and treated  </p><p>just by getting off these down carbs but 
that never happens we use these medications  </p><p>to manipulate these values unfortunately the 
whole point of this video is to tell you that  </p><p>we also have another situation involved in 
diabetes and that is this gluconeogenesis  </p><p>this liver making sugar okay so this goes beyond 
the carbs in the diet so when you&rsquo;re diabetic  </p><p>a major contributing factor to your blood 
sugars is gluconeogenesis the liver is making  </p><p>new sugar so the solution or the answer to this is 
number one get unhealthy keto cut the carbs down  </p><p>make sure you provide all the nutrients and the 
phytonutrients to counter all the complications  </p><p>that occur and then give it time because 
it&rsquo;s going to take time to reverse this  </p><p>it may take months to even a couple years so 
don&rsquo;t give up if you run into a barrier find  </p><p>the solution and stick with it so if you&rsquo;re
