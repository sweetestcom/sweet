Transcript ﻿hey guys in this video we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about the missing nutrients okay what are the missing nutrients trace minerals what are tracing those trace minerals are those minerals needed in much smaller amounts usually below 100 milligrams okay so that would be like chromium zinc copper selenium iodine cobalt versus other minerals you need in large amounts like potassium calcium magnesium you need those in much larger amounts so what do trace minerals do they basically help you make proteins work in your body okay so in order to make hair now skin hormones tendons ligaments discs bone and muscle you need trace minerals and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of deficiencies that can occur with like even chromium you can start having a blood sugar issue chromium house blood sugars zinc is very very important in your immune system and also putting viruses back in remission and even skin issues preventing skin issues copper very important in adrenal health hormone health cortisol stress hormone selenium is really good for the liver in the detoxification process iodine I think you might need that for the thyroid cobalt for the blood as in building b12 okay and so the type of minerals that I recommend our plant base trace minerals okay why because plant based trace minerals are 15,000 times smaller then other minerals like it&amp;rsquo;s called elemental or salt based minerals like you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to go into the dirt and take a spoonful of dirt and consume that that would be elemental normally what happens is the plant absorbs the mineral from the earth pulls it and converts it into a plant-based mineral where you can consume it but if you actually buy minerals at the store like calcium carbonate and some of these other minerals that they&amp;rsquo;re selling they&amp;rsquo;re not plant based their elemental so that&amp;rsquo;s why you probably a hard time absorbing them this is 100% absorbed this is probably if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky for a 5% absorbed so it has to do if you ever taken a chemistry class it has to do it the way the minerals are bound up there&amp;rsquo;s certain bonds that connect them plant-based minerals have covalent bonds easy to break elemental have ionic bonds really hard to break up so they&amp;rsquo;re not well absorbed you also need a very acidic stomach to absorb minerals in general so if you have a heartburn chances are you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough acid to pull it in and as you age you lose your stomach acid so a little bit about cider vinegar with water each day will help you absorb minerals in general but anyway trace minerals provide the cofactors for enzymes that actually again help build up the body tissue and problem with especially in America in other countries to the soils are so processed and they&amp;rsquo;re not replenished with trace minerals that you&amp;rsquo;re actually missing on trace minerals in our soils so if a plant is grown on soil it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the trace mineral it&amp;rsquo;s not going to get the trace mineral it has to come from somewhere so you&amp;rsquo;re consuming food which is nutrient deficient okay now if you consume food like on a volcanic soils where they used to have volcanoes like Hawaii the Caribbean islands Africa South America different countries and even places in America Philadelphia and Sylvania were even in Wisconsin where they had the kettle rain all the glaciers that came through and deposited all these minerals you have a lot of farmland it&amp;rsquo;s a very very nutrient rich okay but in other areas where you&amp;rsquo;re getting food you&amp;rsquo;re getting depletion of these minerals so one of the things that you may want to do is get a supplement others the one that I use is that this right here is called trace minerals at the plant base this is basically 79 million years old and Jurassic period which is about hundred forty five million years at the end of that there was a lot of prehistoric vegetation that was preserved in the earth so this is basically prehistoric plant life liquefied you would take a dropper full a day in some water it doesn&amp;rsquo;t taste like anything and just to start getting your minerals and it&amp;rsquo;s a 100 percent absorbed and it has over 70 trace minerals okay okay so thanks for watching and put your

about the missing nutrients okay what are  </p><p>the missing nutrients trace minerals what are 
tracing those trace minerals are those minerals  </p><p>needed in much smaller amounts usually below 100 
milligrams okay so that would be like chromium  </p><p>zinc copper selenium iodine cobalt versus 
other minerals you need in large amounts  </p><p>like potassium calcium magnesium you need those 
in much larger amounts so what do trace minerals  </p><p>do they basically help you make proteins work 
in your body okay so in order to make hair now  </p><p>skin hormones tendons ligaments discs bone and 
muscle you need trace minerals and there&rsquo;s a  </p><p>lot of deficiencies that can occur with like even 
chromium you can start having a blood sugar issue  </p><p>chromium house blood sugars zinc is very very 
important in your immune system and also putting  </p><p>viruses back in remission and even skin issues 
preventing skin issues copper very important in  </p><p>adrenal health hormone health cortisol stress 
hormone selenium is really good for the liver  </p><p>in the detoxification process iodine I think 
you might need that for the thyroid cobalt for  </p><p>the blood as in building b12 okay and so the type 
of minerals that I recommend our plant base trace  </p><p>minerals okay why because plant based trace 
minerals are 15,000 times smaller then other  </p><p>minerals like it&rsquo;s called elemental or salt based 
minerals like you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily want to go  </p><p>into the dirt and take a spoonful of dirt and 
consume that that would be elemental normally  </p><p>what happens is the plant absorbs the mineral 
from the earth pulls it and converts it into a  </p><p>plant-based mineral where you can consume it but 
if you actually buy minerals at the store like  </p><p>calcium carbonate and some of these other minerals 
that they&rsquo;re selling they&rsquo;re not plant based their  </p><p>elemental so that&rsquo;s why you probably a hard 
time absorbing them this is 100% absorbed this  </p><p>is probably if you&rsquo;re lucky for a 5% absorbed 
so it has to do if you ever taken a chemistry  </p><p>class it has to do it the way the minerals are 
bound up there&rsquo;s certain bonds that connect  </p><p>them plant-based minerals have covalent bonds 
easy to break elemental have ionic bonds really  </p><p>hard to break up so they&rsquo;re not well absorbed 
you also need a very acidic stomach to absorb  </p><p>minerals in general so if you have a heartburn 
chances are you don&rsquo;t have enough acid to pull  </p><p>it in and as you age you lose your stomach acid 
so a little bit about cider vinegar with water  </p><p>each day will help you absorb minerals in general 
but anyway trace minerals provide the cofactors  </p><p>for enzymes that actually again help build up 
the body tissue and problem with especially in  </p><p>America in other countries to the soils are so 
processed and they&rsquo;re not replenished with trace  </p><p>minerals that you&rsquo;re actually missing on trace 
minerals in our soils so if a plant is grown on  </p><p>soil it doesn&rsquo;t have the trace mineral it&rsquo;s not 
going to get the trace mineral it has to come  </p><p>from somewhere so you&rsquo;re consuming food which 
is nutrient deficient okay now if you consume  </p><p>food like on a volcanic soils where they used to 
have volcanoes like Hawaii the Caribbean islands  </p><p>Africa South America different countries and even 
places in America Philadelphia and Sylvania were  </p><p>even in Wisconsin where they had the kettle 
rain all the glaciers that came through and  </p><p>deposited all these minerals you have a lot of 
farmland it&rsquo;s a very very nutrient rich okay  </p><p>but in other areas where you&rsquo;re getting food 
you&rsquo;re getting depletion of these minerals so  </p><p>one of the things that you may want to do is get a 
supplement others the one that I use is that this  </p><p>right here is called trace minerals at the plant 
base this is basically 79 million years old and  </p><p>Jurassic period which is about hundred forty five 
million years at the end of that there was a lot  </p><p>of prehistoric vegetation that was preserved in 
the earth so this is basically prehistoric plant  </p><p>life liquefied you would take a dropper full a 
day in some water it doesn&rsquo;t taste like anything  </p><p>and just to start getting your minerals and it&rsquo;s 
a 100 percent absorbed and it has over 70 trace  </p><p>minerals okay okay so thanks for watching and
