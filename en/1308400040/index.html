    <p>Alright, let&rsquo;s do this shit cuz I&rsquo;m anxious. I&rsquo;m giving anxiety and if I don&rsquo;t just start talking</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna freak myself the fuck out. But hi, you can see me. Hi friends</p>
<p>This is our first video podcast. And of course, it&rsquo;s gonna be about fucking this is gonna be hookup culture</p>
<p>Everything you need to know about it</p>
<p>I got some shit to break down and I have some things to tell you</p>
<p>About one how to protect your relationship with yourself and two how to mentally prepare yourself if you&rsquo;re gonna be fucking around</p>
<p>Cuz it&rsquo;s all fun and games till you get your feelings hurt. Trust me. I know I went through it recently and I&rsquo;m fucking upset</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s just jump into this. So I hate to say it but it does not matter how</p>
<p>Prepared you are</p>
<p>Casual sex and hooking up will fuck with you at some point. So first, let&rsquo;s talk about the physical needs of a human being</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all biologically made to fuck. Maybe I should say procreate instead of fuck like that&rsquo;s abrasive</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re all like made and wired to have sex engage in intercourse</p>
<p>But one thing I have to make very clear is there are people who are run by their sexual desires and people who are not</p>
<p>But I am just gonna tell you this straight up</p>
<p>Just because you feel the urge to have sex does not mean you have to have sex</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna die if you don&rsquo;t have sex promise</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s like a hard pill to swallow bitch</p>
<p>But like you&rsquo;re in control and it&rsquo;s your choice to act on your urges or not</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t deny the fact that we do have</p>
<p>the biological urge to have sex and hook up with people and we want to like touch people and be close and feel affectionate like</p>
<p>We all have that we all that&rsquo;s normal for all of us, but I have to make it very clear</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna fucking die if you don&rsquo;t have sex</p>
<p>So just remember that you have the urge but it&rsquo;s your choice to act on it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like drinking water. Like if you don&rsquo;t drink water, you&rsquo;re fucked bitch. You&rsquo;re gonna die. You&rsquo;re gonna do that</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s jump into hooking up and why it feels good and then we&rsquo;re gonna get into why it feels bad</p>
<p>So hooking up and having sex it feels so fucking good physically because you got all the endorphins running through you like duh</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s expected like you&rsquo;re touching another human being skin-to-skin contact releases that shit</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d be having sex too and you touched a little bits and parts of you that makes it feel good</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna have an endorphin release</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna feel really good</p>
<p>But a lot of people fail to realize a reason that sex feels so good is because of the emotional stimulation you get to you</p>
<p>Feel validated you feel wanted you feel attractive like you feel desired</p>
<p>Someone wants you someone wants to bring you close to them and you feel valued you feel like worthy like it&rsquo;s a good validation</p>
<p>Of like feeling good about yourself and then you add on top the physical feelings you get like bitch</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>But it explains why</p>
<p>So many people are slutty and like the typical thing with people who are like slutty as fuck</p>
<p>A lot of people get a bad rap and like people like to talk shit on people for getting around</p>
<p>But they fail to take into consideration</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on emotionally because people that are slutty don&rsquo;t just fuck just to fuck the physical</p>
<p>Sensations of it are not enough to run you and not enough to sway you and make you binge your boundaries and fuck people that</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want to fuck. It&rsquo;s the emotional side that will do that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the emotional side that will get you out of fucking character and fuck you up</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want y&rsquo;all looking at whores and like slutty people like they&rsquo;re just oh, they&rsquo;re just so run</p>
<p>But they just want to go fuck. It&rsquo;s more than that</p>
<p>Everything in my podcast you&rsquo;ll understand everything is more than it seems</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one that I want to clear up. You also have to take into consideration with people that are very sexual</p>
<p>sex and being</p>
<p>objectified and sexualized</p>
<p>Might have been someone&rsquo;s only reflection of value for a long time</p>
<p>So they might only feel useful and feel valuable and feel good about their self when they&rsquo;re being pursued or having sex with someone</p>
<p>So you have to remove your judgment so fucking hard because a lot of people that are sexualized from a young age</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re reflected and a lot of the gay community</p>
<p>Everybody it&rsquo;s just like what can you provide for me sexually?</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s looked at as a sexual object and all people all human beings like we want to feel valued</p>
<p>We want to feel good. And if that&rsquo;s how it was reflected to somebody that&rsquo;s how they were taught to see it</p>
<p>They see their value and their ability to have sex and to be sexual</p>
<p>So like I said</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more emotional than people realize and also people that have experienced this and had their value only or mainly</p>
<p>Reflected through sex and sexual acts that is their reassurance</p>
<p>So anytime they doubt their self anytime they feel low self-esteem. They feel ugly. They feel like not valuable</p>
<p>They feel like undesirable</p>
<p>Their way of having it validated is through sex</p>
<p>So when they need reassurance when they need comfort when they need to feel validated</p>
<p>They resort back to how they know that they get it and it&rsquo;s all gonna be subconscious</p>
<p>So anytime someone gets insecure or down or whatever it is</p>
<p>If this is what they kind of grew up with</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna resort to sex because that&rsquo;s gonna alleviate the insecurity they feel</p>
<p>So getting to have sex with someone or feeling pursued or feeling wanted by someone is their validation that they have worth and they are</p>
<p>Valuable so don&rsquo;t judge fucking whores. All right, don&rsquo;t judge. No slut</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really sad when you think about it, but we are gonna get way more in-depth with that</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m not encouraging you to go out and be a whore. I&rsquo;m just letting the whores know. I understand you, babe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there. Everyone has a little hoe face</p>
<p>Everybody gets trapped in this cycle until you break it</p>
<p>But I want you to know that it&rsquo;s understandable why you do what you do</p>
<p>You might not understand why you feel like you can&rsquo;t control your sexual urges</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot more at play than you realize and we&rsquo;re gonna get into more details</p>
<p>Okay, so we talked about how all human beings have like the physical needs we need met great</p>
<p>But we also have the emotional side of it. Every single human being is wired for connection</p>
<p>We are all wired to need each other and to want each other like you can&rsquo;t avoid that</p>
<p>Like you want to feel valued you need other people to reflect it to you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say you need it</p>
<p>but motherfucker like I tried to reflect myself my body for my whole life and it like</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t as nice as when other people fucking do it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when my therapist used to tell me Leo</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need compliments from other people and I&rsquo;m like, I know bitch, but I want them. They&rsquo;re nice. They feel good</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t not want it</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just nice to have your value reflected by others and to feel cared about by others</p>
<p>But a lot of this fill-your-own-cup bullshit fails to take into consideration</p>
<p>We all have physical needs as human beings and we need each other like you can&rsquo;t avoid that</p>
<p>But with all this being said we all as human beings have the desire to feel close to other people</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our main fucking thing. Every single one of us feels it you can&rsquo;t avoid it</p>
<p>so everybody wants closeness, but a lot of people are unsure of how to get it and how to feel it and</p>
<p>When you want closeness with someone you want to feel connected you want to feel valued and you don&rsquo;t get that or you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>That that is painful</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally painful as fuck to not feel valued to not feel wanted and</p>
<p>To feel isolated like you want to be around people you want to be connected to people</p>
<p>Being connected to people is a reflection of value because people want you in their life when they value you when they care about you</p>
<p>So if you have no one in your life, there&rsquo;s no constant reflection of that to you. So everybody wants closeness</p>
<p>But if you look at society</p>
<p>Everybody is running around</p>
<p>Scared shitless of other people like everybody&rsquo;s so scared to get hurt</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s got this need for closeness, but everybody keeps people at arm&rsquo;s length. Like I don&rsquo;t want you to get to know me</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to let you in on my internal world</p>
<p>Which is required for true connection to feel connected to people like you have to open yourself up and truly connect</p>
<p>But everybody&rsquo;s so scared to get deep</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s so scared to reveal who they truly are what they truly feel what they truly want</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s running around with this desire of like I want to feel close to people</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re pushing everybody away because they&rsquo;re scared to be hurt</p>
<p>So if you look at sex or casual hookups or just hooking up with people you get that</p>
<p>Fix like you get to feel connected to someone without the risk of emotionally being hurt</p>
<p>Like you physically get to feel close to someone for a minute. You feel like someone&rsquo;s there you get to feel valued</p>
<p>You get to feel cared about all the good things about you are reflected the fact that you&rsquo;re useful. You&rsquo;re valuable</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re desired you&rsquo;re wanted you&rsquo;re attractive like all of that is reflected to you</p>
<p>So you get your fix of feeling good about yourself and then you get your fix of feeling connected to somebody</p>
<p>You get to hang out you get to hook up you get to feel close</p>
<p>you get to touch another human being you get the endorphins from skin-to-skin contact and like fucking and</p>
<p>Then you get to leave and there&rsquo;s no risk of you being hurt because you didn&rsquo;t open up emotionally</p>
<p>But you shortcutted that needs you have of feeling close to someone</p>
<p>It really makes so much sense when you understand that like why our society is the way it is and why hookup culture is so prevalent</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s a chicken shit and everybody like wants to avoid being hurt</p>
<p>But we all have that need for genuine like closeness and connection to people</p>
<p>We want to feel close to them, but nobody&rsquo;s willing to open up to do what it actually takes to feel that</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s just settling for the superficial a lot of people don&rsquo;t understand how to feel close to people</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t even know that you have to open up to the level that you do and also with opening up</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s scary as fuck to open up to somebody and let them in on your internal world</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like literally opening your chest up and allowing someone to like see in that&rsquo;s fucking terrifying</p>
<p>Like if someone can see the way you truly feel what you truly want what you desire what you don&rsquo;t like and like the pain</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in that&rsquo;s scary as fuck because you&rsquo;re opening yourself up</p>
<p>Basically for someone to do whatever they want to you</p>
<p>They can choose to care about you and love you or they can fuck your shit up and manipulate you. It&rsquo;s 50-50</p>
<p>So I understand why everybody&rsquo;s so scared. I&rsquo;m scared too</p>
<p>I feel the same things as you guys and that&rsquo;s one thing you have to realize</p>
<p>I know as much as I do, but I still have to navigate physical life feeling everything that you feel. I&rsquo;m not different from you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the same as every single one of you and that&rsquo;s why I get it to the extent that I do</p>
<p>like a lot of spiritual people and a lot of like</p>
<p>Leaders and teachers and people that like talk about shit that I do they act like they&rsquo;re completely void of the human experience</p>
<p>But I want to let you know</p>
<p>Everyone experiences it everybody feels it some people ignore it and some people don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m very in touch with it</p>
<p>And it hurts my feelings all the time</p>
<p>And while I&rsquo;m on the topic of spiritual shit and like people online</p>
<p>Let me just go ahead and acknowledge everybody is posting about you need to be careful with sex and it&rsquo;s an energetic exchange</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll take people&rsquo;s trauma on if you have sex with them. Shut the fuck up an</p>
<p>Energetic exchange with someone is the least that you motherfuckers worries. All right</p>
<p>You need to be worried about catching the fucking STD</p>
<p>You need to be worried about getting pregnant by somebody you want to go fucking pregnant by you don&rsquo;t need to be worrying about energetic</p>
<p>Exchange cool it bitch get a crystal and go shove it</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>Leave everybody alone trying to scare everybody with the energetic exchange shit</p>
<p>It is an energetic exchange when you do have sex with someone or you hook up with someone</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not this fucking drastic thing where you&rsquo;re just gonna like transfer their trauma onto you like you&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>so now that we&rsquo;ve acknowledged that sex is a</p>
<p>Shortcut to get to the feeling state that you want and to like alleviate that pain that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>This is where I mean hookups won&rsquo;t feel good for long</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re having the urge to hook up with somebody it will overwhelm you because it&rsquo;s not just like the physical need</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just gonna feel intensely horny and be like, oh my god. I want to go fuck but like I said, it&rsquo;s more than that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the emotional shit, too</p>
<p>So all you&rsquo;re gonna be doing is you&rsquo;re gonna be wrapped up in this feeling state of like, oh my god</p>
<p>Like you just feel like you want to have sex you want to hook up with somebody you want to like touch somebody like I love</p>
<p>Affection like I love it. Like just let me touch you. Let me just</p>
<p>You know what? I mean? Like I love a hug bitch. I&rsquo;ve been needing a hug</p>
<p>Okay, the shit I go through I need a fucking hug like all the time</p>
<p>But that urge you feel to hook up with someone it&rsquo;s gonna be very strong</p>
<p>Until you go through with it</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna have that really strong urge to hook up with someone you&rsquo;re gonna get that emotional need met</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get the physical need met and then all of a sudden that intense urge is gone</p>
<p>Your distraction is gone because that urge is distracting you from what you actually want</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the way that you know, you can get kind of like relief from what you&rsquo;re feeling, but</p>
<p>When that distraction is gone</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re left with the truth of what you truly want which is to feel connected and close to people like the more aware you get</p>
<p>The more empty you&rsquo;re gonna realize casual sex is like I&rsquo;m so upset and pissed off that I fucking realized all this because I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Just fuck no more like I&rsquo;m upset every time</p>
<p>But this is the cycle a lot of people get trapped in</p>
<p>Like they know a way to alleviate the way that they&rsquo;re feeling so they go hook up and have sex and then they end up feeling</p>
<p>The exact same void because it&rsquo;s not the actual closeness. They were after it&rsquo;s not the actual consistent validation that they want</p>
<p>So they keep resorting back to what is known</p>
<p>They keep having these urges and just going for it</p>
<p>Like they want to feel close to people and it will come out and it&rsquo;s like they just keep acting on it and they keep</p>
<p>Going in the cycle and a lot of people will get stuck</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like using drugs when you&rsquo;re trying to chase the high it&rsquo;s not gonna work</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re gonna keep doing more and more and more of it and then you&rsquo;re gonna either have to switch to a new drug or</p>
<p>Fucking sit down one day and be like what the fuck am I doing?</p>
<p>Like after you fucked 500 people and you still feel the same way you feel ten times worse</p>
<p>You have no self-esteem your fucking relationship with yourself is ash</p>
<p>You probably got a STD by now and now you&rsquo;re over here like now what the fuck I&rsquo;m finna do</p>
<p>Like you have to get to that point to break the cycle, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t understand. It&rsquo;s a cycle</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wanted to talk about this in this episode</p>
<p>but just understanding that</p>
<p>Sex is the painkiller to the emotional void</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling is your name like you just that&rsquo;s your step one</p>
<p>The awareness is gonna set you free from it because you&rsquo;re no longer gonna go into sex with the expectation of oh my god</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna cure me and then when it doesn&rsquo;t and you still feel the same way after the excitement is gone</p>
<p>The distraction is gone. You&rsquo;re not gonna think anything&rsquo;s gone wrong and it&rsquo;s not gonna send you into a panic of like</p>
<p>Oh my god, I have to keep trying I have to go</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re looking for the next thing when you just got to stop for a second</p>
<p>But this is gonna help you release the expectation around it</p>
<p>And one thing I do want to say is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to hook up with people like hooking up is fine</p>
<p>If you want to go have like meaningless sex and just casual sex, that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>Like tap into it do it</p>
<p>But I wanted to share some things in this episode to help protect you mentally if you&rsquo;re gonna do that</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s fine to do it</p>
<p>But just don&rsquo;t expect more than what you&rsquo;re gonna get out of it</p>
<p>Like if we&rsquo;re gonna go into it for the physical needs understand</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for like the emotional needs a little bit and then the physical needs too</p>
<p>But keep on your hunt for the genuine connection, but when you are hooking up with someone casually</p>
<p>Human beings naturally want progression</p>
<p>So when you first meet somebody if it&rsquo;s gonna be a hookup you get excited it&rsquo;s new it&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s oh my god</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new person. It&rsquo;s a new thing. It&rsquo;s a new place of validation</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new place to like get your a physical affection need like it&rsquo;s exciting. It&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>you hook up a couple of times and then it gets kind of like</p>
<p>Boring you&rsquo;re like what else like what next you know what I mean?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at least how I get but I get bored with people quick because I realize like the excitement swore off</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nothing new anymore and</p>
<p>like I said humans want progression like we don&rsquo;t like the same shit like we like for things to get deeper and progress and move</p>
<p>forward and</p>
<p>When the most you&rsquo;re gonna get out of a situation is just sexual acts. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>And like you get bored of it because if all you&rsquo;re doing when you&rsquo;re hanging out is fucking and like cuddling a little bit</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Like to cuddle after I like to fuck like I&rsquo;m in love cuddle for a minute and then leave peace out</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s just the way that I do it</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re only having sex with someone that&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;re kind of getting to know them</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not getting to know them as a person your closeness with them is not developing</p>
<p>Like all you have is that superficial sexual encounter that you guys have and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re gonna get bored by it</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get bored with it and one day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead and warn you because I do this every time</p>
<p>the moment when you&rsquo;re laying in bed next to somebody you&rsquo;ve hooked up with and you&rsquo;ve hooked up with them a couple of times and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting there looking at the ceiling and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fucking know this person. I</p>
<p>Used to have that shit happen all the time. I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know who you are</p>
<p>Like I know you sexually but like I don&rsquo;t know who you are as a person</p>
<p>For a shit like even the little conversations you have like before and after sex. It&rsquo;s like cute fun</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like superficial shit, but you&rsquo;re gonna hit a point where the sex is no longer exciting. There&rsquo;s no real way to like</p>
<p>Bring that excitement back because it&rsquo;s known now like you&rsquo;ve done it you&rsquo;ve had it and there&rsquo;s no development</p>
<p>With the friendship relationship, whatever it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just the sexual shit and you realize you don&rsquo;t even know this person</p>
<p>but your brains automatically gonna be looking for more and that&rsquo;s where you hit that realization because you&rsquo;re gonna want progress and there fucking is</p>
<p>None if all you&rsquo;re gonna do is hook up with somebody. That&rsquo;s another reason why people bounce around so much</p>
<p>Okay, I have one more point</p>
<p>I want to hit on about hooking up with somebody and why it feels good and then I&rsquo;m gonna get into</p>
<p>How casual sex can fuck you up and like you allowing people to have access to you?</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get into that in a second, but</p>
<p>With hooking up with someone and getting that feeling of closeness with them</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re hooking up if you&rsquo;re in pain emotionally and</p>
<p>You get to go be with another person</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much better to be in pain around someone else than alone</p>
<p>like when I go through a lot of shit emotionally, I&rsquo;ll feel the urge to like go hook up with someone and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve realized like it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m dealing with shit inside and I&rsquo;m in pain</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have to tell the person that I&rsquo;m dealing with shit, but just being with someone</p>
<p>Makes it feel better for some reason like to have their presence while you&rsquo;re upset or while you&rsquo;re hurting</p>
<p>Just their presence feels better. Like someone just being with you when you&rsquo;re in pain feels better</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another reason a lot of people will hook up without realizing it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s just to have someone&rsquo;s presence in someone&rsquo;s company while you&rsquo;re going through shit</p>
<p>It alleviates a lot like it just feels lighter and you just feel comforted</p>
<p>Like the person that you&rsquo;re hooking up with might not even know they might not even be comforting you</p>
<p>They might not even be saying shit about that</p>
<p>But just being with someone or like being able to touch someone it&rsquo;s very very comforting when you&rsquo;re in pain</p>
<p>So that is another need being met</p>
<p>you know because I began the loneliest when I&rsquo;m the saddest and then my dick all of a sudden wants to be like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lonely too like bitch. I know that you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>I played with you earlier what you&rsquo;re really fucking after is to not feel alone in your pain and I get it</p>
<p>Thank you for looking out for me</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s another thing that happens a lot of the time people aren&rsquo;t aware of</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s get into where casual sex is gonna fuck you up and ruin your self-esteem</p>
<p>Cuz me too bitch everything I talk about my podcast cuz I&rsquo;ve been through it bitch like you&rsquo;re not qualified to speak on something if you</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t fucking been through it or you don&rsquo;t have like direct experience with it. So that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d be knowing so many things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be going through so many things</p>
<p>but a big thing to get about hooking up with someone is</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just gonna use someone to meet your physical need of like, okay, I&rsquo;m just gonna hook up with you</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just gonna like have sex or whatever it is. You can&rsquo;t objectify somebody</p>
<p>Without doing the same to yourself</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t treat someone like they&rsquo;re disposable without that being reflected right back at you because that&rsquo;s the only thing they&rsquo;re reflecting to you is</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just good for that. So basically you can&rsquo;t devalue someone or</p>
<p>Select what value you see in someone and like only being like you&rsquo;re only valuable for this without sending that same message to yourself</p>
<p>And the next thing is allowing people access to you for the bare fucking minimum</p>
<p>Like if you meet up with someone and you hook up with someone just based off of what you like about them physically</p>
<p>That is the bare minimum of what someone could have to have access to you</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>disrespectful to yourself where it&rsquo;s like your list of</p>
<p>Requirements for what you have to meet to be able to get access to me and like fuck with me</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just this you just have to like be cute and</p>
<p>Know how to fuck</p>
<p>But to do that is not treating yourself like you&rsquo;re valuable</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re just allowing anyone that has a nice dick a nice vagina or a nice body</p>
<p>To have access to you like there&rsquo;s so much more to human beings</p>
<p>We are animals, but we&rsquo;re not just like animals that are like what I don&rsquo;t know the fucking terminology</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know science bitch. Like I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t even try and say it. Don&rsquo;t even you gonna sound stupid as shit</p>
<p>But our whole focus is not just procreation like other animals like it&rsquo;s not just like who has the best features to fuck and then</p>
<p>Keep going</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a more developed species than that</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t just let someone have access to you just because they know how to fuck or they have a nice dick or they</p>
<p>Have a nice body or they&rsquo;re cute. That&rsquo;s not enough like requirement</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not enough like value to be able to cross that threshold to have access to you like</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s basically telling yourself anyone can have access to you if they have this or that thing</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not like a good message to send yourself when you screen people and you evaluate who they are as a person</p>
<p>Before they get access to you. That&rsquo;s being protective of yourself</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you treat something you value is when you&rsquo;re gonna check before I let you have access to me. Are you worth it?</p>
<p>Are you safe? Is this a good idea like you have to act protective of yourself?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you show yourself that you have value like if you truly care about yourself and you value yourself</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you behave</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just gonna let anyone fuck you and with that like just fucking with someone based off of the physical attributes they have</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not requiring someone to see anything else valuable about you to get you like you&rsquo;re not making them</p>
<p>see other ways you&rsquo;re useful to them or</p>
<p>Worth a fuck like you&rsquo;re just allowing them in like you&rsquo;re not making them appreciate you or see anything else</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like here&rsquo;s access like valuable things are not easily accessed</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t treat yourself that way and I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t have sex and like banish it off like some fucking prude</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying you need to be more calculated with who you allow to come in and get near you like that</p>
<p>You know make people be of caliber to access you like not everybody can have a Birkin</p>
<p>Why do I always bring up a fucking burger?</p>
<p>It just flies out of my mouth</p>
<p>But like not everybody can have a fucking Birkin</p>
<p>Like you need to be the same way with your coochie cat or your dick like you need to just have that</p>
<p>Mentality of like not everybody can access it and what&rsquo;s gonna happen a lot of people think like if they put</p>
<p>Requirements on their self to have access to them people are not gonna want them</p>
<p>but the opposite happens when people perceive things as more valuable and</p>
<p>Harder to get they&rsquo;re gonna want it more. So don&rsquo;t be scared</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna not have anyone to come to you people are gonna be trying to come to you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just gonna be weeding them the fuck out like oh, you know, I mean I get your little wee whacker fucking get him out</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about to start raining. God damn it</p>
<p>Okay, one thing the lighting is like shifting but don&rsquo;t worry cuz next week&rsquo;s episode I bought big like lighting</p>
<p>But it just couldn&rsquo;t get delivered in time. So I&rsquo;m trying to use sunlight and God wants to fuck with me</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just gonna have to hang tight for this one deal with a little shadow on my face</p>
<p>But next week is gonna be perfect</p>
<p>so the next thing about</p>
<p>Requirements for people to access you a lot of the times if you&rsquo;re just hooking up with someone</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t require them to take your feelings into consideration</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d hope for it</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not a requirement to get access to you as my thing like you hope that they care about the way that you feel</p>
<p>You hope that they think of you and they&rsquo;re thoughtful and courteous and considerate of you</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is that should be a fucking requirement if someone&rsquo;s gonna fuck you</p>
<p>But allowing someone to discard you and the way that you feel and still allowing them access to you sends you a very negative message</p>
<p>Like to not make anyone care take any part of you. That&rsquo;s not fair to do to yourself</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have to take care of me</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to take into consideration anything about me besides sexually like that&rsquo;s not good to do for your relationship with yourself</p>
<p>okay, so the next thing I want to hit on about hookup culture is</p>
<p>How it&rsquo;s gonna make you feel like fucking shit about yourself and make you feel worse than ever</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>When you go to hook up with someone and your intentions are just to like have sex</p>
<p>What someone is focused on is their physical need so they&rsquo;re like, okay</p>
<p>I want my dick wet. I want my dick played with all they&rsquo;re evaluating you for is can you do it?</p>
<p>Are you pretty enough to play with it? Like that&rsquo;s all that they&rsquo;re seeing about you</p>
<p>They put their blinders on for the need that they have they&rsquo;re looking at the need of sex. Can you meet that need great?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking at any other value. You can contribute them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking at how you&rsquo;re a good person or how you have a good heart or how you could care about them or how</p>
<p>You could be a good boyfriend or girlfriend or the they them friend</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to call that but like they&rsquo;re not looking to reflect you or even see or notice anything else</p>
<p>valuable about you besides</p>
<p>What will meet their need so they&rsquo;re screening you they&rsquo;re assessing. Can you meet this need for me?</p>
<p>Okay, great</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;re gonna fuck you</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not gonna reflect you any other value besides sex and a lot of people go into hookups thinking</p>
<p>Oh my god, like I&rsquo;m such a good person. I&rsquo;m so great. Like I&rsquo;m better than them. Like I just settle my standards</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna want me and then they don&rsquo;t want you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking for how you could be a good girlfriend boyfriend, whatever</p>
<p>Like I said, they&rsquo;re not trying to evaluate anything else about you besides</p>
<p>Can you meet the physical need that I have which is to fuck?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>but that will make you second-guess yourself and if you go through that enough of like</p>
<p>Going and just hooking up with people and then no one tries to take things further or nobody like wants anything more</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna start a question yourself a second guess like am I like worthless like what the fuck is going on?</p>
<p>Why does nobody want me?</p>
<p>But nobody&rsquo;s looking at you when you approach them for the standpoint of just sex or you entertain that conversation</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking at anything about you other than your ability to have sex and your sex appeal</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking for your emotional intelligence. They&rsquo;re not looking for your smarts. They&rsquo;re not looking for your heart</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not gonna reflect you any of that. I hope you can&rsquo;t hear the thunder mother nature. Leave me alone</p>
<p>God and mother nature not fucking with me both at the same time. Oh, just let me talk to everybody about sex</p>
<p>My god and recently I was hooking up with someone that I met like real organically</p>
<p>It was weird like I don&rsquo;t play on none of the apps and shit, but I met someone organically</p>
<p>I was trying to manifest the friends of benefit</p>
<p>Like I was in my journal every night writing a little friends of benefit</p>
<p>I want to manifest that and I did and then we hooked up a few times and this is where I&rsquo;m saying all this shit</p>
<p>Like kind of came out like it was already in the back of my head</p>
<p>But this situation I just went through made all this very fucking obvious</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I made a full list and I was like, let&rsquo;s talk about it</p>
<p>but the main thing that like put me the fuck off was I</p>
<p>Got a text like late at night one night and he was like, what are you doing? I&rsquo;m horny and</p>
<p>It like pissed me off like I got physically like pissed but like under anger is hurt</p>
<p>So I was like, okay</p>
<p>What am I actually like upset about like what&rsquo;s actually bothering me with this and I was so sad</p>
<p>by that text because I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>You only text me to hook up and I&rsquo;m just like I have so much more to offer and</p>
<p>the least interesting thing about me is</p>
<p>The my ability to have sex like I&rsquo;m so much more deep than that. I&rsquo;m so I have so much more to offer</p>
<p>I have so much more value and you don&rsquo;t even care and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve like kind of like drifted off and like I&rsquo;m not really like engaging with it anymore</p>
<p>Just because it made me feel like shit</p>
<p>Like I said, once you hit a certain level of awareness like it&rsquo;s not gonna feel good to hook up anymore</p>
<p>Like receiving texts like that and only having my physical</p>
<p>Like attributes and like my ability to have sex which every human being has you&rsquo;re not special because you can fuck</p>
<p>You might be special for how you could fuck you can develop the skills, but the ability to fuck is in all of us. So</p>
<p>Just someone like reflecting that to me and like being interested for that. I was like so put off by it like</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see what else is in front of you</p>
<p>Alright, and I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m over it like I&rsquo;m done with it cuz like I&rsquo;m down for like I like the progression of things</p>
<p>Like I talked about before I want to see progression. I want to get to know you more</p>
<p>I want to get to know you better. I don&rsquo;t know dude</p>
<p>Like I got to know him and like he was cool</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t I like to get to know people like if I&rsquo;m gonna give someone access to me</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not gonna give it to a stranger like I have to assess if you&rsquo;re worth like bringing next to me and bringing close</p>
<p>To me like that cuz sex is bringing someone close to you like they&rsquo;re being intimate with you</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a certain level of closeness and I&rsquo;m like for you to get that. I need more</p>
<p>I need a lot more than just what I thought and this situation revealed that to me and I feel a lot better now that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;m done with hookups like the next person I&rsquo;m gonna have sex with me what run in my fucking mouth</p>
<p>Let me drink too much tequila and I&rsquo;m gonna be fucking</p>
<p>But I really don&rsquo;t like get around. I haven&rsquo;t like slept with a lot of people like recently like I just don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very protective of myself now because I see for the first time the value in me</p>
<p>And when people don&rsquo;t see that it makes me turned off when people can&rsquo;t properly appreciate me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m like you like I&rsquo;m ready to discard them because</p>
<p>People appreciate what they recognize because it&rsquo;s in them</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of letting me know you don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s in front of you because you don&rsquo;t possess it</p>
<p>Also, that might just be me losing my fucking mind and trying to feel better because I do be playing eagle games</p>
<p>But yeah, just getting that text did not make me feel good</p>
<p>So I was like I&rsquo;m not subjecting myself to that shit anymore</p>
<p>Like the person that&rsquo;s gonna get access to me sexually next is gonna be able to validate</p>
<p>See and appreciate all the shit about me. Not just my dick. Okay, my next point I want to bring up and it&rsquo;s about society</p>
<p>Society makes it seem like it&rsquo;s so cool to have hoes like you supposed to have hoes on a lot</p>
<p>But like everybody&rsquo;s like all about having hoes and all about like having a list full of people that want to fuck them and I</p>
<p>just want to say</p>
<p>Having hoes is not a flex</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s honestly kind of embarrassing because what you have is a list of people who want to fuck you</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a list of people who want to</p>
<p>Care about you and get to know you and connect with you and be close to you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d like to take you on a test, right?</p>
<p>Like sexually like I don&rsquo;t look at it as a flex to have hoes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly turned off when people entertain too many fucking people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like you like that&rsquo;s not cute to me because like you&rsquo;re entertaining people who are only able to reflect you one type of value</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good. I don&rsquo;t like that shit. I don&rsquo;t waste time on that shit</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t entertain people like my phone is literally so fucking dry. It stays on do not disturb all the fucking time</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit girl. I&rsquo;m busy working with me and until you can like fully appreciate me and like value me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested and that&rsquo;s that but I just wanted to talk shit real quick about everybody thinking</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool to have hoes like it&rsquo;s really not like it&rsquo;s actually kind of embarrassing</p>
<p>Did you have a lot of people that want to fuck you but not care about you?</p>
<p>It seems off to me</p>
<p>But like I said with this whole episode, I don&rsquo;t want you to think that I&rsquo;m like bashing hooking up</p>
<p>I just want you to be prepared and</p>
<p>Be aware of what&rsquo;s going on and like what you&rsquo;re feeling inside</p>
<p>This will be different for everybody</p>
<p>but like check in with the new awareness you now have if you&rsquo;re gonna hook up with people and you&rsquo;re still gonna do casual shit do</p>
<p>It get your fix. We all have physical needs. We have emotional needs like go get your fix</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay. Every once in a while take a little pain pill like take your pain pill go get your fix</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;re prepared mentally and I want you to set standards and requirements for yourself for what it takes to access you</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just go around fucking people like set requirements and screen who you allow to have access to you</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s gonna send you the message that you are valuable like just</p>
<p>hooking up with a bunch of people doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t value yourself and</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s no way to build your relationship with yourself and still hook up the way to build your relationship with yourself</p>
<p>And feel good about hooking up is by showing yourself. You&rsquo;re treating yourself as valuable</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re screening who comes up in front of you. You have requirements for who can access you like that</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way to build your self-esteem and build yourself up</p>
<p>But like I said about when you have that urge and you&rsquo;re like fiending for it do not drop your fucking standards now</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re aware of why your urge feels so strong. It&rsquo;s the emotional shit, too</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not gonna feel as strong because now you&rsquo;re gonna be able to observe it. So you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>I gave you that little tidbit, but don&rsquo;t drop your fucking standards</p>
<p>You meet my requirement or you don&rsquo;t get access</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s just how the fuck it&rsquo;s gonna go or you will fuck your relationship up with yourself and you will not feel valuable</p>
<p>Okay, like you&rsquo;re gonna feel like shit with hooking up</p>
<p>So this is the way to do like little hookups and take a little pain peel of like having sex with</p>
<p>Not feeling like total hell, you know</p>
<p>So just be smart with it and make your priority showing yourself that you&rsquo;re valuable</p>
<p>By the way, you treat yourself</p>
<p>If this podcast was helpful to you and you&rsquo;re watching on YouTube leave this video a thumbs up and leave a comment like leave me</p>
<p>Some comments. Leave me some feedback. I love hearing from you guys. Like that&rsquo;s the shit that keeps me going</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on YouTube now bitch</p>
<p>You can watch this if you want, but leave me a five-star rating Apple podcast Spotify. Just put the little five stars</p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>
<p>But I did set up a donations page for this podcast because I&rsquo;m most likely not gonna be monetized</p>
<p>So if you want to support the podcast if anything I&rsquo;ve said has helped you and you want to donate</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put the link in the description of this podcast</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll also be in the audio version to click the description and donations are gonna help keep this bitch commercial free because I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>To have to come in here with no advertisements. Okay, I</p>
<p>Hate that shit when I&rsquo;m listening to a podcast and they fucking just all of a sudden start talking about like teeth whitening or like</p>
<p>Birchbox, whatever the fuck is I like you just give the value straight to you because that&rsquo;s how I like to consume it</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re interested in working with me one-on-one, I do zoom calls</p>
<p>So if you want to book one and you want me to help you through anything you&rsquo;re dealing with I&rsquo;ve got you hit the link</p>
<p>In the description. I&rsquo;ll put the scheduling link</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also put all the links to my social media if you want to follow me</p>
<p>If you have any topics you want me to cover in future episodes</p>
<p>You can send me a DM on Instagram or you can comment on the YouTube video. I&rsquo;m gonna look at all of it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be nosy. I like to know what everybody says, but I hope this podcast help you</p>
<p>This is everything that I fucking know as of right now as I learn more shit. I&rsquo;ll share it, but</p>
<p>Everybody be safe. Take care of yourself, and I will talk to you next Sunday</p>
