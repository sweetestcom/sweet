<p>which as you said is on the coast it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on the east coast of Africa it used to</p>
<p>be a Portuguese colony so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>connection between Mozambique in</p>
<p>Portugal that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m importing right</p>
<p>now because I speak Portuguese and so</p>
<p>Mozambique isn&rsquo;t on this it&rsquo;s right on</p>
<p>the border with South Africa so it has a</p>
<p>lot of influences it had a food-wise</p>
<p>three major influence is obviously the</p>
<p>African influence all around Portuguese</p>
<p>the Portuguese warn Mozambique for 500</p>
<p>years and Indian because there&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>large Indian community of Pakistani I</p>
<p>guess that part of India but back in the</p>
<p>day it was it was when they came from</p>
<p>India was India and so that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>food is like it&rsquo;s a mix of Portuguese</p>
<p>which basically it&rsquo;s a kind of food that</p>
<p>has a lot of pork a lot of seafood a lot</p>
<p>of olive oil</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the Portuguese type of</p>
<p>Mediterranean type of cooking mixed with</p>
<p>very spicy food like Indian spicy food</p>
<p>and then African food at least in our</p>
<p>country and</p>
<p>a peanut based type of curry sauces</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting me hungry this designs</p>
<p>really good sounds amazing</p>
<p>so compared to American foods I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s healthier I would imagine well it</p>
<p>used to be I think which is part of my</p>
<p>journey my professional journey I I grew</p>
<p>up in Canada so I&rsquo;m from this lovely</p>
<p>tropical exotic country but I grew up in</p>
<p>Canada so I only went to I left</p>
<p>Mozambique when I was one so I only went</p>
<p>to eat in Mozambique when I was 25</p>
<p>turning 26 when I finished naturopathic</p>
<p>College as soon as I finish as soon as I</p>
<p>finished my board exams I was dying to</p>
<p>go back to my home country really</p>
<p>because I thought I was gonna do all</p>
<p>these great wonderful humanitarian</p>
<p>things which is a very North American</p>
<p>kid mentality to be totally honest and</p>
<p>then when I got there I realized that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t really gonna be the case and so I</p>
<p>started working against my will but that</p>
<p>was the only thing that was available to</p>
<p>me then I started working as a</p>
<p>nutritionist dietician and what did I</p>
<p>learn I learned that the people in my</p>
<p>city of course cities are very different</p>
<p>than the countryside but in my city were</p>
<p>very much exposed to the western-style</p>
<p>diet so right now the diet is very much</p>
<p>KFC coca-cola heats in that kind of diet</p>
<p>of course they still have their</p>
<p>traditional dishes and but the funny</p>
<p>thing is the only these traditional</p>
<p>healthier dishes on holidays it&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>more of a holiday type food during the</p>
<p>week people tend to eat a very Western</p>
<p>based type of diet in my opinion and so</p>
<p>the people that I was seeing in clinic</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I had to kind of learn</p>
<p>this cuz I didn&rsquo;t I wasn&rsquo;t taught this</p>
<p>in school was how to treat metabolic</p>
<p>syndrome I was seeing people that were</p>
<p>obese diabetic with cardiovascular</p>
<p>disease and eventually just by luck</p>
<p>stumbled across sort of fertility</p>
<p>struggles and got into that because of</p>
<p>my own personal journey but really the</p>
<p>diet is was wonderful</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a wonderful diet but it&rsquo;s been very</p>
<p>like every other country it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>influenced by globalization in the</p>
<p>Western culture yeah hey we I know that</p>
<p>very I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m from the Midwest and</p>
<p>this is what we were raised on I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a chance to even start in a nice</p>
<p>good healthy country but um the you had</p>
<p>infertility issues and then you why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you just stumble on some things</p>
<p>that just turn things around for you</p>
<p>well actually because like I said I</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t really I wasn&rsquo;t taught</p>
<p>in naturopathic College just like no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s different than medical doctors</p>
<p>right or the instruction education of a</p>
<p>naturopathic college is very much geared</p>
<p>towards natural therapies and</p>
<p>acupuncture and homeopathy and of course</p>
<p>we do all the medical sciences and we do</p>
<p>we do have nutrition probably more than</p>
<p>medical doctors but it&rsquo;s not just like</p>
<p>you probably got in school you know for</p>
<p>your 3 whole 3 hours and I got a little</p>
<p>bit more than 3 hours a lot more but it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t it still wasn&rsquo;t the way that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re hoping today that people are gonna</p>
<p>learn nutrition so it was very much like</p>
<p>you know this food has this vitamin and</p>
<p>that food has this and so when I went to</p>
<p>Mozambique and people wanted help to</p>
<p>lose weight I had to make it up I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any face to go on oh you know I I I</p>
<p>was given everybody at the beginning the</p>
<p>very same eat less move more more Whole</p>
<p>Grains sort of I really was until I</p>
<p>started to figure out ok this is not</p>
<p>gonna work and then I had some basis a</p>
<p>natural at the college we did talk about</p>
<p>gluten and so I started to remove some</p>
<p>grains and eventually I started to make</p>
<p>up my own plans based on just trial and</p>
<p>error point very early on in my journey</p>
<p>I would say within the first year or two</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a naja path for 15 years now</p>
<p>so right at the very beginning I had</p>
<p>this person get pregnant accidentally</p>
<p>quote-unquote and that was that&rsquo;s when I</p>
<p>started to realize that there was</p>
<p>something there way before I started</p>
<p>trying to get pregnant and their story</p>
<p>was very interesting because it was a</p>
<p>couple that had it was a South African</p>
<p>couple had been married for 13 years and</p>
<p>six or seven years into their marriage</p>
<p>after many IVF it&rsquo;s funny because South</p>
<p>Africa is a very big IBF medical</p>
<p>community they&rsquo;re not they have very I</p>
<p>have family members that have gone</p>
<p>through it very successful they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>good at it I&rsquo;m not sure why but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just an aside so the this couple had</p>
<p>tried IVF numerous times I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>successfully and they adopted a little</p>
<p>girl so by the time they came to see me</p>
<p>in Mozambique they were living in</p>
<p>Mozambique at the time your daughter was</p>
<p>already six or seven so anyway they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been married for about thirteen years</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s never got pregnant with IVF</p>
<p>and whatnot then she did my diet which</p>
<p>was an ethos it was a very low carb diet</p>
<p>I mean at that point I&rsquo;d already figured</p>
<p>out that in order to help people lose</p>
<p>weight I had to go low-carb I figure</p>
<p>that moves less move more eat less thing</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t worth thinking that I am going to</p>
<p>get away but I had to call it in detox</p>
<p>mm-hmm do is I would throw in this eat</p>
<p>dogs once a month and then the rest of</p>
<p>the month we were eating healthy cards</p>
<p>and then you know and I was doing this</p>
<p>carb cycling thing with them so that was</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know 12 13 years ago and then</p>
<p>three months later this woman and her</p>
<p>husband come to my office and the</p>
<p>husband is the one that&rsquo;s wanting to</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on how is my</p>
<p>wife pregnant it&rsquo;s been 13 years we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done IVF we&rsquo;ve done what happened here</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know nor was that the</p>
<p>intent she just wanted to lose weight so</p>
<p>that was my fruit and that that of</p>
<p>course stayed in my mind and then it</p>
<p>started to happen more and more often</p>
<p>and then it became a dope like don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>to that doctor unless you want to get</p>
<p>pregnant and then it just kind of</p>
<p>happened and and somewhere down the line</p>
<p>I had my own issue and I and I went back</p>
<p>I said you know I don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I gotta do to get</p>
<p>pregnant and it worked for me as well so</p>
<p>by the second time I try to get pregnant</p>
<p>I did have a doctor a friend of mine and</p>
<p>she said she made a connection for me</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s insulin resistance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is and I was like</p>
<p>Wow and so then for men of course you</p>
<p>know it was very clear and it coincided</p>
<p>with the time that I went back to Canada</p>
<p>I had my second child</p>
<p>I met dr. Fung and I started working</p>
<p>with them so fascinating so let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about PCOS we it&rsquo;s polycystic ovarian</p>
<p>syndrome and they always say that</p>
<p>insulin resistance is associated with it</p>
<p>but actually it causes it I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like thank you yeah yeah and then when</p>
<p>you when you say you you got her</p>
<p>introduced to Jason Fung and then use</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that at that point I would</p>
<p>imagine that you started to implement a</p>
<p>lot more innovative fasting or he was</p>
<p>already well very well known to me maybe</p>
<p>not as well-known as he is today but in</p>
<p>naps but I had already been</p>
<p>quote-unquote stalking him okay cool I</p>
<p>knew enough about him I had started</p>
<p>fasting I I did start keto way before</p>
<p>that but I started fasting we were very</p>
<p>interested in his work my husband had</p>
<p>already started looking at to fasting</p>
<p>and actually my husband&rsquo;s very first</p>
<p>fast was a super long fast it was a 12</p>
<p>day fast so we were very into it and</p>
<p>then I went to a conference and I knew</p>
<p>some people in South Africa and they</p>
<p>introduced me to him and so it was you</p>
<p>know but I had already contacted him</p>
<p>before I was in Toronto and I wanted to</p>
<p>work with him you know IMing was off and</p>
<p>and so it all worked out so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of women now that are getting some</p>
<p>ideas somewhere to the internet I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what article they&rsquo;re reading but</p>
<p>yeah well women shouldn&rsquo;t do fasting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to mess up their</p>
<p>hormones what&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s your take on</p>
<p>that well most people that I&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>with over time not because I wanted to</p>
<p>to be honest this fertility thing as I</p>
<p>said just kind of stumbled upon me</p>
<p>mostly I worked with people with</p>
<p>metabolic syndrome right but the reality</p>
<p>is that people most people that look for</p>
<p>this kind of help or the photo and</p>
<p>nutritionists are still women and</p>
<p>probably you know pre perimenopausal or</p>
<p>postmenopausal around eyes</p>
<p>probably been you know the highest</p>
<p>percentage of people that search for</p>
<p>people like me and since I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>working with Megan and Jason Megan and I</p>
<p>worked very closely together in clinic</p>
<p>when I first started with them I was in</p>
<p>clinic because I was a natural path I</p>
<p>could work in in clinic and couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work which was great that&rsquo;s how I got my</p>
<p>basis right</p>
<p>and same with them when the majority of</p>
<p>their of their patients are women so</p>
<p>Megan and I&rsquo;m gonna give me this source</p>
<p>here because way better than anything I</p>
<p>can tell you is just to go to the source</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got a series of blogs on women and</p>
<p>fasting because because of this and so</p>
<p>if you go to IDM program comm slash blog</p>
<p>and you search women and fasting there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a series of blogs that Megan has written</p>
<p>as a woman number one she&rsquo;s a young</p>
<p>woman she&rsquo;s in her mid thirties but</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a woman nonetheless and she has</p>
<p>treated thousands of women you know</p>
<p>adult women in all age groups and so</p>
<p>what she says and then I&rsquo;m gonna leave</p>
<p>this out there for you I know your</p>
<p>listeners and the people that follow you</p>
<p>or very informed people and so it would</p>
<p>be easy enough for them to understand</p>
<p>this but what she says is that every</p>
<p>time she reads something but women that</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be fasting and then she goes</p>
<p>in searches that person and their</p>
<p>repertoire and their experience</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t compare their experience</p>
<p>to her experience I mean she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>doing this for over eight years both</p>
<p>personally and professionally they have</p>
<p>thousands of women that they have</p>
<p>followed so it&rsquo;s really a myth why would</p>
<p>I leave it there I agree a hundred</p>
<p>percent in fact if you pull the string a</p>
<p>lot of times I said well I&rsquo;m doing I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing fasting and it&rsquo;s making my</p>
<p>hormones worse you find out it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the five and two I said oh so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically five days of the week you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pretty much eating than normal whatever</p>
<p>you want and then two days you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>a low calorie diet and you&rsquo;re sorry yeah</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re you personally you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna have a chance to adapt secondly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the way to build fertility I</p>
<p>remember you know when I was in practice</p>
<p>I was um putting people on fasting and I</p>
<p>noticed would improve fertility I</p>
<p>remember one lady she she actually</p>
<p>was scheduled to come in she didn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>in called her offices and her husband</p>
<p>answered says oh yeah I told my wife she</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t come back to you</p>
<p>I said why because she&rsquo;s getting worse</p>
<p>oh yeah after you know you&rsquo;re treating</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s getting worse she&rsquo;s feeling</p>
<p>sick like oh well sorry to hear that</p>
<p>two weeks later they show up my office</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sorry that was morning sickness</p>
<p>she got pregnant and I&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome</p>
<p>so yeah it does improve fertility</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re especially if you do it</p>
<p>healthily I mean you&rsquo;reyou&rsquo;re not just</p>
<p>starving you&rsquo;re having nutrient-dense</p>
<p>foods and but the main thing is the high</p>
<p>insulin what that does to a female&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hormones and a male hormone I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just messing everything up</p>
<p>so so that&rsquo;s like we need to talk about</p>
<p>androgens for example um I guess people</p>
<p>actually automatically think well they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t they can&rsquo;t seem to get their wits</p>
<p>around how insulin can trigger antigens</p>
<p>but it does since the resistance</p>
<p>increases antigen so yeah there&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>diagrams out there q if you look it up I</p>
<p>mean dr. Frank and I are doing some work</p>
<p>together on PCOS it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come out next year but and so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>significant research out there I mean</p>
<p>from my friend in Mozambique in in 20</p>
<p>whatever year it was 2012 to say to me</p>
<p>what do you mean it&rsquo;s insulin resistant</p>
<p>I think Barcelona I think that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>she did her her oh it she was like so</p>
<p>obvious like wrong and it really if you</p>
<p>look it up insulin we think of insulin</p>
<p>and we think Ivy&rsquo;s right we think</p>
<p>insulin and we think obviously metabolic</p>
<p>endocrine hormones but it has major</p>
<p>reflective functions and yes does affect</p>
<p>both female women and men and what you</p>
<p>want to do is balance out that insulin</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have too little but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have too much either and so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly we&rsquo;re trying to do and it is</p>
<p>true that in the process a lot of women</p>
<p>feel like their cycles make it longer or</p>
<p>make it shorter I mean they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still balancing out right there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a sort of balancing act</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on there and when insulin is is leveled</p>
<p>then your your reproductive hormones</p>
<p>work out better there&rsquo;s other things do</p>
<p>move it if insulin affects mood because</p>
<p>it affects the sympathetic nervous</p>
<p>system it has other functions except</p>
<p>that we all think of or many people</p>
<p>think of insulin as just being an</p>
<p>endocrine or metabolic hormone but it</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t no it&rsquo;s actually one of the most</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the most dominating</p>
<p>hormone because in the presence of too</p>
<p>much insulin you get a nullification of</p>
<p>thyroid all all the of the growth</p>
<p>hormone testosterone you have all these</p>
<p>hormones or just get nullified</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re dealing with fat</p>
<p>burning too so it&rsquo;s you know you can do</p>
<p>all these great things you could try to</p>
<p>stimulate your thyroid hormones your</p>
<p>growth hormone your anti-aging hormone</p>
<p>but if your insulin is too high those</p>
<p>things get nullified you cancelled out</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see the benefits so yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um I think just a matter of educating</p>
<p>people on the truth of this so and then</p>
<p>with fasting you instantly have this</p>
<p>additional benefit of repair action and</p>
<p>genes that get turned into start turned</p>
<p>on to start to repair all all different</p>
<p>parts of your body so that&rsquo;s like huge</p>
<p>so the combination and that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>always recommend you know if you were to</p>
<p>do the key to a little carb and then</p>
<p>just eat constantly all day long you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s not gonna help you so you want</p>
<p>to do both that&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s my opinion</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sticking to it</p>
<p>well your opinion though is is not just</p>
<p>an opinion of course it&rsquo;s based on a lot</p>
<p>of experience and seeing this firsthand</p>
<p>a lot of people are talking about eat or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about fasting but then</p>
<p>as Megan says if you go and look into</p>
<p>their experience they have no experience</p>
<p>right this subject matter they&rsquo;re giving</p>
<p>a lot of opinions no experience for</p>
<p>whatever reason whether because it just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to get into it or because</p>
<p>they read something a long time ago and</p>
<p>they were just turned off by it so now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just repeating what they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard but what experience do they have</p>
<p>have they actually as anyone has any</p>
<p>medical doctor or any health</p>
<p>professional that&rsquo;s people through the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet or intermittent fasting</p>
<p>how about</p>
<p>say Oh No you know I was wrong it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>caused them harm I haven&rsquo;t seen that yet</p>
<p>no one I have not seen that absolutely</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>yeah I mean like unless you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>practice and you work with real people</p>
<p>over and over and over over a period of</p>
<p>yours you&rsquo;re not gonna see this like</p>
<p>even with me I didn&rsquo;t accept insurance I</p>
<p>was all cash practice so it forces you</p>
<p>to you know people are gonna pay you</p>
<p>you better get results or they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>coming around so it forces you to take</p>
<p>it to the next level where you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>everything you can to research and</p>
<p>figure things out because unfortunately</p>
<p>in school like you said I think I got</p>
<p>four and a half hours of nutrition less</p>
<p>sorry it wasn&rsquo;t it was so it was just</p>
<p>all the wrong information I think there</p>
<p>was a little nutrition class and then</p>
<p>there was a it was a joke and so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>graduating going okay how do I do this</p>
<p>so you just have to figure it out when</p>
<p>you graduated so there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>enough time to really learn everything</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re in school because you just</p>
<p>have to get through the tests I mean</p>
<p>unfortunately that&rsquo;s how its rigged you</p>
<p>know so yeah so that&rsquo;s interesting I</p>
<p>mean as a naturopath I I look at my</p>
<p>colleagues now I don&rsquo;t practice as a</p>
<p>naturopath anymore only because I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>moved out of Canada and now I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>Portugal I have to figure out getting a</p>
<p>license here I did get a license in</p>
<p>Mozambique in about six months let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>how long it&rsquo;s gonna take me here I mean</p>
<p>I I like to keep my my license active I</p>
<p>do like to see people in clinic so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that I&rsquo;ll probably look into</p>
<p>but since I&rsquo;ve been working with IDM its</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be three years coming up very</p>
<p>shortly the first two years I was in</p>
<p>clinic but during that time we already</p>
<p>had this online program so you get to</p>
<p>speak with a lot of people all over the</p>
<p>world which is wonderful and for me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really all I want to do I</p>
<p>consider myself a dietary educator I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily work as a naturopath</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me whether I</p>
<p>have a naturopathic license or not does</p>
<p>naturopath tend to do many other things</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re running Theriot</p>
<p>specifically they&rsquo;re considered primary</p>
<p>health care providers this is</p>
<p>in Canada and the province where dr.</p>
<p>Fung and Megan are at so I was actually</p>
<p>supposed to be following people as a</p>
<p>primary health care provider but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not really what I do I provide dietary</p>
<p>education so I help people as you said</p>
<p>with low carb diets and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and I can do that anywhere</p>
<p>online what works out really well</p>
<p>especially because people need constant</p>
<p>support when they&rsquo;re starting out they</p>
<p>have questions they want to be able to</p>
<p>you know call you and so this is the</p>
<p>program that Megan and dr. Fong have set</p>
<p>up I think that&rsquo;s smart you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>reach more people and you don&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>we with the internet you eliminated</p>
<p>space so you can pretty much contact</p>
<p>anyone anywhere without having to drive</p>
<p>there or travel or anything like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so nice and and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to get that if this happens</p>
<p>with you but you have someone that might</p>
<p>meet some help and they they start</p>
<p>presenting all their symptoms and</p>
<p>everything and it really comes back down</p>
<p>to okay well let&rsquo;s first make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the basics okay you know</p>
<p>boom boom boom and usually they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you get them doing the basics nothing</p>
<p>fancy and they start seeing amazing</p>
<p>results so that&rsquo;s one of the things that</p>
<p>frustrated me frustrated me because I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do enough education in my clinic</p>
<p>so they were constantly just dependent</p>
<p>on dr. Berg what do I do for this what I</p>
<p>do for that and now it&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing videos put them out there this is</p>
<p>how you get the basics in there and then</p>
<p>the amount of results and you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to necessarily treat every single</p>
<p>symptom because they it gets better by</p>
<p>getting in these basic really vital key</p>
<p>things which I think if they were</p>
<p>implemented it would just you know</p>
<p>create a huge dent into all these these</p>
<p>problems now and the drugs and</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s just insane I mean</p>
<p>the simple thing of cutting your carbs</p>
<p>down fasting those two things right</p>
<p>there okay so you&rsquo;re gonna handle so</p>
<p>many issues yeah and it sounds I mean</p>
<p>today when we tell people well let&rsquo;s do</p>
<p>some fasting but let&rsquo;s cut your carbs</p>
<p>they you know you know get unless it</p>
<p>come to you right once they&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>done their own sort of processing and</p>
<p>journey and they come to you and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ready beautiful it works out really well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simple you know it&rsquo;s this is what</p>
<p>dr. Fung is always saying it&rsquo;s simple</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s free you know fasting is super easy</p>
<p>once you exercise that muscle of course</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m talking about fasting there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>many different schedules for many</p>
<p>different people and you can you know</p>
<p>you can start with the basics which is</p>
<p>just cutting out snacks for example this</p>
<p>is huge and then you know all the other</p>
<p>intermittent fasting scheduling</p>
<p>protocols can be implemented over time</p>
<p>depending on people&rsquo;s comfort level</p>
<p>depending on their goals etc but when</p>
<p>you tell them tell somebody who&rsquo;s slowly</p>
<p>not ready or hasn&rsquo;t been properly and</p>
<p>educated they think you&rsquo;re completely</p>
<p>nuts and brought it it&rsquo;s so funny</p>
<p>because just this weekend or I guess</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s Saturday but just yesterday it</p>
<p>was it was a holiday here on Thursday so</p>
<p>for me this is a long weekend but I was</p>
<p>looking at the history of sort of the</p>
<p>Canadian dietary guidelines because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the same as everywhere else in the world</p>
<p>right the dietary guidelines are very</p>
<p>similar all over and influenced by a</p>
<p>whole bunch of stuff I was looking I</p>
<p>wanted to see what it would it look like</p>
<p>before you know the famous 77 1982 sort</p>
<p>of guidelines like Amen started all this</p>
<p>craziness that were you know but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>now kind of having to deal with and and</p>
<p>I found this awesome little thing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called it&rsquo;s not a it wasn&rsquo;t a guide live</p>
<p>it was like a food what what you should</p>
<p>eat basically for Canadians in 1949 and</p>
<p>it was they had breakfast and they had</p>
<p>some instructions basic stuff it was</p>
<p>like an egg and bread yes they did he</p>
<p>carves it&rsquo;s not that people didn&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>carbs but if you look at this just this</p>
<p>basic it was a breakfast with you know</p>
<p>with an egg and it was a piece of slice</p>
<p>of toast I think with butter and it was</p>
<p>cereal with milk</p>
<p>I was breakfast</p>
<p>was it said lunch or lunch or dinner</p>
<p>assuming that people weren&rsquo;t having a</p>
<p>whole bunch of meals which many very for</p>
<p>me this doesn&rsquo;t shock me because I</p>
<p>always use the example of Mozambique</p>
<p>people in Mozambique</p>
<p>not in the city but in the country still</p>
<p>live a very rural obviously life me can</p>
<p>live off the land okay they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>money to go to grocery stores and buy</p>
<p>stuff so they live off the land if I</p>
<p>basic things there&rsquo;s basically two or</p>
<p>three things that they buy a month and</p>
<p>then the rest of the stuff they grow and</p>
<p>they have one or two meals simple and I</p>
<p>think people think of fasting is this</p>
<p>like oh my gosh craziness but not too</p>
<p>long ago people were having two maybe</p>
<p>three meals and that was it and that was</p>
<p>normal no snacks snacking was completely</p>
<p>ridiculous</p>
<p>there was no packaged stuff anyway you</p>
<p>know most of the time there is people</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t they live off of normal</p>
<p>stuff you know they could have bread</p>
<p>they did have rice they had potatoes</p>
<p>potatoes was on this pie line I think it</p>
<p>was pretty important back in 1949 in</p>
<p>Canada but it was yeah within their</p>
<p>meals and dr. fun talks about this all</p>
<p>the time you know every culture let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>have a staple you know like in parts of</p>
<p>of Africa sweet potato or it&rsquo;s Tsavo</p>
<p>which is a root whatever and in Asia we</p>
<p>all know they eat a lot of rice it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>within their meals the main thing there</p>
<p>is that they were eating main meals not</p>
<p>snacking so they were eating two three</p>
<p>meals a day what&rsquo;s happening now with</p>
<p>your patients and my clients doctor is</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re already insulin resistant I</p>
<p>already have a metabolic syndrome so now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking about healthy diet now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about therapeutic eating</p>
<p>and how our therapeutic fasting right</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to help somebody reverse a</p>
<p>situation that&rsquo;s been caused by eating</p>
<p>too often so now you need to eat less</p>
<p>often right</p>
<p>yeah our bodies were developed ten tens</p>
<p>of thousands of years to not eat and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you know we&rsquo;re not like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>specialists at starving and surviving</p>
<p>under conditions where where there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a lot of food that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s in our DNA and</p>
<p>we do very well with that we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>good at storing fat we can store an</p>
<p>unlimited amount of energy and that came</p>
<p>that environment but now I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to believe but you can actually</p>
<p>call someone in order food delivered to</p>
<p>already cooked within a half-hour that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible it&rsquo;s amazing eats even</p>
<p>existed it to lemon was to Portugal I am</p>
<p>sure they have any Canada but I just I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s like you can get food</p>
<p>instantly because I got to eat every</p>
<p>hour and a half I just have to</p>
<p>constantly eat if it&rsquo;s the situation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m really excited to have you come</p>
<p>to our summit have you ever been to</p>
<p>Washington DC I don&rsquo;t think that I have</p>
<p>no not Washington I do have a very good</p>
<p>friend that lives in Washington you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>think I would have gone sooner but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so excited oh you&rsquo;re gonna love it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually gonna be in Maryland but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right over the border but it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a simple gorgeous place it&rsquo;ll be at the</p>
<p>Gaylord hotel which is a hotel that I</p>
<p>always wanted to do an event at or a</p>
<p>seminar we&rsquo;re doing our second one it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just it is just simply gorgeous it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>massive and they&rsquo;ll be the coolest</p>
<p>people that you&rsquo;ve ever met will fly in</p>
<p>there and these are people just watching</p>
<p>us on YouTube and they know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna come and they&rsquo;re all just very</p>
<p>enthusiastic and we&rsquo;ll have a blast some</p>
<p>great speakers and you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>talking about PCOS in detail but but</p>
<p>making it simple for people to get so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be exciting I&rsquo;m super</p>
<p>excited I loved your your YouTube video</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a proper name for it but your</p>
<p>launch figures it&rsquo;s super it made me</p>
<p>really excited to think about being part</p>
<p>of it</p>
<p>oh great yeah I had um I had Jared who</p>
<p>basically is a guidance never been</p>
<p>trained on video he just watched YouTube</p>
<p>videos he learned how to edit he does</p>
<p>all my he&rsquo;s my videographer he does all</p>
<p>my video and editing and he just did an</p>
<p>incredible job of putting together</p>
<p>the difference between last year and</p>
<p>this year&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re shooting</p>
<p>for a thousand people so it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>double the size so it&rsquo;s just a bunch of</p>
<p>really amazing people that just love the</p>
<p>information and we&rsquo;re gonna have a</p>
<p>really good time so those of you that</p>
<p>are watching it&rsquo;s a mandatory seminar</p>
<p>you have to come though</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a link down below so you could</p>
<p>actually check it out but we&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>filling up pretty fast and so those are</p>
<p>people are sitting on the edge don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait too long because I would hate to</p>
<p>have you go our books we can&rsquo;t fit</p>
<p>anyone else in the room because you have</p>
<p>to book these a year in advance by the</p>
<p>way and this is what&rsquo;s happening to do</p>
<p>many of the low carb conferences that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been going to right like before it</p>
<p>was like you know a couple dozen people</p>
<p>maybe then it was a hundred two hundred</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re seeing close to a thousand</p>
<p>people and then it&rsquo;s you know a month</p>
<p>before or so we&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>more spots and we&rsquo;ve got a whole bunch</p>
<p>of people that are desperately trying to</p>
<p>get a spot but you can&rsquo;t right you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>magically create more room and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spying this hat this is happy it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening which is a good sign it just</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of doctors that</p>
<p>come to these things because doctors of</p>
<p>course you want to make a difference</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a big bone right but they want</p>
<p>to learn a and then there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>bunch of people other people that have</p>
<p>been affected by this personally and</p>
<p>just really want to be continued to be a</p>
<p>part of it or people that are learning</p>
<p>about it so I I it is true what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying I think if people are interested</p>
<p>in coming to this one specifically I you</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;m saying that just based on</p>
<p>experience for my own clients because I</p>
<p>know I had a lot of people really</p>
<p>disappointed that they hadn&rsquo;t weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>able to go to past ones yeah awesome</p>
<p>thank you so much</p>
