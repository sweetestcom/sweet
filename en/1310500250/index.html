    <p>The following is a conversation with Peter White,</p>
<p>a theoretical physicist at Columbia,</p>
<p>outspoken critic of string theory,</p>
<p>and the author of the popular physics and mathematics blog</p>
<p>called Not Even Wrong.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Peter White.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both a physicist and a mathematician.</p>
<p>So let me ask, what is the difference</p>
<p>between physics and mathematics?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s kind of a conventional understanding</p>
<p>of the subject that they&rsquo;re two quite different things.</p>
<p>So that mathematics is about making rigorous statements</p>
<p>about these abstract things,</p>
<p>things of mathematics, and proving them rigorously.</p>
<p>And physics is about doing experiments</p>
<p>and testing various models and that.</p>
<p>But I think the more interesting thing</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a wide variety of what people do</p>
<p>as mathematics, what they do as physics,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a significant overlap.</p>
<p>And that, I think, is actually a very interesting area.</p>
<p>And if you go back kind of far enough in history</p>
<p>and look at figures like Newton or something,</p>
<p>at that point, you can&rsquo;t really tell,</p>
<p>was Newton a physicist or a mathematician?</p>
<p>Mathematicians will tell you he was a mathematician.</p>
<p>The physicists will tell you he was a physicist.</p>
<p>But he would say he&rsquo;s a philosopher.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But yeah, anyway, there was kind of no such distinction</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s more of a modern thing.</p>
<p>But anyway, I think these days,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very interesting space in between the two.</p>
<p>So in the story of the 20th century</p>
<p>and the early 21st century,</p>
<p>what is the overlap between mathematics and physics,</p>
<p>would you say?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s actually become very, very complicated.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really interesting to see</p>
<p>a lot of what my colleagues in the math department</p>
<p>are doing, most of what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing all sorts of different things,</p>
<p>but most of them have some kind of overlap</p>
<p>with physics or other.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I&rsquo;m personally interested</p>
<p>in one particular aspect of this overlap,</p>
<p>which I think has a lot to do with the most fundamental ideas</p>
<p>about physics and about mathematics.</p>
<p>But you kind of see this really everywhere at this point.</p>
<p>Which particular overlap are you looking at, group theory?</p>
<p>Yeah, so at least the way it seems to me</p>
<p>that if you look at physics</p>
<p>and look at our most successful laws of fundamental physics,</p>
<p>they have a certain kind of mathematical structure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s based upon certain kind of mathematical objects</p>
<p>and geometry, connections and curvature,</p>
<p>the spinners, the Dirac equation.</p>
<p>And this very deep mathematics provides kind of a unifying</p>
<p>set of ways of thinking that allow you</p>
<p>to make a unified theory of physics.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing is that if you go to mathematics</p>
<p>and look at what&rsquo;s been going on in mathematics</p>
<p>the last 50, 100 years, and even especially recently,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a similarly some kind of unifying ideas</p>
<p>which bring together different areas of mathematics</p>
<p>and which have been established in the last 50, 100 years.</p>
<p>Especially powerful in number theory recently.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a book, for instance, by Edward Frankel</p>
<p>about love and math.</p>
<p>Yeah, that book&rsquo;s great, I recommend it highly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partially accessible.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a nice audio book that I listened to</p>
<p>while running an exceptionally long distance,</p>
<p>like across the San Francisco bridge.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something magic about the way he writes about it.</p>
<p>But some of the group theory in there</p>
<p>is a little bit difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the problem with any of these things,</p>
<p>to kind of really say what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and make it accessible is very hard.</p>
<p>He, in this book and elsewhere, I think takes the attitude</p>
<p>that kinds of mathematics he&rsquo;s interested in</p>
<p>and that he&rsquo;s talking about provide</p>
<p>kind of a grand unified theory of mathematics.</p>
<p>They bring together geometry and number theory</p>
<p>and representation theory, a lot of different ideas</p>
<p>in a really unexpected way.</p>
<p>But I think, to me, the most fascinating thing</p>
<p>is if you look at the kind of grand unified theory</p>
<p>of mathematics he&rsquo;s talking about</p>
<p>and you look at the physicist kind of ideas</p>
<p>about unification, it&rsquo;s more or less</p>
<p>the same mathematical objects are appearing in both.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this, I think there&rsquo;s a really,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing a really strong indication</p>
<p>that the deepest ideas that we&rsquo;re discovering about physics</p>
<p>and some of the deepest ideas that mathematicians</p>
<p>are learning about are really, are intimately connected.</p>
<p>Is there something, like if I was five years old</p>
<p>and you were trying to explain this to me,</p>
<p>is there ways to try to sneak up</p>
<p>to what this unified world of mathematics looks like?</p>
<p>You said number theory, you said geometry,</p>
<p>words like topology.</p>
<p>What does this universe begin to look like?</p>
<p>Are these, what should we imagine in our mind?</p>
<p>Is it a three dimensional surface?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying to say something about it.</p>
<p>Is it triangles and squares and cubes?</p>
<p>Like what are we supposed to imagine in our minds?</p>
<p>Is this natural number?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good thing to try to,</p>
<p>for people that don&rsquo;t know any of these tools</p>
<p>except maybe some basic calculus and geometry</p>
<p>from high school that they should keep in their minds</p>
<p>as to the unified world of mathematics</p>
<p>that also allows us to explore the unified world of physics.</p>
<p>I mean, what I find kind of remarkable about this</p>
<p>is the way in which these, we&rsquo;ve discovered these ideas,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually quite alien</p>
<p>to our everyday understanding.</p>
<p>We grow up in this three spatial dimensional world</p>
<p>and we have intimate understanding</p>
<p>of certain kinds of geometry and certain kinds of things.</p>
<p>But these things that we&rsquo;ve discovered</p>
<p>in both math and physics are,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not at all close,</p>
<p>have any obvious connection</p>
<p>to kind of human everyday experience.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really quite different.</p>
<p>And I can say some of my initial fascination with this</p>
<p>when I was young and starting to learn about it</p>
<p>was actually exactly this kind of arcane nature</p>
<p>of these things.</p>
<p>It was a little bit like being told,</p>
<p>well, there are these kind of semi mystical experience</p>
<p>that you can acquire by a long study and whatever,</p>
<p>except that it was actually true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually evidence that this actually works.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a little bit wary of trying to give people</p>
<p>that kind of thing,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s mostly misleading.</p>
<p>But one thing to say is that geometry is a large part of it.</p>
<p>And maybe one interesting thing to say very,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about more recent, some of the most recent ideas</p>
<p>is that when we think about the geometry</p>
<p>of our space and time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of three spatial and one time dimension.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a physics is in some sense</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s kind of four dimensional in a way.</p>
<p>And a really interesting thing about</p>
<p>some of the recent developments and number theory</p>
<p>have been to realize that these ideas</p>
<p>that we were looking at naturally fit into a context</p>
<p>where your theory is kind of four dimensional.</p>
<p>So, geometry is a big part of this</p>
<p>and we know a lot and feel a lot about</p>
<p>two, one, two, three dimensional geometry.</p>
<p>So wait a minute, so we can at least rely</p>
<p>on the four dimensions of space and time</p>
<p>and say that we can get pretty far</p>
<p>by working in those four dimensions.</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna scare me</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna have to go to many, many, many,</p>
<p>many more dimensions than that.</p>
<p>My point of view, which goes against</p>
<p>a lot of these ideas about unification</p>
<p>is that no, this is really,</p>
<p>everything we know about really is about four dimensions</p>
<p>and that you can actually understand a lot of these</p>
<p>structures that we&rsquo;ve been seeing in fundamental physics</p>
<p>and in number theory, just in terms of four dimensions,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s in some sense I would claim</p>
<p>has been a really, has been kind of a mistake</p>
<p>that physicists have made for decades and decades</p>
<p>to try to go to higher dimensions,</p>
<p>to try to formulate a theory in higher dimensions</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re stuck with the problem</p>
<p>of how do you get rid of all these extra dimensions</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>because we only ever see anything in four dimensions.</p>
<p>That kind of thing leaves us astray, you think?</p>
<p>So creating all these extra dimensions</p>
<p>just to give yourself extra degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the process of mathematics</p>
<p>is to create all of these trajectories for yourself</p>
<p>but eventually you have to end up at the final place</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s okay to sort of create abstract objects</p>
<p>on your path to proving something.</p>
<p>Yeah, certainly and from a mathematician&rsquo;s point of view,</p>
<p>I mean, the kinds of,</p>
<p>mathematicians also are very different than physicists</p>
<p>in that we like to develop very general theories.</p>
<p>We like to, if we have an idea,</p>
<p>we want to see what&rsquo;s the greatest generality</p>
<p>in which you can talk about it.</p>
<p>So from the point of view of most of the ways geometry</p>
<p>is formulated by mathematicians,</p>
<p>it really doesn&rsquo;t matter, it works in any dimension.</p>
<p>We can do one, two, three, four, any number.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no particular, for most of geometry,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no particular special thing about four.</p>
<p>But anyway, but what physicists have been trying to do</p>
<p>over the years is try to understand</p>
<p>these fundamental theories in a geometrical way</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very tempting to kind of just start bringing in</p>
<p>extra dimensions and using them to explain the structure.</p>
<p>But typically this attempt kind of founders</p>
<p>because you just don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you end up not being able to explain why we only see four.</p>
<p>It is nice in the space of physics</p>
<p>that like if you look at Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much easier to prove that there&rsquo;s no solution</p>
<p>for n equals three than it is for the general case.</p>
<p>And so I guess that&rsquo;s the nice benefit of being a physicist</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the general case</p>
<p>because we live in a universe with n equals four</p>
<p>in this case.</p>
<p>Yeah, physicists are very interested in saying something</p>
<p>about specific examples and I find that interesting</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m trying to do things in mathematics</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m even teaching courses into mathematics students,</p>
<p>I find that I&rsquo;m teaching them in a different way</p>
<p>than most mathematicians because I&rsquo;m very often</p>
<p>very focused on examples on what&rsquo;s kind of the crucial</p>
<p>example that shows how this powerful new mathematical</p>
<p>technique, how it works and why you would want to do it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m less interested in kind of proving a precise theorem</p>
<p>about exactly when it&rsquo;s gonna work</p>
<p>and when it&rsquo;s not gonna work.</p>
<p>Do you usually think about really simple examples,</p>
<p>like both for teaching and when you try to solve</p>
<p>a difficult problem, do you construct the simplest</p>
<p>possible examples that captures the fundamentals</p>
<p>of the problem and try to solve it?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, that&rsquo;s often a really fruitful way</p>
<p>to if you&rsquo;ve got some idea to just kind of try</p>
<p>to boil it down to what&rsquo;s the simplest situation</p>
<p>in which this kind of thing is gonna happen</p>
<p>and then try to really understand that and understand that</p>
<p>and that is almost always a really good way</p>
<p>to get insight into it.</p>
<p>Do you work with paper and pen or like, for example,</p>
<p>for me coming from the programming side,</p>
<p>if I look at a model, if I look at some kind</p>
<p>of mathematical object, I like to mess around</p>
<p>with it sort of numerically.</p>
<p>I just visualize different parts of it,</p>
<p>visualize however I can so most of the work</p>
<p>is like when you&rsquo;re on networks, for example,</p>
<p>is you try to play with the simplest possible example</p>
<p>and just to build up intuition by any kind of object</p>
<p>has a bunch of variables in it and you start</p>
<p>to mess around with them in different ways</p>
<p>and visualize in different ways to start</p>
<p>to build intuition or do you go the Einstein route</p>
<p>and just imagine everything inside your mind</p>
<p>and sort of build thought experiments</p>
<p>and then work purely on paper and pen?</p>
<p>Well, the problem with this kind of stuff</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in is you rarely can kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s rarely something that is really kind of,</p>
<p>or even the simplest example, you can kind of see</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on by looking at something happening</p>
<p>in three dimensions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s generally the structures involved</p>
<p>are either they&rsquo;re more abstract</p>
<p>or if you try to kind of embed them in some kind of space</p>
<p>and where you could manipulate them</p>
<p>in some kind of geometrical way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be a much higher dimensional space.</p>
<p>So even simple examples,</p>
<p>the embedding them into three dimensional space,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, but to capture what you&rsquo;re trying to understand</p>
<p>about them, you have to go to four or more dimensions.</p>
<p>So it starts to get to be hard to,</p>
<p>I mean, you can train yourself to try it as much</p>
<p>as to kind of think about things in your mind</p>
<p>and I often use pad and paper</p>
<p>and often if I&rsquo;m in my office, I have to use the blackboard</p>
<p>and you are kind of drawing things</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re really kind of more abstract representations</p>
<p>of how things are supposed to fit together</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not really, unfortunately,</p>
<p>not just kind of really living in three dimensions</p>
<p>where you can.</p>
<p>Are we supposed to be sad or excited</p>
<p>by the fact that our human minds</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fully comprehend the kind of mathematics</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>I mean, what do we make of that?</p>
<p>I mean, to me, that makes you quite sad.</p>
<p>It makes it seem like there&rsquo;s a giant mystery out there</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll never truly get to experience directly.</p>
<p>It is kind of sad how difficult this is.</p>
<p>I mean, or I would put it a different way</p>
<p>that most questions that people have</p>
<p>about this kind of thing,</p>
<p>you can give them a really true answer</p>
<p>and really understand it</p>
<p>but the problem is one more of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yes, I could explain to you how this works</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d have to be willing to sit down with me</p>
<p>and work at this repeatedly for hours and days and weeks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just gonna take that long for your mind</p>
<p>to really wrap itself around what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and so that does make things inaccessible which is sad</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just kind of part of life</p>
<p>that we all have a limited amount of time</p>
<p>and we have to decide what we&rsquo;re gonna spend our time doing.</p>
<p>Speaking of a limited amount of time,</p>
<p>we only have a few hours, maybe a few days together</p>
<p>here on this podcast.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the question of amongst many of the ideas</p>
<p>that you work on in mathematics and physics,</p>
<p>which is the most beautiful idea</p>
<p>or one of the most beautiful ideas, maybe a surprising idea</p>
<p>and once again, unfortunately, the way life works,</p>
<p>we only have a limited time together</p>
<p>to try to convey such an idea.</p>
<p>Okay, well, actually, let me just tell you something which</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to kind of start trying to explain</p>
<p>what I think is this most powerful idea</p>
<p>that brings together math and physics,</p>
<p>ideas about groups and representations</p>
<p>and how it fits in quantum mechanics</p>
<p>but in some sense, I wrote a whole textbook about that</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think we really have time</p>
<p>to get very far into it so.</p>
<p>Well, can I actually, on a small tangent,</p>
<p>you did write a paper towards a grant unified theory</p>
<p>mathematics and physics, maybe you could step there first,</p>
<p>what is the key idea in that paper?</p>
<p>Well, I think we&rsquo;ve kind of gone over that.</p>
<p>I think that the key idea is what we were talking about</p>
<p>earlier that just kind of a claim that if you look</p>
<p>and see what have been successful ideas in unification</p>
<p>in physics and over the last 50 years or so</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s been happening in mathematics</p>
<p>and the kind of thing that Frankel&rsquo;s book is about</p>
<p>that these are very much the same kind of mathematics</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s kind of an argument that there really is,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t be looking to unify just math</p>
<p>or just fundamental physics but taking inspiration</p>
<p>for looking for new ideas in fundamental physics</p>
<p>that they are gonna be in the same direction</p>
<p>of getting deeper into mathematics</p>
<p>and looking for more inspiration in mathematics</p>
<p>from these successful ideas about fundamental physics.</p>
<p>Could you put words to sort of the disciplines</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to unify?</p>
<p>So you said number theory, are we literally talking</p>
<p>about all the major fields of mathematics?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the number theory, geometry,</p>
<p>so the differential geometry, topology.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the, I mean, one name for this</p>
<p>that this is acquired in mathematics</p>
<p>is the so called Langlands program</p>
<p>and so this started out in mathematics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that Robert Langlands kind of realized</p>
<p>that a lot of what people were doing</p>
<p>and that was starting to be really successful</p>
<p>in number theory in the 60s</p>
<p>and so that this actually was,</p>
<p>anyway, that this could be thought of</p>
<p>in terms of these ideas about symmetry</p>
<p>and groups and representations</p>
<p>and in a way that was also close</p>
<p>to some ideas about geometry</p>
<p>and then more later on in the 80s, 90s,</p>
<p>there was something called geometric Langlands</p>
<p>that people realize that you could take</p>
<p>what people have been doing in number theory in Langlands</p>
<p>and get rid, just forget about the number theory</p>
<p>and ask what is this telling you about geometry</p>
<p>and you get a whole, some new insights</p>
<p>into certain kinds of geometry that way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, anyway, that&rsquo;s kind of the name</p>
<p>for this area is Langlands and geometric Langlands</p>
<p>and just recently in the last few months,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been, there&rsquo;s kind of really major paper</p>
<p>that appeared by Peter Schultze and Laurent Farg</p>
<p>where they made some serious advance</p>
<p>to try to understand very much kind of a local problem</p>
<p>of what happens in number theory</p>
<p>near a certain prime number</p>
<p>and they turned this into a problem</p>
<p>of exactly the kind that geometric Langlands people</p>
<p>had been doing, this kind of pure geometry problem</p>
<p>and they found by generalizing mathematics,</p>
<p>they could actually reformulate it in that way</p>
<p>and it worked perfectly well.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes me sad is I&rsquo;m a pretty</p>
<p>knowledgeable person and then, what is it?</p>
<p>At least I&rsquo;m in the neighborhood</p>
<p>like theoretical computer science, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still way out of my reach</p>
<p>and so many people talk about like Langlands, for example,</p>
<p>is one of the most brilliant people in mathematics</p>
<p>and just really admire his work</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s like almost I can&rsquo;t hear the music</p>
<p>that he composed and it makes me sad.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, I think unfortunately,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just you, it&rsquo;s I think even most mathematicians</p>
<p>have no, really don&rsquo;t actually understand</p>
<p>what this is about.</p>
<p>I mean, the group of people who really understand</p>
<p>all these ideas and so for instance,</p>
<p>this paper of Schultz and Farg that I was talking about,</p>
<p>the number of people who really actually understand</p>
<p>how that works is anyway, very, very small</p>
<p>and so I think even you find if you talk to mathematicians</p>
<p>and physicists, even they will often feel that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this really interesting sounding stuff going on</p>
<p>and which I should be able to understand,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of in my own field, I have a PhD in</p>
<p>but it still seems pretty clearly far beyond me right now.</p>
<p>Well, if we can step into the back to the question</p>
<p>of beauty, is there an idea that maybe</p>
<p>is a little bit smaller that you find beautiful</p>
<p>in the space of mathematics or physics?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an idea that I kind of went, got a physics PhD</p>
<p>and spent a lot of time learning about mathematics</p>
<p>and I guess it was embarrassing</p>
<p>that I hadn&rsquo;t really actually understand</p>
<p>this very simple idea until I kind of learned it</p>
<p>when I actually started teaching math classes,</p>
<p>which is maybe that there&rsquo;s a simple way</p>
<p>to explain kind of the fundamental way</p>
<p>in which algebra and geometry are connected.</p>
<p>So you normally think of geometry as about these spaces</p>
<p>and these points and you think of algebra</p>
<p>as this very abstract thing about these abstract objects</p>
<p>that satisfy certain kinds of relations,</p>
<p>you can multiply them and add them and do stuff</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s completely abstract,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing geometric about it</p>
<p>but the kind of really fundamental idea</p>
<p>is that unifies algebra and geometry</p>
<p>is to think whenever anybody gives you</p>
<p>what you call an algebra, some abstract thing</p>
<p>of things that you can multiply and add</p>
<p>that you should ask yourself,</p>
<p>is that algebra the space of functions on some geometry?</p>
<p>So one of the most surprising examples of this,</p>
<p>for instance, is a standard kind of thing</p>
<p>that seems to have nothing to do with geometry</p>
<p>is the integers.</p>
<p>So you can multiply them and add them, it&rsquo;s an algebra</p>
<p>but it seems to have nothing to do with geometry</p>
<p>but what you can, it turns out,</p>
<p>but if you ask yourself this question</p>
<p>and ask, you know, are integers,</p>
<p>can you think, if somebody gives you an integer,</p>
<p>can you think of it as a function on some space,</p>
<p>on some geometry?</p>
<p>And it turns out that yes, you can</p>
<p>and the space is the space of prime numbers</p>
<p>and so what you do is you just,</p>
<p>if somebody gives you an integer,</p>
<p>you can make a function on the prime numbers</p>
<p>by just, you know, at each prime number taking that,</p>
<p>that integer modulo that prime.</p>
<p>So if you say, I don&rsquo;t know, if you&rsquo;re given 10,</p>
<p>you know, 10 and you ask, what is its value at two?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s five times two, so mod two, it&rsquo;s zero,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s zero one.</p>
<p>What is its value at three?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s nine plus one, so it&rsquo;s one mod three.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s zero at two, it&rsquo;s one at three</p>
<p>and you can kind of keep going.</p>
<p>And so this is really kind of a truly fundamental idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at the basis of what&rsquo;s called algebraic geometry</p>
<p>and it just links these two parts of mathematics</p>
<p>that look completely different</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just an incredibly powerful idea</p>
<p>and so much of mathematics emerges</p>
<p>from this kind of simple relation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about mapping</p>
<p>from one discrete space to another.</p>
<p>So for a second, I thought perhaps mapping</p>
<p>like a continuous space to a discrete space,</p>
<p>like functions over a continuous space, because yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you can take, if somebody gives you a space,</p>
<p>you can ask, you can say, well, let&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and this is also, this is part of the same idea.</p>
<p>The part of the same idea is that if you try</p>
<p>and do geometry and somebody tells you, here&rsquo;s a space,</p>
<p>that what you should do is you should wait,</p>
<p>so say, wait a minute,</p>
<p>maybe I should be trying to solve this using algebra.</p>
<p>And so if I do that, the way to start is,</p>
<p>you give me the space,</p>
<p>I start to think about the functions of the space, okay?</p>
<p>So for each point in the space, I associate a number.</p>
<p>I can take different kinds of functions</p>
<p>and different kinds of values,</p>
<p>but basically functions on a space.</p>
<p>So what this insight is telling you is that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a geometer, often the way to work</p>
<p>is to change your problem into algebra</p>
<p>by changing your space, stop thinking about your space</p>
<p>and the points in it and think about the functions on it.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re an algebraist</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got these abstract algebraic gadgets</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re multiplying and adding, say, wait a minute,</p>
<p>are those gadgets, can I think of them in some way</p>
<p>as a function on a space?</p>
<p>What would that space be</p>
<p>and what kind of functions would they be?</p>
<p>And that going back and forth really brings</p>
<p>these two completely different looking areas</p>
<p>of mathematics together.</p>
<p>Do you have particular examples where it allowed</p>
<p>to prove some difficult things</p>
<p>by jumping from one to the other?</p>
<p>Is that something that&rsquo;s a part of modern mathematics</p>
<p>where such jumps are made?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, this is kind of all the time.</p>
<p>Much of modern number theory is kind of based on this idea.</p>
<p>But, and when you start doing this,</p>
<p>you start to realize that you need,</p>
<p>what simple things on one side of the algebra</p>
<p>start to require you to think about the other side,</p>
<p>about geometry in a new way.</p>
<p>You have to kind of get a more sophisticated idea</p>
<p>about geometry, or if you start thinking</p>
<p>about the functions on a space,</p>
<p>you may need a more sophisticated kind of algebra.</p>
<p>But in some sense, I mean,</p>
<p>much or most of modern number theory</p>
<p>is based upon this move to geometry.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a lot of geometry</p>
<p>and topology is also based upon, yeah, change.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the topology of something,</p>
<p>you look at the functions, you do drum comology</p>
<p>and you get the topology.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you then the ridiculous question.</p>
<p>You said that this idea is beautiful.</p>
<p>Can you formalize the definition of the word beautiful?</p>
<p>And why is this beautiful?</p>
<p>First, why is this beautiful?</p>
<p>And second, what is beautiful?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and I think there are many different things</p>
<p>you can find beautiful for different reasons.</p>
<p>I mean, I think in this context, the notion of beauty,</p>
<p>I think really is just kind of an idea is beautiful</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s packages a huge amount of kind of power</p>
<p>and information into something very simple.</p>
<p>So in some sense, you can almost kind of try and measure it</p>
<p>in the sense of what are the implications of this idea?</p>
<p>What non trivial things does it tell you</p>
<p>versus how simply can you express the idea?</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>So the level of compression,</p>
<p>what is it correlates with beauty?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one aspect of it.</p>
<p>And so you can start to tell that an idea</p>
<p>is becoming uglier and uglier</p>
<p>as you start kind of having to,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t quite do what you want.</p>
<p>So you throw in something else to the idea</p>
<p>and you keep doing that until you get what you want.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how you know you&rsquo;re doing something uglier</p>
<p>and uglier when you have to kind of keep adding</p>
<p>and more into what was originally a fairly simple idea</p>
<p>and making it more and more complicated</p>
<p>to get what you want.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s put some philosophical words on the table</p>
<p>and try to make some sense of them.</p>
<p>One word is beauty, another one is simplicity</p>
<p>as you mentioned, another one is truth.</p>
<p>So do you have a sense if I give you two theories,</p>
<p>one is simpler, one is more complicated.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of which one is more likely to be true</p>
<p>to capture deeply the fabric of reality,</p>
<p>the simple one or the more complicated one?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think all of our evidence,</p>
<p>what we see in the history of the subject</p>
<p>is the simpler one though.</p>
<p>Often it&rsquo;s a surprise, it&rsquo;s simpler in a surprising way.</p>
<p>But yeah, that we just don&rsquo;t, we just,</p>
<p>anyway, the kind of best theories</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been coming up with are ultimately</p>
<p>when properly understood, relatively simple</p>
<p>and much, much simpler than you would expect them to be.</p>
<p>Do you have a good explanation why that is?</p>
<p>Is it just because humans want it to be that way?</p>
<p>Are we just like ultra biased</p>
<p>and we just kind of convince ourselves</p>
<p>that simple is better because we find simplicity beautiful?</p>
<p>Or is there something about our actual universe</p>
<p>that at the core is simple?</p>
<p>My own belief is that there is something about a universe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s simple and as I was trying to say that,</p>
<p>there is some kind of fundamental thing about math,</p>
<p>physics and all this picture, which is in some sense simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that, it&rsquo;s of course true that our minds</p>
<p>have certain, are very limited</p>
<p>and can certainly do certain things and not others.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in principle possible</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some great insight in,</p>
<p>there are a lot of insights into the way the world works,</p>
<p>which just aren&rsquo;t accessible to us because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the way our minds work, we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that what we&rsquo;re seeing, this kind of simplicity</p>
<p>is just because that&rsquo;s all we ever have any hope of seeing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a brilliant physicist</p>
<p>by the name of Sabine Hassenfelder</p>
<p>who both agrees and disagrees with you.</p>
<p>I suppose agrees that the final answer will be simple.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But simplicity and beauty leads us astray</p>
<p>in the local pockets of scientific progress.</p>
<p>Do you agree with her disagreement</p>
<p>and do you disagree with her agreement?</p>
<p>And agree with the agreement and so on.</p>
<p>Anyway, yes, I found it was really fascinating</p>
<p>reading her book and anyway,</p>
<p>I was finding disagreeing with a lot,</p>
<p>but then at the end when she says yes,</p>
<p>when we find, when we actually figure this out,</p>
<p>it will be simple and okay, so we agree in the end.</p>
<p>But does beauty lead us astray,</p>
<p>which is the core thesis of her work in that book.</p>
<p>I actually, I guess I do disagree with her on that so much.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, and especially,</p>
<p>and I actually fairly strongly disagree with her</p>
<p>about sometimes the way she&rsquo;ll refer to math.</p>
<p>And so the problem is, physicists and people in general</p>
<p>just refer to it as math and they&rsquo;re often meaning</p>
<p>not what I would call math,</p>
<p>which is the interesting ideas of math,</p>
<p>but just some complicated calculation.</p>
<p>And so I guess my feeling about it is more that it&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>the problem with talking about simplicity</p>
<p>and using simplicity as a guide is that it&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to fool yourself</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very easy to decide to fall in love with an idea.</p>
<p>You have an idea, you think, oh, this is great</p>
<p>and you fall in love with it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like any kind of love affair,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to believe that the object of your affections</p>
<p>is much more beautiful than the others might think</p>
<p>and that they really are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very, very easy to do.</p>
<p>So if you say, I&rsquo;m just gonna pursue ideas about beauty</p>
<p>and this and mathematics and this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely easy to just fool yourself, I think.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a lot of what the story</p>
<p>she was thinking of about where people have gone astray,</p>
<p>that I think it&rsquo;s, I would argue that it&rsquo;s more people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that there was some simple, powerful,</p>
<p>wonderful idea which they&rsquo;d found</p>
<p>and it turned out not to be useful,</p>
<p>but it was more that they kind of fooled themselves</p>
<p>that this was actually a better idea than it really was</p>
<p>and that it was simpler and more beautiful</p>
<p>than it really was, is a lot of the story.</p>
<p>I see, so it&rsquo;s not that the simplicity of beauty</p>
<p>leads us astray, it&rsquo;s just people are people</p>
<p>and they fall in love with whatever idea they have</p>
<p>and then they weave narratives around that idea</p>
<p>or they present it in such a way</p>
<p>that emphasizes the simplicity and the beauty.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>But I mean, the thing about physics that you have</p>
<p>is that what really can tell,</p>
<p>if you can do an experiment and check</p>
<p>and see if nature is really doing what your idea expects,</p>
<p>you do in principle have a way of really testing it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s certainly true that if you thought</p>
<p>you had a simple idea and that doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>and you go out and do an experiment</p>
<p>and what actually does work is some more,</p>
<p>maybe some more complicated version of it,</p>
<p>that can certainly happen and that can be true.</p>
<p>I think her emphasis is more,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t really disagree with,</p>
<p>is that people should be concentrating</p>
<p>on when they&rsquo;re trying to develop better theories</p>
<p>on more on self consistency, not so much on beauty,</p>
<p>but not is this idea beautiful,</p>
<p>but is there something about the theory</p>
<p>which is not quite consistent and use that as a guide</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something wrong there which needs fixing.</p>
<p>And so I think that part of her argument,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re on the same page about.</p>
<p>What is consistency and inconsistencies?</p>
<p>What exactly, do you have examples in mind?</p>
<p>Well, it can be just simple inconsistency</p>
<p>between theory and an experiment that if you,</p>
<p>so we have this great fundamental theory,</p>
<p>but there are some things that we see out there</p>
<p>which don&rsquo;t seem to fit in it,</p>
<p>like dark energy and dark matter, for instance.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s something which you can&rsquo;t test experimentally,</p>
<p>I think she would argue and I would agree</p>
<p>that, for instance, if you&rsquo;re trying to think about gravity</p>
<p>and how are you gonna have a quantum theory of gravity,</p>
<p>you should kind of test any of your ideas</p>
<p>with kind of a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Does this actually give a consistent picture</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s gonna happen, of what happens</p>
<p>in this particular situation or not?</p>
<p>So this is a good example.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written about this.</p>
<p>Since quantum gravitational effects are really small,</p>
<p>super small, arguably unobservably small,</p>
<p>should we have hope to arrive</p>
<p>at a theory of quantum gravity somehow?</p>
<p>What are the different ways we can get there?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned that you&rsquo;re not as interested</p>
<p>in that effort because basically, yes,</p>
<p>you cannot have ways to scientifically validate it</p>
<p>given the tools of today.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve actually, you know, I&rsquo;ve over the years</p>
<p>certainly spent a lot of time learning about gravity</p>
<p>and about attempts to quantize it, but it hasn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>that much in the past the focus</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;ve been thinking about.</p>
<p>But I mean, my feeling was always, you know,</p>
<p>as I think Sabina would agree that the, you know,</p>
<p>one way you can pursue this if you can&rsquo;t do experiments</p>
<p>is just this kind of search for consistency.</p>
<p>You know, it can be remarkably hard to come up</p>
<p>with a completely consistent model of this</p>
<p>in a way that brings together quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and general relativity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think, kind of been the traditional way</p>
<p>that people who have pursued quantum gravity</p>
<p>have often pursued, you know,</p>
<p>we have the best route to finding a consistent theory</p>
<p>of quantum gravity and string theorists will tell you this,</p>
<p>other people will tell you it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of what people argue about.</p>
<p>But the problem with all of that is that you end up,</p>
<p>you know, the danger is that you end up with,</p>
<p>that everybody could be successful.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s program for how to find a theory</p>
<p>of quantum gravity, you know, ends up with something</p>
<p>that is consistent.</p>
<p>And so, and in some sense you could argue</p>
<p>this is what happened to the string theorists.</p>
<p>They solved their problem of finding a consistent theory</p>
<p>of quantum gravity and they ended up,</p>
<p>but they found 10 to the 500 solutions.</p>
<p>So you, you know, if you believe that everything</p>
<p>that they would like to be true is true,</p>
<p>well, okay, you&rsquo;ve got a theory,</p>
<p>but it ends up being kind of useless</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just one of an infinite,</p>
<p>essentially infinite number of things</p>
<p>which you have no way to experimentally distinguish.</p>
<p>And so this is just a depressing situation.</p>
<p>But I do think that there is a,</p>
<p>so again, I think pursuing ideas about what,</p>
<p>more about beauty and how can you integrate</p>
<p>and unify these issues about gravity</p>
<p>with other things we know about physics.</p>
<p>And can you find a theory where these fit together</p>
<p>in a way that makes sense and hopefully predict something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much more promising.</p>
<p>Well, it makes sense and hopefully,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ll sneak up onto this question a bunch of times</p>
<p>because you kind of said a few slightly contradictory things</p>
<p>which is like, it&rsquo;s nice to have a theory that&rsquo;s consistent,</p>
<p>but then if the theory is consistent,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean anything.</p>
<p>So like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough, it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough and that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it keeps coming back to,</p>
<p>okay, there should be some experimental validation.</p>
<p>So, okay, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about strength theory.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a bit of an outspoken critic of strength theory.</p>
<p>Maybe one question first to ask is what is strength theory?</p>
<p>And beyond that, why is it wrong?</p>
<p>Or rather as the title of your blog says, not even wrong.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, one interesting thing</p>
<p>about the current state of strength theory is that,</p>
<p>I think it, I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s actually very, very difficult</p>
<p>to at this point to say what strength theory means.</p>
<p>If people say they&rsquo;re a strength theorist,</p>
<p>what they mean and what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is kind of hard to pin down the meaning of the term.</p>
<p>But the initial meaning I think goes back to,</p>
<p>there was kind of a series of developments starting in 1984</p>
<p>in which people felt that they had found a unified theory</p>
<p>of our so called standard model of all the standard,</p>
<p>well known kind of particle interactions and gravity</p>
<p>and it all fit together in a quantum theory.</p>
<p>And that you could do this in a very specific way</p>
<p>by instead of thinking about having a quantum theory</p>
<p>of particles moving around in space time,</p>
<p>think about a quantum theory of kind of one dimensional</p>
<p>loops moving around in space time, so called strings.</p>
<p>And so instead of one degree of freedom,</p>
<p>these have an infinite number of degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a much more complicated theory, but you can imagine,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna quantize this theory of loops</p>
<p>moving around in space time.</p>
<p>And what they found is that you could do this</p>
<p>and you could fairly, relatively straightforwardly</p>
<p>make sense of such a quantum theory,</p>
<p>but only if space and time together were 10 dimensional.</p>
<p>And so then you had this problem,</p>
<p>again, the problem I referred to at the beginning of,</p>
<p>okay, now once you make that move,</p>
<p>you gotta get rid of six dimensions.</p>
<p>And so the hope was that you could get rid</p>
<p>of the six dimensions by making them very small</p>
<p>and that consistency of the theory would require</p>
<p>that these six dimensions satisfy a very specific condition</p>
<p>called being a Calabi out manifold.</p>
<p>And that we knew very, very few examples of this.</p>
<p>So what got a lot of people very excited back in 84, 85</p>
<p>was the hope that you could just take</p>
<p>this 10 dimensional string theory</p>
<p>and find one of a limited number of possible ways</p>
<p>of getting rid of six dimensions by making them small</p>
<p>and then you would end up with an effective</p>
<p>four dimensional theory, which looked like the real world.</p>
<p>This was the hope.</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;s then a very long story</p>
<p>about what happened to that hope over the years.</p>
<p>I would argue and part of the point of the book</p>
<p>and its title was that this ultimately was a failure</p>
<p>that you ended up, that this idea just didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there ended up being just too many ways of doing this</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t know how to do this consistently,</p>
<p>that it was kind of not even wrong in the sense</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t even, you never could pin it down</p>
<p>well enough to actually get a real falsifiable prediction</p>
<p>out of it that would tell you it was wrong.</p>
<p>But it was kind of in the realm of ideas</p>
<p>which initially looked good, but the more you look at them,</p>
<p>they just, they don&rsquo;t work out the way you want</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t actually end up carrying the power</p>
<p>or that you originally had this vision of.</p>
<p>And yes, the book title is not even wrong.</p>
<p>Your blog, your excellent blog title is not even wrong.</p>
<p>Okay, but there&rsquo;s nevertheless been a lot of excitement</p>
<p>about string theory through the decades, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>What are the different flavors of ideas that came,</p>
<p>like that branched out?</p>
<p>You mentioned 10 dimensions.</p>
<p>You mentioned loops with infinite degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>What other interesting ideas to you</p>
<p>that kind of emerged from this world?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, the problem</p>
<p>with talking about the whole subject</p>
<p>and part of the reason I wrote the book</p>
<p>is that it gets very, very complicated.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a huge amount,</p>
<p>a lot of people got very interested in this,</p>
<p>a lot of people worked on it.</p>
<p>And in some sense, I think what happened</p>
<p>is exactly because the idea didn&rsquo;t really work</p>
<p>that this caused people to,</p>
<p>instead of focusing on this one idea</p>
<p>and digging in and working on that,</p>
<p>they just kind of kept trying new things.</p>
<p>And so people, I think, ended up wandering around</p>
<p>in a very, very rich space of ideas</p>
<p>about mathematics and physics</p>
<p>and discovering all sorts of really interesting things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the problem is there tended</p>
<p>to be an inverse relationship</p>
<p>between how interesting and beautiful and fruitful</p>
<p>this new idea that they were trying to pursue was</p>
<p>and how much it looked like the real world.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of beautiful mathematics came out of it.</p>
<p>I think one of the most spectacular</p>
<p>is what the physicists call</p>
<p>two dimensional conformal field theory.</p>
<p>And so these are basically quantum field theories</p>
<p>and kind of think of it as one space</p>
<p>and one time dimension,</p>
<p>which have just this huge amount of symmetry</p>
<p>and a huge amount of structure,</p>
<p>which there&rsquo;s some totally fantastic mathematics behind it.</p>
<p>And again, and some of that mathematics</p>
<p>is exactly also what appears in the Langlands program.</p>
<p>So a lot of the first interaction between math and physics</p>
<p>around the Langlands program has been</p>
<p>around these two dimensional conformal field theories.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say</p>
<p>about what are the major problems are with string theory?</p>
<p>So like, besides that there&rsquo;s no experimental validation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written that a big hole in string theory</p>
<p>has been its perturbative definition.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s one, can you explain what that means?</p>
<p>Well, maybe to begin with,</p>
<p>I think the simplest thing to say is,</p>
<p>the initial idea really was that,</p>
<p>okay, we have this, instead of what&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>is we have this thing that only works,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very structured and has to work in a certain way</p>
<p>for it to make sense.</p>
<p>But then you ended up in 10 space time dimensions.</p>
<p>And so to get back to physics,</p>
<p>you had to get rid of five of the dimensions,</p>
<p>six of the dimensions.</p>
<p>And the bottom line I would say in some sense is very simple</p>
<p>that what people just discovered is just,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of no particularly nice way of doing this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an infinite number of ways of doing it</p>
<p>and you can get whatever you want</p>
<p>depending on how you do it.</p>
<p>So you end up the whole program of starting at 10 dimensions</p>
<p>and getting to four just kind of collapses</p>
<p>out of a lack of any way to kind of get to where you want</p>
<p>because you can get anything.</p>
<p>The hope around that problem has always been</p>
<p>that the standard formulation that we have of string theory,</p>
<p>which is, you can go by the name perturbative,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of, there&rsquo;s a standard way we know</p>
<p>of given a classical theory of constructing a quantum theory</p>
<p>and working with it, which is the so called</p>
<p>perturbation theory that we know how to do.</p>
<p>And that by itself just doesn&rsquo;t give you any hint</p>
<p>as to what to do about the six dimensions.</p>
<p>So actual perturbed string theory by itself</p>
<p>really only works in 10 dimensions.</p>
<p>So you have to start making some kinds of assumptions</p>
<p>about how I&rsquo;m gonna go beyond this formulation</p>
<p>that we really understand of string theory</p>
<p>and get rid of these six dimensions.</p>
<p>So kind of the simplest one was the Klabiau postulate,</p>
<p>but when that didn&rsquo;t really work out,</p>
<p>people have tried more and more different things.</p>
<p>And the hope has always been that the solution,</p>
<p>this problem would be that you would find a deeper</p>
<p>and better understanding of what string theory is</p>
<p>that would actually go beyond this perturbative expansion</p>
<p>and which would generalize this.</p>
<p>And that once you had that, it would solve this problem of,</p>
<p>it would pick out what to do with the six dimensions.</p>
<p>How difficult is this problem?</p>
<p>So if I could restate the problem,</p>
<p>it seems like there&rsquo;s a very consistent physical world</p>
<p>operating in four dimensions.</p>
<p>And how do you map a consistent physical world</p>
<p>in 10 dimensions to a consistent physical world</p>
<p>in four dimensions?</p>
<p>And how difficult is this problem?</p>
<p>Is that something you can even answer?</p>
<p>Just in terms of physics intuition,</p>
<p>in terms of mathematics,</p>
<p>mapping from 10 dimensions to four dimensions.</p>
<p>Well, basically, I mean, you have to get rid</p>
<p>of the six of the dimensions.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of two ways of doing it.</p>
<p>One is what we called compactification.</p>
<p>You say that there really are 10 dimensions,</p>
<p>but for whatever reason,</p>
<p>six of them are so, so small, we can&rsquo;t see them.</p>
<p>So you basically start out with 10 dimensions</p>
<p>and what we call, make six of them not go out to infinity,</p>
<p>but just kind of a finite extent</p>
<p>and then make that size go down so small, it&rsquo;s unobservable.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s a math trick.</p>
<p>So can you also help me build an intuition</p>
<p>about how rich and interesting the world</p>
<p>in those six dimensions is?</p>
<p>So compactification seems to imply&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not very interesting.</p>
<p>Well, no, but the problem is that what you learn</p>
<p>if you start doing mathematics</p>
<p>and looking at geometry and topology</p>
<p>and more and more dimensions is that,</p>
<p>I mean, asking the question like,</p>
<p>what are all possible six dimensional spaces?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s kind of an unnatural question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even kind of technically undecidable in some way.</p>
<p>There are too many things you can do with all these,</p>
<p>if you start trying to make,</p>
<p>if you start trying to make one dimensional spaces,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, you got a line, you can make a circle,</p>
<p>you can make graphs, you can kind of see what you can do.</p>
<p>But as you go to higher and higher dimensions,</p>
<p>there are just so many ways you can put things together</p>
<p>of and get something of that dimensionality.</p>
<p>And so unless you have some very, very strong principle,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just gonna pick out some very specific ones</p>
<p>of these six dimensional spaces.</p>
<p>And there are just too many of them</p>
<p>and you can get anything you want.</p>
<p>So if you have 10 dimensions,</p>
<p>the kind of things that happen,</p>
<p>say that&rsquo;s actually the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually the fabric of our reality is 10 dimensions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a limited set of behaviors of objects.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know even know what the right terminology</p>
<p>to use that can occur within those dimensions,</p>
<p>like in reality.</p>
<p>And so like what I&rsquo;m getting at is like,</p>
<p>is there some consistent constraints?</p>
<p>So if you have some constraints that map to reality,</p>
<p>then you can start saying like,</p>
<p>dimension number seven is kind of boring.</p>
<p>All the excitement happens in the spatial dimensions,</p>
<p>one, two, three.</p>
<p>And time is also kind of boring.</p>
<p>And like some are more exciting than others,</p>
<p>or we can use our metric of beauty.</p>
<p>Some dimensions are more beautiful than others.</p>
<p>Once you have an actual understanding</p>
<p>of what actually happens in those dimensions</p>
<p>in our physical world,</p>
<p>as opposed to sort of all the possible things</p>
<p>that could happen.</p>
<p>In some sense, I mean,</p>
<p>just the basic fact is you need to get rid of them.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see them.</p>
<p>So you need to somehow explain them.</p>
<p>The main thing you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is to explain why we&rsquo;re not seeing them.</p>
<p>And so you have to come up with some theory</p>
<p>of these extra dimensions and how they&rsquo;re gonna behave.</p>
<p>And string theory gives you some ideas</p>
<p>about how to do that.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is where you&rsquo;re trying to go</p>
<p>with this whole theory you&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>is to just make all of its effects essentially unobservable.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an inherently kind of dubious and worrisome thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to do there.</p>
<p>Why are you just adding in all this stuff</p>
<p>and then trying to explain why we don&rsquo;t see it?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>This may be a dumb question,</p>
<p>but is this an obvious thing to state</p>
<p>that those six dimensions are unobservable</p>
<p>or anything beyond four dimensions is unobservable?</p>
<p>Or do you leave a little door open</p>
<p>to saying the current tools of physics,</p>
<p>and obviously our brains aren&rsquo;t unable to observe them,</p>
<p>but we may need to come up with methodologies</p>
<p>for observing them.</p>
<p>So as opposed to collapsing your mathematical theory</p>
<p>into four dimensions,</p>
<p>leaving the door open a little bit too,</p>
<p>maybe we need to come up with tools</p>
<p>that actually allow us to directly measure those dimensions.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, you can certainly ask,</p>
<p>assume that we&rsquo;ve got model,</p>
<p>look at models with more dimensions and ask,</p>
<p>what would the observable effects, how would we know this?</p>
<p>And you go out and do experiments.</p>
<p>So for instance, you have a,</p>
<p>like gravitationally you have an inverse square law of forces.</p>
<p>If you had more dimensions,</p>
<p>that inverse square law would change to something else.</p>
<p>So you can go and start measuring the inverse square law</p>
<p>and say, okay, inverse square law is working,</p>
<p>but maybe if I get,</p>
<p>and it turns out to be actually kind of very, very hard</p>
<p>to measure gravitational effects</p>
<p>and even kind of somewhat macroscopic distances</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so small.</p>
<p>So you can start looking at the inverse square law</p>
<p>and say, start trying to measure it</p>
<p>at shorter and shorter distances</p>
<p>and see if there were extra dimensions</p>
<p>at those distance scales,</p>
<p>you would start to see the inverse square law fail.</p>
<p>And so people look for that and again, you don&rsquo;t see it,</p>
<p>but you can, I mean, there&rsquo;s all sorts of experiments</p>
<p>of this kind you can imagine which test</p>
<p>for effects of extra dimensions</p>
<p>at different distance scales, but none of them,</p>
<p>I mean, they all just don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Nothing yet.</p>
<p>Nothing yet, but you could say, ah, but it&rsquo;s just much,</p>
<p>much smaller, you can say that.</p>
<p>Which by the way makes LIGO</p>
<p>and the detection of gravitational waves</p>
<p>quite an incredible project.</p>
<p>Ed Witten is often brought up</p>
<p>as one of the most brilliant mathematicians</p>
<p>and physicists ever.</p>
<p>What do you make of him and his work on string theory?</p>
<p>Well, I think he&rsquo;s a truly remarkable figure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of meeting him first</p>
<p>when he was a postdoc.</p>
<p>And I mean, he&rsquo;s just completely amazing</p>
<p>mathematician and physicist.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s quite a bit smarter</p>
<p>than just about any of the rest of us</p>
<p>and also more hardworking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of frightening combination</p>
<p>to see how much he&rsquo;s been able to do.</p>
<p>But I would actually argue that his greatest work,</p>
<p>the things that he&rsquo;s done that have been of</p>
<p>just this mind blowing significance of giving us,</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s completely revolutionized</p>
<p>some areas of mathematics.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s totally revolutionized the way we understand</p>
<p>the relations between mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>And most of those, his greatest work</p>
<p>is stuff that has little or nothing</p>
<p>to do with string theory.</p>
<p>I mean, for instance, so he was actually one of Fields.</p>
<p>The very strange thing about him in some sense</p>
<p>is that he doesn&rsquo;t have a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very large number of people</p>
<p>who are nowhere near as smart as he is</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t work anywhere near as hard</p>
<p>who have Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p>I think he just had the misfortune</p>
<p>of coming into the field at a time</p>
<p>when things had gotten much, much, much tougher</p>
<p>and nobody really had, no matter how smart you were,</p>
<p>it was very hard to come up with a new idea</p>
<p>that was gonna work physically and get you a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>But he got a Fields Medal for a certain work he did</p>
<p>in mathematics, and that&rsquo;s just completely unheard of.</p>
<p>For mathematicians to give a Fields Medal</p>
<p>to someone outside their field in physics</p>
<p>is really, you wouldn&rsquo;t have, before he came around,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody would have thought</p>
<p>that was even conceivable.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying he came into the field</p>
<p>of theoretical physics at a time when,</p>
<p>and still to today, is you can&rsquo;t get a Nobel Prize</p>
<p>for purely theoretical work.</p>
<p>The specific problem of trying to do better</p>
<p>than the standard, the standard model</p>
<p>is just this insanely successful thing,</p>
<p>and it kind of came together in 1973, pretty much.</p>
<p>And all of the people who kind of were involved</p>
<p>in that coming together, many of them ended up</p>
<p>with Nobel Prizes for that.</p>
<p>But if you look post 1973, pretty much,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit more, there&rsquo;s some edge cases,</p>
<p>if you like, but if you look post 1973</p>
<p>at what people have done to try to do better</p>
<p>than the standard model and to get a better idea,</p>
<p>it really hasn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s been too hard a problem.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t worked.</p>
<p>The theory&rsquo;s too good.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not that other people went out there</p>
<p>and did it, and not him, and that they got Nobel Prizes</p>
<p>for doing it, it&rsquo;s just that no one really,</p>
<p>the kind of thing he&rsquo;s been trying to do</p>
<p>with string theory is not, no one has been able to do</p>
<p>since 1973.</p>
<p>Is there something you can say about the standard model,</p>
<p>so the four laws of physics that seems to work very well,</p>
<p>and yet people are striving to do more?</p>
<p>Talking about unification, so on, why?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong, what&rsquo;s broken about the standard model?</p>
<p>Why does it need to be improved?</p>
<p>I mean, the thing that&rsquo;s gets most attention</p>
<p>is gravity, that we have trouble.</p>
<p>So you want to, in some sense, integrate what we know</p>
<p>about the gravitational force with it</p>
<p>and have a unified quantum field theory</p>
<p>that has gravitational interactions also.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the big problem everybody talks about.</p>
<p>I mean, but it&rsquo;s also true that if you look</p>
<p>at the standard model, it has these very, very deep,</p>
<p>beautiful ideas, but there&rsquo;s certain aspects of it</p>
<p>that are very, let&rsquo;s just say that they&rsquo;re not beautiful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, you have to, to make the thing work,</p>
<p>you have to throw in lots and lots of extra parameters</p>
<p>at various points, and a lot of this has to do</p>
<p>with the so called Higgs mechanism and the Higgs field,</p>
<p>that if you look at the theory, it&rsquo;s everything is,</p>
<p>if you forget about the Higgs field and what it needs to do,</p>
<p>the rest of the theory is very, very constrained</p>
<p>and has very, very few free parameters,</p>
<p>really a very small number.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very small number of parameters</p>
<p>and a few integers which tell you what the theory is.</p>
<p>To make this work as a theory of the real world,</p>
<p>you need a Higgs field and you need to,</p>
<p>it needs to do something.</p>
<p>And once you introduce that Higgs field,</p>
<p>all sorts of parameters make an appearance.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve got 20 or 30 or whatever parameters</p>
<p>that are gonna tell you what all the masses of things are</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve gone from a very tightly constrained thing</p>
<p>with a couple of parameters to this thing,</p>
<p>which the minute you put it in,</p>
<p>you had to add all this extra,</p>
<p>all these extra parameters to make things work.</p>
<p>And so that, it may be one argument as well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the way the world is,</p>
<p>and the fact that you don&rsquo;t find that aesthetically pleasing</p>
<p>is just your problem, or maybe we live in a multiverse</p>
<p>and those numbers are just different in every universe.</p>
<p>But another reasonable conjecture is just that,</p>
<p>well, this is just telling us that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand about what&rsquo;s going on in a deeper way,</p>
<p>which would explain those numbers.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some kind of deeper idea</p>
<p>about where the Higgs field comes from and what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>which we haven&rsquo;t figured out yet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we should look for.</p>
<p>But to stick on string theory a little bit longer,</p>
<p>could you play devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>and try to argue for string theory,</p>
<p>why it is something that deserved the effort that it got,</p>
<p>and still, like if you think of it as a flame,</p>
<p>still should be a little flame that keeps burning?</p>
<p>Well, I think the, I mean, the most positive argument</p>
<p>for it is all sorts of new ideas about mathematics</p>
<p>and about parts of physics really emerge from it.</p>
<p>That was very a fruitful source of ideas.</p>
<p>And I think this is actually one argument you&rsquo;ll definitely,</p>
<p>which I kind of agree with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hear from Whitten and from other string theorists,</p>
<p>say that this is just such a fruitful and inspiring idea</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s led to so many other different things</p>
<p>coming out of it that there must be something</p>
<p>right about this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, okay, anyway, I think that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>the strongest thing that they&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s aspects to it</p>
<p>that could be neighboring to a theory</p>
<p>that does unify everything, to a theory of everything.</p>
<p>Like it could, it may not be exactly,</p>
<p>exactly the theory, but sticking on it longer</p>
<p>might get us closer to the theory of everything.</p>
<p>Well, the problem with it now really</p>
<p>is that you really don&rsquo;t know what it is now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never, nobody has ever kind of come up</p>
<p>with this nonperturbative theory.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s become more and more frustrating</p>
<p>and an odd activity to try to argue with a string theorist</p>
<p>about string theory because it&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>less and less well defined what it is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s become actually more and more kind of a,</p>
<p>whether you have this weird phenomenon</p>
<p>of people calling themselves string theorists</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve never actually worked on any theory</p>
<p>where there are any strings anywhere.</p>
<p>So what has actually happened kind of sociologically</p>
<p>is that you started out with this</p>
<p>fairly well defined proposal.</p>
<p>And then I would argue because that didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>people branched out in all sorts of directions</p>
<p>doing all sorts of things.</p>
<p>It became farther and farther removed from that.</p>
<p>And for sociological reasons,</p>
<p>the ones who kind of started out or now</p>
<p>or were trained by the people who worked on that</p>
<p>have now become this string theorists.</p>
<p>And, but it&rsquo;s becoming almost more</p>
<p>kind of a tribal denominator than a,</p>
<p>I think so it&rsquo;s very hard to know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re arguing about</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re arguing about string theory these days.</p>
<p>Well, to push back on that a little bit,</p>
<p>I mean, string theory is just a term, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, like you could,</p>
<p>like this is the way language evolves</p>
<p>is it could start to represent something</p>
<p>more than just the theory that involves strings.</p>
<p>It could represent the effort to unify the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>At high dimensions with these super tiny objects, right?</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p>
<p>I mean, we can sort of put string theory aside.</p>
<p>So for example, neural networks</p>
<p>in the space of machine learning,</p>
<p>there was a time when they were extremely popular.</p>
<p>They became much, much less popular</p>
<p>to a point where if you mentioned neural networks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting no funding</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not going to be respected at conferences.</p>
<p>And then once again,</p>
<p>neural networks became all the rage</p>
<p>about 10, 15 years ago.</p>
<p>And as it goes up and down</p>
<p>and a lot of people would argue</p>
<p>that using terminology like machine learning</p>
<p>and deep learning is often misused over general,</p>
<p>everything that works is deep learning,</p>
<p>everything that doesn&rsquo;t, isn&rsquo;t something like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way,</p>
<p>again, we&rsquo;re back to sociological things,</p>
<p>but I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to get at is</p>
<p>if we leave the sociological mess aside,</p>
<p>do we throw out the baby with the bathwater?</p>
<p>Is there some, besides the side effects of nice ideas</p>
<p>from the Ed Wittons of the world,</p>
<p>is there some core truths there that we should stick by</p>
<p>in the full beautiful mess of a space</p>
<p>that we call string theory,</p>
<p>that people call string theory?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, it is kind of a common problem</p>
<p>that how what you call some field changes and evolves</p>
<p>and in interesting ways as the field changes.</p>
<p>But I mean, I guess what I would argue</p>
<p>is the initial understanding of string theory</p>
<p>that was quite specific,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about a specific idea,</p>
<p>10 dimensional super strings</p>
<p>compactified to six dimensions.</p>
<p>That to my mind, the really bad thing has happened</p>
<p>to the subject is that it&rsquo;s hard to get people to admit,</p>
<p>at least publicly, that that was a failure,</p>
<p>that this really didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And so de facto, what people do is people stop doing that</p>
<p>and they start doing more interesting things,</p>
<p>but they keep talking to the public about string theory</p>
<p>and referring back to that idea</p>
<p>and using that as kind of the starting point</p>
<p>and as kind of the place where the whole tribe starts</p>
<p>and everything else comes from.</p>
<p>So the problem with this is that having as your initial name</p>
<p>and what everything points back to,</p>
<p>something which really didn&rsquo;t work out,</p>
<p>it kind of makes everybody, it makes everything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve created this potentially very, very interesting field</p>
<p>with interesting things happening,</p>
<p>but people in graduate school take courses</p>
<p>on string theory and everything kind of,</p>
<p>and this is what you tell the public</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re continually pointing back.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re continually pointing back to this idea</p>
<p>which never worked out as your guiding inspiration.</p>
<p>And it really kind of deforms your whole way</p>
<p>of your hopes of making progress.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, to me, I think the kind of worst thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happened in this field.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, so there&rsquo;s a lack of transparency, sort of authenticity</p>
<p>about communicating the things that failed in the past.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t have a clear picture of like firm ground</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re standing on.</p>
<p>But again, those are sociological things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of questions I want to ask you.</p>
<p>So one, what&rsquo;s your intuition about why the original idea failed?</p>
<p>So what can you say about why you&rsquo;re pretty sure it has failed?</p>
<p>I mean, the initial idea was, as I try to explain it,</p>
<p>it was quite seductive in that you could see why Whitten</p>
<p>and others got excited by it.</p>
<p>It was, you know, at the time it looked like there were only</p>
<p>a few of these possible clobby owls that would work.</p>
<p>And it looked like, okay, we just have to understand</p>
<p>this very specific model and these very specific</p>
<p>six dimensional spaces, and we&rsquo;re going to get everything.</p>
<p>And so it was a very seductive idea, but it just, you know,</p>
<p>as people learned, worked more and more about it,</p>
<p>it just didn&rsquo;t, they just kind of realized that there are just</p>
<p>more and more things you can do with these six dimensions</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t, and this is just not going to work.</p>
<p>Meaning like, it&rsquo;s, I mean, what was the failure mode here?</p>
<p>Is it, you could just have an infinite number of possibilities</p>
<p>that you could do so you can come up with any theory you want,</p>
<p>you can fit quantum mechanics, you can explain gravity,</p>
<p>you can explain anything you want with it.</p>
<p>Is that the basic failure mode?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a failure mode of kind of that this idea</p>
<p>ended up being kind of being essentially empty,</p>
<p>that it just doesn&rsquo;t, ends up not telling you anything</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s consistent with just about anything.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, there&rsquo;s a complex, if you try and talk</p>
<p>with string theorists about this now, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an argument, there&rsquo;s a long argument over this</p>
<p>about whether, oh no, no, no, maybe there still are</p>
<p>constraints coming out of this idea or not.</p>
<p>Or maybe we live in a multiverse and everything is true</p>
<p>anyway, so you can, there are various ways you can kind of,</p>
<p>that string theorists have kind of react to this kind of</p>
<p>argument that I&rsquo;m making, but I try to hold onto it.</p>
<p>What about experimental validation?</p>
<p>Is that a fair standard to hold before a theory</p>
<p>of everything that&rsquo;s trying to unify</p>
<p>quantum mechanics and gravity?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, ultimately, to be really convinced</p>
<p>that some new idea about unification really works,</p>
<p>you need some kind of, you need to look at the real world</p>
<p>and see that this is telling you something true about it.</p>
<p>I mean, either telling you that if you do some experiment</p>
<p>and go out and do it, you&rsquo;ll get some unexpected result</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the kind of gold standard, or it may be just that</p>
<p>like all those numbers that are,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know how to explain,</p>
<p>it will show you how to calculate them.</p>
<p>I mean, it can be various kinds of experimental validation,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s certainly ideally what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>How tough is this, do you think, for a theory of everything,</p>
<p>not just string theory, for something that unifies</p>
<p>gravity and quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>so the very big and the very small?</p>
<p>Is this, let me ask you one way,</p>
<p>is it a physics problem, a math problem,</p>
<p>or an engineering problem?</p>
<p>My guess is it&rsquo;s a combination of a physics</p>
<p>and a math problem that you really need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really engineering, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s some kind</p>
<p>of well defined thing you can write down</p>
<p>and we just don&rsquo;t have enough computer power</p>
<p>to do the calculation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the kind of problem it is at all.</p>
<p>But the question is, what mathematical tools you need</p>
<p>to properly formulate the problem is unclear.</p>
<p>So one reasonable conjecture is the way,</p>
<p>the reason that we haven&rsquo;t had any success yet</p>
<p>is just that we&rsquo;re missing,</p>
<p>either we&rsquo;re missing certain physical ideas</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re missing certain mathematical tools,</p>
<p>which there are some combination of them,</p>
<p>which we need to kind of properly formulate the problem</p>
<p>and see that it has a solution</p>
<p>that looks like the real world.</p>
<p>But those you need, I guess you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a sense that you need both gravity,</p>
<p>like all the laws of physics to be operating</p>
<p>on the same level.</p>
<p>So it feels like you need an object like a black hole</p>
<p>or something like that in order to make predictions about.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;re always making predictions</p>
<p>about this joint phenomena or can you do that</p>
<p>as long as the theory is consistent</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t have special cases for each of the phenomena?</p>
<p>Well, your theory should, I mean,</p>
<p>if your theory is gonna include gravity,</p>
<p>our current understanding of gravity</p>
<p>is that you should have,</p>
<p>there should be black hole states in it.</p>
<p>You should be able to describe black holes in this theory.</p>
<p>And just one aspect that people have concentrated a lot on</p>
<p>is just this kind of questions about</p>
<p>if your theory includes black holes like it&rsquo;s supposed to</p>
<p>and it includes quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s certain kinds of paradoxes which come up.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s been a huge focus of kind of</p>
<p>quantum gravity work has been just those paradoxes.</p>
<p>So stepping outside of string theory,</p>
<p>can you just say first at a high level,</p>
<p>what is the theory of everything?</p>
<p>What is the theory of everything seek to accomplish?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, this is very much a kind of reductionist</p>
<p>point of view in the sense that, so it&rsquo;s not a theory.</p>
<p>This is not gonna explain to you anything.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really, this kind of theory,</p>
<p>this kind of theory of everything we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t say anything interesting,</p>
<p>particularly about like macroscopic objects,</p>
<p>about what the weather is gonna be tomorrow,</p>
<p>or things are happening at this scale.</p>
<p>But just what we&rsquo;ve discovered is that</p>
<p>as you look at the universe that kind of,</p>
<p>if you kind of start, you can start breaking it apart</p>
<p>into, and you end up with some fairly simple pieces,</p>
<p>quanta, if you like, and which are doing,</p>
<p>which are interacting in some fairly simple way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, so what we mean by theory of everything is</p>
<p>a theory that describes all the object,</p>
<p>all the correct objects you need to describe</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in the world and describes how</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re interacting with each other</p>
<p>at our most fundamental level.</p>
<p>How you get from that theory to describing some macroscopic,</p>
<p>incredibly complicated thing is,</p>
<p>there that becomes, again, more of an engineering problem</p>
<p>and you may need machine learning,</p>
<p>or you may, you know, a lot of very different things</p>
<p>to do it, but.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s just engineering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also science.</p>
<p>One thing that I find kind of interesting</p>
<p>talking to physicists is a little bit, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>a little bit of hubris.</p>
<p>Some of the most brilliant people I know are physicists,</p>
<p>both philosophy and just in terms of mathematics,</p>
<p>in terms of understanding the world.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a kind of either hubris or what would I call it?</p>
<p>Like a confidence that if we have a theory of everything,</p>
<p>we will understand everything.</p>
<p>Like this is the deepest thing to understand.</p>
<p>And I would say, and like the rest is details, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the old Rutherford thing.</p>
<p>But to me, there&rsquo;s like, this is like a cake or something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s layers to this thing</p>
<p>and each one has a theory of everything.</p>
<p>Like at every level from biology,</p>
<p>like how life originates, that itself,</p>
<p>like complex systems.</p>
<p>Like that in itself is like this gigantic thing</p>
<p>that requires a theory of everything.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the, in the space of humans,</p>
<p>psychology, like intelligence, collective intelligence,</p>
<p>the way it emerges among species,</p>
<p>that feels like a complex system</p>
<p>that requires its own theory of everything.</p>
<p>On top of that is things like in the computing space,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence systems,</p>
<p>like that feels like it needs a theory of everything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like once we solve,</p>
<p>once we come up with a theory of everything</p>
<p>that explains the basic laws of physics</p>
<p>that gave us the universe,</p>
<p>even stuff that&rsquo;s super complex,</p>
<p>like how the universe might be able to originate,</p>
<p>even explaining something that you&rsquo;re not a big fan of,</p>
<p>like multiverses or stuff</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have any evidence of yet.</p>
<p>Still, we won&rsquo;t be able to have a strong explanation</p>
<p>of why food tastes delicious.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>No, anyway, yeah, I agree completely.</p>
<p>I mean, there is something kind of completely wrong</p>
<p>with this terminology of theory of everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s really in some sense a very bad term,</p>
<p>very hubristic and bad terminology,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not, this is explaining,</p>
<p>this is a purely kind of reductionist point of view</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to understand</p>
<p>a certain very specific kind of things,</p>
<p>which in principle, other things emerge from,</p>
<p>but to actually understand how anything emerges from this</p>
<p>is, it can&rsquo;t be understood in terms of</p>
<p>this underlying fundamental theory is gonna be hopeless</p>
<p>in terms of kind of telling you what about this,</p>
<p>this various emergent behavior.</p>
<p>And as you go to different levels of explanation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need to develop new,</p>
<p>different, completely different ideas,</p>
<p>completely different ways of thinking.</p>
<p>And I guess there&rsquo;s a famous kind of Phil Anderson&rsquo;s slogan</p>
<p>is that, you know, more is different.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just, even once you understand how,</p>
<p>what a couple of things,</p>
<p>if you have a collection of stuff</p>
<p>and you understand perfectly well</p>
<p>how each thing is interacting with the others,</p>
<p>what the whole thing is gonna do</p>
<p>is just a completely different problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not, and you need completely different ways</p>
<p>of thinking about it.</p>
<p>What do you think about this?</p>
<p>I got to ask you at a few different attempts</p>
<p>that a theory of everything, especially recently.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been for many years,</p>
<p>a big fan of cellular automata of complex systems.</p>
<p>And obviously because of that,</p>
<p>a fan of Stephen Wolfram&rsquo;s work in that space,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s recently been talking about a theory of everything</p>
<p>through his physics project, essentially.</p>
<p>What do you think about this kind of discreet</p>
<p>theory of everything like from simple rules</p>
<p>and simple objects on the hypergraphs</p>
<p>emerges all of our reality where time and space are emergent.</p>
<p>Basically everything we see around us is emergent.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have to say, unfortunately,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of pretty much zero sympathy for that.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t, I spent a little time looking at it</p>
<p>and I just don&rsquo;t see, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to get anywhere.</p>
<p>And it really is just really, really doesn&rsquo;t agree at all</p>
<p>with what I&rsquo;m seeing,</p>
<p>this kind of unification of math and physics</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m kind of talking about around certain kinds</p>
<p>of very deep ideas about geometry and stuff.</p>
<p>This, if you want to believe that your things</p>
<p>are really coming out of cellular automata</p>
<p>at the most fundamental level,</p>
<p>you have to believe that everything that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>my whole career and as beautiful, powerful ideas,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s all just kind of a mirage,</p>
<p>which just kind of randomly is emerging</p>
<p>from these more basic, very, very simple minded things.</p>
<p>And you have to give me some serious evidence for that</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m seeing nothing.</p>
<p>So Mirage, you don&rsquo;t think there could be a consistency</p>
<p>where things like quantum mechanics could emerge</p>
<p>from much, much, much smaller, discreet,</p>
<p>like computational type systems.</p>
<p>I think from the point of view of certain mathematical</p>
<p>point of view, quantum mechanics is already mathematically</p>
<p>as simple as it gets.</p>
<p>It really is a story about really the fundamental objects</p>
<p>that you work within when you write down a quantum theory</p>
<p>are in some form point of view,</p>
<p>precisely the fundamental objects</p>
<p>at these deepest levels of mathematics</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working with, they&rsquo;re exactly the same.</p>
<p>So, and cellular automata are something completely different</p>
<p>which don&rsquo;t fit into these structures.</p>
<p>And so I just don&rsquo;t see why, anyway,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it as a promising thing to do.</p>
<p>And then just looking at it and saying,</p>
<p>does this go anywhere?</p>
<p>Does this solve any problem that I&rsquo;ve ever,</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t, does this solve any problem of any kind?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Yeah, to me, cellular automata and these hypergraphs,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure solving a problem is even the standard</p>
<p>to apply here at this moment.</p>
<p>To me, the fascinating thing is that the question it asks</p>
<p>have no good answers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not good math explaining,</p>
<p>forget the physics of it,</p>
<p>math explaining the behavior of complex systems.</p>
<p>And that to me is both exciting and paralyzing.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re at the very early days of understanding</p>
<p>how complicated and fascinating things emerge</p>
<p>from simple rules.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I agree.</p>
<p>I think that is a truly great problem.</p>
<p>And depending where it goes, it may be,</p>
<p>it may start to develop some kind of connections</p>
<p>to the things that I&rsquo;ve kind of found more fruitful</p>
<p>and hard to know.</p>
<p>It just, I think a lot of that area,</p>
<p>I kind of strongly feel I best not say too much about it</p>
<p>because I just, I don&rsquo;t know too much about it.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re back to this original problem</p>
<p>that your time in life is limited.</p>
<p>You have to figure out what you&rsquo;re gonna spend</p>
<p>your time thinking about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve just never seen enough</p>
<p>to convince me to spend more time thinking about.</p>
<p>Well, also timing, it&rsquo;s not just that our time is limited,</p>
<p>but the timing of the kind of things you think about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect to cellular automata,</p>
<p>these kinds of objects that it feels like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very many years away from having big breakthroughs on.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, you have to pick the problems</p>
<p>that are solvable today.</p>
<p>In fact, my intuition, again, perhaps biased,</p>
<p>is it feels like the kind of systems that,</p>
<p>complex systems that cellular automata are,</p>
<p>would not be solved by human brains.</p>
<p>It feels like something post human</p>
<p>that will solve that problem.</p>
<p>Or like significantly enhanced humans,</p>
<p>meaning like using computational tools,</p>
<p>very powerful computational tools to crack</p>
<p>these problems open.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s if our approach to science,</p>
<p>our ability to understand science, our ability</p>
<p>to understand physics will become more and more</p>
<p>computational, or there&rsquo;ll be a whole field</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s computational in nature,</p>
<p>which currently is not the case.</p>
<p>Currently, computation is the thing that sort of assists us</p>
<p>in understanding science the way we&rsquo;ve been doing it</p>
<p>all along, but if there&rsquo;s a whole new,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re from a new kind of science, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit dramatic, but you know,</p>
<p>if computers could do science on their own,</p>
<p>computational systems, perhaps that&rsquo;s the way</p>
<p>they would do the science.</p>
<p>They would try to understand the cellular automata,</p>
<p>and that feels like we&rsquo;re decades away.</p>
<p>So perhaps it&rsquo;ll crack open some interesting facets</p>
<p>of this physics problem, but it&rsquo;s very far away.</p>
<p>So timing is everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfectly possible, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you then, in the space of geometry,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how well you know Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>Oh, quite well, yeah.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about his geometric community</p>
<p>and the space of ideas that he&rsquo;s playing with</p>
<p>in his proposal for theory of everything?</p>
<p>Well, I think that he has, he fundamentally has,</p>
<p>I think, the same problems that everybody has had</p>
<p>trying to do this, and there are really versions</p>
<p>of the same problem that you try to get unity</p>
<p>by putting everything into some bigger structure.</p>
<p>So he has some other ones that are not so conventional</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s trying to work with,</p>
<p>but he has the same problem that even if he can,</p>
<p>if he can get a lot farther in terms of having</p>
<p>a really well defined, well understood,</p>
<p>clear picture of these things he&rsquo;s working with,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really kind of large geometrical structures</p>
<p>of many dimensions of many kinds,</p>
<p>and I just don&rsquo;t see any way,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna have the same problem the string theorists have,</p>
<p>how do you get back down to the structures</p>
<p>of the standard model, and how do you, yeah.</p>
<p>So I just, anyway, it&rsquo;s the same,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s another interesting example</p>
<p>of a similar kind of thing is Garrett Leasy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>theory of everything.</p>
<p>Again, there, it&rsquo;s a little bit more specific</p>
<p>than Eric&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s working with this E8,</p>
<p>but it, again, I think all these things found</p>
<p>are at the same point, that you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, you create this unity,</p>
<p>but then you have no, you don&rsquo;t actually have a good idea</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re gonna get back to the actual,</p>
<p>to the objects we&rsquo;ve seen, how are you gonna,</p>
<p>you create these big symmetries,</p>
<p>how are you gonna break them?</p>
<p>And, because we don&rsquo;t see those symmetries</p>
<p>in the real world, and so ultimately,</p>
<p>there would need to be a simple process</p>
<p>for collapsing it to four dimensions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to explain, well, yeah,</p>
<p>I forget in his case, but it&rsquo;s not just four dimensions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also these structures you see in the standard model,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s certain very small</p>
<p>dimensional groups of symmetries,</p>
<p>so called U1, SU2, and SU3, and the problem with,</p>
<p>and this has been a problem since the beginning,</p>
<p>almost immediately after 1973, about a year later,</p>
<p>two years later, people started talking about</p>
<p>grand unified theories, so you take the U1,</p>
<p>the SU2, and the SU3, and you put them together</p>
<p>into this bigger structure called SU5 or SO10,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re stuck with this problem that,</p>
<p>wait a minute, now how, why does the world not look,</p>
<p>why do I not see these SU5 symmetries in the world,</p>
<p>I only see these, and so, and I think, you know,</p>
<p>the kind of thing that Eric, and all of a sudden Garrett,</p>
<p>and lots of people who try to do it,</p>
<p>they all kind of found her in that same way,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have a good answer to that.</p>
<p>Are there lessons, ideas to be learned from theories</p>
<p>like that, from Garrett Leacy&rsquo;s, from Eric&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it depends, I have to confess,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked that closely at Eric&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, he explained this to me personally a few times,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve looked a bit at his paper, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>again, we&rsquo;re back to the problem</p>
<p>of a limited amount of time in life.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s an interesting effect, right?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t more physicists look at it?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m in this position that somehow,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, people write me emails, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve worked in the space of AI,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s a lot of people,</p>
<p>perhaps AI is even way more accessible than physics,</p>
<p>in a certain sense, and so a lot of people write to me</p>
<p>with different theories about what they have</p>
<p>for how to create general intelligence,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, again, a little bit of an excuse, I say to myself,</p>
<p>like, well, I only have a limited amount of time,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not investigating it,</p>
<p>but I wonder if there&rsquo;s ideas out there</p>
<p>that are still powerful, that are still fascinating,</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;m missing because I&rsquo;m dismissing them</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re outside of the sort of the usual process</p>
<p>of academic research.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, the same thing,</p>
<p>and pretty much every day in my email,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s got a theory or everything</p>
<p>about why all of what physicists are doing,</p>
<p>and perhaps the most disturbing thing I should say</p>
<p>about being a critic of string theory</p>
<p>is that when you realize who your fans are,</p>
<p>every day I hear from somebody who says,</p>
<p>oh, well, since you don&rsquo;t like string theory,</p>
<p>you must, of course, agree with me</p>
<p>that this is the right way to think about everything.</p>
<p>Oh, no, oh, no, and most of these are,</p>
<p>you quickly can see this person doesn&rsquo;t know very much</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a whole continuum to,</p>
<p>people who are quite serious physicists and mathematicians</p>
<p>who are making a fairly serious attempt</p>
<p>to try to do something, like Eric and Eric,</p>
<p>and then your problem is you do try to spend more time</p>
<p>looking at it and trying to figure out</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re really doing,</p>
<p>but then at some point you just realize,</p>
<p>wait a minute, for me to really, really understand</p>
<p>exactly what&rsquo;s going on here would just take time</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Yeah, it takes a long time, which is the nice thing about AI</p>
<p>is unlike the kind of physics we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>if your idea is good, that should quite naturally lead</p>
<p>to you being able to build a system that&rsquo;s intelligent.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to get approval from somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s saying you have a good idea here.</p>
<p>You can just utilize that idea in an engineer system,</p>
<p>like naturally leads to engineering.</p>
<p>With physics here, if you have a perfect theory</p>
<p>that explains everything, that still doesn&rsquo;t obviously lead</p>
<p>one, to scientific experiments that can validate</p>
<p>that theory, and two, to like trinkets you can build</p>
<p>and sell at a store for $5.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make money off of it.</p>
<p>So that makes it much more challenging.</p>
<p>Well, let me also ask you about something that you found,</p>
<p>especially recently appealing,</p>
<p>which is Roger Penrose&rsquo;s Twister theory.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What kind of questions might it allow us to answer?</p>
<p>What will the answers look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only in the last couple of years</p>
<p>that I really, really kind of come to really,</p>
<p>I think, to appreciate it and to see how to really,</p>
<p>I believe to see how to really do something with it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve gotten very excited about that</p>
<p>the last year or two.</p>
<p>I mean, one way of saying one idea of Twister theory</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a different way of thinking about</p>
<p>what space and time are and about what points</p>
<p>in space and time are, which is very interesting</p>
<p>that it only really works in four dimensions.</p>
<p>So four dimensions behaves very, very specially</p>
<p>unlike other dimensions.</p>
<p>And in four dimensions, there is a way of thinking</p>
<p>about space and time geometry,</p>
<p>as well as just thinking about points in space and time.</p>
<p>You can also think about different objects,</p>
<p>these so called twisters.</p>
<p>And then when you do that,</p>
<p>you end up with a kind of a really interesting insight</p>
<p>that you can formulate a theory,</p>
<p>and you can formulate a very,</p>
<p>take a standard theory that we formulate</p>
<p>in terms of points of space and time,</p>
<p>and you can reformulate in this Twister language.</p>
<p>And in this Twister language,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fundamental objects actually are more kind of the,</p>
<p>are actually spheres in some sense, kind of the light cone.</p>
<p>So maybe one way to say it,</p>
<p>which actually I think is really, is quite amazing.</p>
<p>If you ask yourself, what do we know about the world?</p>
<p>We have this idea that the world out there</p>
<p>is all these different points and these points of time.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s kind of a derived quantity.</p>
<p>What we really know about the world is when we open our eyes,</p>
<p>what do you see?</p>
<p>You see a sphere.</p>
<p>And that what you&rsquo;re looking at is you&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>a sphere is worth of light rays coming into your eyes.</p>
<p>And what Penrose says is that,</p>
<p>well, what a point in space time is, is that sphere,</p>
<p>that sphere of all the light rays coming in.</p>
<p>And he says, and you should formulate your,</p>
<p>instead of thinking about points,</p>
<p>you should think about the space of those spheres,</p>
<p>if you like, and formulate the degrees of freedom</p>
<p>as physics as living on those spheres, living on,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re kind of living on,</p>
<p>your degrees of freedom are living on light rays,</p>
<p>not on points.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very different way of thinking about physics.</p>
<p>And he and others working with him developed</p>
<p>a beautiful mathematical formulas</p>
<p>and a way to go back from forth between some aspects</p>
<p>of our standard way we write these things down</p>
<p>and work in the so called twister space.</p>
<p>And certain things worked out very well,</p>
<p>but they ended up, I think kind of stuck by the 80s or 90s</p>
<p>that they weren&rsquo;t a little bit like string theory</p>
<p>that they, by using these ideas about twisters,</p>
<p>they could develop them in different directions</p>
<p>and find all sorts of other interesting things,</p>
<p>but they were getting,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t finding any way of doing that</p>
<p>that brought them back to kind of new insights into physics.</p>
<p>And my own, I mean, what&rsquo;s kind of gotten me excited really</p>
<p>is what I think I have an idea about</p>
<p>that I think does actually work,</p>
<p>that goes more in that direction.</p>
<p>And I can go on about that endlessly</p>
<p>or talk a little bit about it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the, I think that&rsquo;s the one kind of easy</p>
<p>to explain insight about twister theory.</p>
<p>There are some more technical ones.</p>
<p>I should mean, I think it&rsquo;s also very convincing</p>
<p>what it tells you about spinners, for instance,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a more technical.</p>
<p>Well, first let&rsquo;s like linger on the spheres</p>
<p>and the light cones.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying twisted theory allows you to make</p>
<p>that the fundamental object with which you&rsquo;re operating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How that, I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>like philosophically that&rsquo;s weird and beautiful,</p>
<p>maybe because it maps,</p>
<p>it feels like it moves us so much closer</p>
<p>to the way human brains perceive reality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like our perception is like the content</p>
<p>of our perception is the fundamental object of reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very appealing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it mathematically powerful?</p>
<p>Is there something you can say,</p>
<p>can you say a little bit more about what the heck</p>
<p>that even means for,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s much easier to think about mathematically</p>
<p>like a point in space time.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be operating on the light cone?</p>
<p>It uses a kind of mathematics that&rsquo;s relative,</p>
<p>that kind of goes back to the 19th century</p>
<p>among mathematicians.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, anyway, it&rsquo;s a bit of a long story,</p>
<p>but one problem is that you have to start,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crucial that you think in terms of complex numbers</p>
<p>and not just real numbers.</p>
<p>And this, for most people, that makes it harder to,</p>
<p>for mathematicians, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>We love doing that.</p>
<p>But for most people, that makes it harder to think about.</p>
<p>I think perhaps the most,</p>
<p>the way that there is something you can say</p>
<p>very specifically about it in terms of spinners,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know if you want to,</p>
<p>I think at some point you want to talk, so maybe you can.</p>
<p>What are spinners?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with spinners,</p>
<p>because I think that if we can introduce that,</p>
<p>then I can say it.</p>
<p>By the way, twister is spelled with an O</p>
<p>and spinner is spelled with an O as well.</p>
<p>Yes, okay.</p>
<p>In case you want to Google it and look it up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very nice Wikipedia pages as a starting point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is a good starting point</p>
<p>for twister theory.</p>
<p>Well, one thing you say about Penrose,</p>
<p>I mean, Penrose is actually a very good writer</p>
<p>and also a very good draftsman.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a draftsman, to the extent this is visualizable,</p>
<p>he actually has done some very nice drawings.</p>
<p>So, I mean, almost any kind of expository thing</p>
<p>you can find him writing is a very good place to start.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a remarkable person.</p>
<p>But the, so spinners are something</p>
<p>that independently came out of mathematics</p>
<p>and out of physics.</p>
<p>And to say where they came out of physics,</p>
<p>I mean, what people realized when they started looking</p>
<p>at elementary particles like electrons or whatever,</p>
<p>that there seem to be some kind of doubling</p>
<p>of the degrees of freedom going on.</p>
<p>If you counted what was there in some sense</p>
<p>in the way you would expect it</p>
<p>and when you started doing quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and started looking at elementary particles,</p>
<p>there were seen to be two degrees of freedom,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not one.</p>
<p>And one way of seeing it was that if you put your electron</p>
<p>in a strong magnetic field and asked what was the energy</p>
<p>of it, instead of it having one energy,</p>
<p>it would have two energies, there&rsquo;d be two energy levels.</p>
<p>And as you increase magnetic field,</p>
<p>the splitting would increase.</p>
<p>So physicists kind of realized that, wait a minute.</p>
<p>So we thought when we were doing,</p>
<p>first started doing quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>that the way to describe particles was in terms</p>
<p>of wave functions and these wave functions</p>
<p>were complex to complex values.</p>
<p>Well, if we actually look at particles,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pairs of complex numbers.</p>
<p>So one of the kind of fundamental,</p>
<p>from the physics point of view,</p>
<p>the fundamental question is why are all our kind</p>
<p>of fundamental particles described</p>
<p>by pairs of complex numbers?</p>
<p>Just weird.</p>
<p>And then you can ask, well, what happens</p>
<p>if you like take an electron and rotate it?</p>
<p>So how do things move in this pair of complex numbers?</p>
<p>Well, now, if you go back to mathematics,</p>
<p>what had been understood in mathematics,</p>
<p>some years earlier, not that many years earlier,</p>
<p>was that if you ask very, very generally,</p>
<p>think about geometry of three dimensions and ask,</p>
<p>and if you think about things that are happening</p>
<p>in three dimensions in the standard way,</p>
<p>everything, the standard way of doing geometry,</p>
<p>everything is about vectors, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve taken any mathematics classes,</p>
<p>you probably see vectors at some point.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just triplets of numbers tell you</p>
<p>what a direction is or how far you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>in three dimensional space.</p>
<p>And most of everything we teach in most standard courses</p>
<p>in mathematics is about vectors</p>
<p>and things you build out of vectors.</p>
<p>So you express everything about geometry</p>
<p>in terms of vectors or how they&rsquo;re changing</p>
<p>or how you put two of them together</p>
<p>and get planes and whatever.</p>
<p>But what had been realized that,</p>
<p>Rianna, is that if you ask very, very generally,</p>
<p>what are the, if you have, what are the things</p>
<p>that you can kind of consistently think about rotating?</p>
<p>And so you ask a technical question,</p>
<p>what are the representations of the rotation group?</p>
<p>Well, you find that one answer is they&rsquo;re vectors</p>
<p>and everything you build out of vectors,</p>
<p>but then people found, but wait a minute,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also these other things,</p>
<p>which you can build out of vectors,</p>
<p>but which you can consistently rotate.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re described by pairs of complex numbers,</p>
<p>by two complex numbers.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the spinners also.</p>
<p>And to make a lot, and to make,</p>
<p>and you can think of spinners in some sense</p>
<p>as more fundamental than vectors</p>
<p>because you can build vectors out of spinners.</p>
<p>You can take two spinners and make a vector,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t, if you only have vectors,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get spinners.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re in some sense, there&rsquo;s some kind of level</p>
<p>of lower level of geometry beyond what we thought it was,</p>
<p>which was kind of spinner geometry.</p>
<p>And this is something which even to this day,</p>
<p>when we teach graduate courses in geometry,</p>
<p>we mostly don&rsquo;t talk about this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a bit hard to do correctly.</p>
<p>If you start with your whole setup is in terms of vectors,</p>
<p>describing things in terms of spinners</p>
<p>is a whole different ball game.</p>
<p>But anyway, it was just this amazing fact</p>
<p>that this kind of more fundamental piece of geometry,</p>
<p>spinners, and what we were actually seeing,</p>
<p>if you look at electron, are one and the same.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s kind of a mind blowing thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very counterintuitive.</p>
<p>What are some weird properties of spinners</p>
<p>that are counterintuitive?</p>
<p>That there are some things that they do,</p>
<p>for instance, if you rotate a spinner around 360 degrees,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t come back towards,</p>
<p>it becomes minus what it was.</p>
<p>Or, so it&rsquo;s, anyway, so the way rotations work,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of a funny sign</p>
<p>you have to keep track of in some sense.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re kind of too valued in another weird way.</p>
<p>But the fundamental problem is that it&rsquo;s just not,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re used to visualizing vectors,</p>
<p>you just, there&rsquo;s nothing you can do</p>
<p>visualizing in terms of vectors</p>
<p>that will ever give you a spinner.</p>
<p>It just is not gonna ever work.</p>
<p>As you were saying that I was visualizing a vector</p>
<p>walking along a Mobius strip,</p>
<p>and it ends up being upside down.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that doesn&rsquo;t really capture.</p>
<p>So, I mean, what really captures it?</p>
<p>The problem is that it&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>the simplest way to describe it</p>
<p>is in terms of two complex numbers.</p>
<p>And your problem with two complex numbers</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s four real numbers.</p>
<p>So your spinner kind of lies in a four dimensional space.</p>
<p>So you, that makes it hard to visualize.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s crucial that it&rsquo;s not just any four dimensions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s actually complex numbers.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really gonna use the fact that</p>
<p>these are two complex numbers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard to visualize.</p>
<p>But to get back to what I think is mind blowing</p>
<p>about twisters is that the,</p>
<p>another way of saying this idea about talking about spheres,</p>
<p>another way of saying the fundamental idea of twister theory</p>
<p>is in some sense, the fundamental idea of twister theory</p>
<p>is that a point is a two complex dimensional space.</p>
<p>So that every, and that it lives inside,</p>
<p>the space that it lies inside is twister space.</p>
<p>So in the simplest case, it&rsquo;s four,</p>
<p>twister space is four dimensional</p>
<p>and a point in space time</p>
<p>is a two complex dimensional subspace</p>
<p>of all the four complex dimensions.</p>
<p>And as you move around in space time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just moving, your planes are just moving around.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And that, but then the.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a plane in a four dimensional space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a plane.</p>
<p>Complex.</p>
<p>Complex plane.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s two complex dimensions in four complex.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But then to me, the mind blowing thing about this</p>
<p>is this then kind of tautologically answers the question</p>
<p>is what is a spinner?</p>
<p>Well, a spinner is a point.</p>
<p>I mean, the space of spinners at a point is the point.</p>
<p>In twister theory, the points are the complex two planes.</p>
<p>And you want me to, and you&rsquo;re asking what a spinner is.</p>
<p>Well, a spinner, the space of spinners is that two plane.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, just your whole definition</p>
<p>of what a point in space time was</p>
<p>just told you what a spinner was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re just, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we&rsquo;re trying to project that</p>
<p>into a three dimensional space</p>
<p>and trying to intuit, but you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the intuition becomes very difficult,</p>
<p>but from, if you don&rsquo;t, not using twister theory,</p>
<p>you have to kind of go through a certain</p>
<p>fairly complicated rigmarole to even describe spinners</p>
<p>to describe electrons.</p>
<p>Whereas using twister theory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just completely tautological.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just what you want to describe.</p>
<p>The electron is fundamentally the way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re describing the point in space time already.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just there, so.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope?</p>
<p>You mentioned that you found it appealing recently.</p>
<p>Is it just because of certain aspects</p>
<p>of its mathematical beauty,</p>
<p>or do you actually have a hope</p>
<p>that this might lead to a theory of everything?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I certainly do have such a hope</p>
<p>because what I&rsquo;ve found, I think the thing which I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>no one had really looked at from this point of view before</p>
<p>is, has to do with this question of how do you treat time</p>
<p>in your quantum theory?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s another long story</p>
<p>about how we do quantum theories</p>
<p>and about how we treat time in quantum theories,</p>
<p>which is a long story.</p>
<p>But the short version of it is that what people have found</p>
<p>when you try and write down a quantum theory,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s often a good idea to take your time coordinate,</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re using to your time coordinate,</p>
<p>and multiply it by the square root of minus one</p>
<p>and to make it purely imaginary.</p>
<p>And so all these formulas,</p>
<p>which you have in your standard theory,</p>
<p>if you do that to those,</p>
<p>I mean, those formulas have some very strange behavior</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of singular.</p>
<p>If you ask even some simple questions,</p>
<p>you have to take very delicate singular limits</p>
<p>in order to get the correct answer,</p>
<p>and you have to take them from the right direction,</p>
<p>otherwise it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Whereas if you just take time,</p>
<p>and if you just put a factor of square root of minus one,</p>
<p>wherever you see the time coordinate,</p>
<p>you end up with much simpler formulas,</p>
<p>which are much better behaved mathematically.</p>
<p>And what I hadn&rsquo;t really appreciated until fairly recently</p>
<p>is also how dramatically that changes</p>
<p>the whole structure of the theory.</p>
<p>You end up with a consistent way of talking</p>
<p>about these quantum theories,</p>
<p>but it has some very different flavor</p>
<p>and very different aspects that I hadn&rsquo;t really appreciated.</p>
<p>And in particular, the way symmetries act on it</p>
<p>is not at all what I originally had expected.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the new thing that I have,</p>
<p>or I think gives you something,</p>
<p>is to do this move,</p>
<p>which people often think of as just kind of a mathematical</p>
<p>trick that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to make some formulas work out nicely,</p>
<p>but to take that mathematical trick as really fundamental.</p>
<p>And it turns out in Twister theory</p>
<p>allows you to simultaneously talk about your usual time</p>
<p>and the time times the square root of minus one,</p>
<p>they both fit very nicely into Twister theory.</p>
<p>And you end up with some structures</p>
<p>which look a lot like the standard models.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about some Nobel prizes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you think there will be,</p>
<p>there was a bet between Michio Kaku</p>
<p>and somebody else about.</p>
<p>John Horgan.</p>
<p>John Horgan about,</p>
<p>by the way, maybe discover a cool website,</p>
<p>longbets.com or.org.</p>
<p>Better, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool that you can make a bet with people</p>
<p>and then check in 20 years later.</p>
<p>I really love it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interesting bets on there.</p>
<p>I would love to participate,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting to see,</p>
<p>time flies and you make a bet about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen in 20 years.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t realize 20 years just goes like this.</p>
<p>And then you get to face out</p>
<p>and you get to wonder what was that person?</p>
<p>What was I thinking?</p>
<p>That person 20 years ago</p>
<p>was almost like a different person.</p>
<p>What was I thinking back then to think that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So let me ask you this on record,</p>
<p>20 years from now or some number of years from now,</p>
<p>do you think there will be a Nobel Prize given</p>
<p>for something directly connected</p>
<p>to a first broadly theory of everything?</p>
<p>And second, of course, one of the possibilities,</p>
<p>one of them, string theory?</p>
<p>String theory, definitely not.</p>
<p>Things have gone, yeah.</p>
<p>So if you were giving financial advice,</p>
<p>you would say not to bet on that?</p>
<p>No, do not.</p>
<p>And even, I actually suspect</p>
<p>if you ask string theorists that question,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get a few of them saying,</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;d asked them that question 20 years ago,</p>
<p>again, when Kaku was making this bet or whatever,</p>
<p>I think some of them would have taken you up on it.</p>
<p>And certainly back in 1984,</p>
<p>a bunch of them would have said, oh, sure, yeah.</p>
<p>But now I get the impression that</p>
<p>even they realize that things are not looking good</p>
<p>for that particular idea.</p>
<p>Again, it depends what you mean by string theory,</p>
<p>whether maybe the term will evolve to mean something else,</p>
<p>which will work out.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s not gonna like it to work out,</p>
<p>whether something else.</p>
<p>I mean, I still think it&rsquo;s relatively unlikely</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll have any really successful theory of everything.</p>
<p>And the main problem is just the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s become so difficult to do experiments at higher energy</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve really lost this ability</p>
<p>to kind of get unexpected input from experiment.</p>
<p>And you can, while it&rsquo;s maybe hard to figure out</p>
<p>what people&rsquo;s thinking is gonna be 20 years from now,</p>
<p>looking at high energy particle,</p>
<p>high energy colliders and their technology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually pretty easy to make a pretty accurate guess</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re gonna be doing 20 years from now.</p>
<p>And I think actually, I would actually claim that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty clear where you&rsquo;re gonna be 20 years from now.</p>
<p>And what it&rsquo;s gonna be is you&rsquo;re gonna have the LHC,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a lot more data,</p>
<p>an order of magnitude or more data from the LHC,</p>
<p>but at the same energy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna see a higher energy accelerator</p>
<p>operating successfully in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>And like maybe machine learning</p>
<p>or great sort of data science methodologies</p>
<p>that process that data will not reveal</p>
<p>any major shifts in our understanding</p>
<p>of the underlying physics, you think?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that field, my understanding</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re starting to make a great use of those techniques,</p>
<p>but it seems to look like it will help them</p>
<p>solve certain technical problems</p>
<p>and be able to do things somewhat better,</p>
<p>but not completely change the way they&rsquo;re looking at things.</p>
<p>What do you think about the potential quantum computers</p>
<p>simulating quantum mechanical systems</p>
<p>and through that sneak up to sort of through simulation,</p>
<p>sneak up to a deep understanding of the fundamental physics?</p>
<p>The problem there is that that&rsquo;s promising more</p>
<p>for this, for Phil Anderson&rsquo;s problem,</p>
<p>that if you wanna, there&rsquo;s lots and lots of,</p>
<p>you start putting together lots and lots of things</p>
<p>and we think we know they&rsquo;re pair by pair interactions,</p>
<p>but what this thing is gonna do,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have any good calculational techniques.</p>
<p>Quantum computers may very well give you those.</p>
<p>And so they may, what we think of</p>
<p>is kind of a strong coupling behavior.</p>
<p>We have no good way to calculate.</p>
<p>Even though we can write down the theory,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know how to calculate anything with any accuracy</p>
<p>and the quantum computer may solve that problem.</p>
<p>But the problem is that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna solve the problem</p>
<p>that they help you with the problem</p>
<p>of not having the, of knowing</p>
<p>what the right underlying theory is.</p>
<p>As somebody who likes experimental validation,</p>
<p>let me ask you the perhaps ridiculous sounding,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s actually a ridiculous question</p>
<p>of do you think we live in a simulation?</p>
<p>Do you find that thought experiment</p>
<p>at all useful or interesting?</p>
<p>Not really, I don&rsquo;t, it just doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, anyway, to me, it doesn&rsquo;t actually lead</p>
<p>to any kind of interesting, lead anywhere interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, to me, so maybe I&rsquo;ll throw a wrench into your thing.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s super interesting</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective.</p>
<p>So if you look at virtual reality systems,</p>
<p>the actual question is how much computation</p>
<p>and how difficult is it to construct a world</p>
<p>that like there are several levels here.</p>
<p>One is you won&rsquo;t know the difference,</p>
<p>our human perception systems</p>
<p>and maybe even the tools of physics</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t know the difference</p>
<p>between the simulated world and the real world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of more of a physics question.</p>
<p>The most interesting question to me</p>
<p>has more to do with why food tastes delicious,</p>
<p>which is create how difficult</p>
<p>and how much computation is required</p>
<p>to construct a simulation</p>
<p>where you kind of know it&rsquo;s a simulation at first,</p>
<p>but you want to stay there anyway.</p>
<p>And over time, you don&rsquo;t even remember.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, anyway, I agree,</p>
<p>these are kind of fascinating questions</p>
<p>and they may be very, very relevant</p>
<p>to our future as a species,</p>
<p>but yeah, they&rsquo;re just very far from anything I think.</p>
<p>Well, so from a physics perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not useful to you to think,</p>
<p>taking a computational perspective to our universe,</p>
<p>thinking of it as an information processing system</p>
<p>and then they give it as doing computation</p>
<p>and then you think about the resources required</p>
<p>to do that kind of computation and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You could just look at the basic physics</p>
<p>and who cares what the computer it&rsquo;s running on is.</p>
<p>Yeah, it just, I mean, the kinds of,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m willing to agree</p>
<p>that you can get into interesting kinds of questions</p>
<p>going down that road,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just so different from anything</p>
<p>from what I&rsquo;ve found interesting and I just,</p>
<p>again, I just have to kind of go back to life is too short</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very glad other people are thinking about this,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t see anything I can do with it.</p>
<p>What about space itself?</p>
<p>So I have to ask you about aliens.</p>
<p>Again, something, since you emphasize evidence,</p>
<p>do you think there is, how many,</p>
<p>do you think there are and how many</p>
<p>intelligent alien civilizations are out there?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have no idea, but I have certainly,</p>
<p>as far as I know, unless the government&rsquo;s covering it up</p>
<p>or something, we haven&rsquo;t heard from,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have any evidence for such things yet,</p>
<p>but there seems to be no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no particular obstruction why there shouldn&rsquo;t be, so.</p>
<p>I mean, do you, you work on some fundamental questions</p>
<p>about the physics of reality.</p>
<p>When you look up to the stars,</p>
<p>do you think about whether somebody&rsquo;s looking back at us?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, well, actually,</p>
<p>I originally got interested in physics.</p>
<p>I actually started out as a kid interested in astronomy,</p>
<p>exactly that, and a telescope and whatever that,</p>
<p>and certainly read a lot of science fiction</p>
<p>and thought about that.</p>
<p>I find over the years, I find myself kind of less,</p>
<p>anyway, less and less interested in that one,</p>
<p>just because I don&rsquo;t really know what to do with them.</p>
<p>I also kind of, at some point,</p>
<p>kind of stopped reading science fiction that much,</p>
<p>kind of feeling that there was just too,</p>
<p>that the actual science I was kind of learning about</p>
<p>was perfectly kind of weird and fascinating,</p>
<p>and unusual enough, and better than any of the stuff</p>
<p>that Isaac Asimov, so why should I?</p>
<p>Yeah, and you can mess with the science</p>
<p>much more than the distant science fiction,</p>
<p>the one that exists in our imagination</p>
<p>or the one that exists out there among the stars.</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned science fiction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written quite a few book reviews.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you about some books, perhaps,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>Is there one or two books that you would recommend to others</p>
<p>and maybe if you can, what ideas you drew from them?</p>
<p>Either negative recommendations or positive recommendations.</p>
<p>Do not read this book for sure.</p>
<p>Well, I must say, I mean, unfortunately,</p>
<p>yeah, you can go to my website</p>
<p>and you can click on book reviews</p>
<p>and you can see I&rsquo;ve written, read a lot of,</p>
<p>a lot of, I mean, as you can tell from my views</p>
<p>about string theory, I&rsquo;m not a fan</p>
<p>of a lot of the kind of popular books</p>
<p>about, oh, isn&rsquo;t string theory great?</p>
<p>And yes, I&rsquo;m not a fan of a lot of things of that kind.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a quick question on this, a small tangent?</p>
<p>Are you a fan, can you explore the pros and cons</p>
<p>of, if I get string theory, sort of science communication,</p>
<p>sort of Cosmos style communication of concepts</p>
<p>to people that are outside of physics,</p>
<p>outside of mathematics, outside of even the sciences</p>
<p>and helping people to sort of dream</p>
<p>and fill them with awe about the full range</p>
<p>of mysteries in our universe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a complicated issue.</p>
<p>You know, I think, you know, I certainly go back</p>
<p>and go back to like what inspired me</p>
<p>and maybe to connect it a little bit</p>
<p>to this question about books.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly when the books,</p>
<p>some books that I remember reading when I was a kid</p>
<p>were about the early history of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>like Heisenberg&rsquo;s books that he wrote about, you know,</p>
<p>kind of looking back at telling the history</p>
<p>of what happened when he developed quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of a totally fascinating, romantic,</p>
<p>great story, and those were very inspirational to me.</p>
<p>And I would think maybe other people</p>
<p>might also find them that, but the&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s almost like the human story</p>
<p>of the development of the ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, the human story, but yeah, just also how, you know,</p>
<p>there are these very, very weird ideas</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t seem to make sense,</p>
<p>and how they were struggling with them</p>
<p>and how, you know, they actually&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s the period of physics</p>
<p>kind of beginning, you know, 1905 with Planck and Einstein</p>
<p>and ending up with the war</p>
<p>when these things get used to, you know,</p>
<p>make massively destructive weapons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the truly amazing&hellip;</p>
<p>And so many, so many new ideas.</p>
<p>Let me, on another, a tangent on top of a tangent</p>
<p>on top of a tangent, ask,</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t have Einstein, so how does science progress?</p>
<p>Is it the lone geniuses?</p>
<p>Or is it some kind of weird network of ideas</p>
<p>swimming in the air and just kind of the geniuses</p>
<p>pop up to catch them and others would anyway?</p>
<p>Without Einstein, would we have special relativity,</p>
<p>general relativity?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an interesting case to case basis.</p>
<p>I mean, special relativity, I think we would have had,</p>
<p>I mean, there are other people.</p>
<p>Anyway, you could even argue that it was already there</p>
<p>in some form in some ways,</p>
<p>but I think special relativity you would have had</p>
<p>without Einstein fairly quickly.</p>
<p>General relativity, that was a much, much harder thing to do</p>
<p>and required a much more effort, much more sophisticated.</p>
<p>That I think you would have had sooner or later,</p>
<p>but it would have taken quite a bit longer.</p>
<p>That took a bunch of years to validate scientifically,</p>
<p>the general relativity.</p>
<p>But even for Einstein, from the point where he had</p>
<p>kind of a general idea of what he was trying to do</p>
<p>to the point where he actually had a well defined theory</p>
<p>that you could actually compare to the real world,</p>
<p>that was, I forget the number of the order of magnitude,</p>
<p>10 years of very serious work.</p>
<p>And if he hadn&rsquo;t been around to do that,</p>
<p>it would have taken a while before anyone else</p>
<p>got around to it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are things like,</p>
<p>with quantum mechanics, you have Heisenberg and Schrodinger</p>
<p>came up with two, which ultimately equivalent,</p>
<p>but two different approaches to it</p>
<p>within months of each other.</p>
<p>And so if Heisenberg hadn&rsquo;t been there,</p>
<p>you already would have had Schrodinger or whatever.</p>
<p>And if neither of them had been there,</p>
<p>it would have been somebody else a few months later.</p>
<p>So there are times when the, just the,</p>
<p>a lot often is the combination of the right ideas</p>
<p>are in place and the right experimental data is in place</p>
<p>to point in the right direction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just waiting for somebody who&rsquo;s gonna find it.</p>
<p>Maybe to go back to your aliens,</p>
<p>I guess the one thing that I often wonder about aliens is,</p>
<p>would they have the same fundamental physics ideas</p>
<p>as we have in mathematics?</p>
<p>Would their math, you know, would they, you know,</p>
<p>how much is this really intrinsic to our minds?</p>
<p>If you start out with a different kind of mind</p>
<p>when you end up with a different ideas</p>
<p>of what fundamental physics is</p>
<p>or what the structure of mathematics is.</p>
<p>So this is why, like if I was, you know,</p>
<p>I like video games, the way I would do it</p>
<p>as a curious being, so first experiment I&rsquo;d like to do</p>
<p>is run Earth over many thousands of times</p>
<p>and see if our particular, no, you know what?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do the full evolution.</p>
<p>I would start at Homo sapiens first</p>
<p>and then see the evolution of Homo sapiens</p>
<p>millions of times and see how the ideas</p>
<p>of science would evolve.</p>
<p>Like, would you get, like how would physics evolve?</p>
<p>How would math evolves?</p>
<p>I would particularly just be curious</p>
<p>about the notation they come up with.</p>
<p>Every once in a while I would like throw miracles</p>
<p>at them to like, to mess with them and stuff.</p>
<p>And then I would also like to run Earth</p>
<p>from the very beginning to see if evolution</p>
<p>will produce different kinds of brains</p>
<p>that would then produce different kinds</p>
<p>of mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>And then finally, I would probably millions of times</p>
<p>run the universe over to see what kind of,</p>
<p>what kind of environments and what kind of life</p>
<p>would be created to then lead to intelligent life,</p>
<p>to then lead to theories of mathematics and physics</p>
<p>and to see the full range.</p>
<p>And like, sort of like Darwin kind of mark, okay.</p>
<p>It took them, what is it, several hundred million years</p>
<p>to come up with calculus.</p>
<p>I would just like keep noting how long it took</p>
<p>and get an average and see which ideas are difficult,</p>
<p>which are not and then conclusively sort of figure out</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s more collective intelligence</p>
<p>or singular intelligence that&rsquo;s responsible for shifts</p>
<p>and for big phase shifts and breakthroughs in science.</p>
<p>If I was playing a video game and ran,</p>
<p>I got a chance to run this whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we&rsquo;re talking about books</p>
<p>before I distracted us horribly.</p>
<p>About books, okay, so books, yeah, go back, books.</p>
<p>Yeah, so and then, yeah, so that&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;d recommend</p>
<p>is the books about the, from the original people,</p>
<p>especially Heisenberg about the, how that happened.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a very, very good kind of history</p>
<p>of the kind of what happened during this 20th century</p>
<p>in physics and up to the time of the Standard Model in 1973.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called The Second Creation by Bob Kreis and Mann.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the best ones.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s, but the one thing that I can say is that,</p>
<p>so that book, I think, I forget when it was, late 80s, 90s.</p>
<p>The problem is that there just hasn&rsquo;t been much</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually worked out since then.</p>
<p>So most of the books that are kind of trying to tell you</p>
<p>about all the glorious things that have happened</p>
<p>since 1973 are, they&rsquo;re mostly telling you</p>
<p>about how glorious things are,</p>
<p>which actually don&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really, the argument people sometimes make</p>
<p>in favor of these books as well, oh, they&rsquo;re really great</p>
<p>because you want to do something that will get kids excited.</p>
<p>And then, so they&rsquo;re getting excited about things,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s not really quite working.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter, the main thing is get them excited.</p>
<p>The other argument is, wait a minute,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting people excited about ideas that are wrong,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really kind of, you&rsquo;re actually kind of discrediting</p>
<p>the whole scientific enterprise in a not really good way.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this problem.</p>
<p>So my general feeling about expository stuff is, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to the extent you can do it kind of honestly</p>
<p>and, well, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people doing that now,</p>
<p>but to the extent that you&rsquo;re just trying to get people</p>
<p>excited and enthusiastic by kind of telling them stuff,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t really true,</p>
<p>you really shouldn&rsquo;t be doing that.</p>
<p>You obviously have a much better intuition about physics.</p>
<p>I tend to, in the space of AI, for example,</p>
<p>you could use certain kinds of language,</p>
<p>like calling things intelligent</p>
<p>that could rub people the wrong way.</p>
<p>But I never had a problem with that kind of thing,</p>
<p>saying that a program can learn its way</p>
<p>without any human supervision as AlphaZero does</p>
<p>to play chess.</p>
<p>To me, that may not be intelligence,</p>
<p>but it sure as heck seems like a few steps</p>
<p>down the path towards intelligence.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s a very peculiar property</p>
<p>of systems that can be engineered.</p>
<p>So even if the idea is fuzzy,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not really sure what intelligence is,</p>
<p>or if you don&rsquo;t have a deep fundamental understanding</p>
<p>or even a model what intelligence is,</p>
<p>if you build a system that sure as heck is impressive</p>
<p>and showing some of the signs</p>
<p>of what previously thought impossible</p>
<p>for a nonintelligent system,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s impressive and that&rsquo;s inspiring</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s okay to celebrate.</p>
<p>In physics, because you&rsquo;re not engineering anything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just now swimming in the space,</p>
<p>directly when you do theoretical physics,</p>
<p>that it could be more dangerous.</p>
<p>You could be out too far away from shore.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the problem, I think physics is,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually hard for people even to believe</p>
<p>or really understand how that this particular kind</p>
<p>of physics has gotten itself into a really unusual</p>
<p>and strange and historically unusual state,</p>
<p>which is not really.</p>
<p>I mean, I spent half my life among mathematicians</p>
<p>and half of the physicists,</p>
<p>and mathematics is kind of doing fine.</p>
<p>People are making progress</p>
<p>and it has all the usual problems,</p>
<p>but also, so you could have a,</p>
<p>but I just, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen anything at all happening in mathematics</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s happened in this specific area in physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the kind of sociology of this,</p>
<p>the way this field works banging up</p>
<p>against this harder problem without anything</p>
<p>from experiment to help it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s led to some really kind</p>
<p>of problematic things.</p>
<p>And those, so it&rsquo;s one thing to kind of oversimplify</p>
<p>or to slightly misrepresent,</p>
<p>to try to explain things in a way that&rsquo;s not quite right,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s another thing to start promoting to people</p>
<p>as a success as ideas, which really completely failed.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, I&rsquo;ve kind of a very, very specific,</p>
<p>if you used to have people, I won&rsquo;t name any names,</p>
<p>for instance, coming on certain podcasts like yours,</p>
<p>telling the world, this is a huge success</p>
<p>and this is really wonderful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>And this is really problematic</p>
<p>and it carries a serious danger of once,</p>
<p>when people realize that this is what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>that the loss of credibility of science</p>
<p>is a real, real problem for our society.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want people to have an all too good reason</p>
<p>to think that what they&rsquo;re being told</p>
<p>by kind of some of the best institutions</p>
<p>or a country or authorities is not true.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not true, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obviously characteristic of not just physics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sociology.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I mean, obviously in the space of politics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the history of politics is you sell ideas to people,</p>
<p>even when you don&rsquo;t have any proof</p>
<p>that those ideas actually work in the US</p>
<p>because if they&rsquo;ve worked in that,</p>
<p>that seems to be the case throughout history.</p>
<p>And just like you said, it&rsquo;s human beings running up</p>
<p>against a really hard problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this is like a particular like trajectory</p>
<p>through the progress of physics</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re dealing with now</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just a natural progress of science.</p>
<p>You run up against a really difficult stage of a field</p>
<p>and different people behave differently in the face of that.</p>
<p>Some sell books and sort of tell narratives</p>
<p>that are beautiful and so on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not necessarily grounded in solutions</p>
<p>that have proven themselves.</p>
<p>Others kind of put their head down quietly,</p>
<p>keep doing the work.</p>
<p>Others sort of pivot to different fields</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of like, yeah, ants scattering.</p>
<p>And then you have fields like machine learning,</p>
<p>which there was a few folks mostly scattered away</p>
<p>from machine learning in the 90s,</p>
<p>in the winter of AI, AI winter, as they call it.</p>
<p>But a few people kept their head down</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re called the fathers of deep learning.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t think of it that way.</p>
<p>And in fact, if there&rsquo;s another AI winter,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just probably keep working on it anyway,</p>
<p>sort of like loyal ants sticking to a particular thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting, but you&rsquo;re sort of saying</p>
<p>that we should be careful over hyping things</p>
<p>that have not proven themselves</p>
<p>because people will lose trust in the scientific process.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, there&rsquo;s been other ways</p>
<p>in which people have lost trust in the scientific process.</p>
<p>That ultimately has to do actually</p>
<p>with all the same kind of behavior as you&rsquo;re highlighting,</p>
<p>which is not being honest and transparent</p>
<p>about the flaws of mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s always a problem.</p>
<p>But this particular field is kind of fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a strange one.</p>
<p>I mean, I think in the sense that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of public fascination with it</p>
<p>that it seems to speak to kind of our deepest questions</p>
<p>about what is this physical reality?</p>
<p>Where do we come from?</p>
<p>And these kind of deep issues.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this unusual fascination with it.</p>
<p>Mathematics is very different.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s that interested in mathematics.</p>
<p>Nobody really kind of expects to learn really great,</p>
<p>deep things about the world from mathematics that much.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t ask mathematicians that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very unusual,</p>
<p>it draws this kind of unusual amount of attention.</p>
<p>And it really is historically in a really unusual state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten itself way kind of down a blind alley</p>
<p>in a way which it&rsquo;s hard to find</p>
<p>other historical parallels to.</p>
<p>But sort of to push back a little bit,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s power to inspiring people.</p>
<p>And if I just empirically look,</p>
<p>physicists are really good at combining science</p>
<p>and philosophy and communicating it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something about physics often</p>
<p>that forces you to build a strong intuition</p>
<p>about the way reality works, right?</p>
<p>And that allows you to think through sort of</p>
<p>and communicate about all kinds of questions.</p>
<p>Like if you see physicists,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always fascinating to take on problems</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with their particular discipline.</p>
<p>They think in interesting ways</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re able to communicate</p>
<p>their thinking in interesting ways.</p>
<p>And so in some sense, they have a responsibility</p>
<p>not just to do science, but to inspire.</p>
<p>And not responsibility, but the opportunity.</p>
<p>And thereby, I would say a little bit of a responsibility.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, anyway, it&rsquo;s hard to say</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s many, many people doing this kind of thing</p>
<p>with different degrees of success and whatever.</p>
<p>I guess one thing, but I mean,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s kind of front and center for me</p>
<p>is kind of a more parochial interest</p>
<p>is just kind of what damage do you do</p>
<p>to the subject itself, ignoring,</p>
<p>okay, misrepresenting what high school students think</p>
<p>about string theory and that doesn&rsquo;t matter much,</p>
<p>but what the smartest undergraduates</p>
<p>or the smartest graduate students in the world think about it</p>
<p>and what paths you&rsquo;re leading them down</p>
<p>and what story you&rsquo;re telling them</p>
<p>and what textbooks you&rsquo;re making them read</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>And so a lot of what&rsquo;s motivated me</p>
<p>is more to try to speak to this kind of a specific population</p>
<p>of people to make sure that, look, people,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter so much what the average person</p>
<p>on the street thinks about string theory,</p>
<p>but what the best students at Columbia or Harvard</p>
<p>or Princeton or whatever who really wanna change,</p>
<p>work in this field and wanna work that way,</p>
<p>what they know about it, what they think about it</p>
<p>and that they not be going to the field being misled</p>
<p>and believing that a certain story,</p>
<p>this is where this is all going,</p>
<p>this is what I gotta do, that&rsquo;s important to me.</p>
<p>Well, in general, for graduate students,</p>
<p>for people who seek to be experts in the field,</p>
<p>diversity of ideas is really powerful</p>
<p>and is getting into this local pocket of ideas</p>
<p>that people hold on to for several decades is not good,</p>
<p>no matter what the idea.</p>
<p>I would say no matter if the idea is right or wrong,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no such thing as right in the long term,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s right for now until somebody builds on</p>
<p>something much bigger on top of it.</p>
<p>It might end up being right,</p>
<p>but being a tiny subset of a much bigger thing.</p>
<p>So you always should question sort of the ways of the past.</p>
<p>Yeah, so how to kind of achieve</p>
<p>that kind of diversity of thought</p>
<p>and within kind of the sociology</p>
<p>of how we organize scientific researches.</p>
<p>I know this is one thing that I think it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>that Sabina Hassenfelder has very interesting things</p>
<p>to say about it.</p>
<p>And I think also Lee Smolin in his book,</p>
<p>which is also about that very much in agreement with them</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a really kind of important questions</p>
<p>about how research in this field is organized</p>
<p>and what can you do to kind of get more diversity of thought</p>
<p>and get people thinking about a wider range of ideas.</p>
<p>At the bottom, I think humility always helps.</p>
<p>Well, the problem is that it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a combination of humility to know when you&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>and also, but also you have to have a certain</p>
<p>very serious lack of humility to believe</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna make progress on some of these problems.</p>
<p>I think you have to have like both modes</p>
<p>and switch between them when needed.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not gonna wanna answer</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re focused on the mathematics of things</p>
<p>and mathematics can&rsquo;t answer the why questions,</p>
<p>but let me ask you anyway.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s meaning to this whole thing?</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was thinking about this.</p>
<p>So the, and it did occur to me,</p>
<p>one interesting thing about that question</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>yeah, so I have this life in mathematics</p>
<p>and this life in physics</p>
<p>and I see some of my physicist colleagues,</p>
<p>kind of seem to be, people are often asking them,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re writing books about the meaning of life</p>
<p>and teaching courses about the meaning of life.</p>
<p>But then I realized that no one ever asked</p>
<p>my mathematician colleagues.</p>
<p>Nobody ever asked mathematicians.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>So yeah, everybody just kind of assumes,</p>
<p>okay, well, you people are studying mathematics,</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re doing, it&rsquo;s maybe very interesting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s clearly not gonna tell me anything useful</p>
<p>about the meaning of my life.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m afraid a lot of my point of view is that</p>
<p>if people realized how little difference there was</p>
<p>between what the mathematicians are doing</p>
<p>and what a lot of these theoretical physicists are doing,</p>
<p>they might understand that it&rsquo;s a bit misguided</p>
<p>to look for deep insight into the meaning of life</p>
<p>from many theoretical physicists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, they&rsquo;re people,</p>
<p>they may have interesting things to say about this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, they know a lot about physical reality</p>
<p>and about, in some sense about metaphysics,</p>
<p>about what is real of this kind.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also, to my mind,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re also making a bit of a mistake</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re looking to, I mean, I&rsquo;m very, very aware</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve led a very pleasant</p>
<p>and fairly privileged existence</p>
<p>and fairly without many challenges of different kinds</p>
<p>and of a certain kind.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really not in no way the kind of person</p>
<p>that a lot of people who are looking for</p>
<p>to try to understand in some sense the meaning of life</p>
<p>in the sense of the challenges that they&rsquo;re facing in life.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really, I&rsquo;m really the wrong person</p>
<p>for you to be asking about this.</p>
<p>Well, if struggle is somehow a thing that&rsquo;s core to meaning,</p>
<p>perhaps mathematicians are just quietly the ones</p>
<p>who are most equipped to answer that question</p>
<p>if, in fact, the creation or at least experiencing beauty</p>
<p>is at the core of the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Because it seems like mathematics is the methodology</p>
<p>by which you can most purely explore beautiful things, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So in some sense,</p>
<p>maybe we should talk to mathematicians more.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, maybe, but unfortunately,</p>
<p>people do have a somewhat correct perception</p>
<p>that what these people are doing every day</p>
<p>or whatever is pretty far removed from anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, from what&rsquo;s kind of close to what I do every day</p>
<p>and what my typical concerns are.</p>
<p>So you may learn something very interesting</p>
<p>by talking to mathematicians,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably not gonna be,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not gonna get what you were hoping.</p>
<p>So when you put the pen and paper down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking about physics</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not thinking about mathematics</p>
<p>and you just get to breathe in the air and look around you</p>
<p>and realize that you&rsquo;re going to die one day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think about that?</p>
<p>Your ideas will live on, but you, the human.</p>
<p>Not especially much.</p>
<p>Certainly, I&rsquo;ve been getting older.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now 64 years old.</p>
<p>You start to realize, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably less ahead than there was behind.</p>
<p>And so you start to, that starts to become,</p>
<p>what do I think about that?</p>
<p>Maybe I should actually get serious</p>
<p>about getting some things done,</p>
<p>which I may not have,</p>
<p>which I may otherwise not have time to do,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>And this didn&rsquo;t seem to be a problem when I was younger,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the main,</p>
<p>I think the main way in which that thought occurred.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t, you know, the stoics are big on this.</p>
<p>Meditating on mortality helps you</p>
<p>more intensely appreciate the beauty</p>
<p>when you do experience it.</p>
<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time trying,</p>
<p>but yeah.</p>
<p>Day to day, you just enjoy the positives, the mathematics.</p>
<p>Just enjoy, yeah, our life in general.</p>
<p>Life is, I have a perfectly pleasant life and enjoy it.</p>
<p>And I often think, wow, this is,</p>
<p>things are, I&rsquo;m really enjoying this.</p>
<p>Things are going well.</p>
<p>Yeah, life is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>I think you and I are pretty lucky.</p>
<p>We get to live on this nice little earth</p>
<p>with a nice little comfortable climate,</p>
<p>and we get to have this nice little podcast conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for spending your valuable time</p>
<p>with me today and having this conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Glad to, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Peter White.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself,</p>
<p>and you are the easiest person to fool.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
