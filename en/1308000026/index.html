    <p>Does anybody have any thoughts on this? I mean, I think it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So does Friedberg&rsquo;s dog.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the All In podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a week. It&rsquo;s been a minute with us today. Of course,</p>
<p>the queen of Kinwa David Friedberg and the rain man himself calling in from a nondescript</p>
<p>mansion in one of 17 cities, the rain man himself, David Sachs, and cackling like a dictator</p>
<p>who got his to Billy back. And he&rsquo;s back in the game. Chamath Pali Hapitiya.</p>
<p>For those of you three, he&rsquo;s rebillionized.</p>
<p>He rebillionized. Is he going to get a car with doors that go like this?</p>
<p>Doors that go like this?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about the vaccine. Biden says everybody who&rsquo;s an adult is qualified by May</p>
<p>1, he&rsquo;s instructed the states to do that. We are now hitting 2.x million a day, we had a 3</p>
<p>million shot day, I believe Friedberg and obviously the $1.9 billion COVID slash everybody gets a big</p>
<p>slice bill got passed.</p>
<p>$1.9 trillion with a T.</p>
<p>Sorry, that&rsquo;s what I said $1.9 trillion. No, somebody put $1.9 billion in the notes. Yes,</p>
<p>$1.9 trillion. $1.9 billion is what the COVID</p>
<p>went for. The COVID NFT went for $1.9 trillion.</p>
<p>As Sachs said in the past, a trillion here, a trillion there.</p>
<p>Soon enough, it&rsquo;s real money. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, Biden&rsquo;s speech really kind of begged the question of why we still need this $2 trillion</p>
<p>bill if COVID is going to be over in May. But putting that aside, I think Biden&rsquo;s speech was</p>
<p>very welcome in that he called for states to drop all of these crazy eligibility requirements that</p>
<p>are actually preventing people from getting vaccinated at this point. He says that every</p>
<p>adult American should be able to get a dose by May 1. And he&rsquo;s right. And you know, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>sharp contrast with Gavin Newsom in California who keeps playing political games with the</p>
<p>administration of these doses. So, in California, yesterday, just yesterday, we added 250,000 more</p>
<p>doses of unused inventory. So, the amount grew to 4.5 million unused doses sitting on a shelf.</p>
<p>Only 215,000 people got vaccinated. So, we&rsquo;re actually building inventory</p>
<p>faster than we&rsquo;re building the population of people getting vaccinated. And it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>of all these crazy rules and requirements. You have to go make an appointment.</p>
<p>You know, and that really, actually, it&rsquo;s counterproductive because it discriminates</p>
<p>against people who are less computer savvy, don&rsquo;t know how to navigate the website, or,</p>
<p>you know, communities who don&rsquo;t want to enter their name in a government database,</p>
<p>which, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people in California don&rsquo;t want to, you know, put their</p>
<p>names in a government database. And so, it works against those communities getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>At this point, we should just drop all the requirements, drop the website, let anyone</p>
<p>who wants a vaccine just get in line and get vaccinated. It&rsquo;ll go much faster.</p>
<p>The problem is that we throw around this word equity, and that we need to do something with</p>
<p>equity. And in fact, I think that people who use that word are stupid. I think what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to say actually is we don&rsquo;t want inequity. And the most inequitable thing is to actually</p>
<p>take the most impoverished and fragile of the population and prevent them from actually getting</p>
<p>the vaccine because they&rsquo;re the ones that actually need to be working and can&rsquo;t afford to actually</p>
<p>not work or can&rsquo;t afford to be sick or can&rsquo;t afford to, you know, find solutions to childcare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this weird word that like, you know, the extreme left uses now to describe policies that</p>
<p>are just frankly, poorly thought out and even more poorly executed.</p>
<p>It might even be more pernicious than that, correct, Freiburg, in that</p>
<p>anybody who gets a shot is helping everybody else because they are now a blocker in the system. I</p>
<p>know this is incredibly simplistic, but I&rsquo;m a simplistic guy. And it just seems</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different way of thinking about the benefit of vaccination. And I&rsquo;ve said it in</p>
<p>the past, but the benefit of vaccination is to get enough people vaccinated that the virus</p>
<p>generally stops spreading, and then the pandemic ends. And that&rsquo;s the objective. It&rsquo;s not about</p>
<p>creating equitable protection for individuals. And as Americans, it&rsquo;s interesting, we think</p>
<p>about it in terms of an individual benefit. It&rsquo;s like, how much do I get? What do I get from this</p>
<p>vaccine? I want to get protected, the other guys getting protected before me, who gets to go first,</p>
<p>yada, yada, and it becomes this kind of competitive, you know, frothing for a vaccination.</p>
<p>And the reality is, if we get enough people vaccinated fast enough, the pandemic ends.</p>
<p>If we can get 200 million shots in arms, this goes back to I think, this tweet I sent in</p>
<p>early January, December, we get 200 million shots in arms, we can be done with the pandemic based</p>
<p>on you know, how many the efficacy of transmission rate reduction, combined with the fact that a</p>
<p>certain number of people have already developed immunity to this thing, we get to the point that</p>
<p>there should be kind of a, you know, think about a network, and you start turning nodes off the</p>
<p>network suddenly becomes really hard to see transmission happen across the network. And,</p>
<p>and so the prioritization of, you know, who gets the vaccine over, you know, how fast we are</p>
<p>deploying the vaccine has been a critical error from day one, in my opinion. Now, look, all that</p>
<p>being said, I feel like we could sit here and criticize and argue about tactics and strategy</p>
<p>all day long about this and, you know, make politicians look like idiots and administrators</p>
<p>look like idiots. But the truth is, we are now seeing 3 million shots a day. In Biden&rsquo;s speech,</p>
<p>he said, which, if you&rsquo;ll remember is what I said, we really should be targeting is about 1%</p>
<p>of the population every day. And that&rsquo;s roughly where we are. Biden said in his speech that we</p>
<p>are in a war footing, which is effectively what we said the other day, the federal government is</p>
<p>operating 600 mass vac sites. And we are right now getting shots in arms for all of the issues</p>
<p>with prioritization and nonsense that&rsquo;s going on. I feel very</p>
<p>in the United States. I agree that Biden has the correct posture on this, which is war footing.</p>
<p>We are not doing that in California. I mean, I just talked about how we&rsquo;re building inventories</p>
<p>faster than we&rsquo;re getting vaccines administered. Newsome just announced that 40% of the vaccines</p>
<p>are now going to be basically separated out and reserved for equity zones. And you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even mean, it means that certain communities, only people in certain communities can get those</p>
<p>vaccines. And they&rsquo;re going to be distributed out through this complicated system of</p>
<p>local community groups. All that does is put money through some no bid contract to some</p>
<p>shitty technical company. A bunch of consultants that then take advantage of the system get paid</p>
<p>hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to do nothing. I mean, right, exactly. I tweeted out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this bot that now scrapes and by the way, before I tweeted out this thing about this bot,</p>
<p>which is I think, yeah, I sent it to you. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the California vaccines available bot.</p>
<p>Exactly. And all it does is it&rsquo;s it scrapes that my turn.ca website. But before that,</p>
<p>in our group chat, there was another friend of ours who wrote his own scraper, if you guys</p>
<p>remember. And it was really shocking because all it would show is page after page after page of</p>
<p>completely open and available vaccine slots. Yeah. You know, at the Moscone Center and other</p>
<p>places. And you think all of this stuff is just a bunch of I&rsquo;ll be blunt, rich white people sitting</p>
<p>in a room with their head up their ass. And they come up with these stupid fucking rules. And then</p>
<p>they try to implement them with words like equity. And all that happens is that you compound inequality.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s go back and let&rsquo;s go back to Freeberg&rsquo;s first point, which is that all these unvaccinated</p>
<p>people who can&rsquo;t get vaccinated faster become a giant Petri dish for the virus to continue spreading</p>
<p>and experimenting on morphing and morphing. So maybe we actually do get a vaccine resistant</p>
<p>strain. The new strains, the variants have been popping up so far are not a vaccine resistant.</p>
<p>But the longer the pandemic goes on, the longer there&rsquo;s a chance that one could arise. And then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back to square one on this thing. So it&rsquo;s going to hurt everybody. And here&rsquo;s the crazy</p>
<p>thing is that, you know, I think we all know a lot of people. I know dozens of people who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been vaccinated in California. And they all come to me and tell me they&rsquo;re whispering about it,</p>
<p>you know, because they don&rsquo;t want to tell anyone. They&rsquo;re scared of being canceled.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re scared of being canceled because, you know, Newsom and the equity people have created</p>
<p>this idea that if you get a vaccine, you&rsquo;re taking away from somebody else. In reality,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not because anybody who&rsquo;s high risk has already gotten the vaccine by now or has had</p>
<p>access to get the vaccine. And all you&rsquo;re doing right now, if you get the vaccine is taking a dose</p>
<p>off the shelf, where there&rsquo;s 4.5 million doses sitting there, and it&rsquo;s increasing by millions</p>
<p>every week. And so what we need to do is, well, let me make a PSA actually, starting on Monday,</p>
<p>you could anyone in California can get the vaccine with a doctor&rsquo;s note. And they&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>doctors have total discretion to give the note. So let me just make a PSA to everyone out there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in California, just go get a doctor&rsquo;s note starting on Monday and go get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, stop, stop worrying about Newsom stupid rules.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also just remember, so two points on that not everyone has the ability to go just get a</p>
<p>doctor&rsquo;s note. It&rsquo;s really hard for people that have to go to public clinics and so on to get a</p>
<p>doctor&rsquo;s note. What we are seeing is a lot of people just hacking the website, almost like</p>
<p>Soviet Union era breadlines, where they go to the website, they type in something that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>to get themselves a slot. And that&rsquo;s how a lot of people are kind of filling the void. The reality</p>
<p>is, I just want to go back to the point I was making at the beginning, I think we&rsquo;re skating</p>
<p>out of this thing. And I think that the inventory surplus, which is absolutely being built up at a</p>
<p>staggering rate in the United States right now, if you look at the inventory forecast from J&amp;J,</p>
<p>Pfizer and Moderna, relative to the deployment rate of the vaccines right now, you&rsquo;re correct,</p>
<p>we are building up a surplus and inventory surplus and the rate of buildup per day is</p>
<p>increasing right now. So 1 million extra shots a day, 2 million extra shots a day being</p>
<p>a million. And so we&rsquo;re building up an inventory. And so what happens with the 30 million we have</p>
<p>already in inventory. So what&rsquo;s happening is there are natural market dynamics where we are all</p>
<p>pointing out and saying is starting to play out in terms of people kind of hacking the system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much supply. There are many vac sites. Now you can go to any supermarket,</p>
<p>any pharmacy in California to get a shot. And everyone&rsquo;s just clicking the box and saying,</p>
<p>yes, I qualify, and they&rsquo;re going in and getting shots. So the market demand is starting to meet</p>
<p>the supply, even though there are government and regulatory forces that are trying to inhibit that</p>
<p>from taking place. And so I do feel pretty good when you look at kind of the inventory forecast,</p>
<p>and you look at how many shots are being given per day, that in 45 days or so, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get to a point that we&rsquo;re starting to skate out of this thing and kind of call ask you can ask</p>
<p>you a question, despite the idiocy of the process that regulators have kind of put in place. Yeah,</p>
<p>Freeberg, I just have a quick science question, because I was trying to find the answer to this,</p>
<p>but I would love for you to tell us. What is the real efficacy of the vaccine? And what is</p>
<p>your transmittability like your carrier status once you&rsquo;ve gotten, for example, like, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say you take the Pfizer vaccine, right? Yeah. If you get the Pfizer vaccine,</p>
<p>how many days until this is like pretty good? And, you know, like, what is really the risk</p>
<p>profile between the first shot and the second shot? I&rsquo;ll share this link, and then we can post</p>
<p>it on the show on the on the show notes, and people can take a look at it. But it&rsquo;s an excellent</p>
<p>paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showing basically a population of</p>
<p>unvaccinated against Pfizer vaccinated with half a million in each population, half a million people.</p>
<p>And yeah, and they showed basically the accumulated infection rate, severe hospitalization</p>
<p>rate and death rate of each of the two populations over time. And that really kind of, I think,</p>
<p>highlights the efficacy of the vaccines and at what time period they become efficacious on each</p>
<p>of those metrics. And by the way, even after the first dose across a population of half a million</p>
<p>people, the margin of error on death shows that there may even be complete protection against</p>
<p>death after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine within seven days of getting that shot pretty</p>
<p>powerful statistic. What just to describe the chart for those people listening, you have two</p>
<p>populations, and one&rsquo;s in blue, one&rsquo;s in red. And it&rsquo;s the time is, you know, in days on the bottom</p>
<p>axis. And when you get to day eight, one line goes sideways, and the other one goes keeps going</p>
<p>straight up. So it&rsquo;s day eight after the Pfizer, that you&rsquo;re basically protected, according to</p>
<p>this chart. And that&rsquo;s on the first shot. And like, I think it adds like one or two cases.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ve been zero deaths. So I think day eight is the day. And the second dose</p>
<p>seems like to me, you know, it&rsquo;s just this unbelievable extra. Another amazing chart,</p>
<p>which maybe we can dump in the show notes is what&rsquo;s happening in San Francisco, we hit 10,000</p>
<p>shots a day. At the end of February, March 1, we&rsquo;re doing now 2000 shots a day. So we literally</p>
<p>have dropped 70%. Or so we&rsquo;re at 3000 shots, I think from the peak. Yeah. So this crazy wokeness</p>
<p>is resulting in, you know, in this, this virtue signaling that, you know, oh, we can&rsquo;t give any</p>
<p>shots to anybody unless we get this group first or that group first is now leading to everybody</p>
<p>hacking the system. The hack that I&rsquo;ve heard is, since teachers are getting it, childcare people,</p>
<p>and food service people are getting it, people are now starting to get jobs at DoorDash,</p>
<p>or saying they&rsquo;re a teacher. And if you check that box, according to, you know, the back channel that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard, you go get the shot and you don&rsquo;t get they don&rsquo;t ask you for anything other than</p>
<p>your driver&rsquo;s license. No one&rsquo;s checking. It&rsquo;s just a driver&rsquo;s license pharmacies, the grocery</p>
<p>stores, the mass vac sites, the SF DPH, California DPH administered sites, the federal sites, no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>checking. You sign up, you check a box on the website, it says I attest that this is true.</p>
<p>And then you go and show your ID and get your shot. And so a lot of people have kind of initially</p>
<p>started skirting around the rules by going to be a DoorDash driver for a day or what have you.</p>
<p>And then saying, I&rsquo;m a food and ag worker. And then now generally, people I think, are just</p>
<p>clicking on the box and going in and getting a shot. Now, sorry, just to go back on the previous</p>
<p>question, Chamath, I shared it figure to Nick in this paper I shared, particularly box E,</p>
<p>shows the deaths due to COVID-19 of a vaccinated population and non vaccinated population.</p>
<p>And then it shows documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. And you&rsquo;ll see that you basically have</p>
<p>almost no incremental infections in the vaccinated population, starting around 28 days after your</p>
<p>first dose. And so you know, that&rsquo;s really when you could say you&rsquo;ve got, you know, really good</p>
<p>kind of protection from the vaccine, and you&rsquo;re already starting to get the benefits early on.</p>
<p>antibody studies have also shown that there&rsquo;s this big jump up that happens around that period of</p>
<p>time. And so call it three weeks after your first shot, and then in particular, the fourth week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really kind of like locked in with a protective capacity. Now, your question around</p>
<p>transmissibility is one that&rsquo;s still being studied, which is if I&rsquo;ve got a vaccine, am I going to be</p>
<p>able to pick up the virus and transmit it to someone else? Right now, you know, they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>well, we don&rsquo;t have evidence one way or the other. But I mean, generally, the way that the virus is</p>
<p>spread is you develop an infection in your body, your body then makes lots of copies of the virus,</p>
<p>and then you cough and spit them out in the air. And that&rsquo;s how people get it. So theoretically,</p>
<p>you could carry some virus on your mouth or on your nose where those cells don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>immunoprotectiveness. And, you know, the vaccine, the virus is still alive, but it&rsquo;s not spreading</p>
<p>in your body, you&rsquo;re not creating a lot of superfluous virus to spread in the world. So,</p>
<p>you know, the basic science of it is, you should not be spreading COVID if you&rsquo;ve been vaccinated,</p>
<p>right? I mean, you may have some on your skin or your nose or something for a short period of time,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to develop a systemic infection that you&rsquo;re then going to kind of</p>
<p>start exerting everywhere. So I think we should, we should we should start to transition to this</p>
<p>world of feeling really good and safe and enjoying ourselves. Yeah, we hit 500,000 shots a</p>
<p>day sacks in California. And now we&rsquo;re down to 150,000. We&rsquo;ve literally gone down two thirds</p>
<p>under the management of Governor hair gel. It&rsquo;s Yeah, because because you know, and what was his</p>
<p>in his state of this, the state speech, which went over like a lead balloon, the most notable quote</p>
<p>was, we&rsquo;re not going back to normal, normal was never good enough, normal accepts inequity.</p>
<p>So because there might be some inequity in the world around the wrong person in line getting</p>
<p>these doses, we&rsquo;re never going back to normal. And he&rsquo;s basically ensuring that result by taking</p>
<p>forever with these vaccines. But let me, let me, let me go back to this point about efficacy. So</p>
<p>I think Friberg gave the stats on look, the bottom line here is that vaccines work. That is the</p>
<p>message we should be getting out to people is that they work. And the thing I&rsquo;ve been really</p>
<p>surprised by in the reactions I&rsquo;m seeing to my own tweets on Twitter about this is how loud the</p>
<p>anti vax voices are, and how loud and sort of when you say anti vax, you don&rsquo;t mean not take the</p>
<p>vaccine, you mean the vaccine doesn&rsquo;t work, and we&rsquo;re never getting rid of COVID. The forever</p>
<p>COVID people. Yeah, well, there&rsquo;s no it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s actually a lot of people</p>
<p>on Twitter who got really angry when I when I just tweeted, I tweeted something about how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s over, I tweeted, it&rsquo;s over. You know, right, Biden says we can all get the vaccine</p>
<p>in May. If you decide not to do it, that&rsquo;s on you, the rest of us are moving on. And I got a lot of</p>
<p>all I was really saying is, look, once the vaccine is available, there&rsquo;s no need for any of these</p>
<p>COVID restrictions anymore. But a lot of people interpreted that as me saying something that you</p>
<p>should be forced to get the vaccine or something like that. Now, look, I don&rsquo;t think you should be</p>
<p>forced to get it. But I think it&rsquo;s highly effective. It works. And, but I&rsquo;m surprised at</p>
<p>how loud these sort of anti vax voices are. It&rsquo;s usually like a conspiracy theory around around</p>
<p>the vaccine. And I think part of the reason why those voices are so loud is because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>unopposed. Because all the people who believe in the vaccine are getting it, but they&rsquo;re all afraid</p>
<p>of like, like you were saying, J. Cal of being canceled. And so there&rsquo;s a conspiracy of silence</p>
<p>around this. You know, what we all need to be saying is, look, go get vaccinated. It works.</p>
<p>Take the win. America, take the win. We screwed this thing up for 14 months. Can we just take</p>
<p>the goddamn win and move on? I&rsquo;ll give you a I&rsquo;ll give you a little</p>
<p>thing that that always pops into my mind and all of these things. Whenever I hear</p>
<p>some politician or some like naval gazing intellectual use the word inequity. I think</p>
<p>like this is a power grab because the word equity is really about ownership. Whereas the word</p>
<p>equality is about balance. Right? And and power hungry politicians love the word equity and</p>
<p>inequity because it&rsquo;s their opportunity to grab power. And to tell us how things should be done</p>
<p>or to do things differently in a way where, you know, they can enforce their mandate,</p>
<p>which is typically ill formed and not very smart. And I would just encourage all of us whenever you</p>
<p>hear the word equity or inequity is huge, huge red light should be going off in your head saying</p>
<p>whatever this person says next is a crock of horseshit. And it&rsquo;s probably a power grab.</p>
<p>Whereas if you hear people really talking about solving inequality, there&rsquo;s really no mechanism</p>
<p>to solve inequality through power. Well, I think that&rsquo;s a great point around the</p>
<p>language that gets used. And I have a similar concern about the way that the word privilege</p>
<p>gets used. We used to have a term in this country called success. Yeah, people were successful or</p>
<p>not. And, you know, success had a connotation of being earned, whereas privilege has a connotation</p>
<p>of being unearned. Well, I mean, now, sometimes privilege is earned success, and sometimes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unearned. And, you know, but but when you start using the word privilege to describe all success,</p>
<p>it implies that there&rsquo;s something, you know, unjust or unearned about it, and it needs to</p>
<p>be reallocated. So, you know, that to me is another one of these political words is,</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t be confusing success with privilege. Yeah, they&rsquo;re two very different things.</p>
<p>I have an example of this. Oprah Winfrey is successful. Prince Henry is has privilege.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s privilege.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s privilege. I shoehorned the Meghan Markle story.</p>
<p>I mean, I do want to talk about the Meghan Markle story, actually, at some point before the end of</p>
<p>this podcast. But before we do that, right now, okay. Joe Launcel actually also had a tweet,</p>
<p>a pretty unapologetic set of tweets around, you know, the miscasting of this, this concept of</p>
<p>privilege. And I thought it was really on point. I really agreed with what he was saying. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>effectively what you&rsquo;re saying, David, it&rsquo;s like, people right now, I find are just so well, not</p>
<p>people, the people that take the time to wallow in Twitter, mostly, at least as I interact with them,</p>
<p>are just so bitter. And I think that there is no magnanimous happiness for other people&rsquo;s success</p>
<p>anymore. It, I think, I think, like, we live in a culture now where everybody feels it is so zero</p>
<p>sum, when it&rsquo;s not, in fact, zero sum. And people just begrudge other people&rsquo;s success, especially,</p>
<p>by the way, when it&rsquo;s earned. And the reason is because there&rsquo;s an entire generation of people</p>
<p>of all different ages, and, you know, but this this last five or 10 years, who tapped themselves</p>
<p>out. Now, some were legitimately prevented from success. But there&rsquo;s a lot of people that bought</p>
<p>into this narrative of, well, it&rsquo;s a whole conspiracy that&rsquo;s set up against me, so I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>even going to try. And they are often the loudest and the most embittered. Absolutely. And the reason</p>
<p>is because, you know, everybody wakes up in their 40s and 50s and starts to rationalize their choices</p>
<p>in their lives. And what they really feel deep down inside is, oh, my God, I just let an entire</p>
<p>decade go by of blaming other people. And I think there&rsquo;s a surprisingly large amount of that.</p>
<p>This ideology of victimization doesn&rsquo;t teach people the right things, because you start to</p>
<p>think that, you know, if you&rsquo;re wallowing in your oppression, then you don&rsquo;t have agency over your</p>
<p>own life, you&rsquo;re blaming other people for not being successful, not getting ahead, when what</p>
<p>you should be doing is focusing on working and improving your own life and getting ahead.</p>
<p>Or also just redefining what happiness means. Happiness doesn&rsquo;t mean what that other person</p>
<p>has and then saying, because I don&rsquo;t have that, I have nothing. Happiness is really like</p>
<p>introspectively figuring out like what really makes you complete. And I mean, not to get too</p>
<p>syrupy about it, but it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve also lost the script on. So, when you put all of</p>
<p>these things together, there&rsquo;s just a bunch of people that sit on the sidelines. They either</p>
<p>are too scared to enter the arena, or they don&rsquo;t want to enter the arena. They don&rsquo;t want the</p>
<p>failure that comes from it, because they&rsquo;ve grown up in a culture where, you know, they had the</p>
<p>kindergarten soccer ball handed to them, the gold star in everything they&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>
<p>Participation trophy.</p>
<p>And now what we really need are people in the arena more than ever, folks trying and failing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s okay. And there&rsquo;s just not enough of them. What instead is, there&rsquo;s just a lot of</p>
<p>people who just want to bitch and complain. And I think this is the backlash to the</p>
<p>Meghan Markle interview is that this miscasting that this is an extremely privileged person or,</p>
<p>you know, Harry and Meghan both are very privileged. And, but I think what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to do by making all these sort of accusations of racism against their own</p>
<p>family is they&rsquo;re trying to ground that privilege in victim status. And this is the thing about</p>
<p>privilege is privilege is a social concept. It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with success, which is either</p>
<p>earned or unearned. And so, the way that people get to maintain their privileges is that, again,</p>
<p>they grounded in some sort of victimization. It creates these very perverse incentives.</p>
<p>My reaction to the Meghan Markle, Prince Harry interview was the following. I had a lot of</p>
<p>sympathy for what she was saying. But on the other side, I also thought,</p>
<p>you must have known what you were getting into on the way in. And there was, it was, and look,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this as a Canadian and a Sri Lankan. So, the Queen and the monarchy is an increase,</p>
<p>like, I can&rsquo;t describe to you guys, because you&rsquo;re not part of the Commonwealth. But</p>
<p>it is just a definitional part of who we are as we grow up. And I don&rsquo;t know what the equivalent</p>
<p>American construct is. I guess there isn&rsquo;t one really. And so, you know, the monarchy is an</p>
<p>incredibly important thing. But we all know that it&rsquo;s this kind of like, anachronistic</p>
<p>thing that just kind of, I don&rsquo;t look for us, it&rsquo;s not bullshit. Like, I mean, like,</p>
<p>if you said to me, despite all my bullshit, and raging against the machine and society,</p>
<p>and blah, blah, blah, and stature, whatever. If I could be invited to meet the Queen, I would be</p>
<p>there in eight nanoseconds. I think the equivalent is the presidency, we actually feel that way about</p>
<p>the presidency, like going to visit the President is a big deal.</p>
<p>The presidency is not an endowed kind of circumstance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about there&rsquo;s something about the Queen. My point is, though,</p>
<p>we all know a that it&rsquo;s important. It&rsquo;s a great symbol of the Commonwealth. I&rsquo;m very proud of all</p>
<p>of that. But we also know it&rsquo;s anachronistic, and it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. And so what,</p>
<p>what do you what do you think you were marrying into? And I think, you know, my perspective was,</p>
<p>I felt bad for I can&rsquo;t believe, you know, it got to the place where, like, people wouldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>help for her when she was sick. And, you know, and then they were questioning Harry&rsquo;s or the kids,</p>
<p>Archie&rsquo;s skin color. I mean, this is insanity, like these people are stuck in the 1800s. But</p>
<p>then you realize they are actually stuck in the 1800s, because they&rsquo;re not allowed to have a</p>
<p>normal life. They&rsquo;re not allowed to actually interact. So, you know, are they at fault? Or</p>
<p>they or is the system that creates these sort of like voyeuristic, you know, exotic animals in a</p>
<p>zoo that we call the king, the queen, these princes, is the system at fault? I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I was kind of like 5050 on the interview. But my perspective was, the monarchy is in a really tough</p>
<p>spot over the next 30 or 40 years. Because again, so now let me tell you where my belief is. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>kind of a little bummed by the whole thing. The monarchy doesn&rsquo;t mean what it what it what it</p>
<p>used to mean for me.</p>
<p>David, what&rsquo;s what was more enthralling to you this week,</p>
<p>Tucker versus Taylor or the Queen versus Oprah and Prince Henry?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t spend, I didn&rsquo;t spend a tremendous amount of time on either one. I mean,</p>
<p>look, I, if I were, if I were Harry, I would probably do the same thing, which is to basically</p>
<p>leave. Look, the first thing I did my career was quit the firm, right? You know, who wants to work</p>
<p>for a firm? You know, it&rsquo;s very tracked. So I don&rsquo;t blame him leaving, going to California,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s what we that&rsquo;s what we all did, right? I mean, he was being it&rsquo;s a very,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very entrepreneurial American thing to do. What I what I had a problem with was the way</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re attacking their own family, because they&rsquo;re being paid $7 million to do this interview.</p>
<p>No, no, no, hold on. They were not, there was the first question Oprah asked,</p>
<p>and they were very clear they were not getting paid. Now, they did sign.</p>
<p>Who made the 7 million?</p>
<p>No, Oprah did. Harpo did.</p>
<p>Oh, well, she&rsquo;s a genius.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s a genius. No, let&rsquo;s just be clear. Oprah is our queen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the queen of America. Oprah is the queen. Oprah figured out a way to get paid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse. It&rsquo;s even worse if they did the interview for free and didn&rsquo;t even get a</p>
<p>piece of the back end. So all they did was attack and besmirch their family for none of that. And</p>
<p>look, I guess my point is, so why would they do it if it&rsquo;s not even about the money? I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about this idea of defining their privilege, grounding it in victim status. And I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something very fake and phony about that. And I think that&rsquo;s why people had this reaction</p>
<p>to it, where, frankly, they were, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re on the side of the royal family, because</p>
<p>it is outdated. But I think there was a lot of skepticism towards what Harry and Meghan were saying.</p>
<p>I had a little bit of a problem with the, like, live from our $15 million Montecito mansion.</p>
<p>No, Jason, stop, stop.</p>
<p>Our victimhood.</p>
<p>Who paid for that house?</p>
<p>They have a $15 million house. I know, but they also have a $15 million house next to Oprah.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s public. They put $5 million down and they took out a mortgage.</p>
<p>Someone listed this whole thing.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s an honest question. Do the taxpayers of the UK fund the princes?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s the whole point. They went and did a deal with Netflix and Spotify,</p>
<p>and now they have a salary. And they&rsquo;re making money like everybody else. So I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t have an issue with any of that.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t have an issue with that. I thought the taxpayers were, funded the lifestyle.</p>
<p>They do fund the lifestyle of the other princes, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Can we talk about something important?</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay. So a Beeple NFT sold for $69 million.</p>
<p>I mean, this week, this week was crazy. All the dumbest shit happened this week.</p>
<p>Taylor Lorenz getting, you know, slaughtered on.</p>
<p>Welcome to this week of dumb shit.</p>
<p>So I miss Tucker versus Taylor, but actually the person who took on Taylor that did a brilliant job</p>
<p>was Glenn Greenwald. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys read his post, but that was brilliant.</p>
<p>Savage.</p>
<p>Brilliant. And basically what he said is that, look, you&rsquo;ve got these class of reporters out</p>
<p>there who their job is to go out and they&rsquo;re like little hall monitors, you know, trying to bust</p>
<p>people for whatever they might say in a clubhouse room, not just public figures, but private people</p>
<p>too. They&rsquo;re in the business of destroying lives and reputations, you know, that&rsquo;s basically their</p>
<p>business model. But then the second, anyone has any criticism for them, they claim it&rsquo;s harassment,</p>
<p>which is just absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s funny is the only person that was inoculated against social justice,</p>
<p>wokeness to write that article is Glenn Greenwald because he is, you know, he&rsquo;s gay,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got brown kids, he lives in Brazil, you know, with, I mean, it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>irresistible force moving the immovable, meeting the immovable object.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not completely immune because he was attacked, you know, and people said pretty</p>
<p>nasty things about him. But yeah, he definitely has some.</p>
<p>I think Greenwald is an unbelievable writer who calls it like he sees it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with everything he says all the time. But, you know, he&rsquo;s right to call this</p>
<p>stuff out. There was another bunch of social justice nonsense this week as well. This poor</p>
<p>guy had to like give out this crazy apology tweet because he said he liked to exercise.</p>
<p>What happened? Wait, what is that story?</p>
<p>OK, this is the greatest. OK, there&rsquo;s a kid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been telling you, Jason, I want you to exercise because I love you.</p>
<p>I lost 20 pounds. Look at me. I&rsquo;m looking pretty good.</p>
<p>I want it. Yeah, I want both of you guys to exercise.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>By the way, public service announcement. COVID vaccine CA is the bot. So at COVID vaccine,</p>
<p>it just tweets every five minutes, a hundred different places. You can go</p>
<p>pretend to be a door dash driver and get a shot. Sorry. I mean,</p>
<p>if you were vaccinated, check a box, check a box. Let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s roll people.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let Newsome take away your health.</p>
<p>Yeah. Don&rsquo;t let Newsome put you in a noose.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t focus on equity.</p>
<p>Yeah. Meanwhile, he&rsquo;s at like French Laundry.</p>
<p>Jason, tell us about this tweet thing. What happened?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kid named Dom. He&rsquo;s an entrepreneur. He&rsquo;s building a company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good company. It&rsquo;s funded by Stripe. You know, it&rsquo;s raised hundreds of millions</p>
<p>of dollars. Like good for this guy.</p>
<p>Yeah. But he likes to like, you know, he&rsquo;s kind of like trying to engage on Twitter. And he</p>
<p>basically said, I feel so much better and I&rsquo;m performing at such a higher level since I got</p>
<p>my diet and my exercise. Right. I mean, people who are not getting their physical right are</p>
<p>really underperforming at work. It&rsquo;s such an opportunity or whatever. And then, you know,</p>
<p>the the large and in charge, you know, fat is beautiful, you know, contingent,</p>
<p>basically tried to cancel him.</p>
<p>Sorry, wait, wait, but but did he say that you have to be skinny?</p>
<p>No, he just said you will perform if you&rsquo;re fat, you&rsquo;re underperforming. Basically,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t use the word fat. But he said, if you&rsquo;re not in shape, you&rsquo;re underperforming at work,</p>
<p>which I said, Is there science behind this? And yeah, sure. People show me 100 studies that show</p>
<p>if you lose weight, you have better concentration and focus. I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious.</p>
<p>But he did the cardinal sin as here here, I&rsquo;ll read you the tweet, an important lesson I learned</p>
<p>well into my career, if you are not physically fit and healthy, then you are underperforming at work,</p>
<p>pretty basic, probably not very controversial. But he did what David Sachs always advises.</p>
<p>And the the the advice he gave to Trump, which is never apologize. And he apologized,</p>
<p>Dom apologized and took the tweet down, which then the mob really went after him.</p>
<p>And he said, I screwed up. And I&rsquo;m extremely sorry. I have recently spent a lot of energy</p>
<p>focused on my fitness, eating and sleep in my enthusiasm for my new fitness regime.</p>
<p>I posted a tweet that was meant to celebrate my new healthy lifestyle. But that&rsquo;s not how it came</p>
<p>across. And I see now how sensitive I mean, with all the with all the problems that we have</p>
<p>that need fixing. I mean, this is what people were focused on this. But here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the kicker of the apology. This is something I really need to improve on. And I will.</p>
<p>Well, no, I&rsquo;m not making fun of him. I just think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what the hell is going on. But I mean, don&rsquo;t apologize. If you believe being healthier is,</p>
<p>you know, good, then you should say it. And you know, we&rsquo;ll let the chips roll with it.</p>
<p>People can debate it. But I mean, can we have a debate about that? Because this is in the</p>
<p>middle of a COVID crisis, when the top two vectors are age and obesity, period.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fat, you die from COVID. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>And you got both those problems.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re old and fat.</p>
<p>You guys didn&rsquo;t say stupid. All right, I&rsquo;m doing good today.</p>
<p>All right, today in all in nonsense, apparently, there&rsquo;s so much money in the system,</p>
<p>that an NFT just sold for $69 million. After we talked about the previous one,</p>
<p>Bill Lee bought for $6 million. I don&rsquo;t know that he bought it for $6 million.</p>
<p>But somebody bought one last week. NFTs seem like a real thing. It&rsquo;s reasonable to trade stuff,</p>
<p>but $69 million.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredible. I mean, like, like the I saw the breakdown of like the number of bidders</p>
<p>here, let me actually just get this data up. Because I think you guys will find it really</p>
<p>incredible.</p>
<p>My thesis on this, or my theory, rather, is that there are a bunch of people who have</p>
<p>stakes in these crypto assets. And then they all premeditate decide to buy up these NFTs to get</p>
<p>the market started. And then once it started, like, you know, other people do with art, right?</p>
<p>You know this, but I&rsquo;ve been buying art for a decade plus. And this is exactly how it works</p>
<p>in the art market. You know, we go in there, certain people will go and buy. And then what</p>
<p>the gallerist says is, Oh, did you know that Chamath just bought this piece or such and such</p>
<p>a person bought this other piece, and then all of a sudden, the price spins up, and then they feed</p>
<p>into it. I mean, this is where, you know, an enormous amount of money has been made by gallerists</p>
<p>over the last 20 or 30 years. Now it just happens in a different medium. So the bidding breakdown,</p>
<p>by the way, of this NFT is incredible. 33 active bidders, 91% of the bidders were new to Christie&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>55% came from the Americas, 27% of bidders were from Europe, and 18% were in Asia.</p>
<p>The age breakdown is the most interesting. 6% were Gen Z, so 97 to 2012. 58% of bidders were</p>
<p>millennials, born between 81 and 96. Wow. 33% Gen Xers and 3% baby boomers. So this is really</p>
<p>like a transitional change in, you know, basically deciding what&rsquo;s valuable. And I don&rsquo;t think this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this was any different than, you know, when you had this transition from,</p>
<p>you know, sort of impressionist in the art world, like if you moved from the body of work,</p>
<p>where, you know, these impressionist paintings were just going for</p>
<p>high 10s, low hundreds of millions of dollars, and I think it peaked around Van Gogh.</p>
<p>And then, you know, basically, it went from there off of a cliff, where you can basically give away</p>
<p>impressionist paintings, and everything went to contemporary and, you know, sort of like this</p>
<p>postmodern stuff. And that was a decisional change by boomers. What does give away mean to you,</p>
<p>Chamath? You know, 10s of millions. So I think on the NFT stuff, and Beeple,</p>
<p>Beeple is the artist, there&rsquo;s two things going on, right? So one is on a technology level,</p>
<p>NFTs, non fungible tokens, they are, it&rsquo;s a legitimate technology for creating provenance</p>
<p>on a blockchain. You know, if a piece of art, basically gets put on a blockchain,</p>
<p>you have perfect provenance. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that all NFTs are valuable. In fact,</p>
<p>most of them won&rsquo;t be. It&rsquo;s just a technology. Then you have the other thing that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is on an art level, what these sort of, these sort of prestige galleries, and so on,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying that Beeple is now a major artist. And there&rsquo;s and the reason someone becomes a</p>
<p>major artist is because they usher in like, or become representative of some new wave of art,</p>
<p>like Chamath is saying, you&rsquo;ve got impressionism, you&rsquo;ve got modernism. I mean, the reason why</p>
<p>Jackson Pollock sells for whatever $100 million. No, no, 300 to 600.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s because he represents an important wave in art. And some of those waves fizzle out,</p>
<p>and they turn into Ponzi schemes, and some of them become real. And people are speculating that this</p>
<p>digital art will be a major wave. And they&rsquo;re saying that Beeple is the most important artist,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of betting on that. Now, do I think it&rsquo;s gonna last? I don&rsquo;t know. I mean,</p>
<p>hard to say. No, you said the key thing, though, the key feature of NFTs, which I think is amazing</p>
<p>is that you can actually have ownership and provenance written into a blockchain. Now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve take that abstraction, you can apply to all kinds of surface areas, and it makes a ton</p>
<p>of sense. Any kind of other asset would make sense if you own a car, if you own clothes,</p>
<p>if you own watches, if you own wine, what happens if you own a house? Now, all of a sudden, if you</p>
<p>can prove ownership over this stuff, not only can you trade it, but you can also borrow against it.</p>
<p>And I think that that is a really interesting idea where once you financialize all of these</p>
<p>physical assets that we own, you do eliminate an enormous amount of inequality in the system,</p>
<p>because you can actually get real transparent pricing. Now, could you-</p>
<p>Yeah, blockchains are a ledger, right? They&rsquo;re a perfect ledger system. And so,</p>
<p>every type of possession that relies on title should eventually be blockchained. So, art&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good example. You know, I helped found a company back in 2017 called Harbor, which was a blockchaining</p>
<p>real estate, and it ended up getting acquired. So, now-</p>
<p>Acquired or aquired?</p>
<p>No, it got acquired. We&rsquo;re gonna-</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, Chamath, we&rsquo;re gonna make money. We&rsquo;re gonna make money.</p>
<p>As an LP, I just wanted a clarification.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, we&rsquo;re not gonna make like SPAC type money, but we&rsquo;ll make a little bit of money on</p>
<p>that deal. So, don&rsquo;t worry. But yeah, look, I think we&rsquo;re in the early, early stages of this</p>
<p>type of technology. You&rsquo;re gonna see eventually blockchaining of every type of asset where title</p>
<p>is important.</p>
<p>David, I think that this is such an amazing idea, because like, if you think of all of the opaque</p>
<p>lending markets where people can&rsquo;t get access to reasonable cost of capital, and they own assets,</p>
<p>you know, you end up in these crazy worlds where like, if you look at the housing crisis,</p>
<p>or the great financial crisis, you know, there was like so much crazy lending,</p>
<p>but behind that lending was like double, triple mortgages. It&rsquo;s happening right now in the car</p>
<p>market. All of that stuff doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to exist, because if you have clear provenance</p>
<p>and the ability to price risk, you just get, you know, people can borrow a reasonable amount of</p>
<p>money at a reasonable rate and pay it back. And, you know, you can trade assets, you could sell</p>
<p>assets. It&rsquo;s a really big deal, I think.</p>
<p>I think, if you take a zoom out on the, you know, the notion of what an NFT represents, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t feel too dissimilar from other, what I would argue is like non productive assets,</p>
<p>like if you think about where one&rsquo;s capital goes, where an individual puts their capital,</p>
<p>the first thing is kind of essentials, right, things you need, like food and medicine and</p>
<p>housing and clothing and whatnot. And then you kind of enter into these kind of, you know,</p>
<p>non extent, you know, kind of discretionary spending for a consumer, you know, nice stuff,</p>
<p>nice clothes, luxury goods, things that are basically going to diminish. Then, as you think</p>
<p>about allocating the leftover capital, you&rsquo;re either going to allocate your leftover capital</p>
<p>into investable assets that are either productive or non productive. A productive asset is something</p>
<p>you buy that you expect to return, it produces some value for you as you own it, such as owning</p>
<p>a home where you get the value of living in it or owning a car where you get the utility of driving</p>
<p>around in it, or owning a bond, which issues a, you know, a, you know, a coupon or a stock that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to, you know, generate cash flows at some point in the future, theoretically, the non</p>
<p>productive assets are these assets that are just not designed to do that. But they&rsquo;re a store of</p>
<p>value that you expect at some point to realize some return, you know, because someone else will</p>
<p>pay a higher price to you for that non productive asset, this is like a piece of art, or, you know,</p>
<p>some piece of gold or something, you know, something that you kind of hold, or, you know,</p>
<p>more increasingly, you know, digital assets. And it seems like the explosion in digital assets is,</p>
<p>you know, as Jason pointed out at the beginning, like, as we&rsquo;ve kind of moved to a highly kind of</p>
<p>overvalued segment of productive assets, as things that market is very frothy, it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to kind of find productive assets that are worth putting capital into, there&rsquo;s continually more</p>
<p>interest in non productive assets across the board, because there&rsquo;s excess capital in the system.</p>
<p>And it turns out that when that happens, there&rsquo;s enough of a market dynamic that emerges in non</p>
<p>productive assets, it gives people a reason to put their capital in and expect to have a return</p>
<p>on them in the future. As soon as the market starts shrinking, as soon as you know, you start</p>
<p>having effects that are deflationary, your money will pour out of that market. In general, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always what happens with the art market and has for hundreds of years. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>digital means of kind of realizing that same market transition. My question is, do you get</p>
<p>the rights? I guess this is a dependent on the terms that are set in the smart contract. But in</p>
<p>the case of the people, if I were to buy for 69 million, do I have the rights to it so that I can</p>
<p>print t shirts and sell $100 t shirts? What can I create 10,000? That&rsquo;s a good question. I monetize</p>
<p>it is what I&rsquo;m asking. That&rsquo;s a great, great, great question. I don&rsquo;t know. But that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fabulous question, by the way, because the alternative, like, as you pointed out, the</p>
<p>artist and and other folks have rights to art. Even though the original painting is what sold,</p>
<p>you know, the original master of a Bruce Springsteen song could be sold to a collector.</p>
<p>But the rights the rights on that track for reproducing it making money off it are owned</p>
<p>by a publishing house, you can own the physical magnetic tape, yeah, not own the rights to</p>
<p>exploit and over time, those rights fall away. So if you think about what that NFT represents,</p>
<p>it represents that particular chain of electrons. And you know, this is this is these bite these</p>
<p>bits that represent this image. And it&rsquo;s not necessarily make 100 more. And then he could</p>
<p>change one pixel, theoretically, or two pixels, and he could go print a bunch of stuff and go</p>
<p>not really, because those images were ones that he had, he had this rhythm of creating like one</p>
<p>a day, I think, for a very long period of time. And he contributed them all into this master,</p>
<p>right? Exactly. So there&rsquo;s a this is a it&rsquo;s a one of one another interesting</p>
<p>one of one that just happened was these performance artists, or I guess, like underground</p>
<p>digital artists bought a Banksy for 125 million or $125,000. I get 1000s and millions confused.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a joke. You want to use for this episode is hashtag cancel Chamath. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah. Good luck. Good luck.</p>
<p>Anyways, these four guys bought bought this Banksy for $125,000. They brought it to a</p>
<p>warehouse in Brooklyn. They took a high res image of it. Okay, so they took a picture of it.</p>
<p>And they created a one of one NFT, right? Okay, then they created a YouTube video of them burning</p>
<p>the original Banksy. Oh, so now all you had was the digital manifestation of this physical thing,</p>
<p>wait for it. And then they sold it for 300 and like $50,000. So they three x their money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most incredible story. I can find the link and I&rsquo;ll put I&rsquo;ll put it in the show notes</p>
<p>as well. But it just shows you what&rsquo;s happening. And then I also think last thing on NFTs I saw</p>
<p>that I think was like Kings of Leon just put out an album and it was like it&rsquo;s like 50 bucks.</p>
<p>For a song or something like that. And it comes with like a bunch of interesting content. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the beginning of something guys, I just think that you need sort of like popular content to get</p>
<p>this movement going. But it seems to me like this is what people want to do. They want to own digital</p>
<p>assets, they want to have provenance, they want to have custodial relationships, but that they</p>
<p>want to basically, but it&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s like art and posters, right? Anyone can put the poster</p>
<p>up in their room, anyone can buy a copy for five bucks, but who owns the original and owning the</p>
<p>original may be visually identical, maybe graphically identical. But it is truly about</p>
<p>that notion of that that theoretical human mind construct of ownership that creates that distinction</p>
<p>and you just effectively have to count on other human minds believing the same thing in the future</p>
<p>for you to be able to reclaim that value, that monetary value, or you&rsquo;re going to take a loss</p>
<p>on it. I mean, Chamath, have you ever sold art that you bought? You know, I&rsquo;ve sold very little.</p>
<p>I tend to buy and accumulate with this idea of eventually endowing something with just because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you know, I think there are two ways to buy art. One is speculatively and the other</p>
<p>one is to tell a story. I took the second path. And so, you know, it&rsquo;s stuff that means a lot to</p>
<p>me. So, it&rsquo;s hard for me to part with it, even though it sits in a free port in Delaware. So,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not exactly, you know, out and about with this idea that at some points, people will get</p>
<p>to really enjoy it once. By the way, I mean, one of the things that happens in the art world</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m wrong on this, but you buy this art and you don&rsquo;t ever, a lot of art doesn&rsquo;t get resold.</p>
<p>So, everyone kind of buys it under the notion that it&rsquo;s going to be worth more in the future,</p>
<p>and they can sell it for more. But very few people actually do end up selling it.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s it. So, here&rsquo;s the great thing.</p>
<p>In the trading market, right? But like, I mean, generally, like a lot of collectors end up</p>
<p>endowing art or gifting it. And when you gift it, you get an appraisal done and you get a</p>
<p>deduction on the appraised value, right? And so, You can definitely do it that way. So,</p>
<p>one interesting story is that one of the large auction houses has a financial arm.</p>
<p>And the most incredible thing is like over like the last 50 years,</p>
<p>their cumulative default rate was 30 basis points on their book. Like, cumulatively, not like a year</p>
<p>or a month, but ever. Nobody defaults.</p>
<p>Because they borrow money for the purposes of maybe buying other things or whatever. And then</p>
<p>they will very, you know, trade out of things and trade up to things and trade across things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very vibrant market of buying and selling. It just happens to be very informal,</p>
<p>and a little bit closed, and very much for insiders. And, you know, another reason that I</p>
<p>think that NFTs will change because it will change this is that it just makes it available to</p>
<p>everybody. Because you put all art on a very level playing field. And really, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>what is art? It&rsquo;s a commentary on society. And I think that having that level of transparency</p>
<p>on that kind of stuff is, I think is going to be really valuable because you don&rsquo;t want one or two</p>
<p>people who you fundamentally disagree with as being a tastemaker for a kind of art that you</p>
<p>think is fundamentally flawed, right? You&rsquo;d rather it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s no different than being</p>
<p>able to go to 95 different media sites to read the content you want, or, you know, being able</p>
<p>to listen to 1000 different kinds of music. All of it in its totality is a commentary on society.</p>
<p>And I think what society says is we want transparency, we want choice. And</p>
<p>this is where I think, like, that&rsquo;s why I think this is a good, a good dovetail into</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening with the stimulus bill, and where we started, which was is this even necessary?</p>
<p>We have stimulus checks going out in the amount of $2,000 per individual in households with under</p>
<p>150k, I believe is the income level, which means people who were not impacted by financially,</p>
<p>in any way by what&rsquo;s happened to under COVID are going to get in a family of 5 $10,000 checks,</p>
<p>even if nobody was laid off, or that&rsquo;s only that&rsquo;s only like 9% of the bill, Jason.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so it was, it was 450 million out of 1.9 trillion.</p>
<p>So what do we think the impact? We have a working theory? Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Jason.</p>
<p>What are your general thoughts on this? Is it necessary? And then to what&rsquo;s the what are the</p>
<p>second order effects that we each predict will happen over the next 18 months when all of this</p>
<p>capital gets injected? So the latter is what I&rsquo;ve been focused on trying to figure out. And</p>
<p>I saw some really interesting data, which basically, I&rsquo;ll ask you guys a question,</p>
<p>because maybe you guys know the answer. But if you measure wealth inequality, when</p>
<p>do you guys think was the most recent period where there was the least wealth inequality,</p>
<p>the least? Sorry, how do you define that? You can measure it like the Gini index,</p>
<p>or you can measure it as like, you know, the gap between the top decile and the bottom decile,</p>
<p>in terms of wealth and accumulated assets? Well, would it be before the robber barons?</p>
<p>No, it was the robber barons. And now, the period of the least inequality in</p>
<p>recent history was in the late 70s, which is an incredible stat to say where the gap between the</p>
<p>top decile and the bottom decile was like, you know, kind of like, on an index, like 6065.</p>
<p>Whereas today, it&rsquo;s sort of like at 100. Now, what happened then? And it&rsquo;s this is really</p>
<p>interesting. Wasn&rsquo;t that an inflationary period? There you go. So what happened? And as it turns</p>
<p>out, inflation is a phenomenal way to decrease levels of playing field. Absolutely. It decreases</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s richness. So it makes rich people poor. That&rsquo;s really the most effective tool that you</p>
<p>have to recalibrate, it&rsquo;s very, very hard to redistribute money. And I think every attempt</p>
<p>at doing that has largely failed. But the one consistent way and if you go back periods before</p>
<p>that, you know, into the beginning of the but in an inflationary environment, borrowing costs go up.</p>
<p>So, you know, businesses and people that rely on borrowing to grow their net worth or investing</p>
<p>assets to grow their net worth kind of suffer more than people that would have a home have a,</p>
<p>you know, wages go up in an inflationary environment, right?</p>
<p>Wages go up, which which actually, if you think about like, what you said before, like, you know,</p>
<p>as people get wealthier, they move their money into, you know, essentially financial assets and</p>
<p>away from sort of like working assets. And when you know, interest rates go up, and the risk free</p>
<p>rate goes up, then the attractiveness of those assets go down. Yeah. And so what happens is</p>
<p>shares and technology companies go down. But what what actually also happens is that you your cost</p>
<p>of capital for a traditional business, because it&rsquo;s higher, they have to then charge more,</p>
<p>which means that they&rsquo;re paying their employees more. And those folks, on a marginal basis,</p>
<p>tend to then, you know, take those dollars and spend those dollars. So inflation is this very</p>
<p>productive mechanism of actually redistributing wealth and actually homeowners benefit,</p>
<p>homeowners benefit as well. But like, you know, it shrinks, it shrinks the wealth,</p>
<p>you know, mild, mild inflation, mild inflation is probably good. It&rsquo;s better than</p>
<p>probably deflation. But if it tips over into hyperinflation, then it destroys everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>savings. Right? And rich people have the ability to protect their assets against inflation a lot</p>
<p>better than middle class people do. So you know, you look at like Venezuela, we are Germany,</p>
<p>hyperinflation. Yeah, people just hyperinflation destroyed the value of, of,</p>
<p>where are we seeing inflation? Where do we anticipate we&rsquo;ll see inflation? I saw today</p>
<p>Tesla&rsquo;s Tesla raised the price on all their cars except for two, they have to because the inputs</p>
<p>of you know, if you think about like, if you break down a Tesla, and you look at where the money</p>
<p>goes, the money really is in the batteries. And if you break down the batteries, it goes into three</p>
<p>critical inputs, lithium, nickel and cobalt, and the prices are highly suspect. And they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very poorly predicted. And so the cost of Tesla&rsquo;s are going to go up by 20 or 30%.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing that there&rsquo;s nothing that Tesla could do.</p>
<p>And by the way, you&rsquo;ll see this across all commodity products, if inflation takes hold in a</p>
<p>meaningful way, including, you know, food products, ag products, you know, all commodities, you know,</p>
<p>metals, but the businesses that will benefit the most, and this is really interesting from a</p>
<p>technology perspective, and I think it played in part, my understanding is speaking to a number</p>
<p>of PMs about this portfolio managers at funds is that, you know, technology companies don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>lot of hard assets. And so they have less kind of, you know, value accretion, and they don&rsquo;t play in</p>
<p>a commodity supply chain. So it&rsquo;s much more difficult for a technology company to say raise</p>
<p>rates by 30%. Whereas a food company can raise rates by 30%. One of the ways to look at this is</p>
<p>to look at the, you know, the book value or the capex, you know, property, plant and equipment</p>
<p>of a business and businesses that have a lot of pp&amp;e are generally going to do better in an</p>
<p>inflationary environment, they&rsquo;re going to have more throughput on that pp&amp;e, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have higher dollars per unit of pp&amp;e. And so you&rsquo;ll see, you know, this is why there was a shift of</p>
<p>dollars into what are traditionally called kind of value stocks, or, you know, kind of bigger</p>
<p>industrial companies away from, you know, softer kind of tech companies, which don&rsquo;t really really</p>
<p>benefit from this inflationary trend. And so there&rsquo;s going to be, you know, some sort of play</p>
<p>out in those sorts of products, probably more J. Calvin, I think, do we see it in SAS, because I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>noticed that SAS prices are going up, and that people are just keep adding to the price of the</p>
<p>SAS price, I was pricing out all the virtual conference, you know, stuff like hop in and all</p>
<p>that Aramid and whatever. And I was just shocked at how much they wanted to charge, you know, 1550</p>
<p>$100,000 a year. And I was like, but can I use like zoom in this for that, you know, in a chat</p>
<p>room, slack room? And are we going to see it happen in SAS, where people are going to start raising</p>
<p>the prices and just increase their profit margin, because their employees are going to demand more</p>
<p>money, because they&rsquo;re part of this cycle. I think that&rsquo;s a function of pricing power</p>
<p>going up for SAS companies, they become more established and entrenched.</p>
<p>Those companies are very profitable, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re experiencing wage pressure in any way.</p>
<p>I think that they&rsquo;re just becoming more successful, their pricing power is going up as they become</p>
<p>not necessarily monopolist, but as they have more market share, and they dominate their categories,</p>
<p>they can increase prices. But I want to go back to this idea of the 1970s. So I want to,</p>
<p>I want to challenge the idea that the US economy was doing well in the 1970s. So Chamath mentioned</p>
<p>the Gini index, there was a different kind of metric called the misery index,</p>
<p>that was was a much more popular index that was used around that time. And the misery index,</p>
<p>it was defined by a Brookings economist. And it was basically the sum of the unemployment rate</p>
<p>and the inflation rate. And in 1980, the misery index was 19.7%. This is why Ronald Reagan</p>
<p>got elected is because you had a CPI, which the inflation rate of 12.5%. And then you had</p>
<p>unemployment of another 7.2%. On top of that, and you know, the 1970s were, especially the late</p>
<p>70s were an economic disaster for the country. So maybe things were more nominally equal,</p>
<p>but everyone was equally more equally poor. And what you saw in the 1980s is that they got,</p>
<p>you know, inflation under control. Paul Volcker at the Fed broke inflation, that lowered interest</p>
<p>rates enormously allowed people to buy homes, the stock market went up. And, you know, it was an</p>
<p>economic boom. So I don&rsquo;t know that this idea that we want to introduce a lot of inflation into the</p>
<p>system is a good idea. Like I said, I think mild inflation of say, 2% is better than 2% deflation</p>
<p>the other way. But, but I think we should be very careful here about, about inflation and making</p>
<p>sure it doesn&rsquo;t get out of control. And the other index to look at is the quality of life index,</p>
<p>which is typically, you know, healthcare, and then the property price to your income ratio,</p>
<p>commuting, pollution, safety, and those kinds of things. And, you know, the United States is</p>
<p>15th on that list, with obviously the Nordics and Australia, Germany, New Zealand, just being</p>
<p>at the top of those rankings in America, I never really thought about that, right? We don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>even discuss well, I mean, yes, you know, and that, and that quotient, we don&rsquo;t index for that</p>
<p>happiness and low stress. I think we&rsquo;re talking a lot about quality of life in San Francisco now,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a community that&rsquo;s very rich. And yet it&rsquo;s a miserable city to live in because crime</p>
<p>is out of control. You know, Jason, you and I have been focusing on this DA, Chase Abuden,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s had an enormous impact on people&rsquo;s quality of life, because he&rsquo;s simply not prosecuting</p>
<p>theft in the city. There&rsquo;s actually, it was a crazy tweet where a city council member</p>
<p>was inside City Hall calling for a hearing on the rampant rise in theft in the city. And meanwhile,</p>
<p>his car was broken into right outside City Hall. I mean, you can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.</p>
<p>And then the other thing that came out were a whole series of statistics about crime in San</p>
<p>Francisco showing, or sorry, trials and convictions. Basically, Chase has not been conducting any</p>
<p>trials. He hasn&rsquo;t been convicting anyone. It turns out that the number of trials and convictions that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gotten in the 14 months he&rsquo;s been DA is one-tenth of what Gascon got when he was DA.</p>
<p>And by the way, Gascon is not the model DA or anything. I mean, Gascon is facing a recall in LA</p>
<p>for dereliction of duty, and he&rsquo;s still 10 times more productive than Chase Abuden.</p>
<p>Just a quick update. Many of you, when I mentioned the GoFundMe to put a journalist on Chesa,</p>
<p>if you just type in GoFundMe Chesa, C-H-E-S-A, into the Google, we added $8,000 since last week.</p>
<p>So we have $58,000 that&rsquo;s going to a journalist and a data journalist to cover this exact issue.</p>
<p>So thanks to the folks who donated. I&rsquo;m not taking any money from it. I&rsquo;m donating, obviously.</p>
<p>Other than a small finder&rsquo;s fee.</p>
<p>No, $0. I&rsquo;m donating to it. I basically said I&rsquo;ll be 1% of it, whatever the final number is.</p>
<p>I think the Marina Times has done a great job with this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been a couple other sources as well, but how dishonest was it? I mean,</p>
<p>this has been a recurring theme on the pod, so I just want to touch on it.</p>
<p>Chesa sent his little mouthpiece, his little minion, the high school friend,</p>
<p>to go out and challenge us, writing that blog post, saying that it was a lie,</p>
<p>that Chesa wasn&rsquo;t prosecuting anybody. And lo and behold, the numbers have come out.</p>
<p>He tried to claim that Chesa had the same rate of charging that Gascon did. And that was true.</p>
<p>But the problem is he&rsquo;s been pleading down all these charges. He&rsquo;s not taking anyone to trial.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not convicting anyone. He&rsquo;s certainly not locking anybody up. So, I mean, what a lie that</p>
<p>was. Well, and criminals are just so savvy that they actually understand what the chances are</p>
<p>of them actually getting convicted, and they shape their grift and their crime to whatever</p>
<p>the environment they&rsquo;re in is. Just like people who deal drugs, just like people who take these</p>
<p>hardcore fentanyl drugs, they just pick the market where they&rsquo;re going to be most welcome.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re not going to do it down in Palo Alto or San Mateo or Mill Valley.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to do it on Turk Street. Well, yeah. So, I think that&rsquo;s how it starts.</p>
<p>But I got to tell you, you know, I&rsquo;m in LA right now, and there was an episode,</p>
<p>like, last week at El Pastaio. Oh, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on Cannon Street in downtown Beverly Hills. The number one Italian place where</p>
<p>all the celebrities go. It&rsquo;s a great Italian place. There&rsquo;s a lot of outdoor seating.</p>
<p>There was basically a mugging of someone was just sitting at a table. Apparently,</p>
<p>they were wearing a really nice watch. And they were robbed at gunpoint in the middle,</p>
<p>you know, in the middle of the restaurant. Lunchtime, yeah.</p>
<p>Lunchtime. And then there was a struggle over the gun. I don&rsquo;t know why the guy just didn&rsquo;t hand</p>
<p>over the watch. But anyway, he struggled over the gun. Four shots went off. One of them bounced</p>
<p>off the concrete and hit a woman in the leg. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>So, this is like, it&rsquo;s getting, I mean, it&rsquo;s getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Sounds like San Paolo, where they chop people&rsquo;s arms off for the watch. I mean,</p>
<p>they literally will drive by, apparently, and just cut your arm off if they can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t give them the watch. Well, I just, you know,</p>
<p>the criminals are starting to feel emboldened because Gascon and Boudin are not, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not having trials, they&rsquo;re not prosecuting, they&rsquo;re not locking people up. And so,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re graduating to more and more serious offenses. I&rsquo;m sure they probably didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to shoot anybody, or maybe that wasn&rsquo;t their intention. They just want to steal the watch,</p>
<p>but it resulted in a shooting, just like the deaths of Hannah Abe and Elizabeth Platt,</p>
<p>when you had, you know, Troy McAllister, you know, hit them with the car. So, I mean,</p>
<p>the fact that we&rsquo;re not locking people up is resulting in people dying and a lot of risky,</p>
<p>very risky behavior. All right, as we wrap here, a lot of SPACs going out. We obviously saw</p>
<p>another, I guess, Roblox was a direct listing. I&rsquo;m just curious.</p>
<p>Only underpriced by 50%.</p>
<p>Oof. Oops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same problem as the IPO, just sort of a larger quantity.</p>
<p>So, basically, what you&rsquo;re saying is Bill Gurley&rsquo;s on his headset,</p>
<p>walking around El Camino Real, calling journalists.</p>
<p>No, what I&rsquo;m saying is, what I&rsquo;m saying is, irrespective of what the goals of the direct</p>
<p>listing were, the result is the same as a traditional IPO.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Can I give a shout out to a company that David Sachs?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Oh, Pipe?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Congrats.</p>
<p>Which is an incredible company that basically, like, helps you capitalize your contracts with</p>
<p>your customers. And it&rsquo;s just basically this incredible thing that I&rsquo;m seeing. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a couple of others that do it as well. ClearBank is another one. But you can fund your company</p>
<p>non-dilutively. And at some point, I think we should actually talk about the state of the union</p>
<p>in venture. Maybe we can do that in a couple of next episodes. I have a lot of thoughts on where</p>
<p>I think venture capital is going. And when I see things like Pipe, I&rsquo;m just completely so happy</p>
<p>because I just think it&rsquo;s going to change the way in which venture investing is done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very brilliant idea. You can go to pipe.com slash twist to get 12 months free.</p>
<p>Pipe.com is a two sided marketplace. If you have reoccurring SaaS revenue, or any kind of</p>
<p>reoccurring revenue, somebody did it with a sub stack. So I think Pomp Liano, the guy who</p>
<p>pumps Bitcoin, he has a newsletter that makes whatever quarter million dollars a year.</p>
<p>He sold for 95 cents on the dollar his forward looking subscriptions for the year and bought</p>
<p>Bitcoin with it when it was at 35. So he&rsquo;s like doubling down. But if you&rsquo;re a SaaS company,</p>
<p>and we have many of them in our portfolios, you could take all of your monthly contracts,</p>
<p>sell them on the marketplace to somebody else, not Pipe. Pipe doesn&rsquo;t buy it. It&rsquo;s some other</p>
<p>financial person who says, I&rsquo;ll give you 94 cents on the dollar, give you 92 cents on the dollar,</p>
<p>give you 85 cents on the dollar. And so if you were if you have a 10 million dollar book of</p>
<p>business paying monthly, you can get that 10 million now and deploy it. But Jason,</p>
<p>I think this is a good, this is a good way to end. But I think let&rsquo;s agree that the next pod,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk, let&rsquo;s start with the future venture capital.</p>
<p>100%. I mean, it&rsquo;s changing dramatically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing dramatically. And I think these non dilutive ways of growing a company will</p>
<p>completely impact pricing, you know, pre money, post money, the amount of equity that employees</p>
<p>can and should own in these businesses. You know, what is the value of brands like, you know, it,</p>
<p>like, people will know who David Sachs is, who Harry Hurst is, people necessarily don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>care anymore. Like, you know, hey, if I&rsquo;m calling from Sequoia, what does that mean anymore?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna say who from Sequoia is called. So these are all really interesting topics that I</p>
<p>think are worth talking about. Another path is just the public markets, you know, right? I mean,</p>
<p>public markets are becoming the new late stage private market. And it&rsquo;s really, you know,</p>
<p>both the SPAC and early stage IPO and direct listing models are, are changing dramatically.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, and there&rsquo;s more speculative risk seeking in the public markets in a way that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve ever seen. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s creating an opportunity for companies that are</p>
<p>still, you know, what in a traditional kind of sense might be called, you know, early stage or</p>
<p>still businesses with a lot of risk being able to go public and, you know, kind of take their</p>
<p>companies out and let the public markets wager on, on how well they&rsquo;re going to execute and,</p>
<p>and how well they&rsquo;re going to be able to develop their product or their market. And it&rsquo;s, by the</p>
<p>way, it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve seen historically with biotech, where there&rsquo;s kind of very binary kind of</p>
<p>bets that happen, and binary outcomes, because the markets are known, and you don&rsquo;t need to kind of</p>
<p>productize or build a business around it. But now we&rsquo;re actually taking both business risk,</p>
<p>market risk, technology risk, product risk, to the public market at all stages. And I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see these, these scenarios where people will build public portfolios,</p>
<p>public, public company portfolios that will perform a lot like venture portfolios, right,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have one or two businesses, it&rsquo;ll have a 10 bagger, and, you know, a chunk that&rsquo;ll go to</p>
<p>zero and a chunk that&rsquo;ll have some modest return on them. And it&rsquo;s going to be Yeah, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be this, this tremendous learning experience, because a lot of people will put all their money</p>
<p>into one stock that they think is already been made. It&rsquo;s already it&rsquo;s already done things Netflix,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Netflix, it&rsquo;s, you know, their promise of the future is 100% certain. And the reality is</p>
<p>their promise of the future is 5% certain. And so depending on the price you&rsquo;re entering, and how</p>
<p>many of these things you buy, you could build a portfolio that could have a good return.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s going to be a lot of speculative betting and a lot of losses. And if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>diversify, you&rsquo;re going to lose a lot of money. And you know, so the question is also, how does</p>
<p>it evolve regulatory wise? Chamath, how are you communicating that to the market? Because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have some specs that go out, I would think Virgin Galactic is in that more like they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>deep tech researching phase, and then you have other ones that are already, you know, churning</p>
<p>the the ringing the register, right? So how do you communicate that to retail investors or the</p>
<p>audience? Or that&rsquo;s up to them to do the research? How do you think about that? I mean, there&rsquo;s as</p>
<p>well as the bad inventory that&rsquo;s getting added? No, look, yeah, I do a tweet storm. I do a one</p>
<p>pager, I have a multi hour detailed investor presentation that&rsquo;s taped. And then we have a</p>
<p>typically a 100 to 300 page s four. So you can ingress into finding out the true story of a</p>
<p>business at whatever point you want. It really just does come down to doing your work. I mean,</p>
<p>a lot of the folks on Twitter, you know, when you see the market straight down, and they complain,</p>
<p>my reaction is stop crying and do your own work. And there isn&rsquo;t like we have complete</p>
<p>transparency in this process. So it is up to people to do their job. And the thing that I</p>
<p>think is happening right now is people think that they don&rsquo;t have to do a job and that money is free.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s hard to make it. It&rsquo;s hard to make good investments. It&rsquo;s hard to build a</p>
<p>company. Everything is hard. Nothing is really easy. Because if it was easy, everybody would</p>
<p>be doing it all the time. And so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I would love to leave people with. I really</p>
<p>got to go guys. I love you guys. Let&rsquo;s start with venture capital next week. Yeah. Love you,</p>
<p>boys. Free Davids. Love you. Love you, Davids. Love you guys. I love you. I love you. I love</p>
<p>you. I do love you. I mean, we love each other. And we can say it. And then the guys on this side.</p>
<p>Love you. They&rsquo;re working on my guys. Look at Jake out dragging it out. Stop dragging</p>
<p>everything out. We&rsquo;re dragging it out because we love you, David. We&rsquo;ll see y&rsquo;all next time. Bye.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a bender on these red pills.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a bender on these red pills.</p>
<p>Boy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to go. I need more. I need more red pills. What a joke. Give me those red pills</p>
<p>from Miami. David gave me just a huge bag of red pills. I&rsquo;ve been on a bender on these red pills.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a bender on these red pills.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a bender on these red pills.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to go. All right. Anybody give a shit about NFTs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a bender on these red pills.</p>
