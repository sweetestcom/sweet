    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>To the GPT-4 developer demo live stream.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s kind of hard for me</p>
<p>to believe that this day is here.</p>
<p>OpenAI has been building this technology really</p>
<p>since we started the company.</p>
<p>But for the past two years, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been really focused on delivering GPT-4.</p>
<p>That started with rebuilding our entire training stack,</p>
<p>actually training the model, and then</p>
<p>seeing what it was capable of, trying to figure out</p>
<p>its capabilities, its risks, working with partners</p>
<p>in order to test it in real-world scenarios,</p>
<p>really tuning its behavior, optimizing the model,</p>
<p>getting it available so that you can use it.</p>
<p>And so today, our goal is to show you</p>
<p>a little bit of how to make GPT-4 shine,</p>
<p>how to really get the most out of it, where its weaknesses are,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re still working on it, and just how to really use it</p>
<p>as a good tool, a good partner.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in participating in the stream,</p>
<p>if you go to our Discord, so that&rsquo;s discord.gg slash</p>
<p>openai, there&rsquo;s comments in there,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll take a couple of audience suggestions.</p>
<p>So the first thing I want to show you</p>
<p>is the first task that GPT-4 could do that we never really</p>
<p>got 3.5 to do.</p>
<p>And the way to think about this is all throughout training</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re constantly doing all this work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2 AM.</p>
<p>The pager goes off.</p>
<p>You fix the model.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re always wondering, is it going to work?</p>
<p>Is all of this effort actually going to pan out?</p>
<p>And so we all had a pet task that we really liked</p>
<p>and that we would all individually be trying to see,</p>
<p>is the model capable of it now?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to show you the first one</p>
<p>that we had a success for 4, but never really got there for 3.5.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to copy the top of our blog post from today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to paste it into our playground.</p>
<p>Now, this is our new chat completions playground</p>
<p>that came out two weeks ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you first with GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>4 has the same API to it, the same playground.</p>
<p>The way that it works is you have a system message where</p>
<p>you explain to the model what it&rsquo;s supposed to do.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve made these models very steerable.</p>
<p>So you can provide it with really any instruction you</p>
<p>want, whatever you dream up.</p>
<p>And the model will adhere to it pretty well.</p>
<p>And in the future, it will get increasingly, increasingly</p>
<p>powerful at steering the model very reliably.</p>
<p>You can then paste whatever you want as a user.</p>
<p>The model will return messages as an assistant.</p>
<p>And the way to think of it is that we&rsquo;re moving away</p>
<p>from just raw text in, raw text out,</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t tell where different parts</p>
<p>of the conversation come from, but towards this much more</p>
<p>structured format that gives the model the opportunity to know,</p>
<p>well, this is the user asking me to do something</p>
<p>that the developer didn&rsquo;t intend.</p>
<p>I should listen to the developer here.</p>
<p>All right, so now, time to actually show you</p>
<p>the task that I&rsquo;m referring to.</p>
<p>So everyone&rsquo;s familiar with?</p>
<p>Summarize.</p>
<p>This is an article into a sentence,</p>
<p>getting a little more specific, but where</p>
<p>every word begins with G. So this is 3.5.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what it does.</p>
<p>Yeah, it kind of didn&rsquo;t even try.</p>
<p>Just gave up on the task.</p>
<p>This is pretty typical for 3.5 trying</p>
<p>to do this particular kind of task.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s sort of a very kind of stilted article or something</p>
<p>like that, maybe it can succeed.</p>
<p>But for the most part, 3.5 just gives up.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s try the exact same prompt, the exact same system</p>
<p>message in GPT-4.</p>
<p>So kind of borderline whether you want to count AI or not,</p>
<p>but so let&rsquo;s say AI doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cheating.</p>
<p>So fair enough.</p>
<p>The model happily accepts my feedback.</p>
<p>So now to make sure it&rsquo;s not just good for Gs,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to turn this over to the audience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take a suggestion on what letter to try next.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, while I&rsquo;m waiting for our moderators</p>
<p>to pick the lucky, lucky letter, I will give a try with A.</p>
<p>But in this case, I&rsquo;ll say GPT-4 is fine.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Also, pretty good summary.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll hop over to our Discord.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>People are being a little ambitious here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really trying to put the model through the paces.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to try Q, which if you think about this</p>
<p>for a moment, I want the audience</p>
<p>to really think about how would you</p>
<p>do a summary of this article that all starts with Q.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve shown you summarizing an existing article.</p>
<p>I want to show you how you can flexibly combine ideas</p>
<p>between different articles.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to take this article that</p>
<p>was on Hacker News yesterday, copy paste it</p>
<p>into the same conversation so it has all the context of what</p>
<p>we were just doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say, find one common theme</p>
<p>between this article and the GPT-4 blog.</p>
<p>So this is an article about Pinecone,</p>
<p>which is a Python web app development framework.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s making the technology more accessible, user friendly.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t think that was insightful enough,</p>
<p>you can always give some feedback</p>
<p>and say, that was not insightful enough.</p>
<p>Please, no, I&rsquo;ll just even just leave it there.</p>
<p>Leave it up to the model to decide.</p>
<p>So bridging the gap between powerful technology</p>
<p>and practical applications.</p>
<p>Seems not bad.</p>
<p>And of course, you can ask for any other kind of task</p>
<p>you want using its flexible language understanding</p>
<p>and synthesis.</p>
<p>You can ask for something like, now turn the GPT-4 blog post</p>
<p>into a rhyming poem.</p>
<p>Picked up on opening up evals, open source for all,</p>
<p>helping to guide answering the call.</p>
<p>Which by the way, if you&rsquo;d like to contribute to this model,</p>
<p>please give us evals.</p>
<p>We have an open source evaluation framework</p>
<p>that will help us guide and all of our users</p>
<p>understand what the model is capable of</p>
<p>and to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>So there we go.</p>
<p>This is consuming existing content</p>
<p>using GPT-4 with a little bit of creativity on top.</p>
<p>But next, I want to show you how to build with GPT-4.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s like to create with it as a partner.</p>
<p>And so the thing we&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re going to actually build a Discord bot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll build it live and show you the process,</p>
<p>show you debugging, show you what</p>
<p>the model can do, where its limitations are,</p>
<p>and how to work with them in order</p>
<p>to sort of achieve new heights.</p>
<p>So the first thing I&rsquo;ll do is tell the model</p>
<p>that this time, it&rsquo;s supposed to be an AI programming</p>
<p>assistant.</p>
<p>Its job is to write things out in pseudocode first</p>
<p>and then actually write the code.</p>
<p>And this approach is very helpful</p>
<p>to let the model break down the problem into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>And then that way, you&rsquo;re not kind</p>
<p>of asking it to just come up with a super hard solution</p>
<p>to a problem all in one go.</p>
<p>It also makes it very interpretable</p>
<p>because you can see exactly what the model was thinking,</p>
<p>and you can even provide corrections if you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>So here is the prompt that we&rsquo;re going to ask it.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing that 3.5 would totally choke on</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve tried anything like it.</p>
<p>But so we&rsquo;re going to ask for a Discord bot that</p>
<p>uses the GPT-4 API to read images and text.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s one problem here, which</p>
<p>is this model&rsquo;s training cutoff is in 2021,</p>
<p>which means it has not seen our new chat completions format.</p>
<p>So I literally just went to the blog post from two weeks ago,</p>
<p>copy pasted from the blog post, including the response format.</p>
<p>It has not seen the new image extension to that.</p>
<p>And so I just kind of wrote that up in just very minimal detail</p>
<p>about how to include images.</p>
<p>And now, the model can actually leverage that documentation</p>
<p>that it did not have memorized, that it does not know.</p>
<p>And in general, these models are very good at using information</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s been trained on in new ways</p>
<p>and synthesizing new content.</p>
<p>And you can see that right here, that it actually</p>
<p>wrote an entirely new bot.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s actually see if this bot</p>
<p>is going to work in practice.</p>
<p>So you should always look through the code</p>
<p>to get a sense of what it does.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t run untrusted code from humans or from AIs.</p>
<p>And one thing to note is that the Discord API has</p>
<p>changed a lot over time, and particularly</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s one feature that has changed a lot</p>
<p>since this model was trained.</p>
<p>Give it a try.</p>
<p>In fact, yes, we are missing the intense keyword.</p>
<p>This is something that came out in 2020.</p>
<p>So the model does know it exists,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t know which version of the Discord API</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>So are we out of luck?</p>
<p>Well, not quite.</p>
<p>We can just simply paste to the model exactly the error</p>
<p>message, not even going to say, hey,</p>
<p>this is from running your code.</p>
<p>Could you please fix it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just let it run.</p>
<p>And the model says, oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Whoops, the intense argument.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the correct code.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s give this a try, once again kind of making sure</p>
<p>that we understand what the code is doing.</p>
<p>Now, a second issue that can come up</p>
<p>is it doesn&rsquo;t know what environment I&rsquo;m running in.</p>
<p>And if you notice, it says, hey, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this inscrutable error message, which</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve not used Jupyter Notebook a lot with async IO</p>
<p>before, you probably have no idea what this means.</p>
<p>But fortunately, once again, you can just sort of say</p>
<p>to the model, hey, I&rsquo;m using Jupyter,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m running a JavaScript code.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Jupyter and would like to make this work.</p>
<p>And you fix it.</p>
<p>And the specific problem is that there&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>an event loop running.</p>
<p>So you need to use this nest async IO library.</p>
<p>You need to call nest async IO.apply.</p>
<p>The model knows all of this, correctly instantiates</p>
<p>all of these pieces into the bot.</p>
<p>It even helpfully tells you, oh, you&rsquo;re running in Jupyter.</p>
<p>Well, you can do this bang pip install</p>
<p>in order to install the package if you don&rsquo;t already have it.</p>
<p>That was very helpful.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ll run.</p>
<p>And it looks like something happened.</p>
<p>So the first thing I&rsquo;ll do is go over to our Discord.</p>
<p>And I will paste in a screenshot of our Discord itself.</p>
<p>So remember, GPT-4 is not just a language model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a vision model.</p>
<p>In fact, it can flexibly accept inputs</p>
<p>that intersperse images and text arbitrarily,</p>
<p>kind of like a document.</p>
<p>Now, the image feature is in preview.</p>
<p>So this is going to be a little sneak peek.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not yet publicly available.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re working with one partner called BeMyEyes</p>
<p>in order to really start to develop it</p>
<p>and get it ready for primetime.</p>
<p>But you can ask anything you like.</p>
<p>For example, I can&rsquo;t, you know, I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>GPT-4, hello world.</p>
<p>Can you describe this image in painstaking detail?</p>
<p>All right, which, first of all,</p>
<p>think of how you would do this yourself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different things you could latch onto,</p>
<p>a lot of different pieces of the system you could describe.</p>
<p>And we can go over to the actual code.</p>
<p>And we can see that, yep, we, in fact, received the message,</p>
<p>have formatted an appropriate request for our API.</p>
<p>And now we wait because, you know,</p>
<p>one of the things we have to do</p>
<p>is we have to make the system faster.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things that we&rsquo;re working on optimizing.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I just want to say</p>
<p>to the audience that&rsquo;s watching,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll take an audience request next.</p>
<p>So if you have an image and a task you&rsquo;d like to accomplish,</p>
<p>please submit that to the Discord.</p>
<p>Our moderators will pick one that will run.</p>
<p>So we can see that the Discord,</p>
<p>oh, it looks like we have a response.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a screenshot of a Discord application interface.</p>
<p>Pretty good. Did not even describe it.</p>
<p>It knows that it&rsquo;s Discord.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably Discord written there somewhere</p>
<p>where it just kind of knows this from prior experience.</p>
<p>Server icon labeled GPT-4</p>
<p>describes the interface in great detail.</p>
<p>Talks about all the people telling me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m supposed to do queue.</p>
<p>Very kind audience.</p>
<p>And describes a bunch of the notification messages</p>
<p>and the users that are in the channel.</p>
<p>And so there you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some pretty good understanding.</p>
<p>Now, this next one, if you notice,</p>
<p>first of all, we got a post,</p>
<p>but the model did not actually see the message.</p>
<p>So is this a failure of the model</p>
<p>or of the system around the model?</p>
<p>Well, we can take a look.</p>
<p>And if you notice here, content is an empty string.</p>
<p>We received a blank message contents.</p>
<p>The reason for this is a dirty trick</p>
<p>that we played on the AI.</p>
<p>So if you go to the Discord documentation</p>
<p>and you scroll through it all the way down to,</p>
<p>I can see it hard for me to even find, honestly,</p>
<p>to the message content intent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see this was added as of September 2022</p>
<p>as a required field.</p>
<p>So in order to receive a message</p>
<p>that does not explicitly tag you,</p>
<p>you now have to include this new intent in your code.</p>
<p>Remember I said, intents have changed a lot over time.</p>
<p>This is much newer than the model is possibly able to know.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;re out of luck.</p>
<p>We have to debug this by hand.</p>
<p>But once again, we can try to use</p>
<p>GPT-4&rsquo;s language understanding capabilities to solve this.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind, this is a document of like,</p>
<p>I think this is like 10,000, 15,000 words,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not formatted very well.</p>
<p>This is literally a command a copy paste.</p>
<p>Like this is what it&rsquo;s supposed to parse through</p>
<p>to find in the middle of that document that,</p>
<p>oh yeah, message contents, that&rsquo;s required now.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s see if it can do it.</p>
<p>So we will ask for, I am receiving blank message contents.</p>
<p>Can you, why could this be happening?</p>
<p>How do I fix it?</p>
<p>So one thing that&rsquo;s new about GPT-4 is context length.</p>
<p>32,000 tokens is kind of the upper limit</p>
<p>that we support right now.</p>
<p>And the model is able to flexibly use long documents.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re still optimizing.</p>
<p>So we recommend trying it out,</p>
<p>but not necessarily sort of really scaling it up just yet,</p>
<p>unless you have an application that really benefits from it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re really interested in long context,</p>
<p>please let us know.</p>
<p>We want to see what kinds of applications it unlocks.</p>
<p>But if you see, it says, oh yeah,</p>
<p>message content intent was not enabled.</p>
<p>And so you can either ask the model</p>
<p>to write some code for you,</p>
<p>or you could actually just do it the old fashioned way.</p>
<p>Either way is fine.</p>
<p>I think that this is a augmenting tool,</p>
<p>makes you much more productive,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still important that you are in the driver&rsquo;s seat</p>
<p>and are the manager and knows what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re connected once again.</p>
<p>And Boris, would you like to rerun the message?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Once again, we can see that we have received it,</p>
<p>even though the bot was not explicitly tagged.</p>
<p>Seems like a pretty good description.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>This is an interesting image, actually.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s a dolly generated one.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s actually try this one as well.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny about this image?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s already been submitted.</p>
<p>So once again, we can verify</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s making the right API calls.</p>
<p>Squirrels do typically eat nuts.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t expect them to use a camera or act like a human.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good explanation</p>
<p>of why that image is funny.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to show you one more example</p>
<p>of what you can do with this model.</p>
<p>So I have here a nice hand-drawn mock-up of a joke website.</p>
<p>Definitely worthy of being put up on my refrigerator.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to take out my phone,</p>
<p>literally take a photo of this mock-up,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m going to send it to our Discord.</p>
<p>All right, going to send it to our Discord.</p>
<p>And this is, of course, the rockiest part,</p>
<p>making sure that we actually send it to the right channel,</p>
<p>which in fact, I think maybe I did not.</p>
<p>Sent it to the wrong channel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, it&rsquo;s always the non-AI parts of these demos</p>
<p>that are the hardest part to do.</p>
<p>And here we go.</p>
<p>Technology is now solved.</p>
<p>And now we wait.</p>
<p>So the thing that&rsquo;s amazing in my mind</p>
<p>is that what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re talking to a neural network,</p>
<p>and this neural network was trained</p>
<p>to predict what comes next.</p>
<p>It played this game of being shown a partial document</p>
<p>and then predicted what comes next</p>
<p>across an unimaginably large amount of content.</p>
<p>And from there, it learns all of these skills</p>
<p>that you can apply in all of these very flexible ways.</p>
<p>And so we can actually take now this output.</p>
<p>So literally we just said to output the HTML</p>
<p>from that picture.</p>
<p>And here we go.</p>
<p>Actual working JavaScript filled in the jokes.</p>
<p>For comparison, this was the original</p>
<p>of our mock-up.</p>
<p>And so there you go, going from hand-drawn beautiful art,</p>
<p>if I do say so myself, to working website.</p>
<p>And this is all just potential, right?</p>
<p>You can see lots of different applications.</p>
<p>We ourselves are still figuring out new ways to use this.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to work with our partner.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to scale up from there,</p>
<p>but please be patient because it&rsquo;s going to take us some time</p>
<p>to really make this available for everyone.</p>
<p>So I have one last thing to show you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve shown you reading existing content.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve shown you how to build with the system as a partner.</p>
<p>The last thing I&rsquo;m going to show</p>
<p>is how to work with the system to accomplish a task</p>
<p>that none of us like to do, but we all have to.</p>
<p>So you may have guessed,</p>
<p>the thing we&rsquo;re going to do is taxes.</p>
<p>Now note that GPT is not a certified tax professional,</p>
<p>nor am I, so you should always check with your tax advisor,</p>
<p>but it can be helpful to understand some dense content,</p>
<p>to just be able to empower yourself</p>
<p>to be able to sort of solve problems</p>
<p>and get a handle on what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>when you could not otherwise.</p>
<p>So once again, I&rsquo;ll do a system message.</p>
<p>In this case, I&rsquo;m going to tell it that it&rsquo;s tax GPT,</p>
<p>which is not a specific thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve trained into this model.</p>
<p>You can be very creative if you want with the system message</p>
<p>to really get the model in the mood of what is your job?</p>
<p>What are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>So I pasted in the tax code.</p>
<p>This is about 16 pages worth of tax code.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this question about Alice and Bob.</p>
<p>They got married at one point and here are their incomes</p>
<p>and they take a standard deduction, they&rsquo;re filing jointly.</p>
<p>So first question,</p>
<p>what is their standard deduction for 2018?</p>
<p>So while the model is chugging,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to solve this problem by hand</p>
<p>to show you what&rsquo;s involved.</p>
<p>So the standard deduction is the basic standard deduction</p>
<p>plus the additional.</p>
<p>The basic one is 200% for joint return of subparagraph C,</p>
<p>which is here, okay?</p>
<p>So additional doesn&rsquo;t apply.</p>
<p>The limitation doesn&rsquo;t apply.</p>
<p>Okay, none of these apply.</p>
<p>Oh wait, special rules for taxable year 2018,</p>
<p>which is the one we care about through 2025,</p>
<p>you have to substitute 12,000 for 3,000.</p>
<p>So 200% of 12,000, 24,000 is the final answer.</p>
<p>If you notice the model got to the same conclusion</p>
<p>and you can actually read through its explanation.</p>
<p>And to tell you the truth,</p>
<p>the first time I tried to approach this problem myself,</p>
<p>I could not figure it out.</p>
<p>I spent half an hour reading through the tax code,</p>
<p>trying to figure out this like back reference</p>
<p>and why there&rsquo;s subparagraph,</p>
<p>just what&rsquo;s even going on.</p>
<p>It was only by asking the model to spell out its reasoning,</p>
<p>and then I followed along that I was like,</p>
<p>oh, I get it now, I understand how this works.</p>
<p>And so that I think is where the power of this system lies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect, but neither are you.</p>
<p>And together it&rsquo;s this amplifying tool</p>
<p>that lets you just reach new heights.</p>
<p>And you can go further.</p>
<p>You can say, okay, now calculate their total liability.</p>
<p>And here we go, it&rsquo;s doing the calculation.</p>
<p>Honestly, every time it does it, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>This model is so good at mental math.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way, way better than I am at mental math.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hooked up to a calculator.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s another way that you could really try</p>
<p>to enhance these systems,</p>
<p>but it has these raw capabilities that are so flexible.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s code,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s language,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s tax.</p>
<p>All of these capabilities in one system</p>
<p>that can be applied towards the problem that you care about,</p>
<p>towards your application, towards whatever you build.</p>
<p>And so to end it, the final thing that I will show</p>
<p>is a little other dose of creativity,</p>
<p>which is now summarize this problem into a rhyming poem.</p>
<p>And there we go.</p>
<p>A beautiful, beautiful poem about doing your taxes.</p>
<p>So thank you everyone for tuning in.</p>
<p>I hope you learned something about what the model can do,</p>
<p>how to work with it.</p>
<p>And honestly, we&rsquo;re just really excited</p>
<p>to see what you&rsquo;re going to build.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about OpenAI evals, please contribute.</p>
<p>We think that this model, improving it,</p>
<p>bringing it to the next level,</p>
<p>is something that everyone can contribute to,</p>
<p>and that we think it can really benefit a lot of people,</p>
<p>and we want your help to do that.</p>
<p>So thank you very much.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited to see what you&rsquo;re going to build.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
