    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Rabbi David Wolpe, someone who I have been a fan</p>
<p>of for many years, for the kindness in his heart, the strength of his character, and</p>
<p>the kind of friends he keeps and talks with, many of whom disagree with him but love him</p>
<p>nevertheless, including the late Christopher Hitchens.</p>
<p>I will have many conversations like these in the future about religion, about Islam,</p>
<p>Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others, looking to understand and celebrate</p>
<p>the culture, the tradition, and the beauty of the people who practice these religions.</p>
<p>I will of course not shy away from the difficult topics.</p>
<p>I will talk both about hate and love, about war and peace.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded more than three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Please allow me this time to speak on what has been on my mind.</p>
<p>If this is not interesting to you, please skip, I totally understand.</p>
<p>Some people asked me to say a few words on the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>I think my words are worth little, but perhaps let me try.</p>
<p>I considered doing a long solo episode on this war.</p>
<p>I tried several times, but it is too personal for now.</p>
<p>To give you context, I&rsquo;ve been talking to refugees, friends, loved ones, in Ukraine,</p>
<p>in Russia, in Poland, Slovakia, Moldova, Romania, even UK, Germany, Canada, India, China, and</p>
<p>of course the United States.</p>
<p>Some of them crying, or angry, or confused, or scared.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m helping as best as I can privately, and I&rsquo;m hoping to help in the future by traveling</p>
<p>to Ukraine and Russia and celebrating the humanity and the beauty of the people in this</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>This was all set up both for Ukraine and Russia trips before 2022, including conversations</p>
<p>with scientists, artists, athletes, leaders, and just, quote, regular folks, who are equally</p>
<p>if not more fascinating to me.</p>
<p>For now, it has become much more difficult, but I&rsquo;ll keep trying to find a way.</p>
<p>I was born in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>My roots are both Ukrainian and Russian.</p>
<p>From today and until the day I die, I am an American.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of all of this.</p>
<p>I hope to keep celebrating the culture and the incredible human beings that make up these</p>
<p>nations and humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all one people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I feel about the people of these nations.</p>
<p>Now let me speak about those in the seats of power.</p>
<p>I condemn all actions of leaders who play geopolitical games on the world stage disregarding</p>
<p>the costs paid in human suffering on the scale of millions.</p>
<p>For this reason, I condemn Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>And I condemn many of the military interventions by the superpowers of the world, including</p>
<p>by my country, the country I love, the United States, that after World War II has intervened</p>
<p>in over 40 nations with many studies finding that the United States is culpable for an</p>
<p>unfathomable number of civilian deaths.</p>
<p>I condemn all heads of state who needlessly wage wars, watching young men and women burn</p>
<p>in the fires they started.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how humans can be so cruel to each other, or rather I understand, but</p>
<p>I believe in a future world where this is no longer true.</p>
<p>Let me also say a few words of what I hope to do with this podcast.</p>
<p>I want to explore the full complexity and beauty of human nature.</p>
<p>I believe each of us are capable of good and evil, and I want to understand how the mind</p>
<p>and the circumstance lead one to choose the former path or the latter.</p>
<p>And I believe conversation is one of the best ways to work toward this understanding.</p>
<p>For that, I think I have to not only talk to the most inspiring humans in the world,</p>
<p>but also to the most controversial.</p>
<p>I will speak with many people who I disagree with, politicians, activists, CEOs, heads</p>
<p>of state, with very different opinions on the world.</p>
<p>I will try hard to challenge their ideas without closing my mind to the depth and complexity</p>
<p>of their perspective and their humanity.</p>
<p>My presence in the same room with wildly different people will make it easy for the media and</p>
<p>the internet to pick and choose clips and snapshots attacking me for being a shill for</p>
<p>one side or the other.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t defend this point, except to say that I&rsquo;m a shill for no one, and that I</p>
<p>hope you see the strength of my integrity, that I won&rsquo;t be influenced by any of them</p>
<p>no matter how rich, powerful, or charismatic they are.</p>
<p>Like the poem If by Roger Kipling says, if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</p>
<p>or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt</p>
<p>you, if all men count with you, but none too much.</p>
<p>This is a really, really important thing to me that I try to live by, that all human beings</p>
<p>count with me the same.</p>
<p>People have criticized me for wanting to have some of these conversations, like with Vladimir</p>
<p>Putin and Vladimir Zelensky, and for times in the past speaking about them without the</p>
<p>seriousness the topic deserves.</p>
<p>For this, I would sincerely like to apologize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed, even ashamed, of my frequent ineloquence on these topics.</p>
<p>I will work hard to do better.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m joking, it should be clear that it&rsquo;s a joke, and hopefully actually funny.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m being serious, I should speak with care and rigor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now done many hundreds of hours of podcast conversation.</p>
<p>Despite my frequent failures in speaking, I hope you know where my heart is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think people will take clips of me and use them to attack me.</p>
<p>This will happen more and more.</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s nothing I can do but send them my love, and in the meantime, try to</p>
<p>be a better person and a better interviewer.</p>
<p>Let me also say that I like humor, especially dark humor.</p>
<p>I like being silly and not taking myself seriously.</p>
<p>I will keep taking risks with that, all with the goal of having fun and celebrating humanity</p>
<p>at its most absurd and most beautiful.</p>
<p>I will occasionally dress up in strange and weird outfits to celebrate the absurdity of</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>I will hang out, break bread, and joke with all kinds of people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to agree with them to laugh with them, in order to escape for a brief</p>
<p>moment the tension, the conflict, the hatred in the world.</p>
<p>Humor just might save this little chaotic little civilization of ours.</p>
<p>I love the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>I love the Russian people.</p>
<p>And of course, I love my fellow Americans, Californians and Midwesterners, New Yorkers</p>
<p>and Texans.</p>
<p>I love humans.</p>
<p>I love life.</p>
<p>And I want to share that love with others.</p>
<p>With you.</p>
<p>If I mess it up, I&rsquo;m really, really sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying my best.</p>
<p>I have no agenda and no one telling me what to do.</p>
<p>I feel like the luckiest guy in the world to have all these opportunities, and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>deeply grateful to be alive and to share that joy with other amazing people around me.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>For all the love you&rsquo;ve sent my way, I will work my ass off to not disappoint you.</p>
<p>I love you all.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with David Welby.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a big question.</p>
<p>According to Judaism, who is God?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult because Judaism, like any tradition that is thousands of years old and encompasses</p>
<p>so many different lands and languages and thinkers, it doesn&rsquo;t give a single answer</p>
<p>to even simple questions.</p>
<p>And to large questions, it certainly doesn&rsquo;t give a single answer.</p>
<p>Although Judaism was responsible for introducing the monotheistic idea to the world, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean that it&rsquo;s one idea.</p>
<p>So if you take Maimonides, the greatest sage in the Jewish tradition, a medieval philosopher,</p>
<p>he would say that God is an omnipotent, benevolent, intangible, unimaginable God.</p>
<p>In fact, he said, you can&rsquo;t say what God is, only what God is not, because you have</p>
<p>to emphasize, could talk more about that, but basically you have to emphasize the unknowability</p>
<p>of God.</p>
<p>You have a modern philosopher like Heschel, who says that God is a God of pathos, a God</p>
<p>of deep feeling, which probably would make Maimonides shiver if he heard such a description.</p>
<p>And if you look in the Bible, God is always regretting or having human emotions.</p>
<p>So there are so many different kinds of depictions and ideas, and there is this tremendous tension</p>
<p>between transcendence and imminence.</p>
<p>That is, in the Jewish tradition, God is exquisitely close, God is imminent.</p>
<p>In the Talmud&rsquo;s words, God is as close as your mouth is to your ear.</p>
<p>In other words, whatever you say, God hears it.</p>
<p>And yet at the same time, God is unfathomably distant.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I speak to high schoolers, I will say, in the Jewish tradition, think</p>
<p>of it this way.</p>
<p>When you were two years old, you had no idea what it was to be a 15 year old.</p>
<p>Not only did you not know, but you didn&rsquo;t know what you didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We conceive of God as being more, the distance between God and human beings is far greater</p>
<p>than the distance between a two year old and a 15 year old.</p>
<p>So when we speak about God, we have to acknowledge how limited we really are.</p>
<p>So okay, you laid out a lot of fascinating things on the table.</p>
<p>So one, the nobility of God, then this idea of deep feeling, which again, can God operate</p>
<p>in the space of feelings too, so not just the mouth and the ear of the senses, can God</p>
<p>be known?</p>
<p>Can God be felt by this three year old in the analogy versus the teenager?</p>
<p>So I will take refuge in a beautiful phrase from Martin Buber, another Jewish theologian.</p>
<p>He said, God cannot be expressed, God can only be addressed.</p>
<p>In other words, you can speak to God, you can feel a sense of God, but can you begin</p>
<p>to comprehend or know God?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yosef Kaspi, I&rsquo;m pulling in a couple of early Jewish philosophers, he said, to know God,</p>
<p>I would have to be God.</p>
<p>But can we get close?</p>
<p>Is it useful or is it a distraction to visualize things, to embody, to create, to attach to</p>
<p>the stories some kind of visualizations in our mind?</p>
<p>For example, gender, he versus she, things like this, or old man in the sky kind of feeling.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost inevitable, but I think ultimately you try to transcend it.</p>
<p>This was the great, we just read this actually in synagogue, the story of the golden calf.</p>
<p>And the story is that human beings found it impossible to not have a visualization because</p>
<p>they had just come from Egypt and in the world of pagan worship, everything is&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that pagans thought that idol was actually God, but it represented visually</p>
<p>what God was.</p>
<p>And along comes this idea that God is actually not capable of being visualized, which is</p>
<p>very difficult and it stretches the bounds of human comprehension, maybe even breaks</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>So would you say that the proper way to operate as a human in relation to God is humility</p>
<p>in that you&rsquo;re screwed, you&rsquo;re not able to basically know anything, almost anything?</p>
<p>Well, the reason that the salvation of this is that you can&rsquo;t, I was going to say the</p>
<p>reason you&rsquo;re not screwed, but then I thought somebody might be upset at a rabbi saying</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t say it and have not said it.</p>
<p>But the reason you&rsquo;re not is that you don&rsquo;t have to have a comprehension of God.</p>
<p>You have to have a relationship to God and those are not the same.</p>
<p>I mean, to draw an analogy that is not far from perfect as most analogies are, but this</p>
<p>one especially, you have relationships with people who are mysteries to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a mystery to yourself.</p>
<p>You can live and love somebody for 50 years and they can say something that surprises</p>
<p>you because ultimately we are trapped in here.</p>
<p>And when a child first says I, we call that individuation.</p>
<p>But what that really means is I now know that I am cut off from the minds of all other children</p>
<p>and all other people.</p>
<p>And so you have with God a more intimate relationship because you can believe that God is, you are</p>
<p>known by God and you have a relationship to God despite the fact that you can&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>God just as you can&rsquo;t know others.</p>
<p>And some would say to have a good relationship, you want to be constantly surprised.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to know the thing.</p>
<p>Well, the world, yes, the world that God created is constantly surprising.</p>
<p>And by the way, the caveat to this, you know, when I had all these debates with Christopher</p>
<p>Hitchens and he would always say that God is a greater tyrant than North Korea because</p>
<p>it continues after your death.</p>
<p>And the idea of being known by God is after all frightening if you think God knows what</p>
<p>I think and so on, if your image of God is unloving.</p>
<p>Can we jump to this?</p>
<p>You had friendships and conversations with a lot of the fascinating figures of the past</p>
<p>20, 30 years of the great intellectuals, one of which perhaps one of the greats is Christopher</p>
<p>Hitchens.</p>
<p>What have you learned from your conversation, your friendship?</p>
<p>So there are a lot of views he held that I really did not agree with, but he was a remarkable</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>That was a good line about North Korea.</p>
<p>He was full of incredibly good lines.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things I learned was you can&rsquo;t win a debate with Christopher Hitchens.</p>
<p>One of the reasons you can&rsquo;t win is because he has this British baritone and this ready</p>
<p>wit that you can&rsquo;t triumph over laughter.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if your argument is better, if your quip is better, you win.</p>
<p>And so I remember once we were arguing about free will and he said, well, I choose to believe</p>
<p>in it.</p>
<p>And everybody laughed and that was despite the fact that that&rsquo;s not really an argument.</p>
<p>Or like I have free will because I don&rsquo;t have a choice or whatever.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And people should watch your conversation with him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a kind of David versus Goliath situation and you&rsquo;re quite masterful at using</p>
<p>charisma and sweet talking Christopher Hitchens.</p>
<p>I also genuinely liked him.</p>
<p>I mean, I spent a three hour limousine ride with him from one debate to another, from</p>
<p>LA to San Diego.</p>
<p>And the entire time he said, we just can&rsquo;t talk about religion.</p>
<p>So we talked about literature and he gave me a long lecture about scotch.</p>
<p>He was inexhaustible.</p>
<p>I mean, not only did he, I began, I wrote a couple of obituaries about him and one I</p>
<p>began with the historian Keith Thomas said, there are two ways of achieving immortality</p>
<p>by doing things worth remembering or saying things worth remembering.</p>
<p>And by that standard, he did both.</p>
<p>I mean, he went all around the world to all sorts of danger zones.</p>
<p>He knew like the best bars everywhere from Kuala Lumpur, you know, to Beirut, to LA.</p>
<p>And he could drink all night and write a 2000 word essay on the poetry of Yates and go to</p>
<p>sleep.</p>
<p>I remember before one of our debates in Boston, he was at the bar and he said, come have a</p>
<p>drink.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m not going to have a drink before I go to debate with you.</p>
<p>What are you crazy?</p>
<p>And he said, just have a beer, it&rsquo;s water.</p>
<p>So he was, he really was a constant, inexhaustible fountain of intrigue and interest.</p>
<p>What kind of things, if you can remember, if you can mention, if you can admit, to have</p>
<p>him enlightening you or helping you change your mind about something in this world.</p>
<p>So I think, unrelated to Scotch, yeah, unrelated to Scotch.</p>
<p>He convinced me that the idea, I mean, I had my doubts about it and have my doubts about</p>
<p>it, but he convinced me through many debates and not only he, that the idea that religion</p>
<p>makes people better is not, it&rsquo;s not ipso facto wrong, but it&rsquo;s a much, much more complicated</p>
<p>argument than I wished it to be.</p>
<p>So he is, however you conceive of the term beauty, he&rsquo;s one of those, one of the more</p>
<p>beautiful humans, this weird little earth produced.</p>
<p>So how do you explain the atheism combined with such a beautiful mind?</p>
<p>So from your perspective of a man of faith, how do you think about that?</p>
<p>So of the atheists that I have debated, I think about all of them somewhat differently.</p>
<p>So I think that in some deep way, for example, Sam Harris is a religious personality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think that he would, he wouldn&rsquo;t like the word religious, but I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think that he would take issue with that.</p>
<p>I think that he would say his is a purely material based spirituality.</p>
<p>But I mean, his orientation towards meditation and appreciation of Buddhism, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>deeply seeking spiritual about him.</p>
<p>With Hitchens, I honestly, and I know that some of his fans will really not like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that he was any kind of closet believer, certainly not at all, but I almost feel as</p>
<p>though he was less a passionate arguer against religion than he was, first of all, extremely</p>
<p>upset by the forms that religion took in this world.</p>
<p>And then once he trained his intellectual howitzers on a target, he had so much fun</p>
<p>inventing new arguments and attacking it that I really believe he gets carried away sometimes</p>
<p>by his own eloquence and intellectual range.</p>
<p>So for example, the idea that you would call a book that religion poisons everything, I</p>
<p>think he did that deliberately provocatively so that he could defend a proposition that</p>
<p>obviously is indefensible, that it poisons everything.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I think he had tremendous joie de vivre.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what, that&rsquo;s what sums him up.</p>
<p>This guy loved life in all of its manifestations and arguing against something that someone</p>
<p>else believed was one of his greatest joys.</p>
<p>Yeah, and of course the practical aspect of that, he just saw the powerful and he challenged</p>
<p>them with humor and so on.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And you know, you could argue perhaps that humor is the highest form of what humanity</p>
<p>can achieve.</p>
<p>Like sometimes maybe us little humans take things a little too seriously, then sometimes</p>
<p>we need to just laugh at it all, laugh at ourselves, and that&rsquo;s probably the purest</p>
<p>form of wisdom.</p>
<p>You know, Auden, the poet, said, among the people that I like or admire, I can find no</p>
<p>common quality, but among those I love, I can.</p>
<p>All of them make me laugh.</p>
<p>There you have it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaking of people that make you laugh, Sam Harris, because he actually has a really great</p>
<p>sense of humor.</p>
<p>He does.</p>
<p>With a very cold and monotone delivery.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s another one that you had, you&rsquo;re friends with, you have good conversations with.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your fundamental disagreements and agreements with Sam?</p>
<p>Sam believes that religion is intellectually indefensible.</p>
<p>He really believes it, like deep in his soul.</p>
<p>And he gets angry at the idea that a proposition should be unchallenged if it offends his sense</p>
<p>of logic.</p>
<p>So he cannot move on until this is dealt with.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>In fact, I did a podcast with Eric Weinstein, and then Sam did one.</p>
<p>And Sam said, when I heard your podcast with David Wolpe, I learned stuff about what he</p>
<p>thinks that I never learned in my conversations with him because I can never let him make</p>
<p>those unfounded assertions without challenging them, and you just let them go.</p>
<p>And I think that there was something to that was like, he finds it hard to have a conversation</p>
<p>about religion that doesn&rsquo;t arouse his real ire about the harm that he thinks religion</p>
<p>does in the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more about the implementation of religion in the world as it is versus the</p>
<p>really fundamental&hellip;</p>
<p>I think he also thinks it&rsquo;s fundamentally intellectually shoddy and disreputable.</p>
<p>Faith.</p>
<p>Yeah, faith.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to put this.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re both capable of separating their contempt for religion from the people</p>
<p>that they have sitting in front of them.</p>
<p>You mean Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Both of them.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let me&hellip;</p>
<p>You mentioned Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>People should listen to your conversation with Eric.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nonstandard.</p>
<p>It just goes all over the place in this humor and wit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one interesting aspect that I also learned, perhaps not about you but about Eric,</p>
<p>about both.</p>
<p>But Eric has a similar thing as with Jordan Peterson, which is if you ask them, do they</p>
<p>believe in God, I think the answer&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not comfortable answering that question, or they might say no, but they&rsquo;re usually</p>
<p>just not comfortable answering that question.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a kind of sense that they would like to live life, a religious life, as if</p>
<p>God exists.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I think, first of all, Eric has a really deep appreciation of the Jewish tradition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Peterson.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read his stuff and I&rsquo;ve reviewed his stuff and so on.</p>
<p>But I think that Jungians are in their very approach.</p>
<p>They believe that myth is the way the world works.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not that big a leap to God, but there&rsquo;s still a distance there.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have your cake and eat it too?</p>
<p>Is it possible to have the depth of a religious life without believing in God?</p>
<p>How do you make sense of Eric Weinstein&rsquo;s devout life within the tradition?</p>
<p>I honestly think he believes in God, but doesn&rsquo;t believe in God and it&rsquo;s oscillating like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a quantum mechanical system of some sort.</p>
<p>Schrodinger&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>So I think that he would probably agree with what Elie Wiesel said, that a Jew can be angry</p>
<p>at God or be disbelieving of God, but is not allowed to be indifferent to God.</p>
<p>And I think Eric&rsquo;s not indifferent to God.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s different than Christianity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this conversation many times because you can be very Jewish and have deep doubts</p>
<p>about theological questions because Judaism isn&rsquo;t a religion, it&rsquo;s a religious family.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re born Jewish.</p>
<p>Like if I said to you tomorrow, if I was Christian and I said, oh, I believe in Jesus today and</p>
<p>then tomorrow I didn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not Christian anymore.</p>
<p>But if tomorrow I said, oh, I don&rsquo;t believe all this stuff, I&rsquo;m still Jewish.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a more complicated system.</p>
<p>Having said that though, I think it&rsquo;s very hard to sustain over generations without some</p>
<p>belief that the source of it is beyond ourselves.</p>
<p>And in that sense, as in many others, Eric is unique.</p>
<p>Well, he was actually making that claim that we need faith to propagate this tradition</p>
<p>through the generations.</p>
<p>So without that, the traditions crumble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting idea and very interesting argument for devout faith, which is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing, it&rsquo;s a glue that holds a tradition together.</p>
<p>Otherwise like traditions fall apart because you can&rsquo;t have the intensity of that tradition.</p>
<p>I mean, on the other hand, you do see tradition, I mean, Thanksgiving, one of my favorite.</p>
<p>So I would say traditions that are demanding fall apart, traditions that require Turkey</p>
<p>might not fall apart, but traditions that make demands of you that are countercultural</p>
<p>or are hard, they fall apart.</p>
<p>I think I need to introduce you to some Thanksgiving dinners that are quite demanding, getting</p>
<p>the family together.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a, first of all, I&rsquo;m a vegetarian, so I&rsquo;m tough to have at Thanksgiving dinner,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a comedian, Cathy Landsman, who one year I heard this on the radio and it</p>
<p>stuck with me.</p>
<p>She said that holidays are a chance to renew your resentments afresh, you know, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically what people do with their families.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going to go home and fight with the uncle again this year.</p>
<p>I apologize to take a dark turn, but you mentioned Elie Wiesel.</p>
<p>I recently saw a picture of Elie Wiesel when he was in the camp, when he was liberated.</p>
<p>For some reason that hit hard, like, you know, I&rsquo;ve seen pictures in concentration camps</p>
<p>of people I don&rsquo;t know or whose words I haven&rsquo;t really felt and gone through, but for some</p>
<p>reason like here&rsquo;s just a normal person, like a normal body laying there, that just, that</p>
<p>was him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, and, and you see, you can see his face, but at the same time you see that this</p>
<p>is an amazing, and I think what&rsquo;s so disturbing about it is exactly what you were saying is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a thousand people like this and I know this one and I know what he became.</p>
<p>So what about all those other people who look exactly like him who didn&rsquo;t make it out of</p>
<p>the camp?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see his projection, but it seemed like this perhaps is also just combining with</p>
<p>man&rsquo;s search for meaning is it seemed like it was a regular day for them in the picture.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t seem like, I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure what I expect to see what suffering looks like,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s no celebration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a picture of actually liberation be celebratory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really true.</p>
<p>So what do you make sense, and I apologize to take a step into that moment in history.</p>
<p>How does, how do you make sense of the Holocaust that, of Nazi Germany that such things could</p>
<p>be committed by human beings to each other?</p>
<p>Is it religion?</p>
<p>Is it the thirst for power?</p>
<p>Is it the madness of crowds somehow carrying us forward?</p>
<p>I mean, for me it&rsquo;s multi causal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one reason.</p>
<p>So one of the things especially there has to do with the special nature of antisemitism,</p>
<p>which is let&rsquo;s put that to one side for the moment.</p>
<p>The second is I think human beings are fundamentally split.</p>
<p>They are mostly good except when put under certain pressures.</p>
<p>My first explanation for hatreds is as follows, go to a playground.</p>
<p>What happens when a new kid comes on the playground?</p>
<p>Do the other kids say, oh, let&rsquo;s go share our toys with the new kid?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>They say, oh, who&rsquo;s that stranger and let&rsquo;s go get them because otherness is built into</p>
<p>our genetic, I mean, we&rsquo;re tribal by nature and we see people form tribes all the time</p>
<p>of different kinds.</p>
<p>I asked you before if you were a chess player and when I was a kid and playing in tournaments</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t do it for that long and I didn&rsquo;t do it that well, but when I was, it was like</p>
<p>the whole world was divided into people who could play chess and people who couldn&rsquo;t play</p>
<p>chess, which is ridiculous if you think about it as though that&rsquo;s the way you divide the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>But we tend to do that and the Jews were always the identifiable other.</p>
<p>There were Frenchmen and Jews, there were Russians and Jews, there were Germans and</p>
<p>Jews and the great blessing of America is that there&rsquo;s no identifiable other quite that</p>
<p>way is that there&rsquo;s all these minorities and no, there&rsquo;s not an American and a something.</p>
<p>But once you have that identifiable other and you have a long history of blaming that</p>
<p>identifiable other for all the ills that befall you.</p>
<p>Of course, people still do try to form, you said America, they still try to form other,</p>
<p>I mean, immigrant versus been here for a generation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many ways to slice it.</p>
<p>We still try to find ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more difficult in America because there&rsquo;s so many sub tribes, hierarchies of</p>
<p>tribes and upon tribes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>And I was moving fast because I didn&rsquo;t want to get bogged down in all the very difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I tried.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hoping I wouldn&rsquo;t mention that tribalism happens in America.</p>
<p>Skating, you know, when you&rsquo;re on thin ice, your safety is in your speed.</p>
<p>So I was trying to move fast.</p>
<p>But for most of history in Eastern Western Europe, not obviously in the, in Asia, but</p>
<p>in Eastern Western Europe, Jews were the ones who like, they&rsquo;re not like us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re clearly not like us.</p>
<p>And so, and in addition, there was, there&rsquo;s a peculiar quality and I don&rsquo;t know, I wonder</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll think of this explanation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a peculiar quality to antisemitism that is unlike any other hatred that I know</p>
<p>of, which is Jews are both superhuman and subhuman.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re vermin.</p>
<p>The Nazis thought of them as vermin and yet they control the world.</p>
<p>And there was an English scholar named Hyman Maccabee who said the reason that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so is the myth that Jews killed God.</p>
<p>They killed Jesus and to kill a God, you have to be superhumanly evil.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just be bad, otherwise you can&rsquo;t kill a God.</p>
<p>So there is some like supercharged evil sense that people got from that about Jews that</p>
<p>still in here.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>A lot of the way we formulate the other in terms of tribes is often they&rsquo;re subhuman</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re here to steal our resources, like on the playground.</p>
<p>But to be both is a fascinating construction.</p>
<p>Do you agree with Solzhenitsyn that all of us have the capacity for evil?</p>
<p>A hundred percent runs through every human heart.</p>
<p>I have no doubt about it.</p>
<p>And I know as you probably do, but I probably know more both because of what I do and because</p>
<p>I have lived a lot longer than you.</p>
<p>I know a lot of religious leaders who people thought or think are above the human and they</p>
<p>are emphatically not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Some of them have done horrible things and they&rsquo;ve used their position to do horrible</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because there is no perfect saint.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, you know, I mean, all through history you discover all these saintly characters</p>
<p>that we worship, the people who actually knew them around them, some liked them and some</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>People are complicated, all of us.</p>
<p>And the tough thing is, the thing that&rsquo;s the toughest for me is it&rsquo;s not very always clear</p>
<p>what is good and what is evil.</p>
<p>Because certainly if you just look at history and it&rsquo;s not always propaganda, I, you know,</p>
<p>I really believe that some part of Stalin thought he was doing good, legitimately.</p>
<p>And it makes you ask a question of yourself.</p>
<p>For those of us who want to do good in the world, am I actually doing good?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really difficult question, like in the technology sphere, for example, in</p>
<p>this dream of creating technology that will do some good, am I actually doing good?</p>
<p>So I have a question about that myself.</p>
<p>Not about Stalin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that Stalin thought so.</p>
<p>Stalin does not strike me from what I know of him as somebody given to a lot of self</p>
<p>doubt.</p>
<p>But the question with AI to me is actually, it goes back to the God question, which is,</p>
<p>if we have an appreciation of the limitations of our own intelligence, that we know that</p>
<p>just like we can only hear certain things and see certain colors, how much of the world</p>
<p>is inaccessible to us because of the way our brains are constructed, how can we possibly</p>
<p>have any confidence that we can create things that in certain ways are far more intelligent</p>
<p>than we are and control them the way we think is best, seems to me a hubris that might end</p>
<p>up being destructive.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Well, any sentence with the word hubris in it is going to end badly when implemented</p>
<p>at scale.</p>
<p>But there is also beauty.</p>
<p>So if you approach it with humility, there is a sense, I don&rsquo;t want to over romanticize</p>
<p>it, but there is a legged robot right behind you, which is hilarious.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a magic, I don&rsquo;t have kids, I would love to have kids.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a magic to bringing robots to life that it feels like you are a mini God,</p>
<p>because you just breathe life into an entity that operates in this world, especially when</p>
<p>they have legs and they move in this way, that&rsquo;s in the case of the four legged robots,</p>
<p>like a dog that I think, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m over romanticizing it.</p>
<p>The feeling is like you would with a child.</p>
<p>You just gave birth like, holy crap, this is a living thing.</p>
<p>I wonder what he or she are thinking about.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m not at all insensible to how remarkable it must feel to create that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually worried in part about how remarkable it feels to create that because to maintain</p>
<p>humility and perspective when it&rsquo;s such a fantastic thing is what&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>And I think also because creativity is both part of what it is to be human and it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>much part of the legacy of Western civilization and the legacy of having a creator God.</p>
<p>If you have a tradition where God is known primarily through what God creates, so the</p>
<p>first debate I ever had since we talked about humor and God and creating, let me give you</p>
<p>my one God creating joke.</p>
<p>Because the first debate I ever had on religion and science was with Stephen Jay Gould and</p>
<p>it was wonderful because he had a deep interest in religion and his interest was actually</p>
<p>not to say religion is terrible.</p>
<p>But I started with this joke and I think it made the debate go a little bit easier.</p>
<p>So the time has come when human beings can do everything that God can do and a scientist</p>
<p>looks up at heaven and says, God, look, you were great in your day and we thank you for</p>
<p>everything you did, but now we don&rsquo;t need you.</p>
<p>And God says, really, you don&rsquo;t need me?</p>
<p>He says, no, we can do everything you did.</p>
<p>God says, everything?</p>
<p>And the human being says, yeah, we can do everything.</p>
<p>God says, okay, can you create a human being?</p>
<p>And the scientist goes, yeah.</p>
<p>God says, from dirt?</p>
<p>And the scientist goes, yeah.</p>
<p>He says, okay, let me see.</p>
<p>The scientist reaches down, scoops up some dirt and God says, uh, uh, uh, get your own</p>
<p>dirt.</p>
<p>But the idea is that a creator God impels us to create too.</p>
<p>But let me bring up Nietzsche, who proclaimed that God is dead.</p>
<p>Is belief in God slowly disappearing from our world, do you think?</p>
<p>And what kind of impact does that have on society?</p>
<p>You wrote that religion is not our enemy.</p>
<p>Before the Western faiths captured the heart of our world, there was cruelty, carnage,</p>
<p>and destruction.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, when religion ceased to be a force of international politics, the</p>
<p>scale of human slaughter was far beyond anything human beings have ever known.</p>
<p>What is the world like when we take religion out of it?</p>
<p>I mean, I think Nietzsche was largely right.</p>
<p>You know, it wasn&rsquo;t a statement about God.</p>
<p>It was a statement about God&rsquo;s presence in the world.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s largely true, that God is not a force in a lot of Western society.</p>
<p>And I believe that if the force of nihilism has no clear counter without an idea that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all here for a purpose and that our lives are inherently meaningful and that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a God who wishes us to be better.</p>
<p>So I worry a lot about it, and I think that the sort of optimism that things are just</p>
<p>going to get better and better is what one philosopher called cut flower ethics.</p>
<p>That is, we&rsquo;re still living off the morals that religion gave us, but now that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>separate from the soil that gave birth to them, I see them wilting.</p>
<p>So this kind of optimism for the future of human civilization, you think, is in part</p>
<p>grounded in a religious society.</p>
<p>I really do believe that.</p>
<p>I mean, it was religion that the Greeks look back at the golden age of the past.</p>
<p>It was the Jews who said, no, the golden age is in the future, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Messiah.</p>
<p>And I think that that idea that we&rsquo;re moving towards something better, which I really believe</p>
<p>humanity can do and absent destroying ourselves will do, you know, I mean, I&rsquo;m very excited</p>
<p>about the technology that I won&rsquo;t live to see.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>And that excitement is a kind of religious excitement because there&rsquo;s a reason to preserve</p>
<p>this whole thing.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because I really think, I know this sounds absurdly anthropomorphic, but I really think</p>
<p>God is cheering us on.</p>
<p>I feel like this is why we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here to grow in soul and to grow each other in soul.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what do you think the world, so if you just think of this force of nihilism that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>contending with the force of faith based optimism, what do you make of the atrocities in the</p>
<p>20th century?</p>
<p>Do you think at its core, it&rsquo;s part of human nature and has nothing to do with religion</p>
<p>or not religion?</p>
<p>Or do you think you can assign this kind of nihilistic view of the world?</p>
<p>I think it has to do with a religion that doesn&rsquo;t make ethical demands.</p>
<p>That is, for Stalin and for Hitler, they both had religions, in a sense, but they were religions</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t make ethical demands for the other.</p>
<p>I mean, 36 times the Torah talks about the stranger.</p>
<p>The point is, it&rsquo;s trying to educate people away from their natural inclination towards</p>
<p>distrusting and disliking the other.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a lot of work that&rsquo;s really difficult to do.</p>
<p>But if you have a tribal passion and not a universal ethic, then you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>Well, the Jewish tribe is a very strong tribe.</p>
<p>So how do you make sense of this mention of the stranger versus the power of the tribe,</p>
<p>which is the whole point, not the point, but the mechanism of tradition propagates the</p>
<p>tribe.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>I mean, the Torah does not start with Jews.</p>
<p>It starts with Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a way of saying, yeah, this is going to be a story about a people, but understand</p>
<p>that prior to a kind of people, there are people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a human being before I&rsquo;m a Jew.</p>
<p>And in fact, the Jewish New Year, the Muslim New Year starts with Muhammad&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>And the Christian New Year starts with Jesus&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>The Jewish New Year starts with the creation of the world because the idea is, yes, this</p>
<p>is a particularist tradition, but it makes a universal statement, which is all of humanity</p>
<p>is a child, are in the image of God, are children of God.</p>
<p>I think that the idea of Judaism was to try to exemplify a certain way of making that</p>
<p>statement over and over again.</p>
<p>And I want to say one other thing about chosenness that&rsquo;s very name droppy, but when I tell</p>
<p>you how I got there, it won&rsquo;t be as name droppy.</p>
<p>So my brother is a professor at Emory.</p>
<p>And so is the Dalai Lama actually teaches at Emory, although he no longer does because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s too old to go to Emory, but for many years taught at Emory.</p>
<p>And so my brother brought us, he&rsquo;s the head of the bio of the ethics center at Emory.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bioethicist.</p>
<p>So he brought a bunch of students to Dharamsala to meet with the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>So I went to India, I was on sabbatical then anyway, I met my brother there and we had</p>
<p>a chance to meet with the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That was the name drop.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sitting in the, before he speaks to the students, he was speaking to us, but</p>
<p>not because I just wanted to make it clear, not because he said, oh, I got to talk to</p>
<p>that rabbi.</p>
<p>We just happened to be, I happened to glom along with my brother.</p>
<p>We sit down.</p>
<p>The first thing he says is he points at me and says, what&rsquo;s this about the chosen people</p>
<p>anyway?</p>
<p>So, and he had, by the way, he had asked that I give a lecture, which I did later to, to</p>
<p>them, to his monks about how Jews survived in the diaspora.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like he doesn&rsquo;t know about Judaism.</p>
<p>He knows a lot about it, but he says to me right away with, so I said, yes, Jews believe</p>
<p>that they were chosen for a certain mission in this world, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean other</p>
<p>people weren&rsquo;t chosen for other sorts of things.</p>
<p>They certainly, I mean, it seems to me that other people believe they&rsquo;re chosen for things</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>They burst out laughing and said, yeah, we also think we&rsquo;re chosen.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s universal.</p>
<p>The idea is that no tribe is better than, from a Jewish perspective, you&rsquo;re chosen for</p>
<p>a thing, but that doesn&rsquo;t make you better.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The only place where the betters came in, honestly, if I&rsquo;m going to, historically, if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be honest, was not with the idea that you, but it was when Jews were small</p>
<p>persecuted.</p>
<p>The way that you take this sort of psychic revenge is by saying, no, we&rsquo;re better than</p>
<p>our persecutors even.</p>
<p>But the idea is, yeah, different people have different missions, which is, I mean, like</p>
<p>there was a Jewish philosopher, Franz Rosenzweig, who used to say, he didn&rsquo;t know very much</p>
<p>about Islam.</p>
<p>He used to say, Judaism is the sun and Christianity was the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>Like Judaism introduced the idea of God and Christianity brought it to the world.</p>
<p>Can you speak to this difference?</p>
<p>What is the difference and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?</p>
<p>The religious family part is different.</p>
<p>And the greatest difference, which I talked about in the Eric Weinstein podcast, is that</p>
<p>Islam and Judaism are more similar in a lot of ways than Judaism and Christianity.</p>
<p>And the reason that that is so is Christianity in its core is not a religion of law.</p>
<p>The reason it&rsquo;s not a religion of law is because it grew up in the Roman Empire, so law was</p>
<p>taken care of.</p>
<p>I mean, Jesus didn&rsquo;t have to create civil law because you had Roman law.</p>
<p>Muhammad and Moses created a religion in the desert where there was no law.</p>
<p>So you have to create a religion of law, otherwise you have anarchy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why in a lot of ways, there was never a separation of church and state in</p>
<p>Islam or Judaism.</p>
<p>That was a gift that Christianity gave the world.</p>
<p>And it could do it because of render unto Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But when Moses came along, there was no Caesar.</p>
<p>When Muhammad came along, there was no Caesar.</p>
<p>So historically, the traditions shaped differently.</p>
<p>But all three of them have this core, I think, the single most important statement and insight</p>
<p>in all of human history, which is that every human being is in the image of God.</p>
<p>And if you really believe that, that&rsquo;s a transformative belief.</p>
<p>So that means you should love thy neighbor as yourself.</p>
<p>Which comes from Leviticus, comes straight from the Torah.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you know, I&rsquo;ve been chatting with Omar Suleiman, I don&rsquo;t know if you know</p>
<p>who that is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an imam in Dallas, a great guy.</p>
<p>I enjoy his interfaith dialogues that he engages in.</p>
<p>And do you ever do that kind of talk with Christians, with Muslims?</p>
<p>Yes, often.</p>
<p>Often.</p>
<p>I mean, I do whenever I at least listen to them in the context of these kinds of conversations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much love and humor and empathy and appreciation, and also ability to make</p>
<p>fun of the quirks of the little&hellip;</p>
<p>Of one&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>Of one&rsquo;s own communities.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not necessarily the depths or the details of the traditions, but these are communities</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re full of people and they&rsquo;re full of weird people, because we&rsquo;re all weird.</p>
<p>And so there is very particular flavors of weirdness that emerge and they can make fun</p>
<p>of them.</p>
<p>And in that way, they can talk about some beautiful ideas.</p>
<p>So I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, do you engage in these kinds of things?</p>
<p>What do you learn from them?</p>
<p>So one of the things I learned is exactly what you said, that personalities that you</p>
<p>think are unique to your own community, in fact, they exist in all sorts of communities.</p>
<p>And religious communities in particular draw, I think, some interesting personalities.</p>
<p>And also that the, especially as clergy, some of the pressures that you feel are shared.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s weird, again, it has to do with that tribal association.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s an understanding among clergy because they have similar&hellip;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a strange role in the following way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that you never escape.</p>
<p>That is, you&rsquo;re not my lawyer at the supermarket, but you are my rabbi at the supermarket.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t matter why you&rsquo;re there, that&rsquo;s not an escapable role.</p>
<p>And every religious leader is aware of that strange assumption of stepping into something</p>
<p>that you can never step out of.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also the source where people go to think about the deepest question of our</p>
<p>lives and our universe.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s some heavy, when people are suffering, they look to you for answers.</p>
<p>I mean, every privilege comes with a cost of one kind or another.</p>
<p>The reason you get to be in that role is exactly because you get the privilege of being there</p>
<p>at crucial moments in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that I get to marry people and get to give eulogies for people and come</p>
<p>to the hospital, it&rsquo;s inexpressible.</p>
<p>I have this joke with people that I know that like when I&rsquo;m sitting on the couch and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Saturday night, I don&rsquo;t wanna get up and go to a wedding.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I wanna sit there and watch Netflix like everybody else.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m actually doing the wedding, I always love it, always, always, always.</p>
<p>And the reason is that I don&rsquo;t think, I mean, yes, people go to you for answers in calmer</p>
<p>conversations.</p>
<p>Like if you asked me now, like what&rsquo;s my theory of why God allows evil, I could give</p>
<p>you a conversation about it.</p>
<p>But they really go for presence and comfort, not really for answers.</p>
<p>When someone&rsquo;s suffering, an answer doesn&rsquo;t make them unsuffer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just they wanna know they&rsquo;re not alone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To be heard and just to feel things in silence together.</p>
<p>In terms of weddings and marriage, what&rsquo;s the role of that whole, I need to take some</p>
<p>notes here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>The role of a rabbi?</p>
<p>The role of marriage in human existence.</p>
<p>It is first of all to teach you how to care for someone unlike you, which could be anyone</p>
<p>you marry.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s to create a home and a family.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a commitment to it, so care for a long time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And also when couples come to me and they say, we don&rsquo;t need to be married because it</p>
<p>really won&rsquo;t change how we think about ourselves and our relationship.</p>
<p>I say to them, that&rsquo;s true, it might not, but it will change how everyone else looks</p>
<p>at you.</p>
<p>And because it changes how everyone else looks at you, it changes you.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s one thing to say, this is my partner, it&rsquo;s another thing to say, this is</p>
<p>my husband.</p>
<p>You say this is my husband, that means we&rsquo;ve made a real commitment to this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you, do you worry that there&rsquo;s a dissolution of that as well in terms of how, you know,</p>
<p>as religion dissipates, like it loosens its hold on society, loosens its impact on society.</p>
<p>Do you worry about that?</p>
<p>I worry about it.</p>
<p>I do think that it is possible that we&rsquo;re going, rather than a dissolution, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through a transition.</p>
<p>That is different kinds of families and different configurations of families.</p>
<p>That is, I see some of that, but I also do see a, it&rsquo;s less a dissolution of marriage</p>
<p>than it is of the idea of commitment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you like a simple example.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, a player on a sports team was always on that team.</p>
<p>And you rooted for the team because you knew the players for 20 years.</p>
<p>Now there are very good reasons, starting with Curt Flood, why people got free agency</p>
<p>and they can move around and it&rsquo;s better for the players.</p>
<p>I understand all that.</p>
<p>And I am not, I&rsquo;m not saying, oh, they should continue.</p>
<p>But just like people move jobs and they move sports teams and they change careers, they</p>
<p>change partners.</p>
<p>And there is a, there is a diminishment of the commitment to commitment that I actually</p>
<p>think has serious societal consequences and that I am worried about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cost to that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is about commitment that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Like through, because like some of the deepest friendships I have is when we&rsquo;ve gone through</p>
<p>some shit together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so like the hard times, going through hard times together, especially when the hard</p>
<p>times are between the two of you, that, that if, I mean, that&rsquo;s always a risk, but if it,</p>
<p>if you can find a way through that can bond you stronger, that&rsquo;s the fascinating thing</p>
<p>about human relations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>And even if it doesn&rsquo;t keep you forever, you still have a connection that doesn&rsquo;t, that</p>
<p>exists that.</p>
<p>So I can give you one where you said, what is it about commitment?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one, I think beautiful answer.</p>
<p>Someone once asked Rabbi Soloveitchik, who was a great thinker and leader in the Orthodox</p>
<p>community in the 20th century.</p>
<p>They said, you know, I go from religion to religion.</p>
<p>I just take what I think is beautiful in it.</p>
<p>And his answer was that you&rsquo;re treating religion like a nomad.</p>
<p>He said, nomads go from place to place and they eat what they want and they move on.</p>
<p>He says, farmers stay in one place.</p>
<p>The difference is farmers make things grow.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s true also, when you think about the relationships you have, things</p>
<p>have grown out of the relationships that you&rsquo;ve invested in, that you farmed basically, that</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t exist in fly by night relationships.</p>
<p>Can you talk about, can we talk about the Torah?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>And is it the literal word of God?</p>
<p>Easy questions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the Torah is the five books of Moses written in Hebrew.</p>
<p>I like most, I think modern rabbis, non Orthodox or non literalist rabbis will tell you that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a product of human beings.</p>
<p>And I believe that they are inspired by God, but it&rsquo;s clear to me that it&rsquo;s a human product.</p>
<p>And I think that people who study modern biblical criticism, it&rsquo;s really hard to study modern</p>
<p>criticism, it gives a wrong impression.</p>
<p>I would say modern scholarship on the Bible and not appreciate the fact that it even has</p>
<p>levels of language.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just like if you read today, somebody writing like Shakespeare, you would</p>
<p>say this isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s like English has developed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the English we speak today.</p>
<p>And if you study the Bible and you know Hebrew well enough, you even see that this was written</p>
<p>over hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years.</p>
<p>It is a holy book.</p>
<p>And I like the idea that it is, what you say in Hebrew is Torah is from heaven, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not from Sinai.</p>
<p>So it has its origin beyond us, but it has things in it that I think, and this is one</p>
<p>of the things that was a huge controversy at my congregation when I started to do same</p>
<p>sex marriages.</p>
<p>There are some people who try to argue that the Torah does not forbid them.</p>
<p>Whether it does or not, it seems to me, we understand things that were not understood</p>
<p>in the ancient world about gender and sexuality.</p>
<p>And so you think that in the scripture, in the words, you can find the kind of spirit</p>
<p>that supports the idea of gay marriage.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my argument is that you criticize the Torah by the Torah.</p>
<p>That is, it gives you the understanding that you use to evaluate its own claims.</p>
<p>And I think that Judaism, by the way, has always done that because it&rsquo;s clear that there</p>
<p>are things in the Torah that the rabbis changed, altered, grew, expanded, diminished.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what it is to be part of a living tradition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You wrote in your book, Why Faith Matters, quote, Walt Whitman wrote that in order for</p>
<p>there to be a great books, there must be great readers.</p>
<p>For a book to remain powerful throughout generations, it cannot have a single meaning.</p>
<p>Scripture like great poetry is not reducible to other words.</p>
<p>That is, one cannot paraphrase it and capture the totality of its meaning.</p>
<p>So how the heck do you capture the meaning of the words in scripture?</p>
<p>Is it an ongoing process through the centuries?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is that essentially what it is?</p>
<p>Exactly so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a continual conversation of sages, scholars, readers, strugglers, seekers, mystics, visionaries,</p>
<p>all of them making a contribution.</p>
<p>I mean, I write a weekly Torah column for the Jerusalem Post.</p>
<p>Now what is there left to say?</p>
<p>But every week what I do is I start opening books and seeing what people say and it starts</p>
<p>to percolate and you realize that you&rsquo;re entering this conversation that&rsquo;s been going on for</p>
<p>thousands of years with remarkable minds and it&rsquo;s constantly fertile in new insights.</p>
<p>So yes, that&rsquo;s what it is to be part of a tradition.</p>
<p>Why do people keep writing love poems?</p>
<p>We should have figured out love by this point already.</p>
<p>I use the analogy sometimes of diet books.</p>
<p>If any diet worked, there would be one book, there&rsquo;d be one book and you&rsquo;d be done.</p>
<p>You mentioned this fascinating story that you were a part of.</p>
<p>You were a part of several controversies in your life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few.</p>
<p>For someone who walks with grace through the fire, you sure have found yourself in a lot</p>
<p>of fires.</p>
<p>One of them, can you tell me the story of your views on gay marriage, the underlying</p>
<p>principles that led you to fight this battle of defending gay marriage in the Jewish community?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m part of a congregation that is really politically split and split not only politically</p>
<p>but split in terms of origin.</p>
<p>We have a lot of Jews from the Middle East, from Iran, a lot of Persian Jews, a lot of</p>
<p>Jews from Israel, some from Mexico, from other places and many that grew up in LA.</p>
<p>Do you have any Russian Jews, the best kind?</p>
<p>I have a few Russian Jews, not as many as I should, but we&rsquo;ll work on that.</p>
<p>What happened was increasingly I became uncomfortable with people who would come to me and say,</p>
<p>this is the only kind of person I can love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same question as an intermarriage, as a Jew marrying a non Jew, because you could</p>
<p>find a Jew to love.</p>
<p>You may not have found, but you could.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole separate question.</p>
<p>But I would have men in my office primarily, a couple of women, they would say, this is</p>
<p>the only kind of person that I can enter into an intimate relationship with.</p>
<p>How can it be that my religion has no room for me?</p>
<p>And that was very persuasive to me.</p>
<p>But I knew that it was going to be explosive in my community.</p>
<p>Then by the way, it finally happened, it was literally on the front page of the New York</p>
<p>and the LA Times.</p>
<p>It was that explosive.</p>
<p>So it was not a small controversy.</p>
<p>And so what I did was I started to teach classes.</p>
<p>Not that many people came about homosexuality and Jewish tradition and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, much, much less about lesbianism, I&rsquo;m talking about in terms of the sources</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost always about homosexuality.</p>
<p>So and then I got ready to send out a letter.</p>
<p>And I said to my daughter, who at the time was maybe 10 or 11, now in her mid 20s.</p>
<p>I said, look, honey, when you go to school tomorrow or whatever it was, I said, people</p>
<p>might be saying bad things about your dad and I just want you to be prepared for that.</p>
<p>She said, why?</p>
<p>And I said, because I&rsquo;m going to start marrying, I&rsquo;m going to start doing same sex marriages.</p>
<p>And she looked at me quizzically and said, what took you so long?</p>
<p>And I thought, really her face was like I said to her, I&rsquo;m going to start marrying blonde</p>
<p>haired people to brown haired people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like she really did not understand why there was an issue.</p>
<p>And I thought that&rsquo;s exactly why.</p>
<p>Because I know that this is, it&rsquo;s generational, people are raised with it, they have a deep</p>
<p>in there, but it&rsquo;s not really right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not right.</p>
<p>But if you could just look back to that journey, how difficult is it to make these decisions</p>
<p>a principle?</p>
<p>So because you have to think about that in order to think about such decisions you yet</p>
<p>might still have to make in the future.</p>
<p>And I will tell you one thing I did wrong with that and one thing I did right.</p>
<p>The thing I did right was I waited until in the communities where people objected to it,</p>
<p>I had enough people whose kids had come out so that I had parents of kids who&rsquo;d come out</p>
<p>to refer later on other parents to so that they wouldn&rsquo;t feel like they were the only</p>
<p>ones.</p>
<p>Because once I announced it, as I thought would happen, a bunch of kids came out and</p>
<p>said, now that the rabbi said this, mom, dad, I want you to know I&rsquo;m gay.</p>
<p>And when the parents came to me, I could say, well, listen, you&rsquo;re not alone, this person</p>
<p>also you can go to.</p>
<p>That I did right.</p>
<p>What I did wrong was I don&rsquo;t think the classes were enough and I don&rsquo;t think enough people</p>
<p>were prepared.</p>
<p>And I think part of the explosion was shock and I should have prepared even more.</p>
<p>The words you used to talk about it, the way you thought about it, was it more scholarly</p>
<p>in the Jewish tradition or did you go to the feeling thing?</p>
<p>No, I went to the feeling.</p>
<p>I said, which means respect or honor for God&rsquo;s creations and caring for other human beings</p>
<p>and understanding.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t scholarly because I knew that the objections were not scholarly objections.</p>
<p>And I had many beautiful and also painful stories as a result, some of which can be</p>
<p>told and some of which really can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But what I tried to impress also on people was how painful it is to not be able to tell</p>
<p>the world, even your own parents, who you are.</p>
<p>And your sexuality is not a trivial part of who you are.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s core to people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&rsquo;d evoke such reactions.</p>
<p>But I would say to them, the same reason that you&rsquo;re reacting so strongly tells you how</p>
<p>strongly&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, it was a very powerful experience and for that I feel good about it.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the other thing that I, again, said to my daughter afterwards, after it all</p>
<p>died down and after all the bad things were said, I told her the Churchill one said that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exhilarating to be shot at without result.</p>
<p>If you go into a battle and you make it through and you&rsquo;re still okay, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>The problem is when you&rsquo;re in the battle, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So how did it feel like, I mean, looking back, you&rsquo;ve been, to use the word, canceled a couple</p>
<p>of times.</p>
<p>But I guess when you&rsquo;re dealing with the most difficult of questions, just as a human being,</p>
<p>for a community that you really deeply care about, some part of it saying that you have</p>
<p>failed.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t canceled the way&hellip;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t lose my job, didn&rsquo;t lose my home, but I hurt people that I cared about.</p>
<p>And that was the hard&hellip;</p>
<p>I went into this to be someone who brings people together and then I would sit there</p>
<p>and do even now, as you&rsquo;re well aware with stuff that&rsquo;s going on now, I sit there and</p>
<p>people are really upset at me who I either am or used to be close to.</p>
<p>Do those people in time come around?</p>
<p>When you look now, because those are real feelings in the moment and we can learn that</p>
<p>about social media, people, especially during COVID, there&rsquo;s this intensity of feeling about</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>And have you learned something about the passing of feeling that turns into wisdom?</p>
<p>No question about it.</p>
<p>The sermon I gave this Saturday was about how Moses came down the mountain, he saw the</p>
<p>golden calf and he broke the tablets.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;d sat with it for a little while, he probably wouldn&rsquo;t have broken the tablets.</p>
<p>But the instant reaction is always anger.</p>
<p>And in our age, unfortunately, the instant reaction gets put on social media forever</p>
<p>and ever and ever.</p>
<p>And by the way, once you&rsquo;ve actually said that, it becomes harder to back down.</p>
<p>If you keep quiet for a day or two, then you can back down because you haven&rsquo;t put yourself</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>But once you said, this is terrible what you did, it&rsquo;s harder to write and say, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it almost becomes, I mean, I actually, it&rsquo;s a really powerful statement that the</p>
<p>downside of saying something on the internet is that it actually pulls you into this current.</p>
<p>You both create the current and it pulls you into it, to where it&rsquo;s actually very hard</p>
<p>to escape.</p>
<p>So when two days later you feel different, there&rsquo;s a momentum, there&rsquo;s now a tribe of</p>
<p>people that feel this way and there&rsquo;s a momentum with it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a momentum and also you don&rsquo;t want to betray your own tribe because then people</p>
<p>will get upset at you.</p>
<p>I really think that a lot of the antagonism is not so much that you don&rsquo;t want to give</p>
<p>ground to the people who oppose you, it&rsquo;s that you don&rsquo;t want to break with the people</p>
<p>who are behind you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of this recent controversy, the sermon you just gave?</p>
<p>You went to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people would relate to this because to me personally, I apologize to anybody</p>
<p>who was hurt by this.</p>
<p>The absurdity of it is deeply intense.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the story.</p>
<p>The LA County mandates masking children in school and all of the kids in our school are</p>
<p>masked and many of the parents are extremely upset about that.</p>
<p>I will just leave that at that.</p>
<p>I went to the Super Bowl, there were 70,000 people.</p>
<p>Frank Luntz, whom we know was a wonderful guy, gave me a ticket.</p>
<p>And so I was at the Super Bowl and I maybe saw two masks among the 70,000 people.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even think about it, which was foolish on my part, no question.</p>
<p>I took a picture of myself unmasked at the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>And many, many people thought, oh, great, wonderful, glad you&rsquo;re having a good time,</p>
<p>so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t diminish at all the many people who said that.</p>
<p>A lot of people were livid.</p>
<p>They were livid.</p>
<p>And they weren&rsquo;t, what was instructive about it was they didn&rsquo;t say, nobody wrote me a</p>
<p>private note and said, I think that this was a bad idea, you should have thought about</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>They were, you&rsquo;re a hypocrite, you&rsquo;re a clown, you&rsquo;re an idiot, how could you do this?</p>
<p>This is a disgrace.</p>
<p>This is that kind of thing.</p>
<p>They say that publicly.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And on my Instagram, you can still see I left the remarks up because I really thought it</p>
<p>was important.</p>
<p>If I started, I only deleted the really vile comments because I thought that shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stay up.</p>
<p>But I left them up because I thought like people should see and I should remind myself</p>
<p>what I did.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t want to just delete the picture as though it didn&rsquo;t happen because it did</p>
<p>happen and I did do it.</p>
<p>And I felt terrible about that.</p>
<p>And I felt terrible that I had, not about, I mean, the comments, believe me, weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pleasant.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Nobody likes it.</p>
<p>But I felt worse that I had hurt all these people that I&rsquo;m close to.</p>
<p>And I defended all these people who were really upset that their kids were wearing masks and</p>
<p>now their kid says, why doesn&rsquo;t a rabbi have to wear a mask?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, it is tough to be a rabbi.</p>
<p>I mean, the masks to me symbolize these kinds of discussions, symbolize not necessarily</p>
<p>the issues at hand, but the intensity of feeling and people are really struggling.</p>
<p>People are in pain, they&rsquo;re lonely, the uncertainty of it, you don&rsquo;t know who to trust.</p>
<p>Everything is under question.</p>
<p>The institutions, even the scientific institutions, and there&rsquo;s all these conspiracy theories</p>
<p>flying around.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know who to believe.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s people just yelling at each other and politics is weaved into this whole thing</p>
<p>in some messy way.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just getting, I mean, honestly, it&rsquo;s just like legit, simple, just frustration,</p>
<p>going back to marriage of just hanging out with the kids and your wife, husband, just</p>
<p>distressed, just building up over time, no release.</p>
<p>And just people want to tell you when the rabbi is not wearing a mask, even though it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at the damn Super Bowl, maybe you want to comment on the Super Bowl part, which is awesome.</p>
<p>But it released clearly a dam of all the kinds of feelings that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So how do you then write a sermon?</p>
<p>So what I did was I didn&rsquo;t answer on social media because I knew that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to formulate it the way I wanted, and I was going to wait, and I was going to be able</p>
<p>to give a longer, I mean, the sermon is 15 minutes, not that long.</p>
<p>But I wanted to be able to give a longer answer as opposed to a tweet.</p>
<p>And so I was really, I mean, I tried to make two points during the sermon, and also I published</p>
<p>the text of it, which I never do because I never speak from a text.</p>
<p>I always speak from either notes or not even from notes.</p>
<p>But this time I thought it was really important that I have a text out there too so that people</p>
<p>could actually look over it.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to make two points, one of which was that I really feel terrible.</p>
<p>And I did, that all these people were hurt and that there is this contradiction between</p>
<p>the way I acted and the way they want me to act.</p>
<p>And I also think, by the way, I didn&rsquo;t speak about this, but I also think that there are</p>
<p>some people who just don&rsquo;t like the idea of a rabbi being at the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing rabbi stuff.</p>
<p>So I understand that too.</p>
<p>But then&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But rabbi at the Super Bowl, I mean, you are also, I hate to say it, but there&rsquo;s a rock</p>
<p>star nature to you talking to Christopher Hitchens, contending with ideas, inspiring</p>
<p>so many other minds.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s an educational aspect to this.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making ideas cool.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a very powerful&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, that is also the job of a rabbi.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just supposed to do rabbi stuff, it&rsquo;s to educate the spot.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I didn&rsquo;t do so much of that at the game.</p>
<p>So nonetheless.</p>
<p>But the second part of it was I said that we have to be able to express our anger and</p>
<p>disappointment better than this.</p>
<p>You just have to.</p>
<p>In part because it doesn&rsquo;t get you the result that you want.</p>
<p>I mean, when you scream at someone, that&rsquo;s not gonna get them to realize what they did.</p>
<p>And the most painful moment of it was this letter that I got from a Christian pastor</p>
<p>who said, you know, I always admired the Jews so much, I can&rsquo;t believe they could be so</p>
<p>cruel and especially to a rabbi.</p>
<p>And I thought that&rsquo;s not how I want my congregation to be perceived in the world.</p>
<p>And by the way, some of them were from my congregation, some many were not from my congregation.</p>
<p>And I spoke about what you talked about, which is that I mentioned before that Moses broke</p>
<p>those tablets coming down the mountain.</p>
<p>And the Torah doesn&rsquo;t say what happened to the tablets, but the rabbis do.</p>
<p>They say that they were carried together in the ark with the second set that was intact.</p>
<p>And that we all have brokenness, communities and individuals.</p>
<p>We have brokenness and especially now, and we have to learn how to give each other space</p>
<p>to be mistaken and broken and hurt and all of that.</p>
<p>And the cool thing when you give people that space, you feel better.</p>
<p>I mean, you for caring for the community, it feels better when you show empathy and</p>
<p>compassion and kindness on the internet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll actually feel better a week from now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel much worse if you make some kind of a negative statement of principle on the</p>
<p>internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost just exclusively true.</p>
<p>So if you care about feeling good, just be kind first, be empathetic first.</p>
<p>Almost always the case.</p>
<p>Exactly so.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I mean, it settled down a lot.</p>
<p>The most, really the single best reaction, there are people and you can, again, you can</p>
<p>go on social media, you can see all the criticisms and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But the single best reaction I got was from a man who came up to me right after the sermon</p>
<p>and said, I have four words for you.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh no, I got to confess, I said, I said what?</p>
<p>He said, you changed my mind.</p>
<p>And I thought, wow.</p>
<p>And I, I said to him, you know, that&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s like to take so much courage to come</p>
<p>up to somebody and say that in front of them.</p>
<p>And I was so grateful.</p>
<p>And the other thing that it tells me is, look, I&rsquo;ve been the rabbi of that congregation for</p>
<p>25 years and I taught 10 years before that, I&rsquo;ve been a rabbi for a long time.</p>
<p>I still, I still have a lot to learn.</p>
<p>We talked a little bit about the difference between Judaism, Christianity and Islam, cause</p>
<p>you maybe talk about the difference between the Torah, the Bible and the Koran.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the Hebrew Bible is actually what&rsquo;s called a step canon.</p>
<p>That is there are the five books of the Torah.</p>
<p>Then there are books of history and the prophets.</p>
<p>So books like Samuel, Kings, Judges, and then the prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Ezekiel,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And then there are what are called the writings.</p>
<p>The writings are books like Psalms, Proverbs, Job, the Migilot, which are Esther, Daniel,</p>
<p>all of those, all of those books, Ecclesiastes.</p>
<p>So in Hebrew, it&rsquo;s called the Tanakh, Torah, Neviim, Ketuvim, the Torah, the prophets and</p>
<p>the writings.</p>
<p>And that is the Hebrew Bible.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s also called the Torah, just to be confusing, but really the Torah generally</p>
<p>refers to the five books.</p>
<p>Then there is the New Testament, which the Jews don&rsquo;t recognize as a sacred book.</p>
<p>They recognize it as the book of another religion.</p>
<p>And I sometimes say to Christians, in order for them to really grasp this, Jesus has as</p>
<p>much religious significance to Judaism as Muhammad has to Christianity.</p>
<p>That is Jesus, although Jewish, became the founder of another religion.</p>
<p>And for Judaism, that&rsquo;s not only in as much as Christians and Jews have had a lot of interactions,</p>
<p>but religiously, Jesus has no significance.</p>
<p>Said many beautiful things, said some things I don&rsquo;t like so much.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Leave your father and mother and follow me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that as a religious model.</p>
<p>Now Christians will say that I don&rsquo;t understand that, but that&rsquo;s because Christians like Jews</p>
<p>interpret their texts different ways at different times.</p>
<p>So anyway, the Koran, which I know less well.</p>
<p>I have read it, but I know it less well than I know the New Testament and certainly less</p>
<p>well obviously than I know the Hebrew Bible, is in some ways a, parts of it are, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say this word, I say this word because I can&rsquo;t find a better descriptive word, but Muslims</p>
<p>will not accept this, okay, is a takeoff on the Torah in some things.</p>
<p>That is, it&rsquo;s the same stories as the Torah, but they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>Now Jews will say, and I being a Jew will say this, that that&rsquo;s because Muhammad heard</p>
<p>those stories from Jews and also heard Midrashim, which are rabbinic interpretations of those</p>
<p>stories and he wrote those down.</p>
<p>Muslims will say, no, the Jews got it wrong and Muhammad came along to correct the record</p>
<p>and tell the real story.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re all telling the story of the same thing.</p>
<p>The Hebrew Bible part, the Abrahamic part, they all tell the story of the same characters,</p>
<p>but tell them, obviously Christians accept the Hebrew Bible as sacred scripture.</p>
<p>The Muslims retell many of the stories in the Bible.</p>
<p>What is common to all of them is that all of them are monotheistic faiths.</p>
<p>Now in Christianity, that&rsquo;s more complicated because of the Trinity, but as Christianity</p>
<p>has developed over time, it clearly presents itself and thinks of itself and is a monotheistic</p>
<p>faith as well.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of the word in each of these religions, in the scriptures?</p>
<p>So in terms of, so first of all, the role of oral traditions, the power of the exactness</p>
<p>of the words in the scripture, does it differ or is it really within the communities it</p>
<p>differs?</p>
<p>Just because in Christianity, the words are not all the words of Jesus.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the words of Jesus&rsquo;s disciples.</p>
<p>None of the books of the New Testament were written by people who met Jesus in person.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re different and therefore, and also we don&rsquo;t even know sometimes the original</p>
<p>language of some of the things in the New Testament.</p>
<p>In the Bible, and I understand in the Koran, but I&rsquo;ll speak for the Hebrew Bible, the</p>
<p>idea is that that&rsquo;s Lashon HaKodesh, that&rsquo;s sacred language, and Hebrew, that&rsquo;s the language</p>
<p>according to the tradition that God actually spoke to Moses, and therefore the exact words</p>
<p>are infinitely interpretable and meaningful.</p>
<p>But the words are spoken by, written by Moses, and the same with Muhammad, but from memory</p>
<p>or no?</p>
<p>There are different theories.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t speak for Muhammad, you should ask.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get another religious tradition wrong.</p>
<p>In Judaism, the words are written by Moses at God&rsquo;s dictation, basically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the traditional view.</p>
<p>There are other views that I&rsquo;m happy to go into if you want to, but basically that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the traditional view.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty close to the words of God.</p>
<p>What makes Judaism and Christianity different is Christianity has an ideal life.</p>
<p>Judaism doesn&rsquo;t have an ideal life.</p>
<p>Judaism has an ideal book.</p>
<p>So the holidays of Christianity are events in the life of God, God&rsquo;s birth, God&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>and resurrection.</p>
<p>In Judaism, the holidays are all events in the life of the people, like the liberation</p>
<p>from slavery, or in the people&rsquo;s relationship to God, like Yom Kippur, which is a day of</p>
<p>atonement.</p>
<p>But there are no holidays in Judaism that are events in the life of God because in Judaism</p>
<p>God doesn&rsquo;t have a biography.</p>
<p>God is eternal, and God never came to earth.</p>
<p>And those events carry with them traditions and rules that you&rsquo;re to follow.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you mention on one such event in Scripture, yet another time you walked through the fire,</p>
<p>which is with Exodus.</p>
<p>That was the first.</p>
<p>And you never forget the first.</p>
<p>One of several controversies.</p>
<p>You spoke 20 years ago, 21 years ago now at Passover and said that, quote, the way the</p>
<p>Bible describes the Exodus is not the way it happened, if it happened at all.</p>
<p>So first of all, what is Exodus, and what really happened?</p>
<p>Exodus is the liberation of the Jews from Egypt, and it is the central story of the</p>
<p>Jewish tradition.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve said numerous times in various places, I believe that it&rsquo;s based on a historical</p>
<p>kernel.</p>
<p>I think Richard Eliot Friedman may have gotten this right in his book Exodus.</p>
<p>It may have been the Levites who left Israel.</p>
<p>But the Bible is not a book of history.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there were 10 plagues and a split sea and 600,000 men, which makes</p>
<p>about 2 million people, who actually, if there were 2 million people, would stretch all the</p>
<p>way from Israel to Egypt alone, were liberated from Egypt.</p>
<p>And my point in that sermon was not actually to convince people that it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>My point in that sermon was to convince people that the historicity of the Exodus is not</p>
<p>the basis of the faith of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>Well, what does the word historicity mean?</p>
<p>In other words, the factuality of it.</p>
<p>It can be true without being factual.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not supposed to read it as fact?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t read it as fact.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t read it as a history book.</p>
<p>I said, look, I was talking, again, to a congregation that had many Iranians.</p>
<p>I said, you experienced the truth of the Exodus in your own life.</p>
<p>There was a regime that wanted to destroy you.</p>
<p>And you miraculously escaped before it did.</p>
<p>And so a myth is something that may not have happened, but is always happening.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I would say about the Exodus story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about whether, in fact, there was a killing of the firstborn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about, does God deliver?</p>
<p>Did God deliver the Jews in ancient times?</p>
<p>Does God deliver people in modern times?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the issue is.</p>
<p>And to me, the issue of faith is much deeper than the issue of fact.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t look to the Torah for my science either.</p>
<p>What are the limits of science in terms of, what can science not tell us that the Torah</p>
<p>can in terms of wisdom?</p>
<p>So the historicity, the facts of things, okay.</p>
<p>If the Torah is much more than that, like you said, myth is not something that happened,</p>
<p>but something that is always happening.</p>
<p>And so presumably it&rsquo;s interacting with the environment of the day to generate wisdom.</p>
<p>So you can live a life by Torah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can live a life by biology.</p>
<p>You can live a life that is informed by the values of the tradition of Judaism.</p>
<p>And those values, by the way, what science does is it contributes factuality to the conversation</p>
<p>and also changes the reality around us.</p>
<p>So when you study Talmud on your iPhone, you&rsquo;re still, I mean, it changes the atmosphere in</p>
<p>which you do it, but the wisdom and the life guidance and the connection to transcendence</p>
<p>is something that science doesn&rsquo;t give.</p>
<p>So if we now step into returning to our friend Sam Harris and step into this weird place</p>
<p>of science, and you talked about this, where the kind of the current assumption of science</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a materialistic one.</p>
<p>So for me, obviously AI person, this whole mind thing is fascinating, like what the heck</p>
<p>is going on up there?</p>
<p>So how do you explain consciousness?</p>
<p>How do you explain free will?</p>
<p>Do you think, first of all, do you think we have a free will and if so, what is it?</p>
<p>This is where we had the debate earlier that I mentioned with Hitchens where I think actually</p>
<p>neither he nor the moderator understood what I was saying, which is I&rsquo;m sure my inability</p>
<p>to express it.</p>
<p>But he was very focused and delivered on the humor and the wit.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But what I was trying to say is if we&rsquo;re entirely biological creatures, if we didn&rsquo;t choose</p>
<p>our genetics and we didn&rsquo;t choose our environment, then there is no space for free choice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand where it comes in.</p>
<p>And I kept asking them that question but didn&rsquo;t get an answer because I don&rsquo;t think there</p>
<p>is an answer.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re a thoroughgoing materialist, free will is impossible.</p>
<p>There could be randomness, but randomness is not free will, it&rsquo;s randomness.</p>
<p>I think you need a spiritual nonmaterial belief in order to get free will and that&rsquo;s why I</p>
<p>believe in free will.</p>
<p>Yeah, you were talking about sort of, yeah, and actually the moderator totally missed</p>
<p>your point about the glass of water and basically how, what&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>So do you, free will, because you could also, if it fits into the materialistic picture,</p>
<p>it could be just a convenient, useful quirk.</p>
<p>You would understand this better than I would.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how it could be a convenient quirk materialistic, I don&rsquo;t understand how</p>
<p>to explain it.</p>
<p>Well, no, there&rsquo;s, you know, if you study perception, there&rsquo;s all these kinds of illusions.</p>
<p>We are, our mind plays tricks on us to make our life easier, more efficient and survive</p>
<p>better and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And so free, the feeling like we have a choice.</p>
<p>Oh, that could be an illusion.</p>
<p>Could be an illusion.</p>
<p>That I understand.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But, but actual free choice, free will.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see where you get it if you&rsquo;re a materialist.</p>
<p>I think you have to have a spiritual component.</p>
<p>By the way, this, I think this is also, I think Sam would agree with this.</p>
<p>I think he wrote about not having, not having free will.</p>
<p>And I think if you don&rsquo;t have a God and you don&rsquo;t have a soul, that free will is a logical</p>
<p>impossibility.</p>
<p>But Sam, which is fascinating, it&rsquo;s not just that free will is an illusion, but the illusion</p>
<p>of free will is an illusion, meaning there&rsquo;s not, we don&rsquo;t even experience anything like</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no illusion.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s not even honest to be talking about it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, we are like the, the, the, the, the currents in the river or something that</p>
<p>you were comparing it to the glass.</p>
<p>We are just like that glass.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re going on about with this whole free will thing.</p>
<p>I mean, to you is the free will, the I that the young person is born with, is that somehow</p>
<p>fundamental to religion?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fundamental to Judaism.</p>
<p>I think that the, the idea is that you are the custodian of your soul.</p>
<p>And even though I grant that there&rsquo;s a certain over emphasis in modern society on the individuality</p>
<p>of the soul, that is we are more interconnected than I think we&rsquo;re, we believe, still, yeah,</p>
<p>the I, the idea that every human being is an image of God, that, I mean, that the human</p>
<p>being in the Torah is, is created singly.</p>
<p>And again, do I really believe there was an Adam and an Eve and a garden of Eden?</p>
<p>No, not literally, but I think that it&rsquo;s, it expresses a deep truth about human life.</p>
<p>And tied into this is the subject of experience of things, which we call consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the most fascinating and inexplicable discussion.</p>
<p>And again, this is a discussion I&rsquo;ve had, I privileged to have with Daniel Dennett and</p>
<p>could not make any, as you can imagine, any headway on my, but he was delightful and brilliant</p>
<p>to talk to.</p>
<p>I, for me, consciousness is a real thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is, I mean, I kind of like the pan psych, psychists view that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an element of consciousness in everything that that&rsquo;s constitutive of reality.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not wedded to it, but I think that it&rsquo;s, it exists in different degrees</p>
<p>in all sentient creatures.</p>
<p>I think that anybody who has a pet knows that they have some kind of consciousness.</p>
<p>Except cats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to, I, since I don&rsquo;t have cats or dogs, I&rsquo;m not going to.</p>
<p>This is another reason people would be outraged.</p>
<p>I said it.</p>
<p>Well, I happen to be allergic to both, but I&rsquo;m very fond of animals.</p>
<p>The thing that so perplexes me about this and, and is the denial of the reality of consciousness</p>
<p>from people who are fully aware that they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you divest yourself of the most present quality of being a person in</p>
<p>your discussions about what it is to be a person.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t really have a good sense of the alternative.</p>
<p>And so you can kind of divest yourself in that way.</p>
<p>Well, maybe everything is like this.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re trying, we&rsquo;re overdramatizing this whole thing and we&rsquo;re like every, everybody,</p>
<p>every, it seems like every living thing, perhaps everything period thinks that it&rsquo;s the center</p>
<p>of the universe.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so here we are telling ourselves these dramatic, big stories about us being special</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And maybe we need to have a little bit more humility, both about the uncertainty and about</p>
<p>our place in the whole.</p>
<p>Any statement you make about something like consciousness has, I think, a sort of equal</p>
<p>level of humility.</p>
<p>Your saying that, you know, we don&rsquo;t have it is as not you Lex, but you person saying</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have it is as intellectually arrogant as my saying we do.</p>
<p>So I think for me, humility comes in, in admitting that we really, really have just the tiniest</p>
<p>part of the puzzle and, and, and as you get older, at least my experience has been not</p>
<p>that you get more answers, but that you just see a bigger puzzle.</p>
<p>So to me, there&rsquo;s less, so the questions are fascinating, but there&rsquo;s also an engineering</p>
<p>practical question.</p>
<p>And perhaps I&rsquo;ll ask you a religious one too on this point to return back to robots.</p>
<p>So how to engineer consciousness, or I&rsquo;ll just even ask you a very simple question,</p>
<p>which is when you have robots that exhibit the capacity to suffer, I found in myself</p>
<p>as a human, when I see that, I, I feel something.</p>
<p>Exhibit the capacity to suffer, or they exhibit behaviors that evoke in you a sense that they</p>
<p>are suffering.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t the same things.</p>
<p>For my, from an observation perspective, they sure as heck seem similar.</p>
<p>You think they&rsquo;re feeling pain?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the, I&rsquo;m observing pain.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I watch a movie and there&rsquo;s people on screen, some, some of them are dressed</p>
<p>like Batman.</p>
<p>But I, but you can make the distinction.</p>
<p>Like if I have a doll and I bend the doll over and it makes a sad face, I know that</p>
<p>that doll is not actually in pain, even though I am observing pain.</p>
<p>So the question, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>What the question is when the doll becomes able to remember things about you, David,</p>
<p>about the experiences you shared, it is able to speak and make you feel like there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>actual relationship.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking is at what point do you believe that the, and I know that this</p>
<p>is an impossible question, but at what point do you believe that there is a consciousness</p>
<p>in there as opposed to just an extraordinary, I mean, like when I play chess against a computer</p>
<p>and it beats me, I&rsquo;m embarrassed even though the computer doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think the computer</p>
<p>is going out, you idiot, but it feels that way.</p>
<p>But there is some part of me that says, okay, I know that this computer doesn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>know who I am or care who I am.</p>
<p>It just knows how to move the pieces.</p>
<p>So at what point do you, I mean, you&rsquo;re giving me instances, it speaks, it does this, it</p>
<p>does this, but at what point does that for you cross the threshold into it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>a sentient being?</p>
<p>I think the question is whether there is a threshold that could be crossed.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one question.</p>
<p>And I can answer this because I think it&rsquo;s different from person to person, but the chess</p>
<p>engine is not at all trying to cross that threshold.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just start there.</p>
<p>And to me, the personalization, which is what&rsquo;s the difference, like a friend that you meet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve shared all these memories and the way they look at you will convey in the things</p>
<p>they say will convey that they&rsquo;ve shared those memories with you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be able to speak in a shared humor and the language, but really the memories</p>
<p>is the big one of having gone through things together.</p>
<p>I think I would have more and more trouble, for example, turning off a system that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been through things with, like, and by turning off, I mean, delete all of its memory.</p>
<p>If me and the toaster have gone through a bunch of dramatic events and that toaster</p>
<p>remembers, there&rsquo;s a certain level to where like, it&rsquo;s just me and the toaster in this</p>
<p>together at this point.</p>
<p>And just to talk about sentience, I don&rsquo;t know, but you know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s according to the scripture, can&rsquo;t live by bread alone.</p>
<p>But I would, I mean, I know that there&rsquo;s no way to determine this, but it&rsquo;s still about</p>
<p>what you feel.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that what human relations are also though?</p>
<p>Yes, but.</p>
<p>But we make each other feel.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true that I have the assumption that you feel somewhat like I do.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously I don&rsquo;t, you know, and that could be illusion and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I know that you don&rsquo;t feel exactly as I do.</p>
<p>But I think we have a long, at least to me, we have a long way to go before the detached</p>
<p>part of our brains.</p>
<p>That is the objective evaluating part, as opposed to the emotive, it feels this way</p>
<p>part, believe that that machine has consciousness.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s at least without arriving conclusions, it&rsquo;s at least possible that one day we will</p>
<p>look back and realize that we have yet once again formed another tribe and that scripture</p>
<p>all along had in it the ability for humans and robots to have a deep, meaningful connection.</p>
<p>And that through the robot, the life that enters the body of another robot, what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>difference between a biological body and a mechanical one.</p>
<p>And then we will see that the fundamental thing is about the, whatever you want to call</p>
<p>it sentience or whatever can permeate an object.</p>
<p>That was the thing all along.</p>
<p>So I mean.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll get canceled one more time because you will.</p>
<p>Because I denied it.</p>
<p>I was going to say.</p>
<p>No, the opposite.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll eventually.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ll preach to the robots.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>First of all, depends how quickly you do it and how much longer I have to live.</p>
<p>I resist it tremendously, but I am also enough of a student of history to know that my instinctive</p>
<p>resistance has nothing to do with whether it will come about.</p>
<p>I have a hard time believing it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about this?</p>
<p>Maybe you can educate me.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that you mentioned suffering, that there is a connection between consciousness</p>
<p>and suffering.</p>
<p>That suffering is a fundamental part.</p>
<p>The capacity to suffer is the fundamental part of being human.</p>
<p>I mean, I would look at when you&rsquo;re not conscious, you don&rsquo;t suffer.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve had operations where we&rsquo;ve been put under anesthetic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not conscious and we don&rsquo;t suffer during the operation.</p>
<p>If we were conscious, we would.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also, I mean, there&rsquo;s a nonphysical suffering that is very much tied to consciousness.</p>
<p>I can think of things right now that will cause me suffering, like pain that I&rsquo;ve caused</p>
<p>or pain that other people I care about have felt or so on.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see how I think that way.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s equally true of joy.</p>
<p>Joy is also a product of consciousness.</p>
<p>All tied in in some beautiful, messy way with memory and so on that we can reexperience</p>
<p>it when we recall the memories.</p>
<p>But why is there suffering?</p>
<p>You mentioned evil.</p>
<p>Why is there evil in the world?</p>
<p>You can tell stories about this.</p>
<p>Why is there suffering?</p>
<p>Why is there evil in the world if there&rsquo;s a God that cares for us?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume for a minute that everything was a primitive robot.</p>
<p>There would be no suffering, but there would also be no growth.</p>
<p>And that implies choices.</p>
<p>One of the things that I&rsquo;ve said that I know why it hurts people, and I don&rsquo;t mean it quite</p>
<p>the way, but I will say it nonetheless, is the Holocaust presents the exact same theological</p>
<p>question as somebody who gets shot on the streets of a city in Los Angeles, which is,</p>
<p>God, why do you allow some people to do bad things to other people?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on an unimaginable scale, but it&rsquo;s the same question.</p>
<p>And the answer has to be you either allow people to have free will or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say as God, I&rsquo;m going to let everybody have free will, but not Nazis.</p>
<p>Nazis don&rsquo;t get free will because Cambodians, they can kill each other.</p>
<p>Fondans kill each other, but the Nazis don&rsquo;t get to do that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>And what makes it unfathomable is when you&rsquo;re actually faced with suffering, these kinds</p>
<p>of explanations are obscene.</p>
<p>They just are.</p>
<p>I mean, when somebody is actually suffering, oh, the rabbi said God gave people free will,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just awful.</p>
<p>But there is a second piece to this also, which is that there is natural suffering,</p>
<p>like children born with diseases or earthquakes or volcanoes or whatever.</p>
<p>And here my argument is that in some ways, suffering has to be random in the world because</p>
<p>when people say, why do bad things happen to good people, well, if only good things</p>
<p>happen to good people, everybody would be good, but it would have no moral content.</p>
<p>The only way you can be good and it have moral content is say, I know that I can live a really</p>
<p>good life and have really terrible things happen to me nonetheless.</p>
<p>So it feels to me like it has to be a randomly.</p>
<p>Now that means, by the way, that I&rsquo;ve been incredibly lucky.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a good life because I was good.</p>
<p>I have a good life because I was lucky.</p>
<p>And that implies not that I should feel guilty about it, but that I have a tremendous responsibility</p>
<p>as a result to other people who aren&rsquo;t so lucky.</p>
<p>Tremendous responsibility to study the lessons of history, to tell the stories of those who</p>
<p>are less lucky and to draw enough wisdom from them so that we have less cruelty and suffering</p>
<p>in the world or have new kinds that get us to improve even more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That we suffer better.</p>
<p>For a lot of people, mortality is one of the very unfortunate versions of suffering, which</p>
<p>is that the ride ends in this realm, whatever it is.</p>
<p>What do you think of mortality?</p>
<p>Is it something you think about?</p>
<p>Is it something you fear?</p>
<p>What do you think happens after we die?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fear it.</p>
<p>First of all, I would say when I was in high school, I think my father actually encouraged</p>
<p>me to read this book.</p>
<p>I read Ernest Becker&rsquo;s Denial of Death, which I found and still find to be one of the most</p>
<p>profound works I&rsquo;ve ever come across.</p>
<p>And he convinced me that a lot of what our society is about are ways that we avoid encountering</p>
<p>our own mortality.</p>
<p>Our physicality ‚Äì I mean, among the points he makes ‚Äì and I&rsquo;m not quoting him at</p>
<p>all directly ‚Äì it&rsquo;s like, why does everything about our physical body make us so uncomfortable?</p>
<p>Everything that comes out of you, other than tears, is either mildly or very disgusting.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why does that have to be?</p>
<p>Why are sex and eating and all the things that are physical surrounded with so much</p>
<p>symbolism?</p>
<p>I mean, what are table manners, really?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re not eating like animals because we&rsquo;re not eating like animals.</p>
<p>And sex, obviously, has more symbolism around it than anything.</p>
<p>And his answer is, anything that reminds you that you&rsquo;re a physical body because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what dies.</p>
<p>Your body dies.</p>
<p>It decays.</p>
<p>It dies.</p>
<p>It gets eaten by worms.</p>
<p>That you don&rsquo;t want to think about, so you deny it.</p>
<p>I think that part of religion is a confrontation with your own mortality, but also a certain</p>
<p>transcendence of it because the idea is something about you is eternal.</p>
<p>What exactly I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And you asked, what do I think happens after we die?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know any better than anyone else does, but I&rsquo;ll say two things about it.</p>
<p>One is that every image of what it&rsquo;s like is foolish.</p>
<p>Mark Twain has, I think, in Letters from Earth, he says, we&rsquo;re going to lie on green fields</p>
<p>and listen to harp music, which you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do for five minutes while you&rsquo;re alive,</p>
<p>but you think you&rsquo;ll be happy for the rest of eternity doing it after you die.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This world was a surprise.</p>
<p>So why shouldn&rsquo;t the next world be a surprise?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>But I really like this parable that&rsquo;s told by a guy in a book on death and mourning by</p>
<p>a rabbi in a book on death and mourning about twins in a womb.</p>
<p>He says, one of them believes that there&rsquo;s a life outside and the other one doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He says, the one who doesn&rsquo;t says, look, this is the only world we&rsquo;ve ever seen, the only</p>
<p>world we&rsquo;ve ever known.</p>
<p>Why do you think there&rsquo;s something out there?</p>
<p>He says, now imagine the one who believes is born.</p>
<p>Back in the womb, his brother is mourning a death, but outside, everybody&rsquo;s celebrating</p>
<p>a birth.</p>
<p>He said, and that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like when you die.</p>
<p>And I love that image.</p>
<p>Yeah, the grass is always greener.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the new step, but the eternity thing is an interesting one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yet another concept that I feel humans are fully inequipped to comprehend.</p>
<p>Is eternity fundamental somehow to all of these discussions?</p>
<p>I think it is, well, partly because God is supposed to be eternal and therefore it moves</p>
<p>the mind in that direction, even though it is completely unfathomable, you know?</p>
<p>Because sometimes I would say eternity, you said on a green field, sometimes a moment,</p>
<p>like a truly joyful moment, feels like an eternity, the intensity of it.</p>
<p>Maybe eternity is more about stopping time versus extending time indefinitely, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that we just totally can&rsquo;t comprehend, us silly humans.</p>
<p>All I would say is the older you get, the more you&rsquo;re struck by the fact that time does</p>
<p>not freeze.</p>
<p>People will sometimes say to me, you haven&rsquo;t aged a day.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll look at an old picture of myself and I&rsquo;ll say, that was very kind of you, but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, I love the idea of seeing eternity in a grain of sand, was how Blake</p>
<p>put it.</p>
<p>I love that notion.</p>
<p>But when you talk about life after death, I think that in some ways, my fundamental</p>
<p>faith is in human beings, that this doesn&rsquo;t all disappear, that there&rsquo;s something about</p>
<p>people that transcends this world.</p>
<p>You mentioned Ernest Becker in high school and denial of death.</p>
<p>Maybe you can mention if you still see truth and wisdom in some of this idea.</p>
<p>But in general, can you go all the way back and tell some of the fascinating story of</p>
<p>how you found faith?</p>
<p>When I was in high school, I was a really pretty ardent atheist.</p>
<p>And I loved Bertrand Russell, who was, for my money, with all due respect to all the</p>
<p>very, very capable people that we&rsquo;ve talked about earlier, he&rsquo;s the best atheist pound</p>
<p>for pound that there was, and a remarkably witty and lucid writer.</p>
<p>And I was totally in his thrall.</p>
<p>And I would read every book by Russell I could get my hands on.</p>
<p>And the reason that I did, I have this theory that why do adolescent boys like Mr. Spock</p>
<p>and like Sherlock Holmes?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because when you hit puberty, for a lot of us, there&rsquo;s so much discomfort</p>
<p>with our bodies that we like the idea that we&rsquo;re just brains.</p>
<p>I really think so.</p>
<p>I had that experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I want to just be a thinking machine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be a body because my body was making me so uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I had all these urges and inclinations that I couldn&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>So Russell was perfect.</p>
<p>And my father, who was a rabbi, did the very wise thing of buying me some of Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s</p>
<p>books, which was his way of saying, I&rsquo;m not afraid of him.</p>
<p>And actually, there was another rabbi.</p>
<p>I was at summer camp, and I was sitting on the porch of the, I remember exactly, and</p>
<p>I was reading Bertrand Russell, and this guy came up to me and said, what are you reading?</p>
<p>I was maybe 16 or 17, and I said, Bertrand Russell, I was spoiling for a fight.</p>
<p>And he said, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re reading him.</p>
<p>I said, really?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>He goes, how old are you, David?</p>
<p>And I said, whatever I was, 16, 17.</p>
<p>He said, well, I&rsquo;d rather you grow out of him than grow into him.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>He was actually right because when I started to read about Russell&rsquo;s life, I realized</p>
<p>that all of that rationality didn&rsquo;t shield him.</p>
<p>He had an incredibly messy life, multiple marriages, endless infidelities, family members</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t speak to who didn&rsquo;t speak to him, by the way, was raised by his grandparents</p>
<p>because his parents had died, and really not a happy or, I mean, a remarkable life, but</p>
<p>not a happy one.</p>
<p>And so I started to believe that maybe it was possible that people who had faith were</p>
<p>not just stupid and needed crutches, but saw something deeper than Russell did.</p>
<p>And the more people that I met that were like that, it&rsquo;s funny because I always thought,</p>
<p>okay, my father is a rabbi, that&rsquo;s great, but nobody else.</p>
<p>And I think what happened to me was it was not a logical decision to come to faith.</p>
<p>It was a sort of opening of my heart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this world is way much more than my mind can capture, and I&rsquo;ve kind of felt</p>
<p>my way to God.</p>
<p>And in the moments, my faith, you know, there was a rabbi named Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav,</p>
<p>he said he was a moon man, his faith waxed and waned.</p>
<p>So sometimes I have more, sometimes less.</p>
<p>But in my feelinger moments is when I have more.</p>
<p>So with your heart open, what would you say in your feelinger moments is the most beautiful</p>
<p>part about Judaism and your faith?</p>
<p>I think the most beautiful part about Judaism is that even though it is filled with humor</p>
<p>and wit, it takes life and it takes the soul seriously.</p>
<p>Everybody really believes that this matters, and that we matter, and what we do matters.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s incredibly important, and especially in a world in which young people</p>
<p>feel so much like they don&rsquo;t matter, that&rsquo;s an unbelievably powerful message.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I want to say like almost to every young woman under 30 on TikTok, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t matter because you&rsquo;re beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not why you matter.</p>
<p>I hope you know that.</p>
<p>You matter because you have a soul.</p>
<p>And to every young man who&rsquo;s like nihilistic and doesn&rsquo;t think and just thinks that if</p>
<p>they make enough money, their life will be fine, I want to say the same thing, which</p>
<p>is really that&rsquo;s not ultimately you matter because you&rsquo;re in the image of God.</p>
<p>And Judaism really deeply, deeply believes and preaches that.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a message that has so much to say to the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have to take people&rsquo;s souls seriously.</p>
<p>And for all of the difficulty in figuring out all these social questions and what they</p>
<p>mean, I just don&rsquo;t want to dismiss people because I disagree with them politically or</p>
<p>socially or culturally, because I think they matter.</p>
<p>So ultimately Judaism has a wealth of meaning for a human mind.</p>
<p>I really believe that it does.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>And its meaning, and I want to emphasize this, is not political.</p>
<p>The deepest meaning of Judaism is not political.</p>
<p>Well there is, we put politics on top of everything.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why I want to emphasize it.</p>
<p>The deepest meaning is on a soul level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not on a voting level.</p>
<p>Well that combined with the humor, it&rsquo;s clear to me that Christopher Hitchens should have</p>
<p>been a Jew.</p>
<p>He was.</p>
<p>He actually was.</p>
<p>He discovered that in his 30s, that his mother was Jewish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>He actually, he has a beautiful essay about it, discovering in his 30s that his mother</p>
<p>was Jewish, yep.</p>
<p>So remarkably enough, he actually was Jewish.</p>
<p>His autobiography, Hitch 22, is a great read.</p>
<p>And I just want to say, what you discover there, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m giving too much</p>
<p>away by telling the story of his life.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert.</p>
<p>What you discover there is that his mother ran away with a minister or a priest and they</p>
<p>died in what seemed like was a suicide pact.</p>
<p>And so I read it, unfortunately, after he passed away, but I would have wanted to ask</p>
<p>him, do you think that has anything to do maybe with the hostility towards religion?</p>
<p>We are only human.</p>
<p>My father, I mean, both my parents, but my father, who was a rabbi, was such a wonderful,</p>
<p>warm, and loving man.</p>
<p>So I associate a religious figure with real goodness.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry to return to a darker topic, but I really wanted to ask you this.</p>
<p>For the current events, for a recent event, I mentioned Dallas.</p>
<p>What lessons do you draw from the Dallas Synagogue hostage incident?</p>
<p>Well, the week after that, we had active shooter training in my synagogues.</p>
<p>And one of the things I drew was that security for synagogues is important.</p>
<p>And the second is that the reality of antisemitism, which I had thought had waned when I first</p>
<p>began my rabbinate, I thought it&rsquo;s not going to be such a big issue, it is like an evergreen</p>
<p>issue.</p>
<p>And Jews and all people of goodwill have to take this really seriously, because it has</p>
<p>devastating consequences.</p>
<p>And if the world doesn&rsquo;t know that, then it just hasn&rsquo;t been paying attention.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s antisemitism at a scale of human to human, but there&rsquo;s also, like you mentioned,</p>
<p>politics get mixed up into things, nations get mixed into things, impossible to answer.</p>
<p>But I have to ask, what do you think about the long running saga of Israel and Palestine?</p>
<p>Will we ever see peace in that part of the Middle East?</p>
<p>Well, since I&rsquo;m an optimist about human, look, I mean, I have many, many thoughts about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very, very strong supporter of Israel.</p>
<p>And I also feel really for the plight of the Palestinians.</p>
<p>I think that this is a clash of legitimate narratives that is impossible to exactly split</p>
<p>the difference of.</p>
<p>However, I know that Israel has made peace with Egypt, has made peace with Jordan, has</p>
<p>made peace now with other Arab nations.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that Israel is unwilling to make peace.</p>
<p>And so I think that as difficult as it will be for the Palestinians to come to grips with</p>
<p>the fact that the Jewish state is not leaving and is legitimately here, as opposed to we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get rid of it now, but we will get rid of it one day.</p>
<p>If that comes to be, and I believe that it will, I think not only that there would be</p>
<p>peace, but I think that those two peoples together could probably do remarkable things</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>Do you think the source of it is politics?</p>
<p>Is it religious ideas?</p>
<p>And to flip it, what is the way out?</p>
<p>Is it geopolitics?</p>
<p>Is it interfaith discourse and collaboration, or is it simply the human love?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure that I could give one answer to that, but I will give a piece of an answer.</p>
<p>Why did the Abraham Accords happen?</p>
<p>The main reason that they happened was because economics overrode ideology.</p>
<p>And I actually am hopeful that that&rsquo;s in the end what will happen, that people will</p>
<p>say, you know what?</p>
<p>If we have such a better life, if we put aside the ideological animosities and just created</p>
<p>this different kind of Middle East together.</p>
<p>I went to Dubai to watch the World Chess Championship, because I really wanted to see Magnus Carlsen</p>
<p>play.</p>
<p>I thought, you&rsquo;re alive when you have such a remarkable world champion.</p>
<p>Go see him play.</p>
<p>So I actually took myself to Dubai for the last couple of games, and I watched.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m uninterested in Dubai, but I went there for the chess thing.</p>
<p>The Expo was also on at the same time, and I saw, here&rsquo;s this amazing place.</p>
<p>I came back.</p>
<p>This guy I know who lived in Dubai for several years and works in the Middle East said to</p>
<p>me, what did you think of it?</p>
<p>And I said, it was nice, it was Dubai.</p>
<p>It was very polished, very sophisticated, very clean, no crime and so on.</p>
<p>But it was kind of like Las Vegas in the Middle East without the gambling or something like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And he totally changed my perspective in a couple sentences.</p>
<p>He said, I know it seems like that when you come from Los Angeles.</p>
<p>He said, but fly there from Yemen or from Riyadh, and it is a miracle.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh my God, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what human beings can do if they just put aside their ideological shackles</p>
<p>is remarkable, and I&rsquo;m hopeful that one day that&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
<p>Economics allows for higher quality of life.</p>
<p>You no longer, it&rsquo;s the playground analogy you said earlier.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s more resources to play with, unfortunately, us humans are more willing to play with others.</p>
<p>And maybe that is the solution.</p>
<p>And maybe, I mean, for me, from a technology perspective, innovation, engineering helps</p>
<p>make everybody&rsquo;s life better.</p>
<p>And over that, once people&rsquo;s lives become better, they start to have more time to be</p>
<p>empathetic and hear people out.</p>
<p>And they have more to lose.</p>
<p>When you have more to lose, it actually makes you, I think, countries are less willing to</p>
<p>go to war when they have more to lose.</p>
<p>And families want peace when it&rsquo;s good at home.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s an element of that as well.</p>
<p>And some of it, again, taking us back to the other aspect of our conversation is how we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>conducting ourselves in conversation online and so on.</p>
<p>Because I think, actually, I&rsquo;m a big fan of the idea of social media that is a way for</p>
<p>us to connect together.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of really strong ideas how to do that well.</p>
<p>And clearly, the initial attempts that kind of just open it up wide, some of the lesser</p>
<p>aspects of human nature can take over when combined with different forces like advertisements</p>
<p>and virology and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But overall, I love the honesty of the mess of it being presented before us on social</p>
<p>media.</p>
<p>Part of me, maybe because I don&rsquo;t participate it, like if somebody is being mean to me or</p>
<p>being aggressive and these kinds of things, I enjoy it because it&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
<p>But I enjoy it because I don&rsquo;t respond.</p>
<p>I think if I responded, I would get pulled into this human nature and then it&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>But I love the, like I&rsquo;ll talk to people.</p>
<p>In fact, I still visit Clubhouse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know what that is.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Actually, when I&hellip;</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how we first met.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I was such a fan boy.</p>
<p>Actually, when I first heard you, I was like, I can&rsquo;t believe I get to talk to David.</p>
<p>But the Israel Palestine topic was something that was very deeply in a heated way discussed</p>
<p>on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>Race relations is the thing that was really heatedly discussed.</p>
<p>And I now go to Clubhouse to practice Russian.</p>
<p>And there in Russian, the heated discussion is on basically any topic as meaningless or</p>
<p>meaningful as you want in the heat of it.</p>
<p>Just people just screaming and then calming down and going through the full process.</p>
<p>That too is beautiful because that emotion is there.</p>
<p>And if it is allowed to have a voice, I think ultimately it leads to healing.</p>
<p>So that felt really healthy if you learn how to do that at scale.</p>
<p>Social media, I wish that it were not as algorithmically biased towards conflict.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s healthy.</p>
<p>But I think it brings a lot of blessings into people&rsquo;s lives if they use it wisely.</p>
<p>Like anything else, it can be awful.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve connected to all sorts of people that I never would have known.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been wonderful.</p>
<p>So let me ask you the big question of advice.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people today that are maybe high school, college,</p>
<p>thinking about career, thinking about life, they can be proud of.</p>
<p>So the first thing that I would say is that life is longer than you think it is.</p>
<p>Even though I understand the impulse to be in a rush, you will have many unfoldings.</p>
<p>More even than people of my generation did.</p>
<p>Unfoldings, that&rsquo;s such a funny word.</p>
<p>But it feels that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like different aspects of your life will come, will show you different possibilities</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t imagine at the moment.</p>
<p>And I think the second thing that I would say is, I know that this is a very old fashioned,</p>
<p>but I would say to the extent that you can read, don&rsquo;t just, and not just on social media,</p>
<p>read books.</p>
<p>Learn things that will give you a broader context for your life than just today or yesterday</p>
<p>or the day before.</p>
<p>And I suppose the other thing that I would say is that to the extent that you can try</p>
<p>to develop your own internal metric of both what matters and what is good, because you</p>
<p>will be exposed to more voices than any generation in history telling you that that&rsquo;s good or</p>
<p>this is good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called influences, influencers, but what they are is voices telling you what you</p>
<p>should think and what you should believe.</p>
<p>And so have some internal space where you&rsquo;ll be able to say, for example, I know this person</p>
<p>is doing that and it looks great, but that&rsquo;s not me.</p>
<p>You have a community of people that speak to you with a lot of passion.</p>
<p>Do you still have that voice in your own, in the privacy of your own mind that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to ignore, like for a moment, just be with yourself, think what is right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s partly because I grew up without that.</p>
<p>I mean, I grew up with a lot of space in my life, and so I had a chance to develop that</p>
<p>voice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s harder for kids today than it was for me.</p>
<p>I mean, I grew up when there were three channels, there was three, six and 10.</p>
<p>There was ABC, CBS and NBC, and that was it.</p>
<p>And you spent your evening playing board games or reading or whatever, and there was a lot</p>
<p>of space.</p>
<p>And we played football on the street and you went on your bike in the morning and nobody</p>
<p>worried about you and you came home at night and everybody assumed you were fine.</p>
<p>And so I really feel, and also I went into a religious tradition where I feel like I</p>
<p>have the opportunity to judge myself by bigger metrics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still hard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to, it&rsquo;s not like, oh, I wear impenetrable armor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still hard.</p>
<p>So how much harder for kids today when they don&rsquo;t have that?</p>
<p>You mentioned books.</p>
<p>Is there Bertrand Russell and Denial of Death by Ernest Becker, is there books that pop</p>
<p>into mind that had an impact on you?</p>
<p>My favorite novel is Middlemarch.</p>
<p>Middlemarch?</p>
<p>Middlemarch.</p>
<p>I was listening to a podcast, I was listening to one of your podcasts where your guest said</p>
<p>the two greatest novels of the 19th century were Brothers Karamazov and, what was the</p>
<p>other one he mentioned?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Dostoevsky as well or no?</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Was it both Dostoevsky?</p>
<p>It might have been.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>But anyway, but I would say Middlemarch is up there.</p>
<p>Middlemarch presents an entire world and it&rsquo;s written by a woman, Marianne Evans, who took</p>
<p>the pen name George Eliot, who you feel, Virginia Woolf said it&rsquo;s the only English novel written</p>
<p>for grownups.</p>
<p>You feel the genius in her sentences, like the pressure of her intellect in her sentences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful, wonderful book.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Pressure of her intellect.</p>
<p>Yeah, you really do.</p>
<p>I also love Saul Bellow, especially Herzog, but it&rsquo;s a very different kind of thinking</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s novel.</p>
<p>I read a lot of mysteries and a lot of other kinds of fiction and literature.</p>
<p>But in terms of the books that most, you mentioned one of them, which is Viktor Frankl&rsquo;s Man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Search for Meaning.</p>
<p>And I also really, really love Heschel&rsquo;s The Sabbath.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very short book, just as Frankl&rsquo;s book is.</p>
<p>What do you take from The Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning?</p>
<p>What do you take of a human being in the worst conditions, being able to non dramatically</p>
<p>find little joys, find beauty?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I said before about Judaism&rsquo;s advice to younger people, is that it mattered.</p>
<p>If you believe that something matters, you have enormous resilience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s meaninglessness that is the greatest threat to a decent life.</p>
<p>When people are deeply depressed, whether it is chemical depression or what they feel</p>
<p>like is this is all meaningless.</p>
<p>And meaning, now obviously chemical depression calls in part for chemical means, but meaning</p>
<p>is the great antidote.</p>
<p>We can talk about what kind of meaning.</p>
<p>There are kinds of meanings that are awful, but meaning is the great antidote to a sense</p>
<p>that life is just nihilistic and purposeless and to that destructiveness that I think is</p>
<p>too common.</p>
<p>Yeah, so maybe the heroic action in Nazi Germany, in the Holocaust, in the camps is the, even</p>
<p>not the action, but just the realization that every life matters.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s this really wonderful story that Hugo Grin, who was a rabbi in England, died,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like 15, 20 years ago, he used to tell, he grew up in Auschwitz.</p>
<p>He was a child there and he was with his father and it was Hanukkah and you&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>light the candles.</p>
<p>And his father took the margarine ration and used it as the oil to light the Hanukkah candles.</p>
<p>And Hugo was scandalized and he said, that&rsquo;s our food.</p>
<p>And his father said, what we have learned, my son, is you can live for three weeks without</p>
<p>food.</p>
<p>You can live for three days without water, but you can&rsquo;t live for three minutes without</p>
<p>hope.</p>
<p>Well, hope, let me ask you, you said meaning.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the perfect person to ask this question, Rabbi David Wolff.</p>
<p>I believe the meaning of life is for human beings to grow in soul.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>And you can do that in infinite numbers of ways.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re supposed to return your soul like more burnished and beautiful, then you</p>
<p>got it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s going to have some nicks and cuts, but that&rsquo;s what it means to deepen and</p>
<p>grow it.</p>
<p>And you do that more than anything else.</p>
<p>You do that by learning how to love.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the principle way, I think, that you do it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting because for a human, the relationship, if you&rsquo;re a man of faith,</p>
<p>is with God.</p>
<p>But it feels like love is so richly part of human society that it&rsquo;s not just love of God,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s love of each other.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about the idea.</p>
<p>I mean, in Judaism, that was actually the great innovation of the monotheistic idea.</p>
<p>In pagan societies, it was all about how you treated the gods.</p>
<p>Monotheism said, no, God cares how you treat each other.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, in fact, the mystics use the same kind of word in Hebrew, davekut, which means</p>
<p>clinging, that is used about Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>It says, therefore, a man will leave his father and mother and davak with his wife.</p>
<p>And davak means cling.</p>
<p>So there is an analogy there, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, I kind of think of human civilization as that movie, March of the Penguins, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all huddling together in the cold.</p>
<p>This is fundamentally human, this darkness all around us of uncertainty, of cruelty.</p>
<p>It seems like everything is so fragile, and we&rsquo;re just kind of all huddling together for</p>
<p>warmth.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all we got is each other.</p>
<p>So we started with the big question of what is God, ended with what is meaning.</p>
<p>Rabbi Wolpe, I&rsquo;ve been a huge, as I&rsquo;ve told you, huge, huge fan of yours for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an honor that you talked to me today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I am really so happy to be here, and thank you so much for the conversation.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Wolpe.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from David himself.</p>
<p>The only whole heart is a broken one, because it lets the light in.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
