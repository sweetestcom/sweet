    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to discuss the science and practice</p>
<p>of flexibility and stretching.</p>
<p>Flexibility and stretching are topics that I believe</p>
<p>do not receive nearly as much attention as they deserve.</p>
<p>For most people, the topics of flexibility and stretching</p>
<p>bring to mind things like yoga, injury prevention,</p>
<p>or maybe even contortionism.</p>
<p>But it turns out that flexibility and stretching</p>
<p>are features that are built into our basic body plan.</p>
<p>Young children, young animals, and adults,</p>
<p>and indeed older children and animals,</p>
<p>all stretch and all have some degree of flexibility.</p>
<p>It turns out that having flexibility</p>
<p>and our ability to stretch,</p>
<p>and the interaction between stretching and flexibility,</p>
<p>are fundamental to how we move,</p>
<p>our ability to learn new movements,</p>
<p>indeed also to prevent injury or repair injuries,</p>
<p>and to offsetting and reducing inflammation</p>
<p>throughout the body.</p>
<p>In fact, today, I&rsquo;m going to share with you</p>
<p>a remarkable set of studies that show</p>
<p>that stretching can actually adjust things</p>
<p>like tumor growth.</p>
<p>This is work that was done by one of the major directors</p>
<p>of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s discussion will start with a description</p>
<p>of the mechanisms, literally the cells</p>
<p>and the connections from your nervous system</p>
<p>that mediate flexibility and stretching.</p>
<p>And I promise that I&rsquo;ll make that information</p>
<p>accessible to you,</p>
<p>whether or not you have a biology background or not.</p>
<p>Then with that information in hand,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to present to you</p>
<p>what the scientific literature says</p>
<p>about the best times and ways to stretch.</p>
<p>Everything right down to the detail</p>
<p>of how long to hold a stretch,</p>
<p>whether or not to hold a stretch at all,</p>
<p>because it turns out there are multiple kinds of stretching.</p>
<p>So you can imagine you have stretches</p>
<p>where you hold the stretch for a very long time</p>
<p>and use as little momentum as possible.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>dynamic and ballistic stretching,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re literally swinging your limbs,</p>
<p>trying to increase the range of motion.</p>
<p>I will explain the science and application</p>
<p>of flexibility and stretching</p>
<p>in the context of sports performance,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re engaging in cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>or resistance exercise or both,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re a competitive athlete</p>
<p>or simply a recreational exerciser, as I am,</p>
<p>whether or not you are trying to increase</p>
<p>your range of motion and flexibility</p>
<p>for longevity purposes,</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re trying to do it</p>
<p>in order to access different parts of your nervous system,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll soon learn today</p>
<p>that your ability to improve flexibility</p>
<p>and need to engage in specific stretching exercises</p>
<p>can actually be used to powerfully modulate</p>
<p>your ability to tolerate pain,</p>
<p>both emotional and physical pain.</p>
<p>So this thing that we call flexibility and stretching</p>
<p>is actually a vast landscape.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to simplify and organize all that for you today.</p>
<p>And by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a number of simple,</p>
<p>easy to apply tools that are grounded</p>
<p>in the best scientific research</p>
<p>that you can apply for your specific goals.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3,</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise.</p>
<p>Our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single-ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about flexibility and stretching.</p>
<p>Before we talk about the practices</p>
<p>of flexibility and stretching,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just highlight some of the features</p>
<p>that are already built into your nervous system</p>
<p>and into your body that allow you to be flexible.</p>
<p>Some of us feel tighter than others,</p>
<p>sometimes in specific limbs or areas of our body.</p>
<p>Some people feel really loose and limber.</p>
<p>Some people even have what&rsquo;s called a hyperflexibility.</p>
<p>I, for instance, have a relative that can take her fingers</p>
<p>and bend them back to the point where they touch her wrist,</p>
<p>and it always makes me cringe a little bit,</p>
<p>but she can do that without any pain.</p>
<p>She seems to have some hyperflexibility in her joints.</p>
<p>I do not have that feature.</p>
<p>Some of you may find that you are more flexible</p>
<p>than others, naturally.</p>
<p>And some of you might be thinking,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to build in additional flexibility.</p>
<p>Well, I think by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll realize that almost all of us can benefit</p>
<p>from having some sort of understanding about flexibility</p>
<p>and having some stretching protocol</p>
<p>that we incorporate into our life,</p>
<p>if not just for physical performance reasons</p>
<p>and for postural reasons,</p>
<p>then also for cognitive and mental reasons.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be sure to clarify what all of that means.</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;d like to take a moment</p>
<p>and just highlight the flexibility that you already have.</p>
<p>For instance, if you were to move your arm</p>
<p>behind your torso a little bit,</p>
<p>and then sort of let go</p>
<p>or stop exerting any effort in doing that,</p>
<p>you would find that the limb would return more or less</p>
<p>to a position next to your torso.</p>
<p>At least I would hope so.</p>
<p>Now, why is that?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that there are aspects</p>
<p>of your nervous system, aspects of your skeletal system,</p>
<p>aspects of your muscles,</p>
<p>and aspects of the connective tissue</p>
<p>that binds all of that together,</p>
<p>that try and restore a particular order or position</p>
<p>to your limbs and your limbs relative to one another.</p>
<p>So that reflects a very specific set of processes</p>
<p>that it turns out are the same set of processes</p>
<p>that you use when you are trying</p>
<p>to enhance flexibility and stretching.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to just take a moment</p>
<p>and review the basic elements of nervous system,</p>
<p>muscle, connective tissue, and skeletal tissue, bone,</p>
<p>that allow for flexibility and stretching.</p>
<p>And here we can point to two major mechanisms</p>
<p>by which your nervous system, neurons, meaning nerve cells,</p>
<p>communicate with muscles,</p>
<p>and those muscles communicate back to your nervous system</p>
<p>to make sure that your limbs don&rsquo;t stretch too far,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t move too far, such that you get injured.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>mechanisms that ensure</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t overload your muscles too much</p>
<p>with weight or with tension or with effort</p>
<p>and damage them that way.</p>
<p>Because it turns out that the second security mechanism</p>
<p>of making sure that you don&rsquo;t overload muscles</p>
<p>can be leveraged toward increasing your flexibility</p>
<p>almost immediately.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There are protocols and tools that I&rsquo;ll share with you</p>
<p>that are going to allow you</p>
<p>to vastly improve your flexibility over time,</p>
<p>but there are also mechanisms that allow you</p>
<p>to quite significantly increase your degree of flexibility</p>
<p>in a very short period of time, within just a few seconds.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s establish some of the basic biological mechanisms.</p>
<p>Anytime we talk about biology or physiology,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about structure,</p>
<p>meaning the cells and their connections,</p>
<p>and functions, what they do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just a few names to understand.</p>
<p>You do not have to memorize these names.</p>
<p>The important thing that I&rsquo;d like you to know</p>
<p>is that flexibility and the process of stretching</p>
<p>and getting more flexible involves three major components.</p>
<p>Neural, meaning of the nervous system,</p>
<p>muscular, muscles, and connective tissue.</p>
<p>Connective tissue is the stuff</p>
<p>that surrounds the neural stuff and the muscular stuff,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s all kind of weaved together</p>
<p>and braided together in complicated ways.</p>
<p>Some of you may have heard of fascia.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit about fascia today,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s such an interesting tissue</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really deserving of its own episode.</p>
<p>Fascial tissue, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>some of the stuff that surrounds muscles</p>
<p>that really gives you your shape</p>
<p>and holds everything together</p>
<p>and allows for flexibility to occur.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a key thing that everyone should know,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re talking about flexibility or not,</p>
<p>your nervous system controls your muscles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what gets your muscles to contract.</p>
<p>So within your spinal cord,</p>
<p>you have a category of neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>that are called motor neurons.</p>
<p>To be precise, they are lower motor neurons</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in your spinal cord.</p>
<p>We call them lower to distinguish them</p>
<p>from the motor neurons that are in your brain</p>
<p>up in your skull.</p>
<p>Those lower motor neurons, hereafter,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just refer to them as motor neurons.</p>
<p>If I want to talk about the other kind of motor neurons,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say upper motor neurons.</p>
<p>So if I say motor neurons,</p>
<p>I just mean the ones in your spinal cord.</p>
<p>Those motor neurons send a little wire or set of wires</p>
<p>out to your muscles,</p>
<p>and that creates what&rsquo;s called a neuromuscular junction,</p>
<p>which just means that the neurons meet the muscles</p>
<p>at a particular place.</p>
<p>Those neurons release a chemical.</p>
<p>That chemical is called acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Some of you may have heard about acetylcholine before.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine also exists in your brain</p>
<p>and does other things in your brain.</p>
<p>Mainly, it&rsquo;s involved in focus and attention.</p>
<p>But at the neuromuscular junction,</p>
<p>the release of acetylcholine from these nerve cells,</p>
<p>these neurons, onto the muscles</p>
<p>causes the muscles to contract.</p>
<p>And when muscles contract,</p>
<p>they are able to move limbs</p>
<p>by way of changing the length of the muscle,</p>
<p>adjusting the function of connective tissue,</p>
<p>like tendons and ligaments,</p>
<p>and for instance,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re bringing your wrist closer to your shoulder,</p>
<p>that biceps muscle is contracting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting shorter.</p>
<p>I mean, in reality, it hasn&rsquo;t gotten shorter overall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just temporarily shorter, of course.</p>
<p>All of that is controlled by neurons,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s those motor neurons from the spinal cord</p>
<p>that are really responsible</p>
<p>for the major movement of your limbs</p>
<p>by way of causing contraction of specific muscles</p>
<p>at specific times.</p>
<p>So the key thing to take away</p>
<p>is that nerve controls the contraction of muscles.</p>
<p>Now, within the muscles themselves,</p>
<p>there are nerve connections.</p>
<p>And these are nerve connections</p>
<p>that arise from a different set of neurons</p>
<p>in the spinal cord that we call sensory neurons.</p>
<p>The sensory neurons exist</p>
<p>in a different part of the spinal cord,</p>
<p>and they send a little wire</p>
<p>or set of wires into the muscles.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a particular kind of sensory neuron</p>
<p>that comes out of your spinal cord and into your muscles,</p>
<p>which are called spindle neurons.</p>
<p>They create, or they actually wrap around muscle fibers,</p>
<p>kind of corkscrew around them,</p>
<p>and give kind of a spring-like appearance.</p>
<p>If for you aficionados out there,</p>
<p>these are intrafusal connections or neurons.</p>
<p>Intrafusal means within the muscle,</p>
<p>but you really don&rsquo;t need to know that</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re really curious about it</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to become a neuroscientist</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in medical school or something.</p>
<p>These spindle connections within the muscle</p>
<p>that wrap around the muscle fibers</p>
<p>sense the stretch of those muscle fibers.</p>
<p>So now we have two parts to the system that I&rsquo;ve described.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got motor neurons</p>
<p>that can cause muscles to contract and shorten.</p>
<p>And we have these spindles within the muscles themselves</p>
<p>that wrap around the muscle fibers.</p>
<p>And that information is sent from the muscle</p>
<p>back to the spinal cord.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of sensing what&rsquo;s going on in the muscle,</p>
<p>much in the same way that you have neurons in your eye</p>
<p>that sense light in your external environment.</p>
<p>You have neurons in your ear</p>
<p>that sense sound waves in your external environment.</p>
<p>You have neurons in your spinal cord</p>
<p>that are sensory neurons</p>
<p>that are sensing the amount of stretch in the muscles.</p>
<p>What happens is if a given muscle is stretching really far,</p>
<p>those sensory neurons, those spindles within the muscle</p>
<p>will activate and will send a electrical potential,</p>
<p>literally a bit of electricity along that wire&rsquo;s length</p>
<p>into the spinal cord.</p>
<p>And then within the spinal cord,</p>
<p>that sensory neuron communicates</p>
<p>through a series of intermediate steps,</p>
<p>but to the motor neuron</p>
<p>and make sure that that motor neuron contracts.</p>
<p>Now, why would that be useful?</p>
<p>Well, what this does is it creates a situation</p>
<p>where if a muscle is, or is stretching too much</p>
<p>because the range of motion of a limb is increased too much</p>
<p>then the muscle will contract</p>
<p>to bring that limb range of motion into a safe range again.</p>
<p>Now, what determines whether or not a range of motion</p>
<p>is quote unquote safe or not</p>
<p>is dictated by a number of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dictated by things that are happening</p>
<p>in this kind of loop of neural connections</p>
<p>in the spinal cord and muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also determined by what&rsquo;s going on in your head,</p>
<p>literally in your mind, cognitively,</p>
<p>about whether or not the movement of that limb,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s increasing range of motion is good for you,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re doing it deliberately,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s bad for you.</p>
<p>And then there are also some basic safety mechanisms</p>
<p>that are put in there</p>
<p>that really try and restrict our limb range of motion.</p>
<p>Okay, so just to clarify, this whole thing looks like a loop</p>
<p>and the essential components of the loop</p>
<p>are motor neurons, contract muscles,</p>
<p>sensory neurons,</p>
<p>of which there are a bunch of different varieties</p>
<p>of in this case, what we&rsquo;re calling the spindles</p>
<p>are sensing stretch within the muscles.</p>
<p>And if a given muscle is elongating</p>
<p>because of the increased range of motion of a limb,</p>
<p>those sensory neurons send an electrical signal</p>
<p>into the spinal cord</p>
<p>such that there is an activation of the motor neuron,</p>
<p>which by now should make perfect sense</p>
<p>as to why that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>It then shortens up the muscle.</p>
<p>It actually doesn&rsquo;t really shorten the muscle,</p>
<p>but contracts the muscle that brings the limb</p>
<p>back into a safe range of motion, okay?</p>
<p>So this process is very fast.</p>
<p>It was designed to keep your body together and safe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to make sure that you don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>take your arm and swing it behind your torso</p>
<p>and it just goes all the way back</p>
<p>to the middle of your back.</p>
<p>I mean, unless you&rsquo;re a contortionist</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve trained that kind of level of flexibility,</p>
<p>that would be terrible</p>
<p>because it could provide a lot of damage to the muscles</p>
<p>and to the connective tissue and so forth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one basic mechanism that we want to hold in mind.</p>
<p>This idea of a spindle that senses stretch</p>
<p>and can activate contraction of the muscles</p>
<p>and shorten the muscles.</p>
<p>The next mechanism I want to describe,</p>
<p>and once again, there are only two</p>
<p>that you need to hold in mind for this episode.</p>
<p>This other mechanism has a lot of the same features</p>
<p>as the one I just described,</p>
<p>but it has less to do with stretch.</p>
<p>In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t have to do with stretch</p>
<p>as much as it has to do with sensing loads.</p>
<p>So at the end of each muscles,</p>
<p>you have tendons typically,</p>
<p>and there are neurons</p>
<p>that are closely associated with those tendons</p>
<p>that are called Golgi tendon organs, right?</p>
<p>These are neurons that are sensory neurons</p>
<p>that sense how much load is on a given muscle, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re lifting up something very, very heavy,</p>
<p>these neurons are going to fire,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re going to send electrical activity</p>
<p>into the spinal cord.</p>
<p>And then those neurons have the ability to shut down,</p>
<p>not activate, but shut down motor neurons</p>
<p>and to prevent the contraction of a given muscle.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you were to walk over</p>
<p>and try and pick up a weight that is much too heavy for you,</p>
<p>meaning you could not do it without injuring yourself,</p>
<p>and you start to try and heave that weight off the ground,</p>
<p>there are a number of reasons</p>
<p>why you might not be able to lift it,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you start to get it</p>
<p>a little bit off the ground,</p>
<p>or you start to get some force generated</p>
<p>that would allow it to move,</p>
<p>but the force that you&rsquo;re generating</p>
<p>could potentially rip your muscles</p>
<p>or your tendons off of the bone, right?</p>
<p>That it could disrupt the joints</p>
<p>and it could tear ligaments.</p>
<p>Well, you have a safety mechanism in place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these Golgi tendon organs,</p>
<p>these GTOs as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>that get activated and shut down the motor neurons</p>
<p>and make it impossible for those muscles to contract.</p>
<p>Okay, so on the one hand,</p>
<p>we have a mechanism that senses stretch</p>
<p>and can figure out when stretch is excessive.</p>
<p>And when the system detects that stretch is excessive,</p>
<p>it activates the contraction of muscles.</p>
<p>And then we have a second mechanism that senses loads.</p>
<p>And when tension or loads is deemed excessive</p>
<p>by these circuits,</p>
<p>and remember these circuits don&rsquo;t have a mind,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t go, oh, this is excessive.</p>
<p>They just sense loads.</p>
<p>And when those loads exceed a certain threshold,</p>
<p>well, then those GTOs, those Golgi tendon organs</p>
<p>send signals into the spinal cord</p>
<p>that shut down your motor neurons ability</p>
<p>to contract muscles</p>
<p>so that you no longer can lift that heavy load.</p>
<p>So both of these are protective mechanisms,</p>
<p>but both of these can be leveraged in a very logical way</p>
<p>and in a very safe way</p>
<p>in order to increase your limb range of motion.</p>
<p>So there are a couple of things I want to point out</p>
<p>before going a little bit further</p>
<p>into how your nervous system controls</p>
<p>flexibility and stretching.</p>
<p>And those key points are the following.</p>
<p>There are now dozens, if not hundreds of studies</p>
<p>that show that a dedicated stretching practice</p>
<p>can improve limb range of motion.</p>
<p>Now, for many of you listening,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably saying, duh,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s important to point that out,</p>
<p>that a dedicated stretching practice</p>
<p>can increase limb range of motion.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>there are specific mechanisms that can explain that effect.</p>
<p>The second point is one of longevity.</p>
<p>And when I say longevity,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean late stage aging.</p>
<p>We all undergo a decrease in limb range of motion</p>
<p>unless we do something to offset that decrease.</p>
<p>And the current numbers vary from study to study,</p>
<p>but if you look en masse, you look at all of those studies,</p>
<p>and what you basically find is that</p>
<p>we start to experience a decrease in flexibility</p>
<p>from about age 20 until about age 49,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty dramatic.</p>
<p>And then of course it will continue after age 49,</p>
<p>but basically it&rsquo;s a 10% decrease every 10 years.</p>
<p>So we could say it&rsquo;s a 1% decrease per year,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not necessarily linear.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not necessarily that on your 21st birthday,</p>
<p>you are 1% less flexible than you were on your 20th birthday</p>
<p>and it decreases by 1% per year.</p>
<p>Some of these changes can be nonlinear.</p>
<p>So you can imagine the person who&rsquo;s doing just fine</p>
<p>in terms of flexibility between 20 and 30,</p>
<p>and then they get to 32</p>
<p>and suddenly they&rsquo;ve lost 5% of their flexibility.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there will be a ton of lifestyle factors.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a regular practitioner of yoga,</p>
<p>if you have a dedicated stretching practice,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing other things</p>
<p>to improve your muscle contractibility,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re doing resistance training,</p>
<p>it turns out can actually indirectly improve flexibility.</p>
<p>There are a number of different factors,</p>
<p>but the key point is that</p>
<p>maintaining some degree of flexibility</p>
<p>and maybe even enhancing range of motion and flexibility</p>
<p>is of immense benefit for offsetting injury</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not pushed too far.</p>
<p>There are a number of people</p>
<p>who have pushed their limb range of motion so far</p>
<p>that they experience all sorts of injuries,</p>
<p>both acute and chronic injuries.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;ll also talk about how to avoid those scenarios.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve established that there are mechanisms</p>
<p>within the spinal cord, muscles, and connective tissue.</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s the motor neurons, the spindles, the GTOs,</p>
<p>and of course the muscles themselves,</p>
<p>and connective tissue, tendons,</p>
<p>but also other forms of connective tissue</p>
<p>that establish whether or not a limb</p>
<p>is going to stay within a particular range of motion or not,</p>
<p>and whether or not a limb is going to be allowed</p>
<p>by the nervous system to pursue or handle a given load,</p>
<p>a given tension.</p>
<p>There are also mechanisms</p>
<p>that arrive to the neuromuscular system</p>
<p>from higher up in the nervous system, from the brain,</p>
<p>and those mechanisms involve a couple of different facets</p>
<p>that are really interesting,</p>
<p>and I think that we should all know about.</p>
<p>In fact, today, I&rsquo;m going to teach you about a set of neurons</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m guessing 99.9% of you have never heard of,</p>
<p>including all you neuroscientists out there,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re out there, and I know you&rsquo;re out there,</p>
<p>that seem uniquely enriched in humans</p>
<p>and probably perform essential roles</p>
<p>in our ability to regulate our physiology</p>
<p>and our emotional state.</p>
<p>So within the brain,</p>
<p>we have the ability to sense things in the external world,</p>
<p>something we called exteroception,</p>
<p>and we have the ability to sense things</p>
<p>in our internal world, within our body,</p>
<p>called interoception.</p>
<p>Interoception can be the volume of food in your gut,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>any organ pain or discomfort,</p>
<p>whether or not you feel good in your gut and in your organs,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually a kind of feeling,</p>
<p>mm, I feel great, I feel sated, I feel relaxed.</p>
<p>Those are all different forms of interoception.</p>
<p>The main brain area that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with interpreting what&rsquo;s going on in our body</p>
<p>is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting brain region.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got two major parts.</p>
<p>The front of it is mainly concerned with things like smell</p>
<p>and to some extent vision,</p>
<p>and to some extent other things</p>
<p>that are arriving from the external world</p>
<p>and combining with what&rsquo;s going on internally</p>
<p>and making sense of all that,</p>
<p>or at least routing that information</p>
<p>elsewhere in your nervous system to make decision,</p>
<p>like if you smell something good to approach it</p>
<p>or if you smell something bad to avoid it.</p>
<p>The front of the insula is really doing</p>
<p>all of that kind of stuff, along with other brain areas.</p>
<p>The posterior insula, the back of the insula, that is,</p>
<p>has a very interesting and distinct set of functions.</p>
<p>The posterior insula is mainly concerned</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s going on with your somatic experience.</p>
<p>How do you feel internally?</p>
<p>And how is the movement that you happen to be doing</p>
<p>combining with your internal state to allow you to feel,</p>
<p>as I like to say, the nervous system</p>
<p>mainly batches things into yum,</p>
<p>like, oh, this is really good for me.</p>
<p>Yuck, this is really bad for me, and I need to stop,</p>
<p>or meh, this is kind of neutral.</p>
<p>Okay, so this isn&rsquo;t about food,</p>
<p>but we could say for most stimuli, most senses,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re senses of things</p>
<p>internally or externally,</p>
<p>our nervous system is trying to make decisions</p>
<p>about what to do with that information,</p>
<p>and so it mainly batches information into yum,</p>
<p>I want to keep doing this or approach this thing,</p>
<p>or continue down some path of movement or eating</p>
<p>or staying in a temperature environment, et cetera,</p>
<p>or yuck, I need to get out of here,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want any more of this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to keep doing this,</p>
<p>this is painful or aversive or stressful, and then meh.</p>
<p>So if it doesn&rsquo;t really matter,</p>
<p>I can just kind of stay right here or not.</p>
<p>Yum, yuck, and meh.</p>
<p>Well, in your posterior insula,</p>
<p>you have a very interesting population</p>
<p>of very large neurons.</p>
<p>These are exceptionally large neurons</p>
<p>called van Economo neurons.</p>
<p>These are neurons that are, again,</p>
<p>unbeknownst to most neuroscientists,</p>
<p>and they seem uniquely enriched in humans.</p>
<p>Chimpanzees have them,</p>
<p>and some other large animals have them.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re found in whales, chimpanzees,</p>
<p>elephants, and in humans.</p>
<p>But even though we are much smaller than most whales,</p>
<p>and even though we are much smaller than most elephants,</p>
<p>I mean, remember there are baby elephants,</p>
<p>as far as I know, they haven&rsquo;t bred up</p>
<p>like mini elephants yet,</p>
<p>they seem to have a teacup version</p>
<p>of pretty much every dog breed.</p>
<p>You can look that up.</p>
<p>I certainly have mixed feelings about this notion</p>
<p>of trying to downsize everything</p>
<p>to the point where you could kind of like,</p>
<p>the pocket-sized bulldog, I think, someday will arrive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of that kind of downsizing</p>
<p>of different breeds.</p>
<p>But because there aren&rsquo;t teacup elephants</p>
<p>and teacup gorillas and teacup chimpanzees and so forth,</p>
<p>most all of those other species are larger than us.</p>
<p>They have these van Economo neurons,</p>
<p>and we have these van Economo neurons,</p>
<p>but we have in upwards of 80,000 of these things</p>
<p>in our posterior insula.</p>
<p>These other species tend to have somewhere in the range</p>
<p>of 1,000 to maybe 10,000 or so.</p>
<p>Why is that interesting?</p>
<p>Well, these van Economo neurons</p>
<p>have the unique property of integrating</p>
<p>our knowledge about our body movements,</p>
<p>our sense of pain and discomfort,</p>
<p>and can drive motivational processes</p>
<p>that allow us to lean into discomfort</p>
<p>and indeed to overcome any discomfort</p>
<p>if we decide that the discomfort that we are experiencing</p>
<p>is good for us or directed toward a specific goal.</p>
<p>This knowledge turns out to be very important</p>
<p>to keep in mind because as we migrate this conversation</p>
<p>toward the things that we can do</p>
<p>to enhance flexibility and stretching,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll soon learn that there are moments</p>
<p>within a stretching protocol</p>
<p>where you have the opportunity</p>
<p>to either override pain and discomfort,</p>
<p>to kind of relax through it or push through it, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a decision fork in the road there,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell you which fork in the road to take,</p>
<p>or to say, uh-uh, I&rsquo;m not going to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to allow these natural reflexes</p>
<p>of the spindle to kick in</p>
<p>and just essentially stop me from stretching</p>
<p>if a given limb isn&rsquo;t designed</p>
<p>or shouldn&rsquo;t be stretched that far.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like you to keep these van Economo neurons in mind.</p>
<p>I should mention they&rsquo;re named van Economo</p>
<p>because the guy Constantine van Economo</p>
<p>that discovered them at the end of the 1800s, early 1900s,</p>
<p>decided to name them after himself as many scientists do,</p>
<p>or certainly the neurologists and physicians</p>
<p>are famous for naming things after themselves.</p>
<p>These van Economo neurons turn out to be very important</p>
<p>to keep in mind as we embark on our exploration</p>
<p>of what sorts of stretching practices</p>
<p>can be best applied to increase flexibility.</p>
<p>Because whether or not you undertake a mild, moderate,</p>
<p>or intense flexibility training,</p>
<p>you will no doubt encounter a scenario at some point</p>
<p>where you will have to ask yourself,</p>
<p>do I, quote unquote, relax into this stretch,</p>
<p>or do I try and push through</p>
<p>just a little bit of discomfort?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explain how to gauge that decision</p>
<p>in a very specific and ideally safe way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you some tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to make that decision</p>
<p>in the way that best preserves the integrity</p>
<p>of those neural circuits that I described earlier</p>
<p>and can keep you safe.</p>
<p>These van Economo neurons sit in the exact position</p>
<p>that one would want to be able to evaluate</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in the body,</p>
<p>in particular, what&rsquo;s going on in terms of limb movements,</p>
<p>how that relates to our feelings of discomfort.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the other aspect</p>
<p>of these van Economo neurons,</p>
<p>which is that these van Economo neurons</p>
<p>are connected to a number of different brain areas</p>
<p>that can shift our internal state</p>
<p>from one of so-called sympathetic activation,</p>
<p>so this is a pattern of alertness and even stress,</p>
<p>sometimes even panic, but typically alertness and stress,</p>
<p>to one of so-called parasympathetic activation,</p>
<p>to one of relaxation.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, you&rsquo;ll hear that stretching should be done</p>
<p>by relaxing into the stretch.</p>
<p>Well, what does it actually mean to relax into the stretch?</p>
<p>Well, these van Economo neurons sit at this junction</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re able to evaluate</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on inside our body</p>
<p>and allow us to access neural circuitries</p>
<p>by which we can shift our relative level</p>
<p>of alertness down a bit</p>
<p>or our relative level of stress down a bit</p>
<p>and thereby to increase so-called parasympathetic activation</p>
<p>and to literally override some of those spindle mechanisms,</p>
<p>even the GTO mechanisms,</p>
<p>but especially the spindle mechanisms</p>
<p>at the neuromuscular and musculospinal junction,</p>
<p>and in that way, gently, subtly override the reflex</p>
<p>that would otherwise cause us</p>
<p>to contract those muscles back.</p>
<p>The reason that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>is because your brain has those other kinds of motor neurons,</p>
<p>the upper motor neurons that can both direct,</p>
<p>meaning control, and can override lower motor neurons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a brief example of this</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve already done in your life</p>
<p>and that we all have the capacity for.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to is the monosynaptic stretch reflex.</p>
<p>This is something that every first-year</p>
<p>neuroscience graduate student learns,</p>
<p>which is that if you were to step on a sharp object</p>
<p>with a bare foot,</p>
<p>you would not need to make the decision</p>
<p>to retract your foot.</p>
<p>You would automatically do that</p>
<p>provided you have a healthy nervous system.</p>
<p>There are mechanisms in place</p>
<p>that cause the retraction of that limb</p>
<p>by way of ensuring that the proper muscles contract</p>
<p>and other muscles do not contract,</p>
<p>in fact, that they fully relax, okay?</p>
<p>So in the case of stepping on a sharp object,</p>
<p>like a piece of glass or a nail or a tack,</p>
<p>you would essentially activate the hip flexor</p>
<p>to lift up your foot as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In doing so, that same neural circuit</p>
<p>would activate a contralateral,</p>
<p>meaning opposite side of the body circuit</p>
<p>to ensure that the leg, the foot,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not stepping on the sharp object</p>
<p>would do exactly the opposite and would extend</p>
<p>to make sure that you don&rsquo;t fall over.</p>
<p>All of that happens reflexively.</p>
<p>It does not require any thought or decision-making.</p>
<p>In fact, humans without any neocortex,</p>
<p>literally, who are decerebrate</p>
<p>or an animal that doesn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>and when I say decerebrate,</p>
<p>I mean lack of cerebral cortex,</p>
<p>they can perform that because it&rsquo;s all controlled</p>
<p>by circuits that are basically below the brain</p>
<p>and in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of activation of circuits</p>
<p>in the kind of deeper parts of the brain,</p>
<p>but basically you don&rsquo;t need to think</p>
<p>or decide in order to do that.</p>
<p>However, if your life depended</p>
<p>on walking across some sharp objects,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, let&rsquo;s make it a little less dramatic</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not like the Die Hard movie or something</p>
<p>where he has to run barefoot across the glass,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a pretty good example</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m describing here,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you had to walk across some very hot stones</p>
<p>to get away from something that you wanted to avoid.</p>
<p>You could override that stretch reflex</p>
<p>by way of a decision made with your upper motor neurons,</p>
<p>your insula, and your cognition,</p>
<p>and almost certainly those van Economo neurons,</p>
<p>which would be screaming, don&rsquo;t do this, don&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do this, could shuttle that information</p>
<p>to brain areas that would allow you to override the reflex</p>
<p>and essentially push through the pain,</p>
<p>and maybe even, in fact, even,</p>
<p>not experience the pain to the same degree or even at all.</p>
<p>So these van Economo neurons</p>
<p>sit at a very important junction within the brain.</p>
<p>They pay attention to what&rsquo;s going on in your body,</p>
<p>pain, pleasure, et cetera,</p>
<p>and that includes what&rsquo;s going on with your limbs</p>
<p>and your limb range of motion.</p>
<p>They also are paying attention</p>
<p>and can control the amount of activation,</p>
<p>kind of alertness or calmness</p>
<p>that you are able to create within your body</p>
<p>in response to a given sensory experience.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>they seem to be uniquely enriched in humans.</p>
<p>They seem to be related to the aspects of our evolution</p>
<p>that allow us to make decisions</p>
<p>about what to do with our body</p>
<p>in ways that other animals just simply can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Before we go any further,</p>
<p>I want to give you a practical tool</p>
<p>that you can, of course, use,</p>
<p>but that will also give you insight and experience</p>
<p>into your muscle spindle spinal cord circuit mechanisms.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;d like you to do</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re in a proper place to do this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to stand with legs straight,</p>
<p>meaning knees not bent,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to try and touch your toes,</p>
<p>or for some of you, that&rsquo;s going to be very easy,</p>
<p>and you might even be able to put your hands</p>
<p>flat on the floor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that kind of flexibility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy for me to touch my toes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you round your back or not,</p>
<p>although ideally I would say don&rsquo;t round your back,</p>
<p>not because it&rsquo;s bad to do so necessarily,</p>
<p>but just to try and keep this the same</p>
<p>from trial to trial, as it were.</p>
<p>So try and get a sense of what your range of motion is</p>
<p>in terms of bending over at the waist</p>
<p>while maintaining a flat back</p>
<p>and trying to touch your toes or even touch the floor.</p>
<p>Maybe, again, you can even go hands flat to the floor,</p>
<p>maybe even far out in front of you.</p>
<p>Okay, now what I&rsquo;d like you to do is stand back up,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like you to contract your quadriceps</p>
<p>as hard as you possibly can for about five to 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say 10 seconds just to keep things</p>
<p>more or less normalized.</p>
<p>This obviously is not a super controlled experiment.</p>
<p>So to contract your quadriceps,</p>
<p>for those of you that don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to extend your lower limb out.</p>
<p>So this would be like kicking,</p>
<p>although don&rsquo;t do it too quickly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to kick out your foot.</p>
<p>You should feel your quadriceps contract</p>
<p>on the top of your thighs,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to try and consciously</p>
<p>contract them as hard as you can.</p>
<p>Okay, typically, if you want to point your toe</p>
<p>back towards your near shin,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also going to help somewhat</p>
<p>to contract even harder and harder.</p>
<p>Okay, so do that for about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>A lot of you will do this just while standing.</p>
<p>Contract, contract, contract.</p>
<p>Okay, then release it.</p>
<p>And then now go ahead and repeat that stretch</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to touch your toes or touch the floor.</p>
<p>So this is again,</p>
<p>relying more or less on hamstring flexibility</p>
<p>among other things.</p>
<p>Okay, what most of you will find</p>
<p>is that you have an immediate increase</p>
<p>in hamstring flexibility</p>
<p>or your range of motion has increased.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t experience that,</p>
<p>then I would encourage you</p>
<p>to try and contract your quadriceps harder and longer.</p>
<p>So maybe 20 or 30 seconds,</p>
<p>and then try this so-called experiment again.</p>
<p>Why would contracting your quadriceps</p>
<p>allow your hamstring flexibility to suddenly increase?</p>
<p>Well, the way that our muscles are organized</p>
<p>is such that we have muscles</p>
<p>that are antagonistic to one another.</p>
<p>So our quadriceps and our hamstrings work</p>
<p>in sort of a push-pull fashion, if you will.</p>
<p>They can antagonize one another.</p>
<p>So when you move your heel towards your glutes,</p>
<p>you are using your hamstring.</p>
<p>The hamstring obviously also does other things</p>
<p>related to hip movement.</p>
<p>And when you lift your knee,</p>
<p>or when you extend your foot and contract your quadriceps,</p>
<p>you are essentially relaxing the hamstrings.</p>
<p>Now, of course, most movements involve</p>
<p>both quadricep and hamstring in synchrony,</p>
<p>and that synchrony is really an elegant one,</p>
<p>but here we&rsquo;re more or less isolating the quadriceps</p>
<p>from the hamstrings, at least to the extent</p>
<p>that it can leverage these spindle stretch mechanisms.</p>
<p>So what happens is when you contract your quadriceps hard,</p>
<p>you are relaxing or releasing some of the stretch</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s occurring in those intrafusal spindle sensory fibers</p>
<p>going into your spinal cord.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, you&rsquo;re able then</p>
<p>to stretch your hamstrings further,</p>
<p>or we can be more accurate and say</p>
<p>that your range of motion about the hamstring</p>
<p>and its related joints is greater</p>
<p>when you aren&rsquo;t engaging that spindle reflex,</p>
<p>which would cause the hamstrings to contract, okay?</p>
<p>So if you are somebody who has tight hamstrings,</p>
<p>there could be a variety of reasons for that,</p>
<p>but part of the reason is likely to be neural,</p>
<p>and you can release that neural spindle reflex</p>
<p>by contracting the opposite antagonistic muscle,</p>
<p>which in this case is the quadriceps.</p>
<p>The same thing is true and can be leveraged</p>
<p>for stretching other muscles.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re going to do a tricep stretch,</p>
<p>the typical kind of overhead where you grab your elbow</p>
<p>and move it toward the midline of your body</p>
<p>using your opposite hand, well, you can do that.</p>
<p>And then I would suggest trying to flex your bicep,</p>
<p>contract your bicep, that is, while doing that.</p>
<p>And for most people, you&rsquo;ll notice a increase</p>
<p>in the tricep range of motion or ability</p>
<p>to kind of lean into or to relax into</p>
<p>or to push that stretch a little bit further.</p>
<p>Now, for you physios out there,</p>
<p>and for those of you that have backgrounds in kinesiology,</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge, of course,</p>
<p>that there are other mechanisms that are coming into play.</p>
<p>There are actually neural connections</p>
<p>within the joints themselves</p>
<p>that are providing proprioceptive feedback,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But this is simply to illustrate</p>
<p>that part of our range of motion</p>
<p>is determined by these spindle mechanisms</p>
<p>that I spent some time focusing on earlier.</p>
<p>And indeed, this approach can be leveraged</p>
<p>toward creating increased limb range of motion,</p>
<p>not just for the hamstrings, but for your quadriceps.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you have tight quadriceps,</p>
<p>you can do the opposite.</p>
<p>You can contract your hamstring very intensely</p>
<p>for, let&rsquo;s say, 10 seconds or 20 seconds or 30 seconds.</p>
<p>So that would take some conscious effort</p>
<p>of bringing your heel up towards your glutes.</p>
<p>You could do that in a way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really trying to contract those muscles hard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to use some deliberate</p>
<p>hamstring activation there,</p>
<p>meaning you have to use those upper motor neurons</p>
<p>and the other aspects of your upper brain power, as it were,</p>
<p>to try and really contract your hamstrings</p>
<p>as intensely as possible.</p>
<p>Then you would relax that.</p>
<p>And then you would do your quadriceps stretch again.</p>
<p>And if you did a pre-hamstring contraction measurement</p>
<p>of your quadricep flexibility,</p>
<p>and then you did a post-hamstring contraction measure</p>
<p>of your quadricep flexibility,</p>
<p>almost certainly you would find</p>
<p>that that flexibility had increased.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the muscle really didn&rsquo;t change much.</p>
<p>The tendons didn&rsquo;t change much.</p>
<p>What changed was the patterns of neural activation</p>
<p>that were restricting you from, in the first case,</p>
<p>stretching your hamstring or having a,</p>
<p>to be more accurate, we should say,</p>
<p>to having a certain range of motion</p>
<p>about the hamstring and its related joints.</p>
<p>And those break mechanisms were removed.</p>
<p>And of course, then when you contract your hamstring,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re removing some of the neural breaks,</p>
<p>the spindle acting as a break</p>
<p>and inhibiting that quadricep range of motion.</p>
<p>Okay, so you can imagine this,</p>
<p>and in fact, you can apply this</p>
<p>for any number of different muscles.</p>
<p>The larger muscles and the sort of biceps, triceps,</p>
<p>and hamstrings, quadriceps are sort of the simplest place</p>
<p>to think about this and to apply it.</p>
<p>But in theory, and indeed in practice,</p>
<p>it really works for all the various muscle groups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sometimes harder to access</p>
<p>these so-called antagonistic muscle groups.</p>
<p>Now, we should take a moment and just discuss</p>
<p>what actually happens as we get more flexible</p>
<p>in the short-term and long-term.</p>
<p>I just mentioned what happens in the short-term.</p>
<p>Clearly, those don&rsquo;t involve lengthening of the muscles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the muscles slide along the bones</p>
<p>or that the tendons really stretch out that much more</p>
<p>than they had prior to that kind of exercise.</p>
<p>But it is the case that if people stretch consistently</p>
<p>over a given period of several weeks or more,</p>
<p>that there are changes in the muscles.</p>
<p>This gets a little bit tricky in terms of nomenclature,</p>
<p>and I just want to highlight that</p>
<p>because I think that a number of people get frustrated</p>
<p>and confused, in fact,</p>
<p>when we talk about muscles getting longer.</p>
<p>You know, the whole concept of a muscle getting longer</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t really in keeping with reality,</p>
<p>but there are elements within the muscles</p>
<p>that can change their conformation.</p>
<p>So to get a little bit detailed here,</p>
<p>and we won&rsquo;t spend too much time on this,</p>
<p>but I just want to acknowledge this for those of you</p>
<p>that are interested in neuromuscular physiology</p>
<p>and how it relates to flexibility.</p>
<p>You know, you have your muscle fibers</p>
<p>and then you have your so-called myofibrils.</p>
<p>So you can imagine kind of a single fiber.</p>
<p>That fiber, of course, will get input</p>
<p>from those motor neurons.</p>
<p>And then within those fibers,</p>
<p>you have what are called sarcomeres.</p>
<p>And you can kind of think about sarcomeres</p>
<p>as little segments, kind of like the segments of bamboo.</p>
<p>If you ever look at bamboo, it&rsquo;s not just one big stalk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got those little outpouchings along the way</p>
<p>that kind of break up what would be just one big stalk</p>
<p>of bamboo into different segments,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all connected.</p>
<p>The sarcomeres are somewhat like that.</p>
<p>And within the sarcomeres,</p>
<p>you have a couple of different components.</p>
<p>One thing is called myosin, which is like a thick layer.</p>
<p>And then the other is actin.</p>
<p>And those are interdigitated, as we say.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of connected to one another,</p>
<p>kind of like if you were to put your fingers together</p>
<p>from your two hands,</p>
<p>if you were going to put your fingers</p>
<p>in between one another, that&rsquo;s interdigitated,</p>
<p>literally interdigitated in this case.</p>
<p>So pun intended.</p>
<p>And that myosin and actin kind of move relative</p>
<p>to one another, and they have a lot to do</p>
<p>with your ability to contract muscles.</p>
<p>When we stretch muscles,</p>
<p>when we go through a stretching practice,</p>
<p>there are a number of things that change,</p>
<p>some neural, some related directly to connective tissue,</p>
<p>but also it appears from really nice work,</p>
<p>mainly done from McGill University.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to a couple of these studies</p>
<p>if you want to dig in there more deeply,</p>
<p>that change the conformation,</p>
<p>the relative size and spacing of some of these things</p>
<p>like sarcomeres and the way that myosin and actin</p>
<p>kind of work together.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t want to think of muscles as lengthening.</p>
<p>We can, however, think about the resting state</p>
<p>of a muscle being slightly different</p>
<p>or indeed very different than the resting state</p>
<p>of a muscle of somebody or of a limb</p>
<p>that has not undergone regular flexibility training.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s as much time as I want to spend on that</p>
<p>because we could spend an entire hour</p>
<p>getting right down into the details.</p>
<p>But I do want to emphasize, however,</p>
<p>that muscles have different parts.</p>
<p>They have fibers, they have sarcomeres,</p>
<p>they have myosin, they have actin.</p>
<p>But the idea of making our muscles longer,</p>
<p>that reflects a number of processes</p>
<p>that occur basically within an existing muscle length.</p>
<p>The length of our muscle bellies</p>
<p>and where our insertions are</p>
<p>relative to our connective tissue and our limbs</p>
<p>is genetically determined, right?</p>
<p>Some people have, for instance,</p>
<p>a bicep that goes all the way from the crook of their elbow</p>
<p>up to their shoulder, right?</p>
<p>And some people can,</p>
<p>if they were to put their arm in a 90 degree angle,</p>
<p>could put two or three fingers</p>
<p>between their bicep and their elbow.</p>
<p>They have a, we can say a shorter bicep, relatively shorter.</p>
<p>Now, the reason I mentioned</p>
<p>these highly detailed cellular mechanisms</p>
<p>is because as we start to embark on different protocols</p>
<p>for using stretching to increase flexibility</p>
<p>and range of motion,</p>
<p>we need to ask ourselves what is preventing</p>
<p>our ability to extend range of motion?</p>
<p>Is it the spindle, right?</p>
<p>Is it because the muscle is stretching too much?</p>
<p>Oftentimes it can be because of that</p>
<p>and or because of a sense of pain</p>
<p>or simply a sense that the muscle</p>
<p>is not in a position that it&rsquo;s been in before</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unrelated to pain or to spindle activation.</p>
<p>And oftentimes it can be related directly</p>
<p>to these changes in the confirmation of myosin and actin</p>
<p>and within the context of the sarcomeres.</p>
<p>Now, of course you can&rsquo;t peer into</p>
<p>or sense your individual sarcomeres.</p>
<p>However, you do have neurons that innervate these areas</p>
<p>and that send that sensory information</p>
<p>back into the spinal cord and up to your brain to interpret.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll find that as we move along,</p>
<p>there are specific adjustments that you can make</p>
<p>at both the macro level,</p>
<p>meaning how much movement to insert into your stretching,</p>
<p>is it going to be a static or a dynamic</p>
<p>or even a ballistic stretch?</p>
<p>Or for instance, at the micro level,</p>
<p>that even just a slight submillimeter or millimeter increase</p>
<p>in the stretching of a given muscle and related tissues</p>
<p>can translate into an increased range of motion performance.</p>
<p>As a quick but relevant aside,</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d share with you something useful</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also grounded in this notion of antagonistic muscles.</p>
<p>So for those of you that do resistance training,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s with body weight</p>
<p>or with physical weights or machines, what have you,</p>
<p>you may have found that if you,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say were to do three sets of a pushing exercise,</p>
<p>so this could be pushups, this could be bench presses,</p>
<p>this could be shoulder presses, something of that sort.</p>
<p>And then later in the workout, you were to do,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say machine pull-downs or pull-ups or chin-ups</p>
<p>of some sort, so a pulling exercise.</p>
<p>Typically what you would find is if you were to do</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s often called straight sets,</p>
<p>so you would do three sets of pushups,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say with two minutes of rest in between,</p>
<p>that you might be able to get a certain number</p>
<p>of repetitions on the first set.</p>
<p>Just for sake of example,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you can get 10 repetitions on the first set</p>
<p>and then you get eight repetitions on the second set</p>
<p>and then you get six repetitions on the third set</p>
<p>with two minutes in between.</p>
<p>And then you would move on at some point</p>
<p>to your pulling exercises.</p>
<p>And similarly, let&rsquo;s say you were doing chin-ups</p>
<p>or pull-downs and you would get 10 repetitions,</p>
<p>rest two minutes, eight repetitions,</p>
<p>rest two minutes and six repetitions.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>Well, typically what people discover</p>
<p>is that if they interleave</p>
<p>their pushing and pulling exercises,</p>
<p>provided they do that for muscles</p>
<p>that are antagonistic to one another.</p>
<p>So in this case, pushing with the chest, shoulders</p>
<p>and triceps for the pushing exercises</p>
<p>and pulling with the back and biceps.</p>
<p>And of course there are other muscles involved as well.</p>
<p>But because those muscle groups</p>
<p>are at least in part antagonistic to one another,</p>
<p>what people often find is that if they were to say,</p>
<p>do their pushing set, get 10 repetitions,</p>
<p>then move to a pulling set after just say 60 seconds</p>
<p>and perform that pulling set,</p>
<p>then go back to the pushing set,</p>
<p>then go back to a pulling set, push, pull, push, pull.</p>
<p>In other words, interleaving their sets,</p>
<p>even if they were to maintain</p>
<p>the same amount of rest between sets of pushing</p>
<p>and sets of pulling,</p>
<p>what they discover often is that</p>
<p>the drop in the number of repetitions that they get</p>
<p>is somewhat offset.</p>
<p>So rather than get 10, eight, six,</p>
<p>as it were with the straight sets,</p>
<p>it will be 10, nine, eight.</p>
<p>So what this means is not that you&rsquo;re increasing</p>
<p>the total rest time to four minutes between sets,</p>
<p>because then of course it wouldn&rsquo;t be equivalent,</p>
<p>but rather that while maintaining the same amount of rest</p>
<p>between sets for this same muscle group,</p>
<p>by going from push, pull, push, pull</p>
<p>of antagonistic muscles,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to have improved performance.</p>
<p>And the reason for that has everything to do</p>
<p>with what we were describing before,</p>
<p>which is that typically if you were to do push, set, rest,</p>
<p>push, set, rest, push, set, rest,</p>
<p>well, in between those sets,</p>
<p>and in fact, actually during those sets of pushing,</p>
<p>the pulling muscles that would be involved</p>
<p>in the chin-ups or pull-downs, et cetera,</p>
<p>are actually relaxing,</p>
<p>or at least are being released of some tension,</p>
<p>including the activation of the spindles,</p>
<p>among other things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a long-winded way of saying</p>
<p>that interleaving push and pull of antagonistic sets</p>
<p>can leverage some of the same neural circuits</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about leveraging</p>
<p>for sake of increasing flexibility.</p>
<p>Now, I offer this to you as a tool that you can try.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with using this tool, however,</p>
<p>is that you often have to occupy multiple sites</p>
<p>within the gym.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re doing this at home</p>
<p>and you have your own gym, that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing this in a gym</p>
<p>where you have multiple pieces of equipment,</p>
<p>well, then you become that person</p>
<p>who has essentially taken over some small corner</p>
<p>or multiple corners or machines within the gym.</p>
<p>And oftentimes you&rsquo;ll find that you&rsquo;ll walk back</p>
<p>to a machine or you&rsquo;ll walk back</p>
<p>to a given resistance exercise,</p>
<p>and someone has now taken it over,</p>
<p>and the whole thing can be thrown off.</p>
<p>So it takes a little bit of orchestrating</p>
<p>in order to do properly.</p>
<p>But in general, what people find</p>
<p>is that this can allow you to enhance performance overall</p>
<p>of these individual movements,</p>
<p>again, while maintaining the same amount of rest.</p>
<p>And even if you choose not to do this,</p>
<p>I encourage you to pay attention to this as a concept</p>
<p>because, again, it&rsquo;s leveraging this idea</p>
<p>of antagonistic muscles, flexors and extensors,</p>
<p>antagonistic neural relationships</p>
<p>between the spinal cord mechanisms</p>
<p>that control one set of muscles</p>
<p>and activating those muscles,</p>
<p>allowing the opposite antagonistic muscle to relax</p>
<p>and therefore to perform better on its next set.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to shift to the question</p>
<p>of what types of stretching can and should we do</p>
<p>to increase limb range of motion</p>
<p>if our goal is to do that in the most efficient way possible?</p>
<p>Because I realize that most people don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>endless amounts of time to dedicate to a stretching practice.</p>
<p>And even for those of us that do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you want to get the most outcome</p>
<p>for a given effort.</p>
<p>And what are the modes of stretching</p>
<p>that are going to allow us to increase our flexibility</p>
<p>and limb range of motion most safely?</p>
<p>Now, there are a number of different types of stretching</p>
<p>or methods of stretching.</p>
<p>Broadly defined, we can describe these as dynamic,</p>
<p>ballistic, static, and what&rsquo;s called PNF stretching.</p>
<p>PNF stands for proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation,</p>
<p>and it involves and leverages many of the mechanisms</p>
<p>that I described to you earlier.</p>
<p>The first two that I mentioned,</p>
<p>dynamic and ballistic stretching,</p>
<p>both involve some degree of momentum</p>
<p>and can be distinguished from static and PNF type stretching.</p>
<p>Now, to distinguish dynamic stretching</p>
<p>from ballistic stretching,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to focus on this element of momentum.</p>
<p>Both involve moving a limb through a given range of motion.</p>
<p>In dynamic stretching, however,</p>
<p>it tends to be more controlled, less use of momentum,</p>
<p>especially towards the end range of motion.</p>
<p>Whereas in ballistic stretching,</p>
<p>there tends to be a bit more swinging of the limb</p>
<p>or use of momentum.</p>
<p>So I invite you to visualize</p>
<p>what dynamic and ballistic stretching</p>
<p>might look like in your mind.</p>
<p>You can even try it if it&rsquo;s safe for you to try it.</p>
<p>You know, you could imagine swinging your arm up overhead</p>
<p>as much as possible and bring it down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this because I&rsquo;m seated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous movement to do while seated</p>
<p>or perhaps at all.</p>
<p>But for instance,</p>
<p>you can see dynamic and ballistic stretching</p>
<p>anytime someone, for instance,</p>
<p>is holding onto something with one arm</p>
<p>or maybe not holding on and swinging out their foot.</p>
<p>So essentially getting movement about the hip joint.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice that some people raise it up</p>
<p>and pause it and bring it down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one form of dynamic stretching.</p>
<p>Whereas others will swing it up</p>
<p>and sort of let it carry itself a bit further</p>
<p>due to the momentum at the top of the movement</p>
<p>and then just let it drop back down</p>
<p>or maybe even control the descent.</p>
<p>There is an enormous range of parameter space here</p>
<p>or variables that one could imagine.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just simply no way</p>
<p>that we could subdivide all those.</p>
<p>But again, dynamic and ballistic stretching</p>
<p>both involve movement.</p>
<p>So we have to generate some force</p>
<p>in order to create that movement.</p>
<p>Ballistic stretching involving a bit more momentum</p>
<p>or sometimes a lot more momentum,</p>
<p>especially at the end range of motion.</p>
<p>Now, both of those are highly distinct</p>
<p>from static stretching,</p>
<p>which involves holding the end range of motion.</p>
<p>So minimizing the amount of momentum that&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>So to stay with a simple example</p>
<p>that we are all now familiar with</p>
<p>from our earlier discussion,</p>
<p>slowly bending over at the waist</p>
<p>and trying to touch your toes</p>
<p>or putting your hands to the floor</p>
<p>and then holding that end position</p>
<p>before coming up in a slow and controlled way</p>
<p>such that you reduce the amount of momentum to near zero</p>
<p>would be one example of static stretching.</p>
<p>Static stretching can be further subdivided</p>
<p>into active or passive, right?</p>
<p>There are different names for these kinds of approaches.</p>
<p>You can hear about the Anderson approach</p>
<p>or the Janda approach.</p>
<p>You can look these sorts of things up online.</p>
<p>And again, people tend to name things after themselves.</p>
<p>So some of these are proprietary</p>
<p>related to specific programs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not focusing on those.</p>
<p>Others come to be named after the physiologists</p>
<p>or the practitioners that initially popularized them.</p>
<p>As is always the case,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a naming and renaming</p>
<p>and claiming of territory with these things.</p>
<p>For the time being, I&rsquo;d like to just emphasize</p>
<p>that static stretching can be both active,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a dedicated effort</p>
<p>on the part of the stretcher, you,</p>
<p>to put force behind the hold</p>
<p>to kind of extend or literally to extend</p>
<p>the range of motion.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also passive static stretching</p>
<p>in which it&rsquo;s more of a relaxation</p>
<p>into a further range of motion.</p>
<p>And that can be a subtle distinction.</p>
<p>And there are other ways in which we can further distinguish</p>
<p>active and passive static stretching.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, static stretching involves</p>
<p>both those types of elements, active and passive,</p>
<p>but is really about eliminating momentum.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the PNF,</p>
<p>the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation.</p>
<p>And proprioception has several different meanings</p>
<p>in the context of neuroscience and physiology.</p>
<p>To just keep it really simple for today,</p>
<p>proprioception involves both a knowledge</p>
<p>and understanding of where our limbs are in space</p>
<p>and relative to our body,</p>
<p>typically relative to the midline.</p>
<p>So the brain is often trying to figure out</p>
<p>where are our limbs relative to our midline</p>
<p>down the center of our body.</p>
<p>And we know where our limbs are</p>
<p>based on so-called proprioceptive feedback.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s feedback that comes from sensory neurons, right?</p>
<p>Now you know what sensory neurons</p>
<p>that are essentially monitoring</p>
<p>or responding to events within the joints,</p>
<p>the connective tissue and the muscles,</p>
<p>and within the deep components of the muscles,</p>
<p>like the spindle reflex and within the tendons,</p>
<p>like the GTO, the Golgi tendon organ.</p>
<p>So PNF type stretching leverages these sorts of mechanisms,</p>
<p>these neural circuits by way of, for instance,</p>
<p>you would lie on your back.</p>
<p>And if your goal is to increase your hamstring flexibility</p>
<p>and the flexibility and range of motion</p>
<p>of other related muscle systems,</p>
<p>you might put a strap around your ankle</p>
<p>and pull that muscle, or I should say, excuse me,</p>
<p>that limb towards you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to pull the muscle towards you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to pull that limb, your ankle towards you</p>
<p>to try and get it sort of back over your head,</p>
<p>and then progressively relaxing into that,</p>
<p>or maybe even putting some additional force</p>
<p>to push the end range of motion and then relaxing it,</p>
<p>and then actually trying to stretch that same limb</p>
<p>or increase the limb range of motion without the strap.</p>
<p>Sometimes these are assisted by other people.</p>
<p>So people will even use loads.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll even use machines.</p>
<p>There are a number of different apparati</p>
<p>that have been designed for this.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;ll involve a training partner.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge range of PNF protocols,</p>
<p>and those protocols can be done both by oneself</p>
<p>with or without straps, with machines, with actual weights,</p>
<p>or with training partners.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the variation of exercises</p>
<p>to say target your hamstrings versus your quadriceps</p>
<p>versus your shoulders versus your chest muscles, et cetera,</p>
<p>your neck muscles, and so on,</p>
<p>there is an enormous range of information</p>
<p>on dynamic, ballistic, static, and PNF stretches</p>
<p>for all the various muscle groups.</p>
<p>And I should say there are some excellent books</p>
<p>on those topics.</p>
<p>There are also some excellent videos on YouTube</p>
<p>and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to find exercises</p>
<p>that allow you to target specific muscle groups.</p>
<p>Again, I encourage you to be safe in how you approach this,</p>
<p>and I would encourage you also to pay attention</p>
<p>to the information that soon follows</p>
<p>as to what sorts of protocols one would use</p>
<p>to apply those exercises.</p>
<p>But the number of exercises</p>
<p>and the availability of those exercises</p>
<p>for targeting different muscle groups</p>
<p>with these four different kinds of stretching</p>
<p>is both immense and fortunately, thankfully,</p>
<p>immediately accessible to all of us often at zero cost.</p>
<p>So specific exercises to target specific muscle groups aside,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve now established that there are four major categories</p>
<p>of stretching, or at least those are the four major</p>
<p>categories I&rsquo;m defining today.</p>
<p>And we can further divide those categories</p>
<p>into which are the ones that are going to be most effective</p>
<p>for increasing range of motion in the long-term,</p>
<p>not just in one individual session.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been a number of studies exploring this.</p>
<p>I can list out at least four, and we&rsquo;ll put those four</p>
<p>as a kind of a cluster under one heading</p>
<p>in the show note captions</p>
<p>that arrive at essentially the same answer,</p>
<p>which is that for increasing limb range of motion,</p>
<p>it does appear that static type, including PNF,</p>
<p>but static type stretching is going to be more effective</p>
<p>than dynamic and ballistic stretching.</p>
<p>So at least to my mind, this is good news.</p>
<p>Why is it good news to me?</p>
<p>Well, while dynamic and ballistic stretching</p>
<p>can be immensely useful for improving performance</p>
<p>of specific movements,</p>
<p>in particular in the context of particular sports</p>
<p>like tennis or in sprinting, or frankly, for any sport,</p>
<p>they do carry with them a certain amount of risk</p>
<p>because of the use of momentum.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to be highly trained</p>
<p>in order to perform them.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a place, and we will describe</p>
<p>when one would want to apply dynamic</p>
<p>or ballistic stretching.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give away for now,</p>
<p>I think that most physios out there,</p>
<p>and certainly the ones that I spoke to,</p>
<p>Dr. Andy Galpin, Dr. Kelly Starrett, and a few others,</p>
<p>point to the fact that doing some safe dynamic</p>
<p>and ballistic stretching prior to, say,</p>
<p>a resistance training session,</p>
<p>or maybe even prior to a cardiovascular training session</p>
<p>can be useful, both in terms of range of motion effects</p>
<p>and in terms of neural activation effects.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to use the words warm up</p>
<p>because warming up is typically associated</p>
<p>with increasing core body temperature, as it should be.</p>
<p>But for engaging the neural circuits</p>
<p>and becoming familiarized with the neural circuits</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re about to use in other movements,</p>
<p>while also increasing the range of motion</p>
<p>of the joints involved in those movements</p>
<p>so that you can perform them more safely</p>
<p>and more confidently.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m certainly not saying, I want to repeat,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not saying that dynamic</p>
<p>and ballistic stretching are not useful.</p>
<p>They absolutely are.</p>
<p>But in terms of increasing limb range of motion</p>
<p>in the long-term, of truly becoming more flexible</p>
<p>as opposed to transiently more flexible,</p>
<p>static stretching, which includes PNF,</p>
<p>appears to be the best route to go.</p>
<p>So if your goal is to increase your limb range of motion</p>
<p>for a given muscle group, or perhaps for all muscle groups,</p>
<p>although I can imagine that&rsquo;d be pretty tough.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not going to spend time,</p>
<p>I could imagine, working on your tongue muscle control</p>
<p>or neck muscle control and every muscle control.</p>
<p>But most of us want to reduce so-called tightness</p>
<p>in air quotes and increase limb range of motion</p>
<p>for certain muscle groups.</p>
<p>And it appears that the best way to do that</p>
<p>is going to be static stretching of some kind,</p>
<p>which raises the question of how often</p>
<p>to do that static stretching</p>
<p>and how long to hold those static stretches.</p>
<p>And we can also ask the question,</p>
<p>we should ask the question,</p>
<p>where to hold those static stretches?</p>
<p>Is it always a good idea to hold those static stretches</p>
<p>at the end or the point of maximal range of motion?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to address that now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some terrific science around this.</p>
<p>A slightly older study, but nonetheless a powerful one,</p>
<p>because it provided a foundation</p>
<p>for a lot of subsequent work,</p>
<p>which basically served to just confirm</p>
<p>the answer they got here,</p>
<p>is a study from Bandy et al.</p>
<p>And the title of this study is</p>
<p>the effect of time and frequency of static stretching</p>
<p>on the flexibility of the hamstring muscles.</p>
<p>It was a study involving 93 subjects.</p>
<p>So 61 men, 32 women, ranging in age from 21 to 39 years.</p>
<p>So a pretty broad demographic</p>
<p>who had limited hamstring muscle flexibility,</p>
<p>here I&rsquo;m paraphrasing,</p>
<p>and randomly assigned to one of five groups.</p>
<p>So the four stretching groups stretch five days per week</p>
<p>for six weeks.</p>
<p>The fifth group, which served as a control, did not stretch.</p>
<p>The results clearly show that, quote,</p>
<p>the change in flexibility appeared to be dependent</p>
<p>on the duration and frequency of stretching.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>This tells us that stretching for a given amount of time</p>
<p>scales with the amount of limb range of motion improvement</p>
<p>that one will see.</p>
<p>There were many interesting findings within this study,</p>
<p>but the one that I&rsquo;d like to highlight most is, quote,</p>
<p>the results of this study suggest that a 30 second duration</p>
<p>is an effective amount of time</p>
<p>to sustain a hamstring muscle stretch</p>
<p>in order to increase range of motion.</p>
<p>No increase in flexibility occurred</p>
<p>when the duration of stretching was increased</p>
<p>from 30 seconds to 60 seconds,</p>
<p>or when the frequency of stretching was increased</p>
<p>from one to three times per day.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we&rsquo;re starting to lay down some parameters.</p>
<p>What this study reveals and what subsequent studies tell us,</p>
<p>and we will get into those subsequent studies,</p>
<p>is that ideally one would do static stretches</p>
<p>that are held for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Perhaps more in certain instances,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll explain when that can be useful,</p>
<p>but here holding those stretches for more than 30 seconds</p>
<p>did not turn out to be additionally useful.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to stretch your quadriceps, for instance,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to hold that stretch in static fashion,</p>
<p>remember not using momentum,</p>
<p>and you can use the mental tricks</p>
<p>of either trying to push through the pain,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t recommend necessarily.</p>
<p>I think that makes us prone to injury,</p>
<p>or to relax into the stretch,</p>
<p>but nonetheless providing some force,</p>
<p>typically with a hand in order to pull your ankle back.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing a quadriceps stretch,</p>
<p>some people might do this on the edge of a sofa.</p>
<p>Remember, there are a lot of different exercises</p>
<p>and ways to do this that you can explore elsewhere.</p>
<p>Well, holding that static stretch for 30 seconds</p>
<p>appears to be sufficient to stimulate an increase</p>
<p>in limb range of motion over time.</p>
<p>Again, these are protocols</p>
<p>that were used repeatedly over time,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about how often to repeat them</p>
<p>in order to get maximal effect.</p>
<p>But 30 second holds for static stretches</p>
<p>is the number that I think we want to focus on,</p>
<p>and that most of us are going to want to utilize.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s explore how many sets of static stretching</p>
<p>one ought to do in order to get</p>
<p>a maximum range of motion improvement,</p>
<p>while not placing us into a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to create injury,</p>
<p>nor a situation where we have to be</p>
<p>constantly stretching throughout the day.</p>
<p>Because again, most of us don&rsquo;t have time to do that.</p>
<p>This issue of sets is an important one.</p>
<p>In the context of cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about the data that support the fact</p>
<p>that doing at least 150, and ideally,</p>
<p>as much as 200 minutes per week</p>
<p>of zone two cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>is very useful for cardiovascular health</p>
<p>and for other aspects of health.</p>
<p>And of course, there are other aspects</p>
<p>of cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>that could be layered onto and into that,</p>
<p>that can be useful like 90 second maximal sprints, et cetera,</p>
<p>discussed this a lot in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin</p>
<p>and on our episode about endurance.</p>
<p>And we also talked about sets</p>
<p>in the context of strength and hypertrophy building,</p>
<p>building muscle size and or strength</p>
<p>in the episode about that.</p>
<p>And in particular, in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>and there, we could also arrive at some specific parameters.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to vary, of course, between individuals,</p>
<p>depending on how hard you train,</p>
<p>whether or not you take sets to failure,</p>
<p>your repetition range, et cetera.</p>
<p>But in the context of strength and hypertrophy building,</p>
<p>we arrived at approximately six,</p>
<p>maybe as many as 10 sets per week per muscle group.</p>
<p>Some of that work is done as direct work</p>
<p>to a given muscle group.</p>
<p>Some of that work is indirect.</p>
<p>So doing certain pulling exercise, of course,</p>
<p>will target the latissimus dorsi muscles,</p>
<p>but also the biceps.</p>
<p>So if you, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>you have to do 10 sets for the biceps and for the lats.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re getting some indirect work, et cetera.</p>
<p>All of that was delineated</p>
<p>in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>And we arrived at those numbers of sets</p>
<p>according to the same criteria that we will apply here.</p>
<p>What is the minimum number of sets both to maintain</p>
<p>and to improve a given mode of performance?</p>
<p>Strength and hypertrophy or cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Again, to either maintain or improve.</p>
<p>And we can do the same thing for improving</p>
<p>or maintaining range of motion.</p>
<p>Because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the data points to the fact that</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t do some dedicated work</p>
<p>to improve range of motion over time,</p>
<p>we will lose our flexibility</p>
<p>and limb range of motion over time,</p>
<p>just by virtue of the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not doing anything to offset that.</p>
<p>So whether or not you want to maintain, reestablish,</p>
<p>or gain limb range of motion,</p>
<p>static stretching of holds of 30 seconds appear to be best.</p>
<p>Now the question is, how long should you do that?</p>
<p>And how many sets should you do that?</p>
<p>And how many times a week should you do that?</p>
<p>And to answer those questions,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to turn to what I think</p>
<p>is a really spectacular review.</p>
<p>This was a review that was published in the year 2018.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fairly recent.</p>
<p>First author, Thomas, Edwin Thomas, last author, Palma.</p>
<p>We will put a link to this in the show note caption.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>The Relation Between Stretching Typology</p>
<p>and Stretching Duration, The Effects on Range of Motion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very straightforward title.</p>
<p>This is a review article that explored</p>
<p>a number of different studies,</p>
<p>had criteria for whether or not those studies</p>
<p>could be evaluated in the context of the questions here,</p>
<p>had some quality standards and some other standards</p>
<p>that they applied, and basically winnowed down</p>
<p>a large collection of studies to a remaining 23 articles</p>
<p>that were able to be considered, quote,</p>
<p>eligible and included in the quantitative synthesis</p>
<p>done here.</p>
<p>So key points from that quantification and synthesis</p>
<p>done in this paper.</p>
<p>First of all, and I quote,</p>
<p>all stretching typologies showed range of motion</p>
<p>improvements over a long-term period.</p>
<p>However, the static protocols showed significant gains</p>
<p>with a p-value less than 0.05,</p>
<p>which means a probability that cannot be explained</p>
<p>by chance alone when compared to ballistic or PNF protocols.</p>
<p>So again, what we&rsquo;re hearing is that static stretching</p>
<p>is the preferred mode for increasing limb range of motion.</p>
<p>Although here they make the additional point</p>
<p>that static stretching might even be superior,</p>
<p>not just to ballistic stretching,</p>
<p>but also to PNF protocols.</p>
<p>Because before, as you may recall,</p>
<p>there was a distinction between ballistic and dynamic</p>
<p>and static and PNF.</p>
<p>And so here it appears again that static stretching</p>
<p>is sort of rising to the top of the list</p>
<p>as the optimal approach relative</p>
<p>to all other stretching approaches,</p>
<p>at least in the context of increasing limb range of motion.</p>
<p>The authors go on to say,</p>
<p>time spent stretching per week seems fundamental</p>
<p>to elicit range of movement improvements</p>
<p>when stretches are applied for at least</p>
<p>or more than five minutes per week.</p>
<p>Okay, this is critical.</p>
<p>This is not five minutes per stretch.</p>
<p>Remember, 30 seconds per static stretch,</p>
<p>but at least five minutes per week.</p>
<p>Whereas the time spent stretching within a single session</p>
<p>does not seem to have a significant effects</p>
<p>for range of motion gains.</p>
<p>If this is getting confusing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make sure that you soon understand</p>
<p>exactly what we can export from these conclusions.</p>
<p>The data indicate that performing stretching</p>
<p>at least five days a week,</p>
<p>now some of you may already be groaning,</p>
<p>for at least five minutes per week.</p>
<p>Okay, so five days per week, that&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>but at least five minutes per week,</p>
<p>five minutes per week is not that much.</p>
<p>Using static stretching may be beneficial</p>
<p>to promote range of motion improvements.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve read this study in detail now.</p>
<p>They highlight again, the reduction in flexibility</p>
<p>that occurs from 20 to 49 years of age and so on,</p>
<p>how acute bouts of short-term stretching</p>
<p>up to three weeks can improve stretch tolerance.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a key point that in the short-term,</p>
<p>the first three weeks of embarking</p>
<p>on a stretching and flexibility program,</p>
<p>much of the improvements come</p>
<p>from the short-term neural improvements</p>
<p>that we talked about before</p>
<p>of inhibiting the spindle reflex and so on,</p>
<p>and also a stretch tolerance,</p>
<p>a comfort with doing the movements</p>
<p>and maybe even a comfort in overriding</p>
<p>some of the pain mechanisms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk a little bit more about that in just a bit,</p>
<p>and the particular utility of yoga,</p>
<p>something that I don&rsquo;t often practice,</p>
<p>but that after reading this article</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll mention in a little bit,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m considering perhaps taking up</p>
<p>some form of yoga protocol.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve already highlighted some of the key takeaways</p>
<p>from the study, namely that we need to get</p>
<p>at least five minutes per week</p>
<p>of static stretching per muscle group.</p>
<p>And based on the previous paper that we talked about,</p>
<p>we need to divide that five minutes</p>
<p>into sets of 30 seconds each.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case</p>
<p>that you can do all of that in one day, unfortunately.</p>
<p>It does seem important that the frequency</p>
<p>of stretching practice distributed</p>
<p>throughout the week is important.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk protocols.</p>
<p>We are now talking about doing static stretching,</p>
<p>so holding, so limiting momentum,</p>
<p>and holding a stretch for 30 seconds per set.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about trying to achieve</p>
<p>five minutes per week of those static holds,</p>
<p>but that we can&rsquo;t do it all in one session</p>
<p>because the frequency of sessions</p>
<p>distributed throughout the week</p>
<p>correlates with the improvements in limb range of motion.</p>
<p>So what this means is that we should probably be doing</p>
<p>anywhere from two to four sets</p>
<p>of 30-second static hold stretches</p>
<p>five days per week or some variant thereof.</p>
<p>And I do say some variant thereof</p>
<p>because it turns out that even though</p>
<p>there was that earlier study that we talked about,</p>
<p>that holding a stretch for more than 30 seconds,</p>
<p>in that case, 60 seconds,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t turn out to be additionally beneficial.</p>
<p>It appears that if you do hold those stretches</p>
<p>for 60 seconds per static stretching set, for instance,</p>
<p>you can get away with stretching fewer days per week overall.</p>
<p>So in order to make this as clear as possible,</p>
<p>because I do realize there are a lot of parameters,</p>
<p>and you might be asking,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t you just make me a list</p>
<p>of the exact things I should do?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way</p>
<p>because once you understand the mechanisms</p>
<p>and once you understand your particular goals,</p>
<p>this information is designed for you</p>
<p>to be able to construct a stretching program</p>
<p>that is tailored to your specific goals.</p>
<p>If I just gave you the stretching program that I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>or I should say that I&rsquo;m soon to be doing</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m soon to be doing one</p>
<p>based on the research for this particular episode,</p>
<p>well, that wouldn&rsquo;t be beneficial for you.</p>
<p>Because for instance, if you have very flexible hamstrings,</p>
<p>but not very flexible quadriceps,</p>
<p>or you are somebody who is engaged in sport</p>
<p>or not engaged in sport,</p>
<p>what you need to do is going to vary somewhat.</p>
<p>So what would effective stretching protocol look like?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all trying to improve limb range of motion</p>
<p>for different limbs and different muscle groups.</p>
<p>But just by way of example,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s because the one we&rsquo;ve been using,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about hamstrings for the time being.</p>
<p>This could of course be applied to other muscle groups.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to improve hamstring flexibility</p>
<p>and limb range of motion about and around the hamstring</p>
<p>and involving the hamstring.</p>
<p>You would want to do three sets</p>
<p>of static stretching for the hamstring.</p>
<p>Again, easy to find such exercises on the internet.</p>
<p>You would do that by holding the stretch for 30 seconds,</p>
<p>resting some period of time,</p>
<p>and doing it again, holding for 30 seconds,</p>
<p>resting some period of time,</p>
<p>and then holding it for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>That would be one training session for the hamstrings.</p>
<p>I have to imagine that you&rsquo;d probably want to stretch</p>
<p>other muscle groups as well in that same session.</p>
<p>Although at least as far as I could tell,</p>
<p>there was no data pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t do your hamstring stretching</p>
<p>one part of the day and your quadriceps stretching</p>
<p>another part of the day.</p>
<p>But presumably you&rsquo;re going to want to combine</p>
<p>your flexibility training into one single session.</p>
<p>So three sets of 30 seconds each, you get 90 seconds,</p>
<p>and you would do that ideally five times a week</p>
<p>or maybe even more, because it does seem like frequency</p>
<p>distributed throughout the week is an important parameter.</p>
<p>Now, one thing that we have not highlighted</p>
<p>or at least described is how long to rest</p>
<p>between stretching sets.</p>
<p>And despite my efforts,</p>
<p>I could not find research back information</p>
<p>that pointed to whether or not 30 seconds of rest</p>
<p>for every 30 seconds stretching or 60 seconds rest</p>
<p>for every 30 seconds stretching was ideal.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that doubling the amount</p>
<p>of time for the interleaving rest would be appropriate</p>
<p>or at least doable.</p>
<p>If anyone out there has knowledge about rest</p>
<p>between stretching sets and has some physiology</p>
<p>or some biology or some experiential information</p>
<p>as to why a given ratio of duration of static stretch</p>
<p>to rest in between static stretch sets ought to be used,</p>
<p>please put it in the comments on YouTube.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a terrific way for us to get that information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to do any follow-up to links that you provide</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re starting to build into a protocol</p>
<p>that is backed by the scientific data.</p>
<p>Three sets of 30 seconds of holds done five times</p>
<p>or maybe even six times per week.</p>
<p>One thing that did show up in my exploration</p>
<p>of the peer-reviewed research is this notion</p>
<p>of warming up for all this.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked about that yet.</p>
<p>In general, to avoid injury,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good idea to raise your core body temperature a bit</p>
<p>before doing these kinds of stretches,</p>
<p>even these static stretches,</p>
<p>which we can sort of ease into</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t involve ballistic movement by definition.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway that I was able to find</p>
<p>was that if we are already warm from running</p>
<p>or from weight training or from some other activity,</p>
<p>that doing the static stretching practice</p>
<p>at the end of that weight training or cardiovascular</p>
<p>or other physical session would allow us</p>
<p>to go immediately into the stretching session</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re already warm, so to speak.</p>
<p>Otherwise, raising one&rsquo;s core body temperature by a bit</p>
<p>by doing five to seven, maybe even 10 minutes</p>
<p>of easy cardiovascular exercise or calisthenic movements,</p>
<p>provided you can do those without getting injured,</p>
<p>seems to be an ideal way</p>
<p>to warm up the body for stretching.</p>
<p>We should be warm or warm up to stretch,</p>
<p>although those warmups don&rsquo;t have to be extremely extensive.</p>
<p>And then just by way of logic,</p>
<p>doing the static stretching after resistance training</p>
<p>or cardiovascular training seems to be most beneficial.</p>
<p>In fact, and unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have time</p>
<p>to go into this in too much detail today,</p>
<p>I was able to find a number of papers</p>
<p>that make the argument that static stretching</p>
<p>prior to cardiovascular training</p>
<p>and maybe even prior to resistance training</p>
<p>can limit our performance</p>
<p>in running and resistance training.</p>
<p>I realize that&rsquo;s a controversial area.</p>
<p>You have those who say, no, it&rsquo;s immensely beneficial.</p>
<p>You have those who say, no, it inhibits performance.</p>
<p>And those that say, no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a matter of how exactly you perform</p>
<p>that static stretching and which muscle groups</p>
<p>and how you&rsquo;re doing this and how much time</p>
<p>in between static stretching and performance.</p>
<p>But to leave all that aside,</p>
<p>doing static stretching after some other form of exercise,</p>
<p>and not after some form of exercise after a brief warmup</p>
<p>to raise your core body temperature</p>
<p>definitely seems like the right way to go.</p>
<p>Now, for some of you out there,</p>
<p>and I confess for me as well,</p>
<p>doing something five days a week seems like a big commitment</p>
<p>even if that commitment is one</p>
<p>to only do three sets of 30 second static stretches.</p>
<p>I say this because you&rsquo;ve got the warmup.</p>
<p>I generally like to bring a kind of a focus</p>
<p>and dedication to a practice.</p>
<p>And of course, because when doing these kinds of protocols,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;re not just stretching your hamstring.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just 90 seconds of work</p>
<p>with a minute of rest in between,</p>
<p>but very likely that also doing quadriceps stretching</p>
<p>and also doing stretching for the shoulders</p>
<p>and stretching for the back and the neck and so on.</p>
<p>And so that entire session is going to take some time.</p>
<p>And five days a week is a pretty serious commitment</p>
<p>for most, especially for those of us that don&rsquo;t exercise</p>
<p>or do athletics for a living, which I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there is some evidence from the literature</p>
<p>that one can get away with,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t even know that we should think about it</p>
<p>as getting away with,</p>
<p>but that one can do longer hold static stretches</p>
<p>of up to say 60 seconds,</p>
<p>but do fewer total sessions per week.</p>
<p>So rather than three 30 second static holds,</p>
<p>doing three 60 second static holds</p>
<p>and doing those every other day.</p>
<p>And there really hasn&rsquo;t been a systematic exploration</p>
<p>of this, the article that I was referring to</p>
<p>just a few moments ago,</p>
<p>this analysis of the 23 articles was combined</p>
<p>into this enormous set of tables</p>
<p>and some really quite nice graphs</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re welcome to look at</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re going to provide a link to the study.</p>
<p>There are a couple of key takeaways that I want to mention</p>
<p>that are separate from this issue of how long to stretch</p>
<p>and how often.</p>
<p>First of all, they describe in their discussion</p>
<p>that there were improvements in range of motion</p>
<p>independent of whether or not people did static stretching,</p>
<p>active stretching, passive stretching,</p>
<p>ballistic stretching, or PNF stretching.</p>
<p>So all of those forms of stretching</p>
<p>will improve limb range of motion.</p>
<p>This is essential to point out,</p>
<p>and I want to emphasize this.</p>
<p>Static stretching, however,</p>
<p>gave the greatest degree of gains in limb range of motion.</p>
<p>And on average, they saw a 20.9% increase,</p>
<p>but some of the other increases they observed</p>
<p>were also quite substantial.</p>
<p>So ballistic stretching can also provide</p>
<p>some pretty impressive limb range of motion improvements.</p>
<p>However, they tended to be in the range of,</p>
<p>here they point out 11.65% increase,</p>
<p>or in the case of PNF, a 15% increase.</p>
<p>So it appears that the greatest improvements</p>
<p>in limb range of motion for your time spent</p>
<p>and effort spent is going to be</p>
<p>this minimum of five minutes per week</p>
<p>to elicit a significant response,</p>
<p>with five days being the minimum</p>
<p>weekly recommended frequency</p>
<p>to achieve significant range of motion improvements.</p>
<p>I confess this was pretty surprising to me</p>
<p>when I compare flexibility training to, say,</p>
<p>resistance training for strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the experience,</p>
<p>and I know that other people have had the experience,</p>
<p>and I think Dr. Andy Galpin would probably agree</p>
<p>that provided one trains hard enough and appropriately</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t need to train resistance training</p>
<p>five days a week in order to get significant improvements</p>
<p>in strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Some people might need to,</p>
<p>but you can get a lot of positive results</p>
<p>in those variables with less frequent training,</p>
<p>certainly with three or four days a week of training.</p>
<p>And for cardiovascular training,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of anyone having tested</p>
<p>whether or not one very long run each week</p>
<p>can actually increase cardiovascular fitness,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not doing anything else,</p>
<p>although I have to imagine you&rsquo;d probably see</p>
<p>some improvement compared to not doing anything.</p>
<p>But most people are doing repeated training sessions</p>
<p>of cardiovascular strength training.</p>
<p>Not a lot of people are doing five days a week</p>
<p>of strength training, at least that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>Some people are, but most people, I think, are not.</p>
<p>And some people are doing five or more days a week</p>
<p>of cardiovascular training.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that most people are not doing five days a week</p>
<p>of dedicated static stretch,</p>
<p>range of motion directed training.</p>
<p>But it does appear that that frequency about the week,</p>
<p>getting those repeated sessions,</p>
<p>even if they are short for an individual muscle group,</p>
<p>turns out to be important.</p>
<p>And so that points to the, perhaps the reason why</p>
<p>so few people are doing dedicated range of motion work.</p>
<p>But it also reminds me that all of the studies</p>
<p>that were described, at least in this review,</p>
<p>and some of the other ones that were not,</p>
<p>really show impressive changes in limb range of motion.</p>
<p>I mean, 20 plus percent, or even 15% with PNF.</p>
<p>I mean, these are big changes that are going to benefit us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to offset the age-related losses</p>
<p>in flexibility, for sure,</p>
<p>if one is dedicated about these practices.</p>
<p>And in many cases,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to increase limb range of motion</p>
<p>in ways that are going to allow us better performance</p>
<p>in certain physical endeavors, certainly better balance.</p>
<p>All right, we haven&rsquo;t really talked</p>
<p>about balance and stability,</p>
<p>but range of motion can impair balance and stability</p>
<p>in some extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>But by and large, limb range of motion, lack of tightness,</p>
<p>improved posture, improved physical performance, excuse me.</p>
<p>And things of that sort is something that I think</p>
<p>we can all benefit from,</p>
<p>and that are key features of longevity.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t often think of them</p>
<p>because we so prioritize cardiovascular health</p>
<p>and the relationship between the heart and brain health</p>
<p>and resistance training and musculoskeletal hypertrophy</p>
<p>or strength, et cetera.</p>
<p>But as I delved into this literature,</p>
<p>it really highlighted for me the extent to which</p>
<p>having really good limb range of motion,</p>
<p>at least maintaining limb range of motion</p>
<p>as we age from year to year,</p>
<p>and maybe even improving limb range of motion</p>
<p>can be immensely beneficial for reducing pain,</p>
<p>for, again, improving posture,</p>
<p>improving our ability to perform, to walk, et cetera.</p>
<p>And indeed, there&rsquo;s a whole literature</p>
<p>that relates our limb range of motion</p>
<p>to things like pain management</p>
<p>of things related to headache and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So limb range of motion is not just about</p>
<p>becoming a contortionist</p>
<p>or being able to complete the yoga class.</p>
<p>It really is about maintaining the integrity</p>
<p>and the health of the neuromuscular system,</p>
<p>the connective tissue,</p>
<p>and the neuromuscular connective network,</p>
<p>because those are indeed working</p>
<p>as an ecosystem and a network.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just briefly touch on PNF stretching</p>
<p>for a moment.</p>
<p>Again, this is a vast landscape with many parameters</p>
<p>and different practitioners,</p>
<p>a lot of competing opinions out there, to put it lightly.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I do want to emphasize</p>
<p>that the PNF training leverages those spindle mechanisms</p>
<p>and GTO mechanisms that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>But I realized that in describing</p>
<p>the quadricep contraction, hamstring stretch,</p>
<p>little mini experiment that hopefully you did,</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t really highlight the role of the GTOs,</p>
<p>the Golgi Tendon Organs, that much.</p>
<p>And I just would like to just briefly do that for a moment.</p>
<p>The GTOs have multiple functions.</p>
<p>In fact, I think even though GTOs</p>
<p>are in every medical textbook, every physiology textbook,</p>
<p>every first-year neuroscientist learns about them</p>
<p>when learning about the neuromuscular junctions</p>
<p>and the mechanisms of interoception, et cetera,</p>
<p>they are likely to have other functions as well.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons why PNF stretching does work,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re doing that by using a strap</p>
<p>to pull back a limb,</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re actively contracting</p>
<p>your quadriceps to then release</p>
<p>and emphasize stretch range of motion for your hamstrings</p>
<p>and related muscle groups,</p>
<p>is that activation of those GTOs,</p>
<p>meaning putting loads and tension into that system,</p>
<p>can inhibit the spindles</p>
<p>in the opposite antagonistic muscle groups.</p>
<p>And so one of the reasons why flexing,</p>
<p>or I should say contracting your quadriceps</p>
<p>really intensely for some period of time</p>
<p>allows your hamstrings to subsequently</p>
<p>experience greater range of motion,</p>
<p>and again, it&rsquo;s not just the hamstrings,</p>
<p>but the related connective tissue</p>
<p>and neural circuits, et cetera,</p>
<p>is because, yes, it&rsquo;s, quote-unquote,</p>
<p>relaxing the hamstrings and the spindle,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a direct relationship</p>
<p>between activation of the GTOs in the quadricep</p>
<p>and release of the spindles</p>
<p>in the hamstring and related muscles.</p>
<p>This has a name, it&rsquo;s called autogenic inhibition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fancy name for contraction of one muscle group</p>
<p>providing a relaxation of the other muscle group</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s antagonistic to it.</p>
<p>And it relates back to this idea</p>
<p>of interleaving sets in the gym.</p>
<p>So if you think back to that example,</p>
<p>now it should make sense as to why, for instance,</p>
<p>if you do, let&rsquo;s say, a set of bench presses</p>
<p>or shoulder presses, and you,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you get 10 repetitions and you fail on the 11th,</p>
<p>that muscle is very, very fatigued.</p>
<p>If you were to rest some period of time</p>
<p>and then go back and do another set,</p>
<p>well, during the rest, that muscle group has been relaxing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously not contracting the same way it was</p>
<p>during the resistance set,</p>
<p>but by going and doing a pulling exercise</p>
<p>that involves the antagonistic muscle group,</p>
<p>so strongly contracting the back muscles through a pull,</p>
<p>like a pull down or a chin up or a row type exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re activating or near activating the GTO system</p>
<p>in those pulling muscles in a way</p>
<p>that provides autogenic inhibition for the pushing muscles.</p>
<p>Now, again, the physios out there</p>
<p>are probably either screaming or banging their heads</p>
<p>against whatever sound system</p>
<p>this happens to be arriving through to them saying,</p>
<p>wait, but in many cases, the GTOs aren&rsquo;t activated enough</p>
<p>to provide that autogenic inhibition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but even the sub-threshold activation</p>
<p>of those intraspinal circuits,</p>
<p>so the place where the GTO circuit</p>
<p>and the spindle circuit interact,</p>
<p>can provide an additional replenishment</p>
<p>of say the pushing muscles</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re activating those pulling muscles.</p>
<p>And this is at least one, not the only,</p>
<p>but at least one mechanisms</p>
<p>by which interleaving push and pull, push and pull</p>
<p>for both strength and hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>but also for range of motion stretching type training</p>
<p>can allow you to achieve better results</p>
<p>in a shorter period of time.</p>
<p>And I raise this because I want to keep in mind</p>
<p>the efficiency of any training program.</p>
<p>We just a moment ago established that doing, for example,</p>
<p>three sets of 30 second static holds</p>
<p>can be very useful for the hamstrings with,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say for sake of simplicity and practicality,</p>
<p>a minute&rsquo;s rest in between.</p>
<p>But during that minute&rsquo;s rest,</p>
<p>you can stretch the opposite antagonistic muscle group,</p>
<p>such as the quadriceps.</p>
<p>Or if you want to use PNF training,</p>
<p>you could do loading of the quadriceps in between.</p>
<p>So there are a number of different ways</p>
<p>in which you can start to interleave</p>
<p>static stretching with PNF stretching.</p>
<p>You can start to interleave even PNF type protocols</p>
<p>with resistance training,</p>
<p>although that gets a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>You can really start to construct and build protocols</p>
<p>that are ideal for you.</p>
<p>What we will do is for an upcoming neural network newsletter.</p>
<p>So for those of you that aren&rsquo;t familiar,</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>has a so-called neural network newsletter.</p>
<p>These are monthly newsletters</p>
<p>where we put distilled points from the podcast</p>
<p>and oftentimes protocols in a downloadable PDF form.</p>
<p>You can access it by giving us your email.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t share your email with anybody.</p>
<p>If you want to see examples of these,</p>
<p>you can go to hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>and go to the menu and see newsletter.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to sign up for anything</p>
<p>to see examples of what these are like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a couple of different protocols.</p>
<p>One that is pure static stretching,</p>
<p>one that involves PNF type stretching,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll also put down a protocol</p>
<p>that involves the antagonistic interleaved muscle training</p>
<p>of the sort that I&rsquo;ve been describing a few times</p>
<p>throughout this episode.</p>
<p>And then you can try and apply those either separately</p>
<p>or maybe combine them in some way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s useful for your goals.</p>
<p>There are a couple of key elements</p>
<p>that are essential for building a safe and effective</p>
<p>range of motion increasing program</p>
<p>that arrived to us both through the peer reviewed research</p>
<p>and admittedly from people that have been involved</p>
<p>in teaching and training range of motion</p>
<p>for a very long period of time.</p>
<p>Some of you may be familiar</p>
<p>with the so-called Anderson method.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ve never met Anderson.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I should know this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if he&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>I hope he&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>But in any event, there are a lot of different features</p>
<p>to the Anderson and other protocols.</p>
<p>But one of the aspects of the Anderson protocol</p>
<p>that I think is highly relevant,</p>
<p>in fact, I know is relevant to the peer reviewed research</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about in a few moments</p>
<p>is this notion of pushing through pain</p>
<p>and how active or how passive to be about static stretching.</p>
<p>Now, this is somewhat subjective, right?</p>
<p>If you think about getting into a stretch,</p>
<p>again, we&rsquo;ll just use the hamstrings, for example.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re either reaching for your toes while seated</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re using a strap</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re raising your foot overhead while lying down,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re doing a toe touch type exercise.</p>
<p>How far should you reach?</p>
<p>Where is the end range of motion?</p>
<p>Should you bounce?</p>
<p>Should you not bounce?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about that in a moment.</p>
<p>But Anderson has an interesting idea and principle,</p>
<p>which is thread through a lot of his teachings</p>
<p>that I think are very much in keeping with the study</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m about to describe next,</p>
<p>where he emphasizes to, yes,</p>
<p>to stretch to the end of the range of motion,</p>
<p>but not to focus so much</p>
<p>on where that range of motion happens to be that day.</p>
<p>So for instance, not thinking,</p>
<p>oh, I can always touch my toes, for instance,</p>
<p>and therefore that&rsquo;s the starting place</p>
<p>for my flexibility training today,</p>
<p>but rather to take the entirety of your system</p>
<p>into account each day and understand that,</p>
<p>okay, provided you&rsquo;re warmed up appropriately,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re now going to stretch your hamstrings,</p>
<p>for instance, and you&rsquo;re going to reach down for your toes,</p>
<p>but that your range of motion might be adjusted that day</p>
<p>by way of tension and stress,</p>
<p>or by way of ambient temperature in the room,</p>
<p>and to basically define the end range of motion</p>
<p>as the place where you can feel the stretch</p>
<p>in the relevant muscle groups.</p>
<p>I think this is important</p>
<p>because unlike resistance training or cardiovascular training</p>
<p>where we can measure distance traveled over time</p>
<p>in the case of cardiovascular training,</p>
<p>or how much weight is on the bar</p>
<p>and count repetitions, et cetera,</p>
<p>with range of motion training,</p>
<p>of course, range of motion is the feature</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re interested in,</p>
<p>but there is likely to be a lot of variation from day to day</p>
<p>based on a number of different internal and external factors.</p>
<p>And so the Anderson method is really about</p>
<p>getting into static and other forms of stretching.</p>
<p>I think today we&rsquo;ve mainly been focusing</p>
<p>on static stretching and holding the end range of motion,</p>
<p>but really paying attention to the feel of the stretch</p>
<p>and the muscles involved.</p>
<p>And there are parallels in resistance</p>
<p>in cardiovascular training too, I realize, right?</p>
<p>In the case of trying to build hypertrophy,</p>
<p>or I should say improve hypertrophy muscle size,</p>
<p>oftentimes the best advice that one can give</p>
<p>is to don&rsquo;t try to lift weights,</p>
<p>but rather to challenge muscles.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you need to provide adequate loads</p>
<p>in order to get hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re training purely for strength,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about moving weights.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re training purely for hypertrophy</p>
<p>or mainly for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really about challenging muscles</p>
<p>using weights or other forms of resistance.</p>
<p>And similarly, and in keeping with this Anderson method,</p>
<p>when trying to build limb range of motion,</p>
<p>doing static stretching at a place where it&rsquo;s difficult,</p>
<p>but that you can experience the stretch of the muscle</p>
<p>cognitively, consciously,</p>
<p>being able to focus on the muscles and their stretch</p>
<p>is at least as useful</p>
<p>as is evaluating the current range of motion</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to achieve.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>This means feel the muscles as you stretch them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just go through the motions.</p>
<p>And this means don&rsquo;t get so attached</p>
<p>to being able to always achieve, for instance,</p>
<p>a stretch of a given distance within a given session.</p>
<p>You might actually find that by just finding the place</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t get much further</p>
<p>and holding the static stretch there,</p>
<p>that on the second and third set</p>
<p>that you happen to be doing that day,</p>
<p>that your range of motion will be increased considerably.</p>
<p>Maybe not, but very likely, yes, you will.</p>
<p>And of course, evaluating range of motion over time</p>
<p>is the key parameter</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the goal of all this type of work.</p>
<p>Now, along these lines,</p>
<p>there is this variable that we&rsquo;ve mentioned a few times</p>
<p>of passive versus active stretching.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this even more nebulous variable,</p>
<p>this even more kind of subjective thing</p>
<p>of how much effort to put into it.</p>
<p>Should you push into the stretch?</p>
<p>Do you even want to bounce a tiny bit?</p>
<p>Would you want to reach into that end point</p>
<p>and try and extend it within a given set and session?</p>
<p>And for that reason, I was excited to find this paper</p>
<p>entitled, A Comparison of Two Stretching Modalities</p>
<p>on Lower Limb Range of Motion Measurements</p>
<p>in Recreational Dancers.</p>
<p>It happens to be done in recreational dancers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a six-week intervention program</p>
<p>that compared low-intensity stretching,</p>
<p>which they call micro-stretching.</p>
<p>They used a capital M,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know if that means that it&rsquo;s proprietary,</p>
<p>although I didn&rsquo;t see evidence of a conflict of interest,</p>
<p>but they call it micro-stretching.</p>
<p>But to be very clear,</p>
<p>micro-stretching in the case of this manuscript</p>
<p>is low-intensity stretching,</p>
<p>and they compared that</p>
<p>with moderate-intensity static stretching</p>
<p>on an active and passive ranges of motion.</p>
<p>Okay, so there are a lot of different variables here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just highlight a few of the things</p>
<p>that are really most relevant to us.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you the takeaway at the outset</p>
<p>and then return to it at the end</p>
<p>so that if I lose any of your attention</p>
<p>in the next couple of minutes,</p>
<p>at least you have that key takeaway.</p>
<p>Basically, what they found was</p>
<p>that a six-week training program</p>
<p>using very low-intensity stretching</p>
<p>had a greater positive effect on lower limb range of motion</p>
<p>than did moderate-intensity static stretching.</p>
<p>I find that incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>So very low intensity,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll define what that means in a moment.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m quoting them.</p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of the study</p>
<p>was the greater increase in active range of motion</p>
<p>compared to passive range of motion</p>
<p>by the micro-stretching group.</p>
<p>So this relates to what we were just talking about</p>
<p>a few moments ago as it relates to the Anderson method,</p>
<p>which is that very low-intensity stretching,</p>
<p>meaning effort that feels not painful,</p>
<p>and in fact might even feel easy</p>
<p>or at least not straining to exceed a given range of motion</p>
<p>turns out to not just be as effective,</p>
<p>but more effective than moderate-intensity stretching.</p>
<p>So what is low-intensity static stretching?</p>
<p>Well, they define this as the stretches were completed</p>
<p>at an intensity of 30 to 40%,</p>
<p>where 100% equals the point of pain, right?</p>
<p>So 30 to 40% in these individuals,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing,</p>
<p>induced a relaxed state within the individual</p>
<p>and the specific muscle,</p>
<p>and here they were holding these static stretches,</p>
<p>I should mention, for one minute, not 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Now, the control group</p>
<p>was doing the exact same overall protocol,</p>
<p>so daily stretching for six weeks, the same exercises,</p>
<p>holding each set for 60 seconds,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re using an intensity of stretch of 80%,</p>
<p>where, again, 100 represents the point of pain,</p>
<p>the point where the person would want to stop stretching.</p>
<p>I find these data incredibly interesting</p>
<p>for I think what ought to be obvious reasons.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to embark on a flexibility</p>
<p>and stretching training program,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to push to the point of pain.</p>
<p>In fact, it seems that even just approaching</p>
<p>the point of pain is going to be less effective</p>
<p>than operating at this 30 to 40% of intensity</p>
<p>prior to reaching that pain threshold,</p>
<p>the pain threshold being 100%.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this is pretty subjective,</p>
<p>but I think all of us should be able</p>
<p>to register within ourselves</p>
<p>so whether a given range of motion</p>
<p>or extending a given range of motion</p>
<p>brings us to that threshold of pain or near pain,</p>
<p>and according to this study, at least,</p>
<p>operating or performing stretching at an intensity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s quite low, that&rsquo;s very relaxing,</p>
<p>turns out to be more beneficial</p>
<p>in increasing range of motion</p>
<p>than is doing exercises</p>
<p>aimed at increasing range of motion at a higher intensity.</p>
<p>Okay, so lower intensity stretching,</p>
<p>I should say lower intensity static stretching</p>
<p>appears to be the most beneficial way to approach stretching</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s a relief probably to many of us</p>
<p>because it also suggests that the injury risk</p>
<p>is going to be lower than if one were pushing</p>
<p>into the pain zone, so to speak.</p>
<p>The authors offer a number of different explanations</p>
<p>as to why this approach,</p>
<p>this micro-stretching approach might be more effective.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing from their discussion</p>
<p>where they mentioned that it could be hypothesized</p>
<p>that they had improved reciprocal inhibition</p>
<p>within the hamstring muscle group.</p>
<p>So this gets right back to the sorts of neural mechanisms</p>
<p>that we talked about before,</p>
<p>that somehow by doing this low intensity stretching,</p>
<p>that they were able to access some of those spindle</p>
<p>and GTO type mechanisms that we were referring to earlier</p>
<p>and the inhibition of hamstring and quadricep stretches.</p>
<p>They also offer a number of different ideas</p>
<p>about how this could shift the activation</p>
<p>of the so-called sympathetic,</p>
<p>remember the kind of stress division of our nervous system</p>
<p>and to reduce that relative to activation</p>
<p>of the parasympathetic arm of the nervous system.</p>
<p>I confess they have a couple of arguments</p>
<p>around sympathetic, parasympathetic</p>
<p>that are somewhat convoluted.</p>
<p>I will just, in fairness to the neuroscience</p>
<p>on those systems, I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest putting too much weight</p>
<p>on their arguments about sympathetic and parasympathetic.</p>
<p>To my mind, they didn&rsquo;t really hold much water,</p>
<p>but here I&rsquo;m not trying to be disparaging</p>
<p>of the overall work, which I think is really quite sound,</p>
<p>which is that low intensity, so-called micro-stretching</p>
<p>is going to be the most effective way</p>
<p>to increase limb range of movement over time.</p>
<p>I want to just briefly return to this idea</p>
<p>of whether or not to do ballistic or static stretching</p>
<p>before some sort of skill training or weight training</p>
<p>or any kind of sport</p>
<p>or even cardiovascular exercise like running.</p>
<p>Again, the data are really split out there.</p>
<p>There are even folks who suggest</p>
<p>that doing any kind of stretching prior to running</p>
<p>is going to lower running efficiency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to require essentially more work</p>
<p>and more oxygen uptake at a given speed</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>And runners and that community argue about this endlessly.</p>
<p>There are papers in both sides, in both directions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll hear about some of this in the comments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really going to take a stance on this</p>
<p>as a consequence because the data are all over the place.</p>
<p>However, I think there&rsquo;s a general logic</p>
<p>that we can apply in here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m borrowing from some conversations</p>
<p>and some information put out there by Dr. Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>who I think is of course both an expert</p>
<p>and thinks about these things</p>
<p>in a really sound and flexible way, no pun intended.</p>
<p>There are instances, for example,</p>
<p>where an individual might want to do some static stretching</p>
<p>to increase limb range of motion</p>
<p>prior to doing weight training,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s going to inhibit that person&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to lift as much weight.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do that?</p>
<p>Well, for instance, if somebody has a tightness</p>
<p>or a limitation in their neuromuscular</p>
<p>connective tissue system,</p>
<p>some place in their body and system</p>
<p>that prevents them from using proper form</p>
<p>that they can overcome by doing some static stretching,</p>
<p>well, that would be a great idea as Dr. Galpin points out.</p>
<p>Or for instance, if proper stability within the movement</p>
<p>requires increasing limb range of motion in some way,</p>
<p>well, then compromising the use of greater loads</p>
<p>could be greatly offset by doing some static stretching</p>
<p>to improve, say, hamstring flexibility</p>
<p>or another muscle group flexibility.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t always think about just what&rsquo;s going to allow us</p>
<p>or inhibit us from using the maximal amount of weight</p>
<p>or from running as far as we want to run</p>
<p>as fast as we want to run.</p>
<p>There are instances where people</p>
<p>are trying to overcome injuries,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re trying to come back from a reparative surgery</p>
<p>or something of that sort, coming back from a layoff,</p>
<p>where some additional static stretching</p>
<p>prior to cardiovascular weight training</p>
<p>or skill training or sport of some kind</p>
<p>is going to be useful</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to put us in a position of greater safety</p>
<p>and confidence and performance overall,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s adjusting down our speed</p>
<p>or the total amount of loads that we use.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s you that needs to consider</p>
<p>whether or not for you and within a given training session,</p>
<p>you want to do static training,</p>
<p>I should say static stretching range of motion training</p>
<p>prior to or after that training session.</p>
<p>And similarly, there are a lot of data pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that doing some dynamic or even ballistic stretching</p>
<p>prior to skill training or cardiovascular weight training</p>
<p>can be beneficial in part to warm up</p>
<p>the relevant neural circuits, joints,</p>
<p>and connective tissue and muscles,</p>
<p>and as well to perhaps improve range of motion</p>
<p>or ability to perform those movements more accurately</p>
<p>with more stability and therefore with more confidence.</p>
<p>And while Dr. Andy Galpin</p>
<p>would never name any protocol after himself,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s far too humble to do that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve named a couple of protocols after him,</p>
<p>particularly the Galpin equation for hydration</p>
<p>because he was willing to stick his neck out there</p>
<p>and put down some specific numbers that people could follow</p>
<p>in order to ensure proper hydration during training.</p>
<p>So you can look up the Galpin equation elsewhere,</p>
<p>you can just Google it or look elsewhere, you&rsquo;ll find it.</p>
<p>And Dr. Galpin has also been very thoughtful and generous,</p>
<p>and I think very accurate in offering</p>
<p>a kind of a general organizational logic</p>
<p>for how to think about the goals</p>
<p>of a particular training session</p>
<p>and thereby to decide whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do ballistic or static stretching</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So we can refer to this general approach</p>
<p>as Galpinian, Galpinian, is that right?</p>
<p>Galpinian logic, Galpinian logic.</p>
<p>Thus far, we&rsquo;ve been talking about stretching</p>
<p>for sake of increasing limb flexibility and range of motion,</p>
<p>but there are other reasons perhaps</p>
<p>to embark on a stretching protocol</p>
<p>that include both our ability to relax</p>
<p>and access deep relaxation quickly,</p>
<p>as well as even to reduce inflammation</p>
<p>and perhaps even combat certain forms of cancer.</p>
<p>And if that sounds really far-fetched,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that the study</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to share with you in a moment</p>
<p>was actually carried out by one of the directors</p>
<p>of a division of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>And this was the work of Helene Langevin,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a medical doctor, has done really important work</p>
<p>on the mechanisms underlying things like acupuncture</p>
<p>and has approached all that</p>
<p>from a very mechanistic viewpoint, right?</p>
<p>So not looking just at the effects of acupuncture,</p>
<p>but really trying to understand what sorts of cytokines,</p>
<p>inflammatory molecules and pathways are activated,</p>
<p>what sorts of neural mechanisms get engaged</p>
<p>by things like acupuncture</p>
<p>that impinges on the fascial tissues and so forth.</p>
<p>And Dr. Langevin is currently a director</p>
<p>of the National Institutes of Complementary Health</p>
<p>and Medicine at the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>So this is a major division supported by tax dollars</p>
<p>that support systematic mechanistic exploration</p>
<p>of things like respiration, meditation, yoga, acupuncture.</p>
<p>So this is serious science applied to protocols</p>
<p>and approaches that have been used for some period of time,</p>
<p>but really aimed at trying to understand</p>
<p>what would the best protocols be to evolve new protocols.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a really interesting study</p>
<p>done in animal models,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a powerful enough result</p>
<p>that I think we all should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The title of this paper,</p>
<p>and again, the last author is Dr. Langevin herself,</p>
<p>is Stretching Reduces Tumor Growth</p>
<p>in a Mouse Breast Cancer Model.</p>
<p>And yes, you can get mice to stretch.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you gently lift up mice by their tail</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll hold onto their cage,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way in which you can mechanically stretch them</p>
<p>in a way that doesn&rsquo;t harm them.</p>
<p>First, I should mention that Dr. Langevin and others</p>
<p>have shown that just a brief whole body stretch</p>
<p>of that sort induces an increase in activation</p>
<p>of the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>Again, not arm, limb, arm,</p>
<p>but the aspect of the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that creates a whole body,</p>
<p>whole nervous system shift toward more relaxation.</p>
<p>So yes, indeed, stretching induces relaxation</p>
<p>at a systemic level, not just at a local level.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Probably not surprising to those of you</p>
<p>that use stretching regularly,</p>
<p>but yes, it does indeed relax us.</p>
<p>Yes, you can do this in mice and see that in mice as well.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they did for this current study.</p>
<p>Or I should say this was a study published in 2018</p>
<p>in Scientific Reports.</p>
<p>They write, recent studies have shown</p>
<p>that gentle daily stretching for 10 minutes</p>
<p>can reduce local connective tissue inflammation and fibrosis.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s local tissue inflammation and fibrosis.</p>
<p>As well, we now know as systemic inflammation</p>
<p>and can induce relaxation systemically.</p>
<p>In this case, they focused on mice, not humans.</p>
<p>And mice were randomized to a stretch</p>
<p>versus no stretch condition</p>
<p>and were treated for 10 minutes once a day for four weeks.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s 10 minutes of this passive whole body stretching</p>
<p>a day for four weeks.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s remarkable, I mean, just I have to say</p>
<p>is just striking is that tumor volume in these mice,</p>
<p>they were able to induce tumors in these mice</p>
<p>and the tumor volume at the end point</p>
<p>was 52% smaller in the stretch group</p>
<p>compared to the no stretch group.</p>
<p>This is a highly significant effect.</p>
<p>And they point out in the absence of any other treatment.</p>
<p>And they explored whether or not cytotoxic immune responses</p>
<p>were activated and a number of other features.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t able to get too deeply</p>
<p>into the underlying mechanisms,</p>
<p>but this is pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>Even three weeks into this stretching protocol,</p>
<p>this daily stretching protocol for these mice,</p>
<p>tumor volume was reduced.</p>
<p>I mean, by, you know, it&rsquo;s almost halved.</p>
<p>This is pretty incredible.</p>
<p>So they have these measures of tumor volume</p>
<p>and the only difference in the way these animals</p>
<p>were treated and handled</p>
<p>was the introduction of this daily stretch.</p>
<p>I find this result to be, of course,</p>
<p>limited to the extent that it&rsquo;s done in an animal model,</p>
<p>not in humans, we have to point it out.</p>
<p>But as they point out in their discussion,</p>
<p>our results demonstrate a 52% reduction</p>
<p>in mammary tumor growth over one month</p>
<p>in mice undergoing stretching for 10 minutes a day</p>
<p>without any other form of therapy.</p>
<p>Do they think that stretching itself</p>
<p>is changing the tumor size?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>In fact, they raised the possibility that stretching</p>
<p>because of its impact on the fascia</p>
<p>might even create microenvironments</p>
<p>that are more permissive for tumor growth</p>
<p>in certain instances.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re careful to emphasize</p>
<p>what I also believe to be the case,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s unlikely that the stretching itself</p>
<p>was directly acting to reduce tumor size,</p>
<p>but rather that there&rsquo;s this possible link</p>
<p>between inflammation and immune exhaustion mechanisms</p>
<p>that if you can periodically relax a nervous system</p>
<p>here through stretching,</p>
<p>that it can affect certain pathways</p>
<p>related to the immune system</p>
<p>that would allow the immune system</p>
<p>to combat tumor growth to a significant degree.</p>
<p>So again, even though this is a study in mice,</p>
<p>it argues that relaxation induced by stretching</p>
<p>can have a powerful influence on mammary tumor growth.</p>
<p>Again, a huge effect carried out by one of the premier labs</p>
<p>and individuals who do this sort of work</p>
<p>and think about this sort of thing.</p>
<p>And of course, I want to point out,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just Dr. Langevin that did this study.</p>
<p>There are a number of coauthors on the study.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a link to the coauthors, excuse me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a link to the study</p>
<p>so that you can peruse it in more detail if you like.</p>
<p>Now, as a related and somewhat final point,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to return this up to this idea and this place,</p>
<p>this real estate within our brain</p>
<p>that we call the insular cortex, the insula.</p>
<p>As you recall, way back at the beginning of this episode,</p>
<p>we were talking about the von Economo neurons</p>
<p>that Konstantin von Economo,</p>
<p>the Austrian scientist discovered.</p>
<p>And the fact that we are able to make</p>
<p>and perform interpretations of our internal landscape,</p>
<p>our pain, our dedication to a practice.</p>
<p>For instance, whether or not we are in pain</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a practice that we are doing intentionally</p>
<p>and want to improve ourselves,</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s pain that&rsquo;s arriving</p>
<p>through some externally imposed demands or situations.</p>
<p>Well, the insula is handling all that.</p>
<p>And fortunately, there&rsquo;s a wonderful paper</p>
<p>that was published, it was a few years ago now,</p>
<p>in the journal Cerebral Cortex, which is a fine journal.</p>
<p>This is the year 2014,</p>
<p>entitled Insular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance</p>
<p>in Yoga Practitioners.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why I like this study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m personally not a practitioner of yoga.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a few yoga classes over the years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done some of the hot yoga classes.</p>
<p>Those rooms can get really, really warm, I confess.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done the kind of standard yoga every now and again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;ve kept up regularly.</p>
<p>This study explored the effects on brain structure volume</p>
<p>in yoga practitioners.</p>
<p>And for those of you out there that are aficionados in yoga,</p>
<p>they pulled subjects from having backgrounds in the,</p>
<p>here, I&rsquo;m probably going to mispronounce</p>
<p>these different things, and forgive me,</p>
<p>the vinyasa yogas, the ashtanga yogas,</p>
<p>the yonger yogas, the sananda yogas.</p>
<p>Okay, so some people were new to these practices,</p>
<p>some were experienced.</p>
<p>The important takeaways were that</p>
<p>they took these yoga practitioners</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t explore their brain structure</p>
<p>in the context of yoga itself.</p>
<p>They looked at things like pain tolerance.</p>
<p>So they used thermal stimulation.</p>
<p>Basically, they put people into conditions</p>
<p>where they gave them very hot or very cold stimuli</p>
<p>and compared those yoga practitioners</p>
<p>of varying levels of yoga experience</p>
<p>to those that had no experience with yoga,</p>
<p>so-called controls.</p>
<p>And they found some really interesting things.</p>
<p>There are a lot of data in this paper,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to highlight.</p>
<p>The pain tolerance of yoga practitioners</p>
<p>was double or more to that of non-yoga practitioners,</p>
<p>even for those that weren&rsquo;t doing</p>
<p>the so-called hot yoga, right?</p>
<p>They also found that pain tolerance</p>
<p>was significantly greater,</p>
<p>both for heat pain and for cold pain.</p>
<p>They also found significant increases in insular,</p>
<p>again, the insula, this brain region, gray matter volume.</p>
<p>Typically, when we talk about gray matter,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the so-called cell bodies,</p>
<p>the location in neurons where the genome is housed</p>
<p>and where all the housekeeping stuff is there.</p>
<p>And then white matter volume tends to be the axons,</p>
<p>the wires, because they&rsquo;re in sheaths</p>
<p>with this stuff that appears white in MRIs</p>
<p>and indeed is white under the microscope,</p>
<p>and indeed is white.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually lipid, which is myelin.</p>
<p>So increased gray matter volume of the insula</p>
<p>is a significant finding because what it suggests</p>
<p>is that people that are doing yoga</p>
<p>have an increased volume of these areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with interoceptive awareness</p>
<p>and for being able to make judgments about pain</p>
<p>and why one is experiencing pain,</p>
<p>not just to lean away from pain,</p>
<p>but to utilize or leverage or even overcome pain.</p>
<p>So there are many studies of yoga and meditation out there,</p>
<p>few that have as much mechanistic detail as this one.</p>
<p>And in fact, there&rsquo;s a beautiful figure,</p>
<p>figure three in this paper,</p>
<p>that shows that the gray matter volume</p>
<p>of this particular brain region</p>
<p>scales in an almost linear way</p>
<p>with the duration of yoga practice</p>
<p>that somebody has been taking on in years.</p>
<p>So people that had, they had a few subjects</p>
<p>that have up to 15 or 16 years of yoga practice</p>
<p>had much larger left insular gray matter volume,</p>
<p>bigger brain areas associated with these abilities.</p>
<p>And I find this interesting</p>
<p>because there are a lot of activities out there</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t create these kinds of changes in brain volume,</p>
<p>especially within the insula.</p>
<p>So it appears that it&rsquo;s not just the performance</p>
<p>of the yogic movements,</p>
<p>but the overcoming or the kind of pushing</p>
<p>into the end ranges of motion</p>
<p>and to push through discomfort to some extent.</p>
<p>Of course, we want people doing that in a healthy, safe way,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s allows yoga practitioners</p>
<p>to build up the structure and function of these brain areas</p>
<p>that allow them to cope with pain better</p>
<p>than other individuals</p>
<p>and to cope with other kinds of interoceptive challenges,</p>
<p>if you will, not just pain, but cold,</p>
<p>not just pain, but discomfort</p>
<p>of being in a particular position to do that.</p>
<p>And again, we wouldn&rsquo;t want people placing themselves</p>
<p>into a compromised position, literally,</p>
<p>that would harm them,</p>
<p>especially given that earlier we heard</p>
<p>that micro-stretching of the kind of non-painful sort,</p>
<p>low intensity sort is actually going to be more effective</p>
<p>for increasing end range of motion.</p>
<p>But this study really emphasized the extent</p>
<p>to which practitioners of yoga don&rsquo;t just learn movements,</p>
<p>they learn how to control their nervous system</p>
<p>in ways that really reshapes their relationship to pain,</p>
<p>to flexibility, and to the kinds of things</p>
<p>that the neuromuscular system was designed to do.</p>
<p>And as a final point,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a beautiful graph in this paper,</p>
<p>beautiful, I think, because it explores</p>
<p>some of the more subjective dimensions</p>
<p>of yoga and insular function, which is a,</p>
<p>here, I&rsquo;ll read it out in the nerdy form,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll explain what it means.</p>
<p>This is a frequency histogram</p>
<p>of categories of mental strategies used by yogis</p>
<p>versus controls during the cold pain tolerance task.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re describing here and showing is,</p>
<p>quantitatively, how people are conceptualizing cold pain</p>
<p>in order to get through it.</p>
<p>And the different categories are,</p>
<p>for instance, distraction, right?</p>
<p>Some people just choose to distract themselves from pain</p>
<p>or to attempt to, other people will try to ignore it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot like distraction,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, to engage in a negative emotion,</p>
<p>sort of like, I&rsquo;m going to be in resistance to this.</p>
<p>Control subjects tended to use those approaches,</p>
<p>whereas practitioners of yoga tended to use</p>
<p>other sorts of subjective approaches,</p>
<p>like positive imagery, to some extent,</p>
<p>the ability to relax despite the extreme cold,</p>
<p>the ability to quote-unquote accept,</p>
<p>this is just happening despite the extreme cold,</p>
<p>to observe, to third-person themselves.</p>
<p>And the greatest effect, of course, was to breathe,</p>
<p>to focus on their respiration as a way to deal</p>
<p>with this challenge, this cold challenge.</p>
<p>Now, all of that is our subjective data,</p>
<p>but I want to remind you that the practitioners of yoga</p>
<p>are not just using entirely different mental strategies,</p>
<p>but they are far more effective at dealing with pain.</p>
<p>Their pain tolerance is much higher,</p>
<p>as evidenced by the other data</p>
<p>in the previous graphs in the paper.</p>
<p>So while this podcast episode</p>
<p>is most certainly not about yoga per se,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about flexibility and stretching.</p>
<p>Flexibility and stretching are elements</p>
<p>within yogic practices.</p>
<p>And of course, yogic practices involve breathing</p>
<p>and mental work and a lot of other things,</p>
<p>balance, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vast landscape, as many of you know.</p>
<p>But I think that if ever there was a manuscript</p>
<p>that pointed to the utility of something like yoga</p>
<p>for sake of tapping into a particular set of brain circuits</p>
<p>and mechanisms that could wick out</p>
<p>into multiple dimensions of life,</p>
<p>so day-to-day life, stress,</p>
<p>challenges in dealing with all sorts of external stressors,</p>
<p>career-related, family-related,</p>
<p>relationally, et cetera, excuse me,</p>
<p>but as well for increasing range of motion,</p>
<p>for increasing flexibility.</p>
<p>So if ever there was a practice that one could embark on</p>
<p>that would not only increase flexibility</p>
<p>and limb range of motion,</p>
<p>but would also allow one to cultivate</p>
<p>some improved mental functioning</p>
<p>as it relates to pain tolerance</p>
<p>and other features of stress management</p>
<p>that no doubt wick out into other areas of life,</p>
<p>appears that yoga is a quite useful practice.</p>
<p>And so for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in increasing limb range of motion</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re already a practitioner of yoga, great.</p>
<p>I can imagine that someday there&rsquo;ll be another study</p>
<p>like this one, and you&rsquo;ll be in that 10 or 15</p>
<p>to 16-year practitioner graph.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be that dot way out on the far end of the graph</p>
<p>that shows that your insula is that much bigger</p>
<p>than the rest of ours,</p>
<p>and therefore your internal awareness and pain thresholds</p>
<p>and stress management will be that much better.</p>
<p>But of course, yoga isn&rsquo;t the only way</p>
<p>to increase limb range of motion and flexibility.</p>
<p>Up until now, we&rsquo;ve described a number</p>
<p>of different ways to do that,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve arrived at some general themes and protocols.</p>
<p>Again, those themes and protocols will be distilled</p>
<p>into some specific and precise list</p>
<p>in our Neural Network Newsletter,</p>
<p>but we can revisit a couple of them now</p>
<p>just in summary and synthesis.</p>
<p>Static stretching appears to be at least</p>
<p>among the more useful forms of stretching.</p>
<p>So low or zero momentum stretching,</p>
<p>typically at end range of motion.</p>
<p>I love this concept of micro stretching,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s just a couple of studies</p>
<p>that have addressed whether or not high intensity</p>
<p>or low intensity static stretch holds are more beneficial.</p>
<p>The idea, and indeed the data that low intensity,</p>
<p>so 30 to 40% of what one would consider painful</p>
<p>appears to be more effective than 80% of that threshold.</p>
<p>I find that incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this idea of frequency.</p>
<p>It really does appear that getting</p>
<p>at least five minutes per week total of stretching</p>
<p>for a given muscle group is important</p>
<p>for creating meaningful lasting changes</p>
<p>in limb range of motion.</p>
<p>And that is best achieved by five day a week</p>
<p>or six day a week, or even seven day a week protocols,</p>
<p>but those can be very short protocols</p>
<p>limited to say three sets of 30,</p>
<p>maybe even 45 or 60 seconds of static hold.</p>
<p>Although 30 seconds seems to be a key threshold there</p>
<p>that can get you maximum benefit.</p>
<p>There is no need to do full 60 second holds</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing fewer total sessions per week.</p>
<p>And of course, to always warm up</p>
<p>or to arrive at the stretching session warm.</p>
<p>And then of course, there are the other forms of stretching</p>
<p>that we touched upon a bit, things like PNF.</p>
<p>And we talked about why PNF works,</p>
<p>things like the spindle and the Golgi tendon organ reflexes</p>
<p>that are built into all of us</p>
<p>that we arrive in this world with.</p>
<p>And of course, the other forms of stretching</p>
<p>that are known to be effective and important,</p>
<p>such as dynamic and ballistic stretching.</p>
<p>Again, stretching protocols that involve a lot of momentum</p>
<p>in order to improve range of motion</p>
<p>for performance of particular types of work</p>
<p>that one is about to embark on.</p>
<p>Typically that would be physical work,</p>
<p>but a whole interesting and unexplored landscape</p>
<p>is the extent to which changing limb range of motion</p>
<p>and different types of body movement</p>
<p>actually shape our cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>And that will be the topic</p>
<p>of a future episode of this podcast.</p>

<p>Not so much on today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>but in many episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>we talk about supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like improving the transition time</p>
<p>and depth of sleep, or for improving focus,</p>
<p>or for a variety of other things,</p>
<p>including things like anxiety management.</p>
<p>For that reason, the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>has decided to partner with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>First of all, Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>are of the very highest quality.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used by various professional sports teams,</p>
<p>and they have contracts</p>
<p>with various government organizations</p>
<p>exploring the role of particular supplements</p>
<p>in human performance.</p>
<p>Second of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know a number of you</p>
<p>are outside the country of the United States.</p>
<p>We hope that will be useful to you.</p>
<p>As well, we wanted to have a single location</p>
<p>where people could go to access</p>
<p>the most often discussed supplements</p>
<p>here on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>So while the full catalog of those supplements</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t quite available yet, many of them are available.</p>
<p>You can find them by going to livemomentus.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to find supplements for sleep,</p>
<p>for recovery from exercise, for focus,</p>
<p>and many other features that impact mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following Huberman Lab</p>
<p>on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.</p>
<p>At both places, I describe science</p>
<p>and science-related tools that relate</p>
<p>to some of the themes covered here</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but oftentimes I&rsquo;ll do posts</p>
<p>that include information and tools</p>
<p>not detailed here on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>We also have a newsletter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned this a few times during today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>It is the Neural Network Newsletter.</p>
<p>You can access that newsletter completely zero of cost</p>
<p>by going to HubermanLab.com.</p>
<p>Go to the menu and sign up for our newsletter.</p>
<p>You supply your email.</p>
<p>We do not share your email with anybody else.</p>
<p>We have a very clear privacy policy</p>
<p>that you can find there.</p>
<p>If you want to see examples of previous newsletters,</p>
<p>you can find them there without having to sign up.</p>
<p>Again, that Neural Network Newsletter</p>
<p>comes out about once a month,</p>
<p>and we use it to distill out essential protocols</p>
<p>from the podcast, to synthesize information</p>
<p>from the podcast.</p>
<p>We do believe many people find them useful.</p>
<p>So sign up for the Neural Network Newsletter</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
<p>So thank you once again for joining me today</p>
<p>for a discussion about the neural, and neuromuscular,</p>
<p>and connective tissue, and skeletal aspects</p>
<p>of flexibility and stretching.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
