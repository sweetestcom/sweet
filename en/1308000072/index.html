    <p>Dude, Sax, I love that look.</p>
<p>Look at that shirt.</p>
<p>Look at that, man.</p>
<p>Is it too noisy for a podcast?</p>
<p>No, you look very relatable.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like an American man, just like at home doing stuff.</p>
<p>Is he trying to go full Tucker on us?</p>
<p>It is a really, really horrendous shirt that you&rsquo;re wearing.</p>
<p>That is a horrible, I mean,</p>
<p>that was the same shirt Tucker was wearing last week.</p>
<p>Oh my God, Sax is gonna be so appealing</p>
<p>to middle America right now, he&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Absolutely, look, he&rsquo;s going for the everyman.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s an everyman.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have a blazer on.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to get the purple pills.</p>
<p>Are you gonna go chop wood with Tucker?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I may not be a man of the people,</p>
<p>but I do try to be a man for the people.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in to let your winners ride ‚ô™</p>
<p>Rain Man David Saxon.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in and instead we open sources to the fans ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ And they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it, love you guys. ‚ô™</p>
<p>Ice Queen of Kinwan.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in. ‚ô™</p>
<p>Hey everybody, welcome to another episode</p>
<p>of the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously been an intense week</p>
<p>and there is a topic,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really only one topic to talk about this week</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the Russian invasion of the Ukraine.</p>
<p>With me to break all this down,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take it from a couple of different angles.</p>
<p>The rain man, David Sax with his power flannel on today.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna go chop some wood after this,</p>
<p>trying to appeal to the everyman.</p>
<p>Power flannel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a power flannel, it&rsquo;s a power flannel.</p>
<p>I think that was gifted by Tucker.</p>
<p>And the sultan of science, hot off the-</p>
<p>How do you know it&rsquo;s a flannel instead of a cashmere?</p>
<p>How do you know it didn&rsquo;t come from one of Chamath&rsquo;s little-</p>
<p>Chamath would never wear that shirt.</p>
<p>If you sent that shirt to Chamath, he&rsquo;d burn it.</p>
<p>That would go right in his pizza oven.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t burn it, but I would wipe my butt with it.</p>
<p>Here we go, folks.</p>
<p>And hot off the launch of the Cannabeverage printer,</p>
<p>replicator, the sultan of science himself, David Freeburg.</p>
<p>And back from a little holiday.</p>
<p>The dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya,</p>
<p>with a Jedi robe.</p>
<p>Tell us about the Jedi robe that you elected for this week,</p>
<p>Darth Palpatiya.</p>
<p>Well, this is-</p>
<p>Darth Palpatine Hapitiya.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, this is, look, this is, yes, it is cashmere.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re running out of time.</p>
<p>I have to wear it through the rest of my few garments,</p>
<p>my new garments, before it&rsquo;s springtime.</p>
<p>And then I have to go to the, you know,</p>
<p>the linen and the cotton.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re enjoying the final days of cashmere.</p>
<p>Well, I do, I did find some baby cashmere.</p>
<p>Light, thin, you know,</p>
<p>you can wear them probably until April, maybe even May.</p>
<p>So we have that going for us.</p>
<p>All right, well, there you go.</p>
<p>And is there a specific date that you shift over</p>
<p>from, to the linens and-</p>
<p>To be honest with you, I have a,</p>
<p>I have a team I consult with.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>The team&rsquo;s working on that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working on that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working on a recommendation.</p>
<p>All right, so we can still laugh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hard to talk about other topics</p>
<p>when a war has broken out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I have to go too deep</p>
<p>into recapping what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>because it is a static situation.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s been massive fallout from the war,</p>
<p>both economically, lives lost,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s escalated pretty dramatically.</p>
<p>We had a pretty crazy moment last night.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taping this on Friday.</p>
<p>March 4th, last night, a nuclear facility,</p>
<p>the largest one in Europe, was involved in a firefight.</p>
<p>It seems to have been secured</p>
<p>and the Russians have taken control of it,</p>
<p>but there were people bombing it.</p>
<p>Where to begin here?</p>
<p>I think maybe, Sax, you can start us off</p>
<p>with a little bit of your assessment</p>
<p>of the situation as it stands in week two.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, when we broke up last week,</p>
<p>this war was just breaking out</p>
<p>and we were still talking about ways</p>
<p>that we might defuse it.</p>
<p>Obviously, that was too late.</p>
<p>And I think everybody, probably Putin first and foremost,</p>
<p>felt this would be a cakewalk</p>
<p>and it has turned out not to be.</p>
<p>The resistance by the Ukrainians has been fierce</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been sort of galvanized by their leader, Zelensky.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of the hostilities,</p>
<p>he made the decision to stay and fight.</p>
<p>He had that video that came out</p>
<p>with his cabinet standing behind him.</p>
<p>That galvanized all the people of Ukraine</p>
<p>to stand behind them.</p>
<p>And then the West now wants to stand behind</p>
<p>the whole country of Ukraine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really been amazing leadership</p>
<p>by Zelensky and it&rsquo;s too bad in a way</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have that kind of leadership among our allies</p>
<p>in say Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We had this guy Ghani who got in the first helicopter</p>
<p>out of there when the trouble started.</p>
<p>So his leadership has been strong and admirable</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically galvanized the West.</p>
<p>And I think that Putin, I think must have underestimated</p>
<p>the level of resistance he would face</p>
<p>and also the unity of the West in terms of sanctioning him.</p>
<p>And providing support for the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>All that being said,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re now at a very dangerous sort of crossroads</p>
<p>because the situation is very volatile</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got so much variance</p>
<p>in the outcomes that can occur now.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re seeing people prognosticate everything</p>
<p>from Kiev gets turned to rubble in the next week</p>
<p>and the Russians basically power through and win</p>
<p>to this turns into a long-term insurgency</p>
<p>to there&rsquo;s gonna be some sort of uprising in Moscow</p>
<p>and regime change there.</p>
<p>And I think because the variance is so high,</p>
<p>because the two sides are playing for all the marbles,</p>
<p>so to speak, and you&rsquo;ve even got, I think,</p>
<p>intemperate and insane remarks by Lindsey Graham</p>
<p>basically calling for Putin&rsquo;s ouster,</p>
<p>which I think is gonna give-</p>
<p>I mean that quote just to pause there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna give the Kremlin,</p>
<p>I think a propaganda tool,</p>
<p>but for rallying people internally.</p>
<p>But the point is just,</p>
<p>it seems like we&rsquo;re playing for all the marbles right now.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a very dangerous place to be.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m seeing insane rhetoric and commentary</p>
<p>by people trying to push us into war.</p>
<p>And so just the other day,</p>
<p>one of the things I tweeted about</p>
<p>is one of the craziest things you hear</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re already in World War III.</p>
<p>Well, Kasparov said this,</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s kind of known to be a little bit of a hothead,</p>
<p>but you also had Fiona Hill,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s supposed to be a Russia expert</p>
<p>from the State Department,</p>
<p>who frequently is the go-to source</p>
<p>for CNN and other publications,</p>
<p>also saying we&rsquo;re already in World War III.</p>
<p>Well, no, we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I mean, if we were in World War III,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d see the mushroom clouds,</p>
<p>assuming you were still alive and not vaporized.</p>
<p>So it is incredibly reckless</p>
<p>for people to be saying things like this.</p>
<p>And there is just this drumbeat of war</p>
<p>that is being pushed by cable news</p>
<p>and by the Twittersphere.</p>
<p>And just today, thankfully this morning,</p>
<p>NATO announced that it would not be imposing</p>
<p>a no-fly zone over Ukraine.</p>
<p>That was another-</p>
<p>And why is that important?</p>
<p>Explain that.</p>
<p>Well, because there&rsquo;s all these people who are saying,</p>
<p>well, we shouldn&rsquo;t send boots on the ground to Ukraine.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to get militarily involved,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s do a no-fly zone</p>
<p>to basically help the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>The problem with that is-</p>
<p>Yeah, how do you enforce that?</p>
<p>What a no-fly zone means</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re gonna shoot down Russian planes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You are going to war.</p>
<p>It may not be boots on the ground,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s boots in the sky.</p>
<p>So had we done that,</p>
<p>had we given into the emotional appeals,</p>
<p>and I think we all feel the tug on our heartstrings,</p>
<p>but had we given into that,</p>
<p>we would be potentially in a shooting war with Russia.</p>
<p>And that would be the most serious-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already in, I think,</p>
<p>the most serious foreign policy situation in my lifetime,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m almost half a century old.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s very dangerous.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ve been saying for the last month</p>
<p>on this podcast, I&rsquo;ve been actually advocating</p>
<p>for the cause of not getting militarily involved.</p>
<p>And a month ago,</p>
<p>it seemed like an argument I didn&rsquo;t need to make.</p>
<p>But now it really does,</p>
<p>because both sides are sort of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost a unanimity in Washington</p>
<p>that we need to continue escalating the situation.</p>
<p>Sax, my concern is less about the Washington intent</p>
<p>to put boots on the ground or boots in the sky.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m much more concerned about NATO allies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 30 member nations in NATO.</p>
<p>And if any one of them does something stupid,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s any action by any even rogue element</p>
<p>within the military or some statement,</p>
<p>even by some politician, some NATO member,</p>
<p>you know, you could see a reaction potentially from Putin.</p>
<p>And then Article 5 kicks in,</p>
<p>which is this collective defense article in NATO.</p>
<p>And then the United States has an obligation</p>
<p>to enter the conflict.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the one scenario you didn&rsquo;t mention,</p>
<p>which is the scenario I am most concerned about,</p>
<p>most frightened by,</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t know when or if a Franz Ferdinand moment</p>
<p>could occur here.</p>
<p>That someone does something stupid,</p>
<p>some Polish tank rolls across the border</p>
<p>and shoots down some,</p>
<p>shoots at some Russian, you know, tank,</p>
<p>and then the Russian tank crosses over.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to go to the rescue</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got to go defend that NATO member.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden,</p>
<p>this whole thing sparks into a wildfire.</p>
<p>It felt like last night could have been that</p>
<p>when you look at the fog of war,</p>
<p>you know, it was basically this nuclear reactor,</p>
<p>if it explodes, if it has, you know,</p>
<p>an episode would do just tremendous damage</p>
<p>to the whole continent.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re living in a NATO country or in Moscow,</p>
<p>if that thing had gone up,</p>
<p>which I know is a very,</p>
<p>would be a rare occurrence</p>
<p>and they were shutting it down, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, but there was that rumor last night,</p>
<p>it felt like there could be a tipping point.</p>
<p>Nuclear material is like a whole nother level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it has nothing to do with war at that point.</p>
<p>It has to do with extinction.</p>
<p>You know, a nuclear reactor</p>
<p>is almost like a temple on earth to God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this holiest of holies.</p>
<p>No one can, should, or ever could consider that</p>
<p>to be a point in conflict ever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing should be touched,</p>
<p>let the wars of humans continue</p>
<p>on the rest of the earth surface.</p>
<p>But nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unleashing the fury of the gods on Olympus.</p>
<p>And when they come down,</p>
<p>they scorch the earth and nuclear material,</p>
<p>you know, is an extinction kind of,</p>
<p>or is, you know, kind of a cataclysmic event</p>
<p>for this planet.</p>
<p>And so, you know, that goes well beyond this idea of like,</p>
<p>is it NATO or did someone shoot at someone?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all go fight.</p>
<p>It becomes like almost existential</p>
<p>to the condition of humans.</p>
<p>Well, so what does that say about Putin then?</p>
<p>I mean, Putin targeted that facility.</p>
<p>No, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Hold on, I think that&rsquo;s fake news at this point.</p>
<p>Do you see the tweet by Michael Schellenberger?</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>You said this is Fog of War.</p>
<p>Last night&rsquo;s tweet, I did see last night&rsquo;s tweet.</p>
<p>Okay, so I don&rsquo;t necessarily think this is Fog of War.</p>
<p>I think this might be disinformation.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what happened is,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t just misreporting.</p>
<p>Zelensky tweeted out a video</p>
<p>where he basically was saying,</p>
<p>this plant has been attacked, it&rsquo;s on fire,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be Chernobyl times 10 for all of Europe.</p>
<p>And then the foreign minister of Ukraine</p>
<p>came out with another statement</p>
<p>just like that simultaneously.</p>
<p>So this was coordinated.</p>
<p>And then I saw on all the cable news networks, all of them,</p>
<p>there was no difference between Fox and CNN, MSNBC,</p>
<p>same reporting, they were all in a panic about this.</p>
<p>And then we find out very quickly the truth,</p>
<p>which was confirmed by the White House,</p>
<p>which is no radiation, no explosion.</p>
<p>The fire was sort of tangential.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t core to the plant.</p>
<p>So I think we have to be very careful now</p>
<p>to guard ourselves against disinformation</p>
<p>that is designed, frankly, to escalate the situation</p>
<p>and pull us to draw us into a war.</p>
<p>Simultaneous with this,</p>
<p>there was a New York Times op-ed by Zelensky</p>
<p>and one of his aides who was standing next to him</p>
<p>sort of transcribing,</p>
<p>and the headline was something like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fighting to the last breath.</p>
<p>Look, that is heroic.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we can all recognize Zelensky&rsquo;s bravery</p>
<p>and courage in doing that.</p>
<p>However, the point of that article</p>
<p>was to tug on our heartstrings,</p>
<p>to get us to involved in the war.</p>
<p>And what he said in that article was,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to send boots on the ground,</p>
<p>but impose the no-fly zone,</p>
<p>which we just talked about is a declaration of war.</p>
<p>Yeah, but no, no,</p>
<p>what I was talking about with the nuclear power plant</p>
<p>is not that it wasn&rsquo;t being hyped up by the media,</p>
<p>certainly like this was becoming like their ratings bonanza,</p>
<p>and they were definitely hyping it up.</p>
<p>And maybe Zelensky was giving a warning,</p>
<p>hey, this could escalate.</p>
<p>But the Russians did target that.</p>
<p>They were bombing around it.</p>
<p>They were firefighting.</p>
<p>So to Freeberg&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>this is, I think, crazy behavior by Russian troops,</p>
<p>by Putin to actually try to seize a nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>It seems pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Chamath, you&rsquo;ve been silent thus far.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get Chamath involved here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a 17th century phrase that says,</p>
<p>adversity makes for strange bedfellows.</p>
<p>And I think what happens</p>
<p>when you are in the middle of enormous adversity,</p>
<p>you need to do whatever it takes to win, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, why Zelensky is so patriotic</p>
<p>and viewed so heroically around the world now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to defend his country and his people.</p>
<p>I wanna take the counter of, David, what you said.</p>
<p>I actually think we are at war,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the most positive form of it</p>
<p>in the sense that we are learning</p>
<p>a different kind of warfare.</p>
<p>Now, if you think about how we used to fight</p>
<p>up until basically the Persian Gulf War,</p>
<p>it was armaments and tanks.</p>
<p>And then that evolved in the Middle East</p>
<p>because we had to fight insurgents</p>
<p>and urban terrorism in many ways, right?</p>
<p>I think this is a way in which we are learning</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a different kind of warfare as well,</p>
<p>which is fundamentally economic.</p>
<p>And so it may not take the same shape</p>
<p>as drones and missiles and fire and guns and bullets,</p>
<p>but I think you would be foolish to make the mistake</p>
<p>that we are now not at economic war with Russia.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, the outcome is the same,</p>
<p>which is either they survive or they don&rsquo;t survive.</p>
<p>And everything we&rsquo;ve done points to</p>
<p>that we are willing to fight,</p>
<p>and we are willing to put a lot of economic collateral</p>
<p>and chips on the field in order to win this battle.</p>
<p>So I think in that respect, we are kind of at war.</p>
<p>Did we, are we on, is this a nuclear level</p>
<p>economic decoupling?</p>
<p>But this is my point,</p>
<p>is like everybody has a historical framework</p>
<p>where they want to go back</p>
<p>to how the natural path of escalation works.</p>
<p>And I think this is a very different form of escalation</p>
<p>that we need to consider.</p>
<p>And I think that this is the kind of warfare</p>
<p>that may actually, you know,</p>
<p>be the way in which wars are fought in the future.</p>
<p>You seize assets, you shut off access to supply routes,</p>
<p>you make it impossible for anything to work.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;ll give you a simple example.</p>
<p>A form of warfare is what&rsquo;s happening right now</p>
<p>in the sense that, you know, for example,</p>
<p>the Russian skies are completely clear,</p>
<p>not just because that, you know,</p>
<p>no external airlines will necessarily fly there,</p>
<p>but because Boeing and Rolls Royce and GE and Airbus</p>
<p>basically pulled all of their support,</p>
<p>all of their parts, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone to war with respect to their petroleum</p>
<p>and LNG supplies, how?</p>
<p>Not necessarily because we won&rsquo;t still stop payments,</p>
<p>which we are still enabling,</p>
<p>but because the actual refiners won&rsquo;t take the oil</p>
<p>and the LNG,</p>
<p>because they then would be subject to sanctions.</p>
<p>The people who would ship that</p>
<p>are no longer taking those payments</p>
<p>or those barrels of oil into the marketplace</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t get insured by international banks.</p>
<p>So in all of these various ways, we are actually at war.</p>
<p>And I think, you know,</p>
<p>maybe this is the way war should be fought in the future</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll save thousands of lives</p>
<p>in the more classic way of describing</p>
<p>how lives are sacrificed for.</p>
<p>I want to make a counterpoint.</p>
<p>My concern, Chamath,</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve rushed into a reactive response</p>
<p>with respect to sanctions and seizing assets</p>
<p>in a way that may be not be calculated over the long run.</p>
<p>Meaning like, are we setting ourselves up</p>
<p>for another Iraq, Afghanistan situation</p>
<p>where we rush into a war</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have an exit strategy?</p>
<p>And the issue is that a lot of the assets</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve effectively wiped the value down to zero</p>
<p>have a repercussive effect on global businesses</p>
<p>and the global economy.</p>
<p>As an example, you know,</p>
<p>this company that we were texting about called Luke Oil,</p>
<p>they were worth $60 billion a few days ago.</p>
<p>We effectively wiped them out to zero.</p>
<p>And 65 to 70% of the shares in that company</p>
<p>were held and owned by public retirement funds,</p>
<p>pension funds, mutual funds</p>
<p>that are used for retirees in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>And so, you know, a significant amount of-</p>
<p>I think this is a complete red herring.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told you this in the private chat.</p>
<p>I think this is a complete, complete red herring.</p>
<p>And the reason it&rsquo;s a red herring</p>
<p>is that the global total market cap</p>
<p>of all of these businesses</p>
<p>is meaningfully different than the amount of total capex</p>
<p>that these guys represent.</p>
<p>And in as much as you are going to take the equity values</p>
<p>of certain of these companies to zero,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the grand scheme of things,</p>
<p>not that much equity value.</p>
<p>We can absorb it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>Forget about the equity value.</p>
<p>Just think about the economic repercussions</p>
<p>where there is leveraged positions</p>
<p>and swaps and derivatives in place,</p>
<p>counterparty swaps in place with a lot of these companies</p>
<p>that are now going to default.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not going to know that till the end of this month</p>
<p>when everything has to settle</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s going to be able to make their payments.</p>
<p>Small price to pay, Friedberg.</p>
<p>Well, hold on one sec.</p>
<p>This applies both to Russian companies</p>
<p>that are suppliers and buyers of assets,</p>
<p>products and services from international businesses.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden that line item just zeros out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the economic value of all of that oil</p>
<p>exceeds the market cap of luke oil.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe further</p>
<p>that the economic value that&rsquo;s held by non-Russian actors</p>
<p>is meaningfully more than a few 10s of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to find out pretty quick.</p>
<p>By the way, Russia and the Ukraine combined</p>
<p>account for roughly 25% of global wheat exports.</p>
<p>Let me say it differently.</p>
<p>That wheat goes to Egypt</p>
<p>and from Egypt it goes throughout Africa.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of nations and a lot of people</p>
<p>that depend on that food supply.</p>
<p>And that food supply is now cut off.</p>
<p>Okay, I understand.</p>
<p>But now we were talking about something different.</p>
<p>You want to talk about wheat, we can talk about wheat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just talking about generally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about zeroing all this stuff out</p>
<p>and cutting them off completely.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>One of the things you have to realize, Friedberg,</p>
<p>is that the purpose of sanctions</p>
<p>is to create massive pain that stops a madman dictator</p>
<p>from invading other countries and causing a world war.</p>
<p>So while it is tragic that some pension,</p>
<p>hold on, let me finish, Friedberg.</p>
<p>While it is tragic that people will suffer</p>
<p>and people maybe can&rsquo;t get their Netflix</p>
<p>or can&rsquo;t get their Facebook</p>
<p>or some wheat will get disrupted,</p>
<p>all of this is the better choice</p>
<p>than going to war with Putin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s meant to create pain and suffering.</p>
<p>It does not create pain and suffering,</p>
<p>then Russia will not change.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point of sanctions.</p>
<p>Jake, I totally get it.</p>
<p>I totally understand the intent.</p>
<p>And I totally understand the point.</p>
<p>My point is, have we really done the calculus?</p>
<p>Because when you make this much of an impact this fast,</p>
<p>when you rush into what we might call an economic war,</p>
<p>with such significant abrasion</p>
<p>in such a significantly short period of time,</p>
<p>do we really have a sense of where the calculus is?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know where the wheat imports</p>
<p>are gonna come from for Egypt now.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know where the millions of people</p>
<p>that depend on that wheat supply</p>
<p>are now gonna get fed from.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we have an answer.</p>
<p>If we had a strategy that said, here&rsquo;s the solution,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the solution from an energy perspective,</p>
<p>from a food perspective, from a capital perspective,</p>
<p>to fill all these holes.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we may all end up sharing that cost</p>
<p>over the long run.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna be a big cost to bear.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And the reason why I think you&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ve already seen how this has played out before.</p>
<p>In the last two years,</p>
<p>we learned what governments are willing to do</p>
<p>when you have supply shocks and demand shocks.</p>
<p>And what they do is they turn on the money printer</p>
<p>and they create enormous amounts of stimulus.</p>
<p>And what we have now is a point</p>
<p>where if these shocks are really, really,</p>
<p>really meaningful globally,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to see the Federal Reserve</p>
<p>and the ECB and the Bank of Canada</p>
<p>and the Bank of Japan step in in a very coordinated way</p>
<p>to provide liquidity to these markets.</p>
<p>And I think what that has the byproduct of doing</p>
<p>is blunting the economic consequences to everybody</p>
<p>but the person who is sanctioned.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s inflationary as well?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And the other thing, in fact, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>Look, David and I have been the ones that said</p>
<p>the risk is to a recession.</p>
<p>We are now teetering towards a recession.</p>
<p>Nick, you should throw this thing</p>
<p>that I sent to you guys before.</p>
<p>If you look back over the last 30 or 40 or 50 years</p>
<p>and you look at every single period</p>
<p>of when there has been a recession,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting to note is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not always been the case</p>
<p>that the price of energy has risen by 50% in a recession.</p>
<p>But it is always the case</p>
<p>that when energy prices spike by 50%, we enter a recession.</p>
<p>We will contract as an economy.</p>
<p>The government will have to become more accommodating.</p>
<p>That is the price of this economic war</p>
<p>that we have started.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a just price</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s happening is not supportable.</p>
<p>So, Tamar, you are sure that we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>or you feel strongly that we&rsquo;re not entering</p>
<p>into a condition of significant stagflation</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re not able to re-stimulate the economy</p>
<p>and we inflate everything with all this money printing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what stagflation is</p>
<p>to be completely honest with you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen it.</p>
<p>I know how it&rsquo;s classically described.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like pseudo-intellectual</p>
<p>kind of gobbledygook speak.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is,</p>
<p>I think that prices are too high</p>
<p>in certain core commodities and goods.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s gonna happen is we are going to find a way</p>
<p>to subsidize those prices coming down.</p>
<p>And I think the simplest way to do it</p>
<p>is for the government to step in and become a buffer.</p>
<p>And it will drive massive deficits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll drive increasing amounts of debt.</p>
<p>But I think that is a simple way for us</p>
<p>to make sure we put and ratchet the pressure.</p>
<p>And just to speak on this other point,</p>
<p>we have only just begun.</p>
<p>Meaning just today as we started the pod,</p>
<p>Biden came out with an incremental new set of sanctions</p>
<p>on Russian crude.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not at the, even in the beginning,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at the beginning of the beginning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just worried this is a new kind of nuclear war.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s frightening.</p>
<p>If this is the new nuclear war,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s a blessing</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not gonna have millions of people die.</p>
<p>Sachs, are the sanctions just right?</p>
<p>Too strong, too little?</p>
<p>I think vis-a-vis like versus going to war.</p>
<p>I think what Freeberg&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re on an escalatory path here</p>
<p>that starts with sanctions,</p>
<p>then leads to more and more sanctions,</p>
<p>then includes arming the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>And on and on it goes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big leap.</p>
<p>And I think-</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re already arming them.</p>
<p>Germans gave the Ukrainians Javelin missiles last week.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s true, sorry.</p>
<p>I know, absolutely.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot more coming.</p>
<p>So, you know, what I would say is,</p>
<p>back to something Jamal said,</p>
<p>which is we&rsquo;re already at war.</p>
<p>I, you know, call me a non-binary,</p>
<p>call me a non-binary thinker,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t like dividing our options</p>
<p>in that simply into war and peace.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s like a spectrum here.</p>
<p>And you could call that spectrum an escalatory path.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s sanctions, there&rsquo;s arming them,</p>
<p>and so on down the line.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like characterizing what we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>or what we&rsquo;re doing as war</p>
<p>because once you&rsquo;re in war,</p>
<p>then it justifies anything.</p>
<p>And for the other side too.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re such a pacifist, Sax.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>Look, we have to remember-</p>
<p>Wait, no, let me just clarify what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me just wait.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re at war.</p>
<p>I said we&rsquo;re at a form of a war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an economic war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a different kind of-</p>
<p>Well, I hope it stays economic then.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t like using that metaphor,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s not debate semantics.</p>
<p>But to Jason&rsquo;s point, am I a pacifist?</p>
<p>What I would say is, you know, during the Cold War,</p>
<p>we have to remember that this philosophy of containment</p>
<p>that we had,</p>
<p>the goal was to prevent the spread of communism</p>
<p>while conceding that the countries</p>
<p>that were already communist,</p>
<p>that were behind the Iron Curtain,</p>
<p>we would not challenge.</p>
<p>We would not seek to roll that back.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we did not want hot war with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And everything was calibrated to make sure</p>
<p>that we did not blunder ourselves into nuclear wars,</p>
<p>mutually assured destruction.</p>
<p>And yet it almost happened anyway,</p>
<p>most notably with the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
<p>But rules of the game evolved, right?</p>
<p>And so we did things like arm the Mujahideen rebels</p>
<p>in Afghanistan with Stinger missiles.</p>
<p>So that would be sort of the equivalent of the Javelins.</p>
<p>But we sure as hell didn&rsquo;t put the American flag</p>
<p>or a NATO flag on the boxes</p>
<p>and on the trucks delivering those weapons.</p>
<p>We delivered them through Pakistan, through intermediaries.</p>
<p>There were rules of the game that we all understood.</p>
<p>Now, I hope we are following similar rules,</p>
<p>but it feels to me like we are.</p>
<p>And I think one good thing is that both Biden</p>
<p>and certainly Putin remember the Cold War.</p>
<p>They were very involved in the Cold War.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re old enough to remember it.</p>
<p>And hopefully we remember those rules.</p>
<p>The most encouraging thing I&rsquo;ve heard Biden say</p>
<p>this entire time was when he reiterated</p>
<p>at the State of the Union</p>
<p>that we would not get militarily involved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important that he keeps saying that</p>
<p>because the Russians are looking at these statements.</p>
<p>So we just have to remember that, again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on this escalatory path.</p>
<p>And one of the things that&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>is a purity spiral.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a social media version of this,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like a partisan version of this.</p>
<p>So the social media version of this</p>
<p>is that the way that you show</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re on the side of the good of Ukraine</p>
<p>is you advocate for the no-fly zone.</p>
<p>You advocate for the escalation.</p>
<p>But if you advocate for slowing down or deescalating</p>
<p>or just taking a breath,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re called a Putin bootlicker.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re called Neville Chamberlain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already gotten about a thousand reply tweets</p>
<p>coming at me saying that.</p>
<p>So the purity spiral on Twitter</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve seen in so many other contexts now</p>
<p>pushes everybody into World War III.</p>
<p>Similarly, there&rsquo;s a partisan dynamic</p>
<p>where no matter what Biden says or does,</p>
<p>no matter what new sanctions he imposes,</p>
<p>the Republicans will always announce him for weakness.</p>
<p>And the media and Fox News</p>
<p>will always announce him for weakness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a one-way ratchet.</p>
<p>How much more do you want him to do is the question.</p>
<p>And I think Freeberg asked a great question,</p>
<p>which is, what is the end game here?</p>
<p>What are we trying to accomplish?</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m worried about is the dynamic,</p>
<p>this frenzy that, what Balaji has called</p>
<p>the chimp frenzy of social media, right?</p>
<p>With cable news and now social media and partisan rhetoric,</p>
<p>it all pushes us towards continual escalation</p>
<p>at World War III.</p>
<p>And who are gonna be the grownups who say,</p>
<p>listen, this is foolish, stand down, take a breath.</p>
<p>By the way, we might wanna keep</p>
<p>some of these cards in reserve.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to play every single thing right now.</p>
<p>To your point, I saw Lady G trending.</p>
<p>I guess this is his nickname.</p>
<p>But Lindsey Graham literally explicitly said</p>
<p>somebody in Russia needs to assassinate Putin.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a crazy escalation.</p>
<p>And then on the other side, inside the,</p>
<p>you have people saying, Putin&rsquo;s a genius.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>We are gonna continue to ratchet up</p>
<p>these economic sanctions, guys.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the beginning</p>
<p>of the economic sanctions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not even in the middle of them.</p>
<p>What do you think he&rsquo;s gonna do, Chamath?</p>
<p>What is the exit ramp for Putin if we keep doing this</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s in a corner?</p>
<p>I have no idea, but I think that it&rsquo;s clear,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty plain as day if you&rsquo;re going to be unemotional</p>
<p>and just look at this from the American</p>
<p>and European perspective, which is the only end game now</p>
<p>is regime change, right?</p>
<p>And one step before regime change</p>
<p>is a complete sort of detente and somehow</p>
<p>surrender by Putin in the sense</p>
<p>that he pulls back from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Not if 70% of his people support him,</p>
<p>which is what a polling figure showed this morning, right?</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Be careful with those polls.</p>
<p>I mean, people in Russia are not exactly gonna say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m anti-Putin in a survey.</p>
<p>Well, J. Cal, I mean, look, you can say that</p>
<p>to kind of defend what you believe about-</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not saying it to defend what I believe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it pragmatically.</p>
<p>Just suspend it and assume for a moment</p>
<p>that maybe that is the position of those people.</p>
<p>Maybe they do believe in pride of nation,</p>
<p>like the United States would believe in pride of nation.</p>
<p>If we were attacked,</p>
<p>if everyone took economic sanctions against our country,</p>
<p>would we not stand up and defend our president</p>
<p>and our nation and say that our country</p>
<p>is the prime country and our way of living</p>
<p>and our life and we should be left alone?</p>
<p>This is not an issue for the world to get involved in.</p>
<p>Okay, but let&rsquo;s clean this up.</p>
<p>And so how do you end up, assume that is the case,</p>
<p>how do you end up having a regime change</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have a country that&rsquo;s actually in revolt,</p>
<p>but you have a country-</p>
<p>I have no idea, but let&rsquo;s play this out.</p>
<p>Like, look, let&rsquo;s just say-</p>
<p>Where people are rallying for what this guy is doing</p>
<p>if that is the case, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move our conversation to exit ramps.</p>
<p>From where we are, there&rsquo;s two options, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two options.</p>
<p>Option one is Ukraine successfully defends itself, right?</p>
<p>And option two is Russia, quote unquote, wins, okay?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just go down that branch for one second.</p>
<p>Before they settle, there&rsquo;s a third one, Jamal.</p>
<p>They come to a peace treaty,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s happened previously.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s a third, and then there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I guess what you&rsquo;re saying, Jason,</p>
<p>is like everybody just kind of stops</p>
<p>where they are in place.</p>
<p>Yes, they do a peace treaty.</p>
<p>They give them the east of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s play it.</p>
<p>So then what happens to all of these economic sanctions?</p>
<p>Are they undone?</p>
<p>That would be part of the negotiation, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe undone based on conditions?</p>
<p>The question is, are their reparations paid</p>
<p>one way or the other?</p>
<p>And how do those get funded?</p>
<p>Well, those reparations-</p>
<p>And does the IMF get involved and say,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re gonna fund your $300 billion war damage bill</p>
<p>to the Ukraine?</p>
<p>And, you know, there ends up being a-</p>
<p>Do they just confiscate the $650 billion</p>
<p>sitting in foreign bank accounts</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s owned by the Central Bank of Russia?</p>
<p>Again, like how do you go back and lead a nation?</p>
<p>And how does a nation accept that?</p>
<p>How do they accept that their sovereignty</p>
<p>has now been challenged when a few months ago,</p>
<p>they were the aggressor, right?</p>
<p>I mean, look at what happened to Japan, by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very similar kind of psychological shock</p>
<p>that may not be as easy to swallow with modern Russians.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t all roads then lead to,</p>
<p>this is going to take a really long time to figure out?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either gonna take a long time</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s gonna catch on fire.</p>
<p>I thought Georgia took like 11 days.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s a Sun Tzu quote,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t wanna butcher,</p>
<p>but it was, build your opponent a golden bridge</p>
<p>to retreat across.</p>
<p>There needs to be a golden bridge here.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>We did talk about it two episodes ago where we said,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re not the people running the country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about like, where&rsquo;s Biden</p>
<p>and where&rsquo;s the rest of the State Department</p>
<p>in saying, here&rsquo;s an exit path for Putin</p>
<p>and clearly stated over and over again</p>
<p>and give him something to win, right?</p>
<p>I think we gave a suggestion, David, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong</p>
<p>if you suggested or I did two weeks ago</p>
<p>when we started talking about this, which was,</p>
<p>hey, why don&rsquo;t we just say,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re not going to allow Ukraine</p>
<p>to join NATO for a decade.</p>
<p>If you leave now, you know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so past that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so past that.</p>
<p>Are we?</p>
<p>That has nothing to do with, I think, what&rsquo;s going on now.</p>
<p>I mean, you had countries,</p>
<p>you had countries like that came off the sidelines</p>
<p>and have done things they haven&rsquo;t done 30, 40, 50 years.</p>
<p>And in some cases ever.</p>
<p>I mean, their industry just got gutted this week, J-Cal.</p>
<p>So like, there&rsquo;s a hundred million people worried about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hundred million people worried about food.</p>
<p>If we had done it preemptively, would it have made a difference?</p>
<p>I think it would have made a huge difference.</p>
<p>Like look at Germany as an example.</p>
<p>Germany undid 40 years of policy.</p>
<p>You know, they had consistently been under-investing</p>
<p>relative to their GDP in the military.</p>
<p>And they made an explicit commitment</p>
<p>to basically just ramp that up back above 2%.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ve also made commitments</p>
<p>around their energy independence.</p>
<p>You know, Switzerland is freezing bank accounts,</p>
<p>something that they&rsquo;ve really never done.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve always stayed neutral.</p>
<p>Sweden sending military support.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of countries in Europe,</p>
<p>in continental Europe that have found a voice.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s terrifying, right, Chamath?</p>
<p>I mean, to live with this threat just east of you,</p>
<p>this would be like us living with this threat</p>
<p>in Central America or something.</p>
<p>This is like two steps away.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what people forget,</p>
<p>is the geography here of, you know,</p>
<p>France, Germany, Poland, Ukraine.</p>
<p>I think this NATO commitment</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily get it done at this point.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with that.</p>
<p>I mean, it didn&rsquo;t have to be part of anything.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the exit ramp for Putin?</p>
<p>Well, the exit ramp, in my opinion,</p>
<p>is that you ratchet these economic sanctions up so severely</p>
<p>that then, you know, look, the thing is,</p>
<p>hopefully, in the aperture of war,</p>
<p>memories are short in the sense that, you know,</p>
<p>if you ratchet these things up very aggressively,</p>
<p>now all of a sudden something from even two weeks ago</p>
<p>seems like a much, much better place to be, right?</p>
<p>And so that could be an off ramp,</p>
<p>which is like you basically find a way</p>
<p>to take a lot of pressure off these economic sanctions</p>
<p>in return for a detente.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m making this up.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I mean, it feels like there&rsquo;s no exit here</p>
<p>because Putin has a lot of pride and nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Is this a no exit situation, Sax?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s always an exit.</p>
<p>We have to be willing to contemplate what that is.</p>
<p>I think, to your question,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back for a second to your question</p>
<p>of would it have made a difference</p>
<p>if we had taken NATO expansion off the table,</p>
<p>say, last year?</p>
<p>I think this year is probably already too late.</p>
<p>But I think the answer is yes,</p>
<p>regardless of whether you believe</p>
<p>that NATO expansion is a real issue for the Russians</p>
<p>or whether you think that&rsquo;s a pretext,</p>
<p>because people are in one of those two camps.</p>
<p>Putin has been saying since 2008,</p>
<p>in 2008, there was a NATO summit in Bucharest</p>
<p>in which they basically declared,</p>
<p>they proposed that Ukraine and Georgia</p>
<p>could eventually be eligible for membership.</p>
<p>That basically started this whole thing.</p>
<p>The Russians at the time said</p>
<p>this is an absolute non-starter for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a red line.</p>
<p>No way will we allow this to happen.</p>
<p>And in fact, later that year,</p>
<p>they rolled the tanks into Georgia</p>
<p>to put a stop to that idea in Georgia.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, the conversation was deferred.</p>
<p>They had this basically pro-Russian,</p>
<p>democratically elected prime minister,</p>
<p>president, Yukonovich,</p>
<p>who was deposed in a coup in 2014,</p>
<p>a coup that was supported by our State Department</p>
<p>and probably the CIA, okay?</p>
<p>In reaction to that, Putin seized Crimea,</p>
<p>not a year later, not months later, days later.</p>
<p>The reason why he was able to seize it so quickly</p>
<p>is the Russians actually have a naval base there</p>
<p>at Sevastopol, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a leased, the area&rsquo;s leased from Ukraine,</p>
<p>but they have a naval base there.</p>
<p>It allows them to control the Black Sea.</p>
<p>So the Russian thinking on this,</p>
<p>if you believe it, goes that,</p>
<p>listen, we&rsquo;re about to have a pro-Western ruler</p>
<p>come into Ukraine, installed by an American-backed coup,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re gonna lose our main naval base</p>
<p>in the Black Sea and it could be replaced with a NATO base.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So they moved to seize Crimea.</p>
<p>And then after that, they started backing Russian separatists</p>
<p>in the Donbass and the civil war began, okay?</p>
<p>So that basically is what&rsquo;s been leading up to this.</p>
<p>And then last year, they started getting very exercised</p>
<p>about the possibility of this NATO proposal,</p>
<p>which again, goes all the way back to 2008,</p>
<p>becoming formally recognized and Ukraine joining NATO.</p>
<p>And again, this is from the Russian perspective, okay?</p>
<p>And we could talk about whether it&rsquo;s a pretext in a second,</p>
<p>but from the Russian perspective,</p>
<p>they said that, listen, and Putin gave a speech like this.</p>
<p>If Ukraine joins NATO, because of Article V,</p>
<p>the next time we have a border dispute,</p>
<p>which is all the time, right?</p>
<p>We could end up getting drawn</p>
<p>into a World War III with you guys.</p>
<p>And so there is no way we&rsquo;re gonna allow Ukraine</p>
<p>to be part of NATO.</p>
<p>And so they basically by December</p>
<p>had given an ultimatum to the State Department.</p>
<p>Now, what was the response to that?</p>
<p>Lincoln came out at the critical moment and said,</p>
<p>NATO&rsquo;s door is open and will remain open.</p>
<p>Basically said, you guys can take a hike.</p>
<p>Now, obviously that was extremely provocative thing</p>
<p>and the Russians invaded Ukraine days later.</p>
<p>Now, I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious</p>
<p>that if you take the Russians at their word,</p>
<p>that they believe,</p>
<p>forget about whether you think it&rsquo;s true or not,</p>
<p>but if you believe, take them at their word,</p>
<p>the same word they&rsquo;ve been saying since 2008,</p>
<p>that this is a red line for them</p>
<p>and they have a serious vital national interest there,</p>
<p>then you should have diplomatically</p>
<p>tried to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>But even if you believe it was a pretext</p>
<p>and Putin is making up this whole red line thing</p>
<p>and his real goal is the expansion of Mother Russia</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Or reunification.</p>
<p>Or reunification.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s his real goal.</p>
<p>It still would have been a good idea</p>
<p>for Blinken to basically declare</p>
<p>that we were gonna take NATO expansion off the table,</p>
<p>which is simply an affirmation of the status quo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not appeasement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not giving anything up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re reaffirming the status quo.</p>
<p>Why would that have been a good idea?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re blocking something from happening in the future.</p>
<p>Why would that have been a good idea?</p>
<p>Because the polling on this showed</p>
<p>that the Russian people by two to one</p>
<p>were in favor of basically taking</p>
<p>this kind of military action against Ukraine</p>
<p>to prevent NATO expansion,</p>
<p>but they were not in favor of doing it</p>
<p>purely for reunification.</p>
<p>So you would have, if this was a pretext</p>
<p>by Putin for his expansionist dreams,</p>
<p>you could have taken away that card</p>
<p>and it would have changed his calculus.</p>
<p>Would it have prevented the war?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t say, but in his calculus,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gotta think, well, wait a second,</p>
<p>maybe the people won&rsquo;t be behind this.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the good news too.</p>
<p>If you had given him that chip</p>
<p>and said that we&rsquo;re not gonna let them into NATO</p>
<p>and then he does invade,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;ve proven that this person</p>
<p>is in reunification mode and he&rsquo;s deranged</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a warmonger and that this could go</p>
<p>to other places and Finland and Poland</p>
<p>and other people have a real reason to be scared.</p>
<p>Yes, he would have much less internal support.</p>
<p>It would have been a much better chess move.</p>
<p>Right, so there was a failure to listen</p>
<p>and this is what concerns me.</p>
<p>So I wanna, you know, George Herbert Walker Bush,</p>
<p>who I think was a great foreign policy president,</p>
<p>only sort of wasn&rsquo;t so good on domestic,</p>
<p>only got reelected, didn&rsquo;t get reelected,</p>
<p>but everyone recognized him</p>
<p>as a great foreign policy president.</p>
<p>And he has a quote about this style</p>
<p>of foreign diplomacy that his son practiced,</p>
<p>Dick Cheney and Rumsfeld and the same people now</p>
<p>in the Biden administration,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all the sort of neocon foreign policy.</p>
<p>He said, he called this iron ass foreign diplomacy.</p>
<p>He called Cheney an iron ass</p>
<p>and he called Rumsfeld arrogant.</p>
<p>And, you know, what he basically said</p>
<p>is that these guys he&rsquo;s talking about,</p>
<p>Cheney and Rumsfeld, they don&rsquo;t listen.</p>
<p>They just wanna kick ass and take names.</p>
<p>They never wanna listen to the other guy&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>And, you know, he thought this was tragic.</p>
<p>He thought it ruined Bush 43&rsquo;s presidency.</p>
<p>And I gotta wonder, I mean,</p>
<p>are we practicing the same style</p>
<p>of iron ass diplomacy here?</p>
<p>You know, well, now it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already at war.</p>
<p>I mean, I think if we had practiced,</p>
<p>I think if Herbert Walker Bush and James Baker,</p>
<p>it had been president last year</p>
<p>and James Baker was secretary of state,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;d be in this mess?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think James Baker would have figured out</p>
<p>a way to defuse it.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Who is the political scientist</p>
<p>that you shared that link from in the group chat</p>
<p>from the University of Chicago</p>
<p>this guy, John Mearsheimer,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s sort of king of the realists.</p>
<p>I watched the video from him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite convincing that we should have an approach</p>
<p>that was, hey, we don&rsquo;t need to incite Ukraine to break off.</p>
<p>We could let them make their own decisions</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re kind of taunting the Russians.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think, you know,</p>
<p>he makes a pretty convincing argument there.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think you need to be a Putin apologist.</p>
<p>You can keep in your head, this person&rsquo;s a dictator.</p>
<p>This is a communist country.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a murdering sociopath.</p>
<p>And at the same time, we should not provoke him</p>
<p>and let the Ukraine make their own decisions,</p>
<p>but not encourage them to come into NATO.</p>
<p>And we should have taken NATO off the table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that that would have been</p>
<p>a better decision here,</p>
<p>but we still can&rsquo;t think of an exit ramp here,</p>
<p>which, and I don&rsquo;t hear Putin talking about,</p>
<p>Putin has never said, I want X.</p>
<p>Well, no, I think, no, there have been times where he,</p>
<p>well, I mean, look, I think his demands</p>
<p>have been an on starter with us.</p>
<p>I think at this point, he wants Crimea.</p>
<p>He wants the Donbass to be independent,</p>
<p>maybe under the suzerainty of Russia,</p>
<p>some protectorate basically.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s talked about this denazification,</p>
<p>demilitarization of Ukraine.</p>
<p>I mean, so now I think the demands are escalated</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re at war and-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s lost too much.</p>
<p>He needs to get more, right?</p>
<p>I mean, part of the problem is-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying he&rsquo;s stuck?</p>
<p>He needs to-</p>
<p>No, I think once you&rsquo;ve, you know,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve invested a hundred dollars,</p>
<p>you got to make 150 back.</p>
<p>Whereas before he had invested $10,</p>
<p>he would have been happy taking 50 out.</p>
<p>You know, and I think at this point,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s put too much in to walk out</p>
<p>with the same sort of deal, you know,</p>
<p>he was looking at before.</p>
<p>What are the chances he&rsquo;s overplayed his hand?</p>
<p>Like the economic cost at this point to him,</p>
<p>the loss of jobs, the loss of customers,</p>
<p>the loss of the value of his currency.</p>
<p>I mean, you add all this stuff up,</p>
<p>so much has been taken away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to see him coming,</p>
<p>feeling like he can come out of this thing ahead.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s only going to keep plowing forward.</p>
<p>Does he face the risk of ruin, Chamath?</p>
<p>I mean, is this like, at this point-</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s what I will say.</p>
<p>In 2020, Russian GDP was $1.483 trillion.</p>
<p>Now, what percentage of that do you think</p>
<p>is actually exports versus a domestic economy?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say half, let&rsquo;s be, just take a guess, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about $750 billion of exports.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say that, you know,</p>
<p>between the BOJ, Bank of Canada, ECB,</p>
<p>and the Federal Reserve,</p>
<p>we all just collectively printed $5 trillion.</p>
<p>You can absorb many, many years of Russia&rsquo;s export loss.</p>
<p>Now, it does have some gnarly implications.</p>
<p>You know, you probably have to work more closely,</p>
<p>for example, with Iran.</p>
<p>You have to get an Iran nuclear deal done.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>So that we can get access to their oil, right?</p>
<p>So it blunts the loss of the Russian reserves,</p>
<p>as an example.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;d have to do some clever things</p>
<p>on sustainability and farming.</p>
<p>My point is, though,</p>
<p>that I think the economic calculus of this decision</p>
<p>is not as grandiose as it once may have seemed</p>
<p>post the COVID scenario where we were printing,</p>
<p>you know, hundreds of billions of dollars a month.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>the only good news I can take from this, Ax is,</p>
<p>you know, the free world has now learned about</p>
<p>what a dependency,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve literally woken up from the delusion</p>
<p>that we can intertwine.</p>
<p>Hold on, let me just finish this one statement</p>
<p>and I want to get your feedback on it.</p>
<p>We have woken up from a delusion</p>
<p>that we can intertwine our economies with</p>
<p>rich and nuclear powered dictators in communist countries,</p>
<p>both China and Russia.</p>
<p>And now I think the great decoupling</p>
<p>and the great independence is upon us</p>
<p>with us moving semiconductors back on shore,</p>
<p>going nuclear, maybe fracking seems,</p>
<p>I think even any environmentalist will take fracking</p>
<p>in Europe, fracking in the United States</p>
<p>over a dependency over a dictator.</p>
<p>So is that not a silver lining here?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, I think it&rsquo;s so obvious now</p>
<p>to everybody that we need to be energy independent,</p>
<p>that it was insane for us to throw away</p>
<p>that energy independence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve restricted it.</p>
<p>I think that if there was a bill introduced,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s being talked about</p>
<p>to repeal all the restrictions on fracking,</p>
<p>it would pass the Senate 75-25,</p>
<p>meaning all the Republicans would vote for it</p>
<p>and half of the Democrats would vote for it.</p>
<p>So I think everybody&rsquo;s on board now.</p>
<p>And there was some remarkable,</p>
<p>you see the tweets from Michael Schellenberger about it.</p>
<p>It has come out that, you know who was backing all these-</p>
<p>The anti-fracking, yes.</p>
<p>The anti-fracking environmental movement in Europe.</p>
<p>And they fell for it.</p>
<p>And they fell for it, exactly.</p>
<p>And the Germans fell for it and turned off nuclear.</p>
<p>And now all of a sudden, they&rsquo;re dependent on Russia.</p>
<p>And he has the pretext to now invade.</p>
<p>Right, these environmental groups in Europe</p>
<p>have been useful idiots for Putin and the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so sad.</p>
<p>I think I saw a tweet, it was something to the effect</p>
<p>that 25 years ago or 30 years ago,</p>
<p>Europe actually produced more liquefied natural gas</p>
<p>for Europe than Russia did.</p>
<p>And the whole thing flipped</p>
<p>because all these environmentalists forced Europe</p>
<p>to shut down. They outsourced their guilt.</p>
<p>They outsourced their guilt,</p>
<p>but it turned out that a lot of those organizations</p>
<p>may have been funded by Russia</p>
<p>to basically affect that change.</p>
<p>I wanted to say something, Jason, before,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a common thing that you hear right now,</p>
<p>which is, oh, economic sanctions don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to talk about that for one second,</p>
<p>which is, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people,</p>
<p>there was a lot of chatter</p>
<p>that historically economic sanctions aren&rsquo;t enough,</p>
<p>which is why you can&rsquo;t draw a very clear, bright line</p>
<p>between that and military intervention as well.</p>
<p>And I thought, and I, as I thought about it,</p>
<p>this is why I think you can actually fight</p>
<p>an economic battle and an economic conflict</p>
<p>without it pulling you into a military one.</p>
<p>And the reason is actually because of what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>in the last 40 or 50 years.</p>
<p>You know, you have like the most critical infrastructure</p>
<p>in the world, I think is the financial infrastructure,</p>
<p>whether we like it or not, right?</p>
<p>Because, you know, energy infrastructure</p>
<p>tends to be more localized,</p>
<p>other forms of infrastructure are localized.</p>
<p>But the one real asset that is absolutely global</p>
<p>and universal is the financial payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>And, you know, what has really happened</p>
<p>is that you can really cripple a country or an entity</p>
<p>when you blacklist them from these organizations</p>
<p>and these networks.</p>
<p>And so this is why I actually think people underestimate</p>
<p>the severity of economic sanctions if done correctly.</p>
<p>And I think before, you&rsquo;ve never really,</p>
<p>other than, you know, Venezuela</p>
<p>and a couple of other, you know, North Korea,</p>
<p>North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Cuba,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never really explored the totality</p>
<p>and the impact of this kind of sanctions</p>
<p>on a large global actor, which were</p>
<p>this is almost greater than sanctions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being you&rsquo;re not allowed to participate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even like you&rsquo;re saying you can&rsquo;t export this,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t import this, it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re now not allowed,</p>
<p>you have no seat at the table.</p>
<p>I think the crude oil example</p>
<p>and the airline industry example</p>
<p>are two incredible examples</p>
<p>of the ripple effects of these sanctions, right?</p>
<p>So again, just to reiterate,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re a European based refiner,</p>
<p>in order for you to go and buy that oil,</p>
<p>you may have, you know, a working capital line</p>
<p>from a German bank.</p>
<p>Well, that would violate the terms of that bank now.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t go and get that, right?</p>
<p>If you actually have that oil on hand,</p>
<p>and you refine it into gasoline,</p>
<p>and you want to put it into the open market,</p>
<p>and you call Flexport as an example and say,</p>
<p>help me get this stuff to XYZ location</p>
<p>or Merced or somebody else, they won&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I mean, and you look at the tech sanctions</p>
<p>that have started, it sounds minor,</p>
<p>but you have Netflix is pulled out of the country,</p>
<p>Apple is not selling products in the country,</p>
<p>Google is starting to restrict services in the company.</p>
<p>And this is going to have a massive impact</p>
<p>on their ability to just participate in society.</p>
<p>They just turned off proactively this morning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw that,</p>
<p>it was right as we were getting on air.</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s been banned.</p>
<p>Instagram is still on Twitter still on,</p>
<p>but the Russians now are turning off information</p>
<p>into the country, while every other country,</p>
<p>every other company is turning off their services there.</p>
<p>I think the global economy,</p>
<p>or not even the global economy,</p>
<p>I think Japan, Europe, Canada, America,</p>
<p>can collectively support five, six, $7 trillion</p>
<p>of subsidies to blunt the economic impact</p>
<p>of these sanctions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s effectively shutting Russian exports off</p>
<p>for eight, nine, 10 years.</p>
<p>Think about the, so, you know, this is, that is the damage.</p>
<p>Any thoughts here as we kind of come to no way out here</p>
<p>and just the Russian economy being decoupled?</p>
<p>So I think that if we&rsquo;re going to figure out a way out,</p>
<p>we need to assess what our objectives,</p>
<p>you know, what our objectives are.</p>
<p>And we talked earlier on the show</p>
<p>about this idea of regime change</p>
<p>and that there wouldn&rsquo;t be an answer without regime change.</p>
<p>I disagree with that.</p>
<p>You know, just those two words, regime change,</p>
<p>should make everybody cringe</p>
<p>because regime change was the justification</p>
<p>for the Iraq war, for Afghanistan, for Libya, for Syria,</p>
<p>and every single one of those things has been a disaster.</p>
<p>When has the United States of America</p>
<p>successfully achieved regime change in the last 20 years</p>
<p>without creating enormous blowback?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an assumption that somehow,</p>
<p>if Putin gets toppled by an internal coup,</p>
<p>that we end up with Gorbachev 2.0.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we do.</p>
<p>Maybe we end up with a hardliner who&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So what should the goal be?</p>
<p>Obviously, regime change would be wonderful</p>
<p>if the Russian people chose that.</p>
<p>But what is the-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say ceasefire.</p>
<p>Ceasefire and peace, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>Ceasefire.</p>
<p>I think Putin miscalculated the resolve</p>
<p>of Zelensky and the West.</p>
<p>You know, Zelensky was like this TV actor,</p>
<p>became president.</p>
<p>He was very, before this, he was like 25% popularity.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s at 90 something percent.</p>
<p>I think Putin underestimated his resolve.</p>
<p>He-</p>
<p>Would you say Putin has lost the information war?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s pretty staggering.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that Putin thought</p>
<p>he could win this information war.</p>
<p>This is the first meme, the first meme war.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it is a meme war.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re being heavily propagandized.</p>
<p>But if-</p>
<p>But the West is winning the propaganda war.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not just the West.</p>
<p>Look at, yeah, but I mean,</p>
<p>look at where you&rsquo;re sitting, right?</p>
<p>Ukraine is engaged in that effort too, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you had the whole Snake Island thing</p>
<p>where basically the, you know, the Ukrainians-</p>
<p>Did that wind up being confirmed as fake news?</p>
<p>That was fake, okay?</p>
<p>You had Snake Island where the 13 Ukrainian soldiers</p>
<p>said we&rsquo;re gonna-</p>
<p>Tell them to death off, yeah.</p>
<p>Bring us death rather than surrender.</p>
<p>It turns out they actually surrendered.</p>
<p>You had the old woman walking up to the Russian soldiers</p>
<p>with her-</p>
<p>Tell them to get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, that was a fake.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>I mean, I think this-</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s fake.</p>
<p>This Chernobyl 2.0 was fake.</p>
<p>Oh, the-</p>
<p>Well, that was half fake.</p>
<p>The fighter pilot, the fighter pilot,</p>
<p>was the ghost of-</p>
<p>The ghost of Kiev.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That turned out to be a fake.</p>
<p>So look, we are being heavily propagandized.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t blame Zelensky or the Ukrainians</p>
<p>for trying to propagandize us</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re a small country fighting for their lives.</p>
<p>And if they can pull us into the war, it would help them.</p>
<p>It might also cause World War III.</p>
<p>Or just win hearts and minds and flip Russian sentiment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something else that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I just went to the World Bank site</p>
<p>just to check whether the GDP number</p>
<p>that I just gave you was right.</p>
<p>And it is right, but what&rsquo;s even more interesting</p>
<p>is that Russian GDP has actually decayed 35%</p>
<p>in the last decade.</p>
<p>It peaked in 2013 at $2.292 trillion.</p>
<p>And so, and all the way down to now 1.483.</p>
<p>So I think the point is with, you know,</p>
<p>all of these other things</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been having to deal with</p>
<p>because of their foreign adventurism,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen a contraction of their economy already.</p>
<p>Freeberg, did we over, did the West</p>
<p>and everybody overestimate Russia&rsquo;s capabilities here?</p>
<p>I mean, is that a possibility?</p>
<p>Because they seem like they&rsquo;re getting beaten pretty,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being fought back</p>
<p>at a way people didn&rsquo;t think they would be able to.</p>
<p>First of all, I have no frigging clue.</p>
<p>Second of all, I don&rsquo;t know like what people think</p>
<p>that they thought they knew or do or don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I think importantly,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s going on over there.</p>
<p>You know, we are hearing stories every day</p>
<p>that we feel is conclusive and factual</p>
<p>and on the ground reporting.</p>
<p>And then a few hours later,</p>
<p>we find out may or may not actually be true.</p>
<p>You know, this is the fog of war.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t take anything that I&rsquo;m reading on Twitter</p>
<p>or seeing on CNN or hearing some commentator</p>
<p>from the United States making some comment about,</p>
<p>nor would I feel the same about any commentator</p>
<p>in the Ukraine or Russia or anywhere else for that matter.</p>
<p>Facts are gonna be facts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure facts are necessarily gonna get to us.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on the ground with Russia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a convoy supposedly</p>
<p>that we know we can see from satellite imagery</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s moving towards Kiev.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stopped.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why it stopped.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s claims by one group of people</p>
<p>that says they&rsquo;re out of food and they&rsquo;re defecting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s claims by another group of people</p>
<p>that say they&rsquo;re waiting to encircle the city</p>
<p>and then command pressure</p>
<p>and use this as leverage effectively</p>
<p>to try and get a good negotiated deal to exit.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And so, you know, for us to be like, you know,</p>
<p>four guys commentating at Starbucks,</p>
<p>I think is a bit of a mistake</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s very few facts</p>
<p>that we can actually say is objectively true at this point.</p>
<p>Now, what we do know is Russia has a lot of nukes.</p>
<p>And so regardless of what&rsquo;s going on the ground</p>
<p>with tactical stuff, you know,</p>
<p>any sort of assumption that leads to our belief</p>
<p>that an alternative intervention</p>
<p>or some other force can ultimately win against Russia</p>
<p>is completely false</p>
<p>because Russia has thousands of nuclear warheads.</p>
<p>And, you know, if Russia wanted to exert</p>
<p>its military authority over anyone in the world, they can.</p>
<p>And so I wouldn&rsquo;t kind of take any of this stuff</p>
<p>that Russia is gonna lose a war, you know,</p>
<p>a war on the ground in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>I mean, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got the ultimate trump card.</p>
<p>Well, and also they haven&rsquo;t brought out the heavy,</p>
<p>the heavy army.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got bombers.</p>
<p>Yes, they can bomb Kiev into rubble.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got those bunker buster bombs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got stuff that, yeah.</p>
<p>And what is the strategy here to just-</p>
<p>Listen, they can pull a Grozny.</p>
<p>They can pull a Fallujah.</p>
<p>I mean, look, you know, we, they, we can,</p>
<p>a Dresden, let&rsquo;s not pretend like we haven&rsquo;t done it too.</p>
<p>They can bomb the cities into rubble from the sky.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not, because it would be too bad.</p>
<p>You know, their pullback would be too bad from the West.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, but there&rsquo;s certainly a strategy.</p>
<p>These guys aren&rsquo;t a bunch of idiots scrambling around</p>
<p>trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got the second most powerful military</p>
<p>on planet earth that can literally destroy</p>
<p>every human on planet earth.</p>
<p>They are, they are pretty smart</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to figure something out</p>
<p>to get themselves some sort of an advantage, ultimately.</p>
<p>What that is, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re sitting here trying to figure out</p>
<p>how to play chess and we&rsquo;ve never played it before.</p>
<p>I mean, Sachs, that might be something worth discussing.</p>
<p>There is a contingent that say, listen,</p>
<p>Putin isn&rsquo;t thinking about this strictly logically.</p>
<p>Yeah, I understand that point of view.</p>
<p>You hear it a lot on, on the press.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I, well, here&rsquo;s what I think is,</p>
<p>I think Putin underestimated Zelensky&rsquo;s resolve,</p>
<p>Ukrainian resolve, and I&rsquo;d say the West resolve.</p>
<p>I think it would be a mistake, however,</p>
<p>for us to underestimate his resolve.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid of next</p>
<p>is that he doesn&rsquo;t want to give up.</p>
<p>And listen, to go back to, you know, the Mearsheimer point.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a school of realism and what Mearsheimer says,</p>
<p>and he predicted a lot of this.</p>
<p>So you have to-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, yeah.</p>
<p>He gave a great talk in 2015.</p>
<p>I watched him right before we got on air.</p>
<p>Right, one of the ways-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put it in the show notes.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the ways I assess who I want to listen to</p>
<p>and learn more from is when I see someone</p>
<p>making farsighted predictions that come true,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay-</p>
<p>Pretty good one, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, okay, this guy has a mental model</p>
<p>that seems to predict the world, right?</p>
<p>I mean, like Karl Popper said famously</p>
<p>that the difference between science and religion</p>
<p>is that science makes predictions that are falsifiable.</p>
<p>If you make predictions, one prediction after another</p>
<p>that ends up becoming true,</p>
<p>maybe you have a way of thinking about the world</p>
<p>that is predictive.</p>
<p>This guy, I would just say,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t summarize all of his thinking here,</p>
<p>but I would just say,</p>
<p>I mean, I went down kind of a rabbit hole on YouTube</p>
<p>just watching his stuff.</p>
<p>Obviously, not all of it is right, okay?</p>
<p>But the media has been demonizing this guy</p>
<p>because for the few things he&rsquo;s gotten wrong</p>
<p>about the situation,</p>
<p>instead of all the things he&rsquo;s gotten right,</p>
<p>and if you were to do the Washington establishment</p>
<p>by the same standard,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve gotten far more wrong than he has,</p>
<p>especially since the Iraq War over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>But anyway, the point he makes</p>
<p>or one of the points is,</p>
<p>listen, this situation in Ukraine is to the Russians</p>
<p>what the Cuban Missile Crisis was to us,</p>
<p>meaning it is not a pretext for Putin</p>
<p>to go in and expand his empire.</p>
<p>What is really going on here</p>
<p>is they have defined this as a red line</p>
<p>they see as a vital national security interest.</p>
<p>And so we should be thinking about them and their resolve</p>
<p>the way that we thought about the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>the Russians are acting like the Americans did</p>
<p>in the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
<p>And remember, Fidel Castro thought he had the sovereignty,</p>
<p>he thought he had the right</p>
<p>to go make a treaty and a deal with whoever he wanted.</p>
<p>And he went to the,</p>
<p>freely went to the Soviet Union to try and make a deal.</p>
<p>And the Americans said, no way.</p>
<p>And you know, not in our backyard.</p>
<p>And we imposed a blockade and we were flying the bombers</p>
<p>and Kennedy had advisors and generals</p>
<p>who were willing to go to nuclear war</p>
<p>to win that standoff in that confrontation.</p>
<p>And ultimately the way that they solve the problem</p>
<p>is JFK sent Bobby Kennedy</p>
<p>to go secretly cut a deal with the Russians</p>
<p>to pull the Jupiter missiles, the warheads out of Turkey.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a quid pro quo.</p>
<p>They kept it secret for six months.</p>
<p>Kennedy got to declare a victory,</p>
<p>but the Russians, the Soviets got something out of it too.</p>
<p>They were able to diffuse the situation.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s any way to make a deal like that,</p>
<p>I think it would be a good idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the reason, don&rsquo;t you think the reason he is,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think the reason, Sax, that he is misunderstood</p>
<p>is because we are propagating democracy.</p>
<p>And when we do something, well, it has the shine of,</p>
<p>hey, we want people to be free.</p>
<p>We want individual freedom.</p>
<p>We want individual human rights.</p>
<p>We want individual expression.</p>
<p>These things are the height of human existence.</p>
<p>And when communist countries do it,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re trying to spread communism and authoritarianism</p>
<p>and reduce human&rsquo;s individualism and freedoms.</p>
<p>And that is a valid argument.</p>
<p>But he says in his talks, like, listen,</p>
<p>you can put that aside and just say,</p>
<p>you know, missiles in your backyard, not good.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So this is the fundamental dichotomy</p>
<p>in sort of the foreign policy thinking</p>
<p>or international relations</p>
<p>is between idealism and realism.</p>
<p>Idealism says it&rsquo;s all about values.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going around the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re promoting democracy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supporting allies who we think will spread democracy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good guys and bad guys.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the sides of the good guys</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s who we support.</p>
<p>And we change the regimes that are the bad guys.</p>
<p>But the realists think of this as great power rivalry.</p>
<p>And we have to understand the way</p>
<p>that great powers have always reacted and behaved.</p>
<p>And great powers, whether it&rsquo;s Russia or the Soviet Union</p>
<p>or us will behave viciously and ruthlessly</p>
<p>towards anything they perceive as a threat</p>
<p>to their national security,</p>
<p>their vital national security interests.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this being the moment</p>
<p>we make the next big transition?</p>
<p>We were in a bipolar world order.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been in unipolar for the majority of our lifetimes</p>
<p>where we only experienced the United States.</p>
<p>And now is this the moment we move to multipolar sex?</p>
<p>Where we&rsquo;re gonna, or have we moved there already?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a transition that&rsquo;s happening mainly because of China.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in, you know, it seems like what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is pushing Russia irrevocably into Xi&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna be part of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge mistake.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s part of that.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m surprised to hear you say that, J-Kal.</p>
<p>Well, I said it two weeks ago.</p>
<p>I mean, I said, this sounds crazy,</p>
<p>but if we could get Putin to be, you know, in talks with us,</p>
<p>then he&rsquo;s not in talks with Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>And when you saw him with, you know,</p>
<p>taking pictures with Xi Jinping,</p>
<p>that should have been a red alarm bell</p>
<p>to everybody that our foreign policy is not working.</p>
<p>Because if he&rsquo;s talking to Xi Jinping, supposedly,</p>
<p>who knows if this is true, again,</p>
<p>fog of war to Freiburg&rsquo;s point, you know,</p>
<p>maybe Xi Jinping told him,</p>
<p>can you wait till after the Olympics to do this invasion?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re coordinating at that level,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really problematic for the US.</p>
<p>We need him on our side.</p>
<p>We need to get Pakistan on our side, India, South Korea.</p>
<p>We need to build an alliance to deal with the eventuality</p>
<p>of China going into the South China Sea</p>
<p>and taking over Taiwan.</p>
<p>So Chamath, what are your thoughts on,</p>
<p>does this give Xi Jinping a window or not?</p>
<p>And is there any path to getting Russia back</p>
<p>in talks with the West?</p>
<p>Maybe he can help get them restarted</p>
<p>in a way that could normalize relations.</p>
<p>Is this, well, the real question is like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re Xi, do you look at this and say,</p>
<p>it emboldens me?</p>
<p>Or I have to be even more strategic and crafty?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I say the latter, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the latter, right?</p>
<p>If Russia had rolled.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is one good thing and I&rsquo;ll sort of contradict</p>
<p>what I said a little bit before.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not passionately attached</p>
<p>to either the realist or the idealist school of thinking.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re interesting.</p>
<p>We need to consider both perspectives.</p>
<p>What I would say is that the resilience,</p>
<p>the ferocity of the Ukrainians,</p>
<p>the resistance defending themselves,</p>
<p>giving Putin a punch in the nose,</p>
<p>we can all support that</p>
<p>because we know that Xi is watching.</p>
<p>And if he sees, wow,</p>
<p>the Russians really got a tough time with Ukrainians,</p>
<p>what, you know,</p>
<p>am I going to be facing a similar situation with Taiwan?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is that the way the Ukrainians,</p>
<p>they basically were willing to arm every man, woman,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know, child, but every man and woman there,</p>
<p>they were handing out the AK-47s.</p>
<p>Basically they Israelized, right?</p>
<p>You want to know how Israel has survived in a neighborhood</p>
<p>where everyone wants to kill them?</p>
<p>Every single adult serves in the army and they get guns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>second amendment over there.</p>
<p>Forced.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>So I think that the Ukrainians have shown a model</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really based on the Israel model,</p>
<p>which is, listen,</p>
<p>if Taiwan really wants to be independent,</p>
<p>every adult there needs to learn how to fight</p>
<p>and they need to have weapons.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be the best guarantee.</p>
<p>We can be their ally,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s going to be the best guarantor</p>
<p>is creating a credible deterrent to Xi moving on them.</p>
<p>I mean, do we transition to another story here?</p>
<p>I mean, this is one of the problems</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re living in these kinds of times</p>
<p>is that if you talk about anything other than</p>
<p>this horrible man.</p>
<p>I saw a tweet,</p>
<p>when all the decision trees can go to zero,</p>
<p>meaning that like there&rsquo;s a 1% chance of,</p>
<p>or 0.1% or 0.01% chance of war three,</p>
<p>the nuclear war, then yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to talk about anything else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to think about anything else, so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I watched Ozarks this week.</p>
<p>Well, amazing.</p>
<p>Is that good?</p>
<p>Ozark?</p>
<p>Is that good?</p>
<p>Ozark is great.</p>
<p>Jason Bateman, amazing.</p>
<p>Jason Bateman is so frigging good on it.</p>
<p>Breaking Bad 2.0.</p>
<p>I just started that series twice</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve fallen asleep in episode one both times.</p>
<p>No, no, no, you gotta keep going.</p>
<p>It rolls.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically Breaking Bad 2.0.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I started season two of Euphoria.</p>
<p>Oh my Lord.</p>
<p>Oh my Lord.</p>
<p>That is, I will never let your kids watch it.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either that,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like the best deterrent.</p>
<p>So like you make them sit and watch it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll, not only will they never not do drugs,</p>
<p>but like they just won&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just like stay in the house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scarring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically Requiem for a Dream</p>
<p>meets like Disney plus afternoons.</p>
<p>Like these are Disney stars living in Requiem for a Dream.</p>
<p>Do not watch it.</p>
<p>I need to decompress after I watch it.</p>
<p>If you have kids, it&rsquo;s terrorizing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely terrifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scarring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very artistic too, I have to say.</p>
<p>I give them a lot of points.</p>
<p>Should we talk about markets?</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a really kind of important discussion</p>
<p>because the markets are so volatile</p>
<p>during these kind of volatile information times,</p>
<p>times of information that&rsquo;s changing day to day, intraday.</p>
<p>Where do you guys think about</p>
<p>kind of spending your time right now?</p>
<p>Are you kind of just putting your head in the sand</p>
<p>and saying, we&rsquo;ll pull it out afterwards?</p>
<p>I mean, how do you guys kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, well, what&rsquo;s funny is like I&hellip;</p>
<p>Sax is curled up in a ball.</p>
<p>You know, in times of uncertainty,</p>
<p>you actually want to be deploying.</p>
<p>So, you know, I announced, what was it last week?</p>
<p>I think it was.</p>
<p>The solar deal.</p>
<p>The solar deal, you know,</p>
<p>I put $228 million into this thing.</p>
<p>And then I did another deal.</p>
<p>I put 45 million bucks into this thing</p>
<p>you guys know about, which we haven&rsquo;t announced yet.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So, but other than that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been literally white knuckled.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to open the stock app.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point.</p>
<p>Take some Dramamine before you open</p>
<p>your Morgan Stanley account.</p>
<p>The stock app.</p>
<p>The stock app.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s so funny is like my Bloomberg terminal,</p>
<p>which is right beside me here at my desk,</p>
<p>I have not logged into it.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>Put it in a drawer.</p>
<p>Unplug it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no point.</p>
<p>At the end of every week, I get a report, right?</p>
<p>Kind of like our P&amp;L.</p>
<p>And I just look at the top line,</p>
<p>like Connor always sends me the top line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>and the last like eight weeks in a row,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve lost 1%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lost 2%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lost 3%.</p>
<p>The time that&hellip;</p>
<p>Sax wishes he lost 1%.</p>
<p>I celebrated.</p>
<p>I got so drunk that night.</p>
<p>I was like, finally.</p>
<p>This is where it really does help, right, Sax,</p>
<p>to think in decades.</p>
<p>Like if you think in decades</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a venture investor,</p>
<p>you can kind of just put this stuff out of your mind,</p>
<p>which is what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And the great thing is I&rsquo;m seeing amazing companies,</p>
<p>great founders.</p>
<p>Deals are taking longer to close.</p>
<p>People are starting to do diligence again.</p>
<p>And people are discussing what the right valuation</p>
<p>for this early stage startup is,</p>
<p>which is good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s healthy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>in the early to mid-stage market privately,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m seeing really healthy discussions</p>
<p>and late stage madness is gone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think a hundred times ARR is over,</p>
<p>but no one really knows where it&rsquo;s landing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m seeing some deals get done at 60 to 80 times,</p>
<p>but no one really knows where it should be.</p>
<p>I sent you guys this tweet from Morgan Housel,</p>
<p>who is a great guy.</p>
<p>And he has this fabulous tweet.</p>
<p>He says, it says the shock cycle.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this beautiful cycle.</p>
<p>Assume good news is permanent, oblivious to bad news.</p>
<p>Then you ignore the bad news.</p>
<p>Then you deny the bad news.</p>
<p>Then you panic at the bad news,</p>
<p>but then you accept the bad news.</p>
<p>And then you ignore the good news.</p>
<p>You deny the good news.</p>
<p>You accept the good news.</p>
<p>And then you assume the good news is permanent.</p>
<p>That starts a cycle.</p>
<p>If I could just put it out there,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know today if you guys saw non-farm payrolls,</p>
<p>but we had a huge print in unemployment,</p>
<p>like really great print,</p>
<p>meaning like a lot of employers</p>
<p>were able to find people to take jobs.</p>
<p>It was a big number.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing about it</p>
<p>was we didn&rsquo;t see wage inflation tick up with it.</p>
<p>And if I had to look at that,</p>
<p>and if you actually look at a bunch of the earnings reports</p>
<p>that have come out in the last three or four weeks,</p>
<p>I actually think we&rsquo;re in the part of the cycle here</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re starting to ignore the good news.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re so negative,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re so emotionally wrapped up in everything</p>
<p>that people forget that actually the world</p>
<p>tends to keep moving forward, right?</p>
<p>We are not in World War III.</p>
<p>By any measure, we are not anywhere near that, okay?</p>
<p>And so I just think it&rsquo;s important for people</p>
<p>to take a step back and take a really deep breath.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of good news out there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of good news.</p>
<p>And for people who don&rsquo;t know the term-</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re ignoring it.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know the term print,</p>
<p>when we say there&rsquo;s a print,</p>
<p>that is just a colloquialism in the financial markets</p>
<p>that something was formatted for printing previously</p>
<p>and you got good news.</p>
<p>So an official report is sometimes called,</p>
<p>we got a print.</p>
<p>I agree with, I think what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>is there is some underlying good news, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this overhead of a small chance</p>
<p>of something catastrophic happening.</p>
<p>So how do you price that in, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a one outer, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Quads were set over set.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a one outer to the apocalypse, basically.</p>
<p>If a tiny probability thing happens, the game is over.</p>
<p>So, you know, why even worry?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The cost of your house doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a nuclear war.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>This is the thing that people underestimate</p>
<p>is like, that&rsquo;s not a risk</p>
<p>that one should be hedging in any way financially, right?</p>
<p>At that point, the only thing that matters</p>
<p>is the health and safety of your family and your friends.</p>
<p>But really, in your immediate family,</p>
<p>like, can you take care of them and make sure they&rsquo;re safe?</p>
<p>And so, you know, if you&rsquo;re an investor</p>
<p>in the financial markets or you&rsquo;re building a company,</p>
<p>managing for that externality, in my opinion,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it makes a ton of sense</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think you can manage to that externality.</p>
<p>You have no impact on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cataclysmic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something completely out of your control.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think you have to manage</p>
<p>to the 99.999% of normalized outcomes.</p>
<p>And I think right now,</p>
<p>there are some what&rsquo;s called green shoots,</p>
<p>meaning like some positive news in the world</p>
<p>and some positive data.</p>
<p>By the way, the other thing that we saw today was,</p>
<p>or this week was Jerome Powell.</p>
<p>And, you know, the Jerome Powell testimony</p>
<p>was also in the middle of massive amounts of bad news,</p>
<p>some actually pretty decent good news,</p>
<p>which was, he said he&rsquo;s gonna raise</p>
<p>by 25 basis points in March.</p>
<p>Everybody knew that, right?</p>
<p>So we took the 50 basis pointer off the table,</p>
<p>but then he was very clear</p>
<p>that they were going to be data-driven.</p>
<p>And in the language of the Federal Reserve,</p>
<p>what that essentially means is like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be patient and wait and see.</p>
<p>And if you couple it with what I said before,</p>
<p>which is the economic cost</p>
<p>of these economic sanctions towards Russia</p>
<p>can be calculated.</p>
<p>And I think that we have proven a willingness</p>
<p>to print capital and money.</p>
<p>And so if you put those two things together,</p>
<p>I think there could be a real possibility</p>
<p>that Powell becomes very accommodative.</p>
<p>And, you know, he and Biden</p>
<p>and the entire administration come together</p>
<p>with Europe and everybody else and say,</p>
<p>get the money printer back going,</p>
<p>because we are gonna stand the line</p>
<p>on these economic sanctions.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna, you know,</p>
<p>sort of soft land the economy here,</p>
<p>because we think there&rsquo;s recessionary risks afoot.</p>
<p>Let me just provide a little bit of a counterpoint,</p>
<p>which is where I&rsquo;m most concerned.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what the repercussions are fully</p>
<p>in a dynamical system of global capital,</p>
<p>of pulling out this much capital</p>
<p>and devaluing assets at this scale so quickly.</p>
<p>The shock to the system,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think has yet been realized.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll know at the end of this month</p>
<p>when books close,</p>
<p>what things actually do to businesses,</p>
<p>to swap agreements, to trades, you know,</p>
<p>trade balances that are outstanding.</p>
<p>And you could talk about economic stimulus</p>
<p>as being the way to solve that,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t yet know what&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>let me just give you guys another example.</p>
<p>Today, corn, I think is trading at 760 a bushel.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t happened, guys,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you in how long.</p>
<p>This was a commodity that was trading at 350</p>
<p>a few months ago.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re now talking about that,</p>
<p>the trickle down effect of that price into the beef,</p>
<p>the trickle down effect</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re already seeing in California or San Francisco,</p>
<p>where the average price per gallon of gas at over $5.</p>
<p>The trickle down effect on purchasing behavior,</p>
<p>on businesses defaulting</p>
<p>because suddenly their counterparties dry up.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, and we won&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just about-</p>
<p>Actually, we know some of those.</p>
<p>We know some of them,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And the thing I&rsquo;m concerned about is this is,</p>
<p>imagine when I say dynamical system</p>
<p>from a physics perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, take 100 slinkies and tie them together</p>
<p>into a giant graph of slinkies.</p>
<p>And you start punching one of the slinkies like this.</p>
<p>If you punch one or two of the slinkies hard enough,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know how the repercussions will cause</p>
<p>a slinky all the way over there to suddenly shoot up</p>
<p>or shoot down, but there are-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also denying your ability</p>
<p>to change a difference slinky.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of a dynamical system.</p>
<p>You could put energy back into it,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>And there could be something that&rsquo;s irreparably broken.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through these things before,</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;re not learning from history</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re at least not willing to admit it, but-</p>
<p>No, I think we&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen it in TARP, okay?</p>
<p>We did not know the total extent of what happened in the GFC.</p>
<p>And we had to invent a financial framework</p>
<p>to soft land the global economy.</p>
<p>We figured it out.</p>
<p>When we went through LTCM and John Merriweather blew up-</p>
<p>Explain what that is.</p>
<p>There was a huge hedge fund in the late nineties</p>
<p>that basically had a massively levered exposure</p>
<p>to the financial markets,</p>
<p>to the tune of like tens or tens</p>
<p>or hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Go read the book, When Genius Failed,</p>
<p>if you want to read the story.</p>
<p>It does a good job summarizing it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a great story.</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>And again, we had to step in with a governmental framework</p>
<p>and a broad infrastructure of actors across the world</p>
<p>to soft land the financial economy in a way,</p>
<p>not knowing what the actual, what part was broken.</p>
<p>So I just fundamentally disagree with this idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re running blind.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about capital and energy and food.</p>
<p>And some combination of those things</p>
<p>are going to cause some serious deleterious effects</p>
<p>on people and on markets.</p>
<p>And look, I get it, Chamath.</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s solutions for repair,</p>
<p>and I know that we&rsquo;re going to act swiftly and aggressively.</p>
<p>And every time, by the way, I just want to point out,</p>
<p>in each of those scenarios you&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve acted more swiftly and more aggressively</p>
<p>than we did in the scenario prior.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s getting to the point that,</p>
<p>what is the value?</p>
<p>How much debt, how much deficit</p>
<p>are we really willing to take on?</p>
<p>Everyone obviously has these kind of</p>
<p>intrinsic existential questions</p>
<p>about how much we really can act long-term</p>
<p>without the dollar collapsing.</p>
<p>But certainly in the context of a global economy collapsing,</p>
<p>the dollar will always be the safe haven.</p>
<p>But there are other things at play here,</p>
<p>like, you know, the cost of gas for the average American,</p>
<p>you know, the amount of wheat and the amount of food</p>
<p>that people in Africa are going to have access to.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re saying here, Freeberg,</p>
<p>is that some of these things we have been through,</p>
<p>and if you look at gas as one example,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re bringing up the important ones here,</p>
<p>food and energy, gas.</p>
<p>We actually know what happens when gas prices go up.</p>
<p>We saw that not long ago.</p>
<p>People bought more hybrids</p>
<p>and the miles per gallon per car.</p>
<p>You know, when you raise prices, consumption goes down</p>
<p>and people get creative.</p>
<p>Those are long-term adjustments, J. Cal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the short-term acute effects.</p>
<p>The thing that America has the ability to do</p>
<p>is they have the ability to change the financial incentives</p>
<p>for actors all around the world in a split second.</p>
<p>And behavior can change.</p>
<p>And so I actually think, Freeberg,</p>
<p>the nuanced thing that you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which I completely agree with,</p>
<p>but maybe we should say more explicitly is,</p>
<p>it probably is a reasonable way to manage risk</p>
<p>in America, Europe, Canada, Japan.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s going to be very, very difficult</p>
<p>is the impact that this has on emerging markets</p>
<p>in Southeast Asia, Asia, Africa,</p>
<p>could be really, really deleterious for some amount of time.</p>
<p>And sad, and it&rsquo;s gonna cause a humanitarian problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really friggin&rsquo; sad and it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>whatever progress has been made could be unwound.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>By the way, I think that that is actually</p>
<p>really the risk that I think</p>
<p>holding the line on these sanctions really does.</p>
<p>It pushes the risk towards EM countries.</p>
<p>And then I think we&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out</p>
<p>what our moral resolve is to go and fix those.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my point earlier,</p>
<p>which is we&rsquo;re gonna bear the cost ultimately.</p>
<p>The United States is gonna have to step up</p>
<p>in a really outsized way to solve this problem.</p>
<p>And while we might not be sending troops on the ground,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna end up paying several trillion dollars.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>just the United States, Freeberg.</p>
<p>The United States seems to be working in coordination</p>
<p>with our allies in this situation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not acting unilaterally anymore.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good news.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have an economic cost, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be something.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re asking me, there&rsquo;s no amount of money</p>
<p>that you can actually put on human life.</p>
<p>And so if we can avoid a military war,</p>
<p>I just think that there&rsquo;s no red line on cost there.</p>
<p>And so if we end up running massive deficits,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re at 150, 250, 300% of GDP,</p>
<p>I think that morally that is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Sachs, is the world becoming more idealistic and realistic?</p>
<p>Let me bring Sachs in here.</p>
<p>Sachs, is the world becoming more anti-fragile</p>
<p>slash resilient, pick one of the two, I guess,</p>
<p>to these kind of upending events because of COVID,</p>
<p>because of China pulling out of financial markets?</p>
<p>We just went through this.</p>
<p>Freeberg was like, hey, this is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Actually, I think we have a little bit of precedent here.</p>
<p>We have the complete shutdown of the economy from COVID</p>
<p>in recent memory.</p>
<p>And we have China deciding that all these companies</p>
<p>are no longer public.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen, they did their own economic sanctions.</p>
<p>They sanctioned themselves and pulled out of markets.</p>
<p>So what do you think, Sachs?</p>
<p>I think the current crisis is a reminder</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not too anti-fragile.</p>
<p>I think we are in a transition.</p>
<p>The Cold War ended about 30 years ago.</p>
<p>And since then, we&rsquo;ve been engaging</p>
<p>in this sort of unipolar foreign policy</p>
<p>where America calls all the shots.</p>
<p>Now the world is becoming more multipolar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s all the way there yet.</p>
<p>And you have countries like Russia and China</p>
<p>reasserting themselves,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s making the world a more dangerous place.</p>
<p>Well, you also have the EU working together in unison,</p>
<p>and they seem to be,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re gonna become a bigger actor here</p>
<p>because of this, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing them take a bigger-</p>
<p>That was sort of a positive surprise,</p>
<p>as long as they don&rsquo;t pull a Franz Ferdinand,</p>
<p>like Freeberg said,</p>
<p>and inadvertently blunder us into a war.</p>
<p>Okay, folks, this is This Week in Dystopian Outcomes.</p>
<p>No, no, let&rsquo;s talk about something good.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>In other good news, let&rsquo;s talk about the big Cartier</p>
<p>breakthrough this week.</p>
<p>There is good news, guys.</p>
<p>Good news is there.</p>
<p>There must be.</p>
<p>The good news is that we&rsquo;re managing crises after crises.</p>
<p>China crises-</p>
<p>Freeberg, do you want to tell people</p>
<p>about this revolutionary breakthrough in cancer?</p>
<p>I mean, look, there&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>there was another Cartier therapy approved,</p>
<p>two of them approved in the last week for myeloma.</p>
<p>Cartier just, I think we&rsquo;ve talked about it in the past.</p>
<p>You know, every human body has T cells.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a core part of your immune system.</p>
<p>T cells are programmed,</p>
<p>so they have a sensor, you know,</p>
<p>that tells them where to go and what to destroy.</p>
<p>And so, as T cells learn what to destroy,</p>
<p>you know, they can be really effective</p>
<p>at clearing bad things out of your body,</p>
<p>clearing pathogens and invasive things out of your body.</p>
<p>And so, a few years ago, you know,</p>
<p>humans gained the ability to engineer T cells</p>
<p>by adding the genetic code to a T cell,</p>
<p>effectively engineering it to go after a very specific thing.</p>
<p>And so, the big revolution in Cartier therapies</p>
<p>has been in oncology and cancer.</p>
<p>So, you know, programmed T cells</p>
<p>to destroy specific cancer cells in the body</p>
<p>that, you know, you would historically</p>
<p>have had to use really difficult,</p>
<p>systemically challenging drugs like chemotherapies</p>
<p>and so on to wipe out lots of cells,</p>
<p>and in many cases, doesn&rsquo;t eradicate all the cancer.</p>
<p>And Cartier turns out it can be extremely effective</p>
<p>at finding very specific cancer cells in your body,</p>
<p>and in many cases, causing complete remission in cancer.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there was one Cartier that was approved</p>
<p>that showed, I believe it was an 88 or 90%</p>
<p>complete remission in multiple myeloma,</p>
<p>which is a form of blood cancer.</p>
<p>So, they take your T cells out of your body,</p>
<p>you just get a little blood draw basically,</p>
<p>they go in a lab, they&rsquo;re zapped with electricity,</p>
<p>which causes them to open up slightly</p>
<p>and an engineered, a little CRISPR edit happens,</p>
<p>and those cells are now edited,</p>
<p>the DNA in those cells is edited,</p>
<p>and now those cells know to go after the cancer target.</p>
<p>You put them back in your body after they grow up</p>
<p>for a few days, and they filter them and test them,</p>
<p>make sure they&rsquo;re safe,</p>
<p>and after they go back in your body,</p>
<p>the T cells go to work and they clear</p>
<p>all the cancer cells out of your body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible technology.</p>
<p>Incredible technology.</p>
<p>Cell-based therapies are unbelievable.</p>
<p>Is the name of the company involved in this A2 Bio?</p>
<p>Is that the company?</p>
<p>No, A2 did something else,</p>
<p>so that breakthrough was even more important,</p>
<p>I think, in the long term.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s talking about is Janssen and Legend</p>
<p>are the two companies that basically</p>
<p>got approval from the FDA.</p>
<p>The thing with CAR T is like,</p>
<p>CAR T has been incredibly believed in blood-based cancers,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s an entire category</p>
<p>that excludes solid tumor cancers.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re talking about, Jason, this week as well,</p>
<p>what happened was A2 Bio basically figured out</p>
<p>how to modify these T cells in a way</p>
<p>where you can actually attack and target</p>
<p>a very specific solid tumor.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot more work for those guys,</p>
<p>but if you play that out,</p>
<p>now you have this incredible ability for your own body</p>
<p>to be trained to fight and kill cancer,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in your blood or whether it&rsquo;s the solid tumors.</p>
<p>Now, the price of these therapies today,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re charging, call it 400 to $450,000 per treatment.</p>
<p>And by the way, the treatment, it&rsquo;s a one-time shot.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, they pull the blood out of your body,</p>
<p>and then the expensive, challenging part</p>
<p>is how do you take the cells, isolate them,</p>
<p>engineer them, test them, screen them,</p>
<p>make sure they&rsquo;re safe.</p>
<p>The way that is done today</p>
<p>is very expensive and time-consuming</p>
<p>because the volume is low</p>
<p>and there haven&rsquo;t been as many kind of engineering</p>
<p>breakthroughs over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>How long does it take, do you know?</p>
<p>It takes months?</p>
<p>It could take a week to four weeks,</p>
<p>so before you get-</p>
<p>For one person, 10 people?</p>
<p>Is it the equipment that&rsquo;s expensive?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no.</p>
<p>Like, I actually, I invited Chamath to come with me.</p>
<p>We went and visited one of these labs a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>but I won&rsquo;t get into it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s unnecessarily inefficient</p>
<p>in the sense that you can charge so much</p>
<p>because when you spend half a million dollars</p>
<p>to treat a cancer patient,</p>
<p>you just save yourself millions of dollars</p>
<p>in long-term care for that cancer patient.</p>
<p>So the price is determined by the alternative cost.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how a lot of drugs are priced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how do you save money over the long run</p>
<p>for the payer, you know, the insurance company?</p>
<p>And so if the insurance company knows over the long run</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna pay $3 million in care for this cancer,</p>
<p>this type of cancer-</p>
<p>You save them 2.5.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re willing to spend half a million dollars</p>
<p>to, you know, to end the cancer.</p>
<p>Is that the right financial calculus for this, Chamath?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>So if you look at the actual cost of doing this,</p>
<p>there is a university in the Bay Area</p>
<p>that is doing CAR T therapies,</p>
<p>and their cost is about 40 grand.</p>
<p>They built their own lab to do this.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And that, by the way, is also extremely inefficient.</p>
<p>We, I think that over the long run,</p>
<p>we can get the cost of cell therapies below 5,000 bucks.</p>
<p>And when you can do that, by the way,</p>
<p>CAR T can be used not just to go after cancer,</p>
<p>but you can get it to go after autoimmunity.</p>
<p>So people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis,</p>
<p>there are known B cells in your body</p>
<p>that are making antibodies</p>
<p>that are causing the inflammation in your body,</p>
<p>destroying your own body.</p>
<p>And so down the road,</p>
<p>we could use CAR T to destroy lupus,</p>
<p>to destroy antibodies,</p>
<p>B cells that are producing antibodies</p>
<p>that are, you know,</p>
<p>fundamentally causing autoimmune conditions,</p>
<p>including what we talked about a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>multiple sclerosis,</p>
<p>given that we now have a strong belief</p>
<p>that if you can get rid of the EBV,</p>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus from your body,</p>
<p>you can wipe that out.</p>
<p>So CAR T can in the long run be harnessed,</p>
<p>not just for cancer,</p>
<p>but autoimmunity and potentially other pathogens</p>
<p>in the body in a really targeted way.</p>
<p>And this is kind of the beginning</p>
<p>of what will likely be a multi-decade</p>
<p>kind of new therapeutic modality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, accelerating.</p>
<p>I had a question for you, Shabazz, though,</p>
<p>on the pricing model here of,</p>
<p>hey, the way we price this is</p>
<p>how much are we saving the insurer?</p>
<p>Is that too much price optimization?</p>
<p>Is there a better model here?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I would like to talk about something else.</p>
<p>Related to this, Jason,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this massive patent battle going on</p>
<p>for CRISPR. Oh, CRISPR, yeah.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s worth, J Cal,</p>
<p>if you can give just a two-second primer,</p>
<p>because I think we should talk about patents</p>
<p>just for a second.</p>
<p>And, you know, there are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the extreme version,</p>
<p>which is what Elon has done.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the other extreme version,</p>
<p>which is these two folks fighting over</p>
<p>what could be a critical vaccine.</p>
<p>Obviously, Elon has gone with putting the patents out,</p>
<p>making his patents open source</p>
<p>and putting them out there</p>
<p>and using them as a deterrent,</p>
<p>like nuclear weapons have been.</p>
<p>But the US Patent and Trademark Office</p>
<p>published a ruling on Monday</p>
<p>in favor of MIT and Harvard over Berkeley.</p>
<p>The ruling cancels certain patent applications</p>
<p>made by the University of California and its partners</p>
<p>regarding a CRISPR system known as CRISPR-CAS9.</p>
<p>CAS9.</p>
<p>CAS9.</p>
<p>The ruling states that they failed</p>
<p>to provide persuasive evidence</p>
<p>that they got the gene editing technology to work</p>
<p>before the broad group did.</p>
<p>The central question and dispute is</p>
<p>which group got to the CRISPR-CAS9 tool?</p>
<p>Basically, the whole thing here, Jason,</p>
<p>is like there was a group</p>
<p>led by these two incredible scientists</p>
<p>who they won the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re Berkeley and she,</p>
<p>Emmanuelle, I think is,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s at a university in Germany, I think.</p>
<p>But then there was a different team</p>
<p>trying to develop a system for CRISPR-CAS9</p>
<p>from MIT, Harvard, at the Broad,</p>
<p>and they all filed patents on top of each other</p>
<p>and this whole thing was a thing.</p>
<p>You know, the big implication of all this</p>
<p>is what are companies supposed to do, right?</p>
<p>Because if you are a company that wants to build</p>
<p>a CRISPR-CAS9 gene editing thing,</p>
<p>look, there&rsquo;s a lot of situations</p>
<p>where a single point edit or a broad edit</p>
<p>can have a meaningful change in your health.</p>
<p>So these are businesses that should exist.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>because if you licensed the IP from the wrong person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get sued.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And many companies now are like trying to license</p>
<p>both sets of patents.</p>
<p>And I just think to me,</p>
<p>it frustrated me when I read this article.</p>
<p>And you know, this is the conversation I had</p>
<p>with you guys in the group chat,</p>
<p>is I think we need to think of</p>
<p>and imagine a new way for patents to work</p>
<p>because it shouldn&rsquo;t be the case that,</p>
<p>you know, folks are competing</p>
<p>for what is really effectively credit.</p>
<p>And then what stops behind them</p>
<p>are all the commercial companies and investors</p>
<p>and just the normal individual day-to-day people</p>
<p>who want solutions to solvable problems.</p>
<p>But the reason it doesn&rsquo;t get to the starting line</p>
<p>is because of patent credit</p>
<p>and having to deal with patent trolls.</p>
<p>And I just think that that&rsquo;s a terrible situation</p>
<p>for us to be in.</p>
<p>Especially if it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that could change the course of humanity,</p>
<p>almost feels like an arbitrator has to come in here</p>
<p>and force a settlement.</p>
<p>What do you think Freeberg is the right thing to do?</p>
<p>Obviously, we have a tradition of people getting to,</p>
<p>you know, monetize, dare I say.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re innovations for some period of time with a patent.</p>
<p>I have multiple businesses I&rsquo;m involved in</p>
<p>where we leverage CRISPR.</p>
<p>And I will tell you that the, you know,</p>
<p>the group at Harvard,</p>
<p>so the history is the group of Harvard</p>
<p>and the group at Berkeley argue,</p>
<p>each argue that they discovered CRISPR-Cas9</p>
<p>around the same time,</p>
<p>or each argue that they have a right to CRISPR technology</p>
<p>based on their discoveries</p>
<p>that were made around the same time.</p>
<p>And so for years,</p>
<p>each of them have been starting companies</p>
<p>and licensing CRISPR technologies to different companies.</p>
<p>And all of those companies now,</p>
<p>including several that are public,</p>
<p>it turns out that if this ruling, you know,</p>
<p>is to be believed,</p>
<p>they actually have a license to a technology</p>
<p>that they may not actually have a license to.</p>
<p>So there was a company that emerged a few years ago</p>
<p>and actually made an open-sourced version of this system.</p>
<p>And so I have at least one company</p>
<p>in plant gene editing,</p>
<p>where we leverage this open-sourced version of this system.</p>
<p>And many more companies,</p>
<p>many more businesses are embracing</p>
<p>that open-source alternative.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we see this turning out</p>
<p>to be any different than what we saw</p>
<p>with the proliferation of Linux in computer software,</p>
<p>where, you know, Microsoft or whomever was trying to,</p>
<p>you know, make everyone pay a licensing fee</p>
<p>to use their operating system.</p>
<p>And guess what markets discovered?</p>
<p>They discovered that,</p>
<p>hey, if someone is able to make something free</p>
<p>and open-source it, everyone will embrace it.</p>
<p>And here we are,</p>
<p>where most of the internet is run on open-source software.</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t know what the right thing to do</p>
<p>with respect to patents are,</p>
<p>because, you know, the truth is,</p>
<p>a lot of very difficult, very expensive technology,</p>
<p>R&amp;D dollars go into developing a technology</p>
<p>that is theoretically,</p>
<p>someone could look at it and make a copy of it.</p>
<p>And so I do think that there are rights to defend</p>
<p>with respect to patents.</p>
<p>I think that there is,</p>
<p>if there is something that is a critical resource</p>
<p>that an entire industry really needs to access,</p>
<p>an open-source solution will emerge.</p>
<p>You know, the markets take care of it.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve already seen that with CRISPR.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s hard to say.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>you want to license a, you know, patent a molecule</p>
<p>and be the only person that can make that molecule</p>
<p>and make money from it?</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>But if everyone&rsquo;s going to need that molecule</p>
<p>to run their business and to change the world,</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s going to make a cheaper alternative</p>
<p>or a free alternative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way markets work, so.</p>
<p>Saks would like to recite a poem for peace.</p>
<p>At the end of the podcast, he&rsquo;s gone totally soft.</p>
<p>The pacifist, David Saks.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;d like to address what you said</p>
<p>when you called me a pacifist.</p>
<p>Cause I think actually-</p>
<p>Oh my God, here we go, after hours.</p>
<p>This is all in after dark.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an existential pacifist.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Saks.</p>
<p>Read your poem.</p>
<p>When did I become a pacifist?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not really a pacifist.</p>
<p>Look, I still believe in the idea of peace through strength,</p>
<p>like Reagan said, okay?</p>
<p>But I remember when we,</p>
<p>what is the only clean win</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had in a war since World War II, America has.</p>
<p>Clean win, straight shot.</p>
<p>The first Iraq war when we drove Saddam out of Kuwait.</p>
<p>That was George Herbert Walker Bush.</p>
<p>Our last conventional war.</p>
<p>Well, it was also the last war that we actually won.</p>
<p>Every other war that we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>has been turned into a fiasco.</p>
<p>Winning was pretty easy to define, get out of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The other ones, we were trying to do revolutions.</p>
<p>But remember, everybody wanted him to go all the way</p>
<p>and march into Baghdad and change the regime,</p>
<p>replace Saddam.</p>
<p>And he said, no.</p>
<p>And he had the wisdom to stop.</p>
<p>And everybody called him a wimp,</p>
<p>but he still had the determination and the wisdom to stop.</p>
<p>And then what happened, his son comes in 10 years later</p>
<p>and they finish the job.</p>
<p>They take out Saddam</p>
<p>and they destabilize the entire Middle East.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the iron asses got us.</p>
<p>So what has turned me against these regime change wars?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, look, when I was in college,</p>
<p>I thought Herbert Walker Bush was a wimp, you know?</p>
<p>And George W. Bush was doing the right thing</p>
<p>going into Iraq 20 years ago.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve seen the results.</p>
<p>And anybody today who doesn&rsquo;t modify their point of view</p>
<p>on these regime change wars is a fool.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re not paying attention.</p>
<p>And so for Lindsey Graham and, you know,</p>
<p>these other guys out there to be,</p>
<p>a lot of Republicans to be talking about regime change</p>
<p>as something we should be seriously promoting,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve totally lost the script</p>
<p>and they should be denounced as reckless, dangerous fools.</p>
<p>And look, I&rsquo;ve seen it on both sides of the aisle,</p>
<p>but what we need to do, now listen,</p>
<p>if it ends up being the case</p>
<p>that the Russian people want to make a change,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s up to them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their call.</p>
<p>Obviously I&rsquo;m not opposing something</p>
<p>that they might want to do,</p>
<p>but for the idea that that should be our goal,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our end game, that&rsquo;s our objective,</p>
<p>that is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll just wind up getting in a perpetual war.</p>
<p>Then when we leave, it&rsquo;ll revert.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we saw.</p>
<p>It reverts back to communist or authoritarianism.</p>
<p>The people have to really want it.</p>
<p>Revolutions are hard fought and bloody.</p>
<p>And if you think you can just go in there</p>
<p>with a couple of drones and get everybody to decide,</p>
<p>oh, we embrace democracy from this point forward,</p>
<p>because you drone the hell out of the country,</p>
<p>is farcical and it&rsquo;s proven to be wrong.</p>
<p>100% agreement with you.</p>
<p>No ceasefire is gonna be possible.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be hard enough as it is</p>
<p>to get anything remotely like a deal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not gonna be possible</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve defined regime change as your objective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s way to dig Putin in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally what he wants to&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving him all the pretext he needs</p>
<p>to keep this thing going, if it&rsquo;s self-preservation.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, there&rsquo;s your overtime.</p>
<p>Sax&rsquo;s writers were freaking out in the writer&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>I had to get his last point in</p>
<p>before I pinned him as a pacifist.</p>
<p>There are no writers for this stuff, J. Cal,</p>
<p>because look, everybody on cable news</p>
<p>is singing from the same hymnal</p>
<p>and following the same script.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all being the drones of war.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one critique right now,</p>
<p>which is we&rsquo;re not doing enough and we&rsquo;re being weak</p>
<p>and Biden needs to do more.</p>
<p>Not being weak.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Having patience is not being weak.</p>
<p>We are doing a lot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing a lot and we should be careful.</p>
<p>De-escalation is the opposite of weak.</p>
<p>These economic sanctions are real.</p>
<p>We have to follow through.</p>
<p>And I think we have to make sure</p>
<p>that the economy is supported while we do it.</p>
<p>On that note, let&rsquo;s pray for peace</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see you all next week on the podcast.</p>
<p>The All In Summit is May 15th to the 17th, 16th and 17th</p>
<p>are the two days of the conference.</p>
<p>Poker on the 15th, a tournament for charity,</p>
<p>events every night of the week.</p>
<p>And you can apply for a scholarship</p>
<p>at the website summit.allinpodcast.co</p>
<p>or just type in the All In Summit into Google.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be the first link.</p>
<p>And 400 of 600 tickets have been allocated,</p>
<p>either sold or for scholarships.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do the best we can</p>
<p>to have as great of an audience there as possible.</p>
<p>And for the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya,</p>
<p>the Rain Man, David Sachs,</p>
<p>and the Sultan of Science,</p>
<p>hot off the launch of Canna,</p>
<p>congratulations, turning literally water into wine.</p>
<p>David Friedberg, I&rsquo;m Jake Al,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see you next time.</p>
<p>Love you, boys.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>The queen of Kinwan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let, let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatars will meet me at the&hellip;</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Let your beat be.</p>
<p>Let your beat be.</p>
<p>Let your beat be.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
