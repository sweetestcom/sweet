Burke I&amp;rsquo;m not losing weight what do I do well first of all I don&amp;rsquo;t know I have to find out what&amp;rsquo;s causing that so I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about some mistakes that people make and then we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what really people should do but you have to differentiate what&amp;rsquo;s the symptom versus the actual problem or the cause of the problem if we talk about people that plateau they&amp;rsquo;ll say well it&amp;rsquo;s a slow metabolism right well that&amp;rsquo;s really a symptom because like what causes a slow metabolism now sometimes people jump to well it&amp;rsquo;s just old age I&amp;rsquo;m getting older well then that doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain the people that do get older and they still can lose weight and I have other people that are younger that plateau as well so I think the biggest problem the biggest air is jumping to a conclusion before you evaluate or investigate okay so when you go from symptom to cause you have to do an evaluation and this is really the weakness within the medical profession it&amp;rsquo;s the weakness with a lot of people so you can&amp;rsquo;t really figure anything out unless you have data you have information so you have to find out number one what is the person eating are they on the correct program do they have any body problems that relate to this why because sleeping could cause it a solid issue can cause it constipation can be a problem all these other things right you want to know when did the problem start what happened just before it started was there a change autoimmune diseases Kapp and after stress events a lot of issues happen after a change in something and change in your diet you&amp;rsquo;re doing fine and you change the diet then you start gaining weight well okay that&amp;rsquo;s important data so evaluation is finding out associated symptoms history what happened just before anything that might be connected so you don&amp;rsquo;t always want to jump to conclusion to determine that&amp;rsquo;s it that&amp;rsquo;s the lazy way of doing it well let&amp;rsquo;s take a lazy person says well why can&amp;rsquo;t you lose weight I&amp;rsquo;m just lazy well are you sure that&amp;rsquo;s what it is I mean it could be that you&amp;rsquo;re tired you know or let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re procrastinate well maybe you crave too many foods because your diet is so messed up so you want to go deeper you want to start pulling a string and find out what is really causing it the why behind it guys let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what all the potential things that could cause a plateau in your diet that I see number one the person is not sleeping I see that often the person is overtraining they&amp;rsquo;re doing too much that can stop I had a lady she lifted was at six two and a half million pounds over Corsa V a year that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of weight she&amp;rsquo;s lifted working out every other day for a whole year and she lost like one or two pounds why because she&amp;rsquo;s overtraining and she wasn&amp;rsquo;t sleeping so we look at that another reason what can cause Plateau or even a slow metabolism would be a thyroid condition okay so that&amp;rsquo;s something to look at but then you want to find out if that if you person has a thyroid problem what&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s behind that so it could be either a high estrogen coming from an overactive ovary or come from a bad liver or maybe gall bladder problem or Missy your gallbladder removed and now you can&amp;rsquo;t convert t4 to t3 so you got to just keep pulling the string to find find out what&amp;rsquo;s going on so in order to evaluate you have to have some understanding about the problem as well so maybe you haven&amp;rsquo;t had any anatomy and physiology classes so you can&amp;rsquo;t really evaluate correctly so you&amp;rsquo;re going to depend on the doctor which and that&amp;rsquo;s where the problem is because here&amp;rsquo;s what the doctors do it we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a blood test okay that&amp;rsquo;s as far as they go do a blood test everything shows normal so you must be faking it well a blood test even for the adrenal we&amp;rsquo;ll only show up maybe 10% of time or even a liver problem shows up when the liver is almost completely destroyed so you can&amp;rsquo;t always go by that one piece of information another thing that I find that&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the most common things is high levels of insulin in the body it&amp;rsquo;s called insulin resistance maybe not even a diabetic state but a pre-diabetic State now if you do a blood test all the common blood tests you check the a1c which is an average of blood sugars for three months that might be normal or you might check glucose fasting glucose that may be normal why because it&amp;rsquo;s high insulin or insulin resistance could be a pre-diabetic it hasn&amp;rsquo;t its subclinical doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up until later stages so if the person if requested from your doctor a fasting insulin test that we pick it up but you&amp;rsquo;re going to know about that but if that insulin is five to seven times higher like it is for insulin resistance they&amp;rsquo;re not losing weight because in the presence of insulin the all the fat burning hormones are nullified so this is just all great information so when you&amp;rsquo;re pulling a string and you&amp;rsquo;re finding out why the questions that I&amp;rsquo;m going to ask to evaluate someone is I&amp;rsquo;m going to ask all the symptoms of insulin resistance you find like you&amp;rsquo;re not satisfied after you eat do you get tired after eating do you crave sweets do you find you can&amp;rsquo;t go between meals without being hungry do you find that you you have a history of eating a lot of sugar like all these key questions and then I&amp;rsquo;ll know pretty pretty closely what it is and let&amp;rsquo;s say for example I&amp;rsquo;m still confused I kind of think it could be insulin resistance but it could be this other thing over here well you can always just start doing the diet or the remedy or the handling for instant resistance and see if you got losing weight and then we know that was it so that&amp;rsquo;s just I want to just go deeper of why someone might be plateauing but and know the pitfalls the pitfalls are jumping to conclusion before you evaluate it to find a real cause and all the videos that I&amp;rsquo;ve done and what I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing kind of gives you a lot of data on experience evaluating a lot of people so you can kind of spot things for yourself okay I have a quiz down in the description box that does some evaluation it basically analyzes a hundred and four questions and if you want to do that go ahead and do that and we&amp;rsquo;ll send you the results but it actually assesses all the deeper root causes and then I give you a little printout of showing it what is behind all your symptoms if you&amp;rsquo;re interested take it but I want to just thank you for watching and I&amp;rsquo;ll see you in the next video"><title>Why People Plateau with Weight Loss – Dr. Berg ｜ DrEricBergDC |

to talk about why people actually plateau with  </p><p>their weight loss okay so what I want to 
differentiate I want to differentiate cause  </p><p>versus effect some people come up to me and they 
say oh dr. Burke I&rsquo;m not losing weight what do I  </p><p>do well first of all I don&rsquo;t know I have to find 
out what&rsquo;s causing that so I&rsquo;m going to talk about  </p><p>some mistakes that people make and then we&rsquo;ll 
talk about what really people should do but you  </p><p>have to differentiate what&rsquo;s the symptom versus 
the actual problem or the cause of the problem if  </p><p>we talk about people that plateau they&rsquo;ll say 
well it&rsquo;s a slow metabolism right well that&rsquo;s  </p><p>really a symptom because like what causes a slow 
metabolism now sometimes people jump to well it&rsquo;s  </p><p>just old age I&rsquo;m getting older well then that 
doesn&rsquo;t explain the people that do get older  </p><p>and they still can lose weight and I have other 
people that are younger that plateau as well so  </p><p>I think the biggest problem the biggest air is 
jumping to a conclusion before you evaluate or  </p><p>investigate okay so when you go from symptom 
to cause you have to do an evaluation and this  </p><p>is really the weakness within the medical 
profession it&rsquo;s the weakness with a lot of  </p><p>people so you can&rsquo;t really figure anything out 
unless you have data you have information so you  </p><p>have to find out number one what is the person 
eating are they on the correct program do they  </p><p>have any body problems that relate to this why 
because sleeping could cause it a solid issue  </p><p>can cause it constipation can be a problem all 
these other things right you want to know when  </p><p>did the problem start what happened just before 
it started was there a change autoimmune diseases  </p><p>Kapp and after stress events a lot of issues 
happen after a change in something and change  </p><p>in your diet you&rsquo;re doing fine and you change 
the diet then you start gaining weight well okay  </p><p>that&rsquo;s important data so evaluation is finding 
out associated symptoms history what happened  </p><p>just before anything that might be connected so 
you don&rsquo;t always want to jump to conclusion to  </p><p>determine that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s the lazy way of doing 
it well let&rsquo;s take a lazy person says well why  </p><p>can&rsquo;t you lose weight I&rsquo;m just lazy well are 
you sure that&rsquo;s what it is I mean it could  </p><p>be that you&rsquo;re tired you know or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re 
procrastinate well maybe you crave too many foods  </p><p>because your diet is so messed up so you want to 
go deeper you want to start pulling a string and  </p><p>find out what is really causing it the why behind 
it guys let&rsquo;s talk about what all the potential  </p><p>things that could cause a plateau in your diet 
that I see number one the person is not sleeping  </p><p>I see that often the person is overtraining 
they&rsquo;re doing too much that can stop I had a  </p><p>lady she lifted was at six two and a half million 
pounds over Corsa V a year that&rsquo;s a lot of weight  </p><p>she&rsquo;s lifted working out every other day for a 
whole year and she lost like one or two pounds  </p><p>why because she&rsquo;s overtraining and she wasn&rsquo;t 
sleeping so we look at that another reason what  </p><p>can cause Plateau or even a slow metabolism would 
be a thyroid condition okay so that&rsquo;s something  </p><p>to look at but then you want to find out if that 
if you person has a thyroid problem what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s  </p><p>behind that so it could be either a high estrogen 
coming from an overactive ovary or come from a bad  </p><p>liver or maybe gall bladder problem or Missy your 
gallbladder removed and now you can&rsquo;t convert t4  </p><p>to t3 so you got to just keep pulling the string 
to find find out what&rsquo;s going on so in order to  </p><p>evaluate you have to have some understanding 
about the problem as well so maybe you haven&rsquo;t  </p><p>had any anatomy and physiology classes so you 
can&rsquo;t really evaluate correctly so you&rsquo;re going  </p><p>to depend on the doctor which and that&rsquo;s where 
the problem is because here&rsquo;s what the doctors  </p><p>do it we&rsquo;re going to take a blood test okay that&rsquo;s 
as far as they go do a blood test everything shows  </p><p>normal so you must be faking it well a blood test 
even for the adrenal we&rsquo;ll only show up maybe 10%  </p><p>of time or even a liver problem shows up when the 
liver is almost completely destroyed so you can&rsquo;t  </p><p>always go by that one piece of information another 
thing that I find that&rsquo;s probably one of the most  </p><p>common things is high levels of insulin in the 
body it&rsquo;s called insulin resistance maybe not  </p><p>even a diabetic state but a pre-diabetic State now 
if you do a blood test all the common blood tests  </p><p>you check the a1c which is an average of blood 
sugars for three months that might be normal or  </p><p>you might check glucose fasting glucose that may 
be normal why because it&rsquo;s high insulin or insulin  </p><p>resistance could be a pre-diabetic it hasn&rsquo;t its 
subclinical doesn&rsquo;t show up until later stages  </p><p>so if the person if requested from your doctor a 
fasting insulin test that we pick it up but you&rsquo;re  </p><p>going to know about that but if that insulin is 
five to seven times higher like it is for insulin  </p><p>resistance they&rsquo;re not losing weight because in 
the presence of insulin the all the fat burning  </p><p>hormones are nullified so this is just all great 
information so when you&rsquo;re pulling a string and  </p><p>you&rsquo;re finding out why the questions that I&rsquo;m 
going to ask to evaluate someone is I&rsquo;m going  </p><p>to ask all the symptoms of insulin resistance you 
find like you&rsquo;re not satisfied after you eat do  </p><p>you get tired after eating do you crave sweets do 
you find you can&rsquo;t go between meals without being  </p><p>hungry do you find that you you have a history of 
eating a lot of sugar like all these key questions  </p><p>and then I&rsquo;ll know pretty pretty closely what it 
is and let&rsquo;s say for example I&rsquo;m still confused  </p><p>I kind of think it could be insulin resistance 
but it could be this other thing over here well  </p><p>you can always just start doing the diet or the 
remedy or the handling for instant resistance and  </p><p>see if you got losing weight and then we know that 
was it so that&rsquo;s just I want to just go deeper of  </p><p>why someone might be plateauing but and know the 
pitfalls the pitfalls are jumping to conclusion  </p><p>before you evaluate it to find a real cause 
and all the videos that I&rsquo;ve done and what I&rsquo;m  </p><p>currently doing kind of gives you a lot of data 
on experience evaluating a lot of people so you  </p><p>can kind of spot things for yourself okay I have 
a quiz down in the description box that does some  </p><p>evaluation it basically analyzes a hundred and 
four questions and if you want to do that go ahead  </p><p>and do that and we&rsquo;ll send you the results but it 
actually assesses all the deeper root causes and  </p><p>then I give you a little printout of showing 
it what is behind all your symptoms if you&rsquo;re  </p><p>interested take it but I want to just thank you 
for watching and I&rsquo;ll see you in the next video</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
