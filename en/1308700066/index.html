    <p>Our card this week is James Walker III, the King of Clubs from Kansas.</p>
<p>When James was shot to death at a house party in 2017, local police kicked off an investigation</p>
<p>to find the people responsible.</p>
<p>But they were soon met with obstacles left and right, from lack of physical evidence</p>
<p>to witnesses refusing to cooperate.</p>
<p>Today, both investigators and James&rsquo; family believe the case could be solved if just one</p>
<p>person who knows the truth is brave enough to come forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>The Suburban neighborhood of Linwood in Wichita, Kansas was usually quiet on Sunday evenings.</p>
<p>And April 9th, 2017 was no different.</p>
<p>With the weekend winding down, most residents could count on a peaceful evening before the</p>
<p>work week started back up the next day.</p>
<p>Which is why a loud bang caught the attention of an elderly woman named Georganne.</p>
<p>It was a little after 9 p.m., so when she heard the bang, she paused.</p>
<p>And then she heard it again and again.</p>
<p>And finally, as the sound continued a couple more times, the realization of what she was</p>
<p>hearing hit her.</p>
<p>It was gunfire.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t tell exactly where the gunshots were coming from, but she could tell that</p>
<p>they were close, especially when she began to hear people screaming in the distance.</p>
<p>So she grabbed her phone and dialed 911.</p>
<p>But Georganne wasn&rsquo;t the only one.</p>
<p>As operators were taking her call, they were flooded with calls from other people in the</p>
<p>neighborhood who&rsquo;d heard the same gunfire.</p>
<p>And one caller could even tell them exactly where the shots were fired.</p>
<p>He said he was at a house party on Minneapolis Street when, out of the blue, someone started</p>
<p>The party erupted into chaos, and although he wasn&rsquo;t sure where the shooter was now,</p>
<p>the gunfire had stopped, and another partygoer was severely injured.</p>
<p>Emergency responders were immediately dispatched, but when they arrived, it took them a few</p>
<p>moments to gather their bearings.</p>
<p>There were at least 20, 25 people all scrambling to get into their cars, and rushing in and</p>
<p>out of the house.</p>
<p>Some were even fleeing on foot.</p>
<p>As officers from the Wichita Police Department started trying to control the crowd and get</p>
<p>a sense of what was going on, they came across a man lying on the ground near the front porch.</p>
<p>He was unresponsive and bleeding profusely from his torso.</p>
<p>That man was 31-year-old James Walker III.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, it was clear that James was in bad shape, so paramedics rushed him</p>
<p>to the hospital while officers called for backup from the homicide unit.</p>
<p>So we get called, obviously, if they are deceased at that time, they will call us.</p>
<p>They will also call us if the injuries are so bad they do not believe that they are survivable,</p>
<p>which again, nobody knows at that time.</p>
<p>And there are instances that we&rsquo;ve come in and we started to work a case like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>murder and that person does not die.</p>
<p>So like the gang unit would come in and kind of take over at that point.</p>
<p>That was Detective Addie Perkins of the WPD, who had been asleep at her home when the call</p>
<p>came in.</p>
<p>So while she got ready and made the half-hour drive into the city, officers at the scene</p>
<p>got to work trying to collect witness statements, but that was easier said than done.</p>
<p>Ideally, we try to find witnesses out on the scene that will come up here to City Hall,</p>
<p>to our offices to do interviews.</p>
<p>We like to have people separated so we get their very pure, their story.</p>
<p>In this situation, I know a lot of people were not cooperative and they did not want</p>
<p>to talk to us.</p>
<p>I think people sometimes are just scared.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t want to be involved.</p>
<p>They just want it to go away.</p>
<p>They want to go home.</p>
<p>They want to sleep.</p>
<p>They want to just move on with their lives.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to think about coming to court.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to think about people finding out that they talked to the police.</p>
<p>Despite this hesitancy, officers were eventually able to get statements from 11 people who</p>
<p>were at the house, including one guy who&rsquo;d called 911 and the host of the party.</p>
<p>It was this man named Antonio Birch.</p>
<p>And slowly, they were able to piece together a clearer picture of what went down leading</p>
<p>up to the shooting.</p>
<p>Antonio said that he was known for hosting family gatherings and neighborhood hangouts,</p>
<p>especially on nights like this.</p>
<p>It was early April, the weather was nice, and he&rsquo;d wanted to have a chill evening with</p>
<p>some friends.</p>
<p>This was them just getting together.</p>
<p>I do recall, and I couldn&rsquo;t even tell you who told us this, but there were people even</p>
<p>outside getting haircuts.</p>
<p>They were doing haircuts outside and eating and barbecuing and the kids were playing.</p>
<p>So this was just, I guess you could say, a normal gathering of people.</p>
<p>Antonio told police that James was dropped off at the house party at around 9 p.m.</p>
<p>And although I&rsquo;m not sure who dropped him off, he&rsquo;d only been there for about 20 minutes</p>
<p>before the shooting started.</p>
<p>Now Antonio said that he was inside when he heard the gunshot, so he didn&rsquo;t really see</p>
<p>what happened.</p>
<p>But several other witnesses said that James had been in the front yard when three men</p>
<p>approached the house from the south side of the street.</p>
<p>The men were wearing dark clothing and had their hoods flipped up to conceal their faces.</p>
<p>But no one paid much attention to them.</p>
<p>In fact, the witness who saw them told police that they just assumed they were there for</p>
<p>the party.</p>
<p>But then the three men stopped in front of the house on the edge of the street and each</p>
<p>pulled out a gun and opened fire.</p>
<p>Now that is when all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>People were darting into the house, diving behind cars and trees, literally running for</p>
<p>their lives.</p>
<p>Based on the various statements, officers determined that the number of gunshots averaged</p>
<p>between five and ten.</p>
<p>But in the midst of all the chaos, no one was able to get a good look at the shooters.</p>
<p>No one saw them leave either, leading police to believe that they had likely left on foot.</p>
<p>And devastatingly, no one even realized that James had been shot until well after the shooting</p>
<p>stopped and people began to come out of hiding.</p>
<p>Obviously, there was some type of planning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this was a long-term, very detailed plan.</p>
<p>Obviously if you&rsquo;re going to walk up, these are not just neighbors.</p>
<p>I mean, these are not people that probably live in that neighborhood that would put themselves</p>
<p>out there like that.</p>
<p>I think that they probably wanted to have more of a surprise type of factor.</p>
<p>A car people are going to notice, more people just walking up and down the street, maybe</p>
<p>not so much.</p>
<p>When they were able to take stock of what had happened, it seemed like James was the</p>
<p>only person who&rsquo;d been shot.</p>
<p>In fact, the only other injury that they had to attend to on scene was a woman who&rsquo;d sprained</p>
<p>her ankle trying to run away.</p>
<p>As they continued gathering witness statements, other officers searched the scene for evidence,</p>
<p>but there wasn&rsquo;t much.</p>
<p>A few shell casings and live rounds were scattered across the yard and driveway and street, and</p>
<p>the house itself had multiple bullet holes in its facade.</p>
<p>At this point, it was about 11.25 p.m., and Detective Perkins arrived at the house.</p>
<p>After being briefed on the situation, she got to work leading an initial canvas of the</p>
<p>neighborhood.</p>
<p>They were looking for anything, more bullets, blood, even security cameras.</p>
<p>I mean, this was happening in 2017, so luckily there were things like motion-sensor doorbells</p>
<p>that they could rely on.</p>
<p>So they went door to door, hopeful that someone&rsquo;s camera had captured video of the three men</p>
<p>coming or going.</p>
<p>But it was late, so a lot of their knocking went unanswered.</p>
<p>The problem is sometimes with that time of night, people have maybe gone back to bed.</p>
<p>They might not want to answer the door.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had people that were just too scared to answer the door.</p>
<p>Some people might be working night shift.</p>
<p>Some people might have, you know, maybe they sleep with earplugs in and they never heard</p>
<p>anything.</p>
<p>Maybe they talked to a neighbor and didn&rsquo;t realize that, you know, this had happened.</p>
<p>So sometimes we go back a second time, but initially, yes, we do try to go and knock</p>
<p>on as many doors in that area as we can.</p>
<p>An hour later, while they were still canvassing the area, Detective Perkins got a call from</p>
<p>officers who had gone to the hospital with James.</p>
<p>They said he had succumbed to his wounds and was pronounced dead at 1230 a.m.</p>
<p>Since the case was now a homicide, the reigns were officially passed to Detective Perkins,</p>
<p>and by 430 a.m., they&rsquo;d finished processing the neighborhood and the scene without uncovering</p>
<p>any new information.</p>
<p>Perkins spent the rest of the morning reviewing what little they had and talking to James'</p>
<p>family, who&rsquo;d arrived at the scene by then.</p>
<p>They were devastated, and his mom even asked to be interviewed later so she could just</p>
<p>have some time to grieve, to which Detective Perkins agreed.</p>
<p>And while Detective Perkins was waiting, she got a call from officers at another local</p>
<p>hospital, and they said there might be another victim from the shooting.</p>
<p>The officers tell Detective Perkins that around 11 that morning, a woman had brought a man</p>
<p>into the ER to be treated for a gunshot wound to his buttocks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear if the two were married or just dating, but either way, the bullet had gone</p>
<p>straight into the muscle and out the other side, so it wasn&rsquo;t life-threatening.</p>
<p>It was obviously a very fresh wound, though, and needed medical attention, but when the</p>
<p>hospital staff had asked them what happened, both the man and the woman were super cagey</p>
<p>and wouldn&rsquo;t give them any details.</p>
<p>So when a gunshot victim walks into a hospital, depending on how they tell the hospital or</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on, we are called.</p>
<p>So 911 is called for a walk-in shooting victim.</p>
<p>So an officer responds, and it sounds like that he told the officer, I got this from</p>
<p>the night before.</p>
<p>Thinking that the man could have been shot at the same house party, the responding officers</p>
<p>called Detective Perkins, who then went to the hospital to question the man herself.</p>
<p>His name was Jamaicus Ricks, and he admitted that, yeah, he was shot at the party the night</p>
<p>before, but the reason he didn&rsquo;t stick around or get treatment right then was because he</p>
<p>had some active warrants for a few undisclosed incidents, so instead he ran to avoid being</p>
<p>arrested, thinking maybe he could just tough it out.</p>
<p>I know sometimes gunshot wounds, depending on how close you are, sometimes it almost</p>
<p>cauterizes the skin, that hot lead and the hot metal.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not a medical expert, but that sometimes, you know, you see gunshot victims</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no blood, sometimes it&rsquo;s all internal.</p>
<p>I think in this, it&rsquo;s more of a flesh wound, probably, in his case, to where it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>debilitating as far as hitting any major organs, so that&rsquo;s probably why he was able to stick</p>
<p>it out for a while or live with it for, you know, several hours before he got medical treatment.</p>
<p>Jamaicus also had abrasions on his hands, knuckles, and face.</p>
<p>But his only explanation for those injuries was that he&rsquo;d gotten into a physical altercation</p>
<p>at the party.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know who he fought or when it took place in relation to the shooting,</p>
<p>because when Detective Perkins tried to ask follow-up questions, he shut down.</p>
<p>And the woman with him also refused to give up any more information.</p>
<p>So Detective Perkins was forced to move on, even though she believed he knew more than</p>
<p>he was saying.</p>
<p>I believe he knows what happened.</p>
<p>I think he was just not wanting to give us that information.</p>
<p>Despite Jamaicus&rsquo; refusal to cooperate, his appearance was crucial because it meant</p>
<p>that James wasn&rsquo;t the only victim, which meant maybe he wasn&rsquo;t the intended target</p>
<p>either.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t believe James was an intended target.</p>
<p>And Mr. Ricks, as far as I know, probably wasn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t feel like this was something that they knew he was going to that party</p>
<p>and were going to target him at that party or gathering.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t feel like that was probably the case.</p>
<p>I feel like if they wanted to shoot him, they could have shot him elsewhere with less witnesses.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many people there.</p>
<p>But again, on the other side of things, you know, people don&rsquo;t like to talk to the police.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want to be involved in court and in these cases.</p>
<p>So maybe they knew that if they did a shooting at a party like this with people that did</p>
<p>not want to cooperate with the police, that they would not have people coming forward.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re thinking that that detailed, but that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s how my mind</p>
<p>kind of works when I think about cases like that.</p>
<p>Even if neither James nor Jamaicus were the intended targets, someone obviously was.</p>
<p>And Detective Perkins hoped that talking to James&rsquo;s family would clear some things up.</p>
<p>So when they were ready, she sat down with his parents and his sister, Ebony, to get</p>
<p>a little more background information on who he was.</p>
<p>She learned that James was a Wichita native and was fairly well known in the community</p>
<p>for his amateur rap career.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d released several songs online and even had a music video on YouTube under the stage</p>
<p>name Montana YG, which Detective Perkins believes stood for Young Gangster.</p>
<p>Montana or Tan was one of his nicknames because he was as big as Montana.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he had that name.</p>
<p>He was a very large person.</p>
<p>Speaking with his mother, even though he was a big guy, he was kind of a teddy bear in</p>
<p>that aspect towards his mother, like any good boy should be towards their parents,</p>
<p>especially their mom.</p>
<p>She also learned that James had a criminal record.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been charged for drug possession a few times, had a misdemeanor weapons charge, and</p>
<p>was once charged of driving with a suspended license.</p>
<p>His family said that while he wasn&rsquo;t in a gang, he was friends with a lot of guys that</p>
<p>were gang members.</p>
<p>But despite all this, they couldn&rsquo;t think of anything specific in his life that would</p>
<p>make someone want to kill him.</p>
<p>So Detective Perkins figured her theory about James had to be right.</p>
<p>The shooter didn&rsquo;t come to the party to kill him specifically.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t put her any closer to figuring out who the target actually was, which meant</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t know the motive, and not having a motive made her job 10 times harder.</p>
<p>Any chance that she might find the motive or the intended target became even less likely</p>
<p>when James&rsquo; mom pulled her aside as she was leaving and gave her a warning.</p>
<p>She even told me, you&rsquo;re going to have problems with people talking.</p>
<p>I know the reality of the gang world and the gang life.</p>
<p>And I remember, you know, thinking that she&rsquo;s obviously very aware of the people that he</p>
<p>hangs out with and their views of talking to the police and these types of cases.</p>
<p>That statement would ring true as Detective Perkins spent the next few days trying to</p>
<p>re-interview people in a neighborhood, hoping that someone remembered something.</p>
<p>But house after house, no one would talk.</p>
<p>With no new leads to explore, Detective Perkins hit a roadblock.</p>
<p>And James&rsquo; case stayed stuck until about a month later when his autopsy report was</p>
<p>finalized.</p>
<p>It had taken longer than usual because they had to wait for the toxicology results, which</p>
<p>showed that James had marijuana and PCP in his system when he died.</p>
<p>The rest of the results were pretty much what Detective Perkins was expecting.</p>
<p>James&rsquo; cause of death was the five gunshot wounds to his torso, with the most damage</p>
<p>being caused by a bullet that had perforated his abdominal aorta.</p>
<p>He also had a gunshot wound to his left hand and a contusion on his upper right back area</p>
<p>that was likely from his body hitting the ground.</p>
<p>The coroner was able to recover a single bullet that was sent off for testing.</p>
<p>Those results came back in late spring, as did the results from the bullets and casings</p>
<p>collected at the scene.</p>
<p>The lab found that there were three different calibers of bullets, which actually lined</p>
<p>up with the witness accounts of there being three shooters.</p>
<p>With little else to go on, Detective Perkins entered the ballistics information she had</p>
<p>into the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network and waited.</p>
<p>It took some time, but a couple of months later, in October, she got several hits.</p>
<p>According to the NIBIN&rsquo;s database, the guns had been used in a couple different incidents</p>
<p>in Wichita from the year before, in 2016.</p>
<p>Luckily, the records included arrests and convictions, so Detective Perkins was able</p>
<p>to get a list of names of people who had used the firearms in those cases.</p>
<p>But any hope that she had that she&rsquo;d found James&rsquo; killers quickly faded when she realized</p>
<p>that in between these crimes, the firearms had changed hands multiple times.</p>
<p>Even though she didn&rsquo;t tell our reporter exactly how she was able to confirm this,</p>
<p>she believes that the weapons had changed hands again before 2017, and as a result,</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t able to connect any of these people on the list to James&rsquo; murder.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the hard part, is when you have numerous incidents and you have numerous</p>
<p>guns, they&rsquo;re obviously being passed from person to person.</p>
<p>From what we can tell, there was no direct connection to the homicide that we know of.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there probably is, but because people are not giving us all the information</p>
<p>on the entire story, we don&rsquo;t know how those people could be connected.</p>
<p>After the NIBIN results didn&rsquo;t lead to anything concrete, Detective Perkins officially hit</p>
<p>a dead end.</p>
<p>2017 turned into 2018, and although she kept in touch with James&rsquo; family, who periodically</p>
<p>gave her names of their own to explore, she was met with the same thing every time she</p>
<p>got a new lead.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Homicide is such an issue in this case, and that&rsquo;s been the consistent issue that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked to with the family, with the media.</p>
<p>It comes to a certain point I get information, but I just don&rsquo;t get enough to continue on</p>
<p>to pursue charges in this case.</p>
<p>In February 2018, she did get a ray of hope, though.</p>
<p>A call came in from an officer in Saline County, Kansas, about an hour and a half north, and</p>
<p>an officer there said an inmate at the county jail had information for her about James'</p>
<p>So, she went and met with this unnamed inmate.</p>
<p>And while he did claim to have information about James, his story was kind of all over</p>
<p>the place the first time they talked, so she went back to see him a second time to get</p>
<p>some clarity.</p>
<p>But by that point, his story had completely changed, and when she visited him a third</p>
<p>and final time in March, he&rsquo;d switched up his statement yet again.</p>
<p>Those interviews did not provide anything that I could use because of how different</p>
<p>they were.</p>
<p>They were just not consistent.</p>
<p>And I know that that would be an issue in court, when somebody&rsquo;s story changes so dramatically</p>
<p>numerous times.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m fine with somebody that gives me an interview and then maybe wants to add on</p>
<p>or, hey, I forgot, or I just remembered this, but that was not the case.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Detective Perkins realized this guy didn&rsquo;t have a real lead for her, but was</p>
<p>just looking to make a deal to reduce or improve his sentence.</p>
<p>People that are reaching out to us that are in custody sometimes want, think that if they</p>
<p>give us anything that they can maybe get out of jail free.</p>
<p>We make that very clear up front that that is something that we cannot do.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t make deals with people.</p>
<p>I can only take their information.</p>
<p>That same month, she was contacted by another inmate who also said that he had a lead to</p>
<p>share.</p>
<p>This guy was in Cedric County, which is the county Wichita is located in, so she hoped</p>
<p>that his story might have some real legs to it.</p>
<p>But this was deja vu all over again.</p>
<p>He refused to talk until she made a deal with him, which, of course, she wouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, that is where the case went cold for good.</p>
<p>Detective Perkins continued to keep in touch with James&rsquo; family over the years, but she</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t had anything new to share with them.</p>
<p>In 2022, investigators tried to breathe new life into the investigation by holding a big</p>
<p>press conference with local media.</p>
<p>And that is when they released the state&rsquo;s cold case deck with James featured as its</p>
<p>king of clubs.</p>
<p>But their efforts didn&rsquo;t bring in any new leads, and his case remains at a standstill.</p>
<p>And while not being able to bring James&rsquo; killers to justice has been immensely frustrating</p>
<p>for Detective Perkins, the greatest toll has been on James&rsquo; family.</p>
<p>His parents worry that they might never know the truth behind their son&rsquo;s death, a son</p>
<p>that many believed would have been a standout in his community if his life hadn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>cut short by senseless violence.</p>
<p>The way that the music industry has moved and with social media, I mean, it&rsquo;s changed</p>
<p>since 2017.</p>
<p>I could see that he would be very prevalent in the Wichita area, possibly.</p>
<p>And maybe he&rsquo;s one of those people that, you know, would work with our kids and our</p>
<p>youth of Wichita, too.</p>
<p>Not everybody does sports.</p>
<p>Not everybody is a football player.</p>
<p>Music is a big thing for people, for creative outlets.</p>
<p>So I would like to think that James would have been a productive member of society with</p>
<p>those kids.</p>
<p>I could see that he would be that, that big teddy bear that people would come to for that</p>
<p>advice.</p>
<p>No one knows something about who killed James, and Detective Perkins believes that it will</p>
<p>just take time for that person to come forward.</p>
<p>But when they do, she&rsquo;ll be ready.</p>
<p>Sometimes I hope that maybe that time will be beneficial down the road, that maybe somebody</p>
<p>that was there at the party, that maybe somebody&rsquo;s raising their own child and realizes, I need</p>
<p>to talk to the police, I need to tell them.</p>
<p>We can sit down in any setting.</p>
<p>We can meet in a parking lot.</p>
<p>You can come to my office very inconspicuously.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t promise that you will never have to go to court.</p>
<p>That is part of this.</p>
<p>That is part of this procedure and part of the justice.</p>
<p>But there are family members out there that are hoping that you will come forward to give</p>
<p>that answer and that closure to this family, because they&rsquo;ve lived in this horror and this</p>
<p>not knowing for years.</p>
<p>And reaching out to us, you know, even just a phone conversation to start out, I would</p>
<p>take that.</p>
<p>If you have any information about the murder of James Walker III in 2017, you can call</p>
<p>Detective Perkins&rsquo; direct line at the Wichita Police Department.</p>
<p>That number is 316-268-4379.</p>
