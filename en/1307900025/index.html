    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>I hear from many of you that say,</p>
<p>just turn on the microphone and talk,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be a good show, and we&rsquo;ll be glad to get it.</p>
<p>So today will perhaps be a test of this theory&rsquo;s validity.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s held up today&rsquo;s show for a while now</p>
<p>is probably some old training in the news business</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>Um, where, as a youngster learning the ropes,</p>
<p>you would come back to your editor with some facts,</p>
<p>some information, some quotes, uh, some background stuff,</p>
<p>um, and you&rsquo;d present it to them,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d say, okay, what&rsquo;s the story?</p>
<p>Right? Meaning, all these elements that you have</p>
<p>have the makings for a good news story,</p>
<p>but what are you trying to say?</p>
<p>I mean, is this a man bites dog story?</p>
<p>Or is it a dog bites man story? I mean, you know, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>A lot of the more complicated stories require</p>
<p>somebody telling you what the story is.</p>
<p>What does all this mean? Right?</p>
<p>All this information you&rsquo;re throwing my way.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to think?</p>
<p>And so I was trying to apply that to today&rsquo;s show,</p>
<p>and it just completely discombobulated</p>
<p>the entire thing, because I&rsquo;m not trying to tell you</p>
<p>what to think at all, nor do I have a point.</p>
<p>Sometimes, uh, I&rsquo;ll talk to people, you know,</p>
<p>via social media or whatever, and they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>uh, it&rsquo;d be fun to have dinner with you.</p>
<p>Well, this is what dinner might be like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just warning you.</p>
<p>Bunch of different things that have nothing to do</p>
<p>with anything else. I mean, I used to love</p>
<p>Larry King&rsquo;s newspaper column back in the 80s, 1980s.</p>
<p>Uh, at that time, Larry King was like the busiest man on Earth.</p>
<p>He did TV, he did radio, he did a newspaper column,</p>
<p>and, uh, looking at him now, I have no idea</p>
<p>how he accomplished it all, but he certainly organized</p>
<p>his projects in a way that, you know, took into account</p>
<p>how busy he was, because the newspaper column was,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t even know how to describe it to you.</p>
<p>Imagine 40 sentences, each sentence have no connection</p>
<p>to any of the other sentences in the piece.</p>
<p>So it would say something like,</p>
<p>uh, before President Reagan heads off to the summit</p>
<p>with the Soviet Union, he&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>at the summit with the Soviet Union, he needs to bear in mind,</p>
<p>you know, the words of, uh, Alexander Solzhenitsyn.</p>
<p>You know, and then the next one would be,</p>
<p>I love the way Jackie Kennedy&rsquo;s wearing her hair now,</p>
<p>it takes years off her life.</p>
<p>You know, it would just be like, you know,</p>
<p>the Yankees have won five in a row,</p>
<p>keep up this pace and they&rsquo;ll make the playoffs.</p>
<p>I mean, at the same time, you kind of understood</p>
<p>why he did it, right? It&rsquo;s a way for a very busy guy</p>
<p>to churn out a newspaper column.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s maybe what my thing is gonna sound like today.</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s all the elements of a good news story</p>
<p>without the reporter telling you what the story is.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know what the story is.</p>
<p>This actually started off as a completely different piece,</p>
<p>uh, with a bunch of different strands, all of whom&hellip;</p>
<p>all of which went nowhere.</p>
<p>Right? They just sort of drifted off into the ether.</p>
<p>Um, but they all at least emanated from the same point.</p>
<p>I thought that was progress. If I could just tie up</p>
<p>all those loose threads, we&rsquo;d have a heck of a show.</p>
<p>Uh, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve spent the last two weeks</p>
<p>trying to do. It doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;m trying to do this, as is normal</p>
<p>with an art project like this, it takes on a life of its own</p>
<p>and develops in an area completely, you know,</p>
<p>off in one direction from the original piece.</p>
<p>So I have a completely different show in front of me right now.</p>
<p>And much more in the way of notes</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;m accustomed to using. And I find that if you have</p>
<p>more than just a couple of notes, um,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less helpful than having no notes at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drowning in notes now. I don&rsquo;t even know where to look.</p>
<p>And none of it&rsquo;s, as I said, connected to anything else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole bunch of facts, figures, interviews,</p>
<p>quotes, and data, and no editor to tell me</p>
<p>what the heck the story is.</p>
<p>So let me ask, if we&rsquo;re reading the equivalent,</p>
<p>forget about, like, newspapers, and what do they say?</p>
<p>Journalism&rsquo;s the first draft of history.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about this less like the newspaper</p>
<p>and more like the history book.</p>
<p>And less like a human history book</p>
<p>than a great, giant, galactic history book, right?</p>
<p>The kind of history books that they&rsquo;re reading</p>
<p>on other planets about the history of this galaxy</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m wondering about the section</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to have on us.</p>
<p>Obviously, in a great galactic history book,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s just gonna be shrunk down</p>
<p>to a small little space, right? A little mention.</p>
<p>The poor students in galactic middle school</p>
<p>are gonna have to read about, you know,</p>
<p>Earth and humanity and all that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gonna be an extra credit, you know,</p>
<p>assignment on the back of a real test.</p>
<p>But, I mean, what do you think the great galactic history book</p>
<p>is gonna say in its Earth section</p>
<p>when it has to condense, you know, our entire existence</p>
<p>down to just, you know, a few points, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story here on this Earth humanity timeline question?</p>
<p>And I was thinking about that because the only way,</p>
<p>of course, to look at a subject like that</p>
<p>is through a very, you know, long lens, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just take 1520 A.D. and say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s base it on this year. What&rsquo;s humanity like?</p>
<p>You gotta take a big picture view, right?</p>
<p>Well, let me start this conversation,</p>
<p>this dinner conversation that goes nowhere,</p>
<p>off with a gift one of your number gave me</p>
<p>a long time ago now.</p>
<p>One of the greatest gifts I ever got.</p>
<p>A completely outside the box sort of thing,</p>
<p>and completely geared towards my own personal proclivities,</p>
<p>right? Being a history nut, uh, being a person from a country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, uh, had many successive waves of immigration</p>
<p>from other countries.</p>
<p>A person who is of multiple nationalities</p>
<p>like so many other Americans, and Canadians,</p>
<p>and Australians, and people like that, right?</p>
<p>Come from an immigrant country,</p>
<p>gonna have a lot of different people in you, probably.</p>
<p>So this listener sent me this wonderful gift.</p>
<p>It was an early version of the DNA ancestry test,</p>
<p>the genealogy tests.</p>
<p>Now, these things are everywhere now,</p>
<p>but this was long before the craze hit.</p>
<p>Very early on, very outside the box.</p>
<p>Not cheap.</p>
<p>And I was so intrigued by the possibilities</p>
<p>that I overcame my natural reticence</p>
<p>to sharing my genetic code with anyone.</p>
<p>Swabbed my cheek, or whatever the heck</p>
<p>they were asking for back then.</p>
<p>Put it back in the mailing, uh, packet,</p>
<p>send it to the lab, and waited with bated breath</p>
<p>for the results here to find out exactly how closely</p>
<p>the DNA evidence matched the analog family tree history</p>
<p>that, like many of you, I had also done.</p>
<p>Talk to your grandmothers and grandfathers</p>
<p>about who your, you know, deep ancestors were,</p>
<p>what countries did we come from, what ethnicities are we?</p>
<p>And I thought I had the math right.</p>
<p>I could say, well, if your grandmother</p>
<p>on your mother&rsquo;s side is half this and half that,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re 12% this.</p>
<p>And, I mean, I thought I had it figured out,</p>
<p>but I wanted confirmation that my math was right.</p>
<p>So I sent away to the DNA test.</p>
<p>And when it came back to me and I opened it up,</p>
<p>it was nothing like what I expected.</p>
<p>Instead of answering questions about things like my ethnicity,</p>
<p>or the percentage of each ethnic group I belong to,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t deal with ethnicity at all.</p>
<p>When I opened up this packet of results,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going, you know, I&rsquo;m not, this isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just putting in fake numbers here,</p>
<p>but I mean, it was something akin to,</p>
<p>uh, you open it up and it says,</p>
<p>your ancestors moved out of Africa 150,000 years ago</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s now southern Russia.</p>
<p>They lingered there for another 50,000 years</p>
<p>before heading, I mean, it was one of those sorts of things.</p>
<p>In other words, it was deep genealogy, deep ancestry.</p>
<p>It never even got to the point</p>
<p>where modern ethnicities developed.</p>
<p>Right? Stopped before then.</p>
<p>So instead of finding out exactly how Irish,</p>
<p>or Scandinavian, or whatever it might be you were,</p>
<p>um, all you found out about was what you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know, the equivalent of your caveman ancestors were doing.</p>
<p>And at first I was disappointed,</p>
<p>because this was not what I was expecting,</p>
<p>nor what I was after, but I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity</p>
<p>many times since to think about this.</p>
<p>To think what this DNA test was reminding me about.</p>
<p>It was reminding me about how long</p>
<p>anatomically modern human beings have been around.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to remember this,</p>
<p>because it is the vast, vast majority</p>
<p>of, you know, the time that we&rsquo;ve spent on this planet</p>
<p>that happened before we started paying any real attention</p>
<p>to ourselves in the history books.</p>
<p>And by that I mean, you know how old your history books are</p>
<p>in terms of how far back they go, right?</p>
<p>Now, modern history combines with archaeology</p>
<p>and anthropology and about a hundred other wonderful</p>
<p>modern scientific specialists,</p>
<p>whose job it is to uncover the prehistoric past,</p>
<p>but traditionally, history started with writing.</p>
<p>And writing started with urban societies.</p>
<p>And so, you know, the history books I have from 1950</p>
<p>start with, like, Mesopotamia and Sumeria.</p>
<p>The implication, not the stated&hellip;</p>
<p>necessarily, sometimes stated, but usually not stated,</p>
<p>is that nothing of real value happened</p>
<p>before urbanism and writing and all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>And there was also this implied idea</p>
<p>that anything of value that even happened afterwards</p>
<p>happened in the societies that were doing these things</p>
<p>that set these new modern humans apart</p>
<p>from all the humans that came beforehand, right?</p>
<p>The humans that existed before cities and writing</p>
<p>and complex modern societies.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the vast, vast, vast majority of time, right?</p>
<p>Anatomically modern human beings have been around,</p>
<p>and this is the current number. The current number changes.</p>
<p>Right? It keeps getting revised earlier and earlier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna try to be really safe here and say,</p>
<p>anatomically modern human beings have been around</p>
<p>from between 250,000 and 350,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Let that sink in for a minute.</p>
<p>250,000 to 350,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just take 300,000 as a good, round, current number.</p>
<p>300,000 years. Now, this doesn&rsquo;t take into account</p>
<p>previous versions of humanity,</p>
<p>which lived at the same time. There&rsquo;s some overlap, right?</p>
<p>Neanderthals are here when modern human beings are, too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s interbreeding going on, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another fascinating part of human history.</p>
<p>But so, we have anatomically modern human beings</p>
<p>300,000 years ago.</p>
<p>I was doing some preliminary research for this</p>
<p>just so I didn&rsquo;t sound like too much of an idiot.</p>
<p>And there was a distinction made with anthropologists</p>
<p>between anatomically modern human beings</p>
<p>and behaviorally modern human beings.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not sure what that necessarily means,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;re talking about things like use of fire,</p>
<p>and that sort of deal. I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>but even that was suitably ancient.</p>
<p>Something like 150,000 years ago,</p>
<p>just for comparison&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Now, if we remember that the human history</p>
<p>that our history books from 1950 would have said began,</p>
<p>began about 5,000 or 6,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Well, when you have 300,000 years that you&rsquo;re playing with,</p>
<p>5,000 or 6,000 years is the very most recent edge</p>
<p>of that entire history, right?</p>
<p>The vast, vast majority of the history of the human species</p>
<p>predates where your history books start.</p>
<p>And there are, well, there are probably multiple ways</p>
<p>of looking at this, but let me just look at it</p>
<p>in sort of a pass-fail way, right? Two ways.</p>
<p>One way of looking at this is that all of human activity</p>
<p>going on before what my 1950s history book</p>
<p>would consider to be the important time</p>
<p>when things get started, although they might have said</p>
<p>the important time is the agricultural revolution,</p>
<p>right, a date that also keeps getting pushed back.</p>
<p>But that would still mean the vast majority</p>
<p>of human history happened before the agricultural revolution.</p>
<p>The point is, is that if you try to envision</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in that period before, you know,</p>
<p>real history begins, it can either be something</p>
<p>like a more complex version of, like, chimpanzee life, right?</p>
<p>What societies of chimpanzees live like</p>
<p>and what their daily activities are concerned with</p>
<p>and their social structure. I mean, obviously,</p>
<p>more complex, like chimpanzees with fire,</p>
<p>chimpanzees with very modest religious,</p>
<p>you know, understandings. More complex chimps, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s very possible.</p>
<p>You go look at, you know, cavemen,</p>
<p>in air quotes, caveman society, that looks a little to me</p>
<p>like complex apes, but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>have to be that way. There&rsquo;s also, like,</p>
<p>the Middle Earth possibility. And, you know,</p>
<p>for those who don&rsquo;t know, Tolkien&rsquo;s, J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Lord of the Rings idea of this thing called Middle Earth</p>
<p>is not a place. Middle Earth is a time period</p>
<p>in our own world. And it&rsquo;s supposed to have existed</p>
<p>before the so-called Age of Man began.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s deep prehistory. And I guess with the Age of Man</p>
<p>beginning, you know, Sumeria&rsquo;s in their future.</p>
<p>Well, based on this idea, is the idea that there might have been</p>
<p>all kinds of fascinating things going on</p>
<p>in terms of the great human story.</p>
<p>Just maybe on a much smaller scale, right?</p>
<p>As much smaller venue, a much more tight locality,</p>
<p>but the same sorts of drama and romances and great wars</p>
<p>and big leaders and heroes and villains.</p>
<p>And, I mean, in other words, the exact same human story</p>
<p>we have in the last 6,000 years of human history,</p>
<p>just earlier, smaller.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that old line that quantity has a quality all its own.</p>
<p>Well, 300,000 years of history seems to give you enough time</p>
<p>for a bunch of good stories to happen,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re happening, you know, in a much slower pace</p>
<p>than they happen in the modern world, I would think.</p>
<p>If that great galactic history book, you know,</p>
<p>it had the aliens monitoring the first 300,000 years</p>
<p>of human history, maybe they have some good stories in it</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know anything about.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve often wondered about the, you know,</p>
<p>greatness of prehistory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a line from Gwynne Dyer&rsquo;s fabulous, um,</p>
<p>late 70s, early 1980s, uh, documentary on war</p>
<p>where he had wondered about the first time</p>
<p>1,000 human beings had ever gathered</p>
<p>in the same place at the same time.</p>
<p>You know, a very early prehistory question.</p>
<p>And he thought it likely that the first time</p>
<p>1,000 people were ever in the same place at the same time,</p>
<p>it was because a battle was happening.</p>
<p>And that makes you think of all the prehistoric battles, right?</p>
<p>When was the first time an army of 500 men</p>
<p>absolutely knocked everybody over in terms of its size?</p>
<p>Wow, did you&hellip; 500 men, can you believe it?</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s ever had an army that big.</p>
<p>Or the first great empire, even on a&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, the first great empire might have been</p>
<p>20 miles long and five miles wide and&hellip;</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s the biggest amount of territory</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever been controlled by one people over another,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an empire, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>By the strict definition of the terms.</p>
<p>So I think about all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Who was the first great king?</p>
<p>And we have to remember, too, when it comes to things like</p>
<p>so-called prehistory, prehistory and history</p>
<p>happen at different times in different places, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Just because history started in a place like Sumeria</p>
<p>in 3200 BCE, it&rsquo;s still dark as heck in terms of prehistory.</p>
<p>Not that far away from Sumeria, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to talk about the various nomadic tribes</p>
<p>living outside the walls of a city like Ur or something.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s still prehistory in their community, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>And that applies all the way up to modern times.</p>
<p>I mean, the history of Native American</p>
<p>or African tribal peoples that didn&rsquo;t pay attention</p>
<p>to writing or didn&rsquo;t write,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all stuff that&rsquo;s dark to us now.</p>
<p>Their history begins when it starts being written down</p>
<p>by somebody themselves or some outsider group.</p>
<p>Makes you think about all the history that existed</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t get written down.</p>
<p>So I think about this all the time, though,</p>
<p>and ever since that DNA test,</p>
<p>specifically because I try to keep track</p>
<p>of what I like to call the long view.</p>
<p>Right? Looking at history in terms of&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d probably say in one of the new kinds of books</p>
<p>that get marketed all the time, the megatrends, right?</p>
<p>But there are certain elements of human behavior</p>
<p>and conduct and activity and what one might say</p>
<p>make up the general pieces of information</p>
<p>in the great galactic history book</p>
<p>that implies that there is some kind of story, right?</p>
<p>We have lots of facts and interviews and data,</p>
<p>but the, you know, galactic history book writer</p>
<p>of the future is going to have to try to come up,</p>
<p>because his editor&rsquo;s going to make him,</p>
<p>with what it all means.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking about these human beings</p>
<p>on this planet for several hundred thousand years,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the story?</p>
<p>I was writing down some of the things</p>
<p>that just seem to be constants with us.</p>
<p>Because some problems, of course, are temporary,</p>
<p>others are created by circumstances</p>
<p>in your time period, but some just seem to be ever-present,</p>
<p>no matter, you know, how long the lens</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re viewing our past is.</p>
<p>I mean, there seems to always be war and conflict.</p>
<p>There is no sustained period of time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever seen where people aren&rsquo;t fighting.</p>
<p>There used to be an idea,</p>
<p>and this is because both history and many other disciplines</p>
<p>are connected to the trends of human society</p>
<p>during the time period that they arise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a famous problem in history, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Main thing they try to teach you in historiography</p>
<p>is how the heck do you weed out the corruption</p>
<p>that the historians operating within their own time period,</p>
<p>as we all do, infuse into how they&rsquo;re assessing</p>
<p>the material, right?</p>
<p>How do you divorce the historian</p>
<p>and the times that they&rsquo;re working in</p>
<p>from the times that they&rsquo;re assessing?</p>
<p>And this is a problem that we all have, even today, right?</p>
<p>And when I was a kid, it was during this period</p>
<p>where there were quite a few people</p>
<p>who were trying to insinuate that something like war</p>
<p>and conflict between human beings,</p>
<p>especially organized conflict,</p>
<p>was something that only developed with cities.</p>
<p>That we lived a more Garden of Eden-type existence,</p>
<p>a more gathering of the tribes kind of existence,</p>
<p>before cities ruined it all for everybody.</p>
<p>And that man, or woman, or humanity,</p>
<p>in their natural state, is of a peaceful, helping nature.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s enough stuff today, I would say,</p>
<p>and this is my own personal bias coming in,</p>
<p>because I choose the sources, as we all do,</p>
<p>that sound right to me.</p>
<p>But put me in the camp of those anthropologists</p>
<p>and archaeologists who&rsquo;ve come out and said,</p>
<p>uh, the evidence seems to indicate</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a pretty murderous species.</p>
<p>And that we were a pretty murderous species</p>
<p>before someone started writing down</p>
<p>exactly how murderous we were.</p>
<p>War, and human conflict, and genocide,</p>
<p>and things like ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>This stuff seems to have always been with us.</p>
<p>And if you doubt the ability of, you know,</p>
<p>peoples in a much lower state of organized development</p>
<p>to be that way, just go look at Chimpanzee Society now.</p>
<p>You watch chimpanzees for a while,</p>
<p>and you get a pretty darn good idea of just how murderous</p>
<p>and hierarchical and everything else we could be,</p>
<p>because the chimpanzees, I mean, it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>holding up an embarrassing mirror when you go watch them,</p>
<p>because you go, wow, I see all these same elements</p>
<p>still in us today.</p>
<p>We may think of ourselves so far removed,</p>
<p>but certain of the base level things seem pretty unchanged,</p>
<p>if you ask me.</p>
<p>And war, and conflict, and domination,</p>
<p>and those sorts of things seem to be pretty developed</p>
<p>in Chimpanzee Society, especially for a bunch</p>
<p>of non-humans, and I think we still exhibit</p>
<p>those things today, so that&rsquo;s a pretty much of a constant</p>
<p>when I try to gain some perspective on humanity</p>
<p>as a species over the long view.</p>
<p>Ethnicity and immigration.</p>
<p>These are things that are still a big part</p>
<p>of news stories today.</p>
<p>You could throw colonialization in there, too,</p>
<p>and these things seem to be ever-present</p>
<p>in the historical chronicles, too,</p>
<p>and seem likely to have existed before history did as well.</p>
<p>Right? Same things we have problems with.</p>
<p>And one of the great things about the long view,</p>
<p>I feel like, is the fact that it absolutely takes</p>
<p>the ethnicity issue and makes it a non-issue</p>
<p>over the long haul, because what people&hellip;</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve been&hellip;</p>
<p>maybe corrupted is not a bad way to put it,</p>
<p>corrupted by 19th and early 20th century historiography.</p>
<p>And the fact that just as it always is,</p>
<p>history and history writing, and history research,</p>
<p>and history teaching is intimately wound up</p>
<p>and intertwined with the values and attitudes</p>
<p>of the time period where the writing, the teaching,</p>
<p>and the reading is going on, right?</p>
<p>And in the 19th century especially,</p>
<p>you have a time period where nation states</p>
<p>are in search of their roots.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing their own national version</p>
<p>of my DNA ethnicity test.</p>
<p>Trying to find out where they come from.</p>
<p>But a lot of this isn&rsquo;t just an open-ended,</p>
<p>uh, in search of and we&rsquo;ll go wherever the data leads</p>
<p>this kind of thing. It&rsquo;s goal-oriented.</p>
<p>I mean, everyone wants to come from some wonderfully&hellip;</p>
<p>august, glorious, historical lineage.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to be the descendants</p>
<p>of a couple of peasants, or a couple of serfs.</p>
<p>We all want to be, um, you know, descended</p>
<p>from great peoples and kings and, you know,</p>
<p>societies that made an impact on the past, right?</p>
<p>We all want royal lineage, historically speaking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the 19th century spawned all these,</p>
<p>you know, connections to pre-nation states.</p>
<p>I mean, the French started glorifying</p>
<p>their Gallic past. The Germans, you know,</p>
<p>their Germanic histories. And you go look</p>
<p>at the statues they put up,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wonderfully romantic figures, right?</p>
<p>But how&rsquo;s that any different from, uh,</p>
<p>modern-day Italians celebrating their Roman past,</p>
<p>or current Greek citizens celebrating</p>
<p>their famous ancient Greek history,</p>
<p>and on and on and on, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hardly the only ones. I mean, a lot of people</p>
<p>were infected by this 19th century, um, desire</p>
<p>to tie one&rsquo;s modern people to some ancient ancestor,</p>
<p>some glorious, exalted ancient ancestor.</p>
<p>I mean, the Kurds, um, there&rsquo;s a belief</p>
<p>in Kurdish society that their descendants</p>
<p>of the ancient Medes, right, partners in empire</p>
<p>with the ancient Persians.</p>
<p>Syrians today believe themselves,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen articles that back them up on this,</p>
<p>and articles that disagree, so I can&rsquo;t make an opinion,</p>
<p>but Syrians today consider themselves</p>
<p>to be the descendants of the ancient Assyrians.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody&rsquo;s looking for glorious ancestors, right?</p>
<p>And the truth is, is some people have them.</p>
<p>I mean, DNA seems to show, uh, waiting, as always,</p>
<p>when we talk about DNA, for more evidence,</p>
<p>but DNA seems to show that a lot of Jewish people today</p>
<p>are descendant from Jewish people</p>
<p>who lived thousands of years ago,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>
<p>One can come from an illustrious, glorious past,</p>
<p>but in the 19th century, the implication almost was</p>
<p>that peoples were hermetically sealed off from each other,</p>
<p>and you had these different peoples.</p>
<p>A perfect example would be, uh, look at how the Nazis,</p>
<p>although Nazi ideology, when it came to race and ethnicity,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t so much singular as it was past itself by date.</p>
<p>Because if you take a Nazi racial philosophy,</p>
<p>and, you know, taken it a hundred years into its own past,</p>
<p>there would&rsquo;ve been a lot of people</p>
<p>who would&rsquo;ve thought the same way as the Nazis.</p>
<p>And the Nazis had a belief that people were pure of blood, right?</p>
<p>And you pick up a history book from the late 18, early 1900s,</p>
<p>and you look at exactly how obsessed it is</p>
<p>with ethnicity and race and peoples,</p>
<p>and, you know, where their background is</p>
<p>in terms of their breeding,</p>
<p>and these people are Nordic,</p>
<p>and these people are Slavic, and these people are, uh, Mongolian.</p>
<p>And, I mean, the&hellip; It&rsquo;s an absurd amount of fascination</p>
<p>when the great galactic history book readers</p>
<p>are gonna try to make sense of what humanity was.</p>
<p>And the reason it&rsquo;s absurd is because of how temporary it all is</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re taking the long view.</p>
<p>Races and ethnicities are some of the long views version</p>
<p>of short-term issues, because they&rsquo;re ever-changing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the 19th century,</p>
<p>both peoples, cultures, and historians got wrong,</p>
<p>was this idea that somehow, you know,</p>
<p>once upon a time on the world stage,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just pick one people,</p>
<p>but you could fill anybody in for the same thing.</p>
<p>That there were a bunch of blonde-haired, blue-eyed peoples</p>
<p>that, you know, arose independently,</p>
<p>although back in that time period,</p>
<p>we might&rsquo;ve been talking about Adam and Eve-type origins,</p>
<p>but you know what I&rsquo;m saying, arose independently</p>
<p>in the North where they&rsquo;re still to be found,</p>
<p>and then sometime in relatively recent history,</p>
<p>they started having interactions with other peoples</p>
<p>and ethnic societies,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when interbreeding started.</p>
<p>In other words, from a Hitlerian, Nazi-istic,</p>
<p>you know, race-traitor standpoint,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when things turned evil.</p>
<p>It was much better back in the days</p>
<p>when blonde-haired, blue-eyed people</p>
<p>never mated with people who weren&rsquo;t of their own kind.</p>
<p>Became what the Harry Potter world</p>
<p>would refer to as mudbloods.</p>
<p>Totally ignoring the fact that we&rsquo;re all mudbloods.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the great secrets and pieces of perspective</p>
<p>that the long view gives us,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that the current ethnicities</p>
<p>as we identify them are temporary things.</p>
<p>Long-term things from our short-term way of looking at it.</p>
<p>I mean, if I&rsquo;m gonna live to be 90 years old,</p>
<p>ethnicity seems pretty set in stone to me.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m gonna live to be 200,000 years old,</p>
<p>every ethnicity I see is a passing fad.</p>
<p>There was a story I read, um&hellip;</p>
<p>not that long ago, and it was in a&hellip;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t in a professional publication.</p>
<p>It was something like the BBC or something.</p>
<p>It was a public thing.</p>
<p>But they were talking about a facial recreation</p>
<p>that had been done on a skeleton,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much of a skeleton,</p>
<p>uh, known in Britain as Cheddar Man.</p>
<p>And Cheddar Man is a figure from prehistory,</p>
<p>and they found, uh, this figure in Britain,</p>
<p>and I believe they&rsquo;ve done DNA.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t remember the story well.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go look it up.</p>
<p>Shows you how much prep went into this, right?</p>
<p>Trying to figure out what the story is</p>
<p>without, you know, checking the facts of the story.</p>
<p>But the news story was, and they always say,</p>
<p>a dog bites man story is not a news story,</p>
<p>but a man bites dog story, now that&rsquo;s news, right?</p>
<p>Well, the Cheddar Man story probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been</p>
<p>as big of a deal had this facial recreation</p>
<p>I guess it was like a forensic person</p>
<p>who works maybe with murder victims or something today.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re taking the DNA and the skulls</p>
<p>and whatever they have to work with,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re giving you this recreation</p>
<p>of a face of a prehistoric Britain,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t look anything like the British people today.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t look like a very, you know,</p>
<p>good representation of the Kentish Anglo-Saxon type,</p>
<p>because it had dark, dark skin.</p>
<p>Dark, dark hair.</p>
<p>And maybe, if I&rsquo;m recalling it, blue or green eyes,</p>
<p>or the light eyes.</p>
<p>In other words, it was a completely different ethnicity</p>
<p>than one would expect to see as an ancestor of the people</p>
<p>in a place where it&rsquo;s assumed to be cold and dark,</p>
<p>and the people have very light skin, very light hair.</p>
<p>Although a lot of Celts don&rsquo;t have light hair.</p>
<p>But you know what I&rsquo;m saying, there&rsquo;s a certain type</p>
<p>we associate with the British Isles.</p>
<p>The problem is that our view on this is skewed</p>
<p>by the timeline.</p>
<p>Because if you went back to the British Isles</p>
<p>at around the time Cheddar Man was actually living,</p>
<p>you would expect to see something different,</p>
<p>because back then, something different was living there</p>
<p>than the type of people that live there now.</p>
<p>And the reason why is because of that eternal human quality</p>
<p>that makes up one of those constants.</p>
<p>When we look at the long view of history, people move.</p>
<p>And they intermix with each other while they do.</p>
<p>My DNA test that showed that, you know,</p>
<p>I came out of Africa, or my ancestors did 150,000 years ago,</p>
<p>or whatever it was, is something that&rsquo;s going to be the same</p>
<p>for most, if not all, of us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be some people that probably still live</p>
<p>in the place where humankind first became</p>
<p>anatomically modern.</p>
<p>They can say, we are the indigenous inhabitants</p>
<p>of this place, because when humanity first arose,</p>
<p>we were here, and we&rsquo;ve never moved.</p>
<p>The vast majority of us have.</p>
<p>The implications for that, though, if you think about it,</p>
<p>are profound, but only if we&rsquo;re looking at this</p>
<p>through the long view.</p>
<p>And this gets me to a phrase that I&rsquo;d like to jettison</p>
<p>from my lexicon, but it&rsquo;s going to be hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to need&hellip; I&rsquo;m addicted to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to need some kind of patch or something</p>
<p>to help me get through the process</p>
<p>of weaning myself off a phrase.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a phrase that I use,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m falling out of love with it,</p>
<p>and I like other phrases better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to put it.</p>
<p>The phrase is indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Now, I use this phrase as many other people do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the Native Americans, for example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say the indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m falling out of love with this phrase.</p>
<p>I think I like the way the people in Canada</p>
<p>treat it better. They call their Native American</p>
<p>tribal peoples, they call them First Nations.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a better representation</p>
<p>of what the term should mean.</p>
<p>Because indigenous peoples gets me into trouble</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m looking at things through my long-term,</p>
<p>long-view lens.</p>
<p>Because that implies that we&rsquo;re all indigenous</p>
<p>to somewhere, right? So, if you say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m not a tribal Aboriginal person.</p>
<p>My family comes from a bunch of different places.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s their homeland, right? Where am I indigenous to?</p>
<p>And you quickly can see what the problem</p>
<p>in that sort of an approach might be,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that people move, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t live where my ancestors lived.</p>
<p>Am I indigenous to where my ancestors were from?</p>
<p>Well, when did they get there?</p>
<p>And how long do you have to be someplace</p>
<p>to be considered indigenous to it?</p>
<p>Because as we just said, according to the long-term</p>
<p>DNA test, we&rsquo;re all indigenous to like Northeastern Africa.</p>
<p>And once you leave there, well, you&rsquo;re either</p>
<p>the first person to arrive someplace,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re squatting on somebody else&rsquo;s land</p>
<p>that got there before you did.</p>
<p>300,000 years of human history,</p>
<p>with people moving and intermixing all the time,</p>
<p>means that almost nobody is probably on the land</p>
<p>that they inhabited first, before anyone else got there.</p>
<p>Now, the First Nations in Canada,</p>
<p>I just assume that they&rsquo;re the first people</p>
<p>in that part of the world to establish hierarchies</p>
<p>and governments and some sort of an organization,</p>
<p>you know, tribal organization or whatever.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>But this indigenous people&rsquo;s thing gets complicated.</p>
<p>Ethnicity does too. I mean, I was looking for&hellip;</p>
<p>I was doing some searches, but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out</p>
<p>the right search terms to spit back the results</p>
<p>that I wanted. I was trying to find a person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s up on the latest DNA and isotope evidence</p>
<p>and everything else that can help us answer a question</p>
<p>about how many people who inhabit certain</p>
<p>geographical areas today are related to the people</p>
<p>that used to be there. And of course, you&rsquo;ve got to define</p>
<p>what you mean by used to, right?</p>
<p>But I was specifically thinking of like, Roman times.</p>
<p>So are the people in Italy, or maybe the question should be</p>
<p>how many of the people in Italy today can trace</p>
<p>their genetic heritage back to ancient Rome?</p>
<p>And I was starting to play with that.</p>
<p>And then the long view question hit me again, though,</p>
<p>in a shorter term sense.</p>
<p>But which Rome are we even talking about?</p>
<p>Which Rome are we even talking about?</p>
<p>I thought to myself after I&rsquo;d posed the question to myself.</p>
<p>Because the Rome of like 450 BCE,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s a single city-state at war</p>
<p>with other Italian city-states 10 or 12 miles from itself,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s one kind of Italy, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Made up of one kind of people.</p>
<p>But the Rome of, say, Tiberius or Marcus Aurelius,</p>
<p>you know, the Roman Empire, well, that&rsquo;s a multi-ethnic,</p>
<p>multicultural society, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>With not just people from all over the world.</p>
<p>You know, Rome&rsquo;s an international city back then.</p>
<p>But even the emperors coming from places like Spain</p>
<p>and the Balkans and North Africa and Syria.</p>
<p>I mean, all those places are contributing</p>
<p>leadership positions to the Roman state.</p>
<p>So if I was to say something like, well, how many people</p>
<p>in Italy today can trace their roots back to the Roman Empire?</p>
<p>Some person who just got there one generation ago from Syria</p>
<p>might be able to say, I can.</p>
<p>So you gotta be careful, because people were moving around</p>
<p>and interbreeding all the time.</p>
<p>This idea of race purity that the Nazis had</p>
<p>was a bunch of nonsense.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s worth looking for just two seconds</p>
<p>upon how something like that gets started.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book out there, it&rsquo;s a pretty darn good one, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called&hellip; The title is something like,</p>
<p>The Most Dangerous Book Ever Written,</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a book about Tacitus&rsquo; work on the Germans.</p>
<p>Now, Tacitus was an ancient Roman writer,</p>
<p>actually, he was a Roman imperial writer.</p>
<p>And he wrote a famous book on the ancient Germanic tribes,</p>
<p>right, contemporaries of the Romans.</p>
<p>Well, the Nazis, in their wisdom to try to find racial history,</p>
<p>latched onto this book, because there&rsquo;s parts of it</p>
<p>that talk about something that they could use</p>
<p>as evidence of race purity.</p>
<p>Because Tacitus says in one part,</p>
<p>that the Germans never mingled their blood</p>
<p>with lesser people.</p>
<p>Now, The Most Dangerous Book points out</p>
<p>what any good history professor talking about Tacitus&rsquo; book</p>
<p>would also point out, and that&rsquo;s that Tacitus,</p>
<p>just like most ancient writers, is not writing books</p>
<p>for the same reason we write books,</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t assume that he is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually writing a book to chastise Romans</p>
<p>about things that they do,</p>
<p>and he uses this Germanic stuff as evidence for,</p>
<p>look at how they do it, and they&rsquo;re so strong.</p>
<p>If we did it more like them, we&rsquo;d be&hellip;</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s making a case with something.</p>
<p>This idea that the Germans didn&rsquo;t mix their DNA</p>
<p>with other people during the Roman era</p>
<p>is nonsense, because the Germans, like, almost&hellip;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to say every human society,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not true,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of human societies,</p>
<p>and this is another thing that maybe, you know,</p>
<p>belongs on our list of constants, is slavery.</p>
<p>The Germans were a slave-holding society.</p>
<p>If you have slaves, you&rsquo;re going to be mixing your DNA with them.</p>
<p>Another example of, you know, how you can sort of be blind</p>
<p>to this obvious fact, I mean, if you look at</p>
<p>some of the great kings from the past</p>
<p>that would have been Nazi racial ideological, um&hellip;</p>
<p>prototypes, right?</p>
<p>The kind of people they were celebrating.</p>
<p>How about, and this is a bit of a spoiler alert</p>
<p>for the Viking show still to come,</p>
<p>but how about the famous Danish king,</p>
<p>Knut?</p>
<p>The king that ruled much of Scandinavia</p>
<p>while he ruled England.</p>
<p>He seemed to be creating this giant&hellip;</p>
<p>Theoretically, had it continued, you could have had</p>
<p>this giant northern block of nations, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sort of the Nazis&rsquo; iconic dream</p>
<p>of, you know, the Nordic peoples ruling over vast areas.</p>
<p>But this Danish king&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>had the Nazis done the classifying</p>
<p>would have been seen as an untermenschen, a subhuman.</p>
<p>Knut&rsquo;s mom was from a Slavic people.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, you&hellip; My history books often say Polish king,</p>
<p>but this predates the creation of a real Poland.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a Slavic king, and Knut&rsquo;s parents married&hellip;</p>
<p>into a dynastic marriage.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the other thing you forget.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just people at the lower end of society,</p>
<p>the slaves mixing their DNA into the gene pool.</p>
<p>Royal marriages of the sort that were famous</p>
<p>100, 200 years ago, where you would marry, you know,</p>
<p>your son off to another king&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>to try to cement a dynastic relationship,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been going on from time immemorial.</p>
<p>In fact, romantic love is the new kind of reason</p>
<p>people get married.</p>
<p>Creating dynastic relationships between powerful families</p>
<p>is the really old, ancient reason that people get married.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re mixing their DNA at the very highest level</p>
<p>so these ideas of taciturn&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, the Germans never mingled their blood</p>
<p>with lesser peoples, unless, of course,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re marrying the queens of lesser peoples</p>
<p>and creating, you know, dynastic alliances.</p>
<p>I mean, in other words, all of that stuff is ridiculous,</p>
<p>and people have been mixing from time immemorial</p>
<p>and moving from time immemorial,</p>
<p>and that means that none of the peoples</p>
<p>who are in the locations that they are now</p>
<p>probably used to be there, and they almost certainly,</p>
<p>just like Cheddar Man in Britain, looked differently.</p>
<p>I mean, just look at some of the mass people movements</p>
<p>that we have in the 6,000 years of recorded history.</p>
<p>And the good news for those of us wanting to look back</p>
<p>on those moments is that they&rsquo;re often extremely disruptive</p>
<p>of the status quo during the time period</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And, you know, they&rsquo;ve always said that journalism</p>
<p>is the first draft of history.</p>
<p>Well, history writing often follows similar rules.</p>
<p>In the old line, if it bleeds, it leads.</p>
<p>Works just as well for history as it did for,</p>
<p>you know, current news writing.</p>
<p>And many of the moments in history</p>
<p>where the if it bleeds, it leads standard most applies</p>
<p>are these time periods where vast numbers</p>
<p>of human beings are on the move.</p>
<p>I mean, is the most famous the one where</p>
<p>the Germanic tribes were set in motion?</p>
<p>The famous Volker Wanderung, right?</p>
<p>The movement of peoples, the great migrations</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sometimes called.</p>
<p>Well, everybody knows about that, right?</p>
<p>These are the migrations that supposedly set in motion</p>
<p>some of the forces that toppled the Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The tribes, you know, they&rsquo;re famous too.</p>
<p>The Visigoths, the Ostrogoths, the Vandals,</p>
<p>the Lombards, there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of them.</p>
<p>But people forget that that movement of peoples</p>
<p>was supposedly started by another great movement</p>
<p>of peoples that hit those Germans</p>
<p>like a bunch of tumbling dominoes, the Huns.</p>
<p>And the Huns, of course, live in one of the great</p>
<p>ethnic melting pots on the face of the Earth.</p>
<p>They live in the Eurasian steppe,</p>
<p>where if we want to play the ethnic melting pot game,</p>
<p>you could have a ton of fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most interesting parts</p>
<p>of the great, you know, Eurasian steppe,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how many different peoples have lived there</p>
<p>and how often they&rsquo;ve been mixing with each other</p>
<p>because, of course, they have famously mobility</p>
<p>and they move like waves across this giant,</p>
<p>flat expanse of land.</p>
<p>And the numbers of people that have exploded</p>
<p>out of the heartland over by the Altai Mountains</p>
<p>and then usually spreading southward and westward</p>
<p>have, you know, subsumed numerous tribes in the past.</p>
<p>I mean, the first one in recorded history</p>
<p>that was mentioned in one of those books</p>
<p>where writing happens are the Cimmerians.</p>
<p>Contemporaries of the ancient Assyrians</p>
<p>and people like that.</p>
<p>Well, what happened to the Cimmerians, right?</p>
<p>These are supposedly, they would say, a hundred years ago,</p>
<p>ethnically Caucasian people,</p>
<p>probably speaking an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;d have a whole bunch of ways of phrasing it.</p>
<p>But the Cimmerians got treated the same way</p>
<p>that the Huns and the Mongols of later eras</p>
<p>treated the steppe enemies that they ran into</p>
<p>when they were overrun, pushed farther westward,</p>
<p>and then eventually absorbed by the Scythian tribes,</p>
<p>sometimes called Scythian in the old days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m firmly in the camp, by the way,</p>
<p>of those people trying to change the soft sea</p>
<p>back to the hard sea as it used to be</p>
<p>and as it still is in the languages</p>
<p>that invented those terms, right?</p>
<p>Scythians is a Greek term,</p>
<p>and the Greeks would not have said Scythians, so Scythians.</p>
<p>Just like Cimmerians, right?</p>
<p>Scythians, just like Cimmerians are not Cimmerians,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re Cimmerians.</p>
<p>And after the Scythians,</p>
<p>they had the same treatment that they meted out to the Cimmerians,</p>
<p>done to them by the Sarmatians,</p>
<p>who had the same thing done to them probably by the Sakha,</p>
<p>who had the same thing done to them by early versions of the Huns.</p>
<p>You had Turks, you had Magyars, you had Avars,</p>
<p>which are, you know, both Turks.</p>
<p>Um, of course, you had Mongolians eventually.</p>
<p>In other words, over and over and over again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had these tribes both ethnically cleanse areas,</p>
<p>drive people out of areas,</p>
<p>genocide peoples,</p>
<p>and usually, after defeating them, absorbing them.</p>
<p>Well, ethnically speaking,</p>
<p>these people of the steppe are endlessly fascinating.</p>
<p>Some of the tribes, the Chinese referred to a couple of them</p>
<p>as the Wusun and the Yuxi.</p>
<p>These are tribes which would be in modern-day China today,</p>
<p>but looked much more like they belonged quite a lot farther west</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re just gonna take their ethnicity, their hair color,</p>
<p>their eye color into account.</p>
<p>You know, people in modern-day China</p>
<p>generally look pretty Chinese,</p>
<p>and the more towards the Han areas you go,</p>
<p>the more this is true.</p>
<p>But if you look at the Great Steppe overall,</p>
<p>you can see the remnants of the DNA</p>
<p>mixing and scattering everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fabulously mixed territory</p>
<p>where people can have Asian features</p>
<p>with Western color eyes or Western-style hair with&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the same culture</p>
<p>that bred these descriptions of Genghis Khan</p>
<p>that can ring true when you hear them,</p>
<p>that he had Asian features,</p>
<p>but maybe green eyes or red hair.</p>
<p>This same mixing that you see on the Eurasian Steppe</p>
<p>through all of recorded history,</p>
<p>and which my history books would have maybe treated</p>
<p>from 1950, maybe would have treated</p>
<p>as an unusual aspect of this area,</p>
<p>the unusual mixing of different races and ethnicities</p>
<p>is, in fact, the norm pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>And Cheddar Man is a perfect example.</p>
<p>And if not Cheddar Man, because someone will write me and go,</p>
<p>well, that was all wrong with Cheddar Man.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter. You&rsquo;re finding this in all the other areas, too.</p>
<p>The people that live there now</p>
<p>often bear little resemblance to the people</p>
<p>who used to live there.</p>
<p>That does not mean that you can&rsquo;t trace your history</p>
<p>back to them. There could be a very Anglo-Saxon-looking person</p>
<p>in modern-day Kent that might find out</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re a direct descendant of Cheddar Man.</p>
<p>The only thing worth noting, though, is that if you&hellip;</p>
<p>you know, had gone back to your ancestors&rsquo; times,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all going to look quite a bit different than you.</p>
<p>And, and here&rsquo;s the part that shows a certain continuity</p>
<p>in the mixing of human DNA</p>
<p>in another 10,000, 20,000,</p>
<p>30,000 years, if we&rsquo;re looking at the long view here,</p>
<p>people are going to be different colors yet again.</p>
<p>The ethnic question is an ever-changing target, right?</p>
<p>And I would like to say that it will solve itself</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re all some version of the same color.</p>
<p>But if you do look at human history over the long haul</p>
<p>and try to pick out commonalities,</p>
<p>one of the things we tend to be really good at</p>
<p>is disliking people that are different than we are.</p>
<p>And just like that Star Trek episode,</p>
<p>where you had the one guy who had the left side of his face black</p>
<p>and the right side of his face white,</p>
<p>and the other guy who had the exact black and white face,</p>
<p>but on different sides, uh, as that, as the first character,</p>
<p>and they found a reason to not like each other because of that.</p>
<p>But to the outsiders, they looked like the same people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that great line where Captain Kirk says,</p>
<p>you know, but you&rsquo;re both the same color.</p>
<p>And the Frank Gorshin-played character says,</p>
<p>what are you talking about? Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m black on the left side?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s black on the right side.</p>
<p>I mean, in other words, we&rsquo;ll find some reason</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re ethnically different enough</p>
<p>to get upset over our ethnic heritage,</p>
<p>if human history is any guide.</p>
<p>Never mind that to us today, people 30,000 years in the future</p>
<p>may all appear to be the same color.</p>
<p>The star-bellied, sneatch-like aspect of human history shows</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll find a reason to declare some people</p>
<p>better than others, and other people worse.</p>
<p>This same question about movement and time</p>
<p>seems to work pretty well with this, um, idea of things like</p>
<p>land ownership&hellip;</p>
<p>or land rights. I mean, how much of our problems today</p>
<p>in the world, and especially over the last 100, 150 years,</p>
<p>seem to be related to who owns the land?</p>
<p>This is connected to colonialism, too,</p>
<p>and colonialism&rsquo;s another one of these ancient things.</p>
<p>Native Americans and other tribal peoples often have,</p>
<p>as part of their founding origin,</p>
<p>legends that they are, or were created,</p>
<p>as the human beings who lived in a certain spot.</p>
<p>Now, there are other tribal peoples</p>
<p>who have a tribal story about moving from some other place.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of the tribes that we just spoke about,</p>
<p>the Germanic-type tribes that are famously involved</p>
<p>in the collapse of the Western Roman Empire,</p>
<p>the Goths and stuff, they all had origin legends</p>
<p>that said that they were from elsewhere, from Scandinavia.</p>
<p>So they knew that they had moved, but many, many peoples</p>
<p>have a founding origin legend that they come from</p>
<p>the territory that they&rsquo;re currently in,</p>
<p>and have always been there.</p>
<p>It seems pretty obvious that unless they were</p>
<p>the first people that showed up in the human migration,</p>
<p>that first stepped foot in a given area,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re wrong about this,</p>
<p>that none of us inhabit the area we used to inhabit.</p>
<p>As I said, unless you come from the same part of Africa</p>
<p>where human beings, anatomically correct human beings,</p>
<p>first arose, you&rsquo;re a squatter on somebody else&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p>Or maybe you were the first people.</p>
<p>You arrived in virgin territory.</p>
<p>There were no human beings in the area</p>
<p>that your ancestors first, you know,</p>
<p>arrived at and declared their homeland.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Seems unlikely a modern ethnicity</p>
<p>or a modern nation state can claim something like that.</p>
<p>It seems strange to us when, you know,</p>
<p>some of the Zionists in Israel will proclaim</p>
<p>that territory to be their ancestral land, right?</p>
<p>Going back to the Bible, but the Bible,</p>
<p>in terms of its, you know, ancient-ness,</p>
<p>is a new document when we&rsquo;re looking at things</p>
<p>through the long view, right? The 300,000-year lens.</p>
<p>Then you start asking, well, you know,</p>
<p>who was there 10,000 years ago?</p>
<p>Who was there 20,000 years ago?</p>
<p>And then everything, when it comes to the land</p>
<p>that certain ethnic peoples don&rsquo;t just live on now,</p>
<p>but are associated with, right?</p>
<p>Their heritage is connected to the land.</p>
<p>It all looks like they&rsquo;re just the people</p>
<p>that own the current deed to the property.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like selling a house, historically speaking.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, they bought these from the Amalekites,</p>
<p>who had gotten it from the Guti,</p>
<p>who had originally got it from the Sumeri.</p>
<p>I mean, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Makes you start to feel like there are no indigenous peoples,</p>
<p>that human beings are, by their very nature,</p>
<p>newcomers everywhere.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d play this little game,</p>
<p>and I found that I use it all the time now.</p>
<p>But I got the idea talking with my wife&rsquo;s grandfather once.</p>
<p>And I forgot when this happened.</p>
<p>I want to say it was like 2000 or 2005, somewhere in there.</p>
<p>And he was in his mid-90s, one of those amazing people</p>
<p>who were still exercising like crazy.</p>
<p>I mean, just completely with it.</p>
<p>And you look at them and you go,</p>
<p>holy cow, this person&rsquo;s 95 or whatever they were.</p>
<p>And he was telling me what it was like</p>
<p>in the Pacific Northwest, where I live,</p>
<p>and where he grew up when he was a kid here, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, the 1930s, 1920s.</p>
<p>And I was zoning out while he was talking,</p>
<p>because I just couldn&rsquo;t help but think to myself,</p>
<p>how wild it was that if you took this man&rsquo;s lifetime,</p>
<p>whatever it was, 95 years,</p>
<p>and you just added another lifetime,</p>
<p>you know, same lifespan as he was currently living,</p>
<p>to it, so two 95-year-old lifetimes,</p>
<p>you would find yourself back in time</p>
<p>to where there were almost no European people</p>
<p>in the Pacific Northwest, right?</p>
<p>The spot we&rsquo;re standing on has only Native peoples.</p>
<p>Um, if you add this man&rsquo;s lifetime by another lifetime.</p>
<p>And that got me thinking about human lifetimes</p>
<p>as a substitute for talking about years,</p>
<p>or centuries, or dates.</p>
<p>Because, and I was trying to do the math correctly,</p>
<p>so if you just wanted to imagine</p>
<p>that a human lifespan was about 50 years,</p>
<p>and we all know, don&rsquo;t we, that the infant mortality rates</p>
<p>in earlier times skew the patterns a little bit.</p>
<p>I think 50 would still be considered a little high</p>
<p>by some people, but let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>your average lifespan over time is 50 years.</p>
<p>If you take two of those lifetimes, right,</p>
<p>then you have a century. So, two lives to a century.</p>
<p>That means that if you have four human lives,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re back to that point my wife&rsquo;s grandfather</p>
<p>was talking about, right? Four 50-year human lives,</p>
<p>and there are no Europeans, basically,</p>
<p>in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>That seems pretty short, right? When you just say,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s just your great-great-great-grandfather.</p>
<p>Well, it gets even weirder when you go even farther</p>
<p>back in time, right? If you take 10 or 11</p>
<p>of those 50-year lifespans&hellip;</p>
<p>Great-great-great-great-great, whatever you want to say,</p>
<p>10 or 11 of them, and now you&rsquo;re back</p>
<p>in Columbus&rsquo; time, and you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>there being no Europeans anywhere in the hemisphere.</p>
<p>You say 1492, or you say five or six hundred years ago,</p>
<p>it just seems like forever ago.</p>
<p>You say 10 or 11 50-year lifespans,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem that long at all, does it?</p>
<p>You want to keep playing that game if you say</p>
<p>a 20 of those lifespans?</p>
<p>Great-great-great-great-great-grandfather,</p>
<p>whatever it is, 20 lifespans, and you are in,</p>
<p>you know, the early Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Normans, Saxons, William the Conqueror,</p>
<p>Vikings, 20 human lifetimes of 50 years.</p>
<p>40 of those human lifetimes?</p>
<p>40 of them, and you&rsquo;re in Julius Caesar&rsquo;s time period,</p>
<p>the death throes of the Roman Republic.</p>
<p>60 of those lifetimes, and you&rsquo;re in Old Testament time.</p>
<p>90 of those 50-year lifespans, 90.</p>
<p>And you can watch the great pyramids</p>
<p>being built in Egypt.</p>
<p>And before that, it&rsquo;s basically prehistory.</p>
<p>So the thousands and thousands of human lifetimes</p>
<p>that are part of your ancestral genetic code,</p>
<p>only the last 90 or 100 or something like that,</p>
<p>all that is is all recorded history,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hardly any of your past.</p>
<p>That, to me, is absolutely mind-blowing.</p>
<p>And I feel like the ramifications should be huge,</p>
<p>even if, you know, to my editor&rsquo;s dismay,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you what the story is here.</p>
<p>One of the things I have always been fascinated with</p>
<p>is how the people from a very, very long time ago</p>
<p>saw their own very, very ancient past.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, there is a king&rsquo;s list</p>
<p>that the Neo-Assyrian scribes put together</p>
<p>in the Neo-Assyrian Empire.</p>
<p>And the Neo-Assyrians were the last of the great</p>
<p>Assyrian states, the high watermark</p>
<p>of their political and military dominance.</p>
<p>Think 750 BCE, and you&rsquo;re right there.</p>
<p>Well, the Neo-Assyrian scribes concocted a king&rsquo;s list, right?</p>
<p>One king after another, after another,</p>
<p>that stretched all the way back in time.</p>
<p>That chronicled their rulers going back,</p>
<p>remember, from their own time period,</p>
<p>which is like 750 BCE, going back 2,000 years from there.</p>
<p>I love that they referred to the first 17 kings</p>
<p>in their king&rsquo;s list as the kings who lived in tents.</p>
<p>Denoting that these were like nomadic kings, right?</p>
<p>People who didn&rsquo;t even live in houses.</p>
<p>Now, most historians will tell you that those sorts</p>
<p>of legendary historical creation lists</p>
<p>are a bunch of nonsense, and that they go from,</p>
<p>you know, really attestable rulers that were</p>
<p>you know, really attestable rulers that we know existed</p>
<p>to people that may or may not have existed</p>
<p>to a bunch of, you know, kings in the distant past</p>
<p>that were almost certainly fictitious.</p>
<p>But how&rsquo;s that any different than all of us doing</p>
<p>what the 19th century made common, right?</p>
<p>Trying to associate our current situation</p>
<p>with some wonderful, glorious, ancient lineage.</p>
<p>The ancient Assyrians were no different.</p>
<p>What is a little different, though,</p>
<p>is what became of them, maybe compared to what will become</p>
<p>of us. My favorite story, almost certainly,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s top five for me, from the ancient world</p>
<p>and all the ancient writings, and we quoted it in the show</p>
<p>we did on the Assyrians, Judgment at Nineveh,</p>
<p>available from the website if you want it.</p>
<p>Although, one of the many shows I&rsquo;d like to redo</p>
<p>with the modern sort of approach where we go into it</p>
<p>more deeply and over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the wonderful story from the Greek general,</p>
<p>Xenophon, when he came upon what used to be</p>
<p>some of the grandest cities in the world,</p>
<p>a couple hundred years after their grandeur had passed.</p>
<p>And they, you know, Xenophon was a Greek general</p>
<p>whose men were involved in a Persian dynastic struggle.</p>
<p>They ended up on the losing side and had this amazing account</p>
<p>of trying to get home from the battle site,</p>
<p>which was deep in like Iraq, all the way back to Greece,</p>
<p>harried the whole way by the enemy forces.</p>
<p>But at one point in Xenophon&rsquo;s account,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s writing this, you know, like in 401, 400 BCE, right?</p>
<p>For us, it&rsquo;s very, very ancient times.</p>
<p>But he runs across ancient cities,</p>
<p>cities that are ancient in his time period.</p>
<p>We wondered about how the Assyrians saw their ancient past.</p>
<p>Well, this wasn&rsquo;t Xenophon&rsquo;s ancient past.</p>
<p>These weren&rsquo;t Greek cities. These were Assyrian cities.</p>
<p>But Assyria had been gone for a couple hundred years,</p>
<p>and Xenophon had no idea about them.</p>
<p>He talked about these, I always call them ghost cities,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re cities that are literally just turning to dust</p>
<p>because these cities were often made up of the mud bricks</p>
<p>that they used to use as an archaeological building,</p>
<p>uh, material back then.</p>
<p>And Xenophon described how tall the walls were,</p>
<p>how big the city&rsquo;s circumferences were,</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And you can tell he&rsquo;s plainly, um,</p>
<p>astonished by what he sees.</p>
<p>These are cities that are probably bigger than anything in Greece,</p>
<p>or certainly as big as the big cities in Greece,</p>
<p>and yet they&rsquo;re clearly from a much earlier time period.</p>
<p>Now, this is a guy being pursued and on the run by his enemies,</p>
<p>but he still had time to make a few inquiries</p>
<p>to the local people squatting here and there</p>
<p>around these giant, ancient, you know, structures,</p>
<p>and the people give him the wrong answer.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know who it belongs to either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a couple hundred years since they were destroyed.</p>
<p>Assyria&rsquo;s enemies combined and brought that empire down</p>
<p>and destroyed these cities,</p>
<p>but Xenophon already can&rsquo;t figure out</p>
<p>who it was that built them.</p>
<p>I love that story because it&rsquo;s a story about antiquity</p>
<p>looking back on an even earlier antiquity.</p>
<p>And there seems to be kind of a, sort of a cosmic lesson there</p>
<p>that we seem to think ourselves immune from.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the lesson that someday somebody could be going</p>
<p>through our ruins and asking, you know,</p>
<p>the few squatters here and there who built them.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>let me just suggest to you</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s probably what your average Assyrian person</p>
<p>on the street would have said to me</p>
<p>if I did one of those, and I used to hate those,</p>
<p>those classic, you know, we used to call them MOSs,</p>
<p>man on the street, but today you&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>person on the street interviews.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;d gone to your average Assyrian in Nineveh and said,</p>
<p>so, do you think someday this city will be a ruin</p>
<p>and no one will even remember Assyria?</p>
<p>I would think they would think I was crazy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what people today would think</p>
<p>if I asked them a similar question.</p>
<p>But the long view seems to indicate</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s how most things have gone in the past,</p>
<p>which means one of two things, as I always say,</p>
<p>either things will continue to go as they always had,</p>
<p>and that will be interesting,</p>
<p>or they will defy the way things have always gone</p>
<p>and go in a different direction, which is equally interesting.</p>
<p>So either we end up a ruin to somebody else,</p>
<p>or we don&rsquo;t, both fascinating outcomes.</p>
<p>There are some other things, though,</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t brought up that I think also</p>
<p>are part of what the long view seems to indicate to me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always been hard on our environment.</p>
<p>And this is another thing that I think was part of</p>
<p>an earlier era of things like anthropology</p>
<p>that maybe is starting to also be seen in a different light,</p>
<p>this idea that human beings lived in harmony with nature</p>
<p>once upon a time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And I think, like I said, the&hellip;</p>
<p>And again, maybe I&rsquo;m choosing sides here,</p>
<p>but the anthropologists and stuff that I&rsquo;ve been reading</p>
<p>seem to suggest the same thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always been extremely hard</p>
<p>wherever we&rsquo;ve lived on the environment.</p>
<p>The difference between earlier eras and today are twofold.</p>
<p>One, we create stuff now that doesn&rsquo;t biodegrade.</p>
<p>So if you were tough on your environment,</p>
<p>but it was just a question of chopping down all the foliage</p>
<p>and leaving around biodegradable material</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>well, that goes away eventually.</p>
<p>If instead we&rsquo;re dealing with things like plastics</p>
<p>and polymers and all kinds of other things, right?</p>
<p>Contaminants that don&rsquo;t go away, well, that&rsquo;s a different&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, in other words, we&rsquo;re being no better stewards</p>
<p>of our environment than our ancestors were,</p>
<p>but the materials that we&rsquo;re polluting our environment with</p>
<p>are much more permanent.</p>
<p>So the environment stays much more damaged much longer.</p>
<p>And of course, the other thing is,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re moving around in a nomadic state,</p>
<p>which would have been most of human history</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re looking at the 300,000-year lens,</p>
<p>well, that means that you&rsquo;re able to give land time to recover</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve been hard on it.</p>
<p>And you see this with ape populations, right?</p>
<p>They just, they&rsquo;ll move from one burned-out territory</p>
<p>to another, and by the time they get back</p>
<p>to the original location in their range,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s had time to recover.</p>
<p>And they haven&rsquo;t polluted it with forever chemicals, right?</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve always been hard on the environment.</p>
<p>So the fact that we&rsquo;re still hard on the environment</p>
<p>is part of the consistency of looking at human behavior</p>
<p>over the long haul, which means that trying to extricate</p>
<p>ourselves from this mess of destroying our environment</p>
<p>is going to be&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, no one ever said it was going to be easy,</p>
<p>but we would literally have to change the way</p>
<p>we have always been, not revert to a way we used to be again.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a myth that we ever were in that particular way.</p>
<p>So humans have always moved.</p>
<p>And this is where the notes that I have around me,</p>
<p>just it would start to overwhelm me.</p>
<p>But there were two lines that I juxtaposed,</p>
<p>one right by the other.</p>
<p>One was this concept, and again, you&rsquo;ll often hear this</p>
<p>from environmental groups, a concept known as</p>
<p>Seventh Generation Philosophy.</p>
<p>And this is supposedly tied back to the Iroquois Confederation.</p>
<p>And the story goes that the people who ruled</p>
<p>those Native American groups were taught to think about</p>
<p>their decision-making and how it would affect</p>
<p>seven generations into the future.</p>
<p>Now, I love this concept, but I find it hard to believe in it.</p>
<p>And the quote that I juxtaposed next to it</p>
<p>was a quote by the 20th century economist John Maynard Keynes,</p>
<p>who was, and you know, the context behind it was</p>
<p>somebody was talking about going through some hard times</p>
<p>and letting the economic system correct itself</p>
<p>over the long haul.</p>
<p>And he said, and the quote is something like,</p>
<p>well, you know, in the long haul, we&rsquo;re all dead.</p>
<p>Or in the long run, we&rsquo;re all dead.</p>
<p>And the point he was trying to make was that</p>
<p>if you tell somebody, well, things will get better,</p>
<p>but they won&rsquo;t get better till after your lifespan is over.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re condemning that poor person then</p>
<p>to have to live a terrible life because you&rsquo;re telling them</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s part of something that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>for the good of something farther past your horizon.</p>
<p>And he was insinuating that you might change</p>
<p>the future horizon if you just tried to improve</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s life now and didn&rsquo;t try to worry</p>
<p>about the amorphous stuff, you know, in the future.</p>
<p>Well, I was trying to think about artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>which is all in the news right now, of course.</p>
<p>Um, and if you had said to an AI program</p>
<p>that it needed to run society, but that it needed to have</p>
<p>as its founding sort of guiding principles,</p>
<p>this seventh-generation philosophy as its thinking.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t tell you that I came up with any specific scenarios</p>
<p>except that AI destroys the world,</p>
<p>which is the one I normally come up with</p>
<p>about 80 percent of the time.</p>
<p>But the idea of trying to manage human resources</p>
<p>for the good of people 200 years from now, for example,</p>
<p>just seemed to go against all of the human proclivities</p>
<p>built into us. I mean, if you have to&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, throughout most of human history,</p>
<p>we live so hand-to-mouth that the idea of trying</p>
<p>to preserve things for future generations,</p>
<p>and this goes back to the Keynes quote a little bit,</p>
<p>would certainly mean a poorer lifestyle,</p>
<p>or maybe not even surviving,</p>
<p>to the current generation you lived in, right?</p>
<p>If the Iroquois really were trying to decide things</p>
<p>for seven generations in their future,</p>
<p>then they were prosperous people indeed.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t have those kinds of, you know,</p>
<p>the wealth and the options and the surplus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard enough getting through the winter,</p>
<p>much less trying to preserve stuff</p>
<p>so that people 200 years in the future</p>
<p>have enough for themselves, right?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t cut down this forest now.</p>
<p>Well, why? It would make our lives so much better.</p>
<p>Well, what about people 200 years from now?</p>
<p>Well, if we don&rsquo;t manage our resources better now,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t be here 200 years from now.</p>
<p>See what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Interesting to think about how an AI would try</p>
<p>to figure out a way to manage human resources</p>
<p>and needs and actions with that long of a timeline.</p>
<p>I mean, we might have to put up with a ton of things today</p>
<p>going away that make our lives what they are</p>
<p>on the grounds that to do otherwise</p>
<p>would be to hamstring people hundreds of years from now</p>
<p>from living lives, you know, well at all.</p>
<p>This is exactly the sort of problem,</p>
<p>you know, something that so runs against the grain</p>
<p>of what our past history seems to indicate is our pattern,</p>
<p>where a person like yours truly is susceptible to seduction</p>
<p>by something like the artificial intelligence</p>
<p>wildcard answer to our problems.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, it can become depressing</p>
<p>to look at just how consistently we live a certain way.</p>
<p>Over the long view, and then expect those ways</p>
<p>and those patterns of behavior to change</p>
<p>just because we&rsquo;ve invented weapons, for example,</p>
<p>that are so destructive that fighting the kind of wars</p>
<p>that we had become accustomed to fighting</p>
<p>would be practically suicidal, genocidal for sure.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t even imagine something like that happening.</p>
<p>But our past history would suggest</p>
<p>that imagining anything else is probably being</p>
<p>far too optimistic, unless, of course,</p>
<p>you can throw a wildcard into things</p>
<p>that, you know, upsets that balance.</p>
<p>In other words, what if you had a fix?</p>
<p>You know, something that came in there</p>
<p>and prevented us from doing the very things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve always done, depressingly always done, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna destroy the environment.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s invent something that will prevent us</p>
<p>from destroying the environment, right?</p>
<p>So, the seventh generation thinking infused</p>
<p>into our robot overlords.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the, you know, Kurt Vonnegut novel</p>
<p>on Dan Carlin&rsquo;s idea for saving us from ourselves</p>
<p>with artificial intelligence would go.</p>
<p>It would make a great movie, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Perfect science fiction dystopian classic,</p>
<p>you know, invented by misanthropic people</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t trust people to handle people problems</p>
<p>and wanted a wildcard instead.</p>
<p>But you can see how it could seduce a person like yours, truly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something wonderfully symmetric</p>
<p>about the whole thing that&rsquo;s appealing also.</p>
<p>This idea that our answer to the problem</p>
<p>of inventing all these things over time</p>
<p>that have made modern life possible, right?</p>
<p>The kind of lifestyles and progress that,</p>
<p>you know, we all live lives that only the very, very, very,</p>
<p>very most privileged and wealthy people in the past ever lived.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve got this wonderful planet we&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>through all of our inventiveness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful symmetry to the idea</p>
<p>that we could invent our way out of our inventiveness problem,</p>
<p>or at least our inventiveness byproducts problem.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>And one can also make the case that,</p>
<p>you know, the last couple of hundred years</p>
<p>have put human collective intellectual capacity</p>
<p>and the ability of entire human societies to adjust</p>
<p>under huge amounts of pressure.</p>
<p>And the need to speedily evolve to handle</p>
<p>what are historically very rapid changes.</p>
<p>I mean, the last couple of hundred years,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, well, as we&rsquo;ve always said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to come a time where you&rsquo;re gonna reach</p>
<p>the limits of humanity&rsquo;s ability to evolve</p>
<p>and adjust to changes at the pace of change</p>
<p>as it continues to speed up.</p>
<p>Now, we may have reached that point already,</p>
<p>or it may be in our future,</p>
<p>but at some point, it&rsquo;s going to arrive.</p>
<p>And at that point, the only thing one can suggest</p>
<p>that would solve a problem like that</p>
<p>is human inventiveness having invented something</p>
<p>that could go beyond human evolutionary capacity</p>
<p>to change more quickly than human brains</p>
<p>and human societies can change.</p>
<p>That is a pro-artificial intelligence argument</p>
<p>right there, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>The idea that you need something like this</p>
<p>to sort of save humanity.</p>
<p>The anti-artificial intelligence argument, though,</p>
<p>is well-known and well-understood, too.</p>
<p>Basically, it boils down to a question,</p>
<p>is it ever smart to build something</p>
<p>that will be smarter than you are?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is in a case like this,</p>
<p>because sometimes I wish we had something smarter than we are,</p>
<p>but the obvious downside of that is, well, obvious.</p>
<p>And even if we had a choice in the matter,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure we do,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right choice would be.</p>
<p>I remember James Burke asking the question,</p>
<p>the great science historian, a long time ago,</p>
<p>if you looked over the technological horizon</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t like what you saw,</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t want to invent and deal with the ramifications</p>
<p>of inventing something in the future,</p>
<p>could you decide not to?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what the answer to that is.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know exactly which way this will go,</p>
<p>but if you are a betting person,</p>
<p>it would be smart to look at exactly how things have gone,</p>
<p>and note that it&rsquo;s probably the safe bet</p>
<p>to assume that it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the right bet to assume that we humans will do</p>
<p>just what we have always done.</p>
