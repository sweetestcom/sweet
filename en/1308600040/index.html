    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk all about dopamine</p>
<p>and what drives you to do the things that you do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about motivation and desire and craving,</p>
<p>but also how dopamine relates to satisfaction</p>
<p>and our feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>And of course, any discussion about dopamine</p>
<p>has to include a discussion about the potential</p>
<p>for dopamine-induced addiction.</p>
<p>Indeed, dopamine lies at the heart of addiction</p>
<p>to all things.</p>
<p>But today, we are mainly going to focus on</p>
<p>how what we do and how we do it</p>
<p>and how we conceptualize those things</p>
<p>leads to changes in this amazing molecule</p>
<p>in our brain and bodies that we call dopamine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to teach you what dopamine is and what it is not.</p>
<p>There are a lot of myths about the molecule dopamine.</p>
<p>We often hear about so-called dopamine hits.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to dispel</p>
<p>many common myths about dopamine,</p>
<p>and we are going to talk about how dopamine actually works.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to discuss the biology of dopamine,</p>
<p>the psychology.</p>
<p>We will discuss some neural circuits</p>
<p>and a really exciting aspect of dopamine biology,</p>
<p>our so-called dopamine schedules.</p>
<p>In other words, we are going to discuss</p>
<p>how things like food, drugs, caffeine, pornography,</p>
<p>even some plant-based compounds</p>
<p>can change our baseline levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>and in doing so, they change how much dopamine</p>
<p>we are capable of experiencing</p>
<p>from what could be very satisfying events</p>
<p>or events that make us feel not so good</p>
<p>because of things that we did or took prior.</p>
<p>So I promise you it&rsquo;s going to be a vast discussion,</p>
<p>but I will structure it for you,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll come away with a deep understanding</p>
<p>of really what drives you.</p>
<p>You will also come away with a lot of tools</p>
<p>how to leverage dopamine</p>
<p>so that you can sustain energy drive and motivation</p>
<p>for the things that are important to you</p>
<p>over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the meat of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share with you a fascinating result</p>
<p>that really underscores what dopamine is capable of</p>
<p>in our brains and bodies,</p>
<p>and underscores the fact that just through behaviors,</p>
<p>no drugs, nothing of that sort,</p>
<p>just through behaviors,</p>
<p>we can achieve terrifically high increases in dopamine</p>
<p>that are very long and sustained in ways that serve us.</p>
<p>This is a result that was published</p>
<p>in the European Journal of Physiology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go into it in more detail later,</p>
<p>but essentially what it involved</p>
<p>is having human subjects get into water</p>
<p>of different temperatures.</p>
<p>So it was warm water, moderately cool water,</p>
<p>and cold, cold water.</p>
<p>Had them stay in that water for up to an hour,</p>
<p>and they measured by way of blood draw,</p>
<p>things like cortisol, norepinephrine, and dopamine.</p>
<p>What was fascinating is that cold water exposure</p>
<p>led to very rapid increases in norepinephrine</p>
<p>and epinephrine, which is also just called adrenaline.</p>
<p>It also led to increases in dopamine,</p>
<p>and these increases in dopamine were very significant.</p>
<p>They kicked in around 10 or 15 minutes</p>
<p>after submersion into the cold water,</p>
<p>and I should mention the head wasn&rsquo;t below water,</p>
<p>it was just up to the neck.</p>
<p>And the dopamine release continued to rise,</p>
<p>and rise, and rise, and eventually reached 250%</p>
<p>above baseline.</p>
<p>Now, what was interesting is after subjects</p>
<p>got out of this cold water,</p>
<p>that dopamine increase was sustained.</p>
<p>And I know nowadays many people are interested</p>
<p>in using cold water therapy</p>
<p>as a way to increase metabolism and fat loss,</p>
<p>but also to improve sense of wellbeing,</p>
<p>improve cognition, improve clarity of mind.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s something really special</p>
<p>about this very alert, but calm state of mind</p>
<p>that seems to be the one that&rsquo;s optimal</p>
<p>for pretty much everything except sleep,</p>
<p>but for all aspects of work, and for social engagement,</p>
<p>and for sport, that highly alert, but calm state of mind</p>
<p>really is the sweet spot that I believe most of us</p>
<p>would like to achieve.</p>
<p>And this cold water exposure done correctly</p>
<p>really can help people achieve that state of mind</p>
<p>through these increases in dopamine</p>
<p>that last a very long time.</p>
<p>So I will later detail the specifics of that study,</p>
<p>what it entailed in terms of how long the variations</p>
<p>that different subjects experienced,</p>
<p>as well as how to limit the amount of stress hormone,</p>
<p>cortisol, that&rsquo;s released as a consequence</p>
<p>of the cold water.</p>
<p>And we will also talk about compounds,</p>
<p>supplements that people can take</p>
<p>in order to increase their levels of dopamine</p>
<p>should they choose.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to announce that there&rsquo;s an event</p>
<p>that some of you may find very useful.</p>
<p>This is an event put on by Logitech</p>
<p>that I will be speaking at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Rethink Education,</p>
<p>The Biology of Learning,</p>
<p>Reimagining Learning Through Neuroscience.</p>
<p>And at this event, I will be speaking,</p>
<p>there will be other speakers as well,</p>
<p>and I will be talking about neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and its applications for teaching and for learning.</p>
<p>I will describe what I call the plasticity super protocol</p>
<p>that incorporates all of what we know</p>
<p>about rapid learning, efficient learning,</p>
<p>and the best ways to teach and learn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s geared towards educators of all kinds.</p>
<p>It is zero cost.</p>
<p>So please feel free to sign up.</p>
<p>The event is September 30th, 2021 at 3 p.m. Eastern.</p>
<p>You can find the registration link</p>
<p>in the caption for this episode.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about dopamine.</p>
<p>Most people have heard of dopamine,</p>
<p>and we hear all the time now about dopamine hits,</p>
<p>but actually there&rsquo;s no such thing as a dopamine hit.</p>
<p>And actually the way that your body uses dopamine</p>
<p>is to have a baseline level of dopamine,</p>
<p>meaning an amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s circulating</p>
<p>in your brain and body all the time.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be important</p>
<p>for how you feel generally,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re in a good mood, motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>And you also can experience peaks</p>
<p>in dopamine above baseline.</p>
<p>This has a very specific name in the neurobiology literature</p>
<p>so-called tonic and phasic release of dopamine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explain what that means in a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>But if you remember nothing else from this episode,</p>
<p>please remember this,</p>
<p>that when you experience something</p>
<p>or you crave something really desirable,</p>
<p>really exciting to you, very pleasurable,</p>
<p>what happens afterwards</p>
<p>is your baseline level of dopamine drops.</p>
<p>So these peaks in dopamine,</p>
<p>they influence how much dopamine</p>
<p>will generally be circulating afterward.</p>
<p>And you might think, oh, a big peak in dopamine,</p>
<p>after that I&rsquo;m going to feel even better</p>
<p>because I just had this great event.</p>
<p>Not the case.</p>
<p>What actually happens</p>
<p>is that your baseline level of dopamine drops.</p>
<p>And I will explain the precise mechanism for that.</p>
<p>In the neuroscience literature,</p>
<p>we refer to this as tonic and phasic release of dopamine.</p>
<p>Tonic being the low level baseline</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always there circulating,</p>
<p>released into your brain all the time.</p>
<p>And then phasic, these peaks that ride above that baseline.</p>
<p>And those two things interact.</p>
<p>And this is really important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to teach you the underlying neurobiology,</p>
<p>but even if you have no background in biology,</p>
<p>I promise to make it all clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain the terms and what they mean.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m excited to teach you about dopamine</p>
<p>because dopamine has everything to do</p>
<p>with how you feel right now, as you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>it has everything to do with how you will feel</p>
<p>an hour from now,</p>
<p>has everything to do with your level of motivation</p>
<p>and your level of desire</p>
<p>and your willingness to push through effort.</p>
<p>If ever you&rsquo;ve interacted with somebody</p>
<p>who just doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any drive, they&rsquo;ve given up,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;ve interacted with somebody</p>
<p>who seems to have endless drive and energy,</p>
<p>what you are looking at there in those two circumstances</p>
<p>is without question,</p>
<p>a difference in the level of dopamine</p>
<p>circulating in their system.</p>
<p>There will be other factors too,</p>
<p>but the level of dopamine is the primary determinant</p>
<p>of how motivated we are, how excited we are,</p>
<p>how outward facing we are and how willing we are</p>
<p>to lean into life and pursue things.</p>
<p>Dopamine is what we call a neuromodulator.</p>
<p>Neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Neurotransmitters are involved in the dialogue</p>
<p>between neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>and neurotransmitters tend to mediate local communication.</p>
<p>Just imagine two people talking to one another at a concert.</p>
<p>That communication between them</p>
<p>is analogous to the communication</p>
<p>carried out by neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>whereas neuromodulators influence the communication</p>
<p>of many neurons.</p>
<p>Imagine a bunch of people dancing</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a coordinated dance involving 10 or 20</p>
<p>or hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Neuromodulators are coordinating that dance.</p>
<p>In the nervous system,</p>
<p>what this means is that dopamine release</p>
<p>changes the probability that certain neural circuits</p>
<p>will be active and that other neural circuits</p>
<p>will be inactive, okay?</p>
<p>So it modulates a bunch of things all at once.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so powerful at shifting</p>
<p>not just our levels of energy, but also our mindset,</p>
<p>also our feelings of whether or not we can</p>
<p>or cannot accomplish something.</p>
<p>So how does dopamine work and what does it do?</p>
<p>Well, first of all,</p>
<p>it is not just responsible for pleasure.</p>
<p>It is responsible for motivation and drive,</p>
<p>primarily at the psychological level.</p>
<p>Also for craving.</p>
<p>Those three things are sort of the same,</p>
<p>motivation, drive, and craving.</p>
<p>It also controls time perception.</p>
<p>And we will get deep into how dopamine</p>
<p>can modulate time perception and how important it is</p>
<p>that everybody be able to access increases in dopamine</p>
<p>at different timescales.</p>
<p>This turns out to be important</p>
<p>to not end up addicted to substances,</p>
<p>but it also turns out to be very important</p>
<p>to sustain effort and be a happy person</p>
<p>over long periods of time,</p>
<p>which I think most everybody wants.</p>
<p>It certainly is adaptive in life to be able to do that.</p>
<p>Dopamine is also vitally important for movement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain the neural circuits for dopamine and mindset</p>
<p>and dopamine in movement in a moment,</p>
<p>but in diseases like Parkinson&rsquo;s or Lewy&rsquo;s body&rsquo;s dementia,</p>
<p>which is similar to Parkinson&rsquo;s in many ways,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a depletion or death of dopamine neurons</p>
<p>at a particular location in the brain,</p>
<p>which leads to shaky movements, challenges in speaking,</p>
<p>challenges in particular in initiating movement.</p>
<p>And because dopamine is depleted elsewhere too,</p>
<p>people with Parkinson&rsquo;s and Lewy&rsquo;s body,</p>
<p>excuse me, Lewy body dementia,</p>
<p>also experience drops in motivation and affect,</p>
<p>meaning mood, they tend to get depressed and so on.</p>
<p>When those people are properly treated,</p>
<p>they can, not always,</p>
<p>but they can recover some fluidity of movement,</p>
<p>some ability to initiate movement.</p>
<p>And almost without question,</p>
<p>those people feel better psychologically,</p>
<p>not just because they can move,</p>
<p>but also because dopamine impacts mood and motivation.</p>
<p>So what are the underlying neural circuits?</p>
<p>For those of you that are not interested in biology</p>
<p>and specific nomenclature,</p>
<p>you can tune out now if you want,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>You have two main neural circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that dopamine uses in order to exert all its effects.</p>
<p>The first one is a pathway that goes from this area</p>
<p>in the, what&rsquo;s called the ventral tegmentum,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fancy, but ventral just means bottom.</p>
<p>And tegmentum actually means floor.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s at the bottom of the brain</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the ventral part of the floor.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really low in the back of the brain,</p>
<p>the ventral tegmentum.</p>
<p>And it goes from the ventral tegmentum</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s called the ventral striatum</p>
<p>and the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a lot of language,</p>
<p>but basically what we call this</p>
<p>is the mesocortico-limbic pathway.</p>
<p>This is the pathway by which dopamine influences</p>
<p>motivation, drive, and craving.</p>
<p>It involves structures</p>
<p>that some of you may have heard of before,</p>
<p>things like nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>This is the pathway that really gets disrupted</p>
<p>in addictions where, in particular,</p>
<p>drugs that influence the release of dopamine,</p>
<p>like cocaine and methamphetamine,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about those drugs today,</p>
<p>they tap into this pathway.</p>
<p>But if you are pursuing a partner,</p>
<p>a boyfriend or girlfriend,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re pursuing a degree in school,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re pursuing a finish line in a race,</p>
<p>you are tapping into this</p>
<p>so-called mesocortico-limbic pathway.</p>
<p>This is the classic reward pathway in all mammals.</p>
<p>The other pathway emerges from an area in the brain</p>
<p>called the substantia nigra,</p>
<p>so-called because the cells in that area are dark,</p>
<p>and the substantia nigra</p>
<p>connects to an area of the brain</p>
<p>called the dorsal striatum.</p>
<p>This is, not surprisingly,</p>
<p>called the nigrostriatal pathway.</p>
<p>For those of you who have never done any neuroanatomy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to teach you a little trick right now.</p>
<p>Everything in neuroanatomy,</p>
<p>the first part of a word tells you where the neurons are,</p>
<p>and then the second part</p>
<p>tells you where they are connecting to.</p>
<p>So when I say nigrostriatal pathway,</p>
<p>it means that the neurons are in substantia nigra,</p>
<p>and they connect to the striatum, nigrostriatal pathway.</p>
<p>So while it&rsquo;s a lot of language,</p>
<p>there is some logic there, okay?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got these two pathways,</p>
<p>one mainly for movement, right?</p>
<p>This is the substantia nigra to dorsal striatum,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got this other pathway,</p>
<p>the so-called mesocortico-limbic pathway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for reward, reinforcement, and motivation.</p>
<p>I want you to remember that there are two pathways.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t remember the two pathways in detail,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine,</p>
<p>but please remember that there are two pathways</p>
<p>because that turns out to be important later.</p>
<p>Now, the other thing to understand about dopamine</p>
<p>is that the way that dopamine is released</p>
<p>in the brain and body can differ,</p>
<p>meaning it can be very local or it can be more broad.</p>
<p>Now, most of you have probably heard of synapses.</p>
<p>Synapses are the little spaces between neurons,</p>
<p>and basically neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>communicate with one another</p>
<p>by making each other electrically active</p>
<p>or by making each other less electrically active.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how this works.</p>
<p>You can imagine one nerve cell and another nerve cell</p>
<p>with a little gap between them, a little synapse.</p>
<p>And the way that one nerve cell</p>
<p>causes the next nerve cell to fire,</p>
<p>what we call fire really means to become electrically active,</p>
<p>is that it vomits out these little packets,</p>
<p>what we call vesicles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re little bubbles filled with a chemical.</p>
<p>When that chemical enters the synapse,</p>
<p>some of it docks or parks on the other side</p>
<p>in the other neuron.</p>
<p>And by virtue of electrical changes</p>
<p>in what we call the post-synaptic neuron,</p>
<p>that chemical will make that neuron</p>
<p>more electrically active or less electrically active.</p>
<p>Dopamine can do that</p>
<p>like any other neurotransmitter or neuromodulator.</p>
<p>So it can have one neuron influence another neuron,</p>
<p>but dopamine can also engage</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called a volumetric release.</p>
<p>Volumetric release is like a giant vomit</p>
<p>that gets out to 50 or a hundred or even thousands of cells.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s local release, what we call synaptic release,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s volumetric release.</p>
<p>So volumetric release is like dumping all this dopamine</p>
<p>out into the system.</p>
<p>So dopamine is incredible because it can change the way</p>
<p>that our neural circuits work at a local scale</p>
<p>and at a very broad scale.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are only interested in tools,</p>
<p>like how do I get more dopamine?</p>
<p>Let me tell you, this part is really important</p>
<p>because if you were to take a drug or supplement</p>
<p>that increases your level of dopamine,</p>
<p>you are influencing both the local release of dopamine</p>
<p>and volumetric release.</p>
<p>This relates back to the baseline of dopamine</p>
<p>and the big peak above baseline.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be important.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just allude to why it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Many drugs and indeed many supplements</p>
<p>that increase dopamine will actually make it harder</p>
<p>for you to sustain dopamine release</p>
<p>over long periods of time and to achieve those peaks</p>
<p>that most of us are craving when we are in pursuit of things.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because if you get both volumetric release,</p>
<p>the dumping out of dopamine everywhere,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting local release,</p>
<p>what it means is that the difference between the peak</p>
<p>and baseline is likely to be smaller.</p>
<p>And this is very important, how satisfying or exciting</p>
<p>or pleasurable a given experience is</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just depend on the height of that peak.</p>
<p>It depends on the height of that peak</p>
<p>relative to the baseline.</p>
<p>So if you increase the baseline and you increase the peak,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to achieve more</p>
<p>and more pleasure from things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about how to leverage this information</p>
<p>in a little bit, but just increasing your dopamine,</p>
<p>yes, it will make you excited for all things.</p>
<p>It will make you feel very motivated,</p>
<p>but it will also make that motivation very short-lived.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a better way to increase your dopamine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a better way to optimize</p>
<p>this peak to baseline ratio.</p>
<p>For now, what we&rsquo;ve talked about is two main neural circuits,</p>
<p>one for movement and one for motivation</p>
<p>and craving with dopamine.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve talked about two main modes of communication</p>
<p>between neurons with dopamine.</p>
<p>One is this local synaptic release.</p>
<p>One is more volumetric release.</p>
<p>And in the back of your mind,</p>
<p>you can relate this back to, again,</p>
<p>this baseline versus peaks above baseline.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a description of what we would call</p>
<p>the spatial effects or the spatial aspects of dopamine.</p>
<p>I said, this connects to that, that connects to this.</p>
<p>You can get local or more broad volumetric release.</p>
<p>What about the duration of release</p>
<p>or the duration of action for dopamine?</p>
<p>Well, dopamine is unique among chemicals in the brain</p>
<p>because dopamine, unlike a lot of chemicals in the brain,</p>
<p>works through what are called G-protein coupled receptors.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are about to pass out</p>
<p>from the amount of detail, just hang in there with me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not complicated.</p>
<p>There are two ways that neurons can communicate</p>
<p>or mainly two ways.</p>
<p>There are a third and a fourth,</p>
<p>but mostly neurons communicate by two modes.</p>
<p>One are what we call fast electrical synapses,</p>
<p>ionotropic conduction, all right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know what that means,</p>
<p>but basically one neuron activates another neuron</p>
<p>and little holes open up in that neuron and ions rush in.</p>
<p>Sodium is the main ion, salt,</p>
<p>by which one neuron influences the electrical activity</p>
<p>of another neuron because sodium ions contain a charge.</p>
<p>Okay, there are other things like chloride and potassium.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in looking this up, just look up.</p>
<p>Ionic conductance is in the action potential</p>
<p>or I could do a post on it sometime</p>
<p>and we could go into detail,</p>
<p>but just understand that when neurons want</p>
<p>to influence each other,</p>
<p>they can do it by way of this fast ionotropic conduction.</p>
<p>This is a really quick way for one neuron</p>
<p>to influence the next.</p>
<p>Dopamine doesn&rsquo;t communicate that way.</p>
<p>Dopamine is slower.</p>
<p>It works through what are called G protein</p>
<p>coupled receptors.</p>
<p>So what happens is dopamine is released</p>
<p>in these little vesicles that I&rsquo;ve mentioned before,</p>
<p>get vomited out into the synapse.</p>
<p>Some of that dopamine will bind</p>
<p>to the so-called postsynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll bind to the next neuron.</p>
<p>And then it sets off a cascade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a bucket brigade</p>
<p>of one thing getting handed off to the next,</p>
<p>to the next, to the next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s G protein coupled receptors.</p>
<p>And anytime you hear about these GPCRs</p>
<p>or G protein coupled receptors,</p>
<p>pay attention because they&rsquo;re really interesting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re slow, but they also can have multiple cascades</p>
<p>of effects.</p>
<p>They can impact even gene expression at some level.</p>
<p>They can change what a cell actually becomes.</p>
<p>They can change how well or how poorly that cell</p>
<p>will respond to the same signal in the future.</p>
<p>So dopamine works through the slower process,</p>
<p>these G protein coupled receptors.</p>
<p>And so its effects tend to take a while in order to occur.</p>
<p>This aspect of dopamine transmission is important</p>
<p>because it now underscores two things.</p>
<p>One, there&rsquo;s two pathways for dopamine to communicate,</p>
<p>one for movement, one for motivation and craving.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two spatial scales at which dopamine can operate</p>
<p>synaptically or volumetrically.</p>
<p>And dopamine can have slow effects, really slow effects</p>
<p>or even very long lasting effects.</p>
<p>And it even can control gene expression.</p>
<p>It can actually change the way that cells behave.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s not often discussed about dopamine,</p>
<p>but is extremely important to know</p>
<p>is that dopamine doesn&rsquo;t work on its own.</p>
<p>Neurons that release dopamine co-release glutamate.</p>
<p>Glutamate is a neurotransmitter</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a neurotransmitter that is excitatory,</p>
<p>meaning it stimulates neurons to be electrically active.</p>
<p>So now, even if you don&rsquo;t know any cell biology,</p>
<p>you should start to gain a picture that dopamine</p>
<p>is responsible for movement, motivation and drive.</p>
<p>It does that through two pathways,</p>
<p>but also the dopamine stimulates action in general</p>
<p>because it releases this excitatory neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>It tends to make certain neurons that are nearby</p>
<p>or even that are far away because of volumetric release,</p>
<p>it tends to make those more active.</p>
<p>So dopamine is really stimulating.</p>
<p>And indeed we say that dopaminergic transmission</p>
<p>or dopamine tends to stimulate sympathetic arousal.</p>
<p>Sympathetic doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with sympathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just simply means that it tends to increase</p>
<p>our levels of alertness.</p>
<p>It tends to bring an animal or a human into a state</p>
<p>of more alertness, readiness and desire to pursue things</p>
<p>outside the confines of its skin.</p>
<p>So if I were to just put a really simple message</p>
<p>around dopamine, it would be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a molecule in your brain and body</p>
<p>that when released tends to make you look outside yourself,</p>
<p>pursue things outside yourself</p>
<p>and to crave things outside yourself.</p>
<p>The pleasure that arrives from achieving things</p>
<p>also involves dopamine,</p>
<p>but is mainly the consequence of other molecules.</p>
<p>But if ever you felt lethargic and like just lazy</p>
<p>and you had no motivation or drive,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a low dopamine state.</p>
<p>If ever you felt really excited, motivated,</p>
<p>even if you were a little scared to do something,</p>
<p>maybe you did your first skydive</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re about to do your first skydive</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re about to do some public speaking</p>
<p>and you really don&rsquo;t want to screw it up.</p>
<p>You are in a high dopamine state.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a universal currency in all mammals,</p>
<p>but especially in humans for moving us toward goals</p>
<p>and how much dopamine is in our system at any one time</p>
<p>compared to how much dopamine was in our system</p>
<p>a few minutes ago</p>
<p>and how much we remember enjoying</p>
<p>a particular experience of the past.</p>
<p>That dictates your so-called quality of life</p>
<p>and your desire to pursue things.</p>
<p>This is really important.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a currency</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the way that you track pleasure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way that you track success.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way that you track</p>
<p>whether or not you are doing well or doing poorly.</p>
<p>And that is subjective.</p>
<p>But if your dopamine is too low,</p>
<p>you will not feel motivated.</p>
<p>If your dopamine is really high, you will feel motivated.</p>
<p>And if your dopamine is somewhere in the middle,</p>
<p>how you feel depends on whether or not</p>
<p>you had higher dopamine a few minutes ago</p>
<p>or lower dopamine.</p>
<p>This is important.</p>
<p>Your experience of life</p>
<p>and your level of motivation and drive</p>
<p>depends on how much dopamine you have</p>
<p>relative to your recent experience.</p>
<p>This is, again, something that&rsquo;s just not accounted for</p>
<p>in the simple language of dopamine hits, okay?</p>
<p>A simple way to envision dopamine hits</p>
<p>is every time you do something you like,</p>
<p>you eat a piece of chocolate, dopamine hit.</p>
<p>You look at your Instagram, dopamine hit.</p>
<p>You see someone you like, dopamine hit.</p>
<p>You know, all these things described as dopamine hits</p>
<p>neglect the fact that if you scroll social media</p>
<p>and you see something you really like, dopamine hit.</p>
<p>Sure, there&rsquo;s an increase in dopamine,</p>
<p>but then you get to something else</p>
<p>and you go, not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, had you arrived at that second thing first,</p>
<p>you might think that it was really interesting.</p>
<p>If you had arrived to that second Instagram post</p>
<p>three days later or four days later,</p>
<p>you might find it extremely interesting.</p>
<p>Again, how much dopamine you experience from something</p>
<p>depends on your baseline level of dopamine</p>
<p>when you arrive there and your previous dopamine peaks, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s super important to understand,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s completely neglected</p>
<p>by the general language of dopamine hits.</p>
<p>This is why when you repeatedly engage in something</p>
<p>that you enjoy, your threshold for enjoyment</p>
<p>goes up and up and up.</p>
<p>So I want to talk about that process</p>
<p>and I want to explain how that process works</p>
<p>because if you understand that process</p>
<p>and you understand some of these schedules and kinetics</p>
<p>as we call them around dopamine,</p>
<p>you will be in a terrific position</p>
<p>to use any dopamine enhancing tools that you decide to use.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be in an excellent position to modulate</p>
<p>and control your own dopamine release</p>
<p>for optimal motivation and drive.</p>
<p>I realized that was a lot of information</p>
<p>about the biology of dopamine,</p>
<p>sort of like trying to make you drink</p>
<p>from the fire hose of dopamine biology.</p>
<p>However, I realized that some people probably want</p>
<p>even more information about the biology</p>
<p>of dopamine transmission.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post a link to a absolutely stellar review</p>
<p>that was published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience</p>
<p>called Spatial and Temporal Scales of Dopamine Transmission.</p>
<p>It is quite detailed, but they have beautiful diagrams</p>
<p>and can walk you through all the things</p>
<p>that I just described and get into even more detail.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put a link to that in the caption on YouTube.</p>
<p>Right now, I want to share with you two anecdotes,</p>
<p>one from my own life and one from some fairly recent history</p>
<p>that illustrate some of the core biology of dopamine</p>
<p>and how profoundly it can shape our experience.</p>
<p>The first one is a really tragic situation that occurred.</p>
<p>This was in the 80s.</p>
<p>There was a outbreak of what looked</p>
<p>like Parkinsonian symptoms in a young population.</p>
<p>So many of you heard of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is a disease</p>
<p>in which people initially start to quake,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t generate smooth movements.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have issues with speech,</p>
<p>sometimes cognition as well.</p>
<p>There are examples like Michael J. Fox,</p>
<p>which are early onset Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Typically, it hits people a little bit later in life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a genetic component,</p>
<p>but there is this question</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s always been this question</p>
<p>whether or not certain lifestyle factors</p>
<p>can also create Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And some years ago, there was a situation</p>
<p>where street laboratories, illicit laboratories,</p>
<p>were trying to make a drug called MPPP,</p>
<p>which is an opioid-like compound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like heroin.</p>
<p>And heroin addicts seeking heroin went out</p>
<p>and bought what they thought was MPPP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was not MPPP.</p>
<p>I mean, it would have been tragic if it was anyway,</p>
<p>because they were drug addicts,</p>
<p>but what they ended up taking turned out to be a lot worse.</p>
<p>What they ended up taking was MPTP,</p>
<p>and MPTP can arise in the synthesis of MPPP.</p>
<p>So someone in a lab someplace,</p>
<p>this was mainly in the Central Valley in California,</p>
<p>but elsewhere as well,</p>
<p>somebody created MPTP.</p>
<p>And what ended up happening was a large number</p>
<p>of young people who were opioid addicts</p>
<p>became completely boxed in, paralyzed.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t speak, couldn&rsquo;t blink, couldn&rsquo;t do anything,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t function, couldn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>So both aspects of dopamine transmission were disrupted.</p>
<p>They had no motivation and drive.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t generate any movement of any kind.</p>
<p>They were literally locked in frozen.</p>
<p>And sadly, this is irreversible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s irreversible because what MPTP does</p>
<p>is it kills the dopaminergic neurons</p>
<p>of the substantia nigra, that nigrostriatal pathway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in generating movement.</p>
<p>And it kills the dopaminergic neurons</p>
<p>of the so-called mesocortico-limbic pathway.</p>
<p>I was in college when this whole MPTP thing happened.</p>
<p>And I remember hearing this story.</p>
<p>At the time, I had no understanding of what it is</p>
<p>to have very high levels of dopamine</p>
<p>or extremely depleted levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>There was no reason why I should have that understanding.</p>
<p>I mean, of course I had experienced different pleasures</p>
<p>of different kinds and I&rsquo;ve had lows in my life,</p>
<p>but nothing to the extreme that I&rsquo;m about to discuss.</p>
<p>I got giardia.</p>
<p>And giardia is a stomach bug</p>
<p>that if any of you ever had it, it is terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible diarrhea.</p>
<p>You end up very dehydrated very quickly.</p>
<p>You drop a ton of weight and it is extremely unpleasant.</p>
<p>I ended up going to the emergency room</p>
<p>and in the emergency room,</p>
<p>I begged them for something to stop up my guts</p>
<p>and they gave it to me.</p>
<p>They put a saline line in to rehydrate me</p>
<p>and they injected something into the saline bag.</p>
<p>And within minutes, I felt more sadness,</p>
<p>more overwhelming sense of depression,</p>
<p>basically lower than I&rsquo;d ever felt in my entire life.</p>
<p>It was absolutely profound.</p>
<p>I was crying endlessly without knowing why I was crying.</p>
<p>I was miserable.</p>
<p>And I asked them, what did you inject?</p>
<p>And they said, we injected Thorazine.</p>
<p>Thorazine is an antipsychotic drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually used to block dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s given to people who have schizophrenia,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s given to people who have schizophrenia</p>
<p>because schizophrenia involves among other things,</p>
<p>elevated levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>It was horrible.</p>
<p>The experience of it was miserable,</p>
<p>unlike anything I&rsquo;d ever experienced.</p>
<p>And so I actually said to them, what did you give me?</p>
<p>They said, Thorazine.</p>
<p>And I said, you have to give me L-DOPA.</p>
<p>You have to give me something</p>
<p>to get my dopamine levels back up again.</p>
<p>And they did.</p>
<p>They gave me an injection of L-DOPA into the bag</p>
<p>and it went straight into my bloodstream.</p>
<p>And within minutes, I felt fine again.</p>
<p>It was incredible.</p>
<p>And it really opened up my mind and my experience</p>
<p>to what it is to have absolutely plummeted levels</p>
<p>of dopamine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more miserable than that, I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>And these poor souls who had this MPTP experience,</p>
<p>unfortunately, they couldn&rsquo;t recover those cells.</p>
<p>People who have severe Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>are struggling with this as well,</p>
<p>because in Parkinson&rsquo;s and in Lewy body dementia,</p>
<p>the dopaminergic neurons often die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a problem</p>
<p>with those neurons releasing enough dopamine.</p>
<p>Later, we&rsquo;re going to talk about some approaches</p>
<p>to maintaining dopaminergic neuron health</p>
<p>and things that we can all do for that.</p>
<p>But I will tell you, these dopamine neurons</p>
<p>that we all have are very precious</p>
<p>for movement and mood and motivation.</p>
<p>Having experienced what it is to have very,</p>
<p>very low levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>or in this case, to have my dopamine receptors blocked</p>
<p>from Thorazine, was eye-opening to say the least,</p>
<p>and has given me tremendous sensitivity</p>
<p>to the fact that dopamine is perhaps</p>
<p>one of the most powerful molecules</p>
<p>that any of us has inside of us,</p>
<p>and the one that we ought to all think very carefully</p>
<p>about how we leverage.</p>
<p>Because while most experiences and most things that we do</p>
<p>and take and eat and et cetera,</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t create enormous highs and enormous lows in dopamine,</p>
<p>even subtle fluctuations in dopamine</p>
<p>really shape our perception of life</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re capable of and how we feel.</p>
<p>And so we want to guard those,</p>
<p>and we want to understand them.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s lean into that understanding about dopamine,</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s talk about some tools</p>
<p>that we can all use to leverage dopamine</p>
<p>in order to keep that baseline</p>
<p>in the appropriate healthy place,</p>
<p>and still be able to access those peaks in dopamine,</p>
<p>because those, after all,</p>
<p>are some of what makes life rich and worth living.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the baseline of dopamine</p>
<p>that we all have,</p>
<p>and the peaks in dopamine that we all can achieve</p>
<p>through different activities and things that we ingest.</p>
<p>All of us have different baseline levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>Some of this is sure to be genetic.</p>
<p>Some people just simply ride at a level a little bit higher.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a little bit more excited.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a little bit more motivated,</p>
<p>or maybe they&rsquo;re a lot more excited</p>
<p>or a lot more motivated.</p>
<p>Some people are a little mellower.</p>
<p>Some people are a little less excitable,</p>
<p>and some of that has to do with the fact</p>
<p>that dopamine doesn&rsquo;t act alone.</p>
<p>Dopamine has close cousins or friends in the nervous system,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just name off a few of those</p>
<p>close cousins and friends.</p>
<p>Epinephrine, also called adrenaline,</p>
<p>is the main chemical driver of energy.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do anything, anything at all,</p>
<p>unless we have some level of epinephrine</p>
<p>in our brain and body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released from the adrenal glands,</p>
<p>which ride atop our kidneys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released from an area of the brainstem</p>
<p>called locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>and its release tends to wake up neural circuits</p>
<p>in the brain and wake up various aspects</p>
<p>of our body&rsquo;s physiology and give us a readiness.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise</p>
<p>that dopamine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>aka adrenaline, hang out together.</p>
<p>In fact, epinephrine and adrenaline</p>
<p>are actually manufactured from dopamine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a biochemical pathway involving dopamine,</p>
<p>which is a beautiful pathway.</p>
<p>If ever you want to look it up,</p>
<p>you could just look up biochemistry of dopamine,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;ll find is that L-DOPA</p>
<p>is converted into dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is converted into noradrenaline,</p>
<p>norepinephrine, it&rsquo;s also called,</p>
<p>and noradrenaline, norepinephrine,</p>
<p>is converted into adrenaline.</p>
<p>So not only are dopamine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>aka adrenaline, close cousins,</p>
<p>they are actually family members, okay?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re closely related.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get too deep into epinephrine today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to talk too much about those pathways,</p>
<p>but anytime I&rsquo;m talking about dopaminergic transmission</p>
<p>or that you have a peak in dopamine,</p>
<p>inevitably that means that you have a peak</p>
<p>in release of epinephrine as well.</p>
<p>What dopamine does is dopamine really</p>
<p>colors the subjective experience of an activity</p>
<p>to make it more pleasurable,</p>
<p>to make it something that you want more of.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is more about energy.</p>
<p>Epinephrine alone can be fear, paralysis, trauma,</p>
<p>not physical paralysis, but mental paralysis,</p>
<p>you know, frozen in fear or being traumatized or scared.</p>
<p>But the addition of dopamine to that chemical cocktail,</p>
<p>if dopamine was released in the brain,</p>
<p>well then that epinephrine becomes one of excitement, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a broad brush here,</p>
<p>but essentially what you need to know</p>
<p>is that dopamine and epinephrine, aka adrenaline,</p>
<p>are family members and they tend to work together</p>
<p>like a little gang to make you seek out certain things.</p>
<p>So what sorts of activities,</p>
<p>what sorts of things increase dopamine</p>
<p>and how much do they increase dopamine?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s take a look at some typical things</p>
<p>that people do out there or ingest out there</p>
<p>that are known to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s recall that you have a baseline level of dopamine</p>
<p>and that everybody does.</p>
<p>And even within a family,</p>
<p>you might have family members who are very excitable,</p>
<p>happy, and motivated,</p>
<p>and others who are less excitable, happy, and motivated.</p>
<p>But your level of dopamine</p>
<p>has everything to do with those genetics,</p>
<p>but also with what you&rsquo;ve experienced in the previous days</p>
<p>and the previous months and so on.</p>
<p>When you do or ingest certain things,</p>
<p>your levels of dopamine will rise above baseline,</p>
<p>transiently.</p>
<p>And depending on what you do or ingest,</p>
<p>it will rise either more or less,</p>
<p>and it will be very brief or it&rsquo;ll last a long time.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the typical things</p>
<p>that people take and do and eat.</p>
<p>Some are good for us, some are not good for us.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s ask how much dopamine is increased above baseline.</p>
<p>Now, of course, these are averages,</p>
<p>but these are averages that have been measured</p>
<p>in so-called microdialysis studies in animals.</p>
<p>So actually extracting from particular brain areas</p>
<p>how much dopamine is released,</p>
<p>or from measuring the serum,</p>
<p>the circulating levels of dopamine in humans.</p>
<p>Chocolate.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t look at milk versus dark chocolate,</p>
<p>but chocolate will increase</p>
<p>your baseline level of dopamine 1.5 times.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s a pretty substantial increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s transient.</p>
<p>It goes away after a few minutes or even a few seconds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what determines the duration in a minute,</p>
<p>but 1.5 times for chocolate.</p>
<p>Sex.</p>
<p>Both the pursuit of sex and the act of sex</p>
<p>increases dopamine two times.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a doubling above baseline.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there&rsquo;s going to be variation there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the average increase in baseline dopamine</p>
<p>caused by sex.</p>
<p>Later, I will talk about how the different aspects</p>
<p>of the so-called arousal arc,</p>
<p>the different aspects of sex, believe it or not,</p>
<p>have a differential impact on dopamine.</p>
<p>But for now, as a general theme or activity,</p>
<p>sex doubles the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>circulating in your blood.</p>
<p>Nicotine.</p>
<p>In particular, nicotine that is smoked,</p>
<p>like cigarettes and so forth,</p>
<p>increases dopamine two and a half times above baseline.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a peak that goes up above baseline</p>
<p>two and a half times higher.</p>
<p>It is very short-lived.</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s ever been a chain smoker</p>
<p>or observed a chain smoker</p>
<p>understands that the increase in dopamine from nicotine</p>
<p>is very short-lived.</p>
<p>Cocaine will increase the level of dopamine</p>
<p>in the bloodstream two and a half times above baseline.</p>
<p>And amphetamine, another drug that increases dopamine,</p>
<p>will increase the amount of dopamine in the bloodstream</p>
<p>10 times above baseline.</p>
<p>A tremendous increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>Exercise.</p>
<p>Now, exercise will have a different impact</p>
<p>on the levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>depending on how much somebody subjectively</p>
<p>enjoys that exercise.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who loves running,</p>
<p>chances are it&rsquo;s going to increase your levels of dopamine</p>
<p>two times above your baseline.</p>
<p>Not unlike sex.</p>
<p>People who dislike exercise</p>
<p>will achieve less dopamine increase</p>
<p>or no increase in dopamine from exercise.</p>
<p>And if you like other forms of exercise,</p>
<p>like yoga or weightlifting or swimming or what have you,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s going to vary by your subjective experience</p>
<p>of whether or not you enjoy that activity.</p>
<p>This is important.</p>
<p>And it brings us back to something</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Remember that mesocortico-limbic pathway?</p>
<p>Well, the cortical part is important.</p>
<p>The cortical part actually has a very specific part,</p>
<p>which is your prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>The area of your forebrain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in thinking and planning</p>
<p>and involved in assigning a rational explanation</p>
<p>to something and involved in assigning</p>
<p>a subjective experience to something, right?</p>
<p>So for instance, the pen that I&rsquo;m holding right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of these Pilot V5s.</p>
<p>I love these Pilot V5s.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t sponsor the podcast.</p>
<p>I just happen to like them.</p>
<p>I like the way that they write, how they feel.</p>
<p>If I spent enough time thinking about it</p>
<p>or talking about it,</p>
<p>I could probably get a dopamine increase</p>
<p>just talking about this Pilot V5.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not because I have the propensity</p>
<p>to release dopamine easily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that as we start to engage with something</p>
<p>more and more and what we say about it</p>
<p>and what we encourage ourself to think about it</p>
<p>has a profound impact on its rewarding</p>
<p>or non-rewarding properties.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not simply the case that you can lie to yourself</p>
<p>and you can tell yourself, I love something.</p>
<p>And when you don&rsquo;t really love it</p>
<p>and it will increase dopamine.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s been found over and over again</p>
<p>is that if people journal about something</p>
<p>or they practice some form of appreciation for something</p>
<p>or they think of some aspect of something that they enjoy,</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine that that behavior will evoke</p>
<p>tends to go up.</p>
<p>So for people that hate exercise,</p>
<p>you can think about some aspect of exercise</p>
<p>that you really enjoy.</p>
<p>However, I will caution you against saying to yourself,</p>
<p>I hate exercise or I hate studying or I hate this person,</p>
<p>but I love the reward I give myself afterward.</p>
<p>Later we&rsquo;re going to talk about how rewards given afterward</p>
<p>actually make the situation worse.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t make you like exercise more or studying more.</p>
<p>They actually will undermine the dopamine release</p>
<p>that would otherwise occur for that activity.</p>
<p>So certain things, chemicals have a universal effect.</p>
<p>They make everybody&rsquo;s dopamine go up.</p>
<p>So some people like chocolate, some people don&rsquo;t of course,</p>
<p>but in general, it causes this increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>But sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine,</p>
<p>those things cause increases in dopamine</p>
<p>in everybody that takes them.</p>
<p>Things like exercise, studying, hard work,</p>
<p>working through a challenge in a relationship</p>
<p>or working through something hard of any kind,</p>
<p>that is going to be subjective</p>
<p>as to how much dopamine will be released.</p>
<p>And we will return to that subjective component</p>
<p>in a little bit.</p>
<p>But now you have a sense of how much dopamine</p>
<p>can be evoked by different activities</p>
<p>and by different substances.</p>
<p>One that you might be wondering about is caffeine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly drinking my caffeine today</p>
<p>and I do enjoy caffeine in limited quantities.</p>
<p>I drink yerba mate and I drink coffee and I love it.</p>
<p>Does it increase dopamine?</p>
<p>Well, a little bit.</p>
<p>Caffeine will increase dopamine to some extent,</p>
<p>but it is pretty modest compared to the other things</p>
<p>that I described, chocolate, sex, nicotine,</p>
<p>cocaine, amphetamine, and so on.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a really interesting paper</p>
<p>published in 2015.</p>
<p>This is Volkow et al.</p>
<p>You can look it up, it&rsquo;s very easy to find.</p>
<p>It showed that regular ingestion of caffeine,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s from coffee or otherwise,</p>
<p>increases upregulation of certain dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>So caffeine actually makes you able to experience</p>
<p>more of dopamine&rsquo;s effects.</p>
<p>Because as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>dopamine is vomited out into the synapse</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s released volumetrically,</p>
<p>but then it has to bind someplace</p>
<p>and trigger those G-protein coupled receptors.</p>
<p>And caffeine increases the number,</p>
<p>the density of those G-protein coupled receptors.</p>
<p>Now, sitting back and thinking about that,</p>
<p>you might think, oh yeah, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes I&rsquo;ll notice people, at least in the old days,</p>
<p>that it used to be a cigarette and a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Or when people drink alcohol, oftentimes they&rsquo;ll smoke.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s well known that different compounds</p>
<p>like alcohol and nicotine or caffeine and nicotine</p>
<p>or certain behaviors and certain drugs</p>
<p>can synergize to give bigger dopamine increases.</p>
<p>And this is not terribly uncommon.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people nowadays who, for instance,</p>
<p>take pre-workout energy drinks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll drink a, I won&rsquo;t name names,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll drink a canned energy drink</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll drink a pre-workout</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll try and get that big stimulation,</p>
<p>that stimulant effect for the dopamine, the norepinephrine,</p>
<p>that family of molecules that works together</p>
<p>to make you motivated.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll also exercise to try and get even more</p>
<p>of a dopaminergic experience out of that workout.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s also to perform better as well, of course.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;ll talk about in a few minutes,</p>
<p>that aspect or that approach rather</p>
<p>of trying to just get your dopamine</p>
<p>as high as you possibly can</p>
<p>in order to get the most out of an experience</p>
<p>turns out to not be the best approach.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll find as we talk about dopamine schedules</p>
<p>is that layering together multiple things,</p>
<p>substances and activities,</p>
<p>that lead to big increases in dopamine</p>
<p>actually can create pretty severe issues</p>
<p>with motivation and energy right after those experiences</p>
<p>and even a couple of days later.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that people shouldn&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>the occasional pre-workout if that&rsquo;s your thing</p>
<p>or drink a cup of coffee or two before working out</p>
<p>now and again.</p>
<p>Some people really enjoy that.</p>
<p>I certainly do that every once in a while.</p>
<p>But if you do it too often,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is that your capacity to release dopamine</p>
<p>and your level of motivation and drive and energy overall</p>
<p>will take a serious hit.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve been alluding to this dopamine peaks</p>
<p>versus dopamine baseline thing</p>
<p>since the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>Talked about tonic and phasic release and so forth.</p>
<p>But now let&rsquo;s really drill into what this means</p>
<p>and how to leverage it for our own purposes.</p>
<p>In order to do that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a step back and ask</p>
<p>why would we have a dopamine system like this?</p>
<p>Why would we have a dopamine system at all?</p>
<p>Well, we have to remember</p>
<p>what our species primary interest is.</p>
<p>Our species, like all species has a main interest</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s to make more of itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about sex and reproduction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about foraging for resources.</p>
<p>Resources can be food, it can be water, it can be salt,</p>
<p>can be shelter, can be social connection.</p>
<p>Dopamine is the universal currency</p>
<p>of foraging and seeking, right?</p>
<p>We call sometimes talk about motivation and craving,</p>
<p>but what we mean in the evolutionary adaptive context,</p>
<p>what we mean is foraging and seeking,</p>
<p>seeking water, seeking food, seeking mates,</p>
<p>seeking things that make us feel good</p>
<p>and avoiding things that don&rsquo;t make us feel good.</p>
<p>But in particular,</p>
<p>seeking things that will provide sustenance</p>
<p>and pleasure in the short term</p>
<p>and will extend the species in the longterm.</p>
<p>Once we understand that dopamine</p>
<p>is a driver for us to seek things,</p>
<p>it makes perfect sense as to why</p>
<p>it would have a baseline level and it would have peaks</p>
<p>and that the baseline and peaks would be related</p>
<p>in some sort of direct way.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I mean by that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you were not alive now,</p>
<p>but you were alive 10,000 years ago</p>
<p>and you woke up and you looked</p>
<p>and you realized you had minimal water</p>
<p>and you had minimal food left.</p>
<p>Maybe you have a child, maybe you have a partner,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re in an entire village,</p>
<p>but you realize that you need things, okay?</p>
<p>You need to be able to generate the energy</p>
<p>to go seek those things.</p>
<p>And chances are there were dangers in seeking those things.</p>
<p>Yes, it could be saber-toothed tigers</p>
<p>and things of that sort,</p>
<p>but there are other dangers too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the danger of a cut to your skin</p>
<p>that could lead to infection.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the danger of storms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the danger of cold.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the danger of leaving your loved ones behind.</p>
<p>So you go out and forage, right?</p>
<p>You could be hunting, you could be gathering,</p>
<p>or you could be doing both.</p>
<p>The going out and foraging process was,</p>
<p>we are certain, driven by dopamine.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no fossil record of the brain,</p>
<p>but these circuits have existed, we know,</p>
<p>for tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years</p>
<p>and they are present in every animal, not just mammals,</p>
<p>but even in little worms like sea aliens,</p>
<p>the same process is mediated by dopamine.</p>
<p>So dopamine drives you to go out and look for things.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s say you find a couple of berries</p>
<p>and these ones are rotten, these ones are good.</p>
<p>Maybe you hunt an animal and kill it,</p>
<p>or you find an animal that was recently killed</p>
<p>and you decide to take the meat.</p>
<p>You are going to achieve, or I should say,</p>
<p>experience some sort of dopamine release.</p>
<p>You found the reward, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But then it needs to return to some lower level.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, because if you just stayed there,</p>
<p>you would never continue to forage for more.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just increase your baseline and then stay there,</p>
<p>it goes back down.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>is that it doesn&rsquo;t just go back down</p>
<p>to the level it was before,</p>
<p>it goes down to a level below what it was</p>
<p>before you went out seeking that thing.</p>
<p>Now, this is counterintuitive.</p>
<p>We often think, oh, okay, I&rsquo;m going to pursue the win.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s move this to modern day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to run this marathon,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to train for this marathon.</p>
<p>Then you run the marathon and you finish,</p>
<p>you cross the finish line, you feel great.</p>
<p>And you would think, okay, now I&rsquo;m set for the entire year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to feel so much better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to feel this accomplishment in my body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be so great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what happens.</p>
<p>You might feel some of those things,</p>
<p>but your level of dopamine</p>
<p>has actually dropped below baseline.</p>
<p>Now, eventually it will ratchet back up,</p>
<p>but two things are really important.</p>
<p>First of all, the extent to which it drops below baseline</p>
<p>is proportional to how high the peak was.</p>
<p>So if you cross the finish line pretty happy,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t drop that much below baseline afterward.</p>
<p>If you cross the finish line ecstatic,</p>
<p>well, a day or two later,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel quite a bit lower</p>
<p>than you would otherwise.</p>
<p>You might not be depressed</p>
<p>because it depends on where that baseline was to begin with,</p>
<p>but the so-called postpartum depression</p>
<p>that people experience after giving birth</p>
<p>or after some big win, a graduation,</p>
<p>or any kind of celebration,</p>
<p>that postpartum drop in mood and affect and motivation</p>
<p>is the drop in baseline dopamine.</p>
<p>This is very important to understand</p>
<p>because this happens on very rapid timescales</p>
<p>and it can last quite a long time.</p>
<p>It also explains the behavior</p>
<p>that most of us are familiar with</p>
<p>of engaging in something that we really enjoy,</p>
<p>going to a restaurant that we absolutely love</p>
<p>or engaging in some way with some person</p>
<p>that we really, really enjoy.</p>
<p>But if we continue to engage in that behavior</p>
<p>over and over again, it kind of loses its edge.</p>
<p>It starts to kind of feel less exciting to us.</p>
<p>Some of us experience that drop in excitement</p>
<p>more quickly and more severely than others,</p>
<p>but everyone experiences that to some extent.</p>
<p>And this has direct roots</p>
<p>in these evolutionarily conserved circuits.</p>
<p>Some of you may be hearing this and think,</p>
<p>no, no, no, that&rsquo;s not how it works for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just riding higher and higher all the time.</p>
<p>I love my kids.</p>
<p>I love my job.</p>
<p>I love school.</p>
<p>I love wins.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want losses.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>We all feel good when we are achieving things,</p>
<p>but oftentimes we are feeling good</p>
<p>because we are layering in different aspects of life,</p>
<p>consuming things and doing things</p>
<p>that increase our dopamine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting those peaks,</p>
<p>but afterward the drop in baseline occurs</p>
<p>and it always takes a little while</p>
<p>to get back to our stable baseline.</p>
<p>We really all have a sort of dopamine set point.</p>
<p>And if we continue to indulge in the same behaviors</p>
<p>or even different behaviors that increase our dopamine,</p>
<p>over and over and over again,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t experience the same level of joy</p>
<p>from those behaviors or from anything at all.</p>
<p>Now that has a name, it&rsquo;s called addiction,</p>
<p>but even for people who aren&rsquo;t addicted,</p>
<p>even for people who don&rsquo;t have an attachment</p>
<p>to any specific substance or behavior,</p>
<p>this drop in below baseline after any peak in dopamine</p>
<p>is substantial and it governs whether or not</p>
<p>we are going to feel motivated</p>
<p>to continue to pursue other things.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a way to work with this</p>
<p>such that we can constantly stay motivated,</p>
<p>but also keep that baseline of dopamine</p>
<p>at an appropriate healthy level.</p>
<p>A previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>was Dr. Anna Lembke.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s head of the Addiction Dual Diagnosis Clinic</p>
<p>at Stanford, has this amazing book,</p>
<p>Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read the book,</p>
<p>I highly encourage you to check it out, it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>The other terrific book about dopamine</p>
<p>is The Molecule of More, which is similar in some regard,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t so much about addiction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more about other types of behaviors.</p>
<p>Both books really focus on these dopamine schedules</p>
<p>and the relationship between these peaks</p>
<p>and baselines of dopamine.</p>
<p>In Dr. Lembke&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>and when she was on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>another podcast, she&rsquo;s talked about</p>
<p>this pleasure-pain balance,</p>
<p>that when we seek something that we really like</p>
<p>or we indulge in it, like eating a little piece of chocolate</p>
<p>if we really like chocolate, there&rsquo;s some pleasure,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s a little bit of pain</p>
<p>that exceeds the amount of pleasure, and it&rsquo;s subtle,</p>
<p>and we experience it as wanting more of that thing.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a pleasure-pain balance,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m telling you that the pleasure and the pain</p>
<p>are governed by dopamine to some extent.</p>
<p>Well, how could that be, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before, when you engage in an activity</p>
<p>or when you ingest something that increases dopamine,</p>
<p>the dopamine levels go up to substantial degree</p>
<p>with all the things I listed off.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the pain coming from?</p>
<p>Well, the pain is coming from the lack of dopamine</p>
<p>that follows, and you now know</p>
<p>what that lack of dopamine reflects.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>Well, earlier we were talking about</p>
<p>how dopamine is released between neurons,</p>
<p>and I mentioned two ways.</p>
<p>One is into the synapse,</p>
<p>where it can activate the postsynaptic neuron,</p>
<p>and the other was what I called volumetric release,</p>
<p>where it is distributed more broadly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released out over a bunch of neurons.</p>
<p>In both cases, it&rsquo;s released from these things</p>
<p>we call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles,</p>
<p>tiny, tiny little bubbles that contain dopamine.</p>
<p>They get vomited out into the area or into the synapse.</p>
<p>Well, those vesicles get depleted.</p>
<p>For the synaptic physiologists out there,</p>
<p>we call this the readily releasable pool of dopamine.</p>
<p>We can only deploy dopamine that is ready to be deployed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s packaged in those little vesicles and ready to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you order a product</p>
<p>and they say out of stock until two months from now,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s not ready to be released.</p>
<p>Same thing with dopamine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pool of dopamine that&rsquo;s synthesized,</p>
<p>and you can only release the dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been synthesized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the readily releasable pool.</p>
<p>The pleasure-pain balance doesn&rsquo;t only hinge</p>
<p>on the readily releasable pool of dopamine,</p>
<p>but a big part of the pleasure-pain balance</p>
<p>hinges on how much dopamine is there</p>
<p>and how much is ready and capable</p>
<p>of being released into the system.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve given some meat to this thing</p>
<p>that we call the pleasure-pain balance.</p>
<p>And now it should make perfect sense</p>
<p>why if you take something or do something</p>
<p>that leads to huge increases in dopamine,</p>
<p>afterward, your baseline should drop</p>
<p>because there isn&rsquo;t a lot of dopamine around</p>
<p>to keep your baseline going.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most people do not experience</p>
<p>or pursue enormous increases in dopamine</p>
<p>leading to these severe drops in baseline.</p>
<p>Many people do, however,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we call addiction.</p>
<p>When somebody pursues a drug or an activity</p>
<p>that leads to huge increases in dopamine,</p>
<p>and now you understand that afterward</p>
<p>the baseline of dopamine drops</p>
<p>because of depletion of dopamine,</p>
<p>the readily releasable pool,</p>
<p>the dopamine is literally not around to be released,</p>
<p>and so people feel pretty lousy.</p>
<p>And many people make the mistake</p>
<p>of then going and pursuing the dopamine-evoking,</p>
<p>the dopamine-releasing activity or substance again,</p>
<p>thinking mistakenly that it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to bring up their baseline,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to give them that peak again.</p>
<p>Not only does it not give them a peak,</p>
<p>their baseline gets lower and lower</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re depleting dopamine more and more and more.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen this over and over again,</p>
<p>when people get addicted to something,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re not achieving much pleasure at all.</p>
<p>You can even see this with video games.</p>
<p>People will play a video game, they love it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super exciting to them,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll keep playing and playing and playing,</p>
<p>and either one of two things happens, typically both.</p>
<p>First of all, we say addiction is a progressive narrowing</p>
<p>of the things that bring you pleasure.</p>
<p>So oftentimes what will happen is the person</p>
<p>only has excitement and can achieve dopamine release</p>
<p>to the same extent doing that behavior</p>
<p>and not other behaviors.</p>
<p>And so they start losing interest in school,</p>
<p>they start losing interest in relationships,</p>
<p>they start losing interest in fitness and wellbeing</p>
<p>and depletes their life.</p>
<p>And eventually what typically happens</p>
<p>is they will stop getting dopamine release</p>
<p>from that activity as well.</p>
<p>And then they drop into a pretty serious depression</p>
<p>and this can get very severe and people have committed</p>
<p>suicide from these sorts of patterns of activity.</p>
<p>But what about the more typical scenario?</p>
<p>What about the scenario of somebody who is really good</p>
<p>at working during the week, they exercise during the week,</p>
<p>they drink on the weekends?</p>
<p>Well, that person is only consuming alcohol</p>
<p>maybe one or two nights a week,</p>
<p>but oftentimes that same person will be spiking</p>
<p>their dopamine with food during the middle of the week.</p>
<p>Now we all have to eat and it&rsquo;s nice to eat foods</p>
<p>that we enjoy, I certainly do that, I love food in fact.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re eating foods that really evoke</p>
<p>a lot of dopamine release in the middle of the week,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re drinking one or two days on the weekend,</p>
<p>they are one of these work hard, play hard types.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re swimming a couple miles in the ocean</p>
<p>in the middle of the week as well,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going out dancing once on the weekend,</p>
<p>sounds like a pretty balanced life as I describe it.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that dopamine is not just evoked</p>
<p>by one of these activities, dopamine is evoked</p>
<p>by all of these activities.</p>
<p>And dopamine is one currency of craving motivation</p>
<p>and desire and pleasure, there&rsquo;s only one currency.</p>
<p>So even though if you look at the activities,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, well, it&rsquo;s just on the weekends</p>
<p>or this thing is only a couple times a week.</p>
<p>If you looked at dopamine simply as a function,</p>
<p>as a chemical function of peaks and baseline,</p>
<p>it might make sense why this person after several years</p>
<p>of work hard, play hard would say, yeah, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling kind of burnt out, I&rsquo;m just not feeling</p>
<p>like I have the same energy that I did a few years ago.</p>
<p>And of course there are age related reasons</p>
<p>why people can experience drops in energy,</p>
<p>but oftentimes what&rsquo;s happening is not some sort</p>
<p>of depletion in cellular metabolism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to aging.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening is they&rsquo;re spiking their dopamine</p>
<p>through so many different activities throughout the week</p>
<p>that their baseline is progressively dropping.</p>
<p>And in this case, it can be very subtle.</p>
<p>It can be very, very subtle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually a very sinister function of dopamine,</p>
<p>we could say, which is that it can often drop</p>
<p>in imperceptible ways, but then once it reaches</p>
<p>the threshold of low dopamine, we just feel like,</p>
<p>hmm, we can&rsquo;t really get pleasure from anything anymore.</p>
<p>What used to work doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>
<p>So it starts to look a lot like the more severe addictions</p>
<p>or the more acute addictions to things like cocaine</p>
<p>and amphetamine, which lead to these big increases,</p>
<p>these big spikes in dopamine,</p>
<p>and then these very severe drops in the baseline.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we all should engage</p>
<p>in activities that we enjoy.</p>
<p>I certainly do, everybody should.</p>
<p>A huge part of life is pursuing activities</p>
<p>and things that we enjoy.</p>
<p>The key thing is to understand this relationship</p>
<p>between the peaks and the baseline</p>
<p>and to understand how they influence one another.</p>
<p>Because once you do that, you can start to make</p>
<p>really good choices in the short run and in the long run</p>
<p>to maintain your level of dopamine baseline,</p>
<p>maybe even raise that level of dopamine baseline</p>
<p>and still get those peaks and still achieve those feelings</p>
<p>of elevated motivation, elevated desire, and craving.</p>
<p>Because again, those peaks and having a sufficiently healthy</p>
<p>high level of dopamine baseline are what drove</p>
<p>the evolution of our species.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really what drive the evolution</p>
<p>of anyone&rsquo;s life progression too.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re a good thing.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a good thing.</p>
<p>Just very briefly, because it was also covered</p>
<p>in the interview episode I did with Anna Lembke</p>
<p>about addiction.</p>
<p>Some of you might be asking, what should I do</p>
<p>if I experience a drop in my baseline level of dopamine</p>
<p>because of engagement with some activity or some substance</p>
<p>that led to big peaks?</p>
<p>Just to put some color and example on this,</p>
<p>a few episodes ago, I talked about a friend</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ve known a long time.</p>
<p>So actually the child of a friend who has basically</p>
<p>become addicted to video games.</p>
<p>He decided actually after seeing that episode with Anna</p>
<p>to do a 30 day complete fast from phone,</p>
<p>from video games, and from social media of all kinds.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now at day 29.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really accomplished this.</p>
<p>Not incidentally, his levels of concentration,</p>
<p>his overall mood are up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing far, far better.</p>
<p>What he did is hard in particular the first 14 days</p>
<p>is really hard, but the way that you replenish</p>
<p>the releasable pool of dopamine is to not engage</p>
<p>in these dopaminergic seeking behaviors.</p>
<p>Because remember, typically people arrive at a place</p>
<p>where they want to stop engaging in these behaviors</p>
<p>or ingesting substances when that dopamine is depleted,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re not getting the same lift.</p>
<p>In his case, he was feeling depressed.</p>
<p>He thought he had ADHD.</p>
<p>They were starting to treat it as ADHD.</p>
<p>And certainly there are people out there who have ADHD,</p>
<p>but what he found was that his levels of concentration</p>
<p>are back.</p>
<p>He does not need to be treated for ADHD.</p>
<p>And actually the psychiatrist wondered if he did</p>
<p>prior to this video game, social media fast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s feeling good.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s exercising again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making this up.</p>
<p>This is really a very specific,</p>
<p>but very relevant example of how the dopamine system</p>
<p>can replenish itself.</p>
<p>Of course, if there&rsquo;s a clinical need for ADHD treatment</p>
<p>by all means pursue that.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of ADHD does go misdiagnosed</p>
<p>because of this depletion in dopamine that occurs</p>
<p>because of overindulgence and other activities</p>
<p>in the drop in baseline.</p>
<p>So for anyone that&rsquo;s experienced a real drop in baseline</p>
<p>who has addictive tendencies,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re behaviors or substances,</p>
<p>that is always going to be the path forward</p>
<p>is going to be either cold turkey</p>
<p>or through some sort of tapering to limit interactions</p>
<p>with what would otherwise be the dopamine evoking behavior</p>
<p>or substance.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the optimal way to engage in activities</p>
<p>or to consume things that evoke dopamine.</p>
<p>And by no means am I encouraging people</p>
<p>to take drugs of abuse.</p>
<p>I would not do that.</p>
<p>I am not doing that.</p>
<p>But some of the things on these lists of dopamine</p>
<p>evoking activities are things like chocolate, coffee,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s indirect, sex and reproduction</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s healthy, consensual, context appropriate,</p>
<p>age appropriate, species appropriate, of course,</p>
<p>is central to our evolution and progression as a species.</p>
<p>So certain things like cocaine, amphetamine,</p>
<p>I will put in the classification of bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to do that.</p>
<p>And other things are part of life,</p>
<p>food, exercise, if that evokes your dopamine.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to engage</p>
<p>with these dopamine evoking activities</p>
<p>in ways that are healthy and beneficial for us?</p>
<p>How do we achieve these peaks,</p>
<p>which are so central to our wellbeing</p>
<p>and experience of life without dropping our baseline?</p>
<p>And the key lies in intermittent release of dopamine.</p>
<p>The real key is to not expect</p>
<p>or chase high levels of dopamine release</p>
<p>every time we engage in these activities.</p>
<p>Intermittent reward schedules are the central schedule</p>
<p>by which casinos keep you gambling,</p>
<p>the central schedule by which elusive partners</p>
<p>or potential partners keep you texting</p>
<p>and pursuing on either side of the relationship.</p>
<p>Intermittent schedules are the way that the internet</p>
<p>and social media and all highly engaging activities</p>
<p>keep you motivated and pursuing.</p>
<p>And we can take this back</p>
<p>to our evolutionary adaptive scenario</p>
<p>where you are out there looking for water, looking for food,</p>
<p>not every trail, not every pursuit,</p>
<p>not every hunch about where the animals will be,</p>
<p>where the food will be, where the berries will be,</p>
<p>not every single one of those played out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called dopamine reward prediction error.</p>
<p>When we expect something to happen,</p>
<p>we are highly motivated to pursue it.</p>
<p>If it happens, great, we get the reward.</p>
<p>The reward comes in various chemical forms,</p>
<p>including dopamine.</p>
<p>And we are more likely to engage in that behavior again.</p>
<p>This is the basis of casino gambling.</p>
<p>This is how they keep you going back</p>
<p>again and again and again,</p>
<p>even though on average the house really does win.</p>
<p>You can transplant that example</p>
<p>to any number of different pleasureful activities.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not a gambler</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t appeal to you,</p>
<p>I have to imagine there&rsquo;s something that appeals to you,</p>
<p>something that you do repeatedly because you enjoy it.</p>
<p>And almost inevitably it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an intermittent schedule.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a intermittent schedule</p>
<p>by which dopamine sometimes arrives,</p>
<p>sometimes a little bit, sometimes a lot,</p>
<p>sometimes a medium amount, okay?</p>
<p>That intermittent reinforcement schedule</p>
<p>is actually the best schedule to export to other activities.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>First of all, if you are engaged in activities,</p>
<p>school, sport, relationship, et cetera,</p>
<p>where you experience a win,</p>
<p>you should be very careful about allowing yourself</p>
<p>to experience huge peaks in dopamine,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re willing to suffer the crash that follows</p>
<p>and waiting a period of time for it to come back up.</p>
<p>What would this look like in the practical sense?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say you are somebody</p>
<p>who really does enjoy exercise,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re somebody who kind of likes exercise,</p>
<p>but forces yourself to do it,</p>
<p>but you make it pleasureful by giving yourself</p>
<p>your favorite cup of coffee first,</p>
<p>or maybe taking a pre-workout drink,</p>
<p>or taking an energy drink,</p>
<p>or listening to your favorite music.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re in the gym and you&rsquo;re listening to music.</p>
<p>That all sounds great, right?</p>
<p>Well, it is great, except that by layering together</p>
<p>all these things to try and achieve that dopamine release,</p>
<p>and by getting a big peak in dopamine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually increasing the number of conditions required</p>
<p>to achieve pleasure from that activity again.</p>
<p>And so there is a form of this</p>
<p>where sometimes you do all the things that you love</p>
<p>to get the optimal workout.</p>
<p>You listen to your favorite music.</p>
<p>You go at your favorite time of day.</p>
<p>You have your pre-workout drink, if that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>You do all the things that give you that best experience</p>
<p>of the workout for you.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a version of this</p>
<p>where sometimes you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>the dopamine enhancing activities.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t ingest anything to increase your dopamine.</p>
<p>You just do the exercise.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do the exercise and expect dopamine to arrive</p>
<p>through some, what we call exogenous source as well.</p>
<p>You may think, well, that sounds lame.</p>
<p>I want to continue to enjoy exercising.</p>
<p>Ah, well, that&rsquo;s exactly the point.</p>
<p>If you want to maintain motivation for school,</p>
<p>exercise, relationships, or pursuits</p>
<p>of any duration and kind,</p>
<p>the key thing is to make sure that the peak in dopamine,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s very high, doesn&rsquo;t occur too often.</p>
<p>And if something does occur very often,</p>
<p>that you vary how much dopamine you experience</p>
<p>with each engagement in that activity.</p>
<p>Now, some activities naturally have</p>
<p>this intermittent property woven into them, right?</p>
<p>We sometimes have classes that we like</p>
<p>and other classes we don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t always get straight A&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Sometimes we don&rsquo;t get rewarded</p>
<p>with the outcome that we would like.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t always have the perfect relationship outcome.</p>
<p>But understand that your ability to experience motivation</p>
<p>and pleasure for what comes next is dictated</p>
<p>by how much motivation and pleasure</p>
<p>and dopamine you experienced prior.</p>
<p>The reason I can&rsquo;t give a very specific protocol</p>
<p>like delete dopamine or lower dopamine every third time</p>
<p>is that that wouldn&rsquo;t be intermittent.</p>
<p>The whole basis of intermittent reinforcement</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t really have a specific schedule</p>
<p>of when dopamine is going to be high</p>
<p>and when dopamine is going to be low</p>
<p>and when dopamine is going to be medium.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a predictable schedule,</p>
<p>not a random intermittent schedule.</p>
<p>So do like the casinos do, certainly works for them.</p>
<p>And for activities that you would like to continue</p>
<p>to engage in over time, whatever those happen to be,</p>
<p>start paying attention to the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>and excitement and pleasure that you achieve with those</p>
<p>and start modulating that somewhat at random.</p>
<p>That might be removing some of the dopamine</p>
<p>releasing chemicals that you might take prior.</p>
<p>Maybe you remove them every time,</p>
<p>but then every once in a while you introduce them.</p>
<p>Maybe it involves sometimes doing things socially</p>
<p>that you enjoy doing socially,</p>
<p>sometimes doing the same thing, but alone.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different ways to do this.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different ways to approach this,</p>
<p>but now knowing what you know about peaks</p>
<p>and baselines and dopamine and understanding</p>
<p>how important it is not just to achieve peaks,</p>
<p>but to maintain that baseline at a healthy level,</p>
<p>it should be straightforward for you to implement</p>
<p>these intermittent schedules.</p>
<p>For those of you that are begging for more specificity,</p>
<p>we can give you a tool.</p>
<p>One would be you can flip a coin before engaging</p>
<p>in any of these types of activities and decide</p>
<p>whether or not you are going to allow</p>
<p>other dopamine supportive elements to go, for instance,</p>
<p>into the gym with you.</p>
<p>Are you going to listen to music or not?</p>
<p>If you enjoy listening to music, well then flip a coin.</p>
<p>And if it comes up heads, bring the music in.</p>
<p>If it comes up tails, don&rsquo;t, okay?</p>
<p>Sounds like you&rsquo;re undercutting your own progress,</p>
<p>but actually you are serving your own progress,</p>
<p>both short-term and long-term by doing that.</p>
<p>Now the smartphone is a very interesting tool</p>
<p>for dopamine in light of all this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely common nowadays to see people texting</p>
<p>and doing selfies and communicating in various ways,</p>
<p>listening to podcasts, listening to music,</p>
<p>doing all sorts of things while they engage</p>
<p>in other activities or going to dinner</p>
<p>and texting other people or making plans,</p>
<p>sharing information, that&rsquo;s all wonderful.</p>
<p>It gives depth and richness and color to life.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t just about our distracted nature</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re engaging with the phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a way of layering in dopamine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no surprise that levels of depression</p>
<p>and lack of motivation are really on the increase.</p>
<p>Everything that we&rsquo;ve talked about until now</p>
<p>sets up an explanation or an interpretation</p>
<p>of why interacting with digital technology</p>
<p>can potentially lead to disruptions or lowering</p>
<p>in baseline levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>I can use a personal example for this.</p>
<p>I happen to really enjoy working out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>But in recent years, I noticed that</p>
<p>if I was bringing my phone to my workouts,</p>
<p>then not only was I a little bit more distracted</p>
<p>and not focusing on what I was doing</p>
<p>as much as I could have or should have,</p>
<p>but also I started to lose interest in what I was doing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as pleasurable.</p>
<p>I would feel like it just didn&rsquo;t have the same kind of oomph</p>
<p>and I was beginning to question my motivation.</p>
<p>As I started learning more about this relationship</p>
<p>between the peaks and the baselines and dopamine,</p>
<p>what I realized was that some time ago,</p>
<p>I probably experienced a incredible increase</p>
<p>in the amount of dopamine during one of my workouts</p>
<p>because I enjoy working out and I enjoy listening to music.</p>
<p>I also enjoy listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>I also enjoy communicating with people.</p>
<p>Those are all wonderful pursuits,</p>
<p>but I had layered in too many of them too many times.</p>
<p>And then it essentially wasn&rsquo;t working for me anymore,</p>
<p>much in the same way a drug wouldn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>for somebody who takes it repeatedly</p>
<p>because their baseline of dopamine is dropping.</p>
<p>So at least for this calendar year,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a rule for myself,</p>
<p>which is I don&rsquo;t allow my phone into my workouts at all.</p>
<p>No music, at least not from the phone.</p>
<p>It can be in the room.</p>
<p>I might listen to a podcast in the room,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t listen to anything</p>
<p>or engage in anything on my phone, no texting whatsoever.</p>
<p>And most of the time,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t even bring it with me for that period of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a short period of time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not training that often.</p>
<p>This is something that I think has been misinterpreted</p>
<p>as people can&rsquo;t be alone now.</p>
<p>People talk about, oh, you know,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t walk across the street</p>
<p>or they can&rsquo;t go anywhere, ride the bus,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be on the plane without being in contact.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t handle just their thoughts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s happened is that we achieved</p>
<p>the great dopamine increase</p>
<p>that comes from this incredible thing,</p>
<p>which I personally enjoy being able to communicate</p>
<p>by phone, by text and exchange pictures</p>
<p>and send links and these kinds of things, social media.</p>
<p>But then what happens is it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that same fulfilling aspect to it.</p>
<p>And it tends to remove the excitement and the pleasure</p>
<p>of the very activities that we are engaged in.</p>
<p>So I know this is a hard one for many people,</p>
<p>but I do invite you to try removing multiple sources</p>
<p>of dopamine release or what used to be multiple sources</p>
<p>of dopamine release from activities</p>
<p>that you want to continue to enjoy</p>
<p>or that you want to enjoy more.</p>
<p>And now you understand the biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that would underlie a statement like that.</p>
<p>It takes a little bit of working with.</p>
<p>I know it can be challenging in the first week or so</p>
<p>of not engaging with the phone during any kind of workout.</p>
<p>That actually was really tough,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m back to a place where I enjoy it that much more.</p>
<p>I also feel as if I conquered something</p>
<p>in terms of the circuitry related to dopamine.</p>
<p>I now understand why something that I enjoyed so much</p>
<p>had become less pleasurable for me.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a deep, deep satisfaction</p>
<p>that comes from understanding,</p>
<p>okay, there wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong with me</p>
<p>or what I was doing or anything at all.</p>
<p>It was just, there was something wrong</p>
<p>with the approach I was taking,</p>
<p>which was layering in all these sources of dopamine</p>
<p>and dropping my baseline.</p>
<p>For this very same reason,</p>
<p>I caution people against using stimulants</p>
<p>every time they study or every time they work out</p>
<p>or every time that they do anything</p>
<p>that they would like to continue to enjoy</p>
<p>and be motivated at.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one exception, which is caffeine,</p>
<p>because I mentioned before, if you like caffeine,</p>
<p>that actually could be a good thing for your dopamine system</p>
<p>because it does up-regulate these D2, D3 receptors.</p>
<p>So it actually makes whatever dopamine</p>
<p>is released by that activity more accessible</p>
<p>or more functional within the biochemistry</p>
<p>and the pathways of your brain and body.</p>
<p>However, a number of energy drinks</p>
<p>and in particular pre-workouts contain things</p>
<p>that are precursors to dopamine and on their own,</p>
<p>even if you didn&rsquo;t engage in the activity,</p>
<p>would cause the release of dopamine to a substantial degree.</p>
<p>They do cause the release of dopamine</p>
<p>to a substantial degree.</p>
<p>And over time, that will deplete your dopamine.</p>
<p>So energy drinks, pre-workout drinks,</p>
<p>drugs of various kinds that people take to study</p>
<p>and pay attention.</p>
<p>We talked about some of these for the ADHD episode,</p>
<p>things like Adderall, Ritalin, armodafinil, modafinil,</p>
<p>taken repeatedly over time will reduce</p>
<p>the level of satisfaction and joy that you get</p>
<p>from the activities you engage in</p>
<p>while under the influence of those compounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to demonize those compounds</p>
<p>for their clinical use.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is taking stimulants</p>
<p>and then engaging in activities</p>
<p>that you would like to continue to feel pleasurable</p>
<p>is undercutting the process.</p>
<p>And inevitably, it might not happen tomorrow,</p>
<p>might not happen in a month,</p>
<p>but inevitably you will have challenges</p>
<p>with motivation and drive related to those activities.</p>
<p>Now, some people can keep it right in check.</p>
<p>They can just do the one can of the energy drink</p>
<p>or they only do their pre-workout</p>
<p>before really hard days, for instance.</p>
<p>More power to you.</p>
<p>I actually do that sometimes, frankly.</p>
<p>But people who are trying to get into that peak,</p>
<p>super motivated, driven, driven state,</p>
<p>really focused every time they engage in an activity,</p>
<p>you are absolutely undercutting the process</p>
<p>and you are undermining your ability</p>
<p>to stay motivated and focused.</p>
<p>So just as we talked about intermittent reward schedules</p>
<p>a moment ago, intermittent spiking of dopamine,</p>
<p>if you do it at all, is definitely the way to go.</p>
<p>And chronically trying to spike your dopamine</p>
<p>in order to enhance your motivation, focus, and drive</p>
<p>will absolutely undermine your motivation, focus,</p>
<p>and drive in the long run.</p>
<p>Ingestion of caffeine is somewhat of an exception</p>
<p>among the other examples of things I&rsquo;ve mentioned to avoid</p>
<p>before what would otherwise be</p>
<p>dopamine increasing activities.</p>
<p>Because again, caffeine can increase the density</p>
<p>and the efficacy of these dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>It turns out that the source of caffeine could also matter.</p>
<p>While coffee or tea or other forms of caffeine</p>
<p>will have this effect of increasing dopamine receptors,</p>
<p>yerba mate, something I&rsquo;ve talked about before</p>
<p>on this podcast, has some interesting properties.</p>
<p>First of all, it contains caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also high in antioxidants.</p>
<p>It also contains something called GLP-1,</p>
<p>which is favorable for management of blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Yerba mate, it turns out, has also been shown</p>
<p>to be neuroprotective specifically for dopaminergic neurons.</p>
<p>Now I should mention, this is just a couple of studies,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t want to conclude too much from these studies.</p>
<p>More needs to be done.</p>
<p>But they showed that in a model of damage to dopamine neurons</p>
<p>ingestion of yerba mate and some of the compounds</p>
<p>within yerba mate can actually serve to preserve</p>
<p>the survival of dopamine neurons</p>
<p>in both the movement-related pathway</p>
<p>and the motivation pathway.</p>
<p>So perhaps you need that incentive</p>
<p>in order to ingest yerba mate tea.</p>
<p>Perhaps you don&rsquo;t need any incentive.</p>
<p>In my case, I don&rsquo;t need any incentive.</p>
<p>I already enjoy yerba mate as my principal source of caffeine</p>
<p>although I do drink coffee as well.</p>
<p>But if one were going to consume caffeine,</p>
<p>you might consider consuming that caffeine</p>
<p>in the form of yerba mate,</p>
<p>both for sake of up-regulating dopamine receptors</p>
<p>and getting more of a dopamine increase.</p>
<p>And of course, for the stimulant properties of caffeine,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re seeking.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>because yerba mate does appear to have</p>
<p>some sort of neuroprotective</p>
<p>and in particular dopamine neuron protective properties.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that caffeine is always beneficial.</p>
<p>And actually there&rsquo;s one instance related to dopamine</p>
<p>where caffeine can be particularly dangerous.</p>
<p>And this relates to MDMA, so-called ecstasy.</p>
<p>MDMA is under investigation in various clinical trials</p>
<p>for its potential to treat trauma and depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, of course, a drug that&rsquo;s used recreationally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still illegal, at least in the United States.</p>
<p>Whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic</p>
<p>has been very controversial.</p>
<p>Early on, it was thought that it is neurotoxic,</p>
<p>that it can destroy serotonergic neurons.</p>
<p>There were other papers that came out</p>
<p>which argued that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in particular because one of the early papers</p>
<p>published in Science Magazine</p>
<p>claiming that MDMA was neurotoxic,</p>
<p>that paper was retracted.</p>
<p>It turns out that that study</p>
<p>had mistakenly used methamphetamine instead.</p>
<p>And methamphetamine is known to be neurotoxic.</p>
<p>I think most of the data point to the idea</p>
<p>that MDMA might not be neurotoxic,</p>
<p>but in any case, caffeine has been shown</p>
<p>to increase the toxicity of MDMA receptors.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, how could that be?</p>
<p>Well, now you understand why that could be.</p>
<p>Caffeine increases the density and efficacy</p>
<p>of these dopamine receptors, the D2 and D3 receptors.</p>
<p>MDMA is a potent drug for increasing concentrations</p>
<p>of dopamine as well as serotonin and other neuromodulators.</p>
<p>And it appears that caffeine ingestion</p>
<p>by upregulating these receptors</p>
<p>can lead to more toxicity of MDMA.</p>
<p>So caffeine can be a beneficial substance in one context</p>
<p>and actually can be a detrimental,</p>
<p>if not dangerous substance in another context.</p>
<p>Two substances that greatly increase dopamine,</p>
<p>namely amphetamine and cocaine,</p>
<p>can cause long-term problems</p>
<p>with the dopaminergic pathways.</p>
<p>And this is largely based on a study</p>
<p>that was published some years ago, 2003,</p>
<p>but still holds a lot of merit.</p>
<p>This is a paper published in</p>
<p>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,</p>
<p>a very high tier stringent journal.</p>
<p>First author is Kolb, K-O-L-B.</p>
<p>And the title of the paper pretty much tells the story.</p>
<p>Amphetamine or cocaine limits the ability</p>
<p>of later experience to promote structural plasticity</p>
<p>in the neocortex and nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>Neocortex is the outer shell of the brain, more or less.</p>
<p>And the nucleus accumbens is part of</p>
<p>that mesolimbic dopamine pathway</p>
<p>for motivation, drive, and reinforcement.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity, of course,</p>
<p>is the brain&rsquo;s ability to change</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>And neuroplasticity is the basis of learning and memory</p>
<p>and essentially remodeling of our neural circuitry</p>
<p>in positive ways of all kinds.</p>
<p>And this study was really one of the first to show</p>
<p>that ingesting amphetamine and cocaine</p>
<p>because of the high peak in dopamine that it creates</p>
<p>and the low dopamine state,</p>
<p>the baseline drop that it creates afterwards,</p>
<p>limits plasticity and learning subsequent</p>
<p>to taking amphetamine and cocaine.</p>
<p>It was, at least in this study,</p>
<p>shown to be a long lasting effect.</p>
<p>I doubt it&rsquo;s a permanent effect,</p>
<p>but this should serve as a serious cautionary note</p>
<p>that amphetamine and cocaine not only can cause a drop</p>
<p>in baseline dopamine,</p>
<p>but can actually put the brain into a state</p>
<p>in which it cannot learn and modify itself to get better,</p>
<p>at least for some period of time.</p>
<p>In a previous episode on ADHD,</p>
<p>I talked about the widespread use of drugs</p>
<p>like Adderall, Ritalin, modafinil, and armodafinil,</p>
<p>all of which lead to very large increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>And for people with ADHD can really improve their symptoms.</p>
<p>But of course, there&rsquo;s a lot of non-prescription,</p>
<p>non-clinical use of those compounds as well.</p>
<p>And it stands to reason that the use of those substances</p>
<p>to increase dopamine could very well provide</p>
<p>the same sort of blockade of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that cocaine and amphetamine do.</p>
<p>Because when you look at the amount of dopamine increase</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s triggered by those compounds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really comparable.</p>
<p>So again, a cautionary note against spiking one&rsquo;s dopamine</p>
<p>too much on a regular basis,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s a valid clinical need for doing that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been focusing a lot for the last few minutes</p>
<p>on the kind of darker side of dopamine</p>
<p>and how getting big peaks in dopamine can be detrimental.</p>
<p>But I want to acknowledge the truth,</p>
<p>which is that dopamine feels great.</p>
<p>Being in pursuit and motivated and craving things</p>
<p>feels wonderful.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to demonize dopamine.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to do today is to illustrate</p>
<p>how dopamine works in your brain</p>
<p>so that you can continue to engage</p>
<p>in dopamine evoking activities.</p>
<p>And certainly there is a place for ingesting things</p>
<p>that can increase dopamine,</p>
<p>provided that they are safe for us</p>
<p>in the short and long-term.</p>
<p>There are activities that we can do</p>
<p>that will give us healthy, sustained increases in dopamine,</p>
<p>both the peaks when they happen and to maintain</p>
<p>or even increase our baseline levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>So how do we do that?</p>
<p>What are some of these activities?</p>
<p>Well, in recent years,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a trend toward more people</p>
<p>doing so-called cold exposure.</p>
<p>In part, this was popularized by Wim Hof,</p>
<p>the so-called Iceman.</p>
<p>Getting into cold showers, taking ice baths,</p>
<p>exposing oneself to cold water of various kinds</p>
<p>can, in fact, increase our levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>as well as the neuromodulator neuroarmpinephrine.</p>
<p>This is not a new phenomenon.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, a guy by the name of Vincent Prisnitz</p>
<p>was one of the first people to popularize</p>
<p>and formalize cold water therapies.</p>
<p>He was an advocate of cold water exposure</p>
<p>in order to boost the immune system</p>
<p>and increase feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>And actually this practice dates back long</p>
<p>before Vincent&rsquo;s popularized it.</p>
<p>And Wim Hof is the more recent iteration of this.</p>
<p>First of all, some of the safety parameters.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s establish those first.</p>
<p>Getting into very, very cold water,</p>
<p>30 degree Fahrenheit or even low 40 degree Fahrenheit</p>
<p>can put somebody into a state of cold water shock.</p>
<p>I mean, people can die doing that.</p>
<p>So obviously you want to approach this with some caution,</p>
<p>but for most people getting into 60 degree water</p>
<p>or 50 degree water,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re acclimated and comfortable with it,</p>
<p>40 degree water or 45 degree water</p>
<p>can have tremendously beneficial results</p>
<p>on your neuromodulator systems, including dopamine.</p>
<p>What temperature of water you can tolerate</p>
<p>will depend on how cold water adapted you are</p>
<p>and how familiar you are</p>
<p>with the experience of getting into cold water.</p>
<p>And when I say comfortable with,</p>
<p>I should mention there is never a case</p>
<p>in which getting into cold water</p>
<p>does not evoke a release of epinephrine.</p>
<p>So the quickening of the breath, the widening of the eyes,</p>
<p>the feeling as if you can&rsquo;t catch your breath</p>
<p>and even some physical pain at the level of the skin,</p>
<p>that happens almost every time</p>
<p>or every time that you get into cold water,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re cold water adapted.</p>
<p>What almost everybody knows and understands</p>
<p>is that that wall, as I like to refer to it, is coming.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the first experience</p>
<p>of getting into cold water.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real way around that.</p>
<p>Now, the study that I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>human physiological responses to immersion</p>
<p>into water of different temperatures,</p>
<p>really interesting study that was done</p>
<p>and published in the university, excuse me,</p>
<p>the European Journal of Applied Physiology.</p>
<p>I can provide a link to that study in the show caption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting study.</p>
<p>They looked at people getting exposed to water</p>
<p>that was warm, moderately cold, or very cold.</p>
<p>It was 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>or 14 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>You can just put those online and do the conversion</p>
<p>or you can do the conversion to Fahrenheit if you like.</p>
<p>But in any case, what they looked at</p>
<p>were the concentrations of things like epinephrine</p>
<p>and dopamine and so on.</p>
<p>And what they found was really interesting.</p>
<p>First of all, upon getting into cold water,</p>
<p>the changes in adrenaline and noradrenaline,</p>
<p>epinephrine and norepinephrine, were immediate and fast.</p>
<p>And these were huge increases.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the getting into the cold water</p>
<p>that everybody experiences,</p>
<p>these huge increases in adrenaline.</p>
<p>But then what was interesting is they observed</p>
<p>that dopamine levels started to rise somewhat slowly</p>
<p>and then continue to rise and reach levels</p>
<p>as high as 2.5 times above baseline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a remarkably high increase.</p>
<p>Remember, if we go back to our examples of chocolate,</p>
<p>sex, a doubling above baseline,</p>
<p>nicotine, two and a half times above baseline, cocaine,</p>
<p>the increase in dopamine from a cold water exposure</p>
<p>of this kind was comparable to what one sees from cocaine,</p>
<p>except, except in this case, it wasn&rsquo;t a rise and crash.</p>
<p>It was actually a sustained rise in dopamine</p>
<p>that took a very long time, up to three hours</p>
<p>to come back down to baseline, which is really remarkable.</p>
<p>And I think this explains some of the positive mental</p>
<p>and physical effects that people report subjectively</p>
<p>after doing cold water exposure.</p>
<p>One question that many of you are probably asking</p>
<p>is just how cold should the water be?</p>
<p>Well, you could mimic what was done in this study</p>
<p>and do 14 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>but for some people that won&rsquo;t be cold enough,</p>
<p>for some people that will be too cold.</p>
<p>They did look at the release of stress hormones</p>
<p>like cortisol, in addition to the release of things</p>
<p>like epinephrine and adrenaline.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that they noted that in all cases,</p>
<p>but especially at that coldest temperature,</p>
<p>there was an increase in cortisol,</p>
<p>but that it was transient,</p>
<p>that eventually people&rsquo;s cortisol, the stress hormone,</p>
<p>subsided a bit.</p>
<p>There are basically two different approaches</p>
<p>to remaining in the cold when it&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</p>
<p>One is to try and relax yourself,</p>
<p>to try and practice slow breathing,</p>
<p>to try and dilate your gaze.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this before on previous podcasts,</p>
<p>to go into panoramic vision,</p>
<p>to essentially try and calm yourself</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s not as stressful in the cold.</p>
<p>Other people, however, take the approach</p>
<p>of trying to ramp up their level</p>
<p>of internal autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>meaning to get really energized</p>
<p>and kind of lean into the friction of the cold.</p>
<p>And they find that easier.</p>
<p>Other people distract themselves.</p>
<p>They recite the alphabet or they do something,</p>
<p>anything to try and distract themselves from the discomfort.</p>
<p>To be totally honest,</p>
<p>it does not matter for sake of dopamine release</p>
<p>because the dopamine release is triggered</p>
<p>and then continues even after you get out of the cold water.</p>
<p>Now, in this study, it was long exposure to cold water.</p>
<p>It was an hour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long period of time.</p>
<p>And I do warn you against getting into cold water</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so cold that it will make your temperature drop</p>
<p>and make you hyperthermic for an hour.</p>
<p>That actually could be dangerous for a lot of people.</p>
<p>You might have a hard time reheating</p>
<p>and hypothermia is not a good thing.</p>
<p>They had people monitoring subjects in these studies</p>
<p>and paying attention to their core body temperature.</p>
<p>They were able to reheat them afterwards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well-established now that getting into cold water,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a shower,</p>
<p>an ice bath, circulating cold water, a stream, et cetera,</p>
<p>that can evoke the norepinephrine release immediately</p>
<p>and the long arc of that dopamine release.</p>
<p>Why would that be good?</p>
<p>Up until now, I&rsquo;ve basically said</p>
<p>getting increases in dopamine</p>
<p>are detrimental to your baseline.</p>
<p>Well, this does appear to raise the baseline of dopamine</p>
<p>for substantial periods of time.</p>
<p>And most people report feeling a heightened level</p>
<p>of calm and focus after getting out of cold water.</p>
<p>So cold water exposure turns out to be</p>
<p>a very potent stimulus for shifting the entire milieu,</p>
<p>the entire environment of our brain and body</p>
<p>and allowing many people to feel much, much better</p>
<p>for a substantial period of time</p>
<p>after getting out of the ice bath or cold water of any kind</p>
<p>than they did before.</p>
<p>Now you might ask how often to do this.</p>
<p>Some people do this every day.</p>
<p>It can be very stimulating.</p>
<p>So typically doing it early in the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily recommend doing it right before sleep,</p>
<p>but some people do it in the afternoon</p>
<p>and some people will indeed do that seven days a week,</p>
<p>other people, three days a week,</p>
<p>other people every once in a while.</p>
<p>What I can say is once you become cold water adapted,</p>
<p>once it no longer has the same impact of novelty</p>
<p>and feeling a bit like a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say a shock to your system</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to go into cold water shock,</p>
<p>but once it is comfortable for you,</p>
<p>then it will no longer evoke this release.</p>
<p>There really does seem to be something in the pathway</p>
<p>from cold water exposure</p>
<p>through the norepinephrine pathway</p>
<p>and into the mesolamic brainstem</p>
<p>that causes this release in dopamine.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it&rsquo;s a basically zero cost.</p>
<p>I mean, you need access to water of some sort,</p>
<p>cold water, shower, et cetera,</p>
<p>but basically zero cost way</p>
<p>of triggering a long lasting increase in dopamine</p>
<p>without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever.</p>
<p>Please again, approach it with safety and caution in mind,</p>
<p>but it is a very potent stimulus.</p>
<p>Again, 250% of a rise in baseline,</p>
<p>two and a half times rise in baseline</p>
<p>rivals that of cocaine, which is really remarkable.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about the positive aspects</p>
<p>of rewards for our behavior</p>
<p>and the negative aspects of rewards for our behavior.</p>
<p>And from that, I will suggest a protocol</p>
<p>by which you can achieve a better relationship</p>
<p>to your activities and to your dopamine system.</p>
<p>In fact, it will help tune up your dopamine system</p>
<p>for discipline, hard work, and motivation.</p>
<p>Hard work is hard.</p>
<p>Generally, most people don&rsquo;t like working hard.</p>
<p>Some people do, but most people work hard</p>
<p>in order to achieve some end goal.</p>
<p>End goals are terrific and rewards are terrific,</p>
<p>whether or not they are monetary, social, or any kind.</p>
<p>However, because of the way that dopamine relates</p>
<p>to our perception of time,</p>
<p>working hard at something for sake of a reward</p>
<p>that comes afterward can make the hard work</p>
<p>much more challenging and make us much less likely</p>
<p>to lean into hard work in the future.</p>
<p>Let me give you a couple examples</p>
<p>by way of data and experiments.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a classic experiment done actually at Stanford</p>
<p>many years ago, in which children in nursery school</p>
<p>and kindergarten drew pictures.</p>
<p>And they drew pictures because they liked to draw.</p>
<p>The researchers took kids that liked to draw</p>
<p>and they started giving them a reward for drawing.</p>
<p>The reward generally was a gold star</p>
<p>or something that a young child would find rewarding.</p>
<p>Then they stopped giving them the gold star.</p>
<p>And what they found is the children had a much lower tendency</p>
<p>to draw on their own.</p>
<p>No reward.</p>
<p>Now, remember this was an activity</p>
<p>that prior to receiving a reward,</p>
<p>the children intrinsically enjoyed and selected to do.</p>
<p>No one was telling them to draw.</p>
<p>What this relates to is so-called intrinsic</p>
<p>versus extrinsic reinforcement.</p>
<p>When we receive rewards,</p>
<p>even if we give ourselves rewards for something,</p>
<p>we tend to associate less pleasure</p>
<p>with the actual activity itself that evoked the reward.</p>
<p>Now that might seem counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just the way</p>
<p>that these dopaminergic circuits work.</p>
<p>And now understanding these peaks and baselines in dopamine,</p>
<p>which I won&rsquo;t review again, this should make sense.</p>
<p>If you get a peak in dopamine from a reward,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to lower your baseline.</p>
<p>And the cognitive interpretation</p>
<p>is that you didn&rsquo;t really do the activity</p>
<p>because you enjoyed the activity.</p>
<p>You did it for the reward.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn&rsquo;t mean all rewards of all kinds are bad,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also important to understand</p>
<p>that dopamine controls our perception of time.</p>
<p>When and how much dopamine we experience</p>
<p>is the way that we carve up</p>
<p>what we call our experience of time.</p>
<p>When we engage in an activity,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say school or hard work of any kind or exercise,</p>
<p>because of the reward we are going to give ourselves</p>
<p>or receive at the end, the trophy, the Sunday, the meal,</p>
<p>whatever it happens to be,</p>
<p>we actually are extending the time bin</p>
<p>over which we are analyzing or perceiving that experience.</p>
<p>And because the reward comes at the end,</p>
<p>we start to dissociate the neural circuits</p>
<p>for dopamine and reward</p>
<p>that would have normally been active during the activity.</p>
<p>And because it all arrives at the end,</p>
<p>over time, we have the experience</p>
<p>of less and less pleasure from that particular activity</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Now, this is the antithesis of growth mindset.</p>
<p>My colleague at Stanford, Carol Dweck,</p>
<p>as many of you know,</p>
<p>has come up with this incredible theory and principle,</p>
<p>and it actually goes beyond theory and principle,</p>
<p>called growth mindset,</p>
<p>which is this striving to be better,</p>
<p>to be in this mindset of I&rsquo;m not there yet,</p>
<p>but striving itself is the end goal.</p>
<p>And that of course delivers you to tremendous performance</p>
<p>has been observed over and over and over again,</p>
<p>that people that have growth mindset,</p>
<p>kids that have growth mindset,</p>
<p>end up performing very well</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re focused on the effort itself.</p>
<p>And all of us can cultivate growth mindset.</p>
<p>The neural mechanism of cultivating growth mindset</p>
<p>involves learning to access the rewards</p>
<p>from effort and doing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard to do</p>
<p>because you have to engage this prefrontal component</p>
<p>of the mesolimbic circuit.</p>
<p>You have to tell yourself,</p>
<p>okay, this effort is great.</p>
<p>This effort is pleasurable,</p>
<p>even though you might actually be in a state of physical</p>
<p>pain from the exercise,</p>
<p>or I can recall this from college,</p>
<p>just feeling like I wanted to get up from my desk,</p>
<p>but forcing myself to study,</p>
<p>forcing myself and forcing myself.</p>
<p>What you find over time</p>
<p>is that you can start to associate a dopamine release.</p>
<p>You can evoke dopamine release from the friction</p>
<p>and the challenge that you happen to be in.</p>
<p>You completely eliminate the ability to generate</p>
<p>those circuits and the rewarding process</p>
<p>of being able to reward friction while in effort,</p>
<p>if you are focused only on the goal that comes at the end,</p>
<p>because of the way that dopamine marks time.</p>
<p>So if you say, oh, I&rsquo;m going to do this very hard thing,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to push and push and push and push</p>
<p>for that end goal that comes later,</p>
<p>not only do you enjoy the process</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re doing less,</p>
<p>you actually make it more painful</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re engaging in it.</p>
<p>You make yourself less efficient at it,</p>
<p>because if you were able to access dopamine while in effort,</p>
<p>dopamine has all these incredible properties</p>
<p>of increasing the amount of energy in our body</p>
<p>and in our mind, our ability to focus</p>
<p>by way of dopamine&rsquo;s conversion into epinephrine,</p>
<p>but also you&rsquo;re undermining your ability</p>
<p>to lean back into that activity the next time.</p>
<p>The next time you need twice as much coffee</p>
<p>and three times as much loud music</p>
<p>and four times as much energy drink</p>
<p>and the social connection just to get out the door</p>
<p>in order to do the run or to study.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s more beneficial, in fact,</p>
<p>can serve as a tremendous amplifier on all endeavors</p>
<p>that you engage in, especially hard endeavors,</p>
<p>is to A, not start layering in other sources of dopamine</p>
<p>in order to get to the starting line,</p>
<p>not layering in other sources of dopamine</p>
<p>in order to be able to continue,</p>
<p>but rather to subjectively start to attach</p>
<p>the feeling of friction and effort</p>
<p>to an internally generated reward system.</p>
<p>And this is not meant to be vague.</p>
<p>This is a system that exists in your mind</p>
<p>that exists in the minds of humans</p>
<p>for hundreds of thousands of years,</p>
<p>by which you&rsquo;re not just pursuing the things</p>
<p>that are innately pleasurable, food, sex, warmth,</p>
<p>water when you&rsquo;re thirsty,</p>
<p>but the beauty of this mesolimbic reward pathway</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier</p>
<p>is that it includes the forebrain.</p>
<p>So you can tell yourself the effort part is the good part.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>I know this doesn&rsquo;t feel good, but I&rsquo;m focused on this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start to access the reward.</p>
<p>You will find the rewards,</p>
<p>meaning the dopamine release inside of effort</p>
<p>if you repeat this over and over again.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s beautiful about it</p>
<p>is that it starts to become reflexive</p>
<p>for all types of effort.</p>
<p>When we focus only on the trophy, only on the grade,</p>
<p>only on the win as the reward,</p>
<p>you undermine that entire process.</p>
<p>So how do you do this?</p>
<p>You do this in those moments of the most intense friction,</p>
<p>you tell yourself, this is very painful.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s painful,</p>
<p>it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later,</p>
<p>meaning it will increase my baseline in dopamine.</p>
<p>But you also have to tell yourself that in that moment,</p>
<p>you are doing it by choice</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing it because you love it.</p>
<p>And I know that sounds like lying to yourself.</p>
<p>And in some ways it is lying to yourself,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s lying to yourself in the context of a truth,</p>
<p>which is that you want it to feel better.</p>
<p>You want it to feel even pleasurable.</p>
<p>Now, this is very far and away different</p>
<p>from thinking about the reward that comes at the end,</p>
<p>the hot fudge sundae after you cross the finish line.</p>
<p>And you can replace hot fudge sundae</p>
<p>with whatever reward happens to be appealing to you.</p>
<p>We revere people who are capable</p>
<p>of doing what I&rsquo;m describing.</p>
<p>David Goggins comes to mind as a really good example.</p>
<p>Many of you are probably familiar with David Goggins,</p>
<p>former Navy SEAL,</p>
<p>who essentially has made a post-military career</p>
<p>out of explaining and sharing his process</p>
<p>of turning the effort into the reward.</p>
<p>There are many other examples of this too, of course.</p>
<p>Throughout evolutionary history,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no question that we revered people</p>
<p>who were willing to go out and forage and hunt</p>
<p>and gather and caretake in ways</p>
<p>that other members of our species probably found exhausting</p>
<p>and probably would have preferred to just put their feet up</p>
<p>or soak them in a cool stream</p>
<p>rather than continue to forage.</p>
<p>The ability to access this pleasure from effort aspect</p>
<p>of our dopaminergic circuitry is without question</p>
<p>the most powerful aspect of dopamine</p>
<p>and our biology of dopamine.</p>
<p>And the beautiful thing is it&rsquo;s accessible to all of us.</p>
<p>But just to highlight the things that can interfere with</p>
<p>and prevent you from getting dopamine release</p>
<p>from effort itself,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t spike dopamine after engaging in effort.</p>
<p>Learn to spike your dopamine from effort itself.</p>
<p>One straightforward example of learning to attach dopamine</p>
<p>to effort and strain as opposed to a process or a reward</p>
<p>that naturally evokes dopamine release</p>
<p>is so-called intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>I know this is very popular nowadays.</p>
<p>Some people like to do intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>some people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Some people have a 12-hour feeding window every 24 hours.</p>
<p>Some people do long fasts of two to three days even.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t monitor a feeding window</p>
<p>with a lot of precision.</p>
<p>I tend to skip one meal a day, either breakfast or lunch,</p>
<p>and then I eat the other two meals of the day,</p>
<p>depending on which meal I skip.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s either breakfast, lunch,</p>
<p>and maybe a little something in the evening,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll skip breakfast and do lunch and dinner and so on.</p>
<p>Many people are now eating this way in part</p>
<p>because many people find it easier to not eat at all</p>
<p>than to eat a smaller portion of some food.</p>
<p>And that has everything to do with the dopamine reward</p>
<p>evoking properties of food.</p>
<p>When we ingest food or when we are about to ingest food,</p>
<p>our dopamine levels go up.</p>
<p>And typically when we ingest food,</p>
<p>if it evokes some dopamine release,</p>
<p>then we tend to want even more food.</p>
<p>Remember, dopamine&rsquo;s main role</p>
<p>is one of motivation and seeking.</p>
<p>And what dopamine always wants more of is more dopamine,</p>
<p>more activity or thing that evokes more dopamine release.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s just look at fasting</p>
<p>from the perspective of dopamine schedules</p>
<p>and dopamine release and peaks and baselines.</p>
<p>Typically when we eat, we get dopamine release,</p>
<p>especially when we eat after being very hungry.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever gone camping or you&rsquo;re very, very hungry,</p>
<p>the food tastes that much better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually because of the way</p>
<p>that deprivation states increase</p>
<p>the way that dopaminergic circuits work.</p>
<p>Our perception of dopamine is heightened</p>
<p>when the receptors for dopamine</p>
<p>have not seen much dopamine lately.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t bound much dopamine.</p>
<p>So when you fast, fast, fast, fast, fast,</p>
<p>and then you finally eat, it evokes more dopamine release.</p>
<p>So this is the big reward that comes at the end,</p>
<p>even bigger because you deprived yourself.</p>
<p>This is true for all rewarding behaviors</p>
<p>and activities, by the way.</p>
<p>The longer you restrict yourself from that activity,</p>
<p>the greater the dopamine experience</p>
<p>when the dopamine is finally released</p>
<p>because of an upregulation of the receptors for dopamine.</p>
<p>But I just spent five minutes or more telling you</p>
<p>that you should avoid too much reward at the end</p>
<p>and you should actually focus on the dopamine</p>
<p>that you can consciously evoke</p>
<p>from the deprivation strain and effort.</p>
<p>And in fact, this is what happens for many people</p>
<p>that start doing fasting and take a liking to it.</p>
<p>Many people say that their state of mind</p>
<p>when they fast is clearer,</p>
<p>that they actually start to enjoy the period of fasting.</p>
<p>In fact, some people start pushing out their eating window</p>
<p>or skipping entire days of eating more and more</p>
<p>in order to get deeper into that state of mind</p>
<p>where surely it&rsquo;s not just dopamine,</p>
<p>but dopamine is released.</p>
<p>They will track their clock.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve been fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera.</p>
<p>They are starting to attach dopamine release</p>
<p>or create dopamine release from the deprivation,</p>
<p>not from the food reward itself.</p>
<p>And this, I think, makes it an interesting practice</p>
<p>and one that certainly has been practiced for centuries</p>
<p>in different cultures and different religions</p>
<p>of deliberately restricting food,</p>
<p>not just to increase the rewarding properties of food itself</p>
<p>but also to increase the rewarding properties of deprivation.</p>
<p>And I should emphasize that a lot of the subjective aspects</p>
<p>of the knowledge of the benefits of fasting</p>
<p>serve as reinforcing dopamine amplifying aspects to fasting,</p>
<p>meaning if somebody does intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and they are deep into their fast</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re telling themselves,</p>
<p>oh, my blood lipid profiles are probably improving</p>
<p>and my glucose management is probably improving,</p>
<p>my insulin sensitivity is going up</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to live longer.</p>
<p>All these things that have some basis from animal studies</p>
<p>and some basis or not from human studies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all kind of still an emerging literature,</p>
<p>but it does seem to be pointing in that direction</p>
<p>that fasting can encourage things like autophagy,</p>
<p>the engulfment of dead cells and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Well, as people tell themselves these things,</p>
<p>they are enhancing the rewarding properties</p>
<p>of the behavior of fasting.</p>
<p>And so this is a salient example</p>
<p>of where knowledge of knowledge</p>
<p>can actually help us change these deep primitive circuits</p>
<p>related to dopamine.</p>
<p>And this illustrates how the forebrain,</p>
<p>which carries knowledge and carries interpretation</p>
<p>and rational thought,</p>
<p>can be used to shape the very circuits</p>
<p>that are involved in generating reward</p>
<p>for what would otherwise just be kind of primitive behaviors,</p>
<p>hardwired behaviors.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the beauty of these dopamine circuits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of dopamine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just attached to the more primitive behaviors</p>
<p>of food, sex, heat, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also attached to the things that we decide</p>
<p>are good for us and are important for us.</p>
<p>So telling yourself that exercise or fasting or studying</p>
<p>or listening better,</p>
<p>or any kind of behavior is good for you</p>
<p>will actually reinforce the extent to which it is good</p>
<p>for you at a chemical level.</p>
<p>And a somewhat eerie example of what I just mentioned</p>
<p>was a study that was published last year</p>
<p>in the journal Neuron, cell press journal,</p>
<p>excellent journal that showed that hearing something</p>
<p>that reinforces one&rsquo;s prior beliefs</p>
<p>actually can evoke dopamine release.</p>
<p>So the dopamine pathway is so vulnerable</p>
<p>to subjective interpretation</p>
<p>that it actually makes it such that when we see something</p>
<p>or hear something that validates a belief</p>
<p>that we already have,</p>
<p>that itself can increase dopamine release.</p>
<p>Along the lines of how dopamine and dopamine schedules</p>
<p>and our perception of things can shape the way</p>
<p>that we experience things as pleasureful or not,</p>
<p>there are beautiful studies,</p>
<p>mainly looking at sugar appetite</p>
<p>and our sense of pleasure from sweet things,</p>
<p>but also for savory foods, et cetera.</p>
<p>And essentially the results that come out of this</p>
<p>are the following.</p>
<p>If you ingest something that you like,</p>
<p>it tastes good to you,</p>
<p>but then you ingest something that&rsquo;s even sweeter</p>
<p>or even more savory.</p>
<p>And then you go back to the food that you ate previously.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t like it as much.</p>
<p>And that might seem like a duh, obviously,</p>
<p>but that shift in perception can be blocked</p>
<p>by blocking the shift in dopamine.</p>
<p>And so this really speaks to these peaks and valleys</p>
<p>in dopamine that I mentioned before</p>
<p>and how your experience of anything</p>
<p>is going to depend on your prior experience</p>
<p>of other things that evoke dopamine.</p>
<p>Big dopamine release makes it more challenging</p>
<p>to experience more big dopamine release.</p>
<p>So dopamine is one of those things</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want too high or too low for too long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about staying in that dynamic range</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to be different for everybody.</p>
<p>So for the very savory foods that are now everywhere,</p>
<p>those highly savory foods,</p>
<p>I think they call them highly palatable foods,</p>
<p>are making more bland foods, whole foods,</p>
<p>meaning foods that aren&rsquo;t processed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s making those taste less good, at least for a while.</p>
<p>And all it takes is a short period of time,</p>
<p>even just days, two days or so,</p>
<p>of not consuming any highly palatable foods.</p>
<p>And suddenly broccoli with just a little bit of seasoning</p>
<p>tastes delicious to you, all right?</p>
<p>So again, this just speaks to the fact</p>
<p>that dopamine is this universal currency.</p>
<p>It establishes value based on not just</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re experiencing in the moment,</p>
<p>but what you experienced in the days and minutes before.</p>
<p>Now that you understand how your previous level of dopamine</p>
<p>relates to your current level of dopamine</p>
<p>and how your current level of dopamine</p>
<p>will influence your future level of dopamine,</p>
<p>it should become obvious why things like pornography,</p>
<p>not just the accessibility of pornography,</p>
<p>but the intensity of pornography</p>
<p>can negatively shape real world</p>
<p>romantic and sexual interactions.</p>
<p>This is a serious concern.</p>
<p>The discussion is happening now.</p>
<p>The underlying neurobiological mechanisms</p>
<p>you now understand.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t to pass judgment on whether or not</p>
<p>people like or don&rsquo;t like pornography.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an ethical discussion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a moral discussion that has to be decided</p>
<p>for each individual by virtue of age, et cetera.</p>
<p>But again, any activity that evokes a lot of dopamine</p>
<p>release will make it harder to achieve the same level</p>
<p>and certainly the greater level of dopamine</p>
<p>through a subsequent interaction.</p>
<p>So yes, indeed, many people are addicted to pornography.</p>
<p>And yes, indeed, many people who regularly</p>
<p>indulge in pornography experience challenges</p>
<p>in real world romantic interactions.</p>
<p>You now understand the mechanisms</p>
<p>behind what I&rsquo;m telling you.</p>
<p>Now there are circumstances in which increasing levels</p>
<p>of dopamine is desirable and advantageous</p>
<p>and clinically helpful.</p>
<p>Good example of this would be the drug Welbutrin,</p>
<p>also called buprenorphine,</p>
<p>which increases dopamine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Welbutrin buprenorphine was developed</p>
<p>as an alternative treatment for depression</p>
<p>because some people who take the so-called SSRI,</p>
<p>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,</p>
<p>which as the name suggests, increase serotonin,</p>
<p>suffer from serotonin related side effects.</p>
<p>Things like decreased appetite, decreased libido,</p>
<p>or sometimes increased appetite</p>
<p>or other side effects that they don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>And Welbutrin seems to avoid the sexual side effects.</p>
<p>It can blunt appetite and these sorts of things</p>
<p>because of the increase in norepinephrine</p>
<p>and dopamine increases levels of motivation and craving,</p>
<p>but also can create a state of elevated alertness</p>
<p>that can sometimes get in the way of healthy eating</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So one has to work with their clinician,</p>
<p>as a psychiatrist, it is a prescription drug,</p>
<p>in order to find the dosage of Welbutrin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s correct for them.</p>
<p>In addition, things like Welbutrin buprenorphine</p>
<p>can increase anxiety because of the way that dopamine</p>
<p>and norepinephrine are stimulating</p>
<p>and tend to place people into heightened levels</p>
<p>of alertness.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many people have gained terrific relief</p>
<p>from depression from Welbutrin buprenorphine</p>
<p>and many of those same people had serious trouble</p>
<p>with some of the SSRI.</p>
<p>So it does seem to be a very useful drug in certain contexts</p>
<p>both for depression and for the treatment of smoking,</p>
<p>for people desiring to quit smoking.</p>
<p>And of course, there are a lot of people out there</p>
<p>who are seeking to increase their baseline levels</p>
<p>of dopamine without taking any prescription</p>
<p>pharmaceutical compounds.</p>
<p>And nowadays there exists a lot of supplements to do that.</p>
<p>The two most common ones that are directly</p>
<p>within the dopamine pathway are mucunipurines,</p>
<p>which is actually a velvety bean whose contents are L-DOPA.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the content of this bean</p>
<p>is the precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>So mucunipurines is sold over the counter,</p>
<p>at least in the United States.</p>
<p>And it literally is the precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>Meaning if you take it,</p>
<p>you will experience very large increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>Those increases are transient and very, very intense.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you look at the constellation of effects</p>
<p>of mucunipurines, what you find is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty striking and they look a lot like,</p>
<p>if not identical to L-DOPA.</p>
<p>The most obvious of those is in the context</p>
<p>of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>There are at least five studies that have shown</p>
<p>that mucunipurines can reduce the symptoms</p>
<p>of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease much in the same way</p>
<p>that L-DOPA can reduce the symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>And that shouldn&rsquo;t come as any surprise</p>
<p>given what I just told you,</p>
<p>that mucunipurines is essentially L-DOPA.</p>
<p>It also can reduce a particular hormone called prolactin.</p>
<p>Dopamine and prolactin tend to be</p>
<p>in somewhat push-pull fashion.</p>
<p>When dopamine is up, prolactin is down and vice versa.</p>
<p>Prolactin is involved in milk let down in women.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in setting the refractory period</p>
<p>for sex after ejaculation in males.</p>
<p>The reason mating can occur and then not occur</p>
<p>after ejaculation is because of an increase in prolactin.</p>
<p>Mucunipurines is often used to blunt prolactin.</p>
<p>And there are actually a couple of studies</p>
<p>showing that it can indeed do that.</p>
<p>Mucunipurines has a number of other effects</p>
<p>that lie in the sex and reproduction pathway</p>
<p>that are worth noting.</p>
<p>Sperm concentration, sperm quality</p>
<p>is actually greatly increased by mucunipurines.</p>
<p>These are kind of curious effects</p>
<p>until you understand a little bit more</p>
<p>about the biology of dopamine,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll mention in a moment.</p>
<p>But there are several studies, four in fact,</p>
<p>that describe how mucunipurines can increase sperm count,</p>
<p>sperm quality and sperm motility.</p>
<p>So for those of you seeking to conceive children,</p>
<p>mucunipurines might be an interesting choice</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in exploring</p>
<p>non-prescription compounds.</p>
<p>However, I should mention that anytime you consume</p>
<p>a substance that increases dopamine by mimicking dopamine</p>
<p>or acting as a direct precursor to dopamine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost inevitably a crash</p>
<p>or a reduction in the baseline in dopamine</p>
<p>that we referred to previously.</p>
<p>So many people who take mucunipurines feel really elevated,</p>
<p>really motivated, really alert,</p>
<p>all the sorts of things that one would expect</p>
<p>from a dopaminergic drug, which mucunipurines is,</p>
<p>and then they feel a low or a reduction in drive</p>
<p>and excitement and enthusiasm after the drug wears off,</p>
<p>just like they would with any other</p>
<p>dopamine increasing compound.</p>
<p>For that reason, many people have turned</p>
<p>to the use of L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>L-tyrosine is an amino acid precursor to L-DOPA,</p>
<p>so it lies further up the dopamine synthesis pathway.</p>
<p>And nowadays it&rsquo;s very common because L-tyrosine</p>
<p>is sold over the counter in the United States,</p>
<p>that people will take L-tyrosine as a way</p>
<p>to get more energized, alert, and focused.</p>
<p>And indeed there are data</p>
<p>that L-tyrosine will accomplish that.</p>
<p>L-tyrosine is typically taken in capsule form</p>
<p>or powder form, anywhere from 500 to 750</p>
<p>to 1,000 milligrams.</p>
<p>It is a potent stimulus for increasing dopamine.</p>
<p>And the timescale for increasing dopamine</p>
<p>is about 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion,</p>
<p>dopamine levels start to peak.</p>
<p>The classic study that really nailed down</p>
<p>the fact that tyrosine has this effect</p>
<p>was published way back in 1983,</p>
<p>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,</p>
<p>that directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation</p>
<p>with tryptophan ingestion on plasma dopamine and serotonin,</p>
<p>tryptophan being a precursor to serotonin.</p>
<p>And indeed what they found is that ingestion of L-tyrosine</p>
<p>can increase the amount of dopamine circulating in the blood</p>
<p>and in the brain too, of course.</p>
<p>The tyrosine ingestion induced dopamine increases</p>
<p>within 45 minutes and they were short-lasting.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes, the effect had dissipated,</p>
<p>meaning the levels of dopamine had dropped down to baseline</p>
<p>and even though they didn&rsquo;t look at levels of baseline</p>
<p>dopamine past that time point,</p>
<p>the expectation based on everything we know</p>
<p>about dopamine biology is that it would then</p>
<p>drop below baseline due to the depletion</p>
<p>of the readily reservable pool of dopamine vesicles</p>
<p>that we talked about way back</p>
<p>at the beginning of this episode.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this study</p>
<p>is it does show specificity of effect</p>
<p>because ingestion of tryptophan did not increase dopamine.</p>
<p>Instead, it increased serotonin.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s really specificity of these pathways</p>
<p>that rule out any placebo type effects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that anybody, everybody,</p>
<p>increase their dopamine levels</p>
<p>by way of tyrosine and macunipurines.</p>
<p>For those of you that are seeking to increase</p>
<p>your dopamine levels without prescription drugs,</p>
<p>those are the most direct route to that.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have a preexisting dopaminergic condition,</p>
<p>so schizophrenia or psychosis of any kind,</p>
<p>bipolar, anxiety, things like macunipurines</p>
<p>and l-tyrosine will not be good for you.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, you should just understand</p>
<p>and expect that it&rsquo;s going to lead</p>
<p>to an increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll certainly feel an elevated state.</p>
<p>For some of you, that might be agitating.</p>
<p>For some of you, that might be really pleasurable.</p>
<p>And then you will feel a crash afterwards.</p>
<p>How deep is that crash will really depend on your biology</p>
<p>and where your dopamine baseline began.</p>
<p>So I personally am not a fan of using things</p>
<p>like macunipurines at all for myself,</p>
<p>for the reasons I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>just too intense and too much of a crash.</p>
<p>I do use l-tyrosine from time to time</p>
<p>for enhancing focus and motivation,</p>
<p>but I want to emphasize from time to time.</p>
<p>So I might use it once a week, occasionally twice a week,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never been one to take l-tyrosine regularly</p>
<p>in order to focus or train or do any kind of mental work.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to rely on any exogenous substance</p>
<p>in order to get my dopamine circuits activated.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to experience the drop in dopamine</p>
<p>that inevitably occurs some period of time afterwards.</p>
<p>I should also mention things that can reduce your levels</p>
<p>of baseline dopamine.</p>
<p>One that is rarely discussed is melatonin.</p>
<p>I have talked before on this podcast about melatonin,</p>
<p>why I am not a fan of using melatonin</p>
<p>in order to enhance sleep.</p>
<p>It can help one get to sleep, but not stay asleep.</p>
<p>Dr. Matt Walker, sleep expert</p>
<p>from University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t want to put words in his mouth,</p>
<p>but in our discussion about melatonin on this podcast,</p>
<p>when Matt was a guest and in his book and on other podcasts,</p>
<p>Matt has generally stated that the use of melatonin,</p>
<p>except for treatment of jet lag,</p>
<p>is generally not a good idea.</p>
<p>And I agree.</p>
<p>I think that melatonin is not often thought about</p>
<p>as impacting the dopamine pathway,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s at least one study published in 2001.</p>
<p>First author is Nishiyama, just as it sounds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spelled just as it sounds.</p>
<p>Acute effects of melatonin administration</p>
<p>on cardiovascular autonomic regulation in healthy men.</p>
<p>So the study wasn&rsquo;t specifically about dopamine,</p>
<p>but they looked at norepinephrine and dopamine levels,</p>
<p>and they found a significant,</p>
<p>statistically significant decrease in dopamine</p>
<p>60 minutes after melatonin administration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about how viewing bright lights</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>has been shown in studies by Dr. Samar Hattar,</p>
<p>David Burson, excellent circadian scientists,</p>
<p>to reduce levels of dopamine for several days</p>
<p>after that light exposure.</p>
<p>So dim the lights at night.</p>
<p>If you can, avoid exogenous melatonin,</p>
<p>meaning if you don&rsquo;t have to take melatonin</p>
<p>and you can find a better alternative,</p>
<p>that would be a good idea</p>
<p>if you want to maintain healthy levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>Now, there is one compound that you are all familiar with,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve probably actually taken without realizing it,</p>
<p>that increases dopamine,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something called PEA for phenyl ethylamine,</p>
<p>technically beta phenyl ethylamine.</p>
<p>And PEA is found in various foods.</p>
<p>Chocolate just happens to be one enriched in PEA,</p>
<p>and can increase synaptic levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>I personally take PEA from time to time</p>
<p>as a focus and work aid</p>
<p>in order to do intense bouts of work.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t do that too often.</p>
<p>This might be once a week or once every two weeks.</p>
<p>I might use it for training, but typically I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually for mental work.</p>
<p>And I will take 500 milligrams of PEA,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that I personally do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s right for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s within my margins of safety for my health.</p>
<p>Again, you have to check with your doctor</p>
<p>and decide what&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>It leads to a sharp,</p>
<p>but very transient increase in dopamine</p>
<p>that lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>And at least in my system,</p>
<p>I found to be much more regulated and kind of even</p>
<p>than something like L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>and certainly much more regulated and even</p>
<p>and lower dopamine release</p>
<p>than something like mucunipurines.</p>
<p>One of the lesser talked about compounds that&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s gaining popularity for increasing dopamine.</p>
<p>And as a so-called nootropic</p>
<p>is something called Hooperzine A.</p>
<p>Hooperzine A is a compound sold over the counter,</p>
<p>at least in the United States,</p>
<p>that can increase acetylcholine transmission,</p>
<p>a different neuromodulator entirely.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is that Hooperzine A somehow</p>
<p>by way of interactions between the cholinergic system</p>
<p>and the dopaminergic system leads to increases in dopamine</p>
<p>in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.</p>
<p>Hippocampus, of course, being an area of the brain</p>
<p>associated with learning and memory</p>
<p>and prefrontal cortex being associated</p>
<p>with the mesolimbic pathway, decision-making,</p>
<p>focus, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so I think the reason why we&rsquo;re seeing an increase</p>
<p>in popularity of companies,</p>
<p>including Hooperzine A and nootropic compounds</p>
<p>is both for the cholinergic stimulating properties,</p>
<p>but also for stimulating dopamine release.</p>
<p>I personally have never tried Hooperzine A.</p>
<p>You can go to examine.com or put Hooperzine A into PubMed</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to search around</p>
<p>and see some of the science behind it.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not recommending anyone take these things.</p>
<p>In fact, I recommend against anyone just diving in</p>
<p>and starting to consume things without gaining knowledge</p>
<p>about how they function</p>
<p>and whether or not they&rsquo;re right for you.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, I think in the years to come,</p>
<p>we are going to see a lot more of L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>PEA, phenolethylamine, and Hooperzine</p>
<p>as a way of tapping into the dopaminergic</p>
<p>and cholinergic circuits,</p>
<p>certainly along with things like alpha-GPC</p>
<p>as non-prescription, short-lived,</p>
<p>somewhat milder alternatives to things</p>
<p>that really spike dopamine,</p>
<p>things like Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil,</p>
<p>R-modafinil, and similar.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t help but share with you one more result.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not related to pharmacology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to behaviors and social interactions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the very interesting,</p>
<p>and I would say important finding</p>
<p>that was made a few years ago by my colleague, Rob Malenka,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in our department of psychiatry at Stanford,</p>
<p>showing that oxytocin and social connection</p>
<p>is actually directly stimulating the dopamine pathway.</p>
<p>I think for many years, all of us, including me,</p>
<p>would hear and thought that oxytocin</p>
<p>was in the serotonergic pathway,</p>
<p>that it was about pair bonding,</p>
<p>and it was about some of these neuromodulators</p>
<p>that were more associated with things</p>
<p>related to feeling good with what we have</p>
<p>in the present moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s typically what we think of</p>
<p>when we think of the opioid system</p>
<p>or the serotonergic system.</p>
<p>The dopamine system is really about seeking and reward.</p>
<p>But in a paper published in 2017 in the journal Science,</p>
<p>excellent journal,</p>
<p>paper&rsquo;s titled Gating of Social Reward by Oxytocin</p>
<p>in the Ventral Tegmental Area.</p>
<p>You now know what the ventral tegmental area,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that area of the mesolimbic pathway.</p>
<p>What this paper essentially showed</p>
<p>is that oxytocin, social connection,</p>
<p>and pair bonding itself triggers dopamine release.</p>
<p>And as everyone read this result,</p>
<p>we all realized, ah, this makes total sense,</p>
<p>that for the evolution of our species,</p>
<p>indeed, for any species</p>
<p>where social connections are important,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also important to go seek social connections.</p>
<p>And so while it&rsquo;s fun to think about pharmacology</p>
<p>and underlying neural circuitry and cold water baths,</p>
<p>and all these different things related to dopamine schedules</p>
<p>and reward mechanisms and attaching reward to effort</p>
<p>and all the various things that we&rsquo;ve talked about today</p>
<p>in terms of science and tools and protocols,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t include description of this result</p>
<p>and just emphasize that social connections,</p>
<p>close social connections in particular,</p>
<p>that evoke oxytocin release.</p>
<p>So those are romantic type,</p>
<p>those are parent-child type,</p>
<p>those are friendship related,</p>
<p>and those can even be just friends at a distance related.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually require skin contact</p>
<p>to get oxytocin release,</p>
<p>but oxytocin release is central</p>
<p>to stimulating the dopamine pathways.</p>
<p>So the take-home message there is quite simple,</p>
<p>engage in, pursue quality, healthy social interactions.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of material today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really tried hard to focus on things</p>
<p>that lie directly within the dopamine pathway</p>
<p>and circuitries,</p>
<p>as well as things that directly stimulate</p>
<p>those pathways and circuitries.</p>
<p>What I haven&rsquo;t talked about</p>
<p>are all the things that indirectly serve</p>
<p>the dopamine pathways.</p>
<p>And out there on the internet,</p>
<p>and indeed in the scientific literature,</p>
<p>you will find, for instance,</p>
<p>that things like maca root can increase dopamine,</p>
<p>things like the gut microbiome can influence dopamine,</p>
<p>and indeed they can,</p>
<p>but they do that through indirect mechanisms,</p>
<p>by creating an environment,</p>
<p>a milieu in which dopamine and dopamine circuits</p>
<p>can flourish.</p>
<p>Maca is a good example of that.</p>
<p>It will reduce cortisol,</p>
<p>and through some indirect pathways related to cortisol,</p>
<p>can increase dopamine,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a direct increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>And so as a consequence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s rather subtle compared to the various compounds</p>
<p>and behaviors that I talked about today.</p>
<p>Indeed, cold water exposure leads to huge increases</p>
<p>in dopamine, as we talked about before,</p>
<p>and very sustained ones at that.</p>
<p>I realize in giving you a lot of information</p>
<p>about science and mechanism,</p>
<p>all the way from psychological and biological to circuitry</p>
<p>and synaptic transmission,</p>
<p>volumetric transmission, and so forth,</p>
<p>that it might seem overwhelming.</p>
<p>The most important things to understand</p>
<p>are that these dopamine pathways</p>
<p>really are under your control.</p>
<p>And the locus of control resides in the fact</p>
<p>that your previous levels of dopamine</p>
<p>are influencing your levels of dopamine right now,</p>
<p>and your current levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>and where you take them next</p>
<p>will influence your dopamine levels</p>
<p>in the next days and weeks to come.</p>
<p>So I hope both with the mechanisms</p>
<p>that you now have in hand,</p>
<p>plus some of the tools to tap into the dopaminergic system,</p>
<p>both behavioral, pharmacologic,</p>
<p>prescription and non-prescription, et cetera,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll feel that you have more control</p>
<p>over your dopamine system,</p>
<p>and certainly that you have a better understanding</p>
<p>of your dopamine system</p>
<p>so that you can modulate and adjust your levels of dopamine</p>
<p>in the ways that serve you best.</p>
