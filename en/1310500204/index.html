    <p>The following is a conversation between me and Michael Malus.</p>
<p>Michael is an author, anarchist, and simpleton, and I&rsquo;m proud to call him my friend.</p>
<p>He makes me smile, he makes me think, and he makes me wonder why I sound so sleepy all</p>
<p>the time.</p>
<p>And now, enjoy this conversation with Michael Malus in the Tupagalovi language that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>increasingly certain I&rsquo;ll never quite able to get the hang of.</p>
<p>Hello, comrade.</p>
<p>So Animal Farm by George Orwell is one of my favorite books.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an allegory about, at least I think, about the Soviet Union and the Russian Revolution</p>
<p>of 1917.</p>
<p>So for people who haven&rsquo;t read it, it&rsquo;s animals overthrow the humans and then slowly become</p>
<p>as bad or worse than the humans.</p>
<p>So comrade, if we lived on this farm, in the book Animal Farm, which animal would you most</p>
<p>rather be?</p>
<p>Would it be the pigs, the horses, the donkey Benjamin, the raven Moses, the humans, Mr.</p>
<p>and Mrs. Jones, the dogs, or the sheep?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go with the Milton answer, which is it&rsquo;s better to rule in hell than serve</p>
<p>in heaven, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I would have to go with the pigs.</p>
<p>So I guess I&rsquo;d be a cop.</p>
<p>At the very top.</p>
<p>So the leader, the main pig, Napoleon versus like the others.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s sure it&rsquo;s an allegory about the Russian Revolution, but I think</p>
<p>Orwell&rsquo;s point was this is broader towards most totalitarian dictatorships.</p>
<p>I mean, it could very easily be read as an indictment of Mussolini or Hitler, or many</p>
<p>of these others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge George Orwell fan.</p>
<p>One of the things that I think people on the right need to appreciate is the courage of</p>
<p>many of these undisputably left wing voices who were the strongest ones to take on totalitarian</p>
<p>communism.</p>
<p>And the three I could think of top of my head who are all in my top 10 heroes of all time</p>
<p>are Emma Goldman, Albert Camus, and Orwell being the third.</p>
<p>Something that leftists like to throw in the face of people on the right who constantly</p>
<p>invoke Orwell is that Orwell said, and I don&rsquo;t have the exact quote off the top of my head,</p>
<p>but something to the effect of every word I have written should be taken as a defense</p>
<p>of democratic socialism against totalitarianism.</p>
<p>So people like Truman was obviously very hardcore, in many ways anti communist.</p>
<p>We like to parse things out, you&rsquo;re going to laugh, into binary fashions that left good,</p>
<p>right bad, or right good, left bad.</p>
<p>But historically speaking, it would just not fall away into these camps as easily as people</p>
<p>would like.</p>
<p>And I think it is important for those of us, it takes a lot more courage to fight the right</p>
<p>from the right or to fight the left from the left, because in a sense, a lot of your countrymen</p>
<p>or your fellow travelers are going to regard you as a traitor to the cause.</p>
<p>So every chance I get, I will sing the praises of these three figures, among others, who</p>
<p>not all even if they hadn&rsquo;t done what they had done, just lived just amazing lives that</p>
<p>all of us can learn from and admire and regard as somewhat a role model.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>what was the nature of their opposition to totalitarianism?</p>
<p>Is it basically freedom, the value of freedom?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the three of them.</p>
<p>So Emma Goldman, she was an early anarchist figure, you know, we&rsquo;ll talk about her later,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure she got deported from the United States with her partner in crime, Alexander</p>
<p>Birkman, literal crime, he tried to assassinate Frick, who was Andrew Carnegie&rsquo;s main man</p>
<p>in the Pittsburgh steel mill strike.</p>
<p>She got deported to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh, you want socialism?</p>
<p>Because at the time, the anarchists were regarded as socialist, you know, go choke on it.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And she was watching in great horror what was going on.</p>
<p>And she actually went to Lenin&rsquo;s office and she goes, this isn&rsquo;t what we&rsquo;re about.</p>
<p>The revolution is about the individual and free speech and everyone working together</p>
<p>to further society.</p>
<p>And he told her that, you know, you know, free speech is a bourgeois contrivance.</p>
<p>And regardless, you can&rsquo;t have these circumstances in the midst of a revolution.</p>
<p>And when she left the Soviet Union, and you know, she went to Britain.</p>
<p>And at the time, before the 1917, there was a lot of discussion among socialist circles</p>
<p>about what would the revolution look like, right?</p>
<p>Would there be the Bakunin anarchist model?</p>
<p>Would there be the Marxist model?</p>
<p>Obviously, the Bolsheviks ended up winning.</p>
<p>But even then, it wasn&rsquo;t obvious because there was the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.</p>
<p>And what people, you know, you and I know what those words mean.</p>
<p>But Bolsheviks were kind of funny because Bolsheviks means bigger and Mensheviks means</p>
<p>smaller.</p>
<p>The Mensheviks had the numbers.</p>
<p>It was sarcastic that they were called Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks were called Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>And Lenin, you know, destroyed all his foes in a very merciless way, obviously.</p>
<p>Beforehand, you know, there was the idea like, okay, with all these cockamamie ideas, we</p>
<p>have to work together.</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to look like for the cause.</p>
<p>Then as soon as he sees power, he&rsquo;s like, yeah, yeah, we&rsquo;re not doing that kind of pluralism</p>
<p>anymore.</p>
<p>This is going to be the right approach.</p>
<p>So she left the Soviet Union, as did Berkman.</p>
<p>She wrote a book that they titled, My Disillusion with Russia.</p>
<p>And I remember this one anecdote, which I&rsquo;m going to discuss in the forthcoming book,</p>
<p>where she goes to Britain and the British were very red at the time, they really had</p>
<p>something called the Fabian Society, which was the predecessor to the British Labour</p>
<p>Party, which were like, all right, we&rsquo;re going to get rid of liberalism and have a socialist</p>
<p>kind of nation.</p>
<p>And she gave talks, and there was this one time where she gave a talk and she started,</p>
<p>and there was a standing ovation, by the time she was done, you could hear a pin drop, because</p>
<p>she dared to look at these people in the face, something they&rsquo;d been fighting for all their</p>
<p>lives and saying, you know, we&rsquo;ve been to the future and it works.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, guys, this is worse than the czar.</p>
<p>You know, people are under house arrest, you&rsquo;re not allowed to have, you know, newspapers</p>
<p>are being shut down if they have heretical views, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And you know, she was just even more of a pariah than she had been previously.</p>
<p>So she is, you know, deserves huge accolades in that regard.</p>
<p>I brought her up and we were talking about with our conversation with Yaron Orwell, I</p>
<p>think you don&rsquo;t need me to explain what he has done and continues to do to use fiction</p>
<p>to demonstrate the horrors of a totalitarian state.</p>
<p>And Camus, who might be my all time great lighthouse, so to speak, in terms of being</p>
<p>a man of conscience, you know, he joined the Communist Party and for a lot of people in</p>
<p>the States, you hear, oh, you joined the Communist Party, so I need to hear, it&rsquo;s all you need</p>
<p>to, he was a communist, all you need to know.</p>
<p>He joined the Communist Party because they were the main ones fighting the fascists in</p>
<p>France and other locations.</p>
<p>And he took Nazism, as did many others, of course, very, very, very seriously.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t some committed communist, but this was just his mechanism to take on, you know,</p>
<p>be part of the underground in Vichy France, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So he had the quote, which is ascribed to him, which is kind of a misquote, Howard Zinn</p>
<p>is the one who actually said it, that it is a job of thinking people not to be on the</p>
<p>side of the executioners.</p>
<p>And he very much felt, if you read his speech when he won the Nobel Prize, I forget, in</p>
<p>the 50s, where he goes, it&rsquo;s basically the job of writers to keep civilization from destroying</p>
<p>himself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ever going to be a man on the level of Camus and what he&rsquo;s accomplished,</p>
<p>but I think that vision of it is the job of writers to be the conscience and to point</p>
<p>out, you know, this is the leftism at its best when, you know, giving voice to the voiceless,</p>
<p>when you have the machine of the state crushing and marginalizing people, and they might not</p>
<p>be educated, literate, or have any power at all.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the guy who&rsquo;s like, you are ruining humans, these humans matter, and I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>let you look the other way and act like you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So in this time, whether we look at the time of fascism, or we look at the fictional Animal</p>
<p>Farm, what&rsquo;s the heroic action then?</p>
<p>So Camus joined the Communist Party, there&rsquo;s a bunch of different heroic actions, some</p>
<p>more heroic than others, not just for the, you know, hero is the wrong word, in terms</p>
<p>of like effectiveness, what&rsquo;s the effective action, I guess is what I want to ask.</p>
<p>As a writer, as a thinker, as somebody with a mind, what&rsquo;s the heroic action?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tricky question, because a lot of times in the West, heroism is regardless intertwined</p>
<p>with martyrdom, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of this idea of like, you have to speak to, you know, Camus always talked</p>
<p>about justice, let justice be done though the heavens fall.</p>
<p>This is a common kind of motto among people with conscience, and that you have to do the</p>
<p>right thing, even the consequences might not be what you like.</p>
<p>And I think that is a good loose definition of heroism.</p>
<p>So if you meet, I&rsquo;ll give you one example of heroism.</p>
<p>This was on Twitter, and I really feel bad that I don&rsquo;t remember the guy&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>This was the line to Auschwitz, I believe it was, and you know, there&rsquo;s the Nazi guards</p>
<p>keeping everyone along.</p>
<p>And if you were certain, I think if you were under 12, they killed you or something, there</p>
<p>was some age limit where some kids were killed or some were not, there was some circumstances.</p>
<p>And he asked the mom how old this kid was, and she&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s 14, and she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>no, he&rsquo;s 12.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, no, he&rsquo;s 14.</p>
<p>She goes, he&rsquo;s 12.</p>
<p>And she realized what this Nazi was telling her even in that circumstance, and it ended</p>
<p>up saving the kid&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>So I think heroism in this context is defiance and standing true to values of liberalism,</p>
<p>humanism and venerating the sanctity of human life.</p>
<p>I think that, and I think it&rsquo;s also important to pick your battles.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think if, you know, he got, that Nazi over there got in a bullhorn and said, hey,</p>
<p>this is the rules, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that&rsquo;s not going to help anyone do anything.</p>
<p>So I do think, you know, people a lot of times attack me for my anarchist views, like, oh,</p>
<p>you know, would you call the police?</p>
<p>Would you use the roads?</p>
<p>Would you pay your income taxes?</p>
<p>You know, I got in an argument with Tim Pool, because there was that couple, I think it</p>
<p>was at Missouri or Illinois when they had their guns and they were being arrested and</p>
<p>they basically took a plea deal and he said, you should have fought.</p>
<p>I go, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to say you should fight, but we don&rsquo;t know what circumstance</p>
<p>someone is under.</p>
<p>And what these totalitarian regimes did very, very well, as you know, is if you were a target</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t get through to you, that&rsquo;s fine, you have a family.</p>
<p>So you can sit there, Lex, and gird your jaw and you can stand up to all the torture, cool,</p>
<p>what are we going to do about your wife?</p>
<p>What about your mom?</p>
<p>One thing Stalin did, he made it a law that kids up to 14 and up could get the death penalty</p>
<p>for certain crimes.</p>
<p>So after that, the rule was from the NKVD, if you were interrogating someone, they would</p>
<p>have death warrants for the kid&rsquo;s child on the desk visible.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m interrogating you asking you to commit to, I&rsquo;m sorry, to admit to some crime that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not committed.</p>
<p>And those piece of paper, it&rsquo;s Svitlana, she&rsquo;s got a death warrant.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to admit to any crime you want.</p>
<p>So this is something Americans, this is even the case right now in North Korea, which I</p>
<p>know you had Yonmi Park on, it&rsquo;s something I talk about a lot.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about it instead of the hypothetical, but this is happening right now on earth.</p>
<p>You can look at the map on Google.</p>
<p>The great leader, Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea said, class enemies must be</p>
<p>exterminated three generations.</p>
<p>So North, when people talk about individualism versus collectivism, Rick Santorum from Ascender</p>
<p>says the family is the basic unit of society, unit.</p>
<p>North Korea takes that seriously.</p>
<p>The family is punished as a unit.</p>
<p>So if someone does something wrong, three generations have to pay the price and you</p>
<p>often don&rsquo;t know who it is that got you all in trouble.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a trial.</p>
<p>This to Western minds is something almost incomprehensible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot easier to be brave when it&rsquo;s just your skin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something when it&rsquo;s your child, your loved ones, every man becomes a coward.</p>
<p>But also what bravery is there for me to write an essay for The Guardian to say, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>vote.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no consequences to me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no possibility of consequences to me.</p>
<p>This is the wonderful thing about living in a free country.</p>
<p>It would take a lot of courage to be in the Soviet Union and say, I&rsquo;m not going to vote.</p>
<p>And what would that courage accomplish?</p>
<p>Very little.</p>
<p>Heroism in the sense of kind of the suicidal stuff and taking a stance with no consequences</p>
<p>is a bit overrated.</p>
<p>There is some aspect, like the way I think about heroism is something like you said about</p>
<p>the Nazi soldier, which is quietly privately in your own life, live the virtues that you</p>
<p>want the rest of the world to live by.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So like without writing about it is not as heroic as living it quietly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a great example of this.</p>
<p>I sometimes give talks on networking and I tell the kids, if you know someone&rsquo;s in town</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s their birthday with nothing to do, take them out.</p>
<p>And I say, I do this for selfish reasons and everyone laughs and I go, think about it this</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>The guy who takes people out for their birthday is awesome.</p>
<p>That could be you.</p>
<p>Like you have that capacity to be that person and you&rsquo;re making that day feel special.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to remember for a long time.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the cost?</p>
<p>30 bucks, 25 bucks.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very disturbing to me how often people have opportunities to slightly move the needle</p>
<p>and make things a bit better at almost no cost.</p>
<p>And they just literally don&rsquo;t think in those terms.</p>
<p>And one of the things Camus talked about, he&rsquo;s often described as an existentialist,</p>
<p>which he did not like that term.</p>
<p>He regarded himself as an absurdist, is the idea that we&rsquo;re basically blank canvases.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t something that is dangerous.</p>
<p>This is an enormous opportunity.</p>
<p>And you have the ability to become the kind of man or woman that you admire and want to</p>
<p>be.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be, I don&rsquo;t know, George Washington or one of these great heroes of</p>
<p>all time.</p>
<p>But everyone out there has the capacity to be, excuse me, to be a hero to their kids</p>
<p>or to be a hero to maybe some, there&rsquo;s nursing homes and there&rsquo;s old people who are lonely.</p>
<p>I think that you take in a dog that&rsquo;s on its last legs.</p>
<p>These are little things, Terry Shepherd does that a lot, I regarded him as a hero.</p>
<p>These are not Terry Shepherd, I&rsquo;m blanking his name.</p>
<p>These are things that people do that aren&rsquo;t heroic in the sense of Superman, but that</p>
<p>I find admirable extremely and I think are very underrated because these people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>championed.</p>
<p>Is this some kind of weird, passive, aggressive and direct way for you to tell me that I should</p>
<p>take you off for your birthday on Monday?</p>
<p>Is that why you gave that whole speech?</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t it at all.</p>
<p>That was a joke, Michael.</p>
<p>No, it was a failed joke.</p>
<p>Nevertheless.</p>
<p>There was no punchline.</p>
<p>Without failure, we would not have triumph.</p>
<p>Can we stick on the Camus absurdism versus existentialism?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What do you think is the difference?</p>
<p>In your ideas about anarchism too, it seems like those are somehow intricately connected</p>
<p>because existentialism is connected to freedom and freedom is connected to anarchism.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But I mean, Sartre was a defender of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>He said explicitly about things like gulags, like even if it&rsquo;s true, we shouldn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>What people don&rsquo;t appreciate is how human beings can have contradictory ideas in their</p>
<p>minds at the same time.</p>
<p>One would think, okay, someone&rsquo;s a Democrat, they think ABC, therefore they think DEF.</p>
<p>People would have all sorts of contradictions and it&rsquo;s not at all clear and they&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>a clean conscience because the human mind is very sophisticated and is capable of doing</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>So Sartre, you would think he&rsquo;s this radical individualist, this sense of ultimate freedom,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s defending the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Camus, on the other hand, would probably be, was very much like a social Democrat.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t really talk about what politics should be so much as it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>His essay, Reflections on the Guillotine, is one of the great masterpieces of all time,</p>
<p>an attack on the death penalty, not in terms of no one&rsquo;s evil or it&rsquo;s wrong to kill murderers,</p>
<p>but in terms of what does it do for a society?</p>
<p>If you have someone who takes a person and locks them in a room and says, in two years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to murder you and you lock them for that.</p>
<p>This is not someone we regard as moral, we regard this as someone who&rsquo;s a complete monster,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what the state does with the death penalty.</p>
<p>And he challenges us to think, is this the kind of people we want to be?</p>
<p>And again, he&rsquo;s saying, I&rsquo;m not saying killing a murderer is wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying evil is wrong.</p>
<p>His entire career was dedicated to fighting the concept of evil.</p>
<p>But are we the kind of people who want to be doing these things that in any other context</p>
<p>we regard as torture or depraved?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m much more of a Camus person than a Sartre person.</p>
<p>So he was probably against war in that same way.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I have to admit, I don&rsquo;t know much about the political side of Camus.</p>
<p>Well, and I don&rsquo;t think his political side is that interesting or relevant.</p>
<p>What I find, sorry to interrupt you, what I find fascinating about Camus and what I</p>
<p>think about on a daily basis from him is his insistence that you have to live a life based</p>
<p>on conscience, that you have to be accountable to yourself when you put your head on the</p>
<p>pelt at the end of the day and ask yourself, did I live a righteous life with integrity</p>
<p>true to my values?</p>
<p>Did I not needlessly cause harm to innocent people?</p>
<p>That kind of mindset, did I, if someone is weak, am I using that as an opportunity to</p>
<p>exploit them or to harm them?</p>
<p>Or do I feel a bit of sympathy or empathy for this person because maybe they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have circumstances that were as beneficial as other people had.</p>
<p>Well, how does that fit absurdism where everything is absurd, nothing has meaning, it really</p>
<p>borders on nihilism.</p>
<p>So he regards, his philosophy explicitly said is a response to nihilism and a attack on</p>
<p>nihilism.</p>
<p>He regards cynicism as the worst value people can have.</p>
<p>And I agree with him 100%.</p>
<p>A lot of times people call me cynical online and I push back very, very hard because to</p>
<p>be a, you know, I had this quote in the new write where I said, I&rsquo;d rather be naive than</p>
<p>a cynic because a cynic is a hopeless man who projects his hopelessness to the world</p>
<p>at large.</p>
<p>Camus, this is the metaphor I use and I find it very inspirational.</p>
<p>I thought it was in his work, but I guess I thought if it described it to him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two types of people, you imagine you go to a mountainside and you see a blank canvas</p>
<p>on an easel standing in front of this mountainside.</p>
<p>One people be like, why is this blank canvas here, you know, what was this, what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on here?</p>
<p>And just be confused.</p>
<p>Whereas the other type of person will be like, there&rsquo;s a blank canvas here in this beautiful</p>
<p>countryside, what a great opportunity.</p>
<p>I can paint this river, I could paint that bird, I could paint my friends or myself in</p>
<p>the background, infinite choices.</p>
<p>And this is a gift that I have been given.</p>
<p>And I think that also ties very heavily into what I was, I went to yeshiva as a kid, which</p>
<p>is Jewish school.</p>
<p>What we were taught incessantly how to look at life is this beautiful gift that God has</p>
<p>given you and that God wants you to be happy.</p>
<p>He wants you to live to the fullest in a moral way.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I went into a church and they were asking questions about the Jewish</p>
<p>concept, the afterlife.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t familiar with Jewish thought.</p>
<p>And it took me a second because I didn&rsquo;t really have answers.</p>
<p>And then I remembered what we were taught, which is, let&rsquo;s suppose you&rsquo;re at this banquet,</p>
<p>the best chef on earth, and the table is so heavy because you&rsquo;ve got steaks and you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got chicken and you&rsquo;ve got sushi and the wine&rsquo;s flowing and you&rsquo;ve got your Dr. Pepper and</p>
<p>Mr. Pibb and the store brand, everything you want.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re looking around at this amazing bounty, right?</p>
<p>And then you turn to this best chef on earth and you&rsquo;re like, oh, so what&rsquo;s for dessert?</p>
<p>I mean, the offensiveness of that is just so insane.</p>
<p>You have this, eat the meal.</p>
<p>I promise you, if I could deliver this meal, the dessert&rsquo;s going to be okay.</p>
<p>So this focus on the afterlife when we&rsquo;ve been given this amazing gift on this earth</p>
<p>is a very kind of different mindset from both the Jewish tradition as I&rsquo;d been taught and</p>
<p>the Camus mindset.</p>
<p>Obviously, Camus was an atheist, didn&rsquo;t believe in an afterlife.</p>
<p>This concept that life is meaningless, but that means you have that opportunity to find</p>
<p>value, to seek for truth, to seek for happiness.</p>
<p>And Camus has this quote, it&rsquo;s ascribed to him, it&rsquo;s like a meme.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never found the source, so maybe he doesn&rsquo;t really say it, but he says, maybe it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about happy endings, maybe it&rsquo;s about the journey.</p>
<p>And I think when you have that mindset, and as you and I, I think you and I both found</p>
<p>this because neither of us, when we were kids, thought we&rsquo;d be doing this, right?</p>
<p>But now that we are really fortunate.</p>
<p>Definitely this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And definitely that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But now that we&rsquo;re fortunate enough to do this, and that we&rsquo;re blessed enough that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people who find this of value and interest, and we could pay the rent doing this, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a day that goes by where I don&rsquo;t think you and I think, this is pretty absurd, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also pretty wonderful.</p>
<p>And as a consequence of us thriving, it also shows other people that happiness is possible</p>
<p>on this earth.</p>
<p>And I think cynicism is the lie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the worldview, it&rsquo;s a lie that happiness is not possible on this earth.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s only possible if you sell your soul and you&rsquo;re a bad person, you screw other people</p>
<p>over.</p>
<p>I reject that in every aspect.</p>
<p>As you said, my birthday is coming up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling just a lot of really great things have been happening very, very recently.</p>
<p>So it affects me very heavily emotionally, especially when I see the response it gives</p>
<p>to the kids.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one thing to say, this is what I&rsquo;m for.</p>
<p>But when you can provide proof of concept that what you&rsquo;ve been advocating does result</p>
<p>in positive responses.</p>
<p>I got a message from this kid who had tried to kill himself a year ago.</p>
<p>And then he was like, look, I found your work, I found some other stuff.</p>
<p>And now I realized I&rsquo;m going to make something of myself.</p>
<p>I was born in a meth house, you know, whatever, 19, 20 years old, I should be in the garbage.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to try to be a stand up because I have opportunity on this earth.</p>
<p>Even if he fails as a stand up, you know, he&rsquo;s still such whatever he does, washing</p>
<p>dishes, there&rsquo;s no shame in that.</p>
<p>Is it so bad to have a crappy job and a girlfriend who you don&rsquo;t really like?</p>
<p>But as compared to the alternative of like, I&rsquo;m going to kill myself.</p>
<p>This is heaven.</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s beauty to be discovered in all of it and all of those experiences.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, but at the same time, so I often think about I just recently reread The Idiot by</p>
<p>Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>I often feel like the idiot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when I say I&rsquo;m an idiot, I often think about Prince Mishkin, that kind of idiot,</p>
<p>which the world sees you as naive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s naive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m naive, but I tend to see the good in people and the good in every moment.</p>
<p>And the world often is cynical.</p>
<p>And in fact, especially in what we do, often the intellectual is supposed to be cynical.</p>
<p>This is very much an urban, elite, educated mindset, where if you write a book about someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s suppose, a drug addict or a prostitute, that has heft and that&rsquo;s valid.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re writing a book about like a love story, you know, two people fall in love</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in roller coasters or carousels, that&rsquo;s less legitimate.</p>
<p>I hate that.</p>
<p>I hate that so much because the message it gives to people is you have to choose between</p>
<p>thriving and happiness and silliness and seriousness and depravity.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying a drug addict or prostitute is depraved, but they&rsquo;re basically their worldviews.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s dark and twisted, it doesn&rsquo;t really count as art.</p>
<p>And I despise that mindset, that subtext.</p>
<p>So the internet and people around me often will call me naive.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think the word they want is innocent.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a better word.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not that innocent.</p>
<p>No, but innocent in that you genuinely in your heart, I know you fairly well at this</p>
<p>point, believe that goodness is possible and that people can, if not be good, at least</p>
<p>be better than they were yesterday.</p>
<p>See, even the word naive or the word innocent presumes that there&rsquo;s not wisdom in that.</p>
<p>Presumes that somehow that&rsquo;s, oh, isn&rsquo;t that beautiful to live that life of a child who</p>
<p>sees the world with these bright eyes and is hopeful about the future, but just wait</p>
<p>until they grow up and realize that reality is much harsher than they think.</p>
<p>But that child might be wiser than all of the adults in the room.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t you want to be, if the world is like that, don&rsquo;t you want to be the guy who</p>
<p>takes it on and changes it for the better?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like saying, well, you know, cancer is everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>Well, don&rsquo;t you want to be the one who says, not anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here and I&rsquo;m going to make that change and I can see it being better than it is now.</p>
<p>So I think you and I have the same analysis of your worldview and I don&rsquo;t think that there</p>
<p>is a good word for it.</p>
<p>So I guess it&rsquo;s this idea of inherent benevolence might be wordy, but I think that&rsquo;s more accurate</p>
<p>because, you know, you and I did not have such easy lives growing up, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>You constantly talk about just horrific aspects of life.</p>
<p>So to claim that you kind of don&rsquo;t know that they exist or you sleep under the rug is completely</p>
<p>not accurate to your work and your mindset.</p>
<p>Can we talk about World War II and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So on Sunday, June 22nd, 1941, Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, which was the surprise</p>
<p>invasion of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If I could read to you a few lyrics from a song that for some reason is stuck throughout</p>
<p>my childhood.</p>
<p>It was a famous song during that time.</p>
<p>–î–≤–∞–¥—Ü–∞—Ç—å –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ –∏—é–Ω—è —Ä–æ–≤–Ω–æ –≤ —á–µ—Ç—ã—Ä–µ —á–∞—Å–∞ –ö–∏–µ–≤ –±–æ–º–±–∏–ª–∏, –Ω–∞–º –æ–±—ä—è–≤–∏–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ</p>
<p>–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞, –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–≤–µ—Ç–µ, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—É —É–±–∏—Ç—å, —Å–ø–∞–ª–∏ —Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏,</p>
<p>—Å–ø–∞–ª–∏ –∏—Ö –¥–µ—Ç–∏, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏ –ö–∏–µ–≤ –±–æ–º–±–∏—Ç—å.</p>
<p>The song talks about Kiev, like that moment as part of that operation that Kiev was first</p>
<p>bombed and it was announced on June 22nd.</p>
<p>The song says at exactly four o clock that the war has begun.</p>
<p>For some reason this song haunts me because the exactness of that time and this realization</p>
<p>that at any moment you can have this thing happen to you in your own personal life.</p>
<p>Maybe we had something like 9 11 happen where everything changes and it&rsquo;s just like haunting</p>
<p>because it makes me think that at any moment something like that could happen that changes</p>
<p>everything and I just think about like normal life going on in Kiev at the time and then</p>
<p>all of a sudden the bombs are dropping and they announce that the war has begun and you</p>
<p>thought you were going to stay out of the war.</p>
<p>This is something that is very intensely emotional for me because you and I are both Russian</p>
<p>Jewish so to know that my grandparents and my great grandma were told that the Nazis</p>
<p>are coming and this wasn&rsquo;t a dress rehearsal and that if they get here, which they do,</p>
<p>they did, Lvov is very western Ukraine, that 100% you and all your relatives are going</p>
<p>to be murdered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a monument now in Lvov where I&rsquo;m from about this but I don&rsquo;t think either of us</p>
<p>can imagine what it&rsquo;s like to think that we&rsquo;re about minutes or whatever hours or there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just the Russian army standing between us and everyone we are related to are going to</p>
<p>be murdered for no reason and what&rsquo;s the closure here?</p>
<p>They evacuated a lot of people but they didn&rsquo;t evacuate enough and to know that there is</p>
<p>this force coming to 100% murder you, this isn&rsquo;t some kind of the TV news being hyperbolic,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re coming to kill you and if they get you, they will kill you.</p>
<p>We all think about war like, oh, we hope America wins in Iraq, but if America got their ass</p>
<p>get kind of in Vietnam, it&rsquo;s not really going to affect America in the sense that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have the body bags and all the kids being killed and that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not super in the rug, but no one in America thought the Vietnamese are going to come here</p>
<p>and kill them, right?</p>
<p>They were secure in their person.</p>
<p>So to have that sense of we really need to win because if we don&rsquo;t win, we are 100% if</p>
<p>we, they, the Russian army doesn&rsquo;t win, we are 100% all going to be slaughtered and often</p>
<p>in not just a bullet to the head and in sadistic ways is something that to know that people</p>
<p>who share my blood saw and went through is very hard for me to kind of wrap my head around.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no possibility to delude yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because I mean, they, they would, as the song also talks about, but that they would burn</p>
<p>the factories.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically saying we&rsquo;re in the war now.</p>
<p>This is like, this is your life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like this is our life now.</p>
<p>You know how you, yesterday you worried about like, oh, I misplaced my pen.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, yeah, this was paradise.</p>
<p>Most of us are going to just, our life now is that most of us are going to die.</p>
<p>And if we want to prevent all of us from dying, we, we have to fight.</p>
<p>And we also can&rsquo;t sit down in some kind of weird, like, desert island or, you know, plane</p>
<p>crash situation and be like, let&rsquo;s decide between us who&rsquo;s going to be the first to</p>
<p>die.</p>
<p>Maybe the like Titanic, the Titanic, right?</p>
<p>They sat down and there were like women and children in the lifeboats.</p>
<p>You know, they had this rational agreement.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have those choices in a war.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s something that I, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just very chilling and it&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really have the emotional space to understand or grapple with.</p>
<p>Even, you know, obviously I&rsquo;ve been to North Korea, you can see it and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>You and I can&rsquo;t, or anyone listening to this, except for maybe on me and people like that,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t imagine what that&rsquo;s like to live it.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t, I, we can&rsquo;t imagine what it&rsquo;s like to live in those situations where it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like before Hitler came, everyone&rsquo;s, you know, dancing around and having a great time.</p>
<p>I mean, imagine how, what that life is like where your preference to Hitler is starving</p>
<p>and waiting on line for hours for bread and to have the secret police and your friend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>attorney went and your phones are all tapped and you&rsquo;re a prisoner.</p>
<p>But to you, this is infinitely better than the alternative.</p>
<p>Like these are the choices that, you know, our family had to deal with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that no matter how much you, it&rsquo;s like a, let me put it in terms of people</p>
<p>can understand, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your first bad breakup, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a much simpler thing to wrap your head around because it&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>had it, you can&rsquo;t really, but when you feel it, it&rsquo;s just so intense, but you can&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>someone what&rsquo;s like, we could sit down for days and hours and have people tell us, but</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s the totality of your environment and your life and your mindset, I remember</p>
<p>my grandma, she would talk about it like, when you&rsquo;re that hungry, all you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about is bread because your brain won&rsquo;t like, you know, human beings, you know, we&rsquo;re evolved,</p>
<p>we have instincts, whatever, and the mind is telling you food, food, food, food, food,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s kids thinking this and that they&rsquo;re not going to get the food.</p>
<p>And imagine being a parent and you&rsquo;re watching your kids without food and knowing they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to get the food.</p>
<p>And the fact that this happened in North Korea in the nineties, I met a refugee and he had</p>
<p>to watch his dad starve to death.</p>
<p>And thank you.</p>
<p>And we have no concept of what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>I mean, we kind of, you know, it&rsquo;s just like last night here in Austin, all the places</p>
<p>were closed and I couldn&rsquo;t get my protein powder.</p>
<p>And this is the extent of my suffering when it comes to food, you know, or if I couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there was a restaurant that I went to in Brooklyn where for some faqaqta reason, they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>serving sashimi, they only had sushi, so I had to have the rice and the carbs.</p>
<p>To live a life where that is the extent of your food problems as opposed to the choice</p>
<p>is either Hitler killing you or being hungry 24 seven.</p>
<p>You know, my grandma told this story of how they had a close call, it was her and her</p>
<p>brother and her mom, my great grandma who passed, and I think there was like either</p>
<p>helicopter overhead or something, and my great grandma jumped on top of my grandma&rsquo;s brother</p>
<p>and not my grandma.</p>
<p>So she basically did a Sophie&rsquo;s Choice, my grandma&rsquo;s name is Sophia, and chose the brother.</p>
<p>And this is something that she felt, you know, all her life that her mom had chosen her brother</p>
<p>over her.</p>
<p>But these little things that happen, these little kind of decisions we have to make in</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a book I read called Five Chimneys, I think, this woman who was an Auschwitz survivor.</p>
<p>And what she talked about what people don&rsquo;t appreciate, it&rsquo;s not necessarily the slaughter</p>
<p>and the torture, it&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s no rhyme or reason to it.</p>
<p>Like she talked about how they had a camp just for people from Czechoslovakia, and they</p>
<p>were treated better than the Jews, and then one day they just killed them all, right?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, I still don&rsquo;t understand why they&rsquo;re giving them food and treating them</p>
<p>well, and then the next day they&rsquo;re all killed, and we will never get answers, you know.</p>
<p>And things like she talks about how they decided to kill all the kids, and they didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>either for some reason they didn&rsquo;t have the courage to or they wanted to be cruel, so</p>
<p>instead of shooting them, they just kept walking them in the snow until they all died.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s things like this, that the fact that you and I dodged these bullets, and that we</p>
<p>can be here and be doing this and, you know, running our mouths for a living, I think about</p>
<p>it all the time, and it&rsquo;s just very disturbing to know, and I know you know this as well,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s lots of places on earth where if people had a choice, they would kill us</p>
<p>on sight and be proud of themselves for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, there, I don&rsquo;t know what to make of the contrast, you were talking about the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been truly happy the last few weeks and months, there&rsquo;s been a lot of moments</p>
<p>of happiness and joy, and that joy is built on a history of human suffering.</p>
<p>Like in your roots, in your blood, is a lot of people that were tortured that suffered,</p>
<p>so that you could have this joy, and you have both the, you have the responsibility to truly</p>
<p>be grateful for that joy.</p>
<p>But it also shows that there&rsquo;s the happy ending, that it does end, and a good note that it</p>
<p>does get infinitely, infinitely better.</p>
<p>And that I think there&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t like using the word responsibility, but there is an opportunity</p>
<p>for those of us who did dodge that bullet, to give testimony to these people.</p>
<p>And more importantly, to give testimony to the people who are going through this now.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons I talk about North Korea so much, why I wrote Dear Reader, is because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy, and this is human nature, I&rsquo;m not condemning people, I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just how people are wired.</p>
<p>When you see an Asian country with Asian people, and things are bad over there, I think in</p>
<p>the West it&rsquo;s like, oh, Asia, they&rsquo;re all crazy, they&rsquo;re wacky, they eat dogs or so</p>
<p>on and so forth, some weird stereotype, and they think of them as kind of Martians.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important for people who aren&rsquo;t of that kind of ancestry to kind of speak on</p>
<p>behalf of these people, because it&rsquo;s very different how just people just naturally react</p>
<p>when you have a Westerner talking about this.</p>
<p>Instead of it becoming them over there, it becomes, you know, this could have been us</p>
<p>very easily.</p>
<p>I have a friend, Peter Vahansky, great dude, and I was showing him photos when I was in</p>
<p>Pyongyang, and he goes, this looks like a Russian city with Asian people.</p>
<p>It completely disturbed him.</p>
<p>So that was one of the reasons I did go to North Korea, because that was as close as</p>
<p>I would get to see what your family went through, to see what my family went through, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still living under this regime.</p>
<p>And one of the things I fought very hard to do with Dear Reader, which I was successful</p>
<p>in amazingly, and I said, I could die now.</p>
<p>I feel like if you just move the needle a little bit, then you&rsquo;ve kind of paid your</p>
<p>due for your time here on this earth, to have it change from being a laughing stock.</p>
<p>And I think Team America did a good job.</p>
<p>They made Kim Jong Il into a clown and they made a joke of it, but you&rsquo;re going from nothing</p>
<p>to joke.</p>
<p>So at least now people are aware of it that it exists, right?</p>
<p>And then I and many others took it from a joke to like, guys, this is really, really,</p>
<p>really bad, and none of us can even appreciate how bad it is.</p>
<p>And I think now there is an understanding, other than a few people who are just looking</p>
<p>at it through a Trump lens and wanting Trump to fail because Trump&rsquo;s an asshole and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine, to be like these poor people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really unfortunate because there&rsquo;s a segment of Western culture who thinks that</p>
<p>correctly, often when you&rsquo;re complaining about or discussing the plight of another country,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just your prelude to war and an excuse to invade.</p>
<p>Like the Kurds in Syria, you know, we&rsquo;re talked about, if we don&rsquo;t in Syria tomorrow, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be another genocide, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying let&rsquo;s invade North Korea and things like that.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is, you know, thank God that this isn&rsquo;t your life.</p>
<p>I bring this up all the time.</p>
<p>The woman who was my guide when I was there, I&rsquo;m aware of what she&rsquo;s up to now.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s extremely rich by North Korean standards, but she&rsquo;ll never be in a position to buy medicine.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll never be in a position to go on a vacation.</p>
<p>Things that you and I just, you know, whatever, she can&rsquo;t go on the internet.</p>
<p>She can&rsquo;t get an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>She can&rsquo;t better herself as a person other than through what the state allows and meaning</p>
<p>better yourself as a person in service to the state.</p>
<p>So I mean, it&rsquo;s also frustrating because there&rsquo;s only so much that I can do as an individual.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your takeaway about human nature from looking at North Korea and looking at how</p>
<p>the rest of the world is looking at North Korea?</p>
<p>This is a great question.</p>
<p>I think about it fairly often.</p>
<p>I always say human beings are animals, right?</p>
<p>When you say someone&rsquo;s an animal, it&rsquo;s like a slur, like he&rsquo;s like a beast.</p>
<p>Animals are capable of enormous kindness, empathy, sympathy.</p>
<p>You know, they look out for one another, groom one another.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thing with apes where they groom each other for parasites and even if there</p>
<p>are no parasites, they pretend there&rsquo;s parasites just to have that kind of bonding.</p>
<p>You see infinite photos online of like cats raising puppies because the puppies, mom died,</p>
<p>things like this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of being an animal.</p>
<p>Part of being an animal is also just the most monstrous cruelty.</p>
<p>Killer whales, you know, there&rsquo;s this big PC move to not call them killer whales and</p>
<p>just call them orcas.</p>
<p>They will murder blue whale pups, calves, excuse me, and play with them and not even</p>
<p>eat them.</p>
<p>So they just murder for the sake of fun.</p>
<p>Even cats, you know, kill birds all the time, things like this.</p>
<p>So it runs the whole gamut.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s, you know, when Yaron and I were on your show, I don&rsquo;t think Lord of</p>
<p>the Flies is accurate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Hobbs is how reality works when you&rsquo;re in that kind of state.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;ve seen countless examples of human beings, especially when human beings</p>
<p>have power over someone who&rsquo;s powerless, of allowing themselves to engage in not just</p>
<p>harm, but cruelty.</p>
<p>And that is something as Soviets, you and I are very painfully aware of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the oppression, which as bad enough as it is, it&rsquo;s that mediocre</p>
<p>person with that little bit of power.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re standing between you and your daughter having medicine, and they love it</p>
<p>to make you dance, to be like, oh, you need me to get this medicine?</p>
<p>Make you go through hoops?</p>
<p>Because now they feel like for the first time in their life, they&rsquo;re in a position of strength</p>
<p>and power.</p>
<p>I think that is, in many ways, the more common nature of evil that what Hannah Arendt talks</p>
<p>about the banality of evil, then someone who&rsquo;s like an SS guard, you&rsquo;re shooting someone</p>
<p>in the head.</p>
<p>Like that, I think we could all wrap our heads around to some extent, like, okay, I&rsquo;m a military.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>I have to execute people pulling a trigger, you could kind of have this mental disconnect</p>
<p>between the finger and the victim.</p>
<p>But like that little day to day stuff, like, are you doing the right thing on a day to</p>
<p>day basis that I think is far more common, and far more disturbing aspect in certain</p>
<p>senses of the human psyche.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something especially disturbing about a weak man, given power, and just abusing</p>
<p>that power.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about not just weak, but like, mediocre at everything it does, or less</p>
<p>than mediocre.</p>
<p>A great example of this, which I&rsquo;m also talking about in the next book is Ceausescu, who was</p>
<p>the dictator of Romania.</p>
<p>So you know, the Cold War is still somewhat poorly understood in, you know, popular culture.</p>
<p>But the different countries in the second world, the Soviet bloc, some are more liberal</p>
<p>than others, some are more sane than others.</p>
<p>And Ceausescu, at first was one of the, you know, more Western friendly, more the free</p>
<p>ones.</p>
<p>Then he met the great leader Kim Il Sung from North Korea, and he had the idea to impose</p>
<p>a personality cult on Romania, and it&rsquo;s the kind of things like forcing people to breed</p>
<p>because he wanted to make people taller.</p>
<p>I think he made like the biggest building in all of Europe, the People&rsquo;s Palace, but</p>
<p>it was just for him, while there&rsquo;s no electricity, you know, elsewhere.</p>
<p>But you look at this guy, you know, Stalin&rsquo;s a badass, right?</p>
<p>He was a bank robber.</p>
<p>If you look at photos of him as a kid, he was a hunk.</p>
<p>Lenin was clearly intellectual.</p>
<p>These were powerful Trotsky, these were powerful men with huge egos, huge force of personality.</p>
<p>But you look at this Ceausescu guy, and you could, like for example, on my driver&rsquo;s license,</p>
<p>instead of my address, I&rsquo;m not giving my real address, being like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th Avenue,</p>
<p>by mistake it says 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th Street, right?</p>
<p>So you can imagine him being in the post office and me giving him my ID to get my package</p>
<p>and him being baffled because this says street, this says Avenue instead of understanding.</p>
<p>And this, the look on his face, this dullard, that you can see how, you know how sometimes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to, can I curse?</p>
<p>Fuck yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you know, like how if you&rsquo;re in the airport and you see someone and you look at</p>
<p>them and an adult and you think, okay, this person was born fucked up, just like on sight,</p>
<p>like something&rsquo;s wrong with them.</p>
<p>How are they traveling alone?</p>
<p>You look at Ceausescu, you look at him, you&rsquo;re like, something&rsquo;s not right with this guy.</p>
<p>Not in the sense of like evil, but in the sense of he&rsquo;s a simpleton, right?</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s in charge of this whole country and everyone&rsquo;s taught to regard him as one</p>
<p>of the great geniuses of all time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this, the idea, this mediocre nobody, this guy would have in any other culture been</p>
<p>accomplished nothing or would have had an honest job where he&rsquo;s like, okay, he works</p>
<p>at the mail service and he&rsquo;s bad at it, okay, fine, he&rsquo;s not hurting anyone.</p>
<p>And now as a result of this, he&rsquo;s responsible for mass death, secret police, and incarceration.</p>
<p>And you know, one of the greatest things I&rsquo;ve ever seen, which I&rsquo;m sure many people see</p>
<p>as well, if you go on YouTube, it&rsquo;s his speech, and it&rsquo;s the first time the crowd turns and</p>
<p>his head kind of like, because they start booing him, which was unheard of.</p>
<p>And he was shot with his dog faced wife not that long after, it was just a great moment.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s things like this, I agree with you, that mediocre, weak person is now in a position</p>
<p>of power over somebody else.</p>
<p>And that sense of vindictiveness, like I&rsquo;m going to feel strong for once in my life,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s going to be at your expense.</p>
<p>That I think is, you know, human nature, it&rsquo;s most primal.</p>
<p>And every time I meet a person in this world, you&rsquo;re the first person to get me to cry on</p>
<p>a fucking podcast.</p>
<p>Fucking the robot gets me to cry.</p>
<p>What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p>Every time I meet a weird person, somebody, to me, heroism is also taking a risk to rebel</p>
<p>against mediocrity.</p>
<p>Like in the most simplest of ways, like the license address, like taking a risk to break</p>
<p>the little bit of rule that nobody will know about, to take that little bit of a leap of</p>
<p>like that little protest against the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Like that Nazi guard where he just spoke out, he&rsquo;s like, hey lady.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a big, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, like literally at the line at Starbucks or something like that.</p>
<p>Like even in the tiniest of ways, when I see people just like, it&rsquo;s almost like that little</p>
<p>like glimmer in their eye, a wink, like we&rsquo;re in this together, there&rsquo;s all this conformity</p>
<p>all around us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at a different time could have been Nazi Germany, could have been a Stalinist</p>
<p>Soviet union.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to rebel against that conformity by just taking the risk, that little bit of</p>
<p>risk against mediocrity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And then once again, I see this in companies too.</p>
<p>When I see the mediocrity, I see this, I used to work at Google, I see it in Google and</p>
<p>when the companies grow, that mediocrity is overwhelming.</p>
<p>The Peter principle, right?</p>
<p>The Peter principle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My hope is that all of us have the possibility for that glimmer, that risk taking, the leap</p>
<p>of faith, whatever the heck that is, the leap out of the ordinary, out of the conformity,</p>
<p>out of the mediocrity.</p>
<p>So this is where you and I disagree.</p>
<p>I think most, a lot of people are not capable of that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re accustomed to it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re not capable.</p>
<p>I understand your position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disagreeing with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying I do not think they&rsquo;re capable.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people effectively don&rsquo;t have souls.</p>
<p>They do not have a conscience in this sense where they&rsquo;re going to look at an issue, bring</p>
<p>their critical thinking and say, all right, I am going to do the right thing, although</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking a risk.</p>
<p>Do you think thinking is involved or is it just taking that leap?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about that basic human spirit.</p>
<p>Forget the thinking part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just saying, I&rsquo;ll take that risk, taking that adventure, the same thing that got people</p>
<p>to explore the seas throughout human civilization, explore land, explore the oceans, that exploration.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done stuff this way all this time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take a leap and that comes out of nowhere seemingly.</p>
<p>But those people are the heroes, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s universal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use a very gauche example.</p>
<p>There was a show called Scare Tactics, which was basically a candid camera, but they would</p>
<p>scare people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d have vampires, whatever, a hidden camera and people&rsquo;s reactions.</p>
<p>Sometimes the prank didn&rsquo;t work out like they expected.</p>
<p>There was one where they were hiring the people who were the marks, the contestants so to speak,</p>
<p>was hired to be a security guard.</p>
<p>You have to watch this factory overnight and you get paid.</p>
<p>But the setup was some people were breaking out of the factory in the middle of the night</p>
<p>like in rags and they were saying they were keeping us prisoner here, blah, blah, and</p>
<p>just watch the person reaction to this.</p>
<p>There was one security guard where he basically forced them back into the building and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working us 24 seven, we&rsquo;re getting beaten.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m here to do a job, get back in there.</p>
<p>You watch this and it never even enters his head to be like, something&rsquo;s wrong here.</p>
<p>He was given his orders, he&rsquo;s following his orders and to me, that is not uncommon and</p>
<p>that person, although they look like you and I, there&rsquo;s something essentially human missing</p>
<p>with them.</p>
<p>Now, very quickly, the reaction is, well, it&rsquo;s one step from there to Nazism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s something that, I&rsquo;m not saying this person should be killed, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just saying to expect that every human being has the capacity to have that defiance, especially</p>
<p>at a cost to their own life, that I think is not realistic.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I feel like an octopus on the eighth hand, it is those few of us,</p>
<p>or if you want to include me in this, who do make these tiny little protests, who look</p>
<p>the other way when someone is hungry, who&rsquo;s stealing food from the supermarket, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, I&rsquo;m going to pretend I didn&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>Those little elements of heroism are what move humanity forward and demonstrate the</p>
<p>validity of the human experience, whereas everyone else is kind of like scenery.</p>
<p>I think almost everybody in the world can derive deep meaning and pleasure from having</p>
<p>done those courageous acts, and I also think they have the capacity to do them, to discover</p>
<p>that meaning and happiness.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the cynic, then why aren&rsquo;t they doing it?</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t gotten a chance to, like I&rsquo;ve never tried LSD or DMT, you haven&rsquo;t gotten</p>
<p>the chance to try this amazing journey, which is taking the risk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nonsense, because as you just said two minutes ago, everyone has that chance</p>
<p>every day to do the right thing.</p>
<p>We have the chance to do a lot of things and we don&rsquo;t realize.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff right in front of our nose that we don&rsquo;t realize, because you have</p>
<p>to kind of wake up to it.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need the catalyst, there needs to be some kind of thing that happens that</p>
<p>wakes you up.</p>
<p>The fact that most people don&rsquo;t take the small acts of rebellion doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the capacity to both do so and to derive a lot of meaning from it.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s a discussion about how to create societies that get more and more people to</p>
<p>be free actors and free thinkers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>That probably leads us into a discussion of anarchism and so on, but I just think we are</p>
<p>very young as a species.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to get ourselves to first be collaborative, but at the same</p>
<p>time be free spirits.</p>
<p>I think both of those are within human nature for most of us.</p>
<p>I think another big concern is that there&rsquo;s enormous disincentives, and this is Michael</p>
<p>Malus speaking, for human beings to be kind and for tenderness.</p>
<p>I think, especially when you&rsquo;re young, you know what I mean, when you&rsquo;re immature, a</p>
<p>lot of times someone will reach out to you with kindness or vulnerability and you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny to kind of dunk their head in the water in a pool or something like that.</p>
<p>When you get older, there&rsquo;s this one example of this.</p>
<p>This was in the 90s, and there was a woman.</p>
<p>She became a stripper or something like that or whatever it was, but she had this amazing</p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>She was just gorgeous.</p>
<p>The show was, she was talking about how when she was in high school, she was bullied a</p>
<p>lot and that there was this football player.</p>
<p>He messed with her every single day.</p>
<p>One day, she even threw pickles in her hair and her hair smelled like pickles and it was</p>
<p>laughing at her.</p>
<p>This really screwed her up, I mean, up to that show.</p>
<p>They took her backstage and they brought out the football player, and now he&rsquo;s a dad and</p>
<p>a regular dude.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, do you know why you&rsquo;re here, and he&rsquo;s like, no, and they&rsquo;re like, oh, what</p>
<p>were you like in high school?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I was kind of a jock, bully, whatever.</p>
<p>They brought her out, and he didn&rsquo;t even remember her really, and she just starts crying about</p>
<p>the pickles and whatever, and this is something that affected her for 20 years, and I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>seen a clearer example of someone who wanted to kill themselves than this guy.</p>
<p>The guilt on his face, and he&rsquo;s looking at her, and he&rsquo;s desperate to be like, what can</p>
<p>I do to take your pain away, to make it better?</p>
<p>He was just crippled by it because he knew there&rsquo;s nothing he could do.</p>
<p>He knew he 100% did the wrong thing.</p>
<p>He knew he did the wrong thing unthinkingly.</p>
<p>You can imagine, I got to screw over this lady to feed my family, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>At the time, it meant nothing to him, so of course he didn&rsquo;t remember, and he was just</p>
<p>paralyzed by this sense of crippling guilt.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I always try to do the right thing isn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m an inherently</p>
<p>good person, which I do not think I am, I don&rsquo;t think anyone is inherently good, but</p>
<p>because I will feel guilty about it for a very, very long time because if you do the</p>
<p>wrong thing, this is a very Camus idea, if you do the wrong thing to a good person, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really, really bad because what kind of person are you?</p>
<p>In the same way that everyone can be that guy who takes someone out for their birthday,</p>
<p>everyone has that ability for someone who did the wrong thing to someone who&rsquo;s a normal</p>
<p>person and do you want to be that guy as well?</p>
<p>My friend, Bittstein, he&rsquo;s a big Bitcoin person, my biography ego in hubris is like $500 now</p>
<p>on eBay, it&rsquo;s hard to find, came out in 2006.</p>
<p>He had told me that you can get it on torrent, it&rsquo;s downloadable, and I&rsquo;m like, oh, I thought</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re my friend, you&rsquo;d want to buy it.</p>
<p>At the time, it was not $500, I assure you, and he goes, I did buy it, I&rsquo;m just telling</p>
<p>you that you could also get it for free, this information that you might want to use.</p>
<p>And I snapped at this kid who was doing right by me and I felt, it just stuck in my head,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re an ass.</p>
<p>And then years later, I apologize, he had no memory of this at all and I&rsquo;m glad to be</p>
<p>able to reiterate the apology again.</p>
<p>But a lot of times I&rsquo;m extremely aggressive on Twitter and in other venues, I always try</p>
<p>to and maybe I fail and that&rsquo;s my moral failing, always do it as a counter attack.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to start going personal, if you&rsquo;re going to start being aggressive against</p>
<p>an individual, I&rsquo;m not going to necessarily hold back when I reciprocate.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that is very common on social media, but I don&rsquo;t think it is normal.</p>
<p>Just because a lot of this, you&rsquo;re talking about the quiet little rebellion, just because</p>
<p>everyone else around you thinks it&rsquo;s okay to just go up to people and attack them in</p>
<p>the most personal ways, impromptu because of their views, really just take a step back</p>
<p>and realize what you&rsquo;re engaging with.</p>
<p>Now, if that&rsquo;s the fight they want, then my Soviet cruelty could come out and that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of why I don&rsquo;t drink because I do enjoy it, but at the same time, be aware of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>And again, this goes back to Camus&rsquo;s sense that conscience really is what makes us human</p>
<p>beings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing I was saying, I don&rsquo;t think most people think in terms of conscience.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think it, we are taught, this is that creeping cynicism that, oh, grow up.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re an adult, you have to make sacrifices, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And even if I buy that for a second, which I don&rsquo;t, but if I have to make sacrifices</p>
<p>sometimes, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s okay for me to make a sacrifice of my values in this</p>
<p>moment.</p>
<p>If I have to maybe be at work and my boss is a jerk to me and calls me names, I have</p>
<p>to be humiliated, but I got to put food on the plate.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s okay later if I&rsquo;m at a party and I&rsquo;m just extremely offensive to</p>
<p>someone for no reason.</p>
<p>My own flavor of a little bit of rebellion.</p>
<p>Sometimes I use the number two.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re very witty on Twitter and Twitter likes mockery and wit and a counter</p>
<p>attack is, Twitter loves that, somebody who&rsquo;s skilled at it.</p>
<p>My own flavor of a bit of rebellion is to say things very simply, bordering on cliche</p>
<p>with authenticity and like genuinely meaning the words I say, but knowing that those words</p>
<p>would be, are easy to attack.</p>
<p>And that sometimes those attacks can hurt because people would just mock me.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t like earnestness because they&rsquo;ve been taught to be too cool for school.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this pressure for me to be sound way more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Use bigger words, sometimes throw in a criticism of institutions or something like that, almost</p>
<p>as if I have a deep wisdom about the way the world is broken.</p>
<p>But when you speak very simply about beautiful things in life, it&rsquo;s very easy to sound like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what the hell you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And I kind of, I stick by that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where that&rsquo;s going to end up, but it&rsquo;s like the idiot from Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>It feels like that&rsquo;s the right thing, even if it hurts when I&rsquo;m attacked for it.</p>
<p>I do something similar sometimes, which is I&rsquo;ll have some innocuous comment about like</p>
<p>bubblegum.</p>
<p>I mean, just it&rsquo;s not to be in political.</p>
<p>And a lot of times people will respond to this paragraph of just invective about like</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah, and then this, and you say this, and you&rsquo;re an ass, and just really trying</p>
<p>to get at me.</p>
<p>And in those situations, there are very specific circumstances, I will respond and I mean it</p>
<p>every single time.</p>
<p>I will say, I wish your parents had been kinder to you or your mom or your dad.</p>
<p>Because even if I&rsquo;m some idiot on Twitter, who&rsquo;s just talking about bubblegum, and this</p>
<p>is your, I&rsquo;m not talking about politics where I can see how people get emotional, COVID,</p>
<p>my grandma died, now you&rsquo;re talking about her.</p>
<p>And I realize this isn&rsquo;t about me.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m someone you&rsquo;ve never met making some inane point about nothing, and you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>agitated about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clearly something else that&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>And someone taught you, someone had to teach you that this is how to respond in this kind</p>
<p>of very kind of harsh way.</p>
<p>And a lot of times they won&rsquo;t say anything or get deleted.</p>
<p>And I hope every single time, there&rsquo;s no asterisk here, that they take a second, and they realize</p>
<p>that the way that they were talked to growing up was not acceptable, that they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to carry this forward.</p>
<p>And that they don&rsquo;t have to be kind to me, I&rsquo;m nobody to them.</p>
<p>But take a second and ask if this is the kind of mindset you want to be your norm, as opposed</p>
<p>to a weapon you pull out of your pocket sometimes where it&rsquo;s warranted or even when it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>warranted.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of those people out there, and we forget how hard it is for a</p>
<p>lot of people to grow up, how they&rsquo;re trained from their parents or the single parent, that</p>
<p>the only way they&rsquo;re going to get attention is by acting out, that when they do good things,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t get comment.</p>
<p>But if they do bad things, they get a smack upside their head.</p>
<p>That I think is far more common than we realize.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not hitting the kid that&rsquo;s going to last, the pain is going to give five seconds.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re training this child, helpless child, is something that&rsquo;s really, really</p>
<p>bad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it always can be mapped to that.</p>
<p>I always wonder about them, what their motivations are.</p>
<p>And I just kind of, whenever I think about them, I think only positively.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even think about the childhood thing.</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I kind of imagine that all of us can go through that stage where we enjoy the derision of</p>
<p>others.</p>
<p>We go through stages of being&hellip;</p>
<p>I enjoy the derision of others, but it has to be, you know, Billy Eide had that quote,</p>
<p>like, I like it when people are mean to me, I stop pretending to be nice.</p>
<p>But like, what&rsquo;s the worst thing someone can say about you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, what harm are you doing?</p>
<p>Maybe your podcast is garbage and the people are, the conversations suck and the people</p>
<p>are losers.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, the main thing I would say is I&rsquo;m way more popular than I deserve to be.</p>
<p>What does deserve mean?</p>
<p>The reality is there&rsquo;s people out there that just enjoy hating on others and I don&rsquo;t fault</p>
<p>them for it.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t even think of them as haters.</p>
<p>I think of them as just people that in this particular part of their life are enjoying</p>
<p>this activity of deriding others on the internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to do with that.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to, I don&rsquo;t want to allow myself to think badly of them, I guess is</p>
<p>the thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one saying don&rsquo;t think badly of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re inherently bad people.</p>
<p>I think that their thinking is screwed and that I&rsquo;m steel mounting them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, let&rsquo;s assume everything you&rsquo;re saying about Lex is true.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for you to outdo Lex.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>No, but are you saying they should stop hating because I&rsquo;m saying like, maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just keep&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in should, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an anarchist, but I&rsquo;m saying if this is your belief about Lex, you know what it is?</p>
<p>I made this comment in my book, The New Right, when people make fun of Andy Warhol and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, oh my God, he painted a soup can and now he became a millionaire.</p>
<p>I could do this.</p>
<p>Well, why don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>So basically if I go up to you with a check and I say, I will give you a million dollars,</p>
<p>you could see the check, you got to paint a soup can, what am I waiting for?</p>
<p>So clearly there&rsquo;s a disconnect in their thinking between what they&rsquo;re perceiving and the reality.</p>
<p>Because if it was as simple or as, maybe not simple, but as possible for them as they perceive</p>
<p>it to be, why are they leaving comments instead of outdoing you?</p>
<p>How great would it be for them to have your bigger audience and drive you into the ground?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that would work because it&rsquo;s not the NBA, but&hellip;</p>
<p>No, but you want to point out, you do this too on Twitter.</p>
<p>You want to point out the hypocrisy, the fraudulence of others, right?</p>
<p>Sure, but what are you, you&rsquo;re not claiming anything other than this is, the following</p>
<p>is the conversation between me and Machique, whatever his name is, right?</p>
<p>I got the voice down, dude.</p>
<p>I got it down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been walking around my house doing my Lex impression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been leaking motor oil everywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, but yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it because I think there&rsquo;s a more general statement to</p>
<p>be made.</p>
<p>Like I see Twitter this way too.</p>
<p>When I read a tweet, I try to read it with like the best possible interpretation, meaning</p>
<p>like what is the wisdom in this tweet, right?</p>
<p>As opposed to what I think a large number of people, not a large number, but some fraction</p>
<p>try to see what is the worst possible interpretation of this tweet.</p>
<p>And they want to, they want to destroy you for that worst interpretation.</p>
<p>Like they want to, there&rsquo;s people, I&rsquo;m already aware of this with me and certainly with a</p>
<p>lot of people, they&rsquo;re waiting for me to fail.</p>
<p>They want me to be like, this guy talks about love all the time.</p>
<p>They want me to be some dark, like a Bill Cosby type character.</p>
<p>They want you to be in pain.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They want you to be in pain because they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you exactly why.</p>
<p>Because this is why I&rsquo;m so for being white pilled and being for hope.</p>
<p>Because if you are black pilled, meaning if you think it&rsquo;s pointless, we&rsquo;re all done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just wasting your breath.</p>
<p>If you have any counter examples to this thesis, if there&rsquo;s even a little bit of hope, your</p>
<p>entire hypothesis falls through, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of how like you have all these stories of people who are like painting swastikas</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t Nazis, but just to show that, oh, there&rsquo;s all this Nazism.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to kind of force the conclusion.</p>
<p>So for them, when they see you thriving, you are as a mediocre person with a crappy show,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re demonstrating that people can succeed.</p>
<p>This bothers them.</p>
<p>So you are.</p>
<p>Anyone can succeed.</p>
<p>That bothers them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So because that, why haven&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re a counter to their worldview and that is going to cause anxiety when you</p>
<p>have data that contradicts other data in your, in your worldview.</p>
<p>This is the, in your mindset, this is a big issue for them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So to anyone listening to this, they&rsquo;re annoyed by the look of my face.</p>
<p>Remember that you could probably do way better than me and you should.</p>
<p>But also what would you failing look like?</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s suppose this podcast went from whatever views you had to 100 views an episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still success.</p>
<p>You are talking to people you like, having conversations about important issues.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having a good time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re having a good time.</p>
<p>How is that a failure?</p>
<p>If I have dinner with a friend of mine, there&rsquo;s zero viewers and we enjoy that time.</p>
<p>That is the height of human success.</p>
<p>When you are sharing happiness, joy, joy over love.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between joy and love, Michael Malus?</p>
<p>Uh, I think joy is easier to attain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more common.</p>
<p>You could share it with everyone.</p>
<p>Give me an example of joy.</p>
<p>Like what was the moment of joy for you recently?</p>
<p>I could give you a great example of joy and this is part in the absurdist mindset.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I love having a bad meal at a restaurant and I&rsquo;ll give you, you can see why.</p>
<p>You go with your friend.</p>
<p>It takes you 45 minutes to get seated.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starving.</p>
<p>Waiter&rsquo;s not paying attention to you.</p>
<p>They bring your water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a hair in it.</p>
<p>They get the food wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It comes out again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ripe, but it&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>At a certain point you&rsquo;re like, okay, I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m living an anecdote.</p>
<p>This is something that you, if you were at dinner, we could talk about this for years</p>
<p>because how great is it that the worst thing that&rsquo;s happening to me is I got to wait an</p>
<p>hour for this meal that&rsquo;s going to be cooked wrong, right?</p>
<p>That to me is joy is a holding on to that idea that happiness and thriving are possible</p>
<p>even when in the moment it&rsquo;s, uh, everything&rsquo;s going the wrong way.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t every moment have the capacity to, uh, fill you with joy then?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both the shitty moments and the good moments.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But that, see, that&rsquo;s the way I usually talk about love is like, I love life.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And in that, because life can generate every, everything, the pain, the loss, but also just</p>
<p>like simple or complicated bliss, all of that, I just love all of that.</p>
<p>And that, because it fills me with a kind of, I guess, joy, but joy has a connotation</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s supposed to be somehow positive, like you&rsquo;re supposed to be smiling.</p>
<p>To me, you know, man&rsquo;s search for meaning with Viktor Frankl, you know, just it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the Holocaust, you&rsquo;re in a concentration camp, just having a little bit of food that</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t expect you will have.</p>
<p>Or even just thinking about food.</p>
<p>Or what about there&rsquo;s a kid there, you tell them a funny story and you crack them up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you take away this child&rsquo;s pain for like five minutes.</p>
<p>That is the height of joy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So to me, like all of like life is like infinitely full of possibility for joy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I mean by love, because oftentimes like romantic love is what people think about</p>
<p>when they think love.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s all like part of the same thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like love, romantic love, or love with a friend, friendship is like</p>
<p>you both notice each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like dogs, they look at each other and then they look at the thing they&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>You both notice each other and that moment of joy.</p>
<p>You share that moment of joy together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like the restaurant.</p>
<p>The restaurant.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re both almost without conspiring, notice the absurdity of how shitty this meal</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>And like that, again, that little glimmer of realization, that&rsquo;s what makes life beautiful.</p>
<p>You mentioned your grandmother in Lvov.</p>
<p>You were thinking of returning there.</p>
<p>The plans got a little bit delayed, but what are you hoping from that trip of going back</p>
<p>to Russia, going back to Ukraine?</p>
<p>What do you hope to get out of it, but what do you think you will feel?</p>
<p>A lot of things.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m going with my buddy, Chris Williamson.</p>
<p>He hosts the Modern Wisdom Podcast.</p>
<p>He is one of my closest friends.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never met.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never met.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in Britain.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to get his ass over here to Austin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s filling out his form right now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s too good looking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crime.</p>
<p>I call him Apollo and I&rsquo;m Loki.</p>
<p>So right away you have a buddy comedy because we&rsquo;re going to film it, right?</p>
<p>You have these two guys who on paper are very dissimilar, but we&rsquo;re very, very close.</p>
<p>In which way are you similar and close?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re both very intense people, very strong emotionally.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both very ambitious in the sense that, not in terms of career, but we want to grab</p>
<p>life by the short hairs kind of thing.</p>
<p>We are just both good experiences.</p>
<p>Did he bench more than you or like in the gym?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>The guy&rsquo;s jacked.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s so good looking.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;d be one of those guys who&rsquo;s mostly biceps.</p>
<p>Oh no, no, no.</p>
<p>If you go to his Instagram, Chris Will X is the handle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s head to toe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sculpted.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s perfect in every way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>He&hellip;</p>
<p>What flaws does he have?</p>
<p>Because I need&hellip;</p>
<p>He has bad taste in friends and his accent is all crazy.</p>
<p>He pronounces it&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an underwear muddle, so now I spell it M U D L.</p>
<p>Just us two, British and American, and just two different dudes, it&rsquo;s going to be a lot</p>
<p>of fun.</p>
<p>Although, to be fair, as you know, I&rsquo;m an underwear model now as well, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk that in a second, maybe, but yeah, sheathunderwear.com.</p>
<p>Yeah, this episode is brought to you by Sheath Underwear.</p>
<p>Are we going to get some pictures eventually?</p>
<p>I think we might.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, I have them on my phone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have them.</p>
<p>We could share them right&hellip;</p>
<p>You could slice it in right here.</p>
<p>So to be able to go with someone who is a very close&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, we meet and talk like every day, right?</p>
<p>So to someone who generally cares about you, who&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very, very grounded, right?</p>
<p>So like a lot of times I&rsquo;ll have like some concern and he&rsquo;s really good, and if you listen</p>
<p>to his show, at slicing through the noise and being like, hold on a second, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do the accent yet.</p>
<p>Have you considered A, B, and C because, you know, whenever I had this situation, this</p>
<p>is what I did.</p>
<p>He was really good with that.</p>
<p>So to have a&hellip;</p>
<p>First of all, just like two buddies on a trip is really a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Second of all, I know that it&rsquo;s going to be very intense.</p>
<p>So for you, you left Russia much later than I did.</p>
<p>How old were you?</p>
<p>Thirteen.</p>
<p>Thirteen, right.</p>
<p>So you remember it, I&rsquo;m sure, very, very well.</p>
<p>I left when I was one and a half too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember it all.</p>
<p>To go to the streets where, you know, my family had to go through this stuff to see the&hellip;</p>
<p>They came to Lviv, they slaughtered all the Jews.</p>
<p>I mean, to have that little memorial there that&rsquo;s there now, and to just look around</p>
<p>and know, yesterday, basically, they came here, they rounded everyone up.</p>
<p>And also, from the other side, you had the Stalinists coming in and starving all the</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to know that so much horror and death.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this quote I saw once about a woman who went to Auschwitz and she just made the</p>
<p>comment like, grass grows here.</p>
<p>Because we think, you know, that when it comes to the nature of evil, that you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>go there, there&rsquo;s going to be this pits of hell or whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s birds, you know, there&rsquo;s, you know, robins hopping around looking for the worms</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s perfectly nice and you stand there to understand that so much suffering</p>
<p>happened here or there is going to be very jarring.</p>
<p>I know that it&rsquo;s going to be an issue because I speak Russian and not Ukrainian.</p>
<p>And to speak Russian to Ukrainians is like a big deal.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to be a concern.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also worried about going to Russia because every Russian has this idea that even though</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve just met you, they feel that they&rsquo;re in a position to tell you what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>wrong with your life, what you should be doing, if they&rsquo;re a cab driver, I have no tolerance</p>
<p>for unsolicited advice on it based at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be horrible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be telling me I need to speak Russian better because —Ç—ã –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—à—å –ø–æ</p>
<p>—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏ –∫–∞–∫ –¥–∞—É–Ω—á–∏–∫.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hearing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in hearing it.</p>
<p>So that I think, and also, you know, given my upcoming book, The White Pill and covering</p>
<p>what happened back in the day under Stalinism and later to see this was the Ljubljanka,</p>
<p>this was the basement where they would, you know, this is something that people might</p>
<p>not realize.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a superb film, The Death of Stalin, which is kind of, that&rsquo;s what I do with North</p>
<p>Korea, you know, puts a humorous spin on it.</p>
<p>Then when you take a step back and you realize what they&rsquo;re actually saying, it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, very disturbing how when Stalin was dying, he had a stroke, he&rsquo;s laying there</p>
<p>in a pile of his own piss, he&rsquo;s unconscious.</p>
<p>Right before he died, he thought the doctors were all plotting against him.</p>
<p>So they were being tortured to confess that they were trying to murder him.</p>
<p>They had to get the doctors out of the torture chambers to attend to him and they did it.</p>
<p>So this kind of thing to like go there, like Red Square and see this is where it happened,</p>
<p>to see Lenin&rsquo;s body, like this is the guy who Emma Goldman yelled at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be really, because I&rsquo;ve worked so much in this space, jarring and intense</p>
<p>and emotional.</p>
<p>And as intense as it is for me sitting here talking to you about it, to see it and to</p>
<p>see the faces and to see Cyrillic everywhere, you know, other than Brighton Beach in Brooklyn,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s going to do a huge number on me because as Western and as</p>
<p>a Tupoi Mirikanyets as the Russians will say I am, this is still where I came from.</p>
<p>So no matter, to see it face to face, I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to react, but I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be like, meh.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve assembled a number of essays from anarchist thinkers in a new book called The Anarchist</p>
<p>Handbook.</p>
<p>You mentioned Emma Goldman.</p>
<p>What interesting things do these thinkers agree on and what do they disagree on?</p>
<p>The Anarchist Handbook.com is the website.</p>
<p>It covers from the 1790s to, I think my essay is the last one from 2014, which a friend</p>
<p>of mine who&rsquo;s kind of a mediocre scientist is going to be reading for the audio book.</p>
<p>Also podcast.</p>
<p>Podcast.</p>
<p>I never had, but it&rsquo;s not a podcast anyone would have heard of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Tom Woods but even worse.</p>
<p>So what they all agreed on was the illegitimacy of government and also the malevolence of</p>
<p>state actors and the consequences of governments.</p>
<p>So they range in terms that most people would easily regard as either left or right wing.</p>
<p>But it tackles the nature of government and also creates positive non state alternatives</p>
<p>from really many different angles.</p>
<p>The slogan I have is the black flag, which is the traditional flag of anarchism.</p>
<p>The black flag comes in many colors.</p>
<p>So they were really all over the map in terms of what they&rsquo;re for, but their disagreement</p>
<p>is about the nature of state and the nature of power.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very edifying because this is an ideology that&rsquo;s been in many ways swept under</p>
<p>the rug.</p>
<p>I want to seriously grow up that I can allow people to sit down and read these essays and</p>
<p>see for themselves just how beautiful this tapestry over the decades and centuries has</p>
<p>been woven about people who genuinely believed in freedom as the most important and how to</p>
<p>maximize that for society.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s useful to talk about a few contrasting thinkers in there.</p>
<p>So one is Leo Tolstoy.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Who I think not many people know is an anarchist.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A Christian anarchist.</p>
<p>An anarchist.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he came to despise government for his deceit and his violence.</p>
<p>But to him, the Christian principles of nonviolence, I think are important.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of pacifist kind of mindset of, you know, it&rsquo;s better to someone to punch</p>
<p>you than to punch them back.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s in that way, at least I&rsquo;ve read he influenced MLK and Gandhi.</p>
<p>What do you think about this flavor, color of the anarchist flag of nonviolence, nonviolent</p>
<p>opposition?</p>
<p>I will put the caveat that it bothers me when people bring up MLK because he&rsquo;s become so</p>
<p>corporate and everyone just brings him up without knowing about him.</p>
<p>One of the things that Martin Luther King did so very well was that he forced people</p>
<p>to face the consequences of what they were putting forward.</p>
<p>You want to be racist.</p>
<p>You want to be for Jim Crow.</p>
<p>You want to be for segregation.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for you to do that from your living room.</p>
<p>Now turn on your news and you see men and women in suits being attacked by dogs, being</p>
<p>attacked by fire hoses and beaten by cops just so they could sit on the front of the</p>
<p>bus.</p>
<p>And now for a lot of people who were still racist, who were still had animus toward black</p>
<p>people are watching this and it&rsquo;s going to be a lot harder to be like, I&rsquo;m okay with</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay with human beings, even ones I regard as somehow bad or inferior to be beaten and</p>
<p>attacked by trained dogs and they&rsquo;re not doing anything in response.</p>
<p>That strikes to, I think, a very basic nature of, especially American, like, okay, whatever</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re for, I&rsquo;m not for people getting beaten and attacked when they&rsquo;re not really doing</p>
<p>anything.</p>
<p>I think pacifism is something that&rsquo;s very easy to make fun of, but people don&rsquo;t underestimate</p>
<p>how powerful it is for someone to say, you can do what you want to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to fight you back.</p>
<p>I just want to live peacefully and have the same rights as you.</p>
<p>And to say, screw you, you should get beaten.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard pill for a lot of people to swallow.</p>
<p>So I think he was really, and Gandhi, of course, as well, were excellent in that regard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of Machiavellianism to it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve both been beatified in regard to saints, but their strategy worked very, very well</p>
<p>for their purposes.</p>
<p>So I think just all of us, when you see someone in this kind of Christian, I know you&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>obviously, it&rsquo;s nothing very highly Christianity, but if he&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s willing to take</p>
<p>a punch and to say, you could do whatever you want to me, I&rsquo;m not going to hurt somebody</p>
<p>else instinctively, and maybe this is kind of a hack.</p>
<p>Most people want to side with that guy, step in between and be like, oh, okay, let&rsquo;s take</p>
<p>a step back, because whatever led to this is not tenable.</p>
<p>We need to go back to the drawing board if the consequence is people are having these</p>
<p>as a result of my decisions and actions.</p>
<p>So I think that aspect of anarchism is very, very, in certain contexts, healthy, and much</p>
<p>smarter and more sophisticated than people give it credit for.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s also point out that Tolstoy wrote War and Peace, and he wrote Anna Karenina.</p>
<p>So this was not some naive or innocent, whatever word you want to use.</p>
<p>He knew the nature of evil.</p>
<p>He knew how bad things get.</p>
<p>So he wasn&rsquo;t saying at all that human beings are inherently nice and kind.</p>
<p>He was saying it&rsquo;s much more effective to not fight back and to force them to face that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you another example.</p>
<p>I was on the show Trigonometry, and I was talking to the host, and one of them talked</p>
<p>about how someone he knew had been the Gulag, or his mom was born the Gulag grandma.</p>
<p>And after Stalin died and the Soviet Union liberalized and lots of the people in the</p>
<p>Gulags were freed by Khrushchev and so on and so forth, I didn&rsquo;t know this, many of</p>
<p>the, or some, let&rsquo;s say some, of the guards of the Gulags killed themselves because they</p>
<p>had genuinely believed that everyone in these camps was there for a reason.</p>
<p>And when they found out that these people were completely innocent, didn&rsquo;t even have</p>
<p>trials, and that they were the ones forcing them to work themselves to death and starve,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t deal with that guilt.</p>
<p>So when you are a pacifist or non retaliatory and you&rsquo;re forcing someone who&rsquo;s using force,</p>
<p>like look what you&rsquo;re doing, look what you&rsquo;ve become.</p>
<p>For some people, some people don&rsquo;t care, like the guy in Scare Tactics, like I mentioned</p>
<p>earlier, where for a lot of others, they&rsquo;re going to be like, okay, is this who I wanted</p>
<p>to grow up to be?</p>
<p>They will have that little flame of conscience that you and I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>They will be like, how did I get to the point where there&rsquo;s this lady who wants to ride</p>
<p>the bus and she&rsquo;s lovely dressed, put together, and I have a, sending a dog on her?</p>
<p>What kind of person am I?</p>
<p>For some of those people, they&rsquo;re going to be like, okay, I can&rsquo;t be a part of this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even understand the politics.</p>
<p>I still am racist, but I&rsquo;m not going to take part in this atrocity.</p>
<p>Well, that was for him from the individual perspective, perhaps he calls that Christian,</p>
<p>but listening to that voice of conscience, like whatever that is in you.</p>
<p>So for Tolstoy, it seems like anarchism from the individual perspective is silencing the</p>
<p>rest of the world and listening to the, for him, probably God given voice of conscience.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what it means to live, embody anarchism for him.</p>
<p>And to embody Christianity, I would think he would say.</p>
<p>But he would see those as basic.</p>
<p>Yes, correct.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in terms of forms of government, the Christian government is one that&rsquo;s no government.</p>
<p>Yeah, correct.</p>
<p>What do you think about that as advice for an individual?</p>
<p>Turn the other cheek.</p>
<p>Do you think, I tend to believe that that&rsquo;s a really good way to live.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very underrated.</p>
<p>And this is me talking.</p>
<p>I think a lot of times when someone, let&rsquo;s suppose you&rsquo;re having an argument and, but</p>
<p>you have to pick your battles, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose you&rsquo;re having a heated argument and someone says something very cruel to you,</p>
<p>where you have attempted to double down and hit back twice as hard.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s someone who at all cares about you, where they&rsquo;re just in the moment and</p>
<p>you just stop and you just say, did you hear what you just said to me?</p>
<p>For some cases, that person will take a step back and be like, just like when I snapped</p>
<p>at Michael at Bitstein years ago, I&rsquo;d be like, wow, okay, this is bad.</p>
<p>This is bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>And they kind of, it&rsquo;s kind of like they have to get to 10 before they control delete to</p>
<p>use your language.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Buffer overflow.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>And for some, they&rsquo;re going to, they&rsquo;re going to just twist the knife.</p>
<p>But I think this is a very useful technique.</p>
<p>And also you can also sleep well at night cause you could be like as much as this person</p>
<p>tried to hurt me, I still didn&rsquo;t reciprocate.</p>
<p>And yeah, I, I took that punch and it sucks, but at least I never said anything that I</p>
<p>could feel guilty about.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s ultimately a good way to implement anarchy in your personal life?</p>
<p>Anarchy, implementing anarchy in your personal life just means respecting people&rsquo;s boundaries.</p>
<p>It means not forcing people to do things they otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>I think you then have to take a case by case, like there&rsquo;s so many human interactions that</p>
<p>are required for life and there&rsquo;s tension and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always.</p>
<p>Am I being naive?</p>
<p>Are you innocent?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being so naive.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Did you put the hat on?</p>
<p>The hat&rsquo;s on the other head now.</p>
<p>Well, I had to take off the hat cause it&rsquo;s like Frodo with the ring.</p>
<p>I was starting to feel like powerful.</p>
<p>I wanted to give you orders and I&rsquo;m like, no, I just, I think there&rsquo;s a ways of dealing</p>
<p>with the tensions that are natural to human interactions that can&rsquo;t be simply, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as simple as saying you want to respect the freedom of others and the boundaries of</p>
<p>others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you both have to agree on stuff and work something out.</p>
<p>And the mechanisms of that agreement, the game theory of that agreement requires different</p>
<p>hacks and strategies.</p>
<p>And the question is for an anarchist collective that&rsquo;s well functioning, what kind of hacks,</p>
<p>what kind of ways of behavior are more likely to be productive and not, you know, that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost like the question, do you want to turn the other cheek or do you want to stand your</p>
<p>ground really firmly?</p>
<p>When somebody is an asshole to you, you walk away.</p>
<p>Or when somebody is an asshole to you, you turn the other cheek and give them a chance</p>
<p>to rise to the best version of themselves and then find a common ground kind of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an open question of how to form those collectives when there&rsquo;s people with difficult</p>
<p>childhoods and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, this also comes down to what is your relationship with this person?</p>
<p>Is this out of character?</p>
<p>If you and I got into a disagreement, all of a sudden, you started getting very personal.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;d be very hurt.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;d be like, this is out of character for Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I could be like, whoa, let&rsquo;s take a pause here.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re getting heated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to work this out.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>And you get a kind of a meta conversation.</p>
<p>But again, you and I have a relationship of mutual respect.</p>
<p>So as opposed to if it was a stranger who just wants a piece of you, it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>you are coming at me not correct.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to reciprocate in kind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to shoot you, but I&rsquo;m not going to pretend that you deserve respect when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>treating me with such contempt.</p>
<p>I do defer, especially with people I know, because this is smart long term game theory</p>
<p>as well as the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I do try to give them the benefit of the doubt at first, right?</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re going to go aggro, you can&rsquo;t go back.</p>
<p>You could always go from like, let me hear them out and then then I could go aggro.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a big asymmetry there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think anyone has the answer to this question is, is that the</p>
<p>right strategy?</p>
<p>To me, game theoretically, it seems the right strategy is to&hellip;</p>
<p>With reciprocity is what game theory says is the right strategy.</p>
<p>They did the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma and they found tit for tat is the one that&rsquo;s the most advantageous.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for when it&rsquo;s perfectly rational actors.</p>
<p>But when you have, I mean, there&rsquo;s noise that there&rsquo;s a, I think, benefit to just, even</p>
<p>if they keep being shitty to you, still being nice to them.</p>
<p>Well then there&rsquo;s the inverse where girls are turned off.</p>
<p>Some people are like, if you&rsquo;re in a relationship and not just girls, but like some people,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re kind to them, they find you less attractive, right?</p>
<p>That is kind of this weird, what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re only into me if I&rsquo;m mean to you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be mean, but then I&rsquo;m getting punished for doing the right thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another tricky one.</p>
<p>And I mean, this is nothing that necessarily do with anarchism so much as like, you know,</p>
<p>human beings are infinitely complex.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t often know the backstory.</p>
<p>Like for example, just yesterday, Jay, who&rsquo;s here is one of my closest friends.</p>
<p>I had a dinner with a bunch of people.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t bring a plus four, so he wasn&rsquo;t invited.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know the circumstances.</p>
<p>He just thought we were having dinner without him.</p>
<p>He was hurt.</p>
<p>Once I spelled it out, he completely understood and I felt horrible because for me to have</p>
<p>any of my friends feel left out is just a very, very cruel thing.</p>
<p>And I felt bad and I&rsquo;m glad to apologize again publicly that that&rsquo;s ended up being the circumstances.</p>
<p>But yeah, a lot of times we&rsquo;re also in Plato&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re dealing with somebody else, you have very, very limited information about</p>
<p>their background and circumstances.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I will always, if it&rsquo;s someone I even have a little bit of a relationship</p>
<p>with, try to give them the benefit of the doubt because I found, especially this comes</p>
<p>from being a coauthor, when you coauthor books and you&rsquo;re walking in other people&rsquo;s shoes,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know a lot of the information.</p>
<p>So a lot of times it&rsquo;s just a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that a fundamentally anarchist question of how we figure out this puzzle</p>
<p>of human complexities in order to form voluntary collectives?</p>
<p>Like when you have to figure that out, how to make people feel good, how to make people&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>I think not only anarchists have to think about this as my point, of course.</p>
<p>Well&hellip;</p>
<p>But we have to think about it more than others do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I feel like I should try to argue against anarchism at some point, out of love, out</p>
<p>of love.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so because people&hellip;</p>
<p>Out of joy.</p>
<p>People enjoy seeing me, what is it, when like Ben Shapiro argues against like a 20 year</p>
<p>old feminist.</p>
<p>Ben Shapiro destroys high school students with facts and legends.</p>
<p>This is this video of Michael Miles destroys a Marxist, Russian, communist pig.</p>
<p>So anarchism is opposed to hierarchies.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s left anarchism, anarcho communism, yeah.</p>
<p>The state.</p>
<p>But there are many hierarchies that are not the state.</p>
<p>We have a hierarchy here.</p>
<p>This is your show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m differential to you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Rigid hierarchies.</p>
<p>Forced hierarchies is the&hellip;</p>
<p>Forced hierarchies.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So humans, when left on their own accord, they form hierarchies naturally.</p>
<p>Yes, inevitably in my opinion.</p>
<p>Inevitably.</p>
<p>Which is why I disagree with the left anarchists.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not a coherent thing to argue for nonhierarchical relationships, even in</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>And I know the old school anarchists will call me stupid or uninformed, but I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>been able to even wrap my head around this claim that you could have relationships without</p>
<p>hierarchy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So this is a certain sense in which we&rsquo;re living in an anarchism now.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean just like, because the nations, as you&rsquo;ve said, are in anarchism relative</p>
<p>to each other, but isn&rsquo;t the United States just a collective that was formed in anarchy?</p>
<p>And this is just the collective that we&rsquo;re operating under, this hierarchy that was naturally</p>
<p>formed.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, the United States was not naturally formed.</p>
<p>It was formed by force and by fiat.</p>
<p>But to your point, I stress this throughout the book.</p>
<p>I always say this anarchism is not a location, it&rsquo;s a relationship.</p>
<p>So yeah, you and I do have a hierarchy and this is your show, but neither of us really</p>
<p>has an authority over the other.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m here voluntarily.</p>
<p>You can kick me out if you want.</p>
<p>I can leave it anyone.</p>
<p>Neither of us has the power to force the other to be in this relationship we&rsquo;ve chosen.</p>
<p>My lawyer, I defer to his judgment.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not forcing me to do it.</p>
<p>He gives me his advice and I could take it or leave it.</p>
<p>Same with the doctor.</p>
<p>So there is a clearly like who&rsquo;s in charge and who&rsquo;s not in charge, but they&rsquo;re not in</p>
<p>a position to impose their will on everybody else.</p>
<p>And you could very easily see John is Stephanie&rsquo;s lawyer and Stephanie is John&rsquo;s doctor.</p>
<p>And in each of those contexts, one has this position of ostensible authority over the</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>So anarchism is in fact not some utopian crazy thing.</p>
<p>It is the norm of human relationships where you meet people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not necessarily equal.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s going to be taller, someone&rsquo;s going to be stronger, someone&rsquo;s smarter, wealthier</p>
<p>with others.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not at all thinking I am here and I could tell you what to do and you are legally</p>
<p>or morally obligated to follow my wishes.</p>
<p>That is the basis of anarchism.</p>
<p>So in what way is the United States imposing by force something on you, do you think?</p>
<p>If you leave your house, you will go to jail.</p>
<p>My money being taken from me via taxation.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you have the freedom to not operate under that?</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s like, yeah, like technically if someone comes up to you and mugs you and</p>
<p>says your money or your life, you are making a choice.</p>
<p>But what the anarchist argument is, they&rsquo;re not in a position to force you to make that</p>
<p>choice.</p>
<p>That is not morally binding, even though they have practically the power to force you into</p>
<p>that dilemma.</p>
<p>But you have the freedom to live under the United States or not.</p>
<p>So even&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, the argument is if you don&rsquo;t like it, leave, right?</p>
<p>Not necessarily leave like geographically, but there&rsquo;s ways to live outside the force</p>
<p>of the United States.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ways, it&rsquo;s just very difficult to operate that way.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like saying you could outrun the mugger, which is true, but the issue is does</p>
<p>that mugger have the right to tell you at gunpoint, you&rsquo;re either giving me your money</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to shoot you or secret plan C, you get to run away.</p>
<p>Is that person a moral actor?</p>
<p>And the anarchist answer is never.</p>
<p>And just one more thing, the anarchist view is the difference between that mugger and</p>
<p>the government is only an air of legitimacy.</p>
<p>Literally they&rsquo;re morally identical.</p>
<p>So is it possible that every hierarchy that gets big enough and successful enough such</p>
<p>that it can monopolize a bunch of services it provides, isn&rsquo;t it always going to be amoral</p>
<p>in your sense, the way the United States government is amoral?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say just like the United States government is amoral because that implies</p>
<p>the United States government is uniquely or especially amoral.</p>
<p>Governments, I apologize.</p>
<p>I just want to clarify that because I know you didn&rsquo;t mean that and I don&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>to be the implication.</p>
<p>Can you repeat the question?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>So like won&rsquo;t every Okay, so that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s progressive economics.</p>
<p>So the argument is in any market at a certain point, things tend to centralize and then</p>
<p>that organization de facto can dictate price, can dictate so on and so forth.</p>
<p>That is completely historical.</p>
<p>If you look at any market, the trend is always towards decentralization, the music industry,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>When we were kids, there were four or five record labels.</p>
<p>They were the ones who made all the songs that you&rsquo;re going to see in the Billboard</p>
<p>Top 100 with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>Now anyone can go to direct to market.</p>
<p>If you look at TV stations, right, it went from CBS, NBC, ABC, then you got Fox, then</p>
<p>you had cable, which is 100.</p>
<p>Now you have satellite, which have sounds around the world and you have YouTube, which</p>
<p>is literally infinite.</p>
<p>So as technology improves and as wealth increases, which is a function of free enterprise, you</p>
<p>are going to always have more and more choice, even within a monopoly, Coca Cola, right?</p>
<p>This is an example I used, I think in the new right, when we were kids, every terrible</p>
<p>comedian would be like, oh, now that I&rsquo;ve got diet caffeine free Coke, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>You want to have, what was his name, Cayman, the guy who invented the Segway.</p>
<p>If you go, Dean Cayman, if you go into some restaurants right now, you will have those</p>
<p>machines.</p>
<p>You have like 80 kinds of Cokes and then you could have whatever flavor you want to add</p>
<p>to it.</p>
<p>Grape, cherry, lemon, lime, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So in any field, you&rsquo;re going to have more and more competition.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have less competition and less choices when the state gets involved</p>
<p>because the state wants control.</p>
<p>The state wants one big neck with one leash around it and that way it could just pull</p>
<p>that dog in one direction or another.</p>
<p>And you saw this last year with the lockdowns, Carol Roth wrote this amazing book called</p>
<p>The War on Small Business and she talked about, we have seen for the first time in history</p>
<p>a massive wealth transfer from small and medium business towards organizations like Target</p>
<p>and Amazon who made trillions of dollars last year.</p>
<p>Whereas mom and pop, which to me at least is like the acme of American achievement.</p>
<p>You come to America, you have a fruit stand, a laundromat, you make socks, whatever it</p>
<p>is, you&rsquo;re that unique artisan creating something special.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who didn&rsquo;t last whereas Target and Amazon did.</p>
<p>So when you have the state involvement, it will always be in favor of Jeff Bezos and</p>
<p>for the simple reason that it&rsquo;s going to be a lot easier for Jeff Bezos to get Nancy Pelosi</p>
<p>and Mitch McConnell on the phone than it is for me making socks on Etsy.</p>
<p>Your sense is that there&rsquo;ll be less and less over time Jeff Bezos is like whatever industry</p>
<p>we look at, there&rsquo;s be less, there&rsquo;s a trend towards decentralization across all industries.</p>
<p>And when I say decentralization, I just mean choice, right?</p>
<p>So if you look at again, networks, you&rsquo;re going to, if you were in the 80s and you had</p>
<p>a network just for LGBT issues, first of all, it&rsquo;s going to be complete heretical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to happen and there&rsquo;s not going to be enough necessarily people identifies</p>
<p>that to have an audience.</p>
<p>Then there was something called logo.</p>
<p>They have that and there&rsquo;s lots of other shows like that in this way.</p>
<p>So more specific, look at websites.</p>
<p>I am positive that you and I, if we wanted to look up breeding guinea pigs, would find</p>
<p>thousands of websites about different breeds and all this other stuff 20 years ago, 30</p>
<p>years ago, like you&rsquo;re going to have two books and they&rsquo;re not going to be dynamic as these</p>
<p>new breeds are developed.</p>
<p>So at the same time it does, following on your argument, it does seem easier to move</p>
<p>and immigrate from state to state within the United States and to other countries.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a form of freedom that embodies anarchism where you can resist the</p>
<p>force of state by choosing where you live?</p>
<p>To some extent, but the line of people, some of these boomers will go at me on Twitter</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m going after the police or something and be like, if you don&rsquo;t like America, get</p>
<p>out of here.</p>
<p>And I tell them freedom means I do what I want, not what you want.</p>
<p>Freedom means I don&rsquo;t have to move.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to move.</p>
<p>Free speech is a good example.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to be on Twitter, right?</p>
<p>Twitter has the right to ban me.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is I&rsquo;m saying something and you don&rsquo;t like it, too bad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one who has to accommodate me because I have a right to do what I want with my person</p>
<p>as long as I&rsquo;m being peaceful.</p>
<p>So I guess I&rsquo;m trying to get to the difference between the state and what you would naturally</p>
<p>want in anarchy, which is like a security company, all of those things.</p>
<p>They will, as they become successful, start looking more and more like the state.</p>
<p>Because you get to elect, you give them money, they have leaders.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a government and a very successful service provider in</p>
<p>anarchism?</p>
<p>Well, this gets a little confused in America as big companies necessarily are hand in hand</p>
<p>with the government ended up in bed with them.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is a long, complicated one.</p>
<p>And thankfully, it&rsquo;s all in the Anarchist Handbook.</p>
<p>There was an essay by Murray Rothbard who Dave Smith, this is the essay that converted</p>
<p>Dave Smith.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s not as good as it could have been otherwise called Anatomy of the State.</p>
<p>And Murray Rothbard points out that state is the only agency in a country which gets</p>
<p>its goods through force.</p>
<p>The state is the only agency that is not a producer, but inherently a parasite because</p>
<p>it does not get its money voluntarily, but through taxation and by imposing its values</p>
<p>on a country.</p>
<p>That is what makes a state uniquely different from, let&rsquo;s suppose, an Amazon or a Barnes</p>
<p>and Noble or a Target.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos does not have the authority or the moral legitimacy to get an army and go</p>
<p>into somebody&rsquo;s house, whereas Andrew Cuomo or Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump and Barack Obama</p>
<p>certainly do.</p>
<p>But is it possible that to reframe, so Jeff Bezos does if he hires a security force, also</p>
<p>is it possible to reframe taxation as a form of payment?</p>
<p>If it was done much better, if you could pay this collective that we call government in</p>
<p>ways where you could pay for things that you care for, your money would be much more directly</p>
<p>contributing to the things you care for.</p>
<p>If you care for a service like healthcare, you&rsquo;ll be able to buy essentially insurance</p>
<p>from the government.</p>
<p>Why am I buying insurance from the government as opposed to insurance from an insurance</p>
<p>company?</p>
<p>What do you perceive as the difference between a tax and a price?</p>
<p>Do you see the difference?</p>
<p>Yes, I know on the surface level, I&rsquo;m trying to get deeply to say there&rsquo;s a lot of similarities.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is there&rsquo;s one essential difference, which is taxes are imposed on</p>
<p>you and you have no choice.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>My book, Ego and Hubris, my biography, it goes for $500 on eBay.</p>
<p>Someone paid for it.</p>
<p>Some crazy person.</p>
<p>People were showing me that it&rsquo;s on Amazon for $3,000, something like that.</p>
<p>You could put a million for it.</p>
<p>You could charge whatever price you want.</p>
<p>The question is, is someone paying that $3,000 for it?</p>
<p>Is someone paying that million for it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the buyer who establishes the price because the seller can put any price</p>
<p>that he wants, $80 trillion.</p>
<p>But unless someone&rsquo;s paying that amount and clearing the market, that price has literally</p>
<p>no real meaning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an indicator of value or worth or market price.</p>
<p>Taxation, on the other hand, is by fiat.</p>
<p>I can decide it&rsquo;s fair that you, Lex, have to pay 40% and Joe has to pay 45%.</p>
<p>Joe and Lex are in no position to be like, this price is too high.</p>
<p>Not only is that money set just completely out of their hands, for people who are employees,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s taken out of their paychecks before they even see it.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t even have the choice to be like, you know what?</p>
<p>I agree that the government has the right to pay taxation.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my check for 40%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely different paradigm than you are when you&rsquo;re paying for price.</p>
<p>The government provides a lot of services in the current system.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no service the government provides that would not be provided better, more efficiently,</p>
<p>and with more choices in a market.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hypothesis.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s very likely.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not a&hellip;</p>
<p>I can demonstrate this to you very easily.</p>
<p>I love it when you get flustered.</p>
<p>This is what people like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cute.</p>
<p>The robot&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make me put on the hat again.</p>
<p>The robot has a fire.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s smoke coming out of his ears.</p>
<p>What is price?</p>
<p>I will tax love.</p>
<p>I think of the government as a kind of subscription service.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the anarchist view.</p>
<p>The anarchist view of private security would be a subscription service.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s exactly correct.</p>
<p>But everyone hates when you sign up to a gym, and then you realize in the contract, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very difficult to cancel that membership, and then they up the price.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of unpleasant things with a subscription service that then you can elect</p>
<p>to go to another subscription service.</p>
<p>Or you could go and Yelp and complain, and if there&rsquo;s enough people to do that, the gym</p>
<p>will be receptive.</p>
<p>Look at the power of Yelp versus the power of the vote.</p>
<p>Well, we could talk about that too.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying Yelp is more effective than voting.</p>
<p>The thing is, I agree with you, but you take a further step.</p>
<p>You say that Yelp is ethical and moral, and voting is amoral.</p>
<p>Or like not voting, but government is amoral.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s not only is one more efficient than the other, you&rsquo;re saying like, because</p>
<p>I would say government sucks at doing what it does, and it&rsquo;s gotten a lot better at it,</p>
<p>and I believe it can keep getting better as it gets smaller and it leverages companies</p>
<p>more and more.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying, no, no, no, government is fundamentally as an idea gets in the way</p>
<p>of companies that should be doing those things anyway.</p>
<p>I just think that companies, when you take away government, will start looking like government.</p>
<p>Just because something looks like something does not mean it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>If someone puts out a yarmulke and tefillin and they go to shul, they&rsquo;re not Jewish.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The basic objection you have with government, because you can leave, like I apologize that</p>
<p>this is that stupid Twitter cliche statement.</p>
<p>But your opposition to this idea of leaving the United States is that it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much friction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the option.</p>
<p>The opposition is in the introduction to the book, I say anarchism can be summed up in</p>
<p>one sentence.</p>
<p>You do not speak for me.</p>
<p>Everything else is application.</p>
<p>So the claim that somebody I&rsquo;ve never met or who I voted against, let&rsquo;s say, I hate</p>
<p>Donald Trump, I despise him, I want Hillary Clinton to be president.</p>
<p>Too bad Trump&rsquo;s your president, that&rsquo;s not what I want.</p>
<p>The idea that this person can come on me and make any claims onto one second of my time,</p>
<p>as opposed to try to persuade me, that is something that I, an anarchist, regard as</p>
<p>inherently evil and nonsensical.</p>
<p>But to operate large organizations, like you see this with cryptocurrency, there&rsquo;s governance,</p>
<p>you have to make difficult decisions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a block size wars for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So you will, there is a voting mechanism often with membership when you&rsquo;re a subscription</p>
<p>service.</p>
<p>But see, the thing is, you&rsquo;re using these words and you&rsquo;re switching definitions.</p>
<p>Because like, if I go to a store, I can technically say I&rsquo;m voting for Tropicana orange juice</p>
<p>as opposed to another one.</p>
<p>But to kind of say, oh, well, you&rsquo;re making a choice there for every choice is a vote.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I think that that&rsquo;s something that the Venn diagram is not.</p>
<p>No, I literally mean vote in this case, not money.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some decisions, like, should Bitcoin have increases block size?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different, they&rsquo;re called soft forks or hard forks.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m not saying you should never vote, like stockholders have to vote, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no pretense.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s look at this.</p>
<p>If you want to build robots, right?</p>
<p>You would sit down with the company, you would, you guys would be like, we should do this</p>
<p>kind of robot, we should do this kind of robot.</p>
<p>The stockholders would have a vote or the board in proportion to their investment in</p>
<p>the firm.</p>
<p>Me, who knows nothing about robots, the idea that I&rsquo;m in a position to walk in and be like,</p>
<p>this is what you should do is crazy and bizarre and wrong because I&rsquo;m not in a foreign position.</p>
<p>So what democracy does is it forces people who run businesses well to run businesses</p>
<p>poorly by people who don&rsquo;t know how to run businesses at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s one of the many concerns.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s the fundamental property of the state.</p>
<p>I have a sense that the state could become as effective as what we think of as companies.</p>
<p>I mean, as.</p>
<p>This is why they can&rsquo;t, because the state does not have access to data the way that</p>
<p>firms do.</p>
<p>And this is one of Ludwig von Mises&rsquo;s great points, what he called the calculation problem.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m looking at comic books, right, and I have Detective Comics, if Detective Comics</p>
<p>26 is a thousand and Detective Comics 28 is a thousand and Detective Comics 27 is 50,000,</p>
<p>that is telling me that even if I don&rsquo;t know anything about comics, that Detective Comics</p>
<p>27 is either very, very scarce for some reason or very, very desirable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first appearance of Batman, whatever, but you don&rsquo;t need to know that to just look</p>
<p>at this data and be like, okay, this is the market, tell me something.</p>
<p>If prices are set by the government, which the government is a monopoly, I have no way</p>
<p>of picking those winners or losers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that data of supply and demand of an entire nation or a world of people making</p>
<p>individual decisions and having price be dynamic and informing me as the organization where</p>
<p>I should allocate my resources.</p>
<p>So the price is a really strong signal that allows you to operate a voluntary collective</p>
<p>where people get what they want and don&rsquo;t get what they don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>And it tells me what to produce, what not to produce.</p>
<p>And it also is great because if I see this podcasting industry, which didn&rsquo;t exist five</p>
<p>years ago, and now these people are making bank, that tells me as someone who is an investor,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making 50%, whatever, 10% profit on their capital.</p>
<p>In the plant industry, it&rsquo;s 2%.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to further my capital to this 10%, and that&rsquo;s going to lower the profit</p>
<p>rate as that builds up.</p>
<p>And that is how markets are regulated, voluntarily.</p>
<p>But the word government, I just think it&rsquo;s possible to have collectives of human beings</p>
<p>that represent others based on their voluntary&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, of course, you have private governance.</p>
<p>Any company, you can have a CEO, you can have a board of directors.</p>
<p>But then you, I just, it starts to look very similar to me, a successful private governance</p>
<p>mechanism at a scale of the United States starts looking a whole lot like the current</p>
<p>government of the United States.</p>
<p>Even Amazon, I don&rsquo;t think is anything close to the federal budget, size wise or budget</p>
<p>wise or power wise.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying you just, it&rsquo;s not even state, it&rsquo;s almost like anything at that size.</p>
<p>You want to keep things smaller.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, markets are not going to combine to that level of the state because Jeff Bezos</p>
<p>will never be in a position to tell everyone in America, I&rsquo;m going to take 40% of your</p>
<p>money before you even see it.</p>
<p>That to me is actually unclear.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that to be true, where that Google or Amazon can&rsquo;t grow to the size.</p>
<p>If you take away the US government, I&rsquo;m not so sure that Amazon can&rsquo;t grow to the size</p>
<p>of the US government.</p>
<p>Okay, so worst case scenario is we&rsquo;re back where we started, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not worst case scenario.</p>
<p>But the concern is that Google is going to be the federal government?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the concern.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying like, this is what it looks like when Google is the federal government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s like, to me, the US government is our best attempt so far to have large scale</p>
<p>representation of people&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>It really sucks, but it&rsquo;s our best attempt so far and the question is how to improve</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Like if you take away all, if you take away the US government, I&rsquo;m trying to see how do</p>
<p>we improve on that level, that scale of representation of people&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>Let me give you one example that people could wrap their hands around very easily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m against government police monopoly, I&rsquo;m for private security, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be an anarchist to understand this.</p>
<p>Can everyone agree, or at least as a hypothesis, everyone can wrap their heads around, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a big concern, 911, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this 911 call, it&rsquo;s very chilling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kid in a closet, his family&rsquo;s being murdered outside, right?</p>
<p>He has to call 911, he&rsquo;s whispering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrifying to hear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why the number I call for my family&rsquo;s being murdered is the same number</p>
<p>I call for the fire department is the same number I call for an ambulance.</p>
<p>What if instead it operated like Uber?</p>
<p>You have buttons on your phone, if there&rsquo;s a real emergency, like someone&rsquo;s gun flyers,</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s being killed, you press this and it sends instead of the one police district,</p>
<p>whatever company is nearby, you have a bunch of them and they&rsquo;re the ones who are going</p>
<p>to come to your house to save you.</p>
<p>People can wrap their heads around that very easily.</p>
<p>That is one very clear way to go from having a government security monopoly towards having</p>
<p>a more free enterprise system.</p>
<p>So when you apply that to pretty much anything, it doesn&rsquo;t become that complicated of an alternative.</p>
<p>So what I would, you&rsquo;re going to criticize this, but I believe the government, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the parenting thing we&rsquo;ve talked about earlier, I think it creates a safe space for gov, for</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for safe spaces, so I&rsquo;m not going to laugh at you about that.</p>
<p>I want people to be safe.</p>
<p>But for a safe space for entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>So I believe that good government, hold on a sec, give me a sec, give me a sec.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I think government gives a opportunity for companies to out compete it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>UPS, FedEx, 100%, not a question.</p>
<p>So I believe you need to have private schools, government to give a chance for UPS, FedEx,</p>
<p>for SpaceX, oh there&rsquo;s an X in there, to pop up and then government will naturally back</p>
<p>off from that place.</p>
<p>So like you, but you need the innovators to step in and build the thing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t just.</p>
<p>When has government ever backed off though?</p>
<p>That never happens.</p>
<p>I back, well, from FedEx and UPS, from SpaceX, from Amazon.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, hold on.</p>
<p>The US Postal Service still competes with FedEx and UPS.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>Not nearly.</p>
<p>Not well, but they still exist.</p>
<p>And the point is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dying.</p>
<p>But UPS and FedEx are taxed.</p>
<p>So not only are they paying for their own company, they&rsquo;re paying for this competitor.</p>
<p>This is the essential difference.</p>
<p>Imagine if you didn&rsquo;t have UPS, excuse me, the federal government and no post office.</p>
<p>So you had FedEx, you have DHL, you have US Postal Service and many others.</p>
<p>How about in this scenario, UPS has the capacity to take 20% of FedEx&rsquo;s DHL and couriers money</p>
<p>and put in their own pocket and they never have to do anything in return.</p>
<p>This is going to be an enormous advantage of UPS.</p>
<p>And then when you add the addition that UPS is not necessarily going to be more efficient</p>
<p>than the others, this is going to be a huge distortion in the market.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if your podcast, you just automatically got 20% of the views of everybody</p>
<p>else?</p>
<p>I mean, would there be any incentive for you to be great?</p>
<p>Or you could just sit in your laurels and do whatever you want even more than now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine more than now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a robot and lack imagination.</p>
<p>I think there just has to be, of course you can do it completely without government, but</p>
<p>government&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I need to hear.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I need to hear.</p>
<p>Show&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>What else you can do without government at the end?</p>
<p>Let us try.</p>
<p>The question is that safety net that&rsquo;s needed for entrepreneurship, that&rsquo;s needed for, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry to say, but I have a sense that there needs to be a bit of a safety net for freedom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more comfortable with saying you need a safety net for freedom than you need</p>
<p>one for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The beauty of markets is with your startup, if you have a startup and it completely fails,</p>
<p>the only person who&rsquo;s screwed is you and your investors.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m a government and I make a startup, the entire society fails, like the Iraq war.</p>
<p>If I have this cockamamie plan, everyone else doesn&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>They are both funding it and sometimes even drafted or forced into it.</p>
<p>The safety net, the antlers, getting back to the early anarchists, one of the things</p>
<p>that I admire about them, the inaugural communists, the old school left anarchists, is people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t remember what context they were in.</p>
<p>They were in context without a welfare state, they&rsquo;re immigrating in huge numbers from</p>
<p>Eastern Europe, you go to the Tenement Museum in New York, people like 12 to a room, kids</p>
<p>are working in factories, they&rsquo;re either working in factories or they have to starve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that their parents didn&rsquo;t love them, it&rsquo;s that the parents didn&rsquo;t have birth control,</p>
<p>which was a felony, and they also were in a position to put food on the table for their</p>
<p>kids because they&rsquo;re uneducated and the jobs are paying nothing.</p>
<p>You could understand why Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Proudhon, and all these other figures</p>
<p>were like, this is untenable, we see Carnegie with 80,000 mansions, whereas this lady whose</p>
<p>husband died at age 30, who&rsquo;s never been to high school or even junior high school, has</p>
<p>10 kids, how&rsquo;s she going to put food on the table, it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>You could understand why they would be like, all right, we need to seize this money and</p>
<p>distribute it around the people, that makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>In a contemporary context, where food is much cheaper, where shelter to some extent is more</p>
<p>available, when medical care, we&rsquo;re so oblivious to how bad things were that we see things</p>
<p>are bad now, so we assume that they were better than in some contexts.</p>
<p>They were much, much worse there in many contexts.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to make an argument for government, for me, the strongest argument</p>
<p>is like food stamps or like free lunches for children, because I agree that would be very</p>
<p>inefficient and it&rsquo;s going to probably make them obese because you&rsquo;re going to have Nabisco</p>
<p>lobbying to make sure that if you&rsquo;re going to have this protein, you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>give the kids an Oreo, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>These kids are poor, you want them to have some pleasure and that&rsquo;s going to have deleterious</p>
<p>effects.</p>
<p>But if the choice is an inefficient government program and mass starvation, that is one where</p>
<p>as an anarchist, I could easily see making the argument for that one.</p>
<p>Even though I think very clearly private charity would be more efficient and distribute it</p>
<p>more effectively.</p>
<p>But at that point, I don&rsquo;t really care about efficiency.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re throwing out food to make sure these kids get fed, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>So would engagement in military conflict be one of the biggest negative things about the</p>
<p>state to you?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>War is the state at its worst.</p>
<p>So if we take away war or make it defensive instead of aggressive, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, wouldn&rsquo;t that be a huge step forward if war instead of regarded, we&rsquo;re always,</p>
<p>this is what drives me crazy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taught as kids in school that war is a last resort.</p>
<p>And I agree with that.</p>
<p>And yet when you look at the corporate press, war is always the first response.</p>
<p>And these people do not talk about what war means.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll show examples during the Bush years of soldiers coming home in caskets, which</p>
<p>already is an unacceptable price in many cases for me.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t even pretend to care about the people overseas whose countries we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ransacked and lives we&rsquo;ve ruined.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, well, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Not ransack those countries?</p>
<p>So that war to me is the state at its worst.</p>
<p>See, I think that there is value from small government that doesn&rsquo;t engage in wars.</p>
<p>I do think that the kind of collectives that you imagine functioning well would look like</p>
<p>the best version of government that I imagine.</p>
<p>So I see them as the same.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it is just terminology.</p>
<p>I have no problem saying that I&rsquo;m using the word anarchism incorrectly and to go for what</p>
<p>you want.</p>
<p>I have no problem with that or anything, really.</p>
<p>Because like I said, life is beautiful.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, you wrote the essay, why I&rsquo;m not going to vote this time or ever.</p>
<p>Why I won&rsquo;t vote this year or any other year or any year.</p>
<p>And the basic idea.</p>
<p>I hope you do a better job reading it than you just read that title.</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;ll take as many takes as necessary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll read it in Russian and then pay somebody to translate it.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t even Russian at all.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just making up words.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d you find this guy?</p>
<p>You get what you pay for.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>This is anarchy.</p>
<p>This is what you wanted.</p>
<p>Like your basic summary is, let me see, if pressed, the simplest explanation I have for</p>
<p>refusing to vote is this, I don&rsquo;t vote for the same exact reasons that I don&rsquo;t take communion.</p>
<p>No matter how admirable he is or how much I agree with him, the Pope isn&rsquo;t the steward</p>
<p>over my soul, nor is any president the leader of my life.</p>
<p>This does not make me ignorant or evil any more than not being a Christian makes me ignorant</p>
<p>or evil.</p>
<p>If I need representation, I will hire the most qualified person to do so.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t voting our current best developed way of hiring the most qualified person to represent</p>
<p>you on some things?</p>
<p>No, because if I have a lawyer and the lawyer screws up, I can fire him.</p>
<p>If I vote for someone, I don&rsquo;t get who I want.</p>
<p>I get for who my neighbors want.</p>
<p>So that makes no sense.</p>
<p>Representation means I want you to speak for me.</p>
<p>Whereas voting is like, I kind of want you, but I&rsquo;ll take what I can get and I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to take what I could get regardless.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>In governments, again, that&rsquo;s what Bitcoin is.</p>
<p>You want to be represented in deciding what to do, but once&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait, Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t picking a person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not picking a president of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re picking an idea.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like a referendum.</p>
<p>And to me, a referendum is much more coherent and defensible than it is voting for a representative</p>
<p>because if I&rsquo;m voting for Joe Biden, I&rsquo;m saying this person speaks for me for abortion, taxation,</p>
<p>environmental policy, immigration, war, right?</p>
<p>The odds that unless you&rsquo;re a complete NPC, that this one person will speak for you for</p>
<p>everything and will deliver what he promised and has the power to deliver what he promises</p>
<p>is not true.</p>
<p>Whereas if I have Brexit, if I say I want Britain to remain part of the European Union</p>
<p>to say yes or no question, that makes a lot more sense to me.</p>
<p>But even that is not pure democracy because going back to the idea of the circulation</p>
<p>of elites, which James Burnham talked about, Pareto and Moscow and all them, you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>going to have someone telling you what you can and can&rsquo;t vote for and how these questions</p>
<p>are framed.</p>
<p>So in contradiction to what the left anarchist said, some element of hierarchy is always</p>
<p>going to be inevitable.</p>
<p>So listen, I agree with this aspect very much so that we should be voting for ideas and</p>
<p>issues not voting for leaders, for leaders to represent us across the full spectrum of</p>
<p>issues.</p>
<p>It seems to make no sense.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is great.</p>
<p>But I do think there should be a leader, I do believe in voting for representatives to</p>
<p>debate, to be communicators of ideas to us.</p>
<p>But let me start to interrupt you, but you could have those two things.</p>
<p>For example, wouldn&rsquo;t this be an improvement if they have that now, you have a referendum,</p>
<p>you want tax rates to be 30 or 40, whatever percent, you have the guy leading the campaign</p>
<p>for 50, fight for 50, then you have the lady leading the campaign for 40, fight for 40,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll go out there, they can have debates, they can talk about the issue, but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still not voting for one of them, you&rsquo;re voting for the issue.</p>
<p>That makes much more sense to me than I&rsquo;m going to vote for him and hope that he puts</p>
<p>forward 50 and that depends on 99 other senators.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But also, I mean, I do like the idea of voting for certain people to debate certain ideas.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s a major improvement.</p>
<p>But the final vote should be based on the idea.</p>
<p>So okay, so we agree.</p>
<p>That would be nice to have, plus no wars, and then you&rsquo;ll stop tweeting so aggressively.</p>
<p>And to decriminalize things that don&rsquo;t hurt people.</p>
<p>Drugs.</p>
<p>Drugs especially, prostitution is a big one.</p>
<p>And this is me talking, all cops are criminals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one, or maybe other than abused children, who needs access to the police other</p>
<p>than sex workers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who are the most likely to really put themselves in danger situation,</p>
<p>so they need to be able to call security, because that&rsquo;s why they have pimps.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re a woman dealing with some strange dudes who are a lot of the time going to have</p>
<p>weird kinks, you want to be able to be sure, even if you don&rsquo;t approve of prostitution,</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s horrible, that she&rsquo;s not going to be raped and murdered and have no consequences.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to say, oh, well, she&rsquo;s a prostitute, she can&rsquo;t be raped.</p>
<p>Just think for a second, if you&rsquo;re agreeing to sleep with somebody, and then he starts</p>
<p>choking you and beating the crap out of you and saying it&rsquo;s now it&rsquo;s a dom situation,</p>
<p>that is clearly beyond the pale of salt.</p>
<p>And the same thing with drugs, heroin, cocaine, crack.</p>
<p>The people that need help the most are the ones who are addicted to those drugs and putting</p>
<p>punishment.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose you think drug dealers should be in jail, right?</p>
<p>It is very hard for me to say that someone who sells cocaine should be treated or in</p>
<p>the same building as someone who rapes children, or as a murderer.</p>
<p>These are not similar types of evil, even if you believe that that drug dealer is an</p>
<p>evil person.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s an essay in there called by Alexander Berkman, who was Emma Goldman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>partner on prisons and crime.</p>
<p>And this is leftism at its best, forgetting the person is forgotten.</p>
<p>And the fact that we have the world&rsquo;s largest prison population, the fact that so many people</p>
<p>are just like, oh, you commit a crime, just put them in jail, throw away the key.</p>
<p>At the very least, if you want to be totally immoral about it, it&rsquo;s expensive.</p>
<p>And second of all, the concept that all criminals should be locked in a room together in these</p>
<p>kind of largely inhuman conditions, and that&rsquo;s going to help people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s the ideal mechanism.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tend to believe, I usually don&rsquo;t speak so negatively about politicians, but I do think</p>
<p>that politicians have done more evil in the war on drugs than did the people that are</p>
<p>supposed to be the criminals in this picture.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you another example of how this is the anarchist critique of power.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden, and I&rsquo;m not making fun of him, I&rsquo;m not taking shots at him.</p>
<p>He had an article in the New Yorker, where he talks about when he was in LA, he was buying</p>
<p>crack and there was a misunderstanding or like he left the crack pipe in the Hertz car</p>
<p>and then blah, blah, blah, there&rsquo;s an issue.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s admitting to a felony in writing to a reporter.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure this was within the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>There was no possibility he was going to have consequences.</p>
<p>Kamala Harris, who was a cop, talked about when she was in college, she was smoking weed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t begrudge you guys smoking your crack or smoking your weed, but for other</p>
<p>people who are poor or maybe just had the short end of the stick, this is years of their</p>
<p>life being destroyed.</p>
<p>At the very least, even an arrest is a traumatic situation.</p>
<p>If you have a weed or cocaine or crack, you&rsquo;re arrested, that&rsquo;s really going to screw up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to do a number on you being locked up.</p>
<p>So to have that double standard to me is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>And that has nothing to do with Republican or Democrat.</p>
<p>George W. Bush was a coke head back in the day.</p>
<p>He talks about overcoming his addiction, and I&rsquo;m glad that he did, more power to him.</p>
<p>But just to have this kind of, you know, it&rsquo;s just really kind of disturbing to me, and</p>
<p>this is my anarchist brain, like how prevalent drug use is in college.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a joke on South Park, like, there&rsquo;s a time and a place to try drugs, and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called college where people experiment.</p>
<p>But all those college kids, which are going to become next generation&rsquo;s elite, don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>have that worry that if they get caught, then anything&rsquo;s going to happen to them.</p>
<p>But that kid in the street who did not have that good upbringing, even if he&rsquo;s a piece</p>
<p>of crap, like he&rsquo;s not going to have a different punishment, I think that&rsquo;s just really at</p>
<p>his base on American.</p>
<p>So in contrast to Tolstoy, let me ask you about Emma Goldman.</p>
<p>You wrote that if anarchism believed in rulers, then Emma Goldman would be the undisputed</p>
<p>queen.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What ideas defined her flavor of anarchism, would you say?</p>
<p>Emma was really an old school radical.</p>
<p>She was a radical among radicals.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what ideas, I mean, what would define her was anarchism, obviously.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the violence.</p>
<p>I mean, she was more open to the idea of violent opposition versus somebody like Tolstoy.</p>
<p>Oh, sure, for sure.</p>
<p>So basically, Emma and Alexander Berkman, their mentor was someone named Johann Most.</p>
<p>And Johann Most was a very early free speech, not very early, but he was a free speech concern</p>
<p>because he published a pamphlet in Europe that was translated in the States about how</p>
<p>to build dynamite.</p>
<p>Because his idea was, all right, you have this oppressive government, this oppressive</p>
<p>police force that use batons and bolts against us.</p>
<p>The only way for us as the working class to level the playing field is through dynamite</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how you build it.</p>
<p>So the question is, all right, is this something that could be allowed to be legal now that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowing the layman to, in his own house, build bombs?</p>
<p>So Johann Most, basically, they had a big parting of ways because when Alexander Berkman</p>
<p>tried to assassinate Frick, Johann said, no, no, no, this is not something I&rsquo;m for.</p>
<p>And in fact, they thought with this assassination, this failed assassination, this would be the</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s fired off the revolution because you had the strike, the Pinkertons involved,</p>
<p>Pinkertons getting killed, strikers are getting killed.</p>
<p>This is what Marx predicted, they&rsquo;re gonna light the spark and everything&rsquo;s gonna come</p>
<p>falling down.</p>
<p>He ends up going to jail for 13 years instead, Alexander Berkman does.</p>
<p>And then Goldman and Berkman had a big issue because when Leon Salgas killed McKinley</p>
<p>in 1901, it was really, it&rsquo;s kind of humorous in retrospect.</p>
<p>He gets arrested and they&rsquo;re like, why&rsquo;d you kill the president?</p>
<p>He goes, I was radicalized by Emma Goldman and she&rsquo;s like, oh, damn it, she&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>run.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know this guy.</p>
<p>And she made the point about like, why is it worse than the president being killed and</p>
<p>somebody else?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all equal.</p>
<p>And you would think if you&rsquo;re against capitalism, against the ruling class, this would be your</p>
<p>first target.</p>
<p>But Berkman, who went to jail, who tried to assassinate someone, he had said, McKinley,</p>
<p>this is your villain?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a party hack.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a symptom of the times, this is foolish.</p>
<p>And Goldman disagreed with him.</p>
<p>He thought it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily justified, but it may have done something that was defensible.</p>
<p>So the three of them, you know, had their differences on the use of violence.</p>
<p>And in fact, when she came back from Russia and was denouncing it in her book, My Disillusionment</p>
<p>in Russia, My First Disillusionment in Russia, the last chapter she goes, look, I&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m against violence.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s the revolution comes, we&rsquo;re going to have to use force.</p>
<p>She goes, but it&rsquo;s not the force of the state against the working class, against the masses.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we&rsquo;re opposed to.</p>
<p>This is a complete obscenity to our principles.</p>
<p>So that was interesting.</p>
<p>The fact that she was a, her periodical Mother Earth was a clearinghouse for many prominent,</p>
<p>you know, ideas of the day that weren&rsquo;t anarchist, but were certainly radical.</p>
<p>So she was a bit, and also she was like tiny, she was like 5.1.</p>
<p>So to have this little woman who was so feisty and&hellip;</p>
<p>Talk back to Lenin.</p>
<p>She took on Lenin, Woodrow Wilson, J. Edgar Hoover was the one who deported her.</p>
<p>Someone who just&hellip;</p>
<p>And the thing is, you have to be careful because I think just like war, it&rsquo;s very easy to glamorize</p>
<p>violence and to regard it as something admirable or heroic, like you&rsquo;re fighting for the cause.</p>
<p>But if you take it out of the romanticism, you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re killing someone who had</p>
<p>kids.</p>
<p>You are, you know, killing someone with a family.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making your, if you&rsquo;re going to shoot someone, they&rsquo;re probably going to retaliate</p>
<p>twice as hard.</p>
<p>Violence sings its own song and this is a very dangerous road you&rsquo;re going down.</p>
<p>So you really need to be careful about what you&rsquo;re preaching here.</p>
<p>And you know, she kind of had this mixed feelings about it, but that is certainly not Emma Goldman</p>
<p>her best.</p>
<p>Emma Goldman her best was about the ultimate freedom of the individual, of caring about</p>
<p>people who are desperately poor, who despised the corporate idea that we all had to be made</p>
<p>into cookie cutters and be interchangeable and all have to start work at the same time.</p>
<p>And basically our entire lives slave for corporation that have nothing to show for it while they</p>
<p>get wealthy and you have no opportunity for either productive work or creative work.</p>
<p>So that I think the valorization of kind of the lowest of the low is something I find</p>
<p>very admirable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a quote of hers, which I think even for those of us who are, you know, for property</p>
<p>rights is left anarchism at its best, but she goes, go and ask for work.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t give you work, ask for bread.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t give you bread, take bread.</p>
<p>So the idea that like, if you&rsquo;re that poor and you&rsquo;re honestly trying to work and work</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t available and you steal food to keep alive, that you shouldn&rsquo;t feel guilt about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I would disagree with that.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s something to be said at that point where it&rsquo;s just like, you know,</p>
<p>if property rights come between that and mass starvation, it&rsquo;s going to be very hard for</p>
<p>anyone to make the case for property rights.</p>
<p>Now, my argument is when you have free enterprise, food becomes so plentiful that now obesity</p>
<p>is an issue.</p>
<p>But at the time she did not have, of course, have that data to access.</p>
<p>Is there somebody you left out from the book that you thought about leaving in like some</p>
<p>interesting figures?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a couple.</p>
<p>So Chomsky would have been one, of course, because he&rsquo;s probably one of the biggest anarchist</p>
<p>thinkers in contemporary times.</p>
<p>I was on the fence about Herbert Spencer because he&rsquo;s not an anarchist.</p>
<p>Chris Williamson&rsquo;s reading the chapter for the book.</p>
<p>He coined the term Survival of the Fittest and the chapter is called The Right to Ignore</p>
<p>the State from his book, Social Statics.</p>
<p>It was deleted from later editions, but people found it and reprinted it.</p>
<p>And Randolph Bourne, he was an early progressive.</p>
<p>He was the only one or one of the very few fighting against entering the Great War.</p>
<p>And he had an essay called War is the Health of the State, which is basically about how</p>
<p>states love war because it gives them an excuse to increase their power.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to argue against increasing state power in a time of war.</p>
<p>But since he was not himself an anarchist and there was plenty antiwar in there already,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t include him, but those would be the ones.</p>
<p>Is there some people that you think the public would be surprised to learn that they are</p>
<p>at least in part anarchists?</p>
<p>Like I saw that Howard Zinn is supposedly an anarchist.</p>
<p>I mean, is there, like, just like Tolstoy is an anarchist.</p>
<p>Is there some people like that that you think in our modern life that would be surprised</p>
<p>to learn they&rsquo;re anarchists?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any off the top of my head.</p>
<p>I mean, you could say Carl Hess, who was like Barry Goldwater&rsquo;s speechwriter from the 1964</p>
<p>campaign, but he&rsquo;s hardly a household name.</p>
<p>I mean, I think a lot of people would not ascribe to that term, but are certainly informed</p>
<p>with this complete distrust of all authority.</p>
<p>Murray Rothbard had an essay, if I didn&rsquo;t include anatomy of the state, I was going</p>
<p>to include this one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much, much shorter.</p>
<p>And his question was, who are our allies and who are our enemies?</p>
<p>And the point he made is there&rsquo;s lots of people who would call themselves anarchists who are</p>
<p>of little use, whereas someone who is still like a minarchist or for government, but genuinely</p>
<p>hates the question Rothbard had is if there&rsquo;s a button and you could press that you would</p>
<p>end the state, would you press it so fast your finger would get a blister?</p>
<p>Those are allies, even if they&rsquo;re, you know, somewhat of a minarchist.</p>
<p>So I think that is kind of a better lens of looking at it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think anyone needs to really ascribe to anarchism as a whole ideology in so far</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re seeing right now, many people in certain fringe elements are just essentially</p>
<p>or are decreasingly fringe and increasing mainstream elements are realizing that this</p>
<p>idea that whatever the state does is somehow morally binding or legitimate is something</p>
<p>that at least bears strong questioning.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And I mean, I guess there&rsquo;s a lot of groups like the libertarians, for example, have some</p>
<p>element of that.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s the beginning of the ways of government.</p>
<p>And also, I think what I love, I mean, if there&rsquo;s one issue where I would want people</p>
<p>to have this kind of analysis, it is war.</p>
<p>And it is like, okay, are you really sure?</p>
<p>Because this is 100% going to result in a lot of people being killed, a lot of people</p>
<p>being traumatized, a lot of people who are never going to recover, children, innocent</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>Are you really sure this is the right thing to do?</p>
<p>And I think a lot of times if the answer is, well, it&rsquo;s the profitable thing to do.</p>
<p>And that is, I think, again, government at its absolute most venal and worst.</p>
<p>You Michael Malice in many ways are a New Yorker.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one example.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where Austin is on the map.</p>
<p>No idea.</p>
<p>Not even kidding.</p>
<p>But does it even matter?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, you&rsquo;ve decided to move to Austin.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Why do you think you&rsquo;re moving to Austin, or why do you moving both to Austin and away</p>
<p>from New York?</p>
<p>This was one of the both, I hate it when people talk like this, but I&rsquo;m gonna do it anyway.</p>
<p>This was one of the hardest and easiest decisions of my life.</p>
<p>It was hard because I&rsquo;ve lived in New York since I was two, other than college.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only home I&rsquo;ve known.</p>
<p>I know it intimately.</p>
<p>I know all the cool spots.</p>
<p>I love it with every fiber of my being or I did.</p>
<p>It was very much, you know, ingrained in my personality, my outlook about what cities</p>
<p>can be and can&rsquo;t be and should be and shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>Deciding to move was not done.</p>
<p>But when you see your crew, your chosen family, one by one whittling away, it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>They all left.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a couple of us left in New York.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see any mechanism by which New York is going to improve.</p>
<p>Things are getting much worse all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just completely outrageous.</p>
<p>Here I would have a huge crew.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize how much cheaper real estate is than in New York.</p>
<p>This is another way.</p>
<p>So New Yorkers are the most provincial people on earth who are completely oblivious to the</p>
<p>rest of the country.</p>
<p>So for a long time, the argument was New York versus LA, right, for certain types of people.</p>
<p>And they would say LA is cheaper in terms of rent.</p>
<p>So in New York, let&rsquo;s suppose the rent is a thousand, LA was 700, but you have to get</p>
<p>a car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is kind of a wash.</p>
<p>So I assumed Austin would be like 80% of New York prices.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at these houses and for like 700,000, you could get a house here that would</p>
<p>cost like 3.5 million in New York.</p>
<p>And you could have a gun.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, I could have a yard and I could have a dog and I could have a three</p>
<p>bedroom and I could have, you know, aquariums and my weird plants.</p>
<p>So to have all that, and it&rsquo;s just to have, I am very, very lucky that I have such a supportive</p>
<p>crew.</p>
<p>And they were also very smart because they sat me down and they said, whatever excuse</p>
<p>you have not to move here, we are going to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>So my buddy Matt said, because I have a huge library, he goes, I will go to your house</p>
<p>and I will pack every single book you own myself so you can get that as an excuse the</p>
<p>other way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to drive and you do this, she&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re going to take driving lessons</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>There goes that excuse.</p>
<p>How do I find an apartment?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;ll go to with the realtor and we&rsquo;ll take pictures for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll report back.</p>
<p>You can trust our judgment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I would do that.</p>
<p>That sounds like fun shopping for houses that have to buy them.</p>
<p>Then Matt just yesterday had the idea goes, come here, rent a furnished apartment for</p>
<p>a few months.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the pressure of buying.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s going to be an easy transition.</p>
<p>The rent&rsquo;s not going to be anything compared to New York.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, these are all very valid things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Lots of other people.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what this is.</p>
<p>I made sure that&rsquo;s renting month to month.</p>
<p>Oh, this is rental.</p>
<p>This is rental.</p>
<p>Oh, you didn&rsquo;t realize this.</p>
<p>I thought you bought this.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>This is rental.</p>
<p>We can talk.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I thought you bought it.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s rental.</p>
<p>Well, I really value freedom.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Who are you talking to?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of this thing, freedom, it&rsquo;s really great.</p>
<p>But not everybody in the implementation of freedom is different for everybody.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make a statement about others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just speak for myself.</p>
<p>I think when you buy a house, that is not just a wise financial decision or all those</p>
<p>kinds of reasons that people have, investment, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also a hit on your freedom because the positive way to frame that is you make</p>
<p>it a home.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You have a deep connection to it.</p>
<p>But the negative way to frame it is you&rsquo;re now a little bit stuck there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you may stay there way longer than you should when much better opportunities for</p>
<p>life come up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stages in life when you&rsquo;re not sure exactly what the future will hold.</p>
<p>I would argue that&rsquo;s very often the case, basically at every stage in life.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure I maximize the freedom to embrace the most ambitious, the craziest,</p>
<p>the wildest, the most beautiful opportunities that come by.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve actually brought this up too, because I said I really enjoyed the conversation with</p>
<p>you and Yaron, talking to you and somebody else, and I think you make a really significant</p>
<p>effort.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said this before, but it really is true and it stands in contrast to other folks</p>
<p>who are also good conversation.</p>
<p>You really make an effort for that person to meet the person.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>You made me realize it&rsquo;s kind of an art form, but it&rsquo;s also just, it&rsquo;s a thing worth doing</p>
<p>of putting in that effort and that leap of humanity to reach the, whether you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>to Dave Rubin or Alex Jones or Joe or me, just those are different human beings and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking that leap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, do you have, how do you think about that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge introvert as you are, I think.</p>
<p>I feel very, very, very lucky that I get to get on a mic and run my mouth and for some</p>
<p>people, for some reason, people like this.</p>
<p>So I know what it&rsquo;s like to have a good convo and I know what it&rsquo;s like to have a bad convo.</p>
<p>So before I&rsquo;ll do a show, I will have like some things I would want to talk about.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll think about how to say them in an engaging way.</p>
<p>So I do my homework in that regard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also very good at, or I pride myself at taking people who are cerebral or intellectual</p>
<p>and making them a little bit silly, but also making them feel safe to be silly because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be making a buffoon of them that we&rsquo;re having fun as opposed to disrespecting</p>
<p>the person.</p>
<p>I think we all saw that with Yaron, who&rsquo;s very cerebral, very serious, but we were all</p>
<p>cracking jokes and he was having a good time and he knew even if I&rsquo;m making fun of him</p>
<p>to his face, it is coming from a place of kindness and he&rsquo;s in on the joke and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all having fun.</p>
<p>That is something I try to do as much as possible.</p>
<p>I had an episode of my show a couple of weeks ago and someone who&rsquo;s been a friend of mine</p>
<p>for a long time and someone I admire a lot, Elizabeth Spires, she was the founding member</p>
<p>of, founding editor of Gawker, she&rsquo;s worked for the Observer for Jared Kushner, her resume</p>
<p>second to none and she was on my show and she was talking, her politics are pretty straightforward</p>
<p>like corporate journalist, blue pilled politics and my audience was very upset that I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pushing back or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, my job, if someone is coming to a place where the audience is at least going</p>
<p>to be somewhat hostile, is not to make her have negative consequences for doing something</p>
<p>that she didn&rsquo;t need to do.</p>
<p>My job is to make sure that the experience is a positive one for her as the host.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m the guest, I always feel that my job is to make the host look good and make</p>
<p>the host not feel like it&rsquo;s work and the audience really likes that because instead of it being</p>
<p>an interview or intense, it is a conversation, nine of us know what&rsquo;s going to happen and</p>
<p>so this is something I think about a fair amount and I try to apply and insofar as it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>successful, I&rsquo;m delighted and there&rsquo;s times when it&rsquo;s not successful and that&rsquo;s a shame</p>
<p>but all we could do is do our best.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really enjoyed that conversation with her.</p>
<p>I was surprised by the dislikes and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things I always talk about is I don&rsquo;t care what my friends politics are.</p>
<p>I care about if I&rsquo;m having a bad day, can I call them up and ask for advice and Elizabeth</p>
<p>has been there for me in the past and then when I do it on a camera in front of mics,</p>
<p>people freaking out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m practicing what I preach.</p>
<p>My, the relationships are more important than someone&rsquo;s political views and it&rsquo;s not hypocrisy</p>
<p>at all to demonstrate that and not to push back.</p>
<p>And there was great humor there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both a bit of trolls in very different ways but nevertheless, that connection, the</p>
<p>humor and the mutual respect and love that was all there, yeah, it&rsquo;s just fascinating.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked to Alex Jones a couple days ago.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen him many times before but you&rsquo;ve had him on your podcast.</p>
<p>This week, yeah.</p>
<p>This week.</p>
<p>I was kind of surprised that he mentioned that human animal hybrids was like the number,</p>
<p>the main conspiracy that people should look into to open their eyes to the, you know,</p>
<p>to all this, to the globalists, to all the conspiracies that are out there.</p>
<p>Was that surprising to you?</p>
<p>No, because I came in there with questions and I was very focused on corralling him and</p>
<p>having it be like kind of a coherent intellectual conversation.</p>
<p>That was a really, really good, it was only an hour but it was a very good conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>I, the response was overwhelmingly positive and I&rsquo;m like, all right, I&rsquo;m in a unique position</p>
<p>because Alex, I met Alex, well, that&rsquo;s not true, but I was on Alex, with Alex on Tim</p>
<p>Pool a couple of times.</p>
<p>It was mayhem, it was anarchy and I&rsquo;m like, all right, let me get.</p>
<p>But the thing is what people enjoyed is I was the one who was basically able to translate</p>
<p>Alex&rsquo;s ease.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s obviously very performative and a lot of times Alex will say things that are not</p>
<p>really particularly controversial, but he&rsquo;ll say them in such a way that it sounds crazier</p>
<p>than it is.</p>
<p>You know, I think Joe&rsquo;s made this observation as well.</p>
<p>So what I wanted to have him on my show is, all right, let&rsquo;s go through all these conspiracies</p>
<p>which have validity, which don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I knew if I asked him, because he&rsquo;s got a lot of historical knowledge, even if you</p>
<p>think of a lot of it&rsquo;s nonsensical, let&rsquo;s sort out the wheat from the chaff, you know,</p>
<p>because everyone has someone crazy in them.</p>
<p>I have this expression, you take one red pill, not the whole bottle, you take the whole bottle</p>
<p>of red pills, you assume literally everything in the media is a lie, that&rsquo;s just not a coherent</p>
<p>position to have.</p>
<p>Is the weather a lie when they tell you that temperature is going to be wrong tomorrow?</p>
<p>So that was fun to watch him go through that.</p>
<p>And he felt bad because he felt incorrectly, in my opinion, that he was needlessly aggressive</p>
<p>and disrespectful toward me on Tim.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel disrespected at all.</p>
<p>It got heated, but I didn&rsquo;t take it personally.</p>
<p>People have heated debates all the time.</p>
<p>So I think he promised me he wouldn&rsquo;t interrupt and would be deferential, but that because</p>
<p>he promised to be on his best behavior, that gave me an opportunity to address him seriously</p>
<p>and not to bring the clown aspect out of him, which is easy to caricature him.</p>
<p>My friend Ethan Suppley, who I&rsquo;m sure people know, played basically a character based on</p>
<p>him in The Hunt, because Alex is kind of this cartoon archetype.</p>
<p>So it was really fun to get another side of him.</p>
<p>And also, it&rsquo;s just fun being on his show, just him being bombastic and just trying to</p>
<p>be the calm voice of reason.</p>
<p>And for once, the trickster was Apollo.</p>
<p>Well, I like this thing he said before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes me the most interested in Alex is the Nietzsche quote about gazing</p>
<p>into the abyss.</p>
<p>I think he said on your show that he has become the abyss or something like that.</p>
<p>I think that makes him fascinating that when you really take conspiracy theories seriously,</p>
<p>the kind of effect it has on your mind.</p>
<p>That to me is fascinating.</p>
<p>Well, can I say one thing, that term conspiracy theory?</p>
<p>If you ask any layman, look, it&rsquo;s like this, you say, do you like puppies?</p>
<p>I hate them.</p>
<p>Do you like baby dogs?</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re the best, right?</p>
<p>People, the human mind is capable of doing this.</p>
<p>So if you ask people, do you think extremely powerful people often get together and manipulate</p>
<p>data or rules in order to further their power and control and maintain it?</p>
<p>I think 90 plus percent of people would be like, of course.</p>
<p>Then you say, oh, so you believe in conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Oh no, that&rsquo;s for crazy people.</p>
<p>Those concepts are identical.</p>
<p>Now that term is used for people who are like, all right, there&rsquo;s conspiracies in government</p>
<p>to experiment on people like Tuskegee.</p>
<p>This is not in dispute.</p>
<p>The CIA has unsealed things, Operation Mockingbird, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And at the same time, conspiracy theory applies to people who say 9 11 never happened and</p>
<p>those are holograms.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s the same word for both, but these are not at all equal truth claims and they</p>
<p>do not at all have equal evidence to them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very useful for powerful people to have that term in the zeitgeist because then</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to explain or defend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, only lunatics are going to look further on this.</p>
<p>Do you really want to be a lunatic kid?</p>
<p>And that takes care of the issue.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the same problem applies, language applies to a lot of other areas.</p>
<p>100%, that&rsquo;s the nature of language, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used not just to communicate, but to obfuscate.</p>
<p>Obviously that could be fixed by coming up with different words to label conspiracy theories</p>
<p>that are much more likely to be true.</p>
<p>Yeah, like power elite analysis is another, is basically conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>This is the black pill versus white pill question with the abyss.</p>
<p>Do you think thinking about these things can destroy the mind, can make you deeply cynical</p>
<p>about the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, because if you are thinking that you are not aware of, or no one is aware of who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>controlling things and that the level of their control, it gives you the sense of powerlessness</p>
<p>and hopelessness.</p>
<p>And my counter is the people in charge, one of the reasons I&rsquo;m an anarchist, are nowhere</p>
<p>near as smart and crafty as you think they are.</p>
<p>And certainly maybe the ones complete in the shadow maybe are, but the ones who are in</p>
<p>the public face most certainly are not, as social media has demonstrated, when you look</p>
<p>at how senators and Harvard professors tweet, these are not, you know, intellects that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in awe of, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>So I think that kind of takes the bloom off the rose to a great extent.</p>
<p>You mentioned that you&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of amazing things, been truly joyful recently.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if you have a bucket list.</p>
<p>Is there items on the bucket list you haven&rsquo;t done yet?</p>
<p>Are you pretty much satisfied and happy, and if you die today, if I murder you, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be happy?</p>
<p>I could die today.</p>
<p>Is there an item on the bucket list you want to get done?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, yeah.</p>
<p>Deep Sea submersible.</p>
<p>That would be number one on the bucket list.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s where all the most interesting zoology is.</p>
<p>And to be in a place where like virtually no human being has been, and to see these</p>
<p>gods mistakes and their natural environment.</p>
<p>My friend coined that term gods mistakes.</p>
<p>If you look at deep sea creatures, you can imagine god making some animal being like,</p>
<p>oh god, this is hideous, I&rsquo;ll just throw them on the ocean, no one&rsquo;s gonna see this.</p>
<p>So that would be my number one bucket list thing.</p>
<p>I would say go to the White House as a guest would be a bucket list thing.</p>
<p>Russia, go to Russia would be a bucket list thing.</p>
<p>I want to go, these are secondary, like go to Eritrea would be a bucket list thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a long list of books I need to write.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s really a bucket list per se.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not that much, what I&rsquo;m at a point in my life is once you cross up certain things,</p>
<p>you basically, instead of driving the car, start surfing.</p>
<p>And just amazing thing, I talked to you about this medical thing, you know, before we started.</p>
<p>At a certain point, and I&rsquo;m sure this happens to you, because your platform is a lot bigger</p>
<p>than mine, all sorts of things start coming your way that you never would have thought</p>
<p>of.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, this is pretty darn cool.</p>
<p>So to be, and that&rsquo;s happening at an escalating rate.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m at a point now where I get stopped every day by people.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to be a weird thing for me to get adjusted to.</p>
<p>Like without exception, everyone who has ever stopped me on the street has been cool.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>There was one exception at an event where someone was genuinely on the spectrum and</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t understand like distance and you don&rsquo;t touch people and that, but that&rsquo;s as</p>
<p>bad as it got.</p>
<p>So that is something that&rsquo;s going to be weird for me to have to deal with over the next</p>
<p>couple of years.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s the price you pay and it&rsquo;s hardly a small price when people come up to</p>
<p>you and say you&rsquo;ve made my life better.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just weird when you go and like, like I was at the gym and then someone tweets</p>
<p>like, did I see you at the gym just now?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of weird.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the same for you when you&rsquo;re walking around and you don&rsquo;t think about it,</p>
<p>but people know who you are and you don&rsquo;t know who they are that you&rsquo;re being watched.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s not malevolent, it&rsquo;s still just, you don&rsquo;t get prepared for that.</p>
<p>Michael, there were, there will be two really big names that wanted to do this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do this podcast that I considered to do episode 200 with.</p>
<p>But then I realized why the hell talk to somebody famous when I could talk to somebody I love</p>
<p>that nobody knows or cares for.</p>
<p>You just hit a random number generator.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just, I listed all the Russians I know and who is the easiest to get.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the.</p>
<p>Yeah, who&rsquo;s the most desperate for camera stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a shitty book out, we can talk about that for five minutes.</p>
<p>This garbage cut and paste that he did.</p>
<p>Uh, it turned out okay, I think slightly above average.</p>
<p>Michael, I love you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor that you would talk to me and you&rsquo;ll be my friend.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for doing this.</p>
<p>Uh, the respect that I got, uh, when you asked me to be the guest for the anniversary episode</p>
<p>was similar to the respect when my two friends, Josh and Zoe, they were going to get married</p>
<p>at city hall and they said, we want someone to witness at the Basque.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one thing when people tell you they like you and respect you, which I had growing</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another thing when they show it.</p>
<p>And this is something that I do not take lightly and I hope no one takes lightly.</p>
<p>And if someone does right by you and shows you respect, going back to kind of taking</p>
<p>out for dinner, thank them, buy them a candy bar, buy them a soda, do something to show</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t take it for granted.</p>
<p>Because I think what you and I both want to do is increase human kindness as much as possible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to look at the camera, be kind to yourself, because a lot of you deserve</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Malice and thank you to Gala</p>
<p>Games, Indeed, BetterHelp and Masterclass.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Jack Kerouac that perhaps begins to explain</p>
<p>the nature of and the reasons for my friendship with Mr. Michael Malice.</p>
<p>The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad</p>
<p>to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say</p>
<p>commonplace thing but burn, burn, like fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like spiders</p>
<p>across the stars and in the middle you see the blue center light pop and everybody goes</p>
<p>ahhhhh.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
