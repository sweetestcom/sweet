    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day,</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome,</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>This month, we&rsquo;ve been talking about the senses,</p>
<p>how we detect things in our environment.</p>
<p>The last episode was all about vision,</p>
<p>how we take light and convert that information</p>
<p>into things that we can perceive,</p>
<p>like colors and faces and motion,</p>
<p>as well as how we use light to change our biology</p>
<p>in ways that are subconscious, that we don&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>things like mood and metabolism and levels of alertness.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about chemical sensing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about the sense of smell,</p>
<p>our ability to detect odors in our environment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about taste,</p>
<p>our ability to detect chemicals</p>
<p>and make sense of chemicals that are put in our mouth</p>
<p>and into our digestive tract,</p>
<p>and we are going to talk about chemicals</p>
<p>that are made by other human beings</p>
<p>that powerfully modulate the way that we feel,</p>
<p>our hormones and our health.</p>
<p>Now, that last category are sometimes called pheromones.</p>
<p>However, whether or not pheromones exist in humans</p>
<p>is rather controversial.</p>
<p>There actually hasn&rsquo;t been a clear example</p>
<p>of a true human pheromonal effect,</p>
<p>but what is absolutely clear, what is undeniable</p>
<p>is that there are chemicals that human beings make</p>
<p>and release in things like tears onto our skin</p>
<p>and sweat and even breath that powerfully modulate</p>
<p>or control the biology of other individuals.</p>
<p>In fact, right now, even if you&rsquo;re completely alone,</p>
<p>your chemical environment internally</p>
<p>is being controlled by external chemicals.</p>
<p>Your nervous system and your hormones and your metabolism</p>
<p>are being modified by things in your environment.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolutely fascinating aspect to our biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of our most primordial,</p>
<p>meaning primitive aspects of our biology,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still very active in all of us today.</p>
<p>This episode, believe it or not,</p>
<p>will have a lot of tools, a lot of protocols.</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m guessing most of you</p>
<p>can probably smell your environment just fine,</p>
<p>that you know what you like to eat and what tastes good</p>
<p>and what doesn&rsquo;t taste good to you,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode is going to talk about tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to actually leverage</p>
<p>these chemical sensing mechanisms,</p>
<p>including how you smell,</p>
<p>not how you smell in the qualitative sense,</p>
<p>but how you smell in the verb sense,</p>
<p>the action of sniffing and smelling</p>
<p>to enhance your sense of smell</p>
<p>and to enhance your sense of taste as well,</p>
<p>believe it or not, to enhance your cognition,</p>
<p>your ability to learn and remember things.</p>
<p>Everything we&rsquo;re going to talk about, as always,</p>
<p>is grounded in quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>from some excellent laboratories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide some resources along the way,</p>
<p>so that means tools and protocols,</p>
<p>and also basic information.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn a ton of neuroscience</p>
<p>and a lot of biology in general.</p>
<p>And I think what you&rsquo;ll come to realize by the end</p>
<p>is that while we are clearly different</p>
<p>from the other animals,</p>
<p>there are aspects to our biology</p>
<p>that are very similar to that of other animals</p>
<p>in very interesting ways.</p>
<p>Before we dive into chemical sensing,</p>
<p>I want to just briefly touch on a few things</p>
<p>from the vision episode.</p>
<p>One is a summary of a protocol.</p>
<p>So I covered 13 protocols last episode.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen that episode, check it out.</p>
<p>Those protocols will allow you to be more alert</p>
<p>and to see better over time if you follow them.</p>
<p>All of them are zero cost.</p>
<p>You can find any and all of them at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a link to those videos and tools and protocols.</p>
<p>Everything is time-stamped.</p>
<p>The two protocols that I just want to remind everybody of</p>
<p>are the protocol of near-far viewing</p>
<p>that all of us, regardless of age,</p>
<p>should probably spend about five minutes three times a week</p>
<p>doing some near-far viewing exercises.</p>
<p>So that would be bringing a pen or pencil up close</p>
<p>to the point where you&rsquo;re about to cross your eyes,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t cross your eyes,</p>
<p>and then out at some distance,</p>
<p>and then look beyond that pen or other object</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using off as far as you can into the distance.</p>
<p>It would be great if you could do this on a balcony or deck</p>
<p>and then look way off in the distance,</p>
<p>and then bring it back in.</p>
<p>This is going to exercise that accommodation reflex.</p>
<p>The change in the shape of the lens</p>
<p>can help offset a number of things,</p>
<p>including myopia, nearsightedness.</p>
<p>The other one is this incredible study</p>
<p>that showed that two hours a day outside,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re doing other things while you&rsquo;re outside,</p>
<p>can help offset myopia and nearsightedness.</p>
<p>So try and get outside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the sunlight and the blue light, right?</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s been demonizing blue light out there,</p>
<p>but blue light is great,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not super, super bright</p>
<p>and really close to your eyes.</p>
<p>Blue light is terrific if it comes from sunlight.</p>
<p>Two hours a day outside</p>
<p>is going to help offset myopia, nearsightedness.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a lot of time.</p>
<p>I think most of us are not getting that time,</p>
<p>but since you can do other things like gardening or reading</p>
<p>or walking or running,</p>
<p>if you can get that two hours outside,</p>
<p>your visual system and your brain will benefit.</p>
<p>I also would like to make one brief correction</p>
<p>to something that I said incorrectly</p>
<p>in the previous episode.</p>
<p>At the end of the episode, I talked about lutein</p>
<p>and how lutein may help offset some moderate</p>
<p>to severe age-related macular degeneration.</p>
<p>As well, I talked about how some people</p>
<p>are supplementing with lutein</p>
<p>even though they don&rsquo;t have age-related macular degeneration</p>
<p>with the idea in mind that it might help</p>
<p>offset some vision loss as they get older.</p>
<p>I said lutein and lutein was the correct thing to say,</p>
<p>but once or twice when I started speaking fast,</p>
<p>I said lucein and not lutein.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that lucein, an amino acid,</p>
<p>very interesting, important for muscle building,</p>
<p>covered in previous episodes,</p>
<p>but lutein, L-U-T-E-I-N,</p>
<p>is the molecule and compound that I was referring to</p>
<p>in terms of supplementing for sake of vision.</p>
<p>So I apologize, please forgive me, I misspoke.</p>
<p>A couple of you caught that right away.</p>
<p>In listening to the episode after it went up,</p>
<p>I realized that I had misspoken.</p>
<p>So lutein for vision, lucein for muscles</p>
<p>and muscle growth and strength, et cetera.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the content of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I want to just briefly touch on color vision.</p>
<p>Many of you asked questions about color vision</p>
<p>and color perception.</p>
<p>And indeed, color perception is a fascinating aspect</p>
<p>of the human visual system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things that makes us unique.</p>
<p>There are certainly other animals out there</p>
<p>that can detect all the colors of the rainbow.</p>
<p>Some can even detect into the infrared</p>
<p>and to the far red that we can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, human color vision,</p>
<p>provided that somebody isn&rsquo;t colorblind,</p>
<p>is really remarkable.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in color vision</p>
<p>or you want to answer questions about art</p>
<p>or about, for instance, why that dress</p>
<p>that showed up online a few years ago</p>
<p>looks blue to you and yellow to somebody else,</p>
<p>all the answers to that are in this terrific book,</p>
<p>which is, What is Color?</p>
<p>15 Questions and Answers on the Science of Color.</p>
<p>I did not write this book, I wish I had.</p>
<p>The book is by Ariel and Joan Ekstut.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s E-C-K-S-T-U-T.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, What is Color?</p>
<p>50 Questions and Answers on the Science of Color.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolutely fabulous book.</p>
<p>I have no business relationship to them.</p>
<p>I did help them get in contact</p>
<p>with some color vision scientists</p>
<p>when they reached out to me.</p>
<p>And you can know that all the information in the book</p>
<p>was vetted by excellent color vision scientists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really wonderful and beautiful book.</p>
<p>The illustrations are beautiful.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s interested in design or art,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just curious about the science of color,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a terrific book, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>If you just look it up online,</p>
<p>there are a variety of places</p>
<p>that will allow you to access the book.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about sensing chemicals</p>
<p>and how chemicals control us.</p>
<p>In our environment,</p>
<p>there are a lot of different physical stimuli.</p>
<p>There is light photons, which are light energy,</p>
<p>and those land on your retinas,</p>
<p>and your retinas tell your brain about them,</p>
<p>and your brain creates this thing we call vision.</p>
<p>There are sound waves,</p>
<p>literally particles moving through the air</p>
<p>and reverberations that create</p>
<p>what we call sound and hearing.</p>
<p>And of course there are mechanical stimuli,</p>
<p>pressure, light touch, scratch, tickle, et cetera,</p>
<p>that lands on our skin or the blowing of a breeze</p>
<p>that deflects the hairs on our skin.</p>
<p>And we can sense mechanical touch, mechanical sensation.</p>
<p>And there are chemicals.</p>
<p>There are things floating around in the environment,</p>
<p>which we call volatile chemicals.</p>
<p>So volatile sounds oftentimes like emotionally volatile,</p>
<p>but it just means that they&rsquo;re floating around out there.</p>
<p>So when you actually smell something,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say you smell</p>
<p>a wonderfully smelling rose or cake,</p>
<p>yes, you are inhaling the particles into your nose.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally little particles of those chemicals</p>
<p>are going up into your nose</p>
<p>and being detected by your brain.</p>
<p>Also, if you smell something putrid, disgusting, or awful,</p>
<p>use your imagination,</p>
<p>those particles are going up into your nose</p>
<p>and being detected by neurons that are part of your brain.</p>
<p>Other ways of getting chemicals into our system</p>
<p>is by putting them in our mouth,</p>
<p>by literally taking foods and chewing them</p>
<p>or sucking on them and breaking them down</p>
<p>into their component parts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one way that we sense chemicals</p>
<p>with anything, our tongue.</p>
<p>And there are chemicals that can enter</p>
<p>through other mucosal linings</p>
<p>and other kind of just think damp,</p>
<p>sticky linings of your body.</p>
<p>And the main ones would be the eyes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got your nose, your eyes, and your mouth,</p>
<p>but mainly when we have chemicals coming into our system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s through our nose or through our mouth.</p>
<p>Although sometimes through our skin,</p>
<p>certain things can go transdermal, not many,</p>
<p>and through our eyes.</p>
<p>So these chemicals, we sometimes bring into our body,</p>
<p>into our biology through deliberate action.</p>
<p>We select a food, we chew that food,</p>
<p>and we do it intentionally.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re coming into our body</p>
<p>through non-deliberate action.</p>
<p>We enter an environment and there&rsquo;s smoke</p>
<p>and we smell the smoke.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, we take action.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are forced to eat something</p>
<p>because somebody tells us we should eat it</p>
<p>or we do it to be polite.</p>
<p>So there are all these ways</p>
<p>that chemicals can make it into our body.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, other people are actively</p>
<p>making chemicals with their body.</p>
<p>Typically this would be with their breath,</p>
<p>with their tears, or possibly,</p>
<p>I want to underscore possibly,</p>
<p>by making what are called pheromones,</p>
<p>molecules that they release into the environment,</p>
<p>typically through the breath,</p>
<p>that enter our system through our nose,</p>
<p>or our eyes, or our mouth,</p>
<p>that fundamentally change our biology.</p>
<p>I will explain how smell and taste</p>
<p>and these pheromone effects work,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just give an example,</p>
<p>which is a very salient and interesting one</p>
<p>that was published about 10 years ago</p>
<p>in the journal Science.</p>
<p>Science Magazine is one of the three,</p>
<p>what we call apex journals.</p>
<p>There are a lot of journals out there,</p>
<p>but for those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>Science Magazine, Nature Magazine, and Cell</p>
<p>are considered the three top kind of apex journals.</p>
<p>They are the most stringent</p>
<p>in terms of getting papers accepted there,</p>
<p>even reviewed there.</p>
<p>They have about a 95% rejection rate at the front gate,</p>
<p>meaning they don&rsquo;t even review 95% of what gets sent to them</p>
<p>of the things that they do decide to review</p>
<p>then get sent out,</p>
<p>a very small percentage of those get published.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very stringent.</p>
<p>This paper came out in Science showing that humans,</p>
<p>men in particular in this study,</p>
<p>have a strong biological response and hormonal response</p>
<p>to the tears of women.</p>
<p>What they did is they had women,</p>
<p>and in this case it was only women for whatever reason,</p>
<p>cry and they collected their tears.</p>
<p>Then those tears were smelled by male subjects</p>
<p>or male subjects got what was essentially the control,</p>
<p>which was the saline.</p>
<p>Men that smelled these tears that were evoked by sadness</p>
<p>had a reduction in their testosterone levels</p>
<p>that was significant.</p>
<p>They also had a reduction in brain areas</p>
<p>that were associated with sexual arousal.</p>
<p>Now, before you run off with your interpretations</p>
<p>about what this means and criticize the study</p>
<p>for any variety of reasons,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just take a step back.</p>
<p>I will criticize the study for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Two, one is that they only used female tears</p>
<p>and male subjects.</p>
<p>So it would have been nice for them to also use</p>
<p>female tears and female subjects smelling those,</p>
<p>male tears and male subjects smelling those,</p>
<p>male tears and female subjects smelling those and so on.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They did have a large number of subjects, so that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That adds power to the study.</p>
<p>And they did have to collect these tears</p>
<p>by having the women watch a,</p>
<p>what was essentially a sad scene from a movie.</p>
<p>They actually recruited subjects</p>
<p>that had a high propensity for crying at sad movies,</p>
<p>which was not all women.</p>
<p>It turned out that the people that they recruited</p>
<p>for the study were people who said,</p>
<p>yes, I tend to cry when I see sad things in movies.</p>
<p>What they were really trying to do is just get tears</p>
<p>that were authentically cried in response to sadness</p>
<p>as opposed to putting some irritant in the eye</p>
<p>and collecting tears that were evoked by something else,</p>
<p>like just having the eyes irritated.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, what this study illustrates</p>
<p>is that there are chemicals in tears</p>
<p>that are evoking or changing the biology</p>
<p>of other individuals.</p>
<p>Now, most of us don&rsquo;t think about sniffing</p>
<p>or smelling other people&rsquo;s tears,</p>
<p>but you can imagine how in close couples</p>
<p>or in family members or even close friendships, et cetera,</p>
<p>that we are often in close proximity</p>
<p>to other people&rsquo;s tears.</p>
<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t select this study as an example</p>
<p>because I want to focus on the effects</p>
<p>of tears on hormones per se,</p>
<p>although I do find the results really interesting.</p>
<p>I chose it because I wanted to just emphasize</p>
<p>or underscore the fact that chemicals</p>
<p>that are made by other individuals</p>
<p>are powerfully modulating our internal state.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that most of us don&rsquo;t appreciate.</p>
<p>I think most of us can appreciate the fact</p>
<p>that if we smell something putrid, we tend to retract,</p>
<p>or if we smell something delicious, we tend to lean into it.</p>
<p>But there are all these ways</p>
<p>in which chemicals are affecting our biology</p>
<p>and interpersonal communication using chemicals</p>
<p>is not something that we hear that often about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about smell and what smell is</p>
<p>and how it works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make this very basic,</p>
<p>but I am going to touch on some of the core elements</p>
<p>of the neurobiology.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how smell works.</p>
<p>Smell starts with sniffing.</p>
<p>Now that may come as no surprise,</p>
<p>but no volatile chemicals can enter our nose</p>
<p>unless we inhale them.</p>
<p>If our nose is occluded or if we&rsquo;re actively exhaling,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more difficult for smells to enter our nose,</p>
<p>which is why people cover their nose</p>
<p>when something smells bad.</p>
<p>Now, the way that these volatile odors</p>
<p>come into the nose is interesting.</p>
<p>The nose has a mucosal lining, mucus,</p>
<p>that is designed to trap things,</p>
<p>to actually bring things in and get stuck there.</p>
<p>At the base of your brain,</p>
<p>so you could actually imagine this,</p>
<p>or if you wanted, you could touch the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>but right above the mouth,</p>
<p>about two centimeters is your olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>The olfactory bulb is a collection of neurons,</p>
<p>and those neurons actually extend out of the skull,</p>
<p>out of your skull, into your nose,</p>
<p>into the mucosal lining.</p>
<p>So what this means in kind of a literal sense</p>
<p>is that you have neurons that extend</p>
<p>their little dendrites and axillary-like things,</p>
<p>their little processes, as we call them,</p>
<p>out into the mucus,</p>
<p>and they respond to different odorant compounds.</p>
<p>Now, the olfactory neurons also send a branch</p>
<p>deeper into the brain,</p>
<p>and they split off into three different paths.</p>
<p>So one path is for what we call innate odor responses.</p>
<p>So you have some hardwired aspects</p>
<p>to the way that you smell the world,</p>
<p>that were there from the day you were born,</p>
<p>and that will be there until the day you die.</p>
<p>These are the pathways and the neurons</p>
<p>that respond to things like smoke,</p>
<p>which, as you can imagine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a highly adaptive function</p>
<p>to being able to detect burning things,</p>
<p>because burning things generally means lack of safety</p>
<p>or impending threat of some kind.</p>
<p>It calls for action, and indeed,</p>
<p>these neurons project to a central area of the brain</p>
<p>called the amygdala,</p>
<p>which is often discussed in terms of fear,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really fear and threat detection.</p>
<p>So some compounds, some chemicals in your environment,</p>
<p>when you smell them,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re trained to overcome them</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a firefighter,</p>
<p>you will naturally have a heightened level of alertness,</p>
<p>you will sense threat,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re in sleep, even, it will wake you up.</p>
<p>All right, so that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of an emergency system.</p>
<p>You also have neurons in your nose</p>
<p>that respond to odorants or combinations of odorants</p>
<p>that evoke a sense of desire</p>
<p>and what we call appetitive behaviors, approach behaviors,</p>
<p>that make you want to move toward something.</p>
<p>So when you smell a delicious cookie</p>
<p>or some dish that&rsquo;s really savory that you really like</p>
<p>or a wonderful orange,</p>
<p>and you say, mm, or it feels delicious,</p>
<p>or it smells delicious,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because of these innate pathway,</p>
<p>these pathways that require no learning whatsoever.</p>
<p>Now, some of the pathways from the nose,</p>
<p>these olfactory neurons into the brain,</p>
<p>are involved in learned associations with odors.</p>
<p>Many people have this experience</p>
<p>that they can remember the smell of their grandmother&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>or their grandmother&rsquo;s hands even,</p>
<p>or the smell of particular items baking</p>
<p>or on the stove in a particular environment.</p>
<p>Typically, these memories tend to be</p>
<p>of a kind of nurturing sort of feeling safe and protected,</p>
<p>but one of the reasons why olfaction, smell,</p>
<p>is so closely tied to memory</p>
<p>is because olfaction is the most ancient sense that we have,</p>
<p>or I should say chemical sensing</p>
<p>is among the most primitive and ancient senses that we have,</p>
<p>probably almost certainly evolved</p>
<p>before vision and before hearing.</p>
<p>But when we come into the world,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re still learning about the statistics of life,</p>
<p>about who&rsquo;s friendly and who&rsquo;s not friendly</p>
<p>and where&rsquo;s a fun place to be</p>
<p>and where&rsquo;s a boring place to be,</p>
<p>that all takes a long time to learn,</p>
<p>but the olfactory system seems to imprint,</p>
<p>seems to lay down memories very early</p>
<p>and to create these very powerful associations.</p>
<p>And if you think about it long enough and hard enough,</p>
<p>many of you can probably realize</p>
<p>that there are certain smells</p>
<p>that evoke a memory of a particular place</p>
<p>or person or context.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because you also have pathways out of the nose</p>
<p>that are not for innate behaviors</p>
<p>like cringing or repulsion or gagging</p>
<p>or for that appetitive sensation,</p>
<p>but that just remind you of a place or a thing or a context.</p>
<p>Could be flowers in spring,</p>
<p>could be grandmother&rsquo;s home and cookies.</p>
<p>This is a very common occurrence</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very common occurrence</p>
<p>because this generally exists in all of us.</p>
<p>So we have pathway for innate responses</p>
<p>and a pathway for learned responses.</p>
<p>And then we have this other pathway.</p>
<p>And in humans, it&rsquo;s a little bit controversial</p>
<p>as to whether or not it sits truly separate</p>
<p>from the standard olfactory system</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s its own system embedded in there,</p>
<p>but that they call the accessory olfactory pathway.</p>
<p>Accessory olfactory pathway is what in other animals</p>
<p>is responsible for true pheromone effects.</p>
<p>We will talk about true pheromone effects,</p>
<p>but for example, in rodents and in some primates,</p>
<p>including mandrills, if you&rsquo;ve ever seen a mandrill,</p>
<p>they have these like big beak noses things,</p>
<p>you may have seen them at the zoo,</p>
<p>look them up if you haven&rsquo;t seen them already,</p>
<p>M-A-N-D-R-I-L-S, mandrills.</p>
<p>There are strong pheromone effects.</p>
<p>Some of those include things like</p>
<p>if you take a pregnant female rodent or mandrill,</p>
<p>you take away the father that created those fetuses</p>
<p>or fetus, and you introduce the scent of the urine</p>
<p>or the fur of a novel male,</p>
<p>she will spontaneously abort or miscarry those fetuses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very powerful effect.</p>
<p>In humans, it&rsquo;s still controversial</p>
<p>whether or not anything like that can happen,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very powerful pheromonal effect in other animals.</p>
<p>Another example of a pheromone effect</p>
<p>is called the Vandenberg effect,</p>
<p>named after the person who discovered this effect,</p>
<p>where you take a female of a given species</p>
<p>that has not entered puberty,</p>
<p>you expose her to the scent or the urine</p>
<p>from a sexually competent, meaning post-pubertal male,</p>
<p>and she spontaneously goes into puberty earlier.</p>
<p>So something about the scent triggers something</p>
<p>through this accessory olfactory system,</p>
<p>this is a true pheromonal effect,</p>
<p>and creates ovulation, right, and menstruation.</p>
<p>Or in rodents, it&rsquo;s an estrous cycle, not a menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>So this is not to say</p>
<p>that the exact same things happen in humans.</p>
<p>In humans, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>there is chemical sensing between individuals</p>
<p>that may be independent of the nose,</p>
<p>and we will talk about those,</p>
<p>but those are basically the three paths</p>
<p>by which smells, odors impact us.</p>
<p>So I want to talk about the act of smelling.</p>
<p>And if you are not somebody who&rsquo;s very interested in smell,</p>
<p>but you are somebody who&rsquo;s interested</p>
<p>in making your brain work better,</p>
<p>learning faster, remembering more things,</p>
<p>this next little segment is for you,</p>
<p>because it turns out that how you smell,</p>
<p>meaning the act of smelling,</p>
<p>not how good or bad you smell,</p>
<p>but the act of smelling, sniffing, and inhalation</p>
<p>powerfully impacts how your brain functions</p>
<p>and what you can learn and what you can&rsquo;t learn.</p>
<p>Breathing generally consists of two actions,</p>
<p>inhaling and exhaling.</p>
<p>And we have the option, of course,</p>
<p>to do that through our nose or our mouth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked on previous episodes about the fact</p>
<p>that there are great advantages to being a nasal breather,</p>
<p>and there are great disadvantages to being a mouth breather.</p>
<p>There are excellent books and data on this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the recent book, Breath by James Nestor,</p>
<p>which is an excellent book</p>
<p>that describes some of the positive effects</p>
<p>of nasal breathing, as well as other breathing practices.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the book, Jaws, by my colleagues,</p>
<p>Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn,</p>
<p>with a forward by Jared Diamond</p>
<p>and an introduction by Robert Sapolsky from Stanford.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a book, chock-a-block with heavy hitter authors</p>
<p>that describes how being a nasal breather</p>
<p>is beneficial for jaw structure,</p>
<p>for immune system function, et cetera.</p>
<p>Breathing in through your nose,</p>
<p>sniffing actually has positive effects</p>
<p>on the way that you can acquire and remember information.</p>
<p>Noam Sobel&rsquo;s group, originally at UC Berkeley,</p>
<p>and then at the Weizmann Institute,</p>
<p>has published a number of papers</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to discuss today.</p>
<p>One of them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition</p>
<p>of Phase-Locked with Inhalation.</p>
<p>This was published in Nature Human Behavior,</p>
<p>an excellent journal,</p>
<p>showed that the act of inhaling</p>
<p>has a couple of interesting and powerful consequences.</p>
<p>First of all, as we inhale,</p>
<p>the brain increases in arousal.</p>
<p>Our level of alertness and attention</p>
<p>increases when we inhale as compared to when we exhale.</p>
<p>Now, of course, with every inhale, there&rsquo;s an exhale.</p>
<p>You could probably double up on your inhales</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing size or something, physiological size.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about these before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a double inhales followed by an exhale,</p>
<p>something like that, or if you&rsquo;re speaking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to change your cadence</p>
<p>and ratio of inhales and exhales.</p>
<p>But typically, we inhale, then we exhale.</p>
<p>As we inhale, what this paper shows</p>
<p>is that the level of alertness goes up in the brain.</p>
<p>And this makes sense because as the most primitive</p>
<p>and primordial sense by which we interact</p>
<p>with our environment and bring chemicals into our system</p>
<p>and detect our environment,</p>
<p>inhaling is a cue for the rest of the brain</p>
<p>to essentially to pay attention to what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>not just to the odors.</p>
<p>As the name of this paper suggests,</p>
<p>human non-olfactory cognition,</p>
<p>phase-locked with inhalation,</p>
<p>what that means is that the act of inhaling itself</p>
<p>wakes up the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about what you&rsquo;re perceiving</p>
<p>or what you&rsquo;re smelling.</p>
<p>And indeed, sniffing as an action,</p>
<p>inhaling as an action has a powerful effect</p>
<p>on your ability to be alert,</p>
<p>your ability to attend, to focus,</p>
<p>and your ability to remember information.</p>
<p>When we exhale, the brain goes through a subtle</p>
<p>but nonetheless significant dip in level of arousal</p>
<p>and ability to learn.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>How should you use this knowledge?</p>
<p>Well, you could imagine,</p>
<p>and I think this would be beneficial for most people,</p>
<p>to focus on nasal breathing</p>
<p>while doing any kind of focused work</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require that you speak</p>
<p>or eat or ingest something.</p>
<p>There is a separate paper published</p>
<p>in the Journal of Neuroscience</p>
<p>that showed that indeed, if subjects,</p>
<p>human subjects are restricted</p>
<p>to breathing through their nose,</p>
<p>they learn better than if they have the option</p>
<p>of breathing through their mouth</p>
<p>or a combination of their nose and mouth.</p>
<p>These are significant effects in humans</p>
<p>using modern techniques from excellent groups.</p>
<p>So sniffing itself is a powerful modulator</p>
<p>of our cognition and our ability to learn.</p>
<p>You can imagine all sorts of ways</p>
<p>that you might apply that as a tool.</p>
<p>And I suggest that you play with it a bit,</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re having a hard time staying awake and alert,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having a hard time remembering information,</p>
<p>you feel like you have a kind of attention deficit,</p>
<p>non-clinical, of course,</p>
<p>nasal breathing ought to help,</p>
<p>extending or making your inhales more intense ought to help.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t really about chemical sensing per se,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s where it gets interesting and exciting.</p>
<p>If you are somebody</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have a very good sense of smell,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re somebody who simply wants to get better</p>
<p>at smelling and tasting things,</p>
<p>you can actually practice sniffing.</p>
<p>I know that sounds ridiculous,</p>
<p>but it turns out that simply sniffing nothing,</p>
<p>so doing something like this,</p>
<p>I guess the microphone sort of has a smell,</p>
<p>I guess a pen doesn&rsquo;t have a smell,</p>
<p>turns out that doing a series of inhales,</p>
<p>and of course, each one is followed by an exhale,</p>
<p>10 or 15 times, and then smelling an object like an orange</p>
<p>or another item of food, or even the skin of somebody else,</p>
<p>will lead to an increase in your ability</p>
<p>to perceive those odors.</p>
<p>Now, there are probably two reasons for that.</p>
<p>One reason is that the brain systems of detecting things</p>
<p>are waking up as a mere consequence of inhaling, okay?</p>
<p>So this is sort of the olfactory equivalent</p>
<p>of opening your eyes wider in order to see, more or less.</p>
<p>Okay, last episode, I talked about</p>
<p>how opening your eyes wider</p>
<p>actually increases your level of alertness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that your level of alertness</p>
<p>causes your eyes to be open wider.</p>
<p>Opening your eyes wider</p>
<p>can actually increase your level of alertness.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that breathing more deeply</p>
<p>through the nose wakes up your brain,</p>
<p>and it creates a heightened sensitivity</p>
<p>of the neurons that relate to smell.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a close crossover,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you know this, between smell and taste.</p>
<p>If any of you have ever had a cold,</p>
<p>or for whatever reason, you&rsquo;ve lost your sense of smell,</p>
<p>you become what they call anosmic,</p>
<p>your sense of taste suffers also.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about why that is in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But as a first protocol,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like all of you to consider</p>
<p>becoming nasal breathers while you&rsquo;re trying to learn,</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re trying to listen,</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re trying to wake up your brain in any way</p>
<p>and learn and retain information.</p>
<p>This is a powerful tool.</p>
<p>Now, there are other ways</p>
<p>to wake up your brain more as well.</p>
<p>For instance, the use of smelling salts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending that you do this necessarily,</p>
<p>but there are excellent peer-reviewed data</p>
<p>showing that indeed, if you use smelling salts,</p>
<p>which are mostly of the sort that include ammonia,</p>
<p>ammonia is a very toxic scent,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s toxic in a way that triggers this innate pathway,</p>
<p>the pathway from the nose to the amygdala</p>
<p>and wakes up the brain and body in a major way.</p>
<p>This is why they use smelling salts when people pass out.</p>
<p>This is why fighters used to use,</p>
<p>or maybe sometimes still use,</p>
<p>smelling salts in order to heighten</p>
<p>their level of alertness.</p>
<p>This is why power lifters will inhale smelling salts.</p>
<p>They work because they trigger the fear</p>
<p>and kind of overall arousal systems of the brain.</p>
<p>This is why I think most people probably shouldn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>ammonia or smelling salts to try and wake up,</p>
<p>but they really do work.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever smelled smelling salts, and I have,</p>
<p>I tried this, they give you a serious jolt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like six espresso infused into your bloodstream</p>
<p>all at once.</p>
<p>You are wide awake immediately,</p>
<p>and you feel a heightened sense of kind of desire to move</p>
<p>because you release adrenaline into your body.</p>
<p>Now, inhaling through your nose and doing nasal breathing</p>
<p>is not going to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a more subtle version</p>
<p>of waking up your system, of alerting your brain overall.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are interested in having a richer,</p>
<p>a more deep connection to the things that you smell</p>
<p>and taste, including other individuals, perhaps,</p>
<p>not just food,</p>
<p>practicing or enhancing your sense of sniffing,</p>
<p>your ability to sniff might sound like a kind of</p>
<p>ridiculous protocol, but it&rsquo;s actually a kind of fun</p>
<p>and cool experiment that you can do.</p>
<p>You just do the simple experiment of taking, for instance,</p>
<p>an orange, you smell it,</p>
<p>try and gauge your level of perception</p>
<p>of how orange-ish it smells, or lemon-y, lemon-ish,</p>
<p>lemon-y, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is it lemon-ish or lemon-y?</p>
<p>Lemon-y.</p>
<p>It smells, then set it away.</p>
<p>Do 10 or 15 inhales followed by exhales, of course,</p>
<p>or just through the nose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do all 10 or 15.</p>
<p>And then smell it again,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll notice that your perception of that smell,</p>
<p>the kind of richness of that smell</p>
<p>will be significantly increased.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, again, for two reasons.</p>
<p>One, the brain is in a position to respond to it better.</p>
<p>Your brain has been aroused by the mere act of sniffing,</p>
<p>but also the neurons that respond to that lemon odor,</p>
<p>that lemon-y odor, are going to respond better.</p>
<p>So you can actually have a heightened experience</p>
<p>of something.</p>
<p>And that, of course, will also be true for the taste system.</p>
<p>You also can really train your sense of smell</p>
<p>to get much, much better.</p>
<p>When Noam Sobel&rsquo;s group was at Berkeley,</p>
<p>I happened to be a graduate student around that time,</p>
<p>and every once in a while, I&rsquo;d look outside,</p>
<p>and there would be people crawling around on the grass</p>
<p>with goggles on, gloves on, and these hoods on,</p>
<p>with earmuffs, and they looked ridiculous.</p>
<p>But what they were doing is they were actually learning</p>
<p>to follow scent trails.</p>
<p>So in the world of dogs, you have sight hounds</p>
<p>that use their eyes in order to navigate and find things,</p>
<p>and you have scent hounds that use their nose.</p>
<p>And the scent hounds are remarkable.</p>
<p>They can be trained to detect a scent.</p>
<p>These are the sniffing, the bomb sniffing</p>
<p>and the drug sniffing dogs in airports.</p>
<p>There are now dogs, actually,</p>
<p>that can sniff out COVID infections</p>
<p>with a very high degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>They can be trained to that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the COVID and similar infections</p>
<p>that the body produces probably in the immune response,</p>
<p>some odors, and the dogs are, I think, as high as 90%,</p>
<p>in some cases, maybe even 95% accuracy, just remarkable.</p>
<p>There are theories that dogs can sniff out cancer.</p>
<p>This stuff all exceeds statistical significance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a little bit mysterious in some ways,</p>
<p>but you may not ever achieve</p>
<p>the olfactory capabilities of a scent hound,</p>
<p>but what Noam Sobel&rsquo;s lab did is they had people</p>
<p>completely eliminate their visual experience</p>
<p>by having them wear dark glasses or goggles.</p>
<p>So they couldn&rsquo;t see and they couldn&rsquo;t hear.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t sense anything with their sense of touch.</p>
<p>They had thick gloves on, but they had these masks on</p>
<p>where just their nasal passages were open.</p>
<p>And people could, in a fairly short amount of time,</p>
<p>learn to follow a chocolate scent trail on the ground,</p>
<p>which is not something that most people want to do.</p>
<p>But what they showed using brain imaging, et cetera,</p>
<p>and subsequent studies, is that the human brain,</p>
<p>you can learn to really enhance your sense of smell</p>
<p>and become very astute in distinguishing</p>
<p>whether or not one particular odor</p>
<p>or combinations of odors is such</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s less than or more than a different odor,</p>
<p>for instance.</p>
<p>Now, why would you want to do this?</p>
<p>Well, if you like to eat as much as I do,</p>
<p>one of the things that can really enhance</p>
<p>your sense of pleasure from the experience</p>
<p>of ingesting food is to enhance your sense of smell.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have a great sense of smell,</p>
<p>or if you have a sense of smell that&rsquo;s really so good</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s always picking up bad odors,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about that in a minute,</p>
<p>well, then you might want to tune up your sense of smell</p>
<p>by doing this practice of 10 or 15 breaths,</p>
<p>excuse me, sniffs, not breaths, sniffs,</p>
<p>and then interacting with some food item</p>
<p>or thing that you&rsquo;re interested in smelling more of.</p>
<p>So these could be the ingredients that you&rsquo;re cooking with.</p>
<p>I really encourage you to try and really smell them.</p>
<p>You sometimes hear this as kind of a mindfulness practice,</p>
<p>like, ooh, really smell the food, really taste the food.</p>
<p>And we always hear about that</p>
<p>as kind of a mindfulness and presence thing,</p>
<p>but you actually can increase the sensitivity</p>
<p>of your olfactory and your taste system by doing this.</p>
<p>And it has long-term effects.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing</p>
<p>that you have to do every time you eat.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be the weirdo in the restaurant</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like picking up the radish</p>
<p>and like jamming it up your nostrils.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to necessarily smell everything,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s nice sometimes to smell the food</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re about to eat and as you eat it,</p>
<p>but it has long-term effects in terms of your ability</p>
<p>to distinguish and discriminate different types of odors.</p>
<p>And these don&rsquo;t even have to be very pungent foods,</p>
<p>it turns out.</p>
<p>The studies show that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>some really stinky cheese.</p>
<p>There are cheese shops that I&rsquo;ve walked into</p>
<p>where like, I just basically gag, I can&rsquo;t handle it.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t be in there.</p>
<p>It just overwhelms me.</p>
<p>Other people, they love that smell.</p>
<p>So you have to tune it to your interest and experience,</p>
<p>but I think even for you fasters out there,</p>
<p>everybody eats at some point.</p>
<p>Everybody ingests chemicals through their mouth.</p>
<p>And one of the ways that you can powerfully increase</p>
<p>your relationship to that experience</p>
<p>and make it much more positive</p>
<p>is through just the occasional practice</p>
<p>of 10 or 15 sniffs of nothing,</p>
<p>which almost sounds ridiculous.</p>
<p>Like how could that be?</p>
<p>But now you understand why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of the way that the sniffing action</p>
<p>increases the alertness of the brain,</p>
<p>as well as increasing the sensitivity of the system.</p>
<p>No other system that I&rsquo;m aware of in our body</p>
<p>is as amenable to these kinds of behavioral training shifts</p>
<p>and allow them to happen so quickly.</p>
<p>I would love to be able to tell you</p>
<p>that just doing 10 or 15 near-far exercises with a pen</p>
<p>or going outside for 10 or 15 seconds each morning</p>
<p>is going to completely change the way</p>
<p>that you see the world,</p>
<p>and it actually isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>You actually, it requires more training,</p>
<p>a little bit more effort in the visual system.</p>
<p>In the olfactory system, in your smell system,</p>
<p>and in your taste system,</p>
<p>just the tiniest bit of training and attention</p>
<p>and sniffing, inhaling,</p>
<p>can radically change your relationship to food</p>
<p>such that you actually start to feel very different</p>
<p>as a consequence of ingesting those foods,</p>
<p>as well as becoming more discerning</p>
<p>about which foods you like and which ones you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a really wonderful thing that happens</p>
<p>when you start developing a sensitive palate</p>
<p>and a sensitive sense of smell</p>
<p>in a way that allows you to guide your eating</p>
<p>and smelling decisions,</p>
<p>and maybe even interpersonal decisions</p>
<p>about who you spend time with or mate with or whatever,</p>
<p>in a way that is really in line with your biology.</p>
<p>In fact, how well we can smell and taste things</p>
<p>is actually a very strong indication of our brain health.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not to say</p>
<p>that if you have a poor sense of smell</p>
<p>or a poor sense of taste that you&rsquo;re somehow brain damaged</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going, you know, you&rsquo;re going to have dementia,</p>
<p>although sometimes early signs of dementia</p>
<p>or loss of neurons in other regions of the brain</p>
<p>related to, say, Parkinson&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>can show up first as a loss of sense of smell.</p>
<p>It, again, it&rsquo;s not causal,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s certainly not the case</p>
<p>that every time you have a sudden loss of smell</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s necessarily brain damage.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear about that,</p>
<p>but they are often correlated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of interest right now</p>
<p>in loss of sense of smell</p>
<p>because one of the early detection signs of COVID-19</p>
<p>was a loss of sense of smell.</p>
<p>So I just briefly want to talk about loss of sense of smell</p>
<p>and regaining sense of smell and taste</p>
<p>because these have powerful implications for overall health</p>
<p>and, in fact, can indicate something about brain damage</p>
<p>and can even inform how quickly we might be recovering</p>
<p>from something like a concussion.</p>
<p>So our olfactory neurons,</p>
<p>these neurons in our nose that detect odors,</p>
<p>are really unique among other brain neurons</p>
<p>because they get replenished throughout life.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just regenerate, but they get replenished.</p>
<p>So regeneration is when something is damaged and it regrows.</p>
<p>These neurons are constantly turning over</p>
<p>throughout our lifespan.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly being replenished.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dying off and they&rsquo;re being replaced by new ones.</p>
<p>This is an amazing aspect of our brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically unique to these neurons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one other region of the brain</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a little bit of this maybe,</p>
<p>but these olfactory neurons,</p>
<p>about every three or four weeks, they die.</p>
<p>And when they die, they are replaced by new ones</p>
<p>that come from a different region of the brain,</p>
<p>a region called the subventricular zone.</p>
<p>The name isn&rsquo;t as important as the phenomenon,</p>
<p>but these neurons are born in the ventricle,</p>
<p>the area of your brain that&rsquo;s a hole that contains,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an empty hole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hole basically that contains cerebral spinal fluid.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a little subventricular zone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little zone below, sub, the ventricles,</p>
<p>and that zone, if you are exercising regularly,</p>
<p>if your dopamine levels are high enough,</p>
<p>those little cells there are like stem cells.</p>
<p>They are stem cells and they spit out</p>
<p>what are called little neuroblasts,</p>
<p>those little neuroblasts migrate into the front</p>
<p>of your brain and then shimmy.</p>
<p>They kind of move through what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the rostral migratory stream.</p>
<p>They kind of shimmy along and land</p>
<p>back in your olfactory bulb,</p>
<p>settle down and extend little wires</p>
<p>into your olfactory mucosa.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing process of what we call neurogenesis</p>
<p>or the birth of new neurons.</p>
<p>Now, this is really interesting</p>
<p>because other neurons in your cortex, in your retina,</p>
<p>in your cerebellum, they do not do this.</p>
<p>They are not continually replenished throughout life,</p>
<p>but these neurons, these olfactory neurons are,</p>
<p>they are special.</p>
<p>And there are a number of things</p>
<p>that seem to increase the amount</p>
<p>of olfactory neuron neurogenesis.</p>
<p>There is evidence that exercise, blood flow,</p>
<p>can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Although those data are fewer in comparison</p>
<p>to things like social interactions</p>
<p>or actually interacting with odorants of different kinds.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who doesn&rsquo;t smell things well,</p>
<p>you have a poor sense of smell,</p>
<p>your olfactory system doesn&rsquo;t seem very sensitive,</p>
<p>more sniffing, more smelling is going to be good.</p>
<p>And then the molecule dopamine, this neuromodulator</p>
<p>that is associated with motivation and drive.</p>
<p>And in some cases, if it&rsquo;s very, very high with mania</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s very, very low with depression or Parkinson&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but for most people where dopamine</p>
<p>is in essentially normal ranges,</p>
<p>dopamine is also a powerful trigger</p>
<p>of the establishment of these new neurons</p>
<p>and their migration into the olfactory bulb</p>
<p>and your ability to smell.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t want to confuse correlation with causation.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not good at smelling,</p>
<p>does that mean you have low dopamine?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily.</p>
<p>If you have low dopamine,</p>
<p>does that mean that you have a poor sense of smell?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily.</p>
<p>Some people who take antidepressants of the sort</p>
<p>that impact the dopamine system strongly like Welbutrin</p>
<p>will report a sudden, meaning within a couple of days,</p>
<p>increase in their ability to smell particular odors.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very striking effect.</p>
<p>Some people, when they are in a new relationship,</p>
<p>because dopamine and the hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen are associated with novelty</p>
<p>and the sorts of behaviors that often are associated</p>
<p>with new relationships, those three molecules,</p>
<p>dopamine, testosterone, and estrogen</p>
<p>kind of work together.</p>
<p>And oftentimes people will say or report</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re newly in love or in a new relationship</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just obsessed with,</p>
<p>or they just so enjoy the scent of another person,</p>
<p>so much so that they like to borrow</p>
<p>the other person&rsquo;s clothing,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll sniff the other person&rsquo;s clothing,</p>
<p>or they can even just, in the absence of the person,</p>
<p>they can imagine their smell and feel a biological response,</p>
<p>something that we&rsquo;ll talk more about.</p>
<p>So these neurons turn over throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>And as we age, we actually can lose our sense of smell.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s likely, I want to underscore likely,</p>
<p>that that loss of sense of smell as we age</p>
<p>is correlated with a loss of other neurons</p>
<p>in the retina, in the ears, a loss of vision,</p>
<p>loss of hearing, loss of smell,</p>
<p>loss of the sense apparati, which are neurons,</p>
<p>is correlated with aging.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ve been talking about today</p>
<p>is the ability to sense these odors.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;d like to do is empower you with tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to keep these systems tuned up.</p>
<p>Last time, we talked about tuning up</p>
<p>and keeping your visual system tuned up and healthy,</p>
<p>regardless of age.</p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re talking about really enhancing</p>
<p>your olfactory abilities, your taste abilities,</p>
<p>as well by interacting a lot with odors,</p>
<p>preferably positive odors,</p>
<p>and sniffing more, inhaling more,</p>
<p>which almost sounds crazy, but now you understand why.</p>
<p>Even though it might sound crazy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s grounded in real mechanistic biology</p>
<p>of how the brain wakes up and responds to these chemicals.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of brain injury,</p>
<p>olfactory dysfunction is a common theme</p>
<p>in traumatic brain injury for the following reason.</p>
<p>These olfactory neurons, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>extend wires into the mucosa of the nose,</p>
<p>but they also extend a wire up into the skull,</p>
<p>and they extend up into the skull</p>
<p>through what&rsquo;s called the cribriform plate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a Swiss cheese type plate</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re going through, and if you get a head hit,</p>
<p>that bone, the cribriform plate,</p>
<p>shears those little wires off, and those neurons die.</p>
<p>Now, eventually, they&rsquo;ll be replaced,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a phenomenon by which concussion</p>
<p>and the severity of concussion</p>
<p>and the recovery from a head injury</p>
<p>can actually be gauged in part, in part, not in whole,</p>
<p>but in part by how well or fully</p>
<p>one recovers their sense of smell.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody that unfortunately</p>
<p>has suffered a concussion,</p>
<p>your sense of smell is one readout</p>
<p>by which you might evaluate whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re regaining some of your sensory performance.</p>
<p>Of course, there will be others</p>
<p>like balance and cognition and sleep, et cetera,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to refer you to a really nice paper</p>
<p>which is entitled</p>
<p>Olfactory Dysfunction in Traumatic Brain Injury,</p>
<p>the Role of Neurogenesis.</p>
<p>The first author is Marin, M-A-R-I-N.</p>
<p>The paper was published in Current Allergy and Asthma Report.</p>
<p>This is 2020.</p>
<p>I spent some time with this paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a review article.</p>
<p>I like reviews if they&rsquo;re peer-reviewed reviews</p>
<p>and in quality journals.</p>
<p>And what they discuss is, and I&rsquo;ll just read here briefly</p>
<p>because they said it better than I could.</p>
<p>Olfactory functioning disturbances are common</p>
<p>following traumatic brain injury, TBI,</p>
<p>and can have a significant impact on the quality of life.</p>
<p>Although there&rsquo;s no standard treatment for patients</p>
<p>with the loss of smell.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m paraphrasing, post-injury.</p>
<p>Olfactory training has shown promise for beneficial effects.</p>
<p>Some of this involves, they go on to tell us</p>
<p>the role of dopamine, dopaminergic signaling,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before.</p>
<p>But what does this mean?</p>
<p>This means that if you&rsquo;ve had a head injury</p>
<p>or repeated head injuries,</p>
<p>that enhancing your sense of smell is one way</p>
<p>by which you can create new neurons.</p>
<p>And now you know how to enhance your sense of smell</p>
<p>by interacting with things that have an odor very closely</p>
<p>and by essentially inhaling more,</p>
<p>focusing on the inhale to wake up the brain</p>
<p>and to really focus on some of the nuance of those smells.</p>
<p>So you might do, for instance, a smell test</p>
<p>by which you smell something like a lemon,</p>
<p>put it down, do 10 inhales or so, smell again, et cetera.</p>
<p>You might also just take a more active role</p>
<p>in trying to taste and smell your food</p>
<p>and taste and smell various things.</p>
<p>I mean, please don&rsquo;t ingest anything that&rsquo;s poisonous</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not supposed to be ingesting,</p>
<p>but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Really tuning up the system,</p>
<p>I think this is an excellent review.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do an entire episode</p>
<p>all about the use of the visual system in particular,</p>
<p>but also the olfactory system</p>
<p>for treatment of traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>as well as other methods.</p>
<p>But I wanted to just mention it here</p>
<p>because a number of people asked me about TBI.</p>
<p>And here again, we&rsquo;re in this place where the senses</p>
<p>and our ability to sense these chemicals</p>
<p>through these two holes in the front of our face,</p>
<p>our nostrils, is a powerful readout</p>
<p>and way to control brain function</p>
<p>and nervous system function generally.</p>
<p>Just a quick note about the use of smelling salts.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that some of you may be interested in that</p>
<p>and its application.</p>
<p>If you are interested in that,</p>
<p>I recommend you go to the scientific literature first</p>
<p>rather than straight to some vendor</p>
<p>or to the, what do they call it these days?</p>
<p>Costello?</p>
<p>Bro science, he says.</p>
<p>Bro science, the bro science.</p>
<p>You can go to this paper, which is excellent</p>
<p>and is real science,</p>
<p>which is Acute Effects of Ammonia Inhalants</p>
<p>on Strength and Power Performance in Trained Men.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>It was published in the journal</p>
<p>Strength and Conditioning Research in 2018,</p>
<p>and it should be very easy to find.</p>
<p>I will provide a link to the so-called PubMed ID,</p>
<p>which is a string of numbers,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll put that in the caption</p>
<p>if you want to go straight to that article.</p>
<p>It does show a significant, what they call,</p>
<p>this is what the words they use literally in quotes,</p>
<p>psyching up effect through the use of these ammonia</p>
<p>inhalants and a significant increase in maximal force,</p>
<p>in force development, in a variety of different movements.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,</p>
<p>that might be a good reference.</p>
<p>The other thing I wanted to talk about</p>
<p>with reference to odors is this myth,</p>
<p>which is that we don&rsquo;t actually smell things in our dreams,</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have a sense of smell.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pure fiction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who came up with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that we are capable</p>
<p>of smelling things in our sleep.</p>
<p>However, when we are in REM sleep,</p>
<p>rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>which is the sleep that predominates</p>
<p>toward the second half of the night,</p>
<p>our ability to wake up in response to odors is diminished.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not absent, but it&rsquo;s diminished.</p>
<p>If smoke comes into the room, we will likely wake up</p>
<p>if the concentration of smoke is high enough,</p>
<p>regardless of the stage of sleep we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>But in REM sleep, we tend to be less likely</p>
<p>to smell, to sniff.</p>
<p>And that actually was measured in a number of studies</p>
<p>that sniffing in sleep is possible.</p>
<p>So if you put an odor like a lemon</p>
<p>underneath someone&rsquo;s nostrils</p>
<p>in the early portion of the night,</p>
<p>they will smell and they will later,</p>
<p>they will sniff, excuse me,</p>
<p>whether or not they smell or not,</p>
<p>I guess depends on them and when they showered last,</p>
<p>but they will definitely sniff.</p>
<p>And they will report later,</p>
<p>especially if you wake them up soon after,</p>
<p>that they had a dream or a percept</p>
<p>of the scent of a lemon, for instance.</p>
<p>Later in the night, it&rsquo;s harder for that relationship</p>
<p>to be established.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely that because of some of the paralysis</p>
<p>associated with rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>which is a healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to act out your dreams in REM sleep,</p>
<p>that there is a less active tendency to sniff.</p>
<p>And actually this has real clinical implications.</p>
<p>The ability to sniff in response</p>
<p>to the introduction of an odor is actually one way</p>
<p>in which clinicians assess whether or not somebody&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>is so-called brain dead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a nice term, but brain dead,</p>
<p>or whether or not they have the capacity to recover</p>
<p>from things like coma and other states</p>
<p>of deep unconsciousness,</p>
<p>or I guess you&rsquo;d call it subconsciousness.</p>
<p>So what will happen is if someone has an injury</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re essentially out cold,</p>
<p>the production of a sniffing reflex</p>
<p>or a sniffing response to say a lemon</p>
<p>or some other odor presented below the nostrils</p>
<p>is considered a sign that the brain</p>
<p>is capable of waking up.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not always the case, but it&rsquo;s one indication.</p>
<p>So just like you could use mechanosensation,</p>
<p>so a toe pinch, for instance,</p>
<p>or scraping the bottom of somebody&rsquo;s bare foot</p>
<p>to see if they&rsquo;re conscious,</p>
<p>or shining light in their eyes.</p>
<p>These are all things that you&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in movies and television,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;ve seen in real life as well.</p>
<p>Well, odors and chemical sensing</p>
<p>is another way by which you can assess</p>
<p>whether or not the brain is capable of arousal.</p>
<p>And actually olfactory stimulation</p>
<p>is one of the more prominent ones</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being used in various clinics.</p>
<p>As a last point about specific odors and compounds</p>
<p>that can increase arousal and alertness,</p>
<p>and this was simply through sniffing them,</p>
<p>not through ingesting them.</p>
<p>There are data, believe it or not,</p>
<p>there are good data on peppermint</p>
<p>and the smell of peppermint.</p>
<p>Minty type scents, whether you like them or not,</p>
<p>will increase attention</p>
<p>and they can create the same sort of arousal response,</p>
<p>although not as intensely or as dramatically</p>
<p>as ammonia salts can, for instance.</p>
<p>By the way, please don&rsquo;t go sniff real ammonia.</p>
<p>You could actually damage your olfactory epithelium</p>
<p>if you do that too close to the ammonia.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to use smelling salts,</p>
<p>be sure you work with someone</p>
<p>or you know what you&rsquo;re getting and how you&rsquo;re using this.</p>
<p>You can damage your olfactory pathway</p>
<p>in ways that are pretty severe.</p>
<p>You can also damage your vision.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever teared up</p>
<p>because you inhaled something that was really noxious,</p>
<p>that is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean you necessarily cause damage,</p>
<p>but it means that you have irritated the mucosal lining</p>
<p>and possibly even the surfaces of your eyes.</p>
<p>So please be very, very careful.</p>
<p>Scents like peppermint, like these ammonia smelling salts,</p>
<p>the reason they wake you up</p>
<p>is because they trigger specific olfactory neurons</p>
<p>that communicate with the specific centers of the brain,</p>
<p>namely the amygdala</p>
<p>and associated neural circuitry and pathways</p>
<p>that trigger alertness of the same sort</p>
<p>that a cold shower or an ice bath or a sudden surprise</p>
<p>or a stressful text message would evoke.</p>
<p>Remember, the systems of your body</p>
<p>that produce arousal and alertness and attention</p>
<p>and that cue you for optimal learning, aka focus,</p>
<p>those are very general mechanisms.</p>
<p>They involve very basic molecules</p>
<p>like adrenaline and epinephrine.</p>
<p>Same thing, actually, adrenaline, epinephrine.</p>
<p>The number of stimuli, whether it&rsquo;s peppermint or ammonia</p>
<p>or a loud blast, the number of stimuli</p>
<p>that can evoke that adrenaline response</p>
<p>and that wake-up response are near infinite.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the beauty of your nervous system.</p>
<p>It was designed to take any variety of different stimuli,</p>
<p>place them into categories,</p>
<p>and then evoke different categories</p>
<p>of very general responses.</p>
<p>Now you know a lot about olfaction</p>
<p>and how the sense of smell works.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another experiment that you can do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask you right now.</p>
<p>Do you like, hate, or are you indifferent</p>
<p>to the smell of microwave popcorn?</p>
<p>Some people, including one member of my podcast staff,</p>
<p>says it&rsquo;s absolutely disgusting to them.</p>
<p>They feel like it&rsquo;s completely nauseating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind it at all.</p>
<p>In fact, I kind of like it.</p>
<p>I think the smell of microwave popcorn is kind of pleasant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly like it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s certainly not unpleasant.</p>
<p>Some people have a gene that makes them sensitive</p>
<p>to the smell of things like microwave popcorn,</p>
<p>such that it smells like vomit.</p>
<p>I probably don&rsquo;t have that gene</p>
<p>because I find the smell of microwave popcorn</p>
<p>pretty pleasant.</p>
<p>Some people hate the smell of cilantro.</p>
<p>Some people ingest asparagus,</p>
<p>and when they urinate,</p>
<p>they can smell the asparagus in a very pungent way.</p>
<p>Other people can&rsquo;t smell it at all.</p>
<p>These are variants in genes that encode</p>
<p>for what are called olfactory receptors.</p>
<p>Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene,</p>
<p>one gene that codes for a receptor</p>
<p>that responds to a particular odor.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that gene,</p>
<p>you will not respond to that odor.</p>
<p>So the reason why some people find the smell</p>
<p>of microwave popcorn to be very noxious, putrid in fact,</p>
<p>is because they have a gene that allows them</p>
<p>to smell the kind of putrid odor within that.</p>
<p>Other people who lack that gene just simply can&rsquo;t smell it.</p>
<p>So we are not all the same</p>
<p>with respect to our sensory experience.</p>
<p>What one person finds delicious,</p>
<p>another person might find disgusting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give a good example,</p>
<p>which is that I absolutely despise</p>
<p>gorgonzola and blue cheese.</p>
<p>I absolutely despise it.</p>
<p>It smells and tastes like dirty, moldy socks to me.</p>
<p>Some people love it, they crave it.</p>
<p>Actually, some people get a visceral response to it.</p>
<p>And we will talk about how certain tastes</p>
<p>can actually evoke very deep biological responses,</p>
<p>even hormonal responses</p>
<p>when we talk about taste in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But there are these odors.</p>
<p>For instance, in popcorn,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrrolene,</p>
<p>not proline, but pyrrolene,</p>
<p>that gives off to some people like me a toasted smell</p>
<p>as the sugars in the kernels heat.</p>
<p>But the compound is also found in things</p>
<p>like white bread and jasmine rice,</p>
<p>which don&rsquo;t have as pungent an odor.</p>
<p>But some people smell that and it smells like cat urine.</p>
<p>Now there are scents like musky scents and musty scents</p>
<p>that are secreted by animals like skunks</p>
<p>and other animals of the so-called mustelid family.</p>
<p>So these would be ferrets and other animals</p>
<p>that can spray in response to fear</p>
<p>or if they just want to mark a territory</p>
<p>because they want to say, that&rsquo;s mine.</p>
<p>Dogs incidentally have scent glands</p>
<p>that they rub on things, cats have them too.</p>
<p>This musty odor, some people find actually quite pleasant.</p>
<p>Some people find it to be very noxious</p>
<p>and that will depend, of course, on the concentration, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget the first time Costello</p>
<p>got sprayed by a skunk and it was awful.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t mind the smell of skunk at a distance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a little bit pleasant.</p>
<p>I admit it&rsquo;s a little bit pleasant to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that makes me too weird</p>
<p>because if you ever read the book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All&rsquo;s Quiet on the Western Front&rsquo; about World War I&rsquo;,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a description in there</p>
<p>about the smell of skunk at a distance</p>
<p>being mildly pleasant.</p>
<p>So the author of that book probably shared</p>
<p>a similar olfactory profile to me or I to them rather.</p>
<p>But some people find even the tiniest bit</p>
<p>of the smell of skunk or must to be noxious or awful.</p>
<p>Now, of course, in high concentrations, it&rsquo;s really awful.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, poor Costello,</p>
<p>he was like literally red-eyed and just snorting</p>
<p>and it was awful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a joke about dogs that says that dogs</p>
<p>either get skunked one time and never again</p>
<p>or 50 or 100 times.</p>
<p>Costello has been skunked no fewer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making this up,</p>
<p>has been skunked no fewer than 103 times.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because if he sees something</p>
<p>or hears something in the bushes,</p>
<p>he just goes straight in, he does not learn.</p>
<p>But if you like the musty scent or musky scent,</p>
<p>well, that says something about the genes</p>
<p>that you express in your olfactory neurons.</p>
<p>It is completely inherited.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like that scent, if it&rsquo;s really noxious</p>
<p>or you have this response to microwave popcorn,</p>
<p>well, that means you have a different complement,</p>
<p>a different constellation, if you will,</p>
<p>of genes that make up for these olfactory sensory neurons</p>
<p>and the receptors that they express.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about taste.</p>
<p>Not whether or not you have taste or you don&rsquo;t have taste,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way for me to assess that,</p>
<p>but rather how we taste things,</p>
<p>meaning how we sense chemicals in food and in drink.</p>
<p>There are essentially five,</p>
<p>but scientists now believe there may be six things</p>
<p>that we taste alone or in combination.</p>
<p>They are sweet tastes, salty tastes,</p>
<p>bitter tastes, sour tastes, and umami taste.</p>
<p>Most of you have probably heard of umami by now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s U-M-A-M-I.</p>
<p>Umami is actually the name for a particular receptor</p>
<p>that you express on your tongue that detects savory tastes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the kind of thing in braised meats.</p>
<p>Sometimes people can even get the activation of umami</p>
<p>by tomatoes or tomato sauces.</p>
<p>What are each of these tastes</p>
<p>and taste receptors responsible for?</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll talk about the sixth.</p>
<p>Maybe you can guess what it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can guess it now.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t guess it, but of the five tastes,</p>
<p>each one has a specific utility or function.</p>
<p>Each one has a particular group of neurons in your mouth,</p>
<p>in your tongue, believe it or not,</p>
<p>that responds to particular chemicals</p>
<p>and particular chemical structures.</p>
<p>It is a total myth, complete fiction,</p>
<p>that different parts of your tongue</p>
<p>harbor different taste receptors.</p>
<p>You know, that high school textbook diagram</p>
<p>that, you know, sweet is in one part of the tongue</p>
<p>and sour is in another and bitter is in another,</p>
<p>complete fiction, just total fiction</p>
<p>related to very old studies that were performed</p>
<p>in a very poorly controlled way.</p>
<p>No serious biologists,</p>
<p>and certainly no one that works on tastes,</p>
<p>would contend that that&rsquo;s the way</p>
<p>that the taste receptors are organized.</p>
<p>They are completely intermixed along your tongue.</p>
<p>If you have heightened or decreased sensitivity</p>
<p>to one of those five things I mentioned,</p>
<p>sweet, salty, bitter, umami, or sour,</p>
<p>at one location in your tongue,</p>
<p>it likely reflects the density of overall receptors</p>
<p>or something going on in your brain,</p>
<p>but not the differential distribution of those receptors.</p>
<p>So the sweet receptors are neurons that express a receptor.</p>
<p>That respond to sugars in the same way</p>
<p>that you have cones, photoreceptors in your eye</p>
<p>that respond to short, medium, or long wavelength light,</p>
<p>meaning blue-ish, green-ish, or reddish light.</p>
<p>You have a neuron in, or neurons, plural, in your tongue</p>
<p>that respond to sugars.</p>
<p>And then those neurons, they don&rsquo;t say sweet.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually send any sugar into the brain.</p>
<p>They send what we call a volley,</p>
<p>a barrage of action potentials,</p>
<p>of electrical signals off into the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing system.</p>
<p>So all these receptors in your tongue</p>
<p>make up what are called the neurons</p>
<p>that give rise to a nerve, a collection of wires,</p>
<p>nerve bundles of what&rsquo;s called the gustatory nerve.</p>
<p>It goes from the tongue</p>
<p>to the so-called nucleus of the solitary tracts.</p>
<p>And some of you requested names.</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t like to include too many names</p>
<p>for sake of clarity,</p>
<p>but the gustatory nerve from the tongue</p>
<p>goes to the nucleus of the solitary tract</p>
<p>and then to the thalamus and to insular cortex.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to remember any of those names</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>but if you want mechanism, you want neural circuits,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the circuit.</p>
<p>Gustatory nerve from the tongue,</p>
<p>nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem,</p>
<p>then the thalamus, and then insular cortex.</p>
<p>And it is an insular cortex, this region of our cortex,</p>
<p>that we sort out and make sense of</p>
<p>and perceive the various tastes.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s amazing because just taking a little bit of sugar</p>
<p>or something sour, like a little bit of lemon juice,</p>
<p>and touching it to the tongue</p>
<p>within 100 milliseconds, right?</p>
<p>Just 100 milliseconds, far less than one second,</p>
<p>you can immediately distinguish,</p>
<p>ah, that&rsquo;s sour, that&rsquo;s sweet, that&rsquo;s bitter, that&rsquo;s umami.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an assessment that&rsquo;s made by the cortex.</p>
<p>Now, what do these different five receptors encode for?</p>
<p>Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,</p>
<p>but what are they really looking for?</p>
<p>What are they sensing?</p>
<p>Well, sweet stuff signals the presence of energy, of sugars.</p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re all trying or we&rsquo;re told</p>
<p>that we should eat less sugar for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>the ability to sense whether or not a food</p>
<p>has rapid energy source or could give rise to glucose</p>
<p>is essential, so we have sweet receptors.</p>
<p>The salty receptors, these neurons,</p>
<p>are trying to sense whether or not there are electrolytes</p>
<p>in a given food or drink.</p>
<p>Electrolytes are vitally important</p>
<p>for the function of our nervous system</p>
<p>and for our entire body.</p>
<p>Sodium is what allows neurons to fire,</p>
<p>what allows them to be electrically active.</p>
<p>We also need potassium and magnesium.</p>
<p>Those are the ions that allow the neurons to be active.</p>
<p>So the salty receptors, the reason that they are there</p>
<p>is to make sure that we are getting enough,</p>
<p>but not too much salt.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to ingest things that are far too salty.</p>
<p>Bitter receptors are there to make sure</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t ingest things that are poisonous.</p>
<p>How do I know this?</p>
<p>How can I say that, even though I was definitely</p>
<p>not consulted at the design phase?</p>
<p>How can I say that?</p>
<p>Well, the bitter receptors create a,</p>
<p>what we call labeled line, a unique trajectory</p>
<p>to the neurons of the brainstem</p>
<p>that control the gag reflex.</p>
<p>If we taste something very bitter,</p>
<p>it automatically triggers the gag reflex.</p>
<p>Now, some people like bitter taste.</p>
<p>I actually like to taste a bitter coffee.</p>
<p>Children generally like sweet tastes more than bitter tastes,</p>
<p>but even babies, if they taste something bitter,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just immediately spit it up as like the gag reflex.</p>
<p>Putrid smells will also evoke these same neurons.</p>
<p>So some people are very sensitive.</p>
<p>They have a very sensitive or low threshold vomit reflex.</p>
<p>There was somebody in my lab early on.</p>
<p>We never did this intentionally.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just laughing because it was so dramatic.</p>
<p>We would have a discussion.</p>
<p>Someone would say something about something kind of gross,</p>
<p>appropriate for the workplace, but nonetheless gross.</p>
<p>We are biologists.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d say something and they would say,</p>
<p>stop, stop, stop, I&rsquo;m going to throw up, you know?</p>
<p>And some people have a very low threshold,</p>
<p>quick gag reflex.</p>
<p>Other people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Other people have a very stable stomach.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, you know, they rarely, if ever, vomit.</p>
<p>The umami receptor isn&rsquo;t sensing savory</p>
<p>because the body loves savory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because savory is a signal</p>
<p>for the presence of amino acids.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk more about this,</p>
<p>but the presence of amino acids in our gut</p>
<p>and in our digestive system</p>
<p>and the presence of fatty acids is essential.</p>
<p>There is in fact no essential carbohydrate or sugar.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not a huge proponent of ketogenic diets,</p>
<p>nor am I against them.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s highly individual.</p>
<p>You have to decide what&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>But everybody needs amino acids to survive.</p>
<p>The brain needs them and we need fatty acids,</p>
<p>especially to build a healthy brain during development.</p>
<p>You need amino acids and fatty acids.</p>
<p>And the sour receptor, why would we have a sour receptor</p>
<p>so that we could have those really like sour candies?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve gotten more and more sour over the years.</p>
<p>I admit, I don&rsquo;t eat candy much,</p>
<p>but I do have a particular weakness</p>
<p>for like a really good, really sour, like gummy peach,</p>
<p>or if the gummy cherries are dipped</p>
<p>in whatever that sour powder.</p>
<p>So I was a kid who, I admit it,</p>
<p>I liked the Lick-O-Mate thing.</p>
<p>I like drink the powder.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give this garbage to your kids.</p>
<p>But I liked it.</p>
<p>It was tasty.</p>
<p>But sour receptors are not there</p>
<p>so that you can ingest gummy, sour gummy peaches</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not why the system evolved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there and we know it&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>to detect the presence of spoiled or fermented food.</p>
<p>Fermented fruit has a sour element to it.</p>
<p>And fermented things,</p>
<p>while certainly some fermented foods like sauerkraut</p>
<p>and kimchi and things of that sort</p>
<p>can be very healthy for us and are very healthy</p>
<p>in reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>There are great data on that.</p>
<p>Pro quality microbiome, et cetera.</p>
<p>Fermented fruit can be poisonous, right?</p>
<p>Alcohols are poisonous in many forms to our system.</p>
<p>And the sour receptor bearing neurons</p>
<p>communicate to an area of the brainstem</p>
<p>that evokes the pucker response.</p>
<p>Closing of the eyes and essentially shutting of the mouth</p>
<p>and cringing away.</p>
<p>I think cringe is like a thing now my niece,</p>
<p>whenever I seem to say something or do something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either an eye roll, a cringe or both in combination.</p>
<p>So the sour, the sweet, the salty, the bitter</p>
<p>and the umami system,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not there so that we could have this wonderful palette</p>
<p>of foods that we enjoy so much.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll allow us to do that,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re there to make sure</p>
<p>that we bring in certain things to our system</p>
<p>and that we don&rsquo;t ingest other things.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s the sixth sense within the taste system?</p>
<p>Not sixth sense generally, but within the taste system.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this putative possible sixth receptor?</p>
<p>I already kind of hinted at it</p>
<p>when I talked about fatty acids.</p>
<p>There are now data to support the idea,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s still more work that needs to be done,</p>
<p>that we also have receptors on our tongue that sense fat.</p>
<p>And that because fat is so vital</p>
<p>for the function of our nervous system</p>
<p>and the other organs of our body,</p>
<p>that we are sensing the fat content in food.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why I can only eat half,</p>
<p>but no less than half of a jar of almond butter</p>
<p>or peanut butter in one sitting.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t, unless it&rsquo;s not salted,</p>
<p>in which case it makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s remarkable how that texture</p>
<p>and also the flavor, but that texture of fat,</p>
<p>I love butter.</p>
<p>I am guilty, and Costello is definitely guilty</p>
<p>of eating pats of butter from time to time.</p>
<p>I have no guilt about this.</p>
<p>People eat pats of cheese.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t we eat a pat of butter?</p>
<p>If you think that&rsquo;s gross,</p>
<p>then maybe I have greater abundance</p>
<p>of the fat receptors in my tongue.</p>
<p>Maybe I have a fat tongue than you do.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, the ability to sense fat</p>
<p>here in our mouth seems to be critical.</p>
<p>You can imagine why that is.</p>
<p>I want to talk about the tongue and the mouth</p>
<p>as an extension of your digestive tract.</p>
<p>I know that might not be pleasant to think about,</p>
<p>but when you look at it through the lens</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m about to provide,</p>
<p>it will completely change the way you think</p>
<p>about the gut brain and about all the stuff</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve heard in these recent years about,</p>
<p>oh, you know, we have this second brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all these neurons in our gut.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been chuckling through these last few years</p>
<p>as people have gotten so excited about the gut brain,</p>
<p>not because of their excitement.</p>
<p>I think their excitement is wonderful,</p>
<p>but we always knew that the nervous system extended</p>
<p>out of the brain and into the body.</p>
<p>And people seem kind of overwhelmed and surprised</p>
<p>by the idea that we have neurons in our gut</p>
<p>that can sense things like sugars and fatty acids.</p>
<p>And I think those are beautiful discoveries.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>Diego Borges&rsquo; lab out of Duke University</p>
<p>has done beautiful studies showing</p>
<p>that within the mucosal lining of our gut,</p>
<p>we have neurons that sense fatty acids,</p>
<p>sugars, and amino acids.</p>
<p>And that when we ingest something that contains one</p>
<p>or two or three of those things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a signal sent via the vagus nerve</p>
<p>up into what&rsquo;s called the no-dose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,</p>
<p>and then into the brain where it secretes dopamine,</p>
<p>which makes us want more of that thing.</p>
<p>It makes us more motivated to pursue</p>
<p>and eat more of that thing that&rsquo;s either fatty</p>
<p>or umami, it&rsquo;s savory, or has a sweet taste,</p>
<p>any one or two or three of those qualities,</p>
<p>independent of the taste.</p>
<p>Now, I think those are beautiful data,</p>
<p>but we know that this thing, the mouth,</p>
<p>for those of you listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just got a couple of fingers in my mouth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I sound like I&rsquo;m got something in my mouth.</p>
<p>This thing in the front of our face,</p>
<p>we use it for speaking,</p>
<p>but it is the front of our digestive tract.</p>
<p>We are essentially a series of tubes.</p>
<p>And that tube starts with your mouth</p>
<p>and heads down into your stomach.</p>
<p>And so that you would sense so much</p>
<p>of the chemical constituents of the stuff</p>
<p>that you might bring into your body</p>
<p>or that you might want to expel</p>
<p>and not swallow or not interact with</p>
<p>by being able to smell it.</p>
<p>Is it putrid?</p>
<p>Does it smell good?</p>
<p>Does it taste good?</p>
<p>Is this safe?</p>
<p>Is it salty?</p>
<p>Is it so sour that it&rsquo;s fermented and is going to poison me?</p>
<p>Is it so bitter that it could poison me?</p>
<p>Is it so savory that, mm, yes,</p>
<p>I want more and more of this?</p>
<p>Well, then you&rsquo;d want to trigger dopamine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all starting in the mouth.</p>
<p>So you have to understand that you were equipped</p>
<p>with this amazing chemical sensing apparatus</p>
<p>we call your mouth and your tongue.</p>
<p>And those little bumps on your tongue</p>
<p>that they call the papillae,</p>
<p>those are not your taste buds.</p>
<p>Surrounding those little papillae,</p>
<p>like little rivers,</p>
<p>are these little dents and indentations.</p>
<p>And what dents and indentations do in a tissue</p>
<p>is they allow more surface area.</p>
<p>They allow you to pack more receptors.</p>
<p>So down in those grooves</p>
<p>are where all these little neurons</p>
<p>and their little processes are</p>
<p>with these little receptors for sweet, salty,</p>
<p>bitter, umami, sour, and maybe fat as well.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this incredible device</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been equipped with</p>
<p>that you can use to interact with various components</p>
<p>of the outside world</p>
<p>and decide whether or not you want to bring them in or not.</p>
<p>Just as you can lose those olfactory neurons</p>
<p>if you happen to get hit on the head</p>
<p>or you have some other thing,</p>
<p>maybe it was an infection</p>
<p>that caused loss of those olfactory sensory neurons,</p>
<p>you can also lose taste receptors in your mouth.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever eaten something that&rsquo;s too hot,</p>
<p>not spicy hot, but too hot,</p>
<p>you burn your tongue, you burn receptors.</p>
<p>It takes about a week to recover those receptors.</p>
<p>For some people, it&rsquo;s a little bit more quickly,</p>
<p>but if you burn your tongue badly</p>
<p>by ingesting a soup that&rsquo;s too hot</p>
<p>or a beverage that&rsquo;s too hot,</p>
<p>you will greatly reduce your sense of taste</p>
<p>for essentially all tastes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because those neurons sit very shallow</p>
<p>beneath the tongue surface.</p>
<p>And so that if you put something too hot on it,</p>
<p>you literally just burn those neurons away.</p>
<p>Luckily, those neurons also can replenish themselves.</p>
<p>Those neurons are of the peripheral nervous system.</p>
<p>And like all peripheral system neurons,</p>
<p>they can replenish or regenerate.</p>
<p>So if you burn your mouth in about a week or so,</p>
<p>hopefully sooner, you&rsquo;ll be able to taste again.</p>
<p>In fact, everybody&rsquo;s ability to taste</p>
<p>is highly subject to training.</p>
<p>You can really enhance your ability to taste</p>
<p>and taste the different component parts of different foods</p>
<p>simply by paying attention to what you&rsquo;re trying to taste.</p>
<p>This is an amazing aspect of the taste system.</p>
<p>I think more than any other system,</p>
<p>the taste system and perhaps the smell system as well</p>
<p>can be trained so that you can learn</p>
<p>to pick out the tones, if you will,</p>
<p>of different ice cream or different beverages.</p>
<p>Somebody who, I don&rsquo;t drink much alcohol,</p>
<p>I occasionally have a drink or something,</p>
<p>but a while ago I got to taste</p>
<p>a bunch of different white tequilas.</p>
<p>These are different kinds of tequilas that are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not brown, they&rsquo;re white.</p>
<p>And I sort of assumed that all tequila was disgusting.</p>
<p>That was my assumption before doing this.</p>
<p>And then I tasted a couple of white tequilas</p>
<p>and I realized, oh, those aren&rsquo;t too bad.</p>
<p>I tasted a few more.</p>
<p>And then pretty soon I could really start</p>
<p>to detect the nuance and the difference.</p>
<p>Now, I haven&rsquo;t had tequila in a long time now.</p>
<p>I sort of tend to not drink it all these days.</p>
<p>But in a very short period of time, like a couple of days,</p>
<p>I got very good at detecting which things I liked</p>
<p>and I could start to pick out tones.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a wine drinker, but for those of you that are,</p>
<p>you hear about, oh, it has floral tones</p>
<p>or berry tones or chocolate tones.</p>
<p>Some of that is just kind of menu-based</p>
<p>and kind of marketing-based silliness</p>
<p>designed to get you excited</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re about to ingest.</p>
<p>But some of it is real.</p>
<p>And for people that are skilled in assessing wines</p>
<p>or assessing foods, much more of an eater than a drinker,</p>
<p>you can really start to develop a sensitive palate,</p>
<p>a nuanced palate through what we call top-down mechanisms.</p>
<p>This olfactory cortex that takes these five,</p>
<p>maybe the sixth fat receptor two information</p>
<p>and tries to make sense of what&rsquo;s out there in the world</p>
<p>and what its utility is.</p>
<p>Is it good?</p>
<p>Is it bad?</p>
<p>Do I want more of it or less than it?</p>
<p>That neural circuitry is unlike other neural circuitry</p>
<p>in that it seems very amenable to behavioral plasticity</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>And we could talk about what those reasons might be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting sometimes to think about</p>
<p>how your taste literally, chemical taste,</p>
<p>is probably very different than that of other people.</p>
<p>How a food tastes to you is probably very different</p>
<p>than how it tastes to somebody else.</p>
<p>The same probably cannot be said</p>
<p>of something like vision or hearing,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re somebody who has perfect pitch</p>
<p>or your color vision is disrupted or you&rsquo;re a mantis shrimp,</p>
<p>chances are when you look at the same object,</p>
<p>two people are seeing more or less the same object</p>
<p>or perceiving it in a very similar way.</p>
<p>There are experiments that essentially establish that.</p>
<p>Now we have taste receptors</p>
<p>and a lot of those taste receptors,</p>
<p>their chemical structures are known.</p>
<p>They come with fancy names like the T1R1 or the T1R2,</p>
<p>which were identified as the sweet and umami receptor.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting is that this umami flavor</p>
<p>is the savory flavor rather that&rsquo;s sensed by umami receptors</p>
<p>is very close to the receptor that detects sweet things.</p>
<p>Similarly, bitter is sensed</p>
<p>by a whole other set of receptors.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a fun naturally occurring experiment</p>
<p>that will forever change the way that you look at animals</p>
<p>and the way certainly that I think about dogs</p>
<p>and Costello in particular.</p>
<p>Carnivorous large animals like tigers</p>
<p>and some grizzly bears, for instance,</p>
<p>we know that they have no ability to detect sweet.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually have the receptors</p>
<p>for detecting sweet on their tongue,</p>
<p>but their concentration of umami receptors</p>
<p>of their ability to detect savory</p>
<p>is at least 5,000 times that which it is in humans.</p>
<p>In other words, if I eat a little piece of steak</p>
<p>or Costello eats a little piece of steak,</p>
<p>that steak probably tastes much, much more savory</p>
<p>than it does to me.</p>
<p>So dogs and tigers and bears, et cetera,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to taste savory things and smell savory things</p>
<p>with a much higher degree of sensitivity,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t taste sweet things.</p>
<p>Other large animals, which are mostly herbivores</p>
<p>like the panda bear, for instance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to believe that thing is even a bear.</p>
<p>I got nothing against pandas.</p>
<p>I just think that they get a little bit too much</p>
<p>of the limelight, frankly.</p>
<p>So no vendetta against pandas, save the pandas.</p>
<p>I hope they replenish all the pandas,</p>
<p>but pandas in all their whatever have no umami receptors.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t taste savory,</p>
<p>but they have greatly heightened density of sweet receptors.</p>
<p>So there they are eating these whatever bamboos all day</p>
<p>or not bamboozle, but bamboos all day.</p>
<p>And they can taste things that are very sweet</p>
<p>with a much higher degree of intensity.</p>
<p>And in general, animals that are more gentle,</p>
<p>that are herbivores, excuse me,</p>
<p>or animals that have the propensity for aggression,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you really see the divergence</p>
<p>of the umami receptor because it&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with meat and amino acids,</p>
<p>and where you see the enhancement of the sweet receptors</p>
<p>for animals that eat a lot of plants and fruits.</p>
<p>And they probably taste very different to them</p>
<p>than they do to you and me.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting to note that animals that eat meat,</p>
<p>that eat other organisms,</p>
<p>can actually extract more savory experience from that.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you?</p>
<p>All right, do you associate yourself as a tiger</p>
<p>or a grizzly bear or a panda or a combination of both?</p>
<p>Most people are omnivores.</p>
<p>However, you may find it interesting that people that,</p>
<p>for instance, eat a pure carnivore type diet</p>
<p>or a keto diet where they are ingesting a lot of meats,</p>
<p>so therefore are sensing a lot of umami flavors.</p>
<p>And I realize not everyone who&rsquo;s keto eats meat,</p>
<p>but those who do that will develop a more sensitive palate</p>
<p>and likely there are some data,</p>
<p>although early data, craving for umami-like foods.</p>
<p>Whereas people that eat a more plant-based diet</p>
<p>are likely developing a heightened sensitivity</p>
<p>and desire for, and maybe even dopamine response</p>
<p>to sugars and plant-based foods.</p>
<p>Now, this is my partial attempt to reconcile</p>
<p>the kind of online battle that seems to exist</p>
<p>between plant-based versus animal-based,</p>
<p>purely plant-based or purely animal-based diets.</p>
<p>I think most people are omnivores,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think that the systems</p>
<p>are plastic such that people might want more meat</p>
<p>if they eat more meat.</p>
<p>People might want more plants if they eat enough plants</p>
<p>for a long period of time.</p>
<p>And this might explain some of the chasm</p>
<p>that exists between these two groups.</p>
<p>Now, this is not to say anything about the ethical</p>
<p>or the environmental impacts of different things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want to get into that</p>
<p>because the meat people say that the plant-based diets</p>
<p>have as much a negative impact</p>
<p>as the plant people say that the meat-based diets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a totally different discussion.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about here is food craving and food seeking</p>
<p>and one&rsquo;s ability to detect these umami savory flavors</p>
<p>is going to be enhanced by ingesting more meat</p>
<p>and less activation of the sweet receptor.</p>
<p>So in other words, the more meat you eat,</p>
<p>the more you&rsquo;re going to become like a tiger, so to speak.</p>
<p>And the more that you avoid these umami flavors and meats,</p>
<p>and the more that you would eat plant-based foods</p>
<p>and in particular sweet foods,</p>
<p>the more you will likely suppress that umami system</p>
<p>and that you will have a heightened desire for,</p>
<p>appetite for, and sensing of sweet foods</p>
<p>or foods that contain sugars.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to tell you is going to seem crazy</p>
<p>but is extremely interesting</p>
<p>with respect to taste and taste receptors.</p>
<p>Remember, even though we can enjoy food</p>
<p>and we can evolve our sense of what&rsquo;s tasty or not tasty,</p>
<p>depending on life decisions,</p>
<p>environmental changes, et cetera,</p>
<p>the taste system, just like the olfactory system</p>
<p>and the visual system was laid down for the purpose</p>
<p>of moving towards things that are good for us</p>
<p>and moving away from things that are bad for us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of core function of the nervous system.</p>
<p>Well, taste receptors are not just expressed on the tongue.</p>
<p>They are expressed in other cells and other tissues as well.</p>
<p>Some of you may be able to imagine foods</p>
<p>that are so delicious to you</p>
<p>that they make your entire body feel good</p>
<p>or foods that are so horrifically awful to think about,</p>
<p>let alone taste, that they create a whole body shuddering</p>
<p>or kind of repellent type response</p>
<p>where you just either cringe or turn your face away,</p>
<p>even in the absence of that food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of how I feel about pungent gorgonzola cheese.</p>
<p>If you like gorgonzola cheese, I don&rsquo;t judge you.</p>
<p>I just, that&rsquo;s an individual difference.</p>
<p>I happen to love certain foods.</p>
<p>I do like savory foods very much.</p>
<p>When I think about them, they make me feel good.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m oftentimes not even associating</p>
<p>with the taste of those foods.</p>
<p>It feels almost like a visceral thing.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that some of the taste receptors</p>
<p>extend beyond the tongue,</p>
<p>that they actually can extend into portions</p>
<p>of the gut and digestive system.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s not strange enough,</p>
<p>turns out that some of the taste receptors</p>
<p>are actually expressed on the ovaries and the testes.</p>
<p>So what that means is that the gonads,</p>
<p>the very cells and tissues and organs in our body</p>
<p>that make up the reproductive axis</p>
<p>are expressing taste receptors.</p>
<p>Okay, so how do we interpret this?</p>
<p>Does this mean that when you eat something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very savory or very sweet, for instance,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s triggering activation of the ovaries</p>
<p>or of the testes?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Now, how those molecules, those chemical molecules</p>
<p>would actually get there isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>The digestive tract does not run directly</p>
<p>to the testes or to the ovaries.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, what this means is that chemical sensing</p>
<p>of the very things that we detect on our tongue</p>
<p>and that we call taste, in quotes, in food</p>
<p>is also evoking cellular responses</p>
<p>within the reproductive gonads.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not this underlies the positive association</p>
<p>that we have with certain foods isn&rsquo;t clear,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t point out the obvious,</p>
<p>which is that the relationship between the sensual nature</p>
<p>of particular foods and sensuality generally</p>
<p>and the reproductive axis is something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been covered in many movies.</p>
<p>There are entire movies that are focused</p>
<p>on the relationship between, for instance,</p>
<p>chocolate and love and reproductive behaviors</p>
<p>or certain feasts of meat and their wonderful tastes</p>
<p>and the kind of sensuality around feasts</p>
<p>of different types of foods.</p>
<p>But in general, it&rsquo;s the sweet and the savory.</p>
<p>Rarely is it the sour or the bitter,</p>
<p>the salty or the fat.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, perhaps,</p>
<p>it is the T2Rs and the T1Rs,</p>
<p>the receptors that are associated with the sweet</p>
<p>and with the umami, the savory flavors</p>
<p>that are expressed not just on the tongue</p>
<p>and in portions of the digestive tract,</p>
<p>but on the gonads themselves.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>Does this mean that eating certain foods</p>
<p>can stimulate the gonads?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no data that immediately support that right now,</p>
<p>but this is an emerging area.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to read more about this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great review entitled</p>
<p>Taste Perception from the Tongue to the Testes,</p>
<p>although they do also talk about the ovaries.</p>
<p>Why they didn&rsquo;t include that in the title</p>
<p>is I think a reflection of the sort of bias of the author.</p>
<p>The author, not incidentally, is Feng Li, last name L-I,</p>
<p>is a very interesting paper</p>
<p>published in Molecular Human Reproduction.</p>
<p>You can find it easily online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s downloadable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also provide a link to it.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>that these taste receptors are expressed in other tissues.</p>
<p>And I should mention that they&rsquo;re expressed</p>
<p>in tissues of other areas of the body as well,</p>
<p>including the respiratory system,</p>
<p>but the richest aggregation or concentration</p>
<p>of these receptors for umami and sweet, of course,</p>
<p>is on the tongue, but also on the gonads.</p>
<p>And I think it does speak to the possible bridge</p>
<p>between what we think of as a sensory</p>
<p>or a sensual experience of food</p>
<p>and the deeper kind of visceral sense within the gut</p>
<p>and maybe even within the gonads as well</p>
<p>of something that we find extremely pleasurable</p>
<p>or even appetitive that we want to move toward it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually going to return to that general theme</p>
<p>in the discussion about touch sensation.</p>
<p>Some people, for instance, when they touch certain surfaces</p>
<p>like furs or sheepskins or velvet or soft, smooth surfaces,</p>
<p>it feels good elsewhere in their body,</p>
<p>not just at the point of contact with that surface.</p>
<p>And similarly, if there&rsquo;s the, how about this one?</p>
<p>The screech of chalk on a chalkboard, it&rsquo;s a sound,</p>
<p>but it has a very strong visceral component</p>
<p>or sandpaper like fingers, fingernails on a chalkboard,</p>
<p>not the sound, but the feeling, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So our whole nervous system is tuned</p>
<p>to either be drawn toward appetitive</p>
<p>or repelled by aversive behaviors, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this push-pull that exists.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m referring to in terms of these receptors</p>
<p>on the tongue that are also expressed on the gonads</p>
<p>is yet another example of what, at least in this case,</p>
<p>seems to be an appetitive thing,</p>
<p>a desire to move toward certain foods</p>
<p>and maybe even the experiences</p>
<p>that are associated with those foods.</p>
<p>I want to talk about a particular aspect of food</p>
<p>and a chemical reaction in cooking</p>
<p>called the Maillard reaction.</p>
<p>Some of you have probably heard of the Maillard reaction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D.</p>
<p>The D is silent, so don&rsquo;t call it the Mallard reaction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the Millard reaction.</p>
<p>It is the Maillard reaction.</p>
<p>And the Maillard reaction is a reaction</p>
<p>that for the aficionados is a non-enzymatic browning,</p>
<p>the other form of non-enzymatic browning is caramelization.</p>
<p>Although when you hear caramel, caramel,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s caramel, you think sweet.</p>
<p>And indeed caramelization</p>
<p>is a sugar-sugar chemical interaction</p>
<p>that leads to a kind of nicely toasted,</p>
<p>not burnt, but nicely toasted sweet taste.</p>
<p>Whereas the Maillard reaction</p>
<p>is that really savory reaction</p>
<p>that occurs when you have a sugar amino acid reaction.</p>
<p>Remember, we have neurons in our gut,</p>
<p>but also neurons in our tongue</p>
<p>and neurons deep in the brain</p>
<p>that are comparing the amount of sugar to savory, okay?</p>
<p>And the Maillard reaction is very interesting</p>
<p>for you chemists out there.</p>
<p>This is going to be way too elementary.</p>
<p>And for you non-chemists,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably going to be a little bit of a reach,</p>
<p>but just bear with me.</p>
<p>All these chemicals that we sense</p>
<p>have a different structure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like hydrogens and oxygens and aldehyde groups</p>
<p>and all these things.</p>
<p>And basically the Maillard reaction</p>
<p>involves what&rsquo;s called a free aldehyde.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t like chemistry,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically got a group there</p>
<p>that kind of sits open</p>
<p>that allows it to interact with other things.</p>
<p>And actually through the use of heat</p>
<p>and the process that we call brazing,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>you create what&rsquo;s called a ketone group.</p>
<p>Now, most people now have heard of ketones</p>
<p>because they think about the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>but a ketone group is actually a chemical compound</p>
<p>that can be used for energy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why people say you can use ketones for energy.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve ever actually encountered ketones,</p>
<p>if you, for instance, get liquid ketones,</p>
<p>a ketone ester, and you smell it,</p>
<p>what does it smell like?</p>
<p>It smells a little bit like an alcohol,</p>
<p>but it has a kind of savory taste,</p>
<p>even when you smell it, okay?</p>
<p>There are other smells that have these tastes too,</p>
<p>but for the Maillard reaction,</p>
<p>which could be created, for instance,</p>
<p>like if you took a piece of meat</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re not a meat eater,</p>
<p>if you took tomatoes and you cook them in a pan</p>
<p>and you cooked it nice and slow</p>
<p>until it simmered and almost started to brown</p>
<p>and burn a little bit, usually if I do it, it burns.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a good cook, as Costello points out a lot,</p>
<p>but it gets that like almost tangy,</p>
<p>very umami-like flavor.</p>
<p>And sometimes it will even stick to the pan</p>
<p>if you scrape it off.</p>
<p>It actually, you can taste it in your mouth</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re cooking it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Maillard reaction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that free aldehyde group.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the production of a ketone group.</p>
<p>When you smell ketones,</p>
<p>it smells very much like that, okay?</p>
<p>Some people talk about the ketones</p>
<p>will produce like fruity breath,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s true if people are really far into ketosis,</p>
<p>their breath has a kind of fruity odor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit of a different thing.</p>
<p>So the relationship between smell and taste</p>
<p>is a very, very close one.</p>
<p>And this is why when people drink wine,</p>
<p>they often will inhale and then sip.</p>
<p>Some of that is just kind of like pomp and circumstance,</p>
<p>frankly, they make a big deal of it,</p>
<p>but they can sense things with their mouth.</p>
<p>The combination of odor receptors being activated</p>
<p>in a particular way,</p>
<p>and taste receptors in the mouth being activated</p>
<p>in a particular way,</p>
<p>triggers the activation of multiple brain areas</p>
<p>that are associated with taste</p>
<p>and circuitry within the body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with the behaviors</p>
<p>that relate to that taste,</p>
<p>like leaning toward it or leaning away from it,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not it&rsquo;s appetitive or aversive.</p>
<p>So the Maillard reaction is a very interesting reaction</p>
<p>involving this sugar amino acid thing,</p>
<p>but really what it&rsquo;s doing is heating up food</p>
<p>such that the amino acids are more available,</p>
<p>literally in their chemical form</p>
<p>for detection by the neurons.</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon that occurs in other domains</p>
<p>of the taste system.</p>
<p>For instance, a lot of what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>with highly processed foods</p>
<p>is that manufacturers have figured out</p>
<p>how to trigger more dopamine response</p>
<p>by ingestion of these sugary foods</p>
<p>and created textures</p>
<p>and created essentially design of foods for two purposes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not out to completely demonize processed foods.</p>
<p>I did that in a previous episode,</p>
<p>but processed foods are really designed</p>
<p>to take foods that ordinarily would spoil,</p>
<p>that would have a shelf life and extend their shelf life,</p>
<p>to turn foods which are not a commodity into a commodity,</p>
<p>something that could be stored and used essentially</p>
<p>as a tradable, purchasable, sellable resource.</p>
<p>In doing that, they&rsquo;ve also decided to change the texture</p>
<p>so that you want to chew more of them.</p>
<p>Like I have this thing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is for those Triscuit crackers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, why are those things so good?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the texture, you got those layers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just kind of perfectly salty.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t had one in a long time,</p>
<p>so I bet if I had one now,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t taste as good as I&rsquo;m imagining it.</p>
<p>But those combinations of texture, smell, and taste</p>
<p>are what combine to activate these different brain areas</p>
<p>that make you really want to desire something.</p>
<p>And the people who make foods, processed foods in particular</p>
<p>are phenomenally good at figuring out</p>
<p>what drives the dopamine system</p>
<p>and makes you want more of these things,</p>
<p>either because of the way they taste</p>
<p>and or because of the way they trigger neurons in your gut</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with taste</p>
<p>that simply make you desire more of the food.</p>
<p>In other words, many of the foods that are processed foods</p>
<p>make you desire more of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to eat one chip kind of thing,</p>
<p>not because they taste good, but because in your gut,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re activating the neurons that activate dopamine,</p>
<p>which make you seek more of those foods,</p>
<p>independent of blood sugar or anything else.</p>
<p>So you may actually be eating more particular foods,</p>
<p>not because they taste good,</p>
<p>but because they feel good on your tongue and mouth,</p>
<p>and because the neurons in your gut,</p>
<p>which are totally independent of conscious taste,</p>
<p>are triggering the release of dopamine,</p>
<p>which is a molecule that makes you seek more of</p>
<p>and do more of anything that led</p>
<p>to the ingestion of that food.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fun experiment that you can do,</p>
<p>which is to completely invert</p>
<p>your sense of sweet and sour.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a way to do this readily.</p>
<p>When I was a postdoc,</p>
<p>I used to have a journal club at my house.</p>
<p>People would come over in the evening once a month,</p>
<p>and we would read a paper,</p>
<p>typically the weirdest paper we could find,</p>
<p>and we would eat food and hang out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what nerds did and do for fun.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>One time, someone brought what&rsquo;s called Miracle Berry.</p>
<p>So this is in some psychedelic plant medicine thing.</p>
<p>Miracle Berry, you can purchase online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s relatively inexpensive.</p>
<p>It actually causes a change in the configuration</p>
<p>of taste receptors,</p>
<p>such that when you eat something sour, it tastes sweet.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s really wild is you ingest Miracle Berry,</p>
<p>and then you bite into a lemon, maybe even the lemon peel,</p>
<p>and it tastes as sweet as a peach.</p>
<p>And this effect lasts several hours.</p>
<p>Definitely check any warnings.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what sort of warnings</p>
<p>the Miracle Berry carries,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s always something you can imagine.</p>
<p>There are a number of papers on Miracle Berry,</p>
<p>or Miracle Fruit, it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>but it changes your perception of sour</p>
<p>at a perceptual level,</p>
<p>but it does that by changing the activity of the receptors</p>
<p>in the mouth and tongue.</p>
<p>Now, this is important as a principle,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s underscored by experiments that have been done by,</p>
<p>for instance, Charles Zucker&rsquo;s lab at Columbia University,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve essentially genetically engineered animals</p>
<p>such that the bitter receptor is swapped</p>
<p>with the sweet receptor,</p>
<p>or the sweet receptor is swapped with the bitter receptor.</p>
<p>And what they show is that the actual food,</p>
<p>the experience on the tongue,</p>
<p>drives different pathways in the brain.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they did.</p>
<p>They essentially took mice</p>
<p>and swapped out the sweet receptor</p>
<p>and put in a bitter receptor.</p>
<p>And then what they found is that,</p>
<p>whereas normally mice would actively seek out</p>
<p>and even work for sugar water, sucrose,</p>
<p>they really liked that.</p>
<p>If they replace the sweet receptor with the bitter receptor,</p>
<p>the mice would avoid sugar water.</p>
<p>And the reverse was also true,</p>
<p>that mice would drink a bitter solution avidly.</p>
<p>They liked a bitter solution</p>
<p>if they swapped out the bitter receptor for sweet receptor.</p>
<p>What this means is that our entire experience</p>
<p>of what we taste is dependent on how we experience</p>
<p>that taste at the level of the tongue.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re hopefully not going to do</p>
<p>genetic engineering of your taste receptors,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;d like to do this sort of experiment,</p>
<p>you actually can do it very easily using Miracle Fruit,</p>
<p>the instructions of how much to ingest, et cetera.</p>
<p>Any safety concerns are usually on the package</p>
<p>and should be easy to find.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of science to support how this works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a fun experiment that anyone can do</p>
<p>and will completely change your perception</p>
<p>of any food that you&rsquo;re accustomed to eating.</p>
<p>In fact, you can figure out how much sweet</p>
<p>or the sense of sweetness is contributing</p>
<p>to your experience of a food,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t think of it as a sweet food,</p>
<p>through this Miracle Fruit experiment.</p>
<p>You could take Miracle Fruit,</p>
<p>you could eat a slice of pepperoni pizza or cheese pizza,</p>
<p>which perhaps normally to you would taste just like pizza.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice it tastes very different.</p>
<p>What you are detecting is how much the sense of sweet</p>
<p>was contributing to that particular flavor.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to return to pheromones.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>true pheromonal effects are well-established in animals.</p>
<p>And one of the most remarkable pheromone effects</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever been described is one that actually</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before on this podcast,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll mention again just briefly,</p>
<p>which is the Coolidge effect.</p>
<p>The Coolidge effect is the effect of a male</p>
<p>of a given species, in most cases,</p>
<p>it tended to be a rodent or a rooster mating.</p>
<p>And at some point reaching exhaustion</p>
<p>or the inability to mate again</p>
<p>because they just simply couldn&rsquo;t for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The Coolidge effect establishes that</p>
<p>if you swap out the hen with a new hen</p>
<p>or the female rat or mouse with a new one,</p>
<p>then the rat or the rooster spontaneously</p>
<p>regains their ability to mate.</p>
<p>Somehow their vigor is returned,</p>
<p>the refractory period after mating that normally occurs</p>
<p>is abolished and they can mate again.</p>
<p>Turns out that the Coolidge effect</p>
<p>runs in the opposite direction too.</p>
<p>I did not know this, but I recently learned of a study.</p>
<p>It was actually done in hamsters, not in mice,</p>
<p>but it turns out that females also will,</p>
<p>female rodents will mate to exhaustion.</p>
<p>And at some point, excuse me,</p>
<p>they will refuse to mate any longer</p>
<p>unless you swap in a new male.</p>
<p>And then because mating in rodents</p>
<p>involves the female being receptive,</p>
<p>there are a certain number of behaviors</p>
<p>that tell you that she&rsquo;s willing and wanting to mate,</p>
<p>so-called lordosis reflex.</p>
<p>Then if there&rsquo;s a new male,</p>
<p>she will spontaneously regain the lordosis reflex</p>
<p>and the desire to mate.</p>
<p>And how do you know this?</p>
<p>How do we know it&rsquo;s a pheromonal effect?</p>
<p>Well, this recovery of the desire and ability to mate</p>
<p>both in males and in females can be evoked completely</p>
<p>by the odor of a new male or female.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be the presentation</p>
<p>of the actual animal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you know that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not some visual interaction or some other interaction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pheromonal interaction.</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>pheromonal effects, humans have been debated</p>
<p>for a long period of time.</p>
<p>We are thought to have a vestigial,</p>
<p>meaning a kind of shrunken down</p>
<p>miniature accessory olfactory bulb</p>
<p>called Jacobson&rsquo;s organ or the vomeronasal organ.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t believe that Jacobson&rsquo;s organ exists.</p>
<p>Some people do.</p>
<p>There is anatomical evidence for it in some cadavers.</p>
<p>It sits not very high up in the brain</p>
<p>or where your olfactory bulb is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually in the nasal passages.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like little dents</p>
<p>as you go up through your nasal passages.</p>
<p>And there is evidence of something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s vomeronasal-like.</p>
<p>Vomeronasal is the pheromonal organ.</p>
<p>They call it Jacobson&rsquo;s organ if it&rsquo;s present in humans.</p>
<p>Kind of tucked into some of the divots</p>
<p>in the nasal passage.</p>
<p>Even if that organ, Jacobson&rsquo;s organ,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there or is not responsible</p>
<p>for the chemical signaling between individuals,</p>
<p>there is chemical signaling between human beings.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the effect of tears</p>
<p>in suppressing the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in sexual desire</p>
<p>and testosterone of males.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a concrete result.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good result.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s published by an excellent group</p>
<p>with no preexisting bias going in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just what they found.</p>
<p>There is also evidence both for and against</p>
<p>chemical signaling between females</p>
<p>in terms of synchronization of menstrual cycles.</p>
<p>Now, the original paper on this</p>
<p>was published in the 1970s by McClintock.</p>
<p>And it essentially said that when women live together</p>
<p>in group housing, dormitories, and similar,</p>
<p>that their menstrual cycles were synchronized</p>
<p>and that was due to what was hypothesized</p>
<p>to be pheromonal effects.</p>
<p>Over the years, that study has been challenged</p>
<p>many, many times.</p>
<p>The more recent data point to the idea</p>
<p>that there is chemical, chemical signaling</p>
<p>between women in ways that impact</p>
<p>the timing of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>But that depending on whether or not</p>
<p>some of the women are in the ovulation phase,</p>
<p>the ovulatory phase of that cycle,</p>
<p>or whether or not they are in the follicular phase,</p>
<p>the phase when the follicle is maturing</p>
<p>before the egg actually ovulates.</p>
<p>So two separate phases of the 28-day menstrual cycle</p>
<p>will either lengthen or shorten the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>of the person that smells those women.</p>
<p>Translated into English, what that means is that</p>
<p>it is very likely, it seems, that something,</p>
<p>maybe pheromones, but maybe some other chemical</p>
<p>that is independent of pheromones,</p>
<p>is being conveyed between women that are housed together</p>
<p>or spend a lot of time together</p>
<p>to shift their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that they synchronize.</p>
<p>So for instance, if one woman is in the follicular phase</p>
<p>of the menstrual cycle, it might shorten</p>
<p>or delay ovulation, excuse me,</p>
<p>it might accelerate ovulation in another woman.</p>
<p>Whereas if somebody is in the ovulatory phase</p>
<p>of their cycle, it might lengthen the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>so that the woman who smells that person&rsquo;s scent</p>
<p>or who smells her sweat, we still don&rsquo;t know the origin</p>
<p>of the chemical, would ovulate later.</p>
<p>So all of this is to say is that chemical,</p>
<p>chemical signaling is happening from females to males</p>
<p>through tears, we know that.</p>
<p>Is that a pheromonal effect?</p>
<p>Well, by the strict definition of a pheromone,</p>
<p>a molecule that&rsquo;s released from one individual</p>
<p>that impacts the biology of another individual, yes.</p>
<p>But in terms of identifying what the pheromone is in tears,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still unknown.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what the chemical compound is.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re reluctant as scientists</p>
<p>to call it a true pheromonal effect.</p>
<p>The menstrual cycle and the synchronization</p>
<p>of the menstrual cycle effect seems to hold up</p>
<p>under some conditions, but in some cases,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of clash of menstrual cycles</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s created by chemicals that are emitted</p>
<p>from one female to another.</p>
<p>So there are many examples of this in humans.</p>
<p>For instance, people can recognize the t-shirt</p>
<p>of their mate.</p>
<p>If you give, this experiment has been done many times.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s been challenged a number of times,</p>
<p>but the data are pretty good by now that if you offer,</p>
<p>you take a collection of women</p>
<p>who are in stable relationships with somebody,</p>
<p>you offer them the smell of 100 different shirts</p>
<p>and they can very readily pick out</p>
<p>their significant other&rsquo;s scent.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s pure olfaction, that&rsquo;s not pheromonal,</p>
<p>but nonetheless is a remarkable degree of discrimination,</p>
<p>olfactory discrimination.</p>
<p>You can dilute their partner&rsquo;s scent</p>
<p>down to the point where they themselves</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t consciously detect the difference</p>
<p>between the sweat or the t-shirt</p>
<p>of 100 different t-shirts or so.</p>
<p>And they might say, I don&rsquo;t really smell the difference,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s this one.</p>
<p>Yeah, this one belongs to the person that I&rsquo;ve been with.</p>
<p>And they are much greater than chance</p>
<p>at detecting the t-shirt</p>
<p>or identifying the t-shirt correctly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no question really that there is</p>
<p>chemical chemical signaling between humans.</p>
<p>The question is whether or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s truly pheromonal in basis.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;ll notice that a lot of the examples I gave,</p>
<p>aside from the one of tears,</p>
<p>is women detecting the sense of men or of other women.</p>
<p>And it turns out that there are a number of papers.</p>
<p>The best one I think that I could find</p>
<p>is published in Physiology and Behavior in 2009.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a review entitled,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sex Differences and Reproductive Hormone Influences</p>
<p>on Human Odor Perception&rsquo; by Dottie, D-O-T-Y and Cameron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I encourage you to check out this review.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available free as a download.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a link to it.</p>
<p>You can get the full PDF if you want.</p>
<p>But it does seem that women are better at detecting odors</p>
<p>in these odor discrimination tasks than are men.</p>
<p>And yes, that it does vary according to where they are</p>
<p>in their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And yes, they also looked at people</p>
<p>who had received gonadectomy.</p>
<p>They had their ovaries removed</p>
<p>and a number of different important controls.</p>
<p>None of this surprises me.</p>
<p>None of this should surprise you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that hormones have a profound effect</p>
<p>on a large number of systems in our biology</p>
<p>and that smell and taste and the ability</p>
<p>to sense the chemical states of others,</p>
<p>either consciously or subconsciously,</p>
<p>have a profound influence on whether or not</p>
<p>we might want to spend time with them,</p>
<p>whether or not this is somebody that we&rsquo;re pair bonded with,</p>
<p>whether or not this is somebody that we just met</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t trust yet, things of this sort.</p>
<p>And given what&rsquo;s at stake in terms of reproductive biology,</p>
<p>not just offspring, but given the possibility</p>
<p>of transmission of diseases, et cetera,</p>
<p>you know, the risks of childbirth, et cetera,</p>
<p>it makes so much sense that much of our biology</p>
<p>is wired toward detecting and sensing</p>
<p>whether or not things and people</p>
<p>are things that we should approach or avoid,</p>
<p>whether or not reproduction with that person</p>
<p>is the appropriate response or suppression</p>
<p>of the reproductive response</p>
<p>is the appropriate response, right?</p>
<p>As in the case with the tears.</p>
<p>So I think these are fascinating studies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an area that still needs a lot of work,</p>
<p>but there are some really wonderful papers on this.</p>
<p>And the one that I mentioned a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>sex differences and reproductive hormone influences</p>
<p>on human odor perception is one of the better reviews</p>
<p>that are out there.</p>
<p>There are also a number of other reviews,</p>
<p>for instance, that talk about pheromone effects</p>
<p>and their impact on mood and sexual responses</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And we will also provide some links to those.</p>
<p>A lot of this is still speculative, but I want to say,</p>
<p>I know I said it three times,</p>
<p>but I really want to underscore</p>
<p>because it is vitally important</p>
<p>and people seem to get a little triggered</p>
<p>by the notion of pheromones.</p>
<p>Just because we haven&rsquo;t identified</p>
<p>the actual chemical compound that&rsquo;s acting</p>
<p>as a pheromone or putative pheromone</p>
<p>does not mean that chemical chemical signaling</p>
<p>between individuals doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Clearly it does.</p>
<p>Actually, you and every other human</p>
<p>from the time you&rsquo;re born until the time you die</p>
<p>are actively seeking out and sensing and evaluating</p>
<p>the chemicals that come from other individuals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really nice study that was done</p>
<p>by the Weizmann Institute, a group there.</p>
<p>I think it was also Noam Sobel&rsquo;s group,</p>
<p>but another group as well, as I recall,</p>
<p>looking at human-human interactions</p>
<p>when they meet for the first time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a remarkable study because what they found</p>
<p>was people would reach out and shake hands.</p>
<p>This is a typical response, you know,</p>
<p>pre-pandemic people would meet,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d reach out and they would shake hands.</p>
<p>And what they observed was almost every time</p>
<p>within just a few seconds of having shaken hands</p>
<p>with this new individual, people will touch their eyes</p>
<p>almost without fail.</p>
<p>Occasionally they would touch their eyebrow.</p>
<p>Occasionally someone would touch their hair.</p>
<p>We always associate that with people having some sort of,</p>
<p>or us having some sort of self-conscious response,</p>
<p>like, oh, we want to make sure we&rsquo;re tucked in</p>
<p>and all prim and proper, whatever it is,</p>
<p>or looking right, is there something in my teeth,</p>
<p>this kind of thing.</p>
<p>But actually people are doing that</p>
<p>even if the person they just met left the room.</p>
<p>So someone&rsquo;s sitting there, someone comes in,</p>
<p>they shake hands, and the person inevitably,</p>
<p>subconsciously touches their eyes.</p>
<p>They are taking chemicals from the skin contact</p>
<p>and they are placing it on a mucosal membrane of some sort.</p>
<p>Typically not up their nose or in their mouth,</p>
<p>typically on their eyes.</p>
<p>Now, animals do this all the time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a phenomenon in animals called bunting.</p>
<p>If you have a overeager dog that when you meet them</p>
<p>or you see them again after you&rsquo;ve been away for the day,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll rub their head against you, right?</p>
<p>Cats will do this too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called bunting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re rubbing their scent glands on you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re marking you.</p>
<p>And believe it or not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re marking other people when you shake their hand.</p>
<p>And they are then taking your mark</p>
<p>and rubbing it on themselves subconsciously.</p>
<p>So we all do these kinds of behaviors.</p>
<p>And now that you&rsquo;re aware of it,</p>
<p>you can watch for it in your environment.</p>
<p>You can pay attention to people.</p>
<p>Some of this has probably changed</p>
<p>in light of the events of 2020, et cetera.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, we are evaluating the molecules</p>
<p>on people&rsquo;s breath.</p>
<p>We are evaluating the molecules on people&rsquo;s skin</p>
<p>by actively rubbing it on ourselves.</p>
<p>And we are actively involved</p>
<p>in sensing not just their facial expressions,</p>
<p>the size of their pupils and things like that,</p>
<p>but the chemicals that they are emitting,</p>
<p>their hormone status, how they smell.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re detecting the pheromones possibly,</p>
<p>but certainly the odors in their breath.</p>
<p>You might say, well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually go around sniffing people&rsquo;s breath.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>unless if it&rsquo;s bad in which case it&rsquo;s aversive,</p>
<p>but breath is communicating a lot of signals.</p>
<p>And this handshake eye rub experiment</p>
<p>shows that we are actively going through behaviors</p>
<p>reflexively to wipe ourselves</p>
<p>or smear ourselves with other people&rsquo;s chemicals.</p>
<p>Now that might seem odd or even gross to you,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I think that it illustrates the extent</p>
<p>to which we as human beings are in some ways</p>
<p>among the other animals in our subconscious,</p>
<p>sometimes conscious, but certainly subconscious tendency</p>
<p>to try and evaluate our chemical environment</p>
<p>through what we inhale through our nose,</p>
<p>what we ingest through our mouth,</p>
<p>and what we actively take off other people&rsquo;s skin</p>
<p>and rub on ourselves to evaluate it</p>
<p>and what we should do about it</p>
<p>and perhaps that person as well.</p>
<p>So today we talked a lot about olfaction taste</p>
<p>and chemical sensing between individuals.</p>
<p>I like to think that you now know a lot</p>
<p>about how your smell system works</p>
<p>and why inhaling is a really good thing to do in general</p>
<p>for waking up your brain and for cognitive function</p>
<p>and for enhancing your sense of smell.</p>
<p>We talked about how to enhance your sense of taste</p>
<p>and we talked about chemical signaling between individuals</p>
<p>as a way of communicating some important aspects</p>
<p>about biology.</p>
<p>People are shaping each other&rsquo;s biology all the time</p>
<p>by way of these chemicals that are being traded</p>
<p>from one body to the next through air</p>
<p>and skin-to-skin contact and tears.</p>
