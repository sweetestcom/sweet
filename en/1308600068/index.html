    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Kyle Gillette.</p>
<p>Dr. Gillette is dual board certified</p>
<p>in family medicine and obesity medicine,</p>
<p>and practices out of a clinic in Kansas</p>
<p>and via telemedicine.</p>
<p>He provides full spectrum medicine,</p>
<p>including hormone health, preventative medicine,</p>
<p>obstetrics, which is the branch of medicine and surgery</p>
<p>concerned with childbirth</p>
<p>and the care of women giving birth, and pediatrics.</p>
<p>I first learned about Dr. Gillette</p>
<p>from a podcast of all things,</p>
<p>and was immediately struck by the breadth and depth</p>
<p>of his knowledge on all things,</p>
<p>hormones and hormone optimization.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll see very soon today,</p>
<p>Dr. Gillette can teach you how to optimize your hormones</p>
<p>using behavioral tools, nutrition, exercise-based tools,</p>
<p>supplementation, and hormone therapies,</p>
<p>if those are appropriate for you.</p>
<p>There are many professionals out there,</p>
<p>including many medical doctors, of course,</p>
<p>talking about hormone health.</p>
<p>What really sets Dr. Gillette apart from the pack</p>
<p>is his ability to understand how the different factors</p>
<p>that I described before, nutrition, supplementation,</p>
<p>exercise, and hormone therapies,</p>
<p>how those interact with one another,</p>
<p>and the safest and most rational ways</p>
<p>to approach hormone optimization.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will learn how to optimize your hormones,</p>
<p>not just testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>but also prolactin and other hormone pathways</p>
<p>that impact your mood, mental health, and physical health.</p>
<p>Dr. Gillette is also an avid educator</p>
<p>about hormones and other aspects of health.</p>
<p>He does this on zero cost to consumer platforms,</p>
<p>such as Instagram and other social media.</p>
<p>On Instagram, he is Kyle Gillette, M.D.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s K-Y-L-E-G-I-L-L-E-T-T, no E at the end, M.D.</p>
<p>So Kyle Gillette, M.D. on Instagram,</p>
<p>and he is Gillette Health on all other platforms,</p>
<p>including LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook.</p>
<p>If you go to his Instagram or his other social media,</p>
<p>you will learn a lot about hormone health,</p>
<p>about the latest science impacting obesity</p>
<p>and metabolic health.</p>
<p>He is a wealth of knowledge,</p>
<p>and again, he&rsquo;s providing all that information</p>
<p>at zero cost to you, the consumer.</p>
<p>What you are soon to hear is a conversation</p>
<p>between me and Dr. Gillette about all things hormones</p>
<p>and hormone health and hormone optimization.</p>
<p>We dive deep into mechanisms,</p>
<p>but we are clear to establish what each word</p>
<p>or set of concepts mean.</p>
<p>So if you have no background in biology, or even if you do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;ll come away</p>
<p>with a wealth of valuable knowledge.</p>
<p>We also talk about specific protocols related, again,</p>
<p>to lifestyle factors, nutrition, supplementation,</p>
<p>and where appropriate hormone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a lot of interest about these topics.</p>
<p>Dr. Gillette is very thorough about addressing</p>
<p>both male and female issues and addressing hormone health</p>
<p>for people at all stages of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you will come away from this episode</p>
<p>with the same impression that I did,</p>
<p>which is that Dr. Gillette</p>
<p>is an extraordinarily clear communicator,</p>
<p>and that he has tremendous compassion for his patients,</p>
<p>and that he has a deep love of understanding biology</p>
<p>and medicine in ways that can benefit you.</p>
<p>Before we begin with today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day,</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome,</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>There are a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,</p>
<p>but a major issue with many of them</p>
<p>is that you get numbers back about levels of hormones,</p>
<p>metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with that information.</p>
<p>InsideTracker has solved that problem</p>
<p>by creating a personalized dashboard.</p>
<p>So you take your blood and or your DNA test,</p>
<p>you get the results back,</p>
<p>and where certain values might be too high</p>
<p>or too low for your preference,</p>
<p>you can click on that and it will direct you immediately</p>
<p>to lifestyle factors, nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,</p>
<p>that can help you bring those numbers back into the ranges</p>
<p>that are ideal for you.</p>
<p>So it not only gives you information</p>
<p>about where your health stands,</p>
<p>it gives you directives as to how to improve your health.</p>

<p>And now for my discussion about hormone health</p>
<p>and optimization with Dr. Kyle Gillette.</p>
<p>Dr. Gillette, welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m super excited to talk to you</p>
<p>because I found out about you on a podcast</p>
<p>and it immediately became clear</p>
<p>that you are an encyclopedia of knowledge</p>
<p>about hormone health for men and for women</p>
<p>across the lifespan.</p>
<p>So I have many, many questions,</p>
<p>but before we dive into those questions,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to just get a little bit of your background</p>
<p>in terms of your medical training</p>
<p>and what your particular orientation is</p>
<p>toward treating your patients.</p>
<p>And how do you think about this whole landscape</p>
<p>that we call hormone health?</p>
<p>What is a hormone?</p>
<p>How do you envision people managing their hormones?</p>
<p>If you could just kind of fill in a few of those blanks</p>
<p>for us, I think a lot of people would appreciate it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m dual board certified in family medicine</p>
<p>and obesity medicine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of tailored my training</p>
<p>in order to provide what I call a balanced approach</p>
<p>to total health, which includes body, mind, and soul.</p>
<p>I recently saw a podcast with Joe Rogan and Mr. Beast,</p>
<p>and Joe asks Mr. Beast,</p>
<p>how do you become such an amazing YouTuber</p>
<p>and have all these great clickbait videos?</p>
<p>And how did you become good at it?</p>
<p>And it turns out he just became obsessed</p>
<p>when he was a teenager.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s essentially how I&rsquo;ve tailored my education</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become obsessed with optimal human performance,</p>
<p>their body, their mind, and even their spirit.</p>
<p>So I attended med school at the University of Kansas,</p>
<p>which is one of the few med schools</p>
<p>that still emphasizes full spectrum care.</p>
<p>They emphasize exercise as medicine.</p>
<p>They emphasize food as medicine,</p>
<p>of which I was active in both of those interest groups.</p>
<p>In residency, I was active</p>
<p>in a lot of mindfulness curriculum,</p>
<p>and then also things like walk with a doc,</p>
<p>where you emphasize preventative medicine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve kind of got away from,</p>
<p>and that niche led me to hormone health.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really start as hormone health,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very important component of health in general</p>
<p>that many people don&rsquo;t emphasize.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, this idea of preventative medicine,</p>
<p>I think is starting to really take hold</p>
<p>in the general population,</p>
<p>especially given the events of the last few years,</p>
<p>people realize that they are showing up to health challenges</p>
<p>at a bunch of different levels,</p>
<p>and with some people feeling very robust,</p>
<p>other people feeling back on their heels.</p>
<p>When someone comes to you as a patient,</p>
<p>what are some of the first things</p>
<p>that you want to know about them?</p>
<p>I mean, obviously you want to know their blood pressure,</p>
<p>you want to know something about their mental health</p>
<p>and family history, but in terms of hormone health,</p>
<p>what are the sorts of probe questions that you ask</p>
<p>and what are you looking for?</p>
<p>And I ask this because I&rsquo;d like people to be able to ask</p>
<p>some of these very same questions for themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So when you do a physical exam and a history,</p>
<p>you have a lot of different parts.</p>
<p>You have your history of present illness.</p>
<p>If they have a complaint,</p>
<p>maybe the patient doesn&rsquo;t have a complaint.</p>
<p>And that case, things like their social history</p>
<p>and their family history are extremely important</p>
<p>because that gives you an insight into their genetics</p>
<p>and an insight into their hormone health.</p>
<p>So patients will tell me, oh, I&rsquo;m doing okay,</p>
<p>but it helps to ask them, well, how are you now?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the patient is 50.</p>
<p>How are you now versus when you were 20</p>
<p>and what has changed?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve gotten the question a lot.</p>
<p>How do you get your doctor to order a better lab workup</p>
<p>or to even include your basic hormones?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no magic answer to that.</p>
<p>But what really helps is you tell them,</p>
<p>my energy is not as good as it used to be.</p>
<p>My focus is not as good as it used to be.</p>
<p>My athletic performance is not as good as it used to be.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to have a pathology</p>
<p>in order for a lab to be indicated.</p>
<p>You just need to have that pertinent symptom.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s gonna be really helpful</p>
<p>because for many people,</p>
<p>the idea of getting a blood test to look at their hormones,</p>
<p>it just seems like such an enormous hurdle to get over.</p>
<p>And many doctors won&rsquo;t prescribe them.</p>
<p>And would you say that it&rsquo;s using the approach</p>
<p>you just described that it&rsquo;s equally effective</p>
<p>for men and women?</p>
<p>Or do you find that for one reason or another</p>
<p>that men and women have different challenges</p>
<p>and advantages in trying to access their deeper hormone data?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s slightly different.</p>
<p>With women, there&rsquo;s a lot more objective data.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re having menstrual irregularities</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re not having a period,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re having too heavy of periods,</p>
<p>then those are things that they talk about</p>
<p>very frequently with their doctor.</p>
<p>Men are more hesitant.</p>
<p>So men really wanna know what their testosterone is,</p>
<p>but at the same time,</p>
<p>they really don&rsquo;t wanna tell their doctor</p>
<p>how their libido is or how their energy is,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s almost like they feel less masculine</p>
<p>or they feel less like a guy when they say that,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re just talking to their doctor about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that that raises a really important point,</p>
<p>which is that the whole discussion around hormone health</p>
<p>is a bit of a barbed wire topic,</p>
<p>because in many ways, when we hear the word hormone,</p>
<p>we think testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>we think notions of masculinity and femininity.</p>
<p>And of course, testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>are present in all sexes, right?</p>
<p>All chromosomal backgrounds</p>
<p>and just to varying degrees and ratios.</p>
<p>But it also raises all these issues about sexual health</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m surrounded by medical doctors</p>
<p>in my lab at Stanford.</p>
<p>And the more physicians that I surround myself with,</p>
<p>the more open is the discussion around sexual health</p>
<p>and reproductive health.</p>
<p>But in the general population,</p>
<p>I think some of these topics are a little bit taboo</p>
<p>or against kind of barbed wire.</p>
<p>And so I think that people are seeking</p>
<p>a lot of this information on YouTube</p>
<p>and through communities that may or may not</p>
<p>be very educated about the actual biology.</p>
<p>So along those lines,</p>
<p>we could probably assume that hormones</p>
<p>are changing across the lifespan, I think, right?</p>
<p>Certainly from childhood and puberty and onward.</p>
<p>If you would, I&rsquo;d love to just kind of take a snapshot</p>
<p>of what you think everybody should be thinking about</p>
<p>or doing to optimize their hormone health,</p>
<p>male or female, let&rsquo;s say in their 20s.</p>
<p>And then maybe we can migrate that to their 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>But before that, could you just tell us</p>
<p>what everyone should be doing for their hormone health</p>
<p>from puberty onward?</p>
<p>Yeah, the law of diminishing returns applies.</p>
<p>So doing a little amount</p>
<p>of what I call lifestyle interventions</p>
<p>over a long period of time</p>
<p>is gonna be far more helpful or efficacious</p>
<p>than doing a lot and then doing nothing</p>
<p>or doing a lot and then doing nothing.</p>
<p>So I talk about the big six pillars.</p>
<p>The two strongest ones are likely diet and exercise.</p>
<p>For hormone health, specifically resistance training</p>
<p>is particularly helpful.</p>
<p>For diet, caloric restriction can be particularly helpful,</p>
<p>especially with the epidemic of metabolic syndrome</p>
<p>that is continuing to ongo in this country</p>
<p>and in developed countries in general.</p>
<p>So those are the two most powerful.</p>
<p>So number one and number two are diet and exercise.</p>
<p>For the last four, I have a little bit of alliteration.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s stress and stress optimization.</p>
<p>That has to do with cortisol.</p>
<p>That has to do with your mental health.</p>
<p>That has to do with societal health</p>
<p>and collective health of your family as well.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re a member of a family</p>
<p>or even a very close friend,</p>
<p>trying to achieve optimal health together is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with nicotine cessation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with hormone optimization.</p>
<p>If you do it as a household unit, it&rsquo;s far more helpful.</p>
<p>So after stress, you have sleep optimization.</p>
<p>Sleep is extremely important,</p>
<p>especially for mitochondrial health as well.</p>
<p>And then you have sunlight,</p>
<p>which encompasses anything that&rsquo;s outdoors.</p>
<p>So you move more, you have cold exposure,</p>
<p>you have heat exposure, that&rsquo;s sunlight.</p>
<p>And then last one is spirit.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the body, mind, and soul.</p>
<p>If you have all the other five</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re dialed in completely,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have your spiritual health,</p>
<p>whatever you believe,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s going to profoundly impact your body</p>
<p>and your mind as well.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re definitely going to touch into this notion</p>
<p>of spiritual health,</p>
<p>because I think for some people</p>
<p>that might draw connotations of certain things</p>
<p>that may or may not be accurate,</p>
<p>but I know a number of academic laboratories</p>
<p>that are focused on this and a number of,</p>
<p>not just functional medicine clinics,</p>
<p>but research clinics and hospitals throughout the country</p>
<p>that are achieving some really interesting data,</p>
<p>not just in people that are quite sick,</p>
<p>but in healthy people</p>
<p>who are trying to further optimize health.</p>
<p>So we will definitely touch back to that.</p>
<p>If you would be so kind as to maybe give us</p>
<p>a little bit more detail about some of these other areas.</p>
<p>So when people hear diet, I immediately think,</p>
<p>okay, now we get into the combat</p>
<p>around vegan, plant-based, carnivore, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I think that my general view of this</p>
<p>is that most people should probably be eating</p>
<p>as few highly processed foods,</p>
<p>highly palatable foods as possible,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t mean eating foods</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t taste good, of course.</p>
<p>But what other sorts of things do you recommend</p>
<p>in the realm of diet?</p>
<p>And then I also want to know about caloric restriction,</p>
<p>because my understanding is that a caloric surplus</p>
<p>can actually support certain hormones like testosterone.</p>
<p>So how does one combine caloric restriction</p>
<p>and still optimize hormones?</p>
<p>But what would you say is a really terrific way</p>
<p>to think about and approach diet?</p>
<p>Yeah, diet should be an individualized approach.</p>
<p>So if you have a car, each car is made different</p>
<p>and requires a different sort of fuel,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a race car, whether it&rsquo;s a diesel truck,</p>
<p>they have different fuels</p>
<p>for different performance outcomes.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to tow something</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re trying to go fast.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same way with athletes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty well studied.</p>
<p>The more intra-workout carbs</p>
<p>ultra-long distance athletes take,</p>
<p>in general, they do better.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve studied this in cyclists quite often.</p>
<p>It also depends on your genetics.</p>
<p>So you can have a genetic polymorphism</p>
<p>and you metabolize carbs and sugar better,</p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re unopposed by fiber.</p>
<p>How does one determine whether or not</p>
<p>they have such a polymorphism?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m an omnivore.</p>
<p>So I do eat some high quality meats, not in huge quantities,</p>
<p>but I also eat vegetables and starches.</p>
<p>I feel fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done an elimination diet.</p>
<p>I think I did a very low carb diet once</p>
<p>and all it gave me was a lot of psoriasis and poor sleep.</p>
<p>So I backed off.</p>
<p>I probably didn&rsquo;t do it correctly,</p>
<p>but I know a lot of people that do quite well</p>
<p>on a very low carb or zero carb diet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Particularly those who are at risk of cancer</p>
<p>because you have less glucose</p>
<p>that can be easily uptaken into cells.</p>
<p>And then also people with auto-immune diseases.</p>
<p>They tend to do well on lower carb diets.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, as far as the, how do you know,</p>
<p>basically you can use your biofeedback,</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re feeling to guess what you tolerate well,</p>
<p>or you can just get genetic testing,</p>
<p>which can be fairly expensive,</p>
<p>but most of all it requires a physician</p>
<p>or someone who knows how to interpret the test accurately.</p>
<p>And if someone had the means,</p>
<p>or would you say that getting regular blood testing</p>
<p>is a good idea?</p>
<p>And if so, what is regular blood testing?</p>
<p>Is it every three months?</p>
<p>Is it every six months?</p>
<p>Of course, the backdrop of life is changing too,</p>
<p>stress levels, et cetera.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Every three to six months for preventative purposes.</p>
<p>At times you need blood tests at faster frequencies</p>
<p>than that.</p>
<p>And then you should also get a blood test</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re fasting and when you&rsquo;re not fasting.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re looking for damage to the beach,</p>
<p>you wanna, you don&rsquo;t just look at low tide,</p>
<p>you look at high tide and you see what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>at high tide as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great way to put it.</p>
<p>And in terms of general recommendations around exercise,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m of the mind based on the data that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>that almost everybody should,</p>
<p>or everybody should be getting 150 to 180 minutes minimum</p>
<p>of zone two cardio per week,</p>
<p>kind of could continue while having a conversation,</p>
<p>but if one were to exert any more effort,</p>
<p>it would have a hard time getting the words out,</p>
<p>at least that, right?</p>
<p>For cardiovascular health and general brain health</p>
<p>and musculoskeletal health, plus resistance exercise.</p>
<p>Is that more or less the contour of what you recommend?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s more or less the contour.</p>
<p>The more you&rsquo;re doing your zone two cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>the slightly less important a long duration</p>
<p>of caloric restriction is.</p>
<p>Interesting, and that brings us to caloric restriction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very clear that caloric restriction</p>
<p>can allow one to lose weight, right?</p>
<p>This is the classic Kiko, C-I-C-O,</p>
<p>calories in, calories out.</p>
<p>We are not disputing calories in, calories out.</p>
<p>Somehow that always has to be stated 50 times in any forum</p>
<p>because of whatever follows,</p>
<p>people I think will anchor to and assume</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t mean that,</p>
<p>but I know you and I both agree on calories in,</p>
<p>calories out as a fundamental law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s clear to me that based on what I&rsquo;ve read,</p>
<p>that when one is in a slight caloric surplus,</p>
<p>that hormones like testosterone can be optimized.</p>
<p>But is that true for somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s showing up with excessive body fat?</p>
<p>How does this all work?</p>
<p>Because body fat is manufacturing enzymes</p>
<p>that convert testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>So in other words, how does someone know</p>
<p>if they should use caloric restriction</p>
<p>or avoid caloric restriction?</p>
<p>Yeah, here&rsquo;s how to parse that out.</p>
<p>So before I delve into the details a bit more,</p>
<p>I should say as a board-certified</p>
<p>obesity medicine physician,</p>
<p>obviously the laws of thermodynamics apply.</p>
<p>And then in addition to that,</p>
<p>there is nothing special about intermittent fasting</p>
<p>or caloric restriction or exercise</p>
<p>when it pertains to losing body weight in general.</p>
<p>When you do lose weight,</p>
<p>about 33% of that is lean body mass</p>
<p>and about 10% of fat cells, adipose cells,</p>
<p>are actually lean body mass as well,</p>
<p>because it has proteins and water</p>
<p>and things like that in it too.</p>
<p>So the reason for exercise</p>
<p>and the reason for caloric restriction in general,</p>
<p>including intermittent fasting, is health reasons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you increase your health span.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily gonna make the weight</p>
<p>on the scale change, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter as much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been fairly well studied in both mice and humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to study in mice.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a precursor to our six types of people,</p>
<p>the ones that care about my studies</p>
<p>and the ones that care about human studies.</p>
<p>But if you calorically restrict mice by 40%,</p>
<p>then they can have improved testosterone parameters,</p>
<p>but only if they&rsquo;re obese to start.</p>
<p>And it appears to be that same way in humans as well.</p>
<p>So the easy way to think about it is if you&rsquo;re obese</p>
<p>or you have metabolic syndrome,</p>
<p>caloric restriction will improve your testosterone.</p>
<p>There has been a study,</p>
<p>and they talk about all these studies in a systematic review</p>
<p>from the Mayo Clinic proceedings in March of last year.</p>
<p>And they note that there is a study in young, healthy men,</p>
<p>and they calorically restrict them,</p>
<p>and their testosterone does decrease.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re young and healthy</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have metabolic syndrome,</p>
<p>then caloric restriction</p>
<p>will likely decrease your testosterone.</p>
<p>That clarifies a lot for me,</p>
<p>and I believe it will clarify a lot</p>
<p>for other people as well.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m delighted that you pointed out</p>
<p>this distinction about intermittent fasting</p>
<p>not being the only way to achieve caloric restriction.</p>
<p>There are a number of young, healthy,</p>
<p>or older healthy people I know</p>
<p>who like using intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not trying to lose weight,</p>
<p>for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>Some believe that it might extend lifespan.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s still a bit of an open question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a hard experiment to do</p>
<p>because the control group is,</p>
<p>no one wants to be in the control group, as I say.</p>
<p>A dozen mice, captive audience.</p>
<p>Exactly, and the other feature of it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit tricky is that</p>
<p>many people like intermittent fasting</p>
<p>because of the mental effects,</p>
<p>the clarity of mind that they feel during fasting,</p>
<p>the increased pleasure in eating when they finally do eat.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m referring to intermittent fasting of the sort</p>
<p>where eating windows are anywhere</p>
<p>from eight to 12 hours a day,</p>
<p>not extended fast of 24 hours or more.</p>
<p>So the question, therefore,</p>
<p>is for the healthy, lean enough person, right?</p>
<p>Non-obese person, is intermittent fasting a bad idea</p>
<p>in terms of hormone health?</p>
<p>Is oscillating between this period of kind of feast</p>
<p>and famine within a 24 hours a problem</p>
<p>if one is getting sufficient calories to maintain weight?</p>
<p>Yeah, so if they&rsquo;re in a caloric maintenance,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not going to be deleterious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be bad for their hormone health.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of different hormones</p>
<p>that we can talk about.</p>
<p>We can talk about testosterone.</p>
<p>We can talk about DHEA, which you usually go hand in hand.</p>
<p>And then we can also talk about growth hormone,</p>
<p>which is not a steroid hormone, but it&rsquo;s a peptide hormone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a chain of proteins,</p>
<p>amino acids that are put together instead of a sterol.</p>
<p>Think of sterol hormones as coming from cholesterol.</p>
<p>So intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>you do get a little spike in growth hormone after you eat,</p>
<p>but you also get a huge spike in growth hormone,</p>
<p>a more significant, less negligible spike overnight.</p>
<p>And that is improved if you are intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably gonna help your growth hormone</p>
<p>and subsequently IGF-1 levels,</p>
<p>which will help more in older age groups</p>
<p>than younger age groups.</p>
<p>And I like to eat dinner.</p>
<p>So for me, that means sometime around six or seven o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>sometimes eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>I confess last night, because I was working late,</p>
<p>I ate pretty big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically my only meal of the day.</p>
<p>At 10 o&rsquo;clock, that&rsquo;s a rare thing for me.</p>
<p>Can I still achieve a high degree of growth hormone output</p>
<p>if I, let&rsquo;s say I avoid food in the two to three hours</p>
<p>before going to sleep?</p>
<p>Or does one have to be very deep into a fast</p>
<p>in order to achieve the increase in growth hormone?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still pretty good growth hormone output,</p>
<p>even if you eat two or three hours before you sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the law of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>The longer you go, you get slightly more and slightly more.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And I know a number of people think of growth hormone</p>
<p>in the context of the exogenous growth hormone</p>
<p>and the fact that that can, in some cases,</p>
<p>be associated with cancers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked many times before,</p>
<p>can the increase in growth hormone</p>
<p>from things like saunas or intermittent fasting</p>
<p>cause levels of growth hormone that are so high</p>
<p>that they cause cancers?</p>
<p>My impulse is to say no,</p>
<p>that seems like it&rsquo;s not likely to happen,</p>
<p>but I should probably verify that statement with you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so quite unlikely.</p>
<p>I think about growth hormone and especially IGF-1.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually an IGF-1 and IGF-2,</p>
<p>but I think about it in terms of endocrine IGF-1,</p>
<p>mostly IGF-1 that&rsquo;s synthesized in the liver</p>
<p>and released in the liver versus IGF-1 that&rsquo;s released.</p>
<p>Classically, an example of this would be</p>
<p>your IGF-1 levels increase</p>
<p>after resistance training or exercise.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s more like paracrine or autocrine</p>
<p>and they have more local action.</p>
<p>So that IGF-1, it&rsquo;s pretty well studied</p>
<p>that if you just give people IGF-1,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to, at physiologic levels,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna improve their body composition.</p>
<p>However, that IGF-1 that&rsquo;s autocrine and paracrine</p>
<p>just working in those local tissues and muscles</p>
<p>is likely part of the reason why you get</p>
<p>a improved body composition response after exercise.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And just to clarify for me and for others,</p>
<p>what can we say are the major functions of IGF-1 and IGF-2</p>
<p>that are distinct from just growth hormone?</p>
<p>Are they just kind of the active form of growth hormone,</p>
<p>the kind of the pickaxe end of the assembly line?</p>
<p>So they have a much longer duration of action.</p>
<p>I believe the half-life of IGF-1 is several days,</p>
<p>almost a week,</p>
<p>whereas growth hormone has an extremely fast half-life</p>
<p>of only hours.</p>
<p>So growth hormone acts significantly on the liver</p>
<p>to produce IGF-1.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s around in the serum, in the blood long enough</p>
<p>to where it&rsquo;s producing an effect pretty much all the time.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Well, and then your other pillars, stress,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about stress on this podcast before</p>
<p>and tools for managing stress.</p>
<p>Sleep obviously is a big one.</p>
<p>I think if nothing else,</p>
<p>I will either put people to sleep with my podcasts,</p>
<p>certainly not this one, but my solo episodes,</p>
<p>or hopefully convince people that sleep is the foundation</p>
<p>of mental and physical health and performance.</p>
<p>Are there any aspects of hormone optimization</p>
<p>that can improve sleep?</p>
<p>I know sleep can improve hormone optimization,</p>
<p>but are there any aspects of hormone optimization</p>
<p>that can improve sleep?</p>
<p>And for people that are suffering</p>
<p>from this common syndrome of going to sleep</p>
<p>and then waking up at three or four in the morning,</p>
<p>we know that can be associated with depression,</p>
<p>but are there any hormonal indications</p>
<p>that might lead to that kind of situation?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s three big ones.</p>
<p>The first one is not super common,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very direct correlation.</p>
<p>If you have a growth hormone deficiency,</p>
<p>a true deficiency, whether you&rsquo;re an adult or a child,</p>
<p>then your sleep is likely going to be affected.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a child with growth hormone deficiency.</p>
<p>Once that is replaced with therapy,</p>
<p>your sleep is gonna get significantly better.</p>
<p>The second one that&rsquo;s a very common scenario</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re having what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>vasomotor symptoms of menopause</p>
<p>or vasomotor symptoms of andropause,</p>
<p>which are also applicable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where your progestogenic activity,</p>
<p>so your main progestogens are progesterone</p>
<p>and then pregnenolone,</p>
<p>and then 5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone,</p>
<p>which is-</p>
<p>Where are those manufactured in the body?</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re manufactured in a few places.</p>
<p>In men, they&rsquo;re manufactured some in the testes,</p>
<p>in the leydig cells.</p>
<p>In women, they&rsquo;re manufactured in the ovaries</p>
<p>until menopause,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re also manufactured in the adrenal glands.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re pre-adrenopausal,</p>
<p>where your adrenal glands are still working fairly well,</p>
<p>you usually still have a decent amount</p>
<p>of progesterone around,</p>
<p>and this can be measured too.</p>
<p>So, after menopause,</p>
<p>women make progesterone from their ovaries,</p>
<p>or sorry, from their adrenal glands.</p>
<p>If that progesterone crosses the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s 5-alpha and 3-alpha reduced,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s modified a little bit,</p>
<p>then it is both a GABA agonist,</p>
<p>which helps sleep just like GABA does,</p>
<p>gamma-aminobutyric acid,</p>
<p>the main inhibitory neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>of which lots of things work on.</p>
<p>Alcohol works on GABA as well.</p>
<p>GABA, pentin also works on GABA.</p>
<p>Migraine medicines, many of them work on GABA.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines and also non-benzos.</p>
<p>So, an example of a benzo would be Xanax.</p>
<p>An example of a non-benzo would be Ambien.</p>
<p>So, those all work on GABA.</p>
<p>So, GABA is also helped</p>
<p>by the progestogenic activity as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why a lot of women in menopause</p>
<p>feel like their sleep is much worse,</p>
<p>is because they have lower activity of those progestogens.</p>
<p>And for men in so-called andropause, low testosterone,</p>
<p>is that also one of the causes of poor sleep?</p>
<p>Low testosterone can lead to poor sleep,</p>
<p>but my third scenario is actually if a man begins TRT,</p>
<p>then they develop poor sleep because of sleep apnea.</p>
<p>It drastically raises the risk</p>
<p>that somebody is going to have sleep apnea.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people,</p>
<p>especially when they first start it</p>
<p>in the first month or two,</p>
<p>it puts them into this hypersympathetic state</p>
<p>because they have overactive androgen receptors,</p>
<p>especially after a long time of being hypogonadal.</p>
<p>Then they have a physiologic dose of TRT,</p>
<p>and that causes the sleep issue itself.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I have a lot of questions</p>
<p>about TRT, testosterone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>I should just mention that when you say</p>
<p>it increases sympathetic activity,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t mean that taking testosterone</p>
<p>increases sympathy for others.</p>
<p>It may in fact do the opposite.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s very clear from my discussions</p>
<p>with my colleagues in the endocrinology side,</p>
<p>and also with the great Dr. Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>that increasing testosterone</p>
<p>merely exacerbates existing features of people.</p>
<p>So the jerks become bigger jerks,</p>
<p>kind of people become even more kind in general.</p>
<p>But I wanna get into TRT in depth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very interesting to me to hear</p>
<p>that testosterone replacement therapy</p>
<p>increases the risk of sleep apnea.</p>
<p>And I wanna make sure that I ask that,</p>
<p>is that also the case in people</p>
<p>that are using TRT who are not hypogonadal?</p>
<p>Because in the classic situation</p>
<p>is somebody isn&rsquo;t making enough testosterone,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re below 300 nanograms per deciliter on the chart,</p>
<p>they go and intake TRT.</p>
<p>But many people nowadays,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be honest, are taking doses of testosterone,</p>
<p>even though they are in the sort of standard range</p>
<p>because the range is so large</p>
<p>because of other symptomology.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I do love the analogy that Dr. Sapolsky had</p>
<p>about monks taking testosterone</p>
<p>and making them more and more generous.</p>
<p>So that does appear to be what testosterone usually does</p>
<p>is it exacerbates, if you will,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re previously like.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not gonna change you as a person.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re eugonadal before you start testosterone,</p>
<p>Meaning you have normal testosterone</p>
<p>and then you start TRT or self-administered TRT,</p>
<p>steroids, however you wanna look at it,</p>
<p>then your risk of sleep apnea still goes up</p>
<p>in a dose-dependent fashion.</p>
<p>So the higher the dose, the more risky.</p>
<p>With the sympathetic</p>
<p>and the parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>the sympathetic is the fight or flight nervous system.</p>
<p>The parasympathetic is the rest and digest.</p>
<p>So if you have too much fight or flight</p>
<p>and stress can cause that too,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not gonna rest as well at night.</p>
<p>I wanna touch on testosterone in women</p>
<p>because there is testosterone in women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know where that testosterone comes from,</p>
<p>which tissues.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know whether or not</p>
<p>testosterone replacement therapy makes sense in women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing more and more about women using testosterone.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to know whether or not</p>
<p>knowing a woman&rsquo;s testosterone,</p>
<p>for her to know her testosterone</p>
<p>is of equal, less than, or more value</p>
<p>than knowing, for instance,</p>
<p>progesterone and estrogen levels,</p>
<p>because I think there are a lot of misconceptions</p>
<p>about the roles of testosterone in women.</p>
<p>For health optimization,</p>
<p>testosterone is just as important to know.</p>
<p>For pathology prevention, for example,</p>
<p>breast cancer, osteoporosis,</p>
<p>estrogen and progesterone are more important to know.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re thinking about women,</p>
<p>women think that they have such a tiny amount</p>
<p>of testosterone because you test it.</p>
<p>Most people test a free testosterone,</p>
<p>so testosterone that&rsquo;s unbound,</p>
<p>which is by far the smallest proportion of testosterone.</p>
<p>Any androgen is bound by lots of different</p>
<p>steroid-binding proteins,</p>
<p>but the ones that are most pertinent</p>
<p>are called SHBG or sex hormone-binding globulin,</p>
<p>and that binds the androgenic steroid,</p>
<p>for example, DHT or dihydrotestosterone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with prostate enlargement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>It binds that the most strongly,</p>
<p>and then it binds testosterone next most strongly,</p>
<p>and then it binds things like androstenedione</p>
<p>or DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone,</p>
<p>and then it binds the estrogens,</p>
<p>the weakest, like estradiol.</p>
<p>So if you look at the total amount of testosterone,</p>
<p>women actually have, almost all women, not all women,</p>
<p>but almost all of them have significantly more testosterone</p>
<p>than estradiol,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s in different measurements.</p>
<p>So estradiol, a lot of time, is grams per mil</p>
<p>as opposed to nanograms per deciliter.</p>
<p>So women have more testosterone than estrogen</p>
<p>and significantly more DHEA than either.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Do women make dihydrotestosterone?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And where does this testosterone come from?</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t have testes.</p>
<p>Yeah, so most testosterone in women that are premenopausal</p>
<p>can come from theca cells, T-H-E-C-A.</p>
<p>So theca cells are cells in the ovaries</p>
<p>that can produce testosterone.</p>
<p>And a lot of people have actually heard about hyperthecosis,</p>
<p>not the term itself,</p>
<p>but a lot of Olympians that are,</p>
<p>their chromosomes are XY, they&rsquo;re females,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not taking any PEDs.</p>
<p>Wait, they&rsquo;re XY, but they&rsquo;re females?</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, they&rsquo;re XX.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re XX, they&rsquo;re not XY.</p>
<p>And they have never transitioned</p>
<p>or been on any sort of hormone replacement or testosterone,</p>
<p>but they naturally produce a huge amount of testosterone,</p>
<p>as much as many men.</p>
<p>And some of these women,</p>
<p>I believe they were from Botswana,</p>
<p>were banned from competing in the Olympics</p>
<p>in certain distances.</p>
<p>I believe they were banned from the 400 meter and 800 meter</p>
<p>because their natural testosterone was deemed to be too high.</p>
<p>So they mistakenly thought that they were using steroids.</p>
<p>They actually knew they were not using steroids.</p>
<p>They knew it was their theca cells</p>
<p>were just genetically gifted, I suppose,</p>
<p>and they still made them change distances.</p>
<p>So one or two of these athletes changed to,</p>
<p>I believe it was a 3K or the 5K,</p>
<p>and they still did quite well,</p>
<p>but it was not their best event.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s turning out to be a very interesting</p>
<p>and controversial area of this notion of hormone therapies</p>
<p>and natural variation in hormones</p>
<p>on different chromosomal backgrounds.</p>
<p>Fascinating, we should probably do a whole episode</p>
<p>about that because it&rsquo;s very much of the times.</p>
<p>So men and women both make DHT.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask about DHT in men.</p>
<p>So often we hear about testosterone in men</p>
<p>and free testosterone and being the unbound form, of course,</p>
<p>but dihydrotestosterone, where does it come from in men?</p>
<p>What is the cascade of events that takes testosterone</p>
<p>to dihydrotestosterone?</p>
<p>And what are some of the quote unquote positive</p>
<p>and negative effects of,</p>
<p>here I&rsquo;m only referring to endogenous dihydrotestosterone.</p>
<p>And in fact, I&rsquo;ll make it very clear whether or not</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about taking something</p>
<p>or one&rsquo;s own natural production.</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;re just, I think up until now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve just been talking about natural production.</p>
<p>So tell us about DHT in men.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a powerful hormone during development, obviously,</p>
<p>but what is it doing?</p>
<p>DHT is a very androgenic hormone.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re talking about DHEA,</p>
<p>which is a mild, a weak androgen,</p>
<p>or testosterone, which is a relatively strong androgen,</p>
<p>or DHT, which is a very strong androgen,</p>
<p>they bind to the androgen receptor</p>
<p>in both men and in women.</p>
<p>So the effect of all three of those</p>
<p>is mediated by the androgen receptor.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of different beta-estradiol receptors</p>
<p>and alpha-estradiol receptors,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s only one androgen receptor.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, it is on the X chromosome.</p>
<p>So men get their androgen receptor gene from their mother.</p>
<p>Women get one androgen receptor gene from their father,</p>
<p>one from their mother.</p>
<p>Often the one that is more sensitive to androgens</p>
<p>and people with PCOS, that&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s active.</p>
<p>The other one is methylated and inactive.</p>
<p>Can I just pause you one second?</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt, but I have to ask this question</p>
<p>before I forget, and I know a number of people</p>
<p>are probably wondering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that whether or not one develops</p>
<p>male pattern baldness,</p>
<p>whether or not a male develops male pattern baldness,</p>
<p>just to be very precise,</p>
<p>you could get some information about that</p>
<p>by looking at your mother&rsquo;s father,</p>
<p>and that would, in keeping with what you just described,</p>
<p>that the X chromosome, which of course</p>
<p>is handed off through the mother,</p>
<p>is carrying the genes that encode</p>
<p>for the number and distribution of these androgen receptors</p>
<p>that DHT will bind to.</p>
<p>Because of course, I think as you&rsquo;ll probably tell us,</p>
<p>that DHT is responsible for male pattern baldness</p>
<p>and beard growth, is that right?</p>
<p>Should I look at my grandfather or my mother&rsquo;s side</p>
<p>to determine what I&rsquo;m likely to look like</p>
<p>in terms of my DHT-ness?</p>
<p>Is that a word?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the best guess that you can make</p>
<p>purely from phenotypes.</p>
<p>And you can measure your genotype</p>
<p>and get a better idea of that.</p>
<p>Assuming that it&rsquo;s true male pattern baldness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s related to the gene transcription</p>
<p>of the androgen receptor.</p>
<p>So I like to think of it as how much</p>
<p>of this androgen receptor gene</p>
<p>is activated by any androgen.</p>
<p>So if you have an extremely sensitive gene,</p>
<p>which usually means you have very few CAG repeats,</p>
<p>which is basically just a certain,</p>
<p>CAG encodes for a certain amino acid.</p>
<p>And if you have very few of the repeats,</p>
<p>then your androgen receptor gene works better.</p>
<p>Think of it as a corollary to Huntington&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>where if you have very few of what we call</p>
<p>trinucleotide repeats,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not as severe of a disease.</p>
<p>But after you get more and more CAG repeats,</p>
<p>which by the way, in the population,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting more and more CAG repeats.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a natural selection of process</p>
<p>that has been ongoing for a variety of number of reasons.</p>
<p>But anyway, if you have more repeats,</p>
<p>then that gene activates in the cytoplasm</p>
<p>and moves to the nucleus</p>
<p>and causes gene transcription more often</p>
<p>and hair loss more often.</p>
<p>So does that mean that we&rsquo;re seeing more hair loss now</p>
<p>due to elevated levels of DHT than we were 50 years ago?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>The hair loss 50 years ago,</p>
<p>well, not 50 years ago,</p>
<p>but 500 years ago was probably more significant</p>
<p>because on average, 500 years ago,</p>
<p>people were more sensitive to androgens.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a syndrome called</p>
<p>androgen insensitivity syndrome, AIS.</p>
<p>And that syndrome was related to when men</p>
<p>who have the copy from their mother, who is a carrier,</p>
<p>their AR gene or androgen receptor gene</p>
<p>is completely insensitive.</p>
<p>So think of it, it doesn&rsquo;t have a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not related to the CAG repeats,</p>
<p>but think of that receptor as just not working at all.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a continuum.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s receptor works a little bit better</p>
<p>or a little bit worse.</p>
<p>And the better your receptor works,</p>
<p>the more likely you are to have male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>To zoom out from this, but still keeping an eye on DHT,</p>
<p>what do you like to see all women and all men do</p>
<p>to optimize DHT?</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m talking about regardless of age.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re still in this from puberty onward phase.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t yet micro dissected out decade by decade,</p>
<p>which we will do.</p>
<p>But what do you like to see people do to keep DHT in check?</p>
<p>But before you tell us that,</p>
<p>could you tell us what positive things DHT does</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s in the proper range?</p>
<p>Yeah, so DHT helps a lot for the same reason</p>
<p>why testosterone helps.</p>
<p>It activates the androgen receptor gene.</p>
<p>It helps effort feel good.</p>
<p>So it can be motivating.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s active in the CNS.</p>
<p>It also is active in cardiovascular tissue.</p>
<p>So if you look at someone that has heart failure,</p>
<p>or if someone has cardiac hypertrophy,</p>
<p>the level of DHT can matter</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also binding to the androgen receptor</p>
<p>in the myocardium or in the heart itself.</p>
<p>So you think of the classic bodybuilder heart.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an easy example to make.</p>
<p>They have very thickened muscle.</p>
<p>Their muscle is very strong because they&rsquo;re pumping blood</p>
<p>often with high blood pressure.</p>
<p>And that DHT and the testosterone and any DHT derivatives</p>
<p>like Masterone or Oxandrolone, Premobolin</p>
<p>also bind to the heart and they cause even more hypertrophy</p>
<p>or enlargement of that muscle tissue.</p>
<p>So then let&rsquo;s say the person stops in their recovering</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to have cardiac remodeling,</p>
<p>which is where you take a very thick heart</p>
<p>and cardiac remodeling is important</p>
<p>in a lot of different cardiac pathologies.</p>
<p>But if you give them finasteride or dutasteride,</p>
<p>which inhibit the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT,</p>
<p>so making less activity at the androgen receptor gene,</p>
<p>they have cardiac remodeling and their heart health improves.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So for the non-bodybuilder, the typical woman or man</p>
<p>or younger or older, what sorts of things support DHT</p>
<p>and thereby heart health?</p>
<p>Presumably DHT is involved in some of the other things</p>
<p>that testosterone is famous for in both men and women.</p>
<p>Things like libido, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>making effort feel good.</p>
<p>So motivation drive and vitality.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s be the general phrase.</p>
<p>What sorts of things support DHT?</p>
<p>What sorts of things create problems for DHT?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of dietary changes and supplementation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re probably doing right now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s affecting your DHT.</p>
<p>You mean me personally?</p>
<p>Well, everybody, all of the listeners,</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s say you have a diet high in plant polyphenols.</p>
<p>Many of those inhibit the enzyme</p>
<p>that converts testosterone to DHT.</p>
<p>Could you give us an example of one of those,</p>
<p>either in supplementation form or in food form?</p>
<p>Curcumins, certain curcuminoids,</p>
<p>depending on the structure,</p>
<p>will inhibit the enzyme called 5-alpha reductase</p>
<p>that converts testosterone to DHT.</p>
<p>Turmeric.</p>
<p>Yeah, turmeric, black pepper extract.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s used often to increase bioavailability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also called biopurine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor.</p>
<p>So, and on top of that, people have different genetics too.</p>
<p>So some people, their 5-alpha reductase enzymes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s three of them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on chromosome two, three, and four, I believe.</p>
<p>But some of them are active in the prostate.</p>
<p>Some of them are active in the brain.</p>
<p>And so it depends on which tissue.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tissue-specific enzymes</p>
<p>that depend on how much DHT you convert.</p>
<p>Do you recommend that people avoid curcumin and turmeric</p>
<p>for that reason?</p>
<p>And is there any specific recommendations</p>
<p>for men versus women?</p>
<p>If a man or a woman, by the way, in women,</p>
<p>a lot of times if you just ask your doctor for a DHT check,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same unit as in men.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s essentially undetectable.</p>
<p>So you have to, you know,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re on oral contraceptives,</p>
<p>which is a different topic,</p>
<p>their DHT is very likely undetectable,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s free DHT.</p>
<p>You can measure both a DHT and a free DHT.</p>
<p>But if someone&rsquo;s DHT is already low</p>
<p>or if they have somewhat insensitive androgen receptor</p>
<p>via genetics or via lifestyle,</p>
<p>then I recommend they avoid bioavailable curcuminoids</p>
<p>like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract,</p>
<p>and they might be a good candidate for creatine.</p>
<p>Creatine, like creatine monohydrate,</p>
<p>can significantly increase the conversion</p>
<p>of testosterone to DHT.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of really interesting data</p>
<p>coming out now about the role of creatine</p>
<p>as a brain fuel</p>
<p>and maybe even as a cognitive enhancer over time.</p>
<p>The data are still ongoing,</p>
<p>but some of the studies in humans are pretty impressive,</p>
<p>at least to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned this thing</p>
<p>about curcumin and black pepper.</p>
<p>I wish we&rsquo;d had this conversation six years ago</p>
<p>because I had the experience of jumping on the bandwagon</p>
<p>of the excitement around turmeric,</p>
<p>and I took a turmeric supplement.</p>
<p>It was a couple of capsules of what I thought to be,</p>
<p>and I think was high quality turmeric.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never felt as poor as I did</p>
<p>in the subsequent few days.</p>
<p>Flatline of, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>everything that one would want to have in life,</p>
<p>energy, vitality, just, it was a cliff.</p>
<p>And a friend somehow knew</p>
<p>that curcumin could inhibit 5-alpha reductase.</p>
<p>It converts testosterone to DHT, as you pointed out.</p>
<p>I stopped taking it.</p>
<p>It was the only new addition to my diet and supplementation,</p>
<p>and things bounced back within about three, four days,</p>
<p>but it was remarkable.</p>
<p>I mean, I felt like garbage.</p>
<p>And it was actually kind of frightening</p>
<p>to experience the sharpness of that cliff.</p>
<p>But I know that some people like turmeric</p>
<p>for its anti-inflammatory properties, et cetera.</p>
<p>Sounds like people either need to experiment or,</p>
<p>and if they do, obviously, to approach that with caution.</p>
<p>Anytime you add or remove something,</p>
<p>you need to talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a doctor, and I&rsquo;m guessing that</p>
<p>if one were to experiment,</p>
<p>would you say that most of these effects</p>
<p>of things like curcumin are reversible as they were in me,</p>
<p>or is there any potential of permanent damage</p>
<p>if people have been taking them for a long time?</p>
<p>The effects are nearly always reversible.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking about 5-alpha reductase inhibition,</p>
<p>so what turmeric does, but stronger,</p>
<p>the most common story that we hear</p>
<p>is regarding a supplement known as saw palmetto,</p>
<p>which a lot of older men take for their prostate health,</p>
<p>or finasteride, which you can take for your prostate,</p>
<p>or your heart, or your hair, or dutasteride.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re having side effects on these,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s probably because of a couple different reasons.</p>
<p>One can be your ratio of androgens to estrogens is off,</p>
<p>and that needs addressed.</p>
<p>Another one can be it&rsquo;s inhibiting the conversion</p>
<p>of your progesterone to that other type of progesterone,</p>
<p>the 5-alpha, 3-alpha that we talked about earlier</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s helping with your sleep,</p>
<p>and your brain, and your calmness,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s definitely an effect.</p>
<p>Another one is depending on the type of supplement or med,</p>
<p>they inhibit different isoenzymes</p>
<p>of that 5-alpha reductase.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re just inhibiting one and two,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s gonna be a different effect</p>
<p>than if they&rsquo;re inhibiting two and three.</p>
<p>So finasteride does two and three,</p>
<p>saw palmetto does one and two,</p>
<p>and then dutasteride does all three.</p>
<p>The third one is active in the brain,</p>
<p>and dutasteride inhibits that third one</p>
<p>a little bit weaker in vivo, but strongly in vitro.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to parse out.</p>
<p>You can use biofeedback and experimentation.</p>
<p>I do think with supplements, it&rsquo;s safe to experiment.</p>
<p>The time that it takes to set in</p>
<p>is usually about three months.</p>
<p>So the risk of, and this is anecdotally,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been lots of research published</p>
<p>about if post-finasteride syndrome is real or fake,</p>
<p>and it is real, but it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a combination of organic and inorganic disease,</p>
<p>almost kind of like fibromyalgia,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s definitely real,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s lots of things that you can do to help with it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very unlikely to occur</p>
<p>if you stop taking your supplement or medication</p>
<p>after you have side effects.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Well, I certainly feel better</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m taking five grams of creatine monohydrate per day.</p>
<p>I know most people take it for muscle growth</p>
<p>and tissue repair and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Mainly, I think brings water</p>
<p>into the muscle tissue, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I take it for the brain effects,</p>
<p>and also because I like to think</p>
<p>that it gives me a little bit of a DHT bump</p>
<p>that I can actually see in my blood charts</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;ve done them.</p>
<p>I know many people want to avoid the hair loss</p>
<p>that can sometimes be associated</p>
<p>with DHT levels going too high.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been asked many times,</p>
<p>does creatine monohydrate cause hair loss?</p>
<p>It would make sense that if creatine increases DHT and DHT,</p>
<p>binding to the androgen receptor on the scalp</p>
<p>can induce hair loss, that that would be the case.</p>
<p>Is that true, or are people just overly concerned</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s trivial or non-existent?</p>
<p>Each male, and so yes, it can potentially add it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to say it causes it,</p>
<p>but it can be a little bit more fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>So just like everybody has a different sensitivity</p>
<p>of their androgen receptor,</p>
<p>they have a different amount of gene transcription</p>
<p>that is going to cause death of the follicle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an arbitrary threshold.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t really know until you start losing hair.</p>
<p>And if somebody takes a little bit of creatine</p>
<p>to increase their DHT,</p>
<p>maybe for the cognitive enhancing effects</p>
<p>or for whatever reason,</p>
<p>and they notice a little bit more hair</p>
<p>falling off out in the sink,</p>
<p>and they stop taking it,</p>
<p>you said death of the follicle, which sounds very dramatic.</p>
<p>Are those little stem cell niches</p>
<p>that reside in the follicle, which hairs grow from,</p>
<p>are those then abolished?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no going back,</p>
<p>or can one rescue the hair?</p>
<p>It takes months.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re still there,</p>
<p>the hair will come back.</p>
<p>So the loss of the hair itself</p>
<p>is a normal part of the hair cycle.</p>
<p>So you have your antigen phase,</p>
<p>your catagen phase, your telogen phase,</p>
<p>and then your hair loss,</p>
<p>and then a new follicle.</p>
<p>Of the stem cell niche in the hair follicle.</p>
<p>Think of it like sharks have teeth.</p>
<p>So a shark loses a tooth</p>
<p>and they have a new one that comes through,</p>
<p>or losing your baby tooth and you have a new one,</p>
<p>but your hair just always keeps coming through.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s natural for it to die and lose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when you start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors,</p>
<p>often you have a big shed.</p>
<p>So what happens during that big shed</p>
<p>is all of these cells that are unhealthy,</p>
<p>they immediately jettison that hair,</p>
<p>and then they start making a much healthier new follicle.</p>
<p>So out of the hairs</p>
<p>that are at the end of their telogen phase,</p>
<p>then they have what&rsquo;s called telogen effluvium,</p>
<p>which also happens after pregnancy,</p>
<p>also happens in thyroid pathologies.</p>
<p>So you shed it, a new one comes in place,</p>
<p>and you think that you&rsquo;re having a horrible hair loss</p>
<p>caused by your finasteride or whatever you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>and minoxidil does this too,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re really just having a new, healthier follicle.</p>
<p>If you go a really long time, if you go a year,</p>
<p>then those hairs might come back and they might not.</p>
<p>So for simplicity&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>if somebody is concerned about</p>
<p>or is experiencing hair loss, male or female,</p>
<p>what are their options of ways to offset that hair loss</p>
<p>that are not going to negatively impact</p>
<p>other tissue sensitive to DHT?</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m basically saying here is,</p>
<p>I could imagine taking a DHT inhibitor,</p>
<p>a pill of some sort or an injection of some sort,</p>
<p>and offsetting hair loss,</p>
<p>maybe even stimulating more hair growth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that I&rsquo;m not doing that,</p>
<p>but I know people that do,</p>
<p>but then experience some of the other negative effects</p>
<p>of blunting DHT, reduced affect, reduced libido,</p>
<p>reduced drive, disruptions in prostate function,</p>
<p>or even sexual function generally.</p>
<p>So what can people do if they want to maintain</p>
<p>or grow back hair,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t want all those other effects?</p>
<p>What should they avoid?</p>
<p>And what should they perhaps consider</p>
<p>talking to their doctor about?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole host of options.</p>
<p>I try to separate alopecia or hair loss</p>
<p>into two different categories,</p>
<p>male pattern baldness or androgenic alopecia,</p>
<p>also known as androgenetic alopecia,</p>
<p>versus other types of alopecia,</p>
<p>usually telogen effluviums.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s androgenetic alopecia or male pattern baldness,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re female, perhaps say PCOS,</p>
<p>something like that,</p>
<p>then you want some sort of strategy</p>
<p>to decrease the activity of that androgen receptor.</p>
<p>So women can get male pattern baldness?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna have to wrap my head around that one,</p>
<p>but okay.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of different things</p>
<p>that you can do that are topical.</p>
<p>The most promising is called dutasteride mesotherapy.</p>
<p>Essentially what it is,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s very localized injections in areas</p>
<p>that are prone to male pattern baldness,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re a female or a male,</p>
<p>and it acts locally only.</p>
<p>And you repeat these injections from time to time.</p>
<p>It decreases the conversion of testosterone to DHT</p>
<p>just in the scalp.</p>
<p>So that can avoid prostate effects.</p>
<p>And what are some of the negative effects</p>
<p>of blocking DHT in females in the periphery,</p>
<p>meaning not on the scalp or in the brain,</p>
<p>but where is DHT doing its stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s both DHT</p>
<p>and then also that 5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone,</p>
<p>which is called THP or dihydroprogesterone</p>
<p>or tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re active in the central nervous system,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also just active, again,</p>
<p>binding to the androgen receptor in a female as well,</p>
<p>causing them to have that effort feel good motivation.</p>
<p>A lot of women that are sensitive to DHT,</p>
<p>because women can be sensitive to DHT as well,</p>
<p>feel very different when they start an oral contraceptive,</p>
<p>not because it alters their DHT to a huge amount.</p>
<p>It does to some degree</p>
<p>because of the negative feedback inhibition</p>
<p>in the pituitary and less produced in the ovaries,</p>
<p>but it increases SHBG really high.</p>
<p>So because their SHBGs are significantly higher,</p>
<p>their free DHT is way lower.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>How does a woman know</p>
<p>if she has PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?</p>
<p>What are the issues with polycystic ovarian syndrome?</p>
<p>What can be done about PCOS?</p>
<p>I confess I was naive to PCOS.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t supposed to rhyme,</p>
<p>but since it does, I do confess I was completely naive to it</p>
<p>and I started getting a lot of questions about it</p>
<p>in various forums.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually the reason</p>
<p>why I initially approached you.</p>
<p>I know you have treated a lot of PCOS.</p>
<p>What age women should be thinking about PCOS?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s PCOS?</p>
<p>Teach us about PCOS, please.</p>
<p>So PCOS is polycystic ovarian syndrome.</p>
<p>And this is one of those conditions which is underdiagnosed.</p>
<p>So its prevalence is much higher than we think it is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of studies</p>
<p>and some studies say prevalence of 10%, some say 20%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not completely clinically penetrant.</p>
<p>So most people don&rsquo;t know they have PCOS</p>
<p>until they have infertility or subfertility.</p>
<p>And is PCOS happening at this frequency</p>
<p>in 20-year-old women and 30-year-old women</p>
<p>and 40 and onward?</p>
<p>Most women find out they have PCOS in their 30s,</p>
<p>especially it&rsquo;s on a spectrum or a continuum</p>
<p>like a lot of things where you can have a weaker version</p>
<p>or a very severe version.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a criteria called the Rotterdam criteria.</p>
<p>And in the Rotterdam criteria,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple of different ways that you can diagnose it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking for androgen excess, insulin resistance,</p>
<p>and you can also look for polycystic ovaries.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually have to have polycystic ovaries</p>
<p>or get an ultrasound of your ovaries to be diagnosed.</p>
<p>If you have androgen excess, for example,</p>
<p>androgenic acne or hormonal acne.</p>
<p>If you have hair growth, like a hair growth on the chin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a hirsutism.</p>
<p>Or if you have, you know, like deepening of the voice,</p>
<p>at any symptom of too much male pattern baldness,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a female, that&rsquo;s a symptom of PCOS as well.</p>
<p>Then you can also have insulin resistance.</p>
<p>So this is obesity, it&rsquo;s prediabetes,</p>
<p>a high fasting insulin, a HOMA-IR over two,</p>
<p>and a fasting insulin of over six.</p>
<p>So if you have significant insulin resistance</p>
<p>and also androgen dominance, that&rsquo;s a sign of it.</p>
<p>Androgen dominance often leads</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s called oligominorrhea.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re having more than 35 day intervals</p>
<p>in between a period, or if you have less than nine per year,</p>
<p>then that can be a sign that you have oligo,</p>
<p>which means too little, minorrhea, which means menses.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very common sign of PCOS.</p>
<p>If you have infertility, so if you&rsquo;re under the age of 35</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been trying for more than a year,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re over the age of 35</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been trying for more than six months,</p>
<p>then that can also be, it&rsquo;s a very common</p>
<p>presenting complaint when somebody presents with PCOS.</p>
<p>And assuming that a woman is doing all these other things,</p>
<p>is paying attention to the six pillars</p>
<p>that you talked about earlier,</p>
<p>diet, exercise, caloric restriction, in some cases, right?</p>
<p>Not everyone needs to be caloric restricted.</p>
<p>Stress, sleep, and sunlight, spirit.</p>
<p>Assuming that they&rsquo;re doing all those things,</p>
<p>what other things in the realm of diet or supplementation</p>
<p>can help them avoid PCOS if they have subclinical PCOS</p>
<p>or they have not developed it, but don&rsquo;t want to develop it?</p>
<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t sound like a good thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so depending on where they are,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re very strong on the insulin resistance spectrum,</p>
<p>then optimizing their body composition,</p>
<p>decreasing their body fat,</p>
<p>and treating that metabolic syndrome can help.</p>
<p>So a lot of people ask, well, does everybody that&rsquo;s on,</p>
<p>like, does everybody need to be on metformin that has PCOS?</p>
<p>Not necessarily, but metformin is one of the tools</p>
<p>that can help with insulin sensitization.</p>
<p>Other tools that can help are inositol.</p>
<p>So myoinositol is an insulin sensitizer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cousin, D-chiral inositol, is a weak antiandrogen.</p>
<p>A lot of types of inositol have both of those in it.</p>
<p>So depending on if you&rsquo;re a female or a male</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on inositol, the type of inositol does matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a very important point.</p>
<p>Just today, I said, I&rsquo;m trying this new supplement,</p>
<p>inositol, for its role</p>
<p>in perhaps enhancing sleep even further.</p>
<p>My sleep&rsquo;s generally pretty good.</p>
<p>Lately, it&rsquo;s been a little bit off for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>So I took it for the first time last night</p>
<p>and I said, I thought it helped, just subjectively.</p>
<p>And you said, what kind of inositol is it?</p>
<p>Because inositol is a very potent androgen inhibitor.</p>
<p>It turns out I was taking myoinositol,</p>
<p>which is not an androgen inhibitor.</p>
<p>The other type that you mentioned,</p>
<p>which is an androgen inhibitor, is D-chiral inositol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually in a ratio of one to 25 or one to 40.</p>
<p>In a much lower amount compared to myoinositol.</p>
<p>In a supplement or in the body?</p>
<p>In a supplement to help induce ovulation.</p>
<p>But for women who have PCOS,</p>
<p>who might want to try and reduce androgen,</p>
<p>then they would perhaps want to take a form of inositol</p>
<p>that reduce the androgen receptor activity, correct?</p>
<p>They want both.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a woman and you&rsquo;ve ever talked to your doctor</p>
<p>about getting on the oral contraceptive or spironolactone,</p>
<p>which is also an anti-androgen,</p>
<p>but it happens to be a potassium-sparing</p>
<p>diuretic blood pressure medicine as well,</p>
<p>D-chiral inositol might be a better option.</p>
<p>DIM or diendomethane is another kind of weak</p>
<p>anti-estrogen, anti-androgen</p>
<p>that a lot of women should consider as well.</p>
<p>You mentioned oral contraception.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a few posts on these, let&rsquo;s just call them,</p>
<p>they really are perceptual effects</p>
<p>whereby it&rsquo;s been demonstrated in humans several times now.</p>
<p>And what would appear to me to be very solid studies</p>
<p>where women that take oral contraceptives,</p>
<p>there is both a shift in their perception of men,</p>
<p>because these studies only looked at heterosexual,</p>
<p>the sort of arrangements here,</p>
<p>where women who are on oral contraception,</p>
<p>because it blunts some of the peaks and valleys</p>
<p>of hormone output,</p>
<p>no longer experience the same peaks and valleys</p>
<p>in their assessment of other men&rsquo;s attractiveness.</p>
<p>So it sort of flattens their perception, so to speak.</p>
<p>They still find certain men attractive</p>
<p>and certain men unattractive,</p>
<p>but the degree of difference is kind of mellowed out.</p>
<p>And likewise, these data say that men</p>
<p>perceiving women&rsquo;s attractiveness,</p>
<p>they still see women on oral contraceptives as attractive,</p>
<p>but a woman taking oral contraception eliminates</p>
<p>this kind of peak in her attractiveness</p>
<p>that men would otherwise perceive.</p>
<p>In other words, oral contraceptives are changing the way</p>
<p>that we perceive each other,</p>
<p>at least in terms of these male-female experiments.</p>
<p>What is going on with that?</p>
<p>Is that because oral contraceptives</p>
<p>blunt the increase in testosterone</p>
<p>that occurs just before ovulation?</p>
<p>Or is it because of a complex cascade?</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>I find this fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s differences in how your,</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t use the word change necessarily,</p>
<p>but alter the severity or alter the peak, as you said.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just like TRT is not gonna change you as a person.</p>
<p>An oral contraceptive will not change you as a person.</p>
<p>It will just change your day-to-day peaks and troughs</p>
<p>in libido and attractiveness.</p>
<p>So one of the main effects of oral contraceptives,</p>
<p>almost all of them have a synthetic estrogen</p>
<p>and a synthetic progestogen in them.</p>
<p>One common type of synthetic estrogen is ethanol estradiol.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another new synthetic estrogen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s out there as well, but that anecdotally,</p>
<p>that seems to have even more side effects.</p>
<p>So this ethanol estradiol is 100 times more potent</p>
<p>than endogenous or bioidentical estradiol in the liver.</p>
<p>So it binds to the estrogen receptor in the liver,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to increase sex hormone binding globulin,</p>
<p>which secondarily, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>decreases your free testosterone</p>
<p>and especially your free DHT.</p>
<p>So that little testosterone hump that you get</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a female that&rsquo;s ovulating,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really flatlined.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s already, it&rsquo;s a pretty insignificant difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not negligible, but it&rsquo;s a little bit of a hump,</p>
<p>and you have significantly less of that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on an oral contraceptive.</p>
<p>And does that blunt the associated increase in libido</p>
<p>that normally would occur from that increase in androgen?</p>
<p>Yes. Interesting.</p>
<p>What about other forms of contraception, right?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s copper IUD, there&rsquo;s various implants,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s rings, there&rsquo;s a huge number</p>
<p>of different forms of these.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re talking about is, as I understand it,</p>
<p>is only the effect of oral contraception</p>
<p>that impacts hormone output.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of other effects as well.</p>
<p>For example, your choice of synthetic progestin</p>
<p>will alter how high your platelets and SHBG go.</p>
<p>It appears to be the higher your platelets</p>
<p>and the higher your SHBG, the higher risk of a blood clot.</p>
<p>So a lot of women know that</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re on an oral contraceptive</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re already predisposed to a blood clot</p>
<p>or a venous thromboembolism in their vein,</p>
<p>they have a blood clot in either their leg or their lung,</p>
<p>then it can increase that chance.</p>
<p>So you can choose a synthetic progestin</p>
<p>that is not going to have as high of a response,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s various pros and cons.</p>
<p>Some synthetic progestins are weak antiandrogens as well.</p>
<p>For example, there&rsquo;s one known as Slend,</p>
<p>which is made from spironolactone.</p>
<p>So some women are on spironolactone and that as well,</p>
<p>which is made from spironolactone,</p>
<p>which probably isn&rsquo;t particularly necessary</p>
<p>unless they need it for a diuretic or hypertensive effect.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna intentionally interrupt and I apologize,</p>
<p>but specifically because I wanted to ask about,</p>
<p>there is this notion that oral contraception</p>
<p>taken over long periods of time can disrupt fertility</p>
<p>in ways that are independent</p>
<p>of just the age-related decrease in fertility.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>It depends on what you mean by a long time.</p>
<p>Six to 12 months, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Past that, it seems very unlikely.</p>
<p>However, the persistently elevated SHBG</p>
<p>can be present for quite some time.</p>
<p>Wait, so if a woman takes oral contraception</p>
<p>for six to 12 months and then stops,</p>
<p>will she essentially be where she would have been anyway</p>
<p>in terms of her fertility at that age?</p>
<p>Or are you saying that it can cause permanent damage?</p>
<p>Her fertility would be equitable</p>
<p>as if she had never taken it,</p>
<p>if she&rsquo;s certainly 12 months, but probably six months off.</p>
<p>And what if she,</p>
<p>I know of women that have taken oral contraception</p>
<p>for many years.</p>
<p>In addition to the age-related decline in fertility</p>
<p>that occurs, that&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>Of course, the slope is gonna be different</p>
<p>depending on the individual,</p>
<p>but are they quickening the transition</p>
<p>to infertility?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>You could make a case that</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been in an oral contraceptive,</p>
<p>they may have been slightly more predisposed</p>
<p>to insulin resistance and or lower lean body mass.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s probably gonna be a negligible difference</p>
<p>compared to their resistance training</p>
<p>and also their caloric restriction or caloric maintenance.</p>
<p>And of course, there are also effects of having children.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, on all these parameters, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a major lifestyle shift, right?</p>
<p>That obviously people contend with</p>
<p>and have for since the beginning of human time anyway.</p>
<p>I wanna ask some questions about male hormone therapy</p>
<p>and male hormones generally.</p>
<p>But before I do that,</p>
<p>I have a couple of burning questions that I get very often</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m just gonna insert now.</p>
<p>Marijuana.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that it can decrease testosterone</p>
<p>in men and women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that it can increase testosterone.</p>
<p>Alcohol.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s general consensus that high alcohol intake,</p>
<p>high barbiturate intake does in fact reduce testosterone.</p>
<p>What about modest increase of alcohol?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a drinker,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not asking these questions for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t smoke pot and quite over.</p>
<p>I just never really liked marijuana or alcohol.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not my thing.</p>
<p>But many people want to know the answers</p>
<p>to these and the data that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>are very confused and conflicting.</p>
<p>So what about marijuana?</p>
<p>Does it reduce testosterone to a significant degree or not?</p>
<p>Cannabinoids itself, whether it&rsquo;s THC or CBD,</p>
<p>are not going to reduce testosterone by themselves.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s smoked marijuana,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s very likely to increase your aromatase,</p>
<p>which increases your estrogen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s aromatizing from testosterone.</p>
<p>So that is going to decrease testosterone.</p>
<p>When you have an increased estrogen, like estradiol,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna work on your pituitary</p>
<p>to make less hormones that cause the release of testosterone.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna have less LH and less FSH.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost kind of like opiates</p>
<p>are well known to opiate agonists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to decrease LH and FSH</p>
<p>and subsequently testosterone.</p>
<p>Smoked marijuana will as well.</p>
<p>As far as alcohol, high alcohol will decrease testosterone</p>
<p>as will any very potent GABA agonist,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a barbiturate or a benzodiazepine</p>
<p>or a non-benzo or alcohol.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re definitely going to.</p>
<p>Moderate alcohol, I guess it depends</p>
<p>on what your definition of that is.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m thinking like some people I know</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t seem to be alcoholics,</p>
<p>at least by my assessment,</p>
<p>will have a glass or two of wine four nights a week,</p>
<p>which to me seems like a tremendous amount</p>
<p>only because I don&rsquo;t like alcohol.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with other people liking alcohol,</p>
<p>but I think for many people,</p>
<p>that would be considered low or moderate intake.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would consider that low intake.</p>
<p>The American Heart Association for men recommends</p>
<p>between one and two drinks a day on average.</p>
<p>They recommend it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so around one per week.</p>
<p>Wait, so I&rsquo;m making my heart less healthy</p>
<p>by not drinking alcohol?</p>
<p>Yeah, they recommend a very low amount</p>
<p>of alcohol intake for men.</p>
<p>For women, they recommend zero to one.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of hard to interpret, the zero to one.</p>
<p>But the protective effect of alcohol,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s a red wine with polyphenols in it,</p>
<p>outweighs the deleterious effect.</p>
<p>Interesting, because I&rsquo;ve seen some studies</p>
<p>that point to the idea that even low intake of alcohol</p>
<p>over a prolonged period of time</p>
<p>might actually decrease brain volume</p>
<p>or at least volume of particular brain areas.</p>
<p>But of course, we don&rsquo;t know the consequence</p>
<p>of decreasing the volume of a given brain area either.</p>
<p>I mean, one can imagine it&rsquo;s decreasing</p>
<p>the size of one&rsquo;s amygdala and making them less stressed,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s no evidence to support that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that I need a drink many, many times,</p>
<p>but I always reply that I don&rsquo;t need to drink anything</p>
<p>in order to speak my mind.</p>
<p>So again, individual differences.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>So it sounds like smoked marijuana</p>
<p>may in fact reduce testosterone</p>
<p>or at least increase the conversion</p>
<p>of testosterone to estrogen, correct?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And with alcohol and GABA agonist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to remember that it shouldn&rsquo;t be daily.</p>
<p>So one drink of alcohol a day</p>
<p>is actually very mildly immunosuppressive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s better to have two drinks of alcohol</p>
<p>one day of the week,</p>
<p>and then two more drinks of alcohol another day of the week,</p>
<p>and then no alcohol the rest of the time.</p>
<p>The same could be said even for supplements</p>
<p>that have GABA in them.</p>
<p>A lot of sleep supplements have gamma-aminobutyric acid,</p>
<p>which is GABA.</p>
<p>Yeah, I occasionally take, oh, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I occasionally take 100 to 200 milligrams of GABA</p>
<p>in order to enhance sleep,</p>
<p>but I do it maybe every third or four nights,</p>
<p>no more than three or four nights a week.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of sleep supplements</p>
<p>that should not be taken daily,</p>
<p>and GABA is one of them.</p>
<p>Another one of them is trazodone,</p>
<p>and melatonin is kind of arguable,</p>
<p>and it depends on the situation.</p>
<p>But in general, if you&rsquo;re taking a sleep supplement,</p>
<p>it should not be taken every night.</p>
<p>The sleep supplements that I understand are okay</p>
<p>to take every night or nearly every night</p>
<p>are things like magnesium, threonate, apigenin.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not true, correct me.</p>
<p>I certainly take them every night</p>
<p>unless I forget them back home when I&rsquo;m traveling.</p>
<p>Magnesium is one of the exceptions.</p>
<p>L-theanine is also another exception.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, then at least I haven&rsquo;t put anything into the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wrong in that category yet, and hopefully I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But if I do, I&rsquo;ll correct myself.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about testosterone in males.</p>
<p>You see these headlines all the times now</p>
<p>that testosterone levels are dropping,</p>
<p>sperm counts are dropping,</p>
<p>phenotypes of men are changing over time,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t quite follow the literature on that</p>
<p>because obviously those are hard-controlled experiments</p>
<p>to do because techniques change over time,</p>
<p>and sensitivity of techniques change over time.</p>
<p>But regardless, I&rsquo;m aware that a lot of people</p>
<p>are considering increasing their testosterone</p>
<p>by taking testosterone.</p>
<p>A few years ago, that was considered steroid use,</p>
<p>and it was really extreme kind of stance.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it seems like there&rsquo;s more discussion about it.</p>
<p>First off, I&rsquo;d like to know,</p>
<p>does testosterone supplementation,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m talking about prescription from a doctor,</p>
<p>does it make one more prone to prostate cancer?</p>
<p>That seems to always be the first question that comes out.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there is a huge amount of misinformation</p>
<p>about this too.</p>
<p>So testosterone is not going to cause a prostate cancer.</p>
<p>However, normal aging causes prostate cancer,</p>
<p>and testosterone will grow your prostate cancer.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a 80-year-old male and you have an autopsy,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s at least a 50% chance</p>
<p>that you have a prostate cancer.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re 90 or 100 years old,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s at least a 90% chance.</p>
<p>So for humans with a prostate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until you get a prostate cancer.</p>
<p>So that begs the question,</p>
<p>do you want to take something that&rsquo;s going to grow it</p>
<p>for sure once you have it?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an individual assessment,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important to follow things like PSAs as well.</p>
<p>So a PSA of four or less,</p>
<p>I mean, ideally you wouldn&rsquo;t be at four</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s kind of the upper threshold,</p>
<p>is the simplest readout of whether or not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s excessive prostate growth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s benign prostate hyperplasia</p>
<p>where the prostate is growing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s non-cancerous, correct?</p>
<p>And then of course there are the symptomologies,</p>
<p>like people have challenges with urination,</p>
<p>they have sexual difficulties, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always struck by the correlation that people draw</p>
<p>between testosterone and prostate health,</p>
<p>and the fact that, or I should say the claim</p>
<p>that testosterone makes prostate health worse,</p>
<p>because if you think about it,</p>
<p>young males have high testosterone often,</p>
<p>if not always, certainly often,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t see a lot of prostate overgrowth</p>
<p>and cancer in young males.</p>
<p>So something&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>How should we conceptualize this?</p>
<p>So if you have a PSA of 3.9,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a 25-year-old male versus a 75-year-old male,</p>
<p>and you have a PSA of 5.9,</p>
<p>the 3.9 PSA is significantly more concerning.</p>
<p>So think of your prostate as taking cumulative damage</p>
<p>from not only testosterone,</p>
<p>but also estrogen and also growth hormone.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why obese individuals</p>
<p>have higher incidences of prostate cancer as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t have those cell checkpoints</p>
<p>where your immune system takes a second and says,</p>
<p>all right, stop replicating as fast prostate cells.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s any atypical ones.</p>
<p>And then it finds those</p>
<p>and it prevents them from reproducing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why immunotherapy and cancer is so promising</p>
<p>is because they can target these certain things.</p>
<p>So the older male</p>
<p>is going to have that cumulative damage happen already.</p>
<p>And arguably, prostate cancer is a normal,</p>
<p>with aging, fast aging is abnormal.</p>
<p>Very slow aging is normal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fine line to walk between those two,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of things that can be done</p>
<p>to decrease the turnover, decrease the inflammation,</p>
<p>and decrease the congestion of the prostate over time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot more than just PSAs that can be done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s prostate MRIs and things like that,</p>
<p>that can look at the structure</p>
<p>and the function of the prostate.</p>
<p>So what should every male do</p>
<p>to maintain the health of their prostate?</p>
<p>And I realized that younger males</p>
<p>probably aren&rsquo;t thinking about it at all,</p>
<p>although it seems like nowadays,</p>
<p>I get these kind of what I call cryptic questions.</p>
<p>I think women are more comfortable</p>
<p>talking about their hormone and sexual health</p>
<p>because of menstrual cycles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used to fluctuations</p>
<p>that sort of give them the experience</p>
<p>of what it&rsquo;s like to have different levels</p>
<p>of progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I get these kind of cryptic questions</p>
<p>often in my direct messages</p>
<p>where what I think people are asking is,</p>
<p>is there something wrong with my prostate?</p>
<p>What should I do for my prostate?</p>
<p>These are often indirect questions</p>
<p>for other aspects of their life where they&rsquo;re suffering.</p>
<p>But, and I don&rsquo;t say that in jest,</p>
<p>I think more direct discussion would be great.</p>
<p>So what should all males do</p>
<p>to maintain prostate health throughout the lifespan?</p>
<p>Maintaining prostate health can be looked at similarly</p>
<p>how you can maintain a good, natural, optimal testosterone.</p>
<p>So you look for things that can hurt it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily look for one thing</p>
<p>that can improve it or boost it.</p>
<p>So for young males, those are prostatitis.</p>
<p>So it goes hand in hand with epididymitis.</p>
<p>So different infections of the prostate.</p>
<p>The younger the male is,</p>
<p>the more likely it is related to something</p>
<p>that could be sexually transmitted.</p>
<p>But another very common cause is what we call</p>
<p>gram negative and anaerobic bacteria.</p>
<p>The prostate is right by the end of the colon.</p>
<p>So if you have chronic constipation or if you have colitis,</p>
<p>or if you have, you know,</p>
<p>even just an E. coli overgrowth in the colon</p>
<p>is very likely to cause an infection</p>
<p>of the prostate as well.</p>
<p>What should males do to prevent that?</p>
<p>Have a diet that has good, healthy prebiotic fiber,</p>
<p>probiotics as well.</p>
<p>Make sure that they&rsquo;re having regular bowel movements,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have chronic constipation.</p>
<p>Have good sources of dietary fiber,</p>
<p>which is also known as soluble fiber,</p>
<p>and enough insoluble fiber.</p>
<p>Most people get enough insoluble or non-dietary fiber.</p>
<p>So that can help prevent the chance of diverticulitis,</p>
<p>which is another type of infection.</p>
<p>It can also decrease the chance of colitis</p>
<p>and decrease the chance of prostate infections as well.</p>
<p>Are there any foods and or supplements</p>
<p>that men should take or avoid?</p>
<p>What about, you hear about salt palmetto,</p>
<p>or supplements that support</p>
<p>or cause issues for the prostate?</p>
<p>Yeah, if there&rsquo;s a strong genetic predisposition</p>
<p>to enlarged prostates,</p>
<p>or even just really early prostate cancers that grow fast,</p>
<p>then they can consider taking salt palmetto,</p>
<p>or even curcumin as an antiandrogen,</p>
<p>as long as they&rsquo;re able to tolerate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an individualized basis and depends on their history.</p>
<p>As far as making sure that their prostate is not congested,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an interesting correlation</p>
<p>between having girls and having prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Having girls offspring.</p>
<p>So if your offspring are females,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re slightly more likely to have prostate cancer.</p>
<p>There is some, there&rsquo;s hypotheses that link estrogen</p>
<p>to prostate cancer rather than testosterone.</p>
<p>So if you have hyperestrogenism,</p>
<p>your prostate has more atypical cells.</p>
<p>In general, the higher your C-reactive protein,</p>
<p>which is the general marker of inflammation in your body,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d call it CRP,</p>
<p>and the test order is HSCRP or high sensitivity CRP.</p>
<p>If your CRP raises up very high,</p>
<p>if you have an autoimmune disease,</p>
<p>like if you have a Crohn&rsquo;s flare,</p>
<p>or if you have a lupus or an infection,</p>
<p>or a sexually transmitted infection,</p>
<p>or even colitis, or even the flu,</p>
<p>your CRP is gonna raise significantly.</p>
<p>That you would detect in a blood test, of course.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah.</p>
<p>So you wanna get a baseline CRP</p>
<p>when you haven&rsquo;t had any of those things recently.</p>
<p>And if your CRP is higher,</p>
<p>you also have more female offspring.</p>
<p>If your CRP is higher,</p>
<p>then your reactive oxygen species,</p>
<p>which are causing mutations and atypical cell turnover</p>
<p>in the prostate, are also likely higher.</p>
<p>So you wanna keep a very low CRP.</p>
<p>And what about blood flow and pelvic floor in general?</p>
<p>We should probably do a whole episode on pelvic floor.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s so much interesting data</p>
<p>coming out of the fields of clinical and research urology.</p>
<p>I realize it&rsquo;s kind of the Netherlands</p>
<p>of biology and medicine.</p>
<p>People probably aren&rsquo;t thinking so much about this,</p>
<p>but pelvic floor is obviously a confluence</p>
<p>of a ton of vasculature, of nerves,</p>
<p>and of course the prostate resides there,</p>
<p>and of course the genitals reside there as well.</p>
<p>So I would imagine that one of the six pillars,</p>
<p>you know, exercise, being able to maintain</p>
<p>adequate blood flow to those regions is key.</p>
<p>What about just postural things?</p>
<p>People sitting too much, not hydrating well enough.</p>
<p>You mentioned avoiding constipation.</p>
<p>What are some other things, including medications,</p>
<p>that can serve to support the prostate over time,</p>
<p>and maybe even support pelvic floor in general,</p>
<p>both in males and females over time?</p>
<p>Absolutely, and this is something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rightfully getting more and more attention.</p>
<p>The way I explain the pelvic floor</p>
<p>is your abdominal cavity,</p>
<p>which includes your peritoneum,</p>
<p>or where most of your organs are,</p>
<p>your retroperitoneum, your pelvic space.</p>
<p>Think of it as a box,</p>
<p>and your abs are the front of the box.</p>
<p>Your back muscles are the back.</p>
<p>Your diaphragm is the top of the box.</p>
<p>And your pelvic floor,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where your port is to the outside world.</p>
<p>Especially important, it has muscles as well,</p>
<p>and you can do exercises.</p>
<p>Pelvic floor physical therapists</p>
<p>are becoming more and more utilized,</p>
<p>especially after childbirth,</p>
<p>but in other situations as well,</p>
<p>including by men getting care from urologists.</p>
<p>So you want to both strengthen that pelvic floor,</p>
<p>and make sure that the tubes</p>
<p>that are docked to the outside world</p>
<p>are working well enough, but they&rsquo;re not too loose.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not working too well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of medications</p>
<p>that can be positives or negatives for your pelvic floor.</p>
<p>We kind of talked about your gut</p>
<p>and colon health in general.</p>
<p>As far as your prostate health,</p>
<p>and as far as your bladder and urinary system health,</p>
<p>you think about a couple of different classes.</p>
<p>So you have your phosphodiesterases.</p>
<p>You have your Tadalafil.</p>
<p>Basically, this is gonna help decrease congestion</p>
<p>in the prostate.</p>
<p>A lot of people take it for ED,</p>
<p>but it can actually help you decrease your-</p>
<p>Could you define that?</p>
<p>A lot of men take Tadalafil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generic is Cialis.</p>
<p>Has a much longer half-life than Viagra or Levitra.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s half-life is almost a day.</p>
<p>So you can take a very low dose of it.</p>
<p>Instead of taking 20 milligrams,</p>
<p>you take two or two and a half milligrams.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re taking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that a lot of men take it</p>
<p>for erectile dysfunction,</p>
<p>but that at lower doses,</p>
<p>it may have served purposes for prostate health,</p>
<p>independent of erection.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>The most common scenario is</p>
<p>if a male is waking up twice at night to pee,</p>
<p>on average, it&rsquo;ll cut that down to once.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re waking up at four times at night,</p>
<p>then it can cut that down to twice at night,</p>
<p>just because you have easier blood flow.</p>
<p>We used to use other medications like Flomax,</p>
<p>which is Tamsulosin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an alpha antagonist.</p>
<p>So it basically binds to a receptor in smooth muscle,</p>
<p>and it helps relax that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several other alpha antagonists.</p>
<p>And then you also have your medications</p>
<p>that are hormonal like finasteride</p>
<p>that a lot of people take for prostate health</p>
<p>to decrease the enlargement of the prostate,</p>
<p>the periurethral area or periurethral lobe.</p>
<p>There are several lobes of the prostate</p>
<p>that tends to be especially enlarged in cases of BPH.</p>
<p>And BPH?</p>
<p>Prostate hyperplasia or an enlarged prostate.</p>
<p>And if you are able to shrink that area,</p>
<p>then at that point, it&rsquo;s just a plumbing problem</p>
<p>and the urine is able to get by easier.</p>
<p>Yeah, my understanding is that now there&rsquo;s a growing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say a movement,</p>
<p>but the idea of taking very low dose,</p>
<p>like 2.5 milligram or five milligram Tadalafil even daily</p>
<p>is becoming pretty common for many men</p>
<p>who do not have erectile dysfunction</p>
<p>simply to either maintain or enhance prostate health.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Do you see any negative effects of doing that?</p>
<p>There can be negative effects.</p>
<p>It can lower blood pressure.</p>
<p>So theoretically, it can increase your chance</p>
<p>of vasovagal syncope.</p>
<p>A lot of people take it as an alternative to pump</p>
<p>because it kind of works similarly to citrulline</p>
<p>or a different pump products in pre-workout.</p>
<p>And it can certainly help with that.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re about to go do a deadlift</p>
<p>where you might pass out anyway,</p>
<p>it can certainly increase the chance that that happens</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that compensatory exercise hypertension response.</p>
<p>Could someone just take it away from exercise?</p>
<p>They could.</p>
<p>If you took Tadalafil,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s gonna be, has a long half-life.</p>
<p>Whereas Viagra and Levitra is just a few hours,</p>
<p>Tadalafil is almost a day.</p>
<p>Some interesting studies on Viagra have been done as well.</p>
<p>It can potentially alter your rays and cones in your eye.</p>
<p>So the usual recommendation for pilots</p>
<p>that need to have red-green discrimination</p>
<p>from very long distances with very small indicator lights</p>
<p>is to not take Viagra.</p>
<p>So I usually say, if you&rsquo;re a pilot and that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>profession, perhaps hold off from that for a while.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also studies with Viagra that significantly,</p>
<p>which is also known as Sildenafil as the generic now,</p>
<p>it can increase eyebrow hair growth.</p>
<p>So potentially what it does is it helps vasodilate</p>
<p>and relax the veins, especially in older men.</p>
<p>And when those veins are relaxed,</p>
<p>you have better blood flow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the proposals or theories</p>
<p>behind why older men get the androgenetic alopecia more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having less blood flow in the scalp.</p>
<p>So theoretically it can also help prevent that.</p>
<p>So in theory increasing blood,</p>
<p>oh, because it increases blood flow systemically</p>
<p>throughout the body, not just in specific tissues.</p>
<p>Well, I find it incredibly interesting that,</p>
<p>yeah, there are these online forums building up now</p>
<p>around low-dose Tadalafil,</p>
<p>daily use of low-dose Tadalafil,</p>
<p>again, not for sexual or erectile dysfunction,</p>
<p>but for sake of long-term prostate health.</p>
<p>Is there any reason why women might want</p>
<p>to take low-dose Tadalafil?</p>
<p>Tadalafil is also a weak androgen receptor sensitizer,</p>
<p>kind of like L-carnitine,</p>
<p>where the density of the available androgen receptors</p>
<p>to bind increases slightly.</p>
<p>So there could potentially be a benefit from that,</p>
<p>but most of the time it&rsquo;s used in men.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t really talked about testosterone</p>
<p>and optimizing testosterone in males.</p>
<p>Assuming someone is paying attention to the six pillars,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of a gap, as I see it,</p>
<p>between doing all those things</p>
<p>and TRT, hormone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>And again, the R, the replacement in TRT</p>
<p>is a little bit of a, in quotes nowadays,</p>
<p>because a lot of people who have testosterone</p>
<p>in that 300 to 900 nanogram per deciliter range</p>
<p>opt to take low-dose testosterone anyway.</p>
<p>My understanding is that there&rsquo;ve been some new</p>
<p>kind of movements in this area toward, for instance,</p>
<p>not doing big, large doses injected infrequently,</p>
<p>but rather low doses quite frequently.</p>
<p>Obviously prescribed by a doctor,</p>
<p>monitored by a doctor, et cetera.</p>
<p>Is that generally what you like to see in your patients</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re gonna take this route?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re a hypogonadal patient</p>
<p>whose benefits outweigh risks of TRT,</p>
<p>then you wanna have a nice, even, steady state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be exactly the same</p>
<p>as producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously</p>
<p>from your own body.</p>
<p>When you have a steady state,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a peak or a trough.</p>
<p>And when you have a peak,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the androgen receptor gene is overactive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you get more erythropoietin or EPO release.</p>
<p>And that leads to a lot of the side effects</p>
<p>of thick blood, so higher hemoglobins and hematocrits.</p>
<p>And then when you have a crash, you don&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s definitely not optimal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to get around this.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re doing testosterone replacement,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re someone that needs it,</p>
<p>you can have different types of esters</p>
<p>or you could do topical testosterone.</p>
<p>So the ester is basically something that&rsquo;s attached</p>
<p>to increase the biological half-life.</p>
<p>The most common ones are cipionate and anthate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a very short-acting propionate,</p>
<p>which has almost no clinical relevance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also very long-acting ones,</p>
<p>decanoate and undecanoate,</p>
<p>and different mixtures of all those.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re someone who has a very, very low SHBG,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have trouble</p>
<p>of regulating your serum testosterone in the long run.</p>
<p>If you do it topically, then the testosterone is absorbed,</p>
<p>hopefully bound to SHBG.</p>
<p>And then a lot of times you reapply twice daily</p>
<p>or once daily, but you have lots of variations.</p>
<p>So for most people,</p>
<p>especially for people who can&rsquo;t absorb it well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna be a great option.</p>
<p>So injections would be preferred?</p>
<p>Most people end up injecting</p>
<p>because they have either side effects from too high, too low,</p>
<p>or just too much of a varied dose when they do topical.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a capsule with a special lymphatic absorption.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not being absorbed through the liver.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hepatically metabolized,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s absorbed through the lymph.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s essentially the testosterone undecanoate</p>
<p>and then put into a capsule.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s taken twice daily.</p>
<p>It has fairly steady half-lives,</p>
<p>but you have to take it at specific times of the day.</p>
<p>So that being said,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s new enough to where there isn&rsquo;t a huge amount</p>
<p>of data on it, but it is FTA approved.</p>
<p>So it is brand name now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Jitenzo.</p>
<p>But the injectables in general, the lower your SHBG,</p>
<p>the longer of an ester you want,</p>
<p>because when you inject it,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s intramuscular or subcutaneous,</p>
<p>just talk to your doctor about the risks</p>
<p>and the benefits of those.</p>
<p>Subcutaneous has slightly longer active half-life</p>
<p>because the esterases take longer to reach that cipionate</p>
<p>or an anthe ester to cleave it.</p>
<p>So most men, a lot of people ask me</p>
<p>about like what a usual dose is.</p>
<p>For most people, it would be a total</p>
<p>of about 100 to 120 per week for an actual replacement dose.</p>
<p>Milligrams.</p>
<p>Milligrams, 120 to 100 milligrams per week,</p>
<p>administered two to three times per week.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not, so you&rsquo;re saying dividing that</p>
<p>into two or three, right?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a bunch of people out there</p>
<p>thinking, oh yeah, 100 three times a week,</p>
<p>which is actually quite, quite high dose.</p>
<p>Yeah, there really does seem to be a shift</p>
<p>toward spreading these dosages out into,</p>
<p>dividing them into two or three smaller doses.</p>
<p>And then along those lines, five, 10 years ago,</p>
<p>it was common to hear about inhibiting estrogen</p>
<p>through aromatase inhibitors.</p>
<p>Nowadays you hear, and I think it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>at least by my read of the literature,</p>
<p>that inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function,</p>
<p>can cause connective tissue issues,</p>
<p>and even can cause reductions in libido.</p>
<p>So a lot of people think that estrogen,</p>
<p>if you crash estrogen, that basically libido goes up,</p>
<p>but actually the opposite is often true.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want estrogen too high or too low.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>And for that reason, do you shy away</p>
<p>from people taking aromatase inhibitors?</p>
<p>Yeah, very few people truly need an aromatase inhibitor.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost always lifestyle interventions.</p>
<p>It can just depend on which gene,</p>
<p>how active your aromatase gene is.</p>
<p>Some people&rsquo;s aromatase gene is very active.</p>
<p>A lot of times these individuals</p>
<p>have pubertal gynecomastia,</p>
<p>which is breast tissue growth in males,</p>
<p>even despite no other risk factor.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re lean?</p>
<p>Some people get it if they&rsquo;re lean.</p>
<p>I remember growing up, there were a few kids</p>
<p>that got mild cases of gynecomastia that were transient.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s sort of like they developed gynecomastia</p>
<p>and then it went away.</p>
<p>Often it&rsquo;s unilateral on one side too.</p>
<p>So growth hormone a lot of times is the fuel to that fire.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, there were a couple of kids.</p>
<p>I mean, they took some teasing</p>
<p>because back then there wasn&rsquo;t online discussions</p>
<p>about hormones and things like that,</p>
<p>but then it would seem transient.</p>
<p>And the people I&rsquo;m thinking of</p>
<p>were actually lean individuals.</p>
<p>So they weren&rsquo;t overweight,</p>
<p>which of course can cause gynecomastia</p>
<p>because adipose fat tissue</p>
<p>can convert testosterone into estrogen.</p>
<p>So it sounds like, except in special cases,</p>
<p>that avoiding aromatase inhibitors</p>
<p>is probably going to be a good idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several other ways</p>
<p>that you can control your estrogen</p>
<p>and keep it at a healthy level,</p>
<p>which you do have to check.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of patients who assure me</p>
<p>that their estrogen is going to be sky high</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually very low and vice versa.</p>
<p>But calcium deglucrate is a supplement</p>
<p>that can help with estrogen control.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a typical dosage of calcium deglucrate?</p>
<p>500 to 1000 milligrams.</p>
<p>But is there the risk that if someone&rsquo;s estrogen</p>
<p>is in normal range and they take the supplement</p>
<p>that their estrogen will go too low, is it that potent?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that potent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not near as potent as an aromatase inhibitor.</p>
<p>So it helps with excretion</p>
<p>and also the sensitivity of the estrogen receptor itself.</p>
<p>It kind of like helps out-compete it.</p>
<p>Some people also take DIM</p>
<p>or different cruciferous vegetable.</p>
<p>They get them from cruciferous vegetables like kale</p>
<p>or broccoli.</p>
<p>And that is both an anti-estrogen and an anti-androgen.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on TRT and you&rsquo;re on that,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re probably just on too much TRT.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember a few years ago, I had a friend</p>
<p>and it truly is, it&rsquo;s not like I have a friend thing</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m very cautious about which supplements I take.</p>
<p>I think people might get the impression</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m very cavalier about this, but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I always alter one thing at a time.</p>
<p>I talk to physicians, what I suggest other people do,</p>
<p>I actually do and have done for a long period of time.</p>
<p>And I recall wanting to take DIM</p>
<p>because I thought, well, back then you hear,</p>
<p>okay, reduce estrogen.</p>
<p>My estrogen levels weren&rsquo;t out of range, so they were fine.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, what would the experience</p>
<p>be of bringing those down?</p>
<p>But someone I know is quite informed in this area said,</p>
<p>yeah, exactly what you said,</p>
<p>which is that DIM can reduce estrogen, but also testosterone.</p>
<p>So I just never opted to try and take it.</p>
<p>I do want, we&rsquo;re sort of erring in this direction,</p>
<p>but we went straight from the six pillars to TRT</p>
<p>or to what some people now call sports TRT,</p>
<p>which is basically code language for saying,</p>
<p>taking exogenous testosterone,</p>
<p>even though one doesn&rsquo;t need it</p>
<p>to get into a semi-supra-physiological range</p>
<p>or a high-end, like 900 to 1,000 nanogram</p>
<p>per deciliter range.</p>
<p>And people always point out, I should mention that,</p>
<p>oh, well, in certain countries,</p>
<p>the high-end range is 1,200 nanograms per deciliter.</p>
<p>In the U.S. it&rsquo;s 900.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re 1,200, are you really supra-physiological?</p>
<p>All that aside, I neglected to ask about that gap in between</p>
<p>where individuals could think about supplementation,</p>
<p>meaning non-prescription approaches</p>
<p>to increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>And here we should probably also talk about things like,</p>
<p>is it true that ice baths increase testosterone or not?</p>
<p>Lifestyle factors that go beyond the six pillars</p>
<p>for increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>If you could comment on those, that would be terrific.</p>
<p>Supplements that are useful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;d be wonderful if you could mention</p>
<p>where some of these same practices and supplements</p>
<p>might be useful for women as well as men</p>
<p>to increase testosterone</p>
<p>for all the reasons we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is where a true individualized approach comes in.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking about what dose of TRT you should be on,</p>
<p>one thing to keep in mind is the law of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Quality of life is a subjective thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s different for each person.</p>
<p>So some people are more willing to give up</p>
<p>a little bit of athleticism or body composition.</p>
<p>Some people are more willing to give up</p>
<p>or not willing to give up libido or sexual health.</p>
<p>And as we mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s androgen receptor is less or more sensitive.</p>
<p>So you can make a case that if somebody&rsquo;s androgen receptor</p>
<p>is half as sensitive as somebody else,</p>
<p>the person with the less sensitive receptor</p>
<p>does need a level of 1,000 or 1,200.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no great way to know that.</p>
<p>And you can alter the sensitivity of your androgen receptor</p>
<p>with things like L-carnitine and Tadalafil, as mentioned.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll definitely come back to L-carnitine</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m really intrigued by the data on L-carnitine,</p>
<p>both for women and men in terms of egg quality,</p>
<p>sperm quality, fertility,</p>
<p>and a bunch of other interesting effects.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll come back to L-carnitine.</p>
<p>But a lot of how you feel, the biofeedback or subjective,</p>
<p>I feel like this comes from the ratio</p>
<p>of your androgens to your estrogens.</p>
<p>And a lot of that is lifestyle.</p>
<p>So if someone&rsquo;s also on HCG,</p>
<p>that could up-regulate aromatase as well.</p>
<p>HCG, you might want to just,</p>
<p>human chorionic gonadotropin used to be found in pregnant,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still found in pregnant women&rsquo;s urine.</p>
<p>But it used to be, believe it or not,</p>
<p>there was a black market for pregnant women&rsquo;s urine</p>
<p>before this stuff was developed synthetically.</p>
<p>So in other words, what we&rsquo;re saying is,</p>
<p>men typically would buy pregnant women&rsquo;s urine</p>
<p>through black markets in order to get the HCG,</p>
<p>in order to get the testosterone-enhancing effects of HCG.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>men were using pregnant women&rsquo;s urine for HCG.</p>
<p>I do not want to know how they got it into their body.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just skip to what you were going to say next</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s HCG.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of other things that up-regulate estrogen.</p>
<p>Alcohol significantly increases aromatase.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re very sensitive to estrogen,</p>
<p>then you probably shouldn&rsquo;t even consume the two glasses</p>
<p>three times a week.</p>
<p>High-fat meals also up-regulate aromatase.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>but you have hyperestrogenism,</p>
<p>then you should take care with that as well.</p>
<p>All kinds of fats or just saturated fats?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s just saturated fats,</p>
<p>but fat definitely increases.</p>
<p>Both fat in your body and consumption</p>
<p>of a high amount of calories increases aromatase.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the ratio of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to break your flow,</p>
<p>but since we&rsquo;re talking about fat,</p>
<p>I have to ask since estrogen and testosterone</p>
<p>are both synthesized from the cholesterol molecule,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that ingesting some amount of saturated fat</p>
<p>can be useful because of the way that cholesterol</p>
<p>can serve as a precursor to these molecules.</p>
<p>Now, I once said on a podcast that I like butter so much</p>
<p>I occasionally eat pats of butter.</p>
<p>Somehow that got misinterpreted to mean that I eat</p>
<p>entire many pats of butter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying like one or two pats of butter here and there,</p>
<p>and I have no guilt or shame about it.</p>
<p>My blood lipids are in great shape also, so I feel good.</p>
<p>But is it possible that people who are ingesting</p>
<p>too little of saturated fats could directly or indirectly</p>
<p>reduce or somehow disrupt the proper ratio</p>
<p>of testosterone to estrogen in men and women?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s theoretically possible, but it probably doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>in developed countries, just like it&rsquo;s theoretically</p>
<p>possible to have not enough omega-6 fatty acids,</p>
<p>but that probably does not happen in developed countries.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t need the butter pats,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to do it anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Grass-fed butter has good omega-3 content as well.</p>
<p>So grass-fed foods in general, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the end all be all,</p>
<p>and everybody doesn&rsquo;t need grass-fed foods,</p>
<p>but they are one of the only sources of healthy trans fat.</p>
<p>So a naturally occurring trans fat comes from ruminants.</p>
<p>So ruminants, I think of like cows,</p>
<p>and the rumination in the different stomachs</p>
<p>can change your omega-3 and omega-6 to trans linoleic</p>
<p>and trans linoleic fatty acids.</p>
<p>Which are healthy for us.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s actually omega-3s and omega-6s</p>
<p>that just happened to have a trans instead of a cis isomer.</p>
<p>So, and these healthy trans fats would be found</p>
<p>in ruminant cheese and milk and butter from ruminants</p>
<p>and the meats?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, and for people who are following</p>
<p>a purely plant-based diet or mostly plant-based diet,</p>
<p>are they at risk of not getting enough</p>
<p>of certain types of fats or other nutrients</p>
<p>to maintain that healthy ratio</p>
<p>of testosterone to estrogen or not?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re a vegetarian,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably not at risk.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re a vegan, they very well could be at risk.</p>
<p>Most vegans are aware of this very acutely</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll supplement with, you know, algae</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll supplement with other sources of healthy fats.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So the takeaway that I&rsquo;m drawing from this</p>
<p>is that less so than getting saturated fat,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s key to get these healthy trans fats from ruminants</p>
<p>or the food products of those ruminants,</p>
<p>as well as to get proper amounts of omega-3s.</p>
<p>And to be clear, you don&rsquo;t need any trans fats.</p>
<p>It just happens that those omega-3s and omega-6s</p>
<p>are in a trans isomer.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s nutrition.</p>
<p>What other supplements can support healthy testosterone</p>
<p>to estrogen ratios?</p>
<p>Anything that alters aromatase</p>
<p>can support healthy testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>And your testosterone to estrogen ratio,</p>
<p>think about it as how much estrogen activity</p>
<p>do you have at the beta-estradiol receptor</p>
<p>and your alpha-estradiol receptor.</p>
<p>How would I know that?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to tell, but depending on what you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>if you have a lot of plant-based diets or polyphenols,</p>
<p>many of these are beta-estradiol receptors.</p>
<p>People know about terkesterone and also beta-ectosterone,</p>
<p>which are two ectosteroids</p>
<p>that are beta-estradiol receptor agonists.</p>
<p>So they activate the beta-estradiol receptor.</p>
<p>So if you have a very low amount of estrogen naturally,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably a better candidate for it.</p>
<p>For taking terkesterone or ectosterone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried them,</p>
<p>but I know my understanding</p>
<p>is that they work tremendously well for some people</p>
<p>and not at all for others.</p>
<p>And so one just simply has to try.</p>
<p>But in promoting the activity of this estrogen receptor,</p>
<p>is there a risk that terkesterone or ectosterone</p>
<p>could cause some of the quote-unquote problems</p>
<p>associated with increasing estrogen activity,</p>
<p>like reduced libido, water retention?</p>
<p>Water retention, yes.</p>
<p>Reduced libido, probably not.</p>
<p>Closing growth plates in the bone, no,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the alpha-estradiol receptor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before on a couple of podcasts</p>
<p>about tongkat ali, which is this Indonesian herb.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s also made and found in Malaysia,</p>
<p>but it seems to be the Indonesian variety of tongkat ali</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most effective for,</p>
<p>potentially for reducing sex hormone in binding globulin</p>
<p>and thereby freeing up testosterone.</p>
<p>Whether or not the effects are through that pathway,</p>
<p>through another pathway,</p>
<p>a lot of people report improvements in things like libido</p>
<p>and maybe androgen-like phenotypes, right?</p>
<p>Feeling more vital, et cetera.</p>
<p>And of course, some of that could be placebo, correct?</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts on tongkat ali?</p>
<p>And please challenge my statements about tongkat ali</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re incorrect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking for validation here.</p>
<p>I just really wanna know what your thoughts are on it.</p>
<p>Do you ever recommend it to patients?</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>Men, women, one or the other?</p>
<p>Yeah, so tongkat ali, or longjack,</p>
<p>it has multiple mechanisms of action,</p>
<p>and there have been several</p>
<p>placebo-controlled studies on it.</p>
<p>Some of them show decrease in SHBG.</p>
<p>At least one of them did not show any change in SHBG.</p>
<p>However it is, it does act on aromatase very weakly,</p>
<p>probably not so strongly</p>
<p>that you would have to be concerned of hypoestrogenism.</p>
<p>So it reduces aromatase and thereby can reduce estrogen.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a weak, it&rsquo;s not a CIRM,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not a selective estrogen receptor modifier,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably a weak, it&rsquo;s probably an ERM as well,</p>
<p>or a non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.</p>
<p>And that should help</p>
<p>with decreasing negative feedback inhibition of estradiol</p>
<p>in various locations and also increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, the dosage that I&rsquo;ve been using for years now is,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 400 milligrams taken once a day,</p>
<p>typically early in the day</p>
<p>because it can kind of have a mild stimulant effect,</p>
<p>very mild.</p>
<p>And I know that some of the products out there</p>
<p>recommend dosages that are much higher.</p>
<p>Anytime I&rsquo;ve taken more than 400, I don&rsquo;t feel very good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it other than</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a little overly stimulatory</p>
<p>in terms of it makes me kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like drinking too much coffee.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And so would women ever want to take Tonga Ali</p>
<p>for any reason?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of women that have hypoestrogenism</p>
<p>and unlike adrenal fatigue or andropause,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually ICD-10 codes for hypoestrogenism.</p>
<p>ICD-10 codes?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s doctor speak, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s codes to where your doctor</p>
<p>can actually diagnose you with something.</p>
<p>So if you go to your doctor and you say,</p>
<p>I have adrenal fatigue, they can&rsquo;t diagnose you with that.</p>
<p>Or if you say, I have andropause,</p>
<p>they also can&rsquo;t diagnose you with that.</p>
<p>But if you say you have hypoestrogenism,</p>
<p>the most common complaint that comes with it is endometriosis</p>
<p>which is overgrowth of the lining of the uterus.</p>
<p>And those people could potentially,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one area where we might see</p>
<p>Tongkat supplementation more and more</p>
<p>because not only does it decrease aromatase,</p>
<p>like we mentioned, testosterone in females</p>
<p>is higher than estrogen in females.</p>
<p>So a lot of females get estrogen</p>
<p>from aromatization as well.</p>
<p>Peripheral estrogen is sometimes what we call it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not directly produced in the ovaries,</p>
<p>but they could be good candidates for Tongkat</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>My understanding is that people should be looking</p>
<p>for sources of Indonesian Tongkat, in particular.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Another interesting application is essentially a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll call it a PCT, but essentially what that means is,</p>
<p>PCT means, I&rsquo;ll define it as post-cycle therapy.</p>
<p>Physicians love acronyms, scientists love acronyms,</p>
<p>military love acronyms, but yeah, PCT, post-cycle therapy.</p>
<p>So this would be people coming off</p>
<p>hormone therapy or steroids.</p>
<p>This would actually be for women</p>
<p>that are coming off of their birth control pill</p>
<p>because perhaps it can help lower that SHBG</p>
<p>back to normal, which is sometimes persistently elevated.</p>
<p>And then it can help prevent</p>
<p>the subsequent hyperestrogenism that happens.</p>
<p>Does Tongkat Ali need to be cycled?</p>
<p>When I first started taking it, I would cycle it.</p>
<p>I would do a few, three, four months,</p>
<p>and I would take some time off.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve just been taking it continuously for years.</p>
<p>And I should say, I do blood work</p>
<p>to check my liver enzymes and everything else.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see any reason for me to cease taking it.</p>
<p>Yeah, probably not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been human studies on both Tongkat and Fidoja.</p>
<p>And full disclosure, I did help design</p>
<p>Derek&rsquo;s new testosterone optimization supplement,</p>
<p>which has both Fidoja Erestris and also Tongkat Ali in it.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s talk about Fidoja separately in a moment.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say someone is only taking Tongkat Ali</p>
<p>for whatever reason, do they need to cycle off?</p>
<p>Likely not, but I would just to be safe</p>
<p>because it does both affect your aromatase</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an estrogen receptor modifier.</p>
<p>And what would be a reasonable cycle off?</p>
<p>So how long to take and how long to stop</p>
<p>before taking again?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a couple different protocols that you can do,</p>
<p>but 11 months on, one month off for Tongkat</p>
<p>is pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>Now, I guess this is, we&rsquo;ll talk about this later too,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s combined with Fidoja,</p>
<p>the protocol that I would do is three weeks on,</p>
<p>one week off.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Tongkat Ali, but I&rsquo;m curious what your thoughts</p>
<p>are on Fidoja Erestris, this Nigerian shrub</p>
<p>or this extract from Nigerian shrubs</p>
<p>that at least in my experience,</p>
<p>in my read of the literature has the potential</p>
<p>to increase testosterone and probably other hormones as well</p>
<p>by way of increasing luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>something that we haven&rsquo;t really talked about</p>
<p>much up until now.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Fidoja Erestris?</p>
<p>What are your ideas about the proposed mechanism</p>
<p>or mechanisms and where might this be useful</p>
<p>for people on or off hormone replacement therapy?</p>
<p>Yeah, Fidoja Erestris has just reached a point</p>
<p>where we have enough evidence to we know it probably helps</p>
<p>both with luteinizing hormone release,</p>
<p>which stimulates latex cells in the testes</p>
<p>to produce more testosterone,</p>
<p>and probably with LH receptor sensitivity as well,</p>
<p>which is a good combination of the two.</p>
<p>It does come from the Nigerian shrub,</p>
<p>but there is not quite enough evidence</p>
<p>for me to be able to say it&rsquo;s safe for somebody</p>
<p>to take this all the time, which again, full disclosure,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I recommended that we recommended</p>
<p>for people to cycle this supplement.</p>
<p>So three weeks on, one week off, that&rsquo;s likely safe.</p>
<p>The only toxicity studies in general are in rats</p>
<p>and in humans, it looks quite safe.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the toxicity studies in rats</p>
<p>showed toxicity to the testicular cells.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s certainly concerning,</p>
<p>but that the dosages that were used</p>
<p>or translating the dosages used to humans</p>
<p>would lead to a situation where the dosages</p>
<p>that humans would have to take would be very, very large.</p>
<p>So the amount of, I no longer take Fidoja,</p>
<p>but I took it at 600 milligrams per day for a long time.</p>
<p>And I ceased taking it because I was experimenting</p>
<p>with other things and I didn&rsquo;t want to confound those things,</p>
<p>not because I had any negative side effects.</p>
<p>In fact, I was monitoring blood work</p>
<p>and other biological parameters that would have told me</p>
<p>if there was testicular toxicity and there wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s extremely safe.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just not convinced</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s enough overwhelming evidence</p>
<p>for a long-term consistent administration.</p>
<p>So do you recommend this to people who are not taking TRT</p>
<p>and do you recommend to men and women?</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you have a really high LH,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s probably a gonadal issue,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s heat damage to the testes, a varicocele,</p>
<p>a history of testicular cancer,</p>
<p>where your LH is going to be higher.</p>
<p>So if your LH is already very high,</p>
<p>increasing it even more is probably not going to help.</p>
<p>However, if your LH is low,</p>
<p>then obviously try to find out, is it low?</p>
<p>Is it deficient or is it just a little bit low?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s low and you don&rsquo;t have an issue with prolactin,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have an issue with opioid receptor antagonism,</p>
<p>then naltrexone can actually potentially help antagonize</p>
<p>that to increase LH as well,</p>
<p>especially in people recovering from opiates</p>
<p>or likely even alcohol.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking for a subclinical secondary hypogonadism,</p>
<p>which is essentially, just think of that as low LH.</p>
<p>So in people with that lower LH and their estrogen is fine</p>
<p>and their prolactin is fine,</p>
<p>then Fidogia is a particularly good option.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So three weeks on, one week off for 600 milligrams Fidogia,</p>
<p>400 milligrams Tonga Ali, Indonesian Tonga Ali,</p>
<p>could potentially be good.</p>
<p>And of course, everyone should always check</p>
<p>with their physician, clear this, do blood work, et cetera.</p>
<p>I always say, we don&rsquo;t just say that to protect us,</p>
<p>we say that to protect you,</p>
<p>meaning that the consumer is very, very important.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna get,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna fly blind with any of this stuff.</p>
<p>You want to do blood work, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the catch 22 with supplements</p>
<p>is most of them are safer than medications,</p>
<p>but the only difference between them and a medication</p>
<p>is one&rsquo;s prescribed and one&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And oftentimes with supplements,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear whether or not what&rsquo;s listed on the bottle</p>
<p>is actually what&rsquo;s in the bottle.</p>
<p>But I think there are a number of reputable brands now.</p>
<p>The other supplement I wanna talk about</p>
<p>in terms of testosterone augmentation is Boron.</p>
<p>What is Boron thought to do?</p>
<p>Does it actually do that?</p>
<p>And do you ever recommend Boron?</p>
<p>Yeah, so Boron is actually an element</p>
<p>and you can find it on the periodic table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more plentiful in rich soils.</p>
<p>So frequent farming can deplete the soils of Boron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very plentiful in the Mediterranean area,</p>
<p>like Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>So a lot of people will just eat dates</p>
<p>or raisins that are grown there.</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna tell me people eat dirt,</p>
<p>but there are people who eat dirt.</p>
<p>There are people who eat dirt.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a phenomenon called pica, right?</p>
<p>Where people in a, and that&rsquo;s not a good thing.</p>
<p>They-</p>
<p>Often a sign of iron deficiency.</p>
<p>Okay, but they&rsquo;re eating grapes and dates</p>
<p>that were grown in soil that has high amounts of Boron.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so Boron can help regulate SHBG,</p>
<p>but its effect is mostly acute.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s unlikely to have a bad effect.</p>
<p>So a lot of people take Boron</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s probably not gonna hurt</p>
<p>and it will lower SHBG,</p>
<p>even if it is for a short period of time.</p>
<p>So I guess you can make a case</p>
<p>that maybe cycling Boron can help too.</p>
<p>What sorts of dosages are useful for Boron supplementation?</p>
<p>Three to six milligrams once to twice a day.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s higher than the amounts that I&rsquo;ve been taking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been doing this cocktail of Tonga Ali.</p>
<p>Again, I stopped taking Fidogia,</p>
<p>but for a long time with Fidogia and Boron,</p>
<p>I think it was two to four milligrams per day,</p>
<p>but maybe that could afford to go higher.</p>
<p>Although my blood work is where I want it, thankfully.</p>
<p>So circling back to Fidogia,</p>
<p>Fidogia was attractive to me as a supplement</p>
<p>because I saw increases in LH,</p>
<p>testosterone and free testosterone.</p>
<p>My estrogen stayed in check,</p>
<p>but I also did not see a down regulation of LH</p>
<p>when I would cycle off.</p>
<p>Whereas with HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin,</p>
<p>which does now arrive in forms</p>
<p>not from pregnant women&rsquo;s urine only,</p>
<p>but the synthetic forms that people inject,</p>
<p>that as I understand it can actually suppress</p>
<p>endogenous hormone output</p>
<p>if one takes it for a long period of time.</p>
<p>So why would a man or woman want to take HCG</p>
<p>and what are the potential risks and benefits of taking HCG?</p>
<p>Yeah, so HCG or human chorionic gonadotropin</p>
<p>is actually very similar to TSH.</p>
<p>Thyroid stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So when a woman is pregnant,</p>
<p>she produces more HCG, especially in the first trimester.</p>
<p>When you take a pregnancy test,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s qualitative or quantitative,</p>
<p>you see the HCG rise</p>
<p>and it actually doubles every 48 hours.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re five weeks pregnant, you can get an HCG level.</p>
<p>And then two days later, five weeks and two days,</p>
<p>you can see your HCG</p>
<p>and maybe it went from 500 to 1,000.</p>
<p>So it precipitously increases.</p>
<p>It does a few things.</p>
<p>One thing is it prevents hypothyroidism</p>
<p>or hypothyroxemia of pregnancy,</p>
<p>which is one of the most common causes of miscarriage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why if you have hypothyroidism</p>
<p>and you get pregnant in the first trimester,</p>
<p>you wanna increase your dose from 25 to 40%</p>
<p>to keep your free T4 high as much as possible.</p>
<p>And the reason why you have to do that,</p>
<p>as opposed to somebody who does not have hypothyroidism,</p>
<p>is if you have hypothyroidism,</p>
<p>then likely your thyroid will not respond</p>
<p>to either TSH or HCG.</p>
<p>So the increased HCG does not compensate for that.</p>
<p>So if you take HCG,</p>
<p>then it can potentially improve your thyroid function.</p>
<p>So that, along with selenium,</p>
<p>are likely the two best things</p>
<p>that you can do for thyroid health.</p>
<p>HCG and selenium?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I definitely make sure I get enough selenium</p>
<p>by eating three to five Brazil nuts per day,</p>
<p>which I very much enjoy the taste of also.</p>
<p>Who should take HCG?</p>
<p>And can HCG suppress</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s normal luteinizing hormone output?</p>
<p>Yeah, it suppresses LH in a dose-dependent manner.</p>
<p>So the higher the dose of HCG you take,</p>
<p>the more it suppresses LH.</p>
<p>A common dose for fertility,</p>
<p>fertility is usually why HCG is prescribed.</p>
<p>In men or women?</p>
<p>In both.</p>
<p>Is 10,000 IUs all at one time, which is quite a bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tremendous dose.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In fact, some formulations,</p>
<p>some brand names of HCG come in auto-injector pins</p>
<p>to where you cannot even dose</p>
<p>lower than 5,000 units at a time.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>But I know a number of people who take HCG</p>
<p>to maintain testicular function</p>
<p>while on testosterone therapy or augmentation of some sort.</p>
<p>Does it work to do that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Some people are on HCG monotherapy.</p>
<p>It can be slightly better on your lipids</p>
<p>than being on TRT.</p>
<p>Oh, so people are using HCG alone</p>
<p>as a kind of neither,</p>
<p>sort of a hormone augment, indirect hormone augmentation.</p>
<p>Some clinics advertise it</p>
<p>as a non-suppressive alternative to TRT,</p>
<p>but it is suppressive of LH.</p>
<p>But it could also increase estrogen pretty potently.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And is it true that increasing LH and or HCG</p>
<p>can improve sensitivity of the genitals?</p>
<p>And is that true for men and women?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this anecdotally.</p>
<p>People say HCG makes sexual activity</p>
<p>more pleasurable for people because of some,</p>
<p>is it a direct effect on some of the nerve cells</p>
<p>in the genitals?</p>
<p>Yeah, so LH is also an agonist in the prostate</p>
<p>and in genital tissue in general.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very common treatment</p>
<p>for post-finasteride syndrome or post-5-alpha reductase.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve blocked the conversion of DHT for a long time,</p>
<p>it helps re-upregulate DHT.</p>
<p>So someone who&rsquo;s been taking finasteride</p>
<p>to prevent hair loss comes off,</p>
<p>maybe because they felt lousy,</p>
<p>but then feels even lousier</p>
<p>for reasons you talked about earlier.</p>
<p>And then they might use HCG as a transition treatment</p>
<p>to transition back to normal hormone health.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely helpful in many cases.</p>
<p>Now, when you come off the HCG,</p>
<p>then you need to have a strategy of how to return</p>
<p>to your normal as fast as possible as well.</p>
<p>But it will upregulate those 5-alpha reductase enzymes</p>
<p>you have in your genital skin,</p>
<p>both scrotal skin and penile skin,</p>
<p>and perineum in general.</p>
<p>You have, I believe it&rsquo;s called stratum lucidum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a skin layer that is very, very thin,</p>
<p>but it has the highest concentration of 5-alpha reductase.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of activity.</p>
<p>And after you&rsquo;ve been on something that inhibits</p>
<p>the enzyme, the 5-AR enzyme in those tissues,</p>
<p>then you do something else to upregulate those enzymes.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s waiting and taking time,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s trying Tadalafil,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s trying creatine even,</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s trying HCG,</p>
<p>a lot of times those are the go-tos</p>
<p>for post-venastaride syndrome.</p>
<p>Any risks for women taking HCG</p>
<p>on their ability to get pregnant or risk generally?</p>
<p>Yeah, obviously it&rsquo;ll make any pregnancy test positive.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a risk that some women don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So one could, in theory, fake a pregnancy test</p>
<p>by injecting HCG.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I have no motivation to do that.</p>
<p>I was just curious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about prolactin?</p>
<p>The simple version of this that I was taught,</p>
<p>because I was taught mainly</p>
<p>from the neuroendocrine perspective,</p>
<p>was dopamine is a kind of close cousin of testosterone,</p>
<p>and also estrogen, for that matter,</p>
<p>drives appetitive behaviors,</p>
<p>including pursuit of sexual partners, sex itself,</p>
<p>motivated behaviors generally,</p>
<p>then post-copulatory, post-orgasmic states</p>
<p>are accompanied by a prolactin increase.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the refractory period for mating in males,</p>
<p>and maybe even in females as well,</p>
<p>involved in milk letdown, et cetera.</p>
<p>What are sort of the general contours of syndromes</p>
<p>or things that people could be on the lookout for</p>
<p>of having too much prolactin or too little prolactin?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m aware of a number of people</p>
<p>who take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, capergolin,</p>
<p>things like that to really boost their dopamine levels,</p>
<p>and that isn&rsquo;t always a good thing, as it turns out.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, people will become kind of hyper-dopaminergic,</p>
<p>and so they have the drive to do all these appetitive things,</p>
<p>you know, fill in the blanks,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t always have the ability</p>
<p>because it seems just as testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>need to be in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>dopamine and prolactin need to be in the appropriate ratios.</p>
<p>So how should we think about</p>
<p>and perhaps act on our prolactin systems?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>The way I describe it is the dopamine wave pool.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re increasing your dopamine too much,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna overflow,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re gonna have that wave crash too much.</p>
<p>So you wanna have nice, even waves</p>
<p>that are not going too far above the pool of dopamine,</p>
<p>and prolactin will follow.</p>
<p>So prolactin and estrogen are quite close cousins.</p>
<p>Estrogen upregulates a gene called the PRL gene</p>
<p>or prolactin gene</p>
<p>that directly increases prolactin synthesis.</p>
<p>So prolactin is going to also inhibit</p>
<p>the release of testosterone from the pituitary.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re using a dopamine agonist,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to help decrease</p>
<p>the prolactin-producing cells,</p>
<p>including if you have a prolactin-producing microadenoma</p>
<p>in the pituitary.</p>
<p>How common are those?</p>
<p>Because, I mean, I hear a lot about these,</p>
<p>you know, hypogonadism or,</p>
<p>and of course that can be due to an issue at the testicles,</p>
<p>or hypogonadism could also be, of course,</p>
<p>in like ovarian syndromes.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, of course, the brain side of it,</p>
<p>where the signals aren&rsquo;t coming from the brain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not enough gonadotropin,</p>
<p>not enough luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>And there are ways of teasing this apart</p>
<p>with an endocrinologist that are quite elegant, in fact,</p>
<p>right, using stimulating hormones.</p>
<p>Too much to dive into here.</p>
<p>But how often does one actually have</p>
<p>one of these pituitary tumors?</p>
<p>I have heard that people that play</p>
<p>a lot of high-contact sports,</p>
<p>so boxing, football,</p>
<p>people that headed the soccer ball quite a lot.</p>
<p>Sadly, people whose jobs forced them to take head blows</p>
<p>for, you know, it could be military.</p>
<p>And so they were firing, you know, 50 caliber guns</p>
<p>and the kind of woodpeckering of the brain</p>
<p>inside of the skull.</p>
<p>And construction workers,</p>
<p>or just a concussion can cause the pituitary</p>
<p>to go malfunctional.</p>
<p>Is that really common,</p>
<p>or is this something that, you know,</p>
<p>is a rare, like 1%?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s extremely common.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another one of those conditions</p>
<p>where a lot of people never know they have it.</p>
<p>They just feel a little bit more fatigued.</p>
<p>They have that high prolactin feeling all the time.</p>
<p>Pituitary micro-adenomas can be non-producing as well.</p>
<p>So your prolactin can be totally normal.</p>
<p>Your growth hormone and IGF-1 can be totally normal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the second most common producing micro-adenomas,</p>
<p>growth hormone causing either acromegaly,</p>
<p>which is growth of cartilage or gigantism.</p>
<p>This is the big brow, yeah.</p>
<p>So those are fairly common causes of adenomas,</p>
<p>but a lot of people that have a very small adenoma,</p>
<p>you know, much less than one centimeter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to see on imaging,</p>
<p>even if you have a contrast</p>
<p>that specifically looks at the pituitary,</p>
<p>and many people aren&rsquo;t symptomatic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of those things along with PCOS and prediabetes</p>
<p>that are much more frequent when it comes to prevalence,</p>
<p>which is the amount,</p>
<p>the percentage of people</p>
<p>that have it in the general population.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned the dopamine wave pool.</p>
<p>I know nowadays there&rsquo;s a lot of interest</p>
<p>in augmenting dopamine.</p>
<p>I know a number of people that do this</p>
<p>through prescription drugs, Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil,</p>
<p>and those drugs, of course, hit many transmitter systems,</p>
<p>but dopamine is certainly involved.</p>
<p>People taking antidepressants like Welbutrin</p>
<p>tap into that system.</p>
<p>And of course, people are trying to inhibit prolactin</p>
<p>and promote serotonin or reduce serotonin.</p>
<p>To me, it all seems like a very delicate dance, right?</p>
<p>I mean, to just imagine the arousal arc</p>
<p>for mating behavior, for sexual reproduction,</p>
<p>is such an elaborate dance between sympathetic drive</p>
<p>and parasympathetic drive,</p>
<p>even across the span of minutes, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve talked about this before on the podcast</p>
<p>that the arousal is kind of more parasympathetic.</p>
<p>Orgasm itself is a sympathetic response,</p>
<p>a completely different set of neurons.</p>
<p>And so where do you see people getting into trouble</p>
<p>just trying to hit the gas pedal on dopamine?</p>
<p>And where do you think there is a place for people</p>
<p>who perhaps are experiencing low drive and motivation,</p>
<p>not just sexual, but in general,</p>
<p>to increase the amount of dopamine circulating</p>
<p>in their brain and body?</p>
<p>How do you think about that, given this wave pool analogy?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s important to parse it out</p>
<p>and start with the least powerful interventions.</p>
<p>So if someone&rsquo;s concerned about dopamine,</p>
<p>or maybe they have a slightly higher prolactin,</p>
<p>then they eliminate things</p>
<p>that could be increasing that prolactin,</p>
<p>such as casein or gluten,</p>
<p>which are mu-opioid receptor agonists,</p>
<p>or any mu-opioid receptor agonist in the gut.</p>
<p>So casein, so milk protein?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Can increase prolactin?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>In addition to that, they should,</p>
<p>if they need a pituitary MRI,</p>
<p>then they should get a pituitary MRI.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t have an adenoma,</p>
<p>or if they don&rsquo;t have a high enough prolactin level</p>
<p>to where they need an MRI,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re having visual symptoms,</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re having olfactory symptoms with the nose,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s more likely that they do.</p>
<p>But if they don&rsquo;t, a lot of times,</p>
<p>a prolactin under about 40 is not too big of a deal.</p>
<p>They can take dopamine agonists</p>
<p>that agonize that D2 receptor, like P5P,</p>
<p>which is essentially vitamin B6.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pyridoxine 5-pyrophosphate,</p>
<p>and pyridoxine is vitamin B6.</p>
<p>So that can help, 50 milligrams once to twice a day.</p>
<p>Vitamin E can also help,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s mixed to coferols.</p>
<p>A lot of people have the high levels of vitamin E,</p>
<p>but low levels of the gamma form of vitamin E.</p>
<p>So that can also help.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad you mentioned vitamin B6 and P5P.</p>
<p>I have heard that one can shorten the refractory period</p>
<p>after orgasm, essentially to be able to have sex again,</p>
<p>to be quite direct about it,</p>
<p>by way of vitamin B6 blunting of the prolactin response,</p>
<p>which turns out to be quite potent.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also heard that vitamin B6 can be neurotoxic,</p>
<p>especially in the periphery,</p>
<p>that it can cause peripheral neuropathies</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s taken at high doses,</p>
<p>but that P5P is the safer form.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pre-activated, so it does not build up.</p>
<p>Think of it as a allegory to how folate can build up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not methylfolate, but it builds up</p>
<p>and it can increase levels of homocysteine,</p>
<p>or if you have too much vitamin B12,</p>
<p>another water-soluble B vitamin,</p>
<p>you can have too much methylmalonic acid, or MMA.</p>
<p>So depending on what your enzymatic conversion is</p>
<p>to the active form of the enzyme,</p>
<p>often it&rsquo;s just safer to take the active form of the enzyme.</p>
<p>Yeah, very interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, well, at risk of going down every hormonal pathway</p>
<p>and talking about supplementation lifestyle factors,</p>
<p>I think touching on, as we have,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen and now prolactin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to chat a little bit about L-carnitine.</p>
<p>We talked about this earlier,</p>
<p>but I want to raise this discussion about L-carnitine,</p>
<p>not in the context of L-carnitine itself,</p>
<p>but in the context of fertility.</p>
<p>Because my read of the literature is that L-carnitine</p>
<p>can be very beneficial for enhancing sperm quality</p>
<p>and egg quality, and even rates of conception.</p>
<p>What forms does L-carnitine come in</p>
<p>that people can reasonably consider?</p>
<p>Again, talk to your doctor, folks.</p>
<p>What is it doing, and do we know how it&rsquo;s doing it,</p>
<p>and do you often use this in your patients?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the way I think about L-carnitine,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll try to tie this in with creatine</p>
<p>and other things as well,</p>
<p>is if your cell is an energy factory or a car,</p>
<p>then L-carnitine is the shuttle that helps get the fuel</p>
<p>into the motor to use the motor.</p>
<p>The motor is mostly due to lifestyle factors,</p>
<p>so like your diet and your exercise.</p>
<p>And the type of fuel itself is NAD+.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to get into NAD precursors</p>
<p>or NMN or NR or anything.</p>
<p>And then the accessory fuel tank is your creatine phosphate.</p>
<p>So creatine is your accessory fuel tank.</p>
<p>Your NAD status, which is largely determined</p>
<p>by your REM sleep and quality sleep and exercise,</p>
<p>along with supplementation, is the fuel.</p>
<p>The carnitine shuttle is carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A,</p>
<p>and that takes medium-chain fatty acids.</p>
<p>It takes different molecules of fat.</p>
<p>You have two main energy sources other than ketones.</p>
<p>You have your glucose or carbs.</p>
<p>You have your fat or fatty acids.</p>
<p>And that takes it across the layer of the mitochondria</p>
<p>so that it can be utilized.</p>
<p>So it upregulates that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why things that have flagella in general,</p>
<p>the flagella are gonna work better, like sperm.</p>
<p>Flagella being anything,</p>
<p>sort of the wavy little tendrils on cell types,</p>
<p>of which they&rsquo;re everywhere, right, in the gut too, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So those are gonna work significantly better.</p>
<p>And in general, your mitochondria are gonna work better.</p>
<p>So the worse your mitochondria are off the bat,</p>
<p>the better they&rsquo;re going to be helped</p>
<p>by the shuttle that shuttles them across.</p>
<p>It also slightly increases the density</p>
<p>of the androgen receptor as well.</p>
<p>Is that a local effect?</p>
<p>So if L-carnitine is injected into a particular muscle,</p>
<p>will it increase the density of androgen receptors</p>
<p>in that muscle?</p>
<p>Likely so.</p>
<p>So how are people taking L-carnitine?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re capsule forms and they&rsquo;re injectable forms.</p>
<p>Most people are gonna be taking the capsule forms</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;re gonna have access to.</p>
<p>And then we should also ask,</p>
<p>can you get L-carnitine from food?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So L-carnitine is just a combination of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a very small peptide.</p>
<p>So glutathione is just three amino acids.</p>
<p>L-carnitine is the smallest peptide, two.</p>
<p>So peptide is just a protein that has amino acids</p>
<p>between two and about 200.</p>
<p>And L-carnitine is just two amino acids.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a micro peptide.</p>
<p>Yeah, so your body synthesizes enough.</p>
<p>It likes to absorb the amino acids by themselves.</p>
<p>And then if it puts them together,</p>
<p>there it makes L-carnitine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very bioavailable if you take it.</p>
<p>A lot of people will take L-carnitine L-tartrate</p>
<p>or acyl L-carnitine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about 10% bioavailable.</p>
<p>So if you want one gram or a thousand milligrams</p>
<p>of L-carnitine, you can take 10 grams of oral L-carnitine.</p>
<p>Is the one gram the typical dose you recommend,</p>
<p>one gram per day?</p>
<p>For fertility and androgen receptor upregulation.</p>
<p>So that means taking 10 grams of the capsule form.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s about 15 to 20 capsules, which is a lot.</p>
<p>That is a lot.</p>
<p>It can also potentially increase TMAO.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wanted to ask about that because TMAO</p>
<p>on your blood chart, when that&rsquo;s elevated,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to cause some concern.</p>
<p>You taught me a trick, however,</p>
<p>that one can take 600 milligrams of garlic capsule</p>
<p>for the allicin, is that what it&rsquo;s called?</p>
<p>Allicin is in it, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the name allicin, but with two L&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>And that had a remarkable effect in reducing TMAO.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s quite potent.</p>
<p>And also, was it just coincidence</p>
<p>that it really brought my LDL down as well?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the LDL is a coincidence,</p>
<p>but depending on your gut microbiome or your microbiota,</p>
<p>some microbiome beneficial bacteria</p>
<p>will convert carnitine and also choline.</p>
<p>So any choline precursor like alpha-GPC</p>
<p>or phosphatidylserine,</p>
<p>it will convert them more or less to TMAO.</p>
<p>So TMAO is something that you can get measured</p>
<p>in a blood test and see if it&rsquo;s high or low.</p>
<p>Some people might not even need allicin.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Some people do benefit from it.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Although, I think it was you that also told me</p>
<p>that allicin and garlic can have positive effects</p>
<p>on cardiovascular tone and blood flow generally.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe, so is 600 milligrams garlic</p>
<p>an excessive amount, or can I just eat garlic?</p>
<p>You can just eat-</p>
<p>I mean, I like eating garlic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, okay, so one could also just eat garlic.</p>
<p>If one were gonna take L-carnitine in injectable form,</p>
<p>how much of that is bioavailable?</p>
<p>100%, if you inject it.</p>
<p>It is in an aqueous solution.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bacteriostatic water, essentially.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not in a carrier oil.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna burn a lot if you inject it subcutaneously.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be absorbed faster and more evenly,</p>
<p>and also just hurt a lot less</p>
<p>if you inject it into a muscle.</p>
<p>But one could then just take one gram per day injected,</p>
<p>or divide it up into a couple doses.</p>
<p>Yeah, or 500.</p>
<p>The minimally efficacious dose for injectables,</p>
<p>probably around 200 when it comes to sperm motility</p>
<p>and androgen receptor upregulation.</p>
<p>So it really depends on why you&rsquo;re taking it.</p>
<p>In terms of fertility and in terms of blood tests generally,</p>
<p>I always say that if possible,</p>
<p>either by way of insurance</p>
<p>or by way of some other way affording it,</p>
<p>it would be great for people to have blood tests</p>
<p>to know what their hormone levels</p>
<p>and other levels of other things</p>
<p>like metabolic markers and lipids were in their 20s,</p>
<p>also in their 30s, also in their 40s.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s this idea that you only take a blood test</p>
<p>when you have a problem.</p>
<p>But then of course, one can&rsquo;t actually do the comparison</p>
<p>that you mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>or state the comparison to one&rsquo;s physician,</p>
<p>that things are changing over time.</p>
<p>And it seems to me that basically everyone should get</p>
<p>at least a once a year blood test.</p>
<p>Is there the hope that insurance</p>
<p>will someday just cover it for everybody?</p>
<p>This will be standard care.</p>
<p>I would think that everybody should know</p>
<p>what sorts of things are floating around</p>
<p>in their bloodstream and what they need more of</p>
<p>and less of in life.</p>
<p>I doubt it will ever be covered by insurance.</p>
<p>In many cases, you could make an argument</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s indicated.</p>
<p>As insurance begins to cover more of the population</p>
<p>for pathologies, the things like FSAs or HSAs</p>
<p>or care credit will likely cover this advanced testing,</p>
<p>which it continues to come down and down in price.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be affordable, but it won&rsquo;t be free.</p>
<p>Got it. Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to shift gears slightly and talk</p>
<p>about social interactions and relational effects</p>
<p>on hormones, something that I just find fascinating.</p>
<p>We touched on this a little bit earlier</p>
<p>with in terms of oral contraception,</p>
<p>but now that we have the backdrop</p>
<p>of what these various hormones do,</p>
<p>some involvement in neurotransmitter systems</p>
<p>like dopamine and prolactin and associated pathways,</p>
<p>prolactin, of course, being a hormone,</p>
<p>not a neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a phenomenon in human beings</p>
<p>where people get very excited about a new partner.</p>
<p>And that excitement, no doubt,</p>
<p>is related to the dopamine system among other systems.</p>
<p>And that excitement can be maintained</p>
<p>or it can wane over time.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m talking about attraction,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also talking about just general excitement</p>
<p>in the sense of novelty,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what dopamine&rsquo;s associated with.</p>
<p>Given that you work with human beings</p>
<p>and they have lives and relationships and lifestyles,</p>
<p>and they have hormones and all these things interact,</p>
<p>what are some of the ways that we could think</p>
<p>about adjusting our relationships</p>
<p>in order to optimize hormones,</p>
<p>as opposed to just thinking about how to optimize hormones</p>
<p>for sake of our relationship?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s bi-directional, of course.</p>
<p>And this assumes, I should say,</p>
<p>that one is already paying attention</p>
<p>to the six pillars talked about earlier,</p>
<p>that people are doing most things right.</p>
<p>How should we think about relationships and hormones?</p>
<p>Friendships, romantic relationships,</p>
<p>new partners, long-term partners?</p>
<p>How do you think about this kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you have a new partner,</p>
<p>then it is largely regulated by the dopaminergic system,</p>
<p>which changes over time.</p>
<p>So people may have heard the saying</p>
<p>that you have to go through a full calendar year</p>
<p>with someone that you&rsquo;re in a relationship,</p>
<p>so that you- Very good advice,</p>
<p>by the way. So that you really know</p>
<p>what to do and what not to do,</p>
<p>but because you experience both of your families</p>
<p>and the holidays and all the different situations.</p>
<p>But I would argue until you have moved in together,</p>
<p>had a baby, and then raised that baby,</p>
<p>preferably breastfeeding,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when you get the prolactin spikes,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t really gone through every stage in life yet.</p>
<p>Now, you can&rsquo;t really do that</p>
<p>with every person that you&rsquo;re considering.</p>
<p>Well, some people do, but it can be quite costly</p>
<p>in terms of time and finances and emotionally costly.</p>
<p>And then here, I&rsquo;m definitely not referring</p>
<p>to any personal experience</p>
<p>of having done all that many times over.</p>
<p>But what would you suggest people do or think about</p>
<p>as they enter a relationship</p>
<p>or for people that are in long-term relationships</p>
<p>where they feel like something has shifted?</p>
<p>And indeed, those shifts may reflect the output</p>
<p>of different hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems.</p>
<p>It almost certainly has to be the case, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so just like women who spend a lot of time together,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re coworkers or whatever,</p>
<p>a lot of times their menstrual cycles will align.</p>
<p>There is a lot of pheromonal and hormonal crosstalk,</p>
<p>including prolactin between men and women.</p>
<p>So spending 100% of the time together,</p>
<p>this is why people think it&rsquo;s so hard to work together</p>
<p>and live together, they&rsquo;re around each other 24-7.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the reprieve</p>
<p>where you let that dopamine settle down</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re excited when you see them again.</p>
<p>A lot of guys know that if they&rsquo;ve gone on a hunting trip</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;ve gone on a trip for a long time,</p>
<p>they come back and they see their partner</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a new, not quite like a new relationship,</p>
<p>but almost like a new relationship.</p>
<p>And then they have that excitement again.</p>
<p>And purposely building that into every relationship</p>
<p>can help significantly,</p>
<p>especially if you choose to have a child or get pregnant</p>
<p>or be breastfeeding, because you just plan ahead</p>
<p>for both of your prolactins to be high</p>
<p>and both of your dopamines to be low</p>
<p>and both of your testosterone&rsquo;s to be low.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of planning that you can do.</p>
<p>Essentially, every relationship goes through a crisis.</p>
<p>And that crisis is personal between the two of you</p>
<p>and you can plan ahead and figure out a way.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not supplementation.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not even the amount of time</p>
<p>you spend away from each other,</p>
<p>but plan ahead to have good times</p>
<p>if you know you&rsquo;re about to go into a crisis.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And so it sounds like time apart and time together,</p>
<p>which is actually built into a number of cultures</p>
<p>where men and women will purposefully avoid each other</p>
<p>for some period of time, avoid physical touch</p>
<p>and maybe in proximity, and then we&rsquo;ll reconvene.</p>
<p>And yet those are very stable relationships over time often.</p>
<p>Is the inverse also true?</p>
<p>For instance, for people that are</p>
<p>in long-distance relationships</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re only seeing each other</p>
<p>three or four days a week or two days a week,</p>
<p>does this explain the fact that some of those relationships</p>
<p>can go on for a very long period of time</p>
<p>without ever actually entering the,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it the hyper-prolactin phase</p>
<p>of actually moving in together and et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Like in other words, is that a way in which people</p>
<p>are spiking and troughing dopamine that keeps them attached?</p>
<p>This kind of elusive, this sort of, what is it called?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called like a cat string.</p>
<p>Like if you play with a cat and you move the string away,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll keep reaching,</p>
<p>but you throw the string on the ground</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re totally uninterested in it.</p>
<p>Is that what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s a dopaminergic phenomenon,</p>
<p>the cat string example.</p>
<p>We know this experimentally.</p>
<p>In those cases, the relationship hasn&rsquo;t really progressed,</p>
<p>in many of those cases, past the dopamine spike,</p>
<p>the fun initial stage, honeymoon stage,</p>
<p>whatever you wanna call it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost kind of like a roommate.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a roommate,</p>
<p>if it was for college or after college or whatever,</p>
<p>you can fill out forms and look for common interests,</p>
<p>but until you&rsquo;re actually together</p>
<p>a significant proportion of the time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really gonna know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna be compatible or not.</p>
<p>And is there evidence</p>
<p>that the appearance of an infant changes?</p>
<p>Obviously, there are gonna be hormonal shifts.</p>
<p>We know actually that in both women and in men,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a prolactin increase</p>
<p>when couples are expecting a child.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a brooding phenomenon.</p>
<p>You see this in birds where it&rsquo;s actually called brooding</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s caused by prolactin increase,</p>
<p>but it turns out this also occurs in humans.</p>
<p>And some people would argue</p>
<p>this causes the dad bod phenomenon</p>
<p>because it actually,</p>
<p>prolactin&rsquo;s involved in laying down a body fat,</p>
<p>preparing for sleepless nights.</p>
<p>And presumably that spike in prolactin</p>
<p>is there also to suppress sexual activity</p>
<p>because there are periods of time immediately</p>
<p>near childbirth where sexual activity is not advantageous.</p>
<p>Yeah, you see a prolactin spike right after breastfeeding.</p>
<p>So if you think about it,</p>
<p>often when you have an infant,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll breastfeed, put the infant to bed,</p>
<p>and then immediately go to bed with your partner,</p>
<p>which is not particularly conducive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like trying to have intercourse back to back.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>Because of the, in the prolactin sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, low dopamine, high prolactin.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is also increased significantly</p>
<p>to help with milk let down as well.</p>
<p>So yeah, as far as brooding,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely a human equivalent of brooding.</p>
<p>Some humans call it nesting instinct,</p>
<p>which is both helpful,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad change in relationship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a change.</p>
<p>And as long as you know that it&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do better with it.</p>
<p>Just like any medication.</p>
<p>If you are aware of the side effect</p>
<p>and that it might happen,</p>
<p>then when it happens, it&rsquo;s not only less severe,</p>
<p>it also happens less often.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>You tell the patient.</p>
<p>Well, as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>I come from the framework that,</p>
<p>of course, hormones impact perception and behavior,</p>
<p>but perception and behavior also impact hormones.</p>
<p>I find this fascinating.</p>
<p>I also really like the example you gave</p>
<p>of people taking time apart,</p>
<p>but also these affiliative bonds</p>
<p>that are non-romantic bonds</p>
<p>can serve as kind of a reservoir to replenish dopamine</p>
<p>that is then released upon experience,</p>
<p>going back to one&rsquo;s partner</p>
<p>or some sort of regular feature of home.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>And of course, this should exist on both sides.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that from both the male side and female side,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an interest in kind of separation</p>
<p>and reunion as the theme.</p>
<p>And I guess the frequency will vary</p>
<p>for different couples in different situations.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna make it seem like prolactin is all bad.</p>
<p>So prolactin does help with the nesting instinct.</p>
<p>It helps with breastfeeding as well.</p>
<p>A lot of women are diagnosed with luteal phase defects,</p>
<p>which is basically the phase after ovulation,</p>
<p>but before a period or giving birth.</p>
<p>The pregnancy is kind of a prolonged luteal phase.</p>
<p>And a lot of them will go on progesterone for this.</p>
<p>Progesterone can also decrease prolactin.</p>
<p>And prolactin is also helpful</p>
<p>for the maturity of lungs in infants.</p>
<p>So it helps the sphingomyelin to lecithin ratio.</p>
<p>So it can decrease.</p>
<p>If your prolactin is too low through pregnancy,</p>
<p>it spikes up very high during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Then it can lead to increased risk</p>
<p>of respiratory distress of the newborn.</p>
<p>Really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we certainly don&rsquo;t wanna paint a picture</p>
<p>where prolactin is the bad, bad hormone to avoid.</p>
<p>Without prolactin, none of us would be here, of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so vital.</p>
<p>I realized that earlier I raised the question</p>
<p>about whether or not cold exposure</p>
<p>could modify hormone output,</p>
<p>in particular, whether or not ice baths</p>
<p>or ice applied to specific tissues of the body,</p>
<p>as people are doing one way or the other,</p>
<p>can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels.</p>
<p>In other words, taking ice baths and cold showers</p>
<p>can increase testosterone and or estrogen.</p>
<p>Yeah, so taking an ice bath or a cold shower</p>
<p>or a cold exposure in general,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna correct a vitamin D deficiency</p>
<p>or a metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of things that it will not correct</p>
<p>that are causes of hypogonadism or low testosterone,</p>
<p>but it will help acutely, specifically,</p>
<p>the application of cold to testes that are too warm.</p>
<p>So if you have a varicocele</p>
<p>or if you have a little bit of a primary hypogonadism,</p>
<p>which is where testosterone is not released by the testes,</p>
<p>but your LH and FSH signals are sufficiently high,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll likely respond to cold exposure better.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually undergarments</p>
<p>that are designed specifically to help with fertility.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably gonna be more and more of that</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>You just need to be careful not to get frostbite</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a particularly bad spot to get frostbite.</p>
<p>Noted.</p>
<p>Could you define varicocele?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned it a few times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a varicose vein?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s essentially a varicose vein.</p>
<p>It brings warm blood and the venous flow</p>
<p>or the flow back to the heart is not as good.</p>
<p>Just like in the legs, it can happen in the scrotum.</p>
<p>Usually about 20 to 25% of people</p>
<p>have one grade of varicocele.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s grades one through four, one through five.</p>
<p>And most people just have a very mild one,</p>
<p>usually on the left side,</p>
<p>because the blood has to go through further</p>
<p>to get back to the heart.</p>
<p>And it raises the temperature of the testes.</p>
<p>Temperature is the enemy of testes.</p>
<p>So they like to be five to 10 degrees cooler</p>
<p>than the rest of the body.</p>
<p>So are saunas particularly bad for sperm production?</p>
<p>They can be, yeah.</p>
<p>When you say can be,</p>
<p>how long could one safely be in the sauna?</p>
<p>Or would you want to go back and forth</p>
<p>between the cold and sauna?</p>
<p>Is there any, are there any data?</p>
<p>If someone is having infertility,</p>
<p>then I tell them to avoid all saunas empirically.</p>
<p>If someone has, if they&rsquo;re not infertile,</p>
<p>but they have a low sperm count,</p>
<p>I also tell them to avoid.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s mostly warmed water</p>
<p>that can raise the temperature of the testes</p>
<p>faster than the sauna.</p>
<p>So hot tubs and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a hot tub and a jacuzzi,</p>
<p>those are enemies, number one and number two, of sperm.</p>
<p>What about ice baths and cold showers for women?</p>
<p>Any evidence that it can shift hormone output in women?</p>
<p>Yeah, it can.</p>
<p>It increases the activity of the beta-adrenergic receptors,</p>
<p>even in the central nervous system</p>
<p>and the astrocytes as well.</p>
<p>So it can do a few things.</p>
<p>It can slightly decrease the drive for food,</p>
<p>which astrocytes and beta-adrenergic receptors</p>
<p>have some medications that are weight loss medicines</p>
<p>that also do similar things.</p>
<p>But it can be beneficial in women, too.</p>
<p>But no evidence that it changes estrogen output in women,</p>
<p>correct?</p>
<p>Not that I know of.</p>
<p>Me either.</p>
<p>Peptides, a lot of discussion these days about peptides.</p>
<p>Peptides, of course, just being strings of amino acids,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, very small ones,</p>
<p>like two amino acids, like L-carnitine,</p>
<p>all the way up to polypeptides,</p>
<p>which just mean many, many amino acids.</p>
<p>There are so many peptides that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we should probably just do an entire episode about peptides.</p>
<p>But I think one of the reasons I&rsquo;m hearing so much</p>
<p>about peptides these days is that</p>
<p>they are not called steroids.</p>
<p>You know, the name steroids, I think,</p>
<p>has come to be associated with anabolic steroids</p>
<p>in the context of acne, testosterone rage, et cetera.</p>
<p>But of course, testosterone, excuse me,</p>
<p>estrogen is a steroid hormone, right?</p>
<p>There are other steroid hormones, as we both know.</p>
<p>But peptides are gaining increasing popularity.</p>
<p>I am willing to go on record saying that you can be sure</p>
<p>that many of the incredible transformations</p>
<p>that you see in Hollywood are the consequence</p>
<p>of peptide use.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d put my name behind that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m well aware of people</p>
<p>that use these to prepare for roles,</p>
<p>but athletes use them.</p>
<p>And then everyday people are using them too.</p>
<p>For instance, sermoralin, tesamoralin, ipamoralin</p>
<p>to stimulate the release of growth hormone</p>
<p>rather than taking growth hormone.</p>
<p>BPC-157, which is essentially a synthetic gastric juice</p>
<p>that normally repairs the gut,</p>
<p>is being used to treat injuries.</p>
<p>And there are other ones as well.</p>
<p>What can we say generally about peptides?</p>
<p>Are they safe?</p>
<p>Are they not safe?</p>
<p>What about sourcing?</p>
<p>And are there any peptides that you think</p>
<p>could be of particular use for people?</p>
<p>And we should probably also touch on peptides</p>
<p>that people shouldn&rsquo;t go anywhere near with a 10-foot pole.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>So peptides are very heterogeneous.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very dangerous ones and very safe ones.</p>
<p>My favorite peptide is the original peptide,</p>
<p>which is insulin.</p>
<p>So insulin is a peptide.</p>
<p>And less than 100 years ago,</p>
<p>there was a scientist studying insulin.</p>
<p>And at some point, they saw that an animal</p>
<p>had its diabetes cured by insulin injection.</p>
<p>Less than a year later,</p>
<p>they were injecting insulin into every type one diabetic</p>
<p>because it was saving their lives.</p>
<p>And yet insulin can kill you</p>
<p>if you take it at the incorrect dose, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so just like insulin should be prescribed by a doctor,</p>
<p>there is over-the-counter insulin, rely on or NPH.</p>
<p>But ideally, your insulin is prescribed by your doctor</p>
<p>for your diabetes as it&rsquo;s life-saving.</p>
<p>Peptides should be prescribed by doctors as well.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s several that are FDA approved.</p>
<p>So you mentioned a lot of different ones.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with tesamoralin.</p>
<p>So tesamoralin was recently FDA approved</p>
<p>for something called lipodystrophy.</p>
<p>It happens where body fat is displaced into abnormal areas,</p>
<p>often as part of AIDS or severe burns, things like that.</p>
<p>And it helps redistribute this body fat</p>
<p>and give people their quality of life back.</p>
<p>Tesamoralin is a GHRH,</p>
<p>which I kind of loop into the category of GHRPs,</p>
<p>so growth hormone releasing peptides.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only a couple amino acids different</p>
<p>from endogenously produced growth hormone releasing hormone.</p>
<p>So growth hormone itself is also a peptide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a peptide hormone, not a steroid hormone.</p>
<p>So you have different somatotrophs,</p>
<p>which are very similar to growth hormone.</p>
<p>Another fun fact is that HPL,</p>
<p>which is human placental lactogen,</p>
<p>we love acronyms, right?</p>
<p>Human placental lactogen is nearly identical</p>
<p>to growth hormone.</p>
<p>The growth hormone in pregnancy</p>
<p>is not what causes the sugar spike and gestational diabetes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the human placental lactogen.</p>
<p>So if you look at twin pregnancies,</p>
<p>if they have two placentas or more placental tissue,</p>
<p>making more human placental lactogen,</p>
<p>the risk of gestational diabetes is exponentially higher.</p>
<p>So this HPL is only a couple molecules</p>
<p>different from growth hormone.</p>
<p>It is interesting that these different GHRHs and GHRPs</p>
<p>actually have pretty different mechanisms of action.</p>
<p>Ghrelin is also a hormone that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>
<p>This is probably one of the reasons</p>
<p>why you have more growth hormone release overnight.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of peptides</p>
<p>that are very similar to ghrelin.</p>
<p>So these peptides are not bio-identical peptides,</p>
<p>but they just have a couple different amino acids change.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re almost identical</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re probably gonna be used in the future</p>
<p>for growth hormone deficiencies,</p>
<p>including in kids they&rsquo;ve been studied.</p>
<p>So if somebody wants to increase their growth hormone output</p>
<p>in addition to not eating within two hours of sleep,</p>
<p>getting good deep sleep,</p>
<p>doing all the other things in the six pillars</p>
<p>that you mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>especially resistance exercise</p>
<p>at some point earlier in the day,</p>
<p>what are the risks and benefits</p>
<p>of taking a growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide</p>
<p>like cermoralin prescribed by a doctor, of course?</p>
<p>What should one be concerned about?</p>
<p>How long could one take these?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve even heard that they can modify gene expression</p>
<p>so that they really are changing your hypothalamus</p>
<p>in very long lasting ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s definitely a lot of risk,</p>
<p>tumor growth and cancer.</p>
<p>So you look at a type one diabetic,</p>
<p>they have very high incidencies of various types of cancer.</p>
<p>They have very high growth hormone,</p>
<p>but low IGF-1 paradoxically.</p>
<p>So they would likely give you a similar cancer risk</p>
<p>to a type one diabetic that has very high growth hormone.</p>
<p>However, there are the benefits of it.</p>
<p>You think of lipolysis, decreased body fat,</p>
<p>increased lean body mass.</p>
<p>A lot of those, you can use other things</p>
<p>to get those benefits.</p>
<p>So then you don&rsquo;t need growth hormone for those benefits.</p>
<p>It just leaves cosmetic benefit</p>
<p>to which you can usually use topicals</p>
<p>to get your hair and your skin and your nails.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of other things</p>
<p>that you can do other than growth hormone.</p>
<p>So a lot of people just don&rsquo;t need these GHRPs</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t have lipodystrophy</p>
<p>or if they don&rsquo;t have growth hormone deficiency.</p>
<p>There is other uses of them specifically in injuries.</p>
<p>So I know that they&rsquo;ve been studied.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s in the military.</p>
<p>We mentioned the woodpecker or the coup,</p>
<p>contrecoup injury.</p>
<p>So that can obviously-</p>
<p>Head resulting back and forth</p>
<p>and the brain basically slamming up</p>
<p>against the front of the skull.</p>
<p>Yeah, football, heading the ball in soccer.</p>
<p>Definitely people who use the 50 caliber</p>
<p>in military, although that&rsquo;s a fairly small population.</p>
<p>And I think anyone that&rsquo;s hit their head hard</p>
<p>more than once.</p>
<p>Yeah, we can talk about BPC-157 for a bit,</p>
<p>GHK copper peptide for a bit,</p>
<p>TB-500 or a thymosin beta-4 analog.</p>
<p>And then we can also talk about brin-melanotide,</p>
<p>which is melanotan-3.</p>
<p>They have melanotan-1 and 2,</p>
<p>and then they also have melanotan-3 and 4.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about BPC-157 and melanotan,</p>
<p>because I think those are the ones</p>
<p>that most people are eyeing, so to speak.</p>
<p>So BPC-157 is body protective compound.</p>
<p>157, it&rsquo;s identical or bio-identical</p>
<p>to gastric protective compound, 157,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s produced in the stomach.</p>
<p>So as you age, you get atrophic gastritis very often.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have less intrinsic factor,</p>
<p>which is kind of another peptide that binds to vitamin B12.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you can get age-related B12 deficiencies.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one reason why you have more colitis,</p>
<p>more diverticulitis as you age.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have that gastric protective compound.</p>
<p>It increases VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor,</p>
<p>which basically makes your blood vessels grow more.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what causes your body to form a blood vessel.</p>
<p>So another medication known as Avastin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the WHO&rsquo;s list of essential medications for cancer.</p>
<p>So many different types of cancer, including colon cancer,</p>
<p>you treat it with Avastin, which is a VEGF inhibitor.</p>
<p>So if you have cancer or a high cancer risk,</p>
<p>you probably don&rsquo;t wanna be taking a medication</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the exact opposite mechanism of action</p>
<p>as your essential anti-cancer med.</p>
<p>In other words, if you have cancer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at risk of cancer, avoid BPC-157.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>A lot of people prescribe it for six weeks.</p>
<p>And BPC-157, so brimelanotide,</p>
<p>that is FDA approved for a hypoactive sexual disorder.</p>
<p>Tesamoralin, that&rsquo;s also approved for lipodystrophy.</p>
<p>Interestingly, another one of the melanotans</p>
<p>is also approved for lipodystrophy</p>
<p>and also deficiency in the melanocorticoid receptor.</p>
<p>So the receptor that receives</p>
<p>the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very rare condition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also approved for that,</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t take it, then you get obesity.</p>
<p>But BPC-157 is not FDA approved,</p>
<p>but it is essentially standard of care at this point.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not counting insulin</p>
<p>or growth hormone as peptides,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the most commonly used peptides.</p>
<p>And anecdotally and in some clinical literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fairly well tolerated for short periods of time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the camp that everybody needs to do it</p>
<p>two to three times a week,</p>
<p>or even daily for six weeks, no matter what.</p>
<p>The major benefit is when you&rsquo;re gonna take it early on,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna allow your body</p>
<p>to increase blood flow to the injured area.</p>
<p>And the less blood flow it has,</p>
<p>for example, cartilage ligaments have horrible blood flow,</p>
<p>especially as people age,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna make a significant difference.</p>
<p>So I would wager that that Russian gymnast</p>
<p>that Achilles healed in one month</p>
<p>and completely from a full rupture</p>
<p>was likely taking BPC-157 or something very similar.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m willing to wager on that as well.</p>
<p>A remarkable recovery.</p>
<p>And so because it is prescription,</p>
<p>there are non-prescription forms.</p>
<p>My understanding of the non-prescription forms</p>
<p>and the danger of going after non-prescription forms</p>
<p>is that oftentimes they will contain</p>
<p>what they claim they contain, BPC-157 in this case,</p>
<p>but they are not adequately cleaning out the LPS,</p>
<p>the lipopolysaccharide, which can cause inflammation.</p>
<p>In fact, in the laboratory,</p>
<p>we use LPS to deliberately induce fever and inflammation</p>
<p>to study systemic inflammation.</p>
<p>So this is a warning to people,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in peptides,</p>
<p>you absolutely need to work with a physician, in my opinion,</p>
<p>get it from a really good compounding pharmacy</p>
<p>who will clean out, that cleans out the LPS.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re buying it through a source</p>
<p>that a lot of people, I don&rsquo;t wanna name sources,</p>
<p>but there are these common sources on the internet</p>
<p>that everyone knows about, they&rsquo;re buying these sources,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll ship it to anyone essentially,</p>
<p>but then the LPS is really causing inflammation.</p>
<p>And many people experience a kind of mild fever</p>
<p>or tingling from that when they inject it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh, I can feel it working.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably LPS action, which is not good for the brain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about on other peripheral tissues.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard of people dropping dead from this stuff yet,</p>
<p>but I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t wanna be ingesting</p>
<p>any LPS unnecessarily.</p>
<p>So would you agree that you should work with a doctor?</p>
<p>After all, you are a doctor.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely talk to your doctor about this</p>
<p>and talk to them about the dosing regimen as well.</p>
<p>So if they have you doing it for six weeks,</p>
<p>ask them, why am I doing it for six weeks?</p>
<p>Why not two weeks or why not as soon as I feel better?</p>
<p>Can I just stop it?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of good questions like that</p>
<p>that you should ask your doctor.</p>
<p>And if somebody is trying to prescribe you</p>
<p>a bunch of different things,</p>
<p>then see, is this what they prescribe everybody</p>
<p>or is this individualized for me?</p>
<p>There are peptides like GHK copper peptide,</p>
<p>which is produced endogenously in the liver</p>
<p>more at younger ages.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the liver can regenerate fully</p>
<p>and GHK copper peptide helps.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re copper deficient,</p>
<p>which not a whole lot of people are,</p>
<p>but a lot of people that have had bariatric surgery</p>
<p>are copper deficient.</p>
<p>GHK copper peptide can help significantly</p>
<p>with your nervous system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also synergistic.</p>
<p>So any growth agonist like thymus and beta-4</p>
<p>made in kids in the thymus, which shrinks,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another reason why kids heal really well.</p>
<p>That and GHK is somewhat synergistic with BPC.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t need all three, you don&rsquo;t want them.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t need it for more than a week,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want it for more than a week.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you saying that.</p>
<p>I often say that sometimes the best dose</p>
<p>of something to take is zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often the case that the best dosage is zero.</p>
<p>You mentioned melanotan.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of melanotan.</p>
<p>I find it a little bit of a funny conversation</p>
<p>because I first learned about melanotan</p>
<p>from reading about peptides and discovering</p>
<p>that people were taking, injecting melanotan to get tan,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in the melanin synthesis pathway.</p>
<p>They also discovered, this isn&rsquo;t an individual,</p>
<p>this is reading about this in various manuscripts</p>
<p>and peer-reviewed papers,</p>
<p>that it could cause things like pre-epism,</p>
<p>like a sustained erection that might be the last one</p>
<p>that anyone would ever have</p>
<p>because of damage to the vasculature.</p>
<p>Also women taking melanotan as a way to get tan</p>
<p>and lose body fat.</p>
<p>So this sounds all very recreational.</p>
<p>Are there any clinical usage of melanotan?</p>
<p>So separate from the kind of extreme biohacking</p>
<p>cosmetic world, which is really not the main focus</p>
<p>of this podcast ever,</p>
<p>more in terms of pursuing health optimization.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually three FDA-approved indications,</p>
<p>believe it or not.</p>
<p>Not many people know about this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s three well-accepted indications.</p>
<p>One of them is the hypoactive sexual disorder</p>
<p>and more in women.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for brimelanotide, which is also-</p>
<p>Those are women that have essentially no libido whatsoever,</p>
<p>but other hormones are in check.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Classically, it&rsquo;s before menopause.</p>
<p>So those hormonal issues are not contributing.</p>
<p>And when you give them this peptide,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also known as PT-141.</p>
<p>It helps significantly.</p>
<p>A lot of times you use it in nasal spray.</p>
<p>It goes straight into the central nervous system</p>
<p>and acts centrally.</p>
<p>You can also inject it</p>
<p>and you can also take it via DROKI.</p>
<p>Men and women take it?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s approved for women, but it can also help men.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s relatively safe.</p>
<p>The only relative contraindication that I tell people,</p>
<p>and a lot of people say,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s no side effects that I know of,</p>
<p>but if you have a family history of melanoma</p>
<p>or potentially have a melanoma and don&rsquo;t know about it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a big advocate of dermoscopy as well</p>
<p>and regular skin checks,</p>
<p>then theoretically it&rsquo;s gonna increase</p>
<p>that alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone</p>
<p>and it can grow that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s definitely not a good thing.</p>
<p>So be very careful about long-term administration of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also approved for lipodystrophy,</p>
<p>which is the same exact thing as tesamoralin,</p>
<p>which I believe is also known as Evista or Agrifta.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s also approved for the rare genetic condition</p>
<p>where your receptors or your melanocytes</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t proliferate as well.</p>
<p>So you usually have hypopigmentation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true albinism,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s associated with morbid, morbid obesity</p>
<p>and very poor outcomes from that in childhood.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s used in kids actually.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Well, peptides are a fascinating landscape,</p>
<p>but thank you for that deep dive into several of them.</p>
<p>We will probably return to you to talk about peptides again</p>
<p>in the near future,</p>
<p>because I know there&rsquo;s a lot more there</p>
<p>and a lot of interest.</p>
<p>I wanna talk about the sixth pillar, all right?</p>
<p>So just to remind people, you said diet, exercise,</p>
<p>where appropriate caloric restriction,</p>
<p>managing stress, sleep, and sunlight are critical</p>
<p>for everyone at all ages to manage</p>
<p>and optimize hormone health.</p>
<p>Then you have this sixth category,</p>
<p>which is a really intriguing one, which is spirit,</p>
<p>which is a kind of unusual thing to hear</p>
<p>coming from a medical doctor, except that I have</p>
<p>many colleagues and indeed our former director</p>
<p>of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins,</p>
<p>has talked about this notion of spirit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about belief effects on this podcast before</p>
<p>with Ali Crum, how one&rsquo;s understanding of the things</p>
<p>that they do and their world in general</p>
<p>really creates an important effect on everything</p>
<p>at the level of physiology, not just psychology.</p>
<p>So as a physician, how do you conceptualize</p>
<p>the spiritual aspect and how do you talk to patients</p>
<p>about this, given that people walking into your clinic</p>
<p>presumably have a bunch of different religious</p>
<p>and not a-religious backgrounds?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some are atheists,</p>
<p>some are probably strong believers.</p>
<p>How do you deal with that?</p>
<p>And how should people think about this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I believe it is surprisingly well-received.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t think at first glance that a patient</p>
<p>really wants to talk about their spiritual health</p>
<p>with their doctor, but the way I think about it</p>
<p>and the way that it really is, is it&rsquo;s like a Venn diagram</p>
<p>and you have a body and a mind and a soul</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t have one healthy without the other healthy,</p>
<p>even if your mental health is phenomenal</p>
<p>and even if your physical health is phenomenal.</p>
<p>The mental aspect of spirituality,</p>
<p>if that piece is not there,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s gonna affect your body physiologically as well.</p>
<p>And Ali Crum&rsquo;s done some excellent work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also been a lot of other studies regarding prayer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a Christian, I believe in God.</p>
<p>And that gives me a lot of that resilience and motivation.</p>
<p>It gives me the cornerstone or the groundwork,</p>
<p>how I can interact with life.</p>
<p>And regardless of someone&rsquo;s an atheist</p>
<p>or regardless of what someone believes</p>
<p>as far as religion or the origin of the species,</p>
<p>they can know that their spirituality</p>
<p>is going to have a profound effect</p>
<p>on their mental and physical health as well.</p>
<p>People like to compartmentalize it.</p>
<p>So they like to talk to their doctor</p>
<p>only about the physical health</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s comfortable to do that.</p>
<p>They only talk to their pastor or a mom</p>
<p>or a reiki healer for their spiritual health.</p>
<p>And they just talk to their therapist or psychiatrist</p>
<p>about their mental health.</p>
<p>But you need to bring all three of those things together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well known that interdisciplinary clinics</p>
<p>lead to improved patient outcomes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just disciplines within medicine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just doctors that are specializing</p>
<p>in this or this.</p>
<p>So this takes a step back in the upper part of that tree</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;ve reached those dichotomies or the split offs.</p>
<p>You have your body and your mind and your soul.</p>
<p>So your spiritual health and your mental health</p>
<p>and your physical health.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in line in all three of those things,</p>
<p>that builds the cornerstone for the rest of your health</p>
<p>and the rest of your life.</p>
<p>So if someone comes into your clinic</p>
<p>and they say they&rsquo;re feeling one way in their body,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re feeling one way in their emotional life,</p>
<p>you run their charts, you get their blood work,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re an atheist or they&rsquo;re agnostic,</p>
<p>what are some of the six pillar practices</p>
<p>that they can consider that are in keeping</p>
<p>with their atheism or agnosticism?</p>
<p>Because I have to assume that people who participate</p>
<p>or feel that they belong to a particular religious sect</p>
<p>will have particular prescriptives from those religious sects</p>
<p>that will direct them towards particular types of prayer.</p>
<p>But how would somebody who doesn&rsquo;t have a prescriptive</p>
<p>coming to them from some other source,</p>
<p>what could they do or would they do?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I certainly don&rsquo;t force prayer on anybody</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s my belief that being, especially being an agnostic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost the hardest thing because if you&rsquo;re an atheist,</p>
<p>then you have some groundwork</p>
<p>and you have some spirituality,</p>
<p>even if it has to do with the human spirit&rsquo;s interaction</p>
<p>with the environment,</p>
<p>things that can&rsquo;t be physically explained well,</p>
<p>phenomenon like the work that Alikram does.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re agnostic, you&rsquo;re still trying to find that.</p>
<p>So I hope that everybody does find</p>
<p>what they truly believe in as far as their own spirituality.</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s a personal journey.</p>
<p>From a physician standpoint,</p>
<p>and even if I&rsquo;m friends with him as well,</p>
<p>from a friend standpoint,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to push anybody in any specific direction.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that everybody should believe what I believe</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t feel like there should be any pressure</p>
<p>for them to believe something different.</p>
<p>So I think that there can be excellent physician,</p>
<p>patient rapport, regardless of what we believe</p>
<p>and what our backgrounds are.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s wonderful to hear.</p>
<p>I can say without revealing any names</p>
<p>that I have close colleagues</p>
<p>that in every bin of this spectrum,</p>
<p>but like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious</p>
<p>in different domains, different religions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I know many,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m agnostic as to whether or not I know any agnostics,</p>
<p>I should say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that people commonly discuss,</p>
<p>but in the context of science and medicine,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s starting to happen more and more.</p>
<p>And certainly this issue of spirituality</p>
<p>is one of the areas in which neuroscience</p>
<p>is asking a lot of questions,</p>
<p>like what spiritual experiences really are</p>
<p>in terms of how they&rsquo;re grounded in the brain</p>
<p>or not grounded in the brain.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really interesting area for discovery.</p>
<p>And I appreciate that you bring it up</p>
<p>and you bring it up in the non-pressured way that you do.</p>
<p>I think that it will stimulate a lot of thinking,</p>
<p>which is ultimately the goal of this podcast.</p>
<p>Well, I have one final question</p>
<p>that a listener insisted I ask,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very straightforward one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not at all a curve ball</p>
<p>and not at all related to what we were just talking about,</p>
<p>but it was the most common question</p>
<p>when I told people that I was gonna be talking to you,</p>
<p>which is, is caffeine problematic for hormones?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve received hundreds of the same question about caffeine.</p>
<p>And since it&rsquo;s probably the most commonly used drug</p>
<p>on the planet, I know it&rsquo;s taking us back</p>
<p>into the very practical, but in closing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not quite there yet,</p>
<p>but in closing, is caffeine having an effect</p>
<p>one way or the other on testosterone, estrogen,</p>
<p>or other hormones that is positive, negative, or neutral?</p>
<p>Only if it affects your sleep.</p>
<p>So it works on adenosine</p>
<p>and it can actually slightly improve allergies as well,</p>
<p>but negligible effect otherwise.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, sorry to end on such a practical brass tacks</p>
<p>type of question, but I did promise to the listeners</p>
<p>that I would ask that question.</p>
<p>Listen, I want to sincerely thank you.</p>
<p>We covered basically an endocrinology textbook,</p>
<p>a neuroendocrinology textbook&rsquo;s worth of information,</p>
<p>a ton of practical tips in there.</p>
<p>Where can people find out more about you?</p>
<p>We will certainly provide links.</p>
<p>And I guess the other question is, are you taking patients?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll hear that in the various venues</p>
<p>where people can contact you,</p>
<p>but where are you active in terms of public facing work?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m active on Instagram, Kyle Gillette, MD.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also active on the social medias of my brand new clinic,</p>
<p>which is Gillette Health.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at Gillette Health on Instagram or gillettehealth.com.</p>
<p>Great, we&rsquo;ll provide links to those.</p>
<p>And I should say that the content you&rsquo;ve been putting out</p>
<p>on Instagram is terrific</p>
<p>because you actually point to specific studies</p>
<p>and you put things into actionable context,</p>
<p>which is very meaningful for me.</p>
<p>Kyle, Dr. Gillette, I should say,</p>
<p>thanks so much for your time.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I know the listeners will too.</p>
<p>Thank you, my pleasure.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for my discussion</p>
<p>about hormone health and optimization</p>
<p>with Dr. Kyle Gillette.</p>
<p>As you just heard,</p>
<p>he is a treasure trove of actionable, clear information.</p>
<p>And again, you can find him teaching more about hormones</p>
<p>and other aspects of health on Instagram at Kyle Gillette.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Gillette with two T&rsquo;s and two L&rsquo;s, but no E.</p>
<p>Kyle Gillette, MD on Instagram</p>
<p>and Gillette Health on all other platforms.</p>
<p>And if you would like more information about his practice,</p>
