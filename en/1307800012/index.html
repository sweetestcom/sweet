    <p>Hi everyone, this is Kevin Stroud from the History of English podcast.</p>
<p>This is a bonus episode, I just wanted to use this opportunity to give you a quick couple</p>
<p>of updates related to the podcast and also answer a few questions that I&rsquo;ve been receiving.</p>
<p>This is not a regular episode and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not numbered in sequence, but I thought</p>
<p>this would probably be the best way to address a few little quick issues with you.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to thank everyone for listening, I&rsquo;ve really been surprised and</p>
<p>I really do appreciate the number of you listening, I really didn&rsquo;t expect the podcast</p>
<p>to grow this quickly, but it has really grown.</p>
<p>There are many days where this podcast is ranked in the top 10 and sometimes even in</p>
<p>the top 5 history podcasts on iTunes, and I really again want to thank all of you for</p>
<p>listening to this and I hope you&rsquo;re finding it enjoyable and entertaining, I certainly</p>
<p>am finding it enjoyable providing it to you.</p>
<p>I did want to give a quick update related to the website because I&rsquo;ve been getting a</p>
<p>few questions about that.</p>
<p>The primary website for the podcast is historyofenglishpodcast.com, there&rsquo;s a reason why I haven&rsquo;t mentioned</p>
<p>that website a lot in earlier episodes of the podcast, I really did not have it in a</p>
<p>form that I was comfortable with, but it is finally getting there, so I did want to mention</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been getting a few questions about the resources that I use when I put the episodes</p>
<p>together and there really is not one or two major resources.</p>
<p>I have dozens and dozens, probably over 100 different books and resources that I use,</p>
<p>and so what I&rsquo;ve started doing is on the website you&rsquo;ll see a link to a page called Resources,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just sort of listing various books and resources that I use, and I&rsquo;m not breaking</p>
<p>it down by episode because that would be almost impossible for me to do, each episode again</p>
<p>pulls from so many different resources, but that at least gives you an opportunity if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re interested in the topics and want to explore it a little bit further, you can actually</p>
<p>see some of the resources that I&rsquo;m using.</p>
<p>Also I did want to mention that at the website there is a separate page for each episode,</p>
<p>so you can listen to the podcast episodes and you can download them from there, and</p>
<p>right now there is a brief summary of each episode on the page, I&rsquo;ll be probably providing</p>
<p>a little bit more content, and where I do have specific resources for the episode that</p>
<p>I want to mention, I&rsquo;ll list it there, so if there is an episode from time to time that</p>
<p>really grabs your attention and you&rsquo;re really interested in it, that would be the best place</p>
<p>to start as far as getting more information, and again, if I have information to pass along</p>
<p>that would probably be where I would put it.</p>
<p>Let me also mention as you go to the website you&rsquo;ll see a reference there to an upcoming,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m calling a listener&rsquo;s guide, it&rsquo;s actually called A Listener&rsquo;s Guide to the</p>
<p>History of English Volume 1.</p>
<p>What that is, I&rsquo;ve gotten questions again about some of the specific things I&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about and people wanted more information about it, and so what I&rsquo;m going to do is actually</p>
<p>compile a lot of my notes and episode scripts and various other information that I have</p>
<p>into one complete written volume, and it&rsquo;ll cover what I&rsquo;m calling Volume 1, which is</p>
<p>the history of English from the Indo-European origins through the migration of Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>to Britain, so that&rsquo;s the pre-English period, and I&rsquo;m going to hope to have that available</p>
<p>very shortly, and then I&rsquo;ll do essentially the same thing on the second volume, which</p>
<p>will be Old English, the third volume, which will be Middle English, and the fourth volume,</p>
<p>which will be Modern English.</p>
<p>So I hope to have an episode guide available for each of those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically going to be a written version of the podcast.</p>
<p>Each episode would be equivalent to a chapter, but it&rsquo;s not an actual transcript.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be written in a more traditional written e-book or book style, and probably we&rsquo;ll provide</p>
<p>it in a digital e-book version and maybe even in a printed version.</p>
<p>Again, all of that I&rsquo;ll sort out in the future, but that&rsquo;ll help for those of you who want</p>
<p>more information or want the information in a written form.</p>
<p>I may charge a small fee for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about that now, but if I do, that would help cover some of the cost of</p>
<p>the podcast, of preparing it and storing the episodes and all of that, but again, all that</p>
<p>to be worked out in the near future.</p>
<p>I also had a question from a listener about my credentials, who was just curious, and</p>
<p>so I did think this would be a good opportunity to address that.</p>
<p>I am not a professional linguist.</p>
<p>I am not a professional historian.</p>
<p>I am, by trade, I am an attorney, and so every day I draft various legal documents, wills,</p>
<p>trusts, contracts, and so I have to parse the English language on a daily basis, but</p>
<p>I am not a professionally trained linguist or historian, so I did want to make that clear,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve tried to make it clear throughout the podcast so far that this is not a linguistics</p>
<p>podcast, even though it may not always seem like that.</p>
<p>In a few episodes, I&rsquo;ve dealt with some specific linguistic issues, but really for the most</p>
<p>part, this is a history podcast, and certainly moving forward, there will be more and more</p>
<p>history and a little bit less linguistics and grammar and specific aspects of language,</p>
<p>but anytime you&rsquo;re doing a podcast about the history of a language, you&rsquo;re going to deal</p>
<p>with some language issues, so that will always be part of the podcast, but it&rsquo;ll be more</p>
<p>history as we go forward.</p>
<p>Even though I don&rsquo;t have a degree in history or in linguistics, I did have the opportunity</p>
<p>to study it in college.</p>
<p>In fact, I had the opportunity to study under Walt Wolfram at North Carolina State University,</p>
<p>and Professor Wolfram is really one of the leading experts on American regional dialects.</p>
<p>In fact, you might see him from time to time on television.</p>
<p>In fact, he was recently in an episode of How the States Got Their Shapes on the History</p>
<p>Channel, and so he was one of the early professors that really sparked my interest in language</p>
<p>and language history, and so I do credit him with part of that, and as I said, I do have</p>
<p>some academic background in that area, but ultimately, this is really more of an amateur</p>
<p>effort than any kind of professional effort.</p>
<p>So then I did get a few questions about the earlier episodes of the podcast, so I thought</p>
<p>I would address those here.</p>
<p>Russell asked about the Basque language.</p>
<p>I had mentioned that in the episode on the Indo-European family tree, which I believe</p>
<p>was episode 3, and I mentioned, after going through all of the languages within the Indo-European</p>
<p>family tree, I mentioned a few languages that were not Indo-European, but that are spoken</p>
<p>in Europe, and I think I mentioned Basque at the beginning, and then I mentioned a few</p>
<p>others including Hungarian and Finnish and Estonian, and then I noted that those were</p>
<p>Uralic languages.</p>
<p>Well, my comment was really directed towards those languages at the end, like Finnish and</p>
<p>Estonian.</p>
<p>I think, though, that I worded it very awkwardly, and so it implied that Basque was also a Uralic</p>
<p>language, and Russell correctly noted that that is not the case, so I did want to clear</p>
<p>that up a bit.</p>
<p>Basque is spoken in northern Spain.</p>
<p>It is not a Uralic language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an isolated language, but I know that, again, the way I worded that might have</p>
<p>been a little confusing, so I did want to clear that up.</p>
<p>Also, Frank asked a question about the episode that I did on Kentum, Sodom, and the history</p>
<p>of the letter C. I talked about the change of the pronunciation, the assimilation of</p>
<p>the K sound, the letter C and the K sound in Old English, and I mentioned one of the</p>
<p>examples I gave was the original version of the word child, and I noted that it was originally</p>
<p>spelled C-I-L-D, but it was pronounced child, but then eventually shifted to child, and</p>
<p>Frank asked about the modern pronunciation.</p>
<p>We have child, but then children, so we have a long I in child, but a short I in children,</p>
<p>and was just curious about that, and I really don&rsquo;t have a specific answer to that question,</p>
<p>but there were a couple of things I wanted to mention.</p>
<p>If you go by the textbook pronunciation of Old English, the pronunciation of the I in</p>
<p>Old English would have been E, so C-I-L-D would have been child instead of child, but</p>
<p>you have to be very careful about that, because when I say the official Old English pronunciation,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re going to see when we get to Old English, there really was not one Old English language.</p>
<p>During the period of the Anglo-Saxons, there was tremendous variation in the dialects within</p>
<p>England, and when we talk about Old English, what we&rsquo;re really talking about is one particular</p>
<p>Old English dialect, the West Saxon dialect, so we have to be careful in saying anything</p>
<p>too definitively about the way that Old English, quote-unquote, was pronounced.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re really talking about is one particular dialect, and then to kind of add to that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even more difficult to pinpoint vowels.</p>
<p>Even in modern English, vowels vary tremendously.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s one of the things that really distinguishes regional accents and dialects.</p>
<p>You say tomato, I say tomato, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So, getting a really good handle on the way vowels were pronounced and why they change</p>
<p>and when they change and where they change is very difficult.</p>
<p>I even mentioned back in the episode on Grimm&rsquo;s Law that for all the work that Jacob Grimm</p>
<p>did identifying changes in consonants, he really didn&rsquo;t even attempt to tackle the vowels.</p>
<p>Now, later linguists did, but the point there is vowels are very tricky and notoriously</p>
<p>difficult to pin down.</p>
<p>So exactly when and where and how and why those vowels change is a little bit difficult</p>
<p>to say.</p>
<p>I would note, though, that the word child or child in Old English meant both singular</p>
<p>and plural.</p>
<p>I really didn&rsquo;t get into that.</p>
<p>But in the Old English period, you used the word child for both an individual child and</p>
<p>a group.</p>
<p>So you had one child or several child, much like the word fish, one fish or school of fish.</p>
<p>It was in the very late Old English period and early Middle English period that the word</p>
<p>changed and it began to develop the multiple form, children, and it&rsquo;s believed to be connected</p>
<p>to the word brethren, meaning, again, multiple family members.</p>
<p>So as to exactly when the pronunciation changed, we&rsquo;re not really sure, or I&rsquo;m not really sure.</p>
<p>I think, though, we probably can look at what&rsquo;s called the Great Vowel Shift for part of the</p>
<p>answer.</p>
<p>Around 1500, the pronunciation of the vowels shifted.</p>
<p>One of the big changes was this letter I, which went from the original E pronunciation</p>
<p>to the I pronunciation that we often find today.</p>
<p>And in fact, you still see that old pronunciation in certain English dialects.</p>
<p>Lots of British English speakers still pronounce M-Y as me instead of my.</p>
<p>So we do still see the older pronunciations.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very likely that what happened during the Great Vowel Shift is that the word child</p>
<p>shifted from child to child, but children, for whatever reason, did not completely make</p>
<p>that shift.</p>
<p>And so anyway, I just wanted to note that it was a very good question and I did want</p>
<p>to at least make an effort to tackle it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not researched it thoroughly, so I&rsquo;m not including it in a regular episode of the</p>
<p>podcast, but that&rsquo;s my best guess and best rendering of an answer based on the information</p>
<p>that I have.</p>
<p>If others of you have more information, feel free to send it to me.</p>
<p>And I do want to invite you, from time to time, if you have comments or questions about</p>
<p>the podcast, feel free to contact me.</p>
<p>The best way to do that by email is kevin, K-E-V-I-N, at historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And again, feel free to send those comments and questions if you have them.</p>
<p>And from time to time, if I do get questions, I&rsquo;ll probably do additional bonus episodes</p>
<p>and try to address them.</p>
<p>And again, though, thank you all for listening, and stay tuned for the next episode, which</p>
<p>will be released in a few days.</p>
<p>And as always, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
