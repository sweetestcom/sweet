    <p>All right, everybody, welcome to another edition of the all in podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call this episode one.</p>
<p>We did a test and over 100,000 of you listened to the test podcast that we did in a few days,</p>
<p>in a few days.</p>
<p>Chamath is already getting addicted to his statistics, a new podcaster.</p>
<p>I need to focus on something going up.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Our portfolios are getting crushed, but the podcast numbers are going up there with a</p>
<p>meaningless victory to be sure, but we got a lot of positive feedback and we&rsquo;re all sitting</p>
<p>at home in quarantine.</p>
<p>As you can see, I&rsquo;d set up my home office.</p>
<p>I got a microphone here and Chamath is in his bedroom and Dave Friedberg, I think is</p>
<p>in his wine room or something in his, in his compound.</p>
<p>Are you in the safe room?</p>
<p>Is this the safe room?</p>
<p>Dave Friedberg is with us again.</p>
<p>He got a lot of great feedback and he&rsquo;s now on the Twitter.</p>
<p>You can follow him at Friedberg.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he shut his Twitter down because he was getting harassed on Twitter.</p>
<p>Welcome to the club.</p>
<p>Are you in your safe room, David?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brutal on Twitter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you guys do it.</p>
<p>You put something up and everyone, you know, just goes after you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harsh out there in the Twitter world, in the Twitterverse.</p>
<p>Basically you have to mute and block anybody who is under 100 followers and being an absolute</p>
<p>jerk because it&rsquo;s likely a Russian bot, you know, being run out of like Manila or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>You have all these like sophisticated rings of people that they just hire for 10 bucks</p>
<p>a day to harass people online.</p>
<p>I mean, I know it sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory, but it&rsquo;s actually true.</p>
<p>This large groups of bots who go after people and try to create chaos.</p>
<p>But hey, we&rsquo;re sitting here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s Wednesday.</p>
<p>We did our podcast on Saturday.</p>
<p>The stock market has gone down another 20% since then, I guess, or so.</p>
<p>We are looking like this is going to be a 50% correction or something like that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now well past a 30 plus percent.</p>
<p>On the good news front, it looks like testing is actually occurring and that work on treatments</p>
<p>is occurring.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we can call them cures, but treatments is occurring and a quarantine in</p>
<p>place is being taken seriously.</p>
<p>I guess the biggest thing is that Trump has basically admitted that this is a crisis and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s taking it seriously.</p>
<p>Friedberg, what is your assessment of where we are today versus when we taped on Saturday</p>
<p>in terms of the resolution to this?</p>
<p>Are we overreacting, reacting just enough or not reacting enough?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three things to consider.</p>
<p>The health, the policy, and then the markets.</p>
<p>On the health front, it seems like we have done a lot in terms of containment and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ramping up testing.</p>
<p>We are still not doing broad general population testing, which is necessary for us to truly</p>
<p>understand the dynamics of this disease and also to understand the contagion of this disease.</p>
<p>We need to fix that problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a task force of 100 people out of DC being led by Jared Kushner and a number</p>
<p>of people from the tech industry that are working on ramping up testing and doing broader</p>
<p>general population testing.</p>
<p>The policy decisions are what get quite scary, and that is all of the containment, shutting</p>
<p>down travel, shutting down borders, shutting down bridges, and the economic ramifications</p>
<p>of doing so are frightening.</p>
<p>I think I mentioned the other day that 48% roughly of the US workforce works in small</p>
<p>businesses, another roughly 10% work in travel, another roughly 12% work in energy.</p>
<p>You kind of add this up and you can quickly see why Steve Mnuchin, the US Treasury Secretary,</p>
<p>was saying that we should expect 20% to 30% of the workforce to be unemployed by this</p>
<p>summer if we keep this up.</p>
<p>So that is a frustrating and staggering statistic and something worth debating whether that</p>
<p>policy decision is appropriate relative to the potential life and health system impact,</p>
<p>which one is worse.</p>
<p>And then the market question is just &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how to address that, but things</p>
<p>go from bad to worse, right?</p>
<p>I have eight things that I want to cover.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take one thing at a time here.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s warned to go.</p>
<p>I want to say one more thing, and it is I think the most important data to come out</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>So the markets are fucked.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all in trouble.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, you know, yada, yada.</p>
<p>The most scary thing is Ford and GM just shut down their plants today, and the reason they</p>
<p>shut down their plants is because out of fear of coronavirus and autoworkers, and the UAW</p>
<p>basically forced them to do it.</p>
<p>The world lives on a 30-day food supply.</p>
<p>So if you stop food production today, there would only be 30 days of food for the whole</p>
<p>world to eat based on our calorie consumption per day, and especially with an isolated border</p>
<p>and we import a lot of food in the United States.</p>
<p>If that means that we are then going to shut down other factories, the Ford-GM shutdown,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to shut down food production, processing, and distribution factories, then</p>
<p>we have a food security crisis, and this becomes a real societal problem.</p>
<p>So the concern that I have with the factories being shut down today is the precedent it</p>
<p>sets and the potential follow-on from there in the food system, and one thing we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stop doing is making and distributing food to humans in the United States or else we</p>
<p>are going to have problems.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, but before we go there, the good news is that these directives don&rsquo;t apply</p>
<p>to national critical infrastructure, and the food supply is covered within that.</p>
<p>So unless something cataclysmic happens, those folks are still going to make sure that</p>
<p>food supply is there.</p>
<p>I do agree with you that the issue that we have to contend with is that there may not</p>
<p>be as much, and in the 30th to 90th day, that becomes a real issue if this thing becomes</p>
<p>a very protracted problem.</p>
<p>This sort of brings us back, David, without being too alarmist about how we started and</p>
<p>how you started really importantly at the beginning, which is there is a small but very</p>
<p>credible body of evidence that is starting to show, and this is what you put out on Twitter</p>
<p>and part of why you got attacked probably by the pharma lobby.</p>
<p>But that shows that there is potentially an enormously large asymptomatic spreader dynamic</p>
<p>in this disease.</p>
<p>Can you describe that and what that may mean and why there&rsquo;s a lot of silver lining and</p>
<p>good news in that if it&rsquo;s true?</p>
<p>There are several data points that are showing us that there may be an unexpectedly high</p>
<p>number of people that get this disease and don&rsquo;t have any symptoms and show it.</p>
<p>The historical data that we&rsquo;ve gathered to date has been largely symptomatic patients,</p>
<p>and in some places like in Korea, asymptomatic patients that had really close contact with</p>
<p>symptomatic patients that were confirmed to be positive.</p>
<p>And in Korea in particular, they found a large cohort, nearly 40% of the infected population</p>
<p>were people between 20 and 29 years old that did not exhibit any symptoms or had very mild</p>
<p>symptoms, had a runny nose, and didn&rsquo;t even know that they were sick.</p>
<p>On the Princess cruise ship, it turns out that up to 50% may have been asymptomatic.</p>
<p>People were all tested on that cruise ship because there were so many people that were</p>
<p>positive and through that data set, that cohort, we found a very large asymptomatic</p>
<p>population, 50% roughly.</p>
<p>The NBA players have now been tested and out of seven players on five teams, so out of</p>
<p>seven players on those five teams that have tested positive, it seems like none of them</p>
<p>are having any symptoms.</p>
<p>There may be one person who&rsquo;s having a cough, but generally they seem one of, I think it</p>
<p>was Donovan Mitchell said, I could go play a seven game series tomorrow.</p>
<p>So this data is really important and it hasn&rsquo;t been fully accounted for in the models and</p>
<p>the predictions of the pandemic and the predictions of the fatality rate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re assuming that let&rsquo;s say 2% of people that get this disease end up dying.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s also based on an age histogram that may not be appropriate for</p>
<p>our particular cohort in the United States.</p>
<p>If you took that data and then you just did it based on the fact that a large percentage</p>
<p>of people actually don&rsquo;t die, but they end up just being asymptomatic, it really changes</p>
<p>the denominator and it skews the results.</p>
<p>A paper published showed that in China, up to 86% of people did not realize that they</p>
<p>were sick or they were unreported and they had mild symptoms.</p>
<p>If you take that high level, you take that low level, call it somewhere between 25 and</p>
<p>86%, maybe even as high as 86% of patients are asymptomatic, which means that the actual</p>
<p>fatality rate is much, much lower even in a large cohort that gets infected here.</p>
<p>So we should be mindful of this new data that&rsquo;s emerging and we&rsquo;re still racing and acting</p>
<p>from a policy basis as if 2% of people, 3% of people, 4% of people that get this are</p>
<p>going to die and that may not actually be true based on what we&rsquo;re seeing in the last week.</p>
<p>I have a comment and a statement.</p>
<p>The comment is people will say, David, you can&rsquo;t extrapolate from an NBA player who may</p>
<p>just be in peak physical fitness, although I think your answer is going to be, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>clear that the disease is correlated necessarily with physical fitness for unphysical fitness</p>
<p>at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just maybe the strain and how your body processes it.</p>
<p>But then the question is, doesn&rsquo;t this mean that we need to have broad-based massive testing,</p>
<p>not just of symptomatic population, so not just the PCR test that we&rsquo;ve heard a lot about,</p>
<p>but also these antibody tests so that we know that people have had it?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the status of that, David?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the status of it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right, Chamath.</p>
<p>And by the way, on the healthy NBA player point, it&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>People that are between 20 and 30, the average age in the NBA is 26 years old.</p>
<p>People that are between 20 and 30 years old generally seem to have no to mild symptoms</p>
<p>based on what we saw in Korea.</p>
<p>The other data sets need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>So the NBA is an interesting anecdote, sure, and you could discredit it all you want and</p>
<p>say that it&rsquo;s a highly correlated class and so on because everyone&rsquo;s together all the</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>But we could look at the data that came out of China in a paper that was published in</p>
<p>the journal Science and a paper that was published in the journal Nature from Korea that showed</p>
<p>very large percentages, anywhere from 20 to 50 to 80% or 90% of people being completely</p>
<p>asymptomatic across an age spectrum.</p>
<p>Certainly very heavier weighted towards the younger age bracket from children all the</p>
<p>way up to 30 or 40 years old, you can be completely asymptomatic.</p>
<p>And so these are really interesting discoveries that have happened.</p>
<p>And so to your point, we need more data and we need to confirm that hypothesis because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how science works.</p>
<p>So we have a hypothesis, let&rsquo;s go test it.</p>
<p>The problem is we&rsquo;re not testing it and we should be as a priority right now because</p>
<p>the policy decisions we&rsquo;re making are based upon a denominator that may be wrong.</p>
<p>So the correct action should be to go get those antibody tests, go out into the population</p>
<p>and start testing the asymptomatic general population and see what percentage of people</p>
<p>in these high risk zones like Seattle and LA and New York and SF already have the antibodies</p>
<p>to this virus, meaning they&rsquo;ve been infected with this virus and have not or are not showing</p>
<p>any symptoms.</p>
<p>And that gives us a better sense of A, how widespread this infection is and B, the true</p>
<p>dynamics of the fatality rate and the symptomology of this disease and how it may affect people.</p>
<p>Those IgG tests are being made en masse in China today.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re being shipped to countries like Italy where they are in fact being used on the front</p>
<p>line.</p>
<p>They involve a blood draw and then they have this lateral, they&rsquo;re called a lateral flow</p>
<p>assay in terms of how they&rsquo;re kind of tested.</p>
<p>The blood runs across a strip and you see a value and you have a pretty good sense at</p>
<p>that point.</p>
<p>Those kits cost a couple of pennies to make in China.</p>
<p>We could probably get a couple million of them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why someone in the federal government isn&rsquo;t begging China and apologizing</p>
<p>and appeasing to them to send us those kits.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people I know that have bought them on the internet.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of people that I know have bought them.</p>
<p>They have been shipped in through brokers and they are not FDA approved.</p>
<p>They cannot be used for diagnostic purposes because of FDA guidelines and how the FDA</p>
<p>regulates these things.</p>
<p>They can be used for research purposes, but they may not be very sensitive and very specific</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have great testing on them.</p>
<p>They estimate the sensitivity and the specificity to be 90%, roughly 10% false positive, roughly</p>
<p>10% false negative, but for what we&rsquo;re trying to accomplish, that&rsquo;s good enough.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not trying to give people a diagnosis of disease.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to run an epidemiological study and we should on the general population to</p>
<p>figure out how many people out there are asymptomatic and have been infected.</p>
<p>That is an important statistic that&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>To your point, if we find out that there is a large population of people that have actually</p>
<p>felt this disease pass through them, it&rsquo;s faster that we can sort of get people back</p>
<p>to work out in the streets, which is now probably going to be the most important thing we can</p>
<p>do to just prevent a complete economic calamity.</p>
<p>There are Jason.</p>
<p>By the way, sorry, treatments, Shamoff.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt you, but treatments are the other thing and I think you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>talk about that.</p>
<p>Treatments are interesting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that right now because to me, what&rsquo;s incredible is again, now what is</p>
<p>emerging and it&rsquo;s small in scale relative to how amplified it may, may, should or should</p>
<p>not be is remdesivir is very different, but it just seems like prophylactically even there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some data that&rsquo;s showing out of France that chloroquine seems to be the most effective</p>
<p>treatment.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that.</p>
<p>to be effective.</p>
<p>These are solutions that are pennies to make and some of the feedback that I&rsquo;ve heard is</p>
<p>that part of why the FDA, the CDC, the federal apparatus is reluctant to embrace these things</p>
<p>is in part because of pressure from those lobbies, but that seems to me unfathomable</p>
<p>in a moment like this.</p>
<p>So why do you think the government hasn&rsquo;t put out, the CDC has zero directive right</p>
<p>now on the management and efficacious management of this disease?</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What Feucci and others have said and doctors around the country echo is that these treatments</p>
<p>have not been clinically tested through a blinded controlled study.</p>
<p>That is a very fair assertion, generally speaking, for doing good medicine, but we are in a crisis</p>
<p>state and in a crisis state, you have to triage and you also have to triage policy and we</p>
<p>should be considering triaging policy and changing the way that we do policy under these</p>
<p>extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>If doing treatment can reduce fatality rates by up to 4X, as Korean doctors have claimed,</p>
<p>it is worth taking the risk or perhaps it is worth letting the FDA say remdesivir,</p>
<p>cholesterol, chloroquine, and others are being widely produced, widely distributed.</p>
<p>The government is mandating it and doctors and their patients can decide if and when</p>
<p>they want to use it and let them take the risk without clinical trials and without data</p>
<p>and the typical process of the FDA.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the downside of taking these drugs?</p>
<p>Are they particularly dangerous?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard the colloquine, am I pronouncing it correctly, colloquine, chloroquine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that this can be a little bit nasty in terms of side effects.</p>
<p>So is there some major downside that, I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of like an off use of a drug, right?</p>
<p>Like this is an off use of a drug as opposed to&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an off use of a drug and some of the antivirals aren&rsquo;t even fully tested in humans.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t yet know what the side effects may be.</p>
<p>And also remember, side effects can change based upon your health condition.</p>
<p>So someone that&rsquo;s in respiratory distress may have different side effects than someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s taking it in a healthy controlled clinical trial.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not really sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the argument that doctors would make is our first mandate is to do no harm.</p>
<p>And so they don&rsquo;t want to apply a medicine that might do harm.</p>
<p>And so that is the standard protocol and practice and process.</p>
<p>However, again, in a crisis state, China and Korea said, guys, we&rsquo;re trying this thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s working and we&rsquo;re adopting it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go for it.</p>
<p>And they raced forward.</p>
<p>It could be that this is a good time for the United States to consider an emergency policy</p>
<p>action where we make a lot of this stuff, make it available and simply let doctors use</p>
<p>their best judgment rather than have the FDA be the paternal state that makes a decision</p>
<p>for the doctors or makes a recommendation to the doctors.</p>
<p>What do we think the fatality rate actually is like, David, if you were looking at this</p>
<p>and you had to place a bet and put 100% of your net worth on it and be all in and have</p>
<p>massive skin in the game, where do you think the fatality rate here in the United States</p>
<p>winds up being overall, because the data that came out of Wuhan has been markedly going</p>
<p>down as they get the numbers corrected, who knows Chinese numbers, you know, censored</p>
<p>by the government and maybe perhaps massaged, it&rsquo;s going to be hard to tell.</p>
<p>What do you think the real fatality rate is?</p>
<p>The first fatality rate I heard was 5.8% out of China.</p>
<p>The Wuhan data, based on the paper that came out in Science over the weekend, the Wuhan</p>
<p>data was estimated to be 1.4%.</p>
<p>And Wuhan was the worst data out of China.</p>
<p>The quote-unquote rest of China is still estimated at about 0.15% or 0.16% or 0.14%,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>Where is that versus like the flu every year or something or the normal flu?</p>
<p>1.1% roughly.</p>
<p>And so, you know, if you&rsquo;re looking at somewhere between 0.2% and 1.5%, now in Italy, I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at over 7%.</p>
<p>We talked about this on the last show, but Italy is a much older population and their</p>
<p>health system is completely overwhelmed.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some confounding data, there&rsquo;s confounding variables there that may be making</p>
<p>Italy a very unique outlier on a distribution of what&rsquo;s going to happen here.</p>
<p>The United States has a population that&rsquo;s a little bit older than China, but much younger</p>
<p>than Italy.</p>
<p>So our health system is, and our health system is generally more ICU beds per capita than</p>
<p>Italy.</p>
<p>So we should be in a better place.</p>
<p>The thing we don&rsquo;t know that does concern me about the health system in the United States</p>
<p>and the population of the United States is it seems that there may be a high correlation</p>
<p>with severity of disease and A1C levels.</p>
<p>And as a result, the U.S. has one of the highest obesity rates of any country in the world</p>
<p>and highest diabetes rates.</p>
<p>And so we may have a population that has a very high percentage of people with a high</p>
<p>A1C that may be at higher risk than, say, people in other countries.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that for sure, but that is, those are two kind of confounding statistics that</p>
<p>may kind of make things a little bit worse.</p>
<p>If I were to put my money on this, look, I&rsquo;m a betting guy, I would be a little bit nervous</p>
<p>at this point, but I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s probably somewhere between 0.15 and call it 1.8%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an order of magnitude, I know.</p>
<p>But you could do the math.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably somewhere between one and 10 times as bad as the flu.</p>
<p>And so that, again, leads to the big policy question about are the actions warranted and</p>
<p>is it okay to let the health system crash?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a perfect then flip to you, Chamath.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard his, basically his line at 0.1 to 10 times the flu, 1.8 or something.</p>
<p>If we split the difference of those two, it&rsquo;s 0.5, it&rsquo;s 0.6, 0.7 fatality rate.</p>
<p>Is the reaction of sheltering in place and the economic turmoil it&rsquo;s causing worth it?</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>Right now, you guys need to keep talking.</p>
<p>I need to jump off for two seconds and I&rsquo;m going to come right back.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>
<p>And so what do you think now, if we were to look at your estimate, David, is it actually</p>
<p>worth what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>Would we, if you and I were making the policy or you and I and Chamath were, you know, the</p>
<p>cabinet members, as it were, making this decision, is this decision and the economy crashing</p>
<p>and a potentiality of 10, 15, 20% unemployment and all the downstream effects, would it be</p>
<p>better to do what the UK was originally doing, which is just, hey, let&rsquo;s get the herd mentality</p>
<p>going and let&rsquo;s get the herd immunity going?</p>
<p>I know this is like the most difficult question in the world, but we&rsquo;re here, so let&rsquo;s speculate.</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s a spectrum of options.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not binary, right?</p>
<p>It may not be lock everyone up and let everyone out the door.</p>
<p>It may be that you have a more nuanced policy where you say, let&rsquo;s keep people over 65 years</p>
<p>old, give them the strong recommendation to stay home and make sure that you distribute</p>
<p>chloroquine to doctors around the country.</p>
<p>So as soon as elderly people start having symptoms, they maybe get some treatment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of an option.</p>
<p>You keep 65-year-olds at home, you do random general population antibody testing, and once</p>
<p>you hit a certain percentage of the population having been exposed to this thing, it may</p>
<p>be that at that point you say, okay, the over 65 limit is lifted, or it may be that you</p>
<p>do something similar to that.</p>
<p>Different age brackets have different containment recommendations.</p>
<p>You also do it with random GenPOP screening.</p>
<p>You also do it with medicine being distributed.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a nuanced answer to that where the policy should be a little bit more directed.</p>
<p>It should be a little bit more involved in terms of treatment, testing, and containment</p>
<p>strategy, and it doesn&rsquo;t need to be so binary.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be everybody stay at home.</p>
<p>If we get to the point where a population has very few people have had it, then more</p>
<p>people should stay home so it doesn&rsquo;t spread, and then if more people have it, so if 50%</p>
<p>of young people in San Francisco have it already, we&rsquo;ve got herd immunity, then maybe</p>
<p>we can start saying, hey, if you&rsquo;re over 65, you can go out, but just stay at a restaurant</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Once you hit like 50% to 60% of the population having antibodies to a particular virus, like</p>
<p>a flu, for example, you&rsquo;ll see that R-naught number drop well below one, and then basically</p>
<p>Explain R-naught to everybody again, just so we can get it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically like the viral coefficient.</p>
<p>For every one person that&rsquo;s infected, R-naught tells you how many other people will get infected</p>
<p>after them, and so if it&rsquo;s 2.5, which is what some estimates say it is for coronavirus right</p>
<p>now, then for every one person that gets infected, roughly two and a half people get infected,</p>
<p>and that number goes down as more people get infected, because as more people get infected,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less people to infect, and the rate at which you can then infect other people</p>
<p>also drops, so your R-naught collapses, and so at a certain point, you have this kind</p>
<p>of basis for saying, hey, guys, let&rsquo;s, okay, now I got to step off, sorry, guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, no problem.</p>
<p>Do your thing.</p>
<p>So Shama, what David was just explaining.</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, what you are seeing in real time as we&rsquo;re doing this is literally like, I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>seen this before.</p>
<p>We should probably explain what is going on.</p>
<p>So what is going on in the background is the markets are just completely torn.</p>
<p>Now, why are the markets important?</p>
<p>Many people aren&rsquo;t invested at all in the stock market.</p>
<p>I get it, but it is where liquidity and capital markets function, and derived out of those</p>
<p>capital markets is the money that then hits startups.</p>
<p>It hits the banks, which then lend to small businesses.</p>
<p>It is the functional machine, the undergirding of the U.S. and the world economy, and we</p>
<p>are in a moment that I have really not seen since 08, where there are seizures in this</p>
<p>market in extremely violent ways.</p>
<p>And so when I had to jump off the phone, it was me trying to do my part to kind of help,</p>
<p>but also trying to make sure that we maintain full liquidity in times like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Jason, on the assumption that, you know, Friedberg may or may not come back, I mean, what dramatic</p>
<p>podcasting we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I mean, people also have their kids at home, so, you know, I might have to</p>
<p>jump out and take care of the twins or my 10-year-old.</p>
<p>So it is definitely having a psychological impact on everybody being home.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been home for over two weeks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been home for a week.</p>
<p>I went out once to do a podcast at my office with just one person there.</p>
<p>What I wanted to do was start at sort of the 10-foot level, and I&rsquo;d like to build up</p>
<p>to the 100,000-foot level.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;ll be a good way of talking about what we teased and talked about a little</p>
<p>bit in episode zero, which is sort of these second and third order dynamics.</p>
<p>Before we go to that, let me just, I want to wrap up with Dave was saying about what</p>
<p>the change in policy should or could be.</p>
<p>So right now, we&rsquo;re having, you know, this basically quarantine.</p>
<p>In some cases, it&rsquo;s a hard quarantine.</p>
<p>In some cases, a little bit softer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a recommendation.</p>
<p>And, you know, people are being told to, you know, stay at home.</p>
<p>Should this change?</p>
<p>And under what conditions do we start going back to normalcy?</p>
<p>Because I think that&rsquo;s what people want to know is when is this going to end and under</p>
<p>what circumstances?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just talking about, you know, staying home.</p>
<p>Well, look, if it were me, I think what we would do is adopt some of the mitigation</p>
<p>strategies of China and Korea and Singapore.</p>
<p>All of these countries have kind of showed us a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>Now, we have to decide that a short-term suspension of typical civil liberties</p>
<p>is worth the trade-off.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not worth it under the normal course under any imaginable way.</p>
<p>But if we had to trade off some of those civil liberties in the short course so that we could</p>
<p>get back to normalcy, I think most of us at this point and definitely all of us after</p>
<p>another week or two of home isolation will do it.</p>
<p>And what I think it would entail is setting up zones that we would understand to be uninfected.</p>
<p>And what that means are people that don&rsquo;t have it or people that have antibodies and</p>
<p>eventually allowing those zones to reopen so that we can actually have some amount of</p>
<p>economic activity.</p>
<p>And what that will require is massive testing of the entire population.</p>
<p>Testing, testing, testing.</p>
<p>I mean, there should be lines and lines and lines.</p>
<p>It should be, you know, how we would have and we know, by the way, how to mobilize this.</p>
<p>It is no different than when we would go to vote.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, you know, we could all be told based on birth year, right?</p>
<p>Everybody go based on birth year to your local voting facility.</p>
<p>There are phlebotomists there.</p>
<p>They can run these LFIAs.</p>
<p>And they can allow you to be in a safe zone or not a safe zone.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re found to be an asymptomatic carrier, then you can self-quarantine and socially</p>
<p>distance.</p>
<p>And we can really, you know, nip this thing in the bud in a, you know, four, five, six</p>
<p>week timeframe.</p>
<p>And because these tests are available at such large scale, and because these tests are so</p>
<p>insignificantly cheap, if it were up to me, I would mobilize the military and the National</p>
<p>Guard.</p>
<p>I would mobilize our voting infrastructure.</p>
<p>I mean, another way to do this would be why don&rsquo;t we just have the National Guard or doctors</p>
<p>or whatever, just go to everybody&rsquo;s mailbox, put in the kits, and then say, you know, we</p>
<p>have your kit in here on this date, and we&rsquo;ll go pick up the kits.</p>
<p>The problem with these LFIAs is that the amount of blood that you need, you cannot draw by</p>
<p>yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a thing.</p>
<p>But what about the swab stuff?</p>
<p>I mean, if we just did the swab testing, we just said, hey, we&rsquo;re coming by your house.</p>
<p>The swab is a PCR test that&rsquo;s looking for RNA.</p>
<p>And the problem with that is that it&rsquo;s effective in a window.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uncomfortable to administer, and it has to be done right away for those that are in</p>
<p>the process of viral shedding.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>If you are not in the process of viral shedding, then that PCR test is effectively ineffective.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m advocating for is move past the PCR testing.</p>
<p>That should be done in an acute situation.</p>
<p>If you come into a hospital where you&rsquo;re exhibiting symptoms.</p>
<p>The more important thing right now is to find people that don&rsquo;t have it, or people who are</p>
<p>asymptomatically spreading, or those people that are immune.</p>
<p>Because if we can rebaseline the denominator, as Friedberg said, we may find some good</p>
<p>news in that it&rsquo;s very much like the flu in terms of numerical distribution, in which</p>
<p>case we can make some policy changes and reestablish economic activity.</p>
<p>If it turns out that it&rsquo;s not, at least we know that too.</p>
<p>But right now, we&rsquo;re in the worst place, which is that we are in a situation of isolation</p>
<p>and confinement in the absence of data.</p>
<p>And this is, I think, what&rsquo;s so infuriating to folks is that we, you know, it&rsquo;s like Winston</p>
<p>Churchill said, America will do the right thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;ll try everything else first.</p>
<p>And I think that we are clearly on that path to trying everything until we do the right thing.</p>
<p>Everything okay, Friedberg?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s political.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s political poker as the reason why.</p>
<p>Friedberg, everything okay?</p>
<p>Just market trades.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, literally, you&rsquo;re trying to cover stuff and just.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great time to tax harvest losses, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got companies that you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>religious about that you would love to own for a long time, and you&rsquo;re underwater on them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great time to sell them, take the loss, harvest it, and then buying back in the next 30</p>
<p>days.</p>
<p>So, David, I have a list of eight things.</p>
<p>And what I told Jason is I wanted to start at the 10-foot level and end at the 100,000-foot</p>
<p>level, okay?</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;m going to tee up the first question for both of you guys.</p>
<p>And I have a view, but I&rsquo;ll save it to the end.</p>
<p>So, question number one of these eight lists of interesting things to talk about,</p>
<p>which may be relevant for the folks listening.</p>
<p>What does this mean for startups?</p>
<p>And what should you do if you are a unprofitable&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I mean, by definition, these companies are default dead.</p>
<p>What do you do if you&rsquo;re a startup CEO today?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dealing with it like with about a dozen companies a day who are in this very acute</p>
<p>situation.</p>
<p>You have to look at the instrument panel and then try to, like a pilot, I use the analogy,</p>
<p>understand exactly how much altitude you have, where the nearest airport is, how much fuel</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got on board.</p>
<p>So, I literally told folks, listen, if you can close this money, because a lot of people</p>
<p>were in the middle of doing deals, close it immediately.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a deal on the table, take the money.</p>
<p>And some people do, but most people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m already seeing people retrading deal terms based and backing out.</p>
<p>So, I had one person back out of a deal on thesyndicate.com.</p>
<p>An angel investor said, because of market conditions, I&rsquo;m backing out.</p>
<p>And they had made the commitment, they&rsquo;re backing out.</p>
<p>So, you can see commitments broken.</p>
<p>So, assume it&rsquo;s going to&hellip;</p>
<p>That no money is going to get raised for the next three or six months at a minimum.</p>
<p>And then you have to ask yourself, well, how do I keep this company alive?</p>
<p>I have people who are founders taking 80% salary cuts and then giving their staff 50%</p>
<p>salary cuts.</p>
<p>And then that takes their six months of runway, makes it nine.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>You have to just make the cuts.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve chosen to be the founder of the company, that&rsquo;s your job is to get everybody</p>
<p>to safety.</p>
<p>And better to have four out of five or three out of five employees lose their job and the</p>
<p>company be alive to come back and maybe get some stimulus later than to have the company</p>
<p>go out of business, because you wouldn&rsquo;t make the cuts.</p>
<p>So, you got to just take the medicine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really with first time entrepreneurs, they don&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
<p>And if they have&hellip;</p>
<p>Every business is different.</p>
<p>We have some companies that are subscription-based business or delivery-based businesses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually seeing an increase in utilization, increase of people trialing their software.</p>
<p>So, I have one company that&rsquo;s a consumer subscription.</p>
<p>They had more trials this week than ever because people have free time.</p>
<p>So, that company is going to be fine.</p>
<p>But you got to make the cuts.</p>
<p>David, I&rsquo;m not sure what your advice is or what you&rsquo;re doing in your portfolio.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, I&rsquo;m on 12 boards.</p>
<p>Four companies have been or are in the middle of term sheet or closing a deal.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s been an unfortunate timing for all this stuff.</p>
<p>What happens to those four companies?</p>
<p>Do you think they close the term sheets?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, very different things.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve got one that I hope we close on Friday.</p>
<p>We signed on last Friday, the final docs and money&rsquo;s not in the bank account yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got another one that&rsquo;s had a bunch of offers that got rescinded, but they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>signed yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just all over the place.</p>
<p>And I think one thing that&rsquo;s worth paying attention to for every company is you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>to ask yourself, firstly, the hard question of going into this and coming out of this</p>
<p>era that we&rsquo;re now entering that is a very bleak and dark era economically.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s your customer going to be?</p>
<p>And what is your customer going to be doing?</p>
<p>The customer model is changing overnight.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a company that sold software into restaurants, and restaurants are about to</p>
<p>potentially go bankrupt, or suffer absolutely loss of revenue and get debt payments restructured,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to necessarily be rushing to spend more money each month unless you</p>
<p>can help them immediately save money.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a company selling to consumers, and you&rsquo;re selling to consumers that are going</p>
<p>to lose their jobs in the next three months, or lending to consumers, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be losing their jobs in the next three months, you&rsquo;ve got to be asking yourself the question,</p>
<p>what can I be doing with my business?</p>
<p>So you got to start with your strategy question.</p>
<p>And you got to make sure that you got to think about where your customer is going to be,</p>
<p>and how you can adjust your strategy as a result.</p>
<p>The second thing I&rsquo;d say is, and I sent out a note to my CEOs, and I was like, guys, you</p>
<p>got to cut your burn, and then you got to cut your burn, and then you got to cut your</p>
<p>burn.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got burned, you got to do everything you can to give yourself the greatest chance</p>
<p>of survival.</p>
<p>And I think on the last All In podcast, Jason, you mentioned having a 36 months of cash,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ideal.</p>
<p>But if you can get your cash to get you to an 18 month runway&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, 18 is my average.</p>
<p>You should be doing everything you can to number one, kind of give yourself that breathing</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>Even if that means trading milestones, trading features, trading revenue goals, trading all</p>
<p>the things that you&rsquo;re expecting to do, survival matters more than growth right now.</p>
<p>David Sinclair, who wrote the book Lifespan and is a Harvard biochemist, has highlighted</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s basically a gene, the SIRT genes, there&rsquo;s about seven of them in humans, and</p>
<p>the SIRT genes get turned on or off.</p>
<p>And it turns out every biological organism on planet Earth has a SIRT gene.</p>
<p>The SIRT gene tells the organism or tells the cell to either grow or heal.</p>
<p>And this is a time for everyone to activate their SIRT genes and stop focusing on growth</p>
<p>and focus on healing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important to optimize your unit economics to make sure you know where your</p>
<p>customer is, to really reduce the burn, to reduce the spend, to reduce the push for growth</p>
<p>and expansion.</p>
<p>And just make sure you&rsquo;ve got a core business, that you have a customer, that you can make</p>
<p>money from that customer, that you&rsquo;ve really got unit economics right.</p>
<p>And reduce your burn and give yourself that runway and extend your life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my kind of advice.</p>
<p>Well, I think we got question one out of the way.</p>
<p>Let me give you my advice, which is building on the back of both of what you said.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to take it from a different perspective.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look inside of a VC firm.</p>
<p>VC firms have limited partners.</p>
<p>And those limited partners are the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world.</p>
<p>Family offices of well-renowned individuals, foundations, university endowments, nonprofits,</p>
<p>you name it.</p>
<p>And all of them are allowed to invest in this asset class because they themselves can prove</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re sophisticated.</p>
<p>And one way in which they do it is they have what&rsquo;s called portfolio allocation theory.</p>
<p>They construct a portfolio of every $100 they have and they say, well, I&rsquo;d like to have</p>
<p>70% of that in liquid instruments.</p>
<p>And that I&rsquo;m going to have 60% in bonds and 40% in equities.</p>
<p>And then that 30% they&rsquo;ll take and they&rsquo;ll say, I want to have a mixture of all kinds</p>
<p>of different stuff.</p>
<p>Some real estate, some hedge funds, some private equity.</p>
<p>And eventually, when all of those allocations are done, there&rsquo;s an allocation to venture.</p>
<p>Now, in the last few years, what happened is all of these folks move the dial.</p>
<p>They push the risk meter so that the allocation into venture was upwards of 7, 8, 9% of their</p>
<p>overall portfolio.</p>
<p>Now, just to remind you guys, basic theory, monetary theory would tell you when you put</p>
<p>money in into an illiquid instrument, remember venture doesn&rsquo;t return money until 13 years</p>
<p>after it&rsquo;s done and you can&rsquo;t get it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a bond where you can go and instantaneously sell it in a second.</p>
<p>You have to get returns that are much better than the market because you need to be rewarded,</p>
<p>paid back for that illiquidity.</p>
<p>Now, in the last month, what you&rsquo;ve seen are portfolios get completely turned upside down.</p>
<p>If your bonds and equities before were worth $60 or $70 of that 100, it&rsquo;s now worth $56.</p>
<p>It could be worth $40.</p>
<p>What that means is that that other $30 needs to be worth much, much less.</p>
<p>Otherwise, your portfolio model is completely upside down and all of these limited partners</p>
<p>become forced sellers as well.</p>
<p>So that can&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So what is the ‚Äì my understanding is the last time this happened in 2008, LPs kind</p>
<p>of winked to the GPs and said, listen, it would be good if there wasn&rsquo;t a capital call</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>And then GPs not wanting to piss off their LPs, the VC firms not wanting to piss off</p>
<p>the endowments as an example, said, okay, we&rsquo;re just going to not make any capital calls</p>
<p>right now while the market recovers so that your equities go up and the percentage of</p>
<p>venture goes back down.</p>
<p>Is that the likely scenario is LPs?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse than that because right now, these foundations and sovereign wealth funds are</p>
<p>trying to just stay above water.</p>
<p>And as we get to the 10,000 and 100,000 foot view, I&rsquo;ll give you the picture of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening in their offices.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s important because it is what makes sure we come out of this reasonably</p>
<p>well, which is a properly functioning capital market.</p>
<p>And right now, it is the most precarious that I have seen in 20 years.</p>
<p>So basically, these LPs are going to have to portfolio rebalance and they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to force venture capitalists to mark down their books.</p>
<p>So wait, VCs are just going to make that decision to say, hey, my investment in Airbnb, Slack,</p>
<p>or Uber is worth X now.</p>
<p>I mean, when they were private companies.</p>
<p>Not Slack and not Uber because they&rsquo;re public.</p>
<p>But previously private, yeah.</p>
<p>But Airbnb, can it be marked at $30 or $40 billion?</p>
<p>The auditors will probably say no.</p>
<p>The LPs will say that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The GPs will want to because it&rsquo;ll allow them to maintain their IRRs, their rates of return.</p>
<p>And so, what you&rsquo;re going to have is when these markdowns are forced to happen, which</p>
<p>will take another six months, venture capitalists returns will look terrible.</p>
<p>And so, their propensity to be able to add bad dollars after good, quote unquote, to defend</p>
<p>every company is going to go to zero.</p>
<p>And as you said, Jason, there&rsquo;s going to be a pall on activity.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t think 18 months is sufficient.</p>
<p>I think you need at least 36 months.</p>
<p>Double.</p>
<p>You need to have three years of capital in the bank.</p>
<p>The worst thing that&rsquo;ll happen if you have 36 months is you think to yourself, wow, I</p>
<p>was really conservative.</p>
<p>The best thing that happens with 36 months is you survive.</p>
<p>The distribution of outcomes would tell you there is zero point in taking the risk if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>And this is why, unfortunately, it&rsquo;s going to be a very difficult process of recalibrating</p>
<p>all of this stuff.</p>
<p>So, for folks that are in these startups, we&rsquo;re going to have to go through an unfortunate</p>
<p>period of pain.</p>
<p>And as Buffett said, rule number one of our business is to not go out of business.</p>
<p>Rule number two is not to forget rule number one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s well said.</p>
<p>And is there any chance while we&rsquo;re sort of at this, you know, street level on the front</p>
<p>lines, is there any chance that we contain this very quickly, let&rsquo;s say under 60 days,</p>
<p>and that it looks like this virus mitigation through the various drugs we talked about</p>
<p>actually starts to work?</p>
<p>If that happens in the next 60 days, what will happen to the markets?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>But Trump says there&rsquo;s a chance it could come roaring back.</p>
<p>What are the chances of a roar back?</p>
<p>It cannot come roaring back.</p>
<p>So, let me explain to you what&rsquo;s happening right now in the capital markets.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s take a step back and first look at what the Fed has announced over the last</p>
<p>couple of days.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why the Federal Reserve is important.</p>
<p>So, the Fed basically acts as a market making and liquidity function in what&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>overnight repo market.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s an obscure market for the average individual on Main Street.</p>
<p>But let me roughly explain why it exists.</p>
<p>And at the end of it, you&rsquo;re probably going to have the same reaction as me, which is</p>
<p>what the fuck, fucking, what the fucking fuck?</p>
<p>Okay, but I&rsquo;ll explain it in English first.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re an LP, a limited partner, and you give a hedge fund a dollar.</p>
<p>And very much like last episode, how I explained why hedge funds run levered, the hedge fund</p>
<p>says, well, if I take this dollar, you know, the bank will give me some amount of leverage</p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>But it would be much better if I was able to basically, you know, give them an instrument</p>
<p>like a bond or some sort of short term commercial paper.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll give me more because they&rsquo;ll believe in the quality of the instrument.</p>
<p>Okay, so they go in the repo market, and they basically do a transaction overnight where</p>
<p>they basically, you know, buy some short term commercial paper, they use it as collateral,</p>
<p>and then they lever it up, and then they go put it in the market.</p>
<p>That entire dynamic works as long as the repo function works every day.</p>
<p>Every night, you kind of go and you clean up your balance sheet, you look at how much</p>
<p>leverage you have, you look at your leverage ratio, you make sure that you have enough</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>And you go and you refinance your short term paper that keeps, you know, JP Morgan, Goldman</p>
<p>Sachs, Morgan Stanley lending to you.</p>
<p>But if that market seizes, when the repo market seizes, and there&rsquo;s no way for you to either</p>
<p>buy or sell commercial paper, buy or sell short term money market instruments.</p>
<p>And on the other side, the markets are whipsawing up and down.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re being margin called, not being margin called, being margin called, not being</p>
<p>margin called, the markets start to really seize and capitulate, and everybody is just</p>
<p>losing enormous amounts of money.</p>
<p>And what I mean by everybody, it&rsquo;s everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hedge funds, it&rsquo;s sovereign wealth funds, it&rsquo;s foundations, it&rsquo;s central banks, everybody</p>
<p>is losing money.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t figure out how to bring some calm into the financial markets, it will leave</p>
<p>all of these limited partners and all these other people with not just a lack of liquidity</p>
<p>and a lot less money than they had before, but this psychological pain of remembering</p>
<p>what they just went through.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll prolong what we have to deal with to get out of it, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, this is why I think it&rsquo;s really important to understand that if we can nip</p>
<p>the, you know, stage zero of this problem, which is the disease itself in the bud, and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean by curing it, and I don&rsquo;t mean with a vaccine, I mean by testing and data.</p>
<p>If we can understand and bound it, then everybody&rsquo;s psychology can move to fixing</p>
<p>the capital markets.</p>
<p>And right now, we need it to be fixed.</p>
<p>How close do you think we are to having that mass testing done?</p>
<p>And then I think we all think we&rsquo;re going to have a low mortality rate.</p>
<p>And then go back to normalcy.</p>
<p>Is that something that&rsquo;s happening in 10 days, 30 days or 60 days?</p>
<p>If you had to pick a number, the march back to normality.</p>
<p>David, I don&rsquo;t see any action to get the testing done that needs to get done right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>My mom got tested yesterday.</p>
<p>It seems like there are more tests out there this week than oh, yeah, Stanford opened up</p>
<p>the test.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely PCR testing available now.</p>
<p>And you can probably get your results in three to four days on average, although some labs</p>
<p>are super backed up.</p>
<p>Yeah, my mom said she&rsquo;s going to take three days or four days.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the stuff that we&rsquo;re talking about, which is the general population testing, I&rsquo;ll keep</p>
<p>saying it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so critical that we do this to figure out how many people have already been infected</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that data that we don&rsquo;t even have a plan for.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not on the radar.</p>
<p>The task force in DC is focused right now on increasing the throughput and the availability</p>
<p>of PCR or just in time.</p>
<p>You know, PCR testing, blood testing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s yeah, it&rsquo;s all blood testing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of like, like, let me explain that the PCR test involved the RT</p>
<p>PCR test involves taking blood.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s basically six steps that you have to go through with it in a lab.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s done on like three different machines.</p>
<p>And the actual cycle takes 30 to 60 minutes at 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>So by the time you have that backlog, and you can multiplex it, but meaning you can</p>
<p>do multiple at the same time, and you can kind of do different things.</p>
<p>But generally, these machines are not highly automated.</p>
<p>There are new machines that are allowing us to automate more of these steps and making</p>
<p>them go a little bit faster and do more multiplexing.</p>
<p>But it is still a multi step cycle to take the blood and turn it into a test result.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve amplified the viral RNA and tried to measure its content.</p>
<p>And so this takes this takes some time.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a chemistry lab that&rsquo;s doing this work.</p>
<p>So until we have a point of care solution, which is like a test strip or something else,</p>
<p>and these are technically possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re not FDA approved.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re not getting made and distributed here.</p>
<p>Whereas China and Korea and Italy are using them out of and they&rsquo;re made in factories in China,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re not tested and approved in the normal way.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the plan to have these untested tests online this week?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, a bunch of people are buying them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it so I guess the question is, when do you think we will have these, you know,</p>
<p>the general population taking tests, and we get like a large scale testing like South Korea did?</p>
<p>I do all agree, that&rsquo;s the part of the solution.</p>
<p>When does that happen?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re not parallel pathing it, we&rsquo;ve put all of our resources into</p>
<p>increasing the availability and throughput of the RT PCR tests for acute infection cases.</p>
<p>And as a result, we have everyone focused on this, there was some</p>
<p>lab work and some research departments, I won&rsquo;t name them,</p>
<p>that were working on doing this general population testing, but they got yanked into the</p>
<p>getting the RT PCR scaled up, because oh my god, we&rsquo;re behind the curve, we got to fix this thing.</p>
<p>So we got to get over this first hump.</p>
<p>I think once we get over this first hump, then you&rsquo;re going to see people distribute and work on this.</p>
<p>And I think getting over the first hump is happening in the next call it seven to 10 days.</p>
<p>And so then it&rsquo;s probably another 30 to 45 days before we get these tests</p>
<p>for general population testing more broadly distributed.</p>
<p>So call it 45 days out.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we do this at the same time?</p>
<p>I mean, why can&rsquo;t we parallel this?</p>
<p>This makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>And we have so many scientists and so many entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>that are banging their head on the wall, asking this question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done so many phone calls over the last few days of people being like,</p>
<p>what can we do?</p>
<p>How can we get these things made?</p>
<p>Where can we go?</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s just like, flustered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really frustrating.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of individuals that we&rsquo;re trying to kind of collect together to do this work.</p>
<p>Some folks are calling China today, we&rsquo;re trying to see if we can get big bulk orders out of China,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just going to pay for it ourselves.</p>
<p>And then try and get some research labs to run the, you know,</p>
<p>universities around the country to run the experiments for us,</p>
<p>using these untested, unproven, you know, not FDA approved test kits.</p>
<p>Have you run one of these on yourself yet?</p>
<p>One of these unproven tests yet?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I actually, a friend of ours, I did one with video on with him this morning.</p>
<p>And so, you know, someone that we own.</p>
<p>A mutual friend of ours.</p>
<p>A mutual friend of ours.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, and then I know lots of people that have them and have used them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen them and I&rsquo;ve gone through, like, you know, I bought a bunch of them.</p>
<p>They arrive tomorrow.</p>
<p>Um, and so I see, uh, you know, we&rsquo;ve seen, we know how these things work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually from a reliable source.</p>
<p>You know, these are not, uh, we, no, no, one&rsquo;s actually done the testing to prove</p>
<p>the specificity and sensitivity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re relying on a third party, you know, test.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t really know, but.</p>
<p>I keep hearing they&rsquo;re uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I keep hearing they&rsquo;re uncomfortable.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s uncomfortable with them?</p>
<p>They stick it very far up your nose.</p>
<p>Is that what people are referring to?</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re referring to the RT-PCR test.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re trying to do there is you&rsquo;re trying to get a sample of living virus on a swab.</p>
<p>And the best place to get that living virus for this particular virus is in your nose or in your,</p>
<p>the back of your throat.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re taking a long Q-tip and they&rsquo;re sticking it up your nose and they&rsquo;re sticking</p>
<p>it in the back of your throat.</p>
<p>Then they put it in a little solution that will keep the viral RNA alive.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re shipping to the lab.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what then gets.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s uncomfortable to have it that far up your nose is what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people keep saying it&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had more uncomfortable things up my nose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a Q-tip in your nose.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Q-tip way up in your nose.</p>
<p>Way up in your nose.</p>
<p>So we actually think that mass testing is a 30 to 60 day.</p>
<p>No, I think mass testing, if in the worst case is 30 to 60 days of what I&rsquo;m imploring</p>
<p>anybody with any influence is we need to get this starting to happen in the next two to three weeks.</p>
<p>It needs to start happening in the next two to three weeks.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is where I would say there are a lot of other people other than</p>
<p>David, myself, you, Jason, the people on our group chat, buying tests for the mass population.</p>
<p>You know, I just want to say something here, which is it is incredible to see guys like Jack Ma</p>
<p>step up and, you know, do what he can to send stuff here.</p>
<p>But I would say that thus far, there&rsquo;s largely been an inverse correlation of</p>
<p>contribution and wealth during all of this.</p>
<p>And folks that are in a position to help, I think, need to be more vocal.</p>
<p>You know, we all can&rsquo;t just participate when the times are good.</p>
<p>Take advantage of the bully pulpit when the times are good.</p>
<p>And then when times are complicated, disappear and become anonymous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part in why I think you and I decided to just do these as often as we can.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because at least we can think through the problem so that at least people can hear</p>
<p>our voices and understand that we are thinking through as much as possible what to do.</p>
<p>I am literally calling folks in Wall Street all the time because what little I can do to</p>
<p>assure them or be a market participant right now to maintain liquidity, I need to do.</p>
<p>Because in the absence of that participation, we&rsquo;re going to just create more and more havoc.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important for other people who are in a position either monetarily or</p>
<p>through influence or both to be out there right now doing something.</p>
<p>You know, they should call Friedberg right now.</p>
<p>They should give Friedberg $100 million.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go to China.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get the test.</p>
<p>And we can do our own broad-based population study right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would jump on that.</p>
<p>Right now, looking at the statistics as of today, obviously, the total cases in China</p>
<p>hit 80,000 with 3,237 deaths.</p>
<p>They had only 11 new deaths yesterday.</p>
<p>And Italy, 35,000 total cases, 4,200 new cases.</p>
<p>And they added 475 deaths yesterday with a total death count of 2,978.</p>
<p>So that is just stunning what&rsquo;s happening in Italy.</p>
<p>And it seems&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the trend line is it&rsquo;s getting worse or not.</p>
<p>But Italy&rsquo;s just overwhelmed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a horrific and awful situation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re completely out of beds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re triaging elderly people and letting them die in the hall so that younger people</p>
<p>who have a higher chance of surviving can actually get oxygen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just awful.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re having 3,500 new cases or they&rsquo;re at 3,500.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re over 3,000 cases, but added yesterday.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s really&hellip;</p>
<p>It is flattening.</p>
<p>But who knows if that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re just overwhelmed and they can&rsquo;t do the testing.</p>
<p>But the deaths are something that seems to have gone down in the last three days.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at different time series.</p>
<p>The number of people that died yesterday are, in fact, the number of people that died yesterday.</p>
<p>The number of people that tested positive yesterday doesn&rsquo;t tell you as much because</p>
<p>the test results may be four days delayed and they may be 10 days into their symptoms</p>
<p>by the time they get tested and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So the testing data significantly lags the infected population count</p>
<p>likely and may not represent much of anything, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very&hellip;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also hard to know what the average fatality timeline looks like.</p>
<p>There are published reports now out of China and Korea that start to try and specify this</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>But we are looking at different time series when we try and compare these things.</p>
<p>And so everyone be cognizant of that as you look at these numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not simple apples and apples.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move to a slightly second and third order, Jason.</p>
<p>I think if we stay in the disease, it&rsquo;s just going to be a fucking mental quagmire.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to jump out the window.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about something that Mark Cuban said, which I really agree with, which is</p>
<p>that if we&rsquo;re going to do bailouts, they can&rsquo;t come where we also do things like allowing</p>
<p>these companies to do buybacks where CEO pay isn&rsquo;t curtailed.</p>
<p>It turns out that the airline industry, which looks like it&rsquo;s going to be first in line</p>
<p>for bailout, spent $0.96 of every single dollar of free cash that they had on buying back</p>
<p>stock, which is only used to drive up earnings per share, which is only relevant for CEO</p>
<p>pay.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t have the cash buffer.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the 36 months of operating window that everybody should have.</p>
<p>They blew it on trying to have their earnings per share go up by reducing the number of</p>
<p>shares in existence.</p>
<p>Shares.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Just so people understand.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t earnings per share, you take earnings, you divide it by the number of shares.</p>
<p>So if earnings can&rsquo;t go up, just divide by the number of shares and earnings per share</p>
<p>goes up.</p>
<p>Lower the number of shares.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you had a million dollars in earnings, a million shares, it was a dollar per, you</p>
<p>get rid of half the shares, it now goes up.</p>
<p>And so now you have CEO pay go through the roof, but these companies are not any more</p>
<p>resilient than they were before.</p>
<p>And so now they&rsquo;re in line for a bailout.</p>
<p>And I think the large caucus of people across both aisles are very clear that these things</p>
<p>need to be wipeouts of the equity versus bailouts where folks who took advantage of the financial</p>
<p>system here continue to get rewarded.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about that?</p>
<p>Totally agree.</p>
<p>If you wipe out the equity, though, just pausing for a second and taking the other side of</p>
<p>the argument, I&rsquo;m not saying this is the side I would take.</p>
<p>If you wipe out the equity, would not some of the people who would hit that pain are</p>
<p>shareholders from a retirement home or a retirement plan?</p>
<p>Like CalPERS maybe owns-</p>
<p>Pension funds, yeah.</p>
<p>Pension funds, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it does seem like if you wipe out the equity, you could have some unintended consequences</p>
<p>with equity holders.</p>
<p>But I think what the other side of the argument is, we&rsquo;re going to have to have there be</p>
<p>repercussions for people running companies so close and recklessly to the cliff.</p>
<p>And there has to be some pain, not reward for doing that.</p>
<p>And a bailout is a reward for operating irresponsibly.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying, Shamath?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that actually you have to wipe out the equity.</p>
<p>And I think the reason why wiping out the equity is important is that it overwhelmingly</p>
<p>does not punish the retiree who owns Boeing stock in their 401k.</p>
<p>Boeing has not been held by retirees in their 401ks for years as a cohort of impactful investors.</p>
<p>Massive, large institutional pools of money own these companies.</p>
<p>These are the balance sheets of governments.</p>
<p>These are the balance sheets of foundations.</p>
<p>These are the balance sheets of a very few, very, very wealthy people.</p>
<p>And the reality is that for the broad-based population, for the 350-odd million Americans</p>
<p>in the United States, how many of them do you think are really active market participants,</p>
<p>meaning for every dollar of value creation or destruction, how much do they actually see?</p>
<p>I would guess it&rsquo;s less than 10%, meaning 90 cents of every dollar are nameless,</p>
<p>faceless organizations in a financial infrastructure.</p>
<p>I think the lesson we have to tell and the place we have to move to is one of</p>
<p>compassionate capitalism, which is that we have been so hell-bent on the use of leverage,</p>
<p>on the use of these financial gimmicks, on the use of accounting tricks</p>
<p>to enrich a few at the sake of the many.</p>
<p>And this is the right time where you should nationalize some of these businesses.</p>
<p>And when they eventually do get taken back out and floated publicly, all of those proceeds</p>
<p>should go back to the United States Treasury, who should then use it to reinforce social</p>
<p>security and Medicare and everything else.</p>
<p>Because we are going to run a multi, multi-trillion dollar budget deficit to get out of this.</p>
<p>And to just give people some context here, the US national debt is at $23 trillion,</p>
<p>which is $72,000 per citizen and $189,000 for each citizen who pays taxes.</p>
<p>And we run our spending, our budget deficit is a trillion dollars a year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about here, I think, a $2 to $3 trillion stimulus package,</p>
<p>which will increase the national debt load by only 10%.</p>
<p>So, it does seem like we can manage that.</p>
<p>But boy, was this a strategic mistake for us to run up the debt during good times, was it not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even simpler than this.</p>
<p>And I hate to say this so bluntly, but the Eurozone is going to collapse.</p>
<p>Japan is finished.</p>
<p>So, there are two economies that matter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s China and the United States as of today.</p>
<p>And the great thing about that is in a set of two, there&rsquo;s only one instrument of safety,</p>
<p>which is the United States dollar.</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>In that world, the United States has exceptional leverage, exceptional, exceptional leverage.</p>
<p>It is and it has always been the beacon, the light on the hill, etc.</p>
<p>Now, in a moment like this, the United States has the most ability</p>
<p>to reset how we think about things.</p>
<p>It could run $5 trillion deficits tomorrow.</p>
<p>It could run $10 trillion deficits because it is still the backstop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not advocating for that.</p>
<p>But this is where I think you need bold, decisive action and not piecemeal strategies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a trillion dollars is enough.</p>
<p>I really think that if you think about what the Eurozone will have to do and what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen to the US dollar, we should be basically saying right off the bat at a minimum, anyone</p>
<p>who makes less than, you know, pick your number, a million dollars a year, every man, woman and</p>
<p>child, every or every 18-year-old American man and woman should immediately get $5,000.</p>
<p>Forget $1,000, $2,000, $5,000.</p>
<p>And next month, if we&rsquo;re still out of business, $5,000.</p>
<p>And all of that does is just it&rsquo;s a trillion dollars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s $2 trillion over two months.</p>
<p>And then you add another trillion dollars and all this, you know, small business loans</p>
<p>and all the other things, that&rsquo;s $3 trillion.</p>
<p>That you can deal with because we&rsquo;re the United States.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really important to keep it in mind.</p>
<p>I know that sounds crazy.</p>
<p>Well, I mean‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t think, oh, you know, blah, blah, blah, you know, budgets and deficits,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Because everybody else is just as fucked if not more fucked.</p>
<p>Well, let me give you another perspective.</p>
<p>The GDP of the United States is $20 trillion roughly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume the whole economy shuts down.</p>
<p>Every month that we&rsquo;re shut down costs us $1.5 trillion.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re going to have the country shut down for, say, three months,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re losing $4.5 trillion right there.</p>
<p>The problem is economic growth in the economy is actually a first order function, right?</p>
<p>So the movement of cash drives the future economy.</p>
<p>And so if we were just needing to fill that hole, you would need to come up with a couple</p>
<p>of trillion dollars and you would have the government going out and buying ice cream</p>
<p>cones and paying hair salons and paying for dog walkers and, you know, paying for construction</p>
<p>workers and paying for oil rig workers and basically employing and buying all of those</p>
<p>goods and services for that functional equivalent of a $20 trillion GDP.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it would take to just fill the hole.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re assuming no economic activity.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s going to be no economic activity.</p>
<p>Maybe let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a third less economic activity.</p>
<p>The shoe, guys, the shoe that hasn&rsquo;t dropped is this idea that everybody is at home working.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s at home working.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
<p>Okay, because as David said, companies are not, you know, self-contained units.</p>
<p>Very few are.</p>
<p>Many of them and most of them operate in a very interconnected, socially dependent way</p>
<p>with other companies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re your customers.</p>
<p>You are their customers.</p>
<p>Nobody is doing anything right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody evaluating the next great SaaS tool.</p>
<p>Guys, come on.</p>
<p>And the other issue is just leverage, Jason, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve also got to remember that a big chunk of the economy is not just about</p>
<p>meaning that there&rsquo;s debt and debt payments that need to be paid.</p>
<p>And so those income streams are now going to be absent.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a multiplier effect.</p>
<p>When revenue goes down, the economic impact is actually multiplied.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t just fill the hole.</p>
<p>So it becomes a very complicated, nonlinear kind of system that you have to try and fill</p>
<p>the holes.</p>
<p>And you got to find the places where cash is missing and it&rsquo;s not moving the fastest.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you got to throw the money in the first like these repo markets and so</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no doubt that we all agree bottom up is the way to do this.</p>
<p>So if we have 330 million Americans, if you just have the bottom half, get $1,000 a month,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s call it $160 billion a month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only over the year $2 trillion.</p>
<p>So if we just did that and gave everybody $1,000 a month, that&rsquo;s $12,000 for the bottom</p>
<p>half.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not saving that money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to use it to spend it in the market, correct?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to pay their rent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to go get dinner.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>You think that poor people who are laid off right now are going to save the money?</p>
<p>Well, if you gave me $1,000 or somebody $1,000 when they&rsquo;re in their house on the sixth week</p>
<p>of their home confinement, what do you think they&rsquo;re going to do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that we&rsquo;re in week 10 and we&rsquo;re not in self-confinement anymore.</p>
<p>We agreed in the first third of the program that we&rsquo;re going to get there in whatever</p>
<p>it is, 60 days, 90 days, and we&rsquo;ll be back at work.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;ve realized after wearing the same pair of jeans four days in a row?</p>
<p>I have too many jeans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve realized.</p>
<p>And you know what I&rsquo;ve also realized?</p>
<p>That the cotton shirts that I buy from H&amp;M are fucking perfect.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve complicated my life with all kinds of bullshit that I&rsquo;ve been buying because I</p>
<p>thought it meant something.</p>
<p>And right now it means absolutely jack shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d agree with that perspective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>When you see your entire portfolio collapse, when you see this belt tightening, it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>even amongst, and we have, listen, all three of us are lucky enough to be in the top of</p>
<p>our careers and top of our income at this point in our lives, but we all came from humble</p>
<p>beginnings as well.</p>
<p>And if the people at the top are belt tightening and saying, you know what, I don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>buy a $60 t-shirt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to buy a $16 t-shirt.</p>
<p>Boy, does that have ramifications across the entire economy.</p>
<p>And this reminds me very much of the recession.</p>
<p>They said luxury goods would never rebound.</p>
<p>And sure enough, the last 10 years, luxury rebound, luxury has rebounded massively.</p>
<p>Because it was not a psychological broad-based impact to people&rsquo;s philosophy and framing</p>
<p>of how they viewed the world.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>I thought after the economic crisis last time, people did say there would never be, people</p>
<p>specifically said there would never be luxury goods again.</p>
<p>And that it was the end of people buying that kind of shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about some prognosticating analysts.</p>
<p>You know, the analyst is only as good as their own biases.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is the average person didn&rsquo;t really have to internalize a broad-based impact</p>
<p>to their way in which they view what&rsquo;s important in their life.</p>
<p>This touches everybody.</p>
<p>And I think that there is an opportunity for us to really recalibrate what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I think conspicuous consumption is unimportant.</p>
<p>You know, helping each other is important.</p>
<p>Taking, you know, unnecessary vacations because it drives your Instagram follower feed is</p>
<p>fucking stupid.</p>
<p>Making sure that we can contribute the incremental dollar we have so that other people could</p>
<p>get tested and get back to work.</p>
<p>That seems like a better use of your money and time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>No, go ahead, David.</p>
<p>Get in there.</p>
<p>I think that there, yeah, there&rsquo;s just great perspective setting that&rsquo;s happening and is</p>
<p>going to happen broadly across the economy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been fat and happy for a long time.</p>
<p>And at least a subsegment of the population has been.</p>
<p>But we also have it really, really well, really, really good here in the United States.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a website I just recommend everyone check out and spend some time on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Dollar Street.</p>
<p>And you can go to gapminder.org slash dollar dash street and check out the website.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable and it is probably my favorite website on the Internet.</p>
<p>And Dollar Street is a project of Ola Rosling&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>Ola is the son of Hans Rosling, the great visual economist who told people stories with</p>
<p>visuals on like the world and income and population and growth and so on.</p>
<p>And she went around and she photographed families all over the world and showed how much money</p>
<p>they make each month and then showed all these common household activities and goods, brushing</p>
<p>your teeth, the oven.</p>
<p>How do you what kind of clothes you have?</p>
<p>What does your closet look like?</p>
<p>What do you sleep on?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty striking that half of the people don&rsquo;t have a toothbrush.</p>
<p>A quarter of people use mud off the floor to brush their teeth.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t have a bed on planet Earth, right?</p>
<p>Only the top 1% have a kitchen, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like these amazing statistics with photos that really help kind of illustrate</p>
<p>this point.</p>
<p>And I think that I&rsquo;m not saying that the extreme demonstration of humanity and the</p>
<p>distribution of wealth, income and prosperity and humanity is as relevant here.</p>
<p>But in all these photos, everyone&rsquo;s very happy and they live a happy life.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a great reset happen that&rsquo;s happening that&rsquo;s underway.</p>
<p>Happiness eventually finds itself when the delta goes from being negative to being positive</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>When the delta is flat or the delta is negative, people are getting into a worse condition,</p>
<p>things are bad.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to bottom out here.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to, you know, no matter what state we find ourselves in, we&rsquo;ll very</p>
<p>quickly find ourselves back in a state of happiness.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll all reset with respect to Chamath&rsquo;s point on, hey, maybe I don&rsquo;t need all these</p>
<p>genes.</p>
<p>Maybe I don&rsquo;t need all this and this and this.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s certainly like critical, you know, needs that people have.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be pretty apparent pretty quickly, you know, how the economy and people</p>
<p>are going to adjust to this new world.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s going to be an adjustment.</p>
<p>The part of this that I think is actually constructive is I do think that we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to swing the pendulum back towards nationalized economies and away from global economies.</p>
<p>Because I think this is a way that politicians all around the world, they&rsquo;ll characterize</p>
<p>it in different political language.</p>
<p>You know, some people will call it, you know, sort of like American exceptionalism if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the right.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on the left, you&rsquo;ll describe it in much more social terms.</p>
<p>But they all lead to the same outcome, which is that what we have seen is that in the push</p>
<p>to globalization, we have created too much brittle infrastructure that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And that we are not resilient enough.</p>
<p>Man, we are hyper efficient and we are just in time and all of that is great and everything</p>
<p>is super cheap.</p>
<p>But when we really need infrastructure to work, whether it&rsquo;s tests or whether it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>government or what have you, it just doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think resiliency will force us to be more nationally attuned.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;ll be the right thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll cause all governments to think about their own food supply differently, to think</p>
<p>about their own supply chains differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll demand companies to be less profitable if it means that they can withstand these</p>
<p>kinds of shocks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one thing to say that we could never have modeled, you know, sort of like this</p>
<p>two or three sigma event we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>But after the fact, it&rsquo;s no longer a two or three sigma event.</p>
<p>And governments have to now internalize this and companies have to internalize it.</p>
<p>We are not going to act the same.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, just-</p>
<p>Borders will be different.</p>
<p>Think about the iPhone and obviously medicine and respirators.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about these things over the last couple of weeks as this happens.</p>
<p>If we do have a breakdown in relations with China, if we let&rsquo;s say we stop importing stuff,</p>
<p>what would happen to Apple, the most powerful and valuable company?</p>
<p>How would they ever be able to make iPhones again in the United States?</p>
<p>Are they capable of making them?</p>
<p>No, it depends.</p>
<p>It depends on who you&rsquo;re answering it for.</p>
<p>On behalf of the U.S. customer, Apple should probably be forced to bring a lot of their</p>
<p>production capacity back into the United States.</p>
<p>They should find a diversified global supply chain so that you have multiple suppliers</p>
<p>in many countries in the world.</p>
<p>But they should rely more on America.</p>
<p>It will be less profitable, but it&rsquo;ll be okay.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s $100.</p>
<p>What I read in the estimates was an iPhone would cost 100 or 100 and change more to make</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>But if they did, they wouldn&rsquo;t have this supply chain issue.</p>
<p>They make $500, $600 per iPhone anyway.</p>
<p>Well, by the way, the real outcome is that, you know, and we were going to do this anyways</p>
<p>after this, which is I don&rsquo;t think people are lining up to buy, you know, kind of irrelevant</p>
<p>products anymore in a way where we&rsquo;re just slavish to things.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s important to ask ourselves, like, this is probably the most</p>
<p>socially impactful world event the globe has had to deal with since World War II.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably really important to talk to somebody you know.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t know, you can document and you can easily find the documents of people</p>
<p>who survived the Holocaust or lived through the bombings in London, etc.</p>
<p>Their mentality was different as a result of it.</p>
<p>It changed their behavior in very positive ways, right?</p>
<p>It was like the great advances in humanity happened after that.</p>
<p>It was refocused.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re less focused on things that are not core or critically important.</p>
<p>And Friberg, what do you think about what this is showing in the health care system</p>
<p>and the holes in the health care system?</p>
<p>The fact that we couldn&rsquo;t mobilize to deal with this after we did scenario planning about</p>
<p>this after SARS, we&rsquo;ve done scenario planning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had, you know, I sent to our group list the link of Bill Gates talking about</p>
<p>this four or five years ago and how this would be an issue.</p>
<p>I sent a couple of links to people writing about closing the wet markets in China</p>
<p>after the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, David, what you think the holes in the health care system are that need to</p>
<p>be fixed and what we can learn from this, because I think we&rsquo;re now coming into the,</p>
<p>you know, as we as we got through the virus, we got through the economic second order effects.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about positively what we&rsquo;re going to learn, because I think that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>Schmott&rsquo;s getting at, is that there&rsquo;s a personal recalibrating of what matters,</p>
<p>maybe morality, ethics, focus in our lives.</p>
<p>David, what can we learn from this on a health perspective?</p>
<p>What should we do when this ends?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no easy answer to that, right?</p>
<p>Nationalized health care systems in some countries, you could say they&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>My brother, my family lives in London.</p>
<p>I was talking to my brother yesterday.</p>
<p>And, you know, they tried to go down and get tested for a tooth infection yesterday.</p>
<p>And, like, it&rsquo;s just brutal dealing with NHS in the UK.</p>
<p>You know, people aren&rsquo;t telling great stories about NHS.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not saying, Oh, my God, it&rsquo;s the best health system.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Health care is hard.</p>
<p>People want personalized care.</p>
<p>They want a lot of attention.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only so many doctors, there&rsquo;s only so much beds.</p>
<p>When you start giving people good care, it costs a lot.</p>
<p>Solving this stuff and the R&amp;D dollars required to enter markets</p>
<p>is so, you know, so extraordinarily high,</p>
<p>you end up charging a lot for products and services on the back end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very complicated system.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no simple answer.</p>
<p>I do think that we&rsquo;re learning and realizing pretty quickly that the US</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to we&rsquo;re going to do some postmortems on this,</p>
<p>obviously, as a world as a society.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s clear is the Chinese response,</p>
<p>in part was driven by a lack of bureaucratic red tape,</p>
<p>and an ability to manifest action,</p>
<p>and an ability to produce and distribute drugs</p>
<p>and produce and distribute tests without needing approvals.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s going to change in the United States, it has to</p>
<p>be regulatory burden on health care companies on pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p>on testing and diagnostics companies is extraordinarily high.</p>
<p>But the objective in the United States has been do no harm,</p>
<p>which means don&rsquo;t let anyone die through the action.</p>
<p>But it may be that many people are dying through the inaction.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re going to maybe see a big shift in policy and allow</p>
<p>right to try laws that are going to be federalized.</p>
<p>So you know, states can make decisions about right to try laws and doctors and</p>
<p>patients can try drugs on their own discretion without having a federal</p>
<p>oversight body.</p>
<p>Perhaps the same will happen with diagnostics and testing.</p>
<p>And, you know, with respect to what the what services the government provides</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t provide, you know, I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s a lot of data on either</p>
<p>side here that nationalized health care systems do and don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard to say what the right solution is, is here, you know, and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that you want to try and take R&amp;D and put it in the government.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s a financial and a capitalistic motivation to find discover</p>
<p>molecules, get them tested and prove that they have a positive effect in human</p>
<p>health.</p>
<p>And we need to move this towards personalized medicine, which actually</p>
<p>changes the construct, and probably increases the cost of doing this about</p>
<p>10x.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already seeing this with stem cell therapies and CRISPR based gene</p>
<p>therapies, is there so much more expensive in order to get that stuff moving</p>
<p>faster, we need to remove the regulatory burden and allow companies the ability</p>
<p>to move quickly and make this stuff more affordable.</p>
<p>The more we the more barriers we put in front of companies, the harder it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be.</p>
<p>And if we try to do this with a top down approach with the government deciding</p>
<p>what to do R&amp;D on and what not to do R&amp;D on, we&rsquo;re going to be in a fucking</p>
<p>mess.</p>
<p>So those are some of my points.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say as well, I think that there has to be, you know, after the</p>
<p>great financial crisis, we, we smartened up about what the banks were allowed to</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t really spartan up about what other financial</p>
<p>participants were allowed to do.</p>
<p>And a lot of what we&rsquo;re seeing here is our excesses around leverage and credit.</p>
<p>And I think we need to fix those we need to tell companies that, you know, you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t put out certain amounts of debt, we need to be a little draconian actually</p>
<p>to reset this properly.</p>
<p>We need to tell, you know, market participants that you can&rsquo;t run 10 or 13</p>
<p>times levered, you can&rsquo;t take $100 billion and make it act like 1.3 trillion and</p>
<p>then blow a 50% hole in it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not allowed to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just sorry, but nobody should be allowed to do that.</p>
<p>Okay, so if we look now on to politics, which is the least fun to talk about in</p>
<p>many ways, but just on international relations, I think it&rsquo;s worth discussing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a bit of a debate about what we call this virus and the</p>
<p>relationship between the United States and China.</p>
<p>China went on a little bit of a propaganda campaign the last couple days</p>
<p>saying the US that the US created the virus.</p>
<p>Trump has now been trolling them actively talking about the Chinese virus.</p>
<p>I used the other day the Wuhan virus, I didn&rsquo;t realize that that people consider</p>
<p>that racist to say Wuhan virus, because we called it the Spanish flu and we</p>
<p>called it the German measles.</p>
<p>But I guess people are particularly sensitive to this topic now.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a critical issue here that I don&rsquo;t understand why we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>talking about this, but wet markets specifically trade in exotic animals.</p>
<p>These viruses are contained in certain animals like bats, which are, you know,</p>
<p>together in flocks of like thousands and the viruses.</p>
<p>And then these animals in wet markets, people don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>You can you can Google it if you&rsquo;ve got if you&rsquo;re not squeamish.</p>
<p>But essentially, in Chinese culture, as I&rsquo;ve read it in The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>and in the World Health Organization&rsquo;s advisements to cancel and to shut down</p>
<p>wet markets, then there&rsquo;s unanimous agreement on this from the health</p>
<p>officials that these have to be shut down.</p>
<p>The Chinese culture says we don&rsquo;t want to see meat in a package because we</p>
<p>believe it&rsquo;s counterfeiting, it&rsquo;s been frozen and it won&rsquo;t be as tasty and it</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t have the same nutritional properties.</p>
<p>So you must slaughter the animal in front of us, at least for some</p>
<p>significant percentage of the population there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tradition.</p>
<p>And this is where these viruses have uniformly been generated from.</p>
<p>And now we have the president and China going at each other.</p>
<p>And we have to have this very delicate conversation, I think, David, and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>curious as to your position on this, because it&rsquo;s now hitting like a racial</p>
<p>and, you know, in a in a bias against a certain culture is how this is being</p>
<p>framed by the left, which is just maddening because it&rsquo;s actually a</p>
<p>culture.</p>
<p>It is a cultural issue that has to end, just like our cultural tradition of</p>
<p>shaking hands obviously needs to end or be deprecated in some severe way.</p>
<p>So, David, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you think the outcome</p>
<p>here is on a political basis in relation to those wet markets and China</p>
<p>and US relationships.</p>
<p>Look, I think China suffered heavily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard they&rsquo;re going to shut down the wet markets.</p>
<p>But all I know is what I&rsquo;ve read on the internet.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think they&rsquo;re fucking awful and stupid.</p>
<p>They should be shut down.</p>
<p>Cultural, you know, dependence aside, there&rsquo;s another issue in China.</p>
<p>Apparently, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of the impoverished communities in China are</p>
<p>encouraged to actually grow and harvest rats.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys are aware of this, but there&rsquo;s a bamboo rat business</p>
<p>where you grow these rats inside of bamboo and then you kill them and you</p>
<p>sell them.</p>
<p>And so the poorest people in China make money growing and selling rats, rat</p>
<p>meat.</p>
<p>And the Chinese government just in the last week has told them to stop, which</p>
<p>actually is a huge effect on many millions of families who are growing</p>
<p>these rats.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an economic effect, but it&rsquo;s obvious that it&rsquo;s a terrible health</p>
<p>effect.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure that getting rid of the wet markets truly eliminates or</p>
<p>eradicates the risk of a new viral outbreak, right?</p>
<p>Like I think I mentioned to you guys on our on our text stream the other day,</p>
<p>you know, 40% of the bacteria in the oceans are killed every day by viruses.</p>
<p>This is a great stat that Jennifer Doudna uses in her book on the discovery</p>
<p>of CRISPR.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s 10 to the 28th bacteria in the oceans.</p>
<p>So half of them, they all get killed every other day, every two days by</p>
<p>viruses.</p>
<p>There are viruses everywhere.</p>
<p>They are going to emerge.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to hit us.</p>
<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t necessarily where the source of the virus is coming from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we have to have better testing and diagnostics and</p>
<p>preparedness and treatment plans and an ability to motivate and mobilize</p>
<p>ourselves to address pandemics like this in the future.</p>
<p>With respect to the relationship with China.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an economist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a trade guy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll leave that.</p>
<p>No, my thought my thought on this is that this is not a question of, you</p>
<p>know, wet markets or no wet markets.</p>
<p>I think this is a question of if you are an anchor participant of</p>
<p>globalization in the global economy, is there an expectation to have a</p>
<p>common set of behaviors, the lowest common denominator set of behaviors</p>
<p>and hygienes that everybody signs up for to be a fully fledged global</p>
<p>market participant?</p>
<p>Now, the pros of that is that maybe everybody decides to be a participant</p>
<p>and to have lax borders and, you know, free trade agreements that there</p>
<p>can be no wet markets and a whole host of other things.</p>
<p>We all agree on, you know, whether we are OK with shaking hands or maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s namaste from now on, or maybe it&rsquo;s bowing.</p>
<p>The problem with that on the other side is that all of a sudden you create</p>
<p>a monoculture that strips away the individuality and the richness of</p>
<p>every country.</p>
<p>And, you know, I kind of think that like, you know, we could have</p>
<p>attacked wet markets when HIV started to spread because it was, you know,</p>
<p>as we understand it, it was the emergence of the bushmeat and raw</p>
<p>bushmeat and the killing of monkeys that had this virus that was then</p>
<p>passed to humans, et cetera, et cetera, that started the HIV epidemic.</p>
<p>So these things have happened before and it&rsquo;s not as if we shut down,</p>
<p>you know, all of those markets in Africa.</p>
<p>They still exist in some form or fashion.</p>
<p>And as David said, there are huge economic ramifications to having</p>
<p>these cultural edicts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult, I think, for an American to demand China to do it</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not willing to step up, just like in other ways, you know,</p>
<p>countries can demand us to lower our carbon emissions and we say we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to do it.</p>
<p>So there are implications and very difficult issues all over the place.</p>
<p>But I do think in general that if we move towards a more nationalistic,</p>
<p>economic dependency, interdependency, I think that it&rsquo;s probably the right</p>
<p>thing to allow more resilience to exist and for cultural diversity to</p>
<p>continue to compound.</p>
<p>Because the world of just in time efficiency, I think we&rsquo;re learning now</p>
<p>was the wrong optimization for the world.</p>
<p>We need to optimize for resiliency.</p>
<p>And that means some amount of inefficiency.</p>
<p>It means more mom and pop shops.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean everything is Amazon Prime now and Walmart.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It means that the iPhone is a little bit more expensive, which means you</p>
<p>upgrade every other year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It means that companies like Google and Facebook and others are less</p>
<p>profitable in the short term.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also okay.</p>
<p>All of these things are okay.</p>
<p>We just need to decide.</p>
<p>And now we need to move forward.</p>
<p>When do we what&rsquo;s our best estimate of when people will be allowed to go to</p>
<p>a restaurant?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, you know, again, getting back to what the people listening to</p>
<p>this podcast probably care about most as we wrap up here in the in the second</p>
<p>hour.</p>
<p>And thank you for tuning into the all in podcast.</p>
<p>David Freeberg is with us from what&rsquo;s the name of your incubator again?</p>
<p>David, the production board, the production board.</p>
<p>Previously, metromonoclimate.com and Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital</p>
<p>Partnership.</p>
<p>When do we suspect people will be allowed to go back to work in the Bay</p>
<p>Area in New York?</p>
<p>When will people be able to go and have a meal in a restaurant?</p>
<p>Do you think this is May, June or July or August?</p>
<p>When will we be out of quarantine?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going crazy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you my optimistic and then we can give the final word to David.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my optimistic view.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dying.</p>
<p>I think that the emerging evidence will soon be hard to ignore that we have a</p>
<p>denominator problem, which means that we&rsquo;re not testing enough.</p>
<p>And that these IgG and IgM tests will come online at scale in the next two</p>
<p>weeks.</p>
<p>And that we will establish demarked zones within cities and towns to</p>
<p>green zones, if you will, where people who are either negative or who have</p>
<p>already gotten it and have tested positive for the antibodies will be</p>
<p>allowed to interact.</p>
<p>So I am telling you that it&rsquo;s within six weeks from now.</p>
<p>Six weeks from now, we&rsquo;ll be in restaurants and we may have to show our</p>
<p>papers to somebody to get in or have our foreheads tested.</p>
<p>No, no, you just have to show your test result and have your passport or</p>
<p>driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I know this sounds crazy.</p>
<p>I would much rather go to a restaurant in the next six weeks where I had to</p>
<p>show my papers, a little bit draconian, sounds a little dystopian.</p>
<p>I would much rather go back to Taishoken and have my goddamn ramen and</p>
<p>show my papers and know everybody else did and then have everybody go through</p>
<p>the, you know, a very simple temperature test on their forehead like I give to</p>
<p>my kids when they&rsquo;re sick.</p>
<p>David, you&rsquo;re taking the over or the under at six weeks for when we&rsquo;ll all be</p>
<p>at Taishoken having a ramen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking the under, I&rsquo;m taking April 7th or 8th.</p>
<p>April 7th or 8th, and we&rsquo;re recording this, I think, on the 17th or the 18th,</p>
<p>I think, and so you&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;re just going to be whatever, 20 days out.</p>
<p>I, too, am taking the under, but barely.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I think we&rsquo;re four or five weeks.</p>
<p>David, David, explain the under case just so, and we can end on that, but</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the under case because that&rsquo;s a great note to end on.</p>
<p>Yeah, so as we see the number, if you look at the UW virology website, and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve shared this with people on my Twitter account, which I started doing</p>
<p>yesterday, which is at Friedberg, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m going to stick with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I have the stomach for it like you guys do, but basically</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re showing, you know, steady caseloads of positives per day, which</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s delayed.</p>
<p>And if you look at the ICU availability, the emergency room wait time data,</p>
<p>which I think are better leading indicators of where we are in the cycle.</p>
<p>New York is about two weeks behind us.</p>
<p>New York is going to be fucked right now.</p>
<p>New York is going to be fucked for a little while, but I do think that the</p>
<p>West Coast and with some travel restrictions is going to be able to</p>
<p>reopen for business, probably around April 7th or 8th, because we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to see a dramatic decline at that point.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to see a lower fatality rate than everyone&rsquo;s predicting.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to start to have measures around washing your hands and</p>
<p>masks because you can&rsquo;t keep stay shut down for that long without literally</p>
<p>never being able to open again.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of balancing the economic need against what I think the data is</p>
<p>starting to show that hopefully we are seeing the second derivative turning</p>
<p>negative now.</p>
<p>And so we start to see a slowdown in new cases.</p>
<p>And then we see a reduction in cases.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, there&rsquo;s a huge distribution on what that model</p>
<p>can tell you.</p>
<p>But I feel really good about kind of April 7th or 8th, us getting enough</p>
<p>confidence that, okay, it&rsquo;s safe to go outside again.</p>
<p>And by the way, if we don&rsquo;t open up for fucking business, everyone&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>forever.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I get the number.</p>
<p>And most importantly, when do we feel comfortable playing cards again in</p>
<p>person?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m starting to think that I want, I know this sounds crazy, but at</p>
<p>this point, if the three of us were positive and we&rsquo;d gotten through it</p>
<p>already, I would like to know that.</p>
<p>I think the entire poker group needs to get tested.</p>
<p>And the best possible scenario is that we&rsquo;re all inoculated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not carriers anymore.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re blockers in the system.</p>
<p>And we can get back to playing cards because I am, and I&rsquo;m being a little</p>
<p>facetious here, but the chances are we might all have it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>I am going bonkers being at home.</p>
<p>I am not designed for social isolation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going crazy.</p>
<p>Timoth, do you like it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a pretty isolated person as a matter of course, anyway.</p>
<p>So other than work and, you know, my doing this or TV, I&rsquo;m always at home.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, but the one thing that I cannot live without is Monday pokers.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll really tell you why it&rsquo;s like in a moment like this, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve realized.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve realized just how much extraneous stuff I have in my life, how much I don&rsquo;t need it,</p>
<p>how much I&rsquo;ve occupied my time with things that are just not important.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really allowed me to clarify like, you know, working on the next deal, not important.</p>
<p>Thinking about my status in society, not important.</p>
<p>Thinking about what other people think of me, not important.</p>
<p>My health, important.</p>
<p>My family and their health, important.</p>
<p>And my friends, I love my friends.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re very blessed.</p>
<p>I mean, I love the both of you.</p>
<p>That group saved me in some really tough moments in my life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I hate not seeing you guys and being able to, you know, just touch and feel you once a week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that to me is brutalizing.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, this is a poker group.</p>
<p>When we define touching and feeling, we&rsquo;re talking about poker chips.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>We make man love.</p>
<p>We make man love over the poker table.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how men commune is by just shifting large amounts of money across the table.</p>
<p>I miss you guys too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going crazy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be, I don&rsquo;t think like you&rsquo;re going to see me after this said and done.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take seriously buying things.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s like, what the fuck is the point?</p>
<p>I really take seriously that we need to fix the social infrastructure of the United States</p>
<p>and in part, do what we can to help as many people as possible.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>They have the folks Chamath Friedberg, 2024.</p>
<p>Hey, Dave Friedberg.</p>
<p>Love you both.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for doing this.</p>
<p>Chamath, thanks a lot for doing this.</p>
<p>Follow at Chamath, follow at Friedberg.</p>
<p>If you want to help out the podcast.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no ads to click on because Chamath wants me to go broke on this.</p>
<p>No ads, but I will say if you write us a five-star review on iTunes, I guess that means we&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>indexed and follow Friedberg, follow at Chamath, follow at Jason.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next time.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
