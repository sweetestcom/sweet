    <p>Our card this week is Mary Beth Pixie Grismore, the Ten of Spades from Indiana.</p>
<p>In 1978, Pixie was a young newlywed excited about moving from Indiana back to her home</p>
<p>state of Iowa to be with her new husband.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when she vanished from her own home in the middle of the night, leaving behind</p>
<p>few clues and a chilling mystery that&rsquo;s been unsolved for more than four decades.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was 8 a.m. on Wednesday, February 22, 1978, and a woman who we&rsquo;ll call Eleanor had just</p>
<p>arrived at her sister Pixie&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>She was to be there bright and early along with Pixie&rsquo;s two best friends, Dottie and</p>
<p>Bev, who were all helping Pixie pack the last of her things before a moving truck got there</p>
<p>at 1030.</p>
<p>You see, Pixie was moving out of the house she shared with her ex-husband and their two</p>
<p>young sons, which was on the family&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<p>She was picking up everything and moving her and her two boys to the middle of nowhere</p>
<p>town Cordon, Iowa, some 400 miles from her tiny rural town of Marshall, Indiana, and</p>
<p>she was moving to be with her new husband, David.</p>
<p>But when Eleanor got to Pixie&rsquo;s house at eight, she saw Dottie and Bev but noticed</p>
<p>Pixie&rsquo;s car wasn&rsquo;t in the driveway.</p>
<p>Dottie and Bev said that they hadn&rsquo;t actually seen her yet either, but they were able to</p>
<p>let themselves inside because Pixie rarely locked her doors, something most of her friends</p>
<p>knew.</p>
<p>Minutes ticked by and there was still no sign of Pixie.</p>
<p>Her purse was there and the clothes that she had been wearing the day before were there,</p>
<p>but Pixie herself was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Eleanor called Pixie&rsquo;s new husband, David, in Iowa to see if he&rsquo;d heard from her, but</p>
<p>he hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The two had only been married for 12 days and Pixie had spent most of that time in Indiana</p>
<p>preparing for the move.</p>
<p>Eleanor also phoned Pixie&rsquo;s ex-husband, Robert, who lived in Marshall, but he said</p>
<p>that Pixie wasn&rsquo;t with him either.</p>
<p>Now Robert was actually the reason that Pixie was in Indiana to begin with.</p>
<p>She and Eleanor were actually from Iowa, but Pixie moved to Indiana in the early 70s when</p>
<p>she married Robert, and not long after that, Eleanor also married an Indiana man and ended</p>
<p>up living just a mile down the road from Pixie.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the two sisters were extremely close, which is why when Pixie got remarried</p>
<p>to a man who lived back in Iowa, it was kind of bittersweet for Eleanor.</p>
<p>She was sad to see Pixie leave the small Indiana town that they both called home for several</p>
<p>years, even though she was happy that her sister found love again.</p>
<p>And she knew how excited Pixie was for the move, so she was excited for her.</p>
<p>Which is why when Pixie wasn&rsquo;t home that morning, Eleanor couldn&rsquo;t shake the sinking</p>
<p>feeling in her stomach that something was terribly wrong.</p>
<p>She searched the house for more clues and noticed that it looked as if Pixie had slept</p>
<p>in her bed, so Eleanor wondered if her sister had just left to run an errand.</p>
<p>But Bev and Dottie said that they went out the night before with Pixie.</p>
<p>And she hadn&rsquo;t mentioned anything about needing to go anywhere the next morning.</p>
<p>By the time 10 a.m. rolled around, Eleanor couldn&rsquo;t explain away her fears any longer,</p>
<p>so she called the local sheriff to report Pixie missing.</p>
<p>There was no hesitation.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office filed the missing persons report right away, and deputies responded</p>
<p>to Pixie&rsquo;s farmhouse to begin an investigation.</p>
<p>Investigators poked around the house but found no evidence of anything sinister and few clues</p>
<p>pointing to what might have happened to Pixie in the early morning hours of February 22nd.</p>
<p>I mean, there were no signs of a struggle, no signs of a robbery, or any kind of break-in</p>
<p>at her house whatsoever.</p>
<p>In fact, a dispatcher for the county sheriff&rsquo;s office told the Indianapolis News a few days</p>
<p>after Pixie&rsquo;s disappearance, quote,</p>
<p>Dottie and Bev were the last ones to see Pixie, so they were questioned right away.</p>
<p>They told officers that they had a girls&rsquo; night the night before as a little going-away</p>
<p>kind of last hurrah for Pixie.</p>
<p>They had all squeezed into the front seat of Pixie&rsquo;s 1973 Ford Thunderbird because</p>
<p>the back seat was already packed to the brim full of stuff for her move, and they made</p>
<p>the 20-minute drive to the nearby town of Terre Haute, Indiana.</p>
<p>Dottie and Bev said that they went to dinner at Red Lobster and then to the movies where</p>
<p>they saw Looking for Mr. Goodbar, a crime drama starring Diane Keaton.</p>
<p>After the movie, the girls told police that they all went dancing at a bar called Bo Disco</p>
<p>where they had a great time until Pixie dropped them off at home around 1.20 a.m.</p>
<p>When they said their goodbyes, Pixie told them that she would see them in the morning</p>
<p>to finish packing.</p>
<p>And that was that.</p>
<p>Dottie and Bev said that she wasn&rsquo;t acting weird at all and genuinely seemed to have</p>
<p>every intention of seeing them both in less than seven hours.</p>
<p>So of course, their first worry was maybe she&rsquo;d gotten in a car accident on her way</p>
<p>home, but that didn&rsquo;t make any sense because her clothes that she had been wearing the</p>
<p>night before and her purse were found at the house.</p>
<p>So she had to have made it home at some point.</p>
<p>By mid-morning, Pixie&rsquo;s family and police were half-expecting for her to just walk in</p>
<p>at any moment and explain that this whole thing had been a misunderstanding, and she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>just gone to run that errand.</p>
<p>But investigators didn&rsquo;t want to leave anything to chance.</p>
<p>So right away, police pulled out all the stops.</p>
<p>They got groups together to do ground searches.</p>
<p>They used helicopters for aerial searches.</p>
<p>They even put one of their most prominent detectives on the case, who was credited with</p>
<p>solving the Hollinsburg murders, an infamous quadruple homicide in Indiana.</p>
<p>But despite their best efforts in those first few hours, they found no trace of Pixie.</p>
<p>With so little physical evidence available, law enforcement needed to try something else.</p>
<p>They needed to learn more about Pixie&rsquo;s life in hopes of tracking down leads that</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>They wanted to find any clues about why she might have left, or find anyone who might</p>
<p>have had it out for her.</p>
<p>As with a lot of cases like this, the spotlight quickly turned to the significant other, but</p>
<p>not Pixie&rsquo;s current husband, her recent ex-husband, Robert.</p>
<p>Pixie and Robert had gotten married in 1972, and the relationship probably seemed somewhat</p>
<p>normal on paper.</p>
<p>They were essentially living the American dream.</p>
<p>A big farmhouse in a cute little town, and two adorable kids.</p>
<p>But investigators quickly figured out that their marriage was far from perfect.</p>
<p>You see, there were some rumors swirling around town that Pixie hadn&rsquo;t always been faithful</p>
<p>to Robert.</p>
<p>And one such allegation involved a man that she worked with.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, Marshall was a small town.</p>
<p>It still is today, so I&rsquo;m sure police didn&rsquo;t exactly trust every rumor they heard.</p>
<p>But the clock was ticking, and they wanted to find Pixie, so they had to follow up on</p>
<p>everything, even if it was just gossip.</p>
<p>People around Marshall told police that between May and November of 1977, Pixie worked at</p>
<p>Turkey Run State Park, first as a lifeguard, and then as an attendant at the state park&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gate entrance.</p>
<p>And according to a tip police received, during her employment at the park, Pixie was having</p>
<p>an affair with the park manager, who was also married.</p>
<p>According to police, this affair went on for a few months.</p>
<p>When Robert was interviewed by detectives, he said the affair had essentially become</p>
<p>public knowledge by the time he and Pixie divorced in late 1977.</p>
<p>Detectives working the case today aren&rsquo;t sure if the park manager was questioned, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not documented in the case file.</p>
<p>But what they do know is that Robert really didn&rsquo;t seem all that bitter about the whole</p>
<p>situation.</p>
<p>By all accounts, the divorce was amicable.</p>
<p>So any theory that the police may have initially had about Robert being a jealous or vengeful</p>
<p>ex-husband melted away once detectives talked with him and realized that he wanted to help</p>
<p>in any way he could.</p>
<p>I mean, he just wanted Pixie to be found safe.</p>
<p>Our reporting team talked with Pixie&rsquo;s sister for this episode, who, again, we&rsquo;re calling</p>
<p>Eleanor because she didn&rsquo;t want to use her real name.</p>
<p>And she said that she never thought Robert was involved with her sister&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>in any way.</p>
<p>She said there is no chance Robert would have ever kidnapped or hurt Pixie.</p>
<p>And by the way, Eleanor wasn&rsquo;t comfortable with being recorded for this episode because</p>
<p>of the pain and fear still surrounding her sister&rsquo;s case to this day.</p>
<p>But she still wanted everyone to know the kind of person her sister really was.</p>
<p>She said that Pixie was this super likable and popular person in the community.</p>
<p>Eleanor said that she always looked up to Pixie because people just gravitated toward</p>
<p>her and she was talented in just about every way possible.</p>
<p>She could sing and play the piano.</p>
<p>She excelled in school.</p>
<p>She was in beauty pageants.</p>
<p>She was even a finalist in the Miss Iowa pageant when she was 18.</p>
<p>But maybe the biggest thing that stood out about Pixie was her confidence.</p>
<p>Eleanor said Pixie was ambitious, a natural leader and a trailblazer in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>Pixie was involved in local politics and ended up serving as the county coordinator for the</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Birch Bayh.</p>
<p>And she even went on to become Park County&rsquo;s first Democratic chairperson when she was</p>
<p>just 24.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that confidence that drew people to her.</p>
<p>And Eleanor said she still channels her when she needs confidence herself.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just Eleanor who felt this way about Pixie.</p>
<p>Her whole family adored her.</p>
<p>So when police were struggling to find any clues about what happened to her, Pixie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>family took matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>Eleanor stayed at Pixie&rsquo;s house when police first arrived the morning of February 22nd.</p>
<p>And she wrote out a long list of the items that she knew were in Pixie&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Since Pixie&rsquo;s Thunderbird was missing, officers said it would be helpful to know what exactly</p>
<p>they were looking for.</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s list was detailed and gave officers items to be on the lookout for.</p>
<p>Things like a music box with ceramic figures that played Laura&rsquo;s theme and an antique</p>
<p>barn wood plaque with the words, Henry, how could you?</p>
<p>In those first few days, police took photos of Pixie&rsquo;s house and collected any evidence</p>
<p>they could.</p>
<p>And searches continued for her in and around Marshall.</p>
<p>But they found nothing.</p>
<p>Rumors continued to fly both about what happened and about Pixie herself.</p>
<p>But none of them stuck as actual leads.</p>
<p>According to an article in the Illinois newspaper called The Pantagraph, by the time April rolled</p>
<p>around and there was still no sign of Pixie, her parents decided to hire a psychic to help</p>
<p>find their daughter.</p>
<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t just any psychic they hired.</p>
<p>This lady was known for helping police solve criminal cases.</p>
<p>According to a 1991 Chicago Tribune article, law enforcement estimated that out of the</p>
<p>predictions she provided, approximately 80% ended up being accurate.</p>
<p>So when this psychic told Pixie&rsquo;s parents that their daughter had been shot in the head</p>
<p>and her body had been dumped somewhere near Turkey Run State Park, police wasted no time.</p>
<p>Now if you&rsquo;ve ever been to Turkey Run, it is this beautiful, heavily wooded, 1100 acre</p>
<p>park about an hour west of Indianapolis with rugged trails and canyons and a creek that</p>
<p>runs across the property.</p>
<p>That meant that there was a lot of land for police to cover.</p>
<p>So on the weekend of April 8th, 1978, about six weeks after Pixie&rsquo;s disappearance, law</p>
<p>enforcement and volunteers from the community formed a search party to scour the park.</p>
<p>Everyone searched tirelessly for hours and hours, but they eventually had to call it</p>
<p>quits when they found zero evidence to suggest that Pixie had been there at all before she</p>
<p>was killed, much less that her body had been dumped there.</p>
<p>To most people, the search probably seemed like a last ditch effort to locate Pixie because</p>
<p>detectives had exhausted the few leads that had come in.</p>
<p>And now even the supernatural tip they pursued didn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>
<p>It seemed like all hope of finding Pixie, dead or alive, was lost.</p>
<p>But then, 70 days after her disappearance, a disturbing discovery a whole state away</p>
<p>left everyone with more questions than answers.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1978, police in Whitehall, Ohio, a town barely east of Columbus, Ohio,</p>
<p>received a call from the innkeeper of a local Holiday Inn.</p>
<p>The innkeeper was calling in a parking complaint about a car in their parking lot that seemed</p>
<p>like it was abandoned.</p>
<p>When officers got there, they found a silver-blue 1973 Ford Thunderbird sitting on the east</p>
<p>side of the hotel&rsquo;s parking lot, backed into a parking space near some trees.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective John Dickey with the Whitehall Police Department, who&rsquo;s working the case</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>When they were able to look into it, it didn&rsquo;t have any license plates on it, the license</p>
<p>plates were missing, but the VIN plate was still there and all that.</p>
<p>So when they looked into it, they determined that the car had been reported stolen.</p>
<p>Officers towed the car to the Whitehall Police Department, and before inspecting it, they</p>
<p>did some more digging in the national database.</p>
<p>They realized that not only was the car reportedly stolen, but it was associated with an Indiana</p>
<p>woman who was missing.</p>
<p>The report said that Mary Beth Pixie Grismore and her Thunderbird disappeared back in February</p>
<p>in a little town in Indiana that was more than four hours west of Whitehall.</p>
<p>Now I know I&rsquo;m mentioning a lot of different towns across a few states, so to help you</p>
<p>visualize all of this, I actually put a map in the blog post for this episode on our website,</p>
<p>thedeckpodcast.com, and we&rsquo;ll link out to that in the show notes.</p>
<p>At the Whitehall Police Department, officers got the car into their evidence bay, which</p>
<p>is basically like a garage below the agency&rsquo;s offices.</p>
<p>And when they got it inside, they noticed a really bad smell.</p>
<p>So fearing the worst, police pried open the trunk, but they didn&rsquo;t immediately see anything</p>
<p>out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>They saw some blankets and some towels, a raincoat, and then a foot.</p>
<p>Police quickly removed the clutter from the trunk, revealing the decomposing body of a</p>
<p>woman.</p>
<p>She was wearing blue jeans and a knit sweater that was pulled up over her head, and around</p>
<p>her neck was a thin rope.</p>
<p>Even though she was in an advanced state of decomposition, Whitehall police could tell</p>
<p>that the body matched Pixie&rsquo;s description, mainly because of her blonde hair.</p>
<p>Whitehall detectives notified the authorities in Indiana that they&rsquo;d discovered Pixie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>missing car, and what they believed was her body.</p>
<p>And sure enough, after requesting dental records from the Indiana State Police, it was confirmed</p>
<p>that it was her.</p>
<p>Because of the state of decomposition she was in, police knew that she had likely died</p>
<p>weeks before she was found, perhaps even on the very day she had gone missing.</p>
<p>The coroner found no signs of sexual assault, and her cause of death came as no surprise,</p>
<p>strangulation by rope ligature.</p>
<p>Now that Pixie&rsquo;s case had been reclassified from missing person to homicide, the FBI got</p>
<p>involved since her abduction crossed state lines.</p>
<p>And something that stuck out to investigators right away was the clothing that she was wearing.</p>
<p>Like I said, Pixie was dressed in blue jeans and a sweater, but here&rsquo;s what puzzled investigators.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t wearing any undergarments.</p>
<p>To them, there were two possible reasons for this.</p>
<p>Our investigative team got an exclusive interview with FBI Supervisory Special Agent Ed Wheeley</p>
<p>for this episode.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s working the case today, along with Detective Dickey.</p>
<p>To me, there&rsquo;s two possibilities.</p>
<p>She was murdered and then dressed in those clothes by someone else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly a possibility.</p>
<p>She did sleep nude, okay?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s early in the morning and you hear a knock and you know the movers are coming</p>
<p>and you rapidly jump up and pull some clothes on to go answer the door, or you hear something</p>
<p>at night and you jump up and pull rapidly, those are the two possibilities of that.</p>
<p>FBI agents leaned into their biggest and really only clue, Pixie&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>It had a few items scattered about, but it certainly didn&rsquo;t look like the car of someone</p>
<p>who was moving their entire life from one state to another.</p>
<p>Specifically, some of the items that Eleanor had mentioned to them were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Things like household items, some of Pixie&rsquo;s oil paintings that she liked to sign in all</p>
<p>caps and specifically an antique wall clock that her father had repaired and penciled</p>
<p>his initials inside of.</p>
<p>After noting the items that were missing, they gathered what they could, things like</p>
<p>beer bottles, a Band-Aid and a bag containing a map, and they dusted for prints.</p>
<p>Investigators were able to pull some prints off the car&rsquo;s exterior, but Agent Wheelie</p>
<p>said that they never got any hits on those.</p>
<p>Police checked pawn shops in the Whitehall area to see if someone had tried to sell the</p>
<p>missing items, but they came up empty.</p>
<p>You can actually find a complete list of all of the items that were missing from Pixie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>car on our website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based off that original list that her sister made for police the morning that she</p>
<p>was reported missing.</p>
<p>If you somehow have one of those items, or if you know someone who does, or maybe you</p>
<p>even see one of the missing items while you&rsquo;re out thrifting, we&rsquo;re going to have a number</p>
<p>that you can call.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to put it on the website, and at the end of this episode, police are still</p>
<p>looking for those items.</p>
<p>So now that police knew all of the items that were missing, some of them valued at hundreds</p>
<p>of dollars, they began wondering if robbery was the motive.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t have enough evidence yet to settle into that assumption.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t take long for another entirely different theory to be considered.</p>
<p>A possible serial killer.</p>
<p>According to reporting by the Indianapolis Star, police almost right away noticed similarities</p>
<p>between Pixie&rsquo;s murder and another infamous unsolved case in Indiana.</p>
<p>Six months before Pixie disappeared, another Indiana resident went missing.</p>
<p>Her name was Anne Louise Harmeier.</p>
<p>Anne was a student at Indiana University traveling, and like Pixie, she was also known to be a</p>
<p>successful beauty pageant contestant.</p>
<p>On September 12th, 1977, she was driving through eastern Indiana on her way back to school</p>
<p>after spending the weekend at home when her car started acting up as she approached the</p>
<p>town of Martinsville, which is this town about an hour and a half southeast of Marshall.</p>
<p>So she pulls off to the side of the road and then just disappeared.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s body was found a month later in a cornfield a few miles away.</p>
<p>She had been sexually assaulted, and it appeared that she had been strangled with her own shoelaces,</p>
<p>according to Dennis Royalty&rsquo;s reporting for the Indianapolis Star.</p>
<p>The similarities between Anne&rsquo;s and Pixie&rsquo;s cases were ones that detectives pondered for</p>
<p>a while, but they could never get that theory to stick.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because the two women vanished from different parts of the state, or maybe</p>
<p>there was just no evidence to point to the possibility of Pixie and Anne being killed</p>
<p>by the same person.</p>
<p>But whatever the case, investigators once again went back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Though some internet sleuths may still be left to wonder if they&rsquo;re connected, since</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s case is still unsolved to this very day.</p>
<p>Detectives talked to Pixie&rsquo;s ex-husband Robert again, but he still wasn&rsquo;t even close to</p>
<p>being a suspect.</p>
<p>Not only did he seem genuinely distressed that Pixie had been murdered, but he also</p>
<p>had a solid alibi.</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s mother placed him at her house from around midnight on February 22nd until much</p>
<p>later that morning.</p>
<p>But the thing about murder investigations, especially in small towns, is that while police</p>
<p>need evidence to think of someone as a suspect, members of the community don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Robert had an alibi and wasn&rsquo;t acting suspicious at all.</p>
<p>But that small town gossip was hard to shake.</p>
<p>Even in those days before social media, the court of public opinion was a thing.</p>
<p>People thought that Robert was involved in the murder.</p>
<p>Perhaps he hired someone to kill Pixie, or maybe he&rsquo;d done it himself.</p>
<p>But Pixie&rsquo;s sister Eleanor told us that Robert was truly distraught after Pixie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body was found, and the rumors floating around town only rubbed salt in the wound.</p>
<p>And it couldn&rsquo;t have been easy for Robert and Pixie&rsquo;s two kids.</p>
<p>They were just two and three at the time of her death, but as they grew up and became</p>
<p>aware of the speculation surrounding their father, I&rsquo;m sure it was beyond hard on them.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t imagine how frustrating this was for a family that just wanted to find</p>
<p>the person responsible for taking the life of their loved one in such a sinister way.</p>
<p>Although the locals struggled to move on from Robert, police continued to pursue other leads.</p>
<p>One such lead police found interesting came from a man who was a mechanic in Rockville,</p>
<p>Indiana, which is about 10 minutes outside of Marshall.</p>
<p>He told police that he had done some work on Pixie&rsquo;s car in February, just a few days</p>
<p>before her disappearance.</p>
<p>So the mechanic says that he sees a car that&rsquo;s, so he works on her car earlier in the week,</p>
<p>and then on the morning that she disappears, he recalls seeing the car and it was being</p>
<p>driven by a male.</p>
<p>The problem was, the mechanic couldn&rsquo;t recall much about what the guy looked like.</p>
<p>He just knew for sure that it was a man driving the car, and it wasn&rsquo;t Pixie&rsquo;s husband</p>
<p>or ex-husband.</p>
<p>In June, the mechanic agreed to submit himself to something a bit unconventional in hopes</p>
<p>of getting a better description of the man.</p>
<p>He sat down with a sketch artist and allowed himself to be hypnotized.</p>
<p>While under hypnosis, he recalled to the artist what he saw, and the artist made a composite</p>
<p>sketch of this mystery man.</p>
<p>That sketch became the only description of a possible suspect that police would ever</p>
<p>get a hold of.</p>
<p>Sure, it was obtained through unconventional methods, but investigators had no other physical</p>
<p>descriptions of their killer, so they took what they could get.</p>
<p>We got a copy of this composite sketch, which you can find on our website.</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, this sketch wasn&rsquo;t ever publicized though, so it makes sense</p>
<p>that no one came forward saying they recognized the man.</p>
<p>As the weeks and months dragged by, tips slowed down, and the search for answers seemed to</p>
<p>stall.</p>
<p>But it stayed that way for about two years.</p>
<p>Pixie&rsquo;s friends and family worried that they would never know what happened or why.</p>
<p>But then, in 1980, the FBI got a tip that had everyone hopeful that they&rsquo;d finally</p>
<p>get some answers about Pixie&rsquo;s gruesome murder.</p>
<p>Two years after Pixie&rsquo;s death, her husband David, the Iowa farmer, placed a reward notice</p>
<p>in an Iowa paper offering $10,000 to anyone who could provide information leading to the</p>
<p>person or people responsible for Pixie&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>And in March of 1980, an FBI agent got a call from a man who we&rsquo;ll call Ralph.</p>
<p>And what Ralph told this FBI agent got everyone&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>He might know who killed Pixie.</p>
<p>Ralph said he had a buddy by the name of Pete Coakley.</p>
<p>Both Ralph and his friend Pete were from Columbus, Ohio, which is eight minutes west of White</p>
<p>Hall.</p>
<p>According to Ralph, Pete had left Ohio for a trip to Indiana sometime around the end</p>
<p>of 1977.</p>
<p>Pete was kind of a drifter, so it wasn&rsquo;t unusual for him to up and leave like that.</p>
<p>A few months later, sometime in the spring of 78, Ralph got a call from Pete who said</p>
<p>that he was finally back in Ohio and wanted to hang out.</p>
<p>Plus, Pete said that he had some stuff that he wanted to show him.</p>
<p>So Ralph went and picked up Pete and he was carrying two boxes packed with stuff, items</p>
<p>that clearly weren&rsquo;t things that he had packed for his trip to Indiana.</p>
<p>Like it was mostly silverware, stuff like that.</p>
<p>Now at first, police were like, okay, this sounds like a bit of a stretch, but Ralph&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story didn&rsquo;t end there.</p>
<p>He said that later that same day, Pete&rsquo;s brother came over to hang out with them and</p>
<p>they were both asking Pete where he got all the houseware.</p>
<p>And Pete was like, oh, I stole this stuff from an abandoned car at a hotel.</p>
<p>Pete even offered to show them the car.</p>
<p>So the men walked together to the Holiday Inn in White Hall.</p>
<p>When they got there, Pete showed Ralph the car parked on the east side of the lot and</p>
<p>said that&rsquo;s where he had gotten the boxes full of stuff.</p>
<p>Ralph told police that Pete also wanted them to help him steal the rims off the car&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tires.</p>
<p>But Ralph said that he caught a nasty whiff of something coming from the car.</p>
<p>So the three of them left the hotel parking lot and that was that.</p>
<p>Ralph told the FBI agent that he didn&rsquo;t really think anything more of it until he saw the</p>
<p>reward in the paper.</p>
<p>And then it all seemed to connect for him.</p>
<p>Pete had been in Indiana around the time Pixie went missing.</p>
<p>He had those boxes of random items.</p>
<p>He led him to the mysterious car.</p>
<p>It made sense to Ralph that Pete was probably connected to Pixie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And Ralph actually ended up taking investigators to the Holiday Inn parking lot to show them</p>
<p>the parking spot.</p>
<p>And surprise, it was the exact spot that Pixie&rsquo;s car was found in.</p>
<p>So by the time police got this tip from Ralph, Pete was already in prison for another murder.</p>
<p>He was serving 16 years for the 1979 killing of an Ohio woman named Patricia Height, who</p>
<p>had been stabbed 47 times.</p>
<p>Knowing this about Pete just made him look like an even more viable suspect.</p>
<p>But law enforcement didn&rsquo;t think that this was the extent of his murderous rampage.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s never been proven, Pete was suspected of killing numerous people who were</p>
<p>experiencing homelessness in Texas before he was arrested for Patricia&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>So Pete&rsquo;s history, combined with Ralph&rsquo;s statement to the FBI, led to Pete becoming</p>
<p>the prime suspect in Pixie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And adding to all this suspicion was the composite sketch that police had on hand.</p>
<p>The one that they got by hypnotizing that mechanic.</p>
<p>Now if you want to see the sketch, again, it&rsquo;s on our website.</p>
<p>Agent Wheely told us that when he saw the composite sketch and compared it with Pete&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mugshot, his jaw dropped.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was pretty shocked when I got this picture.</p>
<p>I was like, oh boy, that&rsquo;s a dead ringer.</p>
<p>You know, you got to be careful with composites, but that was pretty darn close.</p>
<p>But even though Ralph&rsquo;s statement and the composite sketch resemblance were pretty damning,</p>
<p>detectives knew that they would need more to actually charge Pete with the crime.</p>
<p>So detectives took a copy of Pete&rsquo;s mugshot and showed it to multiple people in Marshall.</p>
<p>Investigators were trying to independently determine if Pete had ever visited that part</p>
<p>of Indiana.</p>
<p>And sure enough, at least one person said they&rsquo;d seen Pete in Marshall before.</p>
<p>And this informant even knew of a buddy Pete had in the area that he&rsquo;d been staying with</p>
<p>for some time, a man by the name of Bob Vermillion.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more is that Bob Vermillion actually lived very close to the house Pixie and Robert</p>
<p>shared in Marshall, only about a quarter mile away.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Agent Wheely again.</p>
<p>Ironically, Bob Vermillion was from Columbus, Ohio too, and he moved back there, which is</p>
<p>eight miles from Whitehall.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a witness putting it, and I&rsquo;m telling you, Marshall, Indiana is off the</p>
<p>beaten path.</p>
<p>To put someone in Marshall, Indiana and Whitehall, that&rsquo;s very suspect there.</p>
<p>The evidence was stacking up against Pete, but everything was still entirely circumstantial.</p>
<p>What investigators were holding out for was a confession from Pete himself.</p>
<p>Police did get to interview Pete about Pixie&rsquo;s murder while he was in prison for the murder</p>
<p>of Patricia Height.</p>
<p>But Pete denied any involvement in Pixie&rsquo;s kidnapping and murder.</p>
<p>Pete also denied ever being present at the Whitehall Holiday Inn.</p>
<p>He claimed that everything Ralph said was an outright lie.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, Pete stuck to that story and police were stuck waiting for a confession</p>
<p>that would never come.</p>
<p>In 1982, three years after murdering Patricia Height, Pete died by suicide in prison.</p>
<p>It had been four years since Pixie was killed and the primary suspect was dead and police</p>
<p>had virtually no other leads to follow.</p>
<p>And with that, Pixie&rsquo;s case went cold and the case remained nearly motionless for decades.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t go thinking that&rsquo;s the end of the story.</p>
<p>The case wasn&rsquo;t closed and put away for good.</p>
<p>In 2007, Agent Wheely got a hold of the case and started reworking it.</p>
<p>And right away, he had an idea.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 years had passed since Pixie&rsquo;s murder and DNA could be the missing piece</p>
<p>of the puzzle investigators needed to finally close the case.</p>
<p>So Agent Wheely went out on a limb and asked the Whitehall Police Department if they still</p>
<p>had the evidence for Pixie&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>He was especially interested in the rope that had been around Pixie&rsquo;s neck when she was</p>
<p>found.</p>
<p>He knew that it had to have been loaded with her killer&rsquo;s DNA.</p>
<p>And sure enough, Whitehall PD did still have the evidence.</p>
<p>It had been sitting there untouched for three decades.</p>
<p>So Whitehall police sent the evidence to Agent Wheely, who then took it to the FBI&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>for testing.</p>
<p>I was like, awesome.</p>
<p>I was, I mean, oh, we&rsquo;re so excited.</p>
<p>So they, he sends it out to us.</p>
<p>We take it to the lab and they open it up and they&rsquo;re like, ugh, plastic.</p>
<p>As most of you might know, storing evidence in any kind of plastic is a big no-no for</p>
<p>investigators nowadays.</p>
<p>Plastic invites moisture and mold and ultimately destroys any usable DNA.</p>
<p>So modern day detectives now know to put their evidence in paper bags or envelopes.</p>
<p>But this was the 1970s before anybody really knew better.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like I said, it was common evidence gets stored in plastic in the seventies</p>
<p>and I was all excited when I had the evidence until I got to the lab and I showed it to</p>
<p>him and they&rsquo;re like, yeah, we&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t, they couldn&rsquo;t get anything.</p>
<p>This was a huge blow to the investigation.</p>
<p>Since there was almost no physical evidence tying Pete to the crime, they would need to</p>
<p>hear from an eyewitness or get some other form of evidence to be satisfied that he was</p>
<p>in fact the killer.</p>
<p>But unfortunately it was far too late for confession and no one else was coming forward</p>
<p>with information.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t stop obsessing about it and trying to figure out what happened.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s frustrating because you hit a point that I can&rsquo;t take this any further, you know?</p>
<p>What do you do in that situation?</p>
<p>You try to give the family as much closure on it as I can, you know?</p>
<p>If this is the only evidence I have, I can&rsquo;t get a conviction based on this.</p>
<p>I probably wouldn&rsquo;t even get charges filed.</p>
<p>But, you know, the individual is deceased, you know, how much, how much closure can you</p>
<p>give the family?</p>
<p>You know, I think we have strong evidence to believe he was there.</p>
<p>So unfortunately we just not guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>When we asked Pixie&rsquo;s sister Eleanor what she thought about the Pete theory, she said</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s not 100% sure and she&rsquo;s not making any conclusions until there&rsquo;s enough</p>
<p>evidence to warrant one.</p>
<p>For more than 40 years, that&rsquo;s what Pixie&rsquo;s family had been waiting for.</p>
<p>The evidence they needed to understand what happened to their beloved Pixie and why.</p>
<p>Eleanor, Pixie&rsquo;s children, and all the other members of her family have waited long enough</p>
<p>for justice.</p>
<p>Investigators never gave up on this case and they&rsquo;re not about to start now.</p>
<p>So if you have any information on the kidnapping and murder of Mary Beth Grismore, aka Pixie,</p>
<p>no matter how insignificant you think it might be, please speak up.</p>
<p>Call the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI, that&rsquo;s 1-800-225-5324, or you can visit tips.fbi.gov.</p>
<p>And again, please check our website, check that list of items that were missing from</p>
<p>her car.</p>
<p>You might have seen one, you might have one, and that might be the missing piece to the</p>
<p>puzzle.</p>
