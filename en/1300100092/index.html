<p>welcome welcome one and all to the</p>
<p>first ever live</p>
<p>podcast that we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>you rest on your hands if this fucking sucks</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s up to you guys if we seem artificial</p>
<p>and fake and shall we because it&rsquo;s an audience here</p>
<p>out of our environment</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re out of my house we usually do it in my</p>
<p>my office so basically this is a new</p>
<p>experience for all of us which is kind of fun yeah</p>
<p>just three weirdos and a bunch of fucking</p>
<p>freaks that want to hear him talk</p>
<p>how great would a fucking fire be at the exit</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>like the happy land disco in the bronx just a bunch of</p>
<p>screaming burning people</p>
<p>and the only</p>
<p>thing that saves</p>
<p>us is that you fan everybody with that hat</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d all have</p>
<p>to be grateful that you wore that hat tonight</p>
<p>thank god he was here</p>
<p>is it made out of hemp yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one problem thing</p>
<p>about weed people</p>
<p>you know i have a line of t shirts now</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not made out of hemp</p>
<p>and i keep getting emails like what the fuck bro</p>
<p>why not hemp</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know because where the fuck do you find hemp</p>
<p>teeth that&rsquo;s a pain in the ass man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not usually</p>
<p>very comfortable either they&rsquo;re usually kind of rough</p>
<p>have you ever had like hemp like</p>
<p>shirts or clothing yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re canvasy yeah they&rsquo;re canvasy</p>
<p>well they can make them soft right</p>
<p>you should make them out of the skin of a fucking</p>
<p>stroke having polar bear</p>
<p>as you drink your</p>
<p>water from a</p>
<p>box what was that bear&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>what was his name</p>
<p>oh kut the bear that just fucking dropped out of a</p>
<p>stroke and i swear is he</p>
<p>germany yeah sorry it&rsquo;s too soon</p>
<p>that must be so frustrating to be a</p>
<p>polar bear and be in a fucking zoo</p>
<p>i know i think i&rsquo;m having a stroke</p>
<p>cause no one knows what you&rsquo;re saying i bet</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>happy it&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>happy his internment&rsquo;s</p>
<p>over i mean that&rsquo;s what they live for is killing</p>
<p>things they can&rsquo;t even kill anything</p>
<p>just feed them the food</p>
<p>this is ridiculous</p>
<p>you know how much they must love when a fucking</p>
<p>when some delusional asshole jumps</p>
<p>in the front he</p>
<p>gets the picture and all</p>
<p>have you seen the</p>
<p>video online of the girl gets her leg bitten</p>
<p>no she gets her leg broken</p>
<p>he locks a hold of her leg</p>
<p>through the bar somehow or another she got so</p>
<p>close that he</p>
<p>could grab a hold of her pull her into him</p>
<p>and bite down on her leg and he snapped her femur</p>
<p>yeah and he</p>
<p>bit into her leg and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>screaming and they&rsquo;re beating him with sticks</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re beating him with</p>
<p>sticks and he&rsquo;s like fuck you i got her i&rsquo;m not letting</p>
<p>go yeah and somehow i</p>
<p>know that they got him to let go but she was fucked up</p>
<p>is that the one there was one</p>
<p>video i saw with a guy</p>
<p>not so there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>asian guy he got his jacket got</p>
<p>did you see that one</p>
<p>where he was</p>
<p>close to the bear cage and it</p>
<p>grabbed his coat</p>
<p>and they had to take him out of his</p>
<p>coat so the bear couldn&rsquo;t pull him through the cage by</p>
<p>say coat again i just keep saying coat</p>
<p>coat coat coat</p>
<p>have you seen the</p>
<p>video where</p>
<p>the bear that</p>
<p>it was a movie bear</p>
<p>and they used him in a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>movies and there was a guy</p>
<p>standing there</p>
<p>and they were doing</p>
<p>drills with this bear and the bear just decided</p>
<p>to attack the guy and rips his fucking throat out</p>
<p>and it was the</p>
<p>trainer&rsquo;s cousin i believe it was</p>
<p>and he just bit</p>
<p>anybody know what i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>semi pro yeah he was in the</p>
<p>movie semi pro</p>
<p>and this bear fucked up</p>
<p>for no reason is a</p>
<p>video of it</p>
<p>and so what does this asshole do</p>
<p>well they have to retrain the bear what</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t shoot that fucking thing</p>
<p>are you crazy bear</p>
<p>ate your cousin you&rsquo;re gonna go you didn&rsquo;t lose his job</p>
<p>you still get to be a trained bear</p>
<p>fucking completely ridiculous</p>
<p>how would you forget to train him not to eat people</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t that be the first thing</p>
<p>clawing throat bad</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most ridiculous attitude ever</p>
<p>people have about these animals about keeping them</p>
<p>alive like we need them</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important they&rsquo;re a part of our ecosystem like</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>polar bears i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be okay</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>might have a few</p>
<p>extra fucking seals laying around</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go shoot</p>
<p>those fucking</p>
<p>things in the head and that&rsquo;ll be the end</p>
<p>of it we&rsquo;ll have to fuck on uglier rugs if there are no</p>
<p>polar bears so what</p>
<p>polar bear rugs are beautiful</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a fucked up</p>
<p>thing the bear rug is the only rug</p>
<p>where they keep the fucking head on it yeah</p>
<p>they want you to see that stupid thing they conquered</p>
<p>yeah no big giant head that can eat your asshole</p>
<p>attached to a carpet</p>
<p>it looks like he&rsquo;s flying he&rsquo;s probably so embarrassed</p>
<p>that his legs are all out</p>
<p>i had a jacket once and</p>
<p>it had fur on the inside</p>
<p>of the jacket it was like a hoodie with fur on it</p>
<p>and this woman actually</p>
<p>pointed at my jacket</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i do not like your jacket i do not like you wearing fur</p>
<p>so i go it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fucking fake far like you know like what&rsquo;s the big deal</p>
<p>she goes i don&rsquo;t like what it represents</p>
<p>see what happens when killing fake animals</p>
<p>fucking wookiees</p>
<p>the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you</p>
<p>you got her though</p>
<p>she was cause she wanted to be</p>
<p>self righteous and when you said it&rsquo;s fake that</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>ended it for her but she had to win</p>
<p>so she then she would</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like what it represents</p>
<p>you should have just fucking</p>
<p>spice on the spin kicks you were fucking teaching</p>
<p>saint pierre</p>
<p>you should have thrown one</p>
<p>right in the fucking you</p>
<p>should have just kicked kicked her fucking internal</p>
<p>plumbing out</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>given her a</p>
<p>hysterectomy with your heel</p>
<p>what is it about people that love to be</p>
<p>fucking self</p>
<p>righteous what is it</p>
<p>about people that love to be the one takes the</p>
<p>moral high ground</p>
<p>would never do that</p>
<p>no one ever you know</p>
<p>what the fuck is that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we</p>
<p>love seeing them get busted that&rsquo;s why we love</p>
<p>politics that like fucking legislate</p>
<p>against gays</p>
<p>but then they get</p>
<p>caught blowing somebody yeah</p>
<p>everyone loves</p>
<p>good hypocrite</p>
<p>to be fucking</p>
<p>brought down it&rsquo;s just satisfying yeah because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a easy</p>
<p>stance to take</p>
<p>did you hear</p>
<p>about the guy in</p>
<p>vegas who&rsquo;s a prosecutor we were talking</p>
<p>about in the podcast</p>
<p>earlier today</p>
<p>he prosecuted</p>
<p>bruno mars and britney&rsquo;s</p>
<p>known paris</p>
<p>hilton yeah and he cuts by</p>
<p>crack big nut</p>
<p>and not even</p>
<p>ecstasy you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s buying</p>
<p>crack like a</p>
<p>self hating junkie</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>going dude there&rsquo;s a lot of people talking shit</p>
<p>about crack but let</p>
<p>me tell you something i really straightened my life out</p>
<p>dude i started</p>
<p>cleaning the house</p>
<p>i stopped eating i was</p>
<p>doing a lot of chores that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my friend eddie</p>
<p>dated a lot of girls that used to do math</p>
<p>he was dating a lot of</p>
<p>strippers at one</p>
<p>point in his life</p>
<p>and he would say you always</p>
<p>know when you dating a girl does math because their</p>
<p>houses are spotless</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t eat and</p>
<p>he goes and you can fuck them in the butt and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never anything in there</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>they never shit</p>
<p>so you never have to</p>
<p>worry it&rsquo;s always clean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s amazing you just</p>
<p>fuck him in the ass all the time that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great you know they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>waste any time with</p>
<p>dental hygiene if they&rsquo;re on meth that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great so if you fuck the astral</p>
<p>heart a tooth falls out you go</p>
<p>that was a two toother all right</p>
<p>sorry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem with</p>
<p>a lot of people we&rsquo;re talking about the self righteous</p>
<p>thing i know that you get fucking crazy</p>
<p>about liberals and</p>
<p>about people who take the moral high ground</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t hate liberals</p>
<p>i agree with them on most</p>
<p>things like i&rsquo;m four gay marriage gay adoption</p>
<p>and so much of what they stand for i agree with</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve let me down</p>
<p>i get what i</p>
<p>get from the conservatives you know what i mean</p>
<p>because i make my</p>
<p>living talking so</p>
<p>language is important to me like it is everybody</p>
<p>but the conservatives always were shitty</p>
<p>about it they</p>
<p>would always</p>
<p>target you for</p>
<p>going after the church or</p>
<p>if you said fuck they</p>
<p>would always you</p>
<p>know you&rsquo;re obscene</p>
<p>the liberals were supposed to</p>
<p>stand for something different</p>
<p>they were supposed to be this oasis of free thought</p>
<p>but then they became restrictive</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make fun</p>
<p>of this don&rsquo;t make fun of that how much do you</p>
<p>think they did that just</p>
<p>to try to win votes to try to get the middle try to go</p>
<p>after the center you know that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>things get blurry</p>
<p>right yeah but i</p>
<p>think that like any</p>
<p>other nobody ever says</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a fucking</p>
<p>free speech repressing asshole no one ever says i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>self righteous</p>
<p>everyone gives themselves</p>
<p>a reason like the conservatives say it&rsquo;s family values</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m protecting family</p>
<p>values and the</p>
<p>liberals say well we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting hate speech</p>
<p>and we want people to have a safe haven</p>
<p>everyone gives themselves a reason</p>
<p>to shut you up for what they don&rsquo;t like hearing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>annoying yeah</p>
<p>the hate speech</p>
<p>i recently retired the word faggot</p>
<p>and i relish</p>
<p>every chance to</p>
<p>talk about how i retired the word faggot</p>
<p>so i get to use it again</p>
<p>just because</p>
<p>i love the way it comes off the tongue it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i have a few bits now that i</p>
<p>would like to</p>
<p>throw faggot in there</p>
<p>i would like to</p>
<p>throw it in there</p>
<p>i say it a lot once i</p>
<p>catch myself</p>
<p>mumbling and then i realize i&rsquo;m on the sink in the</p>
<p>mirror and i&rsquo;m like oh</p>
<p>but yes you</p>
<p>see everybody has a reason nobody ever says</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like it so you shouldn&rsquo;t say it</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s too revealing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost too embarrassing for them to</p>
<p>admit to themselves that they really are that person</p>
<p>so they have to</p>
<p>paint a reason around it and that&rsquo;s why they</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s hateful</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this go fuck yourself i used to talk</p>
<p>about this on</p>
<p>stage but it&rsquo;s actually true</p>
<p>when i did my</p>
<p>spike tv special</p>
<p>i used the word faggot twice</p>
<p>and once describing my dog and once about ants</p>
<p>you know it was</p>
<p>it had nothing to do with gay sex you know right</p>
<p>and they beeped out everything</p>
<p>except when</p>
<p>they aired it before 11</p>
<p>they beeped out</p>
<p>everything and then</p>
<p>when they aired it after 1 am</p>
<p>they went uncensored</p>
<p>completely except faggot</p>
<p>they beeped out faggot</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s too much like they drew a line</p>
<p>and so i had</p>
<p>a conversation with this guy gay guy at the network</p>
<p>and he goes well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredibly offensive and</p>
<p>quite frankly it&rsquo;s our word i go what</p>
<p>and he goes</p>
<p>he goes it&rsquo;s our nigger</p>
<p>he goes we can</p>
<p>say faggot i go that&rsquo;s the gayest shit i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>heard in my life</p>
<p>and you can go fuck yourself and</p>
<p>i said it an extra</p>
<p>three or four years</p>
<p>just because of that guy goes he&rsquo;s like this is the</p>
<p>stupidest fucking argument ever</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>having one word</p>
<p>like nigger is bad enough one dangerous out there</p>
<p>candyman candyman</p>
<p>candyman word i mean</p>
<p>just say it and fucking people</p>
<p>punch you in the head</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the craziest fucking thing ever</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>could walk down the</p>
<p>street and call your your your</p>
<p>basketball a nigger you fucking non</p>
<p>bouncing nigger</p>
<p>and people would just beat the shit out of you</p>
<p>they will fuck you up like you have to use no</p>
<p>the word like that</p>
<p>it just came to mind it&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>thing that came to mind</p>
<p>you know if you were walking down the</p>
<p>street calling your banana a cunt no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna like fight you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>but you you</p>
<p>call your dog a nigger and they&rsquo;ll fucking call</p>
<p>friends to have an excuse to beat the shit out of you</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;ll hold you down and call everyone</p>
<p>they know to come over and kick you in the fucking head</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s funny the way that we</p>
<p>are inspired to change</p>
<p>these words michael richards the</p>
<p>laugh factory was what brought the</p>
<p>whole conversation</p>
<p>back again and it was like this dumb</p>
<p>society we live in we let some fucking blithering idiot</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t handle a heckler that&rsquo;s all that was he</p>
<p>just couldn&rsquo;t handle a heckler</p>
<p>and his whole</p>
<p>the only reason we like michael richards</p>
<p>is cause he was</p>
<p>oh hello jerry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the guy who you take your social cues from</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>what he thinks or feels or says</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just whatever we have a chance to be</p>
<p>heard people take it uh</p>
<p>the word nigger is a bad word but we</p>
<p>also have social justice for that if you say it to the</p>
<p>wrong people</p>
<p>you get your fucking</p>
<p>teeth knocked out</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the way it</p>
<p>should be if you say to a</p>
<p>black guy he</p>
<p>punches you in the</p>
<p>mouth and that</p>
<p>should be the</p>
<p>penalty it&rsquo;s so baffling though when i see</p>
<p>trends like that i always wonder how long they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna last is nigger</p>
<p>gonna be a bad word</p>
<p>a hundred years from now or will it be passe will it</p>
<p>last forever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be on nbc by that time</p>
<p>you think so yeah i mean</p>
<p>look look like 20 years old that&rsquo;s what the end will</p>
<p>stand for well it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>some common essential</p>
<p>nigger black cunt</p>
<p>i said once on one of my podcasts that</p>
<p>every fucking youtube</p>
<p>video i&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>has at least one</p>
<p>quote one comment that says nigger cunt on it</p>
<p>and some fucking psycho went on</p>
<p>every youtube</p>
<p>video that has</p>
<p>my name on it and put nigger cunt in the comments</p>
<p>like the same guy just made it</p>
<p>just a life&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>like a fucking he must have spent</p>
<p>hours doing that yeah it&rsquo;s like that little childish</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>weird example it&rsquo;s like the westboro church they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>weird example of people who just like saying bad</p>
<p>things to get</p>
<p>what they do with police</p>
<p>protection which i</p>
<p>think is kind of</p>
<p>funny it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they think that the war in iraq is</p>
<p>god&rsquo;s way of killing soldiers because they had an ied</p>
<p>thrown into</p>
<p>their they had a bomb thrown into the yard so they</p>
<p>think god killed soldiers</p>
<p>but yet they</p>
<p>still need police to protection</p>
<p>and they remind me of that people that like to just</p>
<p>stand behind the</p>
<p>screen door and yell</p>
<p>dirty words</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>it is they&rsquo;re just trying to be offensive</p>
<p>the social justice for them</p>
<p>should be the same as if a guy says nigger to a</p>
<p>black guy they</p>
<p>should allow</p>
<p>the families of</p>
<p>these soldiers</p>
<p>just to fucking take care of</p>
<p>these people themselves and not protect them</p>
<p>if you want to use the word you</p>
<p>should you should suffer the</p>
<p>price what&rsquo;s really the real problem with people</p>
<p>like that god hates fags people is that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>broad spectrum of</p>
<p>human intelligence just like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>broad spectrum of dick sizes</p>
<p>dicks aren&rsquo;t the same size what do you mean you know</p>
<p>just like some people can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink you know</p>
<p>some people are dumb as fuck</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing you could do about that</p>
<p>and if you come</p>
<p>along and start reading them out of the</p>
<p>bible and the lord says that man</p>
<p>shall not live with a man and if he does</p>
<p>shall be burned at the</p>
<p>stake and dead with a rock and</p>
<p>all you have</p>
<p>to do is read that shit to them and they go</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re with you man god hates fag</p>
<p>t shirts they got placards</p>
<p>they got time they don&rsquo;t have a job nobody else</p>
<p>will fucking hire them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re walking down the street</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s plenty of them man we need</p>
<p>to fucking figure out how to make the lowest form of</p>
<p>human smarter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very important well the reason i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sincere and</p>
<p>this is my opinion is because they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>stuff like god hates fat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using such purposefully</p>
<p>insightful language</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>in this country that don&rsquo;t like homosexuals if their</p>
<p>cause was really</p>
<p>to hurt homosexuality</p>
<p>they would they</p>
<p>would talk it in terms</p>
<p>where a lot more people</p>
<p>could agree with them and feel good they</p>
<p>could get a lot more done</p>
<p>they just they just trying</p>
<p>to yell naughty words and get attention for themselves</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t kind of embarrassing it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole thing fag</p>
<p>it could be or they</p>
<p>secretly all want to</p>
<p>suck cocks and they yeah just that&rsquo;s how they hide it</p>
<p>it could be that you know i mean that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>ted hagrid thing was so</p>
<p>funny when oh</p>
<p>was he great pastor</p>
<p>ted brilliant</p>
<p>loved a massage did he yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>i was following him on twitter but he</p>
<p>blocked me why</p>
<p>he blocked me because he</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a new church now and they had a</p>
<p>thing on cnn</p>
<p>about it and he&rsquo;s got like this big</p>
<p>following now and they&rsquo;re all coming</p>
<p>he goes we have everyone</p>
<p>prostitutes and you know and and junkies and then what</p>
<p>they all come to our church and we don&rsquo;t ask questions</p>
<p>we just we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>here to the worship the lord and read the word</p>
<p>and so he has</p>
<p>these meetings and he talks about them</p>
<p>and so he put it up on his twitter so sunday</p>
<p>after church</p>
<p>what should we do so i go meth and blowjobs and</p>
<p>apparently old ted can&rsquo;t take a fucking joke</p>
<p>not even an lol</p>
<p>and a fucking two</p>
<p>dots with a capital p you can&rsquo;t even give me that dude</p>
<p>come on bro</p>
<p>you fucking got busted with gay hookers</p>
<p>you should got you</p>
<p>gotta own that shit son</p>
<p>well technically it was a masou a masur</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>now sometimes you just need a massage i must say as</p>
<p>long as they</p>
<p>suck your dick for</p>
<p>money they become a hooker</p>
<p>alright good point</p>
<p>he the guy and</p>
<p>the guy was on cnn too that was the brilliant</p>
<p>thing the guy just came</p>
<p>clean and told the whole</p>
<p>story he just got</p>
<p>tired of this guy</p>
<p>being a hypocrite</p>
<p>and legislate</p>
<p>and going after gay it&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be gay</p>
<p>and not tell your family like who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>larry craig that fucking</p>
<p>bag of vomit like</p>

<p>crazy got a fart in</p>
<p>front of them</p>
<p>jts have a whole bit about that</p>
<p>well you could play</p>
<p>devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>

<p>gonna create a backstory</p>
<p>cause the fucking</p>
<p>first time i got turned</p>
<p>i i&rsquo;ve turned very rarely for</p>
<p>i think celebrities are kind of nervous</p>
<p>about turning</p>
<p>me down like i just get it over with you know some</p>

<p>gonna sign an</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s a thank you that&rsquo;s a topical one</p>
<p>fucking i yank them out 31 years</p>
<p>later and make them fresh</p>
<p>uh was deniro i was at</p>
<p>billy crystal did a play called</p>
<p>seven hundred</p>
<p>sundays and i got invited to the premiere</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t know deniro was</p>
<p>gonna be there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not supposed to</p>
<p>bring cameras to this at all you just don&rsquo;t bring him</p>
<p>and i see deniro</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever seen deniro but</p>
<p>literally everybody in the room is like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>famous even like</p>
<p>when celebrities are in the room they stare at deniro</p>
<p>and it was on</p>
<p>a tablet on the</p>
<p>green in new york</p>
<p>and so i walked up to him and i tapped his forearm</p>
<p>and i was like bob</p>
<p>and i swear</p>

<p>if i call him bob he won&rsquo;t realize that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never met like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a personal</p>
<p>thing and he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>think that like</p>
<p>oh i must know this guy because he knew that robert is</p>
<p>shortened to bob like i don&rsquo;t know what i was thinking</p>
<p>and i go can i have a picture</p>
<p>and he goes no</p>
<p>and i was not prepared for no at all</p>

<p>and he said nobody</p>
<p>again he wasn&rsquo;t being a dick either he goes not cause</p>
<p>i just want to go say hi to</p>

<p>their cell phones</p>

<p>one of my favorite</p>
<p>photos is i actually was in vegas</p>
<p>for opie and anthony and you were there also jamie</p>
<p>ed asner do you remember meeting</p>
<p>ed i certainly do how badass was that</p>
<p>you remember when ed asner</p>
<p>got super mad at opie yeah</p>
<p>from the destroyer</p>
<p>yeah and then the poker guy the poker guy like</p>
<p>and you got in a huge fight i remember i had to</p>
<p>tweet in a huge fight he</p>
<p>misinterpreted what i was saying</p>
<p>i had to sit next to him though</p>
<p>after he got</p>
<p>off the interview and he was like getting his</p>
<p>stuff together and he was just</p>
<p>steaming well he was</p>
<p>breaking up with this</p>
<p>woman and i what i said was</p>
<p>whoops what i said is</p>
<p>um yeah that&rsquo;s hard it&rsquo;s hard when you</p>
<p>break up with a girl ago the</p>
<p>thing that bothers me the most</p>
<p>is i was thinking</p>
<p>about her getting fucked by some other guy</p>
<p>and yeah gorilla fuck</p>
<p>yeah he said something</p>
<p>about the media stuff</p>
<p>those really how</p>
<p>big fucking</p>
<p>black guy with a</p>
<p>giant hard cock</p>
<p>stuffing her in the corner of a</p>
<p>couch and coming in her face</p>
<p>i mean you think</p>
<p>about the shit</p>
<p>that you did to her and then like she likes that kind</p>
<p>of shit and she&rsquo;s probably had some new dude doing it</p>
<p>right now and that just</p>
<p>freaks me the fuck out and</p>
<p>he took it the</p>
<p>wrong way you broke him</p>
<p>you broke him</p>
<p>he thought i was saying that that was happening to his</p>
<p>girlfriend i said</p>
<p>this is what i&rsquo;m scared of</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not necessarily saying that you know</p>
<p>there is a boogeyman</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i jerk off to whenever me and my</p>
<p>girlfriend fight i&rsquo;m like oh i hope she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking someone with a bigger cock i can hear about oh</p>
<p>uh that it is the</p>
<p>worst when you&rsquo;re dating a girl and she&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about how hot some</p>
<p>other guy is like</p>
<p>really okay you don&rsquo;t get hard for that jack no it my</p>
<p>greatest fear was like i&rsquo;ll get hard for that yeah yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so obsessed</p>
<p>with self obsessed</p>
<p>animals like</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s my turn to talk i didn&rsquo;t hear what he said</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m a bad actor</p>
<p>cause i don&rsquo;t listen</p>
<p>it can be that&rsquo;s really why i&rsquo;m a fucking</p>
<p>mediocre actor i</p>
<p>literally don&rsquo;t listen to the dialogue i just watch</p>
<p>mouth and as soon as the mouth stops i&rsquo;m like my turn</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the electric company when</p>
<p>those mouths were coming from this</p>
<p>but i know it used to torture me like girls</p>
<p>i would be obsessed</p>
<p>with them fucking guys with</p>
<p>a bigger cock my cock&rsquo;s fine but it&rsquo;s nothing you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re obsessed with it in a good way or bad</p>
<p>way no i&rsquo;d be depressed</p>
<p>about it because i couldn&rsquo;t measure up i wasn&rsquo;t good</p>
<p>enough we&rsquo;re all sexually insecure on some level and</p>
<p>i used to make them tell me</p>
<p>about it i would just torture myself</p>
<p>and then i started getting like</p>
<p>the more porn i</p>
<p>watched and then</p>
<p>a couple times i</p>
<p>would date girls and we just talk</p>
<p>about fucking guys i</p>
<p>would make them tell me</p>
<p>about guys they fucked</p>
<p>and what you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t see at home is he mocked the fuck motion</p>
<p>yeah i gave a</p>
<p>saying that with an angry face</p>
<p>and i gave my hip like four thrusts which is</p>
<p>more credit than i deserve in real life</p>
<p>are you gonna throw fake punches at her neck</p>
<p>to a fake choke</p>
<p>what i mean by it is</p>
<p>the most depressing thing</p>
<p>about a girl telling you how hot some other guy is</p>
<p>is that she doesn&rsquo;t care about your feelings</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s really what it is it&rsquo;s like the most</p>
<p>depressing thing</p>
<p>about it is like okay now</p>
<p>we have this kind of weird relationship</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>try to tweak me</p>
<p>every now and then</p>
<p>and fuck with the way i feel by telling me how hot some</p>
<p>other guy is me when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to be in love with me but is she getting</p>
<p>the same thing with a guy if a guy&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>pointing out girls all the time</p>
<p>like look at that ass like</p>
<p>do you think you&rsquo;re no</p>
<p>chick wants to hear that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a weird</p>
<p>thing even if</p>
<p>the person&rsquo;s hot like just</p>
<p>think about what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying and how it affects the person that you&rsquo;re with</p>
<p>depends on your relationship though because like</p>
<p>if you if she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be mad at you saying it</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s saying it then it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>yeah she would</p>
<p>get jealous then she&rsquo;s being kind of a cunt but if she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be mad</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s different i</p>
<p>think most yeah if</p>
<p>you know someone really well and you get to know each</p>
<p>other really well and you open up about</p>
<p>stuff like that and you have a real open relationship</p>
<p>about what turns you on and what</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t yeah</p>
<p>but in a lot of cases that&rsquo;s not really what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and in a lot of cases it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people fucking with each other</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s bad that&rsquo;s unhealthy</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to just kind of jab each other the</p>
<p>grossest fucking</p>
<p>thing that ever happens when i take</p>
<p>pictures of</p>
<p>someone is guys that want to tell me that i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>their wife&rsquo;s list</p>
<p>yeah yeah you&rsquo;re on her list</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on her list bro</p>
<p>okay take a</p>
<p>picture with her</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s hot gotta take a</p>
<p>picture with her bro</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like what are you talking about</p>
<p>the list meaning yeah yeah</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a lot of fuck you</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work that once</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s disgusting</p>
<p>sarah silverman</p>
<p>was on my list and then i went to a comedy club with my</p>
<p>girlfriend she goes alright</p>
<p>this game does not work in la</p>
<p>cause i mean that&rsquo;s just to</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be on a list meaning like brad</p>
<p>pitt you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna run into brad</p>
<p>pitt that&rsquo;s like make believe list</p>
<p>so the list is always make believe</p>
<p>so for the most part i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s really bluffing</p>
<p>about your list if you live in</p>
<p>la it has to be bluffing because you can&rsquo;t run into all</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty fucking hard to run into brad pitt dude</p>
<p>yeah i know and that&rsquo;s what i thought even in</p>
<p>la brad pitt&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>until i moved here</p>
<p>and so then she was on your list</p>
<p>she was on my list like</p>
<p>seven years ago then i</p>
<p>moved here with my</p>
<p>girlfriend and then we were at a comedy club were you</p>
<p>plotting something what</p>
<p>are you plotting something</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m just saying she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like oh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sarah silverman</p>
<p>and she goes</p>
<p>that game does not work here</p>
<p>my girlfriend actually has the meadowlark lemon</p>
<p>globe trotters</p>
<p>on her list but it&rsquo;s only i</p>
<p>would only let her fuck the globe trotters</p>
<p>if it was meadowlark and curly neal it was that</p>
<p>only with curly and metal lark together</p>
<p>is curly still on the</p>
<p>globetrotters i don&rsquo;t think so metal lark is</p>
<p>62 they couldn&rsquo;t both be playing i saw them in the</p>
<p>winter great the ball would go and be a string on it</p>
<p>when i was a little kid</p>
<p>when i was a little kid i was so</p>
<p>stupid i thought the harm</p>
<p>globe trotters were the greatest</p>
<p>basketball players in the world</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d be like why are the knicks even bothering</p>
<p>the celtics</p>
<p>when the fucking harlem</p>
<p>globetrotters around running shit i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>this is these guys are fighting crimes with</p>
<p>scooby doo how are the knicks gonna do you know</p>
<p>remember the</p>
<p>globe trotters went to gilligan&rsquo;s island yeah</p>
<p>i fucking hated that show</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t funny it was fucking terrible</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s the most fascinating example of</p>
<p>cultural evolution is to go back</p>
<p>and look at tv shows from like the 50s and 60s and 70s</p>
<p>how fucking unbelievably bad they were oh</p>
<p>terrible people were</p>
<p>dumb as shit back then</p>
<p>i wonder what it really</p>
<p>is is it that we&rsquo;re just used to like a different</p>
<p>standard of</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>or were people really dumber than</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t more innocent but they</p>
<p>admitted to less than</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t forget</p>
<p>marriages lasted longer than information wasn&rsquo;t passed</p>
<p>simpler way</p>
<p>everything was</p>
<p>simpler you know like people didn&rsquo;t have access</p>
<p>to information like as easily as us did you imagine</p>
<p>if you could go back to the 50s and only you</p>
<p>could have the internet</p>
<p>you would be running shit</p>
<p>only you just you go</p>
<p>back to the 50s you got a laptop that&rsquo;s all the time on</p>
<p>you would just dominate</p>
<p>you would be able to</p>
<p>debate anybody</p>
<p>sit the fuck down bitch</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pulling shit out of the air on you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be typing in this thing you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even know what you have in your hands</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the only one there</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be an internet you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>googling your own</p>
<p>facebook but no no</p>
<p>you have access to the keisha</p>
<p>corrections</p>
<p>the acacia records</p>
<p>you know what that is</p>
<p>no they believe that the people that believe that</p>
<p>intelligence and thought is actually like a non local</p>
<p>thing and that your body is just</p>
<p>sort of a radio</p>
<p>for tuning in the</p>
<p>creativity of the universe</p>
<p>believe in a</p>
<p>thing called the akashic</p>
<p>records and a lot of ancient scholars and a lot of</p>
<p>mystics and</p>
<p>channelers believe in this as</p>
<p>well and they believe that all the information all the</p>
<p>things that anybody has ever created</p>
<p>are all it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>out in the air you just have to pull it out of the air</p>
<p>and you can and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where creativity is</p>
<p>sounds completely ridiculous</p>
<p>but then you think</p>
<p>about it like what the fuck is</p>
<p>creativity what is your imagination</p>
<p>imagination is just</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ethereal</p>
<p>right and in that</p>
<p>the person figures it out and comes up with</p>
<p>this idea and then it actually manifests itself as a</p>
<p>solid thing</p>
<p>it becomes an iphone 4</p>
<p>i mean with a</p>
<p>bunch of other people and a</p>
<p>bunch of other</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s imagination together and work and all that</p>
<p>other stuff and</p>
<p>innovation and</p>
<p>figuring out you</p>
<p>know how to make</p>
<p>glass and all the</p>
<p>other different parts and</p>
<p>how it all goes together</p>
<p>but the bottom line is</p>
<p>it was in the ether</p>
<p>and then it became a</p>
<p>solid object out of the imagination</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s people that believe that</p>
<p>everything it</p>
<p>literally comes out of</p>
<p>almost like another dimension</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where ideas come from</p>
<p>and that the acacia</p>
<p>records is that all knowledge the knowledge of</p>
<p>everything is out there you just have to tune into it</p>
<p>i wonder i don&rsquo;t know i mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know either but i do know that i don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>i never feel like anything i write is um</p>
<p>is something that i wrote</p>
<p>i always feel like it&rsquo;s it was given to me</p>
<p>i feel like when i when i&rsquo;m at</p>
<p>when i write my best</p>
<p>stuff even when i perform</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m at my best on stage</p>
<p>i i feel like i&rsquo;m a passenger</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>all the work that i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is just to become a good antenna</p>
<p>you know all the work that i&rsquo;ve done it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>to become a good antenna</p>
<p>and then become a good</p>
<p>discipline person that sits down</p>
<p>and then turns</p>
<p>the antenna on and then does all the writing</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>see the reason i have</p>
<p>trouble with the occasion</p>
<p>ideas because we&rsquo;re all on the same</p>
<p>level of ideas</p>
<p>it was almost like</p>
<p>if if the ideas were out there all along</p>
<p>how come fucking cavemen</p>
<p>were just clubbing each</p>
<p>other over the</p>
<p>head and nobody back then said fucking google</p>
<p>earth well i</p>
<p>think the idea is they didn&rsquo;t have as</p>
<p>good we have to evolve</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where we can</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t you know you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like just have a time machine before you have the wheel</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>like slowly progress and but the idea is that all</p>
<p>these ideas that we</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re inventing</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re inventing or creating we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>literally pulling</p>
<p>them out of the imagination the imagination</p>
<p>might be like</p>
<p>literally an actual</p>
<p>thing that manifests real</p>
<p>things in this</p>
<p>dimension if that&rsquo;s all true then you owe them and</p>
<p>see an apology how</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re all just picking from the same pool</p>
<p>well yeah you&rsquo;re allowed to do it with spirits only</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to have a muse only</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to steal jokes you fuck</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s contrary to the actual idea of what</p>
<p>creativity is like to say that to admit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a book called the war of art by stephen</p>
<p>pressfield you ever heard of it it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great book on writing</p>
<p>and one of the</p>
<p>things that he writes about is the concept of the muse</p>
<p>and that pretty much</p>
<p>exists throughout every culture and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s talked about</p>
<p>with many many</p>
<p>great writers that they</p>
<p>have to have some sort of amuse and it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>someone gives them</p>
<p>these ideas</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>to really tune into that</p>
<p>you have to be non</p>
<p>egotistical you have to not be thinking</p>
<p>about yourself you have to be</p>
<p>tuned in to</p>
<p>the frequency that you need to be</p>
<p>tuned into to write</p>
<p>which is like sort of</p>
<p>blank sort of a zen state</p>
<p>which is exactly</p>
<p>the opposite</p>
<p>of the look at me i&rsquo;m the shit state</p>
<p>which is what you have to be to</p>
<p>steal things and</p>
<p>steal jokes</p>
<p>to boost yourself up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>contrary to this creative state</p>
<p>which is why</p>
<p>so many people that are</p>
<p>thieves and scumbags and</p>
<p>shitty joker stealers</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know how to be funny</p>
<p>they literally don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>connection to it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve completely lost</p>
<p>their connection</p>
<p>so they have to just grab</p>
<p>things blindly</p>
<p>attached to them and then repeat them</p>
<p>and then get</p>
<p>laughs and then look for the next</p>
<p>thing to grab</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the ability to pull</p>
<p>those things out of the ether themselves</p>
<p>i was just kidding</p>
<p>sir why are</p>
<p>you guys the guy in</p>
<p>front has not hit me like see</p>
<p>what the fuck is that nod sir</p>
<p>what yeah what is that not like</p>
<p>i was kidding</p>
<p>which guy&rsquo;s nodding</p>
<p>with joe yeah but i was just kidding</p>
<p>i know but nobody gave me like a</p>
<p>thumbs down</p>
<p>these are just jokes kid</p>
<p>settle the fuck down</p>
<p>he really did tisk</p>
<p>tisk me like</p>
<p>like i instead of realizing</p>
<p>i just saw an opportunity to get a line in there he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like like i really meant it so you don&rsquo;t take it as a</p>
<p>statement of fact i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not under oath</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a difference between the west</p>
<p>coast and the east coast</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about this lately</p>
<p>like with the whole gilbert godfrey situation</p>
<p>on the east coast</p>
<p>you could make fun of fucking anything</p>
<p>everything is fair game yeah it&rsquo;s a different kind of</p>
<p>sense of humor</p>
<p>whereas the west</p>
<p>coast like one comic shitting on another comic like</p>
<p>saying something like that unless you&rsquo;ll see an apology</p>
<p>hey hahaha we&rsquo;re all laughing together people</p>
<p>oh that was a dig he went after you and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing the difference out here is there are</p>
<p>funny people out here</p>
<p>but everybody out here is</p>
<p>transplant in someplace else and show business</p>
<p>is out here</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re in new york nobody gives</p>
<p>a fuck if you&rsquo;re in show business it&rsquo;s just a different</p>
<p>place but out here it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole business</p>
<p>so everybody is very focused</p>
<p>on that next</p>
<p>level and it&rsquo;s like i think</p>
<p>comics out here</p>
<p>have much less stage time</p>
<p>and that guy&rsquo;s like you who are fucking</p>
<p>you know your headlining</p>
<p>everywhere but guys that</p>
<p>are trying to get</p>
<p>their first 10 minutes together</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s scared of saying the</p>
<p>wrong thing to the</p>
<p>wrong person</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s afraid that that</p>
<p>seven minutes they do is</p>
<p>gonna be seen by cbs and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be the next mike and</p>
<p>molly oh you know what i mean</p>
<p>yeah just a different mindset so</p>
<p>comics don&rsquo;t shit on it</p>
<p>at the comedy</p>
<p>style we would just attack each other</p>
<p>we used to take each</p>
<p>other to hack</p>
<p>court and me fucking</p>
<p>keith robinson</p>
<p>patrice o&rsquo;neal colin</p>
<p>we would go over each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s bits and then the rest of us would</p>
<p>judge whether or not you&rsquo;re a hack for doing that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m taking that bit to hack</p>
<p>court and kevin hart we would just brutalize each other</p>
<p>when kevin hart</p>
<p>little kevin he&rsquo;s a funny guy but we knew he was</p>
<p>funny when he first came up from philly</p>
<p>and he would go on stage in the cellar</p>
<p>and we would all just go down and sit in the front row</p>
<p>and just fucking stare at him and be like</p>
<p>and he handled it and he was</p>
<p>funny and that&rsquo;s what we do to each</p>
<p>other we&rsquo;d have a good time and just shit on each</p>
<p>other as comics</p>
<p>a lot of comics joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right are not</p>
<p>funny guys they don&rsquo;t know how to tease each</p>
<p>other they don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>to be fucking they don&rsquo;t take a joke well they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>awful they&rsquo;re craftsmen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re carpenters they&rsquo;re like writers</p>
<p>who like instead of writing it down are</p>
<p>speaking it out</p>
<p>and they think that a lot</p>
<p>of times when they&rsquo;re bombing it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re too</p>
<p>ironic and nobody gets them and it&rsquo;s like nope you just</p>
<p>stink i worked</p>
<p>with a guy once he said something and then he goes</p>
<p>that usually gets an applause break</p>
<p>to the audience yes</p>
<p>and it was like some really fucking wack ass political</p>
<p>idea you know some</p>
<p>republicans do this but the democrats don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that usually gets an applause break oh</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a famous guy it was death the only time that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny to say that usually gets an applause</p>
<p>break if you say scott peterson</p>
<p>and they just</p>
<p>stare at you and you go that usually gets an applause</p>

<p>bernard gets you know bernie gets the</p>
<p>subway good i remember bernie gets the</p>
<p>subway gunman</p>
<p>you guys had him on opie and</p>
<p>had him on a few times he was a</p>
<p>guest and i got a</p>
<p>picture with him he&rsquo;s a kook</p>
<p>he walked us through the</p>
<p>shootings slowly</p>
<p>and he took us through</p>
<p>it he said it was like in slow motion the fucking</p>
<p>pow pow and i</p>
<p>guess you&rsquo;re supposed to think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy but i was just like this guy fucking rules</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d love to do that on the</p>
<p>subway just</p>
<p>shoot four people</p>
<p>for not even as</p>
<p>serious a reason as that but just a lot of</p>
<p>other reasons just to kill four</p>
<p>people well if you&rsquo;ve ever been intimidated in public</p>
<p>transportation it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>scary to be locked in a cage that&rsquo;s going 50</p>
<p>miles an hour</p>
<p>with some dangerous person who&rsquo;s got a knife</p>
<p>or got whatever</p>
<p>screwdriver</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s scary shit man</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no one there to protect you it&rsquo;s not even a</p>
<p>you know usually not even a cop on</p>
<p>those fucking</p>
<p>things i know</p>
<p>every comic</p>
<p>wants to be rogan because he&rsquo;s like one of the few</p>
<p>comics that</p>
<p>can just really beat the shit out of any heckler</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all secretly</p>
<p>jealous of joe because it&rsquo;s got to be cool to like</p>
<p>whenever you have a heckle you</p>
<p>never know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be cool to know</p>
<p>that look if</p>
<p>worse comes to</p>
<p>worse i really can</p>
<p>drill this through the guy&rsquo;s fucking jaw bone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta feel i wish i had that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i have to hang out with big people</p>
<p>i never think</p>
<p>about it i just all i would think about if i was you</p>
<p>literally it&rsquo;s all i would think about that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>if i had that ability maybe i wouldn&rsquo;t but if i could</p>
<p>fight like rogue at all i would think about</p>
<p>is what can i do to make you throw a punch</p>
<p>so i can beat the fuck out of you</p>
<p>but i think like a little man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a terrible way to live life i know</p>
<p>at an erection difficulty so</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t forget</p>
<p>about that shit</p>
<p>they come after you</p>
<p>i guess so yeah</p>
<p>yeah if you do it for the</p>
<p>wrong reason you can&rsquo;t just beat somebody&rsquo;s ass</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>end it you know then they live with the fact you beat</p>
<p>their ass and they go home and stew and then they</p>
<p>plot the revenge</p>
<p>might be a gun</p>
<p>might be a knife</p>
<p>might cut your tires</p>
<p>might follow</p>
<p>you around and fuck with you yeah you know just be nice</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better off i am</p>
<p>i always like at the end i always</p>
<p>i go through you know me joe</p>
<p>while i&rsquo;m onstage i go through the audience and go how</p>
<p>about a hand for everybody that took a joke tonight</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m kidding i don&rsquo;t do that that&rsquo;s fucking pathetic</p>
<p>they took a joke tonight</p>
<p>people assume</p>
<p>the audience</p>
<p>go yeah how</p>
<p>about a hand for everyone</p>
<p>that was a good sport</p>
<p>if i shit on someone overly</p>
<p>overly hard in the audience i will say give him a</p>
<p>round of applause or a nice person</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll just say you&rsquo;re</p>

<p>great such a</p>
<p>phenomenal was</p>
<p>great comedy</p>
<p>space right yeah it was</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s the wilbur</p>
<p>theatre they just</p>
<p>do only the theater now i just did that it was actually</p>
<p>great that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>explosive room to it&rsquo;s like now that he has the liquor</p>
<p>license because he</p>
<p>never liquor</p>
<p>license for a</p>
<p>while so the</p>
<p>crowds were good</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>fucking what is</p>
<p>that like for you being a guy been so you&rsquo;ve been sober</p>
<p>since you were really young</p>
<p>right i was 18 yeah</p>
<p>what is it like for you to just constantly being around</p>
<p>drunks i don&rsquo;t mind it as much because i</p>
<p>learned like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>the guys i watch a lot of guys that</p>
<p>drink and have ruined</p>
<p>things by drinking and i</p>
<p>learned from</p>
<p>those guys i</p>
<p>learned from the guys who are they were brilliant</p>
<p>and who have allowed fucking</p>
<p>drinking and doing drugs to fuck</p>
<p>their career up you know</p>
<p>like a lot of</p>
<p>guys can handle it i just couldn&rsquo;t i was the guy on the</p>
<p>phone at three in the morning i was a cutter you know i</p>
<p>was eighteen i</p>
<p>was sixteen and fifteen yeah wow</p>
<p>somebody i sliced my arm up a lot with the</p>
<p>razors it was just</p>
<p>childish notice i see</p>
<p>mark you think you</p>
<p>would do that now as an</p>
<p>adult if you that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>serious fucking mark there i got a</p>
<p>bunch of behavior</p>
<p>like that but</p>
<p>i was i was in this one there was just out of</p>
<p>anger and that</p>
<p>wow it was all but it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t a suicide attempt it was just goes</p>
<p>angry so i just took a boxcar</p>
<p>but again it was drunk</p>
<p>well you say it like you know no big deal just</p>
<p>not anymore though</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good reminder though if i ever</p>
<p>think i can handle</p>
<p>it i look back and go oh yeah you&rsquo;re a fucking but i</p>
<p>would love to</p>
<p>think it was cooler than it was</p>
<p>but i was just a douchebag</p>
<p>who wanted attention because if i wanted to die i</p>
<p>would have died i didn&rsquo;t want to die</p>
<p>so was it the substances</p>
<p>or was it just your</p>
<p>state of mind at the time like what was</p>
<p>it you think</p>
<p>if you drink</p>
<p>right now you just</p>
<p>start cutting yourself again</p>
<p>not immediately booze was the worst for me</p>
<p>i did coke and i smoked coke and</p>
<p>stuff but to me booze was the worst i never did</p>
<p>like ecstasy</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t around back then</p>
<p>when i start immediately no</p>
<p>but eventually it</p>
<p>would be hard</p>
<p>probably i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>last very long i was a fucking horrible violent</p>
<p>depressive drunk</p>
<p>i would but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;d go out in a</p>
<p>blaze of glory either</p>
<p>i think i would kill somebody</p>
<p>drunk driving</p>
<p>i would probably do that probably</p>
<p>run into a nine year old or a fucking kill a family</p>
<p>and then be in jail for</p>
<p>thirty years</p>
<p>but not even have the</p>
<p>glory of fucking i went down swinging</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll just get fucked in the ass</p>
<p>until i bled to death</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually the next title of my book by the way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the metaphor for politics</p>
<p>do you still experiment with urine a lot</p>
<p>in sexual acts i actually</p>
<p>dated a girl who always wanted me to pee inside of her</p>
<p>and so i know how that you love golden showers and</p>
<p>stuff but she would always want it sure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you know you&rsquo;re out of touch yeah fuck yeah</p>
<p>real experiment i just wanted to see how it</p>
<p>would work as a beverage</p>
<p>tastes like popcorn</p>
<p>it does it tastes like popcorn yeah saltates</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s popcorn flavor</p>
<p>piss i&rsquo;m drinking my own if you are</p>
<p>have you i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard that&rsquo;s good for you and i&rsquo;m supposed to be</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s supposed</p>
<p>to be good for you but whatever how good</p>
<p>could it be just take a vitamin</p>
<p>you drink your own piss like a</p>
<p>crazy person</p>
<p>what i thought was</p>
<p>fascinating</p>
<p>about it though was how people reacted to it</p>
<p>you know people are so terrified of it i did it on the</p>
<p>radio show with this guy with the dj i go i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>drink my piss if you</p>
<p>drink yours you want to do it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ll do it if you do it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like real okay</p>
<p>and i just pissed in a cup and i drank it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like shit that</p>
<p>and he had to try to do it he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like dry even i&rsquo;m like it&rsquo;s just piss man</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s also six years of fear factor</p>
<p>shit changes the way you look at things man</p>
<p>cause we had an episode once</p>
<p>where this girl</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t eat this bug she was just</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like she couldn&rsquo;t eat it she couldn&rsquo;t eat it she</p>
<p>could i go give me that</p>
<p>thing come on</p>
<p>come on we&rsquo;re filming a show here just eat the fucking</p>
<p>thing i would have</p>
<p>never done that like season one</p>
<p>when the cameras roll</p>
<p>by the time you get to</p>
<p>season four you see</p>
<p>horse rectums and</p>
<p>blended maggots and</p>
<p>i saw people eat insane things</p>
<p>habanero peppers</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen people eat four</p>
<p>whole habanero peppers</p>
<p>just screaming in</p>
<p>agony where</p>
<p>every cell in your body</p>
<p>is writhing with this fucking</p>
<p>spicy sauce</p>
<p>so you know</p>
<p>drinking your own piss is nothing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nothing it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>warm it&rsquo;s just weird</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>drink your piss just to say you did it it&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>eat it first just take it take it off the fucking</p>
<p>bucket list</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a hard one to do</p>
<p>just do it just to say you did it</p>
<p>do you ever drink someone else&rsquo;s piss no</p>
<p>never drink well sure definitely because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>eaten a lot of girls out they probably weren&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>clean so sure</p>
<p>some way or another i got some piss in my mouth</p>
<p>astronaut i yeah</p>
<p>girls would like come back from the back i gotta go pee</p>
<p>they come back from the bathroom and i&rsquo;d eat them out i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even think about it</p>
<p>i mean you know when you&rsquo;re young you</p>
<p>stupid as fuck you&rsquo;re not thinking about where you</p>
<p>stupid no you know that&rsquo;s how i get girls in the</p>
<p>golden shower honest to god i</p>
<p>would say that i don&rsquo;t wipe</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;re pissed about just</p>
<p>leave it yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all dirty</p>
<p>and they would come back and it</p>

<p>oh god the way i got my one</p>
<p>girlfriend into</p>

<p>about myself that i love is that i&rsquo;m a very good worker</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t feel guilty</p>
<p>about anything i have because i fucking work for it</p>
<p>do sets every</p>
<p>night i never feel guilty</p>
<p>about succeeding</p>
<p>if i work for it</p>
<p>but the sexual</p>
<p>stuff is fucking do it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>accomplice literally</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve written two books</p>
<p>and i had to put them together at the comedy seller</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m such a</p>
<p>slave when i&rsquo;m on the computer to jerking off</p>
<p>like i literally</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like a chimp i</p>
<p>would just i</p>
<p>would grab my it&rsquo;s soft my dick</p>

<p>look at his face</p>
<p>look at this dude</p>
<p>the dude behind you with the hat sir okay</p>
<p>i was going just like</p>

<p>watched i&rsquo;ve seen a few of them</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen some horrible</p>
<p>those are ones that are violating people</p>
<p>but those videos people think i&rsquo;m disgusting for</p>
<p>watching they&rsquo;ve made me more empathetic</p>
<p>towards people like i really feel</p>
<p>like when i&rsquo;m watching</p>
<p>those videos i&rsquo;m like god that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>truly horrible thing</p>
<p>it gives you a real perspective on</p>
<p>maybe it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>maybe just telling</p>
<p>myself that and you know the fact that i get a</p>
<p>pounding erection you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just me</p>
<p>but no i feel empathetic towards</p>
<p>those people when i</p>
<p>watch you burn</p>
<p>alive or something it&rsquo;s not just this</p>
<p>thing you hear</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s fucking horrible</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>a big fan of introducing that information into my brain</p>
<p>cause it just</p>
<p>it rewires the way you look at the day</p>
<p>you know like it&rsquo;s very hard to just let it go when you</p>
<p>watch some guy get his fucking head</p>
<p>cut off and it&rsquo;s wheezing out of his windpipe as blood</p>
<p>squirts out of it like a broken pipe</p>
<p>yeah you know it&rsquo;s fucked up it&rsquo;s a fucked up</p>
<p>thing to see</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re having a</p>
<p>great day and</p>
<p>really enjoying yourself</p>
<p>and hanging out with your friends then you watch that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like okay now this is reality</p>
<p>that this is happening</p>
<p>right now in mexico</p>
<p>some guy is tied up in a barn somewhere</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re cutting his dick off and</p>
<p>stuff it in his</p>
<p>mouth as he</p>
<p>bleeds to death</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s real but</p>
<p>how much information can you</p>
<p>absorb into your mind</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t the problem</p>
<p>that we have</p>
<p>today is you</p>
<p>could see something like that anytime you want</p>
<p>you could see any time of the</p>
<p>night you can download any sort of video</p>
<p>all sorts of</p>
<p>horrific acts that people are doing to each</p>
<p>other and animals are doing to people and</p>
<p>that reality</p>
<p>it exists all over the place and</p>
<p>you absorbing it and</p>
<p>bringing it</p>
<p>into your life does not make anything better</p>
<p>once you understand that that</p>
<p>exists you understand that</p>
<p>that spectrum of</p>
<p>human behavior is possible</p>
<p>the most you could</p>
<p>avoid that shit the better you are off</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize it</p>
<p>but you download a lot of</p>
<p>stuff and bring it into your life</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on but if you actually</p>
<p>experience that energy</p>
<p>we have access to too much fucking shit</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not supposed to</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not designed to have the internet</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re designed to have access to all the disturbing</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s around us</p>
<p>so that we make good decisions on how we</p>
<p>should survive and</p>
<p>where we should go</p>
<p>but when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everywhere it&rsquo;s just anywhere you are</p>
<p>guy getting his fucking head cut off</p>
<p>just go on your</p>
<p>phone watch a</p>
<p>video you&rsquo;re the king of that though you</p>
<p>watch that on like</p>
<p>every day way</p>
<p>more than i do i</p>
<p>watch way more</p>
<p>animals fucking up people</p>
<p>cause i always feel like what are you doing there</p>
<p>stupid that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t bother me nearly as much people</p>
<p>fucking up people&rsquo;s very disturbing i saw one video</p>
<p>that i had seen before</p>
<p>it was a guy being murdered</p>
<p>by a screwdriver it was a real murder</p>
<p>that these these guys</p>
<p>way i was i forget what country it was some</p>
<p>bizarre they killed like</p>
<p>twenty one people in a</p>
<p>month they were</p>
<p>true sociopaths oh so i know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something something that the</p>
<p>maniacs beyond the d</p>
<p>yeah and what the one murder they committed with</p>
<p>a fucking screwdriver</p>
<p>and it upset me so much i was laying down actually just</p>
<p>after those gonna</p>
<p>throw up like i was</p>
<p>gonna pass i</p>
<p>literally felt like i was</p>
<p>gonna faint</p>
<p>watching this</p>
<p>video it was that horrendous</p>
<p>and i kind of felt grateful that i</p>
<p>could like react</p>
<p>horribly to something like thank god</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not that jaded</p>
<p>cause you watch the news</p>
<p>and even we&rsquo;re so jaded by it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>literally you hear people are murdered</p>
<p>every day and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have an effect</p>
<p>it that nine eleven had an</p>
<p>effect or the japanese nuclear meltdown or</p>
<p>those things have an effect</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>hear that somebody was killed in a car accident</p>
<p>or somebody was beheaded</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything anymore because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard it 5 000 times</p>
<p>you watch it once</p>
<p>and then every time you hear it you know what it</p>
<p>sounds like and what it looks like</p>
<p>i never went back to iraq</p>
<p>i went one time with colin</p>
<p>to perform for troops</p>
<p>and it was right</p>
<p>after they caught sonom</p>
<p>and you know it was a</p>
<p>scary place</p>
<p>but then man fucking i was our cowie and</p>
<p>those guys started beheading people</p>
<p>and i was scared to go back and like god forbid</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going from one base to another and your fucking</p>
<p>blackhawk goes down</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen what that looks like i can</p>
<p>never put myself so it did fucking make me not do</p>
<p>something that i</p>
<p>would have done</p>
<p>would just go back to iraq</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s weird to me how we&rsquo;ll concentrate</p>
<p>on one person that died in one strange way in america</p>
<p>but we won&rsquo;t concentrate</p>
<p>on how many fucking people die in afghanistan</p>
<p>every single day</p>
<p>everyday soldiers get shot and killed</p>
<p>every fucking day</p>
<p>but because they&rsquo;re soldiers it&rsquo;s always like yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the cost of war</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>they paid for your freedom and they start</p>
<p>nonsense and gibberish</p>
<p>about it but</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>you look at that like how strange it is</p>
<p>we were talking about</p>
<p>there was a charlie sheen comparison</p>
<p>all the people that died</p>
<p>while this charlie sheen shit was</p>
<p>going on all</p>
<p>these people that</p>
<p>died in iraq and there was a website that had like all</p>
<p>these different people and they showed all</p>
<p>their stories</p>
<p>and all these people died</p>
<p>while the united</p>
<p>states media was</p>
<p>covering charlie sheen every day</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty fucking strange</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s strange how we can compartmentalize</p>
<p>we can say well</p>
<p>these are just people that are</p>
<p>dying in war so it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the cost of life the</p>
<p>price of life the</p>
<p>value of life is much less</p>
<p>and also the media</p>
<p>i mean we all know they&rsquo;re repulsive</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re repulsive</p>
<p>but the days of cronkite</p>
<p>have are over</p>
<p>the days of integrity in the</p>
<p>media are over</p>
<p>but they still</p>
<p>enjoy the same content freedom and the same lacks fcc</p>
<p>rules which they shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because their ratings driven they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about getting the</p>
<p>story first and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 50 news channels now 24</p>
<p>hours a day news used to just be a segment</p>
<p>so everything that happened in the</p>
<p>world would be piled into a half hour</p>
<p>on a couple of different channels</p>
<p>now you got cnn you get fox news you get a million</p>
<p>places to find news and they got a full time so</p>
<p>everything now</p>
<p>is news you go on fox news all the time</p>
<p>right you do that red eye</p>
<p>show i used to do red</p>
<p>eye a lot i don&rsquo;t do it much anymore although i love</p>
<p>the guys on the show</p>
<p>i had a slight</p>
<p>issue with fox themselves</p>
<p>and i like doing</p>
<p>hannity a lot because</p>
<p>hannity has always been very fair with opie and anthony</p>
<p>people have a knee jerk reaction hatred for</p>
<p>hannity but</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s a cunt</p>
<p>no but you know what</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a guy that fought though for</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a guy that went to bat for imus</p>
<p>yeah but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a guy that went to bat for opie and anthony with</p>
<p>still a cunt</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s conservative</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a cunt that gets on your side but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely full of shit he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>total ideolog</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys that just he&rsquo;s for the</p>
<p>party a hundred percent</p>
<p>he attacks the democrats on</p>
<p>every front he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a weird guy it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a soldier in the republican war</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>he is a very conservative guy and i don&rsquo;t always see</p>
<p>eye to eye a hundred percent with him</p>
<p>i really don&rsquo;t but i like him because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fought for the things</p>
<p>that affect me</p>
<p>which is language and he</p>
<p>fought harder for</p>
<p>unpopular language</p>
<p>than so many of</p>
<p>these liberals</p>
<p>it was like the guys that said that</p>
<p>once i must apologize i must apologize</p>
<p>the guys that said they</p>
<p>would go back on a show again</p>
<p>i think were giuliani and mccain</p>
<p>both republicans</p>
<p>and everyone kills the</p>
<p>republicans like oh they&rsquo;re terrible for free speech</p>
<p>but you know what when opie and anthony got in</p>
<p>trouble fucking</p>
<p>hannity was one of the most</p>
<p>vocal supporters</p>
<p>like if you don&rsquo;t like what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>just turn it off</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>where were all the fucking liberals</p>
<p>where were all the liberals</p>
<p>sticking up for the</p>
<p>right to say this unpopular</p>
<p>shit they weren&rsquo;t around</p>
<p>yeah well they already had a relationship</p>
<p>before that though didn&rsquo;t they opi and anthony hannity</p>
<p>yeah we used to compete</p>
<p>against them in the afternoon we were on any w</p>
<p>shawn was on but you guys</p>
<p>they were all friends too didn&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>not really no they became</p>
<p>friends afterwards</p>
<p>yeah it was</p>
<p>never a hatred</p>
<p>it was just like he was the competition we were on</p>
<p>three to seven on any w in new york</p>
<p>and sean was ought to</p>
<p>think abc or whatever</p>
<p>is it weird though that when you&rsquo;re doing fox</p>
<p>you know that fox news is a propaganda network it&rsquo;s 100</p>
<p>propaganda i mean</p>
<p>they literally have</p>
<p>admitted to getting</p>
<p>direct information from the</p>
<p>white house here&rsquo;s talking points</p>
<p>we want you to discuss this</p>
<p>which should be fucking illegal</p>
<p>i mean the fact</p>
<p>that the news gets driven by politicians and</p>
<p>and government you</p>
<p>know people that are in government</p>
<p>right now that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous fox that&rsquo;s what was</p>
<p>going on fox is conservative absolutely</p>
<p>but they become a very safe</p>
<p>target because what happens is</p>
<p>look at cnn</p>
<p>look at msnbc</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very left leaning</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s almost like fox seems like this</p>
<p>crazy whacked out place</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re far to the</p>
<p>right but the rest of</p>
<p>media is far to the left none of them</p>
<p>are in the cell look at the shit that went on npr</p>
<p>look at the fucking they</p>
<p>fired juan williams</p>
<p>for giving an opinion on fox</p>
<p>honest what was the opinion what did he say</p>
<p>he said to o&rsquo;reilly he said honestly</p>
<p>he goes look i don&rsquo;t he goes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m paraphrasing something</p>
<p>about how he felt</p>
<p>more uncomfortable with</p>
<p>muslim men on a plane</p>
<p>than he did with</p>
<p>other people and he said he almost</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to feel that way he was just being honest</p>
<p>about a feeling that everybody has</p>
<p>he was not attacking muslims</p>
<p>and then the fucking one of the women at</p>
<p>npr said that he</p>
<p>should have his head</p>
<p>checked and they</p>
<p>fired him on some</p>
<p>technicality because he gave an opinion or some shit</p>
<p>but it was because he gave</p>
<p>an opinion that didn&rsquo;t go hand in hand with the company</p>
<p>and they dumped him for it</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>people say fox is so conservative</p>
<p>but this guy just an expressed opinion npr</p>
<p>fucking booted them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re extraordinarily</p>
<p>liberal the entire</p>
<p>media is biased in one way or the</p>
<p>other fox just</p>
<p>stands out because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>conservative ones so there&rsquo;s like one of them</p>
<p>which is why they do the big numbers</p>
<p>because how many fucking</p>
<p>arch conservatives do you have you go to</p>
<p>riley you got</p>
<p>hannity you got beck they&rsquo;re all in one place</p>
<p>if the fucking</p>
<p>liberals had just one</p>
<p>media outlet like that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>have very very competitive numbers and ratings</p>
<p>i see what you&rsquo;re saying but</p>
<p>still doesn&rsquo;t really excuse the fact they get talking</p>
<p>points from the government that seems</p>
<p>completely ridiculous that seems like they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>a propaganda network</p>
<p>but i absolutely</p>
<p>agree with you</p>
<p>about the one william situation</p>
<p>beyond gross</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t the guy be a</p>
<p>human being can he</p>
<p>admit to something</p>
<p>weird that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even like it himself that he feels</p>
<p>weird when he sees muslims</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s a fucking unfounded</p>
<p>of fear i mean it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t fucking fly</p>
<p>planes into</p>
<p>buildings it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>killing people</p>
<p>for dancing you know there&rsquo;s a lot of shit</p>
<p>going on that</p>
<p>would make you scared of</p>
<p>muslims all over the</p>
<p>world it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are all like that but</p>
<p>how come a guy</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just say that can&rsquo;t say i&rsquo;ve got this fear</p>
<p>you know because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>phone americans we live in a very phony</p>
<p>place and england&rsquo;s the same way with this</p>
<p>stuff with religion or with ethnicity</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always uncomfortable mentioning the truth</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>whenever you say</p>
<p>some scumbag christian killed</p>
<p>an abortion doctor we all know that&rsquo;s fucking horrible</p>
<p>and people are</p>
<p>right to attack that and say it&rsquo;s fucking terrible</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t hear when</p>
<p>somebody says ah look at this abortion bomber you know</p>
<p>nobody ever</p>
<p>says yeah but there&rsquo;s bad people in all religions</p>
<p>but whenever you mention</p>
<p>islam people feel like they have to</p>
<p>throw in that asterisk by mentioning</p>
<p>other religions</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be fucking killed for it</p>
<p>like when piss christ was done</p>
<p>remember that</p>
<p>piece of art piss christ</p>
<p>all the papers talked</p>
<p>about and i believe a lot of them showed</p>
<p>photos of it</p>
<p>which they should have i mean it was a big story</p>
<p>but man when fucking</p>
<p>that danish paper</p>
<p>printed that</p>
<p>picture of muhammad</p>
<p>and that guy was killed for the cartoon i believe</p>
<p>or targeted for death</p>
<p>none of the papers</p>
<p>in the us printed it</p>
<p>smartly because they were afraid of being fucking</p>
<p>targeted for suicide bombings</p>
<p>but they were you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not mad at me are you sir oh no this guy&rsquo;s leaving</p>
<p>this is such a</p>
<p>small crowd of one person to pee</p>
<p>are you gonna pee</p>
<p>i will wait for you</p>
<p>just hold it in you little girl</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>when i work with mike goldberg mike goldberg</p>
<p>has the bladder of a fucking chipmunk it&rsquo;s the saddest</p>
<p>thing in the world</p>
<p>when we work together</p>
<p>the guy gets up to piss like four or five times</p>
<p>like you can</p>
<p>play a game at home if you ever listening to the</p>
<p>fights at home</p>
<p>if you hear only me talking</p>
<p>while a guy is walking</p>
<p>guys walking into the cage is</p>
<p>cause goldberg&rsquo;s pissing</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s no way he</p>
<p>would let me just talk for that long he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gotta pee</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m the same way i&rsquo;ve i fucking i have to fly in the</p>
<p>aisle i have like a</p>
<p>psychological i can&rsquo;t even take</p>
<p>window seats anymore</p>
<p>cause i piss so much</p>
<p>but you drink a lot</p>
<p>or is it just used to hold your peel</p>
<p>on your young</p>
<p>both dude i&rsquo;ve actually was so</p>
<p>weird i had</p>
<p>sonograms done on my bladder and my fucking uh</p>
<p>i thought there was something</p>
<p>wrong with me i&rsquo;m like do i get a fucking bladder</p>
<p>cancer you know because i always go for the healthy</p>
<p>you know immediately normal way to</p>
<p>think i have bladder cancer</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like no you</p>
<p>drink too much</p>
<p>liquid you drink too much coffee and water</p>
<p>you want to hear a</p>
<p>crazy bladder story</p>
<p>i know a guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an mma fighter who&rsquo;s on steroids and he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to get busted</p>
<p>so one of the methods of pissing</p>
<p>clean is they take</p>
<p>clean urine</p>
<p>and they inject it into his bladder</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;ll self inject</p>
<p>clean urine</p>
<p>into his but this is all</p>
<p>completely rumor</p>
<p>from alleged</p>
<p>his coach but</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m like how&rsquo;s that guy pissed</p>
<p>clean and then they told me the</p>
<p>story and went whoa</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s taking it deep so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people are willing to inject themselves with urine</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fake urine you can buy for drug tests no that</p>
<p>shit doesn&rsquo;t work because</p>
<p>they they because they busted</p>
<p>kevin randleman with that shit</p>
<p>because it was non</p>
<p>human had no hormones so they so</p>
<p>human pee and they did in columbus ohio</p>
<p>you could buy packets of pee</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>keep it in between your legs when you do the test and</p>
<p>they put a little spout and you piss it out right this</p>
<p>yeah you to a</p>
<p>point they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>your dick but they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>standing in the same room yeah you have fake</p>
<p>rubber dick they make them it&rsquo;s called the whizzinator</p>
<p>it looks like it&rsquo;s got veins and</p>
<p>everything get the</p>
<p>right at the</p>
<p>same tone yeah you</p>
<p>gotta get the</p>
<p>right color</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d buy the</p>
<p>black one for ego purposes</p>
<p>i would buy a hulk dick</p>
<p>big green dick by</p>
<p>the way though just</p>
<p>we talk about the media bias</p>
<p>and the fucking arizona</p>
<p>shooter here&rsquo;s a great example of fucking media bias</p>
<p>they were trying to pin it on</p>
<p>sarah palin and the metaphorical</p>
<p>target over the voting district they were like</p>
<p>we have to listen to</p>
<p>we have to stop listening to fiery rhetoric</p>
<p>concern it wasn&rsquo;t a voting</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just that it was actually over people</p>
<p>she had those</p>
<p>targets over people&rsquo;s names</p>
<p>you know look i don&rsquo;t think that sarah payne</p>
<p>was responsible for that one lone</p>
<p>crazy motherfucker</p>
<p>who made all those</p>
<p>crazy videos but</p>
<p>you if you&rsquo;re putting that out there you&rsquo;re putting a</p>
<p>crosshair on a person and saying this person is the</p>
<p>enemy that&rsquo;s the target</p>
<p>you are definitely</p>
<p>implying that that that person should be shot</p>
<p>but i think we understand it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crosshair bro</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you shoot people</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a wacky thought bubble over everyone&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>duh you know this is the person no</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pointing these people out with a</p>
<p>target like with a gun sight</p>
<p>but if you say something like</p>
<p>the giants are gonna kill the jets</p>
<p>nobody thinks tall people are</p>
<p>shooting at aircraft no no no we all</p>
<p>know but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we understand the metaphor of that and no</p>
<p>the point i&rsquo;m making is</p>
<p>she was saying that dimitri</p>
<p>was saying it was conservative talk</p>
<p>and then bill moore</p>
<p>went on leno</p>
<p>and i like bill but he was like this conservative</p>
<p>talk and then all the kids friends are like</p>
<p>no no he was a fucking not exala</p>
<p>conservative</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t listen to talk radio</p>
<p>they basically came out and</p>
<p>said that he was much more of a left wing guy than some</p>
<p>right winger</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>media had to shut the fuck up</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they were just trying to find a way</p>
<p>even though she had a</p>
<p>target they</p>
<p>understood it was a metaphor</p>
<p>and they were trying to make it</p>
<p>into something it wasn&rsquo;t because we all have an agenda</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t use metaphors anymore we can&rsquo;t use a</p>
<p>target metaphor</p>
<p>because somebody</p>
<p>might kill people it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tricky when you talk</p>
<p>about how this country though is like</p>
<p>dying in this country is falling</p>
<p>apart and we need to save this country</p>
<p>and that is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the hype and then when you say</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the blockades</p>
<p>these are the enemies</p>
<p>to freedom these are the enemies</p>
<p>these are the</p>
<p>people that are trying to fuck up this country</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a target a gun site on their head</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re saying you</p>
<p>should shoot them</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m not blaming her for what one</p>
<p>crazy asshole did</p>
<p>but you know when you put gun</p>
<p>sights on people&rsquo;s names</p>
<p>you are implying that they</p>
<p>should be shot</p>
<p>but are you</p>
<p>implying they</p>
<p>should be shot or are you</p>
<p>implying the meta they&rsquo;re a target</p>
<p>but does anybody really think that</p>
<p>sarah palin is saying</p>
<p>shoot him</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think she has to</p>
<p>just by being vague</p>
<p>about it you</p>
<p>leave it open to interpretation by fucking psychos</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>a crosshair and</p>
<p>you know how many fucking</p>
<p>idiots out there</p>
<p>are attracted to her and in love with her</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s reasonably</p>
<p>attractive and she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>woman that&rsquo;s in power</p>
<p>and they have this</p>
<p>wacky thing</p>
<p>about her getting into</p>
<p>power and they</p>
<p>wanna help her and do her</p>
<p>bidding it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a million</p>
<p>of them out there like that yeah but we can&rsquo;t we cannot</p>
<p>dictate our speech</p>
<p>or the fact that metaphors</p>
<p>because somebody</p>
<p>might misinterpreted some</p>
<p>crazy person i agree</p>
<p>might misinterpret</p>
<p>this kid&rsquo;s motives were unimportant</p>
<p>to me because he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy fuck and he</p>
<p>stalked that</p>
<p>woman for like</p>
<p>three years</p>
<p>he was a crazy</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>who wanted to kill</p>
<p>her so he killed her my opinion is there was something</p>
<p>sexual there</p>
<p>cause for a guy to</p>
<p>stalk well he didn&rsquo;t kill her she&rsquo;s alive</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry dude but he meant to she</p>
<p>yeah he meant</p>
<p>to killed a little girl and killed</p>
<p>a couple of people</p>
<p>the thing is a mess it&rsquo;s obviously you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>blame her for</p>
<p>doing that but what the fuck are you doing with</p>
<p>crosshairs over people&rsquo;s names sure but</p>
<p>what did lennon do to inspire mark chapman to kill him</p>
<p>or what did gerald</p>
<p>ford do to inspire</p>
<p>squeaky fromm to want to kill you know what i mean</p>
<p>anytime you look at somebody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an assassinate people and murder people you can&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>for what we the regular people did</p>
<p>to cause it</p>
<p>especially again maybe</p>
<p>a target over someone&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>but before that</p>
<p>every single person</p>
<p>understood the</p>
<p>metaphor of what it meant and nobody thought that</p>
<p>she was encouraging people i mean she&rsquo;s not a bright</p>
<p>woman on you know</p>
<p>right but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>known as one of</p>
<p>those guns god and government people</p>
<p>you know and so</p>
<p>when you put</p>
<p>targets over people she&rsquo;s a hunter</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s known for killing</p>
<p>things she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>known for sitting by the body</p>
<p>of an animal with a fucking rifle</p>
<p>which by the way they say that she didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>shoot that thing</p>
<p>it was a photo shoot</p>
<p>and they pulled her up to the fucking body and gave</p>
<p>her the gun and she sat there and it was really all</p>
<p>but look at the language we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using comedy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s violent</p>
<p>you know i fucking died</p>
<p>like like we we all</p>
<p>understand what</p>
<p>we mean cause we live it yeah i</p>
<p>crushed i fucking murdered he fucking tanked</p>
<p>he bombed it&rsquo;s like we all</p>
<p>understand what we&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>cause we have this commonality of language and</p>
<p>expression it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>when keith olberman who has a fucking twat</p>
<p>when he fucking</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s why cause that phony</p>
<p>motherfucker good</p>
<p>night and good luck</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys who</p>
<p>wants to be iconic yeah he&rsquo;s not iconic he&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>jizz bag who</p>
<p>threw people</p>
<p>under the bus for language that he used like</p>
<p>when fucking</p>
<p>when one of the reporters said that</p>
<p>was chelsea clinton pimped</p>
<p>by fucking hillary clinton during the campaign</p>
<p>cnsbnbc had</p>
<p>keith out there apologizing</p>
<p>david schuster they suspended him for two weeks</p>
<p>and keith oman gave this apology</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dreadfully sorry</p>
<p>because saying pimped was terrible with chelsea clinton</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s footage of fucking</p>
<p>keith olbermann</p>
<p>saying that david</p>
<p>general petraeus was pimped</p>
<p>by george bush</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we all he</p>
<p>understood what that fucking word meant everybody</p>
<p>understood it just meant used inappropriately</p>
<p>but they selectively got mad at one guy</p>
<p>because he used it in relation to chelsea clinton</p>
<p>but it was okay for</p>
<p>keith oberman</p>
<p>to use it in relation to general petraeus</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking phony</p>
<p>any type of interpretation language like that&rsquo;s phony</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m babbling i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>he was babble</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay he&rsquo;s the guy that you</p>
<p>would babble when you talked</p>
<p>about because that was my</p>
<p>whole thing with him was he needed an editor</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d have these</p>
<p>great talks i</p>
<p>would really like to get behind him if they were like a</p>
<p>minute long</p>
<p>but they just keep fucking going</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like god damn</p>
<p>dude you know you already said it you said your point</p>
<p>wandering on and on with</p>
<p>different adjectives you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like let it go just drop this cut this thing back</p>
<p>he was trying to be iconic you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right like when he said to the</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dreadfully</p>
<p>sorry i actually was like embarrassed for him like</p>
<p>shut up dreadfully</p>
<p>how when have you ever used that or wonderful</p>
<p>never i&rsquo;ve come in girls and not said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>dreadfully sorry</p>
<p>but have you been</p>
<p>no i didn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>i gave him the</p>
<p>wrong last name and kicked him down the steps</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re a i know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a big fan of us not being</p>
<p>in libya and you said something i thought that was</p>
<p>great on twitter the other day</p>
<p>know that how come</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re fucking flying</p>
<p>troops over to libya</p>
<p>and yet no one&rsquo;s hiring new cops for camden new jersey</p>
<p>you know which is</p>
<p>more dangerous</p>
<p>than libya yeah it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a war zone</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where dwight muhammad kawhi</p>
<p>came from remember</p>
<p>dwight braxton</p>
<p>back in the</p>
<p>light heavyweight day oh</p>
<p>okay wow former</p>
<p>light heavyweight champion</p>
<p>one of vander holyfield&rsquo;s</p>
<p>first tests as he was</p>
<p>becoming a professional finder</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a terrible terrible</p>
<p>place in this country and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird to me</p>
<p>that we keep</p>
<p>you know dealing with all this bullshit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on the middle east and flying</p>
<p>troops over the</p>
<p>other side of the planet when</p>
<p>mexico is right next door</p>
<p>mexico they are</p>
<p>taken over by drug cartels</p>
<p>they have fucking tanks in the</p>
<p>street and juarez</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re literally</p>
<p>fighting off armies</p>
<p>of billionaire drug sellers</p>
<p>that are right here you could</p>
<p>drive to them</p>
<p>you know and somehow another we</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s a big threat</p>
<p>in another country on the</p>
<p>other side of the fucking planet</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just i&rsquo;m tired of</p>
<p>part of the us acting like a fucking</p>
<p>mother in law</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sick of us</p>
<p>sticking up i become very</p>
<p>separatist i don&rsquo;t care what</p>
<p>other country like we</p>
<p>should help japan</p>
<p>indonesia countries with this natural disaster haiti</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference between that</p>
<p>and shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not our fucking business and i&rsquo;m sick and</p>
<p>tired of us</p>
<p>sticking our</p>
<p>fucking face</p>
<p>hey how about this you</p>
<p>wanna kill kadafi</p>
<p>do it when he&rsquo;s setting up a fucking tent</p>
<p>in edgewater new jersey</p>
<p>instead of letting him fucking you</p>
<p>wanna kill like</p>
<p>my demons i do it when he&rsquo;s here for the un</p>
<p>and still let him stay at the fucking intercontinent</p>
<p>hotel have some balls</p>
<p>stop allowing all</p>
<p>these people to come here</p>
<p>and fucking be a part of the united nations and then</p>
<p>spend fucking 50 million dollars to bomb them in libya</p>
<p>asshole you</p>
<p>could have fucking</p>
<p>hit him with a hammer and killed him for 20</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>good very good</p>
<p>point but what do you</p>
<p>think about the argument that it&rsquo;s our job as the lone</p>
<p>superpower to keep</p>
<p>other crazy fucks from getting nuclear weapons</p>
<p>a part of me sure does</p>
<p>agree see i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>tired of the world&rsquo;s attitude towards the us</p>
<p>like fucking europe we</p>
<p>should kick i&rsquo;m glad the euro was fucking tanking for a</p>
<p>while because they</p>
<p>loved us when the soviet union was breathing</p>
<p>down their neck when the threat was that the russians</p>
<p>would do something</p>
<p>we were fucking all fantastic</p>
<p>but then as soon as the soviet union falls</p>
<p>america&rsquo;s a bunch of cunts</p>
<p>and then they all get together and they create the euro</p>
<p>so that the us is not the big you</p>
<p>know france has little man complex too just like myself</p>
<p>and then they want to be a big</p>
<p>superpower because they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>annoyed at the</p>
<p>influence the us has</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m tired of the</p>
<p>world hating us</p>
<p>and part of it is because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>jealous and part of it is we brought it on ourselves</p>
<p>because we won&rsquo;t stop fucking</p>
<p>meddling we</p>
<p>should just</p>
<p>mind our business and if somebody fucks with us</p>
<p>the response</p>
<p>should be barbaric are you</p>
<p>a fan of ron paul</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know much about him</p>
<p>i know that he&rsquo;s supposed to be oh</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s libertarian</p>
<p>right yeah i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard very well he&rsquo;s a republican actually</p>
<p>yeah he had a</p>
<p>really interesting take on all this he&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>first of all you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>overtake libya by just launching missiles they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to put</p>
<p>troops on the ground</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when it gets</p>
<p>crazy because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to take a long ass fucking time this isn&rsquo;t not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>he was talking</p>
<p>about how it was just like they said in iraq</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be in there for a couple weeks</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll be out there he goes meanwhile 10 years</p>
<p>later they still don&rsquo;t have an exit strategy like</p>
<p>even saying they&rsquo;re pulling</p>
<p>troops out of iraq they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still leaving</p>
<p>tens of thousands of them i mean it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>giant army of armed</p>
<p>motherfuckers over there</p>
<p>that are going to stay there</p>
<p>and what he was saying was that</p>
<p>these dictatorships when</p>
<p>we have supported them over the years then all of a</p>
<p>sudden we decide that we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>support some rebellion</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even know who the fuck is</p>
<p>really behind the rebellion</p>
<p>i mean we the</p>
<p>american people don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m sure whoever the fuck is</p>
<p>in the government at the highest</p>
<p>levels they must have some sort of an idea what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a real weird</p>
<p>thing when we</p>
<p>start deciding</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>what shit to</p>
<p>get involved in what shit did not get involved in</p>
<p>and people will say well they&rsquo;re gunning</p>
<p>people down the</p>
<p>street people are</p>
<p>dying in the</p>
<p>street yeah</p>
<p>but you know a million</p>
<p>civilians died in iraq</p>
<p>a million where&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>about that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>about that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>about qaddafi</p>
<p>who is yeah he&rsquo;s a thug and a scumbag</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re freaking out</p>
<p>about him killing</p>
<p>these people that are trying to</p>
<p>overtake his government but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>freaking out about</p>
<p>fucking apartment</p>
<p>buildings that were</p>
<p>blown to shit in iraq</p>
<p>have you ever</p>
<p>watched any of</p>
<p>those documentaries</p>
<p>where people really focused on</p>
<p>all the collateral</p>
<p>damage that happened in iraq it&rsquo;s fucking horrifying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s horrifying</p>
<p>these families that</p>
<p>they think that we are the terrorists we&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>worst fucking people ever on the planet</p>
<p>you know and how</p>
<p>about if we want to take a</p>
<p>stand instead of bombing libya</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what the problem with libya is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re embarrassed because</p>
<p>the pan am bomber was released</p>
<p>and we as a country were very embarrassed by that</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still alive</p>
<p>apparently the guys running</p>
<p>triathlons he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dead in two weeks</p>
<p>with cancer and he&rsquo;s fucking healthier than i am and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re embarrassed by that so now we want to get qaddafi</p>
<p>how about we have some fucking balls</p>
<p>and you want to show you&rsquo;re pissed off cut</p>
<p>diplomatic ties with scotland</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the ones who fucking let him go</p>
<p>or if bp was behind it then fucking boot</p>
<p>those cunts out of the country</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fucking you know</p>
<p>waste my tax dollars</p>
<p>overseas you fucking take a real</p>
<p>stand or show</p>
<p>england that you&rsquo;re mad for orchestrating the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>it just annoys me how we&rsquo;re just being</p>
<p>selectively outraged and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know the same shit with language i fucking hate it</p>
<p>well the real problem</p>
<p>is really itch i didn&rsquo;t mean to stop talking</p>
<p>about everybody is</p>
<p>everybody is connected here in this whole</p>
<p>world now with the internet</p>
<p>we have the</p>
<p>separation of different languages</p>
<p>and the fact that we can&rsquo;t physically get to each</p>
<p>other very easily</p>
<p>but the reality is we&rsquo;re communicating with everybody</p>
<p>together now</p>
<p>you know i mean the</p>
<p>whole world</p>
<p>could communicate with each</p>
<p>other so the idea of</p>
<p>countries at a certain</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>becomes ridiculous</p>
<p>you know it used to be that</p>
<p>states you know</p>
<p>when you had to take your fucking horse</p>
<p>and it took</p>
<p>three days to get to maryland</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>states sort of made sense</p>
<p>but then all of a</p>
<p>sudden when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re driving cars in between them you can get to</p>
<p>rhode island to connecticut</p>
<p>in 20 minutes but there are two totally different</p>
<p>things with</p>
<p>two totally different laws</p>
<p>you know and totally different</p>
<p>rulers you know</p>
<p>really you know the governors and this is like rulers</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really what that is</p>
<p>and when it gets</p>
<p>worldwide like that at a certain</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>it becomes preposterous</p>
<p>it really we become a one</p>
<p>world society</p>
<p>and the only</p>
<p>thing that holds us back is language and government</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing that holds us back from being a one</p>
<p>world society</p>
<p>where we look at each</p>
<p>other as if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>just human beings on this one planet</p>
<p>the other different they act different they</p>
<p>smell different they have different food</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just fucking people</p>
<p>the idea that it&rsquo;s us and them</p>
<p>is so archaic</p>
<p>the idea that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this group of people that we just called</p>
<p>today on twitter we&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>group we&rsquo;re us</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re us at the show</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just random</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re us in this city we&rsquo;re us in this</p>
<p>state this us</p>
<p>against them is</p>
<p>crazy nonsense that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still around it</p>
<p>should only</p>
<p>apply to people over and</p>
<p>under 200 pounds</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we</p>
<p>should break</p>
<p>everything should be broken down to</p>
<p>chicks i would fuck</p>
<p>and chicks i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cause that really is what matters to me anyway</p>
<p>since we doing this</p>
<p>thing with a live audience and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re about an hour and a half in now i thought we</p>
<p>would end this up by</p>
<p>taking questions from you guys</p>
<p>because this is the only</p>
<p>time we ever get a chance to do something like this</p>
<p>and we used to do</p>
<p>it on twitter but too many people were cunts it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>breeding all this nonsense</p>
<p>but brooklyn&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what about brooklyn yeah what</p>
<p>about bronco</p>
<p>buffador bro</p>
<p>jenna white so pussy yeah</p>
<p>do you guys have that wireless mic bro yeah</p>
<p>all right dude it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>grab another</p>
<p>water because i zipped</p>
<p>right on through mine</p>
<p>yes supposedly</p>
<p>this guy this guy like a</p>
<p>young kid i</p>
<p>started this box</p>
<p>water of his apartment</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been actually seeing a lot all over the</p>
<p>place and it makes pretty much</p>
<p>sense but now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking wait he</p>
<p>started this in his</p>
<p>apartment so is he just filling it up from the faucet</p>
<p>thank you so is this better from</p>
<p>an ecological</p>
<p>standpoint to have cardboard than his</p>
<p>paper it is right yeah</p>
<p>because paper</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t biodegrade is that the concept</p>
<p>they need to make these out of hemp bro</p>
<p>hip water i like this box water i just</p>
<p>something cool actually pretty good</p>
<p>i feel like the professional</p>
<p>i fucked up is kind of a carton</p>
<p>other professional</p>
<p>i know how fucked up is that we can&rsquo;t drink</p>
<p>water do you</p>
<p>drink tap water i never drink tap water in new york i</p>
<p>do we actually have good tap some of the pipes</p>
<p>are old but new york tap is actually better than most</p>
<p>places believe it or not</p>
<p>but it still</p>
<p>has fluoride</p>
<p>tested that it still has</p>
<p>fluoride in it man</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>fluoride oh yeah</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the deal</p>
<p>water is not supposed to just sit there</p>
<p>if water sits there it turns</p>
<p>green and shit grows in it if you</p>
<p>drink it you die</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s supposed to happen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only supposed to buy</p>
<p>rivers and you&rsquo;re supposed to be</p>
<p>drinking out of</p>
<p>streams and rivers</p>
<p>because it flows</p>
<p>naturally and it gets filtered through</p>
<p>the rocks and all that bullshit and it goes through</p>
<p>the earth wait</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re saying if a glass of</p>
<p>water sits here it&rsquo;ll just become moldy yeah</p>
<p>you know what this is why i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>piece of shit</p>
<p>because i saw</p>
<p>that falling and i just didn&rsquo;t say it i know</p>
<p>i slow motion for me</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re back</p>
<p>i like chaos for the</p>
<p>folks at home my mic</p>
<p>stand fell over oh yeah joe my shit my</p>
<p>speaking of mike joe you&rsquo;re good on the wireless</p>
<p>okay where is it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right in the audience</p>
<p>oh someone&rsquo;s got it okay</p>
<p>um so what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do now</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ll just take questions from anybody who has any</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>would happen i</p>
<p>think water become moldy though</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s just answer that real</p>
<p>quick if you</p>
<p>leave a bucket of</p>
<p>water around the sun you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never done that and it turns</p>
<p>green and shit and</p>
<p>things grow inside of it</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>drink water</p>
<p>tap water is filled with</p>
<p>chemicals is the reason why you can have it in these</p>
<p>giant reservoirs and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t turn toxic</p>
<p>things bacteria</p>
<p>i always thought</p>
<p>like if you had a bucket of</p>
<p>water is because something else was in that bucket</p>
<p>i thought water by itself</p>
<p>would never become moldy or</p>
<p>anything because there&rsquo;s nothing really no if you get</p>
<p>water from like a pond bro there&rsquo;s all kinds of</p>
<p>crazy shit yeah but that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>ecosystem yeah you you</p>
<p>would have to i mean i have to get</p>
<p>water if you have a bottle</p>
<p>no you have to get</p>
<p>water that has</p>
<p>no life in it and the only way to get that is</p>
<p>water from a</p>
<p>stream because</p>
<p>it gets filtered down and you know when you get</p>
<p>water from a lake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>water and then</p>
<p>reservoirs are like lakes</p>
<p>so they have to fill</p>
<p>them up with chemical so that nothing grows in them</p>
<p>why does bottle</p>
<p>water never get more</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s spring</p>
<p>water fucker</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s what i was talking about</p>
<p>well the other</p>
<p>stuff that they kill</p>
<p>everything in it they process it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s filtered</p>
<p>that like dasani water</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s what i was talking</p>
<p>about that you were talking</p>
<p>about i hate</p>
<p>dasani water</p>
<p>yeah hate tap</p>
<p>water i don&rsquo;t like any</p>
<p>water that goes</p>
<p>when i open it yeah</p>
<p>why is my fucking</p>
<p>water making a</p>
<p>noise my water is</p>
<p>queefing that&rsquo;s unhealthy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>the coca cola company that&rsquo;s actually the same</p>
<p>water just without the syrup</p>
<p>they use the same machines really just don&rsquo;t put the</p>
<p>syrup in it i was told it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy though that</p>
<p>we have so many people</p>
<p>so far away from natural resources that we have to</p>
<p>poison the water</p>
<p>we have to poison the</p>
<p>water to make</p>
<p>sure nothing grows in it so you can use it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of crazy</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up buddy</p>
<p>hey guys hi</p>
<p>welcome to the podcast</p>
<p>thank you sir you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being listened to by hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pleasure to have you i&rsquo;m getting aroused</p>
<p>i saw jim i saw you</p>
<p>maybe a year year and a half ago at a club</p>
<p>here in town and</p>
<p>but this question for all you guys</p>
<p>i got a distinct</p>
<p>difference and feeling of like the people the</p>
<p>crowds here in la and the crowds back east</p>
<p>are you getting and i know jimmy you play a ton</p>
<p>back east and we get you out here sometimes not enough</p>
<p>but we get you out here sometimes</p>
<p>is there a do you feel it</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re out here</p>
<p>or is there something you can deal with</p>
<p>compared to being back home i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re much different because i&rsquo;m the same</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you think like san francisco would be a very</p>
<p>tougher place to perform well they&rsquo;re politically their</p>
<p>ideology is much different</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re phenomenal crowds austin texas very very</p>
<p>ultra liberal side</p>
<p>fucking i saw you in</p>
<p>phenomenal time it was</p>
<p>great fucking crowds</p>
<p>so the politics</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s the vibe of the city never matters to me</p>
<p>if you do what you do and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>funny i think the</p>
<p>crowds normally</p>
<p>will respond but in all fairness you&rsquo;re at the</p>
<p>point where you get your own</p>
<p>crowd it does matter when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting out it makes a huge difference that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>point when we</p>
<p>started out</p>
<p>jimmy and i</p>
<p>started very</p>
<p>close together when i met you was like what 90 19 the</p>
<p>quarter deck</p>
<p>i saw you we did i</p>
<p>think i hosted you middled</p>
<p>and i forget</p>
<p>who closed on something couldn&rsquo;t follow you</p>
<p>it was the quarter deck</p>
<p>for pat corrini i believe</p>
<p>wow where was that it was in the</p>
<p>lake roncakama</p>
<p>in new jersey damn is that</p>
<p>jersey or new york that&rsquo;s new york that&rsquo;s long no no no</p>
<p>no this was in lake</p>
<p>something it was a lake hapak kong</p>
<p>hapak kong new jersey i</p>
<p>think it was a gig we did</p>
<p>it was a fucking</p>
<p>it was like a deck it was weird</p>
<p>was it a bob gonzo gig</p>
<p>it might have</p>
<p>been at that time bob gonzo was a guy in jersey and</p>
<p>he had booked hell rooms in jersey</p>
<p>shore before there was a tv show jersey</p>
<p>shore yeah this wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>this was not the</p>
<p>shore this was somewhere in a lake</p>
<p>around like a padcon</p>
<p>in new jersey</p>
<p>i did a lot of gigs in jersey</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know when it was but it was like</p>
<p>1990 ish it wasn&rsquo;t good</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not a good gig</p>
<p>when you start out</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>stand up and no one knows who you are then audiences</p>
<p>matter then it really matters</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>and you see</p>
<p>a big difference between performing in boston</p>
<p>as opposed to performing in</p>
<p>rhode island or</p>
<p>connecticut</p>
<p>or something like that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>and a lot of times it&rsquo;s better when you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>places where they appreciate</p>
<p>that someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually performing they have something to do there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing in</p>
<p>those towns</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>drive a long time to do comedy</p>
<p>but when you get to a point</p>
<p>where jim&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>what happens is you get your own audience</p>
<p>and then the people are pretty much the same everywhere</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real weird</p>
<p>like in new</p>
<p>york i did some shows this weekend at gotham</p>
<p>might as well have been right here</p>
<p>might as well</p>
<p>have been at the improv it was really just a bunch of</p>
<p>people that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>think like me</p>
<p>yes it is harder when</p>
<p>you that&rsquo;s true because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have after a</p>
<p>while you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>prove yourself</p>
<p>you thought to be funny</p>
<p>but they kind of give you the benefit of the</p>
<p>doubt before you go on so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be judging you on every</p>
<p>single idea do i</p>
<p>agree do i disagree they kind of know</p>
<p>who you are and what you do and they&rsquo;re okay with it</p>
<p>and the beginning</p>
<p>is always the hardest part when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>stage and people don&rsquo;t know who you are</p>
<p>because the beginning is who the fuck is this guy and</p>
<p>depending on how you&rsquo;re dressed</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re worried</p>
<p>about that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worried about what kind of</p>
<p>image you&rsquo;re portraying</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>get acceptance</p>
<p>so when you have acceptance already when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going on stage it&rsquo;s way easier</p>
<p>yeah yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting already</p>
<p>if you suck eventually they&rsquo;ll let you know but i</p>
<p>think if you got a couple of minutes</p>
<p>yeah if you&rsquo;re not i</p>
<p>never mail it</p>
<p>in so if you&rsquo;re not mailing it in they&rsquo;ll at least</p>
<p>appreciate that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving them a good show</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s to me the</p>
<p>grossest thing</p>
<p>when someone gets to a</p>
<p>point where they&rsquo;ve got a lot of</p>
<p>success and they</p>
<p>completely take it for</p>
<p>granted and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appreciate that all</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>have come to see him they just come take it for</p>
<p>granted and just accept it</p>
<p>you know they just</p>
<p>expect it you know that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>grossest thing when you hear</p>
<p>about guys and they get to a certain level</p>
<p>and they just give up they just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care anymore and they hate</p>
<p>their audience you know</p>
<p>yeah but la crowds are fine</p>
<p>you know what i mean i have no problem here</p>
<p>like some crowds are more touchier</p>
<p>like with la they&rsquo;ll be a little touchier</p>
<p>about a gay reference</p>
<p>than they would be</p>
<p>about a racial</p>
<p>reference but here in this city they&rsquo;d be a little</p>
<p>more touchier</p>
<p>that type of stuff you notice but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really affect what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>but some clubs though</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big difference between the vibe at</p>
<p>a comedy store</p>
<p>and the vibe at</p>
<p>the improv it all depends on how the place is being run</p>
<p>now that does i</p>
<p>never do well at the laugh factory because</p>
<p>they like a younger</p>
<p>funner energy</p>
<p>than i have like you know what i mean like that like</p>
<p>they like a different energy dane cook</p>
<p>their energy works</p>
<p>very well there</p>
<p>mine does not</p>
<p>you know what i mean because they</p>
<p>would go up and murder and</p>
<p>literally then i&rsquo;ll go up</p>
<p>and they just won&rsquo;t enjoy</p>
<p>my observations they just</p>
<p>and they get it i</p>
<p>never think a crowd</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get me i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>the fuck they get it they just find they don&rsquo;t enjoy it</p>
<p>is that the most</p>
<p>annoying thing</p>
<p>ever when a guy tells a shitty joke and they go okay</p>
<p>went over your head there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>worse than when a comedian</p>
<p>thinks they don&rsquo;t get him it&rsquo;s like what do you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re not what</p>
<p>are you you&rsquo;re not giving up physics equations you</p>
<p>talk yeah they</p>
<p>thought you the fuck</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst anything else</p>
<p>no that was perfect</p>
<p>i went past the my</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;s a bevy of questions</p>
<p>as i go how i do it</p>
<p>this is a fun little thing though</p>
<p>right this kind of weird to do it like this</p>
<p>hey guys don hey sir what&rsquo;s going on not much</p>
<p>i just want to talk about los angeles for a second</p>
<p>you guys know how much the tickets are for those</p>
<p>flashes is that not working is that mike not working</p>
<p>hello i got to get close to it yeah</p>
<p>you guys know how much those tickets are at the street</p>
<p>light those flashes i was making a right hand turn</p>
<p>how much four hundred eighty dollars whoa</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s that money going</p>
<p>um to make right turn cameras yeah</p>
<p>the technology is amazing</p>
<p>they have my face they got my</p>
<p>license plate you can tell like what</p>
<p>month my things gonna expire</p>
<p>that bugs me man if you&rsquo;re not there to bust me i win</p>
<p>you know you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>catch me like that that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>especially right turn on reds</p>
<p>silly as shit i got a</p>
<p>i got a ticket the</p>
<p>other day for not stopping completely</p>
<p>i did to i just did this i got up</p>
<p>and then i kind of went</p>
<p>and went and i barely stopped</p>
<p>but i did sort i</p>
<p>definitely fucking slow down i didn&rsquo;t just enter</p>
<p>into the intersection</p>
<p>like a fucking wild person</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so silly though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a cop saw you or a camera saw you do that cop</p>
<p>he actually gave me a warning</p>
<p>but it pulled me over for</p>
<p>it you know there&rsquo;s a lot of shit to pull people over</p>
<p>slowing down not enough you know</p>
<p>stupid it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stupid you have to stop and go abc one two</p>
<p>three so now my fucking two year old</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s every time we go to a stop sign she goes</p>
<p>abc one two three</p>
<p>she does it</p>
<p>everywhere so</p>
<p>everywhere we go she</p>
<p>counts it&rsquo;s kind of cute that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great excuse for the cop to like i knew</p>
<p>she said abc one two</p>
<p>three okay sorry</p>
<p>so that was it you just want to talk</p>
<p>about the camera that fucked you over</p>
<p>fuck that camera dude</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking nonsense man</p>
<p>you know in europe it&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>creepier because in europe they have</p>
<p>speed cameras</p>
<p>and they catch you when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>like they are</p>
<p>they have it in arizona well</p>
<p>in europe they actually have</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s built into your gps</p>
<p>so as you&rsquo;re driving it tells you in australia as well</p>
<p>in australia it tells you</p>
<p>speed camera</p>
<p>section and you slow down</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>know yeah it&rsquo;s crazy when we were in australia</p>
<p>we noticed that the gps</p>
<p>thing of the</p>
<p>guy that was driving us around was doing that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like nuts man like</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s watching you from the sky</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to drive reckless anymore</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to be</p>
<p>considered of</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>yeah really</p>
<p>catch twenty two like where does the right of me</p>
<p>right break the law and</p>
<p>and the right of other people to be safe right in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like people that say i can drive drunk</p>
<p>other people can&rsquo;t fucking handle it you like damn man</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not confident in you</p>
<p>you want to</p>
<p>be this guy here too and someone up there who</p>
<p>hello okay did someone up there have one</p>
<p>okay let me get this guy after</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>quick so no no i&rsquo;m not rushing okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a question for everyone but it</p>
<p>started with something joe said</p>
<p>it was to jim saying that</p>
<p>well you know your perv</p>
<p>and you accept that you&rsquo;re a perv but</p>
<p>you know you function well in society you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>productive you&rsquo;re creative</p>
<p>you know i think that</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible though obviously that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obviously not the only high functioning pervert</p>
<p>but like he can you know like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a unicorn bro</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of high functioning pervert</p>
<p>so they get caught then you realize oh he was a</p>
<p>clinton didn&rsquo;t just get his dick sucked by one</p>
<p>fatty believe me</p>
<p>well clinton was a whip his dick out in meetings guy</p>
<p>he would like take a chance</p>
<p>like be talking to a girl and just pull his cock out</p>
<p>thinking that you&rsquo;d just</p>
<p>freak out and just</p>
<p>start sucking it</p>
<p>and apparently it had to have worked a</p>
<p>bunch of times</p>
<p>for him to be</p>
<p>so confident that he just whip it out all the time</p>
<p>but when he was in arkansas</p>
<p>apparently he was just a</p>
<p>monster yeah</p>
<p>doing what you should do</p>
<p>but you know what</p>
<p>the real reality is that</p>
<p>to get a person</p>
<p>that really wants to be in charge like that</p>
<p>the person who really wants to like work 16</p>
<p>hours a day to try to run the government</p>
<p>they want to be the fucking man</p>
<p>they really do that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the only type of person that wants to run for president</p>
<p>the type of person that wants to be the</p>
<p>fucking man like that also wants to get his dick sucked</p>
<p>you know they want reverence they want</p>
<p>yeah needs it yeah he&rsquo;s a fucking freak</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what you get</p>
<p>otherwise you get a shitty president</p>
<p>like jimmy carter</p>
<p>jimmy carter</p>
<p>would never whip his dick out no one was scared of him</p>
<p>you know he couldn&rsquo;t get a goddamn</p>
<p>thing done because</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know how to pull his cock out</p>
<p>it just go well ma&rsquo;am it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a getting late</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>going home when</p>
<p>will clinton</p>
<p>an hour earlier</p>
<p>would have had his cock in her mouth</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>was closing deals like a</p>
<p>motherfucker son</p>
<p>clinton closed deals dude</p>
<p>i mean he lost a lot of them at the bargaining</p>
<p>table but that</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>closed a lot of deals that the average person</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s some people you know</p>
<p>everybody has been in a situation in life</p>
<p>where you like really</p>
<p>like i met a girl once in connecticut</p>
<p>and i got off</p>
<p>stage i was like</p>
<p>nineteen fucking eighty nine or something like that</p>
<p>and she was so pretty</p>
<p>and she came up to me</p>
<p>and she goes she goes that was really</p>
<p>funny i think you&rsquo;re really hot i go yeah</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s all i go like really</p>
<p>she goes you want to get out here and fuck</p>
<p>i went okay and i didn&rsquo;t even know her name</p>
<p>and we were having sex like 20 minutes</p>
<p>later we&rsquo;re in my hotel room having sex</p>
<p>every now and then that does happen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll meet some completely crazy person</p>
<p>so with a guy like clinton</p>
<p>he was just like come on seven just just</p>
<p>everywhere he goes he was just scratching off tickets</p>
<p>like what do we got here oh you&rsquo;re normal</p>
<p>sorry sorry</p>
<p>put my dick back in my pants</p>
<p>i just thought</p>
<p>maybe you were a fucking</p>
<p>crazy freak</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re willing to throw down</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there that will</p>
<p>appreciate it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people out there that like getting choked</p>
<p>you know some girls if you&rsquo;re having sex with them you</p>
<p>choke them they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get mad at you like hey let go of my neck</p>
<p>but other girls go oh fuck yeah</p>
<p>all right we got a winner we got a winner here</p>
<p>you never know</p>
<p>until you try you know how</p>
<p>do you breach the subject of taking a shit in someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chest right</p>
<p>shut the door</p>
<p>yeah normally</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;ll do is i&rsquo;ll drop one of rob schneider&rsquo;s</p>
<p>movies on her</p>
<p>chest and go how do you feel about that</p>
<p>oh and you know what i have to be honest</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really even have</p>
<p>i ever seen a rob schneider</p>
<p>movie it&rsquo;s a good one</p>
<p>to like he&rsquo;s got enough enemies and it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>valid okay were you done with your questions or no</p>
<p>yeah well i mean just cause for me it was the</p>
<p>first time i forget what we were talking about</p>
<p>yeah just how</p>
<p>high functioning perverts</p>
<p>and just the idea like</p>

<p>so it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>two women older younger that want</p>
<p>lesbian experiences or a guy to follow no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what it is it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re like oh we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to this new job interview</p>
<p>and they just sit down and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like an</p>
<p>older woman</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>teenager looking girl with like the pigtails</p>
<p>sure and then she&rsquo;ll be like</p>
<p>so i brought my</p>
<p>daughter to come and</p>
<p>get to know</p>
<p>about the industry</p>
<p>since i do porn</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like okay well show me your ass show me your tits</p>
<p>and then you know they&rsquo;ll do this</p>
<p>about five or six different times is it real</p>
<p>no no no obviously they&rsquo;re not real</p>
<p>daughters no</p>
<p>is there no</p>
<p>but i mean that you know they buy into like they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>brian has a lot of</p>
<p>experience about the porn industry</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>dated porn stars he</p>
<p>could pretty much tell you exactly</p>
<p>were you molested or do you like that i mean oh no like</p>
<p>always had a</p>
<p>thing for older</p>
<p>women and then like how old</p>
<p>well like sophia</p>
<p>lorraine no like yeah</p>
<p>when you were saying sophia</p>
<p>lorraine it was like no i would</p>
<p>you would i</p>
<p>would you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see yourself just because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sophia</p>
<p>lorraine it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>monster you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking of</p>
<p>smells are you</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking of</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>i always thought</p>
<p>like what if they came up with some sort of a</p>
<p>thing that they</p>
<p>could turn an old person into a</p>
<p>young person like they can regenerate your tissue</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s not far outside of the realm</p>
<p>of science the ability to figure out how to regenerate</p>
<p>but what if they</p>
<p>could turn an old lady</p>
<p>into a young</p>
<p>chick she still</p>
<p>smell like an old lady</p>
<p>grandma just</p>
<p>started fucking all your friends</p>
<p>your grandma was a hot</p>
<p>bitch all the</p>
<p>sudden she was like</p>
<p>twenty yeah</p>
<p>and your grandma</p>
<p>like grandma why are you fucking my friends</p>
<p>and then she&rsquo;s jerking you</p>
<p>often hear the charm bracelet jiggling</p>
<p>she looks like</p>
<p>tracy lords when she smells like barbara walters</p>
<p>just smells like an old rotten husk</p>
<p>rotten old fucking leather bag</p>
<p>like a goddamn catcher</p>
<p>smith that some fat guy i&rsquo;ve been wearing for a month</p>
<p>wait a second</p>
<p>wait a second</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hot as fuck and you have to</p>
<p>spray her with her esther</p>
<p>has a really old name and she hmm</p>
<p>science bro</p>
<p>science someday i like the fact that</p>
<p>you said like i don&rsquo;t want to give out too many details</p>
<p>well and then it all just came</p>
<p>the whole point was</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t want to take up too</p>
<p>much time because i know there&rsquo;s a lot of people here</p>
<p>oh please man don&rsquo;t be humbled this</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;re here for there&rsquo;s more for this</p>
<p>you sound like a</p>
<p>freak with an interesting story no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty much that&rsquo;s pretty much me</p>
<p>but is it a</p>
<p>i like that kind of</p>
<p>point i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>wrong with that i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s just looking for variety of something new</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ll look at old lady porn</p>
<p>and not because i want to fucking old</p>
<p>ladies because</p>
<p>wow this girl has her</p>
<p>pussy i&rsquo;ve never seen an old lady&rsquo;s pussy</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>is that why you</p>
<p>think you do it or are you</p>
<p>interested in it well i&rsquo;ll tell you well</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s all coming out now</p>
<p>when i was a</p>
<p>kid you know i&rsquo;d go to church and there&rsquo;d be like all</p>
<p>these sexy older</p>
<p>ladies you know oh yeah</p>
<p>church you know</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where like the the real repressed</p>
<p>sexuality is there because you know what religion</p>
<p>just christianity</p>
<p>no no i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do catholicism or anything like that so i</p>
<p>would go to church and you know the</p>
<p>women would have</p>
<p>these nice tight outfits so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be a thing you&rsquo;d have like your</p>
<p>whole how old were you</p>
<p>you know i grew up in church so probably five to 13</p>
<p>yeah so even when you were little you just</p>
<p>hawking on these bitches oh yeah</p>
<p>eagle that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why when i found the</p>
<p>yeah when i</p>
<p>found fuck my mom and me i was like no they finally</p>

<p>start it is just kind of get</p>
<p>ahead of the game a little</p>
<p>the success of joe&rsquo;s we might as</p>
<p>well we thought hey we</p>
<p>might as well just have a</p>
<p>whole bunch of podcasts with all our friends</p>
<p>and then we</p>
<p>could all work together</p>
<p>and bounce off each other</p>
<p>so yeah in the future</p>
<p>definitely i mean i</p>
<p>would love to do that you know and the death</p>
<p>squad name came</p>
<p>from when we were on the opie and anthony show</p>
<p>opie yeah opie</p>

<p>started repeating it and then we just</p>

<p>everything so it&rsquo;d be really awesome to get that</p>
<p>on well we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna keep going with all this shit it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>definitely accelerate</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s gonna lead but</p>
<p>you know one of the</p>
<p>things that i&rsquo;m most fortunate</p>
<p>about is that i</p>
<p>have a lot of cool friends i have a lot of interesting</p>
<p>friends and we have cool conversations and this</p>
<p>podcast has really sort of reinforced that you know</p>
<p>reminds me of the bumper</p>
<p>sticker i created it says one for all and all for one</p>
<p>i sell it after shows arms are for huggings my favorite</p>
<p>until someone breaks in your fucking house</p>
<p>i got a fast one</p>
<p>have you your mics off</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re panicking</p>
<p>okay this one&rsquo;s pretty much for joe</p>
<p>have you ever shroomed in the isolation chamber no</p>
<p>mostly i eat pot and go in there that&rsquo;s my favorite</p>
<p>thing that seems to be the scariest rod</p>
<p>is eating it and going in there</p>
<p>i like to eat enough so that i&rsquo;m fucking terrified of</p>
<p>everything and then i climb in</p>
<p>jimmy have you ever shroomed at all</p>
<p>me yeah have you ever</p>
<p>done any psychedelics at all no i used to do mescaline</p>
<p>which would make me laugh a lot</p>
<p>psychedelic that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>san pedro cactus</p>
<p>but i never did</p>
<p>acid i never because people</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t take it with me they thought i</p>
<p>would have a fucking problem</p>
<p>so i never did acid i never did</p>
<p>any type of psychedelics because i was i</p>
<p>think they would have been bad for me i</p>
<p>really that&rsquo;s buzzy that&rsquo;s a bummer to me</p>
<p>you never know they</p>
<p>might have been really good for you yeah it</p>
<p>might have been the thing that opened the door to your</p>
<p>one of the number one things for addiction insiders</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things that people use for addiction</p>
<p>ebagin is a big one and</p>
<p>ayahuasca is another big one and they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>super intense introspective psychedelics</p>
<p>and they cure a lot of people of</p>
<p>drug addiction obsessive compulsive</p>
<p>behavior oh</p>
<p>really all sorts of personality issues yeah yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s illegal in america of course</p>
<p>but you can go to mexico and they have ebegain</p>
<p>ebogain ebogain don&rsquo;t know how to say it</p>
<p>they have clinics down there</p>
<p>where you go and take it and my friend ed</p>
<p>went down there and it changed his whole life</p>
<p>ed clay he owns a jiu jitsu</p>
<p>school in nashville</p>
<p>and it completely</p>
<p>changed his life he&rsquo;s a totally different human being</p>
<p>after you had that</p>
<p>experience like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like literally</p>
<p>i think a real</p>
<p>strong psychedelic</p>
<p>experience is like you</p>
<p>know meeting the divine</p>
<p>it really is like that like it brings you</p>
<p>to some place that</p>
<p>allows you to see what&rsquo;s possible out of</p>
<p>humans out of thinking out of life out of the universe</p>
<p>and then you come back into this</p>
<p>world of shit and you try to make the better of it</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t do any type of drugs</p>
<p>you ever think about it though</p>
<p>have you ever thought about anything</p>
<p>about like psychedelics</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>but i can&rsquo;t i know i don&rsquo;t trust myself</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve proven that i cannot handle it</p>
<p>right so you don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s intoxicating</p>
<p>but you were what 15 women when i was</p>
<p>18 i got over</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the risk is not worth it what i</p>
<p>would lose i would lose everything it&rsquo;s not worth it</p>
<p>right i can&rsquo;t do it joe can do it and have a</p>
<p>great career</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;d be a great stand up and have a fucking ufc</p>
<p>like you know he</p>
<p>does his stuff</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t miss anything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a part of his life but for me it overtakes me</p>
<p>like i can&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>i had to write at the comedy</p>
<p>seller so i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t just jerk off</p>
<p>so you did all</p>
<p>your writing like there during the day as it was not</p>
<p>bad no no no</p>
<p>no this is as long as i was doing a book and i had</p>
<p>to now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better so when you were doing the book though you would</p>
<p>just show up there with a laptop i</p>
<p>would do four sets on a saturday and</p>
<p>three on a friday</p>
<p>i would just</p>
<p>write in between and</p>
<p>there would be enough</p>
<p>noise distraction i need some distraction when i write</p>
<p>a little buzz in the comedians talking</p>
<p>but it will be good for me</p>
<p>i still will</p>
<p>write there sometimes though at night</p>
<p>but only what i&rsquo;m doing is set</p>
<p>wow you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a program that i talk</p>
<p>about on the podcast all the time it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>right room and it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>activate it obviously but what it is is once you do it</p>
<p>the screen is totally</p>
<p>black and you just have green text</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t access any of the programs</p>
<p>and then you have to hit escape</p>
<p>to go back to your normal window</p>
<p>right yeah but it&rsquo;s amazing use a mac or a pc</p>
<p>i use a mac yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for a mac</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll show it to you it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>it helps me</p>
<p>from checking my twitter</p>
<p>looking on facebook writing that</p>
<p>stupid shit</p>
<p>you know those distractions</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>thing that comics all seem to</p>
<p>share this obsession thing</p>

<p>gambling and playing poker</p>

<p>maybe you know</p>
<p>you know what it is man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s kind of creepy about</p>
<p>planning out beating off and that&rsquo;s what people have</p>
<p>a problem with sex toys and pocket</p>
<p>pussies like really you used your credit card like</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you actually went out of your way like now i&rsquo;m</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s something one if you&rsquo;re jerking off in the shower</p>

<p>but if you go out and buy a pocket</p>
<p>pussy she&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>right here motherfucker you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s afraid charles bronson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna kill me you know what this is for it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>jacking off</p>
<p>in ten to midnight that guy with the</p>
<p>great ass who was killing women naked</p>
<p>warren</p>
<p>next person who&rsquo;s got the mic</p>
<p>jack and all he was who&rsquo;s next</p>
<p>how do you guys know who&rsquo;s next</p>
<p>yeah this question&rsquo;s for joe i was wondering</p>
<p>about when you go on</p>
<p>the tank and</p>
<p>lose yourself and you say you go on the hulu safety</p>
<p>hallucination trips is that like a dmt or a psilocybin</p>
<p>trip or is it</p>
<p>a completely different trip when you go in there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s similar you know it depends on how</p>
<p>relaxed you get</p>
<p>how you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very very difficult to let go</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve never had a sensory deprivation tank</p>
<p>experience and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking about it i</p>
<p>should just say this to anybody who&rsquo;s listening</p>
<p>google where to float</p>
<p>just google that term and there&rsquo;s a website</p>
<p>that you can go to that lists there&rsquo;s two of them</p>
<p>they list all the different</p>
<p>places all across the country we</p>
<p>could rent tanks</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch in la there&rsquo;s a few rather</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to find them in</p>
<p>other parts of the country</p>
<p>the big thing is</p>
<p>about letting go</p>
<p>the big thing is</p>
<p>about learning how to</p>
<p>relax that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>should look into jimmy</p>
<p>see you don&rsquo;t want to do drugs</p>
<p>the isolation</p>
<p>tank i know they have them in new york i guarantee you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that tell me they</p>
<p>float in new york all the time i get</p>
<p>emails from people</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s good though to</p>
<p>float i would feel</p>
<p>fantastic it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great for your body too</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>relaxing it&rsquo;s really good for your muscles and your</p>
<p>alignment and</p>
<p>everything out i</p>
<p>hear my back popping sometimes when i&rsquo;m in there</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>zero gravity</p>
<p>usually a couple</p>
<p>hours at a time i usually do</p>
<p>about two hours at a time you do like at night</p>
<p>yeah i do when everybody&rsquo;s asleep</p>
<p>i like to do when there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>least amount of possible energy there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>least amount of movement i want</p>
<p>everything still</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want it just</p>
<p>quiet i want to make it</p>
<p>i want to maximize the idea of the sensory deprivation</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what it is it&rsquo;s a tank that&rsquo;s filled with</p>
<p>water and the water has</p>
<p>salt in it 800</p>
<p>pounds of salt</p>
<p>and when you lie in it the temperature of the</p>
<p>water is the same temperature</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s heated to the same temperature as your skin</p>
<p>so you have no sensory</p>
<p>input you don&rsquo;t feel the</p>
<p>water you&rsquo;re floating</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t hear anything your ears are underwater</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>total silence</p>
<p>total darkness</p>
<p>and in the absence of sensory</p>
<p>input your brain just kind of goes</p>
<p>crazy how do</p>
<p>you breathe though i&rsquo;m claustrophobic a little but that</p>
<p>would drive me nuts yeah</p>
<p>if my ears had</p>
<p>water on them</p>
<p>but my nose didn&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>would just keep hearing myself like i am now</p>
<p>and i would do this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna try</p>
<p>that tonight you have to i can do it for hour</p>
<p>i do it into a vagina that really</p>
<p>creeps a girl out</p>
<p>yeah yeah next</p>
<p>time you eating</p>
<p>pussy just go eh</p>
<p>me you gonna come back down to san diego and do a</p>
<p>stand up show soon</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ll definitely go back to san</p>
<p>diego again i</p>
<p>think i remember when the last time was there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a while</p>
<p>house of blues</p>
<p>house of blues yeah</p>
<p>i have a problem</p>
<p>with venues</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>the problem is i don&rsquo;t want people to have to stand up</p>
<p>and a lot of the bigger</p>
<p>places that you do when you</p>
<p>start doing like</p>
<p>house of blues</p>
<p>usually they seat</p>
<p>about 600 people but they</p>
<p>can have standing like 1100</p>
<p>and i always say well i only want a standing</p>
<p>seated show</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>first person that i ever</p>
<p>heard say that actually</p>
<p>i heard you say that on opie and anthony</p>
<p>and i was like what&rsquo;s the big deal</p>
<p>like who cares if it was a seated show or a</p>
<p>standing show because there was some dispute</p>
<p>about one of your shows</p>
<p>and then i went to see stanhope in la</p>
<p>and i was in the audience</p>
<p>and it was some fucking bar that he had this</p>
<p>crazy show at and we had to</p>
<p>stand up the whole time</p>
<p>after half an hour</p>
<p>my fucking back hurts man this is not comfortable</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not comfortable</p>
<p>yeah brian was</p>
<p>right with me</p>
<p>and i decided then there and then i</p>
<p>would never do a</p>
<p>standing show</p>
<p>again i never do</p>
<p>standing shows i take less</p>
<p>money or i wind</p>
<p>up doing two shows because seated is just a better show</p>
<p>and we caught a</p>
<p>promoter lying</p>
<p>about the standing room sometimes in some of the</p>
<p>house of blues they&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>standing room but they tell you</p>
<p>about it and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowing them to sell x amount of</p>
<p>standing tickets but i know that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is and people know when they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>but this one</p>
<p>place in dc we caught the</p>
<p>promoter trying some</p>
<p>sneaky shit what place</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember it was actually a theater</p>
<p>some theater in down</p>
<p>dc or virginia</p>
<p>and my agent</p>
<p>my road manager club sort of</p>
<p>kenny caught them and then my</p>
<p>agent fucking jumped on live nation it was like a</p>
<p>local live nation</p>
<p>thing and ooh</p>
<p>did we make him pay for a late show</p>
<p>ooh he fucked him good</p>
<p>the canyon club is the last</p>
<p>place that fuck me the canyon club in gory hills</p>
<p>we had a very specific</p>
<p>language in the contract that we&rsquo;re not supposed to be</p>
<p>standing people</p>
<p>and i went there</p>
<p>with people</p>
<p>stand there&rsquo;s so many fucking people</p>
<p>standing there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like well we always do this for every show</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>you read the contract</p>
<p>motherfucker you know what it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>other comics don&rsquo;t have a problem with people</p>
<p>standing like</p>
<p>so i just did it we had a</p>
<p>fucking x amount of people this is how many it will fit</p>
<p>and we made them flip</p>
<p>into a late show we didn&rsquo;t know they were making people</p>
<p>they would just</p>
<p>cut the line outside and said you guys got to come</p>
<p>back to a late show i didn&rsquo;t know they were doing that</p>
<p>we made them actually pay me for a</p>
<p>second show because</p>
<p>we were so mad i&rsquo;m like i don&rsquo;t want my fans standing</p>
<p>they told us that</p>
<p>a bunch of people just ran up and bought tickets</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like well then we&rsquo;ll do two shows i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna do that good for you yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>annoying standing</p>
<p>stand up for not</p>
<p>standing up yeah yeah</p>
<p>next person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got it who&rsquo;s gets it okay</p>
<p>how do you guys know you&rsquo;re so organized</p>
<p>this is the politest little audience ever</p>
<p>hey joe hey</p>
<p>kind of bringing it back to the flotation tanks</p>
<p>again i know you&rsquo;ve mentioned a place called</p>
<p>float lab i was checking them out online</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in venice the float labs in venice</p>
<p>have you actually been in one of</p>
<p>those tanks yeah i have one of those in my house</p>
<p>yeah do you have the ones with the</p>
<p>screen i don&rsquo;t understand no no</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m not into that what is that for all the</p>
<p>water would leak out sir no he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s referring to the guy who is the designer of</p>
<p>the tanks at float lab</p>
<p>has this invention</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a screen where you can watch documentaries</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re floating</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>speakers that are under the water</p>
<p>and you can the sound apparently</p>
<p>the sound wise is supposed to be incredible</p>
<p>he has these speakers rigged up</p>
<p>and apparently you feel the vibration of the</p>
<p>sound through your entire body because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>underwater but i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not into that i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>escape from all input</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to cut out most input and then</p>
<p>throw in something that&rsquo;s going to be magnified</p>
<p>you know but the idea is that you</p>
<p>could learn much better when you&rsquo;re in the tank you</p>
<p>could learn languages</p>
<p>and all kinds of shit like that and</p>
<p>then you might as well just sit in your bathtub and</p>
<p>watch tv then</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>point you know what i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>defeating the</p>
<p>number well</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re weightless your body&rsquo;s weightless</p>
<p>in there and the idea is that you&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>even when you&rsquo;re sitting there watching a</p>
<p>movie like sometimes like damn my butt&rsquo;s numb and you</p>
<p>gotta like move your butt</p>
<p>to the side or something like that you know what i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re dealing with a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>a bunch of different</p>
<p>sensory inputs into your brain you</p>
<p>get out of the tank or you just piss</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t piss in there i piss</p>
<p>right before i go in</p>
<p>i get out but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t jerk off in there either but i want to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when i know i should get out of the tank when i</p>
<p>start thinking i should just beat off right now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s time to get out i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>clearly lost my touch with the universe sure</p>
<p>if your penis</p>
<p>is brought it right back around to my dick</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the valve</p>
<p>the valve of the id</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be afraid of getting salt in my asshole</p>
<p>yeah it feels good</p>
<p>does it really feels good in your cleansing too</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s good yeah</p>
<p>chips away the rust</p>
<p>also brian i was wondering if you ever</p>
<p>ended up trying out the flotation</p>
<p>no he keeps on offering but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s scared</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not scared i know</p>
<p>i just i i&rsquo;ve talked to so many people that i</p>
<p>think that have tried it that i feel like i</p>
<p>would be exactly like that person</p>
<p>where what do you think</p>
<p>where i think i&rsquo;ll lay there i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;m gonna be</p>
<p>tripping i think i&rsquo;ll be relaxed but i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you know sees fucking</p>
<p>jesus or anything like that you don&rsquo;t always see jesus</p>
<p>it takes a long time but for</p>
<p>relaxing i&rsquo;m fine just laying around fucking</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m bad you say that dude</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s weightlessness</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really if if you could take</p>
<p>it in a pill form what it does to you in the tank</p>
<p>it would be fucking credible</p>
<p>if you could take a pill</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>holy shit it&rsquo;s kicking in i</p>
<p>gotta lie down</p>
<p>i gotta lie down</p>
<p>oh my god i&rsquo;m flying through fucking space</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t feel my body</p>
<p>i have no attachment to any input</p>
<p>oh my god i&rsquo;m detached</p>
<p>to the universe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re untethered your</p>
<p>brain becomes untethered to the</p>
<p>whole world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>lying down man yeah but mushrooms is</p>
<p>cheaper and you</p>
<p>could do it with a girl</p>
<p>mushrooms are</p>
<p>great nothing</p>
<p>wrong with mushrooms it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>experience though to be</p>
<p>completely removed from your body in the tank</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something different yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very natural and it&rsquo;s really good for you</p>
<p>you get out of there you feel good like you feel like</p>
<p>energized and</p>
<p>charged it releases</p>
<p>an incredible amount of muscle tension that you</p>
<p>carry around with you</p>
<p>because just</p>
<p>standing there</p>
<p>just having posture</p>
<p>your muscles are constantly</p>
<p>moving and working just to keep your</p>
<p>spine erect</p>
<p>but when you get in there it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you let everything go and you flying</p>
<p>and once your</p>
<p>brain gets the</p>
<p>first thing that happens is you</p>
<p>start wanting to itch</p>
<p>things you start</p>
<p>thinking my balls itch i</p>
<p>should itch my balls</p>
<p>with them and get salt on them it&rsquo;ll be more itchy you</p>
<p>start thinking weird shit</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really your</p>
<p>brain is giving you</p>
<p>busy work because it can&rsquo;t believe it has nothing to do</p>
<p>your mind can&rsquo;t believe i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to move anything i don&rsquo;t feel it i&rsquo;m not processing any</p>
<p>input nothing</p>
<p>because once you</p>
<p>completely center and stop moving</p>
<p>you really lose the feeling of the</p>
<p>water really</p>
<p>rapidly because in the</p>
<p>first 5 10 minutes you don&rsquo;t even feel the</p>
<p>water anymore</p>
<p>especially once you get good at it and</p>
<p>you become conditioned to the kind of experience</p>
<p>i recommend it for everybody man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great for self analysis</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most amazing</p>
<p>thing about it</p>
<p>self analysis and</p>
<p>relaxation it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>tremendous thanks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>who else one day i</p>
<p>might try it i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>come on over tomorrow fucker</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not going to do yours i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust your scary</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t come in it and why that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be afraid of laying there in a lily pad</p>
<p>floats on your</p>
<p>cheek yeah yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a wise man</p>
<p>because my loads will drag you down into the plumbing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll find you once</p>
<p>again there he is hold on</p>
<p>stay inert until he gets in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s convenient</p>
<p>that saltwater to you know yeah it&rsquo;s all nice and white</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s talking about</p>
<p>tripping balls</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to note the guy from the salvia</p>

<p>it was a totally</p>
<p>controlled scenario</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t actually have the keys in my hand but the</p>
<p>point is that</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m like a host and i&rsquo;m doing it very politely</p>

<p>seconds i&rsquo;m gone what people</p>

<p>crazy than marijuana and you can buy it almost</p>
<p>every state in the country</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>super powerful</p>
<p>psychedelic one of the most</p>
<p>powerful but</p>
<p>when they had that</p>
<p>sweeping legislation that</p>
<p>they passed in the 1970 or whatever the fuck it was</p>
<p>when they made</p>
<p>everything illegal</p>
<p>they missed that one</p>
<p>you know some of my</p>
<p>videos were played in court</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>else they missed five methoxy dimethyltryptamine</p>
<p>which is way more</p>
<p>powerful than regular dmt</p>
<p>and you could buy it online</p>
<p>how about that</p>
<p>used to be able to buy it online now i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s illegal yeah</p>

<p>gonna hit this guy over the head with a cookie pan</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty funny</p>
<p>yeah i was curious this is for joe like i know you have</p>
<p>certain like conspiracy theories</p>
<p>talk about you know</p>
<p>crazy alex joe and stuff i&rsquo;m curious how much</p>
<p>black helicopters do you believe in it how much do you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how much do you well you know</p>
<p>stocking put into it when you</p>
<p>start believing anything man you know</p>
<p>reality itself</p>
<p>is very fucking strange</p>
<p>i mean who knows what this is</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re all doing it</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all accepting it but if this wasn&rsquo;t our reality</p>
<p>and we were somehow</p>
<p>under thrust into this</p>
<p>world we would feel very uncomfortable we</p>
<p>would feel very fucked up i mean this</p>
<p>reality itself</p>
<p>is very strange we don&rsquo;t know exactly what it is</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>understand consciousness</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>is your brain a</p>
<p>vessel for consciousness is it a</p>
<p>radio for consciousness</p>
<p>is consciousness non</p>
<p>local is it</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what the fuck life is</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what the fuck happens to us when we sleep</p>
<p>so i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>silly whenever someone says</p>
<p>i believe in ufos i believe lee harvey oswald acted</p>
<p>alone i believe this</p>
<p>you can think about it</p>
<p>but if you went</p>
<p>drawing a conclusion</p>
<p>about things like ufos or</p>
<p>things where there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>proof it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>who knows man</p>
<p>and conspiracy theories</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the problem with conspiracy theories</p>
<p>some of them are real</p>
<p>hundred percent there&rsquo;s no question</p>
<p>about it when you see</p>
<p>that the men who used to work for the sec</p>
<p>and the people that used to</p>
<p>you know oversee</p>
<p>financial institutions</p>
<p>make sure they&rsquo;re not doing fucked up</p>
<p>things and then</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>leave that organization and go work for banks</p>
<p>and get these</p>
<p>giant fucking</p>
<p>crazy cushy jobs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a conspiracy</p>
<p>when you hear about</p>
<p>any of the shit that happened</p>
<p>you know with</p>
<p>operation northwoods or with</p>
<p>all the shit they</p>
<p>tried to do with</p>
<p>during the kennedys</p>
<p>administration</p>
<p>with like the bay of pigs and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of conspiracies that are real there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>real things</p>
<p>where people conspire to make something happen</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>start labeling</p>
<p>things conspiracy theories</p>
<p>what happens is all of a</p>
<p>sudden they get labeled</p>
<p>as something that only a</p>
<p>silly person</p>
<p>would think</p>
<p>about or entertain</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when it gets really weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if</p>
<p>you tell people that</p>
<p>you believe in ufos you automatically get put into some</p>
<p>silly little category</p>
<p>you know why i find</p>
<p>conspiracy theories get</p>
<p>labeled that</p>
<p>way and i&rsquo;ve argued with enough conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>is because when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking of something whether it was not 11 or kennedy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not married to the outcome</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m not married</p>
<p>jim norton is</p>
<p>not tied in with oswald being the lone assassin</p>
<p>so when somebody gives me a fact that i</p>
<p>think is interesting i really do process it logically</p>
<p>and when i hear</p>
<p>other people not processing facts</p>
<p>like that because they&rsquo;re involved in the conspiracy</p>
<p>and i think they&rsquo;re full of shit like</p>
<p>when i see them looking past</p>
<p>things that really do make sense</p>
<p>to get to the one little</p>
<p>minutiae of a</p>
<p>point that could somehow allude to</p>
<p>their theory being true</p>
<p>then i find them full of shit</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>whenever i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about 9 11 or the kennedy</p>
<p>assassination i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried to have conversations with people</p>
<p>and i hear them just being irrational and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m being irrational so that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>those are the two big ones</p>
<p>right 9 11 and</p>
<p>the kennedy assassination are the two big ones</p>
<p>yeah the ones</p>
<p>that people get emotionally invested and sometimes</p>
<p>i know people that have had they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>dedicated entire</p>
<p>chunks of their life</p>
<p>like the alex</p>
<p>jones dude and i know a</p>
<p>bunch of people that work for alex jones</p>
<p>jason the guy who did the</p>
<p>loose change documentaries</p>
<p>sure those fucking guys are invested in it man</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a perfect example</p>
<p>there was a guy</p>
<p>jose escamelia</p>
<p>or something like that i don&rsquo;t remember his name</p>
<p>but he was the guy that was making</p>
<p>videos about rods</p>
<p>do you remember rods</p>
<p>if nobody remembers</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fucking guy that had all</p>
<p>these ufo rods and roswell rods</p>
<p>and apparently</p>
<p>what they did was they were filming in mexico</p>
<p>and they captured these</p>
<p>things on high</p>
<p>speed video</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re flying through the air</p>
<p>and what they said it looks like a squid</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s moving</p>
<p>so fast you can only capture it on camera</p>
<p>and then you have to review the camera to find</p>
<p>these rods this</p>
<p>motherfucker dedicated</p>
<p>decades to this shit and</p>
<p>mythbusters are not mythbusters but monster</p>
<p>was that show</p>
<p>monster quest</p>
<p>monster quest</p>
<p>cracked it figured out what it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a bug</p>
<p>in front of the camera</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a video artifact</p>
<p>where the video camera can&rsquo;t pick up the</p>
<p>speed of the bug&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>close and it&rsquo;s moving too quickly</p>
<p>so it stretches the</p>
<p>image of the bug out to try to capture it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>video artifact</p>
<p>they had two cameras</p>
<p>that were filming the</p>
<p>exact same thing</p>
<p>one of them was like this</p>
<p>super high speed high tech camera</p>
<p>and the other one is a</p>
<p>standard camera</p>
<p>and their standard camera</p>
<p>would create these rods</p>
<p>these roswell rods</p>
<p>this poor fuck</p>
<p>like dedicated his</p>
<p>whole life to nonsense</p>
<p>and he still</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t admit it he</p>
<p>still got the website up</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>married to the idea exactly and he cannot let it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the problem with most conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>is they become</p>
<p>it was like the</p>
<p>loose change guy like at</p>
<p>first they said no</p>
<p>plane hit the pentagon</p>
<p>no no no it was a missile</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s saying well it was a plane but</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>changed they</p>
<p>allow themselves</p>
<p>a million mistakes and a million changes to fit</p>
<p>their theory</p>
<p>but if they find one</p>
<p>minor inconsistency</p>
<p>in the testimony of a</p>
<p>dallas cop all of a</p>
<p>sudden it proves</p>
<p>conspiracy they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>completely irrational</p>
<p>i think yeah well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s both ways of looking at it for sure you know</p>
<p>because i bought into this</p>
<p>right i bought</p>
<p>into the oswald i bought into the kennedy conspiracy</p>
<p>completely i</p>
<p>completely was a conspiracy theorist</p>
<p>and then i continued to read</p>
<p>things and fuck</p>
<p>it just became harder and harder for me to buy it</p>
<p>and i just began to believe oswald was the loan</p>
<p>i changed my opinion</p>
<p>almost against my will to do so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one to me that seems pretty carved in stone</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m open to the idea that i as well</p>
<p>as well that actually pulled</p>
<p>it off on his own but so many fucking people said they</p>
<p>heard shots so many of</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>that were witnesses died in strange accidents</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s the the fact that the warren commission</p>
<p>had to come up with this single bullet theory in the</p>
<p>first place the only reason why</p>
<p>they did that was because they had to account for this</p>
<p>third bullet</p>
<p>because it hit an</p>
<p>underpass and chipped</p>
<p>off a chunk of the curbstone</p>
<p>and ricochet and hit this fucking guy in the head</p>
<p>he got hit by that</p>
<p>ricochet so they had to</p>
<p>count for a</p>
<p>third bullet</p>
<p>so they said okay</p>
<p>well it must</p>
<p>been one bullet that did all this damage to</p>
<p>these two people</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never been a bullet ever that&rsquo;s ever been</p>
<p>fired into any fucking</p>
<p>bone that came out looking like that bullet it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous that</p>
<p>that bullet they</p>
<p>found it on the gurney when they</p>
<p>brought connolly into the hospital just so conveniently</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nonsense it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>silly there&rsquo;s a lot of that</p>
<p>story that absolutely</p>
<p>reeks of deception</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of it that reeks</p>
<p>of manipulation a lot of it that reeks of conspiracy</p>
<p>so absolutely i mean and i can&rsquo;t explain the single</p>
<p>bullet theory 100</p>
<p>i do know that when you watch jfk</p>
<p>and they show like how</p>
<p>could this bullet make a</p>
<p>right turn and go down</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being dishonest because kennedy was on a</p>
<p>he was more towards</p>
<p>the middle i</p>
<p>was on a raised seat</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>things that they make</p>
<p>the single bullet theory seem</p>
<p>completely ridiculous</p>
<p>what oswald was a terrible shot</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t he was a</p>
<p>sharpshooter he wasn&rsquo;t a terrible shot</p>
<p>really yes i read that a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>places yes it&rsquo;s a myth in the military he was an</p>
<p>expert and he was a</p>
<p>sharpshooter he tested</p>
<p>extraordinarily good shot</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting and they feel that that shot has</p>
<p>never been no</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s such a good</p>
<p>sharpshooter that he could</p>
<p>shoot a guy from behind and make his head go like this</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s actually that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s actually to a few i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>a photo of kennedy</p>
<p>when that bullet</p>
<p>first hits there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>photo invincible</p>
<p>dosey who prosecuted manson</p>
<p>wrote a book</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the book</p>
<p>about the jfk assassination</p>
<p>and you see the</p>
<p>photo like in</p>
<p>photo negative</p>
<p>and kennedy&rsquo;s head is leaning forward</p>
<p>and the stuff is coming out forward and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not you&rsquo;ve seen the</p>
<p>photo it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>picture that</p>
<p>the conspiracy</p>
<p>theorists don&rsquo;t show you</p>
<p>and that shot has been reenacted</p>
<p>many times and one guy</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>specialist named miller i could be</p>
<p>wrong actually improved on the time with the same gun</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these weird</p>
<p>things that have been done that</p>
<p>the conspiracy theorists just don&rsquo;t look at</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m saying i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying that i</p>
<p>think that it</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t be done that you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shoot a guy</p>
<p>from that i mean you look people have pulled off</p>
<p>extraordinary shots as</p>
<p>an army sniper or us</p>
<p>military sniper</p>
<p>that killed</p>
<p>two guys with one bullet at like a mile away recently</p>
<p>you know which is pretty fucking incredible</p>
<p>things have been pulled off but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t buy that guy but</p>
<p>being by himself back</p>
<p>into the left yeah back</p>
<p>they did throw that in and jfk man but there was</p>
<p>it was oswald</p>
<p>was certainly up there i mean there was the</p>
<p>same i think the same guy that caught the ruby shooting</p>
<p>who caught oswald getting shot</p>
<p>i believe was in dearly plaza and actually saw</p>
<p>him in the window and saw the</p>
<p>rifle and thought he was</p>
<p>secret service and regretted not</p>
<p>photographing it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s who knows</p>
<p>who knows what the fuck they really saw</p>
<p>you know that gets into</p>
<p>weird hearsay</p>
<p>sort of shit but there were guys in the</p>
<p>floor below</p>
<p>oswald that</p>
<p>heard fucking</p>
<p>that heard the shell</p>
<p>casings hitting the</p>
<p>floor there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>people that whenever</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fucking reporter around there i heard it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the man for sure i was hard</p>
<p>let me tell</p>
<p>you something</p>
<p>about when i was</p>
<p>doing a show called</p>
<p>game show in my head</p>
<p>and this really soured me</p>
<p>on people&rsquo;s evidence and people</p>
<p>giving testimony</p>
<p>we did this</p>
<p>thing with game</p>
<p>show in my head was a show that we did for cbs where</p>
<p>we would show up</p>
<p>with a contestant we</p>
<p>would say okay here&rsquo;s what you got to do</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s hidden cameras</p>
<p>everywhere we</p>
<p>would say here&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>gotta do you</p>
<p>gotta find somebody you are a</p>
<p>reporter for a</p>
<p>local news station</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an event that just happened</p>
<p>a ufo was spotted</p>
<p>right here and you have to go find someone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s willing to go on air</p>
<p>and say that they were</p>
<p>taken aboard this ufo</p>
<p>and no matter any</p>
<p>what whatever way you get to</p>
<p>manipulate them this is what you know this is what you</p>
<p>gotta do so</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>would run up to people</p>
<p>and say listen here&rsquo;s the deal man there was this</p>
<p>thing this is ufo was here</p>
<p>and we brought the film crew</p>
<p>but by the time we brought</p>
<p>the film crew here the guy was the witness took off</p>
<p>would you be willing to say that you had seen this ufo</p>
<p>and these fucking people all did it like that</p>
<p>it was crazy</p>
<p>like they turned the camera on them they go okay you</p>
<p>ready okay we&rsquo;re live here in hollywood</p>
<p>on hollywood boulevard with this man martin</p>
<p>blah blah blah blah blah</p>
<p>so martin you were</p>
<p>taken aboard this ufo</p>
<p>yeah man it came down</p>
<p>and there was a</p>
<p>light and the</p>
<p>light was it was a bright silver</p>
<p>craft it was rotating</p>
<p>white guy you just</p>
<p>start fucking talking yeah</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a wigger</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s a rapper a</p>
<p>white rapper</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing how full of shit people are</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>people are full of shit and</p>
<p>they love to tell stories</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very hard to</p>
<p>listen to eyewitness</p>
<p>stories about anything</p>
<p>just the amount of people you&rsquo;d have to corrupt</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t believe to do what</p>
<p>to pull off a conspiracy</p>
<p>abu ghraib couldn&rsquo;t be kept a secret</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s just because</p>
<p>they got a hold of photos</p>
<p>how many abu</p>
<p>ghraibs have been in the past</p>
<p>where they did keep it a</p>
<p>secret probably a fuck load</p>
<p>probably a fuck load because don&rsquo;t forget new</p>
<p>photos that just came out in afghanistan</p>
<p>of new bodies</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s people fucking holding</p>
<p>bodies and taking</p>
<p>pictures with them and</p>
<p>one of them was some guy that was seller palance</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re family friends for 20 years</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s holding someone by the hair that&rsquo;s all right</p>
<p>obama was friend with william heirs</p>
<p>everybody has shitty friends</p>
<p>i mean when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a politician we all have shitty friends well i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not saying there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>wrong with that but you know i think</p>
<p>people have been doing that forever</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s a lot of conspiracies that are real</p>
<p>there might</p>
<p>be and i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>i honestly think that there are how</p>
<p>about the gulf of tonkin</p>
<p>i guess that i don&rsquo;t know from about that i mean i know</p>
<p>it was a big conspiracy and it was a problem okay</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>more they&rsquo;ve made up a it&rsquo;s a fake attack</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about it was that just one guy saying hey i got an idea</p>
<p>we could do this in the</p>
<p>other ones like yeah</p>
<p>what are you talking</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s retarded but they had to just</p>
<p>write it down anyway because</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>is that an actual like</p>
<p>which one the golf autonomy yeah</p>
<p>yeah no it&rsquo;s a military idea yeah</p>
<p>i had a way to get 50</p>
<p>million ideas you know</p>
<p>what they did with operation</p>
<p>northwards is</p>
<p>they were trying to figure out a way to get people into</p>
<p>that would be enthusiastic</p>
<p>about going to war with cuba</p>
<p>nobody wanted to go to war with cuba</p>
<p>so they decided they were</p>
<p>going to fake attacks on american</p>
<p>civilians and even they were</p>
<p>going to lob mortars on guantanamo bay they were</p>
<p>going to arm cuban</p>
<p>friendlies they were</p>
<p>going to attack guantanamo bay so we would have</p>
<p>well now we got to go over there and attack cuba</p>
<p>this is like they were</p>
<p>going to sacrifice american lives they were</p>
<p>going to blow up a</p>
<p>drone jet liner</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>going to blame it on cuba</p>
<p>this is all written shit yeah</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is did they write</p>
<p>at this idea or some</p>
<p>guy that worked in</p>
<p>the military thought of this idea and then like an hour</p>
<p>later like yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not a good idea and just had to put</p>
<p>it in the record and it was</p>
<p>vetoed by kennedy it was assigned by the joint</p>
<p>chiefs of staff and it was</p>
<p>vetoed by kennedy a</p>
<p>bunch of people talked</p>
<p>about it and they</p>
<p>drafted this proposal</p>
<p>this was like</p>
<p>a real idea that they had that&rsquo;s how little they care</p>
<p>about human life and</p>
<p>about they wanna do what they</p>
<p>wanna do and if</p>
<p>they wanted to go to war with cuba for whatever fucking</p>
<p>crazy reason</p>
<p>who knows what it is</p>
<p>when you see this shit</p>
<p>happen in libya</p>
<p>and you see all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things that are happening overseas</p>
<p>do you get skeptical do you go</p>
<p>who the fuck is</p>
<p>why are all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>dictators getting overthrown at the same time</p>
<p>why are all</p>
<p>these people rising up are they really being</p>
<p>motivated by all</p>
<p>these other successful</p>
<p>rebellions or is this a part of some fucking</p>
<p>sneaky black ops shit</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>motivation because</p>
<p>when egypt was happening</p>
<p>everybody said if mubarak leaves</p>
<p>yemen all these</p>
<p>other you know</p>
<p>and then they saw it worked</p>
<p>if you see something works</p>
<p>you do it then everybody gets a little bit more balls</p>
<p>you know what i mean if mubarak</p>
<p>had just opened fire and killed all</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>then no other country</p>
<p>would have done it because they</p>
<p>would have been scared i</p>
<p>have no time to pay attention to this shit</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>i was paying attention</p>
<p>these fucking banana republics</p>
<p>these wacky</p>
<p>dictators and</p>
<p>their fucking</p>
<p>military outfit i have no time</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough time in the day</p>
<p>pay attention</p>
<p>these nutty</p>
<p>motherfuckers on another part of the planet that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>backwards and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically they&rsquo;re the townies of the</p>
<p>world you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they are that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>the middle east is that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>civilization was created</p>
<p>you know i do joe when i want to</p>

<p>these like question answers with the crowds</p>
<p>and a lot of it was good you know and people</p>
<p>like the free balling and just talking to people and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>but a lot of it is like god damn this</p>
<p>is taking forever and everyone&rsquo;s sort of kidnapped and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>leave and be rude and</p>
<p>i decided that i</p>
<p>would start doing</p>
<p>shorter sets i do i&rsquo;ve been doing like an hour</p>
<p>i do about an</p>
<p>hour i&rsquo;m comfortable doing an hour like i always ask</p>
<p>kenny when i come off</p>
<p>longest it goes an hour and ten hour nine</p>

<p>yeah i know i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>put a lot of</p>
<p>pressure on this one go</p>

<p>you ready yeah sure</p>
<p>all right you know joe i&rsquo;ve always wondered</p>
<p>you got a favorite weed</p>
<p>a favorite weed favorite i like</p>
<p>train wreck</p>
<p>yeah the train</p>
<p>wreck yeah just</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s so aptly name and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what i like most</p>
<p>about pot is</p>
<p>it sounds silly but i like</p>
<p>the terrifying</p>
<p>feeling that nothing makes sense</p>
<p>and a lot of people</p>
<p>call it paranoia</p>
<p>but i call it</p>
<p>hyper awareness</p>
<p>because you really are a fucking bag of skin and</p>
<p>blood on a rock that&rsquo;s flying through the universe</p>
<p>surrounding a</p>
<p>giant nuclear explosion and</p>
<p>trainwreck makes me realize that</p>
<p>every single time</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>it gives me</p>
<p>a sense of humility</p>
<p>it humbles me and it makes me</p>
<p>it makes me</p>
<p>aware of my mortality</p>
<p>and the temporary nature of the world</p>
<p>and you just got</p>
<p>two three hits in that&rsquo;s all you need</p>
<p>the end thank you very much for coming you guys</p>
<p>fucking rule</p>

<p>success for us</p>
<p>creatively we will</p>
<p>definitely be doing it again</p>
