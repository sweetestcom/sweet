    <p>The following is a conversation with Dennis White,</p>
<p>nuclear physicist at MIT and the director</p>
<p>of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Rocket Money for helping you cancel</p>
<p>unwanted subscriptions, Masterclass for online education</p>
<p>and Insight Tracker for bio-monitoring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Rocket Money,</p>
<p>a personal finance app that finds and cancels</p>
<p>unwanted subscriptions, monitors your spending</p>
<p>and helps you lower your bills all in one place.</p>
<p>I use it especially to monitor my subscriptions.</p>
<p>It actually, in a indirect way, makes me realize</p>
<p>all the things I&rsquo;m subscribed to</p>
<p>that actually add value to my life.</p>
<p>For example, it shows Audible and Netflix,</p>
<p>maybe Spotify, I&rsquo;m trying to think.</p>
<p>Things I pay for every single month</p>
<p>and things that add a huge amount of value to my life.</p>
<p>And in that list, there are a bunch of subscriptions</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t need, that I completely forgot.</p>
<p>Or actually, I aspired to use, but I end up not using.</p>
<p>And then you kind of have to confront yourself</p>
<p>with the reality of the fact that you plan to use a service</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t use it, and why pay a huge amount of money</p>
<p>every month, every year to use it.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s really nice to kind of have</p>
<p>an introspective analysis of your life.</p>
<p>Reflect and start anew.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer that habits, every single day,</p>
<p>can make a huge amount of progress in your growth,</p>
<p>in your learning, in your development.</p>
<p>In that same way, paying for stuff every single day,</p>
<p>every week, every month can make a huge impact</p>
<p>in your bank account.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you want to remove the stuff</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually not using.</p>
<p>Of course, Rocket Money helps you manage</p>
<p>other kinds of spending in general,</p>
<p>but for me, the subscription&rsquo;s the big one.</p>
<p>Go to rocketmoney.com slash Lex to cancel unwanted</p>
<p>subscriptions and manage your money the easy way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s rocketmoney.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Masterclass.</p>
<p>$180 a year gets you an all-access pass</p>
<p>to watch courses from the best people in the world</p>
<p>in their respective disciplines.</p>
<p>The list is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Chris Hadfield, Will Wright, Carlos Santana,</p>
<p>Garry Kasparov, Daniel Negrano,</p>
<p>Neil Gaiman, Martin Scorsese.</p>
<p>I would love to talk to Martin Scorsese on this podcast.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s probably, if not the,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of the greatest directors of all time,</p>
<p>but also just a really interesting mind,</p>
<p>a really unique mind, a really unique cinematographer,</p>
<p>director, producer, storyteller, visionary.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s created some of the greatest movies ever,</p>
<p>but I think a podcast is a totally different thing</p>
<p>than a Masterclass.</p>
<p>A Masterclass is a really condensed, elegant,</p>
<p>clear, succinct summary of all the deep lessons</p>
<p>that the person has about the particular expertise.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of people you wanna learn</p>
<p>about a thing from, is the best people</p>
<p>that actually have done it.</p>
<p>Not just good at teaching, but good at doing.</p>
<p>The best teachers are the ones that have reached the top</p>
<p>and have sort of done it for long enough</p>
<p>to be able to reflect on it</p>
<p>and condense it down into wisdom.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Masterclass is really good at.</p>
<p>You can get unlimited access to every Masterclass</p>
<p>and get 15% off an annual membership</p>
<p>at masterclass.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by InsideTracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of plans, most include blood tests</p>
<p>that give you information to make decisions</p>
<p>about your health.</p>
<p>Like John Mayer said, your body is a wonderland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a source of a lot of signal, a lot of data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious to me that in the 21st century,</p>
<p>maybe the 22nd century, we&rsquo;re going to create systems</p>
<p>for the collection of that data</p>
<p>and then use machine learning to analyze that data</p>
<p>in order to understand what is going on inside</p>
<p>and what you should do next.</p>
<p>That means recommendations about lifestyle,</p>
<p>about health, about everything.</p>
<p>Career advice, relationship advice.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should get blood data</p>
<p>that then help you understand</p>
<p>what your dating life should be like.</p>
<p>This is obviously the future.</p>
<p>And then also, if you can get data from the brain,</p>
<p>the electrical, the mechanical,</p>
<p>the chemical signals from the brain,</p>
<p>high resolution, regular collection of that data</p>
<p>all inside an app and make predictions</p>
<p>based on that on what you should do with your life.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, just like I am right now,</p>
<p>you would be deeply lost.</p>
<p>Deeply lost in the turmoil of the human condition,</p>
<p>services like Insight Tracker</p>
<p>can at least give you a little bit of hope.</p>
<p>Get special savings for a limited time</p>
<p>when you go to insighttracker.com slash Alex.</p>
<p>This is Alex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Dennis White.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a big question.</p>
<p>What is nuclear fusion?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the underlying process that powers the universe.</p>
<p>So as the name implies,</p>
<p>it fuses together or brings together</p>
<p>two different elements, technically nuclei,</p>
<p>that come together.</p>
<p>And if you can push them together close enough</p>
<p>that you can trigger essentially a reaction,</p>
<p>what happens is that the element typically changes.</p>
<p>So this means that you change from one element</p>
<p>to another chemical element to another.</p>
<p>Underlying what this means</p>
<p>is that you change the nuclear structure.</p>
<p>This rearrangement through equals MC squared</p>
<p>releases large amounts of energy.</p>
<p>So fusion is the fusing together of lighter elements</p>
<p>into heavier elements.</p>
<p>And when you go through it, you say,</p>
<p>oh, look, so here were the initial elements,</p>
<p>typically hydrogen,</p>
<p>and they had a particular mass, rest mass,</p>
<p>which means just the mass with no kinetic energy.</p>
<p>And when you look at the product afterwards,</p>
<p>it has less rest mass.</p>
<p>And so you go, well, how is that possible?</p>
<p>Because you have to keep mass,</p>
<p>but mass and energy are the same thing,</p>
<p>which is what E equals MC squared means.</p>
<p>And the conversion of this comes into kinetic energy,</p>
<p>namely energy that you can use in some way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happens in the center of stars.</p>
<p>So fusion is literally the reason</p>
<p>life is viable in the universe.</p>
<p>So fusion is happening in our sun.</p>
<p>And what are the elements?</p>
<p>The elements are hydrogen that are coming together.</p>
<p>It goes through a process</p>
<p>which is probably gets a little bit too detailed,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a somewhat complex catalyzed process</p>
<p>that happens in the center of stars.</p>
<p>But in the end, stars are big balls of hydrogen,</p>
<p>which is the lightest, it&rsquo;s the simplest element,</p>
<p>the lightest element, the most abundant element,</p>
<p>most of the universe is hydrogen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s essentially a sequence</p>
<p>through which these processes occur</p>
<p>that you end up with helium.</p>
<p>So those are the primary things.</p>
<p>And the reason for this is because</p>
<p>helium has features as a nucleus,</p>
<p>like the interior part of the atom,</p>
<p>that is extremely stable.</p>
<p>And the reason for this is helium has two protons</p>
<p>and two neutrons.</p>
<p>These are the things that make up nuclei,</p>
<p>that make up all of us, along with electrons.</p>
<p>And because it has two pairs, it&rsquo;s extremely stable.</p>
<p>And for this reason,</p>
<p>when you convert the hydrogen into helium,</p>
<p>it just wants to stay helium</p>
<p>and it wants to release kinetic energy.</p>
<p>So stars are basically conversion engines</p>
<p>of hydrogen into helium.</p>
<p>And this also tells you why you love fusion.</p>
<p>I mean, because our sun will last</p>
<p>10 billion years approximately.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how long the fuel will last.</p>
<p>But to do that kind of conversion,</p>
<p>you have to have extremely high temperatures.</p>
<p>It is one of the criteria for doing this.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the easiest one to understand.</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>Because effectively what this requires</p>
<p>is that these hydrogen ions,</p>
<p>which is really the bare nucleus,</p>
<p>so they have a positive charge,</p>
<p>everything has a positive charge of those ones,</p>
<p>is that to get them to trigger this reaction,</p>
<p>they must approach within distances</p>
<p>which are like the size of the nucleus itself.</p>
<p>Because the nature, in fact,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s really using</p>
<p>is something called the strong nuclear force.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s four fundamental forces in the universe.</p>
<p>This is the strongest one.</p>
<p>But it has a strange property</p>
<p>is that while it&rsquo;s the strongest force by far,</p>
<p>it only has impact over distances</p>
<p>which are the size of a nucleus.</p>
<p>So to put that into, what does that mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a millionth of a billionth of a meter, okay?</p>
<p>Incredibly small distances.</p>
<p>But because the distances are small</p>
<p>and the particles have charge,</p>
<p>they want to push strongly apart.</p>
<p>Namely, they have repulsion that wants to push them apart.</p>
<p>So it turns, when you go through the math of this,</p>
<p>the average velocity or energy of the particles</p>
<p>must be very high to have any significant probability</p>
<p>of the reactions happening.</p>
<p>And so the center of our sun</p>
<p>is at about 20 million degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>And on Earth, this means it&rsquo;s one of the first things</p>
<p>we teach entering graduate students.</p>
<p>You can do a quick basically power balance</p>
<p>and you can determine that on Earth</p>
<p>it requires a minimum temperature</p>
<p>of about 50 million degrees Celsius on Earth.</p>
<p>To perform fusion.</p>
<p>To get enough fusion that you would be able to make,</p>
<p>get energy gain out of it.</p>
<p>So you can trigger fusion reactions at lower energy,</p>
<p>but they become almost vanishingly small</p>
<p>at lower temperatures than that.</p>
<p>First of all, let me just linger on some crazy ideas.</p>
<p>So one, the strong force,</p>
<p>just stepping out and looking at all the physics</p>
<p>is it weird to you that there&rsquo;s these forces</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very particular,</p>
<p>like it operates at a very small distance</p>
<p>and then gravity operates at a very large distance</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all very specific</p>
<p>and the standard model describes</p>
<p>three of those forces extremely well and there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And this is one of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is one of them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just all kind of works out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big part of you that&rsquo;s an engineer.</p>
<p>Did you step back</p>
<p>and almost look at the philosophy of physics?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting because as a scientist,</p>
<p>I see the universe through that lens</p>
<p>of essentially the interesting things that we do</p>
<p>are through the forces that get used around those.</p>
<p>And everything works because of that.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman had,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever read Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of a tangent, but.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never been on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never been on the podcast.</p>
<p>He was unfortunately passed away,</p>
<p>but like a hero to almost all physicists.</p>
<p>And a part of it was because of what you said.</p>
<p>He kind of looked through a different lens</p>
<p>at these, what typically look like very dry</p>
<p>like equations and relationships.</p>
<p>And he kind of, I think he brought out the wonder of it</p>
<p>in some sense, right, for those.</p>
<p>He posited what would be,</p>
<p>if you could write down a single,</p>
<p>not even really a sentence,</p>
<p>but a single concept that was the most important thing</p>
<p>scientifically that we knew about.</p>
<p>That in other words, you had only one thing</p>
<p>that you could transmit like a future or past generation.</p>
<p>It was very interesting.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not what you think.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like, oh, strong nuclear force</p>
<p>or fusion or something like this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very profound, which was that the reason</p>
<p>that matter operates the way that it does</p>
<p>is because all matter is made up of individual particles</p>
<p>that interact each other through forces.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>So, just-</p>
<p>Atomic theory, basically.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is like, wow, that&rsquo;s like so simple,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not so simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because like, who thinks about atoms</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re made out of?</p>
<p>This is a good question I give to my students.</p>
<p>How many atoms are in your body?</p>
<p>Like, almost no students can answer this,</p>
<p>but to me, that&rsquo;s like a fundamental thing.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s about 10 to the 28.</p>
<p>10 to the 28.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s a trillion, million, trillion, trillion</p>
<p>or something like that, yes.</p>
<p>So, one thing is to think about the number</p>
<p>and the other is to start to really ponder the fact-</p>
<p>That it all holds together.</p>
<p>Yeah, it all holds together and you&rsquo;re actually that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more that than you are anything else.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I mean, there are people who do study such things</p>
<p>of the fact that if you look at the, for example,</p>
<p>the ratios between those fundamental forces,</p>
<p>people have figured out, oh, if this ratio was different</p>
<p>by some factor, like a factor of two or something,</p>
<p>I was like, oh, this would all not work.</p>
<p>And you look at the sun, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, so it turns out that there are key reactions</p>
<p>that if they had slightly lower probability,</p>
<p>no star would ever ignite.</p>
<p>And then life wouldn&rsquo;t be possible.</p>
<p>It does seem like the universe set things up for us</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s possible to do some cool things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s challenging.</p>
<p>So, it keeps it fun for us.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s the way I look at it.</p>
<p>I mean, the multiverse model is an interesting one</p>
<p>because there are quantum scientists who look at it</p>
<p>and figure, it&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s like, oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Like quantum science perhaps tells us</p>
<p>that there are almost an infinite variety</p>
<p>of other universes, but the way that it works probably</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s almost like a form of natural selection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, the universes that didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the correct or interesting relationships</p>
<p>between these forces, nothing happens in them.</p>
<p>So, almost by definition, the fact that we&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>this conversation means that we&rsquo;re in one</p>
<p>of the interesting ones by default.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the somewhat interesting,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s probably super interesting ones</p>
<p>where I tend to think of humans as incredible creatures.</p>
<p>Our brain is an incredible computing device,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re also extremely cognitively limited.</p>
<p>I can imagine alien civilizations</p>
<p>that are much, much, much, much more intelligent</p>
<p>in ways we can&rsquo;t even comprehend</p>
<p>in terms of their ability to construct models of the world,</p>
<p>to do physics, to do physics and mathematics.</p>
<p>I would see it in a slightly different way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s because we have creatures</p>
<p>that live with us on the earth that have cognition,</p>
<p>that understand and move through their environment,</p>
<p>but they actually see things in a way,</p>
<p>or they sense things in a way</p>
<p>which is so fundamentally different, it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>The problem is the translation,</p>
<p>not necessarily intelligence.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s the perception of the world.</p>
<p>So, I have a dog, and when I go and I see my dog</p>
<p>smelling things, there&rsquo;s a realization that I have</p>
<p>that he sees or senses the world in a way</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t understand it</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t translate my way to this.</p>
<p>We get little glimpses of this as humans, though,</p>
<p>by the way, because there are some parts of it,</p>
<p>for example, optical information, which comes from light,</p>
<p>is that now, because we&rsquo;ve developed the technology,</p>
<p>we can actually see things.</p>
<p>I get this, as one of my areas of research is spectroscopy,</p>
<p>so this means the study of light,</p>
<p>and I get this quote-unquote see things</p>
<p>or representations of them from the far infrared</p>
<p>all the way to hard, hard x-rays,</p>
<p>which is several orders of magnitude of the light intensity,</p>
<p>but our own human eyes see a teeny, teeny</p>
<p>little sliver of this, so that even bees, for example,</p>
<p>see a different place than we do.</p>
<p>So, I think if you think of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s already other intelligences around us in a way,</p>
<p>in a limited way because of the way they can communicate,</p>
<p>those are already baffling in many ways, yeah.</p>
<p>If we just focus in on the senses,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s already a lot of diversity,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s probably things we&rsquo;re not even considering</p>
<p>as possibilities, for example,</p>
<p>whatever the heck consciousness is</p>
<p>could actually be a door into understanding</p>
<p>some physical phenomena we haven&rsquo;t even begun understanding.</p>
<p>So, just like you said, spectroscopy,</p>
<p>there could be a similar kind of spectrum for consciousness</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just like, we&rsquo;re like these dumb</p>
<p>descendants of apes walking around.</p>
<p>It sure feels like something to experience the color red,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have, it&rsquo;s the same as in the ancient times</p>
<p>you experienced physics, you experienced light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s bright, and you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And you construct kind of</p>
<p>semi-religious kind of explanations.</p>
<p>We might actually experience this faster than we thought</p>
<p>because we might be building another kind of intelligence.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that intelligence will explain to us</p>
<p>how silly we are.</p>
<p>There was an email thread going around</p>
<p>the professors in my department already of,</p>
<p>so what is it going to look like to figure out</p>
<p>if students have actually written their term papers</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s chat, the-</p>
<p>Chat GPT.</p>
<p>Chat GPT.</p>
<p>It was, so as usual, we tend to be empiricists in my field.</p>
<p>So, of course, they were in there</p>
<p>trying to figure out if it could answer questions</p>
<p>for a qualifying exam to get into the PhD program at MIT,</p>
<p>which was, they didn&rsquo;t do that well at that point,</p>
<p>but of course, this is just the beginning of it.</p>
<p>So, we have some interesting ones to go for.</p>
<p>Eventually, both the students and the professors</p>
<p>will be replaced by chat GPT.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll sit on the beach.</p>
<p>I really recommend, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever seen them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called The Day the Universe Changed.</p>
<p>Is it a movie?</p>
<p>James Burke.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a science historian based in the UK.</p>
<p>He had a fairly famous series on public television</p>
<p>called Connections, I think it was,</p>
<p>but the one that I really enjoyed</p>
<p>was The Day the Universe Changed.</p>
<p>And the reason for the title of it was that,</p>
<p>it says the universe is what we know and perceive of it.</p>
<p>So, when there&rsquo;s a fundamental insight as to something new,</p>
<p>the universe for us changes.</p>
<p>Of course, the universe from an objective point of view</p>
<p>is the same as it was before, but for us, it has changed.</p>
<p>So, he walks through these moments of perception</p>
<p>in the history of humanity that changed what we were, right?</p>
<p>And so, as I was thinking about coming to discuss this,</p>
<p>people see fusion, oh, it&rsquo;s still far away,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s been slow progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when my godmother was born,</p>
<p>people had no idea how stars worked.</p>
<p>So, you talk about that day, that insight,</p>
<p>the universe changed, it&rsquo;s like, oh, this is the,</p>
<p>I mean, and they still didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>all the parts of it, but they basically got it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, because of the understanding</p>
<p>of these processes, it&rsquo;s like we unveiled the reason</p>
<p>that there can be life in the universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably one of those days</p>
<p>the universe changed, right?</p>
<p>And that was in the 1930s, yeah.</p>
<p>It seems like technology is developing</p>
<p>faster, and faster, and faster.</p>
<p>I tend to think, just like with Chad GPT,</p>
<p>I think this year might be extremely interesting,</p>
<p>just with how rapid and how profitable</p>
<p>the efforts in artificial intelligence are</p>
<p>that just stuff will happen where our whole world</p>
<p>is transformed like this, and there&rsquo;s a shock,</p>
<p>and then the next day, you kind of go on,</p>
<p>and you adjust immediately.</p>
<p>You probably won&rsquo;t have a similar kind of thing</p>
<p>with nuclear fusion with energy,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s probably going to be</p>
<p>an opening ceremony and stuff,</p>
<p>an announcement, it&rsquo;ll take months.</p>
<p>But with digital technology, you can just have</p>
<p>a immediate transformation of society,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be this gasp, and then you kind of adjust,</p>
<p>like we always do, and then you don&rsquo;t even remember,</p>
<p>just like with the internet and so on,</p>
<p>how the days were before.</p>
<p>And how it worked before, right?</p>
<p>I mean, fusion will be, because it&rsquo;s energy,</p>
<p>its nature is that it will be,</p>
<p>and anything that has to do with energy use</p>
<p>tends to be a slower transition,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re the most, I would argue,</p>
<p>some of the most profound transitions that we make.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason that we can live like this</p>
<p>and sit in this building and have this podcast</p>
<p>and people around the world is, at its heart,</p>
<p>is energy use, and it&rsquo;s intense energy use</p>
<p>that came from the evolution of starting to use</p>
<p>intense energies at the beginning</p>
<p>of the Industrial Revolution up to now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a bedrock, actually, of all of these,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t tend to come overnight.</p>
<p>Yeah, and some of the most important,</p>
<p>some of the most amazing technology</p>
<p>is one we don&rsquo;t notice, because we take it for granted,</p>
<p>because it enables this whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, which is energy,</p>
<p>which is amazing for how fundamental it is</p>
<p>to our society and way of life</p>
<p>is a very poorly understood concept, actually,</p>
<p>just even energy itself.</p>
<p>People confuse energy sources with energy storage</p>
<p>with energy transmission.</p>
<p>These are different physical phenomena,</p>
<p>which are very important.</p>
<p>So, for example, you buy an electric car,</p>
<p>and you go, oh, good, I have an emission-free car.</p>
<p>And, ah, but it&rsquo;s like, so why do you say that?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because if I draw the circle around the car,</p>
<p>I have electricity, and it doesn&rsquo;t emit anything.</p>
<p>Okay, but you plug that into a grid</p>
<p>where you follow that wire back,</p>
<p>there could be a coal power plant or a gas power plant</p>
<p>at the end of that.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>You mean, so this isn&rsquo;t like carbon-free?</p>
<p>Oh, and it&rsquo;s not their fault, it&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t, like the car isn&rsquo;t a source of energy.</p>
<p>The underlying source of energy</p>
<p>was the combustion of the fuel back somewhere.</p>
<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s also a story of how the raw materials are mined</p>
<p>in which parts of the world, with sort of basic respect</p>
<p>or deep disrespect of human rights</p>
<p>that happens in that mining.</p>
<p>So, the whole supply chain, there&rsquo;s a story there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deeper than just a particular electric car</p>
<p>with a circle around it.</p>
<p>And the physics or the science of it, too,</p>
<p>is the energy use that it takes to do that digging up,</p>
<p>which is also important and all that.</p>
<p>Yeah, anyway, so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We wandered away from fusion, but yes.</p>
<p>Ah, it&rsquo;s a beautiful straw.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very important, actually,</p>
<p>in the context of this, just because, you know,</p>
<p>those of us who work in fusion and these other kinds</p>
<p>of sort of disruptive energy technologies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting, I do think about, like,</p>
<p>what is it going to mean to society</p>
<p>to have an energy source that is like this,</p>
<p>that would be like fusion, you know,</p>
<p>which has such completely different characteristics.</p>
<p>For example, you know, free unlimited access to the fuel,</p>
<p>but it has technology implications.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean geopolitically?</p>
<p>What does it mean for how we distribute wealth</p>
<p>within our society?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to know, but probably profound, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to find another reason</p>
<p>to start wars instead of resources.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a pretty good job of that</p>
<p>over the course of our histories, yeah.</p>
<p>So, we talked about the forces of physics,</p>
<p>and again, sticking to the philosophical</p>
<p>before we get to the specific technical stuff,</p>
<p>E equals MC squared, you mentioned.</p>
<p>How amazing is that to you,</p>
<p>that energy and mass are the same?</p>
<p>And what does that have to do with nuclear fusion?</p>
<p>So, it has to do with everything we do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that energy and mass</p>
<p>are equivalent to each other.</p>
<p>The way we usually comment to it</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re just energy, just in different forms.</p>
<p>Can you intuitively understand that?</p>
<p>Yes, but it takes a long time.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t for a while,</p>
<p>but often I teach the introductory class</p>
<p>for incoming nuclear engineers.</p>
<p>And so, we put this up as an equation,</p>
<p>and we go through many iterations of using this,</p>
<p>how you derive it, how you use it, and so forth.</p>
<p>And then, usually in the final exam,</p>
<p>I would basically take all the equations</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve used before, and I flip it around.</p>
<p>I basically, instead of thinking about</p>
<p>energy is equal to mass,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of mass is equal to energy.</p>
<p>And I ask the question a different way,</p>
<p>and usually about half the students don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>It takes a while to get that intuition, yeah.</p>
<p>So, in the end, it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>is that this is actually the source of all free energy,</p>
<p>because that energy that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is kinetic energy, if it can be transformed from mass.</p>
<p>So, it turns out even though we used equals MC squared,</p>
<p>this is burning coal, and burning gas,</p>
<p>and burning wood is actually still equals MC squared.</p>
<p>The problem is that you would never know this</p>
<p>because the relative change in the mass is incredibly small.</p>
<p>By the way, which comes back to fusion,</p>
<p>which is that E equals MC squared.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean?</p>
<p>It tells you that the amount of energy</p>
<p>that is liberated in a particular reaction</p>
<p>when you change mass has to,</p>
<p>because C squared, that&rsquo;s the speed of light squared.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a large number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very large number,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s totally constant everywhere in the universe,</p>
<p>which is another thing.</p>
<p>Which is another weird thing.</p>
<p>Which is another weird thing, and in all rest frames.</p>
<p>Actually, the relativity stuff gets more difficult</p>
<p>conceptually until you get through.</p>
<p>Anyway, so you go to that,</p>
<p>and what that tells you is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the relative change in the mass</p>
<p>will tell you about the relative amount of energy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s liberated, and this is what makes fusion,</p>
<p>and you asked about fission as well, too.</p>
<p>This is what makes them extraordinary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because the relative change in the mass is very large</p>
<p>as compared to what you get in a chemical reaction.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s about 10 million times larger,</p>
<p>and that is at the heart of why</p>
<p>you use something like fusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because that is a fundamental of nature.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t beat that.</p>
<p>So whatever you do, if you&rsquo;re thinking about,</p>
<p>and why do I care about this?</p>
<p>Well, because mass is like the fuel, right?</p>
<p>So this means gathering the resources</p>
<p>that it takes to gather a fuel,</p>
<p>to hold it together, to deal with it,</p>
<p>the environmental impact it would have,</p>
<p>and fusion will always have 20 million times</p>
<p>the amount of energy release per reaction</p>
<p>that you get of those.</p>
<p>So this is why we consider it the ultimate</p>
<p>environmentally friendly energy source is because of that.</p>
<p>So is it correct to think of mass broadly</p>
<p>as a kind of storage of energy?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You mentioned it&rsquo;s environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>So nuclear fusion is a source of energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheap, clean, safe, so easy access to fuel</p>
<p>and virtually unlimited supply,</p>
<p>no production of greenhouse gases,</p>
<p>little radioactive waste produced allegedly.</p>
<p>Can you sort of elaborate why it&rsquo;s cheap, clean, and safe?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the easiest one, cheap.</p>
<p>It is not cheap yet because it hasn&rsquo;t been made</p>
<p>at a commercial scale.</p>
<p>Time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun, but yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But yes, not yet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>Actually, we&rsquo;ll come back to that</p>
<p>because this is cheaper, or a more technically correct term,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s economically interesting</p>
<p>is really the primary challenge, actually,</p>
<p>of fusion at this point.</p>
<p>But I think we can get back to that.</p>
<p>So what were the other ones you said?</p>
<p>So cheap, actually, when we&rsquo;re talking about cheap,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re thinking like asymptotically.</p>
<p>Like if you take it forward several hundred years,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of because of how much availability</p>
<p>there is of resources to use.</p>
<p>Of the fuel.</p>
<p>Yeah, of the fuel.</p>
<p>We should separate those two.</p>
<p>The fuel is already cheap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically free, right?</p>
<p>What do you mean by basically free?</p>
<p>So if we were to be using fusion fuel sources</p>
<p>to power your, and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all we had was fusion power plants around,</p>
<p>and we were doing it, the fuel costs per person</p>
<p>are something like 10 cents a year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free, okay?</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s hard to, in some ways,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hard to understand fusion</p>
<p>because people see this and go,</p>
<p>oh, if the fuel is free,</p>
<p>this means the energy source is free</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re used to energy sources like this.</p>
<p>So we spend resources and drill to get gas or oil,</p>
<p>or we chop wood, or we make coal,</p>
<p>we find coal or these things, right?</p>
<p>So fusion, this is what makes fusion,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also, it&rsquo;s not an intermittent,</p>
<p>renewable energy source like wind and solar.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, but this makes it hard to understand.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re saying the fuel is free,</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t the energy source free?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because of the necessary technologies</p>
<p>which must be applied to basically recreate the conditions</p>
<p>which are in stars, in the center of stars, in fact.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s only one natural place in the universe</p>
<p>that fusion energy occurs that&rsquo;s in the center of stars.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to bring a price to it</p>
<p>depending on the size and complexity of the technology</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s needed to recreate those things.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about the details of those technologies</p>
<p>and which parts might be expensive today</p>
<p>and which parts might be expensive in 200 years.</p>
<p>Exactly, it will have a revolution, I&rsquo;m certain of it.</p>
<p>So about clean, so clean is, at its heart,</p>
<p>what it does is convert, it basically converts hydrogen</p>
<p>into, it&rsquo;s heavier forms of hydrogen,</p>
<p>the most predominant one that we use on earth,</p>
<p>and converts it into helium and some other products,</p>
<p>but primarily helium is the product that&rsquo;s left behind.</p>
<p>So helium, safe, inert, gas, you know.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s actually what our sun is doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s eventually going to extinguish itself</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll just make so much helium</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So in that sense, clean because there&rsquo;s no emissions</p>
<p>of carbon or pollutants that come directly</p>
<p>from the combustion of the fuel itself.</p>
<p>And safe.</p>
<p>Safe, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about very high temperatures.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so this is also the counterintuitive thing.</p>
<p>So I told you temperatures, which like 50 million degrees,</p>
<p>or it actually tends to be more like</p>
<p>about 100 million degrees is really what we aim for.</p>
<p>So how can 100 million degrees be safe?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s safe because it is, this is so much hotter</p>
<p>than anything on earth, where everything on earth</p>
<p>is at around 300 Kelvin, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s around a few tens of degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>And what this means is that in order to get a medium</p>
<p>to those temperatures, you have to completely isolate it</p>
<p>from anything to do with terrestrial environment.</p>
<p>It can have no contact, like with anything on earth,</p>
<p>basically.</p>
<p>So this means what we, this is the technology</p>
<p>that I just described, is it fundamentally what it does</p>
<p>is it takes this fuel and it isolates it</p>
<p>from any terrestrial conditions</p>
<p>so that it has no idea it&rsquo;s on earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not touching any object that&rsquo;s at room temperature.</p>
<p>Including the walls of the containment.</p>
<p>Even including the walls of the containment building</p>
<p>or containment device, or even air or anything like this.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that part that makes it safe,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s actually another aspect to it,</p>
<p>but that fundamental part makes it so safe.</p>
<p>And in the mainlines approach to fusion</p>
<p>is also that it&rsquo;s very hot,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s very, very few particles at any time</p>
<p>in the thing that would be the power plant.</p>
<p>The actually more correct way to do it is you say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very few particles per unit volume.</p>
<p>So in a cubic centimeter, in a cubic meter,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>So we can do this.</p>
<p>So right now we&rsquo;re, although we don&rsquo;t think of air really</p>
<p>as a, there&rsquo;s atoms floating around us</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a density, because if I wave my hand,</p>
<p>I can feel the air pushing against my face.</p>
<p>That means we&rsquo;re in a fluid or a gas, which is around us,</p>
<p>that has a particular number of atoms per cubic meter.</p>
<p>So this actually turns out to be 10 to the 25th.</p>
<p>So this is one with 25 zeros behind it per cubic meter.</p>
<p>So we can figure out cubic meters about this,</p>
<p>the volume of this table, the whole volume of this table.</p>
<p>Okay, very good.</p>
<p>So like fusion, there&rsquo;s a few of those.</p>
<p>So fusion, like the mainstream one of fusion,</p>
<p>like what we&rsquo;re working on at MIT,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have a hundred thousand times less particles</p>
<p>per unit volume than that.</p>
<p>So this is very interesting because it&rsquo;s extraordinarily</p>
<p>hot, a hundred million degrees, but it&rsquo;s very tenuous.</p>
<p>And what matters from the engineering and safety point</p>
<p>of view is the amount of energy,</p>
<p>which is stored per unit volume,</p>
<p>because this tells you about the scenarios</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what you worry about.</p>
<p>Because when those kinds of energies are released,</p>
<p>suddenly it&rsquo;s like, what would be the consequences, right?</p>
<p>So the consequences of this are essentially zero</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s less energy content than boiling water.</p>
<p>Because of the low density?</p>
<p>Because of the low density.</p>
<p>So if you take, water is at about a hundred million</p>
<p>to a billion times more dense than this.</p>
<p>So even though it&rsquo;s at much lower temperature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually still, it has more energy content.</p>
<p>So for this reason, one of the ways that I explain this</p>
<p>is that if you imagine a power plant that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>powering Cambridge, Massachusetts, like if you were to,</p>
<p>which you wouldn&rsquo;t do this directly,</p>
<p>but if you went like this on it,</p>
<p>it actually extinguishes the fusion</p>
<p>because it gets too cold immediately.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the other one.</p>
<p>And the other part is that it does not,</p>
<p>because it works by staying hot rather than a chain reaction</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t run out of control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other part of it.</p>
<p>So by the way, this is what very much</p>
<p>distinguishes it from fission.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a process that can run away from you</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s basically thermally stable.</p>
<p>What does thermally stable mean?</p>
<p>That means is that you want to run it</p>
<p>at the optimization in temperature,</p>
<p>such that if it deviates away from that temperature,</p>
<p>the reactivity gets lower.</p>
<p>And the reason for this is because it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to keep the reactivity going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very hard fire to keep going, basically.</p>
<p>Oh, so it doesn&rsquo;t run away from you.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t run away from you.</p>
<p>How difficult is the control there to keep it at that?</p>
<p>It varies from concept to concept,</p>
<p>but in generally, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to do that.</p>
<p>And the easiest thing, it can&rsquo;t physically run away from you</p>
<p>because the other part of it is that there&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>at any given time, there&rsquo;s a very, very small amount</p>
<p>of fuel available to fuse anyway.</p>
<p>So this means that that&rsquo;s always intrinsically limited</p>
<p>to this, so even if the power consumption</p>
<p>of the device goes up, it just kind of burns itself out</p>
<p>immediately, yeah.</p>
<p>So you are the, just to take another tangent on a tangent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the director of MIT&rsquo;s Plasma Science</p>
<p>and Fusion Center.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about, maybe you can mention</p>
<p>some interesting aspects of the history of the center</p>
<p>in the broader history of MIT and maybe broader history</p>
<p>of science and engineering in the history</p>
<p>of human civilization.</p>
<p>But also, just to link on the safety aspect,</p>
<p>how do you prevent some of the amazing reactors</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re designing, how do you prevent</p>
<p>from destroying all of human civilization in the process?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the safety protocols?</p>
<p>Fusion is interesting because it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>directly weaponizable because what I mean by that</p>
<p>is that you have to work very hard to make these conditions</p>
<p>which you can get energy gain from fusion.</p>
<p>And this means that when we design these devices</p>
<p>with respect to application in the energy field,</p>
<p>is that they, you know, while they will,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re producing large amounts of power</p>
<p>and they will have hot things inside of them,</p>
<p>this means that they have like a level of industrial hazard</p>
<p>which is very similar to what you would have</p>
<p>like in a chemical processing plant</p>
<p>or anything like that, and any kind of energy plant</p>
<p>actually has these as well too.</p>
<p>But the underlying, underneath it, core technology</p>
<p>like can&rsquo;t be directly used in a nefarious way</p>
<p>because of the power that&rsquo;s being emitted.</p>
<p>It just basically, if you try to do those things,</p>
<p>typically it just stops working.</p>
<p>So the safety concerns have to do with just regular things</p>
<p>that like equipment malfunctioning, melting of,</p>
<p>like all this kind of stuff that has nothing to do</p>
<p>with fusion necessarily.</p>
<p>I mean, usually what we worry about is the viability</p>
<p>because in the end we build pretty complex objects</p>
<p>to realize these requirements.</p>
<p>And so what we try really hard to do</p>
<p>is like not damage those components,</p>
<p>but those are things which are internal</p>
<p>to the fusion device.</p>
<p>And this is not something that you would consider</p>
<p>about like it would, as you say, destroy human civilization</p>
<p>because that release of energy is just inherently limited</p>
<p>because of the fusion process.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t say that there&rsquo;s zero.</p>
<p>So you asked about the other feature of it, that it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>So it is, the process itself is intrinsically safe,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s a complex technology,</p>
<p>you still have to take into consideration aspects</p>
<p>of the safety.</p>
<p>So it produces ionizing radiation instantaneously.</p>
<p>So you have to take care of this,</p>
<p>which means that you shield it.</p>
<p>Think of like your dental x-rays or treatments for cancer</p>
<p>and things like this.</p>
<p>We always shield ourselves from this.</p>
<p>So we get the beneficial effects,</p>
<p>but we minimize the harmful effects of those.</p>
<p>So there are all those aspects of it as well too.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll return to MIT&rsquo;s Plasma Science and Fusion Center,</p>
<p>but let us linger on the destruction of human civilization,</p>
<p>which brings us to the topic of nuclear fission.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>So the process that is inside nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and current nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>So it relies on the same underlying physical principle,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s exactly the opposite,</p>
<p>which actually the names imply.</p>
<p>Fusion means bringing things together.</p>
<p>Fission means splitting things apart.</p>
<p>So fission requires the heaviest instead of the lightest</p>
<p>and the most unstable versus the most stable elements.</p>
<p>So this tends to be uranium or plutonium,</p>
<p>primarily uranium.</p>
<p>So take uranium.</p>
<p>So uranium-235 is one of the,</p>
<p>this is one of the heaviest unstable elements.</p>
<p>And what happens is that this is,</p>
<p>fission is triggered by the fact</p>
<p>that one of these subatomic particles,</p>
<p>the neutron, which has no electric charge,</p>
<p>basically gets in proximity enough to this</p>
<p>and triggers an instability effectively inside of this,</p>
<p>what is teetering on the border of instability</p>
<p>and basically splits it apart.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the fission, right?</p>
<p>The fissioning.</p>
<p>And so when that happens,</p>
<p>because the products that are,</p>
<p>it roughly splits in two, but it&rsquo;s not even that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually more complicated.</p>
<p>It splits into this whole array</p>
<p>of lighter elements and nuclei.</p>
<p>And when that happens, there&rsquo;s less rest mass</p>
<p>left than the original one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually the same.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, again, it&rsquo;s rearrangement</p>
<p>of the strong nuclear force that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the source of the energy.</p>
<p>And so in the end, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>so this is a famous graph that we show everybody</p>
<p>is basically, it turns out every element</p>
<p>that exists in the periodic table,</p>
<p>all the things that make up everything have a,</p>
<p>remember, you asked a good question.</p>
<p>It was like, so should we think of mass</p>
<p>as being the same as stored energy?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you can make a plot that basically shows</p>
<p>the relative amount of stored energy</p>
<p>in all of the elements that are stable</p>
<p>and make up basically the world, okay, and the universe.</p>
<p>And it turns out that this one has a maximum amount</p>
<p>of stability or storage at iron.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of in the middle of the periodic table</p>
<p>because this goes from, you know, it&rsquo;s roughly that.</p>
<p>And so this, what that means is that</p>
<p>if you take something heavier than iron,</p>
<p>like uranium, which is more than twice as heavy than that,</p>
<p>and you split apart, if somehow just magically,</p>
<p>you can just split apart its constituents</p>
<p>and you get something that&rsquo;s lighter,</p>
<p>because it moves to a more stable energy state,</p>
<p>it releases kinetic energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the energy that we use.</p>
<p>Kinetic energy meaning the movement of things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually an energy you can do something with.</p>
<p>And fusion, it sits on the other side of that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also moving towards iron,</p>
<p>but it has to do it through fusion together.</p>
<p>So this leads to some pretty profound differences.</p>
<p>As I said, they have some underlying physics</p>
<p>or science proximity to each other,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re literally the opposite.</p>
<p>So fusion, why is this?</p>
<p>It actually goes into practical implications of it,</p>
<p>which is that fission could happen at room temperature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because this neutron has no electric charge</p>
<p>and therefore it&rsquo;s literally room temperature neutrons</p>
<p>that actually trigger the reaction.</p>
<p>So this means in order to establish what&rsquo;s going on with it</p>
<p>and it works by a chain reaction,</p>
<p>is that you can do this at room temperature.</p>
<p>So Enrico Fermi did this like on a university campus,</p>
<p>University of Chicago campus.</p>
<p>The first sustained chain reaction was done</p>
<p>underneath a squash court with a big blocks of graphite.</p>
<p>It was still, don&rsquo;t get me wrong,</p>
<p>an incredible human achievement, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, and then you think about fusion,</p>
<p>I have to build a contraption of some kind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to get to a hundred million degrees.</p>
<p>Okay, wow, that&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<p>The other one is about the chain reaction,</p>
<p>that namely fission works by the fact</p>
<p>that when that fission occurs,</p>
<p>it actually produces free neutrons.</p>
<p>Free neutrons, particularly if they get slowed down</p>
<p>to room temperature, can trigger other fission reactions</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s other uranium nearby or fissile materials.</p>
<p>So this means that the way that it releases energy</p>
<p>is that you set this up in a very careful way</p>
<p>such that every, on average, every reaction that happens</p>
<p>exactly releases enough neutrons and slows down</p>
<p>that they actually make another reaction,</p>
<p>exactly one.</p>
<p>And what this means is that because each reaction</p>
<p>releases a fixed amount of energy,</p>
<p>you do this and then in time,</p>
<p>this looks like just a constant power output.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how a fission power plant works.</p>
<p>And so their control of the chain reactions</p>
<p>is extremely difficult and extremely important for fission.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>And when you intentionally design it</p>
<p>that it creates more than one fission reaction</p>
<p>per starting reaction, then it exponentiates away.</p>
<p>Which is what a nuclear weapon is.</p>
<p>Yeah, so how does an atomic weapon work?</p>
<p>How does a hydrogen bomb work?</p>
<p>Asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what you do is you very quickly put together</p>
<p>enough of these materials that can undergo fission</p>
<p>with room temperature neutrons.</p>
<p>And you put them together fast enough that what happens</p>
<p>is that this process can essentially grow mathematically,</p>
<p>like very fast.</p>
<p>And so this releases large amounts of energy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the underlying reason that it works.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve heard of a fusion weapon.</p>
<p>So this is interesting is that it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just like fusion energy in the sense</p>
<p>that what happens is that you&rsquo;re using fusion reactions</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s simply, it increases the gain actually</p>
<p>of the weapon rather than, it&rsquo;s not a pure,</p>
<p>at its heart, it&rsquo;s still a fission weapon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just using fusion reactions</p>
<p>as a sort of intermediate catalyst</p>
<p>basically to get even more energy out of it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not directly applicable to be used</p>
<p>in an energy source.</p>
<p>Does it terrify you, just again,</p>
<p>to step back at the philosophical,</p>
<p>that humans have been able to use physics</p>
<p>and engineering to create such powerful weapons?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say terrify.</p>
<p>I mean, we should be, this is the progress of human.</p>
<p>Every time that we&rsquo;ve gotten access,</p>
<p>you talk, you know, the day the universe changed.</p>
<p>It was really changed when we got access</p>
<p>to new kinds of energy sources.</p>
<p>But every time you get access,</p>
<p>and typically what this meant was you get access</p>
<p>to more intense energy, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s what that was.</p>
<p>And so the ability to move from burning wood</p>
<p>to using coal, to using gasoline and petroleum,</p>
<p>and then finally to use this is that both the potency</p>
<p>and the consequences are elevated around those things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like you said, the way that fusion,</p>
<p>nuclear fusion, would change the world,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, unless we think really deeply,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be able to anticipate some of the things</p>
<p>we can create.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of amazing stuff,</p>
<p>but then that amazing stuff is gonna enable</p>
<p>more amazing stuff and more, unfortunately,</p>
<p>or depending how you see it, more powerful weapons.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but see, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Fusion breaks that trend in the following way.</p>
<p>So one of them, so fusion doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>on a chain reaction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no chain reaction, zero.</p>
<p>So this means it cannot physically exponentiate</p>
<p>away on you, because it works,</p>
<p>and actually this is why stars,</p>
<p>by the way, we know this already,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s why stars are so stable,</p>
<p>why most stars and suns are so stable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they are regulated through their own</p>
<p>temperature and their heating,</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s happening is not that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some probability of this exponentiating away,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that the energy that&rsquo;s being released by fusion</p>
<p>basically is keeping the fire hot.</p>
<p>And these tend to be, and when it comes down</p>
<p>to thermodynamics and things like this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason, for example, it&rsquo;s pretty easy</p>
<p>to keep a constant temperature, like in an oven</p>
<p>and things like this, it&rsquo;s the same thing in fusion.</p>
<p>So this is actually one of the features</p>
<p>that I would argue fusion breaks the trend</p>
<p>of this is that it has more energy intensity</p>
<p>than fission on paper, but it actually</p>
<p>does not have the consequences of control</p>
<p>and sort of rapid release of the energy,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually, the physical system</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna have to look elsewhere</p>
<p>for the weapons with which we fight World War III.</p>
<p>Fair enough, so what is plasma,</p>
<p>that you may or may have not mentioned,</p>
<p>you mentioned ions and electrons and so on.</p>
<p>So what is plasma, what is the role</p>
<p>of plasma in nuclear fusion?</p>
<p>So plasma is a phase of matter or a state of matter.</p>
<p>So unfortunately our schools don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m not sure why this is the case,</p>
<p>but all children learn the three phases of matter, right?</p>
<p>So, and what does this mean?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll take water as an example.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s cold, it&rsquo;s ice, it&rsquo;s in a solid phase, right?</p>
<p>And then if you heat it up, it&rsquo;s the temperature</p>
<p>that typically depends, sets the phase,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not only temperature.</p>
<p>So you heat it up and you go to a liquid,</p>
<p>and obviously it changes its physical properties</p>
<p>because you can pour it and so forth, right?</p>
<p>And then if you heat this up enough,</p>
<p>it turns into a gas, and a gas behaves differently</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a very sudden change in the density,</p>
<p>actually that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So it changes by about a factor of 10,000 in density</p>
<p>from the liquid phase into when you make it</p>
<p>into steam at atmospheric pressure, all very good.</p>
<p>Except the problem is they forgot like what happens</p>
<p>if you just keep elevating the temperature.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna give kids ideas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna start experimenting</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna start heating up the gas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to start doing it anyway.</p>
<p>So you, it turns out that once you get above,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s approximately five or 10,000 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>then you hit a new phase of matter.</p>
<p>And actually that&rsquo;s the phase of matter</p>
<p>that is for all, pretty much all the temperatures</p>
<p>that are above that as well too.</p>
<p>And so what does that mean?</p>
<p>So it actually changes phase,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a different state of matter.</p>
<p>And the reason that it becomes a different state of matter</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s hot enough that what happens</p>
<p>is that the atoms that make up,</p>
<p>remember go back to Feynman, right?</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s made up of these individual things,</p>
<p>these atoms.</p>
<p>But atoms can actually themselves be,</p>
<p>which are made of nuclei,</p>
<p>which contain the positive particles in the neutrons.</p>
<p>And then the electrons, which are very, very light,</p>
<p>very much less mass than the nucleus,</p>
<p>and that surround us, this is what makes up an atom.</p>
<p>So a plasma is what happens when you start</p>
<p>pulling away enough of those electrons</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re free from the ion.</p>
<p>So almost all the atoms that make up us up</p>
<p>and this water and all that,</p>
<p>the electrons are in tightly bound states</p>
<p>and basically they&rsquo;re extremely stable.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re at about 5,000 or 10,000 degrees,</p>
<p>you start pulling off the electrons.</p>
<p>And what this means is that now the medium that is there,</p>
<p>its constituent particles mostly have net charge on them.</p>
<p>So why does that matter?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because now this means that the particles</p>
<p>can interact through their electric charge.</p>
<p>In some sense, they were when it was an atom as well too,</p>
<p>but now that they&rsquo;re free particles,</p>
<p>this means that they start,</p>
<p>it fundamentally changes the behavior.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t behave like a gas,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t behave like a solid or a liquid,</p>
<p>it behaves like a plasma, right?</p>
<p>And so why is it disappointing</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t speak about this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because 99% of the universe is in the plasma state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called stars.</p>
<p>And in fact, our own sun,</p>
<p>at the center of the sun is what clearly a plasma,</p>
<p>but actually the surface of the sun,</p>
<p>which is around 5,500 Celsius is also a plasma.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s hot enough that is that.</p>
<p>In fact, the things that you see,</p>
<p>sometimes you see these pictures from the surface of the sun</p>
<p>amazing like satellite photographs</p>
<p>of like those big arms of things</p>
<p>and of light coming off of the surface of the sun</p>
<p>and solar flares, those are plasmas.</p>
<p>What are some interesting ways</p>
<p>that this force state of matter is different than gas?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to how a gas works, right?</p>
<p>So the reason a gas,</p>
<p>and it goes back to Feynman&rsquo;s brilliance</p>
<p>in saying that this is the most important concept.</p>
<p>The reason actually solid, liquid and gas phases work</p>
<p>is because the nature of the interaction</p>
<p>between the atoms changes.</p>
<p>And so in a gas, you can think of this as being,</p>
<p>this room and the things, although you can&rsquo;t see them,</p>
<p>is that the molecules are flying around,</p>
<p>but then with some frequency,</p>
<p>they basically bounce into each other.</p>
<p>And when they bounce into each other,</p>
<p>they exchange momentum and energy around on this.</p>
<p>And so it turns out that the probability</p>
<p>and the distances and the scattering</p>
<p>of those of what they do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s those interactions that set the,</p>
<p>about how a gas behaves.</p>
<p>So what do you mean by this?</p>
<p>Well, so for example,</p>
<p>if I take an imaginary test particle of some kind,</p>
<p>like I spray something into the air</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got a particular color.</p>
<p>In fact, you can do it in liquids as well too.</p>
<p>Like how it gradually will disperse away from you.</p>
<p>This is fundamentally set because of the way</p>
<p>that those particles are bouncing into each other.</p>
<p>The probabilities of those particles bouncing.</p>
<p>The rate that they go at</p>
<p>and the distance that they go at and so forth.</p>
<p>So this was figured out by Einstein and others</p>
<p>at the beginning of the Brownian motion,</p>
<p>all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>These were set up at the beginning of the last century</p>
<p>and it was really like this great revelation.</p>
<p>Wow, this is why matter behaves the way that it does.</p>
<p>Like, wow.</p>
<p>So, but it&rsquo;s really like,</p>
<p>and also in liquids and in solids,</p>
<p>like what really matters</p>
<p>is how you&rsquo;re interacting with your nearest neighbor.</p>
<p>So you think about that one,</p>
<p>the gas particles are basically going around</p>
<p>until they actually hit into each other though,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really exchange information.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same in a liquid,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of beside each other,</p>
<p>but you can kind of move around.</p>
<p>In a solid, you&rsquo;re literally like stuck</p>
<p>beside your neighbor, you can&rsquo;t move like a man.</p>
<p>Plasmas are weird in the sense is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like that.</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s because the particles have electric charge,</p>
<p>this means that they can push against each other</p>
<p>without actually being in close proximity to each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not an infinitely true statement,</p>
<p>which if you go get it, it&rsquo;s a little bit more technical,</p>
<p>but basically this means that you can start having action</p>
<p>or exchange of information at a distance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in fact, the definition of a plasma</p>
<p>that it says, this have a technical name,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a Coulomb collisions,</p>
<p>just means that it&rsquo;s dictated by this force,</p>
<p>which is being pushed between the charged particles,</p>
<p>is that the definition of a plasma is a medium</p>
<p>in which the collective behavior</p>
<p>is dominated by these collisions at a distance.</p>
<p>So you can imagine, then this starts to give you</p>
<p>some strange behaviors,</p>
<p>which I could quickly talk about,</p>
<p>like for example, one of the most counterintuitive ones</p>
<p>is as plasmas get more hot,</p>
<p>as they get higher in temperature,</p>
<p>then the collisions happen less frequently.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>When particles go faster,</p>
<p>you think they would collide more often.</p>
<p>But because the particles are interacting</p>
<p>through their electric field,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re going faster, they actually spend less time</p>
<p>in the influential field of each other.</p>
<p>And so they talk to each other less</p>
<p>in an energy and momentum exchange point of view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of the counterintuitive aspects of plasmas.</p>
<p>Which is probably very relevant for nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So if I can try to summarize</p>
<p>what a nuclear fusion reactor is supposed to do.</p>
<p>So you have, what, a couple of elements?</p>
<p>What are usually the elements?</p>
<p>Usually deuterium and tritium,</p>
<p>which are the heavy forms of hydrogen.</p>
<p>Hydrogen.</p>
<p>You have those and you start heating it.</p>
<p>And then as you start heating it,</p>
<p>I forgot the temperature you said,</p>
<p>but it becomes plasma.</p>
<p>About 100 million.</p>
<p>No, first it becomes.</p>
<p>Oh, first it becomes plasma.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a gas, and then it turns into a plasma</p>
<p>at about 10,000 degrees.</p>
<p>And then so you have a bunch of electrons</p>
<p>and ions flying around.</p>
<p>And then you keep heating the thing.</p>
<p>And I guess as you heat the thing,</p>
<p>the ions hit each other rarer and rarer.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, oh man, that&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>So you have to keep heating it.</p>
<p>Such that you have to keep hitting it</p>
<p>until the probability of them colliding</p>
<p>becomes reasonably high.</p>
<p>And also on top of that, and sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>you have to prevent them from hitting the walls</p>
<p>of the reactor somehow.</p>
<p>So you asked about the definitions</p>
<p>of the requirements for fusion.</p>
<p>So the most famous one, or in some sense</p>
<p>the most intuitive one, is the temperature.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that you can make</p>
<p>many, many kinds of plasmas that have</p>
<p>zero fusion going on in them.</p>
<p>And the reason for this is that the average,</p>
<p>so you can make a plasma at around 10,000.</p>
<p>In fact, if you come, by the way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome to come to our laboratory</p>
<p>at the PSFC, I can show you a demonstration</p>
<p>of a plasma that you can see with your eyes,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s at about 10,000 degrees,</p>
<p>and you can put your hand up beside it</p>
<p>and all this, and it&rsquo;s like, and nothing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s zero fusion going on.</p>
<p>So you have, sorry, what was the temperature</p>
<p>of the plasma?</p>
<p>About 10,000 degrees.</p>
<p>You can stick your hand in?</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t stick your hand into it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a glass tube, you can basically</p>
<p>see this with your bare eye, yeah.</p>
<p>And you can put your hand on the glass tube</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the color, is it purple?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s purple, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s blue and purple.</p>
<p>It is kind of beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, plasmas are actually quite astonishing</p>
<p>sometimes in their beauty.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the most amazing forms</p>
<p>of plasma is lightning, by the way,</p>
<p>which is an instantaneous form of plasma</p>
<p>that exists on Earth but immediately goes away</p>
<p>because everything else around it</p>
<p>is at room temperature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s different requirements in this.</p>
<p>So making a plasma takes about this,</p>
<p>but at 10,000 degrees, even at a million degrees,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost no probability</p>
<p>of the fusion reactions occurring.</p>
<p>And this is because while the charged particles</p>
<p>can hit into each other, if you go back</p>
<p>to the very beginning of this, remember I said,</p>
<p>oh, these charged particles have to get to within distances</p>
<p>which are like this size of a nucleus</p>
<p>because of the strong nuclear force.</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, as the particles get closer,</p>
<p>the repulsion that comes from the charge,</p>
<p>the Coulomb force, increases</p>
<p>like the inverse distance squared.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>So as they get closer, they&rsquo;re pushing harder</p>
<p>and harder apart.</p>
<p>So then it gets a little bit more exotic,</p>
<p>which maybe you&rsquo;ll like, though,</p>
<p>that it turns out that people understood this</p>
<p>at the beginning of the age</p>
<p>of after Rutherford discovered the nucleus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, yeah, it&rsquo;s like, how are we going to,</p>
<p>how is this gonna work, right?</p>
<p>Because how do you get anything within these distances</p>
<p>is a good inquiry.</p>
<p>Extraordinary energy.</p>
<p>And it does.</p>
<p>And in fact, when you look at those energies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very, very high.</p>
<p>But it turns out quantum physics comes to the rescue</p>
<p>because the particles aren&rsquo;t actually just particles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also waves.</p>
<p>This is the point of quantum, right?</p>
<p>You can treat them both as waves and as particles.</p>
<p>And it turns out if you get,</p>
<p>if they get in close enough proximity to each other,</p>
<p>then the particle pops through basically this energy barrier</p>
<p>through an effect called quantum tunneling,</p>
<p>which is really just the transposition of the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a wave so that it has a finite probability</p>
<p>of this.</p>
<p>By the way, you talk about like,</p>
<p>do you have a hard time like conceptualizing this?</p>
<p>These are, this is one of them.</p>
<p>Quantum tunneling is one of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is like throwing a ping pong ball</p>
<p>like at a piece of paper.</p>
<p>And then every like, you know, 100 of them</p>
<p>just like magically show up on the other side of the paper</p>
<p>without seemingly breaking the paper.</p>
<p>I mean, to use a physical analogy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That phenomena is important,</p>
<p>is critical for the function of nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>Yes, for all kinds of fusion.</p>
<p>So this is the reason why stars can work as well too.</p>
<p>Like the stars would have to be much, much hotter</p>
<p>actually to be able to,</p>
<p>in fact, it&rsquo;s not clear that they would actually ignite</p>
<p>in fact, without this effect.</p>
<p>And so we get to that.</p>
<p>So this is why there&rsquo;s another requirement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, so you must make a plasma,</p>
<p>but you also must get it very hot</p>
<p>in order for the reactions to have a significant probability</p>
<p>to actually fuse.</p>
<p>And it actually falls effectively almost to zero</p>
<p>for lower temperatures as well too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some nice equation</p>
<p>that gets you to 50 million degrees.</p>
<p>Or like, or you said, practically speaking, 100 million.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really simple equation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ideal gas law, basically almost.</p>
<p>So in the end, you&rsquo;ve got a certain number of particles,</p>
<p>of these fusion particles in the plasma state.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the plasma state.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain number of particles.</p>
<p>And if the confinement is perfect,</p>
<p>if you put in a certain content of energy,</p>
<p>then basically eventually they just,</p>
<p>they come up in a temperature and they become,</p>
<p>they go up to high temperature.</p>
<p>This turns out to be, by the way,</p>
<p>extraordinarily small amounts of energy.</p>
<p>And you go, what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m getting something</p>
<p>to like 100 million degrees.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna take the biggest flame burner</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And the reason for this is it goes back</p>
<p>to the energy content of this.</p>
<p>So yeah, you have to get it to high average energy,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s very, very few particles.</p>
<p>This is low density.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s low density.</p>
<p>How do you get it to be low density in a reactor?</p>
<p>Is this?</p>
<p>So the way that you do this is primarily,</p>
<p>again, this is not exactly true in all kinds of fusion,</p>
<p>but in the primary one that we work on, magnetic fusion,</p>
<p>this is all happening in a hard vacuum.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s happening in outer space.</p>
<p>So basically you&rsquo;ve gotten rid of all the other particles,</p>
<p>except for these specialized fuel particles.</p>
<p>So you add them one at a time?</p>
<p>No, actually it&rsquo;s even easier than that.</p>
<p>You connect a gas valve and you basically</p>
<p>leak gas into it.</p>
<p>In a controlled fashion?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Wow, this is beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gas cylinder.</p>
<p>How do you get it from hitting the walls?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve touched on the other necessary requirements.</p>
<p>So it turns out it&rsquo;s not just temperature that&rsquo;s required.</p>
<p>You must also confine it.</p>
<p>So what does this mean, confine it?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two types of confinement, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>You mentioned the magnetic one.</p>
<p>Magnetic one, and there&rsquo;s one called inertial as well too.</p>
<p>But the general principle actually has nothing to do with,</p>
<p>in particular, with what the technology is</p>
<p>that you use to confine it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because this goes back to the fact</p>
<p>that the requirement in this is high temperature</p>
<p>and thermal content.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like building a fire.</p>
<p>And what this means is that if you,</p>
<p>when you release the energy into this,</p>
<p>or apply heat to this, if it just instantly leaks out,</p>
<p>it can never get hot, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re familiar with this, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>something that you&rsquo;re trying to apply heat to,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re just throwing the heat away very quickly.</p>
<p>This is why we insulate homes, by the way,</p>
<p>and things like this, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t want the heat that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>into this room to just immediately leave</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll just start consuming infinite amounts</p>
<p>of heat to try to keep it hot.</p>
<p>So in the end, this is one of the requirements,</p>
<p>and it actually has a name.</p>
<p>We call it the energy confinement time.</p>
<p>So this means if you release a certain amount of energy</p>
<p>into this fuel, kind of how long,</p>
<p>you sit there and you look at your watch,</p>
<p>how long does it take for this energy</p>
<p>to like leave the system?</p>
<p>So you could imagine that in this room,</p>
<p>that these heaters are putting energy into the air</p>
<p>in this room, and you waited for a day,</p>
<p>but all the heat have gone to outside</p>
<p>if I open up the windows.</p>
<p>Oh, there, that&rsquo;s energy confinement time.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s the same concept as that.</p>
<p>So this is an important one.</p>
<p>So all fusion must have confinement.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another more esoteric reason for this,</p>
<p>which is that people often confuse temperature and energy.</p>
<p>So what do I mean by that?</p>
<p>So this is literally a temperature,</p>
<p>which means that it is a system in which all the particles,</p>
<p>every particle has high kinetic energy</p>
<p>and is actually in a fully relaxed state,</p>
<p>namely that entropy has been maximized.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little bit more technical,</p>
<p>but this means that basically it is a thermal system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the air in this room,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the water, it&rsquo;s the water in this.</p>
<p>These all have temperatures,</p>
<p>which means that there&rsquo;s a distribution of those energies</p>
<p>because the particles have collided so much that it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So this is distinguished from having high energy particles,</p>
<p>like what we have in like particle accelerators,</p>
<p>like CERN and so forth.</p>
<p>Those are high kinetic energy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a temperature,</p>
<p>so it actually doesn&rsquo;t count as confinement.</p>
<p>So we go through all of those.</p>
<p>You have temperature, and then the other requirement,</p>
<p>not too surprising, is actually that there has to be</p>
<p>enough density of the fuel.</p>
<p>Enough, but not too much.</p>
<p>Enough, but not too much, yes.</p>
<p>And so in the end, the way that it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fancy name for it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the Lawson criterion,</p>
<p>because it was formulated by scientists</p>
<p>in the United Kingdom about 1956 or 1957.</p>
<p>And this was essentially the realization of,</p>
<p>oh, this is what it&rsquo;s going to take,</p>
<p>regardless of the confinement method.</p>
<p>These are, this is the basic,</p>
<p>what it is actually, power balances,</p>
<p>just says, oh, there&rsquo;s a certain amount of heat coming in,</p>
<p>which is coming from the fusion reaction itself,</p>
<p>because the fusion reaction heats the fuel,</p>
<p>versus how fast you would lose it.</p>
<p>And it basically summarized,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s summarized by those three parameters,</p>
<p>which is fairly simple.</p>
<p>So temperature, and then the reason we say</p>
<p>100 million degrees is because almost all way in,</p>
<p>in for this kind of fusion, deuterium-tritium fusion,</p>
<p>the minimum in the density,</p>
<p>in the confinement time product is at about 100 million.</p>
<p>So you almost always design your device around that minimum,</p>
<p>and then you try to get it contained well enough,</p>
<p>and you try to get enough density.</p>
<p>So, you know, so that temperature thing sounds crazy, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve actually achieved in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Like our experiment here at MIT,</p>
<p>when it ran at its optimum configuration,</p>
<p>it was at 100 million degrees.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t actually,</p>
<p>the product of the density in the confinement time</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t sufficient that we were at a place</p>
<p>that we were getting high net energy gain,</p>
<p>but it was making fusion reactions.</p>
<p>So this is the sequence that you go through,</p>
<p>make a plasma, then you get it hot enough.</p>
<p>And when you get it hot enough,</p>
<p>the fusion reactions start happening so rapidly</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s overcoming the rate</p>
<p>at which it&rsquo;s leaking heat to the outside world.</p>
<p>And at some point it just becomes like a star,</p>
<p>like a sun and our own sun and a star</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have anything plugged into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just keeping itself hot</p>
<p>through its own fusion reactions.</p>
<p>In the end, that&rsquo;s really close</p>
<p>to what a fusion power plant would look like.</p>
<p>What does it visually look like?</p>
<p>Does it look like, like you said, like purple plasma?</p>
<p>Yeah, actually it&rsquo;s invisible to the eye</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so hot that it&rsquo;s basically emitting light</p>
<p>in frequencies that we can&rsquo;t detect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s invisible.</p>
<p>In fact, light goes through it,</p>
<p>visible light goes through it so easy</p>
<p>that if you were to look at it,</p>
<p>what you would see in our own particular configuration,</p>
<p>what we make is in the end is a donut shaped,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a vacuum vessel to keep the air out of it.</p>
<p>And when you turn on the plasma,</p>
<p>it gets so hot that most of it just disappears</p>
<p>in the visible spectrum.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s very, very cold plasma,</p>
<p>which is between 10 and 100,000 degrees,</p>
<p>which is out in the very periphery of it,</p>
<p>which is kind of, so the very cold plasma</p>
<p>is allowed to interact with the,</p>
<p>kind of has to interact with something eventually</p>
<p>at the boundary of the vacuum vessel.</p>
<p>And this kind of makes a little halo around it</p>
<p>and it glows as beautiful purple light basically.</p>
<p>And these are, that&rsquo;s what we can sense</p>
<p>in the human spectrum.</p>
<p>I remember reading on a subreddit called Shower Thoughts,</p>
<p>which people should check out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fascinating philosophical ideas</p>
<p>that strike you while you&rsquo;re in the shower.</p>
<p>And one of them was, it&rsquo;s lucky that fire,</p>
<p>when it burns, communicates that it&rsquo;s hot</p>
<p>using visible light.</p>
<p>Otherwise, humans would be screwed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a deep, profound truth to that,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, I did find it on Shower Thoughts subreddit.</p>
<p>Actually, I do have, this goes off on a bit of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right, this is actually, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because as a scientist, you also think</p>
<p>about evolutionary functions and how we got,</p>
<p>like, why do we have the senses that we do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Like, why can bees see in the ultraviolet and we can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Then you go, well, it&rsquo;s natural selection.</p>
<p>For some reason, this wasn&rsquo;t really particularly</p>
<p>important to us, right?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we see in the infrared and other things can?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hmm, hmm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the people that could.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating question, right?</p>
<p>Obviously, there&rsquo;s some advantage that you have there</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t there, and even color distinguishing, right,</p>
<p>of something safe to eat, whatever it would be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll actually go back to this because it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that I tell all of my students when I&rsquo;m teaching</p>
<p>ionizing radiation and radiological safety.</p>
<p>Whatever you say, there&rsquo;s a cultural concern</p>
<p>or that when people hear the word radiation,</p>
<p>like, what does this mean?</p>
<p>It literally just means light is what it means, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s light in different parts of the spectrum, right?</p>
<p>And so, it turns out besides the visible light</p>
<p>that we can see here, we are immersed in almost</p>
<p>the totality of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>There is visible light.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s infrared light.</p>
<p>There is microwaves going around us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how our cell phone works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way past our detection capability.</p>
<p>But also higher energy ones, which have to do</p>
<p>with ultraviolet light, how you get a sunburn,</p>
<p>and even x-rays and things like this at small levels</p>
<p>are continually being, like from the concrete</p>
<p>in the walls of this hotel, there&rsquo;s x-rays</p>
<p>hitting our body continuously.</p>
<p>I can bring out a, we can go down to the lab at MIT</p>
<p>and bring out a detector and show you.</p>
<p>Every single room will have these.</p>
<p>By our body, you mean the 10 to the 28 atoms?</p>
<p>Yeah, the 10 to the 28 atoms,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re coming in and they&rsquo;re interacting</p>
<p>with those things.</p>
<p>And those, particularly the ones where the light</p>
<p>is at higher average energy per light particle,</p>
<p>those are the ones that can possibly have an effect</p>
<p>on human health.</p>
<p>So, we have, it&rsquo;s interesting, humans and all animals</p>
<p>have evolved on Earth where we&rsquo;re immersed</p>
<p>in that all the time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a natural source of radiation all the time,</p>
<p>yet we have zero ability to detect it, like zero.</p>
<p>Yeah, and our ability, cognitive ability</p>
<p>to filter it all out and not give a damn.</p>
<p>It would probably overwhelm us, actually,</p>
<p>if we could see all of it.</p>
<p>But my main point goes back to your thing about fire</p>
<p>and self-protection.</p>
<p>If ionizing radiation was such a critical aspect</p>
<p>of the health of organisms on Earth,</p>
<p>we would almost certainly have evolved methods</p>
<p>to detect it, and we have none.</p>
<p>And, yes.</p>
<p>The physical world that&rsquo;s all around us is incredible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re blowing my mind, Dr. Dennis White.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s, so you have experience</p>
<p>with magnetic confinement.</p>
<p>You have experience with inertial confinement.</p>
<p>Most of your work has been in magnetic confinement.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s sort of talk about the sexy recent thing</p>
<p>for a bit of a time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a breakthrough in the news</p>
<p>that laser-based inertial confinement was used</p>
<p>by DOE&rsquo;s National Ignition Facility</p>
<p>at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Can you explain this breakthrough</p>
<p>that happened in December?</p>
<p>So, it goes to the set of criteria</p>
<p>that I talked about before,</p>
<p>about getting high energy gain.</p>
<p>So, in the end, what are we after in fusion</p>
<p>is that we basically assemble this plasma fuel in some way,</p>
<p>and we provide it a starting amount of energy.</p>
<p>Think of lighting the fire.</p>
<p>And what you want to do is get back significant excess gain</p>
<p>from the fact that the fusion is making more,</p>
<p>is releasing the energy.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s like the equivalent of like,</p>
<p>we want to have a match, a small match, light a fire,</p>
<p>and then the fire keeps us hot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much like that.</p>
<p>So, as I said, we&rsquo;ve made many of the,</p>
<p>and what do I mean by we?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the fusion community has pursued aspects of this</p>
<p>through a variety of different confinement methodologies,</p>
<p>is that the key part about what happens,</p>
<p>what was the threshold we had never gotten over before</p>
<p>was that if you only consider the plasma fuel,</p>
<p>not the total engineering system,</p>
<p>but just the plasma fuel itself,</p>
<p>we had not gotten to the point yet</p>
<p>where basically the size of the match</p>
<p>was smaller than the amount of energy</p>
<p>that we got from the fusion.</p>
<p>Is there a good term for when the output</p>
<p>is greater than the input?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, there is.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s several special definitions of this.</p>
<p>So, one of them is that if you, like in a fire,</p>
<p>if you light a match and you have it there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an infinitesimal amount of energy</p>
<p>compared to what you&rsquo;re getting out of the fire,</p>
<p>we call this ignition, which makes sense, right?</p>
<p>This is like what our own sun is as well too.</p>
<p>So, that was not ignition in that sense as well too.</p>
<p>So, what we call this is scientific,</p>
<p>what the one that I just talked about,</p>
<p>which is for some instance,</p>
<p>when I get enough fusion energy released</p>
<p>compared to the size of the match,</p>
<p>we call this scientific breakeven.</p>
<p>Breakeven.</p>
<p>Breakeven, and it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve gotten past the fact</p>
<p>that this is unity now at this point.</p>
<p>What is a fusion gain or as using the notation Q</p>
<p>from the paper overview of the spark talking about,</p>
<p>before we talk, using just the same kind of term.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, so, sorry, the technical term is Q,</p>
<p>capital Q.</p>
<p>Oh, so people actually use Q.</p>
<p>We actually use capital Q, or sometimes it&rsquo;s called Q.</p>
<p>So, Q is taken.</p>
<p>Q sub P or something like this.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is, which means,</p>
<p>what it means is that it&rsquo;s in the plasma.</p>
<p>So, all we&rsquo;re considering is the energy balance</p>
<p>or a gain that comes from the plasma itself.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not considering the technologies which are around it,</p>
<p>which are providing the containment and so forth.</p>
<p>So, why the excitement?</p>
<p>Well, because for one reason,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a rather simple threshold to get over</p>
<p>to understand that you&rsquo;re getting more energy out</p>
<p>from the fusion, even in a theoretical sense,</p>
<p>than you were from the starting match.</p>
<p>Do you mean conceptually simple?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceptually simple that you get past one,</p>
<p>that everyone, like when you&rsquo;re less than one,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much less interesting than getting past one</p>
<p>because obviously you start to get energy gain, yeah.</p>
<p>But it really is a scientific threshold</p>
<p>because what QP actually denotes</p>
<p>is the relative amount of self-heating</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in the plasma.</p>
<p>So, what I mean by this is that in the end,</p>
<p>in these systems, what you want is something</p>
<p>where the relative amount of heating,</p>
<p>which is keeping the fuel hot,</p>
<p>is dominated from the fusion reactions themselves.</p>
<p>And so, it becomes, it&rsquo;s sort of like thinking</p>
<p>like a bonfire is a lot more interesting physically</p>
<p>than just holding a blowtorch to a wet log, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more dynamics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot more self-evolved and so forth.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re excited as scientists</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s clear that in that experiment</p>
<p>that they actually got to a point</p>
<p>where the fusion reactions themselves</p>
<p>were actually altering the state of the plasma.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;d seen it in glimpses before</p>
<p>in magnetic confinement at relatively small levels,</p>
<p>but apparently it seems like in this experiment</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely to be a dominant, dominated by self-heating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very important, that&rsquo;s a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>So, that makes it a self-sustaining type of reaction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more self-sustaining,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more self-referential system in a sense.</p>
<p>And it sort of self-evolves in a way.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s gonna evolve</p>
<p>to a dangerous state, it&rsquo;s just that we want</p>
<p>to see what happens when the fusion</p>
<p>is the dominant heating source.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about that, but there&rsquo;s also another element</p>
<p>which is the inertial confinement,</p>
<p>laser-based inertial confinement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a little bit of an underdog.</p>
<p>So, a lot of the broad nuclear fission community</p>
<p>has been focused on magnetic confinement.</p>
<p>Can you explain just how laser-based</p>
<p>inertial confinement works?</p>
<p>So, it says 192 laser beams were aligned</p>
<p>on a deuterium-tritium-DT target smaller than a pea.</p>
<p>This is like, okay, well, you know, it depends.</p>
<p>Not all peas are made the same.</p>
<p>But this is like throwing a perfect strike</p>
<p>in baseball from a pitch.</p>
<p>This is like a journalist wrote this, I think.</p>
<p>This is like, oh, no, it&rsquo;s not a journalist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s DOE wrote this, Department of Energy.</p>
<p>We try to use all these analogies.</p>
<p>This is like throwing a perfect strike</p>
<p>in baseball from a pitcher&rsquo;s mount</p>
<p>350 miles away from the plate.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Department of Energy.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Energy wrote this.</p>
<p>Can you explain what the lasers?</p>
<p>What actually happens?</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s usually mass confusion about this.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s going on in this form of energy?</p>
<p>So, the fuel is delivered in a discrete,</p>
<p>the fusion fuel, the deuterium-tritium</p>
<p>is in a discrete spherical, it&rsquo;s more like a BB.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it a BB.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s a small one.</p>
<p>And all the fuel that you&rsquo;re gonna try to burn</p>
<p>is basically there, okay?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about that size.</p>
<p>So, how are you going to get,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s at, literally, it&rsquo;s like at 20 degrees</p>
<p>above absolute zero, because the deuterium</p>
<p>and tritium are kept in a liquid and solid state.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So, the fuel is injected not as a gas,</p>
<p>but as a solid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, and it&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>and in these particular experiments,</p>
<p>they can introduce one of these targets</p>
<p>once per day, approximately, something like that.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s a kind of amazing technology,</p>
<p>actually, that I know some of the people</p>
<p>that worked on this back in the,</p>
<p>is they actually make these things</p>
<p>at a BB size of this frozen fuel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually at cryogenic temperatures.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re almost like smooth to the atom level.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re amazing pieces of technology.</p>
<p>So, what you do in the end is think,</p>
<p>what you have is a spherical assembly of this fuel,</p>
<p>like a ball, and what is the purpose of the lasers?</p>
<p>The purpose of the lasers is to provide optical energy</p>
<p>to the very outside of this.</p>
<p>And what happens is that energy is absorbed</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in the solid phase of matter.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s absorbed really in the surface.</p>
<p>And then what happens is that when it&rsquo;s absorbed</p>
<p>in something called the ablator, what does that mean?</p>
<p>It means it goes instantly from the solid phase</p>
<p>to the gas phase.</p>
<p>So, it becomes like a rocket engine.</p>
<p>But you hit it like very uniformly.</p>
<p>So, all, there&rsquo;s like rocket engines</p>
<p>coming off this surface.</p>
<p>Think of like an asteroid almost,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like rockets coming off almost.</p>
<p>So, what does that do?</p>
<p>Well, what does a rocket do?</p>
<p>It actually pushes, by Newton&rsquo;s laws, right?</p>
<p>It pushes the other thing on the other side of it,</p>
<p>equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>It pushes it in.</p>
<p>So, what it does is that the lasers actually don&rsquo;t heat.</p>
<p>This is what was confusing.</p>
<p>People think the lasers, oh, we&rsquo;re gonna get it</p>
<p>to 100 million degrees.</p>
<p>In fact, you want the exact opposite of this.</p>
<p>What you want to do is get essentially a rocket</p>
<p>going out like this.</p>
<p>And then what happens is that the sphere,</p>
<p>and this is happening in a billionth of a second</p>
<p>or less, actually.</p>
<p>This rapidly, that force like so rapidly compresses</p>
<p>the fuel that what happens is that you&rsquo;re squeezing</p>
<p>down on it and it&rsquo;s like, what was the,</p>
<p>see BB, that&rsquo;s bad actually.</p>
<p>I should have started with a basketball.</p>
<p>Goes from like a basketball down to something like this</p>
<p>in a billionth of a second.</p>
<p>And when that happens, I mean, scale that in your mind.</p>
<p>So, when that happens, and this comes from,</p>
<p>almost from classical physics.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s some quantum in it as well too.</p>
<p>But basically, if you can do this like very uniformly</p>
<p>and so-called adiabatically, like you&rsquo;re not actually</p>
<p>heating the fuel, what happens is you get adiabatic</p>
<p>compression such that the very center of this thing</p>
<p>all of a sudden just spikes up in temperature</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually done so fast.</p>
<p>So, why is it called inertial fusion?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re doing this on such fast time scales</p>
<p>that the inertia of the hot fuel basically</p>
<p>is still finite, so it can&rsquo;t like push itself apart</p>
<p>before the fusion happens.</p>
<p>Oh wow, so how do you make it so,</p>
<p>how do you make it so fast?</p>
<p>This is why you use lasers because you&rsquo;re applying</p>
<p>this energy in very, very short periods of time,</p>
<p>like under a fraction of a billionth of a second.</p>
<p>And so, basically that, and then the force</p>
<p>which is coming from this comes from the energy</p>
<p>of the lasers, which is basically the rocket action</p>
<p>which does the compression.</p>
<p>Well, so is the force, is the inward-facing force,</p>
<p>is that increasing the temperature exponentially?</p>
<p>No, you wanna keep the fuel cold</p>
<p>and just literally just ideally compress it.</p>
<p>And then in something which is at the very center</p>
<p>of that compressed sphere, because you&rsquo;ve compressed it</p>
<p>so rapidly, the laws of physics basically require</p>
<p>for it to increase in temperature.</p>
<p>So, the change in pressure.</p>
<p>The effect is like, if you know the thing,</p>
<p>so adiabatic cooling we&rsquo;re actually fairly familiar with.</p>
<p>If you take a spray can, right, and you push the button,</p>
<p>when it rapidly expands, it cools.</p>
<p>This is the nature of a lot of cooling technology</p>
<p>we use actually.</p>
<p>Well, the opposite is true, that if you would take</p>
<p>all of those particles and jam them together</p>
<p>very fast back in, they wanna heat up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>And then what happens is, you basically have this</p>
<p>very cold, compressed set of fusion fuel,</p>
<p>and at the center of this, it goes to this</p>
<p>100 million degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>And so, if it gets to that 100 million degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>the fusion fuel starts to burn.</p>
<p>And when that fusion fuel starts to burn,</p>
<p>it wants to heat up the other cold fuel around it,</p>
<p>and it just basically propagates out so fast</p>
<p>that what you would do, ideally, you would actually burn</p>
<p>in a fusion sense, most of the fuel that&rsquo;s in the pellet.</p>
<p>So, this was very exciting, because what they had done</p>
<p>was, it&rsquo;s clear that they propagated this,</p>
<p>they got this, what they call a hot spot,</p>
<p>and in fact, that this heating had propagated</p>
<p>out into the fuel, and that&rsquo;s the science</p>
<p>behind inertial fusion.</p>
<p>So, the idea behind a reactor that&rsquo;s based on this</p>
<p>kind of inertial confinement is that you would have</p>
<p>a new BB every like?</p>
<p>10 times a second or something like that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some kind of, so there&rsquo;s an incredible device</p>
<p>that you kind of implied that kind of has to create</p>
<p>one of those BBs.</p>
<p>So, you have to make the BBs very fast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s reports on this, but about what does it mean?</p>
<p>The starting point is, can you make this gain?</p>
<p>So, this was a scientific achievement, primarily.</p>
<p>Right, and the rest is just engineering.</p>
<p>No, no, no, the rest is incredibly complicated engineering.</p>
<p>Well, in fact, there&rsquo;s still physics hurdles to overcome.</p>
<p>So, where does this come from?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually because, if you want to make</p>
<p>an energy source out of this, this had a gain</p>
<p>of around 1.5, that namely the fusion energy</p>
<p>was approximately, was 1.5 times the laser input energy.</p>
<p>Okay, this is a fairly significant threshold.</p>
<p>However, from the science of what I just told you,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s two fundamental efficiencies</p>
<p>which come into it, which really come from physics, really.</p>
<p>One of them is hydrodynamic efficiency.</p>
<p>What I mean by this is that it&rsquo;s a rocket.</p>
<p>So, this just has a fundamental efficiency built into it,</p>
<p>which comes out to orders of like 10%.</p>
<p>So, this means is that your ability to do work</p>
<p>on the system is just limited by that, okay.</p>
<p>And then the other one is the efficiency</p>
<p>of laser systems themselves, which if the wall plug</p>
<p>efficiency is 10%, you&rsquo;ve done spectacularly well.</p>
<p>In fact, the wall plug efficiency of the ones</p>
<p>using that experiment are like more like 1%, right.</p>
<p>So, when you go through all of this,</p>
<p>the approximate place that you&rsquo;re ordering this</p>
<p>is for a fusion power plant would be a gain of 100,</p>
<p>not 1.5.</p>
<p>So, you still, you know, and hopefully we see experiments</p>
<p>that keep climbing up towards higher and higher gain.</p>
<p>But then the whole fusion power plant</p>
<p>is a totally different thing.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not one BB and one laser pulse per day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 10 times, five or 10 times per second,</p>
<p>like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, like that, right.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re doing it there.</p>
<p>And then comes the other aspect.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s making the targets, delivering them,</p>
<p>being able to repeatedly get them to burn.</p>
<p>And then we haven&rsquo;t even talked about like,</p>
<p>how do you then get the fusion energy out,</p>
<p>which is mainly because these things are basically</p>
<p>micro implosions which are occurring.</p>
<p>So, this energy is coming out to some medium</p>
<p>on the outside that you&rsquo;ve got to figure out</p>
<p>how to extract the energy out of this thing.</p>
<p>How do you convert that energy to electricity?</p>
<p>So, in the end, you have to basically convert it</p>
<p>into heat in some way.</p>
<p>So, most of the, in the end what fusion makes</p>
<p>mostly is like very energetic particles</p>
<p>from the fusion reaction.</p>
<p>So, you have to slow those down in some way</p>
<p>and then make heat out of it.</p>
<p>So, basically the conversion of the kinetic energy</p>
<p>of the particles into heating some engineered material</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on the outside of this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, from a physics perspective,</p>
<p>is a somewhat solved problem,</p>
<p>but from an engineering is, it&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s still.</p>
<p>Yeah, physics I can draw, I can show you all the equations</p>
<p>that tell you about how it slows down</p>
<p>and converts kinetic energy into heat.</p>
<p>And then what that heat means, you know,</p>
<p>you can write out like an ideal thermal cycle,</p>
<p>like a Carnot cycle.</p>
<p>So, the physics of that, yeah, great.</p>
<p>The integrated engineering of this is a whole other thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask you to maybe talk about the difference</p>
<p>between inertial and magnetic,</p>
<p>but first we&rsquo;ll talk about magnetic.</p>
<p>But let me just linger on this breakthrough.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s nice to have exciting things,</p>
<p>but in a deep human sense,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no competition in science and engineering.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all, like you said, we, we&rsquo;re broad.</p>
<p>First of all, we are humanity altogether.</p>
<p>And you talk about this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bunch of countries collaborating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a nuclear fusion community broadly,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also MIT.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s colors and logos and it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you have friends and colleagues here</p>
<p>that work extremely hard and done some incredible stuff.</p>
<p>Is there some sort of,</p>
<p>how do you feel seeing somebody else get a breakthrough</p>
<p>and using a different technology?</p>
<p>Is that exciting?</p>
<p>Is this, does the competitive fire get-</p>
<p>All of the above.</p>
<p>I mean, I mean-</p>
<p>The ignition?</p>
<p>You know, I have, so, you know, to, you know,</p>
<p>just to wave the flag a little bit.</p>
<p>So, MIT was a central player in this accomplishment.</p>
<p>Interesting, I would say it showed our two,</p>
<p>some of our two best traits.</p>
<p>So, one of them was that the,</p>
<p>like, how do you know that this happened?</p>
<p>This measurement, right?</p>
<p>So, one of the ways to do this is,</p>
<p>if I told you is that in the DT fusion,</p>
<p>what it actually, the product that comes out is helium,</p>
<p>we call an alpha, but it&rsquo;s helium,</p>
<p>and a free neutron, right?</p>
<p>So, the neutron contains 80% of the fusion,</p>
<p>of the energy released by the fusion reaction.</p>
<p>And it also, because it lacks a charge,</p>
<p>it basically tends to just escape and go flying out.</p>
<p>So, this is what we would use eventually for,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mostly what fusion energy would be.</p>
<p>But, so what my colleagues, my scientific colleagues</p>
<p>at the Plaza Science and Fusion Center built</p>
<p>were extraordinary measurement tools</p>
<p>of being able to see the exact details</p>
<p>of not only the number of neutrons that were coming out,</p>
<p>but actually what energy that they&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>And by looking at that configuration,</p>
<p>it reveals enormous, I&rsquo;m not gonna scoop them</p>
<p>because they need to publish the paper,</p>
<p>but it reveals enormous amounts of scientific information</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening in that process</p>
<p>that I just described.</p>
<p>So exciting, I mean, and I have colleagues there</p>
<p>that have worked for 30 years on this, for that moment.</p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;re excited for that, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of those, there is nothing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to describe to people who aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost addicting to be a scientist,</p>
<p>when you get to be at the forefront of research,</p>
<p>of anything.</p>
<p>Like when you see like an actual discovery of some kind</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking at it,</p>
<p>particularly when you&rsquo;re the person who did it, right?</p>
<p>And you go, no human being has ever seen this</p>
<p>or understood this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s pretty thrilling, right?</p>
<p>So even in proxy, it&rsquo;s incredibly thrilling to see this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t wanna say it&rsquo;s rivalry or jealousy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I can tell you already, fusion is really hard.</p>
<p>So anything that keeps pushing the needle forward</p>
<p>is a good thing.</p>
<p>But we also have to be realistic about what it means</p>
<p>to making a fusion energy system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the-</p>
<p>And then, but that&rsquo;s the fun, I mean,</p>
<p>these are still the early steps,</p>
<p>maybe you can say the early leaps.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the magnetic confinement.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is, how does magnetic confinement work?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the tokamak?</p>
<p>Yeah, how does it all work?</p>
<p>So go back to that.</p>
<p>So why inertial confinement works on the same principle</p>
<p>that a star works.</p>
<p>So like, what is the confinement mechanism in the star</p>
<p>is gravity, because it&rsquo;s its own inertia</p>
<p>of something the size of the sun</p>
<p>basically pushes literally a force by gravity</p>
<p>against the center.</p>
<p>So the center is very, very hot, 20 million degrees.</p>
<p>And literally outside the sun, it&rsquo;s essentially zero</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a vacuum of space.</p>
<p>How the hell does that do that?</p>
<p>It does that by, and it&rsquo;s out of,</p>
<p>like, why doesn&rsquo;t it just leak all of its heat?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t leak its heat because it all is held together</p>
<p>by the fact that it can&rsquo;t escape because of its own gravity.</p>
<p>So this is why the fusion happens</p>
<p>in the center of the star.</p>
<p>Like we think of the surface of the sun as being hot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the coldest part of the star.</p>
<p>So if our own sun, this is about 5,500 degrees,</p>
<p>a beautiful symmetry, by the way, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>so how do we know all this?</p>
<p>Because we can&rsquo;t, of course, see directly</p>
<p>into the interior of the sun,</p>
<p>but by knowing the volume and the temperature</p>
<p>of the surface of the sun,</p>
<p>you know exactly how much power it&rsquo;s putting out.</p>
<p>And by this, you know that this is coming</p>
<p>from fusion reactions occurring at exactly the same rate</p>
<p>in the middle of the sun.</p>
<p>Is it possible as a small tangent</p>
<p>to build an inertial confinement system like the sun?</p>
<p>Is it possible to create a sun?</p>
<p>It is, of course, possible to make a sun,</p>
<p>although we do have stars,</p>
<p>but it is not impossible on Earth</p>
<p>because for the simple reason that it takes,</p>
<p>the gravitational force is extremely weak,</p>
<p>and so it takes something like the size of a star</p>
<p>to make fusion occur in the center.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t mean on Earth.</p>
<p>I mean, if you had to build like a second sun,</p>
<p>how would you do it?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s not enough hydrogen around.</p>
<p>So the limiting factor is just the hydrogen.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the forces and energy that it takes</p>
<p>to assemble that is just mind-boggling.</p>
<p>All right, to be continued.</p>
<p>Yeah, to be continued.</p>
<p>So what are we doing it with?</p>
<p>So in the one that I just described,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you say, so you have to replace this</p>
<p>with some force which is better than that.</p>
<p>And so what I mean by that is it&rsquo;s stronger than that.</p>
<p>So when I talked about the laser fusion,</p>
<p>this is coming from the force,</p>
<p>which is enormous compared to gravity,</p>
<p>like from the rocket action of pushing it together.</p>
<p>So in magnetic confinement, we use another force of nature,</p>
<p>which is the electromagnetic force.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s orders and orders of magnitude</p>
<p>stronger than the gravitational force.</p>
<p>And the key force that matters here</p>
<p>is that if you have a charged particle,</p>
<p>that namely it&rsquo;s a particle that has an electric,</p>
<p>net electric charge,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in the proximity of a magnetic field,</p>
<p>then there is a force which is exerted on that particle.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s called the Lorentz force</p>
<p>for those who are keeping track.</p>
<p>So that is the force that we use</p>
<p>to replace physical containment.</p>
<p>So this again, how do you hold something</p>
<p>at a hundred million degrees?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible in a physical container.</p>
<p>This is not like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not this plastic bottle holding in this liquid</p>
<p>or a gas chamber.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re immersing the fuel in a magnetic field</p>
<p>that basically exerts a force at a distance.</p>
<p>This comes back again to again,</p>
<p>like why plazas are so strange.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing here.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s immersed in this magnetic field,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not actually physically touching it,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re making a force go onto it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the inherent feature of magnetic confinement.</p>
<p>And then magnetic confinement devices</p>
<p>are like a tokamak, are basically configurations</p>
<p>which exploit the features of that magnetic containment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several features to it.</p>
<p>One is that the stronger the strength</p>
<p>of the magnetic field, the stronger the force.</p>
<p>And for this reason is that if you increase</p>
<p>the strength of magnetic fields,</p>
<p>this means that the containment,</p>
<p>because namely the force which you&rsquo;re pushing against it</p>
<p>is more effective.</p>
<p>And the other feature is that there is no force.</p>
<p>So for those who remember magnetic fields,</p>
<p>what are these things?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also invisible.</p>
<p>But if you think of a permanent magnets</p>
<p>or your fridge magnet, there are field lines</p>
<p>which we actually designate as arrows,</p>
<p>which are going around.</p>
<p>You sometimes see this in school</p>
<p>when you have the iron filings on a thing</p>
<p>and you see the directions of the magnetic field lines</p>
<p>or when you use a compass, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s telling you north because we&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>in an immersed magnetic field made by the earth,</p>
<p>which is at very low intensity magnetic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s strong enough</p>
<p>where we can actually see what direction is it.</p>
<p>So this is the arrow that the magnetic field is pointing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always pointing north and for us.</p>
<p>So an interesting feature of this force</p>
<p>is that there is no force along the direction</p>
<p>of the magnetic field.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only force in the directions</p>
<p>orthogonal to the magnetic field.</p>
<p>So this, by the way, is a huge deal</p>
<p>in a whole other discipline of plasma physics,</p>
<p>which is like the study of our near atmosphere.</p>
<p>So the study of aurora borealis,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in the near atmosphere,</p>
<p>what happens when solar flares hit the magnetic field.</p>
<p>In fact, remember I said fusion is the reason</p>
<p>that life is responsible in the universe?</p>
<p>Well, you could also argue so is magnetic confinement</p>
<p>because the charged particles which are being emitted</p>
<p>from the galaxy and from our own star,</p>
<p>would be very, very damaging on Earth.</p>
<p>So we get two layers of protection.</p>
<p>One is the atmosphere itself,</p>
<p>but the other one is the magnetic field</p>
<p>which surrounds the Earth</p>
<p>and basically traps these charged particles</p>
<p>so they can&rsquo;t get away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same deal.</p>
<p>How do you create a strong magnetic field?</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>With a giant magnet.</p>
<p>Giant magnet, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically true.</p>
<p>Engineering is awesome.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s essentially two ways to create a magnet.</p>
<p>So one of them is that we&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with like fridge magnets and so forth.</p>
<p>These are so-called permanent magnets.</p>
<p>And what it means is that within these,</p>
<p>the atoms arrange in a particular way</p>
<p>that it produces, the electrons basically arrange</p>
<p>in a particular way that it produces</p>
<p>a permanent magnetic field that is set by the material.</p>
<p>So those have a fundamental limitation</p>
<p>how strong they can be.</p>
<p>And they also tend to have this like circle</p>
<p>or shape like this.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t typically use those.</p>
<p>So what we use are so-called electromagnets.</p>
<p>And what is this?</p>
<p>So the other way to make a magnetic field,</p>
<p>also go back to your elementary school physics</p>
<p>or science class, is that you take a nail</p>
<p>and you wrap a copper wire around it</p>
<p>and connect it to a battery.</p>
<p>Then it can pick up iron filings.</p>
<p>This is an electromagnet.</p>
<p>At its simplest, what it is, it&rsquo;s an electric current</p>
<p>which is going in a pattern around and around and around.</p>
<p>And what this does is it produces a magnetic field</p>
<p>which goes through it by the laws of electromagnetism.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how we make the magnetic field</p>
<p>in these configurations.</p>
<p>And the key there is that it&rsquo;s not limited</p>
<p>by the magnetic property of the material.</p>
<p>The magnetic field amplitude is set</p>
<p>by the amount of the geometry of this thing</p>
<p>and the amount of electric current</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re putting through.</p>
<p>And the more electric current that you put through,</p>
<p>the more magnetic field that you get.</p>
<p>The closest one that people maybe see</p>
<p>is one of my favorite skits, actually,</p>
<p>was Super Dave Osborne on, it&rsquo;s probably past,</p>
<p>he was in a show called Bizarre.</p>
<p>Super Dave Osborne, which is a great comedian called,</p>
<p>he was a stuntman and one of his tricks</p>
<p>was that he gets into a car and then one of those things</p>
<p>in the junkyard comes down and picks up the car</p>
<p>and then puts it into the crusher.</p>
<p>This is his stunt, which is pretty hilarious.</p>
<p>Anyway, but that thing that picks him up,</p>
<p>how does that work?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not a permanent magnet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an electromagnet.</p>
<p>And so you can turn, by turning off and on the power supply,</p>
<p>it turns off and on the magnetic field.</p>
<p>So this means you can pick it up</p>
<p>and then when you switch it off,</p>
<p>the magnetic field goes away and the car drops, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what it looks like.</p>
<p>Speaking of giant magnets,</p>
<p>MIT and Commonwealth Fusion Systems, CFS,</p>
<p>built a very large, high-temperature,</p>
<p>superconducting electromagnet that was ramped up</p>
<p>to a field strength of 20 tesla,</p>
<p>the most powerful magnetic field of its kind</p>
<p>ever created on Earth.</p>
<p>Because I enjoy this kind of thing,</p>
<p>can you please tell me about this magnet?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s fun, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to parse there.</p>
<p>So maybe, so we already explained an electromagnet,</p>
<p>which in general is what you do is you take electric current</p>
<p>and you force it to follow a pattern of some kind,</p>
<p>typically like a circular pattern,</p>
<p>around and around and around and around.</p>
<p>It goes the more time, the more current</p>
<p>and the more times it goes around,</p>
<p>the stronger the magnetic field that you make of it.</p>
<p>And as I pointed out, it&rsquo;s like really important</p>
<p>in magnetic confinement because it is the force</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s produced by that magnet.</p>
<p>In fact, technically it goes like the magnetic field squared</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a pressure which is actually being exerted</p>
<p>on the plasma to keep it contained.</p>
<p>Just so we know, for magnetic confinement,</p>
<p>what is usually the geometry of the magnet?</p>
<p>The geometry, yeah, so the geometry is typically</p>
<p>that typically is what you do is you want to produce</p>
<p>a magnetic field that loops back on itself.</p>
<p>And the reason for this was, goes down to the nature</p>
<p>of the force that I described, which is that there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no containment or force along the direction</p>
<p>of the magnetic field.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a magnetic field.</p>
<p>In fact, what it&rsquo;s more technically</p>
<p>or more graphically what it&rsquo;s doing is that</p>
<p>when the plasma is, here&rsquo;s plasma particles here,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a magnetic field, what it does is it forces</p>
<p>all those, because of this Lorentz force,</p>
<p>it makes all of those charged particles execute</p>
<p>circular orbits around the magnetic field.</p>
<p>And they go around like this, but they stream freely</p>
<p>along the magnetic field line.</p>
<p>So this is why the nature of the containment is that</p>
<p>if you can get that circle smaller and smaller,</p>
<p>it stays further away from Earth, temperature materials.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the confinement gets better.</p>
<p>But the problem is, is that because it free streams along,</p>
<p>so we just have a long straight magnetic field,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;ll just keep leaking out the ends like really fast.</p>
<p>So you get rid of the ends.</p>
<p>So you basically loop it back around.</p>
<p>So what these look like are typically donut shaped</p>
<p>or more technically toroidal shape,</p>
<p>but donut shaped things where this collection</p>
<p>of magnetic fields loops back on itself.</p>
<p>And it also, for reasons which are more complicated</p>
<p>to explain, basically it also twists slowly around</p>
<p>in this direction as well too.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what it looks like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the plasma looks like,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what the fuel looks like.</p>
<p>So then this means is that the electromagnets</p>
<p>are configured in such a way that it produces</p>
<p>the desired magnetic fields around this.</p>
<p>So the-</p>
<p>How precise does this have to be?</p>
<p>You were probably listening to our conversation</p>
<p>with some of my colleagues yesterday.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually, it depends on the configuration</p>
<p>about how you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>The configuration of the plasma, sorry.</p>
<p>The configuration of the electromagnets</p>
<p>and about how you&rsquo;re achieving this requirement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fairly precise, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be,</p>
<p>particularly in something like a tokamak,</p>
<p>what we do is we produce planar coils,</p>
<p>which just mean they&rsquo;re flat, and we situate them.</p>
<p>So if you think of a circle like this,</p>
<p>what does it produce?</p>
<p>If you put current through it, it produces a magnetic field,</p>
<p>which goes through the circle like this.</p>
<p>So if you align many of them like this, this, this, this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s things online, you can go see the picture.</p>
<p>You keep arranging these around in a circle itself.</p>
<p>This forces the magnetic field lines</p>
<p>to basically just keep executing around like this.</p>
<p>So you tend to align.</p>
<p>That one tends to, well, it requires good alignment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like insane alignment</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re actually exploiting the symmetry</p>
<p>of the situation to help it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another kind of configuration of magnetic,</p>
<p>of this kind of magnetic confinement called a stellarator,</p>
<p>which is, we have these names for historic reasons.</p>
<p>Which is different than a tokamak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different than a tokamak,</p>
<p>but actually works on the same physical principle,</p>
<p>that namely, in the end, it produces a plasma,</p>
<p>which loops in magnetic fields,</p>
<p>which loop back on themselves as well.</p>
<p>But in that case, the totality, basically,</p>
<p>the totality of the confining magnetic field</p>
<p>is produced by external three-dimensional magnets,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re twisted.</p>
<p>And it turns out the precision of those is more stringent.</p>
<p>So are tokamaks by far more popular</p>
<p>for research and development currently than stellarators?</p>
<p>Of the concepts which are there,</p>
<p>the tokamak is by far the most mature</p>
<p>in terms of its breadth of performance</p>
<p>and thinking about how it would be applied</p>
<p>in a fusion energy system.</p>
<p>And the history of this was that many,</p>
<p>in fact, you asked, if we go back to the history</p>
<p>of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center,</p>
<p>the history of fusion is that people,</p>
<p>scientists had started to work on this in the 1950s.</p>
<p>It was all hush-hush and Cold War and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, they realized, holy cow,</p>
<p>this is really hard.</p>
<p>We actually don&rsquo;t really know what we&rsquo;re doing in this,</p>
<p>because everything was at low temperatures,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t get confinement.</p>
<p>It was interesting.</p>
<p>And then they declassified it,</p>
<p>and this is one of the few places</p>
<p>that the West and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>actually collaborated on was the science of this.</p>
<p>Even during the Cold War.</p>
<p>Even during the middle of the Cold War.</p>
<p>It was really, and this actually perpetuates</p>
<p>all the way to now for, we can talk about the project</p>
<p>that that has sort of captured in now.</p>
<p>But, and the reason they declassified it</p>
<p>was because everything kind of sucked, basically,</p>
<p>about trying to make this confinement</p>
<p>in high-temperature plasma.</p>
<p>And then the Russians, then the Soviets,</p>
<p>came along with this device called a tokamak,</p>
<p>which is a Russian acronym,</p>
<p>which basically means magnetic coils</p>
<p>arranged in the shape of a donut.</p>
<p>And they said, holy cow, like everyone was stuck</p>
<p>at like a meager, like half a million degrees,</p>
<p>half a million degrees, which is like infusion</p>
<p>in terms of zero, basically.</p>
<p>And then they come along and they say,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;ve actually achieved a temperature</p>
<p>20 times higher than everybody else.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually started to make fusion reactions.</p>
<p>And everyone just go, oh, you know, no way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hype from the, it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve failed at this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great story in the history of fusion is that then,</p>
<p>but they insisted, they said, no, look,</p>
<p>you can see this from our data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this thing is really hot</p>
<p>and it seems to be working.</p>
<p>This is, you know, late 1960s.</p>
<p>And there was a team that went from the United Kingdom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fusion development lab and they brought this very fancy,</p>
<p>amazing new technology called a laser.</p>
<p>And they use this laser and they shot the laser beam</p>
<p>like through the plasma.</p>
<p>And by looking at the scattered light that came from that,</p>
<p>they go, basically the scattered light gets more broadened</p>
<p>in its spectrum if it gets hotter.</p>
<p>So you could exactly tell the temperature of this.</p>
<p>And even though you&rsquo;re not physically touching the plasma,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, holy cow, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It is like, it is 10 million degrees.</p>
<p>And so this was one of those explosions of like everyone</p>
<p>in the world then wanted to build a tokamak</p>
<p>because it was clearly like, wow, this is like so far ahead</p>
<p>of everything else that we tried before.</p>
<p>So that actually has a part of the story to MIT</p>
<p>and the Plasma Science and Fusion Center was,</p>
<p>why is there a strong fusion</p>
<p>and a major fusion program at MIT?</p>
<p>It was because we were host</p>
<p>to the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory,</p>
<p>which is also the National High Field Magnet Laboratory.</p>
<p>Well, you can see where this goes, right?</p>
<p>From this, we&rsquo;re kind of telling the stories</p>
<p>backwards almost, but the advent of a tokamak</p>
<p>along with the fact that you could make</p>
<p>very strong magnetic fields with the technology</p>
<p>that had been developed at that laboratory,</p>
<p>that was the origins of sort of pushing together</p>
<p>the physics of the plasma containment</p>
<p>and the magnet technology and put them together</p>
<p>in a way that I would say is a very typical</p>
<p>MIT success story, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do just pure science or pure technology,</p>
<p>we sort of set up this intersection between them.</p>
<p>And there were several pioneers of people at MIT,</p>
<p>like Bruno Coppi, who&rsquo;s a professor</p>
<p>in the physics department and Ron Parker,</p>
<p>who was a professor in electrical engineering</p>
<p>and nuclear engineering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like even the makeup of the people, right?</p>
<p>Has got this blends of science and engineering in them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually was the origin</p>
<p>of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center</p>
<p>was doing those things.</p>
<p>So anyway, so back to this.</p>
<p>So why, so yes, tokamaks have been,</p>
<p>have achieved the highest in magnetic fusion by far,</p>
<p>like the best amounts of these conditions</p>
<p>that I talked about.</p>
<p>And in fact, pushed right up to the point</p>
<p>where they were near QP of one.</p>
<p>They just didn&rsquo;t quite get over one.</p>
<p>So can we actually just linger on the collaboration</p>
<p>across different nations?</p>
<p>Just maybe looking at the philosophical aspect of this.</p>
<p>Even in the Cold War,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something hopeful to me besides the energy</p>
<p>that these giant international projects</p>
<p>are a really powerful way to ease</p>
<p>some of the geopolitical tension,</p>
<p>even military conflict across nations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a war in Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a brewing tension and conflict with China.</p>
<p>Just the world is still seeking military conflict,</p>
<p>cold or hot.</p>
<p>What can you say about sort of the lessons</p>
<p>of the 20th century in these giant projects</p>
<p>in their ability to ease some of this tension?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So as I said, there was a reason because it was so hard,</p>
<p>that was one of the reasons they declassified it.</p>
<p>And actually they started working together</p>
<p>in some sense on it as well, too.</p>
<p>And I think it was really, there was a heuristic</p>
<p>or altruistic aspect to this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is something that could change</p>
<p>the future of humanity and its nature</p>
<p>and its relationship with energy.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this something that we should work on together?</p>
<p>Right, and that went along in those ones.</p>
<p>And in particularly, that any kind of place</p>
<p>where you can actually have an open exchange</p>
<p>of people who are sort of at the intellectual frontiers</p>
<p>of your society, this is a good thing, right,</p>
<p>of being able to collaborate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the, I mean, I have had an amazing career.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with people from, it&rsquo;s like hard</p>
<p>to throw a dart at a country on the map</p>
<p>and not hit a country of people</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been able to work with.</p>
<p>How amazing is that?</p>
<p>And even just getting small numbers of people</p>
<p>to bridge the cultural and societal divides</p>
<p>is a very important thing.</p>
<p>Even when it&rsquo;s a very teeny fraction</p>
<p>of the overall populations, it can be held up</p>
<p>as an example of that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting that if you look at then</p>
<p>that continued collaboration, which continues to this day,</p>
<p>is that it was, this actually played a major role, in fact,</p>
<p>in East-West relations or like Soviet-West relations,</p>
<p>is that back in the Reagan-Gorbachev days,</p>
<p>which of course were interesting in themselves</p>
<p>of all kinds of changes happening on both sides, right?</p>
<p>But still like a desire to push down the stockpile</p>
<p>of nuclear weapons and all that, within that context,</p>
<p>there was a fairly significant historic event</p>
<p>that at one of the Reagan-Gorbachev summits</p>
<p>is that they had really, they didn&rsquo;t get there.</p>
<p>Like they couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to bargain</p>
<p>to the point of some part of the tree</p>
<p>to get any more of the details of it anymore.</p>
<p>But they needed some kind of a symbol almost to say,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re still gonna keep working</p>
<p>towards something that&rsquo;s important for all of us.</p>
<p>What did they pick?</p>
<p>A fusion project.</p>
<p>And that was in the mid-1980s</p>
<p>and actually then after,</p>
<p>so they basically signed an agreement</p>
<p>that they would move forward</p>
<p>to like literally collaborate on a project</p>
<p>whose idea would be to show large net energy gain</p>
<p>in fusion&rsquo;s commercial viability and work together on that.</p>
<p>And very soon after that,</p>
<p>Japan joined as did the European Union.</p>
<p>And now that project, it evolved over a long period of time</p>
<p>and had some interesting political ramifications to it.</p>
<p>But in the end, this actually also had South Korea,</p>
<p>India, and China join as well too.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about a major fraction of,</p>
<p>and now Russia, of course, instead of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And actually that coalition is holding together</p>
<p>despite the obvious political turmoil</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going around on all those things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a project called ITER,</p>
<p>which is under construction in the South of France</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>Before we turn to the giant magnet</p>
<p>and maybe even talk about Spark</p>
<p>and the stuff going, all amazing stuff going on at MIT,</p>
<p>what is ITER?</p>
<p>What is this international nuclear fusion megaproject</p>
<p>being built in the South of France?</p>
<p>So its scientific purpose is a worthy one</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s essentially in any fusion device,</p>
<p>the thing that you want to see</p>
<p>is more and more relative amounts of self-heating.</p>
<p>And this is something that had not been seen,</p>
<p>although we have made fusion reactions</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d seen small amounts of the self-heating,</p>
<p>we never got to a dominant,</p>
<p>this actually goes to this QP business, okay?</p>
<p>The goal of ITER,</p>
<p>and it shifted around a little bit historically,</p>
<p>but fairly quickly became,</p>
<p>we want to get to a large amount of self-heating.</p>
<p>So this is why it has,</p>
<p>its primary feature is to get to QP of around 10.</p>
<p>And through this, this is a way to study this plasma</p>
<p>that has more higher levels of self-determination</p>
<p>around on it.</p>
<p>But it also has another feature,</p>
<p>which was let&rsquo;s produce fusion power at a relevant scale.</p>
<p>And actually they&rsquo;re linked together,</p>
<p>which actually makes sense when you think about it,</p>
<p>is that because the fusion power</p>
<p>is the heating source itself,</p>
<p>this means that they&rsquo;re linked together.</p>
<p>And so ITER is projected to make</p>
<p>about 500 million watts of fusion power.</p>
<p>So this is a significant amount,</p>
<p>like this is what you would use for powering cities.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the research,</p>
<p>it is the development of really trying to achieve scale here.</p>
<p>So self-heating and scale.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes.</p>
<p>So this meant then, too,</p>
<p>is the development of an industrial base</p>
<p>that can actually produce the technologies</p>
<p>like the electromagnets and so forth.</p>
<p>And to do it with, it is a tokamak.</p>
<p>It is one of these, yes.</p>
<p>But very interesting,</p>
<p>it also revealed limitations of this as well, too.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting is that</p>
<p>it is clearly on paper,</p>
<p>and in fact, and in practice as well, too,</p>
<p>the world, and very different political systems,</p>
<p>and you consider at least geopolitical</p>
<p>or economic rivals or whatever you want to use.</p>
<p>Like working towards a common cause,</p>
<p>and one that we all think is worthy,</p>
<p>is very like, okay, that&rsquo;s very satisfying.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also interesting to see the limitations of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because, well, you&rsquo;ve got seven chefs in the kitchen.</p>
<p>So what has this meant in terms of the speed of the project</p>
<p>and the ability to govern it and so forth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just been a challenge, honestly, around this.</p>
<p>And this is, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard technically what&rsquo;s occurring.</p>
<p>But when you also introduce such levels of,</p>
<p>I mean, this isn&rsquo;t just me saying it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like GAO reports from the US government</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to like steer all of this around.</p>
<p>And what that&rsquo;s tended to do is make it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the fastest decision-making process.</p>
<p>My own personal view of it was,</p>
<p>it was interesting, because you asked,</p>
<p>you said about the magnet and commonwealth fusion systems.</p>
<p>It was, I worked most of my career on ITER,</p>
<p>because when I came into the field in the early 1990s,</p>
<p>when I completed my PhD and started to work,</p>
<p>this was one of the most,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t imagine being more excited about something.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to change the world with this project.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do these things.</p>
<p>And we just poured an entire generation,</p>
<p>and afterwards as well, too,</p>
<p>just poured their imagination and their creativity</p>
<p>about making this thing work.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>But also at some point, though,</p>
<p>when it got to being another five years of delay</p>
<p>or a decade of delay, you start asking yourself,</p>
<p>well, is this what I want to do?</p>
<p>Right, am I going to wait for this?</p>
<p>So it was a part of me starting to ask questions</p>
<p>with my students.</p>
<p>I was like, is there another way</p>
<p>that we can get to this extremely worthwhile goal</p>
<p>that maybe it&rsquo;s not that pathway?</p>
<p>And the other part that was clearly frustrating to me,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m an advocate of fusion.</p>
<p>You asked me about, was I, you know,</p>
<p>I was like, well, it&rsquo;s a laser fusion</p>
<p>or inertial fusion or magnetic fusion.</p>
<p>I just want fusion energy, okay?</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s so important to the world is that,</p>
<p>but the other thing, if that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>then why do we have only one attempt at it</p>
<p>on the entire planet, which was ITERF?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that makes no sense to me, right?</p>
<p>We should have multiple attempts at this</p>
<p>with different levels of whatever you want to think about it,</p>
<p>technical, schedule, scientific risk,</p>
<p>which are incorporated in them,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to give us a better chance</p>
<p>of actually getting to the goal line.</p>
<p>With that spirit, you&rsquo;re leading MIT&rsquo;s effort</p>
<p>to design SPARC, a compact, high-field,</p>
<p>DT-burning tokamak.</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the motivation?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the design?</p>
<p>What are the ideas behind it?</p>
<p>At its heart, it&rsquo;s exactly the same concept as ITER.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically a configuration of electromagnets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s arranged in the shape of a donut.</p>
<p>And within that, we would do the same thing</p>
<p>that happens in all the other tokamaks</p>
<p>and including in ITER and in this one,</p>
<p>is that namely, you put in gas,</p>
<p>make it into a plasma, you heat it up,</p>
<p>it gets to about 100 million degrees.</p>
<p>The differentiator in SPARC is that</p>
<p>we use the actual deuterium-tritium fuel,</p>
<p>and because of the access to very high magnetic fields,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in a very compact space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very small.</p>
<p>What do I mean by small?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s 40 times smaller in volume than ITER,</p>
<p>but it uses exactly the same physical principles.</p>
<p>So this comes from the high magnetic field.</p>
<p>So in the end, why does this matter?</p>
<p>What it does is it does those things,</p>
<p>and it should get to the point where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s producing over 100 million watts of fusion power,</p>
<p>but remember, it&rsquo;s 40 times smaller.</p>
<p>So ITER was 500 megawatts.</p>
<p>Technically, our design is around 150 megawatts,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s only about a factor of three difference</p>
<p>despite being 40 times smaller,</p>
<p>and we see QP large,</p>
<p>order of 10 or something like this.</p>
<p>At that state, it&rsquo;s very important scientifically</p>
<p>because this basically matches what ITER is looking to do.</p>
<p>The plasma&rsquo;s dominated by its own heating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very important,</p>
<p>and it does that for about 10 seconds,</p>
<p>and the reason it&rsquo;s for 10 seconds is that</p>
<p>that basically allows everything to settle</p>
<p>in terms of the fusion in the plasma equilibrium.</p>
<p>Everything is nice and settled,</p>
<p>so you know you have seen the physical state</p>
<p>at which you would expect a power plant</p>
<p>to operate basically for magnetic fusion.</p>
<p>Like, wow, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more than that, and it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because about who&rsquo;s building it</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s being financed.</p>
<p>So that scientific pathway was made possible</p>
<p>by the fact that we had access</p>
<p>to a next generation of magnet technology.</p>
<p>So to explain this real quick, why do we call it,</p>
<p>you said it in the words, a superconducting magnet.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>Superconducting magnet means that the materials</p>
<p>which are in the electromagnet</p>
<p>have no electrical resistance.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the electric current is put into it,</p>
<p>the current goes around unimpeded,</p>
<p>so it could basically keep going around and around</p>
<p>technically for infinity, or for eternity.</p>
<p>And what that means is that when you energize</p>
<p>these large electromagnets,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using basically zero electrical power</p>
<p>to maintain them, whereas if you would do this</p>
<p>in a normal wire, like copper,</p>
<p>you basically make an enormous toaster oven</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s consuming enormous amounts of power</p>
<p>and getting hot, which is a problem.</p>
<p>That was the technical breakthrough</p>
<p>that was realized by myself and at the time,</p>
<p>my students and postdocs and colleagues at MIT,</p>
<p>was that we saw the advent of this new superconducting</p>
<p>material, which would allow us to access</p>
<p>much higher magnetic fields.</p>
<p>It was basically a next generation of the technology,</p>
<p>and it was quite disruptive to fusion,</p>
<p>but namely what it would allow,</p>
<p>that if we could get to this point</p>
<p>where we can make the round 20 Tesla,</p>
<p>we knew by the rules of tokamaks</p>
<p>that this is going to allow us to vastly shrink</p>
<p>the sizes of these devices.</p>
<p>So it wouldn&rsquo;t take, although it&rsquo;s a worthy goal,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t take a seven nation international treaty</p>
<p>basically to build it.</p>
<p>You could build it with a company and a university.</p>
<p>So same kind of design,</p>
<p>but now using the superconducting magnets.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if in fact, if you look at it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you just expand the size of it,</p>
<p>they look almost identical to each other</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s based on the,</p>
<p>and actually that comes for a reason, by the way,</p>
<p>is that it also looks like a bigger version</p>
<p>of the tokamak that we ran at MIT for 20 years,</p>
<p>where we established the scientific benefits,</p>
<p>in fact, of these higher magnetic fields.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the pathway that we&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>So we say, so what does this mean?</p>
<p>The context is different because it was made,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s primarily being made</p>
<p>by a private sector company spun out of MIT,</p>
<p>because the way that it raised money</p>
<p>and the purpose of the entity, which is there,</p>
<p>is to make commercial fusion power plants,</p>
<p>not just to make a scientific experiment.</p>
<p>This is actually why we have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s why we have a partnership, right?</p>
<p>Is that our purpose at MIT is not to commercialize directly,</p>
<p>but boy, do we want to advance the technology</p>
<p>and the science that comes along with this,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the reason we&rsquo;re sort of doing it together.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s MIT and Commonwealth Fusion Systems.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting to say about financing?</p>
<p>And this seems like, from a scientific perspective,</p>
<p>maybe not an interesting topic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s perhaps an extremely interesting topic.</p>
<p>I mean, you can just look at the tension</p>
<p>between SpaceX and NASA, for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just clear that there&rsquo;s different financing mechanisms</p>
<p>can actually significantly accelerate</p>
<p>the development of science and engineering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great that you brought that up.</p>
<p>We use several historic analogs,</p>
<p>and one of them is around SpaceX,</p>
<p>which is an appropriate one</p>
<p>because space, putting things into orbit</p>
<p>has a minimum size to it</p>
<p>and integrated technological complexity</p>
<p>and budget and things like this.</p>
<p>So our point when we were talking about</p>
<p>starting a fusion commercialization company,</p>
<p>people look at you like,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this still really just a science experiment?</p>
<p>But one of the things that we pointed to was SpaceX</p>
<p>to say, well, tell me, like 25 years ago,</p>
<p>how many people would have voted</p>
<p>that the leading entity on the planet</p>
<p>to put things into orbit&rsquo;s a private company?</p>
<p>People would have thought you were nutso, right?</p>
<p>And what is interesting about SpaceX</p>
<p>was that it proved it&rsquo;s more than actually just financing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the purpose of the organization.</p>
<p>So the purpose of a,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not against public finance or anything like that,</p>
<p>but the purpose of a public entity like NASA</p>
<p>correctly speaks to the political,</p>
<p>because the cost comes from the political assembly</p>
<p>that is there and I guess from us eventually as well too,</p>
<p>but its purpose wasn&rsquo;t about making a commercial product.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about fundamental discovery and so forth,</p>
<p>which is all really great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why did SpaceX,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting, why did SpaceX succeed so well</p>
<p>is because the idea was,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the focus that comes in the idea</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to relentlessly reduce cost</p>
<p>and increase efficiency is a drive</p>
<p>that comes from the commercial aspect of it, right?</p>
<p>And this also then changes the people in the teams</p>
<p>which are doing as well too.</p>
<p>And in fact, trickles throughout the whole thing</p>
<p>because the purpose isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re advancing things,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s really good that we can put things in orbit</p>
<p>a lot more cheaply.</p>
<p>Like it advances science,</p>
<p>which is an interesting synergy, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same thing that we think</p>
<p>is gonna happen in fusion, that namely,</p>
<p>this is a bootstrap effect that actually,</p>
<p>that when you start to push yourself</p>
<p>to think about near-term commercialization,</p>
<p>it allows the science to get in hand faster,</p>
<p>which then allows the commercialization to go faster</p>
<p>and up we go.</p>
<p>By the way, we&rsquo;ve seen this also in another,</p>
<p>again, you have to watch out with analogies</p>
<p>because they can go so far,</p>
<p>but like biotech is another one.</p>
<p>Like you look at the Human Genome Project,</p>
<p>which was, it&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>to me, that&rsquo;s like mapping the human genome</p>
<p>is like that we can make net energy from fusion.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s one of those, like in your drawer that you go,</p>
<p>this is a significant achievement by humanity,</p>
<p>right, in this century.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the Human Genome Project,</p>
<p>fully government funded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take 20, 25 years</p>
<p>because we basically know the technology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just gonna be really diligent,</p>
<p>keep going, da, da, da, da.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, what comes along?</p>
<p>Disruptive technology, right?</p>
<p>You can sequence, you know,</p>
<p>shotgun sequencing and computer recognition patterns.</p>
<p>And basically, oh, I can do this 100 times faster.</p>
<p>Like, wow, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really the, you know,</p>
<p>to me, the story about why we started,</p>
<p>why we launched Commwith Fusion Systems</p>
<p>was more than just about another source of funding,</p>
<p>which it is a different source of funding</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also a different purpose,</p>
<p>which is very important.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also something about</p>
<p>a mechanism that creates culture.</p>
<p>So giving power to like a young student,</p>
<p>ambitious student, to have a tremendous impact</p>
<p>on the progress of nuclear fusion</p>
<p>creates a culture that actually makes</p>
<p>progress more aggressively.</p>
<p>Like you said, when seven nations collaborate,</p>
<p>it gives more incentive to the bureaucracy</p>
<p>to slow things down, to kind of have,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s first have a discussion,</p>
<p>and certainly don&rsquo;t give voice to the young,</p>
<p>ambitious minds that are really pushing stuff forward.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about like the private sector</p>
<p>that rewards, encourages, inspires young minds</p>
<p>to say in the most beautiful of ways,</p>
<p>F you to the boss, to sort of like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll make it faster, we&rsquo;ll make it simpler,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll make it better, we&rsquo;ll make it cheaper.</p>
<p>And sometimes that brashness doesn&rsquo;t bear out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an aspect that you just take</p>
<p>a different risk profile as well too.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s this, of the,</p>
<p>I mean, it was interesting, our own trajectory</p>
<p>at the fusion center was, like we were pushed</p>
<p>into this place by necessity as well too</p>
<p>because I told you we have, and we had operated</p>
<p>for a long time, a tokamak on the MIT campus,</p>
<p>achieved these world records,</p>
<p>like 100 million degree plasma,</p>
<p>and so I was like, wow, this is fantastic.</p>
<p>But somewhat ironically, I have to say,</p>
<p>is that it was like, oh, but we&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t the future of fusion anymore.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re not, we&rsquo;re just gonna stop</p>
<p>with small projects because it&rsquo;s too small, right?</p>
<p>So we should need, we need to really move</p>
<p>on to these much bigger projects</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really the future of fusion.</p>
<p>And so it was defunded, and this basically</p>
<p>put at risk, like we were going to essentially</p>
<p>lose MIT in the ecosystem, really, of fusion,</p>
<p>both from the research, but also clearly important</p>
<p>from the educational part of it.</p>
<p>So we, you know, we pushed back against this,</p>
<p>we got a lifeline, we were able to go,</p>
<p>and it was in this time scale that we basically</p>
<p>came up with this idea, it&rsquo;s like, we should do this.</p>
<p>And in the end, it was all of those,</p>
<p>the people who were in the C level of the company</p>
<p>were all literally students who got caught in that.</p>
<p>They were PhD students at the time.</p>
<p>So you talk about enabling another generation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, yeah, there you go, right?</p>
<p>So SPARC gave-</p>
<p>A lifeline, yeah.</p>
<p>A lifeline, gave fuel to the future center at MIT</p>
<p>that it continues.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s way more than that.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just about like surviving</p>
<p>for the sake of surviving, it was like,</p>
<p>in the end for me, it became like this,</p>
<p>I remember the moment, you talk about these moments</p>
<p>as a scientist, and we were just like,</p>
<p>we were working so hard about figuring out,</p>
<p>like, does this really, will this really work?</p>
<p>Like, and it&rsquo;s complex.</p>
<p>Like, does the magnet work?</p>
<p>Does the interaction with the plasma work?</p>
<p>Does all these things work?</p>
<p>And it was just a grind, push, push, push, push.</p>
<p>And I remember the moment,</p>
<p>because I was sitting in my office in Brookline,</p>
<p>and there was just like, I read like,</p>
<p>and I was in, I don&rsquo;t know, whatever,</p>
<p>the 20th or 40th slide or something into it.</p>
<p>And it was sort of that moment,</p>
<p>like it just came together.</p>
<p>And I like, I got, I couldn&rsquo;t even sit down,</p>
<p>because all it was just like, my wife was like,</p>
<p>why are you walking around the apartment like this?</p>
<p>Like, I just couldn&rsquo;t, I said, it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>
<p>Like, holy, that moment of realization is like,</p>
<p>kind of amazing, but it also brings the responsibility</p>
<p>of making it work as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, how do you make it work?</p>
<p>So you mean like that magic realization</p>
<p>that you can have this modern magnet technology,</p>
<p>and you can actually, like, why do we need to work</p>
<p>with ITER, we can do it here?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting that ITER is,</p>
<p>that one of the reasons that, like,</p>
<p>we started with a group of six of us at MIT,</p>
<p>and then once we got some funding</p>
<p>through the establishment of the company,</p>
<p>it became a slightly larger.</p>
<p>But in the end, we had a rather small team.</p>
<p>Like, this was like a team of,</p>
<p>order of like 20 to 25 people designed Spark</p>
<p>in like about two years, right?</p>
<p>How does that happen?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re clever, but you have to give ITER</p>
<p>its due here as well, too.</p>
<p>Again, this is an aspect always of the bootstrap up.</p>
<p>Like, I go back to the Human Genome Project.</p>
<p>So modern day genomics would not be possible</p>
<p>without the underlying basis that came</p>
<p>from setting that up.</p>
<p>It had to be there.</p>
<p>It had to be curiosity-driven public program.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with ITER, but because we had the tools</p>
<p>that were there to understand ITER,</p>
<p>we also had the tools to understand Spark.</p>
<p>So we parlayed those in an extremely powerful way</p>
<p>to be able to tell us about what was going to happen.</p>
<p>So these things are never simple, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people look at this, go,</p>
<p>oh, this means we should, like,</p>
<p>should we really have a public-based program about fusion,</p>
<p>or should we have it all in the private?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, the answer is neither way,</p>
<p>because in all these complex technologies,</p>
<p>you have to keep pushing on all the fronts</p>
<p>to actually get it there.</p>
<p>So, you know, the natural question when people hear</p>
<p>breakthrough with the inertial confinement,</p>
<p>with the magnetic confinement is,</p>
<p>so when will we have commercial reactors, power plants</p>
<p>that are actually producing electricity?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense, looking out into the future,</p>
<p>when do you think you can envision a future</p>
<p>where we have actual electricity coming from nuclear fusion?</p>
<p>Partly driven by us, but in other places as well, too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the advent, what&rsquo;s so different now</p>
<p>than three or four years ago.</p>
<p>Like, we launched around four years ago.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so different now is the advent of a very nascent,</p>
<p>but seemingly robust, commercial fusion endeavor.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just Commonwealth Fusion Systems,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something like 20-plus companies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sector now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sector.</p>
<p>They actually have something called</p>
<p>the Fusion Industry Association,</p>
<p>which if your viewers want to go see this,</p>
<p>this describes the different,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got this plethora of approaches.</p>
<p>Like, I haven&rsquo;t even described all the approaches,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve basically described the mainline approaches.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all at varying degrees of technical</p>
<p>and scientific maturity with very huge,</p>
<p>different balances between them.</p>
<p>What they share is that because they&rsquo;re going out</p>
<p>and getting funding from the private sector</p>
<p>is that their stated goals are about getting fusion</p>
<p>into place so that both it meets the investors&rsquo; demands,</p>
<p>which are interesting, right, and the timescales of that,</p>
<p>but also it&rsquo;s like, well, there&rsquo;s gonna, and why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this enormous push, driver,</p>
<p>about getting carbon-free energy sources</p>
<p>out into the market.</p>
<p>And whoever figures those out is going to be both very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be very important geopolitically,</p>
<p>but also economically as well too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different kind of bet, I guess,</p>
<p>or a different kind of gamble that you&rsquo;re taking with fusion</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so disruptive that it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s essentially a class of investors and teams</p>
<p>that are ready to go after it as well too.</p>
<p>So what do they share in this?</p>
<p>They typically share getting after fusion on a timescale</p>
<p>so that could it have any relevance</p>
<p>towards climate change, battling climate change.</p>
<p>And I would say this is difficult,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fairly easy because it&rsquo;s math.</p>
<p>So what you do is you actually go to some target</p>
<p>like 2050 or 2060, something like this,</p>
<p>and say, I wanna be blank percent</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s market of electricity</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And we know historically what it takes to evolve</p>
<p>and distribute these kinds of technologies</p>
<p>is every technology takes some period of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so-called S-curve, it&rsquo;s basically,</p>
<p>everything follows a logarithmic curve,</p>
<p>exponential type curve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a straight line, a log plot.</p>
<p>And like you look at wind, solar, fission,</p>
<p>they all follow the same thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy, you take that curve and you go,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s slope and you work backwards and you go,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t start in the early 2030s,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not gonna have a significant impact</p>
<p>by that time.</p>
<p>So all of them share this idea.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s not just the companies now,</p>
<p>the US federal government has a program</p>
<p>that was started last year that said,</p>
<p>we should be looking to try to get like the first,</p>
<p>and what do I mean by like, what does it mean to start?</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;ve got something that&rsquo;s putting electricity</p>
<p>on the grid, a pilot, what we call it.</p>
<p>And if that can get started like in the early 2030s,</p>
<p>the idea of ramping it up makes sense, it&rsquo;s math, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the ambition, then the question is,</p>
<p>and actually this is different</p>
<p>because the government program,</p>
<p>and they vary around in this.</p>
<p>So for example, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s government idea</p>
<p>was to get the first one on by 2040.</p>
<p>And China has ambitions probably middle 2030s</p>
<p>or maybe a little bit later.</p>
<p>And Europe, continental Europe is a little bit,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure where it is, but it&rsquo;s like later,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 2050 or 2060,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s mostly linked to the Eater timeline</p>
<p>as well too.</p>
<p>The fusion companies, which makes sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, of course,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got the most aggressive timelines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re gonna map the human genome faster</p>
<p>as well too, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting about where we are.</p>
<p>And I think, we&rsquo;re not all the way there,</p>
<p>but my intuition tells me we&rsquo;re probably gonna have</p>
<p>a couple of cracks at it actually on that timeline.</p>
<p>So this is where we have to be careful though,</p>
<p>you say commercial fusion, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Commercial fusion to me means that you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>have a known quantity about what it costs,</p>
<p>what it costs to build and what it costs to operate,</p>
<p>the reliability of putting energy on the grid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s commercial fusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, so it turns out that that&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>exactly the first fusion devices</p>
<p>that put electricity on the grid.</p>
<p>Cause you got it, there&rsquo;s a learning curve</p>
<p>to get like better and better at it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s probably, I would suspect the biggest hurdle</p>
<p>is to get to the first one.</p>
<p>The work I&rsquo;ve done, the work I continue to do</p>
<p>with autonomous vehicles and semi-autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting parallel there</p>
<p>where a bunch of companies announced a deadline</p>
<p>for themselves in 2020, 2021, 22.</p>
<p>And only a small subset of those companies</p>
<p>have actually really pushed that forward.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Google with Waymo or Alphabet rather.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s Tesla with semi-autonomous driving</p>
<p>in their autopilot, full self-driving mode.</p>
<p>And those are different approaches.</p>
<p>So Tesla is achieving much, much higher scale,</p>
<p>but the sort of the quality of the drive</p>
<p>is semi-autonomous, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a metaphor, an analogy here.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s Waymo that&rsquo;s focusing</p>
<p>on very specific cities, but achieving real full autonomy</p>
<p>with actual passengers, but the scale is much smaller.</p>
<p>So I wonder, like, just like you said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be these kinds of similar</p>
<p>kind of really hard pushes.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So actually, this is why I&rsquo;m encouraged about Fusion.</p>
<p>So Fusion&rsquo;s still hard, let&rsquo;s let everyone be clear,</p>
<p>because of the science underneath it</p>
<p>of achieving the right conditions for the plasma</p>
<p>basically is a yardstick that you have to put up</p>
<p>against all of them.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s encouraging that I see in this,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually what happens</p>
<p>when you sort of let loose the creativity of this</p>
<p>is maybe I&rsquo;ll go back to first principles.</p>
<p>So Fusion is also a fairly strange,</p>
<p>so if you think about building a coal plant,</p>
<p>like burning wood and coal and gas</p>
<p>is actually not that much different from each other,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re kind of about the same physical conditions</p>
<p>and you get the fuel and you light it.</p>
<p>Fusion is very, remember I told you</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this condition of the temperature,</p>
<p>which is kind of universal.</p>
<p>But if you take the density of the fuel</p>
<p>between magnetic fusion and inertial fusion,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re different by about a factor of 10 billion.</p>
<p>So this, and the density of fuel really matters,</p>
<p>and actually so does the,</p>
<p>and this means energy confinement time</p>
<p>is also different by a factor of 10 billion as well too,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the product of those two.</p>
<p>So one&rsquo;s really dense and short-lived,</p>
<p>and the other one&rsquo;s really long-lived</p>
<p>and actually under-dense as well too.</p>
<p>So what that means is that the way to get</p>
<p>the underlying physical state is so different</p>
<p>among these different approaches,</p>
<p>what it lends itself to is,</p>
<p>does this mean that eventual commercial products</p>
<p>will actually fill different needs in the energy system?</p>
<p>So it sort of goes to your comment about,</p>
<p>I have to suspect this, because anything that is high-tech</p>
<p>and is like a really important thing in our economy</p>
<p>tends to never find its way as one, only one manifestation.</p>
<p>Like look at transportation as well too.</p>
<p>We have scooters, Vespas, overland trucks, cars,</p>
<p>electric cars, of course we have these</p>
<p>because they meet different demands in it.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting that I find fascinating now</p>
<p>is that we have, in fusion it&rsquo;s going to look like that,</p>
<p>that probably there&rsquo;s, while the near-term focus</p>
<p>is on electricity production,</p>
<p>there might even be different kinds of markets</p>
<p>that actually make sense in some places less than others.</p>
<p>It comes to trade-offs,</p>
<p>because we haven&rsquo;t really talked about the engineering yet</p>
<p>but engineering really matters,</p>
<p>like to the operation of the device.</p>
<p>And so it could be that, I suspect what we&rsquo;ll end up with</p>
<p>is several different configurations</p>
<p>which have different features,</p>
<p>which are trade-offs basically in the energy market.</p>
<p>What do you see as the major engineering</p>
<p>or general hurdles that are in the way?</p>
<p>So the first one is just the cost of building a single unit.</p>
<p>So fusion has, and it&rsquo;s actually interesting,</p>
<p>you talked about the different models that you have.</p>
<p>So fusion has, one of its interesting limitations</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s very hard,</p>
<p>it almost at some point becomes physically impossible</p>
<p>to actually make small power units,</p>
<p>like a kilowatt, 1,000 watts,</p>
<p>which is like a personal home,</p>
<p>like this is about 1,000 watts,</p>
<p>or your personal use of electricity</p>
<p>is about like 1,000 watts.</p>
<p>This is basically impossible for a single unit to do this.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re not gonna have a fusion power plant</p>
<p>like as your furnace or your electric heater in your home.</p>
<p>And the reason for this comes from the fact</p>
<p>that fusion relies on it being,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just that it&rsquo;s very hot,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that the fusion power</p>
<p>is the heating source to keep it hot.</p>
<p>So if you go too small,</p>
<p>it basically just cannot keep it hot.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting is that this,</p>
<p>so this is one of the hard parts.</p>
<p>So this means that the individual units,</p>
<p>it varies from concept to concept,</p>
<p>but the National Academy&rsquo;s report that came out last year</p>
<p>sort of put the benchmark as being</p>
<p>like probably the minimum size</p>
<p>looks like around 50 million watts of electricity,</p>
<p>which is like enough for like a small to mid-sized city,</p>
<p>actually.</p>
<p>So that is, so that&rsquo;s sort of like a scale challenge.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why</p>
<p>in Commonwealth and in other private sector ones,</p>
<p>like they try to push this down actually</p>
<p>of trying to get to these smaller units</p>
<p>just because it reduces the cost of it.</p>
<p>Then probably, obviously, I would say it&rsquo;s an obvious one,</p>
<p>like achieving the fusion state itself</p>
<p>and high gain is a hard one,</p>
<p>what we already talked about.</p>
<p>What kind of hurdle, what kind of challenge is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s achieving the right temperature, density,</p>
<p>and energy confinement time in the fuel itself,</p>
<p>in the plasma itself.</p>
<p>And so some of the configurations</p>
<p>which are being chosen are actually,</p>
<p>have quite a ways to go, in fact, of seeing those.</p>
<p>But what their consideration is,</p>
<p>oh, yes, but by our particular configuration,</p>
<p>the engineering simplicity confers</p>
<p>like an economic advantage, even if we&rsquo;re behind</p>
<p>in sort of a science sense.</p>
<p>Okay, which is fine, that&rsquo;s also what you get</p>
<p>when you get an explosion in the private sector,</p>
<p>you basically are distributing risks in different ways,</p>
<p>right, which makes sense.</p>
<p>All of that good, so what I would say</p>
<p>is that the next hurdle to really overcome</p>
<p>is about making that electricity.</p>
<p>So like we need to see a unit or several units,</p>
<p>like put using fusion in some way</p>
<p>to put a meaningful amount of energy on the grid,</p>
<p>because this starts giving us real answers</p>
<p>as to like what this is going to look like.</p>
<p>The full end-to-end process.</p>
<p>The full end-to-end thing.</p>
<p>So Commonwealth&rsquo;s goal is that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just comment to Commonwealth</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll take some, you know,</p>
<p>I guess some credit for this,</p>
<p>is that the origins of Commonwealth</p>
<p>were in fact in examining that.</p>
<p>Like we could see this new technology coming forward,</p>
<p>this new superconducting material,</p>
<p>and the origins of our thought process</p>
<p>were really around designing, effectively,</p>
<p>the pilot plant or the commercial unit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called ARC, which is actually</p>
<p>the step forward after SPARC.</p>
<p>And that was the origins of it.</p>
<p>So all the things that were other parts of the plan,</p>
<p>like SPARC and the magnet,</p>
<p>were actually all informed totally by building</p>
<p>something that was going to put net electricity on the grid.</p>
<p>And the timing of that, we still hope,</p>
<p>is actually the early 2030s.</p>
<p>So SPARC is the design of the Takamak</p>
<p>and ARC is the actual full end-to-end thing.</p>
<p>Is like a thing that actually puts that energy</p>
<p>on the grid.</p>
<p>So SPARC is named, you know, intentionally,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s on for a short period of time</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have a, it has, yeah, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the spark of the fusion, you know,</p>
<p>revolution or something like that,</p>
<p>I guess we could call it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so those are sort of the programmatic</p>
<p>challenges of doing that.</p>
<p>And, you know, you asked about,</p>
<p>you talked about SpaceX.</p>
<p>So what has evolved even in the last year or so</p>
<p>was, in fact, in March of 2022,</p>
<p>the White House announced that it was going to start</p>
<p>a program that kind of looks like a SpaceX analogy,</p>
<p>that namely, wow, we&rsquo;ve got these things</p>
<p>in the private sector.</p>
<p>We should leverage the private sector</p>
<p>and the advantages of what they obtain,</p>
<p>but also with the things, like this is going to be hard</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to take quite a bit of financing.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we set up a program where we don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>get in the way of the private sector fusion companies,</p>
<p>but we help them finance these difficult things,</p>
<p>which is how SpaceX basically became successful</p>
<p>through the COTS program, fantastic, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s evolving as well too.</p>
<p>So like the fusion ecosystem is almost unrecognizable</p>
<p>from where it was like five years ago</p>
<p>around those things.</p>
<p>How important is it for the heads of the companies</p>
<p>that are working on nuclear fusion to have a Twitter account</p>
<p>and to be quite, you said you don&rsquo;t use Twitter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use Twitter.</p>
<p>Very much.</p>
<p>I mean, there is some element to,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think this should be discounted,</p>
<p>whatever you think about figures like Jeff Bezos</p>
<p>with Blue Origin or Elon Musk with SpaceX.</p>
<p>There is a science communication, to put it in nice terms,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of required to really educate the public</p>
<p>and get everybody excited and sell the sexiness of it.</p>
<p>I mean, just even the videos of SpaceX,</p>
<p>just being able to kind of get everybody excited</p>
<p>about going out to space once again.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all kinds of different ways of doing that,</p>
<p>but I guess that&rsquo;s what companies do well,</p>
<p>is to advertise themselves, to really sell themselves.</p>
<p>It is, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I feel like one of the reasons</p>
<p>on this podcast, and so I don&rsquo;t have an official role</p>
<p>in the company.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons for this was also that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting, because when you come from,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re running a company, it makes sense.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re promoting their own product and their own vision,</p>
<p>which totally makes sense.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a very important role for academics</p>
<p>who have knowledge about what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but are sufficiently distant from it</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not fully only self-motivated</p>
<p>just by their own projects or so forth.</p>
<p>And for me, this is, I mean, we see particularly</p>
<p>the problems of the distrust in technology,</p>
<p>and then honestly in the scientific community as well too.</p>
<p>It will be one of the greatest tragedies, I would say,</p>
<p>that if we go through all of this and almost pull off</p>
<p>what looks like a miracle, like technologic</p>
<p>and scientific-wise, which is to make a fusion power plant,</p>
<p>and then nobody wants to use it because they feel</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t trust the people who are doing it</p>
<p>or the technology.</p>
<p>So we have to get so far out ahead of this.</p>
<p>So I give lots of public lectures or things like this</p>
<p>of accessing a larger range of people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not trying to hide anything.</p>
<p>You can come and see, come do tours of our laboratory.</p>
<p>In fact, I want to set those up virtually as well too.</p>
<p>You might look at our Plasma Science and Fusion Center</p>
<p>YouTube channel.</p>
<p>So we are reaching out through those media,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really important that we do those things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, but also then realizing,</p>
<p>setting up the realistic expectations</p>
<p>of what we need to do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have commercial fusion devices yet.</p>
<p>And you asked, like, what are the challenges?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get into any deep technical questions</p>
<p>about what the challenges are, but it is,</p>
<p>the pathway, not just to make fusion work technically,</p>
<p>but to make it economically competitive and viable</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s actually used out in the private sector</p>
<p>is a non-trivial task.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because of the newness of it.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re simultaneously trying to evolve the technology</p>
<p>and make it economically viable at the same time.</p>
<p>Those are two difficult coupled tasks.</p>
<p>So my own research and my own drive right now</p>
<p>is that fantastic Commonwealth Fusion Systems is set up.</p>
<p>We have a commercialization unit of that particular kind,</p>
<p>which is going to drive forward a token back.</p>
<p>In fact, I was just, there&rsquo;s discussions,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s dialogues going on around the world</p>
<p>with other kinds of ones, like stellarators,</p>
<p>which prefer different kinds of challenges</p>
<p>and economic advantages.</p>
<p>But what we have to, I know what we have to have.</p>
<p>What we have to have is a new generation</p>
<p>of integrated scientists, technologists, and engineers</p>
<p>that understand, like, how, what needs to get done</p>
<p>to get all the way to the goal line.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t have them now.</p>
<p>So like a multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s required, I mean, you&rsquo;ve spoken about,</p>
<p>you said that fusion is, quote,</p>
<p>the most multidisciplinary field you can imagine.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>What are the differences?</p>
<p>Well, because most of our discussion that we&rsquo;ve had so far</p>
<p>is really like a physics discussion, really.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t neglect physics is at the origin of this.</p>
<p>But already we touched on plasma physics</p>
<p>and nuclear physics, which are basically two,</p>
<p>somewhat overlap, but independent disciplines.</p>
<p>Then when it comes to the engineering,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost everything.</p>
<p>So why is this?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s build an electromagnet together, okay?</p>
<p>What is this gonna take?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take, it&rsquo;s basically electrical engineering,</p>
<p>computer, so you understand how it goes together,</p>
<p>what happens.</p>
<p>Computational engineering to model</p>
<p>this very complex integrated thing.</p>
<p>Materials engineering, because you&rsquo;re pushing materials</p>
<p>to their limit with respect to stress and so forth.</p>
<p>It takes cryogenic engineering,</p>
<p>which is sort of a subdiscipline,</p>
<p>but cooling things to extremely low temperatures.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably some kind of chemistry thing in there too.</p>
<p>Well, actually, yeah,</p>
<p>which tends to show up in the materials.</p>
<p>Then that&rsquo;s just one of the sub components of it.</p>
<p>Like almost everything gets hit in this, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, and you&rsquo;re also in a very integrated environment</p>
<p>because in the end, all of these things,</p>
<p>while you isolate them from each other in a physics sense,</p>
<p>in an engineering sense,</p>
<p>they all have to work like seamlessly together.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of those, I mean, in my own career,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve basically done atomic physics, spectroscopy,</p>
<p>plasma physics, ion etching.</p>
<p>So this includes material science,</p>
<p>something called MHD, even magnetohydrodynamics.</p>
<p>And now all the way through, like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure how many different careers I&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, by the way, this is also a recruiting stage</p>
<p>for like young scientists thinking to come in.</p>
<p>My comment to scientists, if you&rsquo;re bored in fusion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not paying attention</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always something interesting to go and do.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really important part of what we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t new in fusion, actually,</p>
<p>and in fact is in the roots of what we&rsquo;ve done at MIT.</p>
<p>But holy cow, like the proximity of possibility</p>
<p>of commercial fusion is the new thing.</p>
<p>So my catchphrase is like,</p>
<p>you may be wondering like,</p>
<p>why weren&rsquo;t we doing all these things?</p>
<p>Why weren&rsquo;t we pushing towards economic fusion</p>
<p>and new materials and new methods of heat extraction</p>
<p>and so forth?</p>
<p>Because everybody knew fusion was 40 years away,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s four years away.</p>
<p>There is a history, like you said, 40, 30, whatever,</p>
<p>that kind of old joke.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a history of fusion projects</p>
<p>that are characterized by cost overruns and delays.</p>
<p>How do you avoid this?</p>
<p>How do you minimize the chance of this?</p>
<p>You have to build great teams is one of them.</p>
<p>It tends to be that the smaller the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of an, I&rsquo;m not an expert in this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen this enough integrated engineering teams.</p>
<p>Is there any equations?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, there&rsquo;s almost,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this from enough teams.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve seen also the futility of lone geniuses</p>
<p>trying to solve everything by themselves, like no.</p>
<p>But also organizations that have 10,000 people in them</p>
<p>is just not, doesn&rsquo;t lend itself at all to innovation.</p>
<p>Like one of our original sponsors and a good friend,</p>
<p>Vinod Khosla, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever talked</p>
<p>to Vinod Khosla, he&rsquo;s a venture guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got fantastic ideas about the right sizes of teams</p>
<p>and things that really innovate, right?</p>
<p>And there is an optimum place in there</p>
<p>is that you get enough cross-discipline and ideas,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t become so overly bureaucratic</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t execute on it.</p>
<p>So one of the ways,</p>
<p>and this was one of the challenges of fusion</p>
<p>is that everything was leading towards,</p>
<p>like I have to have enormously large teams</p>
<p>just to execute because of the scale of the project.</p>
<p>The fact that now through both technology</p>
<p>and I would argue financing innovation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re driving to the point where it&rsquo;s smaller focused teams</p>
<p>about doing those things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way to make it faster.</p>
<p>The other way to make it faster is modularize the problem</p>
<p>or parse the problem.</p>
<p>So this is the other difficulty in fusion</p>
<p>is that you tend to look at this as like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s really just about making the plasma</p>
<p>into this state here that you get this energy gain.</p>
<p>No, because in the end,</p>
<p>if you can parse out the different problems of making that</p>
<p>and then make it as separate as possible</p>
<p>from extracting the energy</p>
<p>and then converting it into electricity,</p>
<p>the more separate those are,</p>
<p>the better they are because you get parallel paths</p>
<p>that basically mitigate risk.</p>
<p>This is not new in fusion, by the way,</p>
<p>and this is the way that we attack</p>
<p>most complex technological,</p>
<p>integrated technological challenges.</p>
<p>Have you by any chance seen some of the application</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence reinforcement learning?</p>
<p>A DeepMind has a nice paper,</p>
<p>has a nice effort on basically using reinforcement learning</p>
<p>for a learned control algorithm</p>
<p>for controlling nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>Do you find those kinds of,</p>
<p>I guess you throw them under the umbrella</p>
<p>of computational modeling.</p>
<p>Do you find those interesting, promising directions?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all interesting.</p>
<p>So when people, I&rsquo;ll pull back,</p>
<p>maybe a natural question is like,</p>
<p>why is it different in fusion?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a long history to fusion, right?</p>
<p>It was going on for, like I told you,</p>
<p>like stories from the late 1960s,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s different now, right?</p>
<p>So I think from the technology point of view,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two massive things which are different.</p>
<p>So one of them, I&rsquo;ll be parochial,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the advent of this new superconducting materials</p>
<p>because the most mature ways that we understand</p>
<p>about how we&rsquo;re gonna get to fusion power plants</p>
<p>are magnetic fusion.</p>
<p>And by the fact that you&rsquo;ve got access</p>
<p>to something which like changes the economic equation</p>
<p>by an over an order of magnitude is just a totally,</p>
<p>you know, and that wasn&rsquo;t that long ago.</p>
<p>It was only September of 2021</p>
<p>that we actually demonstrated the technology.</p>
<p>That changes the prospects there.</p>
<p>And the other one is computing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s across the whole spectrum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just in control of the fusion device.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually in the,</p>
<p>we actually use machine learning and things like this</p>
<p>in the design of the magnet itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly complex design space.</p>
<p>So you use those tools.</p>
<p>The simulation of the plasma itself is actually,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at a totally different place than we were</p>
<p>because of those things.</p>
<p>So those are the two big drivers that I see actually</p>
<p>that make it different.</p>
<p>And actually, and it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>both those things self-enforce</p>
<p>about what you asked about before,</p>
<p>like how do you avoid delays and things?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s by having smaller teams</p>
<p>that can actually execute on those.</p>
<p>But now you can do this</p>
<p>because the new magnets make the devices all smaller.</p>
<p>And the computing means your human effectiveness</p>
<p>about exploring the optimization space is way better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re all interlinked to each other.</p>
<p>Plus the modularization, like you said,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s everything just kind of works together</p>
<p>to make smaller teams more effective, move faster.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s through that learned experience.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, of the things that I&rsquo;m the most proud of</p>
<p>about what came out.</p>
<p>In fact, the origins of thinking</p>
<p>about how we would use</p>
<p>the high-temperature superconducting magnets</p>
<p>came out of my design class at MIT.</p>
<p>And in the design class,</p>
<p>like one of the features that I kept,</p>
<p>I mean, it was interesting.</p>
<p>I actually learned,</p>
<p>I really learned along with the students about this,</p>
<p>but like this insistence on the features,</p>
<p>like we can&rsquo;t have so many coupled,</p>
<p>integrated, hard technology developments.</p>
<p>Like we have to separate these somehow.</p>
<p>So we worked and worked and worked at this.</p>
<p>And in fact, that&rsquo;s what really, in my opinion,</p>
<p>the greatest advantage of the arc design</p>
<p>and built into the Commonwealth Fusion System idea</p>
<p>is like to parse out the problems.</p>
<p>Like how can we attack these in parallel?</p>
<p>Yeah, and so it really comes to,</p>
<p>we talked about philosophy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a design philosophy.</p>
<p>Like how do you attack these kinds of problems?</p>
<p>And you do it like that.</p>
<p>And also, like you mentioned offline,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a power to,</p>
<p>you know, as part of a class,</p>
<p>to design a nuclear fusion power plant.</p>
<p>And then make it a reality.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a more powerful force</p>
<p>than like 15 MIT PhD students,</p>
<p>like working together towards solving a problem.</p>
<p>And what I always, in fact,</p>
<p>we recently just taught the most recent,</p>
<p>you know, I say I teach it.</p>
<p>I mean, I guide it, actually.</p>
<p>The most recent version of this,</p>
<p>where they actually designed, you know,</p>
<p>based on this National Academies report,</p>
<p>they actually designed like a pilot plant</p>
<p>that has basis and similarities to what we had done before.</p>
<p>But, you know, I kept wanting to like push the envelope</p>
<p>in where they are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the creativity and the energy</p>
<p>that they bring to these things is kind of like,</p>
<p>it keeps me going.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I&rsquo;m not gonna retire anytime soon.</p>
<p>When I keep seeing that kind of dedication</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s wonderful around on that.</p>
<p>It almost, not to overuse a,</p>
<p>or to paraphrase something, right,</p>
<p>which is that, you know, the famous quote by Margaret Mead,</p>
<p>you know, never doubt that a small group</p>
<p>of dedicated, you know, persons will change the world.</p>
<p>Indeed, it&rsquo;s the only thing that ever has.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just such a powerful</p>
<p>and inspiring thing for an individual.</p>
<p>Find the right team, be part of that.</p>
<p>And then you, yourself, your passion,</p>
<p>your efforts could actually make a big change.</p>
<p>Big impact.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you, so it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a whole nother different conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, to have.</p>
<p>But nuclear power as it currently stands,</p>
<p>so using fission is extremely safe,</p>
<p>despite public perception.</p>
<p>It is the safest, actually.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a whole nother conversation.</p>
<p>But almost like a human, bureaucratic,</p>
<p>physics, engineering question of what lessons</p>
<p>do you draw from the catastrophic events</p>
<p>where the power plants did fail?</p>
<p>So Chernobyl and Three Mile Island.</p>
<p>Chernobyl, what lessons do you draw?</p>
<p>Actually, Three Mile Island wasn&rsquo;t really a disaster</p>
<p>because nothing escaped from the thing,</p>
<p>but Chernobyl and Fukushima were,</p>
<p>have been, you know, had obvious consequences</p>
<p>in the populations that live nearby.</p>
<p>What lesson do you draw from those</p>
<p>that you can carry forward to fusion?</p>
<p>Now, I know there&rsquo;s, you can say that you&rsquo;re not gonna have</p>
<p>the same kind of issues, but it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that the same folks also said they&rsquo;re not gonna be,</p>
<p>have those same kind of issues.</p>
<p>We humans, the human factor.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked about that one quite as much,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>So to be clear, it&rsquo;s, so fusion has intrinsic safety</p>
<p>with respect to it can&rsquo;t run away.</p>
<p>Those are physics basis.</p>
<p>Technology and engineering basis of running a complex,</p>
<p>again, anything that makes large amounts of power</p>
<p>and heats things up has got intrinsic safety in it.</p>
<p>And by the fact that we actually produce</p>
<p>very energetic particles, this doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no radiation involved in ionizing radiation</p>
<p>to be more accurate.</p>
<p>In fusion, it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s in a very different</p>
<p>order of magnitude, basically.</p>
<p>So what are the lessons in fusion?</p>
<p>So one of them is make sure that you&rsquo;re looking at aspects</p>
<p>of the holistic environmental and societal footprint</p>
<p>that the technology will have.</p>
<p>As technologists, we tend not to focus on these,</p>
<p>particularly in early stages of development.</p>
<p>Like we just want something that works, right?</p>
<p>But if we come with just something that works,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t actually satisfy the societal demands</p>
<p>for safety and for, I mean, we will have materials</p>
<p>that we have to dispose of out of fusion.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s technological questions</p>
<p>about what that looks like.</p>
<p>So will this look like something that you have to put</p>
<p>in the ground for a hundred years or five years?</p>
<p>And the consequences of those are both economic</p>
<p>and societal acceptance and so forth,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t bury those.</p>
<p>Like bring these up front, talk to people about them</p>
<p>and make people realize that you&rsquo;re actually,</p>
<p>the way I would look at it is that you&rsquo;re making fusion</p>
<p>more economically attractive by making it</p>
<p>more societally acceptable as well too.</p>
<p>And then realize is that, you know,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a few interesting boundaries, basically.</p>
<p>So one of them, speaking of boundaries,</p>
<p>that successful fusion devices, I&rsquo;m pretty sure</p>
<p>will require that you don&rsquo;t have to have an evacuation plan</p>
<p>for anybody who lives at the site boundary.</p>
<p>So this has implications for what we build</p>
<p>from a fusion engineering point of view,</p>
<p>but has major implications for where you can site</p>
<p>fusion devices, right?</p>
<p>So in many ways, it becomes more like, well, you know,</p>
<p>we have fences around, you know, industrial heat sources</p>
<p>and things like this for a reason, right?</p>
<p>For personal safety.</p>
<p>It looks more like that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite as simple as that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what it should look like.</p>
<p>And in fact, we have research projects going on right now</p>
<p>at MIT that are like trying to push the technologies</p>
<p>to make it more look like that.</p>
<p>I think that those are key.</p>
<p>And then in the end, as I said, like,</p>
<p>so Chernobyl is physically impossible,</p>
<p>actually, in a fusion system.</p>
<p>From a physics perspective.</p>
<p>From a physics perspective, you can&rsquo;t run away</p>
<p>like it did at Chernobyl, which was basically human error</p>
<p>that, you know, of letting the reactors,</p>
<p>like, run out of control, essentially.</p>
<p>Human error can still happen with fusion-based reactors.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, but in that one, if human error occurs,</p>
<p>then it just stops and this is done.</p>
<p>And all of those things, this is the requirement</p>
<p>of us as technologists and developers of this technology</p>
<p>to not ignore that dimension, in fact, of the design.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why me personally, I&rsquo;m actually pouring myself</p>
<p>more and more into that area because this is going to be,</p>
<p>I actually really think it is an aspect</p>
<p>of the economic viability of fusion</p>
<p>because it clearly differentiates ourselves</p>
<p>and also sets us up to be about what we want fusion to be</p>
<p>is that, again, on paper, fusion can supply</p>
<p>all of our energy, like all of it.</p>
<p>So this means I want it to be like,</p>
<p>like really environmentally benign.</p>
<p>But this takes engineering ingenuity, basically, to do that.</p>
<p>Let me ask you some wild out there questions.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So for-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking too much, you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very-</p>
<p>Simple, practical things in everyday life.</p>
<p>No, only revolutionizing the entire energy infrastructure</p>
<p>of human civilization, yes.</p>
<p>But, so cold fusion, this idea, this dream,</p>
<p>this interesting physical goals seem to be impossible,</p>
<p>but perhaps it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Do you think it is possible?</p>
<p>Do you think down the line, somewhere in the far distance</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to achieve fusion at low temperature?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very, very unlikely.</p>
<p>And this comes from, so this would require</p>
<p>a pretty fundamental shift in our understanding</p>
<p>of physics, as we know it now.</p>
<p>And we know a heck of a lot</p>
<p>about how nuclear reactions occur.</p>
<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s interesting is that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>they actually have a different name for it.</p>
<p>They call it leaner, like low energy nuclear reactions.</p>
<p>But we do have low energy nuclear reactions.</p>
<p>We know these, it&rsquo;s because these come from,</p>
<p>particularly the weak interaction,</p>
<p>the weak force, nuclear force.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s at this point, as a scientist,</p>
<p>you always keep yourself open,</p>
<p>but you also demand proof, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It almost requires a breakthrough</p>
<p>on the theoretical physics side.</p>
<p>So, some deeper understanding about quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>so the quantum tunneling, some weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, and people have looked at that,</p>
<p>but even something like quantum tunneling</p>
<p>has a limit as to what it can actually do.</p>
<p>So, there are people who are genuine,</p>
<p>that really want to see it make,</p>
<p>but it sort of goes to the extort,</p>
<p>I mean, we know fusion happens at these high energies.</p>
<p>Like, we know this extremely accurately,</p>
<p>and I can show you a plot that shows that</p>
<p>as you go to lower and lower energy,</p>
<p>it basically becomes immeasurable.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re going down this other pathway,</p>
<p>it means there&rsquo;s really a very different</p>
<p>physical mechanism involved.</p>
<p>So, all I would say is that I actually poke in my head</p>
<p>once in a while to see what&rsquo;s going on in that area.</p>
<p>And as scientists, we should always</p>
<p>try to make ourselves open.</p>
<p>But in this one, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>but show me something that I can measure</p>
<p>and that is repeatable,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s gonna take more extraordinary effort.</p>
<p>And to date, this has not met that threshold,</p>
<p>in my opinion.</p>
<p>So, even more so than just mentioning,</p>
<p>or in that question, thinking about people</p>
<p>that are claiming to have achieved cold fusion,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more thinking even about people</p>
<p>who are studying black holes,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re basically trying to understand</p>
<p>the function of theoretical physicists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing the long haul,</p>
<p>trying to investigate, like,</p>
<p>okay, what is happening at the singularity?</p>
<p>What is this kind of holographic projections on a plate,</p>
<p>these weird freaking things</p>
<p>that are out there in the universe,</p>
<p>and somehow, accidentally,</p>
<p>they start to figure out something weird.</p>
<p>And then, all of a sudden.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s weirdness all over the place already, yeah.</p>
<p>Somehow, that weirdness will,</p>
<p>I think on a timescale probably of 100 years or so,</p>
<p>that weirdness will open.</p>
<p>It just seems like nuclear fusion</p>
<p>and black holes and all of this are too,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re next-door neighbors a little bit too much</p>
<p>for you&rsquo;ll find something interesting.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you a story about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real story, yeah.</p>
<p>So, there were really, really clever scientists</p>
<p>in the end of the late 1800s in the world.</p>
<p>You talk about, like, James Clerk Maxwell,</p>
<p>and you talk about Lord Kelvin,</p>
<p>and you talk about Lorentz, actually,</p>
<p>who named after these other ones,</p>
<p>and on and on and on, and like Faraday,</p>
<p>and they discovered electromagnetism, holy cow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, they figure out all these things,</p>
<p>and yet, there were these weird things going on</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what the heck is going on with this, right?</p>
<p>But we teach this all the time in physics classes, right?</p>
<p>So, what was going on?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s just a few kind of things unchecked,</p>
<p>but basically, we&rsquo;re at the end of discovery</p>
<p>because we figured out how everything works</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve got basically Newtonian mechanics</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got Maxwell&rsquo;s equations,</p>
<p>which describe basically how matter gets pushed around</p>
<p>and how electromagnetism works.</p>
<p>Holy cow, what a feat.</p>
<p>But there are these few nagging things.</p>
<p>Like, for instance, there&rsquo;s certain kinds of rocks</p>
<p>that for some reason,</p>
<p>like if you put a photographic plate around it,</p>
<p>it gets burned or it gets an image on it.</p>
<p>Like, well, where&rsquo;s the electromagnetism in that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no electromagnetic properties of this rock.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and the other thing, too,</p>
<p>is that if I take this wonderful classical derivation</p>
<p>of something that is hot, about how it releases radiation,</p>
<p>everything looks fantastic.</p>
<p>Perfect match, oh, until I get to high frequencies</p>
<p>of the light, and then it basically just,</p>
<p>the whole thing falls apart.</p>
<p>In fact, it gives a physical explanation,</p>
<p>which is total nonsense.</p>
<p>It tells you that every object should basically</p>
<p>be producing an infinite amount of heat.</p>
<p>And by the way, here&rsquo;s the sun,</p>
<p>and we can look at the sun,</p>
<p>and we can figure out it&rsquo;s made out of hydrogen.</p>
<p>And Lord Kelvin actually made a very famous calculation,</p>
<p>who was basically one of the founders of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>So you look at the hydrogen.</p>
<p>Hydrogen has a certain energy content.</p>
<p>You know the latent heat, basically, of hydrogen.</p>
<p>We know the mass of the sun,</p>
<p>because we knew the size of it.</p>
<p>And he conclusively proved that basically,</p>
<p>the sun could only make net energy</p>
<p>for about 2,000 or 3,000 years.</p>
<p>So therefore, all this nonsense about deep,</p>
<p>because clearly, the sun can only last</p>
<p>for 2,000 or 3,000 years.</p>
<p>If you think about the,</p>
<p>and this is basically the chemical energy content</p>
<p>of hydrogen, and what comes along.</p>
<p>In one decade, basically, one guy sitting</p>
<p>in a postal office in Switzerland,</p>
<p>figures out that all these, Einstein, of course,</p>
<p>which was, figured out all this,</p>
<p>took these seemingly unconnected things,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, boom, there it is.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just him, but it was,</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s quantum physics.</p>
<p>Like, this explains this other disaster.</p>
<p>And then this other guy, my hero,</p>
<p>Ernest Rutherford, experimentalist,</p>
<p>did the most extraordinary experiment,</p>
<p>which is like, which was that,</p>
<p>okay, they had these funny rocks.</p>
<p>They emitted these particles.</p>
<p>In fact, they called them alpha particles.</p>
<p>Alpha, just A in the alphabet, right?</p>
<p>Because it was the first thing that they discovered.</p>
<p>And what were they doing?</p>
<p>So they were taking these alpha particles,</p>
<p>and by the way, I do this to all my students,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a demonstration of what you should be</p>
<p>as a good scientist.</p>
<p>So he took these alpha things,</p>
<p>and he was a classically trained physicist,</p>
<p>knew everything about momentum scattering,</p>
<p>and so forth like that.</p>
<p>And he took this, and these alpha,</p>
<p>which clearly were some kind of energy,</p>
<p>but they couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out what it was.</p>
<p>So he said, let&rsquo;s try to figure that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll actually use this to try to probe the nature of matter.</p>
<p>So he took this, took these alpha particles,</p>
<p>and a very, very thin gold foil.</p>
<p>And so what you wanted to see was that,</p>
<p>as they were going through,</p>
<p>the way that they would scatter,</p>
<p>in fact, the Coulomb collision,</p>
<p>based on classical mechanics,</p>
<p>this will tell me, reveal something</p>
<p>about what the nature of the charge distribution is</p>
<p>in matter, because they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Where the hell is this stuff coming from?</p>
<p>Even though they&rsquo;d solved electromagnetism,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know what made up charges.</p>
<p>Okay, very interesting.</p>
<p>Through it goes, and so what did you set up?</p>
<p>So it turns out, in these experiments,</p>
<p>what you did was, because these so-called alphas,</p>
<p>which actually now we know is something else,</p>
<p>as they go through, they would deflect,</p>
<p>how much they deflect tells you</p>
<p>how strong an electric field they saw.</p>
<p>So you put detectors,</p>
<p>because if you put like a piece of glass in front of this,</p>
<p>what will happen is that when the alpha particle hits,</p>
<p>it literally gives a little boop,</p>
<p>a little boop of light like this.</p>
<p>It scintillates, a little blue flash.</p>
<p>So he would train his students or postdocs</p>
<p>or whatever the heck they were at the time,</p>
<p>you have to train yourself,</p>
<p>because you have to put yourself in the dark for like hours</p>
<p>to get your eyes adjusted.</p>
<p>And then they would start the experiment</p>
<p>and they would sit there and literally count the things.</p>
<p>And they could see this pattern developing,</p>
<p>which was revealing about what was going on.</p>
<p>But there was also another part of the experiment,</p>
<p>which was that, it&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s the alphas,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the source, they&rsquo;re going this way.</p>
<p>They could tell they were going in one direction only,</p>
<p>basically, they&rsquo;re going in this direction.</p>
<p>And you put all these over here,</p>
<p>because you want to see how they deflect</p>
<p>and bend through it.</p>
<p>But you put a control in the experiment,</p>
<p>but you basically put glass plates back here,</p>
<p>because obviously, everything should just deflect,</p>
<p>but nothing should bounce back.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a control in the experiment.</p>
<p>But what did they see?</p>
<p>They saw things bouncing back.</p>
<p>Like, what the hell?</p>
<p>Like, that fit no model of any idea, right?</p>
<p>But Rutherford refused to ignore what was a clear,</p>
<p>they validated it, and he sat down,</p>
<p>and based on classical physics,</p>
<p>he made the most extraordinary discovery,</p>
<p>which was the nucleus,</p>
<p>which is a very, very strange discovery.</p>
<p>What I mean by that,</p>
<p>because what he could figure out from this</p>
<p>is that in order for these particles</p>
<p>to bounce back and hit this plate,</p>
<p>they were hitting something that must be heavier than them.</p>
<p>And that basically something like 99.999% of the mass,</p>
<p>of the matter that was in this gold foil</p>
<p>was in something that contained</p>
<p>about one trillionth of the volume of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s called the nucleus.</p>
<p>And until, and you talk about, so how revealing is this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this totally changes your idea of the universe,</p>
<p>because a nucleus is a very unintuitive,</p>
<p>non-intuitive thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why is all the mass in something</p>
<p>that is like zero,</p>
<p>like, basically it was the realization</p>
<p>that matter is empty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all empty space.</p>
<p>And that changes everything.</p>
<p>And it changes everything.</p>
<p>Until you had that, like you had steam engines,</p>
<p>by the way, you had telegraph wires,</p>
<p>you had all those things.</p>
<p>But that realization opened up,</p>
<p>those two realizations opened up everything,</p>
<p>like lasers, all these things about the modern world</p>
<p>of what we use.</p>
<p>And that set it up.</p>
<p>So all I would point out is that there&rsquo;s a story already</p>
<p>that sometimes there&rsquo;s these nagging things</p>
<p>at the edge of science that,</p>
<p>we pat ourselves on the back</p>
<p>and we think we got everything under control.</p>
<p>Of course, by the way, that was the origin of also that,</p>
<p>think about this, that was 1908.</p>
<p>It took like another 20 some years</p>
<p>before people put that together with,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the process that&rsquo;s powering stars,</p>
<p>is the rearrangement of those nuclei, not atoms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Kelvin wasn&rsquo;t wrong,</p>
<p>he just was working with the wrong assumptions, right?</p>
<p>So fast forward to today, like what would this mean?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things like this</p>
<p>that sit out there in physics.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll point out one of them, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what the hell makes up 90%</p>
<p>of the mass in the universe.</p>
<p>So the search for dark matter, right?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>We still haven&rsquo;t discovered it.</p>
<p>90% of the mass of the universe is undetectable.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>And then, and dark energy, and again,</p>
<p>black holes are the window into this,</p>
<p>the edge of the black hole.</p>
<p>I mean, in some sense,</p>
<p>black holes are way better understood</p>
<p>than those things as well too.</p>
<p>So all it tells us is that we shouldn&rsquo;t have hubris</p>
<p>about the ideas that we understand everything.</p>
<p>And when we, who knows what the next major</p>
<p>intellectual insight will be</p>
<p>about how the universe functions.</p>
<p>And actually, I think Rutherford is the one</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s attributed at least that quote,</p>
<p>that physics is the only real science,</p>
<p>everything else is stamp collecting, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m sorry, he&rsquo;s my hero,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll slightly disagree with that, yes.</p>
<p>Well, no offense to stamp collecting,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very important too.</p>
<p>But you know, you have to have humility</p>
<p>about the kind of disciplines that make progress</p>
<p>at every stage in science.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Physics did make a huge amount of progress</p>
<p>in the 20th century, but it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that other disciplines start to step in.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Rutherford couldn&rsquo;t imagine</p>
<p>like mapping the human genome</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t even know about DNA.</p>
<p>Yeah, or computers really.</p>
<p>Or computers.</p>
<p>He probably didn&rsquo;t think deeply about computation.</p>
<p>Who knows, it&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s a wild one,</p>
<p>what if like the next great revelation to humanity</p>
<p>about the universe is not done by the human mind?</p>
<p>That seems increasingly more likely.</p>
<p>And then you start to ask deep questions</p>
<p>about what is the purpose of science?</p>
<p>For example, if AI system will design</p>
<p>a nuclear fusion reactor better than humans do,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t quite understand how it works,</p>
<p>and the AI can&rsquo;t, we know that it works,</p>
<p>we can test it very thoroughly,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know exactly what the control mechanism is,</p>
<p>maybe what the chemistry of the physics is.</p>
<p>AI can&rsquo;t quite explain it.</p>
<p>They just can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impenetrable to our consciousness, basically,</p>
<p>trying to hold it all together.</p>
<p>And then, okay, so now we&rsquo;re living in that world</p>
<p>where many of the biggest discoveries</p>
<p>are made by AI systems.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As if we weren&rsquo;t growing bigger.</p>
<p>I say, again, I will point out,</p>
<p>like when my godmother was born,</p>
<p>none of this was in front of us, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we live in an amazing time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like my grandfather plowed fields with a horse.</p>
<p>I get to work on designing fusion reactors.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty amazing time.</p>
<p>But still, there&rsquo;s humans, so we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see if that&rsquo;s around 100 years.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll be cyborgs and robots.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re pretty resilient, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>One lesson from life is it finds a way.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a bigger question.</p>
<p>As if those weren&rsquo;t big enough,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s look out maybe a few hundred years,</p>
<p>maybe a few thousand years out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called the Kardashev scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a method of measuring civilization&rsquo;s level</p>
<p>of technological advancement</p>
<p>based on the amount of energy it&rsquo;s able to use.</p>
<p>So type one civilization,</p>
<p>and this might be given all your work,</p>
<p>is no longer a scale that quite makes sense,</p>
<p>but it very much focuses on the source of fusion,</p>
<p>natural source of fusion, which is, for us, the sun.</p>
<p>And type one civilizations are able to leverage,</p>
<p>sort of collect all the energy that hits Earth.</p>
<p>And then type two civilizations</p>
<p>are the ones that are able to leverage</p>
<p>the entirety of the energy that comes from the sun</p>
<p>by maybe building something.</p>
<p>Like a Dyson sphere.</p>
<p>Dyson sphere, yeah.</p>
<p>So when will we reach type one status?</p>
<p>Is get to the level, which we&rsquo;re, I think,</p>
<p>maybe a few orders of magnitude away from currently.</p>
<p>And in general, do you think about this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>is where energy&rsquo;s so fundamental to the,</p>
<p>like, of life on Earth,</p>
<p>but also the expansion of life into the universe?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, so one of the fun, on a weekend,</p>
<p>I sat down and figured out what would it mean</p>
<p>for interstellar travel, like, to have a DT fusion.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the, I talked about my design class.</p>
<p>One of my design classes was how you use,</p>
<p>essentially, a special configuration of a fusion device</p>
<p>for not only traveling to, but colonizing Mars.</p>
<p>So, because what would it,</p>
<p>you talk about energy use being</p>
<p>at the heart of civilizations, like,</p>
<p>so what if you want to go to Mars not to just visit it,</p>
<p>but actually, like, leave people there</p>
<p>and make something happen?</p>
<p>Needs massive amounts of energy.</p>
<p>So, what would that look like?</p>
<p>And it actually transforms how you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about doing that, as well, too.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, so we do all those kinds of fun.</p>
<p>And actually, it was a fairly quasi-realistic, actually.</p>
<p>So, do you think it&rsquo;ll be nuclear fusion</p>
<p>that powers the civilization on Mars?</p>
<p>Well, what we considered was something,</p>
<p>so it turns out that there&rsquo;s thorium,</p>
<p>which is a heavy element,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a so-called fertile element,</p>
<p>that we know, we still know fairly little</p>
<p>about the geology of Mars, in the deep sense,</p>
<p>and we know that there&rsquo;s a lot of this</p>
<p>on the surface of Mars.</p>
<p>So, one of the things we considered</p>
<p>was what would happen,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s basically a combination of a fusion device</p>
<p>that actually makes fuel from the thorium.</p>
<p>But the underlying energy one</p>
<p>was fission itself, as well, too.</p>
<p>So, this is one of the examples of being,</p>
<p>trying to be clever around those things.</p>
<p>Or what is it, you know, this also means</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like interstellar travel.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that looks almost impossible, basically,</p>
<p>from an energy balance point of view,</p>
<p>just because the energy required</p>
<p>that you have to transport to get there,</p>
<p>almost the only things that would work</p>
<p>are DT fusion and basically annihilation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Star Trek, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>So, your sense is that interstellar travel</p>
<p>will require fusion power?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s almost even impossible</p>
<p>with fusion power, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard.</p>
<p>Because you have to carry the fuel with you,</p>
<p>and the rocket equation tells you</p>
<p>about how much fuel you&rsquo;ll use to take.</p>
<p>So, what you end up with is, like,</p>
<p>how long does it take to go to these places?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, like, staggering, you know, periods of time.</p>
<p>So, I tend to believe that there&rsquo;s alien civilizations</p>
<p>dispersed all throughout the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we might be totally isolated from them.</p>
<p>So, you think we&rsquo;re not, there&rsquo;s none in this galaxy?</p>
<p>So, like, I guess, and the question I also have</p>
<p>is what kind of, do you think they have nuclear fusion?</p>
<p>Is it all, is the physics all the same?</p>
<p>Yeah, oh, the physics is all the same.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>So, this is the, and this is the Fermi paradox.</p>
<p>Like, where the hell is everybody in the universe?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s some, you know, the scariest one of those</p>
<p>is that, I would point out that there&rsquo;s been, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, you know, order of many tens of millions</p>
<p>of species on the planet Earth,</p>
<p>and only one ever got to the point</p>
<p>of sophisticated tool use</p>
<p>that we could actually start essentially leveraging</p>
<p>the power of what&rsquo;s in nature to our own will.</p>
<p>Does this mean that basically this means,</p>
<p>so almost, look, there is almost certainly life</p>
<p>or DNA equivalents or whatever would be somewhere.</p>
<p>I mean, just because you just need a soup</p>
<p>and you need energy and you get organics</p>
<p>and whatever the equivalent of amino acids are.</p>
<p>But, you know, most of the life on Earth</p>
<p>has been that, those are still amazing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still, like, it&rsquo;s not very interesting.</p>
<p>Are we actually the accident of history?</p>
<p>This is a very interesting one.</p>
<p>Super, super rare accident.</p>
<p>Super rare.</p>
<p>And then, of course, the other part is that also just,</p>
<p>the other scary part of it,</p>
<p>which is if you look at the Fermi paradoxes,</p>
<p>good, we got to this point, how long has it been</p>
<p>in humans, so humans, homo sapien has been around</p>
<p>for whatever, 100,000 years, 200,000 years, something like that.</p>
<p>Our ability in that timeline to actually make an imprint</p>
<p>on the universe by emitting radio waves</p>
<p>or by modifying nature in a significant way</p>
<p>has only been for about 100 of those 100,000 years.</p>
<p>And, you know, are we, it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>So, is it by definition, by the fact</p>
<p>that when you are able to reach that level</p>
<p>of being able to manipulate nature,</p>
<p>for example, discover, you know, discover, like, fission</p>
<p>or burning fossil fuels and all this,</p>
<p>is that what it says, oh, you&rsquo;re doomed,</p>
<p>because by definition, any species that gets to that point</p>
<p>that can modify their environment like that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll actually push themselves, you know, past,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the most depressing scenarios</p>
<p>that I can imagine.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the&hellip;</p>
<p>So, basically, we will never line up in time</p>
<p>because you get this little teeny window in time</p>
<p>where civilization might occur and you can never see it</p>
<p>because you never, these sort of, like,</p>
<p>scatter like fireflies around the galaxy</p>
<p>and you never, yeah.</p>
<p>It goes up, goes up, goes up, goes up,</p>
<p>and then explodes, destroys itself</p>
<p>because of the exponential.</p>
<p>And when we say destroy ourselves,</p>
<p>all we&rsquo;d have to do is that we basically go,</p>
<p>if humans are all left</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still living on the planet,</p>
<p>but all we have to do is go to the technology</p>
<p>of, like, you know, 1800</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re invisible in the universe again.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, it was, when I listened to the podcast,</p>
<p>I thought I wanted to talk about this as well, too,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, it comes from,</p>
<p>well, it comes from a science point of view, actually,</p>
<p>of what it means.</p>
<p>But also, to me, it&rsquo;s like another compelling driver</p>
<p>of telling us, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why we should try really hard not to screw this up.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re in this unique place</p>
<p>of our ability to discover and to make it.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t want to give up</p>
<p>about thinking that we can get through.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tend to see</p>
<p>that there is some kind of game theoretic force,</p>
<p>like with mutually assured destruction,</p>
<p>that ultimately, in each human being,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a desire to survive</p>
<p>and a willingness to cooperate,</p>
<p>to have compassion for each other in order to survive.</p>
<p>And I think that, I mean, maybe not in humans,</p>
<p>but I can imagine a nearly infinite number of species</p>
<p>in which that overpowers</p>
<p>any technological advancement that can destroy</p>
<p>or rewind the species.</p>
<p>So I think if humans fail, I hope they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I see a lot of evidence for them not,</p>
<p>but it seems like somebody will survive.</p>
<p>And there, you start to ask questions</p>
<p>about why we haven&rsquo;t met yet.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just space is large.</p>
<p>Oh, space is, it&rsquo;s, I think in logarithms,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t even fathom space,</p>
<p>this is extraordinary, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extraordinarily large, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many places on Earth.</p>
<p>I just recently visited Paris for the first time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many other places I haven&rsquo;t visited yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many other places.</p>
<p>Well, I like to, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting that we have this fascination</p>
<p>with alien life.</p>
<p>We have what is essentially alien life on Earth already.</p>
<p>Like you think about the organisms</p>
<p>that develop around deep sea, like thermal vents.</p>
<p>One of my favorite books of all time from Stephen Jay Gould.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never read that book,</p>
<p>it kind of blows your mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the Cambrian explosion of life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, oh, you look at these things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, the chance of us existing as a species,</p>
<p>like the genetic diversity was larger back then.</p>
<p>You know, this is about 500 million years ago</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It is a mind-altering trip</p>
<p>of thinking about our place in the universe,</p>
<p>I have to say.</p>
<p>Plus the mind itself is a kind of alien,</p>
<p>almost a mystery to ourselves.</p>
<p>We still don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>The very mechanism that helps us explore the world</p>
<p>is still a mystery.</p>
<p>So understanding that will also unlock,</p>
<p>quite possibly unlock our ability to understand the world</p>
<p>and maybe build machines that help us understand the world,</p>
<p>build tools that help us understand the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it already has.</p>
<p>I mean, our ability to understand the world</p>
<p>is ridiculous almost, actually.</p>
<p>And post the bot on TikTok.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost unbelievable where we&rsquo;ve gotten all this to.</p>
<p>So what advice would you give to young folks</p>
<p>or folks of all ages who are lost in this world,</p>
<p>looking for a way, looking for a career</p>
<p>that they can be proud of</p>
<p>or looking to have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Yeah, oh, the first thing I would say is don&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>I get to see multiple sides of this</p>
<p>and there seems to be a level of despair</p>
<p>in a young generation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, it&rsquo;s almost like the Monty Python skit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not dead yet, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a place that,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t say the world&rsquo;s gonna end in 300 days or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, okay?</p>
<p>And what we mean by this is that we have a robust society</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s figured out how to do amazing things</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna keep doing amazing things.</p>
<p>But that shouldn&rsquo;t be complacency about what our future is</p>
<p>and the future for their children as well too.</p>
<p>And in the end, I mean, it&rsquo;s a very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a staggering legacy to think of what we&rsquo;ve built up</p>
<p>primarily by basically using carbon fuels.</p>
<p>Like people almost tend to think of this</p>
<p>as an evil thing that we&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an amazing thing that we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>but we owe it to ourselves</p>
<p>and to this thing that we&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>I mean, talking about the end of the world is just nonsense.</p>
<p>What it is is it&rsquo;s the end of this kind of lifestyle</p>
<p>and civilization at this scale</p>
<p>and the ability to execute on these kinds of things</p>
<p>that we are talking about today.</p>
<p>Like we are extraordinarily privileged.</p>
<p>We are in a place where it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost unfathomable compared to most of the misery</p>
<p>that humans have lived in for our history.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t give up about this, okay?</p>
<p>But also roll up your sleeves and let&rsquo;s get going</p>
<p>at solving and getting real solutions</p>
<p>to the problems that are in front of us</p>
<p>which are significant.</p>
<p>Most of them are linked to what we use in energy</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s around all the aspects of like,</p>
<p>what does it mean to have a distributed energy source</p>
<p>that lifts billions of people out of poverty</p>
<p>particularly outside of like the Western nations, right?</p>
<p>That seems to me a pretty compelling moral goal</p>
<p>for all of us.</p>
<p>But particularly for this upcoming generation.</p>
<p>And then the other part is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got possible solutions in front of us.</p>
<p>Apply your talents.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re passionate about</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna make a difference.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s only possible with optimism, hope and hard work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What, easy question.</p>
<p>Certainly easier than nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>42.</p>
<p>Is it 42?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>We already discussed about the beauty of physics.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s almost a desire to ask a why question</p>
<p>about why the parameters have these values.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very tempting, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting hole to go down as a scientist</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re a part of what people have a hard time,</p>
<p>people who aren&rsquo;t scientists have a hard time</p>
<p>understanding what scientists do to themselves.</p>
<p>And a great scientist does a very non-intuitive</p>
<p>or non-human thing.</p>
<p>What we do is we train ourselves to doubt ourselves.</p>
<p>Like how?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a great scientist.</p>
<p>We doubt everything we see.</p>
<p>We doubt everything that we think</p>
<p>because we basically try to turn off the belief valve, right?</p>
<p>That humans just naturally have.</p>
<p>So when it comes to these things,</p>
<p>like I can make my own comments to this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, personally, you see these things</p>
<p>about the ratios of life.</p>
<p>And I made a comment where I said,</p>
<p>well, you know, some part of my brain that just goes,</p>
<p>yeah, well, yeah,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re the only interesting multiverse</p>
<p>because by definition, it has to look like this.</p>
<p>But I have to say, there&rsquo;s other times,</p>
<p>I can say in the history of the whole,</p>
<p>of what has happened over the last 10 years,</p>
<p>there have been some pretty weird coincidences,</p>
<p>like coincidences that like you look at it and just go,</p>
<p>is that really, was that really a coincidence?</p>
<p>Is something like pushing us towards these things?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a natural, it&rsquo;s a human instinct</p>
<p>because since the beginnings of humanity,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve always assigned human motivation and needs</p>
<p>to these somewhat empirical observations.</p>
<p>And in some sense, the stories,</p>
<p>before we understand the real explanations,</p>
<p>the stories, the myths serve as a good approximation</p>
<p>for the thing that we&rsquo;re yet to understand.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And in that sense, you said the antithesis</p>
<p>to sort of scientific doubt is having a faith</p>
<p>in these stories.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re almost silly when looked at</p>
<p>from a scientific perspective,</p>
<p>but just even the feelings of,</p>
<p>it seems that love is a fundamental fabric</p>
<p>of human condition.</p>
<p>And what the hell is that?</p>
<p>Why are we so connected to each other?</p>
<p>As a physicist, I go, this is a repeatable thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s due to a set of synapses</p>
<p>that fire in a particular pattern and all this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like, okay, man,</p>
<p>what a drag that is to think of it this way.</p>
<p>And you can have an evolutionary biology explanation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still a magic to it.</p>
<p>I mean, I see scientists, some of my colleagues</p>
<p>do this as well too, like what is spirituality</p>
<p>compared to science and so forth?</p>
<p>I, my own feeling in this is that as a scientist,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of being able</p>
<p>to both understand what my predecessors did,</p>
<p>but I also had the privilege of being able</p>
<p>to discover things, right, as a scientist.</p>
<p>And I see that, and you just,</p>
<p>in just the range of our conversations,</p>
<p>like that is my, in a weird way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the awe that comes from looking at that.</p>
<p>That is, if you&rsquo;re not in awe of the universe and nature,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention.</p>
<p>I mean, my own personal feeling is that I feel,</p>
<p>if I go snorkeling on a coral reef,</p>
<p>I feel more awe than I could ever feel like in a church.</p>
<p>You kind of notice some kind of magic there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the way</p>
<p>the whole darn thing holds together</p>
<p>that just sort of escapes your imagination.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, to me, this thing of,</p>
<p>and then we have different words,</p>
<p>we call them holistic or spiritual,</p>
<p>the way that it all hangs together.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the interesting,</p>
<p>you asked about like what I think about,</p>
<p>one of the craziest things that I think</p>
<p>that how does it hold together is like our society.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Like how, because there&rsquo;s no way,</p>
<p>like you just think of the United States,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 330 million people kind of working like this engine</p>
<p>about going towards making all these things happen,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s like no one in charge of this, really.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>How the heck does this happen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like, it&rsquo;s, so these things,</p>
<p>these are the kinds of things mathematically</p>
<p>and organization-wise that I think of</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re sort of, they&rsquo;re awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different ideas that would come up together</p>
<p>and we share them.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s teams of people</p>
<p>that share different ideas and those ideas compete.</p>
<p>Like there was, the ideas themselves</p>
<p>are these kinds of different organisms</p>
<p>and ultimately somehow we build bridges and nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>And do those things.</p>
<p>Well, I have to give a shout out to my daughter,</p>
<p>by the way, who&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an applied math major and she&rsquo;s amazing at math.</p>
<p>And over the break, she was showing me</p>
<p>she was doing research and it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>about how ideas and ethos are transmitted within a society.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s building an applied math model</p>
<p>that is explaining like, she was showing me</p>
<p>in this simulation, she goes, oh, look at this.</p>
<p>And I said, oh, oh, that&rsquo;s like how political parties</p>
<p>like evolve, right?</p>
<p>And even though it was a rather, quote unquote,</p>
<p>simple mathematical model, it wasn&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, wow.</p>
<p>Well, maybe she has a chance to derive mathematically</p>
<p>the answer to what&rsquo;s the meaning of life.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>And maybe it is indeed 42.</p>
<p>Well, Dennis, thank you so much for just doing,</p>
<p>creating tools, creating systems, exploring this idea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the most amazing magical ideas</p>
<p>in all of human endeavor, which is nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s almost like my, one of my lifelong goals</p>
<p>is like to make it, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not magic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s boring as all heck.</p>
<p>And this means we&rsquo;re using it everywhere, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the magic is then built on top of it.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for everything you do.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor.</p>
<p>This was a fascinating and amazing conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Dennis White.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>There are two ways to live your life.</p>
<p>One is as though nothing is a miracle.</p>
<p>The other is though everything&rsquo;s a miracle.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
