Hi, everyone.
My name is Adina.
I&amp;rsquo;m the CEO of Divi Homes.
It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasure to meet y&amp;rsquo;all.
Thank you for being here.
All right.
So while they&amp;rsquo;re pulling that up, I will just kick it off and get started because we&amp;rsquo;re
about three hours behind at this point.
My passions are at the crossroads of finance, housing, and inequality and trying to solve
all of these.
I&amp;rsquo;ll get into what my company does at the very end of the presentation.'>

    <p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Hi, everyone.</p>
<p>My name is Adina.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the CEO of Divi Homes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>Thank you for being here.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So while they&rsquo;re pulling that up, I will just kick it off and get started because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about three hours behind at this point.</p>
<p>My passions are at the crossroads of finance, housing, and inequality and trying to solve</p>
<p>all of these.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get into what my company does at the very end of the presentation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I really want to focus on.</p>
<p>But I want to start off with a little story that I think explains why this is so important</p>
<p>to me.</p>
<p>When it was about the 1980s, my mom decided to go on a little road trip with her friends.</p>
<p>And she was in Israel, and she was backpacking, and she was hitchhiking.</p>
<p>And a man picked her up.</p>
<p>She got into that car, fell in love, and got pregnant.</p>
<p>That man is my dad.</p>
<p>My mom and dad quickly got married, immigrated back to the U.S., and found themselves very</p>
<p>young, 21 and 24, pregnant, and trying to figure out what they were going to do with</p>
<p>their life.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t get a mortgage to buy a house and settle down and be able to raise a family.</p>
<p>But they were fortunate enough to find a woman who gave them seller financing on their</p>
<p>house.</p>
<p>So this woman financed the purchase of the house to let my parents pay an installment.</p>
<p>And in that house, they had three additional kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the third of four.</p>
<p>And then eventually were able to get a mortgage, take cash out of that house, and use the cash</p>
<p>that they took out to pay for all four kids to go to college.</p>
<p>And I tell you this because, to me, this is the heart of the American dream, which is</p>
<p>being able to provide a better life for your children than what you actually have.</p>
<p>And so so much of what we&rsquo;re going to be talking about here is why that American dream has</p>
<p>disappeared for so many Americans and what we at Divi are doing to try to address that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>
<p>I have these bright blue slides.</p>
<p>The goal is to just give you the takeaways so you don&rsquo;t have to figure it out.</p>
<p>I try to stick to one chart per slide to keep it super simple, and I&rsquo;ll explain it.</p>
<p>But this is the takeaway that you should get from the next couple of data points I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to give you, which is wealth inequality is rising across America.</p>
<p>I think y&rsquo;all know this chart, which is that 99% of wealth is owned by the top 50%, and</p>
<p>the bottom 50% only own 1% of wealth here in the United States.</p>
<p>So this chart shows distribution of wealth by what your household income is.</p>
<p>So the top 10% of owners, sorry, the top 10% own 76% of wealth, the next 40% own 23% of</p>
<p>wealth, and you sum that up, 99% of wealth is owned by the top 50%.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s even more interesting is that the rich are getting richer while the poor kind</p>
<p>of stay at the same level of income.</p>
<p>And so what this chart actually shows is income percentiles.</p>
<p>So on the x-axis, the zero is if you&rsquo;re at the very bottom end of the income spectrum,</p>
<p>100%, you&rsquo;re at the top end.</p>
<p>And then the blue line is how much income or family household wealth you had in 1963,</p>
<p>almost 50 years ago.</p>
<p>And the yellow line shows how much wealth you have today.</p>
<p>So if you were in the top 1%, your household wealth was on average $2 million 50 years</p>
<p>ago.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s about $10 million or a 5x growth.</p>
<p>And if you were in the bottom 50th percentile, you haven&rsquo;t seen your household income change</p>
<p>almost at all.</p>
<p>And so you might be asking, okay, why is this the case?</p>
<p>Is it that wealthy people are making more in salary?</p>
<p>I would say while there are some salary differentials, the main driver is asset appreciation, access</p>
<p>to assets.</p>
<p>And when I say assets, I&rsquo;m going to use that pretty liberally, it can mean stocks, it can</p>
<p>mean housing, it can mean small businesses, direct investments.</p>
<p>But all of that in a group together is investments in assets.</p>
<p>And so you can see this is a really simple chart where I took what were the 20-year returns</p>
<p>by income as well as asset.</p>
<p>And you can see that household income has not appreciated much in the last 20 years,</p>
<p>whereas the S&amp;P 500, as well as if you owned equity in your home, you&rsquo;d see an increase</p>
<p>in your value of over 100%.</p>
<p>You want to see something even crazier?</p>
<p>You get leverage on your home equity, which is something that most of you, some of you</p>
<p>might get leverage against your equity, but you mess with the stock market, but most of</p>
<p>you aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can actually lever up your home equity, right?</p>
<p>And so you can take out debt that&rsquo;s cheap because it&rsquo;s backed and guaranteed by the</p>
<p>government, 80% leverage at what has been almost 3% cost of capital.</p>
<p>No one else can get that sort of cost of capital at that sort of leverage.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re forced to amortize, so you build up savings in the property, and a house has dual</p>
<p>utility.</p>
<p>You cannot live in the S&amp;P 500, you can live in a home.</p>
<p>So if we click on, and so the takeaway has to be those who own assets are more likely</p>
<p>to have a higher net worth.</p>
<p>And so this is a chart that I stole from the New York Times, so credit goes to them.</p>
<p>But if you look on the left-hand side, the blue bars, all of the bars kind of sum up</p>
<p>to 100% going across.</p>
<p>So the blue bars is the percent of families, so bottom 50 percentile of income earners,</p>
<p>50%, 50 to 80th percentile, 30%, so on.</p>
<p>And what this is saying is that the bottom 50% of families and households own 1% of overall</p>
<p>equities in the market.</p>
<p>So when you look at directly held stocks, so stocks in the stock market, they own 0%.</p>
<p>And if you look at the top 1% of income earners, they own 38% of overall equities, which includes</p>
<p>like retirement accounts and everything, remember I said that big asset class.</p>
<p>And they own 51% of all directly held stocks.</p>
<p>So if you ask why are the rich getting richer, it is because they own assets.</p>
<p>Assets compound over time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a ton of tax benefits around owning assets, long-term capital gains, which</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you all know.</p>
<p>Another way to look at this, which I think is really interesting, is your net worth by</p>
<p>renter versus homeowner.</p>
<p>Homeowners on average have 75 times the net worth of a renter.</p>
<p>This is all census data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all publicly available.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to share it.</p>
<p>And I think what is so interesting here is that I&rsquo;m not saying the answer is homeownership.</p>
<p>If you want to invest in crypto, great.</p>
<p>You want to put your money into the S&amp;P 500, even better.</p>
<p>However, the majority of Americans, as you just saw on this slide, don&rsquo;t invest in equities</p>
<p>as much, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard to conceptualize, whereas a house is actually pretty easy to conceptualize.</p>
<p>And because the debt amortizes, you&rsquo;re forced to save over time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly illiquid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to take your money out of it.</p>
<p>It is what makes a great investment.</p>
<p>And so when you look at why this chart is so high, it&rsquo;s not because homeowners are saving</p>
<p>a tremendous amount more, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting money into the equity of the home.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re being forced to in their payments.</p>
<p>So despite the benefits of homeownership, it is starting to become fundamentally inaccessible.</p>
<p>So this is a chart, really simple, of average home prices.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different sources you can measure home prices, but you can see that</p>
<p>at the bottom of the recession, which was actually 2012 for home prices, the average</p>
<p>home price in America was $163,000, and that today, it&rsquo;s closer to $338,000, so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a 200% increase in 10 years.</p>
<p>At the same time, real median income has only increased from about $57,000 to $67,000.</p>
<p>So what has caused prices for homes to increase so dramatically?</p>
<p>If I do, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that none of this is new news.</p>
<p>You all have been seeing how much home prices have risen.</p>
<p>For those of you who have bought while interest rates were still 3%, good on you, because</p>
<p>that is probably the lowest they&rsquo;re going to be in a really, really long time.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the quick history, which is from 2000 to 2008, we were building on average</p>
<p>1.5 million homes a year, not billion, gosh, 1.5 million homes a year, and that equated</p>
<p>to roughly four to five months of inventory.</p>
<p>Months of inventory mean that if there were no more homes that were put on the market,</p>
<p>how long would it take to sell all those homes, four to five months, and that&rsquo;s generally</p>
<p>considered a balanced real estate market.</p>
<p>Then what happened?</p>
<p>The global financial crisis.</p>
<p>There was a mass number of foreclosures.</p>
<p>The market was completely flooded, and all of a sudden, you could buy an existing home</p>
<p>that was going into foreclosure for $163,000, and so builders who had to pay for labor,</p>
<p>for lumber, right, to actually build a house couldn&rsquo;t build a house for that cheap.</p>
<p>The cheapest that a home builder can build a home is roughly $200,000, all in cost, right?</p>
<p>And so if you can sit there and you&rsquo;re like, I can only build a house for $200,000, which</p>
<p>means I have to sell it for more than $200,000, well, I can&rsquo;t compete with existing foreclosure</p>
<p>inventory.</p>
<p>So home builders stopped building.</p>
<p>They went from building 1.5 million a year down to about 750,000 homes a year after that,</p>
<p>and it stayed like that until about 2015, and at that point, a lot of the inventory</p>
<p>that came from foreclosures were absorbed, and they started actually rebuilding again,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t rebuild at the same rate that they had prior.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rebuilding right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building probably new inventories, I&rsquo;d say 1.2 million annually, and so then this</p>
<p>massive thing happened, which is COVID, and all of a sudden, everyone went from living</p>
<p>in their studio apartment to saying, I need a backyard, I need an extra room for childcare,</p>
<p>and I need an office, and there was this mass spike in demand after years of not building</p>
<p>enough inventory, and so what happens when demand starts to spike and there&rsquo;s not a lot</p>
<p>of supply?</p>
<p>Well, home prices took off, which you can kind of see right over here is that little</p>
<p>spiky part at the very end.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s amazing is that it&rsquo;s actually just gotten incredibly harder, not just because</p>
<p>home prices are getting more expensive, but because of the impact that that has in terms</p>
<p>of how much you actually need to save to buy a home.</p>
<p>So the left-hand chart shows the yellow bar is your average down payment, and you can</p>
<p>see that that&rsquo;s grown roughly 2x.</p>
<p>At the same time, median income in the last 20 years hasn&rsquo;t gone up, so on an absolute</p>
<p>dollar basis, you now need to save 2x the amount that you would have had to save back</p>
<p>in 2000.</p>
<p>So one, it&rsquo;s down payment is an issue.</p>
<p>The second issue is that post-global financial crisis, rightly so, the government tightened</p>
<p>underwriting requirements.</p>
<p>They said, you know what?</p>
<p>It turns out when you cause a global worldwide recession, we should maybe change how we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing things, and so they pulled back and said, we&rsquo;re going to make you have a higher</p>
<p>FICO in order to be able to purchase a home, which is probably the right answer, but also</p>
<p>pretty painful because people don&rsquo;t wake up one day and they&rsquo;re like, I no longer need</p>
<p>a home, right?</p>
<p>And so if you take a look at this, the average FICO for homebuyers is well above what the</p>
<p>average FICO is for the general population, and anyone who&rsquo;s under 45 years is even lower</p>
<p>because FICO cures over time.</p>
<p>And so what does this all come together and say is that unless you, you know, have the</p>
<p>ability to save 2x the amount, unless you are above average in terms of FICO when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting off your life in a starter home, you&rsquo;re going to struggle to actually be able</p>
<p>to buy a home.</p>
<p>Now this chart seems a little confusing, but I think it&rsquo;s really important to look at and</p>
<p>understand, so I&rsquo;ll walk you through it.</p>
<p>So what this chart shows is mortgage rates, 3%, 6%, 9%.</p>
<p>We were at 3%, call it a year ago, we&rsquo;re at I think 5.5% right now is roughly where the</p>
<p>30-year fixed is, and then 9%, who knows, maybe hopefully not in the future.</p>
<p>And that says what is your mortgage tax and insurance payments, what you have to include</p>
<p>for a $400,000 home, which is roughly average home price, and I know a little different</p>
<p>in Miami, but this is kind of across the U.S.</p>
<p>And then I said how much income do you need in order to get that mortgage?</p>
<p>And you can see that your income that you need goes from about $94,000 of household</p>
<p>income up to about $160,000 of household income.</p>
<p>And then I said how many households could qualify for that, because there&rsquo;s data on</p>
<p>how much income households make across the U.S., there are 126 million households in</p>
<p>the U.S.</p>
<p>And you can see that historically almost 40%, sorry, 30% of households actually could afford</p>
<p>a mortgage where we were before, and that number today has gone down to now 22%, and</p>
<p>will go down to about less than 15% of people who can actually get a mortgage on a home.</p>
<p>This is insane.</p>
<p>So over here I kind of, I like to just overly simplify things, so I kind of put it here,</p>
<p>which is a $10,000 increase in home prices means one million fewer families can own a</p>
<p>home, or a 1% increase in mortgage rates means five million families can actually own</p>
<p>a home.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in a little bit of a tough situation here.</p>
<p>So when I started Dibi, the goal was to help solve wealth inequality by giving Americans</p>
<p>access to assets.</p>
<p>This is the sole goal, the purpose, what I really believe in, which is that access to</p>
<p>assets and compounding wealth in something that you cannot easily pull your money out</p>
<p>of and you just leave it there is the way that we can help people generate wealth for</p>
<p>their families, for their children, for their next generation.</p>
<p>So the way Dibi works is very similar to a mortgage, except it&rsquo;s not a mortgage.</p>
<p>You come to our website, you apply, we give you a budget.</p>
<p>So we might say, hey, you&rsquo;re approved for a $500,000 home in Miami, go out shopping.</p>
<p>You shop with your realtor the same way you would with a mortgage, and when you&rsquo;re ready</p>
<p>to buy a home, you just let us know what home you choose.</p>
<p>We say, great, we put out an all-cash, quick-close offer for you, so you can compete with every</p>
<p>other investor offer that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take care of it for you because we know how to bid on these homes.</p>
<p>We then take care of the inspections, we cover all closing costs, all fees, everything.</p>
<p>We head to closing, and you commit either 1% to 2% down, which is about a tenth of a</p>
<p>usual down payment.</p>
<p>Down payments are 10% to 20%, and we say 1% to 2%, and that&rsquo;s your initial equity in the</p>
<p>home.</p>
<p>You own that.</p>
<p>And then you move in, you make one monthly payment, part rent, part equity, the same</p>
<p>way a mortgage is principal and interest, and the equity piece builds up your percent</p>
<p>ownership.</p>
<p>We let you build up to 10% over the course of three years.</p>
<p>At any point in time, you can get a mortgage or refinance and take us out, or you can cash</p>
<p>out your equity and walk away hopefully with tens of thousands of dollars saved up.</p>
<p>So that is how we work.</p>
<p>We operate in 16 metros.</p>
<p>Our biggest ones are Georgia, Texas, and Florida.</p>
<p>Florida is a big one, up in Tampa.</p>
<p>The average income of our customers is about a $50,000 to $150,000 household income.</p>
<p>50% of our customers are people of color, and 80% of our transactions are female-led.</p>
<p>And so I think the most important thing is, are we successful in our mission and what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to do?</p>
<p>So 51% of DB customers who have come to the end of their three-year lease have been able</p>
<p>to buy back their home.</p>
<p>Probably another 20% on top of it aren&rsquo;t yet ready for mortgage, and so we just let them</p>
<p>build more equity over time.</p>
<p>And about 30% of people turn over, which is completely fine.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have an extra kid or two and you need a bigger home, and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>We actually love that people can cash out their money and continue moving on.</p>
<p>Over here we have what I think is one of the more powerful things, which is the average</p>
<p>renter savings versus the average savings that a DB customer has in their home.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost 25 times the savings that the average renter has, and this is because they</p>
<p>are building up equity in their property over time.</p>
<p>Over here, just to show we&rsquo;re growing quickly and we&rsquo;re doing it profitably, I actually</p>
<p>think this is super important, is you can sit here and say that you are building a mission-oriented</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>You have to show scale.</p>
<p>You have to show growth, and you have to show the people there is adoption and you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>having an impact.</p>
<p>This year alone, we&rsquo;ll deploy over a billion dollars of capital.</p>
<p>We measure a margin as the rent that we collect, less home cost, less interest, so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a true profit all-in margin, where we&rsquo;re almost probably going to be at about 25% all-in profit</p>
<p>margin.</p>
<p>And now I think we have &hellip; Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>I think that there was a video, but I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re showing it, so we can maybe</p>
<p>go to Q&amp;A if we&rsquo;re running close on time.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>I know that Freeberg&rsquo;s going to talk to you about consumer credit, but let me just tee</p>
<p>up something before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tweet, I just want to read it to you, and maybe we can use this as a jumping</p>
<p>off point.</p>
<p>Blackstone calls homes almost as unaffordable as the 2007 peak.</p>
<p>They just said that today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>His name is Joe Zittle, who&rsquo;s I guess a senior partner there.</p>
<p>But he believes a crash is unlikely due to a major difference, which is that most owners</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t using their homes like an ATM like they did back then.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you just explain sort of the broader state of housing, actually, and why some people</p>
<p>feel like we&rsquo;re actually right at the brink of a crisis again, and some people don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>So the global financial crisis is very different than this, because it was obviously a housing-led</p>
<p>crisis, where we had people overextend, and they didn&rsquo;t have enough equity that was built</p>
<p>up in their house to cushion a decline in home prices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that this is a very different situation today, and I&rsquo;d say that because, one, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a lot of supply.</p>
<p>And so fundamentally when you&rsquo;re thinking about pricing, supply and demand dynamics,</p>
<p>number one, we don&rsquo;t have a lot of supply.</p>
<p>Now, what you can probably argue is there is an equilibrium point, meaning interest</p>
<p>rates are increasing, which is starting to stifle some demand.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually seeing that a bit in the market.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s new home builds that are coming online.</p>
<p>And at some point, there&rsquo;s going to be enough inventory coming online that there&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be enough supply and a decrease enough in demand that it will impact home prices.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s going to be in the next six months.</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s going to be more like 12 to 18 months, and I don&rsquo;t think that it</p>
<p>means that there&rsquo;s going to be a mass fall off like it was in the global financial crisis,</p>
<p>but it will slow down the price of which homes are growing up.</p>
<p>How much of this is just the, like, miscast housing policy that a lot of states and cities</p>
<p>have?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example of where I live.</p>
<p>I just got an email from our mayor, and basically what it said is like in the state of California</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;ve basically said you need to have a certain amount of housing density.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to build high rises because those aren&rsquo;t allowed.</p>
<p>Then they, you know, you allow these ADUs to get built that qualify.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all gamesmanship because as far as I can read it, the nimbyism of not wanting</p>
<p>to have high density homes, and that seems to be a very just American phenomenon.</p>
<p>Well, I actually think that it&rsquo;s a little bit that the markets just react slower.</p>
<p>Like this isn&rsquo;t, houses aren&rsquo;t equity markets.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just, you can&rsquo;t just buy and sell rapidly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I want to build an entire community of homes.</p>
<p>In five years, I&rsquo;m going to have to now plan in order to get the government licensing,</p>
<p>the regulation, the permits to actually build.</p>
<p>And so you see a problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, home prices are increasing.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like five years later, you can actually do something to actually impact it.</p>
<p>And by then the entire market has like completely changed.</p>
<p>I mean, Russia invaded Ukraine and COVID took over and there was a global pandemic.</p>
<p>And so I think the bigger issue is that the housing market can&rsquo;t react as quick to keep</p>
<p>up with public equity markets.</p>
<p>And a lot of that is because the government highly regulates the building of homes, which</p>
<p>takes a tremendous amount of time.</p>
<p>And especially right now where builders are like, I think that most builders miss their</p>
<p>Q1 numbers of how many houses they were actually going to build by almost 60%, which was mostly</p>
<p>supply chain.</p>
<p>So even when they rush it, a lot of other factors are impacting it.</p>
<p>And then what do you think about the, because I&rsquo;ve talked about this a little bit on the</p>
<p>pod, because it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really, I think, poorly understood, but important</p>
<p>in my opinion, where Fannie Mae and Freddie changed the upper bounds of mortgages where</p>
<p>they can be conforming now at like a million dollars, whereas before they used to be considered</p>
<p>jumbos.</p>
<p>And anyways, the reason I&rsquo;m asking this question is I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of financialization</p>
<p>and engineering here in the housing market that is poorly understood, that in some ways</p>
<p>tricks consumers to getting in a little bit over their ski tips.</p>
<p>And then in a moment like this, where rates rise, their job&rsquo;s a little bit more insecure,</p>
<p>this is when all of the parade of terribles happen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we just added a wonderful woman.</p>
<p>Her name is Kimberly Johnson.</p>
<p>That was actually our first independent.</p>
<p>She was the COO of Fannie Mae.</p>
<p>And I brought her on to fully understand as much of this as possible.</p>
<p>So the last time the government changed the underwriting criteria, it led to the global</p>
<p>financial crisis.</p>
<p>So if you ask them if they&rsquo;re really excited to do it another time, they&rsquo;re like, no, no.</p>
<p>We learned our lesson once.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say that they&rsquo;re actually, because they&rsquo;ve been under conservatorship, so most</p>
<p>of Fannie Mae&rsquo;s operations have been very dictated by the government, they&rsquo;re not actually</p>
<p>taking probably the level of risk that they should in this current market.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is if home prices go up by 30%, what actually qualifies as a</p>
<p>conventional mortgage needs to go up by 30%.</p>
<p>But that is such a massive change for government to make because they&rsquo;re so shell-shocked,</p>
<p>I think, from having made a change before and it having such a negative ripple effect.</p>
<p>So when I spoke to Kimberly, her response was, no, no, no, no, we&rsquo;re not here to start</p>
<p>making these changes to make it easier for consumers to get a home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your job.</p>
<p>You disrupt us.</p>
<p>You do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to take risk.</p>
<p>But they felt the government just felt like they still, like I, they felt like that was</p>
<p>just a natural change that had to happen.</p>
<p>Raising the amount.</p>
<p>The upper bound cap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, of course.</p>
<p>Everyone is.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s actually even crazier is I&rsquo;m waiting for them to actually raise the debt to income</p>
<p>ratio because of what I showed you earlier, which is if your income is not increasing</p>
<p>and mortgage rates are going up and home values are going up, you now need to spend a larger</p>
<p>percentage of your income on housing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a massive change.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lending change.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that up to the individual banks?</p>
<p>They could change.</p>
<p>They put overlays on top of Fannie Mae&rsquo;s requirements, but Fannie Mae, because they actually put,</p>
<p>so when the global financial crisis happened, there were such a very high fees and penalties</p>
<p>that went for banks that didn&rsquo;t have really strict overlays that actually had a ton of</p>
<p>defaults.</p>
<p>And so now banks are super nervous to lend to people and actually take risk that they</p>
<p>actually follow Fannie Mae&rsquo;s guidelines very strictly and actually put overlays on top</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>So they are more conservative a lot of times than what the underwriting requirements are.</p>
<p>And so in order for them to actually start to take risk, I think Fannie Mae would have</p>
<p>to encourage it and they&rsquo;d have to do it in such a way that they don&rsquo;t penalize.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had Bill Gurley and Brad Gershner on, I don&rsquo;t know if you saw that panel.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t hear about it, no.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you did see it or not?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of assets being inflated from used cars to NFTs and everything in between.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve now seen compression, and we talked about this on the pod, in every single sector.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Except housing.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re all sitting here wondering, what are the chances that housing collapses?</p>
<p>I was talking to my pal Palmer backstage, my new bestie.</p>
<p>Suddenly we went backstage and-</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ruin it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ruin it.</p>
<p>No, we just sat there and we had a great conversation about 10 different things, it was pretty interesting.</p>
<p>So what are the chances, and we were talking about the chances of a collapse, he said,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s 30% chance this real estate collapse, we were watching your talk, 30% chance maybe</p>
<p>the real estate market collapses.</p>
<p>What are the chances in your mind being so close to it that we will see housing collapse</p>
<p>and this be a bubble?</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s no question that housing growth is going to slow down.</p>
<p>If you look at-</p>
<p>Slow down, but I&rsquo;m asking you, chances of a collapse.</p>
<p>You mean pricing?</p>
<p>Pricing.</p>
<p>New homes.</p>
<p>Pricing.</p>
<p>Yes, pricing.</p>
<p>The growth will slow.</p>
<p>Now, whether it goes negative or not, I think it&rsquo;s more a matter of what the economy does</p>
<p>over the next 24 months.</p>
<p>But I actually think that what we will definitively see, which we have seen, I&rsquo;d say in the last</p>
<p>two weeks we&rsquo;ve seen, a slowdown in the rate of growth for homes.</p>
<p>Now, the global financial crisis was very different than what we&rsquo;re seeing today.</p>
<p>And if you- Bottom of the stock market for the global financial crisis, 3909.</p>
<p>Bottom of housing prices, June of 2012, three years later.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the housing market moves so slowly compared to the equities market.</p>
<p>And so it is not surprising that housing is going to be the last thing that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>actually start to compress in terms of value.</p>
<p>People live there for a while.</p>
<p>They can afford their mortgages.</p>
<p>Then their income drops.</p>
<p>Then they can&rsquo;t afford their mortgages.</p>
<p>Then they get foreclosed.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s six months later.</p>
<p>Yeah, but also like you see the stock market drop and you&rsquo;re like, I should sell my home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to take 30 days.</p>
<p>Then I have to find someone.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s going to take another 30 days.</p>
<p>Oh, then I have to wait until they move in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another 30 days.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s three months before you can like make a trade.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t log on to your Robinhood account and be like, yeah, no, the market&rsquo;s sinking.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get rid of our house.</p>
<p>Can I shift the conversation for a second?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a founder of a unicorn.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the big round.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Timed it right.</p>
<p>So, well, this is what I was just going to ask you.</p>
<p>Can you talk to us about your mindset in this moment now in terms of your valuation, in</p>
<p>terms of your cash, in terms of your burn, in terms of your employees?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sort of front of mind?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Same, different.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, so we raised a $200 million round from Tiger.</p>
<p>It was preempted back about six months ago or maybe even nine months ago at this point.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s actually interesting because I listened to you guys on the pod,</p>
<p>the besties.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, for me as a founder, when I was going through that moment, I was</p>
<p>like, well, shit, man, it&rsquo;s a Black Friday sale.</p>
<p>Like I can raise a ton of cash.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting preempted left and right.</p>
<p>And so I actually think that founders, like obviously I should have played the game that</p>
<p>I played, which is like, why wouldn&rsquo;t I raise a ton of capital and take less dilution?</p>
<p>There was nothing that was the right chess move at that point in time.</p>
<p>And now kind of to your point, and by the way, it&rsquo;s not founder&rsquo;s fault that the market</p>
<p>got overheated.</p>
<p>You guys gave us the turn.</p>
<p>No, you did the rational thing.</p>
<p>By the way, don&rsquo;t point at me.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You did the rational thing.</p>
<p>Rational.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>And so, but now, now you have to just, now I&rsquo;d say, look, Divi, we make, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t probably put it out there, but hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.</p>
<p>I burn less than, I don&rsquo;t know, 5 to 10 million a month, so less than 5 million a month.</p>
<p>We have 300 employees.</p>
<p>And do I think you have to be conservative?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do I think you had to be conservative along the entire way of building a company?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Every second.</p>
<p>I thought my company can die at any moment, right?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>And I run my company like that.</p>
<p>My employees joke, they&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re the most frugal person ever.</p>
<p>Like every single time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>We need to spend on this.</p>
<p>I want to invest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah.</p>
<p>I want to invest in the Tiger Rambler.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Do you rely on your late stage investors in moments like this to like help you navigate</p>
<p>or how do you do it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do you rely on your early stage?</p>
<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t think you rely on investors ever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t mean that offensively.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I think that some investors are great, but no one&rsquo;s building this company with you.</p>
<p>I am building this company.</p>
<p>With my employees.</p>
<p>But ain&rsquo;t nobody else there with me.</p>
<p>And so when times get tough, it is on you to make sure you can have a path to cashflow</p>
<p>profitability if you can actually raise another round of capital, but you try to support your</p>
<p>employees and work together to kind of weather through this.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t expect any of my investors to show up with a Hail Mary.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s on me to run a really strong, profitable business.</p>
<p>So any changes from June to now or not really?</p>
<p>Just kind of stay the course, get to the cashflow break even?</p>
<p>Like meaning nothing to accelerate it or?</p>
<p>So I think we plan out a bunch of different cases.</p>
<p>So we always have the base case, target case, and then what I call the off ramp, which is</p>
<p>go cashflow positive.</p>
<p>And every week my CFO, COO, and I get on a call and we just say, how&rsquo;s the market doing?</p>
<p>How do we feel?</p>
<p>Do we want to switch from our base to our target case?</p>
<p>Do we want to go down the off ramp path?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>This week feels the same.</p>
<p>The All In podcast didn&rsquo;t change our sentiment and we continue on, on Monday morning as planned.</p>
<p>The All In sentiment index, I like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to have you here.</p>
<p>And I had had you on my podcast earlier and I had told you like, God, I thought this was</p>
<p>going to be the most boring podcast and it was one of the best of the year.</p>
<p>You are-</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a compliment or an insult.</p>
<p>Tell us how you really feel.</p>
<p>No, it was like a boring topic.</p>
<p>No, but again, please tell us how you really feel.</p>
<p>It was like a really boring topic, but a great guest and you made it really, really, um,</p>
<p>really educational.</p>
<p>I think the audience-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still fully on tilt right now.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I do have-</p>
<p>Jason, Jason, Jason, day one.</p>
<p>I do have, as we&rsquo;re heading towards ending, I do have an intro.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Because I thought we were all going to get-</p>
<p>Fredenberg tried this.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work so well for him.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I thought we were all going to get-</p>
<p>We like my intro.</p>
<p>Intros.</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Fredenberg&rsquo;s mom, everybody.</p>
<p>So I made myself an intro.</p>
<p>All right, go ahead.</p>
<p>Give your intro and then we&rsquo;ll wrap.</p>
<p>Which I feel like I should give, which is, um, all right, y&rsquo;all ready for it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in Miami chilling with the besties on this stage in a minefield of testies.</p>
<p>J. Cal kindly invited me to share my passion, so here goes in true all-in fashion.</p>
<p>I play the housing long game as the stock market will jitter, but solving inequality</p>
<p>is less flashy than almost buying Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the rent-to-own leader in the prop tech arena.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to reintroduce myself.</p>
<p>My name is Adina.</p>
<p>Nicely done, Adina.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>That was awesome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
