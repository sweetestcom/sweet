    <p>Our card this week is Cassandra Jones, the Queen of Clubs from Kansas.</p>
<p>In 1998, 20-year-old Cassandra vanished from the home</p>
<p>that she and her mother shared in Wichita, Kansas,</p>
<p>only to be found months later, her body discarded on the side of the road.</p>
<p>For the past two decades, investigators have thrown everything they can think of</p>
<p>at her case, trying to untangle the twisted web of mysteries</p>
<p>that her killer left behind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was nearly 5 p.m. on March 31st, 1999, and a couple who we&rsquo;ll call David and Melissa</p>
<p>were out driving in rural Sedgwick County, Kansas.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t too far out in the boonies, like they were just a few miles north of Wichita,</p>
<p>but it certainly felt like they were far removed from civilization because they were on a dirt</p>
<p>road surrounded by nothing but fields and long lines of trees.</p>
<p>So bladder full, David decided this would be a good place to get out and use the restroom.</p>
<p>He and Melissa just pulled over to the side of the road where there was a break in the</p>
<p>mile-long row of trees and hedges.</p>
<p>David hopped out of the car, and then he saw something that made him freeze.</p>
<p>In front of him, lying beside the hedgerow, was what appeared to be a severely decomposed</p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>David quickly jumped back in the car and feverishly drove a few miles up the road to the nearest</p>
<p>city, Park City, while he told Melissa what he had found.</p>
<p>When they arrived, they were able to find a deputy on duty to follow them back to the scene.</p>
<p>There was no question about what David had found, and to the deputy&rsquo;s trained eye, it</p>
<p>looked like the person had some kind of trauma to the head.</p>
<p>So the deputy radioed for backup right away.</p>
<p>Mary Mattingly, who was a detective with the Sedgwick County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at the time,</p>
<p>heard the call go out over the radio and responded to the scene, which was already swarming with</p>
<p>other officers by the time she arrived.</p>
<p>There was what appeared to be a body in various states of decomp.</p>
<p>You could absolutely tell it had been there for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Investigators could tell the deceased was a woman, and she appeared to be in her late</p>
<p>teens or early 20s, but that&rsquo;s all they could determine, because the woman didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>form of identification on her.</p>
<p>Authorities sent the body off to the coroner&rsquo;s office, where it was quickly determined that</p>
<p>her cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head.</p>
<p>And from the position of the wound, it was clearly a homicide.</p>
<p>As the coroner&rsquo;s office worked on completing the official autopsy, investigators worked</p>
<p>through the night, some thumbing through local missing persons reports, trying to identify</p>
<p>their victim, and others processing the scene.</p>
<p>Authorities quickly decided that the woman likely hadn&rsquo;t been killed at that location,</p>
<p>on the side of the road, tucked away in the hedgerow.</p>
<p>It was just where she&rsquo;d been left.</p>
<p>Matthew Lynch said it&rsquo;s not uncommon to see body dumps out that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just agriculture out there.</p>
<p>But we see, we have seen over the years, more than one body get dumped out that way.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re only five, six miles out of the city, and you&rsquo;re even less off of a paved</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>But it gets pretty dark up there, and you get, you don&rsquo;t have to, you cross one highway,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re kind of, in their mind, they&rsquo;re in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, investigators searched the area where her body was found thoroughly, just</p>
<p>in case the killer left behind any clues.</p>
<p>They scoured the hedgerow, went through the grass with a fine-toothed comb, they even</p>
<p>created a grid around where the body was found, and started digging up the soil.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when they found something.</p>
<p>Several inches below the ground, they discovered a couple of shell casings.</p>
<p>Because the casings were so deep in the soil, investigators felt like they weren&rsquo;t connected</p>
<p>to the woman&rsquo;s death, but they collected them as evidence anyway.</p>
<p>Anything&rsquo;s possible, but the placement of where she was located, where they were found,</p>
<p>the biggest way to say this, it was not in her head.</p>
<p>It was significant depth beneath where her body was recovered.</p>
<p>It was taking somebody to dig through, dig up all this stuff, and sift through it and</p>
<p>find those.</p>
<p>So likely they had been there for a while.</p>
<p>Once the scene was processed, investigators interviewed the only two people connected</p>
<p>to the case so far, David and Melissa.</p>
<p>Literally, this is what I interviewed him and the female, and they both said that consistent</p>
<p>story.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we were doing.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a reason to believe, obviously, that they were involved in that, but you obviously</p>
<p>interview go through that way, and they were immediately off the list, so to speak.</p>
<p>With David and Melissa decidedly off the list of potential suspects, there wasn&rsquo;t much</p>
<p>more investigators could do until they knew the woman&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>So to help the coroner&rsquo;s work along, authorities used a local media to get the word out about</p>
<p>their Jane Doe.</p>
<p>But before they even got any calls, the coroner&rsquo;s office came through.</p>
<p>Even though the woman&rsquo;s body was badly decomposed, they were able to rehydrate her thumb and</p>
<p>get a fingerprint, which they matched to a 20-year-old woman named Cassandra Jones.</p>
<p>But the timing of all this was just so tight.</p>
<p>Before authorities could even pick up the phone to notify her family, her family had</p>
<p>seen the news broadcast and had called them.</p>
<p>Said, hey, my sister&rsquo;s daughter has been gone.</p>
<p>She hasn&rsquo;t been able to find her in a while.</p>
<p>She thinks maybe this is her daughter and wants to come talk to you.</p>
<p>The caller sent her sister, Brenda Jones, to the sheriff&rsquo;s office to talk with investigators.</p>
<p>Brenda told them that her daughter, Cassandra Jones, had been missing for more than three</p>
<p>months since the middle of December, and she feared that the woman found was her daughter.</p>
<p>Investigators broke the gut-wrenching news to Brenda.</p>
<p>She was right.</p>
<p>It was her baby girl.</p>
<p>After giving Brenda a little time to process everything, they jumped right into interviewing</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>They wanted to know everything they possibly could about Cassandra, who she was, what she</p>
<p>was going through, what was going on in her life, anything that could lead them to more</p>
<p>people to interview or to potential suspects.</p>
<p>They realized that there would be a lot of people they needed to speak with because Brenda</p>
<p>told investigators that her daughter lived a high-risk lifestyle.</p>
<p>Her mom said that at the time that she was 20 years old, it wasn&rsquo;t unusual for her to</p>
<p>maybe disappear for a couple days, maybe a week or two.</p>
<p>She would have issues with her mom.</p>
<p>Her mom didn&rsquo;t approve of some of her lifestyle.</p>
<p>Her mom said she was a dancer, said that she, her daughter had worked as a dancer at Wild</p>
<p>Cherries.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t 100% but thought that she had perhaps worked for some kind of escort services</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>She was involved in some activities that would, could lend herself to be in that delicate</p>
<p>position or a dangerous position.</p>
<p>But more than all of that, there was something else, or someone else, that concerned Brenda.</p>
<p>Cassandra&rsquo;s on-again, off-again boyfriend, a 27-year-old man named Sinclair Duncan.</p>
<p>Sinclair had a criminal record and Brenda expressed that he might have had abusive tendencies</p>
<p>toward Cassandra.</p>
<p>Brenda said that their relationship had gotten pretty serious at one point and Cassandra</p>
<p>had been living with him just until recently when she moved back in with Brenda and started</p>
<p>trying to get her life back together.</p>
<p>She got her GED and CNA certificate and was even attending classes at a local business</p>
<p>school which she was set to finish that very year.</p>
<p>Brenda was devastated when she disappeared, but mostly because she thought she&rsquo;d just</p>
<p>fallen back into her old life, not that anything like this had happened.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t report her missing because of her daughter.</p>
<p>She said, well, she&rsquo;s 20 years old, she&rsquo;s an adult.</p>
<p>Now that Brenda did know what happened to her daughter, she said she regretted that</p>
<p>decision more than anything.</p>
<p>Brenda told the investigators that the last time she saw Cassandra was in the middle of</p>
<p>December 1998.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint an exact date because it was just a normal day when she was leaving</p>
<p>their shared apartment.</p>
<p>The best she could pinpoint at the time was that it was between December 13th and December</p>
<p>15th.</p>
<p>After that, she never saw or heard from her again.</p>
<p>Brenda recounted to police what her daughter was wearing the last time she saw her.</p>
<p>Sergeant Lynch didn&rsquo;t want to describe the clothing to protect the integrity of the investigation</p>
<p>because the clothing that Brenda described actually matched exactly what Cassandra was</p>
<p>wearing when she was found dead, which to police meant that she had likely died the</p>
<p>same day Brenda last saw her.</p>
<p>And Brenda had even more valuable information to add.</p>
<p>She told them that a few weeks after her daughter vanished, she got a call that Cassandra&rsquo;s</p>
<p>car had been found abandoned in the north central area of Wichita.</p>
<p>It was at some old abandoned home, and she was asked to come collect it.</p>
<p>When she picked the car up, she noticed that the passenger window was broken.</p>
<p>Brenda said that when she found the car, she became worried about her daughter, and so</p>
<p>she went right to the one person she felt would have answers.</p>
<p>In her words, she went and confronted the on-again, off-again boyfriend, would say,</p>
<p>where is she?</p>
<p>What have you done?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear what all was said during the confrontation between Brenda and Sinclair,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t yield the answers Brenda was looking for, and she remained in the dark</p>
<p>about her daughter&rsquo;s whereabouts until today, when she was sitting in front of investigators.</p>
<p>After speaking with Brenda, police began tracking down some of Cassandra&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>and other people who might have had information, and everyone they spoke to seemed to paint</p>
<p>the same unsavory picture of Sinclair, that he was controlling and violent.</p>
<p>One story investigators heard was that once, Sinclair got so angry at Cassandra that he</p>
<p>stole her car keys and wouldn&rsquo;t let her leave his house.</p>
<p>Another story they heard was even more concerning.</p>
<p>People said Sinclair once pulled out a gun and shot at Cassandra and someone that she</p>
<p>was hanging out with.</p>
<p>Now, no one was sure if he was shooting at Cassandra or the person she was with, but</p>
<p>either way, there was a police report for that incident, so investigators knew it was</p>
<p>more than just a rumor.</p>
<p>And that was far from the only police report that the authorities had with Sinclair&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>He had a criminal history, including a 1992 arrest for aggravated robbery involving a</p>
<p>firearm.</p>
<p>And beyond that, he was a known gang member.</p>
<p>They had a feeling that it&rsquo;d be difficult to get Sinclair to talk, but they tracked him</p>
<p>down and tried anyway.</p>
<p>It was a week after Cassandra&rsquo;s body was found, April 6th, when police finally sat</p>
<p>down with him for an interview.</p>
<p>He came up voluntarily, and I would say his interview, he had a very flat affect.</p>
<p>Said that, you know, he loved her, they were on again, they were off again, he had no idea</p>
<p>what happened.</p>
<p>Sinclair told investigators that even though he and Cassandra had broken up or were in</p>
<p>one of their off periods, she would still braid his hair every three to four weeks,</p>
<p>which kind of made it seem like there weren&rsquo;t really hard feelings between the two of them.</p>
<p>He said that the last time he saw her was on either the 11th or the 12th of December.</p>
<p>She had moved out of his house not too long before that.</p>
<p>And for some reason, when she moved out, she took his stereo equipment with her.</p>
<p>So Sinclair said that he went over to Brenda&rsquo;s place to pick it up.</p>
<p>And he said that was that.</p>
<p>He never saw her again.</p>
<p>But something about the way Sinclair was acting during the interview, his flat, emotionless</p>
<p>tone, it just rubbed investigators the wrong way.</p>
<p>And that, tied with the fact that as far as they knew, he had expressed no concern to</p>
<p>anyone when Cassandra was missing for more than three months, made him seem more than</p>
<p>suspicious.</p>
<p>So before they let him go, they asked him to come back in for a polygraph.</p>
<p>To their surprise, he agreed.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t going to be that easy.</p>
<p>When police tried to get one set up, he told them that he had changed his mind, which you</p>
<p>all know, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with declining to take a polygraph.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason they&rsquo;re not admissible in court.</p>
<p>But initially agreeing and then suddenly changing your mind, that&rsquo;s what seemed suspicious.</p>
<p>Not long after talking with Sinclair, detectives spoke with a good friend of Cassandra&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who we&rsquo;ll call Alice, and who police would soon learn was one of the last people to see</p>
<p>Cassandra alive.</p>
<p>Alice said that the last time she saw Cassandra was on December 13th.</p>
<p>She and Cassandra went to a Dollar General together at around 3 p.m. that day, but Cassandra</p>
<p>got a headache and said that she just wanted to go home.</p>
<p>So they both went back to Brenda&rsquo;s apartment together.</p>
<p>And when they got there, Cassandra got a call from Sinclair.</p>
<p>Alice said that Sinclair was asking Cassandra to come over and braid his hair.</p>
<p>After that phone call, Alice and Cassandra parted ways.</p>
<p>She said that she didn&rsquo;t hear from or see Cassandra after that.</p>
<p>Though she did try calling Cassandra, but she could never get a hold of her.</p>
<p>And now she knew why.</p>
<p>If Cassandra actually did go over to braid Sinclair&rsquo;s hair after that phone call, then</p>
<p>it seemed like he was probably the last person to see her alive, which would be pretty damning</p>
<p>for someone who was already the focus of everyone&rsquo;s suspicion.</p>
<p>After that discussion with Alice, investigators went over and searched Brenda&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>And sure enough, they found evidence that Cassandra had been on her way to do someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hair shortly before she dropped off the radar.</p>
<p>She had a certain routine that she followed when she was going to braid someone&rsquo;s hair</p>
<p>or do someone&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>And she had followed that routine right up to the point when we don&rsquo;t have anybody have</p>
<p>any contact with her.</p>
<p>Sergeant Lynch didn&rsquo;t want to elaborate on what that routine was.</p>
<p>He said that it could be something that comes up later in the investigation.</p>
<p>But it was the proof they were looking for that Cassandra&rsquo;s last move was likely going</p>
<p>to braid someone&rsquo;s hair, and that someone seemed like it was Sinclair.</p>
<p>Investigators would have loved to sit down with Sinclair again and have a lengthy conversation</p>
<p>about that last contact with her now that they knew more.</p>
<p>But Sinclair requested that all contact go through his attorney, which very much limited</p>
<p>their contact with him going forward.</p>
<p>Now that limited contact didn&rsquo;t stop investigators from learning more about him and growing even</p>
<p>more suspicious.</p>
<p>As time went on, there were facts or things that he told us we were able to disprove.</p>
<p>Simple things like he said he was evicted from the apartment where they lived.</p>
<p>He said he was evicted because he didn&rsquo;t pay his rent.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t evicted.</p>
<p>He had paid the rent.</p>
<p>So just simple things like that that we&rsquo;re able to start going through and saying this</p>
<p>is, this is not factual information, which can seem minuscule, I realize, but when you</p>
<p>have a whole lot of those things that you&rsquo;re able to put holes in, they start to add up.</p>
<p>Since Sinclair wasn&rsquo;t really wanting to talk with police at this point, they decided to</p>
<p>take another route that they hadn&rsquo;t looked at before.</p>
<p>Brenda&rsquo;s landline phone records.</p>
<p>The records indicated that Sinclair had called Brenda&rsquo;s house four times the day Alice last</p>
<p>saw Cassandra, December 13th, which of course corroborated Alice&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t all the phone records showed.</p>
<p>Apparently, December 13th was the last day he called.</p>
<p>Like ever, Sinclair didn&rsquo;t call Brenda&rsquo;s home ever again.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what bugs me.</p>
<p>Remember, in his interview with police, Sinclair mentioned that Cassandra braided his hair</p>
<p>every three to four weeks.</p>
<p>So why didn&rsquo;t he try to call up Cassandra at Brenda&rsquo;s house again in the three plus</p>
<p>months that she was missing?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s at least three missed hair appointments.</p>
<p>To me, it seems like the only reason he wouldn&rsquo;t reach out is if he knew she wouldn&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to answer, if he knew something had happened to her.</p>
<p>As the days passed by, investigators continued talking to Cassandra&rsquo;s friends and acquaintances,</p>
<p>and they started piecing together an even shadier picture of Sinclair.</p>
<p>Like that he was more than abusive and manipulative.</p>
<p>He was exploiting Cassandra.</p>
<p>More than one person, more than one source said he was involved in drugs, in prostitution,</p>
<p>and would utilize her to sell some of those things, whether it&rsquo;s herself or drugs.</p>
<p>I would say she was probably a victim of human trafficking before we even knew what that</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you about my best description on that.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just what friends were saying that pointed toward Cassandra being a victim of</p>
<p>human trafficking.</p>
<p>There was an incident that happened a year before Cassandra disappeared that now, on</p>
<p>the other side of things, was raising some red flags.</p>
<p>In November of 1997, Cassandra was arrested during a traffic stop for possession of drugs</p>
<p>and carrying a concealed weapon.</p>
<p>According to the police reports, guess who was in her passenger seat?</p>
<p>Sinclair.</p>
<p>Sergeant Lynch and former detective Mattingly said that they now would guess the drugs and</p>
<p>firearm were actually Sinclair&rsquo;s, but he handed them off to Cassandra last minute so</p>
<p>she would take the fall.</p>
<p>Lynch and Mattingly agreed that this screams trafficking because this kind of thing is</p>
<p>something that they see often with victims.</p>
<p>The trafficker gets caught or fears getting caught and pins it all on their victim.</p>
<p>As police continue talking with Cassandra&rsquo;s loved ones, they didn&rsquo;t just learn more about</p>
<p>Sinclair and his abusive relationship with Cassandra.</p>
<p>They also learned about a possible motive.</p>
<p>Detectives heard that shortly before she disappeared, Cassandra got into a relationship with a new</p>
<p>man who we&rsquo;ve been asked to call Larry.</p>
<p>There were some stories about him and her, Cassandra, taking his money, taking his dope,</p>
<p>taking whatever, doing something that would be disrespectful, which he would not be able</p>
<p>to tolerate and in order to maintain your standing or his standing would have to address</p>
<p>the problem.</p>
<p>Since Sinclair didn&rsquo;t want to talk with police anymore, investigators wanted to find Larry</p>
<p>and have a chat with him, not only to address the rumors, but also to see if maybe he was</p>
<p>a potential person of interest.</p>
<p>It took them a while to track him down because, as they&rsquo;d soon find out, Larry actually went</p>
<p>by his middle name.</p>
<p>But once they found him, he agreed to sit down for an interview.</p>
<p>He was cooperative when we interviewed him.</p>
<p>I would say exhausted everything we could and we were able to say everything he said</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been able to validate and he just wasn&rsquo;t a viable suspect then.</p>
<p>Just based on where he was, what he was doing, going back that time frame and everything</p>
<p>we could verify that he was telling us.</p>
<p>After talking with Larry, investigators had another name scratched off the potential suspect</p>
<p>list and they were still unable to confirm or deny the rumors floating around.</p>
<p>And although everything they uncovered seemed to point right back to Sinclair, they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to get tunnel vision for him.</p>
<p>So they kept working the case, trying to identify other possible persons of interest and people</p>
<p>that they thought might know something.</p>
<p>And it was actually Brenda that had the name of someone they should talk to, someone who</p>
<p>said something weird to her.</p>
<p>Brenda said that Cassandra had a friend named Shelly.</p>
<p>And after Shelly heard Cassandra&rsquo;s body had been found, she asked Brenda if she got</p>
<p>that grand-am back.</p>
<p>Now for good reason, this struck Brenda as odd.</p>
<p>How did Shelly know that there was a period of time after Cassandra disappeared that her</p>
<p>car was missing too?</p>
<p>Police also found Shelly&rsquo;s comments suspicious, so they asked her to come to the station for</p>
<p>an interview.</p>
<p>She agreed, and her interaction with investigators would only leave them scratching their heads</p>
<p>even more.</p>
<p>She was in the back of my car because I was driving her up here with another detective.</p>
<p>What she said in the car, well, this, this, and this happened and I found out on this</p>
<p>date.</p>
<p>When we went in to interview her 30 minutes later up here, it was not the same story at</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>And when you go back and would say what I would say, well Shelly, this is what you said</p>
<p>on the way up here.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I meant, you know, this.</p>
<p>And some of that seems kind of like it isn&rsquo;t anything like a big deal, kind of innocuous,</p>
<p>but it just again goes to show why are you changing the story now?</p>
<p>Is it relevant?</p>
<p>How is it relevant?</p>
<p>It seemed like Shelly knew more than she was letting on, but she said that she was scared</p>
<p>and therefore wasn&rsquo;t giving them much information.</p>
<p>And since they had no evidence that she was involved, they had to let her go.</p>
<p>Although investigators knew that there were people close to the case who had the answers</p>
<p>they needed, no one was willing to come clean.</p>
<p>And the investigation was losing steam fast.</p>
<p>Months passed with no new tips, no tangible leads to follow.</p>
<p>But investigators hadn&rsquo;t given up.</p>
<p>They were still actively searching for the scene of the crime because remember, they</p>
<p>had no reason to believe that Cassandra was killed on the side of the road where she was</p>
<p>found.</p>
<p>They thought that she was killed somewhere else and then just dumped there.</p>
<p>So investigators were processing every location they could think of for evidence of the murder.</p>
<p>They examined Cassandra&rsquo;s Grand Am and other cars that they thought could be connected</p>
<p>to the crime, but they didn&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>Toward the end of 1999, they even got a search warrant for Sinclair&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t find any evidence of Cassandra&rsquo;s murder there, but they did find drugs and</p>
<p>a gun that he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to have as a convicted felon, so he was charged for both</p>
<p>of those.</p>
<p>After that, Cassandra&rsquo;s case went cold, but it wouldn&rsquo;t stay that way.</p>
<p>My sources for this episode are a bit unclear about when this happened, but a few years</p>
<p>later the sheriff&rsquo;s office got a call from a kid in a juvenile detention facility.</p>
<p>He wanted to talk about a crime that he had knowledge of.</p>
<p>He said that his cousin, who we&rsquo;ve been asked to refer to as L.W., L.W. knew what</p>
<p>happened to Cassandra Jones.</p>
<p>The kid said that a guy named Sinclair told L.W. that he had, quote-unquote, taken care</p>
<p>of Cassandra.</p>
<p>But he said that L.W. was too scared of Sinclair to go to authorities.</p>
<p>So armed with the tip, investigators tracked down and spoke with L.W., but he wasn&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>forthcoming as his young cousin.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from that L.W.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have shit to do with it, you people can&rsquo;t put shit on me.</p>
<p>L.W. wasn&rsquo;t cooperating, but he wasn&rsquo;t the only person who seemed to know more than</p>
<p>he was letting on.</p>
<p>There was someone else, someone entirely unrelated to the tip from L.W.&rsquo;s cousin, an unnamed</p>
<p>friend of Sinclair&rsquo;s who investigators spoke to.</p>
<p>After talking to him, they were confident that he also held some of the answers that</p>
<p>they were looking for.</p>
<p>He just really seemed like there was a heavy weight.</p>
<p>So we, you know, you continue to talk to him thinking maybe he would share that.</p>
<p>He would kind of infer and say, well, you know, well, there was this and just, you could</p>
<p>just see something&rsquo;s weighing heavy on him.</p>
<p>We asked him, he goes, yeah, something is, but I&rsquo;m not there yet.</p>
<p>But that friend would never get there, to the point that he was ready to come clean</p>
<p>about what he knew, because after that interaction with detectives, he refused to speak with</p>
<p>them again.</p>
<p>Mattingly, who&rsquo;s now retired, said that has been the reoccurring theme of this investigation.</p>
<p>Lots of people know what happened, whether they heard it through the grapevine or were</p>
<p>actually there when it occurred, but no one is willing to talk about it and be the so-called</p>
<p>snitch.</p>
<p>Any of the witnesses, the people that knew Cassandra, that hung around with her, were</p>
<p>gang related or they either had ties or they were gang members, which was another huge</p>
<p>challenge because they were not interested in talking to me or anyone else about anything</p>
<p>that happened.</p>
<p>Because no one is willing to talk, Cassandra&rsquo;s mom, Brenda, has been left to pick up the</p>
<p>pieces without any closure.</p>
<p>In November 2022, she did an interview with a local broadcast, Channel 12 News, and she</p>
<p>spoke about the loss of her only child.</p>
<p>She said, quote,</p>
<p>It was my worst nightmare.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t deserve that.</p>
<p>No one deserves that.</p>
<p>She,</p>
<p>It was just the worst day of my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still the worst day of my life.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Mattingly told our reporting team that Brenda believes she knows who killed her daughter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you that her mom believes the same thing I do as far as who&rsquo;s responsible</p>
<p>for her death.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether he personally did that or had somebody with him do it, he&rsquo;s responsible.</p>
<p>Within the Sedgwick County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, there are two theories about what happened</p>
<p>to Cassandra.</p>
<p>Mattingly thinks there&rsquo;s some validity to the rumor that Cassandra stole drugs and money</p>
<p>from Sinclair at the request of her new man, Larry.</p>
<p>He knew it was them and her particularly and said, can&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>And I believe that that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s dead is because he had to keep up that street cred,</p>
<p>I guess, for lack of a better term, to say, don&rsquo;t mess with me.</p>
<p>This is what happens.</p>
<p>However, others like Sergeant Lynch disagree with the theory.</p>
<p>I have a tough time with the whole dope or money rip thing only because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s unlike</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see this with her on other things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see her.</p>
<p>Hell, we don&rsquo;t even see her shoplifting.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, we don&rsquo;t have those kinds of crimes with her.</p>
<p>Sergeant Lynch thinks Sinclair simply didn&rsquo;t like the fact that Cassandra had left him</p>
<p>and was getting her life together and slipping away from his control.</p>
<p>So he killed her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say now if he would come in and take a polygraph, that&rsquo;d be a great place to start.</p>
<p>Maybe he would pass it with flying colors, I don&rsquo;t know, which I realize isn&rsquo;t admissible,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still something to start with because for someone that said he wasn&rsquo;t involved,</p>
<p>he loved her so much, she doesn&rsquo;t deserve that, but he&rsquo;s not willing to cooperate and</p>
<p>never has cooperated ever since the first time we interviewed him.</p>
<p>Even though Mattingly is retired, she still wants nothing more than to solve this case</p>
<p>for Brenda.</p>
<p>If I could do one thing in my life, I would like it to be to get some closure for her</p>
<p>because she still doesn&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>Brenda has waited more than 20 years for closure.</p>
<p>There are so many people out there who know something or who know a piece of something</p>
<p>that could help investigators close the case for good.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s you, if you know anything about the murder of Cassandra Jones, please contact</p>
<p>the Sedgwick County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 316-660-3799, or you can email them at coldcaseatsedgwick.gov.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have all this information in the show notes.</p>
