    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk about science-based protocols</p>
<p>for sleep, mood, learning, nutrition,</p>
<p>exercise of various kinds,</p>
<p>strength and endurance, and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And we are going to talk about some protocols</p>
<p>that relate to creativity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about behavioral protocols,</p>
<p>supplement-based protocols,</p>
<p>all science backed by quality peer-reviewed literature.</p>
<p>The reason that we&rsquo;re holding this episode now</p>
<p>is that in the recent previous episodes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve covered some pretty intense and in-depth topics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about vision and how we see</p>
<p>and how to get better at seeing and how to maintain vision.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about hearing and balance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about chemical sensing,</p>
<p>and we had a guest episode</p>
<p>that covered a lot of information</p>
<p>about new and emerging technologies in neuroscience</p>
<p>as well as mental health.</p>
<p>That was the interview episode with Dr. Karl Deisseroth.</p>
<p>So given that we&rsquo;ve covered so much detailed information</p>
<p>in the previous 27 episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>I decided that we would hold office hours.</p>
<p>Office hours in the university setting</p>
<p>are when students come to the professor&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>or you meet outdoors on campus or in the classroom</p>
<p>to review the material and questions from lecture</p>
<p>in more detail.</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have the opportunity</p>
<p>to meet face-to-face in real life,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, you&rsquo;ve been sending your questions,</p>
<p>putting them in the comment section on YouTube, et cetera,</p>
<p>and I prepared a number of answers to the questions</p>
<p>that have shown up most frequently.</p>
<p>Now, in order to provide context and structure</p>
<p>to the way that we will address these questions,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve arranged the science and science-based protocols</p>
<p>that relate to various aspects of life,</p>
<p>such as mood, exercise, sleep, waking, anxiety,</p>
<p>creativity, et cetera, into the context of a day.</p>
<p>Selecting the unit of a day</p>
<p>in order to deliver this science information and protocols</p>
<p>is not a haphazard decision on my part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the case that every cell in our body,</p>
<p>every organ in our body, and our brain</p>
<p>is modulated or changes across the 24-hour day</p>
<p>in a very regular and predictable rhythm.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no coincidence that the earth</p>
<p>spins once on its axis every 24 hours.</p>
<p>These two things are coordinated by virtue of genes</p>
<p>and different proteins and things that are expressed</p>
<p>in every cell of your body.</p>
<p>And so selecting the unit of the day</p>
<p>is not just a practical one,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s related to our deeper biology.</p>
<p>You may have heard in my interview episode</p>
<p>with Dr. Karl Deisseroth that he himself,</p>
<p>in order to juggle a tremendous workload,</p>
<p>a full-time clinical practice, a lab of 40-plus people,</p>
<p>a family of five children, et cetera,</p>
<p>breaks up his life into units of days.</p>
<p>And so today we are going to further dissect the day</p>
<p>as a unit that one can manage and manage extremely well,</p>
<p>and in fact, can optimize.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re basically going to talk about</p>
<p>how to leverage science-based protocols.</p>
<p>And when I say science, I mean quality,</p>
<p>peer-reviewed science published in excellent journals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about how to take that science,</p>
<p>convert it into specific protocols</p>
<p>that break up along the course of a single day</p>
<p>and direct certain types of behaviors</p>
<p>in order to optimize the various features of life.</p>
<p>I will couch this in the context of what I do</p>
<p>across a daily 24-hour rhythm.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to follow this schedule</p>
<p>at all, or even in part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just by way of example.</p>
<p>Any number of the different things that I described</p>
<p>could be applied to any number</p>
<p>of different schedules or frameworks.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s one truth that applies to all of us</p>
<p>is that we all have to exist within the context</p>
<p>of this 24-hour rhythm that we all possess.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll focus on.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages that allow you</p>
<p>to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about how to apply</p>
<p>quality peer-reviewed science to your day,</p>
<p>and how to optimize everything from sleep</p>
<p>to learning, creativity, meal timing, et cetera.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do this in the context of my day</p>
<p>and what I typically do.</p>
<p>However, the specific protocols</p>
<p>for any number of different things,</p>
<p>sleep relaxation, meal timing, exercise, et cetera,</p>
<p>any one or all of those could be rearranged</p>
<p>to suit your specific needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you what I do from morning until waking,</p>
<p>and even what I do while I sleep</p>
<p>in order to optimize my sleep.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with getting up in the morning.</p>
<p>Now, for me, I tend to wake up sometime around 6 a.m., 6.30,</p>
<p>sometimes as late as 7 a.m.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t typically sleep much later than 7 a.m.</p>
<p>The first thing I do after I wake up</p>
<p>is I take the pen that&rsquo;s on my nightstand</p>
<p>and the pad of paper on my nightstand,</p>
<p>and I write down the time in which I woke up.</p>
<p>Now, I do sleep with my phone in my room.</p>
<p>I realize this is considered a sin</p>
<p>and has certain hazards associated with it,</p>
<p>but I put my phone on airplane mode</p>
<p>about an hour before I go to sleep,</p>
<p>and then I set my alarm typically for 6.30 a.m.,</p>
<p>and some days the alarm wakes me up,</p>
<p>other days I wake up before the alarm,</p>
<p>and yes, some days the alarm goes off</p>
<p>and I hit snooze a few times,</p>
<p>and then usually by 7 a.m. I am up and out of bed.</p>
<p>The reason for writing down what time I wake up</p>
<p>is because I want to know that average wake-up time.</p>
<p>That average wake-up time</p>
<p>informs what&rsquo;s called my temperature minimum.</p>
<p>It tells me when my body temperature was lowest.</p>
<p>The temperature minimum is the time in each 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>that your body temperature is lowest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t sleep with a thermometer in my mouth or elsewhere,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think you should either.</p>
<p>Instead, I know that the lowest temperature</p>
<p>that my body will be at across the 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>tends to be two hours before my typical wake-up time,</p>
<p>and I want to know that number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called our temperature minimum.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody that typically wakes up at 8 a.m.,</p>
<p>then your temperature minimum is sometime around 6 a.m.</p>
<p>Remember, the temperature minimum</p>
<p>is a time in the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what my actual temperature is.</p>
<p>I care when my lowest temperature is,</p>
<p>and I know that that lowest temperature</p>
<p>is approximately two hours before my average wake-up time.</p>
<p>So I highly recommend that you write down when you wake up</p>
<p>or track that in some way that works for you</p>
<p>and use that as a reference point</p>
<p>to determine your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>We will return to the temperature minimum</p>
<p>and how you can leverage the temperature minimum</p>
<p>for several things, shifting your clock,</p>
<p>shifting your circadian sleep schedule and wake schedule,</p>
<p>also for shifting your eating schedule, et cetera.</p>
<p>We will return to that, but even if you don&rsquo;t travel,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t care about things like jet lag,</p>
<p>even if you sleep fabulously all year round,</p>
<p>never have a poor night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>knowing your temperature minimum,</p>
<p>that time when your temperature is at its lowest point,</p>
<p>is a valuable thing to know.</p>
<p>The second thing I do after I wake up</p>
<p>is to get into forward ambulation,</p>
<p>which is just nerd speak for taking a walk.</p>
<p>I have a dog, and as many of you know, he&rsquo;s a bulldog,</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t really like to walk,</p>
<p>especially not in the morning,</p>
<p>but for humans and for animals,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a phenomenon whereby</p>
<p>when we generate our own forward motion, forward ambulation,</p>
<p>visual images pass by us on our eyes, so-called optic flow.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are low vision or no vision,</p>
<p>the same phenomenon occurs in the auditory system,</p>
<p>sounds pass by us in so-called auditory flow.</p>
<p>Getting into a mode of forward ambulation,</p>
<p>and especially experiencing visual flow,</p>
<p>has a powerful effect on the nervous system.</p>
<p>The effect it has is essentially to quiet</p>
<p>or reduce the amount of neural activity</p>
<p>in this brain structure called the amygdala.</p>
<p>Amygdala means almond,</p>
<p>and many of you have probably heard about the amygdala</p>
<p>for its role in anxiety and fear and threat detection.</p>
<p>And indeed, the amygdala is part of the network in the brain</p>
<p>that generates feelings of fear and threat and anxiety.</p>
<p>It does a bunch of other things too,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one of its primary functions.</p>
<p>There are now at least half a dozen quality papers</p>
<p>published in quality peer-reviewed journals</p>
<p>that show that forward ambulation,</p>
<p>walking or biking or running,</p>
<p>and generating optic flow in particular,</p>
<p>has this incredible property of lowering activity</p>
<p>in the amygdala and thereby reducing levels of anxiety.</p>
<p>There are two papers that I&rsquo;d like to highlight</p>
<p>in particular that relate to this phenomenon.</p>
<p>The first one was published in the journal Neuron,</p>
<p>and the title of this paper</p>
<p>is Whole Brain Functional Ultrasound Imaging.</p>
<p>That just means they have a cool technique</p>
<p>to evaluate the activity of structures in the brain</p>
<p>across the entire brain.</p>
<p>Reveals brain modules for visual motor integration.</p>
<p>What they found in this study,</p>
<p>and I should mention the first author is Mase,</p>
<p>this comes from Botan Raska&rsquo;s group.</p>
<p>This was work done in mice,</p>
<p>but I will talk about other species in a moment.</p>
<p>What they found was essentially</p>
<p>that when these mice walk forward</p>
<p>and their eyes move from side to side,</p>
<p>which is a natural consequence of moving forward,</p>
<p>so-called optic flow is flowing past their eyes,</p>
<p>many brain areas are activated,</p>
<p>increase in their level of firing,</p>
<p>but the amygdala in particular</p>
<p>reduced its levels of firing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting finding, but it is in mice.</p>
<p>However, another paper,</p>
<p>Eye Movement Intervention Enhances Extinction</p>
<p>via Amygdala Deactivation,</p>
<p>was published in the Journal of Neuroscience,</p>
<p>a strong journal,</p>
<p>and shows that, again, these eye movements,</p>
<p>these lateral eye movements from side to side</p>
<p>reduce activity levels in this fear slash threat</p>
<p>slash anxiety center in the brain, the amygdala.</p>
<p>Now, those are eye movements,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t specifically look at forward ambulation,</p>
<p>and yet other papers have looked at forward ambulation,</p>
<p>and we know that forward ambulation, walking forward,</p>
<p>generates the sorts of eye movements</p>
<p>that cause optic flow and reductions in amygdala activation.</p>
<p>So for me, this process of taking a walk each morning</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t about exercise, it&rsquo;s not about burning calories,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about any of that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really about getting into optic flow</p>
<p>and reducing the levels of amygdala activation.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t have anxiety,</p>
<p>at least I don&rsquo;t have chronic anxiety</p>
<p>or generalized anxiety.</p>
<p>I tend to have a lot of energy,</p>
<p>but at these points in the morning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very energetic.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m sort of shuffling more than I&rsquo;m walking,</p>
<p>in fact, and Costello is almost always shuffling,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m almost always trying to drag him</p>
<p>first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>But that walk is a particularly important protocol each day</p>
<p>because it really serves to push my neurology</p>
<p>in the direction that I&rsquo;d like it to go,</p>
<p>which is alert, but not anxious.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of a fine line sometimes,</p>
<p>especially as events surface throughout the day,</p>
<p>emails come in, text messages come in,</p>
<p>get bombarded with a number of things.</p>
<p>I want to be alert and responsive.</p>
<p>I want to be able to focus,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to feel anxious</p>
<p>or reactive to these things.</p>
<p>So the forward ambulation and this optic flow</p>
<p>is the way that I ensure based on quality peer review data</p>
<p>that my amygdala activation is slightly suppressed.</p>
<p>Now, at the same time, I also want the alertness.</p>
<p>I want alert and focused.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just want to be sleepy or super, super relaxed.</p>
<p>I want to have a high degree of focus and alertness</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m soon going to move into about a work.</p>
<p>I need to lean into the day.</p>
<p>So in order to do that,</p>
<p>I make sure that the walking is done outdoors.</p>
<p>That might be sort of a duh,</p>
<p>but many people get up and start moving around their house,</p>
<p>their apartment, and they don&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>And just walking around inside,</p>
<p>it will generate some optic flow,</p>
<p>but nothing like the sort of optic flow</p>
<p>that you can generate in larger environments</p>
<p>like outdoors environments.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t get outdoors,</p>
<p>doing it indoors is perfectly fine,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not going to have the same magnitude</p>
<p>of positive effect.</p>
<p>Now, in order to get the alertness,</p>
<p>I do it outdoors because I also want sunlight in my eyes.</p>
<p>I know many of you have heard me talk about this</p>
<p>ad nauseum on various podcasts and this podcast,</p>
<p>but getting sunlight in your eyes first thing in the morning</p>
<p>is absolutely vital to mental and physical health.</p>
<p>It is perhaps the most important thing</p>
<p>that any and all of us can and should do</p>
<p>in order to promote metabolic wellbeing,</p>
<p>promote the positive functioning of your hormone system,</p>
<p>get your mental health steering in the right direction.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this,</p>
<p>but before I get into those reasons,</p>
<p>let me just emphasize what the protocol is.</p>
<p>The protocol is get outdoors,</p>
<p>ideally with no sunglasses if you can do that safely,</p>
<p>even if there&rsquo;s cloud cover.</p>
<p>More photons, light information,</p>
<p>are coming through that cloud cover</p>
<p>than would be coming from a very bright indoor bulb.</p>
<p>So getting outdoors is absolutely key.</p>
<p>How long should you do this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on the brightness of the environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on a number of different factors.</p>
<p>Two minutes would be a minimum.</p>
<p>10 minutes would be even better.</p>
<p>And if you can, 30 minutes would be fantastic.</p>
<p>Now, if it&rsquo;s a very bright day</p>
<p>or you live in a place where there&rsquo;s bright sunlight,</p>
<p>clear day on a snowfield,</p>
<p>you would only need something like 60 seconds,</p>
<p>but most people aren&rsquo;t living in those sorts of conditions.</p>
<p>So getting outside for a 10-minute walk or a 15-minute walk</p>
<p>will basically ensure that you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>adequate stimulation of these neurons in the eye</p>
<p>that are called the melanopsin,</p>
<p>intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s a mouthful.</p>
<p>These are neurons that don&rsquo;t care about shapes of objects</p>
<p>or the motion of objects.</p>
<p>These are neurons that convey to the brain</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s daytime and it&rsquo;s time to be alert.</p>
<p>And it sets in motion a huge number of biological cascades</p>
<p>within every cell and organ of your body,</p>
<p>from your liver to your gut, to your heart, to your brain.</p>
<p>It really sets things down the right path.</p>
<p>Early in the day, we experience a natural and healthy bump</p>
<p>in a hormone called cortisol.</p>
<p>Cortisol comes from the amygdala.</p>
<p>That cortisol, as I mentioned, is healthy and normal</p>
<p>and promotes wakefulness.</p>
<p>It actually promotes a healthy immune system.</p>
<p>So I know you&rsquo;ve heard that stress and cortisol</p>
<p>disrupt the immune system,</p>
<p>but not the short little pulse of cortisol</p>
<p>that you get each morning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important that that pulse of cortisol</p>
<p>arrive early in the day.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize this again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important that that pulse of cortisol</p>
<p>arrive early in the day.</p>
<p>And that pulse of cortisol is going to happen</p>
<p>once every 24 hours, no matter what.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to happen and you get to time it.</p>
<p>How do you time it?</p>
<p>Primarily by when you view bright sunlight</p>
<p>or bright light of another kind.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about that in a moment.</p>
<p>So you want that cortisol pushed early.</p>
<p>If you wake up before the sun comes out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine to turn on artificial lights,</p>
<p>but then you would want to get outside as soon as you can</p>
<p>to get this, excuse me,</p>
<p>natural light stimulation of your eyes.</p>
<p>And it does have to be to your eyes.</p>
<p>Just to really drill down into the details for a moment,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to stare directly at the sun</p>
<p>or any light that&rsquo;s so bright that it feels painful.</p>
<p>If you feel like you have to close your eyes or blink,</p>
<p>please do.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to damage your retinas.</p>
<p>The point here is to get the sunlight indirectly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to essentially be scattered everywhere</p>
<p>through the cloud cover,</p>
<p>but you know from looking at a flashlight</p>
<p>directly into that flashlight</p>
<p>versus looking at the beam that flashlight generates</p>
<p>on the ground, that if you&rsquo;re standing in the shade,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get less of that sunlight than you are</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re out in an open field.</p>
<p>So this is why the time outside,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to need to vary</p>
<p>depending on your particular environment.</p>
<p>But do your best to do this every day.</p>
<p>If you miss a day, no big deal,</p>
<p>but try not to miss more than one day.</p>
<p>Otherwise your mental and physical health</p>
<p>will start to suffer.</p>
<p>And doing this each day costs nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just time.</p>
<p>You can combine it with the forward ambulation</p>
<p>with the walk and the optic flow</p>
<p>that I talked about before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I do each morning</p>
<p>to generate a sense of alertness in my body</p>
<p>and brain to generate a sense of calm yet alert.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also what I do with Costello, with my bulldog.</p>
<p>People have asked me,</p>
<p>do these same mechanisms apply to animals?</p>
<p>Well, the reality is many of these mechanisms</p>
<p>were actually discovered in animals</p>
<p>and then were tested in humans</p>
<p>and verified that they also exist in humans.</p>
<p>Not always, sometimes it was the reverse</p>
<p>where they were tested first in humans</p>
<p>and then brought to animals.</p>
<p>But indeed your dog, your horse,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what other animals are out there.</p>
<p>They need this.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a hamster or a nocturnal animal,</p>
<p>the reason why they like to run on their wheels at night</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re nocturnal.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like being in the light.</p>
<p>Light actually causes them to freeze, right?</p>
<p>Actually, if you are into aquaria, you like fish,</p>
<p>they always say, don&rsquo;t overfeed your fish.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll kill the fish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But the fastest way to kill a fish</p>
<p>is to keep the lights on 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>They also need circadian rhythms, these 24 hour rhythms.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll do an entire month at some point about pet health,</p>
<p>but meanwhile, get that morning sunlight.</p>
<p>So now we have a first protocol,</p>
<p>which is to write down the time of day that you wake up.</p>
<p>The second protocol is to take a walk</p>
<p>first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>And the third protocol is woven in with that walk,</p>
<p>at least for me, which is to get that sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Now, if you can&rsquo;t get sunlight exposure,</p>
<p>you absolutely can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily recommend buying</p>
<p>one of these dawn alarm lights.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry to say this,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just vastly overpriced relative to what they are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically a bright LED.</p>
<p>I instead use, I have a pad that&rsquo;s a 930 lux light pad.</p>
<p>I think it was designed for drawing.</p>
<p>Those are available at a fraction of the cost</p>
<p>that a morning light simulator would provide.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s really bright enough, at least for me.</p>
<p>I tend to put it on my desk while I work each morning.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a principle that you can leverage.</p>
<p>If you want to be alert,</p>
<p>view bright lights and make those lights above you.</p>
<p>They tend to, or in front of you.</p>
<p>If you want to go to sleep soon,</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t want to be awake for whatever reason,</p>
<p>try and eliminate your exposure to light.</p>
<p>And this is, again,</p>
<p>is not about exposure of the skin to light.</p>
<p>This is about exposure of your eyes,</p>
<p>of your neural retinas to light.</p>
<p>For those of you that are concerned about blue light,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that blue light</p>
<p>is precisely the wavelength of light</p>
<p>that is optimal for stimulating these neurons in your eye,</p>
<p>which set your circadian rhythms properly.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to shield yourself from blue light</p>
<p>early in the day or throughout the day,</p>
<p>or anytime you want to be awake.</p>
<p>In fact, that could have a number</p>
<p>of detrimental consequences.</p>
<p>Fortunately, all those consequences</p>
<p>are going to be reversible after a short period of time</p>
<p>of making sure that you don&rsquo;t wear your blue blockers</p>
<p>during the day, please.</p>
<p>The time to wear blue blockers, if you do,</p>
<p>is at night and in the evening</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re headed towards sleep.</p>
<p>My colleague, Samer Hattar,</p>
<p>who is head of the chronobiology unit</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health,</p>
<p>has spoken about this before on my Instagram.</p>
<p>We held an Instagram Live and I said,</p>
<p>Samer, what do you think about blue blockers?</p>
<p>And he said, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good idea at all,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s really late at night</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a bright environment</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to limit the amount of bright light</p>
<p>that impacts the eyes.</p>
<p>Eliminating specific wavelengths of light,</p>
<p>in Samer&rsquo;s opinion, and also in my opinion,</p>
<p>is not a natural thing for the visual system</p>
<p>in the brain to experience.</p>
<p>Some people get headaches while they work on the computer</p>
<p>all day or staring at screens,</p>
<p>and so they get blue blockers</p>
<p>thinking that&rsquo;s going to protect them from their headaches.</p>
<p>However, any protection that you get from headaches,</p>
<p>from blue blockers, is going to be minimal</p>
<p>in comparison to what&rsquo;s really going on there,</p>
<p>which is that people are viewing devices</p>
<p>and screens up close for too many hours</p>
<p>throughout the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>A better remedy would be to step away from that computer</p>
<p>from time to time and to make sure</p>
<p>that you can look far off into the distance,</p>
<p>ideally a distance longer than 20 feet,</p>
<p>like view a horizon, go out on a balcony,</p>
<p>things of that sort, take a walk around,</p>
<p>get into optic flow.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re into blue blockers,</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re only wearing them</p>
<p>in the late evening and at night.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t wear blue blockers at all.</p>
<p>I prefer to just control my light-viewing behavior</p>
<p>by doing this, I do the other form of circadian control,</p>
<p>which is to dim the lights.</p>
<p>And I do that because dimming the lights</p>
<p>and setting them lower in the environment</p>
<p>sets up the brain and body for sleep much better</p>
<p>than simply just wearing some blue blockers, excuse me.</p>
<p>And please know if you do wear blue blockers</p>
<p>that if the light in your environment is bright enough,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re blocking out the blues,</p>
<p>these cells in the eye will respond</p>
<p>to other wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>So I have no vendetta against the blue blockers</p>
<p>and I fully expect the blue blockanistas</p>
<p>to come after me with, I guess, blue blockers.</p>
<p>But as you do that, please understand</p>
<p>that the biology points in the direction</p>
<p>of get a lot of bright light throughout the day,</p>
<p>including blue light, and at night,</p>
<p>just limit the total amount of overall light</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re exposed to, including from screens.</p>
<p>So then Costello and I get back from our walk.</p>
<p>Sometimes that walk was 10 minutes,</p>
<p>sometimes it was 60 minutes,</p>
<p>depending on how slowly Costello was walking that day.</p>
<p>Indeed, many mornings,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the guy carrying his bulldog back up the hill.</p>
<p>My neighbors know me so well, they know Costello so well</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve since stopped pulling over</p>
<p>and asking if the dog is okay.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll ask if I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we get back, I give him his food,</p>
<p>I give him his water, and I give me my water.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer, based on quality peer-reviewed data,</p>
<p>that hydration is essential for mental performance.</p>
<p>Now, I confess, I don&rsquo;t really like drinking big glasses</p>
<p>or big jugs of water first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>but my thirst doesn&rsquo;t tend to kick in first thing.</p>
<p>You may be different.</p>
<p>Either way, I force myself, essentially,</p>
<p>to drink at least 16, and most days, 32 ounces of water.</p>
<p>I also put a little bit of sea salt in the water.</p>
<p>As many of you know, neurons require ionic flow.</p>
<p>What that means is neurons need sodium,</p>
<p>they need magnesium, and they need potassium</p>
<p>in order to function.</p>
<p>We do tend to get dehydrated at night.</p>
<p>Even if the day is not very hot, I try and top off,</p>
<p>or I try and make sure that I&rsquo;m hydrated early in the day</p>
<p>before I begin any work.</p>
<p>So I make myself drink this water</p>
<p>with a little bit of sea salt.</p>
<p>How much sea salt, if you really want to get detailed,</p>
<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s about half a teaspoon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>And I drink that more or less room temperature.</p>
<p>I find that drinking really cold water</p>
<p>first thing in the day kind of like cramps up my insides,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>At that point, I start thinking about,</p>
<p>and fantasizing about, and craving caffeine,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t drink that caffeine yet.</p>
<p>I purposely delay my caffeine intake</p>
<p>to 90 minutes to 120 minutes after I wake up.</p>
<p>Of course, I know when I wake up because I wrote it down,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s pretty easy to commit to memory.</p>
<p>The reason I delay caffeine is because one of the factors</p>
<p>that induces a sense of sleepiness</p>
<p>is the buildup of adenosine,</p>
<p>or as some people call it, adenosine, in our system.</p>
<p>The buildup of adenosine accumulates</p>
<p>the longer we are awake.</p>
<p>So when I wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>when you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>your adenosine levels are likely to be very low.</p>
<p>However, caffeine is an adenosine blocker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a competitive antagonist for you aficionados.</p>
<p>It sort of parks in the receptor</p>
<p>that adenosine normally would park at</p>
<p>and prevents adenosine from acting on that receptor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you feel more alert</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s essentially blocking the effect</p>
<p>of this sleepiness factor that we all create</p>
<p>called adenosine.</p>
<p>The reason for delaying caffeine intake</p>
<p>90 minutes to two hours after waking</p>
<p>is I want to make sure that I don&rsquo;t have a late afternoon</p>
<p>or even early afternoon crash from caffeine.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to ensure a caffeine crash</p>
<p>is to drink a bunch of caffeine,</p>
<p>block all those adenosine receptors,</p>
<p>and then by early or late afternoon,</p>
<p>when that caffeine starts to wear off</p>
<p>and gets dislodged from the receptors,</p>
<p>a lower level of adenosine is able to create</p>
<p>a greater level of sleepiness.</p>
<p>It took me years to figure this out.</p>
<p>I used to wake up and I&rsquo;d think,</p>
<p>oh, I don&rsquo;t want to drink caffeine too close to bedtime,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to start drinking my caffeine really early.</p>
<p>I let my cortisol naturally come up in the morning.</p>
<p>I avoid drinking caffeine</p>
<p>until about 90 minutes or two hours after waking.</p>
<p>And when I do that,</p>
<p>I find that I don&rsquo;t experience the afternoon crash.</p>
<p>At least I don&rsquo;t experience that crash</p>
<p>unless I do something foolish</p>
<p>like ingest far too much food at lunch</p>
<p>or I stay up all night the night before.</p>
<p>But provided I don&rsquo;t do anything foolish like that,</p>
<p>delaying caffeine at 90 minutes to two hours</p>
<p>optimizes this relationship between adenosine</p>
<p>and wakefulness and sleepiness</p>
<p>in a way that really provides a nice consistent arc</p>
<p>of energy throughout the day</p>
<p>and brings energy down as I&rsquo;m headed toward sleep</p>
<p>and falling asleep.</p>
<p>My primary objective early in the day</p>
<p>is to get into a mode of being focused yet alert</p>
<p>so that I can get work done.</p>
<p>I found that the best way for me to achieve that state</p>
<p>is through fasting.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t eat anything until about 11 a.m. or 12 noon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not absolutely religious about it.</p>
<p>There are days when I&rsquo;ll have a few Brazil nuts</p>
<p>or a spoonful or three of almond butter, for instance,</p>
<p>but most days I&rsquo;m not doing that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not eating anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drinking some caffeine.</p>
<p>Caffeine source for me is yerba mate, guayusa tea.</p>
<p>Those are my preferred sources.</p>
<p>I tend to avoid coffee these days.</p>
<p>Occasionally I&rsquo;ll have a cup,</p>
<p>but most often I stick to the teas.</p>
<p>I drink water as much as I feel I need to and want to.</p>
<p>And I also drink my athletic greens,</p>
<p>which is compatible at least for me with fasting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about why fasting works</p>
<p>to create this heightened state of alertness</p>
<p>yet calm brain state.</p>
<p>Fasting increases levels of adrenaline,</p>
<p>also called epinephrine in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And when our levels of epinephrine and adrenaline</p>
<p>are increased, we learn better, we can focus better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s terrific data supporting that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want epinephrine, aka adrenaline, too high.</p>
<p>That feels like stress and panic.</p>
<p>You get jittery, you can&rsquo;t focus.</p>
<p>But in its optimal range,</p>
<p>adrenaline really provides a heightened sense of focus</p>
<p>and the ability to encode, meaning bring in and retain,</p>
<p>remember information.</p>
<p>And so since my job is mainly a cerebral one</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m writing grants and working on papers, et cetera,</p>
<p>I fast in the early part of the day.</p>
<p>I mentioned ingesting things like guayusa or yerba mate,</p>
<p>or in my case, athletic greens.</p>
<p>Many people ask, in fact,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole community and discussion boards, et cetera,</p>
<p>and YouTube comments on the internet</p>
<p>about what breaks a fast and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be highly individual</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to depend</p>
<p>on how sensitive your blood sugar is.</p>
<p>And more accurately, it&rsquo;s going to depend on things</p>
<p>like your insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who gets up in the morning,</p>
<p>hydrates and goes out for a six mile run,</p>
<p>you could probably eat a jar of almond butter</p>
<p>and still be what&rsquo;s called fat fasted.</p>
<p>Your insulin levels will still be very low</p>
<p>because even though that is a large volume of almond butter,</p>
<p>even to me and Costello,</p>
<p>that large number of calories come from a source</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t increase blood sugar very much</p>
<p>and insulin very much.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not suggesting you do that,</p>
<p>but what I just described is a vastly different situation</p>
<p>than somebody that ate their last meal at 2 a.m.</p>
<p>and that meal was essentially a feast.</p>
<p>And for that person, fasting until 10 or 11 a.m.,</p>
<p>their blood sugar might still actually be pretty high</p>
<p>or even low-ish such that they might eat one almond</p>
<p>and it would bump them out of fasting.</p>
<p>So you get the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on your recent eating history,</p>
<p>your blood sugar history, your glycogen stores, et cetera.</p>
<p>So if anyone tells you that breaks a fast or that doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of silly.</p>
<p>Would one grain of sugar break your fast?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Would an entire tablespoon of sugar break your fast?</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;ll get a big blip in blood sugar</p>
<p>and insulin from that.</p>
<p>However, how long that lasts, how long it breaks your fast</p>
<p>will depend on how glycogen depleted you are</p>
<p>and a number of other factors.</p>
<p>So for me, I just keep it fairly simple.</p>
<p>I ingest water, caffeine from Yerba Mate and Guayusa,</p>
<p>and I drink my athletic greens with some lemon juice in it.</p>
<p>That constitutes my fasting.</p>
<p>And there are days when I do all those things.</p>
<p>There are days when I do none of those things.</p>
<p>Although most days, I would say about 355 days</p>
<p>out of the year, I&rsquo;m ingesting water, caffeine,</p>
<p>and athletic greens during this period of fasting</p>
<p>early in the day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the period of time when I do my work.</p>
<p>One interesting fact about Yerba Mate and Guayusa teas</p>
<p>is that they increase release of something called GLP-1.</p>
<p>GLP-1 is related to glucagon.</p>
<p>Glucagon is a hormone that you can sort of think about</p>
<p>as opposite to insulin and blood sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more complex than that,</p>
<p>but GLP-1 has a couple of positive properties.</p>
<p>One is it increases lipolysis and mobilization</p>
<p>of body fat stores, so burning of fat.</p>
<p>In fact, there are now a number of clinical trials</p>
<p>that are achieving good success,</p>
<p>and there are drugs out there only available by prescription</p>
<p>which mimic GLP-1 and are being used to treat</p>
<p>quite successfully, certain types of diabetes and obesity.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not diabetic,</p>
<p>nor am I trying to shed a ton of body fat,</p>
<p>but I figure as long as I&rsquo;m fasting,</p>
<p>and as long as I like Yerba Mate and Guayusa,</p>
<p>which I do, they&rsquo;re delicious,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you which type I use in a moment,</p>
<p>I might as well increase my GLP-1</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s probably not as good as getting out</p>
<p>and doing some cardio work.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, if I&rsquo;m fasted, increasing GLP-1</p>
<p>in my system, I&rsquo;m going to be alert from the caffeine,</p>
<p>the adrenaline, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to be burning body fat</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m doing my work.</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s just an efficient biochemically rational,</p>
<p>or I should say grounded in quality biochemistry</p>
<p>sort of approach.</p>
<p>Yerba Mate comes in a lot of different forms.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different brands out there, et cetera.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any relationship whatsoever</p>
<p>in a business sense to any of these brands.</p>
<p>Some of them are very smoky.</p>
<p>I, just because of something in my genetic makeup,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it was some sort</p>
<p>of Y chromosome associated lesion early in life,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t like smoky flavors.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a Gouda cheese guy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like smoky stuff.</p>
<p>You may love it, but I tend to avoid smoky tasting mates.</p>
<p>Instead, there&rsquo;s a particular brand</p>
<p>that I just found on the internet called Anna Park.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Anna.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she has a park</p>
<p>and I certainly don&rsquo;t know what Anna Park is,</p>
<p>but for me, that&rsquo;s the best tasting Yerba Mate.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t have any relationship to them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s affordable in the context of Yerba Mate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the one that I use.</p>
<p>And I should mention along the lines of affordability</p>
<p>and GLP-1 is there&rsquo;s a nice feature of Yerba Mate,</p>
<p>which is if you put it in a filter or a metal strainer</p>
<p>and you pour hot water over it and then drink it,</p>
<p>keep the leaves.</p>
<p>The Yerba Mate leaves can be used over and over again.</p>
<p>It seems that the GLP-1 stimulating aspects</p>
<p>of mate actually are enhanced with subsequent pour over.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something interesting about these teas</p>
<p>that my tea aficionado friends tell me</p>
<p>allows the tea to release more</p>
<p>of some of the beneficial compounds</p>
<p>by reusing the tea leaves.</p>
<p>Now, eventually it&rsquo;ll grow mold</p>
<p>and other sorts of disgusting things.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really want to run that experiment.</p>
<p>I would say you can use it for a day or two</p>
<p>before it starts to go bad,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a feature that will extend the life</p>
<p>of whatever Yerba Mate you happen to use</p>
<p>if you decide to use it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly what I do.</p>
<p>Next, I want to talk about what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m drinking all this Yerba Mate,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not just sitting there thinking</p>
<p>about all the GLP-1 circulating in my system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working.</p>
<p>A couple of things for optimizing workspace</p>
<p>that are grounded in neuroscience and physiology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about the fact</p>
<p>that when our eyes are directed upward,</p>
<p>literally when our eyelids are open, no surprise there,</p>
<p>and when our eyes are directed upward,</p>
<p>it creates a state of heightened alertness.</p>
<p>And this has a relationship to the brainstem neurons</p>
<p>that create alertness and their control</p>
<p>over the muscles of the eye,</p>
<p>and believe it or not, the eyelids.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not the case that if you are absolutely exhausted</p>
<p>and you need to feel more alert,</p>
<p>that looking upward is going to make you feel wide awake,</p>
<p>although it will help support your levels of alertness.</p>
<p>The point here is that you can optimize your workstation</p>
<p>in a physical way that leverages this aspect</p>
<p>of the visual system and your level of alertness.</p>
<p>Since most of us want to be awake while we&rsquo;re working,</p>
<p>try and position your screen or your tablet,</p>
<p>whatever device you happen to be working on,</p>
<p>at least at eye level, and ideally slightly higher.</p>
<p>Now, if you think about it, most people are not doing this.</p>
<p>Most people are looking down at their computer or tablet</p>
<p>or are angling their eyes at their screen</p>
<p>at about 30 degrees.</p>
<p>That is not going to support heightened states</p>
<p>of alertness and optimal attention.</p>
<p>In fact, the opposite relationship</p>
<p>between eye position and alertness is also true.</p>
<p>When we look down, when our eyelids are slightly closed,</p>
<p>it tends to decrease our levels of alertness</p>
<p>and increase our levels of sleepiness.</p>
<p>I really want to emphasize this,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a bidirectional or reciprocal relationship</p>
<p>between the brainstem areas that control alertness</p>
<p>and the eyes, meaning how alert you are</p>
<p>controls how open or closed your eyes are,</p>
<p>no surprise there, but also that how open</p>
<p>and upward directed your eyes are</p>
<p>will increase your levels of alertness.</p>
<p>And if your eyes are pointed downward</p>
<p>and your eyelids are hooded,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re slowly closing like Costello&rsquo;s always are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel more sleepy,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re somebody who tends to have</p>
<p>that mid-morning sleepiness or mid-morning crash.</p>
<p>So what I do is I have a standing desk,</p>
<p>but I also prop the computer up</p>
<p>such that it&rsquo;s at least at eye level.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t figured out yet how to develop a workstation</p>
<p>where the computer is above me.</p>
<p>I think the only way to really do that</p>
<p>is actually to tilt one&rsquo;s body back,</p>
<p>but actually that&rsquo;s not a good idea either.</p>
<p>They have done studies recording</p>
<p>from areas of the brain associated with alertness,</p>
<p>areas like locus coeruleus</p>
<p>and the so-called reticular activating system.</p>
<p>What they found is that depending on how reclined you are</p>
<p>or upright you are, you will decrease with reclining</p>
<p>and increase with sitting forward</p>
<p>your levels of alertness.</p>
<p>So body posture and whether or not you&rsquo;re upright</p>
<p>or reclining will impact your levels of alertness</p>
<p>in the predictable ways.</p>
<p>And where you position your eyes,</p>
<p>whether or not your eyes are upright, so to speak,</p>
<p>looking up or directly forward or looking down</p>
<p>will dictate whether or not you are feeling more alert</p>
<p>or more sleepy respectively.</p>
<p>So try and arrange a workstation</p>
<p>or a position of your body and your chair</p>
<p>or your standing desk, whatever it is,</p>
<p>that allows you to work</p>
<p>with a heightened state of alertness.</p>
<p>This is really, really key for me</p>
<p>because I found that when I would sit down,</p>
<p>not only would my hip flexors start to get sore,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d feel tight in the back, et cetera,</p>
<p>but if I was staring down at my screen all day</p>
<p>or even for short periods of the day,</p>
<p>I would start to feel sleepy</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>I also thought maybe I needed glasses.</p>
<p>I do wear readers at night, but it was really a problem.</p>
<p>And simply by getting the screen directly in front of me</p>
<p>at eye level, it&rsquo;s been completely transformative.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now at the description of my day</p>
<p>and these protocols in which I would do</p>
<p>a 90-minute bout of work.</p>
<p>Now, why 90 minutes?</p>
<p>Well, the brain is going through these 90-minute,</p>
<p>so-called ultradian cycles</p>
<p>throughout the entire day and night.</p>
<p>Every 90 minutes, we shift over from being very alert</p>
<p>to being less alert and then back to alert again.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>At the start of one of these 90-minute ultradian cycles,</p>
<p>my brain is not quite engaged</p>
<p>in whatever it is I&rsquo;m trying to do.</p>
<p>Now, oftentimes I have things jumping into my mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got distractions, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about how to deal</p>
<p>with those distractions in a moment,</p>
<p>but I set a timer for 90 minutes</p>
<p>and I try and get a strong bout of work done</p>
<p>inside of that 90 minutes with the full understanding</p>
<p>that the entire 90 minutes is not going to be uniform</p>
<p>in terms of my ability to focus.</p>
<p>There will be kind of peaks and valleys within that,</p>
<p>but that 90 minutes is about what the brain can handle</p>
<p>in terms of a dedicated effort for high degree of focus.</p>
<p>Some people can push out a little bit further,</p>
<p>some people can&rsquo;t handle more than 10 minutes,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m striving toward.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be amazed how much you can get done in 90 minutes</p>
<p>if you are focused.</p>
<p>So how do you increase that focus</p>
<p>and how do you use the timer feature?</p>
<p>Well, you can combine those.</p>
<p>I use a program called Freedom.</p>
<p>It shuts me out of the internet completely.</p>
<p>So that means no checking the markets,</p>
<p>no checking social media,</p>
<p>no checking the news, no checking email, none of that.</p>
<p>I get a dedicated bout of work done.</p>
<p>I confess, I don&rsquo;t allow myself to go to the restroom</p>
<p>in that period of time.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting little tip</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s grounded in physiology.</p>
<p>You have a direct neural connection from your bladder</p>
<p>to your brainstem areas that increase alertness.</p>
<p>This is why when you have to go to the bathroom,</p>
<p>when you have to urinate, it is extremely agitating.</p>
<p>It can be very, very agitating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not encouraging you to get so agitated</p>
<p>by filling your bladder so much</p>
<p>and resisting going to the bathroom</p>
<p>that you are uncomfortable and can&rsquo;t focus.</p>
<p>But I generally will just drink liquids</p>
<p>and work away and work away,</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t walk away to go use the bathroom</p>
<p>unless I absolutely have to.</p>
<p>Sort of odd that we&rsquo;re talking about this,</p>
<p>but this is one way in which I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>to funnel my attention into whatever it is I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>Because as you all know,</p>
<p>the moment you sit down to do some serious work</p>
<p>and you flip off the internet,</p>
<p>all of a sudden it&rsquo;s as if the phone has a voice.</p>
<p>It starts calling you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if the restroom has a voice.</p>
<p>But we all are familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that if we are focused on something,</p>
<p>all that just kind of melts away.</p>
<p>So the goal is to get into what I call the tunnel,</p>
<p>to really get into a tunnel of quality work.</p>
<p>The brain loves that state,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very hard for many of us to access.</p>
<p>My phone is absolutely off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not on airplane mode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely off during this time.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve been struggling with that,</p>
<p>and I confess, you know,</p>
<p>there are times when for whatever reason,</p>
<p>something going on in life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been harder to put away the phone.</p>
<p>I will sometimes put in my car.</p>
<p>I used to joke that I used to throw it up on the roof</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>and I suggest people do whatever they need to</p>
<p>in order to self-regulate that activity.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody that feels</p>
<p>that you absolutely need to be on your phone</p>
<p>and on the computer for this work bout</p>
<p>or the work that you do,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a different matter altogether.</p>
<p>This is just simply how I work.</p>
<p>So I will do 90 minutes,</p>
<p>and I do set a timer,</p>
<p>and I turn on the program Freedom,</p>
<p>locks me out of the internet.</p>
<p>If someone rings it on the doorbell,</p>
<p>I will often shout,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not coming to the doorbell, leave it there.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I mean, unless there&rsquo;s a real emergency,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to step away from that work.</p>
<p>I learned how to do this when I was a graduate student</p>
<p>under different conditions</p>
<p>where I used to slice brains on what&rsquo;s called a microtome.</p>
<p>So I used to spend time just cutting very thin slices.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a deli slicer,</p>
<p>but for a brain of various types of brains</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve sectioned through a lot of brains.</p>
<p>And we had a rule,</p>
<p>which is that when the blade hits the brain,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t stop pulling,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s very, very slow,</p>
<p>even if a nuclear bomb goes off,</p>
<p>even if a fire alarm goes off.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want anyone burning to a crisp</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t step away from their workflow.</p>
<p>That would be foolish.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the mentality that I&rsquo;ve embedded in myself,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothing more important</p>
<p>than what I&rsquo;m doing in that 90-minute block.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what works for me.</p>
<p>You can try various other things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what works for me.</p>
<p>In addition, I use low-level white noise.</p>
<p>This is something that is supported</p>
<p>by quality peer-reviewed data.</p>
<p>We covered this on the episode on hearing and balance,</p>
<p>but it turns out that white noise,</p>
<p>which is essentially all frequencies of sound,</p>
<p>or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive,</p>
<p>mixed up kind of randomly, there&rsquo;s no structure to it,</p>
<p>turned on at a low volume,</p>
<p>not with headphones most of the time,</p>
<p>puts the brain into a state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimal for learning and workflow.</p>
<p>And I covered two papers during that episode,</p>
<p>one that showed that indeed,</p>
<p>brain areas involved in attention,</p>
<p>brain areas involved in focus and cognition and memory,</p>
<p>those are engaged to a greater degree</p>
<p>when there is low levels of white noise</p>
<p>playing in the background.</p>
<p>The other paper that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>did brain imaging and showed that areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with dopamine release</p>
<p>are increased by low levels of white noise.</p>
<p>Dopamine release is associated not just with pleasure,</p>
<p>but with motivation and craving.</p>
<p>So everything about this 90-minute block</p>
<p>from the low levels of white noise</p>
<p>to the position of my computer,</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;m standing and where my eyes are positioned</p>
<p>is geared towards putting me in this tunnel of work.</p>
<p>And I have to say that while it can be a challenge</p>
<p>to try and achieve this state and this tunnel of work,</p>
<p>some days you start to get kind of addicted to it.</p>
<p>It feels really good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a workout for the mind.</p>
<p>And it is something that as you exit that 90 minutes,</p>
<p>you really feel like you&rsquo;ve accomplished a lot</p>
<p>because often you have,</p>
<p>and it just feels deeply satisfying.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m convinced that that&rsquo;s because of the release</p>
<p>of neuromodulators like dopamine and the norepinephrine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s circulating in your system.</p>
<p>And I want to be clear</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not perfect about this 90 minutes.</p>
<p>Occasionally I get drawn away.</p>
<p>Occasionally something will happen</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll go use the restroom or Costello will have a need</p>
<p>or somebody will have a need</p>
<p>that I will have to respond to.</p>
<p>But I really try and achieve this most,</p>
<p>if not every day that I&rsquo;m alive,</p>
<p>because for me, that work session is kind of holy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where I set up a relationship,</p>
<p>not just between me and the work that I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>but between me and my ability</p>
<p>to control my own state of mind</p>
<p>using these various supports of the white noise, et cetera.</p>
<p>But really those supports are peripheral</p>
<p>to the fact that I&rsquo;m creating this space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m funneling my brain into a state</p>
<p>rather than allowing whatever events</p>
<p>and contexts on social media and elsewhere</p>
<p>might be occurring in the world</p>
<p>that would yank me out of what for me is my purpose</p>
<p>and my mission in life,</p>
<p>which is to do the sorts of work that I do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a powerful way in which you can place the timing</p>
<p>of this 90-minute work bout in an optimal way.</p>
<p>You have access to a very important piece of data</p>
<p>that dictates when this bout should start, more or less,</p>
<p>and when it should end.</p>
<p>That piece of data is your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who wakes up on average at 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>well, then your temperature minimum is 5 a.m.</p>
<p>And you can be reasonably sure,</p>
<p>I want to underscore reasonably,</p>
<p>but you can be reasonably sure that your best work</p>
<p>is going to be done anywhere from four to six hours</p>
<p>after your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>So for me, I tend to wake up around 6.30 a.m.</p>
<p>That means my temperature minimum is at 4.30 a.m.</p>
<p>You can add five hours to that.</p>
<p>So that means that a 90-minute work bout</p>
<p>could fall at 9.30 a.m. and it would be fairly optimized.</p>
<p>Or I could do it at 10.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Or I could do it at 8.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Somewhere in there, all right?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s exactly six hours</p>
<p>after your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>You will find it, however.</p>
<p>There is a precise and best time for you</p>
<p>to do this 90-minute work bout.</p>
<p>Whether or not it&rsquo;s five or six hours</p>
<p>after your temperature minimum</p>
<p>is going to vary from person to person.</p>
<p>How do I know this?</p>
<p>How do I know this relationship</p>
<p>between temperature minimum and focus cognition?</p>
<p>Well, temperature minimum defines the trough,</p>
<p>the nadir, as they say, of your temperature</p>
<p>across the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>And immediately after that,</p>
<p>your temperature will start to rise.</p>
<p>That temperature rise is actually what triggers</p>
<p>the initial cortisol release that you experience</p>
<p>and wakes you up further.</p>
<p>And then, of course, that sunlight that you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>is going to further enhance</p>
<p>that healthy release of cortisol.</p>
<p>That cortisol will then provide fuel, if you will,</p>
<p>for that increase in temperature.</p>
<p>And your body will continue to increase in temperature</p>
<p>throughout the day toward the afternoon.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re trying to do in this idea</p>
<p>of optimizing this 90-minute work bout</p>
<p>to a particular time of day</p>
<p>is catch the portion of the steepest slope</p>
<p>of that temperature rise.</p>
<p>Now, again, you&rsquo;re not walking around</p>
<p>with a thermocouple or a thermometer</p>
<p>in some orifice of your body,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have accurate information about temperature.</p>
<p>But you can make very good guesses</p>
<p>about when your body temperature is rising fastest</p>
<p>by virtue of that temperature minimum.</p>
<p>So again, just to be clear, it&rsquo;s a 90-minute work bout.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about what the brain can handle</p>
<p>for a very intense work bout.</p>
<p>Do understand, again,</p>
<p>that there are going to be portions of that 90-minute</p>
<p>that your brain is flickering in and out of focus,</p>
<p>other portions where you&rsquo;re going to be entirely focused.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s entirely normal.</p>
<p>But when to place that 90-minute work bout,</p>
<p>when to start it and when to end it</p>
<p>will depend on that temperature minimum.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who wakes up at 8 a.m. each morning,</p>
<p>your temperature minimum is 6 a.m.,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re going to want to start this work bout</p>
<p>somewhere around 10 a.m. or 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Now, some people wake up and feel very alert</p>
<p>first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>They can really do their best work</p>
<p>first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Please, if that&rsquo;s you, continue to do that.</p>
<p>Leverage that time, use that time.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re somebody who struggles to find focus,</p>
<p>definitely let your physiology</p>
<p>and this rise in your body temperature</p>
<p>support your efforts to focus</p>
<p>rather than trying to do your best work</p>
<p>at times of day when your physiology</p>
<p>is actually directing your body and your brain</p>
<p>toward defocus and towards being more lethargic.</p>
<p>It just is setting yourself up for success</p>
<p>when you try and capture</p>
<p>this rising phase of your temperature.</p>
<p>So up until now, we&rsquo;ve been emphasizing practices</p>
<p>that allow you to optimize your level of alertness</p>
<p>and your levels of mental focus.</p>
<p>Data going back to the 1990s supports the idea</p>
<p>that physical movement of particular kinds</p>
<p>can support brain health and brain function,</p>
<p>both in the immediate term and in the long-term.</p>
<p>Now, this has had a profound impact</p>
<p>on the field of neuroscience,</p>
<p>but frankly, it&rsquo;s also had a profound impact</p>
<p>on how I structure my day.</p>
<p>So after I&rsquo;ve finished a bout of work,</p>
<p>this 90-minute bout of work,</p>
<p>I force myself some days, other days I want to,</p>
<p>but I force myself to do some sort of physical exercise</p>
<p>that is going to be supportive of my brain health</p>
<p>and brain function and organ health</p>
<p>and bodily function in general.</p>
<p>So I just briefly want to touch on</p>
<p>what the structure of that exercise looks like,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s structured within the day</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s structured across the weeks, in fact,</p>
<p>based on the scientific data</p>
<p>and what the scientific data say is best or optimal</p>
<p>in order to promote longevity of the brain,</p>
<p>ability to focus, as well as cardiovascular health</p>
<p>and all the other things that we know exercise supports.</p>
<p>Now, there are various forms of physical activity</p>
<p>or what we call exercise,</p>
<p>but those can generally be batched into two categories.</p>
<p>First is strength and hypertrophy work.</p>
<p>So physical movements that are designed to make you stronger</p>
<p>and or make your muscles larger.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also endurance work,</p>
<p>physical exercise and movements that are designed</p>
<p>to allow you to do more work over time</p>
<p>or to extend the amount of time that you can do work</p>
<p>of any kind, both physical and mental.</p>
<p>And we did two full podcast episodes on the details</p>
<p>and the science and the protocols related to these topics.</p>
<p>We did an episode on the science</p>
<p>of strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>of building strength and muscle building,</p>
<p>and that included a lot of protocols.</p>
<p>And we did an episode on endurance,</p>
<p>how to build any one or all of the four types of endurance,</p>
<p>which are muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic,</p>
<p>long distance endurance, et cetera.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in the specifics</p>
<p>of those protocols, please see those episodes.</p>
<p>However, right now, I just want to emphasize</p>
<p>how the data impact my day and how I structure my day</p>
<p>in a way that I can incorporate physical movement</p>
<p>in a way that supports my brain and health.</p>
<p>Basically, after I finished that cognitive work about</p>
<p>that 90 minute work about,</p>
<p>I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour.</p>
<p>The data all point to the fact that working out hard</p>
<p>for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental</p>
<p>because of the way that it raises cortisol.</p>
<p>And cortisol can be a good thing</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s appropriately timed</p>
<p>and in the appropriate low levels,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to have your cortisol levels up</p>
<p>throughout the day or have big spikes</p>
<p>of cortisol repeatedly.</p>
<p>So keeping workouts relatively short</p>
<p>can definitely help with that.</p>
<p>And certainly if you&rsquo;re training hard,</p>
<p>60 minutes or less should be more than sufficient.</p>
<p>And for many people, including myself,</p>
<p>45 minutes or 50 minutes is probably even more optimal.</p>
<p>The basic design of this physical exercise</p>
<p>is that it be approximately 60 minutes.</p>
<p>So maybe 60 plus or minus 15 minutes</p>
<p>should be well within the margins</p>
<p>of keeping hormonal health proper and not going too long,</p>
<p>nor making the workout so short that it&rsquo;s not beneficial.</p>
<p>And essentially what the data tell us</p>
<p>is that in order to optimize cardiovascular</p>
<p>and brain health and other systems of the body,</p>
<p>we want to exercise at least five days per week.</p>
<p>I know that seems like a lot.</p>
<p>It certainly is a lot for certain people.</p>
<p>Some of you, you compulsive exercisers</p>
<p>might gasp at the idea of taking two days off.</p>
<p>I personally find that taking two full days off per week</p>
<p>is actually both beneficial</p>
<p>to my exercise training performance as well as pleasant.</p>
<p>I like those rest days.</p>
<p>But essentially the structure of the exercise regimen</p>
<p>that works for sake of supporting health</p>
<p>is going to be one in which there&rsquo;s a three to two ratio</p>
<p>where for a 12 week period or so, maybe 10 to 12 weeks,</p>
<p>three of those five workouts per week</p>
<p>emphasize strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>and the other two emphasize endurance.</p>
<p>Then after 10 or 12 weeks,</p>
<p>one switches over to a 10 or 12 week regimen</p>
<p>of doing a three to two ratio</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re prioritizing endurance work.</p>
<p>So primarily the sorts of workouts</p>
<p>that are described in the endurance episode</p>
<p>and those protocols and the other two days,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re focusing on strength and hypertrophy work</p>
<p>merely to maintain strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>to not lose the strength and hypertrophy that you&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of data now supporting the fact</p>
<p>that maintaining muscular health and bone health</p>
<p>is supported by resistance training,</p>
<p>weight training of various kinds.</p>
<p>It can also be done with body weight</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have access to equipment.</p>
<p>And of course that doing cardiovascular endurance work</p>
<p>is very beneficial both to the muscles of the body,</p>
<p>the organs of the body, but also to the brain.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard</p>
<p>that doing physical exercise of various kinds</p>
<p>can support the production of new neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>Frankly, those data are specific to research animals.</p>
<p>As far as we know,</p>
<p>increases in neuron number are not supported</p>
<p>by exercise in humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of data that supports</p>
<p>that maybe a few neurons might get created</p>
<p>by running or weightlifting or things of that sort</p>
<p>in human beings.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still a host of other reasons</p>
<p>to have this hour or so per day</p>
<p>where one is doing physical exercise.</p>
<p>And those include increased blood flow to the brain.</p>
<p>Remember, the brain is an organ too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most metabolically demanding organ in your body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s receiving those metabolic factors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s receiving its fuels by way of vasculature,</p>
<p>of blood vessels and capillaries and veins</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So movement is very crucial</p>
<p>to get your brain to function properly.</p>
<p>Movement of various kinds is very important</p>
<p>to get your brain to function properly.</p>
<p>Resistance training turns out to be as important</p>
<p>as endurance training because of the way</p>
<p>that it stimulates the release of particular hormones,</p>
<p>actually from bones, things like osteocalcin,</p>
<p>which can positively impact brain function</p>
<p>and can support the health of existing neurons</p>
<p>as opposed to increasing the number of neurons.</p>
<p>Turns out increasing the number of neurons</p>
<p>may not actually be as beneficial as we think.</p>
<p>It all sounds great.</p>
<p>More neurons, more neurons.</p>
<p>Certainly more neurons is better than fewer neurons</p>
<p>and losing neurons.</p>
<p>But incorporating new neurons into existing brain circuitry</p>
<p>is actually very challenging for the brain to do.</p>
<p>I make sure that after that workout,</p>
<p>I get this one hour or so of exercise five days per week</p>
<p>because of the ways that it supports my general health.</p>
<p>And there are now hundreds of studies</p>
<p>supporting the fact that both endurance work</p>
<p>and strength training or hypertrophy training</p>
<p>done in combination,</p>
<p>meaning not necessarily in the same workout,</p>
<p>but done across the week is immensely beneficial</p>
<p>for the production of things</p>
<p>like brain-derived nootrophic factor,</p>
<p>for limiting inflammatory cytokines like IL-6,</p>
<p>for promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10,</p>
<p>provided that exercise is of the proper duration</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s not so intense</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re actually creating damage</p>
<p>to the various systems of the body.</p>
<p>Now, where is the threshold</p>
<p>between optimal sub-threshold and detrimental?</p>
<p>This is a complicated theme</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t put some structure around it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s put a little bit of structure around it.</p>
<p>We already said that about 60 minutes,</p>
<p>so 60 minutes plus or minus 15 minutes</p>
<p>is going to be optimal for all these health benefits.</p>
<p>What about the structure of the actual workouts?</p>
<p>Well, we need to address this issue of intensity.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb based on the literature,</p>
<p>and I discussed this with Dr. Andy Galpin</p>
<p>prior to the strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>and endurance episodes,</p>
<p>and the literature that&rsquo;s published</p>
<p>in quality peer-reviewed journals</p>
<p>really points to the fact that approximately 80%</p>
<p>of the resistance training you do</p>
<p>should be resistance training</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t go to what they call failure,</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t actually move the resistance anymore.</p>
<p>The other 20% can be of the higher intensity</p>
<p>to failure type training.</p>
<p>Now, with respect to endurance work,</p>
<p>one can build up endurance</p>
<p>without having to log long, long mileage</p>
<p>or extensive mileage in the pool or by running,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because there are these other forms of endurance</p>
<p>that can build up, for instance,</p>
<p>the capillary beds within the muscles.</p>
<p>Building up the capillary beds within the muscles</p>
<p>will allow more oxygen utilization within the muscles,</p>
<p>and thereby will increase your endurance,</p>
<p>both of the muscles,</p>
<p>but also will improve brain metabolism</p>
<p>and the way that the heart functions</p>
<p>or cardiovascular function.</p>
<p>That 80-20 rule of less than failure</p>
<p>and work to failure in the resistance exercise regime</p>
<p>can be transported or translated</p>
<p>to the endurance exercise portion</p>
<p>by focusing on that thing that we&rsquo;re familiar with,</p>
<p>which is the burn.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re running hard or cycling hard,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll experience a kind of burning of the muscles</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with the lactate system.</p>
<p>During the episode on endurance,</p>
<p>I pointed out that that burn is not lactic acid.</p>
<p>Contrary to common belief, it is not lactic acid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with lactate metabolism,</p>
<p>and again, about 80% of the endurance work</p>
<p>should not incorporate that so-called burn,</p>
<p>but if 20% of that work or so,</p>
<p>I should say approximately 20% of that work</p>
<p>does include that so-called burning sensation,</p>
<p>that burning sensation actually triggers the activation</p>
<p>of release of certain compounds and molecules from glia,</p>
<p>this brain cell type that supports neuron health,</p>
<p>and actually the lactate system</p>
<p>is its own form of fuel for the brain,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s increasing interest</p>
<p>in generating the lactate</p>
<p>or pushing past that lactate threshold</p>
<p>for small portions, 20% or so, of endurance work</p>
<p>in order to support brain health and function.</p>
<p>So what does this all look like as a protocol?</p>
<p>Well, as I mentioned before, this three to two ratio,</p>
<p>so maybe you spend 10 weeks or so or 12 weeks or so</p>
<p>focusing mainly on endurance work,</p>
<p>three workouts per week on endurance work,</p>
<p>80% of those workouts,</p>
<p>meaning 80% of the time you&rsquo;re below that burn threshold,</p>
<p>you are not experiencing a burning sensation,</p>
<p>but that for 20% of it, you are,</p>
<p>that based on the scientific data</p>
<p>should support lactate metabolism, brain health, et cetera,</p>
<p>as well as cardiovascular health and oxygen utilization,</p>
<p>all the forms of endurance that we&rsquo;re aware of,</p>
<p>and then the other two workouts</p>
<p>would involve resistance training,</p>
<p>again, with this 80-20 split,</p>
<p>where 80% of the work is not to failure and 20% is,</p>
<p>and then maybe after 10, 12 weeks, you switch,</p>
<p>where you start emphasizing strength and hypertrophy work</p>
<p>for three of the workouts</p>
<p>and endurance work for two of the workouts.</p>
<p>Now, of course, some of you will be able</p>
<p>to train six days a week</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ll compulsively need to train seven days a week.</p>
<p>If you decide to do that,</p>
<p>please be aware that this cortisol threshold</p>
<p>is a real thing.</p>
<p>So for me, the three-to-two ratio works out perfectly</p>
<p>because I like two full days off a week.</p>
<p>When I take those really depends on my schedule</p>
<p>and how I&rsquo;m feeling.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s two days in a row.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re interspersed throughout the week,</p>
<p>but in reviewing the scientific literature</p>
<p>for those two episodes of the podcast</p>
<p>and in talking to people who are really informed</p>
<p>in the world of resistance training and endurance training</p>
<p>and how that relates to brain health and body health,</p>
<p>this seems to be the most rational and grounded protocol.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the one that I follow.</p>
<p>So on any given day, I finish that work block and I train.</p>
<p>I do some sort of resistance or endurance training.</p>
<p>I put those on alternate days or different days rather.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve now talked about the arc</p>
<p>that spans all the way from waking</p>
<p>to a morning bout of focused work to physical training.</p>
<p>I have not mentioned ingesting anything or nutrients.</p>
<p>One of the most common questions I get</p>
<p>are what should I eat for my brain?</p>
<p>Well, ironically enough, one of the best things you can do</p>
<p>for your brain is do not eat.</p>
<p>But of course we all have to eat sooner or later</p>
<p>and eating is wonderful.</p>
<p>I absolutely love eating.</p>
<p>I even enjoy the mere act of chewing.</p>
<p>But the question of what to eat is an important one</p>
<p>as it relates to brain health and brain function.</p>
<p>Before we talk about that,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that training fasted</p>
<p>actually has some immediate and long-term benefits.</p>
<p>Prior to having my lab at Stanford,</p>
<p>I was down in San Diego at UC San Diego</p>
<p>and had an appointment</p>
<p>at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies.</p>
<p>I had a colleague there by the name of Sachin Panda.</p>
<p>He wrote a wonderful book called The Circadian Code.</p>
<p>He runs a serious biology laboratory</p>
<p>focusing on metabolism, circadian rhythms and so forth,</p>
<p>as well as the effects of fasting.</p>
<p>Sachin and his book, The Circadian Code,</p>
<p>describe how engaging in physical exercise</p>
<p>while fasted can amplify the effects of that exercise,</p>
<p>not just for sake of increasing the percentage</p>
<p>of things like body fat burned, et cetera,</p>
<p>but for cellar health, liver health</p>
<p>and the health of other organs.</p>
<p>So where possible, I do strive to do my workout</p>
<p>without eating anything first.</p>
<p>However, some days I&rsquo;m very, very hungry.</p>
<p>And so I do ingest water, which contains electrolytes.</p>
<p>So that means sodium, magnesium, potassium</p>
<p>for the simple reason that sodium, magnesium, potassium</p>
<p>are required for neurons to function properly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the way they generate electrical activity.</p>
<p>As well, ingesting electrolytes for me can quell hunger.</p>
<p>And this points to a whole other topic</p>
<p>we could do another episode on at some point,</p>
<p>which is many times people think</p>
<p>that their blood sugar is low</p>
<p>and actually that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>And frankly, one wouldn&rsquo;t want their blood sugar to be high.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your blood sugar too low,</p>
<p>but you also don&rsquo;t want it too high.</p>
<p>Very low blood sugar is terrible,</p>
<p>but low-ish blood sugar tends to give us a sense</p>
<p>of mental clarity and focus related to this adrenaline</p>
<p>phenomenon that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>In order to be able to focus on exercise or work</p>
<p>or anything else, you need sufficient electrolytes.</p>
<p>And so many people find that if they simply ingest</p>
<p>some water with salt, maybe a 99 milligram potassium tablet,</p>
<p>all of a sudden they feel very mentally clear</p>
<p>and able to do physical work and mental work.</p>
<p>So what I do is prior to this morning exercise,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s now late morning in this way I&rsquo;m describing it</p>
<p>and typically it does occur late morning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have some water with either,</p>
<p>so maybe half a teaspoon of sea salt</p>
<p>with a 99 milligram potassium tablet,</p>
<p>or these days I&rsquo;m fond of taking what&rsquo;s called Element,</p>
<p>L-M-N-T, Element.</p>
<p>I learned about this from Lex Friedman&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>I know many of you are familiar with Lex.</p>
<p>Excellent podcast, excellent scientist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any business relationship to Element.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not a sponsor of the podcast,</p>
<p>but Element is a product that essentially contains</p>
<p>electrolytes, sodium, potassium,</p>
<p>as well as magnesium malate, which has been shown</p>
<p>to offset things like delayed onset muscle soreness.</p>
<p>That form of magnesium doesn&rsquo;t make people drowsy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an anxiolytic like some other forms of magnesium.</p>
<p>An anxiolytic is just one that reduces anxiety.</p>
<p>So whether or not it&rsquo;s Element or whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just putting a little bit of salt into some water</p>
<p>and ingesting that prior to training,</p>
<p>that can be an excellent way to ensure that you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to complete the physical exercise</p>
<p>even though you haven&rsquo;t eaten anything.</p>
<p>And I confess some days I will eat a little bit</p>
<p>before my workout just because I can&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to resist eating.</p>
<p>I want to mention the use of stimulants</p>
<p>before physical training.</p>
<p>This has certain benefits and certain drawbacks.</p>
<p>The benefits are sometimes it can facilitate motivation</p>
<p>because things like caffeine can increase the release</p>
<p>of dopamine, can increase the release of epinephrine,</p>
<p>can reduce that adenosine level in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>So some people use caffeine before training</p>
<p>in ways that benefit them.</p>
<p>It can also increase fat oxidation</p>
<p>and kind of fat metabolism and things if that&rsquo;s your goal.</p>
<p>I am not a particular fan of ingesting stimulants</p>
<p>before training because of a whole set of problems</p>
<p>associated with most forms of stimulants</p>
<p>in the form of energy drinks, et cetera.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of energy drinks.</p>
<p>I did a decent portion of a previous episode</p>
<p>on food and mood, on energy drinks</p>
<p>and some of the detrimental things they contain.</p>
<p>Rather, I try and train simply by ingesting</p>
<p>the caffeine sources I mentioned before,</p>
<p>guayusa, mate, some electrolytes, some water.</p>
<p>Occasionally I&rsquo;ll have an espresso or a cup of coffee</p>
<p>before I train.</p>
<p>And on rare occasions, I should emphasize rare occasions,</p>
<p>if I really need help increasing my motivation</p>
<p>or I decide I want to push extremely hard,</p>
<p>I will ingest something like alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>Alpha-GPC supports the release of a neuromodulator</p>
<p>called acetylcholine.</p>
<p>So 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC has been shown</p>
<p>to increase physical performance,</p>
<p>but also cognitive performance.</p>
<p>Some people might not be interested in ingesting</p>
<p>anything to improve their physical performance</p>
<p>or anything at all, but they might be addressing</p>
<p>how they can improve cognitive performance and focus.</p>
<p>And alpha-GPC is a non-stimulant way to approach that.</p>
<p>Again, definitely check with your doctor</p>
<p>before taking anything or stopping to take anything,</p>
<p>but alpha-GPC has been shown in various studies</p>
<p>to improve cognitive performance.</p>
<p>And in people who have age-related cognitive decline,</p>
<p>there have been some positive benefits reported</p>
<p>in quality peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>If you want to explore those references,</p>
<p>please go to examine.com, please put in alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>go to the Human Effect Matrix,</p>
<p>and there you can find details of those studies,</p>
<p>references to PubMed, et cetera.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about food timing first.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I eat my first meal sometime around noon,</p>
<p>plus or minus an hour, for the reasons we&rsquo;ve discussed.</p>
<p>The volume of food is also important.</p>
<p>If you eat a large volume of anything,</p>
<p>because it diverts blood to your gut,</p>
<p>you will feel lethargic,</p>
<p>and you will have less blood going to your brain.</p>
<p>That seems like a simple and trivial fact,</p>
<p>but if you want to be able to think,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t ingest large volumes of anything into your gut.</p>
<p>So the discussion about what foods give you energy</p>
<p>is kind of moot if you eat enormous volumes of that food.</p>
<p>Now, the volumes are going to depend on you</p>
<p>and your needs and your activity levels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to discuss what I do in terms of food content,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to discuss food volume.</p>
<p>I sort of know where that mostly full,</p>
<p>like 80% full line is,</p>
<p>and I usually eat a little bit past that, frankly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m able to maintain a decent degree of alertness</p>
<p>into the afternoon, and that&rsquo;s my goal.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the goal of most people,</p>
<p>to not work out in the morning or do some work</p>
<p>and then just collapse into a slumber</p>
<p>that lasts all afternoon,</p>
<p>but to be able to generate alert,</p>
<p>calm, focused states throughout the day.</p>
<p>So for lunch, I do emphasize slightly lower carbohydrate</p>
<p>or low carbohydrate intake,</p>
<p>for the simple reason that adrenaline and dopamine</p>
<p>and their associated neuromodulators</p>
<p>are going to support alertness.</p>
<p>So for me, I fast up until about noon.</p>
<p>Then I eat a lunch that consists</p>
<p>of some sort of protein thing,</p>
<p>like some meat or some chicken or some salmon</p>
<p>and some vegetables, et cetera.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;ve exercised previously,</p>
<p>which I do, as I mentioned, five days a week,</p>
<p>then I will ingest some starches.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ingest some bread or rice or oatmeal</p>
<p>and butter and nuts and things like that.</p>
<p>I will consume the various food groups, as they say,</p>
<p>but I will keep the total amount of carbohydrate</p>
<p>a little bit on the low side,</p>
<p>or if I haven&rsquo;t trained,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t have any carbohydrate at all.</p>
<p>Not because I&rsquo;m ketogenic,</p>
<p>not because I&rsquo;m anti-carbohydrate,</p>
<p>not because I&rsquo;m on a pure carnivore diet, far from it,</p>
<p>but because starches cause the release</p>
<p>of serotonin in the brain</p>
<p>and lend themselves to a state of sleepiness.</p>
<p>Now, I should mention that about 25% of individuals</p>
<p>have genes that encode for enzymes</p>
<p>that allow them to eat large amounts of carbohydrate</p>
<p>and not suffer from this lethargy,</p>
<p>this kind of sedation from carbohydrates,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have that gene.</p>
<p>And so for me, eating a noon-ish meal</p>
<p>that is not enormous, but is decent in size,</p>
<p>but that is mainly protein, healthy fats,</p>
<p>and low-ish carbohydrates or no carbohydrates</p>
<p>is what allows me to achieve heightened states</p>
<p>of alertness throughout the day,</p>
<p>which is what I need for my purposes.</p>
<p>So just knowing that meats and nuts support alertness,</p>
<p>provided you don&rsquo;t eat too much of them,</p>
<p>that vegetables are healthy for us,</p>
<p>and therefore we should eat them,</p>
<p>and I happen to like them as well,</p>
<p>and that carbohydrates tend to have</p>
<p>a kind of sedative-like quality to them,</p>
<p>that should help you kind of guide your food choices</p>
<p>in an intelligent way that&rsquo;s grounded</p>
<p>in the scientific literature as it relates to alertness.</p>
<p>Now, what about components of foods</p>
<p>that are not about alertness, but are about mood?</p>
<p>We did an entire episode on mood and food,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very clear, based on now dozens of studies,</p>
<p>that ingesting sufficient levels of omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>is going to support healthy mood</p>
<p>and even can act as an antidepressant.</p>
<p>More than a dozen studies have shown</p>
<p>that ingesting at least 1,000 milligrams per day</p>
<p>of the EPA form of essential fatty acid</p>
<p>is as effective as prescription antidepressants</p>
<p>in relieving depression.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who requires prescription antidepressants,</p>
<p>Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera,</p>
<p>it can allow people to take lower doses of those medications,</p>
<p>which in many cases is a positive thing</p>
<p>or a good thing to do because of the side effect profiles</p>
<p>that many of those drugs carry.</p>
<p>So I find these data remarkably compelling.</p>
<p>I mean, here we have a food or a substance from food</p>
<p>that can improve our mood and our sense of well-being,</p>
<p>and it does that by way of increasing</p>
<p>certain neuromodulators in the brain,</p>
<p>in particular dopamine,</p>
<p>but also some other related neuromodulators.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re eating fatty salmon regularly,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re eating krill regularly,</p>
<p>meaning if you&rsquo;re a whale,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ingesting foods</p>
<p>that tend to have a lot of omega-3s,</p>
<p>you probably don&rsquo;t need to supplement with omega-3.</p>
<p>Most people are not ingesting sufficient levels</p>
<p>of omega-3s, and I&rsquo;m certainly one of those people.</p>
<p>Despite an effort to eat good foods and whole foods,</p>
<p>et cetera, and unprocessed foods,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made the choice to ingest</p>
<p>at least 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA.</p>
<p>I do that in the form of fish oil</p>
<p>and EPA, DHA combination fish oil,</p>
<p>but the threshold of 1,000 milligrams</p>
<p>is not 1,000 milligrams of fish oil,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 1,000 milligrams of EPA.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that don&rsquo;t want to consume fish oils</p>
<p>and prefer to get your omega-3s from non-animal sources,</p>
<p>there are non-animal sources,</p>
<p>various forms of algae, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can just look that up online,</p>
<p>and you should be able to find that.</p>
<p>There are also a number of foods</p>
<p>that include these essential omega-3s.</p>
<p>We did an episode on food and mood</p>
<p>where I go into more detail than you could ever want on that</p>
<p>as well as some additional recommendations.</p>
<p>We also did an episode on thyroid function,</p>
<p>this hormone that&rsquo;s important for metabolism,</p>
<p>and that pointed to the importance</p>
<p>of getting sufficient iodine,</p>
<p>which you should naturally get from the salts</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ingesting provided you&rsquo;re ingesting enough salt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not somebody who eats a lot of kelp or seaweed,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t mind the taste of seaweed,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ingest it regularly,</p>
<p>but ingesting sufficient selenium or selenium</p>
<p>has been shown to be important</p>
<p>for proper thyroid production and thyroid function,</p>
<p>which is why I tend to eat a few Brazil nuts each day,</p>
<p>typically with my lunch or sometimes before my workout.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>The point is that the volume, the amount, the content,</p>
<p>and indeed the ratios of protein to fat to carbohydrates</p>
<p>are going to impact how you feel,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to impact your brain health.</p>
<p>And of course, the timing.</p>
<p>We know that allowing periods of 12 hours or more</p>
<p>each 24-hour cycle where you&rsquo;re not ingesting anything</p>
<p>is beneficial for your brain and body health.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Sachin Panda and his colleagues&rsquo; work</p>
<p>has shown over and over again in these quality studies.</p>
<p>So when people ask me, what should I eat for my brain?</p>
<p>More often than not, it&rsquo;s really a question</p>
<p>of how you&rsquo;re structuring your day,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re eating for the first time,</p>
<p>how long you&rsquo;re allowing yourself to fast each 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>and also whether or not you&rsquo;re getting sufficient omega-3s,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re getting sufficient selenium</p>
<p>to support things like thyroid function,</p>
<p>which has an impact both on the metabolism of the body,</p>
<p>but also the metabolism in the brain.</p>
<p>And when I say metabolism, I don&rsquo;t just mean burning energy,</p>
<p>I actually mean the rebuilding of things.</p>
<p>So in the episode on growth hormone and thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>we talked about how metabolism means</p>
<p>not just the breakdown of fats and carbohydrates,</p>
<p>but also the building up, the repair of muscle tissue,</p>
<p>the repair of bone, the reinforcing of bone,</p>
<p>and the repair and the buildup of brain tissue.</p>
<p>And so those are the things that I emphasize</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so strongly supported</p>
<p>by the scientific data done in mice,</p>
<p>studies done in humans,</p>
<p>and basically there&rsquo;s a lot of biochemical evidence</p>
<p>that supports everything that I just described.</p>
<p>Along the lines of health and wellbeing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention hormones.</p>
<p>Hormones have broad effects on the body and brain.</p>
<p>We did an entire month on hormones.</p>
<p>If you want to hear about any of those hormones in detail,</p>
<p>we talked about testosterone</p>
<p>and optimizing testosterone, estrogen, et cetera.</p>
<p>The sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>which include testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>which of course are present in varying ratios,</p>
<p>but in both men and women and in kids,</p>
<p>they are manufactured from cholesterol.</p>
<p>We hear about cholesterol as this terrible thing,</p>
<p>but they are actually made from cholesterol.</p>
<p>And so if you don&rsquo;t get sufficient levels of cholesterol,</p>
<p>that can be problematic for your hormones,</p>
<p>and that can be problematic</p>
<p>for your brain and your body health.</p>
<p>So without going into too much detail,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just point to a couple of things that I do</p>
<p>that at least from my blood work</p>
<p>and from my subjective experience</p>
<p>have been very beneficial for me</p>
<p>that some of you might want to consider.</p>
<p>First of all, I am not shy about my love for butter.</p>
<p>I will eat pats of butter directly.</p>
<p>I believe if people are going to eat cheese without a cracker,</p>
<p>I will eat butter without a cracker.</p>
<p>Butter is high in cholesterol,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t eat a ton of it,</p>
<p>but at least for me and for my lipid profiles, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Butter has cholesterol,</p>
<p>which is a precursor to the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>and men and women need testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>in order to feel good and to be able to think.</p>
<p>You do not want your estrogen too low</p>
<p>or your testosterone too low.</p>
<p>So I eat butter in order to ensure</p>
<p>that I get sufficient cholesterol.</p>
<p>Butter also has some other things that are beneficial,</p>
<p>various small fatty acids that are interesting</p>
<p>in terms of their effects on metabolism, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can look those up, the benefits of butter.</p>
<p>But again, volume is important and you can&rsquo;t overdo it.</p>
<p>Costello, incidentally, loves butter as well.</p>
<p>Along the lines of hormones and testosterone,</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions about this, I think,</p>
<p>because a lot of online communities</p>
<p>are sort of obsessed with testosterone.</p>
<p>And I just want to emphasize that, yes,</p>
<p>having sufficient levels of testosterone</p>
<p>is vitally important for brain function</p>
<p>and having sufficient levels of estrogen</p>
<p>will allow your brain to actually function.</p>
<p>It turns out that estrogen is one of the main ways</p>
<p>in which the brain maintains longevity</p>
<p>and maintains its ability to think.</p>
<p>So we should all be seeking optimal testosterone levels</p>
<p>for ourselves, both testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>And many of the things that we&rsquo;ve discussed up until now,</p>
<p>morning sunlight, exercise, fasting,</p>
<p>those can support testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>in meaningful and positive ways.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions about hormone optimization.</p>
<p>We did an entire month on this topic.</p>
<p>We did an entire episode</p>
<p>on testosterone and estrogen optimization.</p>
<p>I just want to briefly highlight two things</p>
<p>that could be relevant.</p>
<p>And then if you want more details,</p>
<p>please go see that episode.</p>
<p>The first is that testosterone</p>
<p>can exert its various functions</p>
<p>only in its unbound form, free testosterone.</p>
<p>We all make a particular binding protein</p>
<p>called sex hormone binding globulin</p>
<p>that essentially binds up testosterone,</p>
<p>prevents it from being free.</p>
<p>This sounds like a terrible thing,</p>
<p>but actually it&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>because it allows testosterone to be transported</p>
<p>to the various tissues, including the brain,</p>
<p>where it can exert its various functions.</p>
<p>For those that have lower than desired levels of testosterone</p>
<p>or too much sex hormone binding globulin,</p>
<p>it turns out that 400 milligrams per day</p>
<p>of something called Tongat Ali,</p>
<p>which is a form of ginseng,</p>
<p>can actually help increase levels of free testosterone.</p>
<p>Many people experience a positive subjective effect</p>
<p>and some objective effects as well,</p>
<p>meaning increases in free testosterone</p>
<p>when they do blood analysis.</p>
<p>There are some data on that,</p>
<p>not a ton in the peer-reviewed literatures.</p>
<p>And again, always approach these with a sense of caution</p>
<p>and definitely talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about that,</p>
<p>you can go to examine.com.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of information there listed about that.</p>
<p>The other compound that&rsquo;s relevant both to men and women,</p>
<p>or I should say people</p>
<p>that are trying to optimize testosterone and or estrogen</p>
<p>is Fidogia.</p>
<p>Fidogia agrestis is actually an herb</p>
<p>that increases the levels of what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>Luteinizing hormone is a hormone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released from the hypothalamus within the brain</p>
<p>that travels to the gonads,</p>
<p>either the ovaries or the testes,</p>
<p>to stimulate the release of estrogen or testosterone.</p>
<p>And Fidogia agrestis has been shown,</p>
<p>albeit in a limited number of studies,</p>
<p>to increase levels of luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and thereby levels of testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>in ways that some people find beneficial.</p>
<p>So I just want to mention those two.</p>
<p>And again, if you want a lot more information</p>
<p>about hormone optimization,</p>
<p>please see the episodes on hormone optimization.</p>
<p>A key aspect to the midday meal,</p>
<p>if you want that meal to benefit you,</p>
<p>is to take a brief walk afterwards.</p>
<p>It turns out that brief walks of five to 30 minutes</p>
<p>after ingesting food can accelerate metabolism</p>
<p>and actually can accelerate and improve nutrient utilization,</p>
<p>which is essentially the same as metabolism.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, that&rsquo;s something that I do</p>
<p>after I finish my noon meal.</p>
<p>I do force myself to stand up and go outside</p>
<p>and take a brief walk.</p>
<p>That also gets me again into optic flow.</p>
<p>It also has another benefit,</p>
<p>which is that I am giving my brain</p>
<p>and thereby my body more information</p>
<p>about light and time of day,</p>
<p>which is always better than less information</p>
<p>about light and time of day.</p>
<p>Much of our circadian rhythm and our health rhythms</p>
<p>and all of our cognitive rhythms, et cetera,</p>
<p>are supported by our cells knowing where they are in time.</p>
<p>And light is the primary zeitgeber,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s German for timekeeper,</p>
<p>is the primary way in which the body learns information</p>
<p>about what function should be turned on</p>
<p>and what function should be turned off.</p>
<p>So getting that morning light pulse,</p>
<p>but then also leaving the house or apartment or workplace</p>
<p>and getting out for a few minutes after lunch</p>
<p>is beneficial for metabolism,</p>
<p>beneficial for nutrient utilization,</p>
<p>and beneficial for all the organs and tissues of the body</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting that outside light exposure.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to shift our attention</p>
<p>towards science-supported protocols</p>
<p>that increase the effectiveness</p>
<p>and our performance in everything.</p>
<p>And by everything I mean sleep, I mean physical performance,</p>
<p>I mean mental performance, I mean less anxiety,</p>
<p>all the things, truly all the things.</p>
<p>And that is something called non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>Non-sleep deep rest or NSDR is an acronym that I coined</p>
<p>as an umbrella term to encompass many protocols</p>
<p>that all have been shown in one form or another</p>
<p>to support better brain and body function.</p>
<p>Now these protocols have names that you&rsquo;ve heard before,</p>
<p>things like meditation, things like yoga nidra,</p>
<p>and things like hypnosis.</p>
<p>All of these protocols and these activities, however,</p>
<p>share something in common,</p>
<p>which is they involve a deliberate</p>
<p>and directed shift in one state.</p>
<p>And the shift tends to be toward</p>
<p>a state of deeper relaxation.</p>
<p>We certainly don&rsquo;t have time now</p>
<p>to dissect out the literature on all of these.</p>
<p>There is ample literature.</p>
<p>I should say there is robust and ample literature</p>
<p>supporting the fact that a regular meditation practice</p>
<p>is beneficial.</p>
<p>But meditation itself has many forms,</p>
<p>transcendental meditation, loving kindness meditation,</p>
<p>third eye meditation, walking meditation.</p>
<p>Yoga nidra is a practice I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>many times before, which involves simply lying down.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t involve any movement,</p>
<p>no down dogs or up dogs or anything.</p>
<p>It just involves lying on your back</p>
<p>and doing some specific long exhale breathing.</p>
<p>There are a lot of yoga nidra scripts out there</p>
<p>that are quite good,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s one NSDR type protocol</p>
<p>that has been shown by the greatest number</p>
<p>of scientific studies to promote</p>
<p>not just states of deep relaxation,</p>
<p>not just states of heightened focus,</p>
<p>but also to accelerate plasticity</p>
<p>and learning within the brain, and that&rsquo;s hypnosis.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve become increasingly excited</p>
<p>and interested in hypnosis as a tool,</p>
<p>and not just a tool of any kind,</p>
<p>but a tool that really can be directed</p>
<p>toward particular goals and outcomes.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really what sets hypnosis apart</p>
<p>as an NSDR, non-sleep depressed protocol,</p>
<p>from things like naps or things like yoga nidra</p>
<p>or things like meditation.</p>
<p>And I certainly believe and understand</p>
<p>that meditation naps and yoga nidra</p>
<p>can be directed toward less anxiety, et cetera,</p>
<p>but hypnosis is unique in that it&rsquo;s very directed.</p>
<p>Very directed.</p>
<p>The essence of hypnosis is for the person, you,</p>
<p>to guide your brain toward a particular outcome or change.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to point out a particular resource.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely zero cost resource,</p>
<p>which is reveri.com.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s R-E-V-E-R-I.com.</p>
<p>Reveri.com, obviously, is a website</p>
<p>where there are links to an app</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s available in Apple and Android.</p>
<p>This is a hypnosis app,</p>
<p>but this isn&rsquo;t just any hypnosis app.</p>
<p>This is a hypnosis app</p>
<p>that contains multiple hypnosis protocols</p>
<p>that are all backed by very high quality science.</p>
<p>The science was done by my colleague</p>
<p>and our associate chair of psychiatry</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine,</p>
<p>that David Spiegel is responsible for that work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not associated with that scientific work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve examined what brain areas</p>
<p>get activated during hypnosis,</p>
<p>what the outcomes are for various hypnosis protocols.</p>
<p>And within Reveri, you will find hypnosis protocols</p>
<p>for enhancing your focus, enhancing creativity,</p>
<p>reducing pain, getting better at sleeping, reducing anxiety.</p>
<p>Most of these are about 10 or 15 minutes long.</p>
<p>Some of them are extremely brief, one minute long.</p>
<p>They have a one minute hypnosis that you can do.</p>
<p>Those one minute hypnosis scripts work best</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been doing the 10 and 15 minute ones</p>
<p>regularly or semi-regularly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really wonderful resource</p>
<p>for which there is a lot of peer-reviewed published data.</p>
<p>One study I&rsquo;d like to emphasize in particular</p>
<p>is Jiang et al, J-I-A-N-G.</p>
<p>That is a reference you can find</p>
<p>on the reveri.com website under our research.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper is</p>
<p>Brain Activity and Functional Connectivity</p>
<p>Associated with Hypnosis.</p>
<p>And it was published in the journal Cerebral Cortex.</p>
<p>What this paper essentially shows</p>
<p>is that specific areas of our brain</p>
<p>that are involved in executive function,</p>
<p>which is associated with our ability to focus,</p>
<p>as well as what&rsquo;s called the default mode network,</p>
<p>which is sort of the way that your brain idles.</p>
<p>Does your brain tend to idle</p>
<p>at a level of high anxiety or calm,</p>
<p>as well as activation of a brain area called the insula.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s I-N-S-U-L-A.</p>
<p>The insula is extremely interesting.</p>
<p>Hypnosis has been shown to activate the insula,</p>
<p>which can enhance our sense of interoception,</p>
<p>our sense of internal state,</p>
<p>which might sound like a annoying thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be thinking about your heartbeat</p>
<p>or your breathing.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really interesting about hypnosis</p>
<p>is that it increases areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are responsible for deep relaxation,</p>
<p>focus, and self-awareness,</p>
<p>this interoception, simultaneously.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very unusual compared to other states,</p>
<p>and other states of any kind.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve made it a practice, a daily practice, in fact,</p>
<p>that after lunch and after this walk,</p>
<p>I do a brief 10-minute hypnosis script.</p>
<p>Because of what I found is that in contrast to naps</p>
<p>and in contrast to other forms of NSDR,</p>
<p>it really allows me to enter a state of deep relaxation,</p>
<p>but also to then exit that state</p>
<p>in a very focused and deliberate way</p>
<p>that allows me to lean into my afternoon in an alert way,</p>
<p>in a way that I can function and do mental work</p>
<p>and interact with people, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no brain fog, there&rsquo;s no grogginess.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize that the hypnosis</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m referring to here, and that Reverie provides,</p>
<p>is not stage hypnosis.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t you being programmed to squawk like a chicken</p>
<p>or do anything against your will.</p>
<p>This is you teaching your brain how to access</p>
<p>these focused, relaxed, interoceptive states.</p>
<p>This is also an extremely valuable aspect to hypnosis</p>
<p>because it can increase plasticity,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially opening up pathways</p>
<p>that allow you to change your brain</p>
<p>in the ways that you want.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very directed toward particular outcomes.</p>
<p>So I am an, as you can probably tell,</p>
<p>I am very enthusiastic about hypnosis</p>
<p>as an optimal NSDR protocol.</p>
<p>And so I do that every single day.</p>
<p>There are days that I don&rsquo;t manage to do it</p>
<p>for whatever reason, I forget,</p>
<p>or interference from email or et cetera.</p>
<p>But that is essentially how I enter my early afternoon.</p>
<p>I do this post-lunch, post-walk NSDR</p>
<p>in the form of a Reverie hypnosis.</p>
<p>Again, a completely zero cost resource to you.</p>
<p>There are excellent data.</p>
<p>All those data can be found on the Reverie site.</p>
<p>And you can also learn a lot more about hypnosis</p>
<p>and what sorts of hypnosis protocols</p>
<p>might be optimal for you.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for a science-backed,</p>
<p>zero cost, very effective tool</p>
<p>for getting better at focusing,</p>
<p>better at sleeping, better at all the things</p>
<p>that I believe people want,</p>
<p>I do believe that is the best tool</p>
<p>that one can access at this point in time.</p>
<p>So then after I exit hypnosis,</p>
<p>usually give Costello a little scratch behind the ear,</p>
<p>and then I make sure that I hydrate.</p>
<p>Hydration, again, is vitally important for brain function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vitally important for all bodily functions.</p>
<p>And I often forget to do it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve just sort of linked the drinking of water</p>
<p>to my hypnosis practice.</p>
<p>As soon as I&rsquo;m done, I hydrate.</p>
<p>And then I tend to focus on another work about.</p>
<p>So this would be for me sometime around 2.30</p>
<p>or three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,</p>
<p>when normally I would be quite sleepy and passing out.</p>
<p>However, the protocol of shifting my morning caffeine</p>
<p>to 90 minutes, two hours after waking,</p>
<p>as well as the use of this hypnosis protocol</p>
<p>has really allowed me to move through the afternoon</p>
<p>in a way that I don&rsquo;t experience that dip in energy.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I&rsquo;ll feel kind of sleepy</p>
<p>or kind of out of it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been really pleasantly surprised</p>
<p>at the extent to which one can avoid that afternoon dip</p>
<p>if you do certain things properly</p>
<p>prior to the arrival of 2 or 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re a napper and you want to nap, no big deal.</p>
<p>Naps can be wonderfully beneficial.</p>
<p>Here are the rules around napping</p>
<p>according to the sleep science.</p>
<p>Stanford has an excellent sleep clinic.</p>
<p>I consulted with Jamie Zeitzer,</p>
<p>my colleague in the Stanford Sleep Laboratory,</p>
<p>as well as Matt Walker out at Berkeley,</p>
<p>whose name I&rsquo;m sure most of you are familiar with,</p>
<p>wrote this wonderful book, Why We Sleep.</p>
<p>Naps should be 90 minutes or less</p>
<p>and 20 minute naps are fine,</p>
<p>but not longer than 90 minutes.</p>
<p>And there are essentially two varieties of people,</p>
<p>people for whom napping interferes</p>
<p>with falling asleep later that night and staying asleep,</p>
<p>and people for whom the nap does not interfere.</p>
<p>You have to decide who you are.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody who can nap</p>
<p>and not have any trouble falling asleep</p>
<p>and staying asleep later that night,</p>
<p>well, by all means, nap.</p>
<p>Just make it 90 minutes or less.</p>
<p>Again, these 90 minute cycles are really a vital constraint</p>
<p>that we should all obey.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s 91 minutes, don&rsquo;t worry,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t dissolve into a puddle of tears,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re starting to sleep for an hour</p>
<p>or more in the afternoon, that can be problematic.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who can nap for 10, 20 minutes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably better than getting a full 90 minute cycle</p>
<p>unless you didn&rsquo;t get enough sleep the night before.</p>
<p>But you really have to figure out what&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of variety there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s essentially what the science says.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not you nap or whether or not</p>
<p>you do not nap, a key protocol for sleep health</p>
<p>and wakefulness and metabolism and hormone health</p>
<p>is viewing light in the afternoon.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the reason for doing this.</p>
<p>As we progress into the evening hours,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a phenomenon where our retina, our eyes,</p>
<p>become very sensitive to light,</p>
<p>such that if we view bright lights</p>
<p>or even not so bright lights</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>that is strongly disruptive, very disruptive</p>
<p>for our dopamine production.</p>
<p>It can really screw up our sleep.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually been shown in data</p>
<p>from David Bersin&rsquo;s lab at Brown University,</p>
<p>one of the foremost circadian biology laboratories,</p>
<p>as well as Samur Tar&rsquo;s laboratory</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health,</p>
<p>that viewing bright light or even not so bright light</p>
<p>between these hours of 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>or even 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. can disrupt learning and memory,</p>
<p>can disrupt the immune system,</p>
<p>and can disrupt mood in very long-lasting ways.</p>
<p>There are ways to offset that, however,</p>
<p>what I call your Netflix inoculation.</p>
<p>For those of you that like to stay up late on the tablet</p>
<p>or computer or watching Netflix,</p>
<p>getting a little bit of afternoon light in your eyes</p>
<p>somewhat counterintuitively can prevent this disruption</p>
<p>of bright light later in the evening at least somewhat.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, if you view light as the sun is starting to go down,</p>
<p>so if you step outside around 4 p.m., 5 p.m. again,</p>
<p>what time exactly will depend on time of year</p>
<p>and where you are located on our planet.</p>
<p>But as the sun starts to head down,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to see the sunset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be lovely if you could.</p>
<p>Sunsets are beautiful.</p>
<p>But if you can get outside and see the sun as it arcs down,</p>
<p>or if you can&rsquo;t see the sun directly,</p>
<p>get some sunlight in your eyes in the afternoon hours,</p>
<p>so maybe 4 p.m. ish, and do that for 20, 30 minutes,</p>
<p>maybe reading outside or taking a walk.</p>
<p>I walk the dog again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my protocol in order to get that evening light.</p>
<p>What it does is it lowers the sensitivity of your retina</p>
<p>in the late evening hours,</p>
<p>which allows you to buffer yourself</p>
<p>against the negative effects of bright light later at night.</p>
<p>Now, it won&rsquo;t allow you to blast your eyes with bright light.</p>
<p>You still need to dim the lights in the evening.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a very nice study</p>
<p>that was published in Scientific Reports</p>
<p>that illustrates that if one does this,</p>
<p>if you go outside and view sunlight in the evening hours</p>
<p>for anywhere from five to 30 minutes,</p>
<p>and I realize that people have a range</p>
<p>of constraints on their schedule,</p>
<p>but from five to 30 minutes,</p>
<p>what happens is that your melatonin rhythm</p>
<p>stays appropriate.</p>
<p>Now, we haven&rsquo;t talked too much about melatonin,</p>
<p>but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually prevented by light.</p>
<p>And melatonin is the hormone</p>
<p>that allows you to fall asleep easily.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not talking about supplementing melatonin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about melatonin</p>
<p>that you naturally produce from your pineal.</p>
<p>So the protocol is very simple.</p>
<p>Get outside in the afternoon or evening</p>
<p>for 10 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Take your sunglasses off, get some bright light,</p>
<p>get some natural light in your eyes.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>probably better to just stay</p>
<p>with standard artificial lights inside.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t crank them up, but just start to dim them.</p>
<p>Again, this would be a time to avoid blue blockers.</p>
<p>People are popping on blue blockers</p>
<p>at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re worried that blue light</p>
<p>is going to disrupt your sleep.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re making your eyes more sensitive</p>
<p>to any light that you might see later in the evening,</p>
<p>blue light or otherwise.</p>
<p>So get that afternoon light.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;ll probably notice</p>
<p>is that the optimal protocols</p>
<p>for optimizing your brain and body health</p>
<p>and performance and sleep, et cetera,</p>
<p>are actually really simple.</p>
<p>But just because they&rsquo;re simple</p>
<p>does not mean that they are not powerful.</p>
<p>In fact, they are very powerful</p>
<p>because they leverage the most powerful technology</p>
<p>that exists, which is your nervous system.</p>
<p>You know, we always think about technologies as devices</p>
<p>and indeed there are some wonderful devices out there.</p>
<p>Some people are really into tracking their sleep</p>
<p>and their sleep time.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re into that, great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something that I personally do.</p>
<p>Although I keep telling myself that I should do that.</p>
<p>There are devices that can control brain waves</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But what we are talking about today</p>
<p>are really basic things that we can all do</p>
<p>that can steer our neurology and our biology</p>
<p>in the directions that are going to support workflow,</p>
<p>that are going to support hormones,</p>
<p>that are going to support brain function.</p>
<p>So this afternoon light viewing is yet another example</p>
<p>of leveraging a technology that you were born with</p>
<p>and that you will die with</p>
<p>and that you will have every day in between</p>
<p>in order to tweak the hormones of your system.</p>
<p>In this case, the hormone melatonin</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s released at the appropriate times</p>
<p>and not at the wrong times.</p>
<p>Because we know that when hormones and systems of the body</p>
<p>are well aligned with the 24 hour schedule,</p>
<p>beautiful things happen.</p>
<p>And when they are misaligned, terrible things happen.</p>
<p>Sometimes those terrible things are subtle at first,</p>
<p>but disrupting your circadian rhythms</p>
<p>is really bad for every system in your body.</p>
<p>Getting it right, and as you can tell,</p>
<p>getting it right doesn&rsquo;t take much,</p>
<p>can really serve to quote unquote optimize you.</p>
<p>When I say optimize,</p>
<p>I mean it puts you into a better mood overall,</p>
<p>better state for learning, et cetera.</p>
<p>So get that afternoon light as well.</p>
<p>So at some point in the evening,</p>
<p>I eat that thing that we call dinner.</p>
<p>And while it feels sort of strange to talk about my dinner,</p>
<p>the reason I want to talk about my dinner</p>
<p>and what I eat for dinner is that for me,</p>
<p>dinner of course is about eating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mention again, I love eating,</p>
<p>but also about optimizing the transition to sleep and sleep.</p>
<p>So obviously I eat foods that I enjoy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one of these people that will eat anything</p>
<p>or avoid eating anything simply to benefit from that.</p>
<p>I do enjoy food very, very much.</p>
<p>And so my dinner generally is comprised of things</p>
<p>that are going to support rest and deep sleep.</p>
<p>And that means starchy carbohydrates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely clear that one of the major ways</p>
<p>that we can increase serotonin,</p>
<p>which helps in the transition to sleep</p>
<p>is by ingesting starchy carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Now I realize that starchy carbohydrates</p>
<p>are kind of a demonized term nowadays,</p>
<p>you know, everyone&rsquo;s anti-carbs,</p>
<p>but you know, we really should distinguish</p>
<p>between refined sugars and complex carbohydrates.</p>
<p>And we did an episode about this.</p>
<p>We talked about how refined sugars disrupt</p>
<p>not just metabolism, but they actually disrupt</p>
<p>some of the neurons in the gut that sense fatty acids</p>
<p>and amino acids from fats and proteins.</p>
<p>But those same neurons can actually respond to sugar</p>
<p>and create a situation where you actually start craving</p>
<p>more sugar because those neurons in your gut</p>
<p>communicate via a nerve pathway for your fascinatos</p>
<p>called the vagus nerve and a little cluster of neurons</p>
<p>called the nodose ganglia, N-O-D-O-S-E.</p>
<p>Nodose ganglia, so right next to the corner of your jaw</p>
<p>and can trigger the activation and the release of dopamine</p>
<p>in your brain, which basically makes you crave more sugar</p>
<p>independent of how something tastes.</p>
<p>So when I say carbohydrates, what I really mean</p>
<p>is starchy carbohydrates, non-refined sugars.</p>
<p>And in the episode about food and mood</p>
<p>and metabolism as well, I referenced</p>
<p>a really spectacular lecture by Dr. Robert Lustig,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a pediatric endocrinologist at UCSF,</p>
<p>UC San Francisco, absolutely spectacular talk.</p>
<p>You can find it on YouTube easily,</p>
<p>where he talks about the science of refined sugars.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t in any kind of conspiracy or paranoid way.</p>
<p>This is really the medical and scientific literature.</p>
<p>So my dinner is carbohydrates and some protein.</p>
<p>So maybe some chicken or fish or something like that,</p>
<p>maybe some eggs or sometimes just pasta</p>
<p>or just rice and vegetables.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because I enjoy those foods,</p>
<p>but also because I want to increase</p>
<p>the amount of serotonin in my brain</p>
<p>so that I can actually fall asleep that night.</p>
<p>Many people who are on low carbohydrate diets</p>
<p>struggle with falling and staying asleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s hard to achieve</p>
<p>heightened levels of serotonin,</p>
<p>which are necessary to enter sleep.</p>
<p>I should also mention that melatonin and serotonin</p>
<p>fall in the same pathway.</p>
<p>They are related hormones and neuromodulators.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t go into their biosynthesis now,</p>
<p>but essentially what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is a system that&rsquo;s biasing us towards rest and relaxation</p>
<p>as opposed to wakefulness.</p>
<p>You might ask, well, can&rsquo;t I just take serotonin?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t I just take 5-HTP or a precursor to serotonin</p>
<p>or tryptophan?</p>
<p>And indeed you can.</p>
<p>However, many people, including myself,</p>
<p>find that when they supplement with serotonin</p>
<p>in the evening or at night,</p>
<p>that can cause problems in the architecture</p>
<p>or the structure of sleep.</p>
<p>It can cause a lot of people, including me,</p>
<p>to fall asleep very fast,</p>
<p>sleep very deeply for three or four hours,</p>
<p>and then wake up and have a terrible time</p>
<p>falling back asleep.</p>
<p>And that effect, at least for me,</p>
<p>can last several days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really disruptive.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like to supplement with anything</p>
<p>that is directly dopamine or a precursor to dopamine</p>
<p>at any time or directly serotonin</p>
<p>or a precursor to serotonin.</p>
<p>Rather, there are other things that can enhance</p>
<p>the transition to sleep safely,</p>
<p>which we will talk about in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But the evening meal consists largely of carbohydrates</p>
<p>for that specific purpose of generating</p>
<p>a sense of calm.</p>
<p>And of course, carbohydrates are delicious.</p>
<p>And because I&rsquo;m doing some physical training,</p>
<p>and presumably you are as well,</p>
<p>or I hope you are,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so beneficial to one&rsquo;s health,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also going to replenish my glycogen stores,</p>
<p>which is one of the primary fuel sources</p>
<p>for moving one&rsquo;s muscles and moving around</p>
<p>and doing exercise,</p>
<p>as well as for the brain and for cognitive function.</p>
<p>So low carbohydrates throughout the 24-hour period</p>
<p>are not something that are attractive to me.</p>
<p>I realize that some people will do much better</p>
<p>on a low-carbohydrate or even ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>but for me, and I do believe for most people,</p>
<p>creating a situation of maybe fasting</p>
<p>and then low-carb or no-carb diets</p>
<p>for states of alertness and focus</p>
<p>at one portion of the day,</p>
<p>and then ingesting starchy carbohydrates</p>
<p>for sake of inducing rest and relaxation</p>
<p>is a, at least scientifically, rationally-based protocol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s grounded in real neurochemistry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s grounded in things that we can point to</p>
<p>and say, ah, this food substance,</p>
<p>this thing can support my brain,</p>
<p>not directly because it&rsquo;s some magic substance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to make all my neurons extremely robust,</p>
<p>but rather it&rsquo;s going to support sleep,</p>
<p>which is perhaps the foundation</p>
<p>of all mental and physical health.</p>
<p>In fact, we can point to sleep as the primary way</p>
<p>in which we can ensure our overall health,</p>
<p>including our brain health.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about sleep and how to access sleep,</p>
<p>how to fall asleep easily,</p>
<p>and how to make sure that the sleep we have</p>
<p>is of sufficient duration and quality.</p>
<p>One way to do that is to leverage the drop in temperature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s necessary to fall and stay asleep.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>in the early parts of the day after waking,</p>
<p>our body temperature is rising,</p>
<p>and that continues throughout the day,</p>
<p>and then sometime late in the afternoon,</p>
<p>our temperature peaks, and then it starts to drop.</p>
<p>That drop in temperature of one to three degrees</p>
<p>is vitally important for us</p>
<p>to be able to fall asleep easily.</p>
<p>One way that we can decrease our transition time into sleep</p>
<p>is to accelerate that drop in temperature.</p>
<p>And one way to accelerate that drop in temperature,</p>
<p>somewhat counterintuitively,</p>
<p>is to use hot baths, hot showers,</p>
<p>or if you have access to one, a sauna.</p>
<p>Now, this is counterintuitive because you&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>well, hot baths, so it&rsquo;s going to heat me up.</p>
<p>But actually, if you are to get into a sauna</p>
<p>or a hot shower or a hot bath and then get out,</p>
<p>your body is going to engage particular mechanisms</p>
<p>for cooling itself off</p>
<p>that are going to allow you to drop your temperature</p>
<p>more quickly and fall asleep more easily.</p>
<p>And this is why many people find that falling asleep</p>
<p>after a nice hot shower or bath or sauna</p>
<p>is really, really easy and really terrific.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of a natural state</p>
<p>that follows hot baths, saunas, and showers.</p>
<p>So how would you do this?</p>
<p>Well, we did an entire episode on this topic as well,</p>
<p>the use of sauna for sake of growth hormone release.</p>
<p>If you want to check that out and all the details,</p>
<p>you can look at the episode on growth hormone.</p>
<p>You will experience a growth hormone release</p>
<p>from sauna, hot bath, and hot shower,</p>
<p>provided they&rsquo;re done for sufficient duration</p>
<p>and sufficiently high temperature.</p>
<p>For all the details of that, please go to that episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all laid out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all timestamped.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all captioned in English and Spanish, et cetera.</p>
<p>But basically what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is 20 minutes in the sauna.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re one of those folks</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s really chasing growth hormone release,</p>
<p>you could do 20 minutes,</p>
<p>then get out of the sauna for 10 minutes</p>
<p>and just cool off at room temperature,</p>
<p>and then get back into the sauna,</p>
<p>then get out and then shower or dry off and head to bed.</p>
<p>Shorter bouts of sauna will work also.</p>
<p>The longer bouts of sauna cooling, sauna cooling,</p>
<p>have been shown to lead to huge increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>And growth hormone, of course, is involved</p>
<p>both in muscle growth,</p>
<p>but also growth and metabolism of all tissues,</p>
<p>fat metabolism, and repair of various tissues.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about growth.</p>
<p>You hear growth hormone, you think hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but the enhancement of metabolism and health</p>
<p>and repair in a number of tissues.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way you can leverage heat</p>
<p>toward the transition to sleep</p>
<p>by the ways in which exposure to heat</p>
<p>actually cools off your body.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about actually getting to sleep.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s talk about behavioral protocols first.</p>
<p>It is absolutely true that keeping the room very dark</p>
<p>is beneficial.</p>
<p>Some people, including myself, have thin eyelids,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t take much light</p>
<p>to wake up the brain and body.</p>
<p>So keeping a room very dark is essential.</p>
<p>The other thing is keeping the room cool.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard this before.</p>
<p>Keep the room cool, get under warm blankets.</p>
<p>But rarely is it discussed</p>
<p>why keeping the room cool is useful.</p>
<p>The reason keeping the room cool is useful</p>
<p>for getting into and staying asleep</p>
<p>is that throughout the night,</p>
<p>there are phases of sleep where you are paralyzed,</p>
<p>so-called REM sleep, that&rsquo;s a healthy paralysis,</p>
<p>presumably so you can&rsquo;t act out your dreams,</p>
<p>but there are portions of the night where you can move.</p>
<p>And one of the more important movements</p>
<p>that you do in the middle of the night</p>
<p>is put your hand out or your foot out</p>
<p>or you take your face out from under the covers</p>
<p>as a means to cool yourself.</p>
<p>And you do this while you are asleep.</p>
<p>If you are in a cool room,</p>
<p>you can put yourself under the blankets to stay warm.</p>
<p>And then if you want to cool off,</p>
<p>you can simply remove a limb</p>
<p>or you can toss the covers off entirely.</p>
<p>However, if you are in a room that&rsquo;s too warm,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to cool off.</p>
<p>You would need a bucket of ice water</p>
<p>or to get up and turn on the air conditioning</p>
<p>or something of that sort or turn on the fan.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a simple but non-trivial way</p>
<p>in which we can improve our entrance to sleep</p>
<p>and staying asleep.</p>
<p>So keep the room cool or cold and get under warm blankets.</p>
<p>And if you want to understand more</p>
<p>about why putting a hand out or a foot out</p>
<p>is valuable for cooling,</p>
<p>I did an episode on the role of cooling</p>
<p>in something called heat dumping</p>
<p>or bringing heat into the body through the palms,</p>
<p>the face and the bottoms of the feet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got these portals, these radiators, if you will,</p>
<p>that allow us to bring heat into the body and to dump heat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into the details now,</p>
<p>but that episode is entitled</p>
<p>Supercharge Your Exercise With Cold.</p>
<p>This is based on work that was done by Craig Heller&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at Stanford University.</p>
<p>Absolutely incredible data</p>
<p>showing that the proper use of palmar cooling,</p>
<p>so the palms or the upper half of the face</p>
<p>or the bottoms of the feet can vastly,</p>
<p>I mean, vastly increase the volume of exercise</p>
<p>that one can do and still recover from that exercise</p>
<p>and derive benefits from it.</p>
<p>But this method of cooling for exercise</p>
<p>is grounded in a basic physiological function</p>
<p>of our palms, the bottoms of our feet and our face,</p>
<p>which is to dump heat</p>
<p>or to allow cool to pass into the body.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not in REM sleep,</p>
<p>if you get too warm, you put your foot out</p>
<p>or you put your arms out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually allowing cooling of the body</p>
<p>through what are called AVAs,</p>
<p>arteriovenous asthmoses is the technical name</p>
<p>that are in the palms, the upper half of the face</p>
<p>and the bottoms of the feet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very efficient way to cool off your body.</p>
<p>So you do that subconsciously.</p>
<p>Now, there are things that one can take</p>
<p>to enhance the transition to sleep.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of melatonin</p>
<p>for enhancing the transition to sleep</p>
<p>for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One, dosages of melatonin are far too high</p>
<p>in most supplements.</p>
<p>Melatonin can have some negative effects</p>
<p>on the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a serious concern.</p>
<p>Third, melatonin&rsquo;s role during puberty or around puberty</p>
<p>is to suppress the onset of puberty.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s concerning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that people should be taking this hormone</p>
<p>that has all these other effects.</p>
<p>The other reason is that melatonin</p>
<p>will aid the transition to sleep,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t keep you asleep.</p>
<p>And many people that take melatonin</p>
<p>find that they fall asleep more quickly,</p>
<p>but then they wake up unable to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>Three compounds that can be very beneficial</p>
<p>for aiding the transition to sleep</p>
<p>and for which there are wide safety margins,</p>
<p>although please do check with your physician</p>
<p>before taking anything,</p>
<p>are specific forms of magnesium,</p>
<p>something called apogenin and theanine.</p>
<p>Magnesium comes in many forms.</p>
<p>Magnesium malate has been shown to improve recovery</p>
<p>from sore muscles, for instance.</p>
<p>Magnesium citrate is an excellent laxative, for instance.</p>
<p>Magnesium threonate, that&rsquo;s T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate,</p>
<p>and magnesium biglycinate have transporters</p>
<p>that allow them to cross the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>more readily than other forms of magnesium.</p>
<p>There within the brain,</p>
<p>they promote the release of a neurotransmitter</p>
<p>called GABA, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter</p>
<p>which shuts off the forebrain to some extent.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t shut off completely,</p>
<p>but it essentially shuts down thinking, rumination,</p>
<p>planning, and in what we call executive function.</p>
<p>So for many people taking 300 to 400 milligrams</p>
<p>of magnesium biglycinate or magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>and there I&rsquo;m referring to the elemental magnesium</p>
<p>for you aficionados,</p>
<p>many people find that doing that 30 to 60 minutes</p>
<p>before sleep can aid them in falling asleep,</p>
<p>can really help them fall asleep faster and stay asleep.</p>
<p>Some people, however, achieve</p>
<p>some gastrointestinal discomfort from magnesium</p>
<p>and therefore should avoid it.</p>
<p>Magnesium threonate and magnesium biglycinate</p>
<p>for many people work, however,</p>
<p>and when coupled with apigenin and theanine</p>
<p>provide a sort of synergy or a sleep cocktail</p>
<p>that seems to be very effective</p>
<p>in aiding the transition to sleep.</p>
<p>So apigenin is the substance that&rsquo;s found in chamomile</p>
<p>and 50 milligrams of apigenin taken 30 minutes before sleep</p>
<p>can act as another way to shut off the forebrain</p>
<p>and reduce rumination, reduce anxiety,</p>
<p>and allow people to fall and stay asleep.</p>
<p>I did a podcast with Dr. Daria Rose.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got an excellent podcast</p>
<p>that I highly recommend you check out.</p>
<p>Covers a number of different health, scientific,</p>
<p>and other subjects.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s a PhD in neuroscience,</p>
<p>terrific scientist, et cetera.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a big fan of apigenin as am I.</p>
<p>And then the third compound is theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E.</p>
<p>Theanine is a compound that can also increase GABA</p>
<p>but also increases activation</p>
<p>of something called chloride channels.</p>
<p>Chloride channels are another way</p>
<p>in which neurons turn themselves off</p>
<p>or turn each other off.</p>
<p>Not turn each other off</p>
<p>in the way that we&rsquo;re typically heard,</p>
<p>like that turns me off,</p>
<p>but turn them off and shut them down,</p>
<p>lower their levels of activity.</p>
<p>So magnesium threonate or biglycinate,</p>
<p>apigenin and theanine in combination</p>
<p>can be very effective for aiding the transition to sleep.</p>
<p>And I realized that not everyone wants to take supplements.</p>
<p>I certainly am not pushing any of these.</p>
<p>I would hope that everybody be able to fall asleep easily</p>
<p>and stay asleep for the duration of time that they want</p>
<p>without any supplemental help.</p>
<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s important to point out some things</p>
<p>that lie somewhere between doing nothing</p>
<p>and taking prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Because many of the prescription drugs associated</p>
<p>with sleep, and you all know what those are,</p>
<p>carry other side effects.</p>
<p>They can create bad dreams,</p>
<p>often very disturbing dreams.</p>
<p>They can be addictive or at least habit forming.</p>
<p>They can create grogginess in the morning.</p>
<p>Some are safer than others.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a variety of them out there.</p>
<p>But for those that want to explore supplements</p>
<p>and how they can impact sleep,</p>
<p>this combination of about 300, 400 milligrams</p>
<p>of magnesium threonate or biglycinate,</p>
<p>50 milligrams of apigenin,</p>
<p>and 100 to 200 milligrams of theanine alone</p>
<p>or in combination have been beneficial to many people.</p>
<p>And there are excellent studies</p>
<p>to support those statements.</p>
<p>Again, I suggest you go to examine.com</p>
<p>and look up the human effect matrix</p>
<p>for each of those compounds and you can explore them.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting aspects to magnesium threonate</p>
<p>and biglycinate is that it seems to have</p>
<p>some neuroprotective effects as well.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t many studies on it,</p>
<p>but the few studies that are there point to the fact</p>
<p>that magnesium threonate and magnesium biglycinate</p>
<p>can also support neuron health and neuron longevity,</p>
<p>which is just an added bonus in my opinion.</p>
<p>Now, what if you wake up in the middle of the night?</p>
<p>This is a very common occurrence.</p>
<p>And there are two general themes</p>
<p>around waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>that one can use tools to counteract.</p>
<p>The first theme is if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who is tired in the evenings</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of pushing yourself to stay awake.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to the party</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re pushing yourself to study your work</p>
<p>when in fact you&rsquo;d like to get into bed at 8.30 or 9,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re falling asleep around 10.30, 11</p>
<p>and waking up at 2.30 or 3 in the morning</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t fall back asleep.</p>
<p>Chances are that your melatonin pulse</p>
<p>was initiated early in the night.</p>
<p>So that melatonin pulse started probably around 8.30 or 9,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re staying up, you&rsquo;re battling that melatonin.</p>
<p>And then sometime around 2.30 or 3 in the morning,</p>
<p>that melatonin is no longer present.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sufficiently high levels in your bloodstream</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re waking up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting your morning cortisol pulse</p>
<p>shifted into those wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p>You may not like this advice,</p>
<p>but one of the things that you can do to offset that</p>
<p>is to simply go to bed earlier.</p>
<p>By going to bed earlier,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get the longer duration of sleep.</p>
<p>But I realized that there are social reasons</p>
<p>and work-related reasons why going to bed at 8.30 or 9</p>
<p>is not necessarily beneficial to your life.</p>
<p>So in that case, you might be one of the rare individuals</p>
<p>for whom getting a little bit more bright light</p>
<p>in the evening could be a good thing.</p>
<p>So this would be around the hours of 7 or 8 p.m.</p>
<p>and then that way causing that pulse in melatonin</p>
<p>to be delayed because again, light inhibits melatonin.</p>
<p>Now, the other thing is many people wake up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night because of anxiety</p>
<p>or because they have to use the restroom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to flip on the lights,</p>
<p>but keep the lights dim.</p>
<p>But if you flip on those lights,</p>
<p>try and flip them off as soon as possible</p>
<p>and try and get back into bed.</p>
<p>And if you have trouble falling asleep again</p>
<p>and you absolutely need to sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where these NSDR,</p>
<p>these non-sleep deep rest protocols</p>
<p>can really be beneficial.</p>
<p>Even though the NS, the non-sleep part</p>
<p>might make you think that they will prevent you</p>
<p>from falling asleep,</p>
<p>rather than trying to fight your mind,</p>
<p>trying to fight anxiety,</p>
<p>which is always a terrible thing to do.</p>
<p>I always say it&rsquo;s very hard to control the mind</p>
<p>with the mind, look to the body</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what NSDR scripts do.</p>
<p>Things like yoga nidra,</p>
<p>even the sleep hypnosis done in the middle of the night</p>
<p>if you wake up and want to fall back asleep,</p>
<p>oftentimes will help you fall back asleep immediately.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they will at least put your brain and body</p>
<p>into a state of deep relaxation</p>
<p>that more closely mimics the sleep state</p>
<p>that you ought to be in</p>
<p>than the awake, ruminating, stressing</p>
<p>about the fact that you&rsquo;re not sleeping state.</p>
<p>So if you wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>really try and get back to sleep.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t do that by doing, for instance,</p>
<p>long exhale breathing, which can work,</p>
<p>use some other tool of the body to shift the mind.</p>
<p>And the tools that I&rsquo;m recommending</p>
<p>are of the non-sleep deep rest variety.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve essentially traveled around the clock,</p>
<p>so to speak, from the time where one wakes up</p>
<p>until the time they start working,</p>
<p>until the time they exercise, eat lunch,</p>
<p>do an NSDR, head to sleep, get to sleep,</p>
<p>maybe wake up, get back to sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that although people&rsquo;s schedules vary,</p>
<p>most people are doing more</p>
<p>than one or two work bouts per day.</p>
<p>And indeed, I&rsquo;m doing more than one</p>
<p>or two work bouts per day.</p>
<p>I really emphasize that morning 90-minute work block</p>
<p>because I think most people would agree</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a portion of each day</p>
<p>in which we need to do the hardest thing</p>
<p>or the most important thing</p>
<p>or the thing that demands the most of our cognitive self.</p>
<p>I position that early in the day</p>
<p>and I position everything around that</p>
<p>in order to ensure that it happens</p>
<p>and that it happens with the highest degree of efficiency.</p>
<p>And yes, I make sure that it happens every day.</p>
<p>And that brings about two other important points.</p>
<p>First of all, we do have this thing called weekends.</p>
<p>And I tend to take one day off per week, not both,</p>
<p>much to the dismay of people in my life.</p>
<p>And Costello, but nonetheless,</p>
<p>there is something called weekend drift,</p>
<p>which is that we can be very regimented</p>
<p>on a Monday or a Tuesday.</p>
<p>And then even if we&rsquo;re good about maintaining a schedule,</p>
<p>Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, et cetera,</p>
<p>most of us, I would hope,</p>
<p>would alter their schedule somewhat on the weekends</p>
<p>in order to recover and get some additional rest.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize, I absolutely do that.</p>
<p>I take one day per week where I go full Costello,</p>
<p>where I essentially do nothing in a structured way.</p>
<p>At least if I have my way, I&rsquo;m not making any plans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely free to explore what I want to do</p>
<p>and when I want to do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the way life works out.</p>
<p>Oftentimes there are social engagements</p>
<p>and other things that get in the way or that I enjoy,</p>
<p>and that breaks up the day.</p>
<p>But I do take rest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that one has to follow the same schedule</p>
<p>every single day.</p>
<p>However, I do think there are a few things</p>
<p>that people should do every single day if possible.</p>
<p>And those are get morning sunlight,</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t, your circadian rhythms</p>
<p>and your health, et cetera, and your mood</p>
<p>are going to start to drift,</p>
<p>and to try and get sleep on a regular basis.</p>
<p>And of course, some of the greatest things in life</p>
<p>happen after 10 p.m.,</p>
<p>and some of those even involve sleepless nights</p>
<p>of various kinds.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t want to discourage people</p>
<p>from having a social life</p>
<p>or from having a robust party life, if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>or for enjoying life,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s certainly one of the main things</p>
<p>that we should all be pursuing is to enjoy life.</p>
<p>The only point I want to make about sleep</p>
<p>is that if you happen to stay up late,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still best to get up at your regular wake-up time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple solution to a problem</p>
<p>that a lot of people have,</p>
<p>which is they stay up till two or three in the morning,</p>
<p>and then they tend to sleep late,</p>
<p>and then it tends to disrupt their rhythm.</p>
<p>Try on most days and most nights</p>
<p>to wake up at more or less the same time</p>
<p>and try to go to sleep at more or less the same time.</p>
<p>In fact, I was talking to Matt Walker about this recently,</p>
<p>and he was also surprised to see these new data,</p>
<p>and I was surprised to see these new data</p>
<p>that emphasize that if you get a poor night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re up late the previous night for good reasons,</p>
<p>many people feel like they just want to go to bed</p>
<p>early the next night,</p>
<p>but it turns out that&rsquo;s not the best thing to do</p>
<p>for your immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>Try and stay up to the point</p>
<p>where you would normally stay up and then get to sleep.</p>
<p>If you go to bed a couple hours earlier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not going to kill you,</p>
<p>but try to not go to bed, for instance, at 6 p.m.,</p>
<p>because you were up the entire night before.</p>
<p>That can really be disruptive.</p>
<p>The other thing I want to emphasize</p>
<p>is that even though that morning 90-minute work block</p>
<p>is so vital, of course, there&rsquo;s a second work block,</p>
<p>and in fact, I described one in the afternoon</p>
<p>after the NSDR.</p>
<p>For me, that&rsquo;s reverie hypnosis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a 90-minute work block</p>
<p>in which I drop in again in a no-internet connection,</p>
<p>no-phone kind of way,</p>
<p>to complete some work that&rsquo;s important to me.</p>
<p>So combined, that&rsquo;s just three hours of focused work,</p>
<p>which may not seem like a lot,</p>
<p>but if you were to dissect your day</p>
<p>and kind of look at the arc and structure of your day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that if we added up</p>
<p>the total period of time in which you were</p>
<p>in what Cal Newport would call deep work,</p>
<p>really focused, dedicated work,</p>
<p>that it would probably amount to about three or four hours.</p>
<p>If you can squeeze in another 90-minute work block,</p>
<p>or if you can get four 90-minute work blocks,</p>
<p>well then, more power to you,</p>
<p>but I think most people find that one or two</p>
<p>of these really deep focused 90-minute work blocks</p>
<p>are about what one&rsquo;s schedule and even mind can handle.</p>
<p>And of course, throughout the day,</p>
<p>there are other things happening.</p>
<p>Outside of those 90-minute work blocks,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m checking my text messages, I&rsquo;m checking my email,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m responding to various demands,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working and tending to life.</p>
<p>So while I&rsquo;ve carved some boundaries</p>
<p>or delineate some boundaries around those work blocks,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certain that if you do too,</p>
<p>you will benefit from them,</p>
<p>they are certainly not the only periods of time each day</p>
<p>in which I or I believe other people</p>
<p>should be trying to learn or trying to focus.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize that even though my job</p>
<p>is to discover knowledge and distribute knowledge</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a scientist,</p>
<p>I realized that 90-minute work blocks</p>
<p>of the sort that I&rsquo;m describing</p>
<p>may not apply specifically to the kinds of work you do.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an artist or a sculptor,</p>
<p>where you build furniture or whatever it is</p>
<p>that you happen to teach children or they teach you,</p>
<p>whatever it happens to be,</p>
<p>of course, please adapt and modify what I&rsquo;ve described today</p>
<p>in ways that best serve you and your schedule.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve tried to do is provide you a picture</p>
<p>of the 24-hour schedule that I follow</p>
<p>and why I do certain things at particular times</p>
<p>and why I do those particular things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve really tried to emphasize</p>
<p>the scientific rationale behind those things,</p>
<p>the peer-reviewed data.</p>
<p>In some cases, I pointed out the specific papers,</p>
<p>in other cases, I&rsquo;ve referred to large bodies of work</p>
<p>that support these practices.</p>
<p>When I say large bodies of work,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of looking to the scientific literature</p>
<p>and asking where is the center of mass</p>
<p>for a particular topic?</p>
<p>For instance, where is there 50 or 100 or 1,000 papers</p>
<p>that, for instance, support morning light viewing</p>
<p>in order to optimize melatonin secretion later in the day,</p>
<p>cortisol secretion early in the day,</p>
<p>mood, metabolism, et cetera?</p>
<p>If one were to put into PubMed light metabolism and mood,</p>
<p>you would literally get tens of thousands,</p>
<p>maybe even hundreds of thousands of studies.</p>
<p>So when I say the center of mass,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve really tried to do is examine the literature</p>
<p>and figure out where there&rsquo;s a sort of a directive protocol</p>
<p>that emerges from all these various studies</p>
<p>that used, in some cases, animals, in many cases, humans,</p>
<p>and explore different, what we call dependent variables.</p>
<p>Some studies were looking at effects on blood sugar,</p>
<p>other on mood.</p>
<p>So I hope that makes clear why the rationale</p>
<p>behind what I provided today.</p>
