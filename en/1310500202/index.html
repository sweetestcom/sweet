    <p>The following is a conversation with Sarah Walker,</p>
<p>an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist</p>
<p>at Arizona State University and the Santa Fe Institute.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s interested in the origin of life,</p>
<p>how to find life on other worlds,</p>
<p>and in general, the more fundamental question</p>
<p>of what even life is.</p>
<p>She seeks to discover the universal laws</p>
<p>that describe living systems on Earth and elsewhere</p>
<p>using physics, biology, and computation.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>NetSuite, Blinkist, and Magic Spoon.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that my hope for this podcast</p>
<p>is to try and alternate between technical</p>
<p>and nontechnical discussions,</p>
<p>to jump from the big picture</p>
<p>down to specific detailed research</p>
<p>and back to the big picture,</p>
<p>and to do so with scientists and non scientists.</p>
<p>Long term, I hope to alternate between discussions</p>
<p>of cutting edge research in AI, physics, biology,</p>
<p>to topics of music, sport, and history,</p>
<p>and then back to AI.</p>
<p>AI is home.</p>
<p>I hope you come along with me</p>
<p>for that wild, oscillating journey.</p>
<p>Some people message me saying to slow down</p>
<p>since they&rsquo;re falling behind</p>
<p>on the episodes of this podcast.</p>
<p>To their disappointment, I have to say</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll probably do more episodes, not less,</p>
<p>but you really don&rsquo;t need to listen to every episode.</p>
<p>Just listen to the ones that spark your curiosity.</p>
<p>Think about it like a party full of strangers.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to talk to everyone.</p>
<p>Just walk over to the ones who look interesting</p>
<p>and get to know them.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re lucky, that one conversation with a stranger</p>
<p>might change the direction of your life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a short life, so be picky with the strangers</p>
<p>you talk to at this metaphorical party.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Sarah Walker.</p>
<p>How did life originate on Earth?</p>
<p>What are the various hypotheses</p>
<p>for how life originated on Earth?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I guess you&rsquo;re asking a historical question,</p>
<p>which is always a good place to start thinking about life.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of ideas about how life started on Earth.</p>
<p>Probably the most popular</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called the RNA world scenario.</p>
<p>So this idea is probably the one</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll see most reported in the news.</p>
<p>And is based on the idea that there are molecules</p>
<p>in our bodies that relay genetic information.</p>
<p>And we know those as DNA, obviously,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a sort of an intermediary called RNA,</p>
<p>ribonucleic acid, that also plays the role of proteins.</p>
<p>And people came up with this idea in the 80s</p>
<p>that maybe that was the first genetic material</p>
<p>because it could play both roles of being genetic</p>
<p>and performing catalysis.</p>
<p>And then somehow that idea got reduced to this idea</p>
<p>that there was a molecule that emerged on early Earth</p>
<p>and underwent Darwinian evolution,</p>
<p>and that was the start of life.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of assumptions packed in there</p>
<p>that we could unpack,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s sort of the leading hypothesis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also other ideas about life starting as metabolism.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s more connected</p>
<p>to the geochemistry of early Earth.</p>
<p>And it would be kind of more focused on this idea</p>
<p>that you get some kind of catalytic cycle of molecules</p>
<p>that can reproduce themselves</p>
<p>and form some kind of metabolism.</p>
<p>And then life starts basically a self organization.</p>
<p>And then you have to explain how evolution comes later.</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between sort of energy and genetic code.</p>
<p>So like energy and information</p>
<p>are those are the two kind of things there?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a good way of putting it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny,</p>
<p>because I think most of the people that think about</p>
<p>these things are really disciplinary bias.</p>
<p>So the people that tend to think about genetics</p>
<p>come from a biology background</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really evolution focused.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re worried about</p>
<p>where does the information come from?</p>
<p>And how does it change over time?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re talking about information in a really narrow way</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re talking about a genetic sequence.</p>
<p>And then most of the people that think about metabolism,</p>
<p>origins of life scenarios tend to be</p>
<p>people like physicists or geochemists</p>
<p>that are worried about what are the energy sources</p>
<p>and what kinds of organization</p>
<p>can you get out of those energy sources?</p>
<p>Okay, so which one is your favorite?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like either.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, can we talk about them</p>
<p>for a little bit longer though?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>So okay, so there&rsquo;s early Earth.</p>
<p>What was that like?</p>
<p>Was there just mostly covered by oceans?</p>
<p>Was there heat sources, energy sources?</p>
<p>So if we talk about the metabolism view</p>
<p>of the origin of life,</p>
<p>like where was the source of energy?</p>
<p>Probably the most popular view</p>
<p>for where the origin of life happened on Earth</p>
<p>is hydrothermal vents because they had sufficient energy.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t really know a lot about early Earth.</p>
<p>We have some ideas about when oceans first formed</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>but the time of the origin of life</p>
<p>is kind of not well understood or pinned down</p>
<p>and the conditions on Earth at that time are not well known.</p>
<p>But a lot of people do think</p>
<p>that there was probably hydrothermal vents</p>
<p>which are really hot, chemically active regions,</p>
<p>say on the seafloor in modern times,</p>
<p>which also would have been present on early Earth.</p>
<p>And they would have provided energy and organics</p>
<p>and basically all of the right conditions</p>
<p>for the origins of life,</p>
<p>which is one of the reasons</p>
<p>that we look for these hydrothermal systems</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about life elsewhere too.</p>
<p>Okay, and for the genetic code,</p>
<p>the idea is that the RNA is the first,</p>
<p>like why would RNA be the first moment you can say it&rsquo;s life?</p>
<p>I guess the idea is it could both</p>
<p>have persistent information</p>
<p>and then it can also do some of the work</p>
<p>of like what, creating a self sustaining organism?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the basic idea.</p>
<p>So the idea is you have, in an RNA molecule,</p>
<p>you have a sequence of characters, say,</p>
<p>so you can treat it like a string in a computer</p>
<p>and it can be copied.</p>
<p>So information can be propagated,</p>
<p>which is important for evolution</p>
<p>because evolution happens</p>
<p>by having inheritance of information.</p>
<p>So for example, like my eyes are brown</p>
<p>because my mother&rsquo;s eyes were brown.</p>
<p>So you need that copying of information,</p>
<p>but then you also have the ability to perform catalysis,</p>
<p>which means that that RNA molecule</p>
<p>is not inert in that environment,</p>
<p>but it actually interacts with something</p>
<p>and could potentially mediate, say, a metabolism</p>
<p>that could then fuel the actual reproduction</p>
<p>of that molecule.</p>
<p>So in some ways, people think that RNA gives you</p>
<p>the most bang for your buck in a single molecule</p>
<p>and therefore, it gives you all the features</p>
<p>that you might think are life.</p>
<p>And so this is sort of where this RNA world conjecture</p>
<p>came from is because of those two properties.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing that RNA came to be in general?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it? Yes, that is amazing.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re not talking down about RNA.</p>
<p>No, no, I love RNA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my favorite molecules.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s beautiful. It&rsquo;s just not step one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the issue,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even the RNA world is a problem</p>
<p>and actually, if you really dig into it,</p>
<p>the RNA world is not one hypothesis.</p>
<p>It is a set of hypothesis, hypotheses, sorry.</p>
<p>And they range from a molecule of RNA spontaneously emerged</p>
<p>on the early Earth and started evolving,</p>
<p>which is kind of like the hardest RNA world scenario,</p>
<p>which is the one I cited and I get a little animated about</p>
<p>because it seems so blatantly wrong to me,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a separate story.</p>
<p>And then the other one is actually something I agree with,</p>
<p>which is that you can say there was an RNA world</p>
<p>because RNA was the first genetic material</p>
<p>for life on Earth.</p>
<p>So an RNA world could just be the earliest organisms</p>
<p>that had genetics in a modern sense,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have DNA evolved yet, they had RNA, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s sort of a softer RNA world scenario</p>
<p>in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t mean it was the first thing</p>
<p>that happened, but it was a thing that definitely was part</p>
<p>of the lineage of events that led to us.</p>
<p>So if a life was like a best of album,</p>
<p>it would be on the, it&rsquo;d be one of the songs on there.</p>
<p>Yes. One of the early songs.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the greatest hits.</p>
<p>Greatest hits, that&rsquo;s the word I was looking for.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Did life, do you think, originate once, twice,</p>
<p>three times on Earth, multiple times?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really difficult question.</p>
<p>Is it an important question?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a super important question.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a really important question.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of questions in that question.</p>
<p>So one of the first ones that I think needs to be addressed</p>
<p>is is the origin of life a continuous process</p>
<p>on our planet?</p>
<p>So we think about the origin of life as something</p>
<p>that happened on Earth, say almost 4 billion years ago,</p>
<p>because we have evidence of life emerging very early</p>
<p>on our planet.</p>
<p>And then an origin of life event, quote unquote,</p>
<p>a singular event, whatever that was, happened.</p>
<p>And then all life on Earth that we know is a descendant</p>
<p>of that particular event in our universe, right?</p>
<p>And so, but we don&rsquo;t have any idea one way or the other</p>
<p>if the origin of life is happening repeatedly,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s just not taking off</p>
<p>because life is already established.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a argument that people will make,</p>
<p>or maybe there are alternative forms of life on Earth</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t even recognize.</p>
<p>So this is the idea of a shadow biosphere</p>
<p>that there actually might just be</p>
<p>completely other life on Earth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so alien that we don&rsquo;t even know what it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to talk to you about the shadow biosphere.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a fun one.</p>
<p>In a second, but first, let me ask for the other alternative,</p>
<p>which is panspermia.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the idea, the hypothesis that life exists</p>
<p>elsewhere in the universe and got to us</p>
<p>through like an asteroid or a planetoid</p>
<p>or some, according to Wikipedia, space dust,</p>
<p>whatever the heck that is.</p>
<p>It sounds fun.</p>
<p>But basically, it rode along whatever kind of rock</p>
<p>and got to us.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s at all a possibility?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So I think the reason that most original life scientists</p>
<p>are interested in the original life on Earth</p>
<p>and say not the original life on Mars</p>
<p>and then panspermia,</p>
<p>the exchange of life between planets being the explanation</p>
<p>is once you start removing the original life from Earth,</p>
<p>you know even less about it</p>
<p>than you do if you study it on Earth.</p>
<p>Although, I think there are ways</p>
<p>of reformulating the problem.</p>
<p>This is why I said earlier,</p>
<p>oh, you mean the historical original life problem.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t mean the problem of how does life arise</p>
<p>in the universe and what the universal principles are</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this historic problem,</p>
<p>how did it happen on early Earth?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a more tractable general problem</p>
<p>of how does it happen?</p>
<p>And how does it happen is something we can actually ask</p>
<p>in the lab.</p>
<p>How did it happen on early Earth</p>
<p>is a much more detailed and nuanced question</p>
<p>and requires detailed knowledge of what was happening</p>
<p>on early Earth that we don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m personally more interested in general mechanisms.</p>
<p>So to me, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it happened on Earth</p>
<p>or it happened on Mars.</p>
<p>It just matters that it happened.</p>
<p>We have evidence it happened.</p>
<p>The question is, did it happen more than once</p>
<p>in our universe?</p>
<p>And so the reason I don&rsquo;t find panspermia</p>
<p>as a particularly,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a fascinating hypothesis.</p>
<p>I definitely think it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And I in particular think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>once you get to the stage of life where you have technology</p>
<p>because then you obviously can spread out</p>
<p>into the cosmos.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also possible for microbes</p>
<p>because we know that certain microorganisms</p>
<p>can survive the journey in space.</p>
<p>And they can live in a rock and go between Mars and Earth.</p>
<p>Like people have done experiments</p>
<p>to try to prove that could work.</p>
<p>So in that scenario, it&rsquo;s super cool</p>
<p>because then you get planetary exchange,</p>
<p>but say we go look for life on Mars</p>
<p>and it ends up being exactly the same life we have on Earth,</p>
<p>biochemically speaking,</p>
<p>then we haven&rsquo;t really discovered something new</p>
<p>about the universe.</p>
<p>What kind of aliens are possible</p>
<p>were there other origin of life events?</p>
<p>If we find, if all the life we ever find</p>
<p>is the same origin of life event in the universe,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t help me solve my problem.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s possible that that would be a sign</p>
<p>that you could separate the environment</p>
<p>from the basic ingredients.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So you can have like a life gun</p>
<p>that you shoot throughout the universe.</p>
<p>And then like once you shoot it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the Simpsons with a makeup gun.</p>
<p>That was a great episode.</p>
<p>When you shoot this life gun,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll find the Earth&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;ll like get sticky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll stick to the Earth&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And that kind of reduces the barrier</p>
<p>of like the time it takes,</p>
<p>the luck it takes to actually,</p>
<p>from nothing, from the basic chemistry,</p>
<p>from the basic physics of the universe</p>
<p>for the life to spring up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think this is actually super important</p>
<p>to just think about,</p>
<p>like does life getting seated on a planet</p>
<p>have to be geochemically compatible with that planet?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re suggesting like we could just shoot guns in space</p>
<p>and like life could go to Mars</p>
<p>and then it would just live there and be happy there.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s actually an open question.</p>
<p>So one of the things I was gonna say in response</p>
<p>to your question about whether the origin of life</p>
<p>happened once or multiple times,</p>
<p>is for me personally right now in my thinking,</p>
<p>although this changes on a weekly basis,</p>
<p>but is that I think of life more as a planetary phenomenon.</p>
<p>So I think the origin of life</p>
<p>because life is so intimately tied to planetary cycles</p>
<p>and planetary processes,</p>
<p>and this goes all the way back</p>
<p>through the history of our planet,</p>
<p>that the origin of life itself grew out of geochemistry</p>
<p>and became coupled and controlled geochemistry.</p>
<p>And when we start to talk about life existing on the planet</p>
<p>is when we have evidence of life</p>
<p>actually influencing properties of the planet.</p>
<p>And so if life is a planetary property,</p>
<p>then going to Mars is not a trivial thing</p>
<p>because you basically have to make Mars more Earth like.</p>
<p>And so in some sense,</p>
<p>like when I think about sort of longterm vision</p>
<p>of humans in space, for example,</p>
<p>really what you&rsquo;re talking about when you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s send our civilization to Mars</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re not saying let&rsquo;s send our civilization to Mars,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying let&rsquo;s reproduce our planet on Mars.</p>
<p>Like the information from our planet</p>
<p>actually has to go to Mars and make Mars more Earth like,</p>
<p>which means that you&rsquo;re now having a reproduction process,</p>
<p>like a cell reproduces itself</p>
<p>to propagate information in the future.</p>
<p>Planets have to figure out how to reproduce their conditions,</p>
<p>including geochemical conditions on other planets</p>
<p>in order to actually reproduce life in the universe,</p>
<p>which is kind of a little bit radical,</p>
<p>but I think for longterm sustainability</p>
<p>of life on a planet, that&rsquo;s absolutely essential.</p>
<p>Okay, so if we were to think about life</p>
<p>as a planetary phenomena,</p>
<p>and so life on Mars would be best</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s way different than life on Earth,</p>
<p>we have to ask the very basic question</p>
<p>of what is life?</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right question to ask.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to get there, right?</p>
<p>So I&hellip; Cross it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, cross it off your list, it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Next question.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I mean, I think it has an answer,</p>
<p>but I think the part of the problem is,</p>
<p>you know, most of the places in science</p>
<p>where we get really stuck</p>
<p>is because we don&rsquo;t know what questions to ask.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t answer a question</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re asking the wrong question.</p>
<p>And I think the way I think about it</p>
<p>is obviously I&rsquo;m interested in what life is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m being a little cheeky when I say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the wrong question to ask.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly like the question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the core of my existence.</p>
<p>But I think the way of framing that</p>
<p>is what is it about our universe</p>
<p>that allows features that we associate life to be there?</p>
<p>And so really what I guess when I&rsquo;m asking that question,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m after is an explanatory framework</p>
<p>for what life is, right?</p>
<p>And so most people, they try to go in and define life</p>
<p>and they say, well, life is say,</p>
<p>a self reproducing chemical system</p>
<p>capable of Darwinian evolution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very popular definition for life.</p>
<p>Or life is something that metabolizes and eats.</p>
<p>That is not how I think about life.</p>
<p>What I think about life is there are principles</p>
<p>and laws that govern our universe</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t understand yet,</p>
<p>that have something to do with how information interacts</p>
<p>with the physical world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I mean even when I say that,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know these rules,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little bit like, I like to use analogies.</p>
<p>You give me time to be like a little long winded</p>
<p>for a second, even in as I,</p>
<p>but sort of like if you look at the history of physics,</p>
<p>for example, this is like,</p>
<p>so we are in the period of the development of thought</p>
<p>on our planet where we don&rsquo;t understand what we are yet.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>There was a period of thought in the history of our planet</p>
<p>where we didn&rsquo;t understand what gravity was.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t understand, for example,</p>
<p>that planets in the heavens were actually planets</p>
<p>or that they operated by the same laws that we did.</p>
<p>And so there has been this sort of progression</p>
<p>of getting a deeper understanding</p>
<p>of explaining basic phenomena.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not gonna drop the cup.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll drop the water bottle.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Okay, that fell, right?</p>
<p>But why did that fall?</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m a theorist, not an experimentalist.</p>
<p>That could have gone wrong in so many ways.</p>
<p>I know, it could have,</p>
<p>especially if I did the cup and it smashed.</p>
<p>So if you take this view</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s sort of some missing principles,</p>
<p>I associate them to information.</p>
<p>And what the sort of feeling there is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some missing explanatory framework</p>
<p>for how our universe works.</p>
<p>And if we understood that physics,</p>
<p>it would explain what we are.</p>
<p>It might also explain a lot of other features</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t associate to life.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a little like people accept the fact</p>
<p>that gravity is a universal phenomena.</p>
<p>But when we wanna study gravity,</p>
<p>we study things like large scale,</p>
<p>galactic structures or black holes or planets.</p>
<p>If we wanna understand information</p>
<p>and how it operates in the physical world,</p>
<p>we study intelligent systems or living systems</p>
<p>because they are the manifestation of that physics.</p>
<p>And the fact that we can&rsquo;t see that clearly yet,</p>
<p>or we don&rsquo;t have that explanatory framework,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just because we haven&rsquo;t been thinking</p>
<p>about the problem deeply enough.</p>
<p>But I feel like if you&rsquo;re explaining something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deriving it from some more fundamental property.</p>
<p>And of course, I have to say I&rsquo;m wearing my physicist hat.</p>
<p>So I have a huge bias of liking simple,</p>
<p>elegant explanations of the universe</p>
<p>that really are compelling.</p>
<p>But I think one of the things that I&rsquo;ve sort of</p>
<p>maybe in some ways rejected my training as a physicist</p>
<p>is that most of the elegant explanations</p>
<p>that we have so far don&rsquo;t include us in the universe.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t help but think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something really special about what we are.</p>
<p>And there have to be some deep principles at play there.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s sort of my perspective on it.</p>
<p>Now, when you ask me what life is,</p>
<p>I have some ideas of what I think it is,</p>
<p>but I think that we haven&rsquo;t gotten there yet</p>
<p>because we haven&rsquo;t been able to see that structure.</p>
<p>And just to go back to the gravity example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little like in ancient times, they didn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I was talking about stars and heavens and things.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know those were governed by the same principles</p>
<p>as that darned experiment.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where I was going with it.</p>
<p>Once you realize, like Newton did,</p>
<p>that heavenly motions and earthly motions</p>
<p>are governed by the same principles</p>
<p>and you unify terrestrial and celestial motion,</p>
<p>you get these more powerful ideas.</p>
<p>And I think where life is is somehow unifying</p>
<p>these abstract ideas of computation and information</p>
<p>with the physical world, with matter,</p>
<p>and realizing that there&rsquo;s some explanatory framework</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not physics and it&rsquo;s not computation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s deeper.</p>
<p>So answering the question of what is life</p>
<p>requires deeply understanding something about the universe</p>
<p>as information processing, the universe is computation.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something about, like would,</p>
<p>once you come up with an answer to what is life,</p>
<p>will the words information and computation</p>
<p>be in the paragraph that answer?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Oh, damn it, okay.</p>
<p>I know, it doesn&rsquo;t help, does it?</p>
<p>I know, I hate, actually I hate this about what I do</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so hard to communicate, right, with words.</p>
<p>Like when you have words that are ideas</p>
<p>that have historically described one thing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to describe something</p>
<p>people haven&rsquo;t seen yet, and the words just don&rsquo;t fit.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s wrong, is it too ambiguous, the word information?</p>
<p>We could switch to binary if you want.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s binary either.</p>
<p>I think information&rsquo;s just loaded.</p>
<p>I use it, so the other way I might talk about it</p>
<p>is the physics of causation, but I think that&rsquo;s worse</p>
<p>because causation is even more loaded word</p>
<p>than information.</p>
<p>So causation is fundamental, you think?</p>
<p>I do, yeah, and in some sense, I think the physics,</p>
<p>so this is the really radical part,</p>
<p>some sense, like when I really think about it</p>
<p>sort of most deeply, what I think life is</p>
<p>is actually the physics of existence,</p>
<p>what gets to exist and why.</p>
<p>And for simple elementary particles,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not very complicated</p>
<p>because the interactions are simple,</p>
<p>but for things like you and me and human civilizations,</p>
<p>what comes next in the universe</p>
<p>is really dependent on what came before,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a huge space of possibilities</p>
<p>of things that can exist.</p>
<p>And when I say information and causation,</p>
<p>what I mean is why is it that cups evolved in the universe</p>
<p>and not some other object that could deliver water</p>
<p>and not spill it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you would call it.</p>
<p>Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t be a cup, but it&rsquo;s a huge,</p>
<p>people talk about the space of things that could exist</p>
<p>as being actually infinitely large, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I believe in infinity,</p>
<p>but I do think that there is something very interesting</p>
<p>about the problem of what exists</p>
<p>in its relationship to life.</p>
<p>So do you think the set of things</p>
<p>that could exist is finite?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very large, but if we were to think</p>
<p>about the physics of existence,</p>
<p>how many shapes of mugs can there be?</p>
<p>In the initial programming.</p>
<p>I should go to the math department for that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not a topology question.</p>
<p>I just mean, maybe another way to ask is</p>
<p>what do you think is fundamental to the universe</p>
<p>and what is emergent?</p>
<p>So if existence, are we supposed to think of that</p>
<p>as somehow fundamental, you think?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a couple of problems in physics</p>
<p>that I think this is related to.</p>
<p>One is why does mathematics work</p>
<p>at describing reality so well?</p>
<p>And then there is this problem of we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>why the laws of physics are the way they are,</p>
<p>or why certain things get to exist,</p>
<p>or what put in place the initial condition of our universe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all of these sort of really deep and big problems,</p>
<p>and they all indirectly are related, I think,</p>
<p>to the same kind of thing that,</p>
<p>our physics is really good</p>
<p>if you specify the initial condition</p>
<p>at specifying a certain sequence of events,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t deal with the fact</p>
<p>that other things could have happened,</p>
<p>which is kind of an informational property,</p>
<p>like a counterfactual property.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not good at explaining</p>
<p>this conversation right now.</p>
<p>There are certain things that are outside</p>
<p>the explanatory reach of current physics,</p>
<p>and I think they require looking at it</p>
<p>from a completely different direction.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t wanna have to fine tune</p>
<p>the initial condition of the universe</p>
<p>to specify precisely all the information</p>
<p>in this conversation.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a ridiculous assertion.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s sort of like how people wanna frame it</p>
<p>when they talk about the standard model is sufficient</p>
<p>if we had computing power</p>
<p>to basically explain all of life in our existence.</p>
<p>An interesting thing you said</p>
<p>is the way we think about information computation</p>
<p>is by observing a particular kind of systems on Earth</p>
<p>that exhibit something we think of as intelligence.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like looking at, I guess, the tip of an iceberg,</p>
<p>and we should be really looking at the fundamentals</p>
<p>of the iceberg, like what makes water and ice</p>
<p>and the chemistry from which intelligence emerges,</p>
<p>essentially. Yes, yes.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just couple the information from the physics,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve gotten really good at doing,</p>
<p>especially with sort of the modern age</p>
<p>where software is so abstracted from hardware.</p>
<p>But the entire process of biological evolution</p>
<p>has basically been built,</p>
<p>like been building layers of increasing abstraction.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really hard to see that physics in us,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much clearer to see it in molecules.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I guess I&rsquo;m trying to figure out</p>
<p>what do you think are the best tools to look at it?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>An open mind?</p>
<p>Is that a tool?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the physics of an open mind?</p>
<p>I think if we solve that, we&rsquo;ll solve everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying an open mind</p>
<p>because I think the biggest stumbling block</p>
<p>to understanding sort of the things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to articulate,</p>
<p>and when I talk also with colleagues</p>
<p>that are thinking deeply about these same issues,</p>
<p>is none of it is inconsistent with what we know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just such a radically different perception</p>
<p>of the way we understand things now</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard for people to get there.</p>
<p>And in some ways you have to almost forget</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ve learned in order to learn something new, right?</p>
<p>So I feel like most of my career</p>
<p>trying to understand the problem of life</p>
<p>has been variously forgetting</p>
<p>and then relearning things that I learned in physics.</p>
<p>And I think you have to have a capacity to learn things,</p>
<p>but then accept that things that you learned</p>
<p>might not be true or might need refinement or reframing.</p>
<p>And the best way I can say that</p>
<p>is just like with a physics education,</p>
<p>there are just certain things you&rsquo;re told in undergrad</p>
<p>that are like facts about the world.</p>
<p>And your physics professors never tell you</p>
<p>that those facts actually emerge from a human mind, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re taught to think about,</p>
<p>say the laws of physics, for example,</p>
<p>as this like autonomous thing</p>
<p>that exists outside of our universe</p>
<p>and tells our universe how it works.</p>
<p>But the laws of physics were invented by human minds</p>
<p>to describe things that are regularities</p>
<p>in our everyday experience.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t exist autonomous to the universe.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s like turtles on top of turtles,</p>
<p>but eventually it gets to the human mind,</p>
<p>and then you have to explain the human mind with the turtles.</p>
<p>So you have to, it comes from humans,</p>
<p>this understanding, this simplification of the universe,</p>
<p>these models.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named Stephen Wolfram.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a concept called cellular automata.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some mysteries in these systems</p>
<p>that are computational in nature</p>
<p>that have maybe echoes of the kind of mysteries</p>
<p>we should need to solve to understand what is life.</p>
<p>So if we could talk, take a computational view of things,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s something compelling</p>
<p>to reducing everything down to computation,</p>
<p>like the universe is computation,</p>
<p>and then trying to understand life?</p>
<p>So throw away the biology, throw away the chemistry,</p>
<p>throw away even the physics</p>
<p>that you learn undergrad and graduate school,</p>
<p>and more look at these simple little systems,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s cellular automata or whatever the heck</p>
<p>kind of computational systems</p>
<p>that operate on simple local rules</p>
<p>and then create complexity as they evolve.</p>
<p>Is it at all, do you think, productive</p>
<p>to focus on those kinds of systems</p>
<p>to get an inkling of what is life?</p>
<p>And if it is, do you think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to come up with some kind of laws and principles</p>
<p>about what makes life in those computational systems?</p>
<p>So I like cellular automata.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re good toy models,</p>
<p>but mostly where I&rsquo;ve thought about them and used them</p>
<p>is to actually, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>poke at sort of the current conceptual framework</p>
<p>that we have and see where the flaws are.</p>
<p>So I think the part that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>that people find intriguing is that</p>
<p>if you have a fairly simple rule</p>
<p>and you specify some initial condition</p>
<p>and you run that rule on that initial condition,</p>
<p>you could get really complex patterns emerging.</p>
<p>And ooh, doesn&rsquo;t that look lifelike?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like really surprising,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it really surprising?</p>
<p>It is really surprising, and they&rsquo;re beautiful.</p>
<p>And I think they have a lot of nice features</p>
<p>associated to them.</p>
<p>I think the things that I find,</p>
<p>yeah, so I do think as a proof of principle</p>
<p>that you can get complex things emerging from simple rules.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>As a sort of proof of principle about some of the ways</p>
<p>that we might think of computation</p>
<p>as being sort of a fundamental principle</p>
<p>for dynamical systems</p>
<p>and maybe the evolution of the universe as a whole,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a great model system.</p>
<p>As an explanatory framework for life,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re a bit problematic</p>
<p>for the same reason that the laws of physics</p>
<p>are a bit problematic.</p>
<p>And the clearest way I can articulate that</p>
<p>is like cellular automata are actually cast</p>
<p>in sort of a conceptual framework</p>
<p>for how the universe should be described</p>
<p>that goes all the way back to Newton, in fact,</p>
<p>with this idea that we can have a fixed law of motion,</p>
<p>which exists sort of, it&rsquo;s given to you.</p>
<p>The great programmer in the sky gave you this equation</p>
<p>or this rule, and then you just run with it.</p>
<p>And the rule doesn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>so a good feature of the rule</p>
<p>is it doesn&rsquo;t have specified in the rule</p>
<p>information about the patterns it generates.</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t want, for example,</p>
<p>my cup or my water bottle or me sitting here</p>
<p>to be specified in the laws of physics.</p>
<p>That would be ridiculous</p>
<p>because it wouldn&rsquo;t be a very simple explanation</p>
<p>of all the things happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d have to explain everything.</p>
<p>So, and cellular automata have that feature</p>
<p>and the laws of physics have that feature.</p>
<p>But you also need to specify the initial condition.</p>
<p>And it also, it basically means</p>
<p>that everything that happens</p>
<p>is sort of a consequence of that initial condition.</p>
<p>And I think this kind of framework</p>
<p>is just not the right one for biology.</p>
<p>And part of the way that it&rsquo;s easiest to see this</p>
<p>is a lot of people talk about self reference</p>
<p>being important in life.</p>
<p>The fact that, you know,</p>
<p>like the genome has information encoded in it,</p>
<p>that information gets read out.</p>
<p>It specifies something about the architecture of a cell.</p>
<p>The architecture of the cell includes the genome.</p>
<p>So the genome has basically self referential information.</p>
<p>Self reference obviously comes up in computational law</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of foundational to Turing&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>and what G√∂del did with the incompleteness theorems</p>
<p>and things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of parallels there</p>
<p>and people have talked about that at depth.</p>
<p>But the other way of kind of thinking about it</p>
<p>in terms of like a more physicsy way of talking about it</p>
<p>is that what it looks like in biology</p>
<p>is that the rules or the laws depend on the state.</p>
<p>This is typical in computer science.</p>
<p>This is obvious to you.</p>
<p>You know, the update rule depends</p>
<p>on the state of the machine, right?</p>
<p>But, you know, you don&rsquo;t think about, you know,</p>
<p>that being sort of the dynamic in physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, the rules given to you</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s a very special subclass say of computations</p>
<p>if, you know, you don&rsquo;t ever change the update.</p>
<p>But in biology, it seems to be that the state</p>
<p>and the law change together as a function of time</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have that as a paradigm in physics.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people talk about this</p>
<p>as being kind of a perplexing feature</p>
<p>that maybe there are certain scenarios</p>
<p>where the laws of physics</p>
<p>or the laws that govern a particular system</p>
<p>actually change as a function of the state of that system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s trippy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, the hope of physics, it&rsquo;s a hope, I guess,</p>
<p>but often stated as a underlying assumption</p>
<p>is that the law is static.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And even having laws that vary in time</p>
<p>and not even as a function of the state is very radical.</p>
<p>When you&hellip;</p>
<p>The time in general, like you wanna remove time</p>
<p>from the equation as much as possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interesting things in this</p>
<p>like when we think sort of more deeply</p>
<p>about the actual physics that we&rsquo;re trying to propose</p>
<p>governs life with me with collaborators</p>
<p>and then also other people that think about similar things</p>
<p>that time might actually be fundamental</p>
<p>and there really is an ordering to time.</p>
<p>And that events in the universe are unique</p>
<p>because they have a particular, they happen,</p>
<p>like an object in the universe</p>
<p>requires a certain history of events in order to exist,</p>
<p>which therefore suggests</p>
<p>that time really does have an ordering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the flow of time</p>
<p>and our perception of time, just the ordering of events.</p>
<p>Causation of things.</p>
<p>Yes, causation, there&rsquo;s that word again.</p>
<p>So causation, that&rsquo;s when you say time, you mean causation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In your proposed model of the physics of life,</p>
<p>the fundamental thing would be causation.</p>
<p>If you were to bet your money</p>
<p>on one particular horse or whatever.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then space is emergent.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So everything&rsquo;s emergent except time.</p>
<p>Kind of, yeah, or causation.</p>
<p>And laws change all the time.</p>
<p>Why does it look like laws are the same?</p>
<p>Laws, well, because, well, one way,</p>
<p>and I actually, this idea comes from Lee Cronin</p>
<p>because I work with him very closely on these things,</p>
<p>is that the laws of physics look the way they do</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re low memory laws.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t require a lot of information to specify them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very easy for the universe to implement.</p>
<p>But if you get something like me, for example,</p>
<p>I require 4 billion year history to exist in the universe.</p>
<p>I come with a lot of historical baggage.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of what I am</p>
<p>as a set of causes that exist in the universe.</p>
<p>So I have local rules that apply to me</p>
<p>that are associated with sort of the information</p>
<p>in my history that aren&rsquo;t universal</p>
<p>to every object in the universe.</p>
<p>And there are some things that are very easy</p>
<p>to implement low memory rules</p>
<p>that apply to everything in the universe.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no shortcuts to you.</p>
<p>No, so yeah, I don&rsquo;t believe in things like Boltzmann brains</p>
<p>or fluctuations out of the vacuum</p>
<p>that can produce things like your desk ornaments.</p>
<p>I actually think they require</p>
<p>a particular causal chain of events to exist.</p>
<p>Well, I appreciate the togetherness of that,</p>
<p>but so how does that,</p>
<p>if we have to simulate the entire universe</p>
<p>to create the ornaments in the two of us,</p>
<p>how are we supposed to create engineer life in the lab?</p>
<p>This goes back to sort of the critique of the RNA world.</p>
<p>I think one of the problems,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get to answer your question,</p>
<p>but I think this is kind of relevant here.</p>
<p>One of the problems with the RNA world,</p>
<p>when we test it in the laboratory,</p>
<p>is how much information we&rsquo;re putting into the experiment.</p>
<p>We specify the flasks, we make pure reagents,</p>
<p>we mix them, we take them out,</p>
<p>we put them in the next flask,</p>
<p>we change the pH, we change the UV light,</p>
<p>and then we get a molecule,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not even an RNA molecule necessarily,</p>
<p>it might just be a base, right?</p>
<p>And so people don&rsquo;t usually think about the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re agents in the universe making that experiment,</p>
<p>and therefore we put a little bit of life</p>
<p>into that experiment,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s part of our biological lineage,</p>
<p>in the same sense that I am a part of the biological lineage.</p>
<p>The experiment is.</p>
<p>I mean, our ideas are injecting life.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the constraints that we put on the experiments,</p>
<p>because those conditions wouldn&rsquo;t exist in the universe</p>
<p>on planet Earth at that time</p>
<p>without us as the boundary condition, right?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Even though we&rsquo;re not actually adding</p>
<p>any actual chemistry or biology</p>
<p>that could be identified as life,</p>
<p>are the constraints we&rsquo;re adding to the experiment,</p>
<p>the design of the experiment.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can think of the design experiment as a program.</p>
<p>You put information in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an algorithmic procedure that you design the experiment.</p>
<p>And so the origin of life problem</p>
<p>becomes one of minimizing the information</p>
<p>we put into physics</p>
<p>to actually watch the spontaneous origin of life.</p>
<p>Can we have, so can, is it possible in the lab</p>
<p>to have an information vacuum then?</p>
<p>So like.</p>
<p>If we could, we would, that would be amazing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question for, more for Lee.</p>
<p>Yeah, you guys, by the way,</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t know, Lee Cronin is,</p>
<p>you guys are colleagues.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to listen to the two of you talking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s great sort of chemistry</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re brilliant brainstorming together.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really exciting community here</p>
<p>of brilliant people from different disciplines</p>
<p>working on the problem of life, of complexity,</p>
<p>of, I don&rsquo;t know, whatever.</p>
<p>The words fail us to describe the exact problem</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to actually understand here.</p>
<p>Intelligence, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Okay, so what, from a lab perspective,</p>
<p>so Lee, I guess, would you call him a chemist?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>I think by training he&rsquo;s a chemist,</p>
<p>but I think most of the people that work in the field,</p>
<p>we do have lost their discipline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t answer your question earlier.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you call him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I call myself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I call any of my friends.</p>
<p>So why is it so hard to create,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an interesting question,</p>
<p>to create biological life in the lab.</p>
<p>Like from your perspective,</p>
<p>is that an important problem to work on</p>
<p>to try to recreate the historical origin of life on Earth</p>
<p>or echoes of the historical origin?</p>
<p>I think echoes is more appropriate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think asking the question</p>
<p>of what was the exact historical sequence of events</p>
<p>and engineering every step in the process</p>
<p>to make exactly the chemistry of life on Earth as we know it</p>
<p>is a meaningful way of asking the question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little bit like,</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;re in computer science,</p>
<p>like if you know the answer to a problem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to find a program to specify the output, right?</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t know the answer a priori,</p>
<p>finding an algorithm for it,</p>
<p>like say finding a prime or something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to verify it&rsquo;s a prime number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find the next prime.</p>
<p>And the way the origin of life is structured right now</p>
<p>in the historical problem is you know the answer</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to retrodict it by breaking it down</p>
<p>into the set of procedures</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re putting a lot of information in.</p>
<p>And what we need to do is ask the question</p>
<p>of how is it that the rules of how our universe is structured</p>
<p>permit things like life to exist</p>
<p>and what is the phenomena of life?</p>
<p>And those questions are obviously</p>
<p>essentially the same question.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re looking essentially for this missing physics,</p>
<p>this missing explanation for what we are,</p>
<p>and you need to set up proper experiments</p>
<p>that are gonna allow you to probe</p>
<p>the vast complexity of chemistry in an unconstrained way</p>
<p>with as little information put in as possible</p>
<p>to see when things, when does information actually emerge?</p>
<p>How does it emerge?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>And part of the sort of conjecture we have</p>
<p>is that this physics only becomes relevant</p>
<p>or at least this is my personal conjecture</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of validated</p>
<p>by this kind of theory experiment collaboration</p>
<p>that we have working in this area that this, you know,</p>
<p>sort of, I made the point about like gravity</p>
<p>existing everywhere, right?</p>
<p>But when you study an atomic nucleus,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t care about gravity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not relevant physics there, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weak, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And so this idea that there&rsquo;s kind of a physics</p>
<p>associated with information,</p>
<p>for me, it&rsquo;s very evident that that physics</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t become relevant until you need information</p>
<p>to specify the existence of a particular object.</p>
<p>And the scale of reality where that happens</p>
<p>is in chemistry because of the combinatorial diversity</p>
<p>of chemical objects that can exist far out,</p>
<p>exceeds the amount of resources in our universe.</p>
<p>So if you want it, you can&rsquo;t make every possible protein</p>
<p>of length, you know, 200 amino acids,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough resources.</p>
<p>So in order for this particular protein to exist</p>
<p>and this protein to exist in high abundance</p>
<p>means that you have to have a system that has knowledge</p>
<p>of the existence of that protein and can build it.</p>
<p>So existence comes to be at the chemical level.</p>
<p>So existence is most, is best understood</p>
<p>at the chemical level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s most evident.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like, nobody argues that gravity</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist in an atomic nucleus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not relevant physics there, right?</p>
<p>So the physics of information.</p>
<p>Is everywhere.</p>
<p>It exists at every combinatorial scale,</p>
<p>but it becomes more and more relevant</p>
<p>the more set of possibilities that could exist</p>
<p>because you have to specify more and more</p>
<p>about why this thing exists and not the infinite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an infinite set, but you know,</p>
<p>the set of undefined set of other things that could exist.</p>
<p>So can I ask a weird question, which is,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s look into the future.</p>
<p>I try that every day.</p>
<p>It never works.</p>
<p>So say a Nobel prize is given in physics,</p>
<p>maybe chemistry for discovering the origin of life.</p>
<p>No, but not the historical origin.</p>
<p>Some kind of thing that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>What exactly would, what do you think that,</p>
<p>like, what do you think that person,</p>
<p>maybe you did to get that Nobel prize?</p>
<p>Like what would they have to have done?</p>
<p>Cause you can do a bunch of experiments that go</p>
<p>like within the aha moment.</p>
<p>Like you rarely get the Nobel prize for like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve solved everything, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some inkling of some deep truth.</p>
<p>Like what do you think that would actually look like?</p>
<p>Would it be an experimental result?</p>
<p>I mean, it will have to have some kind of experimental,</p>
<p>maybe validation component.</p>
<p>So what would that look like?</p>
<p>This is an excellent question.</p>
<p>I want to, sorry, I&rsquo;m going to make a quick point,</p>
<p>which is just a slight tangent.</p>
<p>But you know, like when people ask about the origin of mass,</p>
<p>and like looking for the Higgs mechanism and things,</p>
<p>they never are like,</p>
<p>we need to find the historical origins of life</p>
<p>in the early unit.</p>
<p>Although those things are related, right?</p>
<p>So this problem of origins of life in the lab,</p>
<p>I think is really important.</p>
<p>But the Higgs is a good example</p>
<p>because you had theory to guide it.</p>
<p>So somehow you need to have an explanatory framework</p>
<p>that can say that we should be looking for these features</p>
<p>and explain why they might be there</p>
<p>and then be able to do the experiment</p>
<p>and demonstrate that it matches with the theory.</p>
<p>But it has to be something that is outside</p>
<p>sort of the paradigm of what we might expect</p>
<p>based on what we know, right?</p>
<p>So this is a really sort of tall order.</p>
<p>And I think, I mean, I guess the way people would think</p>
<p>about it is like, you know,</p>
<p>if you had a bacteria that climbed out of your test tube</p>
<p>or something, and it was like, you know,</p>
<p>moving around on the surface,</p>
<p>that would be ultimate validation.</p>
<p>You saw the origin of life in an experiment,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite what we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;re looking for is evidence</p>
<p>of when information that originated</p>
<p>within the bounds of your experiment</p>
<p>and you can demonstrably prove emerged spontaneously</p>
<p>in your experiment, wasn&rsquo;t put in by you,</p>
<p>actually started to govern the future dynamics</p>
<p>of that system and specify it.</p>
<p>And you could somehow relate those two features directly.</p>
<p>So you know that the program specifying</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in that system</p>
<p>is actually internal to that system.</p>
<p>Like say you have a chemical thing in a box.</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s one Nobel Prize winning experiment,</p>
<p>which is like information in some fundamental way</p>
<p>originated within the constraints of the system</p>
<p>without you injecting anything.</p>
<p>But another experiment is you injected something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And got out information.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So like you injected, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like some sugar and like something that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>feel like it should be information.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I actually know, I mean,</p>
<p>sugar is information, right?</p>
<p>So part of the argument here is that every physical object</p>
<p>is, well, it&rsquo;s information,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a set of causal histories</p>
<p>and also a set of possible futures.</p>
<p>So there is an experiment that I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about</p>
<p>with Lee Cronin, but also with Michael Lockman</p>
<p>and Chris Kempis who are at Santa Fe</p>
<p>about this idea that sometimes we talk about</p>
<p>as like seeding assembly,</p>
<p>which is you take a high complexity,</p>
<p>like an object that exists in the universe</p>
<p>because of a long causal history,</p>
<p>and you seed it into a system of lower causal history.</p>
<p>And then suddenly you see all of this complexity</p>
<p>being generated.</p>
<p>So I think another validation of the physics would be,</p>
<p>say you engineer an organism</p>
<p>by purposefully introducing something</p>
<p>where you understand the relationship</p>
<p>between the causal history of the organism</p>
<p>and the say very complex chemical set of ingredients</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re adding to it.</p>
<p>And then you can predict the future evolution of that system</p>
<p>to some statistical set of constraints and possibilities</p>
<p>for what it will look like in the future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a physical structure, obviously,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m composed of atoms,</p>
<p>the configuration of them</p>
<p>and the fact that they happen to be me</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;m not actually my atoms,</p>
<p>I am a informational pattern</p>
<p>that keeps re patterning those atoms into Sarah.</p>
<p>And I have also associated to me</p>
<p>like a space of possible things that could exist</p>
<p>that I can help mediate come into existence</p>
<p>because of the information in my history.</p>
<p>And so when you understand sort of that</p>
<p>time is a real thing embedded in a physical object,</p>
<p>then it becomes possible to talk about</p>
<p>how histories when they interact</p>
<p>and a history is not a unique thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a set of possibilities.</p>
<p>When they interact,</p>
<p>how do they specify what&rsquo;s coming next?</p>
<p>And then where does the novelty come from in that structure?</p>
<p>Cause some of it is kind of things</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t existed in the past can exist in the future.</p>
<p>Let me ask about this entity that you call Sarah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I talk to myself about myself in third person sometimes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>So maybe this is a good time to bring up consciousness.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been here all along.</p>
<p>Well, has it?</p>
<p>So, I mean that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>At least in this conversation,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve been conscious most of it,</p>
<p>but maybe I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>So speak for yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re projecting your consciousness onto me.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m conscious or not.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Is that, you talked about the physics of existence,</p>
<p>you talked about the emergence of causality,</p>
<p>sorry, you talked about causality and time</p>
<p>being fundamental to the universe.</p>
<p>Where does consciousness fit into all of this?</p>
<p>Like, do you draw any kind of inspiration or value</p>
<p>with the idea of panpsychism</p>
<p>that maybe one of the things that we ought to understand</p>
<p>is the physics of consciousness?</p>
<p>Like one of the missing pieces in the physics view</p>
<p>of the world is understanding the physics of consciousness.</p>
<p>Or like that word has so many concepts underneath it,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s put consciousness as a label</p>
<p>on a black box of mystery that we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Do you think that black box holds the key</p>
<p>to finally answering the question</p>
<p>of the physics of life?</p>
<p>The problems are absolutely related.</p>
<p>I think most, and I&rsquo;m interested in both</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just interested in what we are.</p>
<p>And to me, the most interesting feature</p>
<p>of what we are is our minds</p>
<p>and the way they interact with our minds.</p>
<p>Like minds are the most beautiful thing</p>
<p>that exists in the universe.</p>
<p>So how do they come to be?</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>So when you say we, you mean humans.</p>
<p>I mean humans right now, but that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a human.</p>
<p>Or at least I think I am.</p>
<p>But you think there&rsquo;s something special</p>
<p>to this particular?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not a human centric thinker.</p>
<p>But are you one entity?</p>
<p>You said a bunch of stuff came together to make a Sarah.</p>
<p>Like do you think of yourself as one entity</p>
<p>or are you just a bunch of different components?</p>
<p>Like is there any value to understand the physics of Sarah?</p>
<p>Or are you just a bunch of different things</p>
<p>that are like a nice little temporary side effect?</p>
<p>Yeah, you could think of me as a bundle of information</p>
<p>that just became temporarily aggregated</p>
<p>into your individual, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I agree with that view.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take that as a compliment actually.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, that bundle of information</p>
<p>has become conscious.</p>
<p>Or at least keeps calling herself conscious.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;m conscious right now,</p>
<p>but I might not be, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Or you wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So yeah, so this is the problem.</p>
<p>So yeah, usually people when they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about consciousness are worried</p>
<p>about the subjective experience.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re conscious</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>this conversation right now.</p>
<p>And nor do you know if I&rsquo;m experiencing</p>
<p>the conversation right now.</p>
<p>And so this is why this is called</p>
<p>the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p>because it seems impenetrable from the outside</p>
<p>to know if something&rsquo;s having a conscious experience.</p>
<p>And I really like the idea of also</p>
<p>like the hard problem of matter,</p>
<p>which is related to the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>which is you don&rsquo;t know the intrinsic properties</p>
<p>of an electron not interacting,</p>
<p>say for example, with anything else in the universe.</p>
<p>All the properties of anything that exists</p>
<p>in the universe are defined by its interaction</p>
<p>because you have to interact with it</p>
<p>in order to be able to observe it.</p>
<p>So we can only actually know the things</p>
<p>that are observable from the outside.</p>
<p>And so this is one of the reasons</p>
<p>that consciousness is hard for science</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re asking questions</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s subjective</p>
<p>and supposed to be intrinsic to what that thing is</p>
<p>as it exists and how it feels about existing.</p>
<p>And so I have thought a lot about this problem</p>
<p>and its relationship to the problem of life.</p>
<p>And the only thing I can come up with</p>
<p>to try to make that problem scientifically tractable</p>
<p>and also relate it to how I think about the physics of life</p>
<p>is to ask the question,</p>
<p>are there things that can only happen in the universe</p>
<p>because there are physical systems</p>
<p>that have subjective experience?</p>
<p>So does subjective experience have different causes</p>
<p>that things that it can cause to occur</p>
<p>that would happen in the absence of that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s a meaningful way</p>
<p>of asking the question of consciousness.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t ask if you&rsquo;re having experience right now,</p>
<p>but I can ask if you having experience right now</p>
<p>changes something about you</p>
<p>and the way you interact with the world.</p>
<p>So does stuff happen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question to ask, does stuff happen</p>
<p>if consciousness is?</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s a real physical thing, right?</p>
<p>It has physical consequences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a physicist, I&rsquo;m biased,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t get rid of that bias.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really deeply ingrained.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried, but it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>But I mean, you&rsquo;re saying information is physical too.</p>
<p>So like virtual reality, simulation,</p>
<p>all that program is physical too in the sense of.</p>
<p>Yes, everything&rsquo;s physical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not physical the way it&rsquo;s represented in our minds.</p>
<p>Right, so you, I love your Twitter.</p>
<p>So you tweet these like deep thoughts, deep thoughts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a theorist does</p>
<p>when she&rsquo;s trying to experiment.</p>
<p>Is tweet?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like sitting there.</p>
<p>I mean, I could just imagine you sitting there</p>
<p>for like hours and all of a sudden just like</p>
<p>this thought comes out and you get a little</p>
<p>like inkling into the thought process.</p>
<p>Yeah, usually it&rsquo;s like when I&rsquo;m running between things</p>
<p>and not so much when I&rsquo;ve had deep thoughts.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, so you.</p>
<p>Deep thoughts are hard to articulate.</p>
<p>One of the things you tweeted is,</p>
<p>ideologically, there are many parallels</p>
<p>between the search for neural correlates of consciousness</p>
<p>and for chemical correlates of life.</p>
<p>How the neuroscience and astrobiology communities</p>
<p>treat those correlates is entirely different.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate against this kind of the parallels?</p>
<p>It has to do a little bit with the consciousness</p>
<p>and the matter thing you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t remember what state of mind I was</p>
<p>when I was actually thinking about that.</p>
<p>But I think part of it is.</p>
<p>I bet you never thought you were gonna have</p>
<p>to analyze your own tweets.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting historical juxtaposition of thinking.</p>
<p>So the tweet is a historical.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing an assembly experiment right now</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re bringing a thought from the past</p>
<p>into the present and trying to actually.</p>
<p>In a lab.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>This is experimental science right here</p>
<p>on the podcast live.</p>
<p>So go, let&rsquo;s see how the consciousness evolves on this one.</p>
<p>Yeah, so in neuroscience, it&rsquo;s kind of accepted</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t get at the subjective aspect</p>
<p>of consciousness.</p>
<p>So people are very interested in what would be a correlate</p>
<p>of consciousness.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a correlate?</p>
<p>A correlate is a feature that relates</p>
<p>to conscious activity.</p>
<p>So for example, a verbal report is a correlate</p>
<p>of consciousness because I can tell you when I&rsquo;m conscious.</p>
<p>And then when I&rsquo;m sleeping, for example,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you I&rsquo;m conscious.</p>
<p>So we have this assumption that you&rsquo;re not conscious</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sleeping and you&rsquo;re conscious when you&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s sort of like a very obvious example,</p>
<p>but neuroscientists, which I&rsquo;m no neuroscientist</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not an expert in this field.</p>
<p>So, but they have very sophisticated ways of measuring</p>
<p>activity in our brain and trying to relate that</p>
<p>to verbal report and other proxies for whether someone</p>
<p>is experiencing something.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what is meant by neural correlates.</p>
<p>And then, so when people are trying to think</p>
<p>about studying consciousness or developing theories</p>
<p>for consciousness, they often are trying to build</p>
<p>an experimental bridge to these neural correlates,</p>
<p>recognizing the fact that a neural correlate</p>
<p>may or may not correspond to consciousness</p>
<p>because that problem&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all these associated issues to it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, from a neuroscience perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like fake it till you make it.</p>
<p>So you. Pretty much, yeah.</p>
<p>You fake whatever the correlates are and hopefully</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to summon the thing that is consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>And so the same thing on the chemical correlates of life.</p>
<p>That sounds like, that&rsquo;s an awesome concept.</p>
<p>Is that something that people?</p>
<p>No, I just made that up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That was original to that tweet.</p>
<p>You can cite the tweet.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll write it in a paper someday.</p>
<p>Chemical correlates of life, that&rsquo;s a good title.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, your paper is true</p>
<p>that people should check out, have great titles.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Or papers you&rsquo;re involved with.</p>
<p>So your tweets and titles are stellar and also your ideas,</p>
<p>but the tweets and titles are much more important.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>So. Ideas will live longer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much more diffused though.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s the Trojan,</p>
<p>the tweet is the Trojan horse of the idea</p>
<p>that sticks on for a long time.</p>
<p>Okay, so is there anything to say</p>
<p>about the chemical correlates of life?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re similar kind of ways</p>
<p>of thinking about it,</p>
<p>but you mentioned about the communities.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think in astrobiology, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no concept of chemical correlates of life.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think about it that way.</p>
<p>We think if we find molecules that are involved in biology,</p>
<p>we found life.</p>
<p>So I think one of my motivations there</p>
<p>was just to separate the fact</p>
<p>that life has abstract properties associated to it.</p>
<p>They become imprinted in material substrates</p>
<p>and those substrates are correlates for that thing,</p>
<p>but they are not necessarily</p>
<p>the thing we&rsquo;re actually looking for.</p>
<p>The thing that we&rsquo;re looking for is the physics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s organizing that system to begin with,</p>
<p>not the particular molecules.</p>
<p>In the same sense that, you know,</p>
<p>your consciousness is not your brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s instantiated in your brain.</p>
<p>You know, it has to have a physical substrate,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, the matter is not the thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some other, at least not in the way</p>
<p>that we have come to look at matter,</p>
<p>you know, with traditional physics and things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something else there</p>
<p>and it might be this feature of history</p>
<p>I was talking about,</p>
<p>our time being actually, you know,</p>
<p>physically represented there.</p>
<p>Do you think consciousness can be engineered?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In the same way that life can be engineered?</p>
<p>Well, that was a fast answer.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even think about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a free will.</p>
<p>That was predestined.</p>
<p>No, I do have free will,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>because I mean, you know,</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re backtracking.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>And that was predestined.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no.</p>
<p>No, I do believe in free will,</p>
<p>but I also think that there&rsquo;s kind of an interesting,</p>
<p>you know, like what you&rsquo;re speaking about consciousness.</p>
<p>What are you consciously aware of</p>
<p>versus like what is your subconscious brain</p>
<p>actually processing and doing?</p>
<p>And sometimes there&rsquo;s conflict between your consciousness</p>
<p>and your subconsciousness</p>
<p>or your consciousness is a little slower</p>
<p>than your subconscious.</p>
<p>And intuition is a really important feature of that.</p>
<p>And so a lot of the ways I do my science</p>
<p>is guided by intuition.</p>
<p>So when I give fast answers like that,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t really thought about them</p>
<p>and therefore that&rsquo;s probably telling me something.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s continue the deep analysis of your tweets.</p>
<p>You said that determinism in a tweet,</p>
<p>determinism and randomness play important roles</p>
<p>in understanding what life is.</p>
<p>So let me ask on this topic of free will,</p>
<p>what is determinism, what is randomness</p>
<p>and why the heck do they have anything to do</p>
<p>with understanding life?</p>
<p>Yeah, and you threw free will in there,</p>
<p>just throwing all the stuff in the bag.</p>
<p>Are they not related, determinism and randomness?</p>
<p>No, no, they are related.</p>
<p>No, no, that&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>I was being unfair.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t even capitalize the tweet, by the way.</p>
<p>It was all lowercase.</p>
<p>I must&rsquo;ve been angry.</p>
<p>Oh, that was saying,</p>
<p>can you analyze the emotion behind that?</p>
<p>No, I actually did.</p>
<p>Is it frustration or is it hope?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>So I already argued that I don&rsquo;t think that can happen</p>
<p>without that whole causal history.</p>
<p>And so I guess in some sense,</p>
<p>the determinism for me arises because of the causal history.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not really sure actually</p>
<p>about whether the universe is random or deterministic.</p>
<p>I just had this sort of intuition for a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I agree with it anymore,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still kind of lingering</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know what to do with this question.</p>
<p>But it seems to me, you know,</p>
<p>so you asked the question, what is life?</p>
<p>But you could also, why life?</p>
<p>Why does life exist?</p>
<p>What does the universe need life for?</p>
<p>Not that the universe has needs,</p>
<p>but you know, we have to anthropocentrize things sometimes</p>
<p>to talk about them.</p>
<p>And I had this feeling that if it was possible</p>
<p>for a cup or a desk ornament or a phone on Mars</p>
<p>to spontaneously fluctuate into existence,</p>
<p>the universe didn&rsquo;t need life to create those objects.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t necessary for their existence.</p>
<p>It was just a random fluke event.</p>
<p>And so somehow to me,</p>
<p>it seems that it can&rsquo;t be that those things</p>
<p>formed by random processes,</p>
<p>they actually have to have a set of causes</p>
<p>that accrue and form those things</p>
<p>and they have to have that history.</p>
<p>And so it seems to me that that life</p>
<p>was somehow deeply related to the question</p>
<p>of whether the underlying rules of our universe</p>
<p>had randomness in them or they were fully deterministic.</p>
<p>And in some ways you can think about life</p>
<p>as being the most deterministic part of physics</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s where the causes are precise in some sense.</p>
<p>Or most stable.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;m trying&hellip;</p>
<p>Most stable, yes, most reliable.</p>
<p>Most reliable for the tools of physics.</p>
<p>But where&rsquo;s the randomness come from then?</p>
<p>Okay, so you were speaking with&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone in a tangent,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not sure where we are in the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All of the universe is a kind of tangent.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re embracing the tangent.</p>
<p>So free will, you believe at this current time</p>
<p>that you have free will.</p>
<p>I believe my whole life I have free will.</p>
<p>What is illusion?</p>
<p>No, just kidding.</p>
<p>I still believe it.</p>
<p>You still believe it.</p>
<p>So at the same time you think that</p>
<p>in your conception of the universe,</p>
<p>causality seems to be pretty fundamental.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Which kind of wants the universe to be deterministic.</p>
<p>So how the heck do you think you have a free will</p>
<p>and yet you value causality?</p>
<p>Because I depart from the conception of physics</p>
<p>that you can write down an initial condition</p>
<p>and a fixed law of motion and that will describe everything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no incompatibility</p>
<p>if you are willing to reject that assertion.</p>
<p>So where&rsquo;s the randomness?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the magic that gives birth to the free will?</p>
<p>Is it the randomness of the laws of physics?</p>
<p>No, in my mind what free will is,</p>
<p>is the fact that I as a physical system</p>
<p>have causal control over certain things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have causal control over everything,</p>
<p>but I have a certain set of things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also, as I described,</p>
<p>sort of a nexus of a particular set of histories</p>
<p>that exist in the universe</p>
<p>and a particular set of futures that might exist.</p>
<p>And those futures that might exist are in part specified</p>
<p>by my physical configuration as me.</p>
<p>And therefore, it may not be free will</p>
<p>in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what people mean</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re talking about free will, honestly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the whole discussion&rsquo;s really muddled.</p>
<p>But in the sense that I am a causal agent,</p>
<p>if you wanna call it that, that exists in the universe,</p>
<p>and there are certain things that happen</p>
<p>because I exist as me, then yes, I have free will.</p>
<p>No, but do you, Sarah, have a choice</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going to happen next?</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>If the universe, could I have,</p>
<p>if I run this universe. Yes, I think so.</p>
<p>You have a choice.</p>
<p>Where does the choice come from?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s related to the physics of consciousness.</p>
<p>So one of the things I didn&rsquo;t say about that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe this is me just being hopeful</p>
<p>because maybe I just wanna have free will,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that we can rule out the possibility</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think that we understand enough</p>
<p>about any of these problems.</p>
<p>But I think one of the things that&rsquo;s interesting for me</p>
<p>about the sort of inversion of the question</p>
<p>of consciousness that I proposed</p>
<p>is one of the features that we do</p>
<p>is we have imagination, right?</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t think about imagination</p>
<p>as a physical thing, but it is a physical thing.</p>
<p>It exists in the universe, right?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m like really intrigued by the fact that say,</p>
<p>humans for, another physical system could do this too,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not special to humans,</p>
<p>but for centuries imagined flying machines and rockets,</p>
<p>and then we finally built them, right?</p>
<p>So they were represented in our minds</p>
<p>and on the pages of things that we drew</p>
<p>for hundreds of years before we could build</p>
<p>those physical objects in the universe.</p>
<p>But certainly the existence of rockets</p>
<p>is in part causally,</p>
<p>caused by the fact that we could imagine them.</p>
<p>And so there seems to be this property</p>
<p>that some things don&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve never physically existed in the universe,</p>
<p>but we can imagine the possibility of them existing</p>
<p>and then cause them to exist,</p>
<p>maybe individually or collectively.</p>
<p>And I think that property is related</p>
<p>to what I would say about having choice or free will,</p>
<p>because that set of possibilities,</p>
<p>those set of things that you can imagine</p>
<p>is not constrained to your local physical environment</p>
<p>and history.</p>
<p>And this is what&rsquo;s a little bit different</p>
<p>about intelligence as we see it in humans</p>
<p>and AI that we wanna build than biological intelligence,</p>
<p>because biological intelligence is predicated completely</p>
<p>on the history of things that&rsquo;s seen in the past,</p>
<p>but something happened with the neural architectures</p>
<p>that evolved in multicellular organisms</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t just have access to the past history</p>
<p>of their particular set of events,</p>
<p>but they can imagine things that haven&rsquo;t happened,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t on their timeline,</p>
<p>and as long as they&rsquo;re consistent with the laws of physics,</p>
<p>make them happen.</p>
<p>So this is fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trippy physics, but it exists, so there you go.</p>
<p>I mean, in some sense,</p>
<p>if you look at like general relativity and gravity</p>
<p>morphing space time in that same way,</p>
<p>maybe whatever the physics of consciousness might be,</p>
<p>it might be morphing, that&rsquo;s like what free will is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s morphing like the space,</p>
<p>just like ideas make rockets come to life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow changing the space of possible realizations</p>
<p>of like whatever&rsquo;s, yeah, okay, but that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Life is kind of basically, if you wanna think about it,</p>
<p>like life is sort of changing the probability distributions</p>
<p>over what can exist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the physics of what life is.</p>
<p>And then consciousness is this sort of layered property</p>
<p>or imagination on top of it</p>
<p>that kind of scrambles that a little bit more</p>
<p>and like has access to, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, we don&rsquo;t know how to describe it, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s interesting, but.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s probabilistic.</p>
<p>So you do think like God plays dice.</p>
<p>So let me.</p>
<p>No, I think the description is probabilistic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily think</p>
<p>the underlying physics is probabilistic.</p>
<p>I think the way that we can describe this physics</p>
<p>is going to be probabilistic and statistical,</p>
<p>but the under, like when we take measurements in the lab,</p>
<p>but the underlying physics itself</p>
<p>might still be deterministic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m, it&rsquo;s hard to know what concepts to hold on to.</p>
<p>So I find myself constantly rejecting concepts,</p>
<p>but then I have to grab another one</p>
<p>and try to hold onto something from intellectual history.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s possible that our mind</p>
<p>is not able to hold the correct concepts in mind at all.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re not able to even conceive of them correctly.</p>
<p>Maybe the word&rsquo;s deterministic or random</p>
<p>or not the right even words, concepts to be holding.</p>
<p>But maybe you can talk to the theory of everything,</p>
<p>this attempt in the current set of physical laws</p>
<p>to try to unify them.</p>
<p>Is there any hope that once a theory of everything</p>
<p>is developed, and by theory of everything,</p>
<p>I mean in a narrow sense of unifying quantum field theory</p>
<p>and general relativity,</p>
<p>do you think that will contain some,</p>
<p>like in order to do that unification,</p>
<p>you would have to get something</p>
<p>that would then give hints about the physics of life,</p>
<p>physics of existence, physics of consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, I used to not, but I actually,</p>
<p>I have become increasingly convinced that it probably will.</p>
<p>And part of the reason is,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve talked a little bit already</p>
<p>about these holes in physics,</p>
<p>like the theories we have in physics,</p>
<p>they have problems, they have lots of problems</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very deep problems</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know how to patch them.</p>
<p>And some of those problems become very evident</p>
<p>when you try to patch quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and general relativity together.</p>
<p>So there is this kind of interesting feature</p>
<p>that some of the ways of patching that</p>
<p>might actually closely resemble the physics of life.</p>
<p>And so the place where that actually comes up most,</p>
<p>and actually we just had a workshop</p>
<p>in the Beyond Center where I work</p>
<p>at Arizona State University,</p>
<p>and Lee Smolin made this point that he thinks</p>
<p>that the theory of quantum gravity when we solve it</p>
<p>is gonna be the same theory that gives rise to life.</p>
<p>And I think that I agree with him on some levels</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something very interesting where,</p>
<p>if you look at these sort of causal set theories of gravity</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re looking for space as being emergent.</p>
<p>And so space time is an emergent concept from a causal set,</p>
<p>which is also sort of related, I think,</p>
<p>to what Wolfram&rsquo;s doing with his physics project.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same kind of underlying math</p>
<p>that we have in this theory that we&rsquo;ve been developing</p>
<p>related to life called assembly theory,</p>
<p>which is basically trying to look at complex objects</p>
<p>like molecules and bacteria and living things</p>
<p>as basically being assembled from a set of component parts</p>
<p>and that they actually encode all the possible histories</p>
<p>that they could have in that physical object.</p>
<p>So mathematically, all these ideas I think are related.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are thinking about this</p>
<p>from different perspectives.</p>
<p>And then constructor theory that David Deutsch</p>
<p>and Chiara Marletto have been developing</p>
<p>is a totally different angle on it,</p>
<p>but I think getting at some similar ideas.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really interesting time right now, I think,</p>
<p>for the frontiers of physics and how it&rsquo;s relating</p>
<p>to maybe deeper principles about what life is.</p>
<p>So short answer, yes.</p>
<p>Long winded answer, rewind.</p>
<p>Can we talk about aliens?</p>
<p>Anytime.</p>
<p>So one, I think one interesting way to sneak up</p>
<p>on the question of what is life is to ask</p>
<p>what should we look for in alien life?</p>
<p>If we were to look out into our galaxy and into the universe</p>
<p>and come up with a framework of how to detect alien life,</p>
<p>what should we be looking for?</p>
<p>Is there like set of rules, like it&rsquo;s both the tools</p>
<p>and the tools that are service sensors</p>
<p>for certain kind of properties of life.</p>
<p>So what should we look for in alien life?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we have a paper actually coming out on Monday,</p>
<p>which is collaboration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really Lee Cronin&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>but my group worked with him on it</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re working on the theory,</p>
<p>which is this idea that we should look for life</p>
<p>as high assembly objects.</p>
<p>What we mean by that is,</p>
<p>which is actually observationally measurable.</p>
<p>And this is one of the reasons that I started working</p>
<p>with Lee on these ideas is because being a theorist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to work in a vacuum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to connect abstract ideas</p>
<p>about the nature of life to anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s experimentally tractable.</p>
<p>But what his lab has been able to do is develop this method</p>
<p>where they look at a molecule</p>
<p>and they break it apart into all its component parts.</p>
<p>And so you say you used to have</p>
<p>some elementary building blocks</p>
<p>and you can build up all the ways of putting those together</p>
<p>to make the original object.</p>
<p>And then you look for the shortest path in that space.</p>
<p>And you say that&rsquo;s sort of the assembly number</p>
<p>associated to that object.</p>
<p>And if that number is higher,</p>
<p>it assumes that a longer causal history</p>
<p>is necessary to produce that object</p>
<p>or more information is necessary to specify</p>
<p>the creation of that object in the universe.</p>
<p>Now, that kind of idea at a superficial level</p>
<p>has existed for a long time.</p>
<p>That kind of idea as a physical observable of molecules</p>
<p>is completely novel.</p>
<p>And what his lab has been able to show</p>
<p>is that if you look at a bunch of samples</p>
<p>of nonbiological things and biological things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this kind of threshold of assembly</p>
<p>where as far as the experimental evidence is</p>
<p>and also your intuitive intuition would suggest</p>
<p>that nonbiological systems don&rsquo;t produce things</p>
<p>with high assembly number.</p>
<p>So this goes back to the idea</p>
<p>like a protein is not gonna spontaneously fluctuate</p>
<p>into existence on the surface of Mars.</p>
<p>It requires an evolutionary process</p>
<p>and a biological architecture to produce a protein.</p>
<p>You generalize that argument,</p>
<p>a complex molecule or a cup or a desk ornament</p>
<p>in this sort of abstract idea of assembly spaces</p>
<p>as being the causal history of objects.</p>
<p>And you can talk about the shortest path</p>
<p>from elementary objects to an object</p>
<p>given an elementary set of operations.</p>
<p>And you can experimentally measure that with mass spec.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically the sort of the idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get out of my head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d start imagining Legos</p>
<p>and all the Legos I&rsquo;ve ever built and how many steps,</p>
<p>what is the shortest path to the final little Lego castles?</p>
<p>So then like asking about going to look for alien life,</p>
<p>the idea is most of the instruments that NASA builds,</p>
<p>for example, or any of the space agencies</p>
<p>looking for life in the universe</p>
<p>are looking for chemical correlates of life, right?</p>
<p>But here we have something</p>
<p>that is based on properties of molecules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a chemical correlate, it&rsquo;s agnostic.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t care about the molecule.</p>
<p>It cares about what is the history</p>
<p>necessary to produce this molecule?</p>
<p>How complex is it in terms of how much time is needing,</p>
<p>how much information is required to produce it?</p>
<p>So when you observe a thing on another planet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially,</p>
<p>the process looks like a reverse engineering,</p>
<p>trying to figure out what is the shortest path</p>
<p>to create that thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so most, yeah, and I would say most,</p>
<p>like most examples of biology or technology</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take the shortest path, right?</p>
<p>But the shortest path is a bound on how hard it is</p>
<p>for the universe to make that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I guess what you and Lee are saying</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a heuristic,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good metric for like better perhaps</p>
<p>than chemical correlates.</p>
<p>Yes, because it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not contingent</p>
<p>on looking for the chemistry of life on earth,</p>
<p>on other planets.</p>
<p>And it also has a deeper explanatory framework</p>
<p>associated to it,</p>
<p>as far as the kind of theory that we&rsquo;re trying to develop</p>
<p>associated to what life is.</p>
<p>And I think this is one of the problems I have</p>
<p>in my field personally in astrobiology</p>
<p>is people observe something on earth,</p>
<p>say oxygen in the atmosphere or an amino acid in a cell,</p>
<p>and then they say, let&rsquo;s go look for that on another planet.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look for oxygen on exoplanets</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s look for amino acids on Mars.</p>
<p>And then they assume that&rsquo;s a way of looking for life</p>
<p>or even phosphine on Venus.</p>
<p>But you know, like there&rsquo;s all these examples</p>
<p>of let&rsquo;s look for one molecule.</p>
<p>A molecule is not life.</p>
<p>Life is a system that patterns particular structures</p>
<p>into matter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t care what molecules are there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something about the patterns and that structure</p>
<p>and that history.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking for a molecule,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not testing any hypotheses</p>
<p>about the nature of what life is.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t tell me anything.</p>
<p>If we discover oxygen on an exoplanet</p>
<p>about what kind of life is there,</p>
<p>just oxygen on an exoplanet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s, I guess I think like,</p>
<p>when you think about the question,</p>
<p>are we alone in the universe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty fricking deep question.</p>
<p>It should have a fricking deep answer.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t just be, there&rsquo;s a molecule on an exoplanet.</p>
<p>Wow, we solved the problem.</p>
<p>It should tell us something meaningful about our existence.</p>
<p>And I feel like we&rsquo;ve fallen short</p>
<p>on how we&rsquo;re searching for life</p>
<p>in terms of actually searching for things like us</p>
<p>in this kind of deeper way.</p>
<p>But how do you do that initial kind of,</p>
<p>say I&rsquo;m walking down the street</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m looking for that double take test of like,</p>
<p>like what the hell is that?</p>
<p>Like that initial, like how do we look for</p>
<p>the possibility of weirdness</p>
<p>or the possibility of high assembly number?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Like what would aliens look like</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t have two eyes and are green?</p>
<p>If I knew, I wouldn&rsquo;t probably already solve the problem.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s another Nobel Prize in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, somewhere in there.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>so there is a bias here, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve evolved to recognize life on earth, right?</p>
<p>Like I, you know, children at a very early age</p>
<p>can tell the difference between a puppy and a plant</p>
<p>and then the plant and a chair, for example.</p>
<p>You know, like it just, it seems innate.</p>
<p>And so I think, and also because we&rsquo;re life,</p>
<p>you know, I think like there&rsquo;s this implicit bias</p>
<p>that we should know it when we see it</p>
<p>and it should be completely obvious to us.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of features of our universe</p>
<p>that are not completely obvious to us.</p>
<p>Like the fact that this table is made of atoms</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;m sitting</p>
<p>in a gravitational potential well right now.</p>
<p>And I guess my point with this is,</p>
<p>I think life is much less obvious than we think it is.</p>
<p>And so it could be in many more forms</p>
<p>than we think it is.</p>
<p>And I guess this goes back to the point</p>
<p>about being open minded</p>
<p>that we may not know what alien life looks like.</p>
<p>It might not even be possible to interact with alien life</p>
<p>because maybe something about, you know,</p>
<p>our informational lineage, it makes it impossible</p>
<p>for information from an alien to be copied to us.</p>
<p>Therefore there&rsquo;s no, you know,</p>
<p>so to speak communication channel.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean, you know, verbal communication,</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s not in our observational space.</p>
<p>Like, you know, there&rsquo;s fundamental questions</p>
<p>about why we observe the universe in position</p>
<p>rather than momentum, but we also, you know,</p>
<p>observe it in terms of certain informational patterns</p>
<p>and things like that&rsquo;s what our brain constructs</p>
<p>and maybe aliens just interact</p>
<p>with a different part of reality than we do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wildly speculative, but I think, I think.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible and I think it&rsquo;s consistent with the physics.</p>
<p>So I think the best ways we can ask questions</p>
<p>are about life and chemistry</p>
<p>and asking questions about</p>
<p>if information is a real physical thing,</p>
<p>what would its signatures be in matter</p>
<p>and how do we recognize those?</p>
<p>And I think the ones that are most obvious</p>
<p>are the ones I&rsquo;ve already articulated.</p>
<p>You have these objects that seem completely improbable</p>
<p>for the universe to produce</p>
<p>because the universe doesn&rsquo;t have the design</p>
<p>of that object in the laws.</p>
<p>So therefore an object had to evolve.</p>
<p>We talk, we call it evolution,</p>
<p>but it had to be produced by the universe</p>
<p>that then had all of the possible tasks</p>
<p>to make that object specified.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s an engineering question here of,</p>
<p>are there sensors we can create that can give us,</p>
<p>can help us discover certain pockets</p>
<p>of high assemblies aliens?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, there is a hope</p>
<p>setting dogs and chairs aside,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hope that visually we could detect,</p>
<p>like, because our universe,</p>
<p>I mean, at least the way we look at it now,</p>
<p>like this three dimensional like space time,</p>
<p>we can visually comprehend it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think like,</p>
<p>if we got to hang out,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s an alien in this room,</p>
<p>like would we be able to detect it with our current sensors?</p>
<p>Not the fancy kinds, but like web cam.</p>
<p>Like say standing over there.</p>
<p>Yeah, standing over there</p>
<p>or maybe like in this carpet,</p>
<p>see there&rsquo;s all these kinds of patterns, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this carpet is an alien.</p>
<p>Well, so I see what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So assembly theory is pretty general.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, we&rsquo;ve been applying it to molecules</p>
<p>because it makes sense to apply it to molecules,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s supposed to explain life,</p>
<p>like the physics of life.</p>
<p>So it should explain the things in this room</p>
<p>in addition to molecules.</p>
<p>So I guess, and you can apply it to images and things.</p>
<p>So I guess the idea you could explore</p>
<p>is just looking at everything on planet earth</p>
<p>in terms of its assembly structure</p>
<p>and then looking for things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t part of our biological lineage.</p>
<p>If they have high assembly, they might be aliens on earth.</p>
<p>I mean, that is a very kind of rigorous</p>
<p>computer vision question.</p>
<p>Can we visually, is there a strong correlation</p>
<p>between certain kind of high assembly objects</p>
<p>when they get to the scale</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re visually observable</p>
<p>and some, like when it&rsquo;s say projected onto a 2D plane,</p>
<p>can we figure out something?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you brought up the computer vision point</p>
<p>because for a while I had this kind of thought in my mind</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t even see ourselves clearly.</p>
<p>So one of the things,</p>
<p>people are worried about artificial intelligence</p>
<p>for a lot of reasons,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s really fascinating</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like the first time in history</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re building a system</p>
<p>that can help us understand ourselves.</p>
<p>So like, people talk about AI physics,</p>
<p>but like, when I look at another person,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see them as a 4 billion year lineage,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what they are.</p>
<p>And so is everything here, right?</p>
<p>So imagine that we built artificial systems</p>
<p>that could actually see that feature of us,</p>
<p>what else would they see?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>And I think that would be so cool.</p>
<p>I want that to happen,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re a little ways off from it, but yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going there, I hope.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask you, I apologize ahead of time,</p>
<p>but let me ask you the internet question.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a physicist,</p>
<p>you ask rigorous questions about the physics of existence</p>
<p>and these models of high assembly objects.</p>
<p>Now, when the internet would see an alien,</p>
<p>they would ask two questions.</p>
<p>One, can I eat it?</p>
<p>And two, can I have sex with it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, the internet is.</p>
<p>All the existential questions,</p>
<p>those are very important ones.</p>
<p>The internet is very sophisticated.</p>
<p>It really is, it&rsquo;s gotten our basal cognition pretty good.</p>
<p>So you kind of mentioned that it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that we may not be</p>
<p>even able to communicate with it.</p>
<p>Right, I think the internet has more hope than we do.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a hopeful place, yes.</p>
<p>Do you think in terms of interacting</p>
<p>on this very primal level of sharing resources,</p>
<p>like what would aliens eat?</p>
<p>What would we eat?</p>
<p>Would we eat the same thing?</p>
<p>Could we potentially eat each other?</p>
<p>One person eats the other, or the aliens eat us.</p>
<p>And the same thing with not sex in general,</p>
<p>or reproduction, but genetically mixing stuff.</p>
<p>Like, would we be able to mix genetic information?</p>
<p>Maybe not genetic, but maybe information, right?</p>
<p>And I think part of your question is like,</p>
<p>so if you think of life as like this history</p>
<p>of events that happen in the universe,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s this question of like,</p>
<p>how divergent are those histories, right?</p>
<p>So when we get to the scale of technology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to imagine,</p>
<p>although we can&rsquo;t even do it.</p>
<p>Like imagine all the possible technologies</p>
<p>that could exist in the universe.</p>
<p>But if you think about all the possible chemistries,</p>
<p>somehow that seems like a lower dimensional space</p>
<p>and a lower set of possibilities.</p>
<p>So it might be that like when we interact with aliens,</p>
<p>we do have to go back to those more basal levels</p>
<p>to figure out sort of what the map is, right?</p>
<p>Like the sort of where we have a common history.</p>
<p>We must have a common history somewhere in the universe,</p>
<p>but in order to be able to actually interact</p>
<p>in a meaningful way, you have to have some shared history.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason we can exchange genetic information</p>
<p>in each other&rsquo;s food or eat each other as food</p>
<p>is because we have a shared history.</p>
<p>So we have to find that shared history.</p>
<p>We have to find the common ancestor</p>
<p>in this causality map, the causality tree.</p>
<p>Yes, and we have a last universal common ancestor</p>
<p>for all life on earth, which I think is sort of the nexus</p>
<p>of that causality map for life on earth.</p>
<p>But the question is where would other aliens</p>
<p>diverge on that map?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And I mean, so say there&rsquo;s a lot of aliens out there</p>
<p>in the universe, each set of organisms</p>
<p>will probably have like a number, you know,</p>
<p>like Erdos number of like how far,</p>
<p>like how far our common ancestor is.</p>
<p>And so the closer the common ancestor, like it is on earth,</p>
<p>the more likely we are to be able</p>
<p>to have sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like sort of like humans having common culture</p>
<p>and languages, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, it might take a lot of work though with an alien</p>
<p>cause you really have to get over a language barrier.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s communication, it&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all the whole,</p>
<p>and I think tied into that is the questions</p>
<p>of like who&rsquo;s going to harm who.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And actually definitions of harm.</p>
<p>And whether your parents approve,</p>
<p>you know, all those kind of questions.</p>
<p>Whether the common ancestor approves.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s just very true.</p>
<p>How many alien civilizations do you think are out there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have intuition for that,</p>
<p>which I have always thought was deeply intriguing.</p>
<p>So, and part of this, I mean, I say it specifically</p>
<p>as I don&rsquo;t have intuition for that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like one of those questions</p>
<p>that you feel around for a while</p>
<p>and you really just, you can&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>even though it might be right there.</p>
<p>And in that sense, it&rsquo;s a little like</p>
<p>the quantum to classical can transition.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like really talking about</p>
<p>two different kinds of physics.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s kind of part of the problem.</p>
<p>Once we understand the physics,</p>
<p>that question might become more meaningful.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also this other issue,</p>
<p>and this was really instilled on me</p>
<p>by my mentor, Paul Davies, when I was a postdoc,</p>
<p>because he always talks about how, you know,</p>
<p>whether aliens are common or rare is kind of just,</p>
<p>you know, it like, you know, it follows a wave of popularity</p>
<p>and it just depends on like the mood of, you know,</p>
<p>what the culture is at the time.</p>
<p>And I always thought that was kind of</p>
<p>an intriguing observation, but also there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>you know, set of points about</p>
<p>if you go by the observational evidence,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re supposed to do as scientists, right?</p>
<p>You know, we have evidence of us</p>
<p>and one origin of life event from which we emerged.</p>
<p>And people wanna make arguments</p>
<p>that because that event was rapid</p>
<p>or because there&rsquo;s other planets</p>
<p>that have properties similar to ours,</p>
<p>that that event should be common.</p>
<p>But you actually can&rsquo;t reason on that</p>
<p>because our existence observing that event</p>
<p>is contingent on that event happening,</p>
<p>which means it could have been completely improbable</p>
<p>or very common.</p>
<p>And Brandon Carter, like clearly articulated that</p>
<p>in terms of anthropic arguments a few decades ago.</p>
<p>So there is this kind of issue</p>
<p>that we have to contend with dealing with life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s closer to home than we have to deal with</p>
<p>with any other problems in physics,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re talking about the physics of ourselves.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re asking about the origin of life event,</p>
<p>that event happening in the universe,</p>
<p>at least as like our existence is contingent on it.</p>
<p>And so you can think about sort of fine tuning arguments</p>
<p>that way too.</p>
<p>So, but the sort of otter part of it is like,</p>
<p>when I think about how likely it is,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t understand this mechanism yet</p>
<p>about how information can be generated spontaneously</p>
<p>that I like, cause I can&rsquo;t see that physics clearly yet,</p>
<p>even though I have a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>like some things around the space of it in my mind,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t articulate how likely that process is.</p>
<p>So my honest answer is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And sometimes that feels like a cop out,</p>
<p>but I feel like that&rsquo;s a more honest answer</p>
<p>and a more meaningful way of making progress</p>
<p>than what a lot of people wanna do, which is say,</p>
<p>oh, well, we have a one in 10 chance of having</p>
<p>on an exoplanet with Earth like properties</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s lots of Earth like planets out there</p>
<p>and life happened fast on Earth.</p>
<p>Well, so I have kind of a follow up question,</p>
<p>but as a side comment, what I really am enjoying</p>
<p>about the way you&rsquo;re talking about human beings</p>
<p>is you always say, and not to make yourself conscious</p>
<p>about it, cause I really, really enjoy it.</p>
<p>You say we, you don&rsquo;t say humans.</p>
<p>You say, cause oftentimes like, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, evolutionary biologists</p>
<p>will kind of put yourself out as an observer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to think that you as a human</p>
<p>are struggling about your own origins.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>And yeah, and I think, I don&rsquo;t do that deliberately,</p>
<p>but I do think that way.</p>
<p>And this is sort of the inversion</p>
<p>from the logic of physics because physics</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s always been constructed has treated us</p>
<p>as external observers of the universe.</p>
<p>And we are not part of the universe.</p>
<p>And this is why the problem of life,</p>
<p>I think demands completely new thinking</p>
<p>because we have to think about ourselves</p>
<p>as minds that exist in the universe</p>
<p>and are at this particular moment in history</p>
<p>and looking out at the things around us</p>
<p>and trying to understand what we are inside the system,</p>
<p>not outside the system.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have descriptions at a fundamental level</p>
<p>that describe us as inside the system.</p>
<p>And this was my problem with cellular automata also.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always an external observer for a cellular automata.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not in the system.</p>
<p>What does the cellular automata look like from the inside?</p>
<p>I think you just broke my brain with that question.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the fundamental.</p>
<p>I thought about that for a long time, but.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna, yeah, that&rsquo;s a really clean formulation</p>
<p>of a very fundamental question,</p>
<p>because you can only, to understand cellular automata,</p>
<p>you have to be inside of it.</p>
<p>But as a human, sort of a poetic, romantic question,</p>
<p>does it make you sad?</p>
<p>Does it make you hopeful whether we&rsquo;re alone or not?</p>
<p>Like in the different possible versions of that,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re the highest assembly object in the entire universe,</p>
<p>does that give you?</p>
<p>At this moment in time, maybe.</p>
<p>At this moment in the causal.</p>
<p>Cause we may, I assume we have a future.</p>
<p>Well, we definitely have a future.</p>
<p>The question is where that future decreases the assembly.</p>
<p>Like it could be where at the peak, or we could be just.</p>
<p>That would be inconsistent with the physics in my mind.</p>
<p>But so I should give a caveat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given the caveat that I&rsquo;m biased as a physicist,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also biased as an eternal optimist.</p>
<p>So pretty much all of my modes of operation</p>
<p>for building theories about the world</p>
<p>are not like an Occam&rsquo;s razor,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the simplest explanation,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the most optimistic explanation.</p>
<p>And part of the reason for that</p>
<p>is if you really think explanations have causal power,</p>
<p>in the sense that our,</p>
<p>like the fact that we have theories about the world</p>
<p>has enabled technologies</p>
<p>and physically transform the world around us.</p>
<p>I think I have to take seriously that</p>
<p>as a part of the physics I wanna describe</p>
<p>and try to build theories of reality</p>
<p>that are optimistic about what&rsquo;s coming next</p>
<p>because the theories are in part</p>
<p>the causes of what comes next.</p>
<p>So there could be a physics of hope</p>
<p>or physics of optimism in there too.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is that seems like also,</p>
<p>I mean, optimism does seem to be a kind of engine</p>
<p>that results in innovation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So this is like,</p>
<p>why the hell are we trying to come up with new stuff?</p>
<p>Oh, so I made this point about thinking life</p>
<p>is the physics of existence.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just the physics of existence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the physics of more things existing.</p>
<p>So I think one of these drives of like.</p>
<p>Creativity.</p>
<p>Yeah, creativity, like optimism.</p>
<p>So if you like, people like entropy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like entropy as it was formulated in the 1800s.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an antiquated concept,</p>
<p>but this idea of maximizing</p>
<p>over the possible number of states that could exist.</p>
<p>Imagine the universe is actually trying to maximize</p>
<p>over the number of things that could physically exist.</p>
<p>What would be the best way to do that?</p>
<p>The best way to do that</p>
<p>would be evolve intelligent technological things</p>
<p>that could explore that space.</p>
<p>So, okay, that&rsquo;s talking about alien life</p>
<p>out there in the universe,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve also earlier in the conversation mentioned</p>
<p>the shadow biosphere.</p>
<p>So is it possible that we have weird life here on earth</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just not,</p>
<p>like even in a high assembly formulation of life,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just not paying attention to?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re blind to.</p>
<p>Like life we&rsquo;re potentially able to detect,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re blind to.</p>
<p>And maybe you could say, what is the shadow biosphere?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, the shadow biosphere is this idea</p>
<p>that there might&rsquo;ve been other original life events</p>
<p>that happened on earth that were independent</p>
<p>from the original life event that led to us</p>
<p>and all of the life that we know on earth.</p>
<p>And therefore there could be aliens</p>
<p>in the sense they have a different origin event.</p>
<p>Living among us.</p>
<p>And it was proposed by a number of people,</p>
<p>but one of them was Paul Davies</p>
<p>that I mentioned earlier is my mentor.</p>
<p>And he has a really cute way of saying</p>
<p>that aliens could be right under our noses</p>
<p>or even in our noses.</p>
<p>With a British accent, it sounds better.</p>
<p>But anyway, so the idea is like,</p>
<p>it could literally be anywhere around us.</p>
<p>And if you think actually about the discovery</p>
<p>of like viruses and bacteria,</p>
<p>for a long time they were kind of a shadow biosphere.</p>
<p>It was life that was around us, but invisible.</p>
<p>But this takes it a little bit further</p>
<p>and saying that all of those examples,</p>
<p>viruses, bacteria and everything that we&rsquo;ve discovered so far</p>
<p>has this common ancestry</p>
<p>and the last universal common ancestor of life on earth.</p>
<p>So maybe there was a different origin event</p>
<p>and that life is weirder still and might be among us</p>
<p>and we could find it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to go out and the stars look for aliens</p>
<p>just here on earth.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a serious possibility</p>
<p>that we should explore with the tools of science?</p>
<p>Like this should be a serious effort.</p>
<p>I think yes and no.</p>
<p>And I mean, yes, because I think it&rsquo;s a serious hypothesis</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s worth exploring.</p>
<p>And it is certainly more economical</p>
<p>to look for signs of alien life on earth</p>
<p>than it is to go and build spacecraft</p>
<p>and send robots to other planets.</p>
<p>And that was one of the reasons it was proposed is,</p>
<p>well, if we do find an example of another original life</p>
<p>on earth, it&rsquo;s hugely informative</p>
<p>because it means the origin of life is not a rare event.</p>
<p>If it happened twice on the same planet,</p>
<p>that means it&rsquo;s probably pretty probable</p>
<p>given conditions are right.</p>
<p>So it has huge potential scientific impact,</p>
<p>not to mention the fact that you might have like biochemistry</p>
<p>and stuff that&rsquo;s informative for like medicine</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But I think the thing for me that&rsquo;s challenging about it</p>
<p>and this really comes from my own work,</p>
<p>like thinking about life as a planetary scale process</p>
<p>and also trying to understand</p>
<p>sometimes what I call like the statistical mechanics</p>
<p>of biochemistry, but large scale statistical patterns</p>
<p>in the chemistry that life uses on earth.</p>
<p>There are a lot of regularities there</p>
<p>and life does seem to have planetary scale organization</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s consistent even with some of the patterns</p>
<p>that we see at the individual scale.</p>
<p>So if you think life is a planetary scale phenomenon</p>
<p>and the chemistry of life has to be sort of not just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, an individual is not necessarily</p>
<p>the fundamental unit of life, right?</p>
<p>The fundamental unit of life</p>
<p>is these informational lineages and they&rsquo;re kind of,</p>
<p>they intersect over spatial scales.</p>
<p>So everything on earth is kind of related</p>
<p>by the common causal history.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard for me based on the way I think</p>
<p>about the physics and also some of the stuff</p>
<p>that my group has done to really think</p>
<p>that there could be evidence</p>
<p>or there could be a second sample of life on earth.</p>
<p>But I think there are ways</p>
<p>that we need to be more concrete about that.</p>
<p>And I have thought a little bit about like,</p>
<p>like you can represent the chemistry</p>
<p>in an individual cell as a network.</p>
<p>And then those networks, something my group has shown</p>
<p>actually scale with the same property.</p>
<p>So ecosystems have the same properties</p>
<p>as individuals as planetary scale.</p>
<p>And then you could imagine</p>
<p>if you had alien chemistry intermixed in there,</p>
<p>that scaling would be broken.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s some robustness property</p>
<p>or something associated to it,</p>
<p>and you get alien chemistry in there,</p>
<p>it just breaks everything.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have a planetary ecosystem functioning</p>
<p>and individuals functioning across all these scales.</p>
<p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m arguing</p>
<p>is life is not a scale dependent phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just cellular life.</p>
<p>So if you have a shadow biosphere,</p>
<p>it has to be integrated with all of these other scales.</p>
<p>And that would lose the meaning</p>
<p>of the word shadow biosphere, I guess.</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an open question, right?</p>
<p>And I think it would tell us a lot.</p>
<p>So there has been very minimal effort</p>
<p>of people to look for a shadow biosphere.</p>
<p>But then the question,</p>
<p>it could be possible that there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sufficiently distinct planets within one planet,</p>
<p>meaning like environments within one planet.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking recently</p>
<p>because of having a chat with Catherine Duclair</p>
<p>about Io, the moon of Jupiter,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like all volcanoes and volcanoes are bad ass.</p>
<p>But like, imagining life inside volcanoes, right?</p>
<p>It seems like sufficiently chemically different</p>
<p>like to be living in the darkness</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of heat</p>
<p>and maybe you could have different Earths on a planet.</p>
<p>Or like if you go deep enough in the crust,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s like a layer where there&rsquo;s no life.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s suddenly life again.</p>
<p>And maybe those, you know, lizard men</p>
<p>or whatever they are that people dream about</p>
<p>are really down there.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s a little flippant,</p>
<p>but really like there could be like chemical cycles</p>
<p>deep in the Earth&rsquo;s crust that might be alive</p>
<p>and are completely distinct</p>
<p>in chemical origin to surface life.</p>
<p>Right, that they wouldn&rsquo;t be interacting with each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s one of the proposals</p>
<p>for the shadow biosphere is like,</p>
<p>sometimes people talk about it as being geologically</p>
<p>or geographically distinct that it might be,</p>
<p>you know, you have no life for this region</p>
<p>and then a different example.</p>
<p>And then sometimes people talk about it</p>
<p>being chemically distinct,</p>
<p>that the chemistry is sufficiently different,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s completely orthogonal</p>
<p>or non interacting with our chemistry.</p>
<p>It seems to me at least the chemistry</p>
<p>is a more powerful boundary than geographic.</p>
<p>It just seems like life finds a way literally to travel.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>What do you think about all these UFO sightings?</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s really inspiring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yet another localized way to dream</p>
<p>about the mysterious that is out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ve actually been more intrigued</p>
<p>by the cultural phenomena UFOs</p>
<p>than the phenomena UFOs themselves,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s intriguing about how</p>
<p>we are preparing ourselves mentally</p>
<p>for understanding others</p>
<p>and how we have thought about that historically</p>
<p>and what the sort of modern incarnations of that are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like, I want an explanation for us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my motivation.</p>
<p>And having some, you know,</p>
<p>streaks across the sky or something</p>
<p>and saying that&rsquo;s aliens,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t tell you anything.</p>
<p>So unless you have a deeper explanation</p>
<p>and you have, you know, more lines of,</p>
<p>you know, where is this gonna take us in the future?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not as interesting to me</p>
<p>as the problem of understanding life itself</p>
<p>and aliens as a more general phenomenon.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s, just as you said,</p>
<p>a good way to psychologically and sociologically</p>
<p>prepare ourselves to sort of like,</p>
<p>what would that look like?</p>
<p>And very importantly,</p>
<p>which is what a lot of people talk about politically,</p>
<p>sort of there&rsquo;s this idea from the,</p>
<p>so I came from the Soviet Union of like the Cold War</p>
<p>and we have to hide secrets.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some way in us searching for life on other planets</p>
<p>or our searching for life in general,</p>
<p>the way we&rsquo;ve done government in the past,</p>
<p>we tend to think of all new things</p>
<p>as potential military secrets,</p>
<p>so we want to hide them.</p>
<p>And one of the ways that people kind of look</p>
<p>at UFO sightings is like,</p>
<p>like maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t hide this stuff.</p>
<p>Like what is the government hiding?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really, you know,</p>
<p>in one sense it&rsquo;s a conspiratorial question,</p>
<p>but I think in another,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an inspiration to change the way we do government</p>
<p>to where secrets don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>maybe there are times when you want to keep secrets</p>
<p>as military secrets,</p>
<p>but maybe we need to release a lot more stuff</p>
<p>and see us as a human species as together</p>
<p>in this whole search.</p>
<p>Yeah, the public engagement part there</p>
<p>is really interesting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like a challenge</p>
<p>to the way we&rsquo;ve done stuff in the past</p>
<p>in terms of keeping secrets when they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>so like the first step,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know how something works,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a mysterious thing,</p>
<p>the first instinct should not be like, let&rsquo;s hide it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it in the closet.</p>
<p>So that the Chinese or the Russian government</p>
<p>or whatever government doesn&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<p>Maybe the first instinct should be, let&rsquo;s understand it.</p>
<p>Perhaps let&rsquo;s understand it together.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, I think that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And something I realized recently</p>
<p>that I never thought was gonna be a problem,</p>
<p>but I think this actually helps with quite a bit</p>
<p>is because so many people nowadays</p>
<p>believe we&rsquo;ve already made contact,</p>
<p>that as an astrobiologist,</p>
<p>if we actually want to understand life and make contact,</p>
<p>we kind of have to deconstruct the narratives</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve already built from ourselves</p>
<p>and kind of unteach ourselves</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve learned about aliens and then reteach ourselves.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this really interesting sort of dialogue there</p>
<p>and making it open to the public</p>
<p>that they actually have to think critically about it</p>
<p>and they see the evidence for themselves,</p>
<p>I think is really important for that process.</p>
<p>Yeah, that aliens might be way weirder than we can imagine.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;re probably weirder</p>
<p>than we can imagine.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve in 2020 and still living through a pandemic,</p>
<p>setting the political and all those kinds of things aside,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found viruses fascinating</p>
<p>as dynamical systems, I was gonna say living systems,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always kind of thought of them as living,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a whole nother kind of discussion.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;d be great to put that on the table.</p>
<p>One, do you find viruses beautiful slash terrifying?</p>
<p>And two, do you think they&rsquo;re living things</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s some aspect to them per our discussion of life</p>
<p>that makes them living?</p>
<p>I mean, living in a pandemic saying viruses are beautiful</p>
<p>is probably a hard thing,</p>
<p>but I do find them beautiful to a degree.</p>
<p>I think even in the sense of mediating a global pandemic,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something like deeply intriguing there</p>
<p>because these are tiny, tiny little things, right?</p>
<p>And yet they can essentially cause a seizure</p>
<p>or handicap an entire civilization at a global scale.</p>
<p>So just that intersection between</p>
<p>our perceived invincibility and our susceptibility to things</p>
<p>and also the interaction across scales of those things</p>
<p>is just a really amazing feature of our world.</p>
<p>Most technology, whether it&rsquo;s viruses or AI</p>
<p>that can scale in an exponential way,</p>
<p>like kind of run as opposed to like,</p>
<p>one thing makes another thing makes another thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing makes two things</p>
<p>and those two things make four things.</p>
<p>Like that kind of process</p>
<p>also seems to be fundamental to life.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s terrifying because in a matter of,</p>
<p>in a very short time scale, it can,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s good at being life, whatever that is,</p>
<p>it can quickly overtake the other competing forms of life.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s scary both for AI and for viruses.</p>
<p>And it seems like understanding these processes</p>
<p>that are underlying viruses.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean like on the virology or biology side,</p>
<p>but on some kind of more computational physics perspective</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>seems to be really important to figure out</p>
<p>how humans can survive.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Along with this kind of life</p>
<p>and perhaps becoming a multi planetary species</p>
<p>is a part of that.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no, maybe like we&rsquo;ll figure out</p>
<p>from a physics perspective is like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way any living system</p>
<p>can be stable for prolonged period of time</p>
<p>and survive unless it expands exponentially throughout.</p>
<p>Like we have to multiply.</p>
<p>Otherwise anything that doesn&rsquo;t multiply exponentially</p>
<p>will die eventually.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a fundamental law.</p>
<p>Maybe, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I always get really bothered by these Darwinian narratives</p>
<p>that are like the fittest replicator wins and things.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, I just don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I think like the copying of information</p>
<p>is sort of ancillary to this other process of creativity.</p>
<p>Right, so like the drive is actually,</p>
<p>the drive is creativity,</p>
<p>but if you wanna keep the creativity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s existed in the past,</p>
<p>it has to be copied into the future.</p>
<p>So replication, like if you, so that for me is,</p>
<p>so I had this set of arguments with Michael Lockman</p>
<p>and Lee Cronin about the like life being about persistence.</p>
<p>They thought it was about persistence</p>
<p>and like survival of the fittest kind of thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, it&rsquo;s about existence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, cause when you&rsquo;re talking about that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to say that in retrospect,</p>
<p>you can post select on the things that survived</p>
<p>and then say why they survived,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t do that going forward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really profound</p>
<p>that survival is just a nice little side effect feature</p>
<p>of maximizing creativity, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like that. That&rsquo;s really beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, like I said, I like optimistic theories.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s optimistic.</p>
<p>That could be terrifying to people because,</p>
<p>because a system that maximizes creativity</p>
<p>may very quickly get rid of humans for some reason,</p>
<p>if it comes up with some other creative,</p>
<p>I mean, forms of existence, right?</p>
<p>This is the AI thing is like the moment you have an AI system</p>
<p>that can flourish in the space of ideas</p>
<p>or in some other space much more effectively than humans.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sufficiently integrated into the physical space</p>
<p>to be able to modify the environment.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll just be like</p>
<p>the core genetic architecture or something.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be like the DNA for AI, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we haven&rsquo;t lost the past informational</p>
<p>architectures on this planet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still there.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the AI will use our brains in some part</p>
<p>to like ride, like accelerate the exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the neural language dream is that,</p>
<p>well, the humans will be still around</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re saying architecture.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>they necessarily need to tap into our brains.</p>
<p>I mean, just collectively, we do interesting things.</p>
<p>What if they were just using like the patterns</p>
<p>in our communication or something?</p>
<p>Oh, without controlling it, just observing?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>In what sense do you control the chemistry</p>
<p>happening in your body?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, like the way I look at, like people look at AI</p>
<p>and then they look at this thing that&rsquo;s bigger than us</p>
<p>and is coming in the future and is smarter than us.</p>
<p>And I think though that looking at the past history</p>
<p>of life on the planet and what information</p>
<p>has been doing for the last 4 billion years</p>
<p>is probably very informative to asking questions</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s coming next.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>one is planetary scale transitions are really important</p>
<p>for new phases.</p>
<p>So the global internet and sort of global integration</p>
<p>of our technology, I think is an important thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s again, life is a planetary scale phenomenon</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re an integrated component of that phenomenon.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really see that the technology</p>
<p>is gonna replace us in that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gonna keep scaffolding and building.</p>
<p>And I also don&rsquo;t have an idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna build AI in a box.</p>
<p>I think AI is gonna emerge.</p>
<p>AGI to me is a planetary scale phenomena</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna emerge from our technology.</p>
<p>Planetary scale phenomena.</p>
<p>But do you think an AGI is not distinct from humans?</p>
<p>The whole package.</p>
<p>The whole package, yeah.</p>
<p>Comes as a planetary scale phenomena.</p>
<p>And that goes back to the fact that like,</p>
<p>you were asking questions about you as an individual.</p>
<p>Like, what are you as an individual?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like a packet of information</p>
<p>that exists in the particular physical thing that is you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all just packets of information.</p>
<p>And some of us are aggregates in certain ways</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all just kind of exchanging</p>
<p>and propagating, right?</p>
<p>And processing.</p>
<p>Is your packet of information</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve continually referred to as Sarah</p>
<p>afraid of the dissipation of the death of that packet?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>Do you ponder death?</p>
<p>Does death have meaning in this process</p>
<p>of creativity?</p>
<p>I think I have the natural biological urge</p>
<p>that everyone has to fear death.</p>
<p>I think the thing that I think is interesting</p>
<p>is if I think about it rationally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily afraid of death for me</p>
<p>because I won&rsquo;t be aware of being dead.</p>
<p>But I am afraid like for my kids</p>
<p>because it matters to them if I die.</p>
<p>So again, like I think death becomes more significant</p>
<p>as a collective property, not as an individual one.</p>
<p>Yeah, but isn&rsquo;t there something to fear</p>
<p>about the fact that the way,</p>
<p>like the creative,</p>
<p>the complexity of information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been like created in you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The fact that it kind of breaks apart and disappears.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, but I don&rsquo;t think it disappears.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not me anymore.</p>
<p>Right, but that process of it being not you anymore,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t scare you?</p>
<p>Of course it does.</p>
<p>The mystery of it.</p>
<p>I mean, the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, but I guess I&rsquo;m heartened by the fact</p>
<p>that there will be some imprints of the fact</p>
<p>that I existed still in the universe after I leave it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;ll be a&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, but&hellip;</p>
<p>And also that has to do with my perception of time, right?</p>
<p>So, I perceive time as flowing,</p>
<p>but that might not be the case.</p>
<p>I mean, this is standard physicist comfort is,</p>
<p>every moment exists and there&rsquo;s no&hellip;</p>
<p>And the flow of time is just our perception of us changing.</p>
<p>So, you can travel back in time and that&rsquo;s comforting?</p>
<p>Like from a physicist&rsquo;s concept?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about traveling back in time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that the moments in the past still exist.</p>
<p>Now, whether the moments in the future exist or not</p>
<p>is a different question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not comforting to me in terms of death.</p>
<p>The flow of time is not&hellip;</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no comfort in the face of death</p>
<p>for what we are because we like existing.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s especially true if you love life</p>
<p>and you love what life is.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a certain sense in which</p>
<p>the fear of death or the fear of nonexistence,</p>
<p>maybe fear is not the right word,</p>
<p>is the actual very phenomena that gives birth to existence?</p>
<p>Like, death is fundamental.</p>
<p>It just feels like freaking out, oh shit,</p>
<p>this ride ends is actually like the&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that gives birth to this whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That like, it&rsquo;s constantly&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s matter constantly freaking out about the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna be the most.</p>
<p>No, I think things like to exist.</p>
<p>I think they wanna exist.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a desire, whatever, to exist.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a drive to exist</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a drive for more things to exist.</p>
<p>I guess, yeah, I like existing.</p>
<p>I like it a lot and I don&rsquo;t know it any other way.</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t even know if I like existing.</p>
<p>I think I really don&rsquo;t like not existing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Some days I might like existing less than others.</p>
<p>Yes, but like, I think those are like surface feelings.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s something fundamental</p>
<p>about wanting to exist.</p>
<p>No, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But I think to your point that that might go back</p>
<p>to the more fundamental idea that, you know,</p>
<p>if life is the physics of existence</p>
<p>and maximizing existence, individual organisms,</p>
<p>of course, wanna maximize their existence</p>
<p>and everything, you know, like wants to exist.</p>
<p>But I guess for me, the small comfort is</p>
<p>my existence matters to future existence.</p>
<p>Speaking of future existence, is there advice</p>
<p>you can give to future pockets of existences,</p>
<p>AKA young people, about life?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had, you&rsquo;ve worn many hats.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve taken on some of the biggest problems</p>
<p>in the universe.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give to young people</p>
<p>about life, about career, about existing?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe not about the last one.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people ask me this question</p>
<p>about like working on such hard problems,</p>
<p>like how can you make a successful career out of that?</p>
<p>But I think for me, it couldn&rsquo;t be otherwise.</p>
<p>Like I have to, to be fulfilled,</p>
<p>you have to work on things you care about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always kind of driven me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been discipline, department,</p>
<p>and sort of superficial level problem independent</p>
<p>because I started at community college actually,</p>
<p>and I was taking a physics class</p>
<p>and I learned about magnetic monopoles</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t know if they existed in the universe,</p>
<p>but we could predict them and we could go look for them.</p>
<p>And I was so deeply intrigued by this idea</p>
<p>that we had this mathematical formula to go look for things.</p>
<p>And then I wanted to become a theoretical physicist</p>
<p>because of that.</p>
<p>But that actually wasn&rsquo;t my driving question.</p>
<p>I realized my driving question is the nature</p>
<p>of the correspondence between our minds</p>
<p>and physical reality and what we are.</p>
<p>And that question is very deep,</p>
<p>so you can work across a lot of fields doing that.</p>
<p>But I think without that driving question,</p>
<p>I never would have been able to do all the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the passion that drives it.</p>
<p>And usually when students ask me these kinds of questions,</p>
<p>I tell them like, you have to find something</p>
<p>you really care about working on</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t really care about it,</p>
<p>A, you&rsquo;re not gonna be your best at it,</p>
<p>and B, it&rsquo;s not gonna be worth your time.</p>
<p>Why would you spend your time working on something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not interested in?</p>
<p>So find the driving questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, find the driving question.</p>
<p>Find your passion.</p>
<p>I mean, I think passion makes a huge difference</p>
<p>in terms of creativity, talent, and potential,</p>
<p>and also being able to tolerate all the hard things</p>
<p>that come with any career or life.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve had a bunch of moments in my life</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve just been captivated</p>
<p>by some beautiful phenomena.</p>
<p>And I guess being rigorous about it</p>
<p>and asking what is the question underlying this phenomena,</p>
<p>like robots bring a smile to my face</p>
<p>and forming a question of like,</p>
<p>why the hell is this so fascinating?</p>
<p>Why is this, specifically the human robot</p>
<p>interaction question that something beautiful</p>
<p>is brought to life when humans and robots interact,</p>
<p>understanding that deeply.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, so this is gonna be my life work then.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the hell it is,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I wanna do.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And doing that for whatever the hell gives you</p>
<p>that kind of feeling, I guess, is the point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Am I allowed to ask you a question?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>On that point,</p>
<p>because I had this colleague that suggested the idea</p>
<p>that consciousness might be contagious.</p>
<p>And so interacting with things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting idea, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m wondering sort of the motivation there.</p>
<p>Is it the motivation that you want more of the universe</p>
<p>to appreciate things the way we do</p>
<p>and appreciate those interactions?</p>
<p>Or is it really more the enjoyment of the human</p>
<p>in those interactions?</p>
<p>Like, is it, do you know what I&rsquo;m asking?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>See, I think consciousness is created</p>
<p>in the interaction between things.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree.</p>
<p>So the joy is in the creation of consciousness.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>I really like the idea that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t just have to be two humans</p>
<p>creating consciousness together.</p>
<p>It could be humans and other entities.</p>
<p>We talked offline about dogs and other pets and so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a magic, I mean, I&rsquo;ve been calling it love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this beauty of the human experience that&rsquo;s created.</p>
<p>And it just feels like fascinating that you could do that</p>
<p>with a robotic system.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something really powerful, at least to me,</p>
<p>about engineering systems that allow you</p>
<p>to create some of the magic of the human experience.</p>
<p>Cause then you get to understand what it takes,</p>
<p>at least get inklings of what it takes</p>
<p>to create consciousness.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t get this, you know,</p>
<p>philosophers get really upset about this idea</p>
<p>that sort of the illusion of consciousness is consciousness.</p>
<p>But I really liked the idea of engineering systems</p>
<p>that fool you into thinking they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s sufficient to create the magical experience.</p>
<p>Right, because it&rsquo;s the interaction, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the interaction, yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And this is the Russian hat I wear,</p>
<p>which is like, I think there&rsquo;s an ocean of loneliness</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re deeply lonely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not even allowing ourselves to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>And I kind of think that&rsquo;s what love is between romantic love</p>
<p>and friendship is two people kind of getting a little bit</p>
<p>like alleviating for brief moment.</p>
<p>That loneliness.</p>
<p>That loneliness, but not, but we&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the full aspect of that loneliness.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re desperately alone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re desperately afraid of nonexisting.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I have that kind of sense.</p>
<p>And I just want to explore that ocean of loneliness more.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>When engineering, like create a submarine</p>
<p>that goes into the depth of that loneliness.</p>
<p>So creating systems that can truly hear you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And truly listen.</p>
<p>Make the universe a less lonely place.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the meaning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve brought up why.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The physics of why.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of our particular planets,</p>
<p>set of existences and the universe in general?</p>
<p>The meaning of life.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Someone once told me as a physicist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not allowed to ask why questions,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t believe that.</p>
<p>So I think what we are is the creative process</p>
<p>in the universe, I think.</p>
<p>And for me, that&rsquo;s the meaning.</p>
<p>The ability to create more possibilities</p>
<p>and more things to exist.</p>
<p>What is, Dostoevsky has the saying,</p>
<p>beauty will save the world.</p>
<p>What is, is there a connection between creation and beauty?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>So is that like, is beauty a correlate of creation?</p>
<p>It might be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, why is it, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of people have asked these kinds of questions,</p>
<p>but like, why is it we have such an emotional response</p>
<p>to intellectual activity or creativity?</p>
<p>And that seems kind of a deep question to me.</p>
<p>Like, it seems very intrinsic to what we are.</p>
<p>So I do have an interest in the questions I ask</p>
<p>because I think they&rsquo;re beautiful</p>
<p>and I think the universe is beautiful.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just so deeply fascinated</p>
<p>by the fact that I exist at all.</p>
<p>And so maybe it&rsquo;s that, you know,</p>
<p>that intrinsic feeling of beauty</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in part driving, you know,</p>
<p>the physics of creating more things.</p>
<p>So they could be deeply related in that way.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it.</p>
<p>I think this conversation was beautiful.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for wasting</p>
<p>all your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>I really, really appreciate it, Sarah.</p>
<p>This is an honor.</p>
<p>I hope we get the chance to talk again.</p>
<p>I hope, like I mentioned to you offline,</p>
<p>we get a chance to talk with Lee.</p>
<p>You guys have a beautiful, like, intellectual chemistry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating to listen to.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge fan of both of you</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do next.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>Great to be here.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Sarah Walker and thank you to Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>Nat Sweet, Blinkist, and Magic Spoon.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Robert Frost, one of my favorite poets.</p>
<p>In three words, I can sum up everything</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned about life.</p>
<p>It goes on.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
