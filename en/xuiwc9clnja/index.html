wilder or it could be wilder i&amp;rsquo;m not sure was working in the mayo clinic and he observed or read about people in history not having seizures when they fasted so he was curious about that he wanted to find a way that he could mimic fasting because eventually a person is going to have to eat and when they start eating the seizures could come back so what he found is when you put someone on a low carb diet you can actually reduce their seizures by 50 percent okay which is pretty significant and 15 of that group completely got rid of their seizures 100 percent so that began the classic keto diet for epilepsy and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely evolved into various ratios of fat to protein and carb so you could do a four to one ratio where you have four times as much fat to protein and carb or three to one or two to one or even one to one now the more ratio of fat to protein and carb the more you&amp;rsquo;re going to get into ketosis and the less ratio the less you&amp;rsquo;re going to get into ketosis and so one of the reasons why they have different ratios is because as you lessen the fat increasing protein and carb it makes it easier for the patient there&amp;rsquo;s better compliance and they also use the modified atkins diet which you&amp;rsquo;re not calorie counting you&amp;rsquo;re not being that strict when you go to a restaurant and it allows for more protein you&amp;rsquo;re not measuring anything it just makes it a little bit easier now they&amp;rsquo;re not actually sure why the ketogenic diet works for seizures but there is some theories one is that it improves the stability of your synapses between your neurons number two ketones have anti-convulsant effects number three it decreases brain inflammation it could be a combination of all three of these things i do know that the brain prefers ketones over glucose because it runs more efficiently now some of the problems that a patient could experience going on this diet is that they can develop a lot of constipation issues some pretty severe keto fatigue bad breath higher cholesterol kidney stones which is actually not that common but it potentially can occur now my opinion on why those side effects occur is that the classic keto doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily focus on the quality of ingredients okay and so they&amp;rsquo;re mainly focused on the macros they have a powdered drink that is literally you know soy oil maltodextrin casein to me that is definitely not healthy and if someone were to consume that it might taste okay but to put that in your body you might notice quite a few side effects and they generally recommend like synthetic vitamins and things like that what i would recommend if someone has epilepsy and they&amp;rsquo;re going to do keto and they want to do the classic keto diet or any of these right here i would highly recommend tweaking the ingredients to make them healthier i would definitely shoot for like organic grass-fed wild caught pasture-raised eggs things like that but there&amp;rsquo;s some other things that i would recommend too i would highly recommend that they add intermittent fasting because currently they don&amp;rsquo;t and so instead of three meals a day i would do minimally two meals a day now if there&amp;rsquo;s a small child that could be a problem and you might have to have larger meals but the fact that you&amp;rsquo;re adding fasting with this ketogenic plan but i think that&amp;rsquo;s going to take your results to a whole new level i would also avoid vegetable oils because if you look at the classic ketogenic diet they&amp;rsquo;re allowing soy oil corn oil which is inflammatory so it&amp;rsquo;s going to create digestive issues eventually and it could majorly inhibit your results the other thing i would recommend is i would majorly increase the amount of greens like green salads now the thing that you have to realize that the carbs from salad are very very small the calories from salad are almost insignificant there&amp;rsquo;s so much fiber and there&amp;rsquo;s so little sugar that that would be perfect on the classic ketogenic plan and even probably work within this four to one ratio right here and of course i would definitely recommend the olive oil being the best oil even in larger amounts versus any other oil that you would get on salad dressing that&amp;rsquo;s pretty low level now the salad and the vegetables are going to offset the acidity from the ketones because if you&amp;rsquo;re doing four to one you&amp;rsquo;re eating fat you&amp;rsquo;re going to majorly induce a state of ketosis and so the lower the carbs the lower the protein the higher the fat the more the ketones but you&amp;rsquo;re going to also get a lot of acidity so you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to offset that with vegetables and salad so i would recommend doing a good portion that will not throw you out of ketosis and i think it would would really solve a lot of the complications especially even the mineral problem that people have because when you actually start ketosis you lose a lot of water and you lose electrolytes so you&amp;rsquo;d want to add in electrolytes for sure potassium citrate which will counter any potential risk for kidney stones and then the electrolytes would give you the magnesium and so would the salad as well and don&amp;rsquo;t forget sea salt one to one and a half teaspoons a day now if you&amp;rsquo;re doing this diet for a small child maybe you do less than one teaspoon but the sea salt is important a good high quality sea salt himalayan sea salt is good or some other red salts that will help because what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen is as you induce ketosis you&amp;rsquo;re going to lose a lot of fluid and with that comes a loss of sodium and that can actually even make the person feel fatigued right off the bat so this is a real simple alternative to solve that problem number four if you&amp;rsquo;re doing a lot of fats especially this ratio right here i would recommend adding in purified bile salts to handle some of that fat it&amp;rsquo;s going to help you digest it you&amp;rsquo;re going to lessen the side effect of nausea and bloating and even high cholesterol because bile which is produced by the liver stored in the gallbladder helps to regulate cholesterol it helps to break down fats so if you&amp;rsquo;re doing that much fat it might really help to do this right here number four instead of synthetic vitamins do a whole food brand vitamin something that&amp;rsquo;s higher quality not the synthetic ones i already mentioned the electrolytes as well as the sea salt now for those of you that have epilepsy or you have a child that has epilepsy and you want a healthier version of the classic keto i put a link down below so you can download some examples of some good meals that you can use to help get you in ketosis but to do it in a healthy way hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>﻿let&rsquo;s talk about epilepsy in the ketogenic diet in 
1923 dr russell wilder or it could be wilder i&rsquo;m  </p>
<p>not sure was working in the mayo clinic and 
he observed or read about people in history  </p>
<p>not having seizures when they fasted so he was 
curious about that he wanted to find a way that  </p>
<p>he could mimic fasting because eventually a person 
is going to have to eat and when they start eating  </p>
<p>the seizures could come back so what he found 
is when you put someone on a low carb diet  </p>
<p>you can actually reduce their seizures by 50 
percent okay which is pretty significant and 15  </p>
<p>of that group completely got rid of their seizures 
100 percent so that began the classic keto  </p>
<p>diet for epilepsy and it&rsquo;s definitely evolved 
into various ratios of fat to protein and carb  </p>
<p>so you could do a four to one ratio where you 
have four times as much fat to protein and carb  </p>
<p>or three to one or two to one or even one to one 
now the more ratio of fat to protein and carb  </p>
<p>the more you&rsquo;re going to get into ketosis 
and the less ratio the less you&rsquo;re going to  </p>
<p>get into ketosis and so one of the reasons why 
they have different ratios is because as you  </p>
<p>lessen the fat increasing protein and carb 
it makes it easier for the patient there&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>better compliance and they also use the modified 
atkins diet which you&rsquo;re not calorie counting  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not being that strict when you go to 
a restaurant and it allows for more protein  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not measuring anything it just makes it 
a little bit easier now they&rsquo;re not actually  </p>
<p>sure why the ketogenic diet works for seizures but 
there is some theories one is that it improves the  </p>
<p>stability of your synapses between your neurons 
number two ketones have anti-convulsant effects  </p>
<p>number three it decreases brain inflammation 
it could be a combination of all three of these  </p>
<p>things i do know that the brain prefers ketones 
over glucose because it runs more efficiently  </p>
<p>now some of the problems that a patient could 
experience going on this diet is that they can  </p>
<p>develop a lot of constipation issues some pretty 
severe keto fatigue bad breath higher cholesterol  </p>
<p>kidney stones which is actually not that common 
but it potentially can occur now my opinion on  </p>
<p>why those side effects occur is that the classic 
keto doesn&rsquo;t necessarily focus on the quality  </p>
<p>of ingredients okay and so they&rsquo;re mainly focused 
on the macros they have a powdered drink that is  </p>
<p>literally you know soy oil maltodextrin casein to 
me that is definitely not healthy and if someone  </p>
<p>were to consume that it might taste okay but to 
put that in your body you might notice quite a  </p>
<p>few side effects and they generally recommend 
like synthetic vitamins and things like that  </p>
<p>what i would recommend if someone has epilepsy 
and they&rsquo;re going to do keto and they want to do  </p>
<p>the classic keto diet or any of these right here i 
would highly recommend tweaking the ingredients to  </p>
<p>make them healthier i would definitely shoot for 
like organic grass-fed wild caught pasture-raised  </p>
<p>eggs things like that but there&rsquo;s some other 
things that i would recommend too i would highly  </p>
<p>recommend that they add intermittent fasting 
because currently they don&rsquo;t and so instead of  </p>
<p>three meals a day i would do minimally two meals 
a day now if there&rsquo;s a small child that could be  </p>
<p>a problem and you might have to have larger 
meals but the fact that you&rsquo;re adding fasting  </p>
<p>with this ketogenic plan but i think that&rsquo;s going 
to take your results to a whole new level i would  </p>
<p>also avoid vegetable oils because if you look 
at the classic ketogenic diet they&rsquo;re allowing  </p>
<p>soy oil corn oil which is inflammatory so it&rsquo;s 
going to create digestive issues eventually and it  </p>
<p>could majorly inhibit your results the other thing 
i would recommend is i would majorly increase the  </p>
<p>amount of greens like green salads now the thing 
that you have to realize that the carbs from salad  </p>
<p>are very very small the calories from salad 
are almost insignificant there&rsquo;s so much  </p>
<p>fiber and there&rsquo;s so little sugar that that would 
be perfect on the classic ketogenic plan and even  </p>
<p>probably work within this four to one ratio right 
here and of course i would definitely recommend  </p>
<p>the olive oil being the best oil even in larger 
amounts versus any other oil that you would get  </p>
<p>on salad dressing that&rsquo;s pretty low level now 
the salad and the vegetables are going to offset  </p>
<p>the acidity from the ketones because if you&rsquo;re 
doing four to one you&rsquo;re eating fat you&rsquo;re going  </p>
<p>to majorly induce a state of ketosis and so the 
lower the carbs the lower the protein the higher  </p>
<p>the fat the more the ketones but you&rsquo;re going 
to also get a lot of acidity so you&rsquo;re going to  </p>
<p>need to offset that with vegetables and salad so i 
would recommend doing a good portion that will not  </p>
<p>throw you out of ketosis and i think it would 
would really solve a lot of the complications  </p>
<p>especially even the mineral problem that people 
have because when you actually start ketosis you  </p>
<p>lose a lot of water and you lose electrolytes 
so you&rsquo;d want to add in electrolytes for sure  </p>
<p>potassium citrate which will counter any potential 
risk for kidney stones and then the electrolytes  </p>
<p>would give you the magnesium and so would the 
salad as well and don&rsquo;t forget sea salt one  </p>
<p>to one and a half teaspoons a day now if you&rsquo;re 
doing this diet for a small child maybe you  </p>
<p>do less than one teaspoon but the sea salt is 
important a good high quality sea salt himalayan  </p>
<p>sea salt is good or some other red salts that 
will help because what&rsquo;s going to happen is as you  </p>
<p>induce ketosis you&rsquo;re going to lose a lot of fluid 
and with that comes a loss of sodium and that can  </p>
<p>actually even make the person feel fatigued 
right off the bat so this is a real simple  </p>
<p>alternative to solve that problem number four 
if you&rsquo;re doing a lot of fats especially this  </p>
<p>ratio right here i would recommend adding in 
purified bile salts to handle some of that  </p>
<p>fat it&rsquo;s going to help you digest it you&rsquo;re going 
to lessen the side effect of nausea and bloating  </p>
<p>and even high cholesterol because bile which is 
produced by the liver stored in the gallbladder  </p>
<p>helps to regulate cholesterol it helps to break 
down fats so if you&rsquo;re doing that much fat it  </p>
<p>might really help to do this right here number 
four instead of synthetic vitamins do a whole food  </p>
<p>brand vitamin something that&rsquo;s higher quality 
not the synthetic ones i already mentioned the  </p>
<p>electrolytes as well as the sea salt now for those 
of you that have epilepsy or you have a child that  </p>
<p>has epilepsy and you want a healthier version 
of the classic keto i put a link down below  </p>
<p>so you can download some examples of some good 
meals that you can use to help get you in ketosis  </p>
<p>but to do it in a healthy way hey before you 
go real quick i have a course entitled how to  </p>
<p>bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a free course 
i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you  </p>
<p>here is your environment everyone is focused on 
this over here avoiding your environment but what  </p>
<p>about here what about strengthening your immune 
system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course will show  </p>
<p>you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can 
tolerate and resist your environment much better  </p>
