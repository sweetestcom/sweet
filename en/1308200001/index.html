    <p>Hello, dear listener. I&rsquo;m Megan, host of this series. And before we get into the show,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a minute to tell you about our sponsor, FIRE, the Foundation for Individual</p>
<p>Rights and Expression. We live in a moment when free speech, the bedrock of our democracy</p>
<p>and of all free societies, is often viewed as suspect, where many argue that the right</p>
<p>to free speech is too dangerous, and that even listening to ideological opponents is</p>
<p>morally wrong. Many people just don&rsquo;t see a problem with using the law, corporate power,</p>
<p>and even extraordinary social pressure to censor viewpoints they disagree with. But</p>
<p>many of us feel the costs of all this in our everyday lives. We feel it when we self-censor,</p>
<p>afraid to say what we really think, sometimes even in private conversations with friends</p>
<p>or loved ones. We feel it when we opt out of a growing number of public discussions,</p>
<p>afraid of the potential cost to our jobs and even our relationships. FIRE shares a mission</p>
<p>with this show, to remind us why a culture of free speech and open dialogue matters.</p>
<p>And regardless of how loud the calls for censorship are, FIRE&rsquo;s defense of that culture is unshakable</p>
<p>and invaluable. And if you want to remember why we choose freedom, even for people we</p>
<p>strenuously disagree with, you can learn more about FIRE&rsquo;s incredible work at thefire.org.</p>
<p>And now, on to the show.</p>
<p>The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek. Joseph Campbell.</p>
<p>Chapter One. Plotted in Darkness.</p>
<p>Hello there. Sorry to bother you. I&rsquo;m making a podcast and I&rsquo;m going to be asking a lot</p>
<p>of fans a lot of questions all weekend and you&rsquo;re one of the people not staring at your</p>
<p>phone. So I thought maybe start with this though.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good. How are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing good. For starters, why do you like Harry Potter?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I think I had not such a great childhood and I think a kid with not such</p>
<p>a great childhood actually escaped to something else in a book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a story about acceptance and love.</p>
<p>Harry Potter has been kind of like a beacon of hope in a lot of times in my life.</p>
<p>She teaches you the importance of friendships, the importance of forgiveness.</p>
<p>He felt like an outsider and he felt like he didn&rsquo;t belong and that really resonated</p>
<p>with me.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the way people pull together. They&rsquo;re different. They don&rsquo;t all exactly</p>
<p>agree with one another but they can say, okay, this is the common good and this is what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to work for.</p>
<p>What about the author? What about J.K. Rowling?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tricky question.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy with that one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to stay out of it.</p>
<p>I have a comment that I&rsquo;ll say off the thing.</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling is one of the most successful authors in the history of publishing, and</p>
<p>for the past 25 years, she&rsquo;s also been one of the most beloved.</p>
<p>Her books have taught tens of millions of children worldwide about virtues like loyalty</p>
<p>and courage, about the inclusion of outsiders and the celebration of difference.</p>
<p>But in the summer of 2020, Rowling published a string of tweets about one of the most polarizing</p>
<p>subjects in society right now, sex and gender.</p>
<p>She waded into a conflict about transgender rights and the way she believed some activists</p>
<p>were eroding hard-won rights for women.</p>
<p>There was an explosive reaction to Rowling&rsquo;s tweets, which led many, including lifelong</p>
<p>fans of her work, to condemn her and to call for her books to be banned, boycotted, and</p>
<p>in some cases, burned.</p>
<p>So let me talk about the infamous book burning video for a second.</p>
<p>I am not just offended by what J.K. Rowling says.</p>
<p>I am fearful because of what she is promoting on her platform.</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling is literally putting trans lives at further risk.</p>
<p>She just is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting and it&rsquo;s problematic.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s face it, Hermione would punch this woman in the face right now.</p>
<p>The Harry Potter franchise is literally making this world unsafe for kids today.</p>
<p>Rowling was denounced by people she&rsquo;d worked with for years, by staff at her publishers,</p>
<p>and by human rights organizations that had once lauded her.</p>
<p>Actors who had grown up on the Harry Potter film sets, people she had known since they</p>
<p>were children, distanced themselves from her.</p>
<p>Die-hard fans got their Harry Potter tattoos removed.</p>
<p>Some called for anyone supporting Rowling, even in small ways, to be fired from their jobs.</p>
<p>The condemnation moved to rallies, where Rowling became a symbol.</p>
<p>You are murdering trans children!</p>
<p>Just get off our town!</p>
<p>Just get off our town!</p>
<p>My name is Megan, and I spent the first 26 years of my life in a strict, fundamentalist</p>
<p>Christian community.</p>
<p>The beliefs of my church were the complete embodiment of my identity and my worldview.</p>
<p>My family taught me that we were on a mission from God himself, warning the world that they</p>
<p>were going to hell if they didn&rsquo;t repent and live as we lived.</p>
<p>And I was a true believer, certain that I was 100% right, until I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, even though I knew it would cost me almost every relationship I had, including</p>
<p>with my parents, who I love so much, I left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the decades since investigating belief and how it compels us to act and identify</p>
<p>and how it colors and shapes the world we inhabit.</p>
<p>And reading Rowling&rsquo;s tweets, and then her transformation in the eyes of many who had</p>
<p>loved her, it surprised me.</p>
<p>Because growing up, it was my community that thought J.K.</p>
<p>Rowling was evil.</p>
<p>And it was other Christian fundamentalists who had amassed in force to condemn Rowling</p>
<p>and to call her work dangerous.</p>
<p>The Harry Potter books are mainstreaming witchcraft to our children.</p>
<p>They had denounced her.</p>
<p>They tried to ban Harry Potter from schools and libraries.</p>
<p>And in some cases, they burned her books.</p>
<p>God hates this.</p>
<p>I mean, he really hates it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s darkness.</p>
<p>And he is light.</p>
<p>It is evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stepping stone, kind of like marijuana leading to crack.</p>
<p>The little kids, they don&rsquo;t know the difference.</p>
<p>The adults do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a shame on those parents to have their little kids read it.</p>
<p>When their kids commit suicide, I told them so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>
<p>Despite its unparalleled popularity, Harry Potter is actually among the most banned books</p>
<p>of the 21st century.</p>
<p>And Rowling, even though she&rsquo;s inspired profound adoration throughout her career with fans</p>
<p>all over the planet, she&rsquo;s also been the subject of intense, widespread, and vocal</p>
<p>backlashes from people whose politics could not be more at odds.</p>
<p>And for the past year, I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out why.</p>
<p>What is it about this woman and her work that has captured the ire of very different groups</p>
<p>of people across time?</p>
<p>How did Rowling understand her critics?</p>
<p>And what did she think would happen when she sent those tweets?</p>
<p>And so I decided to write her a letter.</p>
<p>I explained who I was and what I was trying to understand, and then I sent it off to her</p>
<p>in Scotland.</p>
<p>And to my surprise, I heard back.</p>
<p>I never set out to upset anyone.</p>
<p>However, I was not uncomfortable with getting off my pedestal.</p>
<p>And what has interested me over the last 10 years, and certainly in the last few years,</p>
<p>the last two, three years, particularly on social media, you&rsquo;ve ruined your legacy.</p>
<p>Oh, you could have been beloved forever, but you chose to say this.</p>
<p>And I think you could not have misunderstood me more profoundly.</p>
<p>I do not walk around my house thinking about my legacy.</p>
<p>You know, what a pompous way to live your life, walking around thinking, what will my</p>
<p>legacy be?</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be dead.</p>
<p>I care about now.</p>
<p>I care about the living.</p>
<p>After I left Rowling&rsquo;s home, I spoke to reporters and historians, transgender adults, teens</p>
<p>and advocates, doctors and lawyers, and many of Rowling&rsquo;s critics, including some who</p>
<p>supported book bans.</p>
<p>And one of the things that stood out to me was how people on all sides of this conflict</p>
<p>felt so under attack, so threatened, that they invoked the language of witch hunts,</p>
<p>even as they vehemently disagreed on who was the witch and who was the mob lighting the</p>
<p>fire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Megan Phelps-Roper, and these are The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, if you guys have water, you sound good, I&rsquo;m going to put on these headphones.</p>
<p>Yeah, we closed that door, but it might need to be locked, actually.</p>
<p>Last summer, J.K. Rowling invited me to her 16th century stone house, where she lives</p>
<p>with her husband, her younger children, and two dogs.</p>
<p>Later I would Google the place and learn that it&rsquo;s technically a castle, which from the</p>
<p>outside makes sense, but inside it felt smaller, cozy even.</p>
<p>The rooms were not high-vaulted and lofty, but snug and homey.</p>
<p>Think more hobbits in the shire, less princess in a tower.</p>
<p>Rowling was also smaller in real life than I would have guessed.</p>
<p>She showed my producer and me into her drawing room, filled with books that she&rsquo;d color-coordinated</p>
<p>into a rainbow over the pandemic lockdown.</p>
<p>And it was here that we would sit together, over the course of the next few days, and</p>
<p>talk.</p>
<p>You have big, deep breaths.</p>
<p>Yoga move?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Okay, so I want to start with a big question.</p>
<p>Why do you think we humans, especially young kids, why do we like stories about witches</p>
<p>and wizards and giants and dark magic?</p>
<p>What is it about us?</p>
<p>And what is it about magic and magical worlds that we find so compelling?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in this because I think it speaks to something very profound in human</p>
<p>nature.</p>
<p>Magic gives a person agency they wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s particularly appealing to a child because children inevitably are</p>
<p>quite powerless.</p>
<p>Even children in happy families are relatively powerless.</p>
<p>And the idea that you have secret power, extraordinary power, supernatural power, I think is hugely</p>
<p>seductive to all of us, to adults as well, but particularly to children.</p>
<p>I want to go back to the early days, and I know you&rsquo;ve talked about this period in</p>
<p>your life so much over the years, this time just before Harry Potter was published.</p>
<p>But I also know that our stories aren&rsquo;t static.</p>
<p>They shift over time with the benefit of hindsight and new experiences and just where you are</p>
<p>in life when you&rsquo;re telling the story again.</p>
<p>I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked a million times about the moment when I had the idea on the train.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said it so many times, but you do look back and suddenly you stumble into this</p>
<p>little pool of self-knowledge or memory that can be so illuminating.</p>
<p>So I had the idea for Potter on a train when I was 25.</p>
<p>Why did that idea come?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really known.</p>
<p>It just fell into my head and I immediately thought, I&rsquo;ve got to write that.</p>
<p>God, I love that idea.</p>
<p>The funny thing is I was never a great reader of fantasy.</p>
<p>The thing that interests me most is human nature above anything else.</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four Privet Drive were proud to say that they were perfectly</p>
<p>normal.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>They were the last people you&rsquo;d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious</p>
<p>because they just didn&rsquo;t hold with such nonsense.</p>
<p>But there was something about this particular story.</p>
<p>Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been</p>
<p>small and skinny for his age.</p>
<p>Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair and bright green eyes.</p>
<p>He wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape.</p>
<p>This boy who was unhappy and without any power suddenly realising what he had and who he</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that</p>
<p>was shaped like a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>He had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could remember asking</p>
<p>his aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.</p>
<p>Can you take me back to your life in the 1990s?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard you describe that time as essentially your greatest fear come to life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The early 90s for me were not good.</p>
<p>I was in a real period of flux at the time.</p>
<p>My mother was very ill.</p>
<p>I had moved from London to Manchester and then my mother died actually on the night</p>
<p>of December the 30th, 1990, but I didn&rsquo;t realise she died until the early hours of</p>
<p>New Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p>
<p>She was 45.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d been ill for a very long time, but none of us realised death was imminent.</p>
<p>That kind of took a wrecking ball to my life really.</p>
<p>To me this decade now was infused with loss and I think, you know, perhaps that would</p>
<p>have coloured my feelings about the story I was writing.</p>
<p>Perhaps that would have made me want to put it away forever.</p>
<p>But in fact, that sense of loss and this real despair that I felt started to go into</p>
<p>the story.</p>
<p>Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.</p>
<p>Mum, he whispered, Dad?</p>
<p>At that point, the story changed.</p>
<p>Suddenly everything darkened and deepened.</p>
<p>They just looked at him, smiling.</p>
<p>And slowly Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other</p>
<p>pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked</p>
<p>as though he had Harry&rsquo;s knobbly knees.</p>
<p>The story that Rowling had begun to write on the train that day was about an orphan boy.</p>
<p>I slightly glibly used the trope for six months before my mother died.</p>
<p>In reality, of course, it is a tragedy to be an orphan.</p>
<p>This fictional orphan, Harry Potter, was abused and neglected and never told about who he</p>
<p>really is, who his parents really were, or how they had died to save him.</p>
<p>And now I really understood what loss was.</p>
<p>Harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life.</p>
<p>The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands</p>
<p>pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.</p>
<p>This little manuscript, only I knew this story.</p>
<p>No one else had seen it.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t spoken about it really to anyone else.</p>
<p>You know, this was the thing that I just clutched onto as I went off on my journeys.</p>
<p>In 1991, at the age of 25, Rowling broke up with her boyfriend, quit her job, and she</p>
<p>left the UK.</p>
<p>I decided I need to get away.</p>
<p>She got a job teaching English as a foreign language.</p>
<p>I went abroad.</p>
<p>I knew that I liked teaching and so I thought, I&rsquo;m just going to go away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take a year out, I&rsquo;ll teach.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know why, but I chose to go to Portugal.</p>
<p>And initially it did the job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m away, I&rsquo;m in a different environment, this is helping me.</p>
<p>But I think that emotionally I was still incredibly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Well, in fact, I know I was emotionally vulnerable.</p>
<p>So while there was a lot of fun and there was relief in not being surrounded by the</p>
<p>familiar, I was pretty lost and pretending not to be lost.</p>
<p>Still grieving, unsure of what her future held, Rowling says she tried to put on a good</p>
<p>face and move forward.</p>
<p>And pretty soon, she met someone.</p>
<p>So you go to Portugal and you meet a guy.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I met a guy.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d been there six months, maybe, in a bar with my friends.</p>
<p>Good looking guy, told me he was a journalist.</p>
<p>We began dating.</p>
<p>It was okay.</p>
<p>It was okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d lost my moorings and I was drifting along in something that wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it was</p>
<p>good to be wanted.</p>
<p>It was good to have affection, but I was kind of adrift.</p>
<p>The months went by and eventually they decided to move into an apartment together.</p>
<p>A year came and it went.</p>
<p>And then I became pregnant accidentally.</p>
<p>And while pregnant, he proposed to me.</p>
<p>And then I lost the baby.</p>
<p>I miscarried, which was hugely traumatic.</p>
<p>It was traumatic physically and it was traumatic emotionally.</p>
<p>And that was another massive loss.</p>
<p>And I think at that point I really was in a very&hellip;</p>
<p>I was certainly not in a balanced state of mind.</p>
<p>And when I lost the baby, I do remember having a moment, in my grief for the baby, I do remember</p>
<p>having a moment where I thought, so we&rsquo;re not going to get married.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clear, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m almost speaking to myself, that&rsquo;s clear, Joe, we&rsquo;re not going to marry this</p>
<p>guy.</p>
<p>But he was putting huge pressure on me to get married.</p>
<p>So I went through with it and then became pregnant almost immediately we were married,</p>
<p>which is a joyful thing because I cannot imagine a world without my Jessica in it.</p>
<p>So in with all the bad, there was an amazing, wonderful thing came out of it, and that was</p>
<p>my daughter.</p>
<p>But as I understand it, even before your daughter was born, your husband had become increasingly</p>
<p>abusive.</p>
<p>Yeah, the situation was a bad situation, but until you actually go through it, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what you would choose to do.</p>
<p>Rowling says she tried to end things.</p>
<p>I left him twice before I left for good, and then I went back twice.</p>
<p>But it just got worse from there.</p>
<p>The marriage at this point has turned very violent and very controlling.</p>
<p>At this point, he&rsquo;s searching my handbag every time I come home.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t got a key to my own front door because he&rsquo;s got to control the front door.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s not a stupid person.</p>
<p>I think he knew or suspected that I was going to try and bolt again.</p>
<p>It was a horrible state of tension to live in because you have to act.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a very good actor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a very good poker face.</p>
<p>And that was a huge strain to act as though I wasn&rsquo;t going.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a terrible way to live.</p>
<p>And yet the manuscript kept growing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d continued to write.</p>
<p>In fact, he knew what that manuscript meant to me because at a point he took the manuscript</p>
<p>and hid it.</p>
<p>And that was his hostage.</p>
<p>When I realized that I was definitely going to go, this was it, I was definitely going,</p>
<p>I would take a few pages of the manuscript into work every day, just a few pages so he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t realize anything was missing, and I would photocopy it.</p>
<p>And gradually in a cupboard in the staff room, bit by bit, a photocopied manuscript grew</p>
<p>and grew and grew because I suspected that if I wasn&rsquo;t able to get out with everything,</p>
<p>he would burn it or take it or hold it hostage.</p>
<p>That manuscript still meant so much to me.</p>
<p>That was the thing that actually I prioritized saving.</p>
<p>The only thing I prioritized beyond that, obviously, was my daughter, but at that point</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s still inside me, so she&rsquo;s as safe as she can be in that situation.</p>
<p>In July of 1993, Rowling gave birth to a baby girl and named her Jessica, after one of her</p>
<p>favorite writers, Jessica Mitford.</p>
<p>She says it was this experience of motherhood that would ultimately push her to the point</p>
<p>where she had to make a change.</p>
<p>I do remember thinking very clearly, and that was probably at the moment I knew I had to</p>
<p>leave, about a month before I did leave, she&rsquo;s not going to grow up and watch this happening</p>
<p>to her mother.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not going to grow up and think that this is normal or okay.</p>
<p>So she started mapping out a way to get to her sister, who lived in Scotland.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been planning a kind of orderly withdrawal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been trying to set things up so I get my daughter out, everything&rsquo;s smooth, everything</p>
<p>is arranged.</p>
<p>But then there came a night, I don&rsquo;t even know what triggered it, and this was probably</p>
<p>about a week before I&rsquo;d planned to make my exit.</p>
<p>There came a night where he became very angry with me, and I crapped, and I said, I want</p>
<p>to go, I want to leave.</p>
<p>And he became very violent, and he said, if you&rsquo;re leaving, you can leave, but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting Jessica, I&rsquo;m keeping her, I will hide her.</p>
<p>So I put up a fight, and I paid the price.</p>
<p>There was a very loud and violent scene, which terminated with me lying in the street.</p>
<p>And then I thought, right, I&rsquo;m going to the police, and I went to the police, and I was</p>
<p>assessed, and I was agreed that I clearly had just been beaten up, I was pretty bruised,</p>
<p>and I filed a complaint.</p>
<p>And the next day, went back to the house with the police and got Jessica back.</p>
<p>Sitting where you are today is one of the most powerful, influential women in the world.</p>
<p>It almost seems like you&rsquo;re describing a different person.</p>
<p>You know, you are a person without a key to your own flat, and you&rsquo;re being physically</p>
<p>abused and beaten up, and smuggling out, plotting an escape.</p>
<p>But the thing is, I am still that person, you see.</p>
<p>To me, the through line is very clear.</p>
<p>Rowling and her daughter moved from Portugal to Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
<p>With just a couple of suitcases, and next to nothing in her bank account, she was starting</p>
<p>over, again.</p>
<p>When you moved back to the UK, what did your life look like?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not going to say it was as low as you can go, because it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I had very kind people who helped me.</p>
<p>I could go stay with my sister, which was obviously not the case for some people who</p>
<p>find themselves in my situation.</p>
<p>And I think I spent two, three weeks with my sister, and then I moved into my own place,</p>
<p>which was really a glorified bedsit.</p>
<p>Wait, a glorified what?</p>
<p>Bedsit.</p>
<p>Do you not have that phrase?</p>
<p>What is that phrase?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like a room and a half, you know?</p>
<p>So my first flat was like, there was a bathroom, but the kitchen, pretty much everything else</p>
<p>is together.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>Like a studio apartment is equal.</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>So much more glamorous than bedsit.</p>
<p>And I called Jessica Decker, so Decker and I were sharing a bedroom.</p>
<p>Rowling said she was even more adrift than when she left the UK years before.</p>
<p>She was divorced, broke, a single mother, and she had just enrolled in a teacher training</p>
<p>program in hopes of eventually getting a job at a local school.</p>
<p>But I was living on benefits, which you would call welfare, obviously.</p>
<p>And I was, at this point, my mental health was not good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never lived in Scotland, although I have Scottish ancestry.</p>
<p>I was really here because my sister was here.</p>
<p>She felt isolated.</p>
<p>She was questioning her worth.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have her mother there to help her become a mother.</p>
<p>She says that she was losing herself.</p>
<p>I was dissociating.</p>
<p>I was losing time.</p>
<p>I was, definitely had suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>I was in a very dark, shaky place.</p>
<p>And yet it was this darkness, getting this low, that she now is almost grateful for.</p>
<p>It stripped away the inessential.</p>
<p>It showed me, even though I was a mess, candidly, I was a mess.</p>
<p>I had this daughter that I loved beyond anything in my life.</p>
<p>It was love like I&rsquo;d never experienced before.</p>
<p>And that was so powerful.</p>
<p>And I do remember continuing to work on that story.</p>
<p>I spent 17 years working on Potter.</p>
<p>And there are things I understand in that story that no one else can possibly understand,</p>
<p>and which I stayed true to, even as my own life improved and my own state of mind became</p>
<p>healthier.</p>
<p>I was still very committed to those parts that I&rsquo;d plotted in darkness, as it were,</p>
<p>because there was a truth to them.</p>
<p>And there was a power to them.</p>
<p>But, you must know who your mum and dad were, he said.</p>
<p>I mean, they were famous.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re famous.</p>
<p>What? said Harry.</p>
<p>My mum and dad were famous?</p>
<p>Were they?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know who you are?</p>
<p>I could have no idea what was going to come.</p>

<p>I am a person who can be pretty obsessive about my health.</p>
<p>My routine typically includes things like 10,000 steps a day and smoothies and strength</p>
<p>workouts.</p>
<p>And yes, I am even one of those people who forces myself to take cold showers, even in</p>
<p>the winter.</p>
<p>But a lot of that flew out the window when I had a baby six months ago.</p>
<p>And I especially struggled to make sure that I was getting good nutrition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was so excited to add AG1 from Athletic Greens to my routine.</p>
<p>I love that I can get 75 vitamins, minerals and nutrients from whole food sources just</p>
<p>by adding a scoop of AG1 to my smoothie in the morning, or mixing it with a glass of</p>
<p>cold water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really simple habit to get into, and it&rsquo;s so much easier than swallowing</p>
<p>a bunch of pills, which is what I did for years and came to completely dread.</p>
<p>AG1 is different, and it makes me feel grateful that even during the most chaotic times in</p>
<p>my life, I can do this small, powerful thing to help me cover my nutritional bases every</p>
<p>day.</p>

<p>A part of the folklore around Harry Potter, which turns out to be true, is that originally</p>
<p>the first book was rejected by 12 different publishers before finally someone was willing to put it out.</p>
<p>Publishing wants to be with the zeitgeist, which is, you know, a business decision.</p>
<p>I think sometimes they make mistakes.</p>
<p>And what they think is the zeitgeist is a very particular and narrow view of the zeitgeist,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s another discussion.</p>
<p>The people who rejected it should be fired, obviously.</p>
<p>This is Charles, a.k.a. Chip.</p>
<p>My name is Chip McGrath. I&rsquo;m the former editor of the New York Times Book Review.</p>
<p>Formerly the head of the biggest books department in publishing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say 1995 to 2004.</p>
<p>So this is right when Harry Potter blew up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nobody anticipated that it was going to do as well as it did.</p>
<p>And this is Kat.</p>
<p>So my name is Kat Rosenfield. I&rsquo;m a culture writer and the author of five books, including two young adult novels.</p>
<p>Even after Rowling was finally able to get a publisher.</p>
<p>When it was first purchased, it was not anticipated to be a particularly big book.</p>
<p>They only printed 500 copies.</p>
<p>The publishers, both the ones that rejected the book and the one that finally agreed to put it out,</p>
<p>they just felt like it wasn&rsquo;t of the moment.</p>
<p>I think there were three things going on with the book.</p>
<p>Firstly, boarding school, passe. No one&rsquo;s going to be interested.</p>
<p>Secondly, it&rsquo;s too long. So the first one&rsquo;s 95,000 words.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t even remember how long Phoenix is, Order of the Phoenix, but little did they know what was coming.</p>
<p>And then thirdly, I don&rsquo;t think it was necessarily, it might have been that he was a boy.</p>
<p>One of the issues was about gender. In particular, the fact that Rowling was a woman.</p>
<p>So then they want me to not use my first name. They want me to use my initials.</p>
<p>They were concerned that a woman&rsquo;s name on the front of the book would discourage boys from wanting to read it.</p>
<p>This has always been a concern in publishing. How do we get boys to read?</p>
<p>And so this pen name, J.K. Rowling, was selected at the behest of the publishers.</p>
<p>Joanne Rowling doesn&rsquo;t even have a middle name. The famous J.K. was made up just for the books.</p>
<p>There was an understanding, I think, at this point that the novel was going to have limited appeal already.</p>
<p>So this was a way of trying to attract more readers choosing a gender neutral name.</p>
<p>In 1997, the 500 copies of the book were distributed to bookstores and libraries.</p>
<p>The first time I saw the book in a bookshop. Now that to me was a bigger deal than I can express to you.</p>
<p>I am a published writer. Look, there it is.</p>
<p>Do you remember where you first saw it in a shop?</p>
<p>I remember vividly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not there anymore. It was a Waterstones, a mainstream book outlet.</p>
<p>And I genuinely didn&rsquo;t go in there to look for it. I went in there to buy a picture book for my daughter.</p>
<p>And I turned and I looked at the R section of the chapter books.</p>
<p>And I was, as I thought, it will be there.</p>
<p>I saw it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely unknown book. There&rsquo;s no fanfare. There was no big launch party.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t in the window.</p>
<p>No, of course not. It&rsquo;s just quietly appeared on the shelf.</p>
<p>And it was one of the best moments of my life.</p>
<p>It was the most incredible feeling.</p>
<p>There was very little marketing budget.</p>
<p>But it became clear fairly early on that children were telling children about the book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a chain reaction. Everybody gets involved with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, in my class, like, you didn&rsquo;t read Harry Potter?</p>
<p>Yeah, like two days later, it was so good, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It was word of mouth. It started to get bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different. It&rsquo;s not like a normal, average book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like so imaginative. It&rsquo;s so detailed. It&rsquo;s almost like watching the book instead of reading it.</p>
<p>Quickly, those 500 copies they originally printed became 30,000 copies.</p>
<p>And then, in less than a year, Scholastic Books, one of the biggest publishers in the U.S., picked up the book.</p>
<p>And suddenly‚Ä¶</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know it, your children almost certainly do.</p>
<p>It was everywhere.</p>
<p>A little boy named Harry Potter is working magic in the world of books.</p>
<p>Harry Potter is an old-fashioned, good-triumphs-over-evil story, but full of quirks and surprises.</p>
<p>This idea of an orphan boy, abused, neglected, unwanted, who suddenly gets a mysterious letter telling him there&rsquo;s a whole other world out there, with a place for him in it.</p>
<p>This idea that in this other world, full of adventure and danger, giants and dragons, good and evil, he&rsquo;ll find his friends, his identity, his courage to do great things.</p>
<p>This idea that Rowling came up with on the train in 1990, it just profoundly connected with so many people.</p>
<p>And as its success grew, Rowling&rsquo;s own life started to become part of the story.</p>
<p>Joanne Rowling, a 34-year-old single mother and currently the world&rsquo;s most successful author, lives and writes in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle.</p>
<p>I mean, she is the subject, then, of this sort of mythologizing.</p>
<p>And while she thought of herself as a writer, she had never published anything.</p>
<p>I mean, her story is, in a way, it&rsquo;s like a Harry Potter story itself. It&rsquo;s a kind of a fairy tale.</p>
<p>Jo Rowling&rsquo;s rise to success is this sort of feminist Cinderella story.</p>
<p>What makes Jo Rowling&rsquo;s success all the more remarkable is what it follows.</p>
<p>She had few friends and fewer prospects, and ended up on welfare, actually skipping meals to make sure she had enough money for her four-month-old baby.</p>
<p>You have a single mom on welfare who writes this book that changes the course of the culture.</p>
<p>Her agent says that Rowling, barely five years away from welfare, could end up making $100 million.</p>
<p>This is a book about a woman who&rsquo;s been on welfare for a long time.</p>
<p>I was so ill-equipped for what happened to me.</p>
<p>Now, I was grateful. I was hugely grateful that the work was loved.</p>
<p>That part brought me nothing but joy.</p>
<p>And materially speaking, I mean, my life had been transformed.</p>
<p>At that point, I was living in a world where I had no money.</p>
<p>And materially speaking, I mean, my life had been transformed.</p>
<p>At that point, I was living for the first time I&rsquo;d been able to buy a house.</p>
<p>But I was scared.</p>
<p>What was happening to me in terms of fame was outstripping me constantly.</p>
<p>So I buy this very ordinary house that&rsquo;s standing on a very nice, ordinary street.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got journalists parked outside my front door. They&rsquo;re within feet of my front door.</p>
<p>So, you know, I felt like I was playing catch-up all the time with the situation.</p>
<p>It was changing faster than you could respond to it.</p>
<p>It was changing far faster than I could deal with.</p>
<p>And all the time, I have this lurking fear because I know that there&rsquo;s someone out there who does not wish me well.</p>
<p>So, you know, that was strange.</p>
<p>And then, well, to tell you the truth, the reason we left that first place was my ex-husband arrived and broke in.</p>
<p>Yeah. So moving became quite a pressing issue at that point.</p>
<p>In the middle of all of this, you&rsquo;re still worried. You have not escaped your husband.</p>
<p>You see, this is the insanity of it, OK?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to retain, you know, like an iron wall around my location as well because everyone wants to come.</p>
<p>Can I photograph you at home? No, you can&rsquo;t photograph me at home. Why not?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being so precious. You&rsquo;re being so starry.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that at all. It was quite the reverse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because the last time my ex-husband knew my address, he turned up and broke in.</p>
<p>What was that like? I mean, you&rsquo;re this rising star and you&rsquo;re still trying to hide.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually the most accurate summary of my situation I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>You know, try and reconcile suddenly having a lot of press interest with really, really wanting to live under the radar for very concrete reasons.</p>
<p>You know, not because I thought I was Salinger, not because, you know, I&rsquo;m Greta Garbo, but because&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on safety.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was living in a state of real tension that I couldn&rsquo;t express to many people.</p>
<p>And yet, with the release of each new book, the Harry Potter phenomenon broke new records.</p>
<p>There were midnight release parties where, all over the world,</p>
<p>thousands of people lined up or camped out all night.</p>
<p>At midnight, less than one hour from now, the new Harry Potter book goes on sale here in Southern California.</p>
<p>Potter fans in other cities like London, where children actually slept outside bookstores overnight when the latest in the series was going on sale.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing about the Potter thing was it went on and on and on. I mean, it was a publishing whirlwind.</p>
<p>A whirlwind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unprecedented in American children&rsquo;s books. It&rsquo;s unprecedented in English children&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that compares to the velocity of the success of Harry Potter.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just kids. Adults are into Harry Potter, too.</p>
<p>Well, I started out buying them for my grandson, who&rsquo;s very young, and then I started reading them, and I liked them so well, I kept buying.</p>
<p>You really feel you know this character.</p>
<p>It was increasingly difficult to describe how big it was.</p>
<p>This is really nothing that can be compared to a normal success.</p>
<p>People kept trying to kind of outdo themselves in terms of their superlative language.</p>
<p>The largest printing of a book ever. The fastest selling book ever.</p>
<p>It was, somebody is picking up Harry Potter every 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The books are now in 26 languages and 140 countries.</p>
<p>The Potter books are available in 200 countries and translated into 46 languages.</p>
<p>It was really insane.</p>
<p>As we crossed over into the year 2000, suddenly everything seemed to just supersize itself.</p>
<p>Everything, from my point of view, became a bit more crazy.</p>
<p>It all became so much that it started to seem like too much.</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling had created an uncanny world, and the phenomenon that surrounded it was itself becoming uncanny.</p>
<p>I was signing for like 2,000 people at a time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got fights breaking out in the car park.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got security there.</p>
<p>Just the enormity of it brought this tension.</p>
<p>There is something about a mass of human beings.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always an edge in a crowd, always.</p>
<p>And in 2000, at a big crowded book signing‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We had a bomb threat at one store from allegedly a far-right Christian.</p>
<p>Allegedly a far-right Christian person.</p>
<p>It was clear by this time that there was a mounting backlash to Harry Potter.</p>
<p>As we approach the 21st century, it doesn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to recognize that our entire culture is in trouble.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re staring down the barrel of a loaded gun, and we can no longer afford to act like it&rsquo;s loaded with blanks.</p>
<p>And a movement was growing to stop Rowling and ban her books.</p>
<p>Things are getting a little bit nervy at this point, you know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a moral freefall.</p>
<p>When your children can be taught witchcraft by Harry Potter, that Heather has two mummies,</p>
<p>you can let your daughter go to school and she can get an abortion without your permission or without your knowledge.</p>
<p>Something is dreadfully wrong when you as the parent cannot control the destiny of your own child.</p>
<p>America has turned its back on the God of the Bible,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s time for the Church of Jesus Christ to stand up and speak up</p>
<p>and say we have a right to the destiny of our own children.</p>
