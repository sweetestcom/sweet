    <p>Hi friends! This week we&rsquo;re talking about productivity. I&rsquo;m gonna give you all my</p>
<p>hacks that are not in the fucking books, okay? All this shit everybody&rsquo;s teaching</p>
<p>you online, all the shit in the self-help books, that beginner type shit that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually work that long, forget about it. I&rsquo;m gonna teach you the real</p>
<p>tricks on how to be productive. So I have a full list of tips in front of me on my</p>
<p>computer and I&rsquo;m gonna run through everything I can teach you about</p>
<p>productivity and how to be more productive, alright? Like actually and</p>
<p>have it be consistent and not just like a boost of productivity for a week and</p>
<p>then you like fuck off again, you know? So the first thing I want to hit on is</p>
<p>being accountable and keeping yourself accountable. And this is very, very</p>
<p>important for being productive. You can&rsquo;t just have like the I want to do</p>
<p>something, you got to have the ass behind it of like I&rsquo;m doing it, you know what I</p>
<p>mean? You have to have both. But one of the ways that I hold myself accountable</p>
<p>is through making worksheets for myself and I&rsquo;ve talked about this before on my</p>
<p>discipline episode and like my motivation episodes. I literally make</p>
<p>worksheets for myself like a fucking child and if you think about it like in</p>
<p>school when you were growing up, when you were going through school, your teachers</p>
<p>gave you worksheets for everything. Like we&rsquo;re taught in school to use worksheets</p>
<p>to be productive, to learn shit, to do shit. Like we&rsquo;re already trained by</p>
<p>school and by growing up the worksheets are like how you learn and how you do</p>
<p>shit. So I was like alright let me just try that because I&rsquo;ve tried everything</p>
<p>to be productive and nothing really stuck. So I was like fuck it let me just</p>
<p>make a little worksheet where I can like cross everything off and like highlight</p>
<p>and like have it colorful. I felt very childish when I first started using the</p>
<p>worksheets and then they started working because you get the satisfaction of like</p>
<p>checking things off or like X-ing them out and you get to see your full</p>
<p>worksheet like completed at the end of the week and in order to like fill out</p>
<p>the whole worksheet you have to do shit daily. And the reason I like worksheets</p>
<p>so much is because I get to see my progress but I also get to see where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking up. So I have a workout routine that I follow and I put it into a</p>
<p>fucking worksheet. I have a worksheet for every area of my life like diet, exercise,</p>
<p>social media growth. Like I have worksheets for literally everything</p>
<p>because it makes me so much more productive and disciplined. But by making</p>
<p>a worksheet if I&rsquo;m like okay I want to look a certain way and in order to look</p>
<p>the way I want to look I have to do these workouts. I can see each action</p>
<p>step I have to take and if I&rsquo;m sitting here saying I want to look this way and</p>
<p>my worksheet is showing me I&rsquo;m not actually putting my ass behind my words</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get to sit here and complain that I don&rsquo;t have the results. So it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>way to keep myself in check and keep myself accountable. Like I can&rsquo;t sit here</p>
<p>and be upset that I don&rsquo;t look the way that I want to look if I can clearly see</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;m fucking up and I&rsquo;m not putting in the effort to look the way I want to</p>
<p>look. So it benefits in both ways. I get to see how I&rsquo;m making progress every day</p>
<p>when I get to like check off the action that I do toward my goal. I get to see</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;m progressing and then when I start fucking up I can see the</p>
<p>explanation of why I don&rsquo;t have what it is that I want. Whether it&rsquo;s money, a</p>
<p>certain body, a certain look, a partner, like anything that you desire. Keep</p>
<p>yourself accountable to what you&rsquo;re doing for it and it will make a lot more</p>
<p>sense because a lot of the times when you have things in your head they seem a</p>
<p>lot bigger or they can seem a lot smaller than they actually are. So when</p>
<p>things seem like smaller here&rsquo;s an example of that. Like if I have a list of</p>
<p>like all the things I need to do to look a certain way in the gym. Like I have six</p>
<p>workouts I have to do a week. If I skip a day and I&rsquo;m like oh it&rsquo;s not that big of</p>
<p>a deal. Like in my head I can play it out like it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal and</p>
<p>then if I skip another day or I skip doing cardio one day after a workout I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like oh it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal in my head. But when you take it out of your</p>
<p>head and you put it on paper and you can track it and measure it you&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>okay it is a lot bigger of a deal to skip two workouts than I thought. Like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing what I need to do to get to where I want to go. So I might sit</p>
<p>here and convince myself oh no it&rsquo;s fine take a day off it&rsquo;s not that big of a</p>
<p>deal but I can actually see how much it&rsquo;s slowing me down and fucking up my</p>
<p>progress. But that also works on the flip side so when things feel bigger than</p>
<p>they actually are when you can track it and you can see it and you can get it</p>
<p>out of your brain and you can look at it you&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s not as big of a deal as</p>
<p>you thought. Like I have a whole worksheet for my meal plan and my diet.</p>
<p>So I track what I&rsquo;m supposed to eat and I have a separate box on the side for</p>
<p>extra things that I ate. And sometimes I&rsquo;ll have a moment where I&rsquo;m like fuck</p>
<p>it and I&rsquo;ll just like start eating a bunch of random shit but I still hold</p>
<p>myself accountable and write it in the box to see how bad I&rsquo;m fucking up my</p>
<p>goals. And sometimes I&rsquo;m like very highly emotional I just like start</p>
<p>grabbing shit and eating and I&rsquo;m like oh I&rsquo;ve just fucking ruined my diet for the</p>
<p>whole week. And then I go back a couple hours later and I fill in my worksheet</p>
<p>and I put what I actually ate extra and I see it&rsquo;s actually not as bad as I</p>
<p>thought. And I skipped a meal yesterday so I&rsquo;m actually like in more of a</p>
<p>deficit so what I ate today wasn&rsquo;t really that bad to begin with plus I was</p>
<p>in a deficit yesterday so it evens itself out. So it nixes your fucking</p>
<p>stress immediately because like when things are inside you they&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>bigger you have all the emotions going on but when you can clearly see your</p>
<p>actions and the result that they&rsquo;re gonna have you can measure if it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>or bad or if it&rsquo;s really fucking you up as bad as you think it is. Because like</p>
<p>when I say fuck it I just start eating I&rsquo;m in my head like oh my god I&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>ruined my whole meal plan for the whole fucking week and I&rsquo;m fat like I feel so</p>
<p>big in my head because my emotions are so big but when I actually look at it</p>
<p>logically and I just see it on the worksheet I&rsquo;m like okay no I&rsquo;m fine it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a way to like put my mind at ease but also if I do fuck up like extra and it</p>
<p>is worse than I thought I know okay add more cardio cut these things these extra</p>
<p>days cuz you just ate enough you know what I mean. It gives me a way to like</p>
<p>rectify when I&rsquo;ve fucked up but it also gives me a way to like settle my mind</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not as bad as I feel like it was. Also the biggest thing that comes</p>
<p>with like motivation and being productive with these worksheets is</p>
<p>seeing that my actions are actually having an impact and my actions are</p>
<p>actually meaningful. Because when you break your goals down into daily habits</p>
<p>you start to feel like it&rsquo;s just the same redundant bullshit and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that important but when you go through and you can see how each action is</p>
<p>getting you closer to where you want to go you feel better about taking those</p>
<p>actions they don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re for nothing they don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>meaningless. You see how each little action even though it&rsquo;s small and it</p>
<p>seems like a little thing how it is important and how it does apply to a</p>
<p>bigger picture. Like these worksheets I&rsquo;m telling you have literally like</p>
<p>kicked myself in the fucking ass and it&rsquo;s the way that I coach myself and a</p>
<p>lot of my one-on-one clients I give them worksheets and I like for their specific</p>
<p>situations and it like pulls everything out and like makes it more real. Like</p>
<p>everything seems so much more real but with that like the consequences seem</p>
<p>real but the progress feels more real and it&rsquo;s so much more emotionally like</p>
<p>reassuring than you think. Because in order to track something you have to be</p>
<p>able to measure it. So you have to track things you have to track your actions</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on so that you can measure your progress and measure your</p>
<p>results. Like even if you fucked up consistently for a month you still have</p>
<p>something you can track and measure. So it&rsquo;s good either way whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making progress or you&rsquo;re not but it will make it very clear if you are or</p>
<p>not and what to do about it once you have something you can measure and track.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing when I said it&rsquo;s reassuring when you&rsquo;re working towards</p>
<p>something especially with your body when you&rsquo;re trying to diet whether you</p>
<p>want to gain weight or you want to lose weight. When I&rsquo;m trying to lose weight</p>
<p>every day you&rsquo;re gonna fluctuate in your weight and with water. Like some days</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna wake up feeling bloated and it&rsquo;s gonna make you feel fat you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel bigger you&rsquo;re gonna feel heavy you&rsquo;re gonna feel sluggish and the</p>
<p>next day you&rsquo;ll wake up and you fucking drank a little extra water that day so</p>
<p>it flushed you all out and the next day you wake up like lean you&rsquo;re like and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like sucked in everything feels tight and good you feel light like you</p>
<p>took a shit the day before and you&rsquo;re like yeah like you feel all good but</p>
<p>dieting like the mental side of it is so hard to navigate so these worksheets</p>
<p>literally make it so easy to follow and easy to diet because you&rsquo;re able to</p>
<p>reassure yourself because like I said every day you&rsquo;re gonna wake up feeling</p>
<p>different even when I eat clean for three days straight on my meal plan some</p>
<p>days I wake up a little bloated and I&rsquo;m like oh my god I&rsquo;m fat the diet plans</p>
<p>not working like I start like catastrophizing and my brain starts</p>
<p>running like it&rsquo;s not working something&rsquo;s wrong but it&rsquo;s been four</p>
<p>fucking days you know what I mean it&rsquo;s like I just feel a little fat today it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine I&rsquo;m holding a little water you&rsquo;re gonna piss it out but the whole thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying with reassurance when you can track what you&rsquo;re eating and track what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing losing weight is a science it is a numbers game calories in versus</p>
<p>calories out if you have a piece of paper that you can look at what you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been eating you know you&rsquo;re under your maintenance calories so you get to</p>
<p>reassure yourself with the numbers even though you feel a little fat today</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re bloated you are still in a caloric deficit you are still losing</p>
<p>weight and it gives me the biggest peace of mind because it&rsquo;s not just like I get</p>
<p>to reassure myself in my head I get to factually see it in front of me on my</p>
<p>worksheet of like no you&rsquo;re not fucking up you&rsquo;re not gaining weight you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fat it is working just give it time wait how you feel in a couple days once you</p>
<p>piss once you shit once you do a little cardio and you start sweating the water</p>
<p>is gonna come out you&rsquo;re gonna get back balance to feeling good because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many ups and downs with dieting that it&rsquo;s very hard to stay mentally sane and</p>
<p>to feel like things are working because when you wake up and you feel fat you</p>
<p>feel like everything has gone wrong but that worksheet is gonna give you that</p>
<p>reassurance and that peace of mind of like no I&rsquo;m on track I&rsquo;m gonna forget</p>
<p>about it I&rsquo;m a little bloated today like Leo said I&rsquo;m gonna keep going with what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing I&rsquo;m not gonna get mad and say fuck it and go bingy because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>working it is working it&rsquo;s taking its time it&rsquo;s running its course this is</p>
<p>normal and it&rsquo;s gonna allow you to stay consistent and be productive with your</p>
<p>goals so since I&rsquo;ve used these worksheets long enough and I know that</p>
<p>they truly fucking work I decided to release them so in the link of the</p>
<p>description of this episode you&rsquo;re gonna be able to download my worksheets that I</p>
<p>use I&rsquo;m gonna put a blank template of each worksheet you can fill it in</p>
<p>however you want you can change it however you want suit it to yourself and</p>
<p>then at the bottom of every document you&rsquo;re gonna see an example of how I</p>
<p>fill it out but I&rsquo;m also gonna throw some like little tips on like things to</p>
<p>know like especially in the diet one I&rsquo;m gonna put some like things to know and</p>
<p>like words of reassurance at the top so that you get a peace of mind and you</p>
<p>feel like I&rsquo;m there with you but I like the idea of making these worksheets for</p>
<p>you guys because it&rsquo;s like my ability to coach you guys without having to like</p>
<p>actually work with me it&rsquo;s like you get to have me in your back pocket kind of</p>
<p>and like keep you accountable and like you&rsquo;re gonna read this worksheet in my</p>
<p>voice of like alright bitch come on like get with it but like I said I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>promote things that don&rsquo;t fucking work so now that I know that these do work I</p>
<p>want to give them to you because it&rsquo;s a tool that I&rsquo;ve found that has changed</p>
<p>fucking everything like I&rsquo;m in the best shape I&rsquo;ve ever been in because of how</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to stay consistent and productive with what I&rsquo;m working toward</p>
<p>so this is my biggest tool I fucking found so if you&rsquo;re interested in giving</p>
<p>the worksheets a shot the link will be in the description I&rsquo;m gonna have one</p>
<p>for diet exercise growing on social media saving money because that&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>one prioritizing what you need to do toward your goals and I&rsquo;m gonna get into</p>
<p>that in a second but I made a full worksheet for prioritization and like</p>
<p>making a correct to-do list and keeping your ass in check and I also added a</p>
<p>worksheet about how to process your emotions so that you can continue to</p>
<p>stay productive so like while you&rsquo;re on your journey of following a certain goal</p>
<p>or working towards something every day is gonna feel different some days you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel like it some days you&rsquo;re not some days you&rsquo;re gonna be upset and</p>
<p>crying and acting like the fucking world ended that was me last night I was</p>
<p>fucking crying on the way home from the gym but I gave you guys my process and I</p>
<p>put it into an actual document where you can type out your answers and like coach</p>
<p>yourself the way that I do with your emotions because your emotions can stop</p>
<p>you easily so I gave you a worksheet of how to get them all in check to keep you</p>
<p>on track with your goals like you don&rsquo;t want your emotions to stop you or fuck</p>
<p>up your progress trust me you will kick yourself like hell if you keep letting</p>
<p>your emotions run you so I gave you a worksheet about how to process them for</p>
<p>you to get back on track and like stay consistent so my next tip for</p>
<p>productivity is something that is talked about in the self-help books but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna expand on it a little bit because they give you kind of like the intro to</p>
<p>it but I&rsquo;m gonna like wrap that shit up for you in a pretty little boat so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this thing called the 80-20 rule and it basically says that 80% of your</p>
<p>results come from 20% of your effort so like 20% of your actions dictate</p>
<p>80% of your results like typically when you have a to-do list there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>actions that are not directly correlated and directly influencing your results</p>
<p>they like have a part to play but 20% of your actions that you actually have to</p>
<p>take are gonna give you 80% of your results like let&rsquo;s say your goal is to</p>
<p>make more money I&rsquo;m sure you can think of a list of all this shit that you need</p>
<p>to do that it would allow you to make more money but whenever you have a goal</p>
<p>for something you have to look at the most important actions what are the</p>
<p>actions that are going to directly get me the outcome that I want so with</p>
<p>making money you need to do the action steps that are gonna lead to the</p>
<p>transaction and to you receiving the money those are the most important</p>
<p>actions to take because you can think about oh I need to learn this I need to</p>
<p>learn that I need to set this up I need to fucking meditate I need to like do</p>
<p>all this shit there&rsquo;s so many things that you can do to prepare but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to focus on those most of the time like if you have a way to make money go</p>
<p>straight for it go for the actions that are gonna get you straight to your goal</p>
<p>as fast as possible because a lot of people get caught in like the</p>
<p>preparation part of like thinking they need to learn more or be more prepared</p>
<p>or be more ready or like get certain shit in check before they go for the</p>
<p>actual actions that will make them more money when you&rsquo;re gonna learn what you</p>
<p>need to learn as you go so as you just dive into the bitch you&rsquo;re gonna figure</p>
<p>out everything you need to know versus if you go start looking up YouTube</p>
<p>videos and trying to read books you&rsquo;re wasting time and slowing yourself down</p>
<p>reading the books and watching YouTube videos and like preparing and trying to</p>
<p>educate yourself it&rsquo;s good but one you already know a lot more than you think</p>
<p>and two those actions are not gonna lead to you making more money like they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>correlate directly it&rsquo;s like you learn more you do more you get money you need</p>
<p>to just go as fast as you can to do more to get money like go to the action</p>
<p>steps that get you to the goal that you want to get to and a lot of shit will</p>
<p>speed up for you you will feel so much more productive and you&rsquo;ll start seeing</p>
<p>results so much quicker as soon as you start going at the actions not the</p>
<p>little ideas and the other shit that&rsquo;s gonna like prepare you or like</p>
<p>sidetrack you like just go straight for those fucking actions that are gonna hit</p>
<p>that goal trust me and this really can stress you out because a lot of times</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like oh my god no I need to prepare more that&rsquo;s more just giving you</p>
<p>peace of mind like the more you prepare the more confident you feel but when you</p>
<p>just jump into something and do it and try it that&rsquo;s when you learn the most</p>
<p>because all these dipshits making YouTube videos except me are gonna teach</p>
<p>you all these things that you might not need to know so you&rsquo;re only gonna learn</p>
<p>what you actually need to learn once you start taking the actions to get you to</p>
<p>where you want to go like that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re gonna learn what you do need and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need it&rsquo;s like school like they try to teach us all this shit in high</p>
<p>school middle school elementary school that they think is gonna help us with</p>
<p>our life we don&rsquo;t use half that fucking shit you know what I mean so don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>caught in the loop of like the actions that are not gonna actually get you to</p>
<p>what you want focus on the 80-20 focus on the fucking 20% that are gonna lead</p>
<p>to 80% of the results and a way to do this is make a to-do list sure duh but</p>
<p>categorize it and the order of priority like what are the most important things</p>
<p>to do in order and especially take into consideration things that have a</p>
<p>time limit or a deadline like whatever needs to be completed first work on that</p>
<p>because if you have a whole list of shit to do and you start knocking out certain</p>
<p>things that are not due at a certain time you&rsquo;re still gonna have to do the</p>
<p>other shit that is due by its deadline so you&rsquo;re gonna feel like you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>lot but you&rsquo;re gonna feel like you&rsquo;re not doing enough because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing what&rsquo;s actually due at that time like you&rsquo;re gonna be working double when</p>
<p>you could just knock out what needs to be knocked out in the time frame it</p>
<p>needs to be done and then save the other shit that&rsquo;s not time-sensitive for after</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna feel a progression of being productive over the course of it</p>
<p>instead of like I feel like I&rsquo;m drowning in shit I have to do but if you would</p>
<p>just do what&rsquo;s time-sensitive first that will free up a lot of your mental</p>
<p>energy you&rsquo;ll feel a lot better you&rsquo;ll feel a lot less cluttered a lot less</p>
<p>overwhelmed and you feel a lot more productive because you feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually getting shit done because like I said if you work on the things that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to be done right now you still have to do the things that have to</p>
<p>be done so you&rsquo;re gonna feel like you&rsquo;re doing a lot but you&rsquo;re not gonna feel</p>
<p>productive you feel productive when you do the task that needs to be done first</p>
<p>and that was the worksheet that I talked about where I said I had one for</p>
<p>prioritization that&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;m talking about that will help you</p>
<p>prioritize what actions to take first like the 80-20 rule but also like get</p>
<p>you a to-do list that&rsquo;s actually efficient like you want it numbered you</p>
<p>want it like in order so my next tip for being more productive is something that</p>
<p>all these fucking people promote in the self-development community and like the</p>
<p>success community about being more productive they just add more shit to do</p>
<p>before you actually start doing what&rsquo;s productive and it frustrates the fuck</p>
<p>out of me so how I just said like do the most important things first and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get caught up and trying to learn more before you do more take the example of a</p>
<p>morning routine y&rsquo;all know I hate fucking morning routine videos I like to</p>
<p>watch them to make fun of people but these fucking people that are</p>
<p>millionaires and they&rsquo;re over here posting like oh I meditate when I wake</p>
<p>up and then I journal and then I read for 30 minutes and then I go on a walk</p>
<p>and then I stretch and then I have breakfast and then I play with my</p>
<p>fucking crystals and rub them on my I can&rsquo;t Leo be polite and then they start</p>
<p>getting to work on what they actually need to do for the day they have a</p>
<p>fucking two-hour window in the morning of all this shit that they&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>they feel is making them productive but it&rsquo;s not like all that shit that people</p>
<p>do in their like morning routines like for health and wellness it&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>girl but you didn&rsquo;t actually get shit done like you&rsquo;re two hours exhausted</p>
<p>when you start work you know like you&rsquo;re the most creative and like ready to go</p>
<p>in the morning like if you can shorten that time between waking up and working</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna actually feel a lot more productive because the things that</p>
<p>people do like all the meditation and the journaling and all that shit it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not actually productive it feels productive but you&rsquo;re not actually</p>
<p>knocking out anything on your to-do list those things might help you sure but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not productive like I said you know you picking them what I&rsquo;m putting</p>
<p>down it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re bad it&rsquo;s not that you shouldn&rsquo;t do them but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to do them like a lot of people get stressed out like if I don&rsquo;t meditate</p>
<p>and read my 30 minutes in the morning oh my god I can&rsquo;t fucking function like</p>
<p>bitch you can promise I promise you can do it but just shorten that gap between</p>
<p>when you wake up and you start work because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s actually gonna</p>
<p>lead you to doing the things that are more productive so if you wake up and</p>
<p>you start work and you work for two fucking hours instead of meditating</p>
<p>fiddle your dick for two hours and like read oh you&rsquo;re gonna start the day</p>
<p>feeling like you&rsquo;ve already accomplished so much like actually accomplished</p>
<p>things that are moving you forward toward your goals not just taking care</p>
<p>of your mental state by fucking meditating and having a lemon water and</p>
<p>going on a walk girl there&rsquo;s time for that at the end of the fucking day get</p>
<p>your shit done first I&rsquo;m just telling you like I&rsquo;m speaking so intense because</p>
<p>I was this asshole trying to do all this shit because that&rsquo;s what everybody</p>
<p>promotes like everybody promotes all this like health and wellness take care</p>
<p>of your mind meditate we don&rsquo;t touch your phone for the first hour of the day</p>
<p>shut the fuck up like there&rsquo;s all this shit and it just made me so tired like I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t productive but I felt productive and then I was so frustrated like why am</p>
<p>I not getting results it&rsquo;s because all this fucking time I&rsquo;m spending is not on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s actually what I need to do does that make sense so literally shorten</p>
<p>that time between waking up and getting to work then you can meditate and fiddle</p>
<p>your dick and play with your crystals and read after like get everything done</p>
<p>that you need to do first so that you can relax because there&rsquo;s nothing worse</p>
<p>than like prolonging that shit all day and it&rsquo;s like you wake up and you do all</p>
<p>of your like morning routine and then it&rsquo;s like motherfucker I need a nap I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to go to fucking work right now and another example I want to talk</p>
<p>about with this is studying like people that are in school when I was in school</p>
<p>I had to like reality check the shit out of myself because I would spend so much</p>
<p>time studying I was convincing myself oh my god Leo I study so much like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting so much done but I still feel like I don&rsquo;t know shit it&rsquo;s because the</p>
<p>time that I spent studying was small the time I spent preparing to study was</p>
<p>fucking huge like I felt like I had to make flashcards for everything I felt</p>
<p>like I had to like read the PowerPoints and print them out and like categorize</p>
<p>my notes and make everything presentable so that I could read it literally just</p>
<p>cut all of the steps before what you do to actually study like the more time you</p>
<p>can spend actually studying the more you&rsquo;ll retain stop trying to make it</p>
<p>pretty stop trying to organize shit be low organized but know what you need to</p>
<p>study and then just study it cuz like for me to sit here for a fucking hour</p>
<p>two hours and make all these flashcards I could have just read the information</p>
<p>twice and I would have run through it in my mind two times more than if I would</p>
<p>have made the flashcards like to waste two hours on making the flashcards and</p>
<p>then have to study them I&rsquo;m tired by the time I finish the fucking flash cuz I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to study them so if I just studied the information I would have it</p>
<p>through my brain twice by the time it took me to prepare to start so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m saying like with studying girl I am telling you that&rsquo;s one of my</p>
<p>biggest hacks for productivity in school and like actually being efficient</p>
<p>with your time you&rsquo;re gonna feel like you&rsquo;re doing so much work but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>actually spending your time on the actions it&rsquo;s gonna take for you to learn</p>
<p>what you need to learn you&rsquo;re preparing to learn what you need to learn you need</p>
<p>to just focus on learning it and then you do go on the test you do it on the</p>
<p>class you learn it see and another thing for like preparing to get ready to do</p>
<p>shit is like stop focusing so much on like preparing to get ready like get</p>
<p>your little water go take a piss and go study you don&rsquo;t have to spend 30 minutes</p>
<p>trying to find the perfect playlist of like background study music you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to like set the lighting and light a candle and fucking get a snack girl</p>
<p>just sit your ass down get to it get what you need as you study so if you</p>
<p>realize oh I need water go get water you realize you have to piss go piss after</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve started studying like on your first break you&rsquo;ll realize everything</p>
<p>that you need and then go do it but just sit down as soon as you have that</p>
<p>inspiration of like okay I need to go study I&rsquo;m gonna go sit down and work on</p>
<p>my shit go do it act on inspiration as soon as you get it you have five seconds</p>
<p>and I know that&rsquo;s the whole Mel Robbins like five second rule but with</p>
<p>inspiration you literally have five seconds to act on it whether it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>idea it&rsquo;s insight it&rsquo;s inspiration anything it is you have five seconds to</p>
<p>put an action behind it shorten that fucking gap and just like go for it as</p>
<p>soon as you feel it just do it unless you&rsquo;re thinking about like killing</p>
<p>yourself don&rsquo;t be so quick on that okay so my next tip for being more productive</p>
<p>is give yourself a certain amount of time to get certain things done like set</p>
<p>a deadline for how long you have to do certain things because you will be</p>
<p>shocked at how much you get done just by putting a time cap on it but like</p>
<p>respect the time cap when you set it because like when I have shit to do I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so much like quicker with everything that I&rsquo;m doing like when I&rsquo;m working out</p>
<p>if I have like coaching calls or if I have like appointments to be out or like</p>
<p>meetings to be on when I have to go to the gym before all that and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>okay Leo you have an hour to get your workout in I literally get that shit</p>
<p>done in an hour like everything like I&rsquo;m very focused I&rsquo;m zoned in and I just get</p>
<p>my shit done and knock it out but on days where I don&rsquo;t have anything where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like I have to do it I&rsquo;ll fucking lallygag in the gym I&rsquo;ll play around I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just like fiddle and fuck around and it takes me two hours two and a half hours</p>
<p>sometimes but it&rsquo;s not on purpose like I just take a little too long during the</p>
<p>sets I&rsquo;ll like pick a new song I&rsquo;ll talk to somebody that I know like I just</p>
<p>fuck off like when I have unlimited time to do things so it makes it feel like it</p>
<p>takes a lot longer but you will be shocked at how quickly you can get shit</p>
<p>done if you just set a time limit on it because like I said when I put the time</p>
<p>limit on my workout it&rsquo;s not like I have a better workout in the two and a half</p>
<p>hour period that I&rsquo;m there versus when I make it one hour I still have a really</p>
<p>good workout and I get everything done but I&rsquo;m more on top of my shit I&rsquo;m more</p>
<p>productive with the time that I&rsquo;m spending with what I&rsquo;m doing because I</p>
<p>realize okay don&rsquo;t fuck off don&rsquo;t take so long picking songs knock your sets</p>
<p>out quit like lollygagging and like looking around and just like fiddling</p>
<p>your fucking thumbs like get on it and go like the time limit will make you do</p>
<p>that and another thing that I do this with is like chores so I will literally</p>
<p>like set up the chores of what I have to do in my house for before I have like a</p>
<p>meeting or coaching calls because I&rsquo;m never late ever to shit like that like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very punctual and I will not be late to it so I use the hour before to be as</p>
<p>productive as possible so the other day I had to clean my apartment I had to do</p>
<p>dishes I had to shave my head and I had to shower this would usually take me</p>
<p>like three hours if I just let myself on like a Sunday do like oh I&rsquo;m having a</p>
<p>catch-up day like I put on music I&rsquo;d like frolic about I&rsquo;d fucking like take</p>
<p>my time doing everything and it would take me like three hours to do it but I</p>
<p>told myself before my coaching call Leo you have to get all this shit done I got</p>
<p>it all done within like 45 minutes like I gave myself an hour but I got it all</p>
<p>done in 45 minutes because I was like not rushing but my ass was in check like</p>
<p>I was in gear and I was focused like okay I have a deadline I have to get all</p>
<p>this done before that like I was buzzing the fuck out of my head like I got ready</p>
<p>in the hour so I&rsquo;m so much more productive when I have a time frame</p>
<p>around how fast I have to get things done I swear it works and you will</p>
<p>literally be shocked at how much you can get done because the other day</p>
<p>before I was going to the gym I was like all right Leo you got 20 minutes like</p>
<p>clean up do dishes and fucking make your pre-workout and put on gym clothes and I</p>
<p>got it all done within 20 minutes and I was like damn girl that would have seen</p>
<p>me like two hours in the other day but I&rsquo;m just telling you for real set a</p>
<p>time limit on shit and you&rsquo;ll be shocked at how much more productive you are and</p>
<p>how much more you get done like you&rsquo;re capable of a lot more than you think in</p>
<p>a shorter time frame and you&rsquo;re only gonna realize that once you start giving</p>
<p>yourself that time frame it got fucking dark I&rsquo;m giving like spooky vibes now</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like Halloween and I got my decorations and it&rsquo;s dark outside now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re giving Halloween bitch you guys ask about my clothes a lot too but I</p>
<p>always have it linked in the description what I&rsquo;m wearing this sweaters from</p>
<p>Zephyr code Leo will save you money but I&rsquo;m partnered with them because I know</p>
<p>the owner and I&rsquo;m friends with everybody and like I&rsquo;m part of their little team</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fucking cute people that wear black everybody knows there&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>colors of black this is like the real black that like good black because if you</p>
<p>get like black that&rsquo;s too light or it just looks a little off like sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll look purple or blue or gray like it just looks cheap like this shit look</p>
<p>expensive as fuck cuz it&rsquo;s like that good quality deep black but like all the</p>
<p>shirts and all like the crewnecks like this the fucking collar like hugs your</p>
<p>neck and it just looks more expensive you can see it I don&rsquo;t have to fucking</p>
<p>tell you but I don&rsquo;t want you guys to think I&rsquo;m just over here like repping</p>
<p>this fucking company because they like pay me like I&rsquo;m associated with the</p>
<p>brand like I actually bought their shit before I started working with them like</p>
<p>it was funny how we all met and it all lined up but I like to promote quality</p>
<p>shit so when I find that I&rsquo;ll tell you but I&rsquo;d luckily have a code so I have</p>
<p>two tips left and then we&rsquo;re gonna get into what would Leo do but my next tip</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re setting goals for what you&rsquo;re trying to do so like you know how</p>
<p>I say when you have a goal you have to break it down into daily action steps</p>
<p>that you can take that&rsquo;s important but you don&rsquo;t want to overshoot it with the</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;re expecting of yourself but you have to be realistic you have to</p>
<p>like take into consideration how much you can actually do consistently so I</p>
<p>want you to get honest with yourself about what you&rsquo;re willing to give up and</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re willing to do for what it takes to get to what you want like you</p>
<p>have to get very clear like you&rsquo;re totally allowed to have boundaries and</p>
<p>have goals you&rsquo;re allowed to say I don&rsquo;t want to give up this time that I spend</p>
<p>hanging out with my friends every night so I&rsquo;m gonna make time for my other shit</p>
<p>throughout the day even if it means I have to do a little less this is not</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;m willing to give up that&rsquo;s totally fine and you should do that</p>
<p>because a lot of people lose themselves and they start resenting the fact that</p>
<p>they have goals and they&rsquo;re working so hard at something because they feel like</p>
<p>they lose their whole life because they just throw it away so get very clear on</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re willing to give up and what you&rsquo;re not and then set realistic goals</p>
<p>for what you can do and what you&rsquo;re willing to do like how much time you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to put into certain things how much energy you&rsquo;re willing to put into</p>
<p>them and there&rsquo;s a lot of actions that have to be repeated so like consistent</p>
<p>actions those are the ones you got to be honest with yourself about but if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>one-time thing here&rsquo;s my little hack for these two like if it&rsquo;s a one-time</p>
<p>thing I have to do and it&rsquo;s gonna take a lot of effort and a lot of energy I will</p>
<p>go full throttle into it and like literally throw everything away and put</p>
<p>all of my attention and focus into it to get it done because it&rsquo;s a short</p>
<p>timeframe I&rsquo;m gonna have to do that for now with other actions if they have to</p>
<p>be repeated and it&rsquo;s like a consistent thing that I have to do over a long</p>
<p>period of time that&rsquo;s when I get realistic with letting up on how much</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put into it like you have to get something that&rsquo;s maintainable for</p>
<p>actions that have to go over a long period of time like for me to try and go</p>
<p>to the gym two and a half hours a day every day is not something that I can</p>
<p>maintain without getting pissed the fuck off or tired of it like I like to have</p>
<p>my workouts be an hour hour and a half and like crunch that shit so that I can</p>
<p>still make progress and feel like I&rsquo;m putting a lot into it without letting it</p>
<p>consume too much of my fucking life so if it&rsquo;s a one-time thing you have to do</p>
<p>be relentless with it give it your all let it consume your life for the couple</p>
<p>of days week whatever that it&rsquo;s gonna take but then what the actions that you</p>
<p>have to repeat over a long period of time be more realistic and don&rsquo;t go full</p>
<p>throttle 110% into it like go into it with how much you&rsquo;re willing to do and</p>
<p>how much you can maintain and continue doing because the whole thing about</p>
<p>being productive is you have to be able to stay consistent with what you want to</p>
<p>do if you just go full throttle into it and you keep burning out every weekend</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not being productive you&rsquo;re not being consistent like you could just</p>
<p>split the effort up a little bit so that it could be more consistent versus</p>
<p>like going full throttle and then burning out another tip I have for this</p>
<p>is check in with yourself every week like especially if you&rsquo;re gonna use the</p>
<p>worksheets even if you don&rsquo;t use the worksheets you want to check in with</p>
<p>yourself every week and track your progress so even if you just do it on</p>
<p>your own and just keep track of what you&rsquo;re doing check in with how you felt</p>
<p>over the week did you feel like you&rsquo;re doing too much do you feel like you can</p>
<p>bump it up and do a little more like check in each week because your</p>
<p>threshold is gonna go back and forth with life what you&rsquo;re dealing with what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling and then how much progress you actually want to make so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to take on more than you think and there&rsquo;s some weeks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be like no I have to cut it back like you&rsquo;re gonna have to go back</p>
<p>and forth like that&rsquo;s one thing I learned from my nutrition coach is we</p>
<p>check in like multiple times a week but at the end of the week he&rsquo;ll be like are</p>
<p>you comfortable cutting more food or do you want to stay where we&rsquo;re at or do you</p>
<p>need to add a little more food to not be in such a drastic deficit for a minute</p>
<p>like how are you feeling how are you able to manage like you have to check</p>
<p>in with yourself and make changes consistently to keep yourself consistent</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t just at one point in time set that you&rsquo;re gonna do these certain</p>
<p>actions and continue with them at the same intensity because like I said you</p>
<p>might be able to do more and you might need to pull back for a little bit so</p>
<p>you can stay consistent because some action is better than no action and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing I fully believe and like even if you can just muster up a</p>
<p>little bit something&rsquo;s better than nothing and remember me saying that</p>
<p>because a lot of the times you can get caught in the whole mindset of like all</p>
<p>or nothing because I do that I&rsquo;m like a perfectionist my rising broke up I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not doing it if I&rsquo;m not doing it perfect but I had to get rid of that</p>
<p>once I started doing all the shit that I&rsquo;m doing now like opening my businesses</p>
<p>and like doing all the shit that I do sometimes just doing something is better</p>
<p>than nothing and it will wear you the fuck out to try and be perfect and a</p>
<p>hundred percent every time you have to go out something like it&rsquo;s totally fine</p>
<p>to fluctuate because one day you&rsquo;re only able to give 80% the other day you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to give 120 and you make up for it so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying check</p>
<p>in with yourself and reevaluate readjust and like check in every week</p>
<p>just remember me saying that cuz it&rsquo;ll keep you consistent and also checking in</p>
<p>every week lets you see your progress you&rsquo;ve made if you fucked up if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done good it&rsquo;s all in front of your face like just writing it down oh my god I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t explain whether it&rsquo;s my worksheet or not like writing it down dude getting</p>
<p>it out of your fucking head you can see it you can give yourself the reassurance</p>
<p>that you are progressing because a lot of the times you do a whole bunch and</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re doing nothing but when you can actually see the actions</p>
<p>you took it&rsquo;s like so reassuring of like okay I know I feel like I&rsquo;m not doing</p>
<p>enough but I actually am here&rsquo;s my reassurance and boom you have peace of</p>
<p>mind but also with checking in every week when you set what you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>for the week I want you to fully fucking commit for one week like that week that</p>
<p>you commit commit to that bitch whether you think it&rsquo;s too much commit to it</p>
<p>literally commit and just push yourself through it for that week because at the</p>
<p>end of the week you get to recalibrate and see if you can handle less but the</p>
<p>whole point of like checking in every week is you commit to that week once you</p>
<p>set it of what you said you were gonna do you stay consistent with it even if</p>
<p>it beats your fucking ass you&rsquo;re able to suffer and it feels like you suffer a</p>
<p>lot less when there&rsquo;s an end date to the suffering so if you know I only have to</p>
<p>do this intense shit for a week you feel like you can endure it because it ends</p>
<p>when you have suffering with no end it beats you up a lot fucking quicker you</p>
<p>burn out ten times faster trust me I&rsquo;ve been there so my final tip for being</p>
<p>more productive this is the biggest tip this is the biggest thing that&rsquo;s helped</p>
<p>me and it&rsquo;s not about actions it&rsquo;s about your mental state because that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>biggest piece of the puzzle a lot of people forget a lot of people promote</p>
<p>all this success shit they&rsquo;re like neglect yourself fuck everything fuck</p>
<p>friends fuck everything fuck your life like be miserable suck it up and just</p>
<p>grind it&rsquo;s like no bitch you got to take care of yourself mentally because I</p>
<p>am somebody that can push myself to the extent of like I can&rsquo;t go no further</p>
<p>like I will burn myself the fuck out I have plenty of times so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>someone that has that level of drive and determination you have to take care of</p>
<p>yourself mentally and I don&rsquo;t like the idea of working less if I want to work</p>
<p>so the way that I go about this and give myself like the mental reset even when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working is I will tell myself every night at 8 p.m. I&rsquo;m off work so I work</p>
<p>from the minute I wake up till the minute I go to bed sometimes I wake up</p>
<p>at 8 a.m. and I go to bed at 1 a.m. like I literally like fucking work and just</p>
<p>work on shit all day but what you&rsquo;re doing when you&rsquo;re working is forcing</p>
<p>your focus on certain things and certain tasks like you&rsquo;re forcing your mindset</p>
<p>to be at this one place and it takes effort and energy for you to force your</p>
<p>focus so if you don&rsquo;t have any periods where you let that force off you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get drained a lot faster so every night I tell myself at 8 p.m. I&rsquo;m off and</p>
<p>what that does is free my forced focus after 8 p.m. because I&rsquo;ve fucking worked</p>
<p>on goddamn day I&rsquo;m good okay like I&rsquo;m allowed to do what the fuck I want after</p>
<p>8 so at 8 p.m. I allow myself to do whatever the fuck I want to do if I want</p>
<p>to go lay on the couch and do absolutely nothing I&rsquo;ll do it if I want to lay on</p>
<p>my fucking bed and go to sleep early so be it but if I want to continue working</p>
<p>I allow myself to it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m forcing myself to stop working I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>stopping myself from forcing my focus so I don&rsquo;t feel that exhaustion which</p>
<p>usually leads to resentment about whatever you&rsquo;re working on so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you that has helped me so much just setting a time for when I&rsquo;m off</p>
<p>work like I said a lot of the times I&rsquo;ll continue working but I don&rsquo;t feel that</p>
<p>guilt and I don&rsquo;t feel that voice in my head like yelling at me to keep going</p>
<p>even till I go to fucking bed like you have to set yourself free from that</p>
<p>pressure or you&rsquo;re gonna burn the fuck out and be sick of it so that is my</p>
<p>biggest tip for productivity just set a time for when you&rsquo;re off the clock you</p>
<p>can do whatever you want after that time whether you want to go fucking fiddle</p>
<p>your dick you want to go lay in the bed like I said do whatever you want if you</p>
<p>want to keep working keep working but what I&rsquo;ve noticed is when I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>forcing myself to focus on things I know that I&rsquo;m free after 8 p.m. but when</p>
<p>I choose to continue working I have so much more joy in it I find so much more</p>
<p>fun I feel a lot more creative I feel a lot more like light about continuing to</p>
<p>work because I want to work I don&rsquo;t feel like I have to I&rsquo;m not forcing myself to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s natural it&rsquo;s like a natural inspiration and boost and I feel better</p>
<p>about continuing to work up until I go to bed sometimes some days I fuck off</p>
<p>and do nothing but I&rsquo;m just saying give yourself that option to take your</p>
<p>mindset off of shit like just give yourself that freedom from all the</p>
<p>pressure you have yourself on or just take that off after a certain time my</p>
<p>time is 8 p.m. alright so now let&rsquo;s jump into what would Leo do and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>you guys write in and you send me your situation and you basically ask for</p>
<p>advice like I tell you what I would do but most of the times I just give advice</p>
<p>about your situation and if you want to be featured on an episode I have a link</p>
<p>in the description where you can send in your situation or whatever you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through like whatever you want my hot take on there&rsquo;s a link in the</p>
<p>description it&rsquo;s completely anonymous you don&rsquo;t have to put a name you can</p>
<p>just put the situation but let&rsquo;s jump into this so the first one someone asked</p>
<p>how do you become the hardest working person you know and I saved that one for</p>
<p>this episode because I have some tips so first things first looking busy and</p>
<p>being busy looking like you&rsquo;re working hard and actually working hard are two</p>
<p>different things so I&rsquo;d say stop trying to look busy or stop trying to look like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working hard and put your effort into working hard you know but the ways</p>
<p>to do that are when you have an idea or you think of something that you could do</p>
<p>shorten the gap between the time that you take action so in action should come</p>
<p>very quickly behind the idea so a lot of people will like have an idea they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>wait they&rsquo;ll wait they&rsquo;ll wait then they&rsquo;ll take the action if you want to</p>
<p>be more hard-working shorten that fucking time when you have an idea take</p>
<p>action start fast start doing shit quick and when you do that my next point is</p>
<p>focus on results like don&rsquo;t worry about how much time it takes to do certain</p>
<p>shit focus on the results focus on getting things finished done and getting</p>
<p>them to completion because that takes a lot of fucking work but when people get</p>
<p>caught up in like I have to put this much time into it like I said before if</p>
<p>you focus on time people will lollygag and fuck around and they&rsquo;ll be worried</p>
<p>about looking busy versus actually being busy you&rsquo;ll worry about looking</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re working hard versus working hard so when you focus on the result</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s most important whether it takes you two hours or 20 hours your end</p>
<p>goal is the result you&rsquo;re gonna seem a lot more hard-working when all of a</p>
<p>sudden you just have all this shit that you&rsquo;re completing versus all this shit</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just working on if that makes sense my next tip is don&rsquo;t look at</p>
<p>any task like it&rsquo;s beneath you a lot of people do that and a lot of people get</p>
<p>too big for their goddamn fucking britches but I don&rsquo;t look at any task</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s beneath me like I will do anything that I need to do to get to</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m going whether it&rsquo;s like the CEO position or the fucking janitor</p>
<p>position I&rsquo;ll do it all I&rsquo;m not above shit I have no fucking ego when it comes</p>
<p>to me getting to what I want that is a hard worker like you&rsquo;re not gonna sit</p>
<p>here and just wait around for other people to do certain shit because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beneath you or whatever like don&rsquo;t look at it like that if there are certain</p>
<p>things that will allow you to buy your time back like hiring a housekeeper or</p>
<p>hiring someone to help manage a team like I get that you have to buy your</p>
<p>time back so that you can focus it on like more important things but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look at it like it&rsquo;s beneath you like if you&rsquo;re hard-working you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>anything that comes up that needs to be done not just what you think that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like fit for and the last way that I&rsquo;m one of the hardest working people that I</p>
<p>know is I work on a lot of shit at once like I have a lot of goals that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working towards at one time a lot of people just say pick one and then go for</p>
<p>it no bitch I allot time for each goal that I have like I have like 25 fucking</p>
<p>goals at one time not really I have like five main goals and I allot time daily</p>
<p>to each one so you&rsquo;ll feel very hard-working if you allot all of your</p>
<p>time to just one thing but if you really want to feel like you&rsquo;re the hardest</p>
<p>worker you know have a lot of different shit you&rsquo;re doing and use your judgment</p>
<p>with that don&rsquo;t just be doing a bunch of shit just to be doing a bunch of shit</p>
<p>like I said don&rsquo;t do things just to look like you&rsquo;re hard-working do the things</p>
<p>that make you feel hard-working which is gonna be having certain times to work on</p>
<p>certain shit because y&rsquo;all know I&rsquo;m a trick of all trades I&rsquo;d be doing so much</p>
<p>shit and like I don&rsquo;t understand how I manage it all at times but really the</p>
<p>worksheets help a lot because I literally have worksheets for everything</p>
<p>I work on so I can keep it categorized and organized like I don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>routine I don&rsquo;t follow a routine at all I follow what I need to do for each of</p>
<p>my goals like and I do it when I need to do it and I just get it all done okay</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s dive into the second situation so someone wrote in and is basically</p>
<p>considering moving somewhere or not and they just quit their current job but like</p>
<p>they feel comfortable where they live but they want to move somewhere else but</p>
<p>they asked what would I do to remain committed to my goal and you asked the</p>
<p>right motherfucker so first thing I would do is get very clear on what my</p>
<p>goal is like get clear on what your end goal is because that will give you</p>
<p>clarity about like all the other little goals you can set to get there but the</p>
<p>whole point about getting clear on what your ultimate goal is is you have to</p>
<p>detach from any specific way of getting there so if you have one goal and you</p>
<p>declare you want this thing and your actions are back in it I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re religious or spiritual or whatever the fuck but the universe knows</p>
<p>your greatest shortcut to get you to where you want to go so if you know</p>
<p>where you want to go you might think this way is the quickest route universe</p>
<p>knows that this way is the quickest route so it&rsquo;s gonna pick you up and drop</p>
<p>you over here because this is the shortcut but when the universe snatches</p>
<p>you out of where you&rsquo;re at and ruins everything that you have going for you</p>
<p>and then drops you into a new spot you&rsquo;re not gonna understand that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the new opportunity to get to where you want quicker like you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>relocated because it&rsquo;s faster so if you feel drawn to this opportunity to move</p>
<p>do it and take it get clear on what your goal is and if you can see okay this</p>
<p>opportunity moving to this place or wherever starting this new job is gonna</p>
<p>get me closer to where I want to go or even if you just say I&rsquo;m open to seeing</p>
<p>how it could get me to where I want to go perfect but if you know where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at right now it&rsquo;s gonna limit you and all you feel is comfort because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just there you don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s gonna actually get you to where you want</p>
<p>to go hop out like I know you have to leave the comfort and take a minute like</p>
<p>enjoy being comfortable for a minute get ready and then go on your next adventure</p>
<p>but when you get very clear on your goal you have to detach from like knowing the</p>
<p>way that you think you&rsquo;re gonna get there because what I have for my goal</p>
<p>and all the different ways I&rsquo;ve been yanked the fuck around to get to where I</p>
<p>am now I didn&rsquo;t see none of it coming like I had literally no fucking clue I</p>
<p>just committed to my goal and committed to wherever the universe snatched me and</p>
<p>dropped me I would keep going toward my goal and I&rsquo;ve gotten so much further</p>
<p>than I thought versus if I just stayed with being a nurse and was like oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>comfortable it&rsquo;s easy I know it like not easy but like it&rsquo;s what I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>comfortable I can do that but I knew it was never gonna get me to where I wanted</p>
<p>like it would have been a lot harder to get to where I wanted to go from staying</p>
<p>in that position you have to release your definition and what you think is</p>
<p>the best way to get you to where you want to go because you are being guided</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re religious or not okay so don&rsquo;t play it fucking safe if you feel</p>
<p>like you are drawn to this new opportunity it&rsquo;s for a reason you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna learn a lot you&rsquo;re gonna learn more than you fucking realize and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have so much experience to draw from and this sense of stability you</p>
<p>have will always be there you can always come back and even if you can&rsquo;t go back</p>
<p>to the exact spot that you&rsquo;re leaving you can go create this sense of</p>
<p>stability somewhere else with the same thing that you were doing you can find</p>
<p>it somewhere else you always have a fallback plan and it&rsquo;s yourself so go</p>
<p>for it okay so our last situation for what would Leo do someone wrote in and</p>
<p>said I have to read this one like from the thing because you&rsquo;re gonna get it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on getting rid of the toxic in my life as in my toxic ex the</p>
<p>one I always go back to I can block him on everything and then months down the</p>
<p>road I have a gut feeling I need to check in on him and I do and he does the</p>
<p>exact same thing he keeps tabs on me but I didn&rsquo;t have any idea about me I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been working so hard on healing myself and trying to meet new people and going</p>
<p>on dates but I just go back to him and he&rsquo;s not good for me and I know this he</p>
<p>knows this so what I would do in your situation is when you feel that urge to</p>
<p>check in on him observe what&rsquo;s going on in yourself first why do you feel like</p>
<p>you need to check in are you concerned are you worried like what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>what are you feeling first like check in on you and look at what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worried about and why you feel like you want to reach out because when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worried about something if your only way of getting the reassurance to stop</p>
<p>worrying is by checking in on this person you&rsquo;re gonna continue to do it</p>
<p>and so you learn to comfort yourself so when you&rsquo;re worried when you&rsquo;re stressed</p>
<p>stop looking for comfort outside of yourself and give it to yourself turn</p>
<p>toward yourself figure out why you&rsquo;re worried what you&rsquo;re upset about what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling comfort yourself through it because checking in on him is just</p>
<p>alleviating you from the stress that you feel because you were in some level of</p>
<p>stress if you feel like the urge to reach out and check on him so as soon as</p>
<p>you learn to comfort yourself you&rsquo;re not gonna feel the urge to check on him</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to get yourself through these stressful periods when</p>
<p>your brain starts telling you shit like oh something&rsquo;s wrong I need to check in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like wait hang on do I need to check in what&rsquo;s wrong has anything led</p>
<p>me to think that something is wrong or am I just concerned for myself and then</p>
<p>look at how can I reassure myself everything&rsquo;s okay how can I comfort</p>
<p>myself without reaching out because that will help you stay on track with what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to do like you&rsquo;re aware this person&rsquo;s not good for you but you</p>
<p>keep continuing to go back so figure out why you keep going back what part of you</p>
<p>needs comfort and how can you give it to yourself and one piece of advice I want</p>
<p>to give about this situation is you don&rsquo;t have to continue proving that you</p>
<p>care about him not checking in on someone doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re allowed to care about someone and be concerned about someone</p>
<p>and still not check in on them if you know it&rsquo;s gonna hurt you or fuck up what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to do like the whole thing with this productivity podcast is to keep</p>
<p>you on track so I want to give you that because a lot of people feel guilty like</p>
<p>they need to prove that they care if I don&rsquo;t check in it he&rsquo;s gonna think I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care about him you&rsquo;re off the hook for that you no longer have to prove</p>
<p>that you care about this person you&rsquo;re allowed to do what you need to do for</p>
<p>yourself to stay on track with where you want to go and if you want to heal from</p>
<p>the situation and move on from it you have to stop visiting it you have to see</p>
<p>what needs are being met for you and what comfort you get by revisiting it so</p>
<p>you can do it for yourself so you no longer feel the need to go back to that</p>
<p>situation you come to yourself first so that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m gonna leave you with</p>
<p>that but like I said if you want to get a copy of my worksheets the link is in</p>
