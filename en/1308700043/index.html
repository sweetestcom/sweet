    <p>Our card this week is Valencio Hill, the Ace of Hearts from Kansas.</p>
<p>In September 2020, the 17-year-old high school basketball player was standing on his front</p>
<p>porch in Wichita, Kansas, hanging out with his family, when he was suddenly gunned down.</p>
<p>For the past two years, Valencio&rsquo;s murder has haunted the community of Wichita as police</p>
<p>try to get information from the few people who may have the answers they need, including</p>
<p>the man that they believe to be the intended target of the shooting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Death.</p>
<p>It was around 9 p.m. on Sunday, September 13, 2020, and Sergeant Ryan Showmaker with</p>
<p>the Wichita Police Department was sitting at home winding down for the evening when</p>
<p>he got a call that there had been a double shooting at a home in the South Central neighborhood</p>
<p>just south of downtown.</p>
<p>As lead detective, he threw on his suit and responded to the scene right away.</p>
<p>When he arrived, he was briefed by responding officers on what had happened.</p>
<p>A woman named Ivis and her 17-year-old son Valencio had been standing out on their front</p>
<p>porch along with Ivis&rsquo;s husband Val, her other son Trevino, and her nephew Adonis Daly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when two unknown people approached the home.</p>
<p>One of them shouted, where&rsquo;s Adonis?</p>
<p>And while Ivis was trying to get Adonis&rsquo;s attention, the two people whipped out guns</p>
<p>and started firing at everyone on the porch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear who, but someone on the porch ran inside, grabbed a gun, and returned fire,</p>
<p>while someone else rushed in to call 911.</p>
<p>The shooters were scared off by the return fire, and within minutes, first responders</p>
<p>showed up.</p>
<p>By the time Sergeant Showmaker got there, Valencio and Ivis had already been rushed</p>
<p>to the hospital.</p>
<p>At this point, Ivis was unconscious and being prepped for surgery, and moments after arriving</p>
<p>on scene, Sergeant Showmaker learned that Valencio had been pronounced dead at the hospital.</p>
<p>Sergeant Showmaker had to break the terrible news to Valencio&rsquo;s family members who were</p>
<p>still at the scene.</p>
<p>Valencio&rsquo;s passing meant the investigation went from a possible aggravated battery case</p>
<p>to a homicide case, so the urgency to catch the shooters was now at its highest.</p>
<p>Investigators wanted to waste no time interviewing the man assumed to be the intended target,</p>
<p>Adonis.</p>
<p>But that proved to be difficult, because he was one of the only family members who wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>at the scene anymore.</p>
<p>Val and Trevino said that immediately after the shooting, like before first responders</p>
<p>had even arrived, Adonis fled.</p>
<p>He phoned a lady to come pick him up and left before even finding out what condition his</p>
<p>cousin and aunt were in.</p>
<p>To investigators, Adonis was the key to all of this, because it was clear from the get-go</p>
<p>that those bullets were meant for him.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t have tunnel vision on any investigation, but you have to research everybody,</p>
<p>interview everybody to find out if anybody else was a potential target here.</p>
<p>But it was pretty clear, but everything I learned, especially from other people there</p>
<p>and the father that Adonis had had, ongoing feuds with other people.</p>
<p>Investigators main priority was tracking him down to figure out who had it out for him.</p>
<p>While they looked for him, crime scene investigators were scouring the Hill&rsquo;s property looking</p>
<p>for evidence.</p>
<p>Technicians collected between 10 and 20 bullet casings, but that was pretty much it.</p>
<p>In drive-bys, that&rsquo;s all you got.</p>
<p>This combined with the fact that usually no one wants to talk to police much after is</p>
<p>why drive-bys are so hard to solve.</p>
<p>Investigators didn&rsquo;t even have the gun that returned fire from the Hill&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>They thought it was likely Adonis&rsquo; gun and he&rsquo;d probably taken it when he ran off.</p>
<p>Investigators searched for Adonis all night with no luck, but finding him in the morning</p>
<p>was easy.</p>
<p>You see, Adonis was on probation and wearing an ankle monitor at the time, so once morning</p>
<p>rolled around, investigators reached out to the ankle monitoring company and got his location.</p>
<p>Now what was harder was getting him to talk.</p>
<p>Adonis was no stranger to police.</p>
<p>In July 2019, he was arrested in connection with a shooting that police thought was possibly</p>
<p>gang-related.</p>
<p>A man got hit in the foot and Adonis and two other guys were arrested.</p>
<p>Police didn&rsquo;t think Adonis was the shooter, but he did have a gun on him, so he was charged</p>
<p>with possession of a firearm by a felon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear if he was convicted of that charge or not, but in 2020, about eight months</p>
<p>after that July arrest, he landed himself in handcuffs again.</p>
<p>According to the Wichita Eagle, in March, Adonis physically and sexually assaulted</p>
<p>a former girlfriend.</p>
<p>He stole her phone, then led police on a car chase.</p>
<p>He eventually ditched the car and tried to flee on foot, but he was quickly apprehended.</p>
<p>He faced several charges, including aggravated sexual battery, domestic violence, criminal</p>
<p>threat, and theft.</p>
<p>He was actually in the middle of facing those charges when the shooting at the Hills House</p>
<p>happened.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he was on probation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear where he was in the adjudication process at this point, but he would eventually</p>
<p>be sentenced to 13 months in prison for that incident.</p>
<p>Anyway, since Adonis was a known gang member and criminal, police knew that they might</p>
<p>be looking at a long list of potential suspects, and they were hoping that Adonis could help</p>
<p>them narrow down that list.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;d had beef with a specific rival gang member, or maybe there&rsquo;d been a big</p>
<p>fight recently that escalated to the shooting.</p>
<p>But when investigators found him and started asking questions about his cousin&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t want to cooperate.</p>
<p>He told police that he didn&rsquo;t have any problems with anyone and didn&rsquo;t know anybody</p>
<p>who would have wanted to shoot him or anyone else on that porch.</p>
<p>I mean, this guy&rsquo;s cousin was just murdered as collateral damage from someone trying to</p>
<p>kill him, and he didn&rsquo;t even so much as want to give police a few names to look into.</p>
<p>Has Adonis ever, like, showed any emotion or remorse over his, like, you know, little</p>
<p>cousin getting killed over whatever beef he may have had?</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>Since Adonis wasn&rsquo;t cooperating, police continued their investigation through other routes.</p>
<p>Officers canvassed the Hills neighborhood, hoping to find someone who&rsquo;d witnessed the</p>
<p>shooting and maybe got a look at the suspects.</p>
<p>But as they knocked on door after door, no one was coming forward and saying they saw</p>
<p>anything.</p>
<p>But officers did find something helpful.</p>
<p>Surveillance footage.</p>
<p>The Hills had several neighbors and a business right across the street that had security</p>
<p>cameras.</p>
<p>This video is actually pretty good, but if you see actually the vehicle park and the</p>
<p>suspects will get out of the vehicle, they&rsquo;ll walk right towards a house that has a surveillance</p>
<p>video.</p>
<p>The only problem is at that time where it&rsquo;s getting dark, that surveillance video really</p>
<p>pixelates a lot.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, it was at that time, if it had been a little bit earlier and more</p>
<p>daylight, it would have been, we would have been able to see suspects because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right, right in the, basically on the sidewalk in front of that house.</p>
<p>Even though it was too dark outside for detectives to make out any defining features of their</p>
<p>suspects, they got a great description of the car.</p>
<p>A black four-door Mercedes with a Mercedes emblem on the hood and Kansas license plates.</p>
<p>While police were busy trying to track the vehicle, the community of Wichita was mourning</p>
<p>the loss of a bright young life.</p>
<p>Valencio was a student at Wichita West High School where his teachers say he excelled</p>
<p>in all of his classes and was well-liked by everyone from teachers to students.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t just gifted academically.</p>
<p>Valencio was a skilled athlete and played on his school&rsquo;s basketball team.</p>
<p>From his personal life, Valencio seemed to be a happy kid.</p>
<p>He did not, just by talking to everybody and going through his phone, everybody told me</p>
<p>that he was extremely well-liked by members of the school, members of the community as</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, going through his phone, it seemed to be that he didn&rsquo;t have any enemies, that</p>
<p>he was very well-liked by people.</p>
<p>But, I mean, the one common theme that we have with Valencio is people liked him.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have bad blood with anybody, that we can tell, that his friends knew about,</p>
<p>that his family knew about.</p>
<p>On September 19th, six days after Valencio&rsquo;s murder, friends, family, and classmates gathered</p>
<p>outside the Hill&rsquo;s house to hold a vigil in his honor.</p>
<p>The family&rsquo;s front lawn was decorated with pictures of Valencio, they had candles and</p>
<p>flowers and balloons as members of the community rallied around the Hills to support them during</p>
<p>their devastating loss.</p>
<p>But in the midst of everyone showing support for the Hills, police learned that not everyone</p>
<p>in the community was mourning Valencio&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Investigators got a tip that two teenage boys were chatting back and forth on social media,</p>
<p>making disparaging comments about Valencio.</p>
<p>Something along the lines of, I did a dance when I heard his body drop.</p>
<p>Obviously, this was a big red flag for detectives, so they tracked down the two kids and asked</p>
<p>them to explain the comments.</p>
<p>And the boys provided what I guess they thought was an explanation.</p>
<p>They said that the things they were saying were lines from a rap song, like it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stuff that they were coming up with, they were just referencing a song, they said.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s unclear what song because Sergeant Showmaker didn&rsquo;t remember and we couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find a song with those lyrics.</p>
<p>But investigators went on to ask the boys how they knew Valencio, but neither of them</p>
<p>really did at all.</p>
<p>I mean, they maybe had a class or two with him a few years back, but that was it.</p>
<p>And Valencio&rsquo;s phone confirmed this, there had been no communication between him and</p>
<p>these two guys.</p>
<p>Sergeant Showmaker said this is actually something he&rsquo;s seen before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s distasteful, but I&rsquo;ve come to find through doing that job that it&rsquo;s kind of popular just</p>
<p>to, for lack of, I guess, better term, to just talk crap, just to kind of shoot your</p>
<p>mouth off.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re teenagers or they have an odd sense of humor or what,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually more common than you would think.</p>
<p>Aside from their distasteful comments, investigators had no real reason to suspect the two teens.</p>
<p>In fact, one of them even proved that he was out of state when Valencio was killed.</p>
<p>So detectives went back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t take long for their next big tip to come in.</p>
<p>Because on September 21st, detectives received word from the hospital that Valencio&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>was awake and she was ready to talk.</p>
<p>Detectives went to the hospital and got Ivis&rsquo; statement, which matched up with everyone</p>
<p>else&rsquo;s account of that night.</p>
<p>She had told me that they were sitting on the porch.</p>
<p>It was kind of darkish out.</p>
<p>She saw two, she didn&rsquo;t find it, two black males come up towards the residence from the</p>
<p>street, asked for Adonis.</p>
<p>And she said, she turned, said, hey, nephew.</p>
<p>And then at that point or shortly thereafter, that shots were fired.</p>
<p>The next thing she knows, she&rsquo;s hit and she&rsquo;s down on the ground.</p>
<p>Since Ivis was the one who saw the suspect at first, investigators were hopeful that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d gotten a better view of them than everyone else.</p>
<p>And she actually did.</p>
<p>So much so that she believed she could ID one of them.</p>
<p>Ivis told Sergeant Showmaker that she thought one of the shooters was a guy that she knew.</p>
<p>Police asked us to refer to him as Steven.</p>
<p>Ivis said that she could actually show investigators a picture of Steven.</p>
<p>She pulled out her phone and showed Sergeant Showmaker a Facebook picture of several people</p>
<p>and pointed to one of them.</p>
<p>Sergeant Showmaker knew Steven&rsquo;s name sounded familiar, so he took the photo of him back</p>
<p>to his supervisor to see if he knew the guy.</p>
<p>And his supervisor said, sure, I know Steven, but the guy in that picture is not Steven.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s someone named Ahmaud.</p>
<p>But he followed that up by saying Ahmaud couldn&rsquo;t be their guy because he knew that Ahmaud was</p>
<p>in jail when the murder happened.</p>
<p>Now Ahmaud did bear a passing resemblance to Steven.</p>
<p>So investigators thought maybe it really was Steven who Ivis saw that day.</p>
<p>And that suspicion would only grow a few days later when Adonis was arrested.</p>
<p>Sergeant Showmaker didn&rsquo;t want to get into the charges he was arrested on.</p>
<p>But regardless, when he was taken into custody, his phone was confiscated.</p>
<p>And investigators went through it and found some suspicious correspondence between him</p>
<p>and Steven.</p>
<p>Based on the messages, Sergeant Showmaker gathered that Steven was mad at Adonis for</p>
<p>sleeping with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>And it seemed like there was maybe some other instance of disrespect that Steven was upset</p>
<p>about as well.</p>
<p>So these messages, paired with Ivis&rsquo;s loose identification of him, made Steven move right</p>
<p>to the top of the suspect list.</p>
<p>Detectives were hopeful that they could sit down with Steven and interview him.</p>
<p>But Steven&rsquo;s attorney refused that idea immediately.</p>
<p>But detectives didn&rsquo;t let that stop them from investigating him further.</p>
<p>They started by taking a deep dive into the cell data for Steven&rsquo;s phone number.</p>
<p>Or should I say phone numbers, plural.</p>
<p>Though Sergeant Showmaker said that getting those warrants was no easy task.</p>
<p>Basically, these turned out to be a lot of these search warrants, especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going really in-depth like these were, where you&rsquo;re going from one thing, which one thing</p>
<p>leads to another, which leads to five other things.</p>
<p>And they become kind of novel.</p>
<p>So you need to be extremely specific.</p>
<p>Once they got the warrants, they requested the GPS data from Steven&rsquo;s phone for the</p>
<p>day Valencia was killed to see if he was nearby the Hill&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>But when investigators got the results, things weren&rsquo;t as straightforward as they&rsquo;d hoped.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neither positive or negative.</p>
<p>We know that Steven was somewhat in the area at the time, but the phone&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The location records we have, it&rsquo;s not moving at the time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just like all day stagnant in one area.</p>
<p>Basically, investigators had determined a location range that the killer&rsquo;s phone would</p>
<p>have been in.</p>
<p>And the data showed that Steven&rsquo;s phone was just outside of that perimeter.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t enough evidence for investigators to arrest him or even make him seem that much</p>
<p>more suspicious.</p>
<p>But it also wasn&rsquo;t enough to make him seem less likely of a viable suspect.</p>
<p>But since he was refusing to talk to police, investigators were kind of stuck.</p>
<p>So they moved on to a different promising lead.</p>
<p>You see, when investigators were going through Adonis&rsquo; phone, they learned of another person</p>
<p>Adonis had an ongoing feud with.</p>
<p>Adonis and a man who we&rsquo;ve been asked to refer to as Larry had been fighting back and</p>
<p>forth on Facebook for quite a while because Adonis and Larry&rsquo;s sister were in an on-again</p>
<p>and off-again relationship for the past few years.</p>
<p>And allegedly, Adonis had been abusing her.</p>
<p>Larry was understandably furious with Adonis for beating his sister.</p>
<p>So Larry sent Adonis a bunch of messages expressing that anger and threatening him physically.</p>
<p>Larry was a gang member himself and had an extensive and violent criminal history.</p>
<p>So detectives knew he was definitely capable of something like this.</p>
<p>Now Larry too was easy for detectives to track down because shortly after Valencio&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d been arrested on unrelated charges.</p>
<p>But when investigators asked Larry if he&rsquo;d sit down for an interview about Valencio&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case, he declined.</p>
<p>He wanted no part in the investigation.</p>
<p>So again, with no physical evidence pointing to him, police couldn&rsquo;t do much without his</p>
<p>cooperation.</p>
<p>They pushed pause on actively pursuing him and hoped that something else would come along.</p>
<p>And sure enough, something did.</p>
<p>In November, this is two months after Valencio&rsquo;s murder, investigators got a call from an inmate</p>
<p>at the local jail.</p>
<p>He told them that he had some information to share with them about Larry.</p>
<p>The inmate was a friend of one of Larry&rsquo;s relatives and the inmate knew that Larry was</p>
<p>involved in the murder.</p>
<p>He told police that there was a recent heated argument between Adonis and Larry about some</p>
<p>possible pregnancy issues with Larry&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s unclear what he means by pregnancy issues.</p>
<p>Like whether Adonis had gotten Larry&rsquo;s sister pregnant and he wasn&rsquo;t happy about it, or</p>
<p>if it was something else.</p>
<p>But apparently this argument led to Larry saying that he was going to have Adonis killed.</p>
<p>And since Larry was higher up in the ranks of the gang, the tipster said that he had</p>
<p>other people do the dirty work for him.</p>
<p>Now when this person gave the information, they were actually pretty specific on.</p>
<p>Now none of this was released before this.</p>
<p>None of the information on the car, what the car does, but this person had very good facts</p>
<p>about how they pulled up, where they parked at, how many were there, what they came up</p>
<p>with and what they did, and what kind of car they were driving.</p>
<p>So they had some pretty good information on that.</p>
<p>This tip was a huge break for police, but in order for the informant to be able to testify</p>
<p>in court, all of it had to go through the district attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>While the district attorney&rsquo;s office was handling that, Sergeant Showmaker had some officers</p>
<p>drop by a house that another one of Larry&rsquo;s relatives stayed at.</p>
<p>And in the driveway, those officers saw a black four-door Mercedes with a Mercedes emblem</p>
<p>on the hood, the exact kind of car seen on surveillance footage.</p>
<p>Since that kind of car is pretty common, it could have just been a coincidence.</p>
<p>But for Sergeant Showmaker, it certainly added to his mounting suspicion of Larry.</p>
<p>In the following days, Sergeant Showmaker tried reaching out to Larry&rsquo;s sister, thinking</p>
<p>maybe she would be willing to talk, but she too refused to cooperate.</p>
<p>So investigators turned to search warrants, specifically for Larry&rsquo;s phones.</p>
<p>Once they got those warrants, police found even more messages between Adonis and Larry,</p>
<p>ones they hadn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear why they hadn&rsquo;t seen the messages when they were going through Adonis&rsquo; phone.</p>
<p>Maybe he deleted the text or something, but the messages were more arguments about Larry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sister and how Adonis was treating her.</p>
<p>And there were other incriminating messages they found too, particularly a message from</p>
<p>Larry&rsquo;s girlfriend from around the time Valencia was killed, where she referenced him having</p>
<p>something to do with the murder.</p>
<p>But right around the time police were learning about this message, detectives got another</p>
<p>lucky break in the investigation that was completely unrelated to Larry.</p>
<p>Near the end of 2020, investigators got around to uploading the bullets found at the scene</p>
<p>to the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network, or N-I-B-I-N.</p>
<p>And there were actually hits.</p>
<p>One of the guns used in the shooting at the Hills House had also been used in a few local</p>
<p>drive-by cases, one in July 2020, another in April 2020.</p>
<p>And it had been used in an unsolved aggravated assault case, get this, on the day of Valencia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>Now, we weren&rsquo;t given more information about that aggravated assault, but Sergeant Showmaker</p>
<p>said there&rsquo;s no way to prove that it and Valencia&rsquo;s murder were carried out by the</p>
<p>same person because guns get passed around from person to person quickly.</p>
<p>So the only thing definitively connecting those incidents was the shell casings.</p>
<p>The other firearm was connected to a criminal discharge of a firearm case from 2019 and</p>
<p>a homicide in another county in late 2019.</p>
<p>And investigators learned that in that case, a suspect was arrested.</p>
<p>Detectives checked into the suspect in that case to see if he could be considered for</p>
<p>Valencia&rsquo;s case, but he was actually out of state at the time of Valencia&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>As great as those N-I-B-I-N hits seemed, they didn&rsquo;t turn up much.</p>
<p>So detectives decided to return to their most promising suspect, Larry, and reach out</p>
<p>to a potential informant, his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Sergeant Showmaker contacted her and asked her to sit down for an interview.</p>
<p>And to his surprise, she agreed.</p>
<p>In March 2021, investigators sat down with her, and it&rsquo;s unclear why it took so long</p>
<p>to get her to sit down for a formal interview.</p>
<p>But whatever the case, once she did come in, she was hesitant to answer any of their questions,</p>
<p>so police ended up getting almost no information.</p>
<p>But a few months later in June, Larry&rsquo;s girlfriend reached out to police again and</p>
<p>told them that she wanted another interview, and this time she was willing to really talk.</p>
<p>When they spoke, she told investigators that Larry often drove a vehicle that matched the</p>
<p>description of the suspect vehicle.</p>
<p>Which great, but no surprise there, right, since investigators already saw that he had</p>
<p>access to a similar vehicle.</p>
<p>But then she did tell them something they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>She said that the night of September 13th, when Larry came home, she asked where he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been, and he responded something along the lines of, just watch the news.</p>
<p>This is incriminating, but it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done everything we can do on Larry.</p>
<p>As far as locations, records of various sorts, it means various social media accounts.</p>
<p>We just ran to a dead end where that&rsquo;s where we have what we have and we can&rsquo;t gain anymore.</p>
<p>As far as that inmate potentially testifying against Larry, Sergeant Showmaker said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a while since he&rsquo;s heard from the attorney&rsquo;s office, but he&rsquo;s holding out hope that it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>work out for them.</p>
<p>Sergeant Showmaker said the biggest problem for the investigation has been the lack of</p>
<p>cooperation from those that he needs to talk most, specifically Adonis.</p>
<p>And he hopes it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Adonis starts talking.</p>
<p>For Valencio&rsquo;s family, the past two years have been excruciating.</p>
<p>Adonis still visits Valencio&rsquo;s gravesite almost every day.</p>
<p>She keeps it decorated with flowers, pictures of him, and basketballs, keeping his memory</p>
<p>alive, however she can.</p>
<p>It sounds wrong to say that Valencio was in the wrong place at the wrong time because</p>
<p>that place was his own front porch, just having a good time with his family.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s truly what it was.</p>
<p>Valencio did nothing to deserve what happened to him.</p>
<p>He was a great, caring kid with a bright future ahead of him, and his life was cut far too</p>
<p>short by two cowards with guns.</p>
<p>Valencio&rsquo;s family deserves answers, and Valencio deserves justice.</p>
