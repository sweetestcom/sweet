    <p>Our card this week is James Rowe and John and Nancy Spivey, the Jack of Spades from</p>
<p>Florida.</p>
<p>On a cool January evening in 1991, the three roommates hosted a small group of friends</p>
<p>in their St. Petersburg apartment for a night of drinks and card games.</p>
<p>But exactly what happened next that night has baffled investigators for three decades.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On January 10th, 1991, during the pre-dawn hours in the Tampa Bay area, a man, who we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna call Ralph, headed to pick up his three colleagues for work.</p>
<p>Ralph, along with 60-year-old James Rowe and married couple John and Nancy Spivey, who</p>
<p>were 33 and 37, were all day laborers and made their living by picking up odd jobs through</p>
<p>a temp services agency in St. Petersburg, where they lived.</p>
<p>It was around 5.30 that morning when Ralph climbed the stairs of the apartment complex</p>
<p>and knocked on the door to the small one-bedroom, one-bath unit, but nobody came to greet him.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t even pick up any sounds of feet shuffling or people getting ready from inside.</p>
<p>Thinking maybe they were still asleep, he shrugged it off and went out to grab some</p>
<p>coffee and breakfast.</p>
<p>Since they got their work through the temp agency, they weren&rsquo;t expected to clock in</p>
<p>at a certain time, so it&rsquo;s not really a big deal.</p>
<p>First come, first served.</p>
<p>Ralph returned about an hour later and knocked again, but this time he noticed something</p>
<p>out of place, something that gave him pause.</p>
<p>This time, the door was slightly ajar.</p>
<p>Now whether he noticed the door was slightly open the previous time he showed up at the</p>
<p>apartment, or if it was even open then, police aren&rsquo;t sure.</p>
<p>But now that he saw it, it made Ralph super uneasy.</p>
<p>So uneasy, he didn&rsquo;t even dare go inside alone.</p>
<p>Ralph left the apartment and walked out to a nearby street where a St. Petersburg police</p>
<p>officer happened to be patrolling the area.</p>
<p>He flagged down the cop and directed the officer to the apartment as he explained why he was</p>
<p>so concerned.</p>
<p>When the officer reached the front door, he too knocked and called out for someone to</p>
<p>respond.</p>
<p>Taking in the silence, the cop thought this was definitely reason enough for a welfare</p>
<p>check, so since the door was technically already open, he stepped inside.</p>
<p>But nothing could have prepared him for what was waiting on the other side.</p>
<p>There on the floor were the bodies of John and Nancy, with blood covering their faces</p>
<p>and pooling around them.</p>
<p>Observing no signs of life, the officer continued to call out as he cleared the residence to</p>
<p>make sure there wasn&rsquo;t any kind of looming threat.</p>
<p>When he got to the bedroom, the officer saw the couple&rsquo;s roommate, James, lying on his</p>
<p>blood-soaked bed.</p>
<p>All three were so brutalized that it wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious how they may have died.</p>
<p>Over the next few hours, cops and first responders were all over the place, and investigators</p>
<p>began their work of processing the apartment for possible evidence as well as documenting</p>
<p>the crime scene with photos and a video walkthrough.</p>
<p>According to reporting from the Tampa Bay Times, which was called the St. Petersburg</p>
<p>Times back then, quote-unquote, bags of evidence were taken from inside the apartment, though</p>
<p>police both now and then wouldn&rsquo;t say what was in those bags.</p>
<p>As far as police on the scene could tell, nothing had been rummaged through or taken,</p>
<p>and it probably would have been easy to spot if something was missing because the apartment</p>
<p>was small.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking like six, maybe 700 square feet.</p>
<p>St. Petersburg Police Detective Wallace Pavelski, who heads up the department&rsquo;s cold case unit,</p>
<p>was the lead on the case.</p>
<p>The biggest thing I think they were trying to determine was what was the motive for what</p>
<p>occurred.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the biggest mystery to the case right now, is there was no motive</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>Robbery didn&rsquo;t appear to be any type of a motivation in this case.</p>
<p>Looking at the three bodies, investigators couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that each of the</p>
<p>victims looked as if they had been attacked in the position in which they were found,</p>
<p>possibly while they were sleeping, because John and Nancy were lying on the floor and</p>
<p>James was on his bed.</p>
<p>Each of their autopsies were scheduled for the following day, January 11th, and St. Petersburg</p>
<p>officers got to work canvassing the rest of the apartment complex and the surrounding</p>
<p>neighborhood, hoping to speak with anyone who might have heard or seen anything.</p>
<p>The first person they spoke to was Ralph, who then brought police up to speed with the</p>
<p>events of that morning, but as far as we know, he didn&rsquo;t have much else to add.</p>
<p>Investigators couldn&rsquo;t provide us more context beyond this, but I have to imagine that this</p>
<p>guy was still in shock to some degree and processing the news of his colleagues&rsquo; murders.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, Ralph was never considered a suspect, though police didn&rsquo;t say why,</p>
<p>and again, they wouldn&rsquo;t even release his real name.</p>
<p>Anyway, after Ralph, one of the other people that police talked to that day was a next</p>
<p>door neighbor named Jackie Gibson.</p>
<p>She told the officer who knocked on her door that it was technically James who was renting</p>
<p>the apartment and that he was letting John and Nancy stay there on a temporary basis</p>
<p>because money was tight, and they lived a transient lifestyle, regularly hopping from</p>
<p>one place to the next and not having any real long-term digs to call their own.</p>
<p>With that in mind, police said John and Nancy had been found on the floor, and there was</p>
<p>only one bedroom, so they very likely could have been sleeping there.</p>
<p>But police wouldn&rsquo;t say if the couple was on sleeping bags or a makeshift bed or anything</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>If that was the case, if all of them were killed as they slept, that would maybe explain</p>
<p>why Jackie never heard screams or clamoring.</p>
<p>Jackie told police that she only really knew James, and that he was always nice and more</p>
<p>than once offered up his couch and floor space to friends or colleagues that needed a place</p>
<p>to stay.</p>
<p>Jackie thought James had lived at the complex for a few years while John and Nancy had only</p>
<p>been there for a few months, and she said James, John, and Nancy were a social bunch.</p>
<p>It was a pretty regular thing for them to host card nights and open house-style get-togethers,</p>
<p>the most recent one taking place the night before.</p>
<p>Now, she said they were making some noise.</p>
<p>From what she could hear, it seemed like there was maybe two or three people there in addition</p>
<p>to the three that lived there.</p>
<p>It was kind of a late night for them, but this was a regular thing, so it didn&rsquo;t stand</p>
<p>out to her.</p>
<p>Jackie didn&rsquo;t talk as if the get-togethers annoyed her or anything, just that the walls</p>
<p>were thin enough that she knew John and his roommates liked to party.</p>
<p>But beyond the regular party noises, she didn&rsquo;t hear anything that stood out to her late that</p>
<p>night or in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>They talked to the other neighbors, too, but they all pretty much said the same story.</p>
<p>But they did pick up the extra detail that James rarely locked his door.</p>
<p>So next stop, police needed to find and interview the card party attendees.</p>
<p>But much like John and Nancy, they were thought to be transient, so tracking them down ended</p>
<p>up being a major challenge.</p>
<p>News of the murders hit the papers the following day, on January 11th, the same day of the</p>
<p>three autopsies.</p>
<p>One neighbor told a reporter for the Tampa Tribune, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All I know is he was just a nice person, a good neighbor.</p>
<p>This is very shocking,&rsquo; end quote.</p>
<p>The way information about the killings was framed in initial news reports really underscored</p>
<p>just how perplexed investigators were about the investigation.</p>
<p>According to a Tampa Bay Times story, police initially called the deaths a possible murder</p>
<p>suicide and said all three had gunshot wounds to the upper torso.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s weird is, when the autopsy findings were published the next day, on January 12th,</p>
<p>there was no indication that this was a murder-suicide, nor did anyone appear to have been shot.</p>
<p>The medical examiner at the time concluded that John died of, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;homicidal violence, including stab wounds of neck and blunt trauma to head and face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was also concluded that he died within minutes after being attacked.</p>
<p>As for James and Nancy, officials confirmed that they too died of blunt trauma, but the</p>
<p>medical examiner said the office couldn&rsquo;t release the reports since the investigation</p>
<p>was still ongoing.</p>
<p>We were only able to receive John since it was shared with us by a relative.</p>
<p>To this day, investigators remain in the dark about a possible murder weapon.</p>
<p>And Detective Pavelski told our team that there was nothing recovered from the crime</p>
<p>scene that police believed could have been used to bludgeon James, John, and Nancy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how the situation was so misconstrued at the time, but it did eventually get cleared</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>And to add to the already horrific circumstances, police shared with local media that the Spiveys</p>
<p>were parents to a toddler, though thankfully their daughter was staying elsewhere at the</p>
<p>time of the murders, and investigators confirmed she was safe.</p>
<p>By now, two days had passed since James, John, and Nancy were found.</p>
<p>And their lives in St. Petersburg were starting to come into focus.</p>
<p>According to a January 12th news story in the Tampa Tribune, other laborers who worked</p>
<p>with James, John, and Nancy liked them, at least for the most part.</p>
<p>And I say for the most part because at least a couple of these colleagues were dismissive</p>
<p>of John and Nancy, calling them street people.</p>
<p>And they stuck their noses up at the couple&rsquo;s lifestyle.</p>
<p>Other people interviewed seemed to be particularly fond of Nancy, and went on and on about her</p>
<p>solid work ethic.</p>
<p>In a Tribune article, one of the workers said she was, quote, an exceptionally good worker</p>
<p>who was often called back by customers, end quote.</p>
<p>As for James, a Tribune reporter tracked down a man named Joe Bells, who claimed to have</p>
<p>known James for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Joe talked about how James would walk up and down alleys in town, picking up discarded</p>
<p>aluminum cans that he would take to recycling centers for a quick buck.</p>
<p>Another thing said in the news story that really stood out to me is that James worked</p>
<p>really hard to hold on to as many paychecks as he could at one time.</p>
<p>He was also known to carry large amounts of cash on him.</p>
<p>Again, though, that didn&rsquo;t give police much to work with, considering they&rsquo;d ruled out</p>
<p>robbery as a motive for the killings.</p>
<p>Lastly, Joe Bells told the Tribune that James had roots in Michigan, where his family was</p>
<p>from, and that he had a daughter who lived locally.</p>
<p>As investigators pieced together more and more about the lives led by James and the</p>
<p>Spiveys, they also were starting to get a clearer understanding of the days leading</p>
<p>up to their murders.</p>
<p>Notably, in continuing to interview colleagues and acquaintances, police gathered that the</p>
<p>Spiveys didn&rsquo;t exactly have a perfect marriage and often argued, especially when there was</p>
<p>alcohol involved.</p>
<p>According to reporting from the Tampa Bay Times, on the evening of January 9th, which</p>
<p>was the last time the Spiveys were seen alive in public and the day before their bodies</p>
<p>were found in the apartment, the couple showed up to the Gale Porter Temp office to see if</p>
<p>there was any work available.</p>
<p>The same story went on to say that when they walked in around 5.30 p.m., the supervisor</p>
<p>told them that there wasn&rsquo;t any work.</p>
<p>As they turned around and walked out of the office, though, they began to argue.</p>
<p>A little later that same night, at around 8 p.m., John and Nancy stopped at a nearby</p>
<p>convenience store, which they reportedly did on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The manager who was on duty at the time told the reporter from the Tribune that the couple</p>
<p>seemed drunk and that they were fighting.</p>
<p>The manager didn&rsquo;t say what they bought, if anything, or what John and Nancy may have</p>
<p>been arguing about, though.</p>
<p>The alleged argument in the convenience store was the last time that the couple was seen</p>
<p>alive by anyone who wasn&rsquo;t at the card party later that night.</p>
<p>So, assuming for a moment that John and Nancy immediately returned to the apartment after</p>
<p>the store, that gave investigators a window from 5.30 to 11 or 11.30 p.m. in which the</p>
<p>Spiveys were definitely alive.</p>
<p>Now, we know James was at the apartment in the same window of time, but Detective Pavelski</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t account for what he may have been up to earlier that day.</p>
<p>Slowly, detectives started tracking down people who might have been at the party, or at least</p>
<p>were maybe at some card party at some point.</p>
<p>I think their circle of friends would, it seems like it would change on a regular basis</p>
<p>depending on who they met at the day labor place.</p>
<p>So that adds to the difficulty of this, too.</p>
<p>So you could have a guy show up, he&rsquo;d work for two weeks, then he&rsquo;d disappear.</p>
<p>So I think what they&rsquo;d have is every time they&rsquo;d go back, they&rsquo;d meet different people.</p>
<p>And they were very social people.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;d probably invite him back to the house and they&rsquo;d have some drinks or whatever.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to stay there the night, they&rsquo;d probably let you stay there the night.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, that makes it difficult to pin down specific people.</p>
<p>One by one, each of the card party guests were interviewed, quote unquote, exhaustively</p>
<p>according to Pavelski.</p>
<p>And ultimately, they were ruled out as suspects, though he declined to offer any level of detail</p>
<p>about their respective alibis and reasoning as to why exactly they were ruled out.</p>
<p>Any investigative means you can think of at the time that we had, they used.</p>
<p>So that would include interviewing by detectives, that would include polygraph testing.</p>
<p>So any of those means would have been used at that time.</p>
<p>One of the card party guests who was last to leave said that they left between 11 and</p>
<p>11.30 p.m. and that James, John, and Nancy were very much alive at that time.</p>
<p>This person indicated to police that the card night went off without a hitch.</p>
<p>No conflicts, no arguments, just a chill night of drinks and games.</p>
<p>So even though all of the legwork was necessary for the investigation, police were no closer</p>
<p>to figuring out what had happened in that apartment.</p>
<p>On January 24th, this is about two weeks after the murders, law enforcement announced a cash</p>
<p>reward, $2,000 for tips leading to an arrest in the triple homicide.</p>
<p>The call to action prompted several tips that investigators looked into, but police declined</p>
<p>to offer any details about those leads.</p>
<p>They just said that they were all dead ends.</p>
<p>Four more tips came in after the Crimestoppers call out, which in the grand scheme of things</p>
<p>really isn&rsquo;t much at all.</p>
<p>In a triple homicide with so many close neighbors, you&rsquo;d think a lot more people would be calling</p>
<p>in, even if all they could offer was speculation.</p>
<p>Now the detective wouldn&rsquo;t tell us what those tips were either, but he did say that investigators</p>
<p>looked closely at interactions that the three had with some other people at work, folks</p>
<p>from the temp agency that they would go out on jobs with, but there was no beef between</p>
<p>colleagues or anything like that that they could tell.</p>
<p>That was the biggest thing I think that they spoke of.</p>
<p>Just generally speaking about the interviews they had is they didn&rsquo;t seem to have a lot</p>
<p>of enemies.</p>
<p>Obviously, you know, they drank and they&rsquo;d have disagreements, that type of thing.</p>
<p>But no one specific person was really considered an enemy of them that we could find at the</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>The way those involved, again, was thoroughly vetted.</p>
<p>Anyone they even considered they had disagreements with or anything in the past, they were all</p>
<p>vetted.</p>
<p>It seems like in this 30-plus-year-old case that the beginning stages of the investigation</p>
<p>were arguably its most active, because after January 1991, activity in the case pretty</p>
<p>much fizzled.</p>
<p>Nearly two years had come and gone with pretty much no substantial progress that could be</p>
<p>accounted for.</p>
<p>But in all that time, investigators were still grasping at straws as to a motive.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s probably there&rsquo;s some type of emotional aspect to it.</p>
<p>And we just have to find the mistake that the person made.</p>
<p>And almost every case, there&rsquo;s going to be a mistake in there that we can find.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re involved in one of these homicides, it&rsquo;s an emotional thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably something you may or may not have done before.</p>
<p>A lot of cases, you&rsquo;re going to make a mistake.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the one thing that I strive to find is that mistake that you made.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I focus on.</p>
<p>But that mistake, if there was one, has yet to present itself.</p>
<p>And with each passing month, the greater community was definitely not oblivious to the lack of</p>
<p>progress in the investigation.</p>
<p>People had started to wonder if police were even still trying to solve the triple murder.</p>
<p>In December 1992, ahead of the second anniversary of James, John, and Nancy&rsquo;s murders, late</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Times columnist Elijah Gosier put into words what some people in the community</p>
<p>suspected.</p>
<p>Under the headline, All Bodies Aren&rsquo;t Created Equal, he wrote, quote, Homicide officers</p>
<p>will tell you in a minute that it doesn&rsquo;t matter whose body is on the slab at the morgue.</p>
<p>Their integrity and pride demand that they put the same effort into trying to figure</p>
<p>out who put it there, end quote.</p>
<p>But the columnist went on to write, quote, Give them a few more minutes and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you just the opposite.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll tell you that in fact, it does matter who you were, that solving your murder may</p>
<p>well depend as much on how you lived your life as on how you lost it, end quote.</p>
<p>The writer also noted that in the roughly two years since the investigation began, three</p>
<p>different detectives had been assigned to the case at one point or another.</p>
<p>Within the column, Gosier called into question the lack of attention paid to James, John,</p>
<p>and Nancy&rsquo;s case, especially compared to another much more high profile triple homicide,</p>
<p>the murders of a tourist and her two teenage daughters that happened a year and a half</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>In June 1989, the mom and her daughters were on a return cross country road trip from Disney</p>
<p>World in Orlando back to their home in Ohio.</p>
<p>After getting lost and driving in the opposite direction, they stopped in Tampa, which again</p>
<p>is part of that same greater metropolitan area as St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>During their pit stop, the mother, 36-year-old Jo Rogers, and her teenage daughters, 14-year-old</p>
<p>Christy and 17-year-old Michelle, met a man who offered them a sunset boat ride.</p>
<p>All three were sexually assaulted and weighed down with ropes and cement blocks to the bottom</p>
<p>of Tampa Bay where they drowned.</p>
<p>The man was indicted in the murders just days before Gosier&rsquo;s column ran.</p>
<p>His indictment must have been what prompted the Tampa Bay Times columnist to basically</p>
<p>write that police and local media alike cared more about the tourist triple homicide than</p>
<p>three blue-collar locals.</p>
<p>And his column struck me because the disparities in the cases do seem staggering.</p>
<p>I mean, during our research for this episode, it&rsquo;s obvious there were tons of stories</p>
<p>about the Rogers murders, but we could barely find any information about who John, Nancy,</p>
<p>and James were, let alone who killed them or why anyone would want them dead.</p>
<p>Over the course of the 1989 triple homicide investigation of the Rogers women, the FBI</p>
<p>got involved.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 tips came in.</p>
<p>3,000.</p>
<p>And it resulted in the eventual indictment, arrest, and conviction of the man responsible.</p>
<p>And let me be clear, I am beyond relieved for the outpouring of support and tips that</p>
<p>led to identifying the man who stole these women&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t really help but compare the general attention paid to these respective</p>
<p>triple homicides that happened in the same jurisdiction and investigated by the same</p>
<p>municipal police agency less than two years apart.</p>
<p>But even with this call-out and comparison, the needle on James, John, and Nancy&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>remained stagnant.</p>
<p>From 1992 to 2011, Detective Pavelski told us the case was pretty much at a standstill,</p>
<p>despite police calling it an active investigation.</p>
<p>The only development, if you can call it that, was a Crimestoppers billboard being</p>
<p>erected in the summer of 2011.</p>
<p>And that was only because the family of John Spivey approached the group about what could</p>
<p>be done to bolster the investigation&rsquo;s visibility.</p>
<p>That billboard, according to Detective Pavelski, generated zero tips, nothing.</p>
<p>When we were reporting on this episode, our team interviewed one of John Spivey&rsquo;s daughters,</p>
<p>Alana Lester, who&rsquo;s 45 now and lives with her three kids in South Carolina.</p>
<p>I should point out that Alana is not the child of John and Nancy&rsquo;s who was mentioned earlier</p>
<p>in this episode.</p>
<p>Alana is the daughter of John, but Nancy is not her mother.</p>
<p>Alana told us that she believes that, frankly, people cared less about the deaths of her</p>
<p>father as well as James and Nancy because they didn&rsquo;t have a stable home or reliable</p>
<p>jobs and didn&rsquo;t have scores of loved ones and media attention to drum up tips and investigative</p>
<p>leads.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a void there that I&rsquo;ll never be able to fill.</p>
<p>And the way that their deaths were investigated, or really were not investigated, I mean, you</p>
<p>know, to be honest, at the time, I&rsquo;m not sure what, you know, the detectives currently are</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>But as far as the detectives that were on scene at the time, that does not seem that</p>
<p>there was much effort put into investigating, you know, the crimes against my father and</p>
<p>Nancy and James.</p>
<p>It seemed like other things were more important and that they weren&rsquo;t the types of individuals</p>
<p>that warranted the time of the police on the scene is kind of how it, how it seems.</p>
<p>And that, that&rsquo;s heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Like her father, Alana was born and raised in North Carolina, where a lot of their extended</p>
<p>family remains and where John was laid to rest in a family plot.</p>
<p>At the time of his murder in 1991, Alana was young and estranged from her father and</p>
<p>she had never met him.</p>
<p>When Alana turned 16, she decided to do some research of her own to try and track him down.</p>
<p>So she wrote a letter to a distant relative that knew her father.</p>
<p>When the relative wrote back though, Alana learned that her father had been murdered</p>
<p>just two years prior.</p>
<p>To this day, Alana&rsquo;s extended family has no clue as to the possible motive behind the</p>
<p>killings.</p>
<p>But, Alana told our team that John&rsquo;s wife, Nancy, sent a letter to family several months</p>
<p>before they were killed, saying that she and John were thinking about leaving Florida</p>
<p>altogether and soon because they&rsquo;d run into some sort of trouble.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure if they had maybe gotten involved in something bad and they felt the</p>
<p>need to run.</p>
<p>I mean, he did have some possible drug offenses in his past.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know if maybe, you know, they just met up with the wrong people and were just</p>
<p>trying to, you know, move themselves out of the situation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the only thing that I, the only theory that I&rsquo;ve ever really had.</p>
<p>They definitely made someone angry.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t even really know who the actual intended target was.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that my dad was beaten a little worse.</p>
<p>Alana now has three children of her own, 19-year-old twin girls and a 12-year-old son.</p>
<p>And she made it a priority as she was raising them to ensure that they knew who their grandfather</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>I was never able to have the relationship that I wanted with him, but I had always hoped</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d be able to have an adult relationship with him and that he would be able to be in</p>
<p>my children&rsquo;s lives in ways that he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to be in mine.</p>
<p>And that has probably been the hardest part emotionally about it was, I don&rsquo;t know, I</p>
<p>guess I feel like so many circumstances took away the possibility of me ever having a relationship</p>
<p>with him.</p>
<p>Detective Pavelski was assigned this case in 2020, but he said there haven&rsquo;t been any</p>
<p>developments since that time.</p>
<p>Frankly, it&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s agreed to do this interview with us.</p>
<p>If there is a case that desperately needs our listeners&rsquo; help, it&rsquo;s this one.</p>
<p>For as much blood and potential DNA evidence that was collected from the crime scene all</p>
<p>those years ago, none of it belonged to anyone that wasn&rsquo;t James, John or Nancy.</p>
<p>Three decades is a long time, but even with the same samples being tested again in 2019,</p>
<p>the results were no more illuminating than before.</p>
<p>If you think you know anything about the January 1991 murders of James Rowe and John and Nancy</p>
<p>Spivey, or maybe you or someone you know socialized with the three or attended a card party at</p>
<p>James&rsquo; apartment, the information you provide could be the key to solving this three decades</p>
<p>old case.</p>
<p>You can reach St. Petersburg Detective Wallace Pavelski directly at 727-893-4823.</p>
