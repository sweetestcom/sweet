<p>That&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t know why I would rather you literally say like a dick and a vagina instead of private parts.</p>

<p>That will be exciting and you&rsquo;re going to go to Pennsylvania, right?</p>
<p>Yes, the Amish and the Mormon take Hometowns.</p>
<p>So, I was just thinking about how like Everyone goes home.</p>
<p>1:52</p>
<p>And I feel like, first of all, everyone&rsquo;s probably getting that like, hey, stranger text, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you go home and then all of a sudden you get hit up by like your high school guy or the college people and everyone starts coming back together.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just crazy about going home because you&rsquo;re going to go to the bar.</p>
<p>2:09</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have like your go to bar from when you were growing up there, but you&rsquo;re gonna run into someone and people, I feel like at frisky.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>2:40</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>How about work?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>No, okay.</p>
<p>So, yeah, so everyone, I hope everyone have safe travels.</p>
<p>I hope everyone smart tonight.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What time, your You&rsquo;re getting on a flight soon.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I am speaking of flight.</p>
<p>There is something that happened that Alex and I are not proud of, but it is a hack that is really going to change lives here.</p>
<p>3:02</p>
<p>So listen up Alex and I were flying to Florida and we faked a death solely to get out of a late fee, for changing a flight.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We are going to music festival.</p>
<p>And basically we, we were so dumb.</p>
<p>3:20</p>
<p>We booked the flights when we were drunk one night, and we woke up the next morning and we realized we literally booked the flight for the wrong weekend.</p>
<p>Yeah, of the festival.</p>
<p>There was no other choice but to change this fly.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I mean Airlines nowadays, it is impossible to change a flight without having to pay a ridiculous amount of fees.</p>
<p>3:40</p>
<p>Yeah, and basically, the only way that you can really get out of it fee.</p>
<p>Free is if you are deathly ill and you have like a doctor&rsquo;s, no, right.</p>
<p>Or if you have In the family, so so give it to Alex.</p>
<p>I had no clue how this was gonna pan out, but we just tried it.</p>
<p>3:58</p>
<p>We called in the lady said.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>We need two pieces of information.</p>
<p>We need the name of the individual that passed away.</p>
<p>And the funeral home that they will be having the service at and you know what?</p>
<p>Alex and I did.</p>
<p>4:14</p>
<p>We looked up the local obituary and we found the name of someone.</p>
<p>One who had recently died in Florida in Florida.</p>
<p>It lined up with the flight that we needed in terms of time in terms of time.</p>
<p>4:30</p>
<p>And I just interject and say you guys see Sofia and I look like different.</p>
<p>Like your complexion different.</p>
<p>I look different.</p>
<p>We, there&rsquo;s no way we could be related.</p>
<p>We both had to get out of this flight change.</p>
<p>So we literally said we were related and that we were cousins like what the fuck dude were like, yeah.</p>
<p>4:49</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re cousins.</p>
<p>Our grandfather died.</p>
<p>And we both have last names that are different.</p>
<p>And then our grandfather has different housing.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our grandfather.</p>
<p>And we miss him dearly like what?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>It was a stretch for sure, but they bought it, but we found the obituary.</p>
<p>The obituary happens to have the funeral home of that individual, a lot of the time, which was unbelievable.</p>
<p>5:10</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>So we call back.</p>
<p>We give them the info.</p>
<p>She says, I&rsquo;m so sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>Your flights have been changed.</p>
<p>No fees whatsoever.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>No fees go on your way.</p>
<p>All right, P Grandpa.</p>
<p>You guys might be thinking.</p>
<p>5:25</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna get shit for this.</p>
<p>You guys might be thinking, this is so fucked up without getting too depressing.</p>
<p>I just want to say, I know everyone&rsquo;s out there being like, that&rsquo;s so fucked up because I&rsquo;ve actually had a death in my family where I had to change my flight and fuck you and Bubba.</p>
<p>5:43</p>
<p>Love you Grandma.</p>
<p>My grandma just passed away this past weekend.</p>
<p>And I know goddamn well, our IP love that love that bitch.</p>
<p>She was the best woman in the game.</p>
<p>I know if she knew I needed a way to save $700.</p>
<p>5:59</p>
<p>She be like Alexandra.</p>
<p>You better put my name there.</p>
<p>You better, put my funeral home and you better rock that shit out.</p>
<p>Okay, we I like I want to call my grandma after this and be like Grandma.</p>
<p>Like how would you feel if you died and I use that to get out of a baby.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it was like this big accidental death.</p>
<p>6:15</p>
<p>Like it was his time to go.</p>
<p>He was like 98.</p>
<p>Pushing a hundred.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it was his time to go.</p>
<p>I did we send flowers to the funeral home.</p>
<p>This guy that we&rsquo;ve never met.</p>
<p>We should you not after it.</p>
<p>Sofia and I were like is this kind of fucked up that we did it&rsquo;s and Sofia and I literally sent flowers to the funeral home.</p>
<p>6:33</p>
<p>And then Loki later.</p>
<p>We were like is it kind of fucked up that we just sent flowers?</p>
<p>Is the family going to be like who the fuck is Alex and Sophia and what was this his Mistresses?</p>
<p>It was a good.</p>
<p>It was the LIE.</p>
<p>Oh my God, right?</p>
<p>Because it was like a 90 year old man, but it honestly was, the least we could do.</p>
<p>6:49</p>
<p>They, I mean, he saved us, like, $1,700 in Italy.</p>
<p>So, whatever the story is, if you guys really are endless and we don&rsquo;t condone doing this, just casually because also I&rsquo;m pretty sure the flights keep record of if you change, like your name and shit, so don&rsquo;t do this all the time, but if you are in desperate need of changing a flight, look up the local newspaper where you&rsquo;re flying and guy and Grandpa popped out.</p>
<p>7:13</p>
<p>That we yeah, okay, moving forward.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna just gonna bring up a topic that has nothing to fucking do with flights and grandparents passing away.</p>
<p>Okay, threesomes.</p>
<p>Whoo, so, the other week, Sophia and I talked about threesomes, we talked about how there can be great for relationships, but afterwards, we had a lot of people writing in asking us how the hell do my partner, and I find a third person because they expressed to us that The last thing they want to do is go for a close friend higher prostitute, higher prostitute.</p>
<p>7:51</p>
<p>The are we allowed to say that do not legal.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, that actually isn&rsquo;t a spirit from us, but just hired.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, we know people that have hired prostitutes and things went great.</p>
<p>But yeah, so people are asking like, how the hell because I get it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to always just do it.</p>
<p>Your best friend and if it&rsquo;s with your boyfriend because I can be like issues of like jealousy and shit.</p>
<p>8:10</p>
<p>So you sometimes want like yeah, Loki like a rando.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, we talked about this, and we came up with a game plan for you guys because we&rsquo;re doing the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing to help you.</p>
<p>Got a third.</p>
<p>I think the best way is to approach.</p>
<p>8:28</p>
<p>Someone in a party setting free-flowing alcohol.</p>
<p>Your walls are down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling a little frisky, looking a little here.</p>
<p>That is exactly.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s and I mean, let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>How many hookups have you had after nine a party?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just do it.</p>
<p>8:44</p>
<p>The amount of horniness that girls get when they&rsquo;re drunk and they&rsquo;re at parties, like girls.</p>
<p>We all know you&rsquo;re in the goddamn bathroom and you fall in love with every girl you start talking to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like yeah.</p>
<p>That God babe like your tits are amazing.</p>
<p>Like I love your fake tits.</p>
<p>Like let me feel them.</p>
<p>You pee in front of them.</p>
<p>8:59</p>
<p>You pull your pants down, like everyone&rsquo;s having a little orgy in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s roll.</p>
<p>Yeah, girls.</p>
<p>Yeah, become lesbians are like, you&rsquo;re so hot.</p>
<p>Like, let me see your Ted&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Like, oh my God, like let&rsquo;s just go pee in front of each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what lets me.</p>
<p>Go sometimes it gets to that level.</p>
<p>9:16</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s guys are always like what the hell do girls do in the bathroom.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re drunk.</p>
<p>Exactly that.</p>
<p>I know Canada.</p>
<p>Every Girl&rsquo;s tip.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all talking about what we&rsquo;re doing, what we&rsquo;re wearing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I think that this is really important.</p>
<p>I think the girl needs to become friends and comfortable with the girl unbefitting for.</p>
<p>9:36</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to bring in the aspect of her boyfriend.</p>
<p>If the girl and her boyfriend approach the Third.</p>
<p>Third.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so intimidating.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s so aggressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could see that being like a little too much, like, I would personally be a little intimidated.</p>
<p>9:52</p>
<p>But if I had a girl in the bathroom being like, Oh my God, you&rsquo;re so hot.</p>
<p>Like, let me see your tits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, absolutely down.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then slowly, as you guys start to, like, Vibe a little bit, and if that girls, like my boyfriend, like thinks you&rsquo;re I wanted you to my boyfriend&rsquo;s gonna think you&rsquo;re so hot and he&rsquo;s gonna love you.</p>
<p>10:07</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so much better than just right off the bat being like me, and my boyfriend thing.</p>
<p>So hot.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s absolutely.</p>
<p>So guys party setting 110.</p>
<p>And you can also kind of tell like there are certain girls that are down for it at parties or down for a good time.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re also girls, obviously, you&rsquo;ll be able to gauge.</p>
<p>10:23</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How interested they are.</p>
<p>Not within, I mean, just go to the bathroom attendants, right?</p>
<p>You are they naked by the time you&rsquo;re walking out or not.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So other ways we talked about.</p>
<p>Well, we actually, which is kind of random, but we talked about Bumble.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, your experience, I, I&rsquo;m in a sound like such a loser.</p>
<p>10:40</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even care when I first moved to New York.</p>
<p>I had no friends.</p>
<p>None of my friends really live on the east coast.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So when I moved here I was a total loner.</p>
<p>I lived in a studio by myself and I had Bumble for like a week.</p>
<p>And at first I was just going and hanging out with guys and of course, all of these guys were thinking, when are we fucking?</p>
<p>11:03</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s hook up.</p>
<p>What is this app for?</p>
<p>And I was treating it.</p>
<p>Like it was a find friends app, like I would go and hang out and be like, oh my God.</p>
<p>Homey, and like besties and like let&rsquo;s hang out, pull your fucking labia out and you&rsquo;re not gonna know.</p>
<p>11:18</p>
<p>So after like a few days of that.</p>
<p>I was like the it was it was annoying.</p>
<p>Like, you know, that feeling when, you know, a guy wants to do something and then they start getting annoyed and yeah, but I hate you you&rsquo;re Satan.</p>
<p>And I was like, I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m doing this right now, but I&rsquo;m just going to do girl seeking friend.</p>
<p>11:34</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a girl.</p>
<p>Oh and Alex when I tell you I had like three or four girls contact me saying you are so Pretty me and my boyfriend would like to meet you.</p>
<p>The Bumble.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening on Bumble, but they get a little wild.</p>
<p>11:51</p>
<p>So, and you never met any of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to confirm for your mother&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Um, but yeah, that&rsquo;s I think a perfect way.</p>
<p>Also, if they like have pictures with their boyfriend and they&rsquo;re trying to meet girls.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll kind of gauge that way.</p>
<p>Is a great way to meet people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Also, this is like reminding me of Craigslist.</p>
<p>12:08</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know in Utah, there&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>Whole section of Craigslist called back pages where you can like higher.</p>
<p>I wish you guys.</p>
<p>Could I be hearing this?</p>
<p>You can like hire girls off of there.</p>
<p>And of course, they don&rsquo;t flat out say with her on there, for what they&rsquo;ll be like masseuse or.</p>
<p>12:27</p>
<p>You know, I could let me come over and give you a masseur.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m here for a good time.</p>
<p>Not like fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Craigslist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that we&rsquo;re going to get in trouble.</p>
<p>But I know, are we allowed to say, you&rsquo;re like, okay, so I don&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going people, get a threesome.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Um, okay.</p>
<p>12:43</p>
<p>So yeah, either hire a prostitute, go on Craigslist.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m Bobble or go to a party and that ladies and gentlemen, is how you find your threesome.</p>
<p>Last point.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to just do a swinging situation and you&rsquo;d like where it&rsquo;s like couple switches with a couple.</p>
<p>12:58</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Fuck threesomes.</p>
<p>Go for the force of, right?</p>
<p>Because at that point I kind of think that&rsquo;s maybe one of the better things also for older couples.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like married and shit, just have other apples.</p>
<p>Come into the bedroom with you.</p>
<p>And then there is no jealousy because you&rsquo;re all together and Absolutely, but we also just wanted to talk about threesomes in regard to two points.</p>
<p>13:18</p>
<p>One is girls understand that if you allow your boyfriend to have a threesome with you, he met.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Look at you.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re the most Savage, girlfriend in town and everyone&rsquo;s gonna like, holy shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so lucky your girlfriend&rsquo;s down for that.</p>
<p>But Sofia, what were you saying, call?</p>
<p>13:35</p>
<p>Her, daddy is a judgment-free zone, right?</p>
<p>I just think that there is sometimes a slippery.</p>
<p>Pre slope that comes with threesomes because your they&rsquo;re hooking up with a third person.</p>
<p>And I think sometimes that can normalize right hooking up with a girl for the guy.</p>
<p>13:56</p>
<p>I mean, your boyfriend&rsquo;s dick is inside another girl and if you happen to just not be around one day and he&rsquo;s already been doing that.</p>
<p>So often with you, what makes it wrong to do it, when you&rsquo;re maybe not there.</p>
<p>I think I think that is just something to take into account.</p>
<p>That is a possibility.</p>
<p>14:11</p>
<p>It does kind of normal.</p>
<p>Fucking someone other than you absolutely.</p>
<p>Pretty much is what we&rsquo;re saying, but on the flip side, I also think like that works for a lot of marriages and you&rsquo;re able to spice it up and get some variety and the husband will never stray or do anything for sure, or the or the woman for that matter.</p>
<p>14:29</p>
<p>Absolutely girls are never in the wrong cheese as much as you can on girls.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Okay, moving on.</p>
<p>Um, I want to talk about a topic that I think is near and dear to a lot of men&rsquo;s hearts and Well, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s talk about this transition from threesomes.</p>
<p>14:46</p>
<p>Are a threesome, is every guy&rsquo;s fantasy, Every Man Has thought about it.</p>
<p>But what tops, a threesome, for a lot of guys are MILFs.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that is like guys, never shut up about Mill.</p>
<p>15:02</p>
<p>Yeah, I think obviously I think the MILFs are more of a folklore than the threesomes because I think I know a lot of people that have had threesomes, but I don&rsquo;t know that many people that have fucked MILFs and I mean the whole Lisa and thing, holy shit, my God, I for every guy that I&rsquo;ve dated, their number one was Lisa.</p>
<p>15:22</p>
<p>And yeah, every time I was like, who the fuck is this Lisa, and girl?</p>
<p>Yeah, for all of you.</p>
<p>That don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like the MILF porn star.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think she might be like the number one searched porn because because then I think MILFs are the number one search point, but overall she heard her own right?</p>
<p>15:38</p>
<p>Think my God.</p>
<p>Hey, woohoo, Isa.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>And teach us something.</p>
<p>What are we had her?</p>
<p>You would never lie, but I personally didn&rsquo;t even think she was.</p>
<p>Okay, but we&rsquo;re women.</p>
<p>But like do I don&rsquo;t even think that I, well, Alex silent and did our research or research purpose.</p>
<p>15:56</p>
<p>Our job.</p>
<p>We went and looked at her and I get it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a total MILF.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She is fucking hot.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s not my style.</p>
<p>Like we came across.</p>
<p>Kendrell us.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we both agreed that she was way more of our alley.</p>
<p>Okay, we watch TV.</p>
<p>16:13</p>
<p>Full video like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, we watch 50 minutes.</p>
<p>Kendra less.</p>
<p>We watch her three hours special.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So horn do this.</p>
<p>Anyways, so, guys, this topic.</p>
<p>I wanted to bring up because we are going to give guys a little insight into a thing.</p>
<p>16:29</p>
<p>I like to call MILF hunting, it&rsquo;s milk hunting season.</p>
<p>Baby strapped up, boys.</p>
<p>So milk hunting.</p>
<p>What is no funding.</p>
<p>Well, I think every guy always says, oh my God, my dream is to get a MILF, but I also do I think a lot of guys know it&rsquo;s not realistic.</p>
<p>16:45</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>How the fuck do I do it?</p>
<p>So like I just said I have a few friends that I&rsquo;ve had threesomes.</p>
<p>I have one specific male friend that has fucked to milt&rsquo;s one was 35.</p>
<p>One was 38 beautiful Sophia and I have looked at both of their pictures.</p>
<p>17:03</p>
<p>The one was so fucking hot.</p>
<p>Oh my god, there was a blond one that I was ready to go for mesmerized.</p>
<p>She they both have fake tits and they were down to stop.</p>
<p>Just they both have kids both have rings on their fingers.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, so I want to okay, so I want to take you guys through just a little bit about his experience because obviously Sophie and I have no experience with MILFs, although maybe one day, we&rsquo;ll be them, but I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>17:30</p>
<p>So anyways.</p>
<p>This is how he found his MILFs.</p>
<p>The first one, he found at a Barnes &amp; Noble on a Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fucking kidding.</p>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble Barnes &amp; Noble on a Saturday morning and the second one he found on Bumble.</p>
<p>17:47</p>
<p>So tell me about this Barnes &amp; Noble situation because I don&rsquo;t even know what the fuck just come out of your mouth.</p>
<p>How well think about it where we also go to Barnes?</p>
<p>And no, I know, I even know they exist.</p>
<p>I was gonna say think about places Mills to be Panera Bread Pilates.</p>
<p>Foods places like that, right Bill City.</p>
<p>18:04</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s at Barnes and Noble and he said that he was walking around hanging out and he saw this MILF and he&rsquo;s the one.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the guy that I always refer to that fucks everything and so he&rsquo;s a Savage and he knew what he wanted.</p>
<p>And so he starts making eye contact with her and she&rsquo;s reciprocating.</p>
<p>18:22</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re making eye contact a bunch.</p>
<p>Then they go to the checkout line at the same time.</p>
<p>They go to the checkout line.</p>
<p>He checks out first.</p>
<p>He walked out the door.</p>
<p>She fought like you like Whispers.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re my fetish bitch.</p>
<p>Fuck me, my car.</p>
<p>Okay, so then he&rsquo;s driving his stepdads car that day.</p>
<p>18:37</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really nice car.</p>
<p>So he parked kind of like far away in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Okay, no car around.</p>
<p>No reason for this bitch to start following him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s making his way to his car.</p>
<p>And he sees, she&rsquo;s like, five steps behind him and he&rsquo;s like, no fucking way.</p>
<p>No, fucking way.</p>
<p>18:53</p>
<p>Is this bitch literally falling me to my car.</p>
<p>So, finally, he&rsquo;s a Savage and he turns around and he looks at her and he smirks and he goes you lost and Laughs.</p>
<p>And then before she has a chance to say anything.</p>
<p>He introduces himself.</p>
<p>They start talking.</p>
<p>19:08</p>
<p>She gives him her number.</p>
<p>Okay, the next morning they meet for coffee and bagels and that night.</p>
<p>They fuck.</p>
<p>Wow, like you can&rsquo;t, you really can&rsquo;t make that shit up because I know I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it.</p>
<p>Mmm, fast forward to two weeks into them.</p>
<p>19:24</p>
<p>Fucking I had a boyfriend at the time and he was always giving me tips about what to bring into the bedroom.</p>
<p>He calls me.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, Like cooper, cooper, stop.</p>
<p>Whatever the fuck you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Cooper.</p>
<p>I need to talk to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like what?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you will never guess what.</p>
<p>My milk just said, he would call her if know anything.</p>
<p>19:41</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never guess what my milk just did.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s better than his mom next ha, ha.</p>
<p>Okay, so he&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;ll never guess what my melt is in.</p>
<p>Were like, what, what what he starts going on to explain, to me, that she just did a position that she had never seen done it.</p>
<p>He had never seen done in porn.</p>
<p>He had never had done to him and he was like, this is the hottest fucking position that&rsquo;s ever happened to me.</p>
<p>19:58</p>
<p>I just about fucking came all over her had to keep it together.</p>
<p>She pulled some move that I needed.</p>
<p>So badly to know what it was.</p>
<p>He sent me a picture and Drew it on a piece of paper and was like Cooper perform this on your man likes dick.</p>
<p>Thank you, Nurse technically, show me the picture of looking around.</p>
<p>20:16</p>
<p>I will show you later.</p>
<p>Maybe we can throw it up and call her daddy.</p>
<p>I would die.</p>
<p>So, anyways, so he this girl.</p>
<p>He said was the best fuck of his life.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>He explained it as like an animalistic, fuck.</p>
<p>This woman was insane.</p>
<p>I get that because I feel like older women are so comfortable with Bodies, they&rsquo;ve been around the block, they know what they want.</p>
<p>20:35</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not scared to be like bitch do this?</p>
<p>This and this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m going to get off.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And I think like what I aspired, that&rsquo;s gold right there.</p>
<p>So so that was one of his best stories and he fucked with her for about like, I would say almost four months.</p>
<p>20:50</p>
<p>And yeah, and he was like, he dropped all of his in age bitches.</p>
<p>I stayed with the mill for, as long as she is fucking Hill.</p>
<p>The next story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just quickly tell you guys, which is probably the most Elastic for all of you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to seek out a MILF, if you&rsquo;re hunting for Mills, you are hunting for milks this season.</p>
<p>21:07</p>
<p>Men.</p>
<p>He found her on Bumble.</p>
<p>So, for two weeks, he set his preferences to like, 35 to 42 and it took him a while.</p>
<p>Finally, he found this milk and he said it was the sketchiest way that he was fucking with his Mill.</p>
<p>So she said, do not text me.</p>
<p>And he was like, okay, what the fuck finally she called him had a place to meet up with him and then he texted her, once, I think, like, wait, what&rsquo;s the address called him again?</p>
<p>21:30</p>
<p>It was like, never.</p>
<p>Fucking text me and he&rsquo;s like, oh my God.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He said they met up one night fucked.</p>
<p>It was the best sex of his life and then literally the next morning.</p>
<p>He called her went right to voicemail.</p>
<p>She blocked his number and she unmatched with him on Bumble and he never heard from again.</p>
<p>She just you literally used him.</p>
<p>21:48</p>
<p>Used him.</p>
<p>Like I kind of love that, right?</p>
<p>I fucking aspire to be that to like fucking Savage.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this is such an interesting topic to me because never have I ever sat here and been like, oh my God, like, it&rsquo;s Dill.</p>
<p>If hunting season, let&rsquo;s go get some Daddy to fuck a dilf tonight.</p>
<p>22:06</p>
<p>No, like, I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>Like, is it really?</p>
<p>Is it just that they&rsquo;re older or is it that they have kids?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like thinking about us like the other day.</p>
<p>I was on the subway.</p>
<p>I was like, I was like staring at this guy.</p>
<p>He was hot as shit and I can, who&rsquo;s obviously older.</p>
<p>I was like IQ was reading a book and I couldn&rsquo;t see if you had a ring on, I&rsquo;m like, bending underneath the see if he has a ring on but I didn&rsquo;t care really if.</p>
<p>22:26</p>
<p>Yeah, it has kids or not.</p>
<p>I was like, it&rsquo;s just a hotter older guy like women will just say like, oh my God, like I&rsquo;m into older.</p>
<p>Guys because there&rsquo;s like older women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure older guys.</p>
<p>Know how have had more experience in know how to fuck better.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not like, but he needs to have little kids.</p>
<p>Like, does the does the fact that the woman has kids make it even hotter.</p>
<p>22:45</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what my friend said.</p>
<p>He said was so hot.</p>
<p>He was like, she would text me and be like, hey, I just put the kids to bed.</p>
<p>You can come over now and he was like, fucking her knowing that&rsquo;s so fucked up fucking her knowing that like kids were in the house was like the hottest know.</p>
<p>I could totally see that busy like ha How to keep it down.</p>
<p>23:03</p>
<p>This girl&rsquo;s being 10 times like more of a slut because our kids are in the other room, right?</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know, I guess I would love to hear of girls have ever like fucked around with dilfs and hopefully, they&rsquo;re divorced.</p>
<p>But, um, but yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s the craziest thing and not and now maybe we&rsquo;ll start deal haunting this season.</p>
<p>23:21</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Alex.</p>
<p>Moving on from dilfs and Mills Galore.</p>
<p>A lot of girls have been writing in how to get it.</p>
<p>To ask.</p>
<p>What are we?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a typical question.</p>
<p>23:36</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fucking around with a guy.</p>
<p>Even doing it for months.</p>
<p>You guys are getting really close, your hang out all the time.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re wondering, what the hell, are we in?</p>
<p>Like, where&rsquo;s this going?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I think every girl is always writing in asking, don&rsquo;t worry, ladies.</p>
<p>23:52</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Yeah, and and I think, the key thing is that the girls don&rsquo;t want to be the one to ask.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And I think in absolute, call her daddy fashion, my advice.</p>
<p>This is be sketchy.</p>
<p>Be fucking shady.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly how I do it.</p>
<p>I know the way I basically got a boyfriend, one of my first boyfriends.</p>
<p>24:11</p>
<p>I wanted to know what the fuck we were doing.</p>
<p>I my pride is too fucking big that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m not going to fucking ask, he needs to ask.</p>
<p>So what I started doing is and please do this sparingly because some girls throw this shit out way too much, but you tell him, you can&rsquo;t hang out that night.</p>
<p>24:29</p>
<p>Okay, you guys are in a consistent Groove and you can&rsquo;t hang out that And you like yours, like?</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going out, don&rsquo;t give a lot of details, next thing.</p>
<p>He knows you post some like inconspicuous little Snapchat story, and there happens to be a guy&rsquo;s arm in there.</p>
<p>And I know my guy friend literally said Cooper, it breaks guys hearts when we see the girl that were fucking, but we haven&rsquo;t wifed up and we&rsquo;re not locking down her posting a story of like, knowing she&rsquo;s with another guy.</p>
<p>24:54</p>
<p>Yeah, perfect example.</p>
<p>Okay, Alex is you&rsquo;re saying like be Shady be sketchy, but it&rsquo;s not really be shadier.</p>
<p>Be sketchy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s act single because you fucking are act.</p>
<p>According act accordingly are single because this guy has not put a label on anything.</p>
<p>25:10</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not saying you&rsquo;re serious.</p>
<p>So act that way.</p>
<p>Absolutely don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t give him the benefits of being a girlfriend when you&rsquo;re not his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Yeah, you don&rsquo;t own this pussy until you actually have been writing that you own it.</p>
<p>So factly.</p>
<p>I also think, okay, fine dropping little hints gasps.</p>
<p>25:27</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about subtle, but get the point across.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what you should do in the beginning.</p>
<p>Yeah, off the bat.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think if you&rsquo;ve been doing that for a while, if you&rsquo;ve been living the crazy single real life for a while and it&rsquo;s not affecting him and it&rsquo;s not getting to him and he&rsquo;s not freaking out and asking you what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>25:48</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of a clear sign that he doesn&rsquo;t want anything serious.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a clear scientist guys.</p>
<p>Usually when they know they know and they let you know, it&rsquo;s true, you know, it is 50 times have you know, Do you know?</p>
<p>And then you know when you know and you know, and you know this.</p>
<p>26:05</p>
<p>So, I think at that point if this guy is not making it clear what he wants.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think what is the harm in fucking asking him?</p>
<p>Oh also.</p>
<p>I just thought of a quickly another way to get him concerned is if you&rsquo;re fucking consistently and you&rsquo;re doing the whole like cuddle and sleepover thing get the fuck out of bed, one night, and like high-five and be like, yeah, I&rsquo;m going home.</p>
<p>26:24</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going out.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, wait what you like?</p>
<p>Thanks for the fuck pace.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like good day sir.</p>
<p>Good day sir.</p>
<p>Good day.</p>
<p>Tennis SE.</p>
<p>Peace out.</p>
<p>You know that definitely can fuck with a guy because guys want to be that guy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the girl doing that.</p>
<p>But what I was going to say is I think at a certain point it gets to where you&rsquo;re like, okay, fuck it.</p>
<p>26:43</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna ask and and what do you have to lose it?</p>
<p>That point nothing, you know, if he says he wants nothing, you either decide if you want to just keep fucking him because if the dick is good, you&rsquo;re going to stay in it.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re catching feelings and you don&rsquo;t want to stay, then get the fuck out and go find another.</p>
<p>Fuck buddy.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>26:59</p>
<p>I totally agree another way.</p>
<p>To make people think that you&rsquo;re being shady.</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;ve talked about who is sending that errant text.</p>
<p>Oh, they are intact.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk about because first of all, an errand text is a text.</p>
<p>27:17</p>
<p>You send pretending that that text was supposed to go to someone else.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Oh, I know exactly.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So like my forte, my forte.</p>
<p>No, you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not my forte.</p>
<p>So this guy I Talking to once the poor guy was, so not in the game.</p>
<p>27:39</p>
<p>Like he did not know how to play the game, that sometimes he played the game and didn&rsquo;t even know he was playing the game.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t the sharpest tool in the know.</p>
<p>So I wake up one morning and I have a text from him and it&rsquo;s literally, hey, babe, and then he follows it up with.</p>
<p>Hi gorgeous.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, he literally meant to send me.</p>
<p>27:57</p>
<p>Hi, babe.</p>
<p>And then some other broad.</p>
<p>Hi gorgeous, and I&rsquo;m like, hello.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s That&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like the poor guy.</p>
<p>And you know, what, all I took from?</p>
<p>That was I learned from that and I used it myself.</p>
<p>Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t even upset.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like genius.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucked up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, unbelievable, pure creative, genius again.</p>
<p>28:15</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t even know what, I never even called him out, but I was like, thank you because and I did that to a guy once and he was like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>And I like played it off, but then hangs up my asshole for the weeks to be completely transparent.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the dumbest thing you can do.</p>
<p>Absolutely, when people do that to me.</p>
<p>28:31</p>
<p>I See right fucking through.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no one accidentally sends text anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe, every once in a blue moon and few and far between, do not to call out because daddy gang, we support you always, but I just want to give some feedback.</p>
<p>I saw someone wrote in and was like, oh my God, like I fucked with him and told him that I accidentally in quotes accidentally.</p>
<p>28:52</p>
<p>I accidentally texted him and said, right?</p>
<p>I need to wash my sheets from last night.</p>
<p>That is a cool fucking, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Ange were no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too obvious way too obvious.</p>
<p>If a guy texted me that the next day, I would be so done with him.</p>
<p>29:08</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be, I would be like, I don&rsquo;t even care if fucked, I&rsquo;m upset that I would just rather you had cheated on me and fucked, then sent me something so stupid.</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m not having, I&rsquo;m not procreating with an idiot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll procreate with a cheater moving on if I can salvage.</p>
<p>29:23</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be a little bitch boy.</p>
<p>So you guys have to be yeah, you have to get creative with it and know your moments guys.</p>
<p>Shoot your shot when it&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>We always say that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t Overdo it don&rsquo;t over post his arm in your story.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t over text him.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s get into questions.</p>
<p>29:39</p>
<p>So, first question.</p>
<p>I wanted to know your thoughts on piercings on guys specifically nipple piercings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had one of my nipples pierced for like ten years.</p>
<p>Should I take it out or not?</p>
<p>I have mixed reviews from females about it.</p>
<p>So I figured, I would go to the pros.</p>
<p>29:54</p>
<p>Ha ha.</p>
<p>Keep doing your thing.</p>
<p>Well, intense hilarious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s ten years, too long.</p>
<p>I was gonna say they need to thank you for the compliment.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m going to have to tell you to rip that thing out of your fucking nipple right now.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t want a guy to rip off his shirt and have nipple piercings.</p>
<p>No, I mean again it may just be me and Sophia but I personally don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>30:13</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain type of guy that can pull it off.</p>
<p>What type of guys are ya?</p>
<p>Who I guess?</p>
<p>Lenny Kravitz could maybe help one.</p>
<p>Maybe I would like let it slide.</p>
<p>You would let us live for Lenny.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, but he&rsquo;s only one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just think that&rsquo;s not fucking hot and a lot of girls have asked us about nipple piercings.</p>
<p>30:29</p>
<p>What do you think about nipple piercings for girls?</p>
<p>I mean, I know guys, It&rsquo;s so hot.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s I personally could never do it.</p>
<p>But I hate how I just touched my till I&rsquo;m like, who&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m not going to try to do it right now.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think I could do it because I&rsquo;m so afraid of needles.</p>
<p>But I I mean, I think it&rsquo;s hot when girls have that.</p>
<p>30:48</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s a little over the top when girls are constantly now on Instagram posting with no fucking bra trying so hard to let everyone know.</p>
<p>They have their nipples pierced like psych make it.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re wearing like this super shell white cotton toddler.</p>
<p>Leave a little bit to the imagination then really when girls do that without a piercing and there are going out of their way to like show, I have a picture full fucking nips out on my Instagram.</p>
<p>31:13</p>
<p>So shut that down right now, Sophia.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s hot?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think overboard.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely if it&rsquo;s like everyday, but if you throw up one every time I get here, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, everybody strapped on for this one?</p>
<p>31:29</p>
<p>Because I think everyone can relate to this for girls at least, possibly happening, but I don&rsquo;t know a lot of people to happen to.</p>
<p>So, this girl said the worst thing of my life happened to me.</p>
<p>My boyfriend, and I were at a bar / restaurant that we frequent.</p>
<p>31:44</p>
<p>I had to pee.</p>
<p>So, he told me to take my phone and show him.</p>
<p>How wet I am.</p>
<p>We are, like rabbits.</p>
<p>We were talking dirty at the table.</p>
<p>I record myself on Snapchat because that&rsquo;s where I Usually take all my pictures / videos and I just saved them.</p>
<p>32:00</p>
<p>I posted on my story.</p>
<p>Me fingering myself in the bathroom at a restaurant.</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>Oh my God, sweaty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sweating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m cringing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m to see that is the worst possible scenario.</p>
<p>32:16</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever heard in my entire life ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speechless.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the amount of times.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what it is.</p>
<p>Snapchat camera is just better than your regular.</p>
<p>ER camera, I always take my pictures in there.</p>
<p>You always save them and then can you?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always paranoid about that exact thing same.</p>
<p>32:34</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m always like obsessive, like OCD about.</p>
<p>I, I genuinely can not even feel for you because I can&rsquo;t even imagine what would happen to be in that very moment, like props to you for handling it, like a champ and writing in and sharing it with us.</p>
<p>Thank you know what, but he&rsquo;s just it happened.</p>
<p>32:50</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point in crying over spilled milk.</p>
<p>Nope, just and I&rsquo;m sure you looked great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>You looked great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure as well.</p>
<p>Okay, tell people, they&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>Yeah, next.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hooking up with a guy for a while.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s normally pretty good and bad.</p>
<p>33:05</p>
<p>However recently, he&rsquo;s been super meanie me like telling me to suck his dick every five seconds and I&rsquo;m not really feeling the pleasure reciprocated.</p>
<p>What do you do in this situation?</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>I think the best thing to do in that situation is to just start making comments about how the sex isn&rsquo;t that.</p>
<p>33:25</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>We hold on.</p>
<p>How would you just casually drop that?</p>
<p>I would just say, just went every single time.</p>
<p>He wants to go hook up.</p>
<p>Just kind of be like, I&rsquo;m not in the mood.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just don&rsquo;t really feel like doing it.</p>
<p>And then when he asks, you just say, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not really how it used to be your.</p>
<p>33:41</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s something missing like I want to get back to how it was and fuck with his head.</p>
<p>And then, in his mind, he&rsquo;s going, like, wait, what the fuck?</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;ll probably try to please you, or you can pull a classic like little little comments like something about like, oh, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, you will you get your dick sucked all the time.</p>
<p>33:57</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really get mine.</p>
<p>Even just like in the moment if you&rsquo;re drunk or something, and he&rsquo;ll be like, oh wait, I think I think go right at it or yeah, your way Sofia I gotta I kind of like my wig because okay, why not bruised his ego a little bit.</p>
<p>I love using a good ego.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>All right, follow Sophie on this one.</p>
<p>34:14</p>
<p>Next, how bad is it to send nudes to a guy with a girlfriend?</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s really hot and asking and I&rsquo;m fucking desperate.</p>
<p>Okay, wait this I&rsquo;m not Dang.</p>
<p>It are they is he is, she like, are they fucking or know?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s literally just sending him nude.</p>
<p>34:30</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s just sending nudes to a guy with a girlfriend for what reason attention that, that is that doesn&rsquo;t sit.</p>
<p>Well with that is low self-esteem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Insecurity 101.</p>
<p>Listen girls.</p>
<p>We love our daddy gang, but we also got to be harsh when it&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>34:48</p>
<p>This is a this is a perfect example like so you&rsquo;re not fucking him.</p>
<p>So so what are you doing?</p>
<p>You literally just are Join getting attention from a guy that&rsquo;s telling you look hot.</p>
<p>When you send him nude.</p>
<p>There are so many guys out there that are single that you can be doing that too.</p>
<p>There are so many guys on the horny internet that you can be Snapchatting your fucking tits in your V2.</p>
<p>35:06</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason that you need to constantly be sending nudes to a guy with a girlfriend.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s your fetish or what, but if I were you I think that, yeah, that does come off as desperate, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s literally using you for fucking new.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you need that kind of attention like throw that shit up on Reddit attention for damage it.</p>
<p>35:25</p>
<p>So Oh, yeah, I think I want bar stools website, and you will get attention.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve never even gonna be like, shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Okay, next one.</p>
<p>This girl, invited me out to go for drinks and things were going really well.</p>
<p>So, we went back to her apartment and started talking.</p>
<p>I started to tell her how I&rsquo;ve been listening to this podcast, and she seemed intrigued.</p>
<p>35:45</p>
<p>So we listened to the Gluck Gluck episode within five minutes into the episode.</p>
<p>She starts ripping off my pants and proceeded to give me the best hat of my life.</p>
<p>Thank you, Alex.</p>
<p>And Via, FYI.</p>
