    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language and the people who contributed to that history.</p>
<p>In the last episode, we looked at how Jacob Grimm and other early linguists discovered</p>
<p>a very specific set of rules to identify the way in which ancient Indo-European words became</p>
<p>Germanic words.</p>
<p>That included a set of specific sound changes which also permit linguists to reconstruct</p>
<p>large portions of the original ancient Indo-European language.</p>
<p>In this episode, I want to focus on one specific set of sound changes which early linguists</p>
<p>used to classify the Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>And then I want to digress a bit and explore this concept of sound changes a little bit</p>
<p>further.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll see, some of the very same sound shifts that were identified within the original</p>
<p>Indo-European language are still reflected in certain aspects of modern English.</p>
<p>And specifically, we can see this same type of sound shift in the modern English letter</p>
<p>C, which is used to identify both the K sound and the S sound.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why we have a letter C at all?</p>
<p>Why not just a K or an S?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll answer that question in this episode.</p>
<p>This is the story of the Kentum versus the Satum languages, and the history of the letter</p>
<p>C.</p>
<p>The letter C is one of the more challenging aspects of English for small children learning</p>
<p>to read and write English, and for that matter, some adult speakers of other languages who</p>
<p>are trying to learn English.</p>
<p>One of the first English words that children learn to spell is cat, and very early on,</p>
<p>they associate the letter C with the K sound, and they continue that association as they</p>
<p>learn words like car, cry, cup, cow, and many, many other words.</p>
<p>But they also learn words like city and face, and especially if they&rsquo;re girls, they learn</p>
<p>to love Cinderella.</p>
<p>So they also learn to associate the letter C with the S sound, and some words like circle</p>
<p>and circus have two C&rsquo;s, one that represents the S sound and one that represents the K</p>
<p>sound.</p>
<p>So sometimes, children ask what may seem like a pretty logical question.</p>
<p>Why do we even have a letter C?</p>
<p>Why not just use a letter K or a letter S?</p>
<p>Well, if we were inventing the English language today, or at least if we were inventing the</p>
<p>alphabet today, that may make sense.</p>
<p>But of course, we&rsquo;re dealing with a language that&rsquo;s been around for a long time.</p>
<p>And an alphabet that&rsquo;s been around even longer.</p>
<p>So sometimes, we&rsquo;re stuck with these peculiar rules that are tied to the history of the</p>
<p>language and the history of the alphabet.</p>
<p>Now one quick note before I go any further into this story.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted before, this is ultimately a history podcast, not a podcast about the proper</p>
<p>use of English or a podcast about linguistics.</p>
<p>But in this episode, I&rsquo;m going to talk about one particular aspect of linguistics, a specific</p>
<p>sound change called assimilation.</p>
<p>Now I generally try to avoid technical issues related to linguistics, but I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>discussing that particular linguistic concept here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to do it in a way that it doesn&rsquo;t begin to sound like a course on linguistics.</p>
<p>And if you stick with me through this episode, I think you&rsquo;ll discover a lot about modern</p>
<p>English and specifically the reason why certain words in English are spelled and pronounced</p>
<p>the way they are.</p>
<p>The story begins where we left off in the last episode, with the comparison of Indo-European</p>
<p>languages and the attempt to reconstruct the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>Very early on, linguists noted a trend.</p>
<p>And the trend concerned the word for hundred.</p>
<p>You may recall from the last episode that the Indo-European word for hundred was reconstructed</p>
<p>as kemptum from cognates found in eight different branches of the Indo-European family tree.</p>
<p>After the original Indo-European word for hundred was reconstructed, linguists then</p>
<p>looked at the next stage in the evolution of the word, which was the earliest versions</p>
<p>of the word in the separate Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>In other words, they looked at the earliest version of the word in Sanskrit, Persian,</p>
<p>Latin, etc.</p>
<p>And at this point, they noticed a very distinct split.</p>
<p>The word had changed very early on such that there was a general split in the way the first</p>
<p>consonant was pronounced.</p>
<p>Some of the languages used a hard k as the first consonant of the word, just like the</p>
<p>original Indo-European word.</p>
<p>But other languages used an s sound for the first consonant.</p>
<p>This distinction is best represented by two of the oldest Indo-European languages we have</p>
<p>for reference.</p>
<p>In Latin, the word for hundred was kentum, spelled c-e-n-t-u-m.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the c was always pronounced as a k in Latin.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit, the word was satum, spelled s-a-t-e-m.</p>
<p>So these early linguists looked at the various words for hundred across all the Indo-European</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>And they noted that all of the Indo-European languages in which the word hundred began</p>
<p>with an s, like satum in Sanskrit, were located in the eastern part of the Indo-European speaking</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>This included eastern European languages like Baltic and Slavic, Armenian and Albanian,</p>
<p>as well as the Indo-Iranian languages in Asia, like Persian and Sanskrit.</p>
<p>These early linguists then looked at all of the Indo-European languages in which the word</p>
<p>for hundred began with a k sound, like kentum in Latin.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, all of those languages were spoken in the West.</p>
<p>These included Latin, Greek, Celtic and the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>In other words, the languages of Central and Western Europe.</p>
<p>Now if you&rsquo;re saying, hey wait, the English word hundred begins with an h sound, not a</p>
<p>k sound, remember back to the last podcast episode where we talked about Grimm&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>This was actually one of the examples I gave to illustrate a specific sound shift which</p>
<p>Grimm observed.</p>
<p>There was a later shift from the k sound to the h sound in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So the Germanic languages are actually classified as kentum languages because very early on</p>
<p>there was a k pronunciation, but the k shifted to an h at the beginning of the Germanic period.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s stop and consider all of this for a moment.</p>
<p>To the east, all of the Indo-European languages have certain words, like the word for hundred,</p>
<p>that begin with an s sound.</p>
<p>And to the west, all of the Indo-European languages have those words, like the word</p>
<p>for hundred, but there they consistently begin with a k sound like the original Indo-European</p>
<p>word did.</p>
<p>Now based upon this division, linguists concluded that there must have been a very early split</p>
<p>among the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>Soon after this initial split or division occurred, one group evolved a sound shift</p>
<p>in which the original k sound in certain words, like the word for hundred, became an s sound.</p>
<p>This process is called assimilation by linguists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also sometimes called palatalization.</p>
<p>Now this is not a podcast about linguistics, but let&rsquo;s explore the technical aspects</p>
<p>of this for a second.</p>
<p>Assimilation basically refers to a shift from one sound to a sibilant, which is a hissing</p>
<p>or hushing sound, like s or z or j or ch or sh.</p>
<p>This actually happens quite often, as we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>One quick example in English is the word assimilation itself, or for that matter, most of the words</p>
<p>that end in t-i-o-n but are pronounced shun, like revolution or abolition.</p>
<p>Most of these words come from Latin, where the ending was originally t-i-o and was pronounced</p>
<p>t-o.</p>
<p>But as these words found their way into French and eventually to English, they assimilated</p>
<p>to the shun pronunciation that we have today.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what linguists concluded must have happened when this initial division of</p>
<p>the Indo-European speakers occurred.</p>
<p>They also concluded that since this division broke down very clearly from a geographic</p>
<p>perspective, with the S-speaking Satem languages in the east and the K-speaking Kentem languages</p>
<p>in the west, then we must be looking at a general migration pattern which occurred very</p>
<p>early on.</p>
<p>The Satem speakers must have separated from the original Indo-European speakers and traveled</p>
<p>eastward carrying their Satem dialect with them.</p>
<p>Now this theory was later put to the test in the early 20th century when the Hittite</p>
<p>language in modern-day Turkey was identified as an Indo-European language and the Ticarian</p>
<p>language in northwestern China was discovered.</p>
<p>Based on some very technical aspects of the Hittite language in ancient Turkey, which</p>
<p>dates all the way back to the Old Testament of the Bible, it was concluded that Hittite</p>
<p>did not really fit neatly into either the Kentem or the Satem group.</p>
<p>Generally today it&rsquo;s placed within the Kentem group, but the modern view is that the first</p>
<p>speakers of the ancient Anatolian languages, which included Hittite, probably broke away</p>
<p>from the original Indo-Europeans before the Kentem-Satem split occurred.</p>
<p>So these ancient ancestors of the Hittites in Turkey broke away first, and then some</p>
<p>time later the early ancestors of the Satem speakers broke away and began their migrations.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other evidence to support this theory.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll see, Hittite is considered the oldest attested Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The other discovery, the Ticarian language in northwestern China, also posed some questions</p>
<p>because it was by far the easternmost discovered Indo-European language, being located in China</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>But it was not a Satem language like all of the other eastern Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>It was a Kentem language like the western languages, including the languages of western</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>This discovery surprised linguists, and it cast doubts on the validity of the traditional</p>
<p>Kentem-Satem distinction.</p>
<p>But modern linguists have accounted for this discrepancy by concluding that the early ancestors</p>
<p>of the Ticarian speakers separated from either the initial Indo-European people before the</p>
<p>Kentem-Satem split occurred, or perhaps from the Kentem group after the split with the</p>
<p>Satem speakers occurred.</p>
<p>They believe that this group of Kentem speakers then traveled eastward, separately from the</p>
<p>Satem-speaking tribes.</p>
<p>The best evidence of this theory is based upon the location where the Ticarian language</p>
<p>was discovered.</p>
<p>The area where the language was spoken in northwestern China lies along the famous Silk</p>
<p>Road, which was the traditional east-west trading route linking East Asia, Central Asia,</p>
<p>and the Middle East and Europe.</p>
<p>Linguists believe that the early ancestors of the Ticarians traveled eastward, more or</p>
<p>less along the trading routes that later evolved into the Silk Road, and eventually found themselves</p>
<p>in the territory where relics of the language were eventually discovered in the 20th century.</p>
<p>So at this point in the podcast, there are two things you should know.</p>
<p>First, the Kentem-Satem division.</p>
<p>The fact that many linguists still make a very basic division of the Indo-European languages</p>
<p>into two separate groups based upon the way the word hundred was originally pronounced</p>
<p>in those languages.</p>
<p>And this split is believed to be based upon an early split within the original Indo-European-speaking</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>Second, the assimilation of the K sound.</p>
<p>The fact that the K sound was observed shifting to an S sound within the early Indo-European</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>Again, this process was called assimilation, and this change is separate from the change</p>
<p>that Jacob Grimm observed within the Germanic languages where the K sound shifted to an</p>
<p>H sound.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s turn our attention to the modern English letter C.</p>
<p>In part, this is a story about the letter C, and why it sometimes acts as a K and sometimes</p>
<p>acts as an S.</p>
<p>But this is also a story about sound shifts, and how common they are, and how regular they</p>
<p>can be.</p>
<p>Specifically, this is a story about one particular sound shift, the assimilation, which we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already discussed.</p>
<p>This shifting of sounds to a s, or z, or j, or sh, or ch, this has happened quite often</p>
<p>throughout history.</p>
<p>And remember that English, as much as any other language, has borrowed heavily from</p>
<p>other languages.</p>
<p>We have words in our everyday speech that are brand new words, words like Google, Twitter,</p>
<p>Romance, and Podcast.</p>
<p>And we have words from the 20th century, the 19th century, 18th century, all the way back</p>
<p>to the Middle Ages, the Dark Ages, and the period before the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>We even have words that we use every day that date back to the original Indo-European speakers</p>
<p>over 4,000 years ago.</p>
<p>All of these words are mixed together in our everyday speech.</p>
<p>And many of these words have undergone tremendous changes to get to the versions we have today.</p>
<p>So this story of the letter c will help you to see how sound changes throughout history</p>
<p>affect the sometimes quirky rules we have in modern English.</p>
<p>So letter c.</p>
<p>As you know, when the letter c just appears as a c, it has two possible sounds, the k</p>
<p>sound and the s sound.</p>
<p>At this point, you might have noticed a little connection.</p>
<p>Yes, these are the same two sounds we just talked about in the kentum-satum division,</p>
<p>the k and the s sounds.</p>
<p>So you may be guessing that there&rsquo;s some assimilation going on somewhere, and you would</p>
<p>be correct.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back in time to the origin of letter c.</p>
<p>And it really starts with the Greeks.</p>
<p>As you may recall from the last episode, the Greeks borrowed the alphabet from the Phoenicians</p>
<p>who lived in and around modern-day Lebanon and Syria very early in the first millennium</p>
<p>BC.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same basic alphabet that we have today, but it&rsquo;s undergone a great deal</p>
<p>of change through the centuries.</p>
<p>The third letter of the Greek alphabet was gamma.</p>
<p>You probably heard the phrase alpha, beta, gamma.</p>
<p>What you might not know is that gamma represented the g sound, as in the name gamma.</p>
<p>So the initial Greek phonemes in the Greek alphabet were a, b, g.</p>
<p>The Greeks represented that third letter, gamma, with a symbol that looked like an upside-down</p>
<p>capital L.</p>
<p>Imagine a square, and remove the bottom and the right side of the square.</p>
<p>Just leave the top and the left side, and you have an upside-down L, which was the way</p>
<p>the Greeks wrote gamma, the third letter, which was pronounced g.</p>
<p>Now shift forward a few centuries to the Romans.</p>
<p>By the time the Romans adopted the Greek alphabet, indirectly from the Etruscans as you may recall,</p>
<p>the sound of the third letter had eventually shifted from the g sound to the k sound.</p>
<p>If you pronounce both of those sounds, you can see that they&rsquo;re both in the back of</p>
<p>the throat, and they&rsquo;re very similar.</p>
<p>Some linguists think that this sound change occurred because the Etruscans, who were the</p>
<p>intermediaries here, they took the alphabet from the Greeks, and the Romans took it from</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>And the Etruscans apparently did not distinguish the k sound and the g sound in their language.</p>
<p>So the precise nature of gamma became confused during this period.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>By the time the Romans took the alphabet from those same Etruscans, they took the third</p>
<p>letter with a k pronunciation.</p>
<p>So the Romans inherited this letter as a k-sounding letter.</p>
<p>Whereas the original Greeks often wrote their letters with chisels on stone or wood, and</p>
<p>thus had very angular letters, the Romans by this point were routinely writing with</p>
<p>ink, so they began to change the shape of many of the letters to the more rounded forms</p>
<p>we have today.</p>
<p>And they changed the shape of gamma from the upside-down letter l to the curvy letter c.</p>
<p>So the Romans had modern letter c with the k sound exclusively.</p>
<p>It was not used as an s sound at this point.</p>
<p>The Romans used the letter s for the s sound.</p>
<p>But what happened to the g sound?</p>
<p>Since gamma became letter c with a k sound, that meant that there was no letter for the</p>
<p>g sound anymore.</p>
<p>So the Romans created a new letter to represent the g sound, which became our modern letter</p>
<p>g.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the capital letter g resembles a capital letter c.</p>
<p>They made the letter g by taking the letter c and simply adding a little line at the end</p>
<p>back towards the center to create a g.</p>
<p>So the Romans had letter c, which represented the k sound, k.</p>
<p>But they had also inherited the letter k with the k sound from the original alphabet.</p>
<p>But for whatever reason, they rarely used it.</p>
<p>They preferred to use c for the k sound.</p>
<p>Letter k was largely relegated to the dustbin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you rarely see the letter k in Latin words.</p>
<p>The next step in this story is the adoption of the Roman alphabet by the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>Remember that Jacob Grimm had said that the k sound in the original Indo-European language</p>
<p>had shifted to an h sound in Germanic, like the English word hundred.</p>
<p>But also remember that not all k sounds shifted to an h sound.</p>
<p>Some of the k sounds shifted to an h and some kept their original k sound.</p>
<p>So therefore we still have k sounds in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>Now, initially, the Germanic tribes didn&rsquo;t bother with the Roman alphabet.</p>
<p>Most of the early Germanic tribes didn&rsquo;t have writing at all.</p>
<p>And when some of the tribes started to develop a system of writing,</p>
<p>they used a runic alphabet, which was a collection of runic symbols,</p>
<p>which many people think may have been indirectly linked to the Etruscans as well.</p>
<p>But the Germanic tribes, including the Anglo-Saxons, eventually adopted the Roman alphabet.</p>
<p>And this reflected the power, especially the economic power of the Romans.</p>
<p>It also reflected the growing power of the church in Europe,</p>
<p>which used Latin as the official language of the church.</p>
<p>When the Anglo-Saxons adopted the Roman alphabet into Old English,</p>
<p>the letter c was used exclusively for the k sound.</p>
<p>Remember, the Romans did have a letter k, which they rarely used.</p>
<p>So the Anglo-Saxons didn&rsquo;t even bother with it.</p>
<p>They just used the letter c.</p>
<p>For example, the Old English word for king was cuning, c-y-n-i-n-g.</p>
<p>So if we take a snapshot at this point in the late Roman period,</p>
<p>and in the period known as the Dark Ages or the Early Middle Ages,</p>
<p>the k sound was represented almost exclusively by the letter c.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons used it exclusively, and the Romans used it almost exclusively.</p>
<p>But after the fall of the Roman Empire,</p>
<p>during this period in which the early Germanic kingdoms began to emerge,</p>
<p>and the Latin language began to fracture into various regional dialects,</p>
<p>a change started to occur.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t just occur within the Latin languages or the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>It occurred throughout all of these languages.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at this point that we can introduce our friend assimilation.</p>
<p>The same sound change that occurred within the original Indo-European language</p>
<p>to create the distinction between the Kentum and Satum languages</p>
<p>occurred again at this point.</p>
<p>And as I said, it occurred within a variety of languages in Western Europe,</p>
<p>including Old English, very early French, Spanish, and Italian.</p>
<p>And these sound changes created certain confusions</p>
<p>in the way words were pronounced and spelled,</p>
<p>which is reflected in modern English.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>The assimilation didn&rsquo;t just happen randomly.</p>
<p>It happened in certain very specific ways in all of these languages.</p>
<p>And in order to understand what happened here,</p>
<p>we have to make a distinction between the various vowels.</p>
<p>Now, as you probably learned as a child,</p>
<p>we have five primary vowels, A, E, I, O, and U.</p>
<p>But linguists divide these vowels into two groups,</p>
<p>the back vowels and the front vowels.</p>
<p>This distinction is actually very important to our story.</p>
<p>The back vowels are the vowels that are pronounced in the back of the mouth,</p>
<p>A, O, and U, originally pronounced A, O, U.</p>
<p>The front vowels are those pronounced in the front of the mouth, E and I,</p>
<p>originally pronounced A and E.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why that distinction is so important.</p>
<p>The K sound is pronounced in the back of the mouth,</p>
<p>like the back vowels, A, O, and U.</p>
<p>So when the K sound preceded one of those back vowels, it stayed the same.</p>
<p>This was true throughout all of those languages.</p>
<p>But when the K sound came before a front vowel,</p>
<p>pronounced in the front of the mouth, like letters E and I,</p>
<p>then the sound tended to shift to the front of the mouth,</p>
<p>and it tended to produce a hissing or hushing sound.</p>
<p>In other words, the sound assimilated.</p>
<p>But the exact way it assimilated, in other words,</p>
<p>the precise assimilated sound that was produced,</p>
<p>varied from language to language.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with the K sound before the back vowels, A, O, and U.</p>
<p>As I said, in these cases, the K sound remained just as it was.</p>
<p>And we see that in modern English words like cat, cot, and cut.</p>
<p>All are C words where the K sound was retained,</p>
<p>before the three back vowels.</p>
<p>In fact, as a general rule in modern English,</p>
<p>when the K sound appears before an A, O, or U</p>
<p>in any words which were inherited from this period,</p>
<p>the word is still spelled with its original C,</p>
<p>and it retains its original K sound.</p>
<p>This is the general rule which goes all the way back to the Romans.</p>
<p>But notice what happens in modern English</p>
<p>when the K sound appears before the front vowels, E and I.</p>
<p>When letter C precedes an E, we get words like cell, center, certain,</p>
<p>certify, central, and cease.</p>
<p>And when the letter C precedes the other front vowel, I,</p>
<p>we get words like circle, city, circus, civil, and so on.</p>
<p>So we have the S sound.</p>
<p>So over time, people tended to move that K sound from the throat</p>
<p>to the front of the mouth when it appeared before the front vowels,</p>
<p>E and I, that are also pronounced more towards the front of the mouth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s assimilation, and that&rsquo;s what was happening</p>
<p>to many of these Western European languages.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s take a look at how this was happening in the various languages.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Latin languages.</p>
<p>In Italian, before the E and I, the K sound shifted to a CH sound, ch.</p>
<p>Remember that the ch sound is a sibilant like the S sound, z.</p>
<p>So we have that Latin word centum, meaning hundred.</p>
<p>That word became C-E-N-T-O in Italian, but it was pronounced</p>
<p>cento with a CH sound.</p>
<p>Also think about the word C-I-A-O in Italian, which is pronounced as chow.</p>
<p>So the K sound became a CH sound before the E and I in many Italian words.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at Spanish.</p>
<p>Again, we see this process of assimilation, except in Spanish,</p>
<p>the K sound became an S sound before the E and the I.</p>
<p>So the Latin word centum evolved within Spanish and became C-I-E-N-T-O,</p>
<p>which is pronounced as ciento with the S sound, except in Castilian Spanish,</p>
<p>where the sound shifted to more of a TH sound, which is another sibilant.</p>
<p>So the pronunciation in Castilian Spanish is more like ciento.</p>
<p>Old French also experienced this change, and it was basically the same as Spanish.</p>
<p>Before an E or an I, the K sound shifted to an S sound.</p>
<p>So Latin centum became C-E-N-T in French and was pronounced cent.</p>
<p>And remember, this is the same sound shift from K to S that distinguishes</p>
<p>the centum and satum languages.</p>
<p>So the same sound shift that had occurred within some of those early</p>
<p>Indo-European tribes happened here as well.</p>
<p>For another example, let&rsquo;s look at a word like cancer, which can refer</p>
<p>to either a malignant tumor or a crab, as in the horoscope sign.</p>
<p>The link between those two things comes from the crab-like appearance</p>
<p>of swollen veins extending from the tumor.</p>
<p>In Latin, the word was pronounced as canker.</p>
<p>Remember, the letter C was always pronounced as a K in Latin.</p>
<p>And we still have that version of the word in the modern English word</p>
<p>canker, as in canker sore.</p>
<p>When the Latin word cancur later evolved in French, it was pronounced</p>
<p>cancer in keeping with the French assimilation.</p>
<p>The C before the A stayed the same with a K pronunciation.</p>
<p>But the C before the E shifted to an S sound.</p>
<p>So cur became sur.</p>
<p>So within that word, we can see the assimilation at work.</p>
<p>Of course, both versions of the word passed into modern English.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the real importance of this French assimilation.</p>
<p>After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, which was after these sound</p>
<p>changes had been completed, we got the forced introduction</p>
<p>of many French words.</p>
<p>And as many of those words came into English,</p>
<p>they came in with the French S sound in place of the K sound</p>
<p>before the E and the I.</p>
<p>So in the case of the French word for hundred, C-E-N-T, pronounced cent,</p>
<p>it became anglicized to cent.</p>
<p>And it appears in a variety of words, like cent, meaning 1 100th of a dollar,</p>
<p>century, meaning 100 years, centennial, meaning the 100th anniversary,</p>
<p>centipede, a bug with supposedly 100 legs, and many other words.</p>
<p>But what about Old English itself?</p>
<p>Well, it experienced its own process of assimilation.</p>
<p>Among the Anglo-Saxons, the K sound, which, remember,</p>
<p>was represented by the letter C, became a C-H sound before an E or an I.</p>
<p>This is actually very similar to the sound change</p>
<p>we saw before in Italian, which produced words like cinto and ciao.</p>
<p>So in Old English, we have the word R-I-C-E, which meant great or wealthy.</p>
<p>But it was not pronounced like rice in modern English.</p>
<p>Instead, the C-H sound had emerged in this context,</p>
<p>and the word was pronounced riccia.</p>
<p>And this is actually the original version of the modern English word</p>
<p>rich.</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages, when the spelling became more standardized,</p>
<p>the spelling of the word was changed to R-I-C-H</p>
<p>to reflect the pronunciation of the word.</p>
<p>But more on that later.</p>
<p>So to explore this a little further, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>compare the Anglo-Saxon language with the Old Saxon language</p>
<p>of their cousins, which was still being spoken in continental Europe</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>Now remember, when the Anglo-Saxons made the migration to Britain</p>
<p>during the fifth century, it appears that most</p>
<p>of the Angles in continental Europe made this migration</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s very little record of the Angles afterwards.</p>
<p>But not all Saxons made the migration.</p>
<p>Many Saxons remained in continental Europe.</p>
<p>And so we actually begin to see a distinct difference in dialects.</p>
<p>We have the Anglo-Saxon dialect, which appears in Britain.</p>
<p>But among the Saxons who remained in continental Europe,</p>
<p>there was a separate dialect which emerged,</p>
<p>which is known as Old Saxon.</p>
<p>So I want to compare a couple of words in the Old English,</p>
<p>or Anglo-Saxon dialect, and the Old Saxon dialect.</p>
<p>And we can see how this sound change occurred in the Anglo-Saxon dialect,</p>
<p>but it did not occur within the Saxon dialect, which</p>
<p>remained in continental Europe.</p>
<p>So in the case of Old English, the word I just gave you</p>
<p>was originally spelled R-I-C-E. It&rsquo;s the original version</p>
<p>of the word rich.</p>
<p>And that word in Old Saxon, which, remember,</p>
<p>does not have the Anglo-Saxon sound shift, was spelled R-I-K-I,</p>
<p>and was pronounced as Riki, with a K sound.</p>
<p>But remember, in Old English, it was pronounced Richa.</p>
<p>So it had experienced that shift from the K sound to the C-H sound</p>
<p>in Old English.</p>
<p>And as I said, this is the original version of the modern word rich.</p>
<p>A similar word, at least in spelling, was a word which was spelled C-I-R-I-C-E.</p>
<p>So basically, that same word we just looked at,</p>
<p>but put C-I at the beginning, so C-I-R-I-C-E.</p>
<p>In Old Saxon, that word was spelled K-I-R-I-K-A,</p>
<p>and it was pronounced Karika, which again gives both of those consonants</p>
<p>the K sound.</p>
<p>But in Old English, we have the assimilation.</p>
<p>So that word becomes C-I-R-I-C-E, pronounced Charicha.</p>
<p>And Charicha is the original version of the modern word church.</p>
<p>Again, over time, that word evolved from Old English into modern English</p>
<p>as church.</p>
<p>But we see the original version there with that assimilation.</p>
<p>We also have an Old English or Anglo-Saxon word spelled C-I-L-D.</p>
<p>And the pronunciation of that word eventually</p>
<p>evolved from its original killed to chilled, which later became child.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the original spelling of the modern word child, C-I-L-D.</p>
<p>During later Middle English and then into modern English,</p>
<p>the spelling of the word C-I-L-D was changed to C-H-I-L-D</p>
<p>to reflect the change in pronunciation.</p>
<p>So even though the K sound generally shifted</p>
<p>to a C-H sound in Old English before the E and the I,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t always make that change.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually very important.</p>
<p>Sometimes the K sound was retained.</p>
<p>So in Old English, we have the word C-Y-N-I-N-G.</p>
<p>Now the letter Y has many of the same characteristics here as the letter I.</p>
<p>But we did not get a sound shift here.</p>
<p>It did not become tuning.</p>
<p>It remained cuning.</p>
<p>And cuning is the original version of the modern word king.</p>
<p>And so you still see that original spelling C-Y-N-I-N-G in Old text.</p>
<p>But again, it retained its original K sound.</p>
<p>It did not shift to a C-H.</p>
<p>Also, the original Old English version of the word keen</p>
<p>was originally spelled C-E-N-E in Old English.</p>
<p>Again, for some reason, it retained its original K sound.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s flash forward to the Middle Ages and Middle English</p>
<p>after England was invaded by the Norman French.</p>
<p>If we look at Middle English, and specifically</p>
<p>this issue of the C before the E and the I,</p>
<p>what we see is a hodgepodge of the rules that we just talked about.</p>
<p>In a lot of the native Old English words,</p>
<p>the C was being pronounced with a C-H sound</p>
<p>to reflect the assimilation which Old English had experienced.</p>
<p>So a word like R-I-C-E was being pronounced as richa.</p>
<p>But sometimes the C was still being pronounced as a K sound.</p>
<p>So that word C-Y-N-I-N-G, the original version of the word king,</p>
<p>was still being pronounced as cuting with the original K sound.</p>
<p>So in some cases that C had shifted to a C-H sound,</p>
<p>and in a few other cases it had retained its original K sound.</p>
<p>But then there were all of those words that had come in through French</p>
<p>where the C was now pronounced as an S sound under the French assimilation.</p>
<p>Words like C-E-N-T, which were being pronounced as son,</p>
<p>and eventually anglicized to cent.</p>
<p>So at that point, there were really three different pronunciations for the letter C.</p>
<p>It could have the original K sound,</p>
<p>it could have the Old English sound shift and be a C-H sound,</p>
<p>or it could have the French sound shift and be an S sound.</p>
<p>Now in everyday speech, this wasn&rsquo;t really a problem.</p>
<p>Words were just pronounced as words.</p>
<p>But for those increasing number of people who were literate,</p>
<p>and the scribes who had to write down and read those words, it was a problem.</p>
<p>If you came across an unfamiliar word where a C preceded an E or an I,</p>
<p>how did you pronounce it?</p>
<p>Was it a K sound, or a C-H sound, or an S sound?</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t know the origin of the word, and very few people did,</p>
<p>you had to guess at it.</p>
<p>So it was during this period that scribes began to adopt certain rules</p>
<p>to deal with these issues.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re basically the rules we have today.</p>
<p>Remember that at this point in history,</p>
<p>a C before a back vowel, A, O, or U, didn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>It remained a K sound, just as it had always been, and just as it remains today.</p>
<p>So we see that in words like cat, cot, cut, carry, car, cap, and so on.</p>
<p>So whenever we have a C before an A, O, or U,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at the oldest use of the C with its original K sound,</p>
<p>the same way the Romans and the original Anglo-Saxons used it.</p>
<p>So in those cases, the letter C was retained because in that context,</p>
<p>before the A, O, and U,</p>
<p>all of the languages had retained the original K pronunciation.</p>
<p>So it was clear how the C was pronounced in those cases.</p>
<p>The C was left in place, and it continued to represent the K sound.</p>
<p>But what about the C before the front vowels, E and I?</p>
<p>Well, this is where it became much more complicated in Middle English,</p>
<p>because there were three different possible pronunciations,</p>
<p>ch, k, or s.</p>
<p>Middle English attempted to sort out this hodgepodge,</p>
<p>and they did it by adopting certain spelling rules.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at those rules.</p>
<p>First, for many of the Old English words that had developed the ch pronunciation,</p>
<p>Middle English scribes assigned the letter combination ch for that sound.</p>
<p>So r-i-c-e, pronounced ri-cha, came to be spelled r-i-c-h,</p>
<p>and thus our modern English word rich.</p>
<p>The word c-i-r-i-c-e, pronounced ch-a-ri-cha,</p>
<p>was reinvented with the letter combination ch,</p>
<p>and eventually became our modern word church.</p>
<p>And the word c-i-l-d became c-h-i-l-d,</p>
<p>to reflect its pronunciation,</p>
<p>and thus became our modern English word child.</p>
<p>So the scribes were reflecting the sound change</p>
<p>which had occurred in these Old English words</p>
<p>where the k sound had shifted to the ch sound.</p>
<p>And they did it by simply spelling the words phonetically</p>
<p>using the letters c-h to reflect that ch sound.</p>
<p>So what about those words where the c had either the k sound or the s sound?</p>
<p>Well, to reflect the way those words were pronounced,</p>
<p>the Middle English scribes adopted the French rules</p>
<p>which the French scribes had been using to deal with the same issue in France.</p>
<p>This also reflects the overall power and influence of French at the time.</p>
<p>So since the French were pronouncing the c as an s sound before an e or an i,</p>
<p>the Middle English scribes went along with that rule</p>
<p>and retained the c where it was being pronounced as an s.</p>
<p>So cent retains its French spelling, c-e-n-t.</p>
<p>And the vast horde of French words that contained the letter c</p>
<p>before an e or an i were brought into English,</p>
<p>and English retained the letter c to reflect this French pronunciation of the s sound.</p>
<p>And this is still the default pronunciation rule for c in modern English.</p>
<p>A c before an e or an i is generally pronounced as an s.</p>
<p>But what about those words where Old English had retained the k sound before an e or an i?</p>
<p>Remember that a word like cuning, the original version of the word king,</p>
<p>was spelled c-y-n-i-n-g.</p>
<p>Well, remember that Old English only used the letter c.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have the letter k in Old English.</p>
<p>And the standard French rules of pronunciation would suggest</p>
<p>that if you put a c at the beginning of that word, c-y-n-i-n-g,</p>
<p>it should be pronounced as an s, but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, England was ruled by a cuning, not a cuning or tuning.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at this point that the Middle English scribes</p>
<p>resurrected the largely forgotten letter k from the dustbin.</p>
<p>Remember that the k had not been used in Old English,</p>
<p>and was rarely used by the Romans.</p>
<p>But the French had been using it.</p>
<p>In fact, the French had to deal with their own assimilation issues.</p>
<p>When the k sound switched to an s sound in French before the front vowels,</p>
<p>the French had to find a way to distinguish those words</p>
<p>from the words where the k sound was being retained.</p>
<p>So they began using the letter k to indicate the k sound before those letters.</p>
<p>So the French-influenced scribes did the same thing in Middle English.</p>
<p>They assigned the letter k in instances where a c retained its original k sound</p>
<p>before the e or the i.</p>
<p>So Old English c-y-n-i-n-g became k-i-n-g,</p>
<p>with a brand new k at the beginning.</p>
<p>Remember, the k was inserted to eliminate any confusion</p>
<p>as to the proper pronunciation.</p>
<p>So today, in Modern English, when the k sound appears before an e or an i,</p>
<p>we still typically use the letter k to make that clear.</p>
<p>So think about words like kite, king, kettle, and keg.</p>
<p>All of those words have a k at the beginning instead of a c.</p>
<p>And the reason it has that k is to make it clear to the reader</p>
<p>that those words are pronounced with a k sound.</p>
<p>Whereas if a c was inserted there,</p>
<p>the tendency would be to pronounce it with an s sound.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the k is also sometimes used before the other vowels,</p>
<p>a, o, and u, but this usually represents words</p>
<p>that have been borrowed into English from other languages,</p>
<p>especially Scandinavian languages.</p>
<p>Sometimes also words that come from other sources.</p>
<p>Think of the word kangaroo, which comes from Australian Aboriginal languages.</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<p>All you need to know about the letter c and assimilation.</p>
<p>Hopefully you find that interesting.</p>
<p>But even if you don&rsquo;t, the real point of this discussion</p>
<p>was to illustrate how common sound changes are</p>
<p>and how common certain sound changes are among various languages.</p>
<p>These sound changes often reflect mechanical aspects of speech</p>
<p>that are a product of the human mouth and vocal cords,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not necessarily unique to any particular language.</p>
<p>Again, they&rsquo;re just a product of our human biology.</p>
<p>In our next episode, we&rsquo;ll turn our attention back</p>
<p>to the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>To this point, we&rsquo;ve discussed how the original Indo-European language</p>
<p>was at least partially reconstructed.</p>
<p>In the next episode, we&rsquo;re going to look at the reconstructed language itself.</p>
<p>And based upon those reconstructed words,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll try to figure out who those original Indo-Europeans were.</p>
<p>Today, linguists are reasonably certain</p>
<p>that they know where and when these people lived.</p>
<p>And based upon the archaeological evidence,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll learn even more about them.</p>
<p>And from there, we&rsquo;ll look at how those people spread around the world,</p>
<p>and specifically how they spread into Western Europe</p>
<p>and led to the eventual creation of Greek, Latin, Celtic, and Germanic languages,</p>
<p>including, of course, English.</p>
<p>So until next time,</p>
