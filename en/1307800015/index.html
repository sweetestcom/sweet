    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This time we&rsquo;re going to look at the vast horde of Greek words which have found their</p>
<p>way into modern English.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not going to look at all the Greek words which have come into English, that would</p>
<p>probably take several episodes, but I am going to give you a heavy dose of Greek words to</p>
<p>illustrate the impact of Greek vocabulary on modern English.</p>
<p>But before I begin, let me just give you a quick update on the alphabet series which</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>I hope to have that series completed in the next couple of weeks, hopefully by the time</p>
<p>of the next episode of this podcast, and as soon as it&rsquo;s ready I&rsquo;ll probably post a mini</p>
<p>episode with specific information about the series and how you can go about getting it</p>
<p>and downloading it, so stay tuned for that.</p>
<p>Now last time we looked at Greece during the so-called Greek Dark Age and the adoption</p>
<p>of the Phoenician alphabet, which led to the spread of literacy, and with it the emergence</p>
<p>of Greece from the Illiterate Dark Age.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now near the beginning of the period of Classical Greece, the period of Greek history</p>
<p>which we all learned about in school.</p>
<p>Now even though the Greeks didn&rsquo;t have an alphabet during the Dark Age, and therefore</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have written records, they did what most ancient people did, they kept their history</p>
<p>by telling stories which passed to subsequent generations through the oral tradition.</p>
<p>And these stories were written down as soon as the Greeks had the alphabet, and as I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>mentioned in prior episodes, this included the very early versions of the Iliad and the</p>
<p>Odyssey.</p>
<p>And by the way, since it will become very important later in the story of English, I</p>
<p>should note that the Hebrews down in Canaan had also adopted the Phoenician alphabet around</p>
<p>the same time as the Greeks.</p>
<p>The Hebrews had adopted the alphabet around 900 BC, which was about a century before the</p>
<p>Greeks borrowed it.</p>
<p>And just as the Greeks used the alphabet to write down the stories which had passed in</p>
<p>their oral tradition, the Hebrews did the exact same thing.</p>
<p>At the same time that the Iliad and the Odyssey were being converted into a written form in</p>
<p>Greece, the Hebrews were documenting the stories of their oral tradition in the earliest versions</p>
<p>of the books which would make up the Hebrew Bible, or as the Christians know it, the Old</p>
<p>Testament.</p>
<p>Now, both cultures were emerging from illiteracy at the same time.</p>
<p>And last time I discussed some of the early city-states of Greece, cities like Athens</p>
<p>and Sparta and Corinth.</p>
<p>At the end of the Greek Dark Age, these Greek city-states started to emerge as powerful</p>
<p>entities.</p>
<p>These states were rivals with each other, sometimes at war, sometimes not, but they</p>
<p>were almost always in competition, whether it be economic or military or political or</p>
<p>even cultural.</p>
<p>So even though these early Greeks spoke a common language, there was no unified Greek</p>
<p>nation.</p>
<p>Now, despite the infighting, the Greeks began a tradition in 776 BC which persists to this</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>Beginning in that year, they would stop their infighting every four years for a series of</p>
<p>games at the Shrine of Zeus at Olympia, which of course we know today as the Olympics.</p>
<p>Sporting events were actually very important to the Greeks.</p>
<p>One of the most popular Olympic events was a foot race.</p>
<p>The race covered a length of about 600 feet, which was a measurement known in Greek as</p>
<p>a stadion.</p>
<p>Seats were added to the foot race location and the entire area became known as a stadion.</p>
<p>The Romans adopted the term as stadium, which we still have today in modern English.</p>
<p>By the way, even though the word stadium comes from Greek, the term arena comes from the</p>
<p>Romans, who used the term harina to refer to the portion of the amphitheater where the</p>
<p>gladiators fought.</p>
<p>The term harina meant sand.</p>
<p>And this term was used because the fighting area was covered with sand to absorb the blood</p>
<p>of the gladiators.</p>
<p>So from there we get the word arena.</p>
<p>Now the Greeks believed that athletes performed at their best when they were nude.</p>
<p>And the Greek word for naked was gymnos.</p>
<p>And to compete in the nude was gymnasium, which is the basis of the English word gymnasium.</p>
<p>Its shortened form in modern English is gym, and of course the word gymnastics also comes</p>
<p>from the same root word.</p>
<p>The Greeks also invented the pentathlon, which was a competition involving five separate</p>
<p>events, running, jumping, wrestling, discus, and javelin.</p>
<p>In addition to the Olympics, the Greeks often held other public celebrations or events featuring</p>
<p>athletic contests.</p>
<p>And this type of celebration was called an agon.</p>
<p>The actual athletic events were called agonia.</p>
<p>And since most participants experienced defeat, the term came to refer to a difficult struggle</p>
<p>or other emotional experience associated with defeat.</p>
<p>The term came into English as agony to refer to a mental or physical struggle.</p>
<p>So when ABC&rsquo;s Wide World of Sports used the term agony of defeat, they were actually using</p>
<p>the term consistent with its original Greek meaning.</p>
<p>Greek agon is also the root of the word antagonize, by the way.</p>
<p>Another use of this root word appears in literature, especially in plays.</p>
<p>In a play, the various roles or characters were considered part of the conflict represented</p>
<p>in the plot or story, similar to competitors in a sports field or in battle.</p>
<p>The Greek prefix protos was used to identify the primary character, and that term protos</p>
<p>meant primary, and it was combined with the term agonia, meaning conflict, and the resulting</p>
<p>word became protagonist, which meant primary character.</p>
<p>An adversary or opponent was identified with the term anti, therefore anti and agonia became</p>
<p>the word antagonist.</p>
<p>Now this period also saw the Greeks establish colonies throughout the Mediterranean, especially</p>
<p>the northern Mediterranean and eastward into the Black Sea region.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of settlements which we know today as Marseilles, Nice, Naples</p>
<p>and Monaco.</p>
<p>It was also the beginnings of Byzantium, which later became Constantinople and is known</p>
<p>today as Istanbul.</p>
<p>Socrates would later say the Greeks lived around the Mediterranean like frogs around</p>
<p>a pond.</p>
<p>This expansion of Greek influence, language and culture will become very important in</p>
<p>the next episode when we look at the early Latin speakers and the Etruscans in Italy,</p>
<p>but more on that next time.</p>
<p>As the Greeks encountered peoples from other lands, they tended to look down on those people</p>
<p>as uncivilized.</p>
<p>This was another tendency which would eventually extend to the Romans a few centuries later.</p>
<p>The Greeks coined the term barbarian to refer to the uncivilized peoples who lived outside</p>
<p>of Greece.</p>
<p>Some historians believe that the word comes from a Greek imitation of non-Greek languages,</p>
<p>something like barbar or ba-ba-ba.</p>
<p>The Romans picked up this word and the notion behind it as well.</p>
<p>While it isn&rsquo;t entirely clear if the term barbarian had all the negative connotations</p>
<p>which it has today, it may have originally simply meant foreigner, but it soon came to</p>
<p>mean a savage or uncivilized person.</p>
<p>In the 7th century BC, many of the ruling families which had ruled the various city-states</p>
<p>of Greece were overthrown and were replaced by new rulers who were called tyrannoi.</p>
<p>Typically this term merely meant ruler who achieved power by a means other than inheritance</p>
<p>or constitutional succession.</p>
<p>So typically it meant a ruler who achieved power by coup.</p>
<p>The term has come down to us in modern English as tyrant, and it&rsquo;s also the root of the word</p>
<p>tyranny.</p>
<p>Initially, again, it didn&rsquo;t have the negative connotation that it would have later.</p>
<p>It was really after Alexander the Great, many centuries later, that the term would come</p>
<p>to be used as a negative or pejorative term.</p>
<p>But in the early 6th century BC, the city-state of Athens began to introduce a series of political</p>
<p>reforms.</p>
<p>And Athens began to reject rule by tyrants and began to move to an early form of democratic</p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>The city was divided into territories, and each territory was based on an older territorial</p>
<p>division called a demi.</p>
<p>And these regions were sort of like wards in modern cities.</p>
<p>Each demi elected a certain number of members to a new representative assembly.</p>
<p>And the Athenians coined the term democratia, which literally meant rule of the people.</p>
<p>And this is the basis of not only a new form of government, but also words like democracy</p>
<p>and democratic.</p>
<p>The 6th century BC also saw the rise of the great Persian Empire to the east.</p>
<p>By the way, remember that the Persian civilization, like the Greek civilization, spoke an Indo-European</p>
<p>language, and both were descended, at least linguistically, from common Indo-European</p>
<p>roots.</p>
<p>The Persian Empire had spread westward from modern-day Iran and had conquered Anatolia</p>
<p>and most of the Near East.</p>
<p>They now set their sights on Greece.</p>
<p>And by 513 BC, the Persians had moved into Europe in the Balkans.</p>
<p>So they were now sitting just to the north of Greece.</p>
<p>They had also moved into the Greek territories in western Anatolia.</p>
<p>And in 490 BC, the Persians landed at the city of Marathon, about twenty-five miles</p>
<p>north of Athens.</p>
<p>And the Athenians were far outnumbered by the Persians.</p>
<p>And when they sent a request to Sparta for help, Sparta refused, because they were in</p>
<p>the middle of a religious festival which prohibited warfare.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, and some would say miraculously, the outnumbered Athenians defeated the Persians</p>
<p>at the Battle of Marathon.</p>
<p>And according to Greek legend, the messenger Pheidippides was chosen to carry the news</p>
<p>of the victory back to Athens.</p>
<p>He made the twenty-five mile trek without stopping, and as soon as he reached the walls</p>
<p>of the Acropolis, he cried out, Rejoice!</p>
<p>We conquer!</p>
<p>And then he fell dead to the ground.</p>
<p>Well, whether or not the story is literally true, when the Olympic Games were revived</p>
<p>in Athens in 1896, there was a recreation of the purported Marathon victory run, which</p>
<p>became the basis of the modern word Marathon.</p>
<p>The length of a Marathon is roughly the same as the distance Pheidippides ran to deliver</p>
<p>his message of victory to Athens.</p>
<p>Now though the Athenians celebrated the victory of Marathon, the Persians were not deterred</p>
<p>for very long.</p>
<p>A decade later they invaded again, and for the first time we see the rival Greek city-states</p>
<p>join together to repeal a common enemy.</p>
<p>This time the Spartans joined the effort, and a group of about three hundred Spartan</p>
<p>soldiers held off tens of thousands of invading Persians at a narrow pass near Thermopylae.</p>
<p>This is documented in the recent motion picture, Three Hundred, and it is a great story of</p>
<p>Greek heroism.</p>
<p>But the Persians eventually found a way around the pass, and then they surrounded and killed</p>
<p>the Spartans, and they proceeded to sack Athens.</p>
<p>But Persian victory was fleeting.</p>
<p>The Greeks rallied to secure victories against the Persians, and the Persians were again</p>
<p>forced to withdraw.</p>
<p>One of the last major victories in this second war against the Persians was at Plataea, and</p>
<p>after this victory there were rumors that the Persians had hidden a huge amount of treasure</p>
<p>at the battlefield.</p>
<p>The Greek leader asked the oracle at Delphi what they should do about that, and the oracle</p>
<p>told him to, quote, leave no stone unturned.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what the Greeks did, and sure enough they found the treasure, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the basis of the saying, leave no stone unturned.</p>
<p>And for the next few decades the Greek city-states formed an alliance with each other against</p>
<p>foreign threats, and Athens came to dominate that alliance, and it eventually led to an</p>
<p>Athenian empire.</p>
<p>The powerful Athenian leader at the time was Pericles, and he was what the Greeks called</p>
<p>a strategos, which meant a general or military leader.</p>
<p>And from this word we get words like strategy and strategic, which describes the type of</p>
<p>actions or plans formulated by military leaders.</p>
<p>And this was the time that&rsquo;s come to be known as the Golden Age of Greece.</p>
<p>Athens itself became very wealthy, Athenian arts and culture flourished, and the Greeks</p>
<p>flocked to Athens as the cultural center of Greece.</p>
<p>And Sparta came to resent Athenian control over the Greek alliance, and by 431 B.C. the</p>
<p>Greek city-states were once again at war with each other in the Peloponnesian War, which</p>
<p>was primarily a war between Athens and Sparta for control of Greece.</p>
<p>And this was a protracted war which lasted over twenty-five years.</p>
<p>Sparta was known for its powerful land army, and Athens was known for its powerful navy,</p>
<p>and each side traded victories for many years.</p>
<p>In battle a Greek army would surrender to an opposing army by waving an olive branch,</p>
<p>and this was equivalent to the later waving of a white flag, and this is the basis of</p>
<p>the modern term, wave an olive branch, to mean surrender.</p>
<p>Now during the Peloponnesian War, democracy was temporarily abolished in Athens.</p>
<p>The city also experienced a plague which killed many of its citizens.</p>
<p>And meanwhile the Spartans built up their own navy, and after securing several important</p>
<p>victories against Athens, Sparta finally emerged victorious in the Peloponnesian War.</p>
<p>But Spartan control was tenuous, and for the next few decades internal quarrels continued.</p>
<p>And amidst all the infighting and warfare, the military and political power of the Greeks</p>
<p>began to decline relative to their neighbors.</p>
<p>To the north, the Macedonian territory began to amass a tremendous amount of power.</p>
<p>And Macedonia was heavily influenced by Greek culture, but they didn&rsquo;t speak Greek, and</p>
<p>the Greeks considered them semi-barbarians.</p>
<p>But under the leadership of Philip II, the Macedonians soon began to eclipse the power</p>
<p>of Athens and Sparta.</p>
<p>The Greek states finally formed an alliance against Philip, called the Hellenic League,</p>
<p>but it was too little too late.</p>
<p>In 338 BC, Philip invaded and the Greek alliance fell to the Macedonians.</p>
<p>In the wake of the defeat, the Greek city-states finally coalesced into a single unified political</p>
<p>entity under Macedonian control.</p>
<p>Now Macedonian military power was combined with Athenian naval power and the Spartan</p>
<p>army.</p>
<p>The power of a unified Greece under Macedonian rule was so great that the son of Philip II,</p>
<p>Alexander, defeated the Persian Empire once and for all, and he took control of the entire</p>
<p>landmass of the Persian Empire, including Egypt, and he extended the new Greek Empire</p>
<p>all the way to India.</p>
<p>Alexander, or as he would later become known to history, Alexander the Great, was a very</p>
<p>young man at the time he conquered the Persian Empire.</p>
<p>He was only 17, and consequently he had a tutor.</p>
<p>His tutor&rsquo;s name was Aristotle.</p>
<p>Aristotle&rsquo;s mentor was a man named Plato, and Plato&rsquo;s mentor was a man named Socrates.</p>
<p>What a small world it was for the Greeks.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an overview of the political history of the classical Greek period.</p>
<p>It was a period of rivalry and warfare, but it is the cultural history of this period</p>
<p>of Greece that we remember most, because it was the culture of this period of Greece</p>
<p>which heavily influenced the Romans, and ultimately influenced the entirety of Western civilization,</p>
<p>and as a result, heavily influenced the English language.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at that culture.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in a previous episode, the Greeks are responsible for disciplines such</p>
<p>as philosophy, poetry, music, and drama, and all of those words come from Greek origins.</p>
<p>And since this is a history podcast, I should note that the word history also originated</p>
<p>in Greece.</p>
<p>And since I spend quite a bit of time talking about etymology, or the history and development</p>
<p>of specific words, I should note that etymology is also a Greek word.</p>
<p>Etymos meant true, and logos meant word, so etymology meant the study of the true nature</p>
<p>of a word.</p>
<p>For the Greeks, learning and the study of the world around them was incredibly important.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s amazing the contribution the Greeks made to learning, given that they would</p>
<p>have probably considered their own Indo-European ancestors a few centuries earlier to be barbarians.</p>
<p>But Western civilization as we know it would not exist without the contribution of these</p>
<p>ancient Greeks.</p>
<p>In Greek, a Philosophos meant a lover of wisdom.</p>
<p>The first person to call himself a Philosophos was Pythagoras, who lived in the 6th century</p>
<p>B.C.</p>
<p>The study of the Philosophos was philosophy.</p>
<p>Initially it emphasized astronomy, geometry, and mathematics, again, all Greek words.</p>
<p>Of course, Pythagoras was famous for his Pythagorean theorem in geometry, but despite its original</p>
<p>emphasis on math and science, philosophy evolved into a much broader range of thought and discourse.</p>
<p>It came to represent Greek thought in general.</p>
<p>By the 5th century B.C. into the 4th century B.C., a series of Philosophers and students—Socrates,</p>
<p>his student Plato, and his student Aristotle—they all revolutionized and expanded Greek philosophy,</p>
<p>and they laid the groundwork for much of the philosophical thought of the Western world.</p>
<p>Plato founded a school in Athens called the Academy, and from the name of that school</p>
<p>we get academy and academic.</p>
<p>From Plato&rsquo;s writings we get words such as analogy, enthusiasm, mathematical, synthesis,</p>
<p>and system.</p>
<p>He also redefined and expanded the meaning of terms such as method, musical, philosopher,</p>
<p>theory, type, irony, idea, and ideal.</p>
<p>Words which are attributed to Aristotle include analytic, energy, ethics, philosophy, and</p>
<p>synonym.</p>
<p>Other words which owe much of their modern meaning to Aristotle include category, mechanics,</p>
<p>organic, physics, and synthesis.</p>
<p>The term metaphysics comes from the fact that Aristotle treated the subject after, which</p>
<p>in Greek was called meta, his treaty on physics, so after physics was metaphysics.</p>
<p>Also from Aristotle we get an emphasis on the measurable world, a world in which things</p>
<p>can be measured, examined, and compared.</p>
<p>The Romans were intrigued by the practical, real-world application of Aristotle&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>and they translated many of his words into Latin.</p>
<p>From Latin we get words from Aristotle such as absolute, actual, definition, equivocal,</p>
<p>instance, moral, potential, subject, substance, and virtual.</p>
<p>The broad range of words which come to us from early Greek thought and philosophy is</p>
<p>actually pretty amazing.</p>
<p>In addition to the words I just mentioned, Greek philosophy produced musical terms, literary</p>
<p>terms, science terms, as well as many other terms, so let&rsquo;s break that down and look at</p>
<p>some of those words.</p>
<p>Grammatical terms from Greek include words like music, musical, musician, chord, chorus,</p>
<p>harmony, melody, rhythm, tone, and symphony.</p>
<p>Literary terms include words like metaphor, rhetoric, hyperbole, glossary, poetry, and</p>
<p>poetic.</p>
<p>Most of our grammatical terms come from Greek, including grammar and grammatical, adjective,</p>
<p>case, gender, noun, and verb, all from Greek.</p>
<p>The first theater in Athens was built around 550 BC, and not surprisingly we get lots of</p>
<p>words related to plays and performances from Greek.</p>
<p>These words include theater, theatrical, drama, dramatic, comedy, tragedy, catastrophe, episode,</p>
<p>and prologue.</p>
<p>And earlier I mentioned words like protagonist and antagonist.</p>
<p>We can even thank Socrates for the modern English term swan song to describe the last</p>
<p>portion of a performance.</p>
<p>The Greeks, together with other ancient peoples, felt that swans did not generally sing well</p>
<p>except in anticipation of death.</p>
<p>And Socrates said that this represented the swans rejoicing in the face of death because</p>
<p>they knew that they were sacred to Apollo, who was the god of music and song, and that</p>
<p>at death the swans knew they would return to him.</p>
<p>And so this is the basis of the phrase swan song, which was once used to refer to a final</p>
<p>song or performance, but has since been expanded somewhat in modern usage to describe any kind</p>
<p>of final act or event.</p>
<p>And of course, the entire study of science owes an incredible debt to the early Greeks.</p>
<p>Science itself was another outgrowth of Greek philosophy.</p>
<p>The Greeks looked for natural explanations for the world around them rather than relying</p>
<p>upon supernatural explanations.</p>
<p>Plato had helped to develop the concept of deductive reasoning, and many historians consider</p>
<p>Aristotle the inventor of the scientific method, even though many people before and after him</p>
<p>contributed to the method.</p>
<p>The scientific revolution began in earnest in the Middle Ages in Europe, and because</p>
<p>of the important role played by those early Greeks in the development of science, scientists</p>
<p>during the Middle Ages began a tradition of using Greek terms for scientific concepts</p>
<p>which were being developed.</p>
<p>As a result, most of the scientific terms which we have borrowed from Greek began to</p>
<p>appear in the language during and after the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>In the 13th century we get words like astronomy, arithmetic, eclipse, comet, and cosmos.</p>
<p>In the 14th century we get words like problem, philosophy, geometry, rhetoric, logic, astrology,</p>
<p>element, essence, quality, hemisphere, and cycle.</p>
<p>In the 15th century we get words like method and physical.</p>
<p>And in the 16th century we get words like anatomy, geography, physics, mathematics,</p>
<p>pharmacy, idea, method, theorem, theory, hypothesis, phenomenon, species, energy, vacuum, metamorphosis,</p>
<p>anthropology, and syndrome.</p>
<p>And in the 17th century we get words like diagram, system, botanical, psychology, atmosphere,</p>
<p>geocentric.</p>
<p>And in the 19th century we get words like biology, cardiology, ecology, geothermal,</p>
<p>helium, and hypnosis.</p>
<p>I mentioned that the term astronomy came into English from ultimate Greek origins in the</p>
<p>13th century.</p>
<p>Like many of those words, it gets to us from Greek to Latin to French and then to English.</p>
<p>The root of this word is astro, which comes from the Greek word aster, which meant star.</p>
<p>I mentioned in the last episode that the word asterisk comes from Greek, from the Greek</p>
<p>word asteriskos, which meant little star.</p>
<p>And aster resulted in astro, which resulted in many English words like astronomy, astrology,</p>
<p>astrophysics, and astronaut, just to name a few.</p>
<p>And speaking of Greek astronomy, during the time of the ancient Greeks, the star Sirius,</p>
<p>which was the brightest star in the night sky, it rose just before or at the same time</p>
<p>as the sun in the summer months.</p>
<p>And the Greek word sirios meant burning or scorching.</p>
<p>And the Greeks used that word to describe the star which we know today as Sirius because</p>
<p>it appeared in the summer months near the sun.</p>
<p>And with regard to the constellations, the Greeks consider the star to be the dog associated</p>
<p>with the hunter Orion.</p>
<p>And the Romans borrowed the notion of Sirius as the dog star, and because the dog star</p>
<p>rose at or just before the rising of the sun during the summer months, those hot months</p>
<p>became known as the dog days.</p>
<p>And of course we still refer to the dog days of summer, so Sirius, dog star, and dog days</p>
<p>are all interconnected and all relate back to early Greek astronomy.</p>
<p>Now closely connected to the general science terms I mentioned earlier are medical terms.</p>
<p>The study of medicine also evolved out of Greek philosophy and the later scientific</p>
<p>revolution.</p>
<p>It relied upon the analytical method of thought inherent in Greek philosophy, and Aristotle</p>
<p>was the first person to use the word anatomy in its medical sense.</p>
<p>The Greeks dissected bodies and studied them, and Hippocrates was a physician from Athens.</p>
<p>Of course we associate Hippocrates with the Hippocratic Oath today.</p>
<p>Among the words which Hippocrates coined are arthritis, diarrhea, dysentery, epidemic,</p>
<p>hemorrhage, hypochondriac, and hysteria.</p>
<p>Hippocrates also used the word crisis to represent the crucial turning point of a disease.</p>
<p>Modern medical scientists still tend to use Greek terms for modern medical advancements.</p>
<p>Now before we move on, I should mention a few other modern English words which originated</p>
<p>from Greek philosophy and learning.</p>
<p>These include words like school, scholastic, logic, analogy, technique, critic, individual,</p>
<p>question, economics, and pyramid.</p>
<p>In addition to full words which were borrowed from Greek, English regularly uses Greek roots</p>
<p>to create new words.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just look at a few common root words in modern English.</p>
<p>The Greek word bios meant life, and from that root we get lots of words in modern English.</p>
<p>Words like biology, biography, biochemistry, biophysics, biopsy, bionics, biodegradable,</p>
<p>and on and on and on.</p>
<p>The word gaster meant stomach in Greek, and we get words like gastric and gastronomy from</p>
<p>that root.</p>
<p>Derma meant skin, so we get words like dermatology from that root.</p>
<p>Kallos meant beauty, and from there we get a word like calligraphy.</p>
<p>Pous meant foot, and gave us words like tripod and podiatry.</p>
<p>The word rhinos meant nose, and from that we get words like rhinoceros and rhinoplasty.</p>
<p>Hydor meant water, and we get all the hydro words from Greek, so hydroplane, hydrogen</p>
<p>come from Greek.</p>
<p>Chroma meant color, so it produced words like chromatic and polychrome, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Altos meant self, so most of the words in English that begin with auto come from Greek,</p>
<p>or at least from that Greek root.</p>
<p>So words like autonomy, automatic, automobile, automobile because you didn&rsquo;t need a horse</p>
<p>to pull it, it could actually operate on its own, so it was an automobile.</p>
<p>Thermos meant hot, so we get words like thermometer and thermal from Greek.</p>
<p>Macros meant large, so it gave us words like macrocosm and macroeconomics.</p>
<p>Of course, micros meant small, and it produced all the micro words we have, microscope, microbe,</p>
<p>microchip, microwave.</p>
<p>Monos meant single, or one, and produced all the mono words, I say all the mono words,</p>
<p>it produced most of them, so words like monologue, monolithic, monopoly, monarchy.</p>
<p>Homos meant same, so it gave us words like homogenous and homonym.</p>
<p>Polis meant many, so we get polygamy, polygraph, polytheism.</p>
<p>Protos meant first, and it gave us words like prototype, protocol, and in linguistics,</p>
<p>the very earliest version of a language is usually called the proto-language, so we call</p>
<p>the original Indo-European language the proto-Indo-European language, so we see that in linguistic use</p>
<p>as well as general common English use.</p>
<p>The word dio or dis meant two in Greek, and gave us words like diurnal, dioxide, and dichotomy.</p>
<p>Penta meant five, and gave us words like pentagon and pentagram.</p>
<p>Athlon meant contest, and gave us all those athletic events that end with athlon, like</p>
<p>triathlon and decathlon.</p>
<p>Lagos meant writing, speech, or study, and so almost all the words in English that end</p>
<p>in ology are rooted in that Greek word, so words like biology, sociology, trilogy, technology,</p>
<p>all those words.</p>
<p>Metron meant measure, and so most English words that end in meter are traced back to</p>
<p>original Greek origins, so words like barometer, speedometer, meter, centimeter, kilometer,</p>
<p>even metric, all come from that root.</p>
<p>Anta meant opposite, so again, most English words that begin with anti can be traced back</p>
<p>to this Greek root, so words like antibiotic, antimatter, antidote, antiseptic, antifreeze, antithesis.</p>
<p>Dia meant through or across, and that gives us words like diameter, diagonal, diagram, and dialogue.</p>
<p>Para meant beside, or against, or almost, and gave us lots of words, words like parallel,</p>
<p>paramatic, parasite, and paraphrase.</p>
<p>And hyper meant above, or over, or excessive, and gave us words like hyper-extend, hyper-drive,</p>
<p>hyperactive, hyperbole, and hyperventilate.</p>
<p>So these are just a few Greek roots which can be found throughout English, and I think</p>
<p>you can start to see how Greek permeates modern English.</p>
<p>Now as I said earlier, almost all of the words I&rsquo;ve mentioned in this episode came</p>
<p>into English during the periods of Middle English and Modern English.</p>
<p>They primarily represent words taken from Latin or French with Greek origins.</p>
<p>But there is at least one very old Greek word which has found its way from Greek directly</p>
<p>into the original Germanic languages before the Anglo-Saxons migrated to Britain.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s a Greek word from the original Anglo-Saxon language which came into</p>
<p>English without coming through Latin.</p>
<p>And that makes the word one of the oldest Greek words in the English language.</p>
<p>And that word is church.</p>
<p>And a closer look at that word allows us to begin a transition from the Greeks to the</p>
<p>Romans, the Germanic tribes, and the Celtic people of Europe.</p>
<p>I mentioned the word church in an earlier episode about the history of the letter C.</p>
<p>The original Greek word was Kyriakos.</p>
<p>And that word passed from Greek to the Gothic Germanic tribes who had migrated into the</p>
<p>Balkan region around the 2nd century AD.</p>
<p>And Christian missionary work with the Goths in the 4th century led to the adoption of</p>
<p>the Greek word and the expansion of the word northward throughout the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>The Old Saxons in continental Europe had the word as karyka, but remember that Old English</p>
<p>had experienced an assimilation of the k sound.</p>
<p>Remember all that?</p>
<p>Well, the k sound had become a ch sound in Old English.</p>
<p>So karyka became chariche in Old English.</p>
<p>And from that we eventually get the modern English word church.</p>
<p>But the bigger point here is the role that Greek played in the expansion of the early</p>
<p>Christian church into Europe.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s conclude our look at the Greeks by exploring what happened.</p>
<p>You may recall from the last episode that the Phoenicians had been a very important</p>
<p>player in the Mediterranean and their alphabet was adopted by the Greeks, the Hebrews, and</p>
<p>others which resulted in the first real widespread expansion of literacy in the ancient world.</p>
<p>But the tiny Phoenician homeland came under attack from rising regional powers.</p>
<p>The Babylonians overran the Phoenician cities in the 6th century BC and then the Persian</p>
<p>empire conquered the territory.</p>
<p>A couple of centuries later, the Greeks under Alexander the Great took control of the region.</p>
<p>And after the establishment of the Greek empire under Alexander, the Greek language began</p>
<p>to emerge as the dominant lingua franca of the region.</p>
<p>It was the language of the ruling classes, of arts, and literature, and this was an extension</p>
<p>of a process that had begun even earlier.</p>
<p>Whereas the Phoenicians were really only interested in trade, the Greeks established colonies</p>
<p>and settlements around the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And with those fixed settlements, the Greek language took hold.</p>
<p>And it had been spoken throughout the region for centuries.</p>
<p>And Alexander&rsquo;s conquest made Greek even more prominent in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the wake of the attacks on the Phoenician city-states, the Phoenician language</p>
<p>died out in the eastern Mediterranean in the 1st century BC.</p>
<p>Now a closely related Semitic language called Aramaic took its place as the dominant native</p>
<p>language in the region.</p>
<p>Aramaic was the local language spoken during the time of Christ.</p>
<p>But even though Aramaic remained a local vernacular, Greek had already become entrenched as the</p>
<p>dominant lingua franca of the region.</p>
<p>And it was being spoken throughout the vast territory which had been conquered by Alexander.</p>
<p>So that included the Near East, the Black Sea region, and southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>But shortly after the Greek empire was established under Alexander, the Romans swept through</p>
<p>and conquered the same region.</p>
<p>And the arrival of the Romans actually led to the expansion of the Greek language.</p>
<p>First, Italy soon received an influx of educated Greeks.</p>
<p>Many of these Greeks sought employment by the Roman Empire, and Greek influences began</p>
<p>to spread into Roman higher learning.</p>
<p>The Romans began to be heavily influenced by this Greek culture and Greek learning.</p>
<p>And as I have repeatedly discussed, Greek words spread into Latin before they eventually</p>
<p>passed into English.</p>
<p>But back in the eastern Mediterranean, Greek was firmly entrenched by this point.</p>
<p>Even after Greece was conquered by the Roman Empire, the Greek language remained as the</p>
<p>dominant language throughout the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Latin was never able to replace Greek in this region.</p>
<p>In fact, the linguistic division between the Greek-speaking East and the Latin-speaking</p>
<p>West was the basic dividing line for the later Eastern and Western Roman Empires.</p>
<p>Greek texts, including histories and philosophies, plays, and other literature, were very popular</p>
<p>throughout the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And because of the role Greek played in the region, it became the default language for</p>
<p>arts and science and entertainment.</p>
<p>Greek even began to replace Aramaic among many of the native Semitic tribes.</p>
<p>Latin did begin to seep in after the Romans conquered the region, but Latin was associated</p>
<p>with the hated Roman Empire, so Greek remained the preferred language by default.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the reason why Greek remained entrenched even under Roman rule.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also why the early Christian missionaries chose to write many of the early</p>
<p>texts of the Christian Bible in Greek.</p>
<p>It was the best way to spread the early Christian religion to people throughout the region.</p>
<p>And the decline of Aramaic reinforced the role that Greek played in the process.</p>
<p>Between the 3rd and the 1st centuries BC, the Hebrew scriptures were translated into</p>
<p>Greek for the first time.</p>
<p>And this ultimately included all of the books of the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.</p>
<p>And this translation is known as the Septuagint.</p>
<p>Now that word comes from Latin and means translation of 70 interpreters, because Hebrew</p>
<p>legend held that there were 70 or some say 72 translators of the text into Greek.</p>
<p>Now modern scholars question this number, but the bottom line is that there was now</p>
<p>a Greek version of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>And this Greek version became the basis for many subsequent translations, including translations</p>
<p>into Latin.</p>
<p>By the way, the original Hebrew texts were thought to be lost to history.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the reason why this early surviving Greek translation was so important.</p>
<p>But in 1947, a shepherd boy looking for a lost goat stumbled across several caves near</p>
<p>the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>And in those caves he found around 800 scrolls of papyrus and leather.</p>
<p>And it turns out that those scrolls were part of the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament.</p>
<p>And those scrolls dated from the same period in which the Septuagint was being translated</p>
<p>into Greek.</p>
<p>But these scrolls were primarily written in ancient Hebrew.</p>
<p>So scholars can now compare the original Hebrew texts which survive in those Dead Sea scrolls</p>
<p>with the Greek and other early translations.</p>
<p>Now following the death of Christ, the early Christian missionaries began to write manuscripts</p>
<p>and letters promoting their Christian message in the first century A.D.</p>
<p>And these manuscripts and letters were written in Greek from the very beginning.</p>
<p>The early Christian version of the Hebrew Bible was the Septuagint.</p>
<p>So when these early Christians quoted from the Old Testament, they took their wording</p>
<p>from the Septuagint in Greek.</p>
<p>And a large portion of the New Testament was composed by the Apostle Paul, who not only</p>
<p>wrote in Greek, but also wrote his letters in a distinctly Greek format, with an opening</p>
<p>followed by an exhortium, which is kind of like a thanksgiving and praise section.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s followed by a proof, which is an appeal for action, which is then followed</p>
<p>by a paroration, which is a reiteration, an expansion of the appeal, and then lastly comes</p>
<p>the conclusion.</p>
<p>And by copying this traditional Greek letter format, it allowed Paul&rsquo;s letters to be accepted</p>
<p>and read throughout the Greek-speaking world.</p>
<p>He also traveled throughout Greece as part of his early missionary work, and the book</p>
<p>of Corinthians specifically concerns the early Christian church at Corinth.</p>
<p>All the books of the New Testament were composed in Greek.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the major point here, the fact that Greek played an essential role in the</p>
<p>spread of the early Christian church.</p>
<p>And in fact, it really was the language of the early Christian church, though Latin and</p>
<p>Aramaic and Hebrew were also used, but Greek was by far the primary language of the early</p>
<p>church.</p>
<p>Now you may be saying, what does all of this early Greek and Christian stuff have to do</p>
<p>with the history of English?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is that it actually has a lot to do with the history of English.</p>
<p>First, it provides a backdrop to the spread of Christianity, which is an essential part</p>
<p>of the story of the Middle Ages in Europe.</p>
<p>But for our purposes, both Christianity and Latin were exported from Rome into Western</p>
<p>Europe, and much of the early literacy within and throughout Europe was confined to monks</p>
<p>who wrote in Latin.</p>
<p>So the history of Latin in Europe is closely tied to the history of the church in Europe.</p>
<p>A second consequence of the spread of the Christian church on the history of English</p>
<p>is the significant number of Greek words which have found their way into English through</p>
<p>the church.</p>
<p>For example, the Greek word theos meant God, and it&rsquo;s the root of theology and theological.</p>
<p>It also appears in the word enthusiasm, which comes from the word entheos, meaning inspired</p>
<p>or possessed by God.</p>
<p>Even the term Catholic has origins in Greek.</p>
<p>The term came from a combination of kata, meaning concerning, and holu, meaning whole.</p>
<p>So it basically meant concerning the whole, and it came into Latin as catholicus, meaning</p>
<p>universal, which is the sense that it had in the very early Christian church.</p>
<p>From the Indo-European root word speck, we get the Greek root of scope, meaning to see,</p>
<p>and the Greeks utilized the word in episkopos, which meant overseer, and this is the root</p>
<p>of Episcopalian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the root of bishop, as taken from Latin, meaning the persons who administer</p>
<p>the church&rsquo;s diocese.</p>
<p>The Presbyterian church didn&rsquo;t have bishops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s governed by elders who are called presbyteros in Greek, and again the term passed through</p>
<p>Latin into English as Presbyterian.</p>
<p>The term Baptist also comes from Greek, specifically the Greek word baptizion, meaning to dip or</p>
<p>immerse in water.</p>
<p>Evangelical, Pentecostal, and Apostle are also rooted in Greek.</p>
<p>Even Christ comes from a Greek word meaning the anointed, and Jesus comes from a Greek</p>
<p>translation of the Aramaic name Jeshua.</p>
<p>We also get other religious terms from Greek, including ethical, agnostic, demon, and mystery</p>
<p>or mysterious.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s one other reason why the early spread of the Christian church into Greece</p>
<p>and the use of the Greek language is so important to our look at English, and that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>it is directly connected to the oldest known Germanic language.</p>
<p>You may recall from way back in episode 3 that I talked about the Indo-European family</p>
<p>tree, and in discussing the Germanic languages I mentioned that they originated in Scandinavia</p>
<p>and they spread southward into the heart of continental Europe.</p>
<p>Some of them traveled into Western Europe and became known to linguists as the West</p>
<p>Germanic tribes, and these tribes produced modern Germanic languages like English, German,</p>
<p>Dutch, and Frisian.</p>
<p>But some of those tribes migrated into Eastern Europe and became known as the East Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>All of the East Germanic tribes have been long lost to history as they became mixed</p>
<p>into other groups over time, and for the most part their languages and dialects have disappeared</p>
<p>with them.</p>
<p>But one group&rsquo;s language was written down and it remains with us today, and that group</p>
<p>was the Goths, which eventually split into two distinct groups called the Ostrogoths</p>
<p>and the Visigoths.</p>
<p>Now these Goths played a major role in the eventual fall of the Roman Empire, but at</p>
<p>this early stage they migrated southeastward into the region of the Black Sea and eventually</p>
<p>into the Balkans.</p>
<p>Now the Goths were pagans, but once they settled into the Balkan region they began to encounter</p>
<p>the early Christian missionaries, and a Goth named Wilphelus was exposed to Christianity</p>
<p>in Constantinople.</p>
<p>He became a Christian and was eventually consecrated a bishop for the purpose of spreading Christianity</p>
<p>to the Goths.</p>
<p>And as part of his mission, Wilphelus translated the Bible into Gothic.</p>
<p>And this is not just an interesting historical side note.</p>
<p>It represents one of the most important events in the study of the Germanic languages, because</p>
<p>the Gothic Bible represents one of the earliest detailed writings in a Germanic language.</p>
<p>Most of what we know about the long extinct Gothic language comes from this source.</p>
<p>Many parts of this Gothic translation actually still exist, including more than half of the</p>
<p>Gospels, a large portion of the Epistles, and some portions of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the other important point.</p>
<p>In addition to the Gothic Bible, Wilphelus also created a Gothic alphabet.</p>
<p>Now previously the Germanic tribes had used runic symbols for writing, but the alphabet</p>
<p>created by Wilphelus is a combination of the Greek alphabet and the runic alphabet.</p>
<p>And this blended alphabet came about because Wilphelus had to borrow from the Greek alphabet</p>
<p>to properly translate the Bible, given some of the inherent limitations of the runic writing.</p>
<p>Now as I said, the Gothic Bible, translated near Greece, from Greek, with a blended Greek-runic</p>
<p>alphabet, gives us the oldest attested written Germanic language.</p>
<p>It predates all of the other written Germanic languages, and it predates the arrival of</p>
<p>the Anglo-Saxons in Britain by more than a century.</p>
<p>It therefore gives us a glimpse of what the Germanic languages looked and sounded like</p>
<p>shortly after the end of the original common Germanic language spoken in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>So this provides us with a nice transition from Greek to the languages and peoples of</p>
<p>Western Europe, including the Latin-speaking Romans, the Celtic tribes, and those early</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>The history of these three groups is interconnected, but I&rsquo;m going to begin by looking at the early</p>
<p>Romans.</p>
<p>Next time, we&rsquo;ll look at the settlement of Latin-speaking Indo-Europeans into Italy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also look at the early Etruscan civilization, which predated and heavily influenced the</p>
<p>rise of Rome.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll look at the transition of the Greek alphabet from the Greeks to the Etruscans,</p>
<p>and then to the Romans.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at the rise of Rome as a major regional power.</p>
<p>And along the way, I&rsquo;ll look at some of the many Latin words which have found their way</p>
<p>into modern English.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks again for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
