    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Eddie Chang.</p>
<p>Dr. Eddie Chang is the chair of the neurosurgery department</p>
<p>at the University of California at San Francisco.</p>
<p>Dr. Chang&rsquo;s clinical group focuses on the treatment</p>
<p>of movement disorders, including epilepsy.</p>
<p>He is also a world expert</p>
<p>in the treatment of speech disorders</p>
<p>and relieving paralysis that prevents speech</p>
<p>and other forms of movement and communication.</p>
<p>Indeed, his laboratory is credited with discovering ways</p>
<p>to allow people who have fully locked-in syndrome,</p>
<p>that is, who cannot speak or move,</p>
<p>to communicate through computers and AI devices</p>
<p>in order to be able to speak to others in their world</p>
<p>and understand what others are saying to them.</p>
<p>It is a truly remarkable achievement that we discuss today,</p>
<p>in addition to his discoveries about critical periods,</p>
<p>which are periods of time during one&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>when one can learn things in particular languages</p>
<p>with great ease, as opposed to later in life.</p>
<p>And we talk about the basis of things like bilingualism</p>
<p>and trilingualism.</p>
<p>We talk about how the brain controls movement</p>
<p>of the very muscles that allow for speech and language</p>
<p>and how those can be modified over time.</p>
<p>We also talk about stutter,</p>
<p>and we talk about a number of aspects of speech</p>
<p>and language that give insight</p>
<p>into not just how we create this incredible thing</p>
<p>called speech or how we understand speech and language,</p>
<p>but how the brain works more generally.</p>
<p>Dr. Chang is also one of the world leaders</p>
<p>in bioengineering, that is the creation of devices</p>
<p>that allow the brain to function</p>
<p>at super physiological levels,</p>
<p>and that can allow people with various syndromes</p>
<p>and disorders to overcome their deficits.</p>
<p>So if you are somebody who is interested</p>
<p>in how the brain works normally,</p>
<p>how it breaks down and how it can be repaired,</p>
<p>and if you are interested in speech and language,</p>
<p>reading and comprehension of information of any kind,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode ought to include some information</p>
<p>of deep interest to you.</p>
<p>Dr. Chang is indeed the top of his field</p>
<p>in terms of understanding these issues</p>
<p>of how the brain encodes speech and language</p>
<p>and create speech and language,</p>
<p>and as I mentioned, movement disorders and epilepsy.</p>
<p>We even talk about things such as the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>the future of companies like Neuralink,</p>
<p>which are interested in bioengineering</p>
<p>and augmenting the human brain, and much more.</p>
<p>One thing that I would like to note</p>
<p>is that in addition to being</p>
<p>a world-class neuroscience researcher</p>
<p>and world-class clinician neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>and chair of neurosurgery,</p>
<p>Dr. Eddie Chang has also been</p>
<p>a close personal friend of mine</p>
<p>since we were nine years old.</p>
<p>We attended elementary school together,</p>
<p>and we actually had a science club</p>
<p>when we were nine years old</p>
<p>focused on a very particular topic.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to listen in to today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>to discover what that topic was</p>
<p>and what membership to that club required.</p>
<p>That aside, Dr. Chang is an absolute phenom</p>
<p>with respect to his scientific prowess,</p>
<p>that is both his research and his clinical abilities,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s one of these rare individuals</p>
<p>that whenever he opens his mouth, we learn.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>are critical to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>and we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes,</p>
<p>and while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this, and as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Eddie Chang.</p>
<p>Eddie, welcome.</p>
<p>Hi, hi, Andrew.</p>
<p>Great to be here with you.</p>
<p>This has been a long time coming.</p>
<p>Just to come clean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve known each other since we were nine years old,</p>
<p>but then there was a long gap</p>
<p>in which we didn&rsquo;t talk to one another.</p>
<p>I heard things about you,</p>
<p>and presumably you heard a thing or two about me,</p>
<p>for better or for worse.</p>
<p>And then we reconnected years later</p>
<p>when I was a PhD student and you were a medical student.</p>
<p>We literally ran into each other</p>
<p>in the halls of University of California, San Francisco,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re now the chair of neurosurgery.</p>
<p>So it all comes full circle.</p>
<p>When you were at UCSF, you were working with Mike Merzenich,</p>
<p>and I know that name might not be familiar</p>
<p>to a lot of people,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s sort of synonymous with neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the ability of the brain and nervous system</p>
<p>to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>So for our listeners,</p>
<p>I would just love for you to give a brief overview</p>
<p>of what you were doing at that time,</p>
<p>because I find that work so fascinating,</p>
<p>and it really points to some of the things</p>
<p>that can promote and maybe hinder</p>
<p>our brain&rsquo;s ability to change.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, that&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>So we did bump into each other serendipitously back then.</p>
<p>And at the time I was a medical student at UCSF</p>
<p>studying with Mike Merzenich.</p>
<p>In particular, I was studying how the brain organizes</p>
<p>when you have patterns of sound.</p>
<p>And in particular, we were studying the brain of rodents</p>
<p>and trying to understand how different sound patterns</p>
<p>organize the frequency representation</p>
<p>from low to middle to high frequency maps</p>
<p>in the brains of baby rodents.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I was very interested in</p>
<p>was trying to understand</p>
<p>how the patterns of the natural environment,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the vocalizations of the environment</p>
<p>that the rat pups were raised in,</p>
<p>or just the natural sounds that they hear,</p>
<p>how that shapes the structure of the brain.</p>
<p>And one of the things we did was to try and experiment</p>
<p>where we raised some of these rat pups in white noise,</p>
<p>continuous white noise that was essentially masking</p>
<p>all of those environmental sounds.</p>
<p>And what was the consequence of animals</p>
<p>being raised in white noise environment?</p>
<p>Well, one of the things that we didn&rsquo;t expect,</p>
<p>but we found which is quite striking</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s this early period in brain development</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re very susceptible to the patterns</p>
<p>that we hear or see.</p>
<p>In neuroscience, we call this a critical period</p>
<p>or a sensitive period.</p>
<p>And we have this for our eyes,</p>
<p>but we also have it for our ears.</p>
<p>And one of the most striking examples of this</p>
<p>is that any human can essentially grow up in a culture</p>
<p>where they hear different speech sounds</p>
<p>from one language to another.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like after a couple of years,</p>
<p>you lose sensitivity to sounds</p>
<p>that are not part of your native language,</p>
<p>and you have high sensitivity</p>
<p>for the languages of your native culture.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty extraordinary</p>
<p>that human brain has that flexibility,</p>
<p>yet at the same time has that specialization for language.</p>
<p>And so we were trying to think about</p>
<p>how do we model this, for example, in rodents</p>
<p>who obviously don&rsquo;t speak,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just understanding how sounds</p>
<p>and environmental sounds modulate</p>
<p>and organize the auditory cortex.</p>
<p>And one of the things that we found</p>
<p>that was quite striking was that</p>
<p>if you basically mask environmental sounds</p>
<p>from these rat pups, the critical period,</p>
<p>this sensitive period where it&rsquo;s open to plasticity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s open to change, it&rsquo;s open to reorganization,</p>
<p>that actually, that window can stay open much, much longer.</p>
<p>And in one way, it sounds like that&rsquo;s a good thing,</p>
<p>but on the other hand, it&rsquo;s also a retardation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it slowed the maturation</p>
<p>of the auditory cortex.</p>
<p>It was ready to close when these rat pups were really young,</p>
<p>but by raising them in white noise,</p>
<p>we found out that you could keep it open</p>
<p>for months beyond the time period that it normally closes.</p>
<p>And so I think one of the things it taught me</p>
<p>was that it&rsquo;s not just about the genetic programming</p>
<p>that specifies some of this sensitive period,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a little bit about the nature</p>
<p>of the sounds that we hear that help keep that window</p>
<p>for the critical period open and closed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s difficult to make a direct leap</p>
<p>from animal research to human research,</p>
<p>but if we could speculate a little bit,</p>
<p>I can imagine that some people grow up in homes</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of shouting and a lot of inflection.</p>
<p>Maybe people are very verbose.</p>
<p>Maybe others grow up in a home</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s quieter and more peaceful.</p>
<p>Some people are going to grow up in cities.</p>
<p>I just came back from New York City.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all night long, there&rsquo;s honking and sirens,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just nonstop.</p>
<p>And then I returned here where it&rsquo;s quite quiet at night.</p>
<p>Can we imagine that the human brain</p>
<p>is going to be shaped differently</p>
<p>depending on whether or not</p>
<p>when it grows up in one environment or another?</p>
<p>And would that impact their tendency</p>
<p>to speak in a certain way,</p>
<p>as well as hear in a certain way?</p>
<p>What do we know about that?</p>
<p>Well, I think that it&rsquo;s, from my perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really clear that those sounds that we are exposed to</p>
<p>from the very earliest time, even in utero, in the womb,</p>
<p>where the sound is hearing the mother or father or friends</p>
<p>around while in the womb,</p>
<p>actually will influence how these things organize.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no question that the sounds that we hear</p>
<p>are going to have some influence.</p>
<p>And those sounds are going to structure</p>
<p>the way that those neural networks actually lay down</p>
<p>and will forever influence how you hear sounds.</p>
<p>And speech and language</p>
<p>is probably one of the most profound examples of that.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions</p>
<p>about the use of white noise during sleep.</p>
<p>In particular, people want to know</p>
<p>whether or not using a white noise machine</p>
<p>or a machine or a program</p>
<p>that makes the sound of waves, for instance,</p>
<p>if it assists their infant in sleeping,</p>
<p>is it going to be bad for them</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s flooding the auditory system</p>
<p>with a bunch of essentially white noise</p>
<p>or disorganized noise?</p>
<p>Do we have an answer to that question?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>I think that what you&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>is a really important question</p>
<p>because parents are using white noise generators</p>
<p>almost universally now.</p>
<p>And for good reasons, you know,</p>
<p>it is hard to have kids up at night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got three kids of my own</p>
<p>and was very tempted to think about</p>
<p>how to use some of these tools</p>
<p>to just soothe them and get them to bed,</p>
<p>especially when I was like so tired and exhausted.</p>
<p>But I think that there is a cost, you know,</p>
<p>to think a little bit about, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not exposed to continuous white noise naturally.</p>
<p>There is a value to having really salient structured sounds</p>
<p>that are part of our natural environment</p>
<p>to actually have the brain develop normally.</p>
<p>So whether or not that has an impact, you know,</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re sleeping, it&rsquo;s not clear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that those studies have been done.</p>
<p>What was really clear was that</p>
<p>if you raise these baby rats in continuous white noise,</p>
<p>not super loud, but just enough</p>
<p>to mask the environmental sounds,</p>
<p>that that was enough to keep, you know,</p>
<p>the auditory cortex, the part of the brain that hears</p>
<p>in this really delayed state,</p>
<p>which could essentially slow down the development</p>
<p>and maturation of the brain.</p>
<p>And one could probably assume that</p>
<p>slowing the maturation of areas of the brain</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re responsible for hearing might,</p>
<p>I want to underscore,</p>
<p>might impact one&rsquo;s ability to speak, right?</p>
<p>Because isn&rsquo;t it the case that if people can&rsquo;t hear,</p>
<p>they actually have a harder time enunciating</p>
<p>in a particular way?</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>If I were to not be able to hear my own voice,</p>
<p>would my speech patterns change?</p>
<p>Well, I think part of it is that over time,</p>
<p>we develop sensitivity to the very specific speech sounds</p>
<p>in a given language.</p>
<p>And the sensitivity improves</p>
<p>as we hear more and more and more of it.</p>
<p>And then on the other hand,</p>
<p>we lose sensitivity to other speech sounds at the same time.</p>
<p>But as part of that process,</p>
<p>we also have a selectivity,</p>
<p>again, a specialization even for those sounds.</p>
<p>Even relative to noise,</p>
<p>noisy backgrounds and things like that.</p>
<p>I tend to think about it like</p>
<p>what is the signal to noise ratio?</p>
<p>And so the brain has its own ways</p>
<p>of trying to increase that signal to noise ratio</p>
<p>in order to make it more clear.</p>
<p>Part of that is how we hear</p>
<p>and how it lays down a foundation</p>
<p>for that signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p>And so you can imagine a child</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s raised continuously in white noise</p>
<p>would be really deprived of those kinds of sounds</p>
<p>that are really necessary for it to develop properly.</p>
<p>So I think with regard to those tools for babies,</p>
<p>I think we should study,</p>
<p>we should try to understand this definitively.</p>
<p>I think what we saw in rodents</p>
<p>would tell us that there is potential,</p>
<p>things that we should be concerned about.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s not really clear</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just using at night,</p>
<p>whether it has those effects.</p>
<p>I guess the critical question</p>
<p>that a number of people are going to be asking is,</p>
<p>did you decide to use a white noise machine</p>
<p>or not to help keep any of your three children asleep?</p>
<p>Well, I think the short answer is no.</p>
<p>I mean, I obviously did a lot of work thinking</p>
<p>and work on this and thought about it carefully,</p>
<p>but there are other kinds of noise,</p>
<p>or I wouldn&rsquo;t even call it noise,</p>
<p>other sounds that you can use</p>
<p>that can be equally soothing to a baby.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that white noise has no structure</p>
<p>and what it&rsquo;s doing is essentially masking out</p>
<p>all of the natural sounds.</p>
<p>And I think the goal should really be about</p>
<p>how do we replace that with other more natural sounds</p>
<p>that structure the brain in the way</p>
<p>that we want to be more healthy.</p>
<p>Well, I know that after you finished your medical training,</p>
<p>you went on to, of course, specialize in neurosurgery.</p>
<p>And last I checked, you spend most of your days</p>
<p>either running your laboratory or in the clinic</p>
<p>or running the department.</p>
<p>And your clinical work and your laboratory work</p>
<p>involves often removing pieces of the skull of humans</p>
<p>and going in and either removing things</p>
<p>or stimulating neurons,</p>
<p>treating various ailments of different kinds.</p>
<p>But your main focus these days, of course,</p>
<p>is the neurobiology of speech and language.</p>
<p>And so for those that aren&rsquo;t familiar,</p>
<p>could you please distinguish for us speech versus language</p>
<p>in terms of whether or not different brain areas</p>
<p>control them?</p>
<p>And I know that there&rsquo;s a lot of interest</p>
<p>in how speech and language and hearing</p>
<p>all relate to one another.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll talk a bit about, for instance,</p>
<p>emotions and how facial expressions could play into this</p>
<p>or hand gestures, et cetera.</p>
<p>But for the uninformed person</p>
<p>and for me to be quite direct,</p>
<p>what are the brain areas that control speech and language?</p>
<p>What are they really, and especially in humans,</p>
<p>how are they different?</p>
<p>I mean, we have such sophisticated language</p>
<p>compared to a number of other species.</p>
<p>What does all this landscape look like in there?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s a fascinating question.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to just try to connect</p>
<p>a couple of the dots here,</p>
<p>which is that in that earlier work during medical school,</p>
<p>I was doing a lot of what we call neurophysiology,</p>
<p>putting electrodes into the auditory cortex</p>
<p>and understanding how the brain responds to sounds.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we actually mapped out these things</p>
<p>about the sensitivity to sensitive periods.</p>
<p>That experience with Mike Merzenich</p>
<p>and thinking about how plasticity is regulating the brain,</p>
<p>in particular about how sound is represented</p>
<p>by brain activity, was something that</p>
<p>was really formative for me.</p>
<p>And because I was a medical student</p>
<p>and I was going back to my medical studies,</p>
<p>it was that in combination with</p>
<p>seeing some awake brain surgeries</p>
<p>that our department is really well known for.</p>
<p>One of my mentors, Mitch Berger,</p>
<p>really pioneered these methods</p>
<p>for taking care of patients with brain tumor</p>
<p>and be able to do these surgeries safely</p>
<p>by keeping patients awake and by mapping out language.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re talking and listening in your head,</p>
<p>essentially in conversation with these patients</p>
<p>while there&rsquo;s a portion of their skull removed</p>
<p>and you are stimulating or in some cases</p>
<p>removing areas of their brain.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And the only thing off there is it&rsquo;s not essentially,</p>
<p>it is just that.</p>
<p>The only difference between the conversation</p>
<p>that I might have with my patient</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s undergoing awake brain surgery</p>
<p>is that I can&rsquo;t see their face and they can&rsquo;t see my face.</p>
<p>We actually have a sterile drape</p>
<p>that actually separates the operating field</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking and interacting</p>
<p>with our neuropsychologists.</p>
<p>But I can talk to them and they can hear my voice</p>
<p>and vice versa.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really, really important way</p>
<p>of how we can protect some of those areas</p>
<p>that are really critical for language.</p>
<p>At the same time, accomplish the mission</p>
<p>of getting the seizures under control</p>
<p>or getting a brain tumor removed.</p>
<p>And is that because occasionally</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll encounter a brain area,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re stimulating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re considering removing that brain area</p>
<p>and suddenly a patient will start stuttering</p>
<p>or will have a hard time formulating a sentence.</p>
<p>Is that essentially what you&rsquo;re looking for?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking for regions in which it is okay</p>
<p>or not okay to probe?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So the first thing that we do</p>
<p>is that we use a small electrical stimulator</p>
<p>to probe different parts of the areas</p>
<p>that we think might be related and important for language</p>
<p>or talking or even movements of your arm and leg.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call brain mapping.</p>
<p>And we use a small electrical current</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s delivered through a probe</p>
<p>that we can just put at each spot.</p>
<p>And the areas that we&rsquo;re really interested in</p>
<p>are of course the areas that are right around</p>
<p>the part that is pathological,</p>
<p>the part that&rsquo;s injured or the part that has a brain tumor</p>
<p>that we want to remove.</p>
<p>So we can apply that probe and transiently,</p>
<p>meaning temporarily, activate it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re stimulating the part of the brain</p>
<p>that controls the hand, the hand will move.</p>
<p>It will jerk.</p>
<p>Sometimes a fist will be made, something like that.</p>
<p>Other times, while someone is counting</p>
<p>or just saying the days of the week,</p>
<p>you can stimulate in a different area</p>
<p>that stops their speech altogether.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call speech arrest.</p>
<p>Or if someone is looking at pictures</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re describing the pictures</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re stimulating a particular area,</p>
<p>they stop speaking or the words start coming out slurred</p>
<p>or they can&rsquo;t remember the name of the object</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re seeing in the picture.</p>
<p>These are all things that we&rsquo;re listening really carefully</p>
<p>while we apply that focal stimulation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call brain mapping.</p>
<p>What are some of the more surprising,</p>
<p>or maybe even if you want to offer</p>
<p>one of the more outrageous examples</p>
<p>of things that people have suddenly done</p>
<p>or failed to be able to do</p>
<p>as a consequence of this brain mapping?</p>
<p>Well, I think the thing to me</p>
<p>that has been the most striking</p>
<p>is that some of these areas you stimulate</p>
<p>and altogether you can shut down someone&rsquo;s talking.</p>
<p>So a person says,</p>
<p>I wanted to say it, but I couldn&rsquo;t get the words out.</p>
<p>And even though I&rsquo;ve seen this thousands of times now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still exciting every time that I see it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s exciting because you&rsquo;re seeing the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a physical organ.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the body.</p>
<p>Outside of the veins, on top of it,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look like a machine.</p>
<p>But when you do something like that</p>
<p>and you focally change the way it works,</p>
<p>and you see that because a person can&rsquo;t talk anymore,</p>
<p>and they say, I know what I want to say,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t get the words out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re confronted with this idea</p>
<p>that that organ is the basis of speech and language,</p>
<p>and way beyond that, obviously,</p>
<p>for all the other functions that we have for thinking</p>
<p>and feeling our emotions, everything.</p>
<p>So that to me is a constant reminder</p>
<p>of this really special thing that the brain does</p>
<p>was compute so many of the things that we do,</p>
<p>and in particular in the area around speech and language,</p>
<p>generating words,</p>
<p>something that is really unique to our species</p>
<p>is just extraordinary to see.</p>
<p>Again, even though I&rsquo;ve seen it thousands of times,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just having that connection</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t look like machine,</p>
<p>but it is doing something</p>
<p>that is quite complicated, precise, and remarkable.</p>
<p>Do you ever see emotional responses</p>
<p>from stimulation in particular areas?</p>
<p>And do you ever hear or see emotional responses</p>
<p>that are associated with particular types of speech?</p>
<p>Because for instance, curse words are known to,</p>
<p>people with Tourette&rsquo;s often will curse, not always,</p>
<p>but sometimes they&rsquo;ll have tics or other things.</p>
<p>But what I learned from a colleague of ours</p>
<p>is that curse words have a certain structure to them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually a heavy</p>
<p>or kind of a sharp consonant upfront, right?</p>
<p>That allows people, at least as it was described to me,</p>
<p>to have some sort of emotional release.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a word like murmur,</p>
<p>which has a kind of a soft entry here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not using the technical language.</p>
<p>And you pick your favorite curse word out there, folks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to shout out any now or say any now,</p>
<p>but that certain words have a structure to them</p>
<p>that because of the motor patterns</p>
<p>that are involved in saying that word,</p>
<p>you could imagine has an emotional response unto itself.</p>
<p>So when stimulating</p>
<p>or when blocking these different brain areas,</p>
<p>do you ever see people get angry or sad or happy</p>
<p>or more relaxed?</p>
<p>Oh, well, definitely I&rsquo;ve seen cases</p>
<p>where you can invoke anxiety, stress.</p>
<p>And I think that there are also areas</p>
<p>that you can stimulate and you can also evoke</p>
<p>the opposite of that, sort of like a calm state.</p>
<p>I think that brain area is slightly hyperactive in you,</p>
<p>or at least more than me.</p>
<p>And all the years I&rsquo;ve known you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve always been, at least externally, a very calm person.</p>
<p>I mean, I always find it amusing</p>
<p>that you work on speech and language</p>
<p>and you have a very calming voice, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m being really serious.</p>
<p>I think that there is a huge variation there, right?</p>
<p>In terms of how people speak and how they accent words.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>So there are areas, for example,</p>
<p>the orbital frontal cortex that we showed,</p>
<p>that if you stimulate there,</p>
<p>the orbital frontal cortex is a part of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s above the eyes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they call it orbital frontal,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s above the eye or the orbit</p>
<p>and in the frontal lobe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this area right in here.</p>
<p>It has really complex functions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important for learning and memory.</p>
<p>But one of the things that we observed</p>
<p>is when you stimulate there,</p>
<p>people tended to have a reduction in their stress.</p>
<p>And it was very much related to their state of being,</p>
<p>meaning that if someone was already kind of feeling normal</p>
<p>and you stimulate there, it didn&rsquo;t do much.</p>
<p>But if someone was in a very anxious state,</p>
<p>it actually relieved that.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ve seen the corollary of that,</p>
<p>which is true too,</p>
<p>which is that there are other areas like the amygdala</p>
<p>or parts of the insula that if you stimulate,</p>
<p>you can cause an acute, temporary anxiety,</p>
<p>a nervous feeling.</p>
<p>Or if you stimulate the insula,</p>
<p>people can have an acute feeling of disgust.</p>
<p>So, you know, the brain has different functions</p>
<p>and these different nodes</p>
<p>that help process the way we feel.</p>
<p>Certainly, I think that to some degree,</p>
<p>neuropsychiatric conditions reflect an imbalance</p>
<p>of the electrical activities in these areas.</p>
<p>One of the things that was something I will never forget</p>
<p>was taking care of a young woman with uncontrolled seizures.</p>
<p>We call that epilepsy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a medical condition</p>
<p>where someone has uncontrolled electrical activity</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can see that as convulsions</p>
<p>where people are shaking and lose consciousness.</p>
<p>There are other kinds of seizures that people can have</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t lose consciousness,</p>
<p>but they can have experiences that just come out of nowhere.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just as a result of electrical activity</p>
<p>coming from the brain.</p>
<p>And about six years ago, I took care of a young woman</p>
<p>who was diagnosed psychiatrically with anxiety disorder</p>
<p>for several years.</p>
<p>It turns out that it wasn&rsquo;t really an anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>It was actually that she had underlying seizures</p>
<p>and epilepsy activating a part of her brain</p>
<p>that evokes, you know, anxious feelings.</p>
<p>How did, how was that discovered?</p>
<p>Because I know a lot of people out there have anxiety.</p>
<p>I mean, in the absence of a brain scan,</p>
<p>how would, or why would one suspect</p>
<p>that maybe they have a tumor or some other condition</p>
<p>that was causing those neurons to become hyperactive?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>because so many people have anxiety</p>
<p>and the vast, vast majority are not having that</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re having seizures in the brain.</p>
<p>I think one of the ways that this was diagnosed</p>
<p>was that the nature of when she was having</p>
<p>these panic attacks was not triggered by anything.</p>
<p>They would just happen spontaneously.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what can happen with seizures sometimes.</p>
<p>They just come out of nowhere.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t fully understand what can trigger them,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t things</p>
<p>that were typically anxiety provoking.</p>
<p>This is something that just happened all of a sudden.</p>
<p>And because you brought it up,</p>
<p>this is not something that you can see on an MRI.</p>
<p>We could not see and look at the structure of her brain</p>
<p>with an MRI that she was having seizures.</p>
<p>The only way that we could actually prove this</p>
<p>was actually putting electrodes into her brain</p>
<p>and proving that these attacks that she was having</p>
<p>were localized to a part called the amygdala.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a medial part of the temporal lobe, which is here.</p>
<p>And associating the electrical activity</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re seeing on those electrodes</p>
<p>with the symptoms that she had.</p>
<p>And she ultimately needed a kind of surgery</p>
<p>where she was awake in order to remove this safely.</p>
<p>Speaking of epilepsy,</p>
<p>a number of people out there have epilepsy</p>
<p>or know people who do.</p>
<p>Are the drugs for epilepsy satisfactory?</p>
<p>I think about things like Depakote</p>
<p>and adjusting the excitation and inhibition of the brain.</p>
<p>Are there good drugs for epilepsy?</p>
<p>We know there are not great drugs</p>
<p>for a lot of other conditions.</p>
<p>But, and how often does one need neurosurgery</p>
<p>in order to treat epilepsy?</p>
<p>Or can it be treated most often just using pharmacology?</p>
<p>Yeah, great question.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of people have seizures</p>
<p>that can be completely controlled by their medications.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s about a one third of people who have epilepsy,</p>
<p>which we define as anyone who&rsquo;s had three or more seizures,</p>
<p>that about a third of them actually don&rsquo;t have control</p>
<p>with all of the modern medications that we have nowadays.</p>
<p>And some of the data suggests</p>
<p>that if you have two or three medications,</p>
<p>it actually doesn&rsquo;t matter necessarily</p>
<p>which of the anti-seizure medications it is.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s data suggests if you&rsquo;ve just tried two or three,</p>
<p>the fourth, fifth, sixth, and beyond</p>
<p>is not likely to help control it.</p>
<p>So we are in a situation, unfortunately,</p>
<p>where a lot of the medications are great for some people,</p>
<p>but for another subset, they can&rsquo;t control it.</p>
<p>And it comes from a particular part of the brain.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, in that subset,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another part of that group</p>
<p>that can benefit from a surgery</p>
<p>that actually either removes that part of the brain,</p>
<p>and nowadays we&rsquo;ll use stimulators now</p>
<p>to sometimes put electrical stimulation</p>
<p>in that part of the brain to help reduce the seizures.</p>
<p>And you said a third of people with epilepsy</p>
<p>might need neurosurgery.</p>
<p>Well, what I mean by that is like,</p>
<p>they continue to have seizures</p>
<p>that are not controlled by all medications.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be another subset of those</p>
<p>that may benefit from a surgery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not that whole third.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a subset of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to say that epilepsy</p>
<p>can be really hard to get fixed.</p>
<p>And for people where the seizures come from one spot</p>
<p>or an area, then surgery can do great.</p>
<p>If it comes from multiple areas</p>
<p>or if it comes from the whole brain,</p>
<p>then we have to think about other methods to control it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, nowadays, there&rsquo;s actually other ways.</p>
<p>Surgery now to us doesn&rsquo;t just mean</p>
<p>removing part of the brain.</p>
<p>Half of what we do now is use stimulators</p>
<p>that modulate the state of the brain</p>
<p>that can help reduce the seizures.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard before that the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>was originally formulated in order to treat epilepsy,</p>
<p>and in particular in kids.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>And why would being in a ketogenic state</p>
<p>with low blood glucose reduce seizures?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And to be honest, I don&rsquo;t know actually</p>
<p>if it was originally designed to treat seizures,</p>
<p>but I can tell you for sure</p>
<p>that for some people, just like with some medications,</p>
<p>it can be a life-changing thing.</p>
<p>It can completely change the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s for everybody,</p>
<p>but for some people, there&rsquo;s no question</p>
<p>that it has some very beneficial effects.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s to be determined still,</p>
<p>like why and how that works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard similar things about the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>for people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, dementia,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothing particularly relevant</p>
<p>about ketosis to Alzheimer&rsquo;s per se,</p>
<p>but because Alzheimer&rsquo;s changes the way</p>
<p>that neurons metabolize energy,</p>
<p>that shifting to an alternate fuel source</p>
<p>can sometimes make people feel better.</p>
<p>And so a number of people are now trying it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as if blood glucose</p>
<p>and having carbohydrates is causing Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And people get confused often</p>
<p>that just because something can help</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that the opposite is harming somebody.</p>
<p>So I find this really interesting.</p>
<p>Sometime I&rsquo;ll check back with you</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening in terms of ketogenic diets</p>
<p>and epilepsy, but you said that in some cases it can help.</p>
<p>Has that observation been made</p>
<p>both for children and for adults?</p>
<p>Because I thought that originally the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>for epilepsy was really for pediatric epilepsy.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So a lot of its focus has really been on kids with epilepsy,</p>
<p>but certainly it&rsquo;s a safe thing to try.</p>
<p>So a lot of adults will try it as well.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics</p>
<p>that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about epilepsy for another reason.</p>
<p>I was taught that epilepsy is an imbalance</p>
<p>in the excitation and inhibition in the brain.</p>
<p>So you think about these electrical storms</p>
<p>that give people either grand mal,</p>
<p>you know, shaking and kind of convulsions.</p>
<p>But years ago, I was reading a book,</p>
<p>a wonderful book, actually,</p>
<p>called The Einstein in Love by Dennis Overby.</p>
<p>It was about Einstein and his more,</p>
<p>I guess, his personal life.</p>
<p>But people who knew him claimed</p>
<p>that he would sometimes walk along</p>
<p>and then every once in a while would just stop</p>
<p>and kind of stare off into space</p>
<p>for anywhere from a minute to three or five minutes.</p>
<p>And it was speculated that he had absence seizures.</p>
<p>What is an absence seizure?</p>
<p>And the reason I ask is I occasionally</p>
<p>will be walking along and I&rsquo;ll be thinking</p>
<p>about something and I&rsquo;ll stop.</p>
<p>But in my mind, I think I&rsquo;m thinking during that time.</p>
<p>But I realized that if I were to see myself</p>
<p>from the outside, it might appear</p>
<p>that I was just kind of absent.</p>
<p>What is an absence seizure?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so strikingly different in its description</p>
<p>from, say, a grand mal convulsive seizure.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Well, like I mentioned before,</p>
<p>depending on how the seizure activity spreads</p>
<p>in the brain or how it actually propagates,</p>
<p>if it stays in one particular spot</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t spread to the entire brain,</p>
<p>it can have really different manifestation.</p>
<p>It can represent really differently.</p>
<p>So absence seizure is just one category</p>
<p>of different kinds of seizures</p>
<p>where you can lose consciousness, basically.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is that you&rsquo;re not fully aware</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on in your environment.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re sort of taken offline temporarily</p>
<p>from consciousness, but you could still be,</p>
<p>for example, standing.</p>
<p>And to people who are not paying attention,</p>
<p>they may not even be aware that that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>What are some other types of seizures?</p>
<p>Well, I think some of the other kinds are,</p>
<p>the classic ones are temporal lobe seizures.</p>
<p>So these are ones that come from the medial structures</p>
<p>like the amygdala and hippocampus.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people, when they have seizures coming from that,</p>
<p>they may taste something very unusual,</p>
<p>like a metallic taste or smell,</p>
<p>something like the smell of burning toast,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>There are some people with temporal lobe seizures</p>
<p>will have deja vu.</p>
<p>They will have that experience</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been somewhere before,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just a precursor to the seizure.</p>
<p>And it just highlights that when people have seizures</p>
<p>coming from these areas,</p>
<p>they sometimes hijack what that part of the brain</p>
<p>is really for.</p>
<p>So the amygdala and hippocampus, for example,</p>
<p>are really important for learning and memory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that when people have seizures there,</p>
<p>that it can invoke a feeling of deja vu</p>
<p>or that it can invoke a feeling of anxiety.</p>
<p>And in the areas that are right next to it, for example,</p>
<p>these areas are really important for processing smell.</p>
<p>So these areas are right next to each other.</p>
<p>So you can have these kind of complex set of symptoms,</p>
<p>the weird taste, the smell of toast,</p>
<p>and then a feeling of deja vu.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s classic for temporal lobe seizure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because those parts of the brain</p>
<p>that process those functions are right next to each other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told that I&rsquo;ve had nocturnal seizures</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve woken up sometimes from sleep</p>
<p>having felt as if I was having a convulsion,</p>
<p>a sort of sense of buzzing in the back of the head.</p>
<p>This happened to me two or three times in college.</p>
<p>My girlfriend, well, I woke up</p>
<p>and my girlfriend was very distraught.</p>
<p>Like you were having a seizure.</p>
<p>I was having full convulsion in my sleep.</p>
<p>What are, is that correct?</p>
<p>Are there, is there such a thing as nocturnal seizures?</p>
<p>What do they reflect?</p>
<p>They eventually stopped happening</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t tether them to any kind of life event.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t doing any kind of combat sport</p>
<p>or anything at the time.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t drinking alcohol much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never really been my thing.</p>
<p>What are nocturnal seizures about?</p>
<p>Oh, well.</p>
<p>And do I need brain surgery?</p>
<p>Nocturnal seizures are just another form.</p>
<p>Like again, epilepsy and seizures</p>
<p>can have so many different forms</p>
<p>and not just like where in the brain,</p>
<p>but also when they happen.</p>
<p>And there are some people who for whatever reason,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very timed to the circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually not just happening at night,</p>
<p>but a certain period at night</p>
<p>when people are in a certain stage of sleep</p>
<p>that the brain is in a state</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s vulnerable to having a seizure.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s basically just one form of that.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not just about where it&rsquo;s coming from,</p>
<p>but also when it&rsquo;s happening and how that&rsquo;s timed</p>
<p>with other things that are happening with the body.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Well, it eventually stopped happening.</p>
<p>So I stopped worrying about it,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t had seizures since.</p>
<p>Returning to speech and language.</p>
<p>When I was getting weaned in neuroscience,</p>
<p>I learned that we have an area of the brain</p>
<p>for producing speech,</p>
<p>and we have an area of the brain for comprehending speech.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story there?</p>
<p>Is it still true that we have a Broca&rsquo;s and a Wernicke&rsquo;s area?</p>
<p>Those are names of neurologists presumably,</p>
<p>or neurosurgeons that discover these different brain areas.</p>
<p>Maybe you could familiarize us</p>
<p>with some of the sort of textbook version</p>
<p>of how speech and language are organized in the brain.</p>
<p>Maybe share with us a little bit of the lesion studies</p>
<p>that led to that understanding.</p>
<p>And then I would love to hear a bit</p>
<p>about what your laboratory is discovering</p>
<p>about how things are actually organized,</p>
<p>because from some discussions you and I have had</p>
<p>over the last year or so, it seems like,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s just be blunt.</p>
<p>It seems that much of what we know</p>
<p>from the textbooks could be wrong.</p>
<p>Well, I love that question,</p>
<p>because for me, it&rsquo;s very central to the research we do,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s where the intersection</p>
<p>between what we do in the laboratory</p>
<p>and our research interfaces with what I see in patients.</p>
<p>And one of the things that fascinated me early on</p>
<p>in my medical training was,</p>
<p>in doing some of these brain mapping</p>
<p>or watching them with my mentor,</p>
<p>or taking care of patients that had brain tumors</p>
<p>in a certain part of the brain,</p>
<p>was that a lot of times what I was seeing in a patient</p>
<p>did not correlate with what I was taught in medical school.</p>
<p>And some people will think,</p>
<p>well, this might be an exception.</p>
<p>But after you see it for a couple of times,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re kind of interested in this problem,</p>
<p>it poses a serious challenge to what you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>and how you think about how these things operate.</p>
<p>And that actually got me really interested</p>
<p>in trying to figure this out,</p>
<p>because earlier we talked about just this extraordinary thing</p>
<p>that the brain is doing to create words and sentences.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the process by which I&rsquo;m getting ideas out</p>
<p>from my mind into yours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible thing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the basis of communication,</p>
<p>high information communication between two individuals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really unique to humans.</p>
<p>So in historical times,</p>
<p>how this works has been very controversial</p>
<p>from day one of neuroscience.</p>
<p>A long time ago, people thought the bumps on your head</p>
<p>corresponded to the different faculties of the mind.</p>
<p>So for example, if you had a bump here,</p>
<p>it might be corresponding to intelligence,</p>
<p>or another one over here, to vision</p>
<p>and these kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we nowadays call phrenology.</p>
<p>And that was kind of the starting point.</p>
<p>A lot of that has been, of course, debunked.</p>
<p>But when you see those little statues</p>
<p>of different brain partitions on someone&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s essentially how people were thinking</p>
<p>about how the brain worked back then,</p>
<p>couple of hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Modern neuroscience began when,</p>
<p>actually was very much related</p>
<p>to the discovery of language.</p>
<p>So modern neuroscience, meaning moving beyond this idea</p>
<p>that the bumps on the scalp</p>
<p>corresponded to the faculties of the mind.</p>
<p>But there were things that actually</p>
<p>were in the brain themselves,</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t corresponding to things</p>
<p>that you could see superficially,</p>
<p>like on the scalp or externally.</p>
<p>That it was something about the brain itself.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems so obvious now,</p>
<p>but back then this was the big academic debate.</p>
<p>And the first observation</p>
<p>that I think really was really impactful</p>
<p>in the area of language was an observation</p>
<p>by a neurosurgeon, a French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.</p>
<p>And what he observed was that in a patient,</p>
<p>not that he did surgery,</p>
<p>but that he had seen and taken care of,</p>
<p>that the person couldn&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>And in particular, they called this individual tan,</p>
<p>because the only words that he could produce was tan, tan.</p>
<p>For the most part, he could generally understand</p>
<p>the kind of things that people were asking him about,</p>
<p>but the only thing that he could utter from his mouth</p>
<p>were these words tan, tan.</p>
<p>And what eventually had happened</p>
<p>was this individual passed away.</p>
<p>And the way that neuroscience was done back then</p>
<p>was basically to wait until that happened</p>
<p>and then to remove the brain</p>
<p>and to see what part of the brain was affected</p>
<p>in this patient that they called tan.</p>
<p>And what Broca found was that there was a part</p>
<p>in the left frontal lobe.</p>
<p>So the frontal lobe is this area like I described earlier,</p>
<p>which is behind our forehead up here.</p>
<p>And in the back of that frontal lobe,</p>
<p>he claimed that this was the seat of articulation</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>He literally used something like that in French,</p>
<p>the seat of articulation,</p>
<p>meaning that this is the part of the brain</p>
<p>that is responsible for us to generate words.</p>
<p>About 50 years later, the story becomes more complicated</p>
<p>with a German neurologist named Karl Wernicke.</p>
<p>And what Wernicke described was a different set of symptoms</p>
<p>in patients that he observed a different phenomenon</p>
<p>where people could produce words,</p>
<p>but a lot of the word,</p>
<p>and they were fluent in the sense that they had like,</p>
<p>they sound like they could be real words,</p>
<p>but from a different language, for example.</p>
<p>And some of us call that like word salad or jargon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially, they were essentially making up words,</p>
<p>but it was not intentional.</p>
<p>It was just the way that the words came out.</p>
<p>But in addition to that,</p>
<p>he observed that these people also could not understand</p>
<p>what was being said to them.</p>
<p>So we could be having conversation</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be asking you, am I a woman?</p>
<p>And you might nod your head,</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;re not processing the question.</p>
<p>And so here are two observations.</p>
<p>One is that the frontal lobe is important</p>
<p>for articulating speech,</p>
<p>creating the words and expressing them fluently.</p>
<p>And then a different part of the brain</p>
<p>called the left temporal lobe,</p>
<p>which is this area right above my ear.</p>
<p>That is an area that I think was claimed</p>
<p>to be really important for understanding.</p>
<p>So the two major functions in language,</p>
<p>to speak and to understand,</p>
<p>were kind of pinned down to that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had that basic idea in the textbooks</p>
<p>for over 200 years.</p>
<p>Certainly what I was taught.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Oh, every, yeah.</p>
<p>And certainly what we still,</p>
<p>we still teach undergraduates,</p>
<p>graduate students and medical students that.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I learned too in medical school.</p>
<p>And what I saw in reality</p>
<p>when I started taking care of patients</p>
<p>was that it&rsquo;s not so simple.</p>
<p>In fact, part of it is fundamentally wrong.</p>
<p>So just in a nutshell,</p>
<p>nowadays, after looking at this very carefully</p>
<p>over hundreds of patients,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve shown that surgeries, for example,</p>
<p>in the posterior part of the frontal lobe,</p>
<p>a lot of times people have no problem talking at all,</p>
<p>whatsoever after those kinds of surgeries.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s a different part of the brain,</p>
<p>that we call the precentral gyrus.</p>
<p>The precentral gyrus is a part of the brain</p>
<p>that is intimately associated with the motor cortex.</p>
<p>The motor cortex is the part of the brain</p>
<p>that has a map of your entire body.</p>
<p>So that has a part that corresponds to your feet,</p>
<p>has a part that corresponds to your hands.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s another part</p>
<p>that comes out more laterally on the side of the brain</p>
<p>that corresponds to your lips, your jaw, your larynx.</p>
<p>And we have seen that when patients have surgeries</p>
<p>or injuries to that part of the brain,</p>
<p>it actually can really interrupt language.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not as simple as just moving</p>
<p>the muscles of the vocal tract,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also important for formulating</p>
<p>and expressing words.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Broca&rsquo;s area</p>
<p>that I think the field now recognizes,</p>
<p>not just because of our work,</p>
<p>but many other people that have studied this</p>
<p>in stroke and beyond,</p>
<p>is that the idea that that is the basis</p>
<p>of speaking in Broca&rsquo;s area</p>
<p>is fundamentally wrong right now.</p>
<p>And we have to figure out how to correct the textbooks</p>
<p>that we kind of understand that</p>
<p>so that we can continue to make progress.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of the other major area</p>
<p>that we call Wernicke&rsquo;s area,</p>
<p>the posterior temporal lobe,</p>
<p>that has held,</p>
<p>held, I think, quite legitimately for some time.</p>
<p>So that is an area that you have to be super careful</p>
<p>when you do surgery there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an area where if you have a mistake there</p>
<p>and you cause a stroke</p>
<p>or you remove too much of the tumor there,</p>
<p>you go too far beyond it,</p>
<p>then the person can be really, really hurt.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll have a condition that we call aphasia,</p>
<p>where they may not be able to understand words.</p>
<p>They may not be able to remember the word</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to say.</p>
<p>They know what they&rsquo;re trying to say,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t remember the precise word</p>
<p>that goes with the object that they&rsquo;re trying to think of.</p>
<p>They may even produce words that I described before</p>
<p>are like word salad or very jargony.</p>
<p>So, you know, they might say something like,</p>
<p>Tamir and I.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a real word,</p>
<p>but it sounds like it could be, you know?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just because that part of the brain</p>
<p>has some role, not just in understanding what we hear,</p>
<p>but also actually has a really important role</p>
<p>in sending the commands to different parts of the brain</p>
<p>to control what we say.</p>
<p>Not long ago, you and me and my good friend, Rick Rubin,</p>
<p>were having a conversation about medicine and science.</p>
<p>And Rick asked the question,</p>
<p>what percentage of what you learned in graduate</p>
<p>and or medical school do you think is correct?</p>
<p>And you had a very interesting answer.</p>
<p>Would you share it with us?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the exact,</p>
<p>but I would say that with regard to the brain in particular,</p>
<p>I would say about 50% gets it right and accurate</p>
<p>and is helpful.</p>
<p>But another 50% is just the approximation</p>
<p>and oversimplification of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>The example that we talked about language,</p>
<p>just an example of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, there are things that make it easier to learn</p>
<p>and easier to teach and easier to even think about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably why we continue teaching</p>
<p>in the way that we do.</p>
<p>But I think as time goes on,</p>
<p>the complexity of reality of how the brain works</p>
<p>is, well, first of all, we&rsquo;re still trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>And second of all, it is complex</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still incomplete story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s early days.</p>
<p>And we get into some of the technical advances</p>
<p>that are allowing some correction of the errors</p>
<p>that the field has made.</p>
<p>And look, no disrespect to the brain explorers</p>
<p>that came before us.</p>
<p>And the ones that come after us will correct us, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way the game is played.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m hearing is that there are certain truths</p>
<p>that people accept.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s about half of the information</p>
<p>that is still open for debate</p>
<p>and maybe even for complete revision.</p>
<p>One thing that I learned about language</p>
<p>and the neural circuits underlying language</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s heavily lateralized.</p>
<p>That these structures, Broca&rsquo;s and Wernicke&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and other structures in the brain</p>
<p>responsible for speech and comprehension of speech</p>
<p>sit mainly on one side of the brain,</p>
<p>but they do not have a mirror representation</p>
<p>or another equivalent area</p>
<p>on the opposite side of the brain.</p>
<p>And for those that haven&rsquo;t poked around in a lot of brains,</p>
<p>certainly you Eddie have done far more of that than I have,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve done my fair share in non-human species</p>
<p>and a little bit in humans.</p>
<p>Almost every structure, almost every structure</p>
<p>has a matching structure on the other side of the brain.</p>
<p>So when we say the hippocampus,</p>
<p>we really mean two hippocampi,</p>
<p>one on each side of the brain.</p>
<p>But language I was taught is heavily lateralized.</p>
<p>That is that there&rsquo;s only one.</p>
<p>So that raises two questions.</p>
<p>One, is that true?</p>
<p>And if it is true,</p>
<p>then what is the equivalent real estate</p>
<p>on the opposite side of the brain doing?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not doing the same function</p>
<p>that the one on the, say the left side is performing?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s one of those things that is again,</p>
<p>like mostly true, not a hundred percent.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is that it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>So for people who are right-handed,</p>
<p>99% of the time,</p>
<p>the language part of the brain is on the left side.</p>
<p>And what is the equivalent brain area</p>
<p>on the right side doing if it&rsquo;s not doing language?</p>
<p>Well, you know, the thing that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>is if you look at the right side</p>
<p>and you look at it very carefully,</p>
<p>either under an MRI,</p>
<p>or you actually look at the brain</p>
<p>under slides at a microscope,</p>
<p>it looks very, very similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not identical, but it looks very, very similar.</p>
<p>All the gyri, which are the bumps on the brain that,</p>
<p>you know, have the different contours</p>
<p>and the valleys that we call soul side,</p>
<p>those all look basically the same.</p>
<p>Like there is a mirror anatomy on the left and right side.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not been so clear what&rsquo;s so special actually</p>
<p>about the left side to house language.</p>
<p>But what we do know,</p>
<p>and this is what we use all the time in assessing</p>
<p>and figuring out, you know, this before surgery,</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re right-handed,</p>
<p>99% of the time the language is going to be</p>
<p>on the left side of the brain.</p>
<p>Is handedness genetic in any way?</p>
<p>I mean, when I grew up,</p>
<p>a pen or pencil or crayon was placed into my hand,</p>
<p>presumably, or I started using it.</p>
<p>My father was left-handed</p>
<p>and then where he grew up in South America,</p>
<p>they forced him to force himself to become right-handed.</p>
<p>They actually used to restrict the movement</p>
<p>of his left hand, so he was forced to right.</p>
<p>So, and then you have hook lefties and hook righties.</p>
<p>I know this is a deep dive</p>
<p>and we probably don&rsquo;t want to go</p>
<p>into every derivation of this.</p>
<p>So for somebody who&rsquo;s left-handed,</p>
<p>naturally just starts writing with the left hand,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some genetic predisposition to being left-handed?</p>
<p>Absolutely, no question about it.</p>
<p>Handedness is not entirely, but strongly genetic.</p>
<p>So there is something about that ties all of this.</p>
<p>And what does handedness, for example,</p>
<p>have to do with where the part of your brain</p>
<p>that controls language?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the parts that control the hand</p>
<p>are very close to the areas that really are responsible</p>
<p>for the vocal tract.</p>
<p>Again, part of the motor cortex</p>
<p>and part of this brain area called the precentral gyrus.</p>
<p>And there are some theories that because of their proximity,</p>
<p>that these parts of the brain might develop together early</p>
<p>in utero and they might have a headstart</p>
<p>compared to the right side.</p>
<p>And because they have a headstart,</p>
<p>that things solidify there.</p>
<p>This is one theory of why this happens.</p>
<p>And people who are left-handed,</p>
<p>it still turns out that the vast majority of people</p>
<p>have language on the left side, but it&rsquo;s not 99%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like 70%.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re left-handed, it&rsquo;s still more likely</p>
<p>that the language part of your brain</p>
<p>is going to be on the left side,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s going to be a greater proportion,</p>
<p>maybe 20, 30%, where it&rsquo;s either in both hemispheres</p>
<p>or on the right side.</p>
<p>And just to make this a little bit more interesting</p>
<p>is that when people have strokes on the left side,</p>
<p>and if they&rsquo;re lucky enough to recover from those strokes,</p>
<p>sometimes that involves reorganization,</p>
<p>this term that we call plasticity earlier,</p>
<p>where the areas around where the stroke</p>
<p>take on that new function</p>
<p>in a way that they didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>That can certainly happen in the left hemisphere,</p>
<p>but there are also instances</p>
<p>where the right hemisphere</p>
<p>can also start to take on the function of language,</p>
<p>where when it was once on the left</p>
<p>and then transfers to the right.</p>
<p>So the thing that I think about a lot</p>
<p>is that the machinery probably exists on both sides,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t use them together all the time.</p>
<p>In fact, we may strongly bias one side or the other,</p>
<p>just like we use our two hands</p>
<p>in very, very different ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit the same with the brain.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because of what we do with the brain</p>
<p>that actually is why we use the hands in different ways.</p>
<p>And the same thing goes for language,</p>
<p>which is, again, the substrates, the organ,</p>
<p>the language organ, the part of the brain that processes it</p>
<p>probably has very similar machinery on the left side</p>
<p>as the right,</p>
<p>and the right may have the capability to do it,</p>
<p>but in real everyday use,</p>
<p>the brain specializes one of the sides</p>
<p>in order for us to use it functionally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a theory.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re bilingual, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You speak English and Chinese?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For people that are bilingual</p>
<p>and that learn two or more, bilingual is two, obviously,</p>
<p>but learn both languages,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say more languages from an early time in life,</p>
<p>do they use the same brain area to generate that language,</p>
<p>or perhaps they use the left side to speak English</p>
<p>and the right side to speak Chinese?</p>
<p>Do we know anything about bilingualism in the brain?</p>
<p>I think we know a lot about bilingualism in the brain.</p>
<p>The answers are still out there, the final answers on it.</p>
<p>And part of the answer is yes, absolutely,</p>
<p>we use some parts of the brain.</p>
<p>Very similarly, we actually have a study in the lab right</p>
<p>now where we&rsquo;re looking at this,</p>
<p>where people who speak one language or another,</p>
<p>or bilingual, and we&rsquo;re looking at how the brain activity</p>
<p>patterns occur when they&rsquo;re hearing one language</p>
<p>versus the other.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s striking to see actually is how overlapping</p>
<p>they really can be,</p>
<p>even though the person may have no idea of the language</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re hearing,</p>
<p>the English part of the brain is still processing that</p>
<p>and maybe trying to interpret it through an English lens,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>So the short answer is that with bilingualism,</p>
<p>there are shared circuitry, there&rsquo;s a shared machinery</p>
<p>in the brain that allows us to process both,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not identical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same part of the brain,</p>
<p>but what it&rsquo;s doing with the signals can be very,</p>
<p>very different.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that precisely is not the instantaneous</p>
<p>detecting of one sound to the next,</p>
<p>but the memory of the sequences of those particular sounds</p>
<p>that give rise to things like words and meaning,</p>
<p>that can be highly variable from one individual to the next.</p>
<p>And those neurons are very,</p>
<p>very sensitive to the sequences of the sounds,</p>
<p>even though the sounds themselves might have some overlap</p>
<p>between languages.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve talked about brain areas</p>
<p>and a little bit about lateralization.</p>
<p>I want to get back to the hands and some things related</p>
<p>to emotion in a little bit,</p>
<p>but maybe now we could go into those brain areas</p>
<p>and start to ask the question,</p>
<p>what exactly is represented or mapped there?</p>
<p>And for people who perhaps aren&rsquo;t familiar with brain</p>
<p>mapping and representation and receptive fields,</p>
<p>perhaps the simplest analogy might be the visual system</p>
<p>where I look at your face, I know you, I recognize you.</p>
<p>And certainly there are brain areas that are responsible</p>
<p>for face recognition.</p>
<p>But the fact that I know that that&rsquo;s your face.</p>
<p>And for those listening, I&rsquo;m looking at Eddie&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The fact that I know that that&rsquo;s your face at all is because</p>
<p>we are well aware that there are cells that represent edges</p>
<p>and that represent dark and light.</p>
<p>And those all combine in what we call a hierarchical</p>
<p>structure.</p>
<p>They sort of build up from basic elements as simple as</p>
<p>little dots, but then lines and things that move, et cetera,</p>
<p>to give a coherent representation of the face.</p>
<p>When I think about language,</p>
<p>I think about words and just talking.</p>
<p>If I sit down to do a long podcast,</p>
<p>or I think about asking you a question,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think about the words I want to say very much.</p>
<p>I mean, I have to think about them a little bit,</p>
<p>one would hope,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think about individual syllables unless I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to, you know, accent something,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a word that I have a particular difficulty saying</p>
<p>where I want to change the cadence, et cetera.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s represented in the neurons,</p>
<p>the nerve cells in these areas,</p>
<p>are they representing vowels, consonants?</p>
<p>And how do things like inflection,</p>
<p>like I occasionally will poke fun at up-speak,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a, I think a healthy,</p>
<p>a normal version of up-speak where somebody&rsquo;s asking a</p>
<p>question, like for instance, what is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an appropriate use of up-speak,</p>
<p>as opposed to saying something that is not a question and</p>
<p>putting a lilt at the end of the sentence,</p>
<p>then we call that up-speak,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t fit with what the person is saying.</p>
<p>So what in the world is contained in these brain areas?</p>
<p>What is represented to me is perhaps one of the most</p>
<p>interesting questions.</p>
<p>And I know this lands square in your wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Sure. Let&rsquo;s get into this, Andrew,</p>
<p>because this is one of the most exciting stuff that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening right now is understanding how the brain processes</p>
<p>these exact questions.</p>
<p>And you asked me earlier, you know,</p>
<p>what is the difference between speech and language?</p>
<p>Speech corresponds to the communication signal.</p>
<p>It corresponds to me,</p>
<p>moving my mouth and my vocal tract to generate words.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re hearing these as an auditory signal.</p>
<p>Language is something much broader.</p>
<p>So it refers to what you&rsquo;re extracting from the words that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>We call that pragmatics and sort of,</p>
<p>are you getting the gist of what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another aspect of it that we call semantics.</p>
<p>Do you understand the meaning of these words and the</p>
<p>sentences?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another part that we call syntax,</p>
<p>which refers to how the words are assembled in a</p>
<p>grammatical form.</p>
<p>So those are all really critical parts of language.</p>
<p>And speech is just one form of language.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many other forms like sign language, reading.</p>
<p>Those are all important modalities for reading.</p>
<p>Our research really focuses on this area that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>calling speech.</p>
<p>Again, the production of this audio signal,</p>
<p>which you can&rsquo;t see, but your microphones are picking up.</p>
<p>There are these vibrations in the air that are created by my</p>
<p>vocal tract that are picked up by the microphone in the,</p>
<p>in the case of this recording,</p>
<p>but also picked up by the sensors in your ear,</p>
<p>the very tiny vibrations in your ear are picking that up and</p>
<p>translating that into electrical activity.</p>
<p>And what the ear does at the periphery is translates all</p>
<p>sounds into different frequencies.</p>
<p>So its main thing to do is to take a speech signal or any</p>
<p>other kind of sound and decompose it,</p>
<p>meaning separate that sound into different kind of signals.</p>
<p>And in the case of hearing,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s doing is separating it out into low, middle,</p>
<p>high frequencies at a very, very high resolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing it very quickly and it&rsquo;s doing it in a</p>
<p>really fine way to separate all of those different sounds.</p>
<p>So if you look at the periphery near the nerve that goes to</p>
<p>your ear, those nerve fibers,</p>
<p>some of them are tuned to low frequency.</p>
<p>Some of them are tuned to high frequency.</p>
<p>Some of them are tuned to the middle frequencies.</p>
<p>And that is what your ear is doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking these words and splitting them up into different</p>
<p>frequencies.</p>
<p>And for those of you out there that aren&rsquo;t familiar with</p>
<p>thinking about things in the so-called frequency space,</p>
<p>bass tones would be lower frequencies and high pitch tones</p>
<p>would be higher frequencies,</p>
<p>just to make sure everyone&rsquo;s on the same page.</p>
<p>So the sound of my voice, the sound of your voice,</p>
<p>or any sound in the environment is being broken down into</p>
<p>these frequencies.</p>
<p>Are they being broken down into very narrow channels of</p>
<p>frequency or are they, I want to avoid nomenclature here,</p>
<p>or are they being binned as fairly broad frequencies?</p>
<p>Because we know low, medium, and high, but for instance,</p>
<p>I can detect whether or not something&rsquo;s approaching me or,</p>
<p>or moving away from me,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not it sweeps louder or right towards</p>
<p>our way, it&rsquo;s subtle, but,</p>
<p>and of course it&rsquo;s combined with what I see and my own</p>
<p>movement, but how finely sliced is our perception of the</p>
<p>auditory world?</p>
<p>Oh, extraordinarily precise.</p>
<p>I mean, we take these millisecond cues,</p>
<p>the millisecond differences between the sound coming to one</p>
<p>ear, let&rsquo;s say your right ear versus your left,</p>
<p>to understand what direction that sound came from.</p>
<p>Those are only millisecond differences.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how precise this works.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it does a lot of computation on this.</p>
<p>It does a lot of analysis as you go up.</p>
<p>And a lot of our work is focused on the part of the brain</p>
<p>that we call the cortex.</p>
<p>The cortex is the outermost part of the brain where we</p>
<p>believe that sounds are actually converted into words and</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this transformation where at the ear words are</p>
<p>decomposed and, you know,</p>
<p>turned into these elemental frequency channels.</p>
<p>And then as it goes up through the auditory system hits the</p>
<p>cortex, there are some things that happen,</p>
<p>obviously before it gets to the cortex,</p>
<p>but when it gets to cortex,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something special going on,</p>
<p>which is that that part of the brain is looking for specific</p>
<p>sounds. And specifically what I mean by that is the sounds of</p>
<p>human language.</p>
<p>So the ones that are the different consonants and vowels</p>
<p>in a different language.</p>
<p>One of the ways that we have studied this is looking in</p>
<p>patients who have epilepsy.</p>
<p>And in a lot of these cases where the MRI looks completely</p>
<p>normal,</p>
<p>we have to put electrodes surgically on a part of the</p>
<p>brain. The temporal lobe is a very, very common place.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done a lot of our work looking at how the temporal</p>
<p>lobe processes speech sounds,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re looking for where the seizures start,</p>
<p>but then we&rsquo;re also doing brain mapping for language and</p>
<p>speech. So we can protect those areas.</p>
<p>We want to identify the areas that we want to remove to cure</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s seizures,</p>
<p>but we also want to figure out the areas that are important</p>
<p>for speech and language to protect those so that we can do</p>
<p>a surgery that&rsquo;s effective and safe.</p>
<p>And so in our research and why it&rsquo;s become a really</p>
<p>important addition to our knowledge is that we have</p>
<p>electrodes directly recording from the human brain surface.</p>
<p>A lot of technology we work with right now is recording on</p>
<p>the mill on the order of millimeters and they can order,</p>
<p>they can record millisecond time resolution of neural</p>
<p>activity.</p>
<p>And what we see is extraordinary patterns of</p>
<p>activity. When people hear words and sentences,</p>
<p>if you look at that part of the brain that we call Wernicke&rsquo;s</p>
<p>area in this part of the temporal lobe,</p>
<p>this whole area lights up when you hear words or speech.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not in a way that is like a general light bulb</p>
<p>warming up and it&rsquo;s generally lit up.</p>
<p>But what you actually see is something much,</p>
<p>much more complicated, which is a pattern of activity.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ve done in the last 10 years is to try to</p>
<p>understand what does that pattern come from?</p>
<p>And if we were to look at each individual site from that part</p>
<p>of the brain, what would we see?</p>
<p>What parts of words are being coded by electrical activity</p>
<p>in those parts of the brain?</p>
<p>Remember the cortex is using electrical activity to</p>
<p>transmit information and do analysis.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re eavesdropping on this part of</p>
<p>the brain as it&rsquo;s processing speech to try to understand</p>
<p>what each individual site is doing.</p>
<p>And what are those sites doing?</p>
<p>Or could you give us some examples of what those sites are</p>
<p>doing? So for instance,</p>
<p>are they sites that are specific for,</p>
<p>or we could say even listening for consonants or for vowels</p>
<p>or for inflection or for emotionality, what&rsquo;s in there?</p>
<p>Okay. Well, what makes these, what,</p>
<p>what makes these cells fire?</p>
<p>Yeah. What gets them excited?</p>
<p>What gets them going is hearing speech in particular.</p>
<p>There are some of these really focal sites, again,</p>
<p>just on the order of millimeter or at some level,</p>
<p>single neurons that are tuned to consonants.</p>
<p>Some are tuned to vowels.</p>
<p>Some are tuned to particular features of consonants.</p>
<p>What I mean by that are different categories of consonants.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a class of consonants that we call plosive</p>
<p>consonants. There&rsquo;s a little bit of linguistic jargon,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to make a point here with that is that certain</p>
<p>classes of sounds, when you make them,</p>
<p>it requires you to actually close your mouth temporarily.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to be thinking about this.</p>
<p>So plosive, like plosive,</p>
<p>like saying the word plosive does requires that.</p>
<p>Exactly. So what&rsquo;s cool about that is that we actually have</p>
<p>no idea what&rsquo;s going on in our mouth. When we speak,</p>
<p>we really have no idea.</p>
<p>Some people definitely have no idea.</p>
<p>Well, not just like in terms of what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>sometimes, but actually like how you&rsquo;re actually moving,</p>
<p>right. You know, the different parts of vocal track.</p>
<p>And I have a feeling if we actually required understanding,</p>
<p>we would never be able to speak because it&rsquo;s so complex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a complex feat.</p>
<p>Some people would say it&rsquo;s the most complex motor thing that</p>
<p>we do as a species is just speaking, not, you know,</p>
<p>the extreme feats of acrobatics or athleticism,</p>
<p>but speaking.</p>
<p>Well, and especially when one observes, you know,</p>
<p>opera or people who, you know, freestyle rappers, you know,</p>
<p>and of course it&rsquo;s not just the lips, it&rsquo;s the tongue.</p>
<p>Yeah. And, and you&rsquo;ve mentioned two other structures,</p>
<p>pharynx and larynx are the main ones that,</p>
<p>can you tell us just,</p>
<p>just educate us at a superficial level,</p>
<p>what the pharynx and larynx do differentially?</p>
<p>Because I think most people aren&rsquo;t going to be familiar.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll talk primarily about the larynx here for a second,</p>
<p>which is that if you think about when we&rsquo;re speaking,</p>
<p>really what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re shaping the breath.</p>
<p>So even before you get to the larynx,</p>
<p>you got to start with the expiration.</p>
<p>So we fill up our lungs and then we push the air out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a normal part of breathing.</p>
<p>And what is really amazing about speech and language</p>
<p>is that we evolved to take advantage</p>
<p>of that normal physiologic thing at a larynx.</p>
<p>And what the larynx does is that when you&rsquo;re exhaling,</p>
<p>it brings the vocal folds together.</p>
<p>Some people call them vocal cords.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really cords.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really vocal folds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re two pieces of tissue that come together</p>
<p>and a muscle brings them together.</p>
<p>And then what happens is when the air comes</p>
<p>through the vocal folds, when they&rsquo;re together,</p>
<p>they vibrate at really high frequencies,</p>
<p>like 100 to 200 Hertz.</p>
<p>Yours is probably about 100 Hertz.</p>
<p>The average-</p>
<p>Yours is 200?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Most male voices are around 100, okay?</p>
<p>And then the average female voice is around 200 Hertz.</p>
<p>And as you know, I&rsquo;ve always had the same voice.</p>
<p>This was a point of shame when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Folks, my voice never changed.</p>
<p>I always had the same voice.</p>
<p>This is a discussion for another time.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s a great voice, a great baritone voice,</p>
<p>but I know in your voice, it&rsquo;s a low-frequency voice.</p>
<p>And the reason why men and women</p>
<p>generally have different voice qualities</p>
<p>is it has to do with the size of the larynx</p>
<p>and the shape of it.</p>
<p>Okay, so in general, men have a larger voice box</p>
<p>or larynx, and the vibrating frequency,</p>
<p>the resonance frequency of the vocal folds</p>
<p>when the air comes through them</p>
<p>is about 100 Hertz for men and about 200 for women.</p>
<p>So what happens is, okay, so you&rsquo;re taking,</p>
<p>you take a breath in, and then as the air is coming out,</p>
<p>the vocal folds come together and the air goes through.</p>
<p>That creates the sound of the voice that we call voicing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the energy of your voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just your voice characteristic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the energy of your voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming from the larynx there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a noise.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s the source of the voice.</p>
<p>And then what happens is that energy,</p>
<p>that sound goes up through the parts of the vocal tract,</p>
<p>like the pharynx into the oral cavity,</p>
<p>which is your mouth and your tongue and your lips.</p>
<p>And what those things are doing</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re shaping the air in particular ways</p>
<p>that create consonants and vowels.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean by shaping the breath.</p>
<p>It just starts with this exhalation.</p>
<p>You generate the voice in the larynx,</p>
<p>and then everything above the larynx is moving around,</p>
<p>just like the way my mouth is doing right now,</p>
<p>to shape that air into particular patterns</p>
<p>that you can hear as words.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>And immediately makes me wonder about more primitive</p>
<p>or non-learned vocalizations like crying or laughter.</p>
<p>Babies will cry.</p>
<p>Babies will show laughter.</p>
<p>Are those sorts of vocalizations</p>
<p>produced by the language areas like Wernicke&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>or do they have their own unique neural structures?</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting question.</p>
<p>So we call those vocalizations.</p>
<p>A vocalization is basically where someone can create a sound</p>
<p>like a cry or a moan, that kind of sound.</p>
<p>And it also involves the exhalation of air.</p>
<p>It also involves some phonation at the level of the larynx</p>
<p>where the vocal folds come together</p>
<p>to create that audible sound.</p>
<p>But it turns out that those are actually different areas.</p>
<p>So people who have injuries</p>
<p>in the speech and language areas</p>
<p>oftentimes can still moan, they can still vocalize.</p>
<p>And it is a different part of the brain.</p>
<p>I would say an area that even non-human primates have</p>
<p>that can be specialized for vocalization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different form of communication</p>
<p>than words, for example.</p>
<p>The intricacy of these circuits in the brain</p>
<p>and their connections to the pharynx and larynx</p>
<p>is just, it&rsquo;s almost overwhelming</p>
<p>in terms of thinking about just how complicated it must be.</p>
<p>And yet some general features and principles</p>
<p>are starting to emerge from your work</p>
<p>and from the work of others.</p>
<p>If we think about that work and we think about,</p>
<p>for instance, Wernicke&rsquo;s area,</p>
<p>if I were to record from neurons in Wernicke&rsquo;s area</p>
<p>at different locations,</p>
<p>would I find that there&rsquo;s any kind of systematic layout,</p>
<p>for instance, in terms of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about sound frequency.</p>
<p>We know that low frequencies are represented</p>
<p>at one end of a structure</p>
<p>and high frequencies at the other.</p>
<p>This is true, actually, at least from my earlier training</p>
<p>within the year itself, within the cochlea,</p>
<p>early work of von Bekesey and from cadavers, right?</p>
<p>They actually figured this out from dead people,</p>
<p>which is incredible, a fascinating literature</p>
<p>people should look up.</p>
<p>And in the visual system, we know that, for instance,</p>
<p>you know, visual position,</p>
<p>where things are is mapped systematically.</p>
<p>In other words, neurons that sit next to each other</p>
<p>in the brain represent portions of visual space</p>
<p>that are next to each other in the real world.</p>
<p>What is the organization of language</p>
<p>in areas like Wernicke&rsquo;s and Broca&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>For instance, I think of the vowels, A-E-I-O-U,</p>
<p>as a kind of a coherent unit,</p>
<p>but do I find the A neurons are next to the E neurons</p>
<p>are next to the, or the A-E-I-O-U?</p>
<p>Is that vowel representation also laid out in order</p>
<p>or is it kind of salt and pepper?</p>
<p>Is it random?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been one of the like most important questions</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been trying to answer for the past decade.</p>
<p>So there is a part of the brain</p>
<p>that we call the primary auditory cortex,</p>
<p>and the primary auditory cortex is deep</p>
<p>in the temporal lobe.</p>
<p>And if you looked at that part of the brain,</p>
<p>there is a map of different sound frequencies.</p>
<p>So if you look at the front of that primary auditory cortex,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find low frequency sounds.</p>
<p>And then as you march backwards in that cortex,</p>
<p>it goes from low to medium to high frequencies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s organized in this really nice and orderly way.</p>
<p>And it turns out there&rsquo;s just not just one,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like mirrors of that tone frequency map</p>
<p>in the primary auditory cortex.</p>
<p>The areas that are really important for speech</p>
<p>are on the side of that.</p>
<p>And we now think that speech can go straight</p>
<p>to the speech cortex without having to go through</p>
<p>the primary auditory cortex,</p>
<p>that it has its own pathway to get to the part of the brain</p>
<p>that processes speech.</p>
<p>And when we&rsquo;ve looked at that question about,</p>
<p>is there a map?</p>
<p>The short answer is yes, there is a map.</p>
<p>And it is, but it is not structured universally</p>
<p>across all people in a way that we can clearly see right now.</p>
<p>It is like a salt and pepper map</p>
<p>of the different features in speech.</p>
<p>So before we talked about these sounds</p>
<p>that are called plosives,</p>
<p>you make a plosive when the mouth</p>
<p>or something in the oral cavity closes temporarily.</p>
<p>And when it opens, that creates that fast plosive sound.</p>
<p>So when you say dad or, you know, the ball,</p>
<p>like the B in ball, that kind of thing,</p>
<p>you will notice that your lips actually close</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s the release of that</p>
<p>that creates that particular sounds.</p>
<p>Okay, so those are the sounds that we call plosives.</p>
<p>Those are like bada ga, pata ka.</p>
<p>Those are a certain class of consonants</p>
<p>that we call plosive sounds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another class of sounds</p>
<p>that we call fricatives in linguistics.</p>
<p>Fricatives are created by turbulence</p>
<p>in the airstream as it comes out through the mouth.</p>
<p>And the way that we make that turbulence</p>
<p>is getting the mouth and the lips to close</p>
<p>almost until they&rsquo;re completely shut.</p>
<p>Or putting the tongue to near the teeth</p>
<p>to almost get it completely shut,</p>
<p>but just have a narrow aperture.</p>
<p>That creates a turbulence in the airflow</p>
<p>that we perceive as a high-frequency sound.</p>
<p>So those are the sounds like sha and tha,</p>
<p>those kind of things.</p>
<p>If you look at the frequencies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re higher frequencies</p>
<p>and those are created by specific movements</p>
<p>that you constrict the airflow to create turbulence.</p>
<p>And we hear it as sha, sa, tha.</p>
<p>So if I say that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And as opposed to a plosive where I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>explosive.</p>
<p>Now, of course I&rsquo;m emphasizing here.</p>
<p>Well, this explains something and solves a mystery,</p>
<p>which is recently I&rsquo;ve been fascinated</p>
<p>by the work of a physician scientist back East,</p>
<p>Dr. Shana Swan, who&rsquo;s done a lot of work</p>
<p>on things that are contained in pesticides</p>
<p>and foods that are changing hormone levels.</p>
<p>And she refers to phthalates, which is spelled P.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both a plosive and a tha.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s combining the two.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the most difficult words</p>
<p>in the English language to pronounce.</p>
<p>And second only perhaps to the correct pronunciation</p>
<p>of ophthalmology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a combination of a plosive</p>
<p>and one of these tha sounds.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably why it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>In fact, we have a term for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called a consonant cluster.</p>
<p>So sometimes syllables will just have one consonant,</p>
<p>but when we start stacking certain syllables in a sequence</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s rules that actually govern</p>
<p>which consonants can be in a particular sequence</p>
<p>for a given language, that makes it more complicated.</p>
<p>And certain languages have a lot more consonant clusters</p>
<p>than others.</p>
<p>So for instance, Russian, for example,</p>
<p>has a lot of constant clusters.</p>
<p>English has a lot of them.</p>
<p>There are other languages that have very, very few.</p>
<p>For example, Hawaiian.</p>
<p>Hawaiian has an inventory of about 12</p>
<p>to 14 different phonemes,</p>
<p>14 different consonants and vowels.</p>
<p>English, on contrast, has about 40</p>
<p>different consonants and vowels.</p>
<p>So languages have different inventories.</p>
<p>They can overlap for sure,</p>
<p>but different languages use different sound elements,</p>
<p>combine and recombine those elements</p>
<p>to give rise to different words and meanings.</p>
<p>Can we say that there&rsquo;s a most complicated language</p>
<p>out there or among the most complicated,</p>
<p>would it be Russian?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely high up there.</p>
<p>English is up there too, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, German as well.</p>
<p>And in terms of learning multiple languages</p>
<p>during development,</p>
<p>my understanding is that if one wants to become bilingual</p>
<p>or trilingual, best to learn those languages</p>
<p>simultaneously during development,</p>
<p>ideally before age 12,</p>
<p>if one hopes to not have an accent in speaking them later.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Or do you want to revise that?</p>
<p>Well, basically the earlier,</p>
<p>and the earlier is better,</p>
<p>the more intense it is and the more immersive it is,</p>
<p>the longer that you can be exposed to that</p>
<p>is really important.</p>
<p>A lot of people can get exposed to early</p>
<p>and basically lose it,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s quote unquote during that sensitive period,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s maintained, it can be very easily lost.</p>
<p>Then I think another aspect of it that&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>is some of the social requirements for it too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that you can only go so far</p>
<p>just listening to these sounds from a tape recording</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something extra about real human interactions</p>
<p>that activates the brain sensitivity</p>
<p>to different speech bounds,</p>
<p>allows us to become specialized for them</p>
<p>for a given language.</p>
<p>So returning to what&rsquo;s mapped,</p>
<p>what the representations are in the brain,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to get a picture now</p>
<p>based on these plosives and these sounds.</p>
<p>And what I find so interesting and logical about that</p>
<p>is it maps to the motor structures</p>
<p>and the actual pronunciation of the sounds,</p>
<p>not necessarily to the meaning of the individual words.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it&rsquo;s related to the meaning</p>
<p>of the individual words,</p>
<p>but it makes good sense to me</p>
<p>why something as complex as language,</p>
<p>both to understand and to generate</p>
<p>would map to something that is essentially motor in design,</p>
<p>because as you point out,</p>
<p>I have to generate these sounds</p>
<p>and I have to hear them generated from others.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s reading and there&rsquo;s writing</p>
<p>and writing is certainly motor,</p>
<p>reading involves some motor commands of the eyes, et cetera.</p>
<p>Where do reading and writing come into this picture?</p>
<p>Are they in parallel with, as we would say in neuroscience,</p>
<p>or are they embedded within the same structures?</p>
<p>Are they part of the same series of computations?</p>
<p>Yeah, so to address the first part</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve got this map</p>
<p>of these different parts of consonants and vowels.</p>
<p>And when we look at how they lay out</p>
<p>in this part of the brain that we call Wernicke&rsquo;s area,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>really just dissecting this millimeter by millimeter.</p>
<p>The term that you use is very apropos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s salt and pepper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not random.</p>
<p>There is this kind of selectivity</p>
<p>to these individual speech sounds.</p>
<p>And one point I want to make about it is this,</p>
<p>is that in English, for example,</p>
<p>there are about 40 different phonemes.</p>
<p>Phonemes are just consonants or vowels</p>
<p>or individual speech segments.</p>
<p>But these articulatory features that you refer to,</p>
<p>for example, the characteristic sounds</p>
<p>that are generated by specific movements in the mouth,</p>
<p>you can more or less reduce that</p>
<p>to about 12 different features.</p>
<p>Okay, these are specific movements of the tongue,</p>
<p>the jaw, the lips, the larynx.</p>
<p>There are about 12 of these movements.</p>
<p>And just like you said, Andrew,</p>
<p>by themselves, they have no meaning.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just movements.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s incredible about it</p>
<p>is that you take these 12 movements</p>
<p>and you put them in combinations</p>
<p>and you start putting them in sequence.</p>
<p>We as humans use those 12 set of features</p>
<p>to generate all words.</p>
<p>And because we can generate</p>
<p>nearly an infinite number of words</p>
<p>with that code of just 12 features,</p>
<p>we have something that generates</p>
<p>essentially all possible meaning.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what we do as humans.</p>
<p>We generate meanings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to communicate one idea to another,</p>
<p>which to me is extraordinary.</p>
<p>A parallel would be, for example, DNA.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s four base pairs in DNA,</p>
<p>but with those four base pairs in a specific sequence</p>
<p>can generate an entire code for life.</p>
<p>And speech is the same way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve got these fundamental elements</p>
<p>that by themselves have no meaning,</p>
<p>but when you put them together,</p>
<p>give rise to every possible meaning.</p>
<p>So with regard to your second point</p>
<p>about reading and writing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating question.</p>
<p>Speech and language is part of who we are as humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of how we evolved</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hardwired and molded by experience.</p>
<p>Reading and writing are a human invention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that was added on</p>
<p>to the architecture of the brain.</p>
<p>And because reading and writing</p>
<p>are fairly recent in human evolution,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s essentially too quick for anything</p>
<p>to have a dramatic change in,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, a new brain area</p>
<p>or some kind of specialization.</p>
<p>Instead, what happens is that whenever</p>
<p>any kind of behavior becomes ultra-specialized</p>
<p>in any of us or any organism,</p>
<p>we can take some areas that are normally involved</p>
<p>with vision, for example,</p>
<p>and specialize it for the purpose of reading.</p>
<p>So all of us have a part of our brain</p>
<p>in the back of the temporal lobe</p>
<p>that interfaces with the occipital visual cortex</p>
<p>that we call a visual word form area.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a part of the brain</p>
<p>that is very sensitive to seeing words,</p>
<p>like either typed or handwritten.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a part of the brain</p>
<p>that also is sensitive to seeing things like faces.</p>
<p>So these are things that are all conditioned</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s important to survive.</p>
<p>So reading and writing are an invention,</p>
<p>and there are things that have mapped</p>
<p>to functions that the brain already has.</p>
<p>And one of the really important things</p>
<p>about reading and writing is that</p>
<p>when we learn to read and write,</p>
<p>especially with the reading part,</p>
<p>it maps to the part of the brain</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>which is the part that&rsquo;s processing speech sounds.</p>
<p>So some of us kind of think about it.</p>
<p>These are two different things.</p>
<p>One is hearing sounds through your ears.</p>
<p>The other is reading,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re actually seeing things through your eyes</p>
<p>and then getting into languages.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the auditory speech cortex</p>
<p>is the primal and primitive fundamental area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important for speech.</p>
<p>And what happens with the reading</p>
<p>is once it gets through that visual cortex,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to try to map those reading signals</p>
<p>to the part of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to make sense of sounds,</p>
<p>the sounds of words, what we call phonology.</p>
<p>Now, why is this important?</p>
<p>It has a lot of relevance to how we learn to write.</p>
<p>And in some kids with dyslexia,</p>
<p>dyslexia is a neurological condition</p>
<p>where a child, in some cases an adult,</p>
<p>has trouble reading, for example.</p>
<p>And in many of those cases,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because that mapping between how we see the words</p>
<p>to the way that the brain processes the sounds</p>
<p>is something different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit different</p>
<p>than people who can read really well.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re reading, a lot of times,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually activating the part of the brain</p>
<p>that is processing the words that you hear.</p>
<p>What is the current treatment for dyslexia?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that it&rsquo;s a deficit</p>
<p>in some of the motion processing systems</p>
<p>of the visual system.</p>
<p>People, their eyes are jumping</p>
<p>as opposed to more linear reading across,</p>
<p>or I suppose if it were Chinese, it would be,</p>
<p>I want to presume people are always reading English,</p>
<p>or I suppose if it&rsquo;s Hebrew,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going from the opposite side of the page.</p>
<p>What can be done for dyslexia?</p>
<p>And do any of the modern treatments for dyslexia</p>
<p>involve changing things from the speech side</p>
<p>as opposed to just the quote-unquote reading side,</p>
<p>given that speech and reading are interconnected?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So again, I think in the beginning,</p>
<p>people might&rsquo;ve thought this was purely a visual abstraction</p>
<p>or something really just about the visual system,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s been more recognition that it could be both,</p>
<p>or it could be either,</p>
<p>depending on the particular instance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that there are many kids with dyslexia</p>
<p>where the problem is a problem of phonological awareness.</p>
<p>So it can be very hard to detect</p>
<p>because they may understand the words that you were saying,</p>
<p>but because the brain is so good at pattern recognition,</p>
<p>sometimes even if the individual speech sounds</p>
<p>are not crystal clear, it can compensate that</p>
<p>so that you can have an individual who can hear the words,</p>
<p>but not be able to essentially hear them</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re reading those same words.</p>
<p>And so what can happen with that</p>
<p>is that you can have this disconnection</p>
<p>between what they&rsquo;re seeing and what they need</p>
<p>in order to hear it as words and process it as language.</p>
<p>And so skilled readers usually need that route first.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to map the vision to the sound</p>
<p>in order to get that sort of like foundation.</p>
<p>But then over time, the reading has its direct connection</p>
<p>to the language parts of the brain.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t necessarily always need to map to sounds.</p>
<p>You can basically develop a parallel route.</p>
<p>And we as readers actually use both all the time.</p>
<p>So for example, if it&rsquo;s a new word</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never seen before,</p>
<p>sometimes you try to like pronounce it in your mind</p>
<p>and try to hear what that word is.</p>
<p>Even though you&rsquo;re not actually saying it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to just generate</p>
<p>what those sounds might be like.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the part where we&rsquo;re kind of relying</p>
<p>on how we learn to read in the first place,</p>
<p>which is mapping those word images</p>
<p>to the sounds that go along with them.</p>
<p>But in other times, if you&rsquo;re a really proficient reader,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just seeing the words</p>
<p>and you can map them directly to meaning</p>
<p>without having to go through that process.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a big fan of listening to audio books.</p>
<p>And of course, I also listen to podcasts quite a lot,</p>
<p>but I also am a strong believer</p>
<p>based on the research that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>that reading books, physical books,</p>
<p>could be on Kindle, I suppose,</p>
<p>but reading a physical book is useful</p>
<p>for being able to articulate well and structure sentences</p>
<p>and build what are essentially paragraphs,</p>
<p>which is what I&rsquo;m required to do</p>
<p>when I do solo episodes of the podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed over the years</p>
<p>as text messaging has become more popular</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s essentially an erosion of punctuation</p>
<p>or the need to have complete sentences.</p>
<p>And now that&rsquo;s sort of transferred to email as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become acceptable to just say, you know,</p>
<p>fragmented sentences in email.</p>
<p>And it seems likely that it&rsquo;s starting to impact</p>
<p>the way that people speak as well.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think this has anything to do</p>
<p>with intelligence or education level,</p>
<p>but are you aware of any evidence</p>
<p>that how we read and what we read</p>
<p>and whether or not we consume information</p>
<p>purely through reading or mainly through auditory sources,</p>
<p>does it change the way that we speak?</p>
<p>Because after all, Wernicke&rsquo;s and Broca&rsquo;s area</p>
<p>and the other auditory and speech production areas</p>
<p>are heavily intermeshed.</p>
<p>And so it would make perfect sense to me</p>
<p>that what we hear and the patterns of sound</p>
<p>that are being communicated to us</p>
<p>would also change the way that we speak.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really fascinating point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this idea that there&rsquo;s like this proper way</p>
<p>to speak, like that there&rsquo;s the right way, for example,</p>
<p>what are the appropriate, you know,</p>
<p>like, for example, in school,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re oftentimes told like,</p>
<p>you should say like this, not say like that, you know,</p>
<p>and every language kind of has that.</p>
<p>It turns out that that&rsquo;s really unnatural.</p>
<p>Languages and speech in particular change over time,</p>
<p>it evolves and it can happen very quickly.</p>
<p>You know, the things that we call dialects, for example,</p>
<p>are just different ways of speaking</p>
<p>and someone can just be in one environment</p>
<p>and change from one dialect to the other</p>
<p>or in some people, it kind of is really fixed.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this idea that, you know, like in school,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re like told that there&rsquo;s this right way,</p>
<p>but in reality, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Like language change and speech change</p>
<p>is completely normal and happens all the time.</p>
<p>And it can be really dramatic,</p>
<p>like certain cultures and communities,</p>
<p>if they are isolated, they can develop a whole new language,</p>
<p>a whole new set of words, for example,</p>
<p>and new ways and dialects that are independent</p>
<p>from people to the point where it&rsquo;s unintelligible</p>
<p>even to others.</p>
<p>And so the basic idea is that sound change</p>
<p>is part of the way it works.</p>
<p>And the brain is very sensitive to those kinds of changes.</p>
<p>Speaking of learning new languages,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s possible to learn new languages</p>
<p>throughout the lifespan, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also heard these kind of fantastical stories</p>
<p>of somebody has a stroke and then suddenly, spontaneously,</p>
<p>can speak French fluently,</p>
<p>whereas prior to the stroke, they could not.</p>
<p>Is there any merit to those stories whatsoever?</p>
<p>I find it very hard to believe</p>
<p>that there was a complete map representation of a language</p>
<p>in somebody&rsquo;s brain that they were completely unaware of.</p>
<p>And then because of damage to a brain area,</p>
<p>that capacity to speak that language was somehow unveiled.</p>
<p>It just seems too wild.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to say good to be true</p>
<p>because nobody wants a stroke,</p>
<p>but it just seems outrageously implausible.</p>
<p>Well, there are aspects of that</p>
<p>that certainly are implausible.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know of any true case that I&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>or experienced myself or even read about where,</p>
<p>for example, there was an injury to the brain</p>
<p>that resulted in loss of,</p>
<p>well, essentially a gain of function,</p>
<p>meaning just all of a sudden</p>
<p>started speaking another language.</p>
<p>So for example, if you had a stroke</p>
<p>and you never spoke French, and then you had it,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden you&rsquo;re speaking,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve never heard of, never seen.</p>
<p>However, there is a condition that is well-acknowledged,</p>
<p>and I have seen one case of this</p>
<p>called a foreign accent syndrome,</p>
<p>which is peculiar because there are people</p>
<p>who have an injury to the part of the brain</p>
<p>where it sounds like they&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>to speak this other language,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not actually speaking the language.</p>
<p>It just sounds like it.</p>
<p>And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier</p>
<p>about these areas that are really important</p>
<p>for speech control of the vocal tract,</p>
<p>this area in the precentral gyrus.</p>
<p>People have documented where patients have had strokes there</p>
<p>and after that, it sounds like they&rsquo;re speaking Spanish</p>
<p>as opposed to English,</p>
<p>or it sounds like they have the intonational properties</p>
<p>of French or Russian</p>
<p>as compared to their original native language.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not learning all the rest of it,</p>
<p>like the meaning and the grammar, et cetera,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re adopting some of the phonology,</p>
<p>and part of that is just because it&rsquo;s not working</p>
<p>the way it normally does.</p>
<p>So there is something actually called</p>
<p>a foreign accent syndrome</p>
<p>that people can have after a stroke.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about auditory memory.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I used to get into bed at night</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d close my eyes</p>
<p>and I would replay conversations</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d heard during the day or people&rsquo;s voices.</p>
<p>I actually can remember calling your house</p>
<p>when we were young kids,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t speak any Chinese,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d have to ask for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, I think it was Eddie Saibutsai.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>And then someone, whoever answered the phone would say,</p>
<p>would go get you and then I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>which I believe means thank you, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the total of the Chinese that I speak, by the way,</p>
<p>but I will never forget that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just never forget it.</p>
<p>I hope, I suppose if I have a stroke</p>
<p>or something of that sort,</p>
<p>at some point I&rsquo;ll forget it</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve forgotten it,</p>
<p>but in all seriousness, I remember that to this day.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t spell that out.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know how, certainly not in Chinese,</p>
<p>but even a transliteration I couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>using English letters.</p>
<p>Where are memories of sounds stored?</p>
<p>Because within our days and across our lives,</p>
<p>we have a infinite number of auditory experiences,</p>
<p>just like we have an infinite number of visual experiences.</p>
<p>Where are they stored?</p>
<p>And what is the structure of their storage?</p>
<p>What am I calling upon?</p>
<p>Besides of course, the motor commands</p>
<p>that are required to say what I just said in Chinese,</p>
<p>which I won&rsquo;t repeat again,</p>
<p>because I can somehow manage to get it right</p>
<p>the first time, or at least not terribly wrong,</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t want to botch it the second time.</p>
<p>Where is that stored?</p>
<p>And how does that work?</p>
<p>And more importantly, as I speak my native language,</p>
<p>English, am I pulling from a memory bank?</p>
<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just telling you what I want to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing my best to communicate clearly and succinctly.</p>
<p>Usually not so good at the succinct part,</p>
<p>but where is the bank of information?</p>
<p>On my keyboard, on my computer, I have the letters</p>
<p>and I have certain elements of punctuation in the space.</p>
<p>What am I pulling from?</p>
<p>Am I pulling from those plosives?</p>
<p>But if so, how can I do it so quickly?</p>
<p>Even for people that speak slowly,</p>
<p>it appears more or less fluid.</p>
<p>This to me is overwhelmingly impressive</p>
<p>that the brain can do that.</p>
<p>How does it do that?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I am impressed that 35 years later.</p>
<p>Well, I had to get ahold of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I am impressed 35 years later</p>
<p>that you can still remember that.</p>
<p>But only that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m still very impressed in,</p>
<p>but clearly it was something important to you.</p>
<p>And so the short answer is that memory is very distributed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like the question that you asked me</p>
<p>is ill-posed, because you asked me where.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not one specific area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really distributed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one particular area.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m fairly certain that if we were to injure</p>
<p>that part of the brain called the Wernicke&rsquo;s area,</p>
<p>you may still even have memories of that.</p>
<p>People can have injuries of Broca&rsquo;s area</p>
<p>or certainly the precentral gyrus</p>
<p>and be able to sing happy birthday, for example,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s embedded in melody or highly rehearsed things</p>
<p>like counting, despite not being able to speak,</p>
<p>which is incredible, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can see a patient, for example,</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t really put together a sentence.</p>
<p>You ask them, how are you feeling today?</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even utter a word,</p>
<p>but then you ask them to count sometimes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll get up to any number, really.</p>
<p>And so there are some things that are really built</p>
<p>into our motor memory and it&rsquo;s distributed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not one particular part of the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually multiple areas</p>
<p>where that memory is distributed.</p>
<p>And thank God that&rsquo;s the way it is,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very rare in the kind of surgeries that I do</p>
<p>where you go and you remove a part or piece of the brain</p>
<p>that someone forgets these kind of long-term memories</p>
<p>or these long-term motor skills that they have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very, very rare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the number one question a patient will ask me,</p>
<p>like, am I going to be the same</p>
<p>and am I going to remember my wife?</p>
<p>Or am I going to remember these thoughts of my birthday</p>
<p>when I was 10 years old?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never really seen that kind of severe amnesia,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s a very, very severe injury</p>
<p>that involves almost the entire brain.</p>
<p>And thank God.</p>
<p>So a lot of that information is really distributed</p>
<p>across the entire brain.</p>
<p>Speaking of storage of and ability to speak,</p>
<p>you are doing some amazing work</p>
<p>and have achieved some pretty incredible,</p>
<p>well-deserved recognition for your work</p>
<p>in bringing language out of paralyzed people,</p>
<p>essentially allowing people who are locked in</p>
<p>to a paralyzed state</p>
<p>or otherwise unable to articulate speech</p>
<p>using brain machine interface,</p>
<p>essentially translating the neural activity</p>
<p>of areas of the brain that would produce speech</p>
<p>into hardware, wires and things of that sort,</p>
<p>artificial non-biological tools</p>
<p>in order to allow paralyzed people to communicate.</p>
<p>And we will provide a link</p>
<p>to some of the popular press coverage of that work</p>
<p>in the original papers.</p>
<p>But if you would be so kind as to tell us</p>
<p>what those experiments look like,</p>
<p>who these people are who are locked in</p>
<p>and that you allow to communicate.</p>
<p>And then especially interesting to me</p>
<p>is some of the directions that you&rsquo;re taking this now,</p>
<p>which is beyond just people being able to think</p>
<p>about what they want to say</p>
<p>and words coming out on a screen or through a microphone,</p>
<p>but actually making the interactions</p>
<p>between these people in the real world</p>
<p>more elaborate and more real.</p>
<p>If that seems mysterious to people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to let Eddie tell you</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing with this</p>
<p>rather than put any more detail on it.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for asking about this.</p>
<p>This has really been some of the exciting recent work</p>
<p>from the lab.</p>
<p>So for the last decade,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve really been focusing on the basic science,</p>
<p>meaning trying to understand how the brain extracts</p>
<p>and produces speech sounds and words.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a lot of work trying to figure out</p>
<p>how these parts of the brain</p>
<p>control these individual elements</p>
<p>that give rise to all words and meanings.</p>
<p>And so it was about six years ago</p>
<p>where we realized we actually have a pretty good idea</p>
<p>of how this code works.</p>
<p>We had identified all of these different elements</p>
<p>that we could decode in epilepsy patients.</p>
<p>For example, when they had electrodes on the brain</p>
<p>as part of their surgeries,</p>
<p>we could decode all of the different consonants</p>
<p>and vowels of English.</p>
<p>That was about six years ago.</p>
<p>So a natural question was this,</p>
<p>which is if we understand that electrical code,</p>
<p>can we use that to help someone who is paralyzed</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t get those signals out of the brain</p>
<p>to speak normally?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in the setting of people who are paralyzed.</p>
<p>So there are a series of conditions.</p>
<p>They include things like brainstem stroke.</p>
<p>The brainstem is the part of the brain</p>
<p>that connects the cerebrum,</p>
<p>which is the top part, does our thinking</p>
<p>and a lot of the motor control,</p>
<p>speech, language, everything.</p>
<p>And the brainstem is what connects that to the spinal cord</p>
<p>and the nerves that go out to the face and vocal tract.</p>
<p>So if you have a stroke there,</p>
<p>basically you could be thinking all the wild,</p>
<p>creative, intelligent thoughts you have in the mind</p>
<p>and the cerebrum, but you can&rsquo;t get them out into words</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t get them out to your hand to write them down.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very severe form of paralysis</p>
<p>called brainstem stroke.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another kind of conditions</p>
<p>that we call neurodegenerative,</p>
<p>where the nerve cells die basically or atrophy</p>
<p>in a condition called ALS.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very severe form of paralysis.</p>
<p>In its extreme form,</p>
<p>people essentially lose all voluntary movement.</p>
<p>So Stephen Hawking would be a good example</p>
<p>of someone with ALS, Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an example of someone who had ALS,</p>
<p>but not a great example of what typical course of ALS.</p>
<p>So for reasons not clear,</p>
<p>the progression of his disease largely stabilized</p>
<p>to the point where he could twitch a cheek muscle</p>
<p>or move his eyes, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And most people, it&rsquo;s very rapid.</p>
<p>And many people, they die from it actually,</p>
<p>within a couple of years of diagnosis.</p>
<p>Yeah, he lived a long time in that.</p>
<p>He lived a long time.</p>
<p>That slanted overstay in his wheelchair.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t breathing through a tube in his throat,</p>
<p>for example, because people with severe ALS,</p>
<p>the muscles to their diaphragm and their lungs</p>
<p>essentially give out as well.</p>
<p>They get weakness there</p>
<p>and then they can&rsquo;t breathe anymore.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another form of paralysis.</p>
<p>And so in our field,</p>
<p>these are kind of like the most devastating things</p>
<p>that can happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to really try to compare like what&rsquo;s worse,</p>
<p>you know, having a brain tumor or stroke, it&rsquo;s all bad.</p>
<p>But this condition of what we call being locked in</p>
<p>refers to this idea</p>
<p>that you can have completely intact cognition and awareness,</p>
<p>but have no way to express that.</p>
<p>No voluntary movement, no ability to speak.</p>
<p>And that is devastating because psychologically</p>
<p>and socially, you&rsquo;re completely isolated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call locked in syndrome.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s devastating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that throughout my career.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really heartbreaking because</p>
<p>you know that the person is there,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t see, they can&rsquo;t communicate.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been studying this patterning</p>
<p>of electrical activity for consonants and vowels.</p>
<p>And essentially, once we figured out a lot of these codes</p>
<p>for the individual phonetic elements,</p>
<p>we took a little bit of a detour,</p>
<p>or at least part of the lab started to focus</p>
<p>on this very specific question.</p>
<p>For people who have these kinds of paralysis,</p>
<p>could we intercept those signals from the brain,</p>
<p>the cerebral cortex,</p>
<p>as someone is trying to say those words?</p>
<p>And then can we intercept them</p>
<p>and then have them taken out of the brain</p>
<p>through wires to a computer</p>
<p>that are gonna interpret those signals</p>
<p>and translate them into words?</p>
<p>So about three years ago, we started a clinical trial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the BRAVO trial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still underway.</p>
<p>And the first participant in the BRAVO trial</p>
<p>was a man who had been paralyzed for 15 years.</p>
<p>When he was about 20 years old,</p>
<p>he came to the United States,</p>
<p>was actually working in Sonoma area,</p>
<p>and he was in a car accident.</p>
<p>And he actually walked out of the hospital</p>
<p>the day after that car accident.</p>
<p>But the next day had a complication related to it,</p>
<p>where he had a very large stroke in the brainstem.</p>
<p>And that turned out to be devastating.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t wake up from that stroke for about a week.</p>
<p>He was in a coma for about a week.</p>
<p>And when he woke up from that coma,</p>
<p>he realized that he couldn&rsquo;t speak</p>
<p>or move his arms or legs.</p>
<p>And as he told me or communicated to us,</p>
<p>that was absolutely devastating.</p>
<p>He wanted really to die at that time.</p>
<p>Could he blink his eyes or move his mouth in any way?</p>
<p>He could blink his eyes.</p>
<p>He had some limited mouth movements,</p>
<p>but couldn&rsquo;t produce any intelligible speech.</p>
<p>He was like completely slurred and incomprehensible.</p>
<p>And he survived this injury.</p>
<p>A lot of people who have that kind of stroke</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t survive.</p>
<p>But he survived.</p>
<p>And I also realized that he&rsquo;s just an incredible person,</p>
<p>like a force of nature in terms of his optimism,</p>
<p>in terms of his ability to make friends</p>
<p>despite his condition.</p>
<p>The way he actually communicates,</p>
<p>because he has a little bit of residual neck movements,</p>
<p>is that he improvised and had his friends</p>
<p>basically put a stick attached to his baseball cap.</p>
<p>Because he could move his neck,</p>
<p>he would essentially type out letters</p>
<p>on a keyboard screen to get out words.</p>
<p>In fact, this is how he communicated,</p>
<p>was through a device that he would essentially</p>
<p>peck out letters one by one by moving his neck</p>
<p>to control this stick attached to his baseball cap.</p>
<p>How many years did he use that method of communication?</p>
<p>For about 15 years.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t really spoken for about 15 years.</p>
<p>Oh, goodness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it was a devastating injury,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something to be said about the human spirit.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s anyone who embodies it, it is Pancho.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his nickname, the first participant in our trial.</p>
<p>He has that human spirit.</p>
<p>He persevered and, in fact,</p>
<p>could thrive in his community, basically, and friends,</p>
<p>being able to communicate</p>
<p>in this very slow and inefficient way.</p>
<p>Maybe part of that spirit is why he volunteered</p>
<p>to be the first person in this trial.</p>
<p>It was a clinical trial, an experiment.</p>
<p>It was a study.</p>
<p>This is not an approved therapy by any means.</p>
<p>This was really something that had not been done before.</p>
<p>And we had a lot of ideas about it,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We had proven a lot of this could be true</p>
<p>in some people who are normally speaking,</p>
<p>but to actually put into someone who&rsquo;s paralyzed,</p>
<p>number one, where we don&rsquo;t know the code is the same.</p>
<p>Number two is someone who&rsquo;s not been speaking for 15 years,</p>
<p>whether those signals are actually still there or not.</p>
<p>So it was part of a clinical trial.</p>
<p>It was something that our hospital</p>
<p>and also the FDA had to approve</p>
<p>and looked at very carefully.</p>
<p>But given a lot of the work that we had done,</p>
<p>there was some basis for why this might work.</p>
<p>And so about two and a half years ago,</p>
<p>we did a surgery where we implanted electrodes</p>
<p>onto the parts of the brain that we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>these areas that control the vocal tract,</p>
<p>the areas that control the larynx,</p>
<p>the areas that control the lips and tongue</p>
<p>and jaw movements when we normally speak.</p>
<p>These are areas that presumably may be active.</p>
<p>That was our hope in his brain,</p>
<p>but he just couldn&rsquo;t get those out</p>
<p>to control his mouth in a normal way.</p>
<p>And he underwent a surgery, a brain surgery,</p>
<p>where we put an electrode array</p>
<p>and we connected it to a port</p>
<p>that was screwed to his skull.</p>
<p>The port actually goes through his scalp</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s lived with this now for the last three years.</p>
<p>It is a risk of infection.</p>
<p>These ports eventually have to become wireless in the future</p>
<p>but we figured out a way to keep that port there</p>
<p>where we can essentially connect him to a computer</p>
<p>through that port.</p>
<p>So he has an electrode array that&rsquo;s implanted</p>
<p>over the part of his brain that&rsquo;s important for speech.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s connected to a port.</p>
<p>And then we connect a wire to that port</p>
<p>that translates those, what we call analog brainwaves</p>
<p>and converts them into digital signals.</p>
<p>And then a computer takes those digital signals</p>
<p>from those individual sites from the speech cortex</p>
<p>and translates those into words.</p>
<p>Can you describe for us the first time</p>
<p>that Poncho spoke through this engineered device?</p>
<p>What was that experience like for you?</p>
<p>And at least from what he conveyed to you,</p>
<p>what was that experience like for him?</p>
<p>Is this somebody who was essentially locked in</p>
<p>except for this rather crude pecking device?</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m thoroughly impressed by how adaptive</p>
<p>or adaptable Poncho was in his friends</p>
<p>engineering that device for him</p>
<p>was really nothing short of clever</p>
<p>because otherwise he would be truly locked in.</p>
<p>But what was that moment like?</p>
<p>I can only imagine.</p>
<p>That moment was incredible.</p>
<p>It was truly incredible to be able to see him</p>
<p>try to get out a word that was for all practical purposes</p>
<p>unintelligible, but to be able to take the brain activity</p>
<p>and to translate it into text on a screen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>We took those brainwaves.</p>
<p>We put them through machine learning</p>
<p>or artificial intelligence algorithm</p>
<p>that can pick up these very, very subtle patterns.</p>
<p>You can actually see them with your eye</p>
<p>in the brain activity and translate those into words.</p>
<p>And I remember seeing this happening for the first time.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen like immediately.</p>
<p>This is something that took weeks to train the algorithm</p>
<p>to interpret it correctly.</p>
<p>But what was incredible about it was to see how he reacted.</p>
<p>And he would be prompted to say a given word</p>
<p>like, you know, outside, for example.</p>
<p>And then he would think about it, try to say it.</p>
<p>And finally those words would appear on the screen.</p>
<p>And what was really amazing about it was</p>
<p>you could really tell that he like got a kick out of that</p>
<p>because he would start to giggle.</p>
<p>You know, his body would shake in a way</p>
<p>and his head would shake in a way</p>
<p>that he would start to giggle.</p>
<p>And that was cool to see.</p>
<p>But then I also realized that when he was giggling,</p>
<p>it kind of screwed up the next words decoding.</p>
<p>Is that a bug you&rsquo;ve since fixed?</p>
<p>No, we haven&rsquo;t fixed that.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t fixed that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier just to tell him to stop giggling.</p>
<p>So what was the first word that he said?</p>
<p>Well, I think one of the first sentences</p>
<p>that he put together was, you know,</p>
<p>can you get my family outside?</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Meaning get them out of the room?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>All these years you wanted to get away from his family?</p>
<p>No, I think what he meant was, can you get them?</p>
<p>Bring them in.</p>
<p>Bring them in.</p>
<p>And so the way this worked was we trained</p>
<p>this computer to recognize 50 words.</p>
<p>We started with a very small vocabulary</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s expanding as we speak.</p>
<p>I think that this is just a matter of time</p>
<p>before these vocabularies become much, much larger.</p>
<p>But we started with a 50 set of words.</p>
<p>We created essentially all the possible sentences</p>
<p>that you could generate from those 50 words.</p>
<p>Why that was important was you can use</p>
<p>all those possible sentences to create</p>
<p>a computational model, computer model</p>
<p>of all the different word combinations</p>
<p>to give different sentences given those 50 words.</p>
<p>And then you can essentially do what we call autocorrect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same kind of thing that we do</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re texting, for example,</p>
<p>you get the wrong letter in there,</p>
<p>but your phone actually knows, you know,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s context what to correct it.</p>
<p>So because the decoding is not 100% correct all the time,</p>
<p>in fact, it&rsquo;s far from that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really helpful to have these other features</p>
<p>like autocorrect, the stuff that we use routinely now</p>
<p>with texting that makes it correct and then updates it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a combination of a lot of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the AI that is translating</p>
<p>those brain activity patterns,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also things that we&rsquo;ve learned from speech</p>
<p>and speech technologies that, you know,</p>
<p>you put all together and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>it starts to work.</p>
<p>And so we were really excited</p>
<p>because that was the first time that someone was paralyzed</p>
<p>and could create words and sentences</p>
<p>that was just decoded from the brain activity.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>And I know you&rsquo;re very humble,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to embarrass you by saying</p>
<p>I always knew you were destined for great things</p>
<p>since the early age of nine when we first became friends.</p>
<p>But when I read that,</p>
<p>the news coverage of your work with Poncho</p>
<p>and the release of this language</p>
<p>from this locked in patient,</p>
<p>it literally, you know, it brought tears to my eyes</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting thing as fellow neuroscientists, right?</p>
<p>We explore the brain and we try and find mechanisms</p>
<p>and we try and compare those to what other people find</p>
<p>and find truths and principles and build up from those.</p>
<p>But pretty rarely is there a case where</p>
<p>that route of exploration leads</p>
<p>to something of clinical significance</p>
<p>within one&rsquo;s own lifetime.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the reality of science.</p>
<p>And oftentimes it&rsquo;s a very distributed process.</p>
<p>But in this case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a magnificent thing to see you</p>
<p>move along this trajectory,</p>
<p>parsing these language and speech areas,</p>
<p>and then to also do the clinical work in parallel.</p>
<p>Speaking of which,</p>
<p>these days we hear a lot about Neuralink,</p>
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s company,</p>
<p>a neurosurgeon that came up briefly through my lab,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t take any credit for what he knows or does,</p>
<p>which is Matt McDougall is the neurosurgeon at Neuralink.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other excellent neuroscientists there</p>
<p>and engineers there.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about Neuralink</p>
<p>because while brain machine interface</p>
<p>of the sort that you do and that other laboratories do</p>
<p>has been going on for a long time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been some press around Neuralink</p>
<p>about the promise of what brain machine interface could do.</p>
<p>For instance, early in our discussion,</p>
<p>you talked about how language is constrained</p>
<p>by these sound waves</p>
<p>and typically it&rsquo;s a few people communicating</p>
<p>or one person with many people</p>
<p>through a podcast, for instance, or a speech.</p>
<p>But the idea has been thrown out there</p>
<p>that through the use of stimulating chips</p>
<p>or through other brain machine devising</p>
<p>that perhaps one could internalize</p>
<p>50 conversations in parallel, right?</p>
<p>50X communication.</p>
<p>Or that the memory systems could be augmented</p>
<p>to remember 10 times as much information</p>
<p>or even twice as much information in a given period of time.</p>
<p>My understanding of what they&rsquo;re doing at Neuralink,</p>
<p>which is admittedly crude and from the outside,</p>
<p>few discussions with people there,</p>
<p>is that they too are going to pursue clinical goals first.</p>
<p>Things like trying to generate smooth movement</p>
<p>in a Parkinsonian patient.</p>
<p>Trying to adjust movement patterns</p>
<p>in someone with Huntington&rsquo;s disease, for instance.</p>
<p>Things of that sort.</p>
<p>Before they embark on the more sci-fi-like explorations</p>
<p>of 50Xing communication or doubling memory capacity</p>
<p>and these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>they may be doing all of those things in parallel.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about super capabilities of the brain</p>
<p>or super, I don&rsquo;t even know what word to use.</p>
<p>Supercharging the brain.</p>
<p>Giving the brain functions</p>
<p>for which we&rsquo;ve never observed before in human history.</p>
<p>But we have our Einsteins and our Feynmans</p>
<p>and our Merzenichs and the, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear who to put in along that line, side by side.</p>
<p>But there are some, there are Michael Jordans and et cetera.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve never heard of or seen somebody</p>
<p>who can jump 20 feet in the air.</p>
<p>Or we&rsquo;ve heard of people who have photographic memories,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know that we are aware</p>
<p>of any human being in history</p>
<p>who could memorize the entire Library of Congress</p>
<p>or all the works within the Vatican within an hour.</p>
<p>Anyway, you get the idea.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about manipulating neural circuitry</p>
<p>to achieve superhuman or superhuman</p>
<p>or super physiological functions?</p>
<p>Are we there or should we even be thinking about that?</p>
<p>Is it possible, given that neurons simply communicate</p>
<p>through electrical activity and electrical activity</p>
<p>can be engineered outside of the brain?</p>
<p>How do you think about it?</p>
<p>And here we don&rsquo;t even have to think about Neuralink</p>
<p>in particular, it&rsquo;s just but one example</p>
<p>of companies and people in laboratories</p>
<p>that are quite understandably considering all this.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a really interesting time right now.</p>
<p>The science has been going on for decades.</p>
<p>The work that we&rsquo;ve done in this field</p>
<p>that you call brain machine interface,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been going on for a while.</p>
<p>And a lot of the early work was just trying</p>
<p>to restore things like our movement</p>
<p>or having people or monkeys control a computer cursor,</p>
<p>for example, on the screen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been going on for decades.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been really new is that industry is now involved</p>
<p>and some of this is now becoming commercialized</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re starting to see us now cross over to this field</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s no longer just research</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about medical products</p>
<p>that are designed to be surgically implanted.</p>
<p>In some cases, there&rsquo;s people doing this kind of work</p>
<p>non-invasively as well that don&rsquo;t require surgery.</p>
<p>The specific question that you&rsquo;re asking about</p>
<p>is an area that we call augmentation.</p>
<p>So can you build a device</p>
<p>that essentially enhances someone&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>beyond super normal, super memory,</p>
<p>super communication speeds beyond speech, for example?</p>
<p>Or I guess superior precision athletic abilities?</p>
<p>I think that these are very serious kind of questions</p>
<p>to be asking now because as you mentioned,</p>
<p>the pathway so far is really to focus</p>
<p>on these medical applications.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;ve thought enough actually</p>
<p>about what these kind of scenarios are gonna look like.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve thought through</p>
<p>all the ethical implications of what this means</p>
<p>for augmentation in particular.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s part of this that is not new at all.</p>
<p>Humans throughout history have been doing things</p>
<p>to augment our function.</p>
<p>Coffee, nicotine, all kinds of things,</p>
<p>all kinds of medications that cross over</p>
<p>from medical to consumer, that is everywhere.</p>
<p>So the pursuit of augmentation or performance</p>
<p>or enhancement is really not a new thing.</p>
<p>The questions really, as they relate to neurotechnologies,</p>
<p>for example, have to do with the invasive nature.</p>
<p>For example, if these technologies require surgery,</p>
<p>for example, to do something</p>
<p>that is not for a medical application.</p>
<p>Again, there, that is not exactly new territory either.</p>
<p>People do that routinely for cosmetic kind of procedures,</p>
<p>for physical appearance, not necessarily cognitive.</p>
<p>So I do think that provided the technology continues</p>
<p>to emerge the way that it does,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna be around the corner.</p>
<p>And it probably is not gonna be in ways</p>
<p>that are super obvious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be like,</p>
<p>can we easily memorize every fact in the world?</p>
<p>But in forms that are gonna be much more incremental</p>
<p>and maybe more subtle, in many ways,</p>
<p>we already have that now.</p>
<p>Like, for example, you don&rsquo;t have to have</p>
<p>a neural interface embedded in your brain</p>
<p>to get information, essentially access</p>
<p>to all information in the world.</p>
<p>You just have to have your iPhone.</p>
<p>Whether you could do it faster through a brain interface,</p>
<p>I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t rule that out.</p>
<p>But think about this, that the systems that we have already</p>
<p>to speak and to communicate have evolved</p>
<p>over thousands and millions of years.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re supported by neural structures</p>
<p>that have bandwidth of millions of neurons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no technology that exists right now</p>
<p>that people are thinking about</p>
<p>that are in commercial form, certainly.</p>
<p>Not even in research labs that come anywhere close</p>
<p>to what has been evolved for those natural purposes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m essentially saying two sides of this,</p>
<p>which is we&rsquo;re already getting into this now.</p>
<p>This is not new territory.</p>
<p>This topic of augmentation, both physical and cognitive,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve already surpassed that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of what humans do in general.</p>
<p>But we are entering this area of, like,</p>
<p>enhanced cognition, these areas that I think</p>
<p>the technology is gonna be the rate-limiting step</p>
<p>in how far you can go.</p>
<p>We have not had the full conversations about,</p>
<p>number one, is this what we actually want?</p>
<p>Is this gonna be good for society?</p>
<p>Who gets access to this technology?</p>
<p>These are all things that are gonna become</p>
<p>real-world problems.</p>
<p>Certainly a lot to consider.</p>
<p>In thinking about augmentation and another theme</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve yet to ask you about,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m extremely curious about, which is facial expressions.</p>
<p>Before we talk about the relationship</p>
<p>between the musculature of the face and language</p>
<p>and the communication of emotion,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to, if you would,</p>
<p>touch on a little bit of what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with patients like Poncho to move beyond</p>
<p>somebody who&rsquo;s locked in being able to type out</p>
<p>words on a screen with their thoughts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a rich array of information contained</p>
<p>within the face and facial expression.</p>
<p>And while somebody like Poncho going from having to,</p>
<p>you know, be completely locked in</p>
<p>to being able to peck out letters on a keyboard,</p>
<p>to being able to just think of those letters</p>
<p>and having them spelled out,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tremendous set of leaps forward towards normalcy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still far and away different</p>
<p>than Poncho speaking with his mouth,</p>
<p>which I think knowing some people who are restricted,</p>
<p>who are quadriplegic, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of what they struggle with in the real world</p>
<p>is actually a height difference sometimes</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re seated while other people are standing.</p>
<p>This actually, we don&rsquo;t often think about this,</p>
<p>but always have to look up to communicate with people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very different interface in the world.</p>
<p>They manage quite well, of course.</p>
<p>But could you tell us what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in terms of merging the brain machine interface</p>
<p>with extraction of speech signals</p>
<p>from people who are locked in like Poncho</p>
<p>with facial expressions?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, like we described before,</p>
<p>progress is being made.</p>
<p>The proof of principle is out there</p>
<p>that you can decode speech.</p>
<p>That will continue to optimize.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very confident that that&rsquo;s gonna improve</p>
<p>very, very quickly in the coming years</p>
<p>to the point where it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>not just a small vocabulary, but a large vocabulary</p>
<p>and at reasonable rates,</p>
<p>at a level that&rsquo;s gonna be really helpful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very optimistic about that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the right time to start really thinking about</p>
<p>a broader vision of what communication really is.</p>
<p>So for example, I&rsquo;m here with you in person.</p>
<p>We could have done this virtually, probably.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy to do that.</p>
<p>We could have recorded this really separate,</p>
<p>but there is something about being able</p>
<p>to actually see your expressions</p>
<p>and to understand other forms of communication.</p>
<p>So another really important one is nonverbal,</p>
<p>the expressions that you&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>You know, for example,</p>
<p>if you have a quizzical look on your face,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m saying something not clear,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a sign to me that I need to rephrase it</p>
<p>or to say it in a different way or to slow down.</p>
<p>For example, or if there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that really excites you,</p>
<p>I want to continue to say more about it</p>
<p>and talk more in detail, you know,</p>
<p>essentially about a given thing.</p>
<p>So facial expressions actually are a really important part</p>
<p>of the way we speak.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the expressions of like how you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>and perceiving what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also seeing my mouth move.</p>
<p>In your eyes, I actually see my mouth move</p>
<p>and my jaw move in a particular way</p>
<p>that actually allows you to hear those sounds better.</p>
<p>So having both the visual information,</p>
<p>but also the sounds go into your brain</p>
<p>is going to improve intelligibly,</p>
<p>also make it more natural.</p>
<p>And memory for what is spoken?</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a call for people,</p>
<p>not just listening to podcasts,</p>
<p>but watching them and listening to them on YouTube,</p>
<p>I suppose, if we were to sort of translate this</p>
<p>to the real world.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And the reason why we&rsquo;re also very interested</p>
<p>in this idea of not just having text on a screen,</p>
<p>but essentially a fully computer animated face,</p>
<p>like an avatar of the person&rsquo;s speech movements</p>
<p>and their facial expressions</p>
<p>is going to be a more complete form of expression.</p>
<p>Now you can imagine right now,</p>
<p>that might just be someone looking at a computer screen,</p>
<p>interpreting these signals.</p>
<p>But I think the way things are going</p>
<p>in the next couple of years,</p>
<p>a lot more of our social interactions,</p>
<p>more than even now,</p>
<p>are going to move into this digital virtual space.</p>
<p>And of course, most people are thinking about</p>
<p>what that means for most consumers,</p>
<p>but it also has really important implications</p>
<p>for people who are disabled, right?</p>
<p>And how are they going to participate in that?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re thinking really about for people like Pancho</p>
<p>and other people who are paralyzed,</p>
<p>what other forms of BCI can we do</p>
<p>in order to help improve their ability to communicate?</p>
<p>So one is essentially building out more holistic avatars,</p>
<p>you know, things that can essentially decode,</p>
<p>you know, essentially their expressions</p>
<p>or the movements associated with their mouth and jaw</p>
<p>when they actually speak to improve that communication.</p>
<p>So do you envision a time not too long from now</p>
<p>where instead of tweeting out something in text,</p>
<p>my avatar will, I&rsquo;ll type it out,</p>
<p>but my avatar will just say it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be an image of my avatar saying whatever it is</p>
<p>I happen to be tweeting at that moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re working on, yeah.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that that is going to happen</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to happen soon.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of progress in that.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re just trying to enrich</p>
<p>the field of, you know, of communication expression</p>
<p>to make it more normal.</p>
<p>And we actually think that having that kind of avatar</p>
<p>is a way of getting feedback to people</p>
<p>learning how to speak through a speech neuroprosthetic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the device that we call it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a speech neuroprosthetic.</p>
<p>That is going to be the way that can help people</p>
<p>learn how to do it the quickest,</p>
<p>not necessarily like trying to say words</p>
<p>and having it come on a screen,</p>
<p>but actually have people embody,</p>
<p>feel like it&rsquo;s part of themselves</p>
<p>or that they are directly controlling</p>
<p>that illustration or animation.</p>
<p>This idea of an avatar speaking out</p>
<p>what we would otherwise write</p>
<p>is fascinating to me on Instagram.</p>
<p>I post videos.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t filter them,</p>
<p>but I know there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion nowadays</p>
<p>about people using filters</p>
<p>to make their skin look different</p>
<p>or the lighting look different,</p>
<p>a lot of filtering and also the use of captions.</p>
<p>So that essentially what you end up with</p>
<p>is somewhere between an actual raw video</p>
<p>of what was spoken and an avatar version of it.</p>
<p>I mean, if the mismatch between what&rsquo;s spoken</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s in the caption is too dramatic,</p>
<p>then it doesn&rsquo;t quite work.</p>
<p>But I watch these carefully when people use captions.</p>
<p>And oftentimes there&rsquo;s a smoothing</p>
<p>of what was said into the caption.</p>
<p>So it seems much more succinct and accurate.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the reverse is also true</p>
<p>where the caption is inaccurate</p>
<p>and then it creates this kind of jarring mismatch.</p>
<p>In any case, I think this aspect in the clinical realm</p>
<p>of using an avatar to allow people like Poncho</p>
<p>to essentially be a face that communicates</p>
<p>through spoken language from an avatar</p>
<p>that looks like them is fascinating and indeed important.</p>
<p>And I think how avatars emerge in social spaces</p>
<p>is going to be really fascinating.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions about stutter.</p>
<p>I think that for people who have a stutter,</p>
<p>it is itself anxiety provoking.</p>
<p>Is stutter related to anxiety?</p>
<p>If one has a stutter, what can they do?</p>
<p>Does stutter reflect some underlying neurologic phenomenon</p>
<p>that might distinguish between one kind of stutter</p>
<p>and another?</p>
<p>What can people with stutter do</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;d like to relieve their stutter?</p>
<p>Yeah, great question.</p>
<p>Stutter is a condition</p>
<p>where the words can&rsquo;t come out fluently.</p>
<p>So you have all the ideas, you&rsquo;ve got the language intact.</p>
<p>You remember we talked about this distinction</p>
<p>between language and speech.</p>
<p>Stuttering is a problem of speech, right?</p>
<p>So the ideas, the meanings, the grammar,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all there in people&rsquo;s stutter,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t get the words out fluently.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a speech condition.</p>
<p>And in particular,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a condition that affects articulation,</p>
<p>specifically about controlling the production of words</p>
<p>in this really coordinated kind of movements</p>
<p>that have to happen in the vocal tract</p>
<p>to produce fluent speech.</p>
<p>And stuttering is a condition</p>
<p>where people have a predisposition to it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an aspect of stuttering.</p>
<p>You are a stutterer or you&rsquo;re not a stutterer, right?</p>
<p>But people who stutter don&rsquo;t stutter all the time either.</p>
<p>So you could be a stutterer who stutters at some times,</p>
<p>but not others.</p>
<p>And really the main link between stuttering and anxiety</p>
<p>is that anxiety can provoke it and make it worse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly true,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not necessarily caused by anxiety.</p>
<p>It can essentially trigger it or make it worse,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the cause of it per se.</p>
<p>So the cause of it is still really not clear,</p>
<p>but it does have to do with these kind of brain functions</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about earlier,</p>
<p>which is that in order to produce normal fluent speech,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not even conscious of what is going on</p>
<p>in our mouths, in our larynx.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not conscious.</p>
<p>And if we were, we would not be able to speak</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too complex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too precise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that we have really developed</p>
<p>the abilities to do and we do it naturally, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of our programming</p>
<p>and part of what we learn inherently,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just through exposure.</p>
<p>So stuttering is essentially a breakdown</p>
<p>at certain times in that machinery,</p>
<p>being able to work in a really coordinated way.</p>
<p>You can think about the operations of these areas</p>
<p>that are controlling the vocal tract.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say speech is like a symphony.</p>
<p>In order for it to come out normally,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to have not just one part,</p>
<p>the larynx, but the lips, the jaw.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t be doing their own thing.</p>
<p>They have to be very, very precisely activated</p>
<p>and very, very precisely controlled</p>
<p>in a way to actually create words.</p>
<p>And so in stuttering,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a breakdown of that coordination.</p>
<p>If somebody has a stutter,</p>
<p>is it better to address that early in life</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s still neuroplasticity that is very robust?</p>
<p>And if so, what&rsquo;s the typical route for treatment?</p>
<p>I have to imagine it&rsquo;s not brain surgery, typically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing there are speech therapists</p>
<p>that people can talk to and they can help them work out</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re getting stuck</p>
<p>in their relationship to anxiety.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, part of it is about that anxiety,</p>
<p>but a lot of it really has to do with therapy</p>
<p>to sort of like work through and think of tricks,</p>
<p>basically, sometimes to create conditions</p>
<p>where you can actually get the words to come out.</p>
<p>A lot of, some forms of stuttering</p>
<p>are really initiation problems.</p>
<p>Just getting started itself is very hard.</p>
<p>You want to start with the initial vowel or consonant,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t emit.</p>
<p>And so a lot of that therapy is really just focusing</p>
<p>on like how do you create the conditions</p>
<p>for that to happen?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another aspect to it</p>
<p>that I find very interesting is that the feedback,</p>
<p>essentially what we hear ourselves say, for example,</p>
<p>and every time that I say a word,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also hearing what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we call auditory feedback.</p>
<p>That turns out to be very important.</p>
<p>And sometimes when you change that,</p>
<p>it can actually change the amount someone stutters</p>
<p>for better or for worse.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s giving us a clue that the brain</p>
<p>is not just focused on sending the commands out,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also possibly interacting with the part</p>
<p>that is hearing the sounds.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something might be going on in that connection</p>
<p>that breaks down when stuttering occurs.</p>
<p>So there are individuals that are stutterers,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t stutter all the time.</p>
<p>In those instances, there&rsquo;s something happening</p>
<p>in those particular moments</p>
<p>where this very, very precise coordination needs to happen</p>
<p>in the brain in order to get the words out fluently.</p>
<p>We talked a little bit about caffeine and why you avoid it</p>
<p>because your work requires such precision and calm.</p>
<p>And frankly, to me,</p>
<p>it seems like you&rsquo;re running a lot of operations</p>
<p>and no pun intended in parallel when you&rsquo;re doing surgery,</p>
<p>not just thinking about where to direct the instruments,</p>
<p>but also thinking like a chess player,</p>
<p>several steps down the line, what could happen?</p>
<p>What if, if then type thinking.</p>
<p>What are some of the other practices and tools</p>
<p>that you use to put yourself into state</p>
<p>for optimal neurosurgery or for, you know,</p>
<p>thinking about scientific problems for that matter.</p>
<p>We keep threatening to go running together,</p>
<p>but I know you run, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you find running to be an essential part</p>
<p>of your state regulation?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for me, most exercise that I do,</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t do for physical reasons.</p>
<p>I do it for mental reasons.</p>
<p>I can tell, for example,</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t go on a run or a swim just after a day or two</p>
<p>and it can have translation, for example,</p>
<p>and the way I feel in the operating room</p>
<p>or even the way I interact with other people.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no question that those, you know,</p>
<p>the mind and body are deeply connected.</p>
<p>And for me personally,</p>
<p>being able to have opportunity to disconnect for a while,</p>
<p>it turns out to be really, really important.</p>
<p>Now, the operating room for me is another space,</p>
<p>kind of like running or swimming,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m disconnected from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t bring my cell phone into the operating room.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disconnected from the external world</p>
<p>for that time that I&rsquo;m in the surgery.</p>
<p>And all I am doing is just focusing.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m having complex thoughts</p>
<p>or doing something very complicated.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is like that, but it&rsquo;s not always like that.</p>
<p>There are things that we do in surgery</p>
<p>that are like routine and rote</p>
<p>and are from muscle memory.</p>
<p>So for example, suturing skin</p>
<p>or doing certain kinds of dissection</p>
<p>or drilling part of the bone, for example,</p>
<p>these are all things that become very rote after a time.</p>
<p>So for me, even being in the operating room</p>
<p>actually can sometimes fulfill that purpose.</p>
<p>So I really look forward to being in the operating room</p>
<p>because that intense focus</p>
<p>allows me to sort of disconnect</p>
<p>from all the other things that I&rsquo;m worrying about</p>
<p>that are happening on the outside world.</p>
<p>We all have those kinds of things that happen,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certainly no exception to that.</p>
<p>But strangely, the operating room for me is a sanctuary.</p>
<p>I love being there</p>
<p>because we have some control over the environment.</p>
<p>I know what is there.</p>
<p>I know the anatomy of the brain.</p>
<p>My motions are going through routines.</p>
<p>And so for me, that&rsquo;s not actually very different</p>
<p>than going on a run and letting my legs</p>
<p>move in specific ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the same thing for my hands.</p>
<p>Do you listen to music or audio books when you run</p>
<p>or are you divorced from technology when you run?</p>
<p>Well, music helps me just stay motivated</p>
<p>and distracted from being out of breath and other things.</p>
<p>And for me, it&rsquo;s a way just to catch up with the world.</p>
<p>So sometimes I do,</p>
<p>but I do notice that I don&rsquo;t run as well, for example.</p>
<p>In the operating room, it&rsquo;s a little different.</p>
<p>Different surgeons have preferences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more of the camp</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t like any distraction whatsoever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like people to be able to hear the words</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m saying without having background noise.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think about relying on music</p>
<p>or other things to try to put me in a state of mind.</p>
<p>I think just being there alone</p>
<p>and just trying to treat it the way it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sacred moment where someone&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>is really directly under your hands.</p>
<p>That enough kind of focuses me very quickly.</p>
<p>And I like that.</p>
<p>It really detaches me from a lot of things</p>
<p>that are preoccupying me.</p>
<p>And for those couple of hours that we have a surgery,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just focused on one thing only.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>Again, I think of in the range of brain explorers,</p>
<p>the neurosurgeons, those of your profession,</p>
<p>are to me like the astronauts of neuroscience</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re really going</p>
<p>to the farthest reaches possible</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re testing and probing</p>
<p>and really at the front edge of discovering</p>
<p>from the species that we arguably care about the most,</p>
<p>which is humans.</p>
<p>Eddie, I have to say,</p>
<p>from the first time we became friends, 38 years ago.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost reluctant to say,</p>
<p>but so I only reveal it in part</p>
<p>that Eddie and I became friends</p>
<p>because both he and I shared a love of birds</p>
<p>and we had a club at our school</p>
<p>of which there were only two members, Eddie and I.</p>
<p>Small club.</p>
<p>Small club.</p>
<p>There was one honorary member</p>
<p>and there were certain requirements</p>
<p>for being in this club that we won&rsquo;t reveal.</p>
<p>We took a pact of secrecy</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to obey that pact of secrecy.</p>
<p>But to be sitting here with you today</p>
<p>for me is a absolute thrill,</p>
<p>not just because we&rsquo;ve been friends for that long</p>
<p>or that we got reacquainted</p>
<p>through literally the halls of medicine and science,</p>
<p>but because I really do see what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>as really representing that front,</p>
<p>absolute cutting edge of exploration and application.</p>
<p>I mean, the story of Poncho is about one</p>
<p>of your many patients</p>
<p>that has derived tremendous benefit from your work.</p>
<p>And now as a chair of a department,</p>
<p>you of course work alongside individuals</p>
<p>who are also doing incredible work</p>
<p>in the spinal cord, et cetera.</p>
<p>So on behalf of myself and everyone listening,</p>
<p>I just really want to thank you</p>
<p>for joining us today to share this information.</p>
<p>We will certainly have you back</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an entire list of other questions</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have time to get to,</p>
<p>but also just for the work you do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly spectacular.</p>
<p>Andrew, thanks so much.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m very humbled basically</p>
<p>by what you just said.</p>
<p>And I feel that it&rsquo;s really an extraordinary honor,</p>
<p>actually, and privileged, you know,</p>
<p>to be here with you and reconnect</p>
<p>and talk about all these ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not random, you know,</p>
<p>that we ended up in similar spots and interests.</p>
<p>I think when we were kids, you know,</p>
<p>it starts with some deep interests</p>
<p>and kind of nerding out on topics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably not a coincidence, you know,</p>
<p>that we have such deep interests in this work now.</p>
<p>I just feel really lucky to be able to do what I do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun every day, almost every day,</p>
<p>be able to go to work and take care of folks</p>
<p>and learn at the same time,</p>
<p>and then just close the loop.</p>
<p>You know, how do we apply the knowledge</p>
<p>that we learn one day to someone who comes in next week?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fun.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not even close to it.</p>
<p>But the journey to figure this out is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really extraordinary.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, like you said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exploring new lands,</p>
<p>literally in the operating room</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m looking at the exposed cortex,</p>
<p>trying to understand,</p>
<p>is it safe to walk down this part of the cortical landscape</p>
<p>or this other trail?</p>
<p>You know, which one is gonna be the one</p>
<p>that is gonna be safe versus the other</p>
<p>that results in paralysis and inability to talk?</p>
<p>Well, maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t call it fun,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very important too,</p>
<p>in addition to being really intellectually important</p>
<p>for how we understand how the brain works.</p>
<p>And so, yeah,</p>
<p>I feel just really lucky to be in that opportunity.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re lucky to have you being one of the people</p>
<p>doing it, so thank you ever so much.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like enhancing sleep and focus</p>
<p>and hormone optimization.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has partnered with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that the Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered</p>
<p>with Momentous on, you can go to livemomentous,</p>
<p>spelled O-U-S, so livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
