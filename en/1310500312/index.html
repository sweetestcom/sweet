    <p>How are these interacting with our fighters if they are?</p>
<p>How are they interacting with the weather</p>
<p>and their environment?</p>
<p>How are they interacting with each other?</p>
<p>So can we look at these and how they&rsquo;re interacting</p>
<p>perhaps as a swarm?</p>
<p>Especially off the East Coast where this is happening</p>
<p>all the time with multiple objects.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation</p>
<p>with Lieutenant Ryan Graves,</p>
<p>former Navy fighter pilot,</p>
<p>including roles as a combat lead,</p>
<p>landing signals officer and rescue mission commander.</p>
<p>He and people in his squadron detected UFOs</p>
<p>on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>And he has been one of the few people</p>
<p>willing to speak publicly about these experiences</p>
<p>and about the importance of investigating these sightings,</p>
<p>especially for national security reasons.</p>
<p>Ryan has a degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering</p>
<p>from WPI and an interest in career roles</p>
<p>in advanced technology development,</p>
<p>including multiagent collaborative autonomy,</p>
<p>machine learning assisted air to air combat,</p>
<p>manned and unmanned teaming technologies,</p>
<p>and most recently, development of materials</p>
<p>through quantum simulation.</p>
<p>This is a Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Ryan Graves.</p>
<p>What did you think of the new Top Gun movie?</p>
<p>How accurate was it?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start there.</p>
<p>I thought the flying was really accurate.</p>
<p>I thought the type of flying they did</p>
<p>and how they approached the actual mission,</p>
<p>of course, had a lot of liberties.</p>
<p>But one thing that seems to be hard to capture</p>
<p>on these types of things are the chess game that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>while that type of flying is happening.</p>
<p>The chess game between, like in a dog fight,</p>
<p>between the pilots and the enemy,</p>
<p>or between the different pilots?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll even speak to just that particular mission.</p>
<p>They flew there.</p>
<p>And for that particular mission,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a chess game with yourself</p>
<p>to get everything in place.</p>
<p>So what kind of flight they flew</p>
<p>is called a high threat scenario,</p>
<p>which means they have to ingress low</p>
<p>due to the surface to air threats,</p>
<p>the integrated air defense systems that are nearby.</p>
<p>And they have to ingress low and pop up</p>
<p>like we see in the movie.</p>
<p>And in that particular movie,</p>
<p>that was a preplanned strike.</p>
<p>They knew exactly where they were going.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a scenario where we have to operate</p>
<p>in that type of environment,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know exactly where we&rsquo;re going to strike</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re going to be adapting to real time targets.</p>
<p>And so in that scenario, you would have</p>
<p>one of those fighters down low like that</p>
<p>operating as a mission commander,</p>
<p>as a forward air controller.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s out there calling shots,</p>
<p>joining on those other players</p>
<p>in order to ensure they&rsquo;re pointed at the right target.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a bit of the chess game that he&rsquo;ll be playing.</p>
<p>Can you actually describe for people</p>
<p>who haven&rsquo;t seen the movie what the mission actually is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s involved in the mission?</p>
<p>So in this particular mission,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of what we would call a preplanned strike.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a known location</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in a heavily defended area.</p>
<p>And the air crew, in this case,</p>
<p>I believe it was four F18s on the initial package,</p>
<p>their job was to ingress very low down a canyon</p>
<p>to stay out of the radar window of the surface</p>
<p>to air threats.</p>
<p>What does ingress mean?</p>
<p>Ingress means that they&rsquo;re going to be pushing</p>
<p>from a start location towards the target or the objective.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an ingress portion of the mission</p>
<p>and an egress portion of the mission.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Like the entrance and the exit type of thing.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But it changes our mindset tactically quite a bit, right?</p>
<p>Cause when we&rsquo;re entering someplace,</p>
<p>we have the option to enter.</p>
<p>But when we go drop a bomb on location, we&rsquo;re exiting.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that luxury.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that option.</p>
<p>So it actually changes our tactics and our aggression level.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And so they were flying low to the ground</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a surface to air missiles</p>
<p>that forced them to have to fly low.</p>
<p>Is that a realistic thing?</p>
<p>It is realistic.</p>
<p>So driving those aircraft in the clutter,</p>
<p>you know, all radar systems or most I should say</p>
<p>are essentially line of sight.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re going to be limited by the horizon</p>
<p>or any clutter out there.</p>
<p>And even a number of radars, if they are located up high</p>
<p>and looking down towards that aircraft,</p>
<p>the clutter or all the objects such as trees and canyons</p>
<p>can have effect on radar systems.</p>
<p>And so it can be a type of camouflage.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a camouflage for the radar,</p>
<p>but what about the surface to air missile?</p>
<p>Is that a legitimate way to avoid missiles flies so low,</p>
<p>like fly I guess below their level?</p>
<p>As far as I know, you know,</p>
<p>you can fly under any radar right now.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have necessarily radars</p>
<p>that can look through anything.</p>
<p>So there is always going to be the ability to mask yourself,</p>
<p>but with a larger number of assets</p>
<p>and distributed communication networks,</p>
<p>where those radars are looking,</p>
<p>it makes all the difference.</p>
<p>And I said, they&rsquo;re ingressing past an IAS</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an integrated air defense system.</p>
<p>And that linking of air defense systems</p>
<p>is what makes it so hard, so complicated</p>
<p>is that the sensors and the weapons</p>
<p>are disassociated from each other.</p>
<p>So that if you took out the target that was shooting at you,</p>
<p>it still has ability to intercept you</p>
<p>from another radar location.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s distributed and it&rsquo;s stronger that way.</p>
<p>You mean the surface to air missiles,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a distributed system</p>
<p>in that if you take out one,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still able to sort of integrate information</p>
<p>about your location and strike at you.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of complication that can go,</p>
<p>you know, once we start thinking about</p>
<p>distributed systems like that</p>
<p>and the ability to self heal and repair</p>
<p>and adapt to losses, it&rsquo;s an interesting area.</p>
<p>Are you responsible for thinking about that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re flying an airplane?</p>
<p>To some degree, when we ingress to an area like that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re presented with information about targets,</p>
<p>air to air or air to surface,</p>
<p>or surface to air, I should say.</p>
<p>And we can essentially see where essentially</p>
<p>the danger zone, if you will, is located.</p>
<p>And so essentially we would stay out of that.</p>
<p>And so having a full picture of the environment</p>
<p>is extremely important because, you know,</p>
<p>at the end of the day, if we go in that circle,</p>
<p>we can die pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s absolutely crucial.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s regions that have higher and lower danger</p>
<p>based on your understanding of the actual,</p>
<p>whatever the surface to air missiles systems are.</p>
<p>So you can kind of know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I wonder how automated that could be too,</p>
<p>especially when you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It seems like in the movie they knew</p>
<p>the location of everything.</p>
<p>I imagine that&rsquo;s less known in most cases.</p>
<p>And also, a lot of those systems</p>
<p>might be a little bit more ghetto</p>
<p>if I can use that technical term.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve gotten, ad hoc maybe is the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But having just recently visited Ukraine</p>
<p>and seen a lot of aspects of the way that war is fought,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of improvised type of systems.</p>
<p>So you take high tech, like advanced technology,</p>
<p>but the way you deploy it and the way you organize it</p>
<p>is very improvised and ad hoc and is responding</p>
<p>to the uncertainty and the dynamic environment.</p>
<p>And so from an enemy perspective</p>
<p>or whoever&rsquo;s trying to deal with that kind of system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to figure it out.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like me, I played tennis for a long time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always easier to play,</p>
<p>this is true for all sports,</p>
<p>play tennis against a good tennis player</p>
<p>versus a crappy tennis player.</p>
<p>Because the crappy tennis player is full of uncertainty.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>It seemed like in the movie the systems</p>
<p>were really well organized.</p>
<p>And so you could plan.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very nice ravine</p>
<p>that went right down the middle of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how movies work, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But no, I absolutely agree.</p>
<p>So what you say is a very good point.</p>
<p>And if we were to take a chunk of airspace</p>
<p>and break it up into little bits,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be places that are better to fly</p>
<p>or less good to fly.</p>
<p>And we are seeing that now</p>
<p>with what they call manned unmanned teaming.</p>
<p>We see tactical aircraft or some type of aircraft</p>
<p>or platform that&rsquo;s being automated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not being automated in traditional sense</p>
<p>where people think aircrew are flying them around</p>
<p>to conduct missions.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very high level objective orientated</p>
<p>mission planning that allows the aircrew</p>
<p>to act more as a mission planner,</p>
<p>mission commander versus having to just pick</p>
<p>the right assets or fly them around</p>
<p>or manipulate them somewhat physically.</p>
<p>So actually going back to the chess thing,</p>
<p>can you elaborate on what you mean</p>
<p>by playing a game of chess with yourself?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, when you&rsquo;re flying that mission,</p>
<p>what exactly do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a few people you&rsquo;re usually fighting against</p>
<p>in the air, you know, there&rsquo;s the bad guys</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s physics and mother nature, right?</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re down at about 100 feet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a chess game to stay alive for the pilot</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a chess game for the whizzo</p>
<p>to process the information he needs</p>
<p>and then communicate it to all those other aircraft</p>
<p>that were flying around to ensure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re putting their weapons on the right target.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the whizzo?</p>
<p>Wizzo is a weapons systems officer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a backseater who is not a pilot,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re responsible for radar manipulation</p>
<p>and communications and weapons appointments</p>
<p>of certain natures.</p>
<p>So the chess game is against physics,</p>
<p>against the enemy.</p>
<p>Time.</p>
<p>Time, what about your own psychology, fear, uncertainty?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s no time for that type of self reflection</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re flying.</p>
<p>I want to get to that, but I don&rsquo;t want to forget</p>
<p>the point that you made about increased randomness</p>
<p>being a tactical advantage.</p>
<p>You know, as we, as you mentioned, you know,</p>
<p>you can introduce autonomy into there</p>
<p>and when you bring autonomy in there</p>
<p>and my expectation would be as we bring different abilities</p>
<p>and machine learning, as we gather more data,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be able to bring the tactical environment</p>
<p>around that jet, the war space that it goes into</p>
<p>will almost be at a stochastic level from the enemy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>perspective, where it&rsquo;ll almost seem like</p>
<p>every tactical environment they go in will be random</p>
<p>and yet very deadly because the system is providing</p>
<p>a new tactical solution essentially</p>
<p>for that particular scenario.</p>
<p>Instead of just training to particular tactics</p>
<p>that have to be repeatable and trainable and lethal, right?</p>
<p>But not necessarily the most lethal</p>
<p>because they have to be trainable.</p>
<p>But if we can introduce AI into that</p>
<p>and to have a level of randomness</p>
<p>or at least appearance of randomness due to complexity,</p>
<p>you know, I would consider it like a stochastic</p>
<p>tactical advantage because even our own blue fighters</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be able to engage in that fight</p>
<p>because it would be unsafe essentially for anything else.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where we have to drive to</p>
<p>because otherwise it&rsquo;s always this chicken and mouse</p>
<p>cat game about who&rsquo;s tactics and who knows what.</p>
<p>But if knowledge is no longer a factor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to make things a lot different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So out of the many things that are part of your expertise,</p>
<p>your journey, you&rsquo;re also working on autonomous</p>
<p>and semi autonomous systems, the use of AI</p>
<p>and machine learning and manned on man team</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying sort of when people think about</p>
<p>the use of AI in war, in military systems,</p>
<p>they think about like computer vision for perception</p>
<p>or processing of sensor information</p>
<p>in order to extract from it actionable knowledge</p>
<p>kind of thing.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying you could also use it to generate</p>
<p>randomness that&rsquo;s difficult to work with</p>
<p>in like a game theoretic way.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s difficult for human operators to respond to.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, so back to Tom Cruise and Tom Gunn.</p>
<p>What about the dog fighting?</p>
<p>What aspects of that were accurate?</p>
<p>So dog fighting is kind of an interesting conversation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not the most tactically relevant skill set</p>
<p>nowadays by traditional standards</p>
<p>because the ranges with which we engage</p>
<p>and play weapons are very significant.</p>
<p>And so if we&rsquo;re in a scenario where we&rsquo;re in a dog fight</p>
<p>like that, a lot of things have probably gone wrong, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of how this mission was set up, right?</p>
<p>It was a no win type scenario, most likely.</p>
<p>And so for a dog fight, the aircraft size</p>
<p>and the ranges and the turn radiuses</p>
<p>make it so it&rsquo;s not very theatrical, right?</p>
<p>The aircraft looks small.</p>
<p>And while it&rsquo;s intense with the systems I have</p>
<p>and the sensors and what I&rsquo;m feeling and all that,</p>
<p>if I, you know, we&rsquo;ve done it and we&rsquo;ve done it, right?</p>
<p>We take video of that and it&rsquo;s just like a blue sky</p>
<p>and you see a little dot out there.</p>
<p>So not very interesting.</p>
<p>And so anytime it really looks interesting</p>
<p>in dog fight arena, that&rsquo;s most likely a fiction</p>
<p>because we really only get close for a millisecond</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re dipping past each other at the merge.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re breaking my heart, right?</p>
<p>I know, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re breaking my heart.</p>
<p>No, I understand.</p>
<p>In a dog fight, you can go and have fun,</p>
<p>but you know, in a dog fight specifically.</p>
<p>Maybe that was more common in the earlier wars,</p>
<p>the World War II and before that,</p>
<p>where the, is it due to the sort of the range</p>
<p>and the effectiveness of the weapon systems involved?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And the accuracy of the targeting systems at range.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a train of thought</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t actually been tested out yet,</p>
<p>which is with the advent of advanced electronic warfare,</p>
<p>EW and or unmanned assets,</p>
<p>the battle space may get so complex</p>
<p>and missiles may essentially just get dropped out of the sky</p>
<p>or wasted such that you&rsquo;re gonna be in close</p>
<p>with either IR missiles or guns,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a no kidding, you know, must defend type scenario.</p>
<p>First of all, what&rsquo;s electronic warfare?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s basically trying to get control</p>
<p>of electromagnetic spectrum for the interest</p>
<p>of whatever operation is going on.</p>
<p>So in the tactical environment,</p>
<p>a lot of that is trying to deceive the radar</p>
<p>or can we deceive the missiles or just, you know,</p>
<p>stop their guide and things of that nature.</p>
<p>Man, it&rsquo;s a battle in the space of information,</p>
<p>of digital information.</p>
<p>Yeah, well F22 and F35, right?</p>
<p>F22 is a big expensive aircraft</p>
<p>and it was made to be a great fighter.</p>
<p>But the F35 is not as great of a fighter,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an electronic warfare</p>
<p>and mission commander platform of the future</p>
<p>where information is what&rsquo;s gonna win the war</p>
<p>instead of the best dog fighter.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting dichotomy there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best airplane ever made, fighter jet ever made?</p>
<p>I know the aviators in the audience are gonna hate my answer</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna want that sexy, you know,</p>
<p>muscly F14 Tomcat type fighter</p>
<p>or maybe P51 type aircraft.</p>
<p>But the F35 is maybe not the best dog fighter,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have to get in a dog fight, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how you&rsquo;d be the best knife fighters,</p>
<p>not getting a knife fight sometimes.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin F35 Lightning II, it looks pretty sexy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two real strengths you can have as a fighter.</p>
<p>You can have the ability to kind of out muscle your fighter,</p>
<p>your opponent and beat them on Gs and power</p>
<p>and raid around on them.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the other side of that,</p>
<p>which is you can be overly maneuverable.</p>
<p>You can bleed energy quickly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the F18 was good at</p>
<p>because it had to be heavier to land on aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>We had to give it extra bulk,</p>
<p>but it also needs a special mechanism</p>
<p>to slow down enough to land on aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>And so it made it very maneuverable.</p>
<p>And what that leads to a lot of times</p>
<p>is the ability to get maybe the first shot in a fight,</p>
<p>which is very good, but if you do make that sharp turn,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna bleed a lot of your energy away</p>
<p>and be more susceptible for follow on shots</p>
<p>if that one&rsquo;s less susceptible.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s just kind of aggression,</p>
<p>nonaggression game you can play depending on</p>
<p>the type of aircraft you&rsquo;re fighting.</p>
<p>Where does the F35 land on that spectrum?</p>
<p>The F35 lands somewhere behind the F22s.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll probably be a row of F22s or F18s</p>
<p>and F35 will be out back,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll be enabling a lot of the warfare</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in front of you.</p>
<p>Is it one of the more expensive planes</p>
<p>because of all the stuff on it?</p>
<p>It certainly is, yeah.</p>
<p>In the movie, they have Tom Cruise fly it over Mach 10.</p>
<p>So maybe can you say what are the different speeds,</p>
<p>accelerations feel like, Mach 1, 2, 3, or hypersonic?</p>
<p>Have you ever flown hypersonic?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>How tough does it get?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna call out the BS of ejecting at Mach 10</p>
<p>just for the record, because in the movie,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been I think at least one ejection</p>
<p>that was supersonic, and I&rsquo;ll just say it was not pretty,</p>
<p>but he survived.</p>
<p>So there would have to be some interesting mechanisms</p>
<p>to eject successfully at Mach 10,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll digress on that for the moment.</p>
<p>Yeah, that seemed very strange.</p>
<p>And he just walked away from it, but anyway, so.</p>
<p>He seemed disheveled.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s Tom Cruise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Chuck Norris or something.</p>
<p>Indestructible, yeah.</p>
<p>Indestructible.</p>
<p>He also doesn&rsquo;t age.</p>
<p>But anyway, so what&rsquo;s interesting to say</p>
<p>about the experience as you go up?</p>
<p>Does it get more and more difficult?</p>
<p>In the end of the day, crossing the sound barrier</p>
<p>is much like crossing the speed limit on the highway.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really notice anything.</p>
<p>To cross that, at least in F18,</p>
<p>because we have a lot more weight than most fighters,</p>
<p>typically we&rsquo;ll do that in a descent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do that full afterburner,</p>
<p>just dumping gas into the engine.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;ll get us over the fastest</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve gone with about 1.28.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting, people realize,</p>
<p>is that if I take that throttle in an afterburner</p>
<p>and I just bring it back, just bring it back to mil,</p>
<p>which is full power, just not afterburner,</p>
<p>the deacceleration is so strong due to the air friction</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;ll throw you forward in your straps.</p>
<p>Almost, I would say, maybe like 70% as strong almost</p>
<p>as trapping on the boat, it&rsquo;s pretty strong.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like a reverse car crash</p>
<p>just for the deacceleration.</p>
<p>So the acceleration is usually kind of slow</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t feel anything, of course,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re crossing through it,</p>
<p>but the deacceleration&rsquo;s pretty violent.</p>
<p>The deacceleration&rsquo;s violent, huh, okay.</p>
<p>But is there a fundamental difference</p>
<p>between mach one and hypersonic, mach five and so on?</p>
<p>Does it require super special training?</p>
<p>And is that something that&rsquo;s used often in warfare</p>
<p>or is it not really that necessary?</p>
<p>No, so hypersonic human flight, if it exists,</p>
<p>is not something that&rsquo;s employed tactically</p>
<p>in any sense right now that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>So I think of hypersonic technology,</p>
<p>I think of missiles and weapons systems</p>
<p>and delivery platform, I don&rsquo;t think of fighter aircraft</p>
<p>necessarily, I can think of bomber</p>
<p>or reconnaissance aircraft perhaps,</p>
<p>but those would be more efficient, very long range.</p>
<p>So I imagine acceleration would be kind of gentle, honestly.</p>
<p>The thing you experience is the acceleration,</p>
<p>not the actual speed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been just a small tangent,</p>
<p>a lot of discussion about hypersonic nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>like missiles from Russia bragging about that.</p>
<p>Is this something that&rsquo;s a significant concern</p>
<p>or is it just a way to flex</p>
<p>about different kinds of weapons systems?</p>
<p>Hypersonics, I do think pose a challenge</p>
<p>for our detection systems because there are,</p>
<p>you know, there are design considerations</p>
<p>in these sensor systems as always, right?</p>
<p>And when you build them and the technology progresses</p>
<p>to a point where maybe it&rsquo;s not feasible</p>
<p>to use that technology, you know, there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>But with the all domain and kind of cross domain</p>
<p>data linking capabilities we have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less of, you know, it&rsquo;s more of an integrated picture,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>And so the hypersonics are really,</p>
<p>what it is is how fast can we detect and destroy a problem?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just shortening the time available to do that.</p>
<p>We call something like that the kill chain, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from locating a target and identifying it</p>
<p>and, you know, essentially authorizing its destruction</p>
<p>by whatever means, employing,</p>
<p>and then actually following up to ensure</p>
<p>that you did what you said you were going to do</p>
<p>in some sense, right?</p>
<p>Does it need another reattacks, something of that nature.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s an old dog fighting framework</p>
<p>you could call it, it&rsquo;s called the OODA loop</p>
<p>that kind of made its way in the engineering of business now</p>
<p>but the old observe, orientate, decide act</p>
<p>was initially a fighter mechanism in order to get inside</p>
<p>that kill chain of your opponent and break it up</p>
<p>so that he can&rsquo;t process his kill chain on you.</p>
<p>And so hypersonics are a way of shortening those windows</p>
<p>of opportunity to react to them.</p>
<p>I wanted to, like, how much do you have to shorten it</p>
<p>in order for the defense systems not to work anymore?</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s very, you know, I&rsquo;m both often horrified</p>
<p>by the thought of nuclear war, but at the same time,</p>
<p>wonder what that looks like.</p>
<p>When I dream of extreme competence in defense systems,</p>
<p>I imagine that not a single nuclear weapon</p>
<p>can reach the United States by missile</p>
<p>with the defense systems, but then again,</p>
<p>I also understand that these are extremely</p>
<p>complicated systems, the amount of integration required,</p>
<p>and because you&rsquo;re not using them,</p>
<p>I mean, there could be, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like an intern somewhere that like forgot</p>
<p>to update the code, the Fortran code</p>
<p>that like is going to make the different,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have the opportunity</p>
<p>to really thoroughly test, which is really scary.</p>
<p>Of course, the systems are probably incredible</p>
<p>if they could be tested, but because they can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>really thoroughly tested in an actual attack, I wonder.</p>
<p>I guess one assumption there would be that</p>
<p>these hypersonic missiles would only be launched</p>
<p>in the case of an attack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting if there were other hypersonic objects</p>
<p>that we could use to flex those systems.</p>
<p>Another thing that actually happened,</p>
<p>and I just have a million questions I want to ask you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to me, is there&rsquo;s a bird strike</p>
<p>on the plane, does that happen often?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a serious issue.</p>
<p>And it damaged the engine, and they made it seem</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a serious, exactly a serious issue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve hit birds, I know someone that took a turkey vulture</p>
<p>to the face, through the cockpit, right,</p>
<p>shattered the cockpit, knocked him out.</p>
<p>I think that, actually, I don&rsquo;t know him personally,</p>
<p>but it was a story I know from the command I was at,</p>
<p>and I believe the backseater had to punch out</p>
<p>and punch them both out because he was unconscious</p>
<p>in the front seat from the bird.</p>
<p>It can kill you from hitting you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a bowling ball going 250 miles an hour.</p>
<p>It can take out an engine very easily.</p>
<p>Every airport I&rsquo;ve flown at in the Navy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to check the bird condition, if you will,</p>
<p>to see how many birds, and we&rsquo;ve had to cancel flights</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s too many of them around the airport.</p>
<p>Some airports even have bird radars, military airports.</p>
<p>Is there systems that monitor the bird condition?</p>
<p>There is, yeah, there&rsquo;s actual radar systems,</p>
<p>and you can go in the, certain bases you have to call up,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll tell you what it is for the day</p>
<p>or for that hour, and other ones have it</p>
<p>in their weather report that goes out over the radio.</p>
<p>What are some technological solutions to this,</p>
<p>or is this just, because it&rsquo;s a low probability event,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no real solution for it?</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s not a low probability event.</p>
<p>This is happening a lot.</p>
<p>Although the hits themselves aren&rsquo;t necessarily that common,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll say a catastrophic hit, either a near miss or a hit</p>
<p>or the pilot having to actively maneuver to avoid it</p>
<p>is pretty common, and in fact, it seems stressful.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s so common in fact that we know</p>
<p>that you never want to try to go over,</p>
<p>or you never want to go under a bird</p>
<p>if you see it in front of you.</p>
<p>You always want to try to go over it</p>
<p>because what they&rsquo;ll do immediately if they see you</p>
<p>is, and you startle them, is they&rsquo;ll bring their wings in</p>
<p>and just drop straight down to try to get out of the path.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, I didn&rsquo;t know they did that,</p>
<p>but so if you immediately, if you try to go under them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be dropping into you,</p>
<p>so you typically want to try to go above them.</p>
<p>Is this something you can train for, or no?</p>
<p>Is this one of those things you have to really experience?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a skill set that you somewhat train for</p>
<p>in the duties of being a fighter pilot in a sense, right?</p>
<p>Being able to react to your environment very quickly</p>
<p>and make decisions quickly, so.</p>
<p>Is that one of the more absurd things,</p>
<p>challenges you have to deal with in flying?</p>
<p>Is there other things, sort of maybe weather conditions,</p>
<p>like harsh weather conditions?</p>
<p>Is there something that we maybe don&rsquo;t often think about</p>
<p>in terms of the challenges of flying?</p>
<p>Birds, in a way, aren&rsquo;t a ridiculous threat for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a safety threat that anything physical in the air</p>
<p>is something that we really have to be careful about,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re flying formation off of the aircraft</p>
<p>right next to us or whether it&rsquo;s a turkey vulture</p>
<p>at 2,000 feet or a flock of 5,000 birds,</p>
<p>like at the runway, we have to wave off, you know?</p>
<p>And although they&rsquo;re low probability,</p>
<p>a lot of bases will have actual</p>
<p>Environmental Protection Agency employees</p>
<p>that are responsible for safely removing migratory birds</p>
<p>or different animals that may be in the runways</p>
<p>or flying about.</p>
<p>Wow, I didn&rsquo;t know what a turkey vulture is,</p>
<p>and it really does look like a mix</p>
<p>between a vulture and a turkey.</p>
<p>Turkey.</p>
<p>And look kind of dumb, no offense to turkey vultures.</p>
<p>In that movie, who was the enemy nation?</p>
<p>Was it, I mean, I guess they were implying it&rsquo;s Iran.</p>
<p>Or was it Russia?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think they were implying</p>
<p>any particular nation state, frankly.</p>
<p>I think they did a somewhat decent job</p>
<p>of having some ambiguous fifth generation fighters.</p>
<p>The location and the stockpile,</p>
<p>I get how the story kind of insinuates certain things,</p>
<p>but they seem to do a good job</p>
<p>of not having anything directly pointing to another nation,</p>
<p>which I thought was the good move.</p>
<p>I enjoy these type of movies as an aviator</p>
<p>and as an American, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a feel good movie,</p>
<p>but we shouldn&rsquo;t be celebrating going to war</p>
<p>with any particular country, China, Russia,</p>
<p>whoever may have these weapons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to watch,</p>
<p>but it would be an incredibly serious event</p>
<p>to be implying these weapons.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we&rsquo;ll talk about war in general,</p>
<p>because yeah, the movie&rsquo;s kind of celebrating</p>
<p>the human side of things</p>
<p>and also the incredible technology involved,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the cost of war</p>
<p>and the seriousness of war</p>
<p>and the suffering involved with war,</p>
<p>not just in the fighting,</p>
<p>but in the death of civilians</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Well, you were a Navy pilot.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit more seriously about this,</p>
<p>and you were twice deployed in the Middle East</p>
<p>flying the FAA 18F Super Hornet.</p>
<p>Can you briefly tell the story of your career</p>
<p>as a Navy pilot?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So I joined the Navy in 2009, right after college.</p>
<p>I went to, essentially, officer boot camp,</p>
<p>officer of Canada school.</p>
<p>I applied as a pilot, and I got in as a pilot.</p>
<p>That was the advantage of going that way</p>
<p>is that I could essentially choose what I wanted,</p>
<p>and if I got in, great.</p>
<p>If not, I didn&rsquo;t get stuck doing something else.</p>
<p>So you knew you wanted to be a pilot.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I joined.</p>
<p>I went through my initial training.</p>
<p>I went through primary flight training</p>
<p>that all aviators go through,</p>
<p>and I did well enough that,</p>
<p>one of the first lessons they teach you in the Navy</p>
<p>is that you can have a great career in the Navy</p>
<p>and you can see the world and do what you want,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about the needs of the Navy and what they need,</p>
<p>so they may not have the platform you like</p>
<p>or you may not necessarily get to choose</p>
<p>your own adventure here,</p>
<p>but I was lucky enough that there was one jet slot</p>
<p>in my class, and I was lucky enough,</p>
<p>fortunate enough to get it, so.</p>
<p>It was a jet slot.</p>
<p>So yeah, what that means is that I was assigned</p>
<p>actually a tail hook at that point,</p>
<p>which meant I would go train to fly aircraft</p>
<p>that land on aircraft carriers,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s essentially three aircraft</p>
<p>that do that at the time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the F18 and the E2 and the C2.</p>
<p>C2 is kind of like the mail truck for the boat.</p>
<p>E2 is one of the big radar dish on top,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s all the F18s.</p>
<p>So E2 is comms, is C2 mail truck?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>C2 basically brings all the mail.</p>
<p>They pack on the shore,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the ones that bring supplies</p>
<p>to the ship via air and people.</p>
<p>Sorry if I missed it.</p>
<p>Is it a plane or is it a helicopter?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a plane.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, and the F18 is a fighter jet.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I selected tail hook,</p>
<p>which meant I could get one of those other ones,</p>
<p>but 80% of them or so are jets,</p>
<p>so I was in a good spot at that point,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when I went to Merde, Mississippi</p>
<p>to fly my first jet, which was the T45 Gauss Hawk.</p>
<p>Cool, so what kind of plane is that?</p>
<p>Is that what you were doing your training on?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the jet aircraft you get in</p>
<p>before you actually go to the F18.</p>
<p>It is a carrier capable,</p>
<p>so go to the boat for the first time in it during the day,</p>
<p>drop fake bombs, do dog fighting,</p>
<p>low levels, formation flying, day and night.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s a pretty plane.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it looks like a cone so that no one hits it.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s usually not used for fighting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s used for training?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used for training how to fight.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So what was that like?</p>
<p>Was that the first time you were sort of</p>
<p>really getting into it?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was really interesting,</p>
<p>because before that it was a 600 horsepower prop plane.</p>
<p>Going from that to the T45 is one of the biggest jumps</p>
<p>in power and like Navy machine operation.</p>
<p>How much horsepower does the T45 have approximately?</p>
<p>Maybe like 15,000 or so.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a huge jump from 600 you said horsepower about?</p>
<p>Cool, so it&rsquo;s a big, big leap.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a jet, so it performs differently, it&rsquo;s faster.</p>
<p>What that means, not just because it&rsquo;s faster,</p>
<p>your whole mind needs to be faster.</p>
<p>Everything happens faster in the air now, right?</p>
<p>Those comms happen faster,</p>
<p>your landing gear has to come up faster,</p>
<p>everything just happens faster in a jet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a big jump.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll never forget going on my first flight</p>
<p>in that aircraft, it was a formation flight for someone else.</p>
<p>And I was just in the back watching</p>
<p>and there was an instructor in the flight.</p>
<p>And so what that means is the instructor</p>
<p>is in a single aircraft and then there&rsquo;s three</p>
<p>or four other aircraft and they&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>how to do joins and they&rsquo;re learning how to fly in formation.</p>
<p>And as a new student in the back, it&rsquo;s amazing, right?</p>
<p>Cause you know, photo op time and all this,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m seeing aircraft up close for the first time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome, and on the way back,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t get our landing gear down, ironically.</p>
<p>So to make a long story short,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s overall not that exciting,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t get the gear down,</p>
<p>we actually went to go do a control ejection</p>
<p>to the target area where that is,</p>
<p>about 15, 20 miles to the north of the base.</p>
<p>Wait, did you just say that&rsquo;s not that exciting?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Cause that to me is pretty exciting.</p>
<p>That, I mean, how, first of all,</p>
<p>I mean, that must be terrifying,</p>
<p>like early on in your careers,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen those things that,</p>
<p>yeah, like how often does that kind of thing happen?</p>
<p>Decent, more than you would think.</p>
<p>More than you would think.</p>
<p>There was no significant panic?</p>
<p>This is like, this understood?</p>
<p>This is what has to be done in this case?</p>
<p>I think I was probably just too dumb</p>
<p>to realize the significance of it,</p>
<p>cause as a new student, you know,</p>
<p>not really appreciating, you know,</p>
<p>just what is ahead of me if we are ejecting.</p>
<p>But at the time it was more, it was just like rote, right?</p>
<p>Cause I was back there,</p>
<p>and then I went from a observer mode to a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna provide you the help that I can provide you</p>
<p>as a member of this crew, you know, mode.</p>
<p>And so it was less about, you know,</p>
<p>on this 20 mile trip and thinking about my,</p>
<p>how vulnerable I am, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going through checklists,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking to people, we&rsquo;re getting ready.</p>
<p>So no, it wasn&rsquo;t fearful.</p>
<p>And the whole time we were doing one of these</p>
<p>to try to get the gear down.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re unloading the jet and then loading it back</p>
<p>to try to get the gear out with the stick.</p>
<p>And it came down, it came down halfway there,</p>
<p>just on its own.</p>
<p>So it came back around and we did like a safety trap</p>
<p>in case there was a problem with the gear.</p>
<p>And that was my first flight, you know,</p>
<p>a little bit of serendipity,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna fast forward a bit.</p>
<p>And I went back to that squad as an instructor</p>
<p>about five or six years later,</p>
<p>and I was an aviation safety officer at this point,</p>
<p>which meant I was responsible for investigating mishaps.</p>
<p>And a student went in and he went in the back seat</p>
<p>of a form flight, just like the one I went on.</p>
<p>And he went out and he ended up ejecting on that flight.</p>
<p>Exact same type of flight.</p>
<p>They went out and they had a runaway trim scenario.</p>
<p>And it caused the aircraft essentially</p>
<p>just inverted itself almost 180 degrees</p>
<p>at about 600 feet over the ground.</p>
<p>And they punched out just slightly outside</p>
<p>the ejection window at about 300, 400 feet or so,</p>
<p>but they were completely fine.</p>
<p>So, you know, and then about two months later,</p>
<p>we had another ejection.</p>
<p>About three months after that, we had another ejection.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, you know, it can be more common</p>
<p>than people think.</p>
<p>What does it feel like to get ejected?</p>
<p>Thankfully, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I can describe it to you.</p>
<p>I can tell you what it&rsquo;s like from what I&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>but I truly think it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>that you just don&rsquo;t understand until it happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like instantaneous about 250 Gs,</p>
<p>which is only possible because of inertia in our blood.</p>
<p>All right, so you can actually get like 250, 300 Gs</p>
<p>for like a few milliseconds,</p>
<p>and then it backs off to like 40 or 50 Gs</p>
<p>to get you away from the vehicle itself.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you may lose consciousness.</p>
<p>If you do, you know, who knows where you wake up.</p>
<p>You know, you could be in a tree,</p>
<p>you could still be falling, you could be in the water, so.</p>
<p>The physics of that is fascinating, how to eject safely.</p>
<p>Do you know the story about how that was tested at all?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the full story,</p>
<p>but there was an airport.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing nobody knows the full story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a lot of shady stuff going on.</p>
<p>But anyway, you mean like in the early, early days, or?</p>
<p>They took a flight dock up to a rocket sled</p>
<p>and just see how much their body could take it.</p>
<p>And he turned a lot of his body in the mush</p>
<p>in the process of getting that science done,</p>
<p>but he saved a lot of lives.</p>
<p>People used to be tougher back in the day.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s how science used to be done.</p>
<p>So how did your training continue?</p>
<p>So how, take me farther through your career</p>
<p>as you worked towards graduating towards the F18s.</p>
<p>So in VT9, where I was a student, there&rsquo;s two phases.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an intermediate and an advanced.</p>
<p>Intermediate is getting very comfortable with the aircraft.</p>
<p>And at that point, you truly hear,</p>
<p>all right, you&rsquo;re going jets now,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna go one of the other aircraft</p>
<p>that land on the aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>I was told I was going jets at that point.</p>
<p>And then we go into same squadron,</p>
<p>same aircraft, same instructors,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s called advanced now.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re learning how to dog fight for the first time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing what we call tactical formation,</p>
<p>which is just like aggressive position keeping.</p>
<p>We are doing dog fighting in low levels</p>
<p>and all sorts of great stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really that first introduction</p>
<p>to that tactical environment</p>
<p>and really putting Gs on the jet</p>
<p>and on your body and maneuvering.</p>
<p>Is there like tactical formation,</p>
<p>is collaborating with other fighter jets a part of that?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>So flying in a, that&rsquo;s what you mean by formation.</p>
<p>So literally having an awareness.</p>
<p>Is this done for you or are you as a human</p>
<p>supposed to understand like where you are in the formation,</p>
<p>how to maintain formation, all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>Is it done autonomously or manually?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great autonomy point</p>
<p>on the end of this I&rsquo;ve thought about.</p>
<p>So, but what we do, it&rsquo;s all manual.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m looking at his wing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m looking at different visual checkpoints</p>
<p>that form like a triangle, right?</p>
<p>Like an equal out triangle essentially.</p>
<p>And then as that triangle is no longer equal,</p>
<p>I can tell my relative position against that aircraft.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m staring at first,</p>
<p>sometimes hours on end, several feet away,</p>
<p>doing one of these if I&rsquo;m in the weather, that&rsquo;s all it is.</p>
<p>So you get, it&rsquo;s almost like, is it peripheral vision</p>
<p>or is it your?</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re staring directly at it.</p>
<p>The peripheral is going on my, on my.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Stuff, right?</p>
<p>My sensors and all my instruments.</p>
<p>And so he is my gyroscope at that point, right?</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re flying, not looking straight.</p>
<p>Correct, I&rsquo;m flying like this for hours.</p>
<p>It can hurt your neck.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like doing this as much.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just me, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird thing where when you&rsquo;re like this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually harder to fly formation slightly than here</p>
<p>because being in line of your hand movements</p>
<p>and of the aircraft somehow has an effect</p>
<p>on our ability to be more precise and comfortable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange.</p>
<p>But so there&rsquo;s a symmetry to the formation usually.</p>
<p>So one of the people on the other side</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t like being on that side.</p>
<p>Is it, does it, who gets like the short straw?</p>
<p>How do you decide which side of the formation you are?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question too</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s kind of rank in some sense.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s a four person formation, right?</p>
<p>You have the vision lead who&rsquo;s qualified</p>
<p>to lead a whole division, but maybe the other ones aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And he has a dash two and that&rsquo;s his wingman essentially.</p>
<p>And then in a division, there&rsquo;s two other aircraft.</p>
<p>And then you have another senior flight leader.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dash three position.</p>
<p>And then you have dash four, the last one.</p>
<p>And if you were all lined up on one side,</p>
<p>like fingertip, one, two, three, four,</p>
<p>that dash four guy is gonna be at the end of that whip.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re flying formation,</p>
<p>each one&rsquo;s making movements relative to the lead.</p>
<p>Dash four is kind of at the end of that error.</p>
<p>And so his movements are kind of like a whip.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to fly in that position in close.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate?</p>
<p>Is it because of the error, the aerodynamics?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a whip?</p>
<p>If this is a flight lead and this is dash two,</p>
<p>flight lead is rock steady and just doing his thing.</p>
<p>And flight two is gonna be working that triangle</p>
<p>moving a little bit, right?</p>
<p>And he has this small error bubble</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s doing his best to stay.</p>
<p>And then, but dash three is flying off dash two.</p>
<p>And so his error bubble is dash twos plus his own.</p>
<p>And dash four.</p>
<p>So it gets more and more stressful</p>
<p>as you get farther out.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s the experience of that staring</p>
<p>for long periods of time and trying to maintain formation?</p>
<p>How stressful is that?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re doing that when we drive, staying in lane.</p>
<p>And that becomes, after you get pretty good at it,</p>
<p>it becomes somewhat, it&rsquo;s still stressful.</p>
<p>Which actually is surprisingly stressful.</p>
<p>When you look at lane keeping systems,</p>
<p>they actually relieve that stress somehow.</p>
<p>And it actually creates a much more pleasant experience</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re still able to maintain situational awareness</p>
<p>and stay awake, which is really interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people realize how stressful it is</p>
<p>to lane keep when they drive.</p>
<p>So this is even more stressful.</p>
<p>So are you, do you think about that?</p>
<p>Or is this, yeah, I guess how stressful is it</p>
<p>from a psychology perspective?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very stressful.</p>
<p>So I taught students how to do this as well.</p>
<p>And so at our feet, we have two rudders.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m flying off a flight lead over here,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find a lot of times is you&rsquo;ll be flying,</p>
<p>or like if I&rsquo;m the instructor and the student&rsquo;s flying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start to notice that he&rsquo;s having a harder</p>
<p>and harder time keeping position.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ll notice typically is he&rsquo;s locked out his leg.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll lock out the leg that&rsquo;s closest</p>
<p>to the aircraft they&rsquo;re flying against</p>
<p>and push on the rudder subconsciously,</p>
<p>because their whole body&rsquo;s trying to get away</p>
<p>from the aircraft because they&rsquo;re so uncomfortable</p>
<p>being close to it.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll tell them, I can fix their form</p>
<p>with just a couple of words.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, wiggle your toes.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll wiggle their toes and they&rsquo;ll realize,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll loosen all the muscles in their legs</p>
<p>because they realize they&rsquo;ve been locked up</p>
<p>and their formation flying will get a lot better.</p>
<p>And so, there&rsquo;s a lot of stress associated with that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interesting psychological or visual issues</p>
<p>such as vertigo as you&rsquo;re flying.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re flying with him</p>
<p>and then you fly right into a cloud, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s very stressful</p>
<p>because you have to be very close</p>
<p>in order to maintain visual</p>
<p>and you might be on a thunderstorm, right?</p>
<p>And so you have to be very tight.</p>
<p>You might start raining and then he&rsquo;s turning,</p>
<p>but you might not even know that.</p>
<p>You might not even be able to see that turn.</p>
<p>And so all of a sudden you might look</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re in a turn thinking you were straight and level</p>
<p>and you look just maybe back at your instruments very quick</p>
<p>and you realize you&rsquo;re like in a 30 degree turn</p>
<p>and your whole concept of where you are in the world</p>
<p>starts getting very confused.</p>
<p>And you immediately get this sense of, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Like I look at the HUD and it feels,</p>
<p>all my senses are telling me it&rsquo;s spinning, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And so I have to trust my instruments</p>
<p>even though it feels like it&rsquo;s spinning.</p>
<p>And the same thing can happen</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re flying formation off of someone</p>
<p>and it can be very dangerous and disorientating.</p>
<p>But the point is to try to regain awareness</p>
<p>by trusting the instruments,</p>
<p>like distrust all your human senses</p>
<p>and just use the instruments</p>
<p>to rebuild situational awareness.</p>
<p>Not in this particular case</p>
<p>because our situational awareness is based,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s predicated off of our flight lead.</p>
<p>So in a sense, I&rsquo;m just trusting his movements.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s my gyroscope, but you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>And if I was by myself, I would trust my instruments,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t just stop flying form and trust my instruments</p>
<p>because now I&rsquo;m gonna hit him.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you have to pay attention to him.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s my reference.</p>
<p>So the instruments are not helping you significantly</p>
<p>with his positioning.</p>
<p>Not, it&rsquo;s all completely manual.</p>
<p>So is there a future where some of that is autonomous?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;ve thought about automating that flight regime.</p>
<p>But when I started thinking about it,</p>
<p>I realized that all the formation keeping that we do</p>
<p>is designed to enhance the aviators</p>
<p>ability to maintain sight, right?</p>
<p>So we fly very tight formation so that we can go in weather</p>
<p>and to reduce groups of traffic coming into the boat.</p>
<p>We fly in one particular position</p>
<p>so that all of the flight crew can look down the line</p>
<p>and see the flight lead.</p>
<p>So everything has based,</p>
<p>everything has to do with the two air crew</p>
<p>visually maintaining sight of each other</p>
<p>and defending each other, right?</p>
<p>In a combat spread, I might be looking,</p>
<p>I may be three miles away from him flying formation</p>
<p>directly beam and looking around</p>
<p>to make sure nothing&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;m looking into automating this process,</p>
<p>I thought, well, sure it&rsquo;s easy to get a bunch of aircraft</p>
<p>to fly in formation off each other, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trivial, but why?</p>
<p>What is the best formation?</p>
<p>Why are they doing that?</p>
<p>And that opened up a much more interesting regime</p>
<p>of operations and flight mechanics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we get back to that kind of stochastic</p>
<p>mindset where we can bring in aircraft close</p>
<p>to do some type of normal flying</p>
<p>or reduce congestion around airports.</p>
<p>But when we consider flying or formation</p>
<p>in a tactical environment,</p>
<p>we can be much more effective</p>
<p>with nontraditional formation keeping</p>
<p>or perhaps no formation keeping perhaps.</p>
<p>So autonomy used for formation keeping,</p>
<p>not for convenience, but for the introduction of randomness.</p>
<p>Like to a real time mission planner, yeah.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s where you also have some human modification.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like unmanned teaming enters that picture.</p>
<p>So you use some of the human intuition</p>
<p>and adjustment of this formation.</p>
<p>The formation itself has some uncertainty.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such an interesting dance.</p>
<p>I think that is the most fascinating application</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>is when it&rsquo;s human AI collaboration,</p>
<p>that semi autonomous dance</p>
<p>that you see in these semi autonomous vehicle systems</p>
<p>in terms of cars being driving,</p>
<p>but also in the safety critical situation</p>
<p>of a airplane, of a fighter jet,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re flying fast.</p>
<p>I mean, in a split second,</p>
<p>you have to make all these kinds of decisions</p>
<p>and it feels like an AI system can do</p>
<p>as much harm as it can help.</p>
<p>And so to get that right is a really fascinating challenge.</p>
<p>One of the challenges too,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just the algorithms of the autonomy itself,</p>
<p>but how it senses the environment.</p>
<p>That of course is gonna be what all these decisions</p>
<p>are based off of.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a challenge in this type of environment.</p>
<p>Well, I gotta ask.</p>
<p>So F18, what&rsquo;s it like to fly a fighter jet as best?</p>
<p>I mean, what to you is beautiful, powerful?</p>
<p>What do you love about the experience of flying?</p>
<p>For me, and I think I&rsquo;m an outlier a bit.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the flying itself, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the soaring over the clouds</p>
<p>and looking down at the earth from upside down.</p>
<p>I came to love that,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the passion that drove me there.</p>
<p>I just had no exposure to that.</p>
<p>The only exposure I had was reading</p>
<p>and going in the woods and science fiction and all that.</p>
<p>And so, what seemed to kind of drive me towards that</p>
<p>was just a desire to really be operating as close</p>
<p>to what I thought was the edge of technology or science.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the path that I chose</p>
<p>to try to get close to that.</p>
<p>I thought that being in a fighter jet</p>
<p>and all the tools and the technology and the knowledge</p>
<p>and the challenges and the failures and victories</p>
<p>that would come with that just seemed like something</p>
<p>that I wanted to be a part of.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily about the flying,</p>
<p>but it was about the challenge.</p>
<p>And like I said, as a person from a small town,</p>
<p>small high school, being able to get my hands</p>
<p>or even just near something of such technological</p>
<p>significance was kind of empowering for me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of what bore the love of flight from there.</p>
<p>Becoming, having some level of mastery in the aircraft,</p>
<p>it really feels like an extension of your body.</p>
<p>And once I got there, then kind of the love of flying</p>
<p>kind of followed.</p>
<p>So you sort of, one, is the man mastery over the machine.</p>
<p>And second is the machine is like the greatest thing</p>
<p>that humans have ever created arguably.</p>
<p>The things that Lockheed Martin and others have built.</p>
<p>I mean, the engineering in that.</p>
<p>However you feel about war, which is one of the sad things</p>
<p>about human civilization is war inspires</p>
<p>the engineering of tools that are incredible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, maybe without war,</p>
<p>if we look at human history, we would not build</p>
<p>some of the incredible things we built.</p>
<p>So in order to win wars, to stop wars,</p>
<p>we build these incredible systems</p>
<p>that perhaps propagate war.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another discussion I&rsquo;ll ask you about.</p>
<p>But this, to you, this is like, this is a chance</p>
<p>to experience the greatest engineering humans</p>
<p>have ever been able to do.</p>
<p>Like similar, I suppose, that astronauts feel like</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re flying.</p>
<p>And I wanted to be an astronaut.</p>
<p>I wanted to take that route.</p>
<p>I was gonna apply to test pilot school.</p>
<p>It just didn&rsquo;t work out for me.</p>
<p>I ended up having a broken foot during my window.</p>
<p>But long story short, I ended up after my time</p>
<p>in my fleet squadron, and we can get back to the rest</p>
<p>of the timeline if you want,</p>
<p>but I went to be an instructor pilot instead, right?</p>
<p>And then, I was talking about this</p>
<p>with a squadron mate earlier today about how,</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be talking with Lex today</p>
<p>if I ended up going to test pilot school.</p>
<p>I never would have, I never would have had the,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t, maybe recklessness, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but the willingness to have a conversation</p>
<p>about UAP while I was, that led me to the decision</p>
<p>to get out once I went there.</p>
<p>And it kind of enabled me to talk about UAP more publicly.</p>
<p>And if I stayed in the Navy, then I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that would have happened.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to if I went that route.</p>
<p>Well, as a small tangent, do you hope to travel</p>
<p>to Mars one day?</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;ll step foot on Mars one day?</p>
<p>If you asked me that five years ago,</p>
<p>I would have said, yes, I want to.</p>
<p>In fact, I would like to die on Mars.</p>
<p>Now, today, now I have some hesitations</p>
<p>and I have some hesitations</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m hopeful and optimistic.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, I think that we are truly</p>
<p>like on the brink of a very wide technological revolution</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to kind of move us how we used to move</p>
<p>information and data in this last century.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be manipulating and managing matter</p>
<p>in that next century.</p>
<p>And so I think that, I think our reach as humans</p>
<p>are going to get a lot wider, a lot faster</p>
<p>than people may realize, or at least.</p>
<p>Wait, are you getting like super ambitious beyond Mars?</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Well, I mean.</p>
<p>Like Mars seems kind of boring, I want to go beyond that.</p>
<p>Is that what, do you mean the reach of humanity</p>
<p>across all kinds of technologies?</p>
<p>Or do you mean literally across space?</p>
<p>Across space, you know?</p>
<p>So, you know, we&rsquo;re going to be, I think that</p>
<p>as artificial intelligence and machine learning</p>
<p>start broaching further into the topic of science,</p>
<p>the area of science, and we start working through</p>
<p>new physics, we start working through,</p>
<p>or I should say pass the Einsteinian frameworks</p>
<p>as we kind of get a better idea of what space time is</p>
<p>or isn&rsquo;t, we may have, we may find, you know,</p>
<p>answers that we didn&rsquo;t know that we were looking for.</p>
<p>And we may have more opportunity.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying this is something I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>betting the farm on, of course, but maybe that&rsquo;s a road</p>
<p>I want to explore on Earth instead of on Mars.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s technology that can be brought to bear</p>
<p>with new science and harder engineering that is a road</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t go past Mars to get outside the solar system.</p>
<p>So there are different ways to explore the universe</p>
<p>than the traditional rocket systems.</p>
<p>If we can continue sort of your journey,</p>
<p>you said that you were attracted to the incredibly</p>
<p>advanced technologies of the F18s and just the</p>
<p>fighter jets in general.</p>
<p>Let me ask another question, which seems incredibly</p>
<p>difficult to do, which is landing on a carrier</p>
<p>or taking off from a carrier and landing on a carrier.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>What are the challenges of that?</p>
<p>Taking off&rsquo;s pretty easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s procedurally somewhat complex where there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of moving parts, almost like a clock, you know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re almost in a pocket watch.</p>
<p>So then you&rsquo;re a part of the machinery.</p>
<p>And so long as you press the right buttons</p>
<p>and do the right things, you&rsquo;re gonna go shooting</p>
<p>off the front.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a checklist to follow and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>several people involved in that checklist</p>
<p>and you just gotta follow the checklist correctly.</p>
<p>Essentially, yep.</p>
<p>Lots of ways to screw it up, but you&rsquo;ll know</p>
<p>how to screw it up.</p>
<p>But landing on the back of the boat is a whole</p>
<p>different animal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more variables.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s essentially one or two people responsible</p>
<p>for the success of that.</p>
<p>The landing signal officer who actually represents</p>
<p>a team of specially trained aviators who are responsible</p>
<p>for helping that aviator land on the boat.</p>
<p>And the pilot himself.</p>
<p>And it is a hard task to actually fly precisely enough</p>
<p>to be good at it.</p>
<p>So to fly quote unquote the perfect pass,</p>
<p>you essentially have to fly your head through a one foot</p>
<p>by one foot box.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially the target you&rsquo;re shooting for.</p>
<p>Plus or minus probably about five knots on airspeed,</p>
<p>although we don&rsquo;t really judge it by airspeed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something called angle of attack.</p>
<p>But generally pretty tight parameters there.</p>
<p>And you can do everything perfect and still fail.</p>
<p>So when we go to touchdown, we immediately bring</p>
<p>the power up and we rotate as if we were doing,</p>
<p>as if we were bouncing off the deck.</p>
<p>And if we catch it, then we slow down.</p>
<p>And then someone tells us to bring the power back,</p>
<p>which we do, we don&rsquo;t do it on our own.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s such a violent experience.</p>
<p>Think you&rsquo;re trapped or not, or something breaks</p>
<p>and you bring your throttle back.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very serious thing.</p>
<p>It happened to best of us, I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;ve done it once.</p>
<p>When I first got to the squadron,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called ease guns land.</p>
<p>And so I came in the boat and I brought the power.</p>
<p>I cracked the power back a little bit</p>
<p>before I&rsquo;ve been told to her that my aircraft</p>
<p>had finished settling in.</p>
<p>And that was a big faux pas, right?</p>
<p>So, especially as a new guy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very serious business.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of eyes on you</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to screw it up.</p>
<p>But the physical rush of like having a great pass</p>
<p>and then like the crash of into the boat and all that,</p>
<p>the physical sensation from it,</p>
<p>when everything&rsquo;s going great,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s top of the world, it&rsquo;s a great feeling.</p>
<p>How much of it is feel?</p>
<p>How much of it is instruments?</p>
<p>How much is other people just doing the work for you,</p>
<p>catching you, as long as you do everything right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few systems we use.</p>
<p>One is called the BAL.</p>
<p>And the BAL is external to our aircraft.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s B A L L, BAL, like BAL, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a iFloss landing system,</p>
<p>which stands for something very long convoluted.</p>
<p>But essentially it&rsquo;s a mirror with lights on it.</p>
<p>And you see the light at a different cell</p>
<p>based on your position relative to an ideal glide slope.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re right on it, you&rsquo;re right in the middle.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re below, you&rsquo;re low.</p>
<p>And as I add power and maneuver the aircraft,</p>
<p>that BAL, I see that BAL rise, I see that BAL low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lagging indicator though, right?</p>
<p>And your jet is a lagging engine too, right?</p>
<p>It takes time to spool up the engine.</p>
<p>So that adds to the complexity.</p>
<p>You have to think ahead a bit.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just bring the power up and leave it there.</p>
<p>You have to bring the power up, touch it, bring it back.</p>
<p>And oh, by the way, your landing area is moving,</p>
<p>not just away from you, but also on an angle, right?</p>
<p>Cause we have an angled deck.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re constantly doing one of these</p>
<p>to correct yourself as you go.</p>
<p>That seems so stressful.</p>
<p>And every time you do one of those,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a 30 degree angle bank, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing lift, right?</p>
<p>And so I have to compensate with power each time I do that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m doing another one.</p>
<p>Cause you have to maintain the same level</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always lowering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a constant rate of descent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s increasing from about 200 feet per minute</p>
<p>to about 650.</p>
<p>And every time you do this, that&rsquo;s messing with that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you have to compensate.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing that manually.</p>
<p>Do that manually.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And then of course, as you come down that glide slope,</p>
<p>it becomes more and more narrow.</p>
<p>And you have to, of course,</p>
<p>modulate your inputs such that they&rsquo;re smaller and smaller</p>
<p>cause they have a bigger and bigger effect</p>
<p>as you get closer in.</p>
<p>And what happens too, when you get in close is that</p>
<p>right before you cross over,</p>
<p>if this is the boat right here, your table,</p>
<p>right before you kind of get your wings</p>
<p>over the boat itself,</p>
<p>this big wind from the main tower of the boat</p>
<p>is where it dips down.</p>
<p>So the wind actually goes down and it&rsquo;s called the burble.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll actually pull the aircraft down,</p>
<p>increase your rate of descent.</p>
<p>So at that particular point,</p>
<p>you need to increase your speed.</p>
<p>You know, increase your power</p>
<p>and try to compensate against that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s kind of a third variable</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to screw you up on your way down.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most difficult conditions</p>
<p>in which you had to land</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve seen somebody had to land?</p>
<p>Because I think you were also a signal officer as well.</p>
<p>I was, yeah.</p>
<p>I was the head landing signal officer for my squadron.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve probably seen some tough landings.</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a ramp strike,</p>
<p>which is when a part of the aircraft hits</p>
<p>before the landing area,</p>
<p>which is basically the round out of the boat.</p>
<p>That is before the landing area.</p>
<p>So they basically struck the back of the boat coming in.</p>
<p>It was just their hook.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t their craft.</p>
<p>And they were fine.</p>
<p>That one was kind of ugly.</p>
<p>But it like rips that part of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And then you land on your bellies, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>In this particular case,</p>
<p>it hit and then it gave</p>
<p>and essentially dragged the hook on the surface after that.</p>
<p>And so he was able to grab a wire at that point.</p>
<p>When does that kind of thing happen?</p>
<p>Is it just a miscalculation by the pilot</p>
<p>or is it weather conditions?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even call it a miscalculation.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m going to put the blame on the pilot</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s the only one in the cockpit.</p>
<p>But then the day he&rsquo;s reacting to the situations</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s dealing with.</p>
<p>And so it may be errors or he may be doing the best</p>
<p>with the conditions that he&rsquo;s been given.</p>
<p>On that particular one,</p>
<p>you just got too high rate of send.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very common.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you see it with new pilots.</p>
<p>You see it with older pilots, right?</p>
<p>New ones and complacent ones.</p>
<p>What you see is they&rsquo;ll try to make the ball go</p>
<p>right where they want it in close.</p>
<p>They think they can beat the game a little bit.</p>
<p>And they try to, and so we have sayings,</p>
<p>we teach pilots as a landing signal officer,</p>
<p>we tell them like, don&rsquo;t recenter the high ball in close.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the rules to live by.</p>
<p>And so when the ball&rsquo;s up high,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try to bring it back in close</p>
<p>to like the center point when you&rsquo;re in close.</p>
<p>Cause what you&rsquo;re doing is you bring the power off</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to crash right down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happens, right?</p>
<p>Cause you got the burble pulling you down.</p>
<p>You might be correcting, which is decreasing your lift.</p>
<p>And then you have that type of maneuvers.</p>
<p>How are you supposed to do all of this</p>
<p>in harsh weather conditions?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the one I wanted to tell you about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hardest one.</p>
<p>And what you hear is if you hear 99 taxi lights on,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really shitty day.</p>
<p>99 taxi lights on, what&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>Everyone put your taxi lights on</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re about to land on the boat.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t see the boat?</p>
<p>Weather is so bad that the landing signal officer</p>
<p>on the boat can&rsquo;t see you either.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t see the boat.</p>
<p>And you won&rsquo;t be able to see it when you touch down.</p>
<p>So we call that a zero, zero landing.</p>
<p>And you turn on the taxi lights so that the LSO</p>
<p>who has a radio in his hand that looks like a phone</p>
<p>from 1980 is talking directly to the pilot.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s looking at that little light in the rain</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s telling them you&rsquo;re high, you&rsquo;re low,</p>
<p>power, things like that.</p>
<p>Come right, back to left.</p>
<p>And literally talking him down to land</p>
<p>on the boat right there.</p>
<p>And the pilot, usually it comes as a surprise</p>
<p>to the pilot, the landing,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s just listening to the voice,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t see the ball, can&rsquo;t see the boat.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you just hit the boat.</p>
<p>You crash, I mean you crash.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going about 1,600 feet per minute descent</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going super fast.</p>
<p>So all of this is happening fast.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know the moment it&rsquo;s gonna hit.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just going into the darkness</p>
<p>and just waiting for it to hit.</p>
<p>Maybe not dark though, a lot of times it&rsquo;s white.</p>
<p>Into the light.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just going into the light.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a voice from an 80s phone.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>This is terrible.</p>
<p>But so you still have to,</p>
<p>so this kind of thing happens.</p>
<p>You still have to land.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just don&rsquo;t have a place to divert.</p>
<p>But in a sense we&rsquo;re trained for that</p>
<p>because we do the night landings as well.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;ll find this interesting,</p>
<p>but I always found that the night landings</p>
<p>where in these particular cases,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re usually lined up behind the boat,</p>
<p>maybe 10, 15 miles, whereas the other ones,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a tight circle, the landing pattern.</p>
<p>And so we can potentially see the boat way out there</p>
<p>if the lights were on, which they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>But we can maybe see like the string of aircraft</p>
<p>in front of us.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is that it can take a while.</p>
<p>You might be 15 miles out</p>
<p>and your lights are turned down as dim as possible.</p>
<p>You have a cloud deck maybe at six or 7,000 feet</p>
<p>so that the starlight, there&rsquo;s no moon,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say the starlight&rsquo;s blocked out</p>
<p>because just the starlight alone, no moon,</p>
<p>you can see the boat, you can see the water.</p>
<p>But when that goes away, it&rsquo;s like closing your eyes.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell anything.</p>
<p>It could be upside down.</p>
<p>It could be in any position.</p>
<p>And for me, it was almost a meditative process</p>
<p>that I had to snap myself back out of</p>
<p>when I was on like a long straightaway.</p>
<p>And then I would see the light pop up</p>
<p>in the sea of darkness.</p>
<p>No lights anywhere.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t even see the horizon.</p>
<p>And I just see a light out there.</p>
<p>My instruments were telling me, and they&rsquo;re turned down</p>
<p>as far as they can go, right?</p>
<p>So I can barely see them.</p>
<p>So my eyes can adjust.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just staring at this light in the distance.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just very meditative and it&rsquo;s the hum behind you.</p>
<p>And then at like four miles, you know,</p>
<p>almost like, oh, the light is a little bit bigger.</p>
<p>And you almost kind of have to snap back to it</p>
<p>and be like, oh, I need to like kind of like</p>
<p>look around a little bit and engage my brain,</p>
<p>link it back to my body and like do this thing.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re going to have to actually land.</p>
<p>Well, is there just, you said you don&rsquo;t necessarily feel</p>
<p>the romantic notion of the whole thing,</p>
<p>but is there some aspects of flying where you look up</p>
<p>and maybe you see the stars or yeah, that kind of thing</p>
<p>that you just like, holy crap,</p>
<p>how did humans accomplish all of this?</p>
<p>Like, am I actually flying right now?</p>
<p>I used to have those moments on the boat</p>
<p>when I was catching planes land.</p>
<p>I would, they would trap and it&rsquo;d be nighttime.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just all this chaos in the middle of the ocean</p>
<p>and nothing.</p>
<p>And I would have these moments where I&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>how the hell did I end up here?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s one moment in time next to an aircraft</p>
<p>landing on a boat in the middle of the ocean, you know,</p>
<p>where did my life, you know,</p>
<p>how did my life go to end up here?</p>
<p>How interesting.</p>
<p>But what I did start to enjoy was the night vision goggles</p>
<p>and putting those on and looking up at the stars</p>
<p>flying around, especially over the ocean.</p>
<p>What do they look like?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just so many, there&rsquo;s just so many stars</p>
<p>that, you know, you normally can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re shooting stars all the time.</p>
<p>Almost every flight you&rsquo;d see them with the goggles on.</p>
<p>And so it was a great pleasure to take advantage</p>
<p>of the lack of light pollution in some cases,</p>
<p>especially on deployment to go grab some goggles at night,</p>
<p>go out some quiet spot in the ship that no one can see me</p>
<p>and just kind of look around, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s humbling.</p>
<p>Quick break, bathroom break?</p>
<p>Yeah, wouldn&rsquo;t mind a quick stretch of legs.</p>
<p>You got a few cool patches.</p>
<p>I do, so this is a VFA 11 Red Rippers patch.</p>
<p>Typically going actually on our arm.</p>
<p>So this is actually what we call the Boar&rsquo;s Head or Arnold.</p>
<p>So this is actually the Boar&rsquo;s Head</p>
<p>from the Gordon&rsquo;s Gin bottle.</p>
<p>In 1918, we were in London or the UK somewhere</p>
<p>and we apparently partied with the owner and founder</p>
<p>of Gordon&rsquo;s Gin and we had a great time</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a signed letter in our ready room</p>
<p>that says we can use the logo in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>And yeah, so I&rsquo;d like to give you that patch.</p>
<p>I drank quite a bit of gourd, so this is good.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to give you that coin from our squadron.</p>
<p>The Red Rippers, that&rsquo;s a badass name.</p>
<p>Thank you, brother.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s jump around a little bit,</p>
<p>but let me ask you about this one set of experiences</p>
<p>that you had and people in your squadron had.</p>
<p>So you and a few people in the squadron</p>
<p>either detected UFOs on your instruments</p>
<p>or saw them directly.</p>
<p>Tell me the full story of these UFO sightings</p>
<p>and to the smallest technical details,</p>
<p>because I love those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do my best.</p>
<p>So we returned from, and when I say we,</p>
<p>I mean, not my squadron, but VFA 11, the Red Rippers.</p>
<p>I was a somewhat junior pilot at the time.</p>
<p>I joined them on deployment in 2012,</p>
<p>where they had been already out there</p>
<p>for about six months or so,</p>
<p>operating in the vicinity of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I joined them and then we flew back</p>
<p>and still as a relatively new guy,</p>
<p>we came back and we entered</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s considered a maintenance phase</p>
<p>where we slow down the tactical flying a bit,</p>
<p>kind of recuperate, do some maintenance on the aircraft.</p>
<p>And our particular model of the F18, the lot number,</p>
<p>was plumbed for the particular things</p>
<p>that were needed to upgrade the radar</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s known as the ABG 73 to the ABG 79.</p>
<p>And the ABG 73 is a mechanically scanned array radar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a perfectly fine radar,</p>
<p>but the AESA radar is kind of a magnitude jump</p>
<p>in capability, kind of an analog digital kind of mindset.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a leap to digital.</p>
<p>ABG 73, so I mean, are these things on a carrier?</p>
<p>Like what are we talking about here?</p>
<p>How big is the radar?</p>
<p>So this is actually the radars in the F18 itself.</p>
<p>Okay, so when you say they were chosen,</p>
<p>this is to test the upgrade to the new, the 79, ABG 79.</p>
<p>Less of a test and more of just,</p>
<p>hey, it&rsquo;s your turn to get the upgrade.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re all going to these better radars.</p>
<p>They were building ones off the line with the new radar,</p>
<p>but we were this weird transitionary squadron</p>
<p>in the middle that transitioned</p>
<p>from the older ones to the new ones.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not particularly rare to fly with different types</p>
<p>of radar because in the,</p>
<p>and we call the fleet replacement squadron,</p>
<p>essentially the training ground for the F18,</p>
<p>you have all sorts of F18s with different radar.</p>
<p>So you are used to having multiple ones,</p>
<p>but in the actual deployable combat squadron, we upgraded.</p>
<p>And when we upgraded, we saw that there were objects</p>
<p>on the radar that we were seeing the next day</p>
<p>with this new radar that weren&rsquo;t there with the old radar.</p>
<p>And these were sometimes the same day.</p>
<p>You might go on two flights.</p>
<p>The one in the morning might be with the older radar,</p>
<p>the one in the evening with the new radar.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d see the objects with the new radar.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not overly surprising in some sense.</p>
<p>They are more sensitive.</p>
<p>Perhaps they&rsquo;re not filtering out everything</p>
<p>they should be yet,</p>
<p>or perhaps there&rsquo;s some other type of error.</p>
<p>Maybe it needs to be calibrated, whatever.</p>
<p>It was relatively new and we were somewhat used</p>
<p>to there being software problems</p>
<p>with these types of things occasionally,</p>
<p>just like anything else.</p>
<p>And so, okay, maybe this is a radar software malfunction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting some false tracks, as we call them.</p>
<p>What were you seeing?</p>
<p>And so what we would see are representations of the objects.</p>
<p>So this is off of our radar.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not seeing a visual image here.</p>
<p>This is kind of like what&rsquo;s being displayed to us</p>
<p>almost like in a gaming fashion, right?</p>
<p>Like the icon, right?</p>
<p>So the icon is showing us, hey, something is there.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the parameters I can understand about it.</p>
<p>So this is in the cockpit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a display that&rsquo;s showing some visualization</p>
<p>with the radars detecting.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two different ways to do that.</p>
<p>The first one is like the actual data,</p>
<p>like the radar where I am,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s showing me the data kind of as if it&rsquo;s in front of me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m selecting those contacts.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another screen</p>
<p>called the situational awareness page.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of a God&rsquo;s eye view</p>
<p>that brings all that data into one spot.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m gonna talk about this from the SA page,</p>
<p>from the situational awareness page</p>
<p>versus the individual radar ones,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easier, but.</p>
<p>Can you, sorry to linger on that.</p>
<p>So the individual displays are like first person</p>
<p>and then SA is,</p>
<p>when you say God&rsquo;s eye view, it&rsquo;s like from the top,</p>
<p>the integration of all that information</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s looking down onto the earth.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is that a good way to summarize it?</p>
<p>It is, but for the aviator, it&rsquo;s slightly different</p>
<p>because those two radar displays I talked about</p>
<p>are at the bottom of that display</p>
<p>is kind of representative of where I am.</p>
<p>And so I see what&rsquo;s in front of me.</p>
<p>Whereas the situational awareness page,</p>
<p>the aircraft is located in the center of that.</p>
<p>And then all around me, based off of the data link</p>
<p>and wherever I&rsquo;m getting information from,</p>
<p>I can see that whole awareness page.</p>
<p>I can see all the situation.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna kind of talk about this</p>
<p>from the situational awareness page,</p>
<p>which is a top down view, just to kind of frame our minds</p>
<p>instead of jumping around.</p>
<p>And so what we would see out there</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;d see these indications</p>
<p>that something would be there</p>
<p>and they would have a track file.</p>
<p>That track file, that thing that represents the object</p>
<p>has a line coming out of it.</p>
<p>And that represents,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the target aspect indicator.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some tracking from the radar.</p>
<p>Correct, so it&rsquo;s showing you where the object&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>This is all pretty cool that the radar can do all this.</p>
<p>So radar locks in on different objects</p>
<p>and it tracks them over time.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming from the radar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a built in feature.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So out there we&rsquo;re seeing it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to necessarily pull things</p>
<p>into our tracker in some sense, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all out there</p>
<p>and then we can kind of choose to highlight on stuff</p>
<p>or to kind of focus in on it more so.</p>
<p>But the information should all be out there.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;d see that that target aspect indicator,</p>
<p>that line on a typical aircraft,</p>
<p>it would kind of look like this.</p>
<p>It would be coming out and it would go steady</p>
<p>and if they turned, it would be like boop, boop, boop,</p>
<p>and you see them turn, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not magic.</p>
<p>But this object, the target aspect</p>
<p>would kind of be like all over the place,</p>
<p>like kind of randomly in the 360 degrees</p>
<p>from that top down view, that line would be in any place.</p>
<p>So kind of, is it unable to determine the target aspect?</p>
<p>Is it stationary?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just how it puts it out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not used to seeing it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s necessarily super weird,</p>
<p>but it was different than what we were used to seeing</p>
<p>because we weren&rsquo;t used to seeing stationary objects</p>
<p>out there very much.</p>
<p>And what was also interesting is that</p>
<p>these weren&rsquo;t just stationary on a zero wind day, right?</p>
<p>These are stationary at 20,000 feet, 15,000 feet,</p>
<p>500 feet with the wind blowing, you know?</p>
<p>And so much like the sea, when we&rsquo;re up there fighting,</p>
<p>it affects everything.</p>
<p>We consider the wind when we&rsquo;re shooting missiles,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re flying or fuel considerations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like operating in that volume of air,</p>
<p>like the ocean, everything&rsquo;s going with the current.</p>
<p>And so anything that doesn&rsquo;t go with the current</p>
<p>is immediately kind of identifiable and strange</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why these were initially strangers</p>
<p>because they would be stationary against the wind.</p>
<p>So if you had something like a good drone</p>
<p>in a windy conditions, what would that look like?</p>
<p>Would it not come off as stationary?</p>
<p>Would it sort of float about kind of thing?</p>
<p>No, I think with the drone technology we have today,</p>
<p>they could stay within a pretty tight location.</p>
<p>Well, I meant like DJI drone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying like generically speaking,</p>
<p>not a military drone.</p>
<p>No, I have a DJI drone myself even,</p>
<p>and you know, maybe not a hundred knots,</p>
<p>but if that thing&rsquo;s in 30 or 40 and not winds,</p>
<p>the amount of distance it&rsquo;s going to be kind of</p>
<p>doing one of these, like that change</p>
<p>is not something I&rsquo;m gonna detect from maybe many miles away.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So it could look very stationary,</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t necessarily,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s interesting about this story</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s not like the one smoking gun, right?</p>
<p>You have to kind of look at everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t like about the Department of Defense</p>
<p>and just generally people&rsquo;s take on this</p>
<p>is that everything is kind of based around a single image,</p>
<p>you know, or that one case,</p>
<p>but a lot of the interestingness comes from the duration</p>
<p>or the time it&rsquo;s been out there,</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re interacting relative to other objects out there.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t get that information</p>
<p>when you just look at a frame for a second, you know?</p>
<p>Everyone kind of bites off on the shiny object, but.</p>
<p>So you yourself, from your particular slice</p>
<p>of things you&rsquo;ve experienced and seen directly</p>
<p>or indirectly, you&rsquo;ve kind of built up an intuition</p>
<p>about what are the things that were being seen.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go that far.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just been able to eliminate some variables</p>
<p>because of how long I&rsquo;ve observed it.</p>
<p>So like you said, yes, can a drone stay</p>
<p>in a particular position against the wind like that?</p>
<p>Certainly, but I don&rsquo;t think it can do that</p>
<p>and then go 0.8 Mach for four hours after that, you know?</p>
<p>And so when you look at outside of that one,</p>
<p>that moment in time, then it eliminates</p>
<p>a lot of the potential things it could be,</p>
<p>at least from my perspective.</p>
<p>So what kind of stuff did you see in the instruments?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d see them flying in patterns,</p>
<p>kind of racetrack patterns or circular patterns</p>
<p>or just going kind of straight east.</p>
<p>Occasionally see them supersonic, 1.1, 1.2 Mach,</p>
<p>but typically 0.6 to 0.8 Mach,</p>
<p>just for extremely extended periods of time,</p>
<p>essentially all the time.</p>
<p>And this is airspace where there&rsquo;s not supposed</p>
<p>to be anything else at all.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty far out there.</p>
<p>It starts 10 miles off the coast, goes like 300 miles.</p>
<p>Can you say the location that we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Off the coast of Virginia Beach.</p>
<p>Got it, and so nobody&rsquo;s supposed to be out there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible for people to be there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily restricted,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s well monitored and we&rsquo;re out there</p>
<p>every day, all day.</p>
<p>And so people know to stay clear.</p>
<p>If a Cessna goes bumbling in there,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s gonna know about it.</p>
<p>FAA is gonna call them out, gonna tell us about it.</p>
<p>So incursions happen, not a big deal,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re pretty rare, honestly,</p>
<p>because everyone knows the area</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been operating there for decades.</p>
<p>And what are the trajectories at 0.6 to 0.8 Mach</p>
<p>that these objects were taking?</p>
<p>Typically, they would be in some type of circular pattern</p>
<p>or kind of racetrack pattern when they were at those speeds,</p>
<p>or I just see them kind of,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t always like a mechanical flight description.</p>
<p>And when I say that, I mean like an autopilot</p>
<p>is gonna be just very precise, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be locked on straight.</p>
<p>Whereas I could see an airplane,</p>
<p>I could tell if the pilot&rsquo;s flying it, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not gonna be perfect.</p>
<p>The computer&rsquo;s not controlling it.</p>
<p>And these seemed more like that.</p>
<p>Not that they were imprecise,</p>
<p>but that they were even much more erratic than that.</p>
<p>So like, it wasn&rsquo;t like a straight line in a turn.</p>
<p>It was just kind of like a weird drift like that</p>
<p>in that direction.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t controlled by a dumb computer,</p>
<p>or not disrespect to computers.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t controlled by autopilot kind of technology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the sense that I got.</p>
<p>So how many people have seen them in the squadron?</p>
<p>Sort of how many times were they seen?</p>
<p>How many were there times when there&rsquo;s multiple objects?</p>
<p>Once we started seeing them on the radar enough,</p>
<p>and we would get close enough,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d actually see them on our FLIR as well.</p>
<p>So our advanced targeting pod.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially a infrared camera</p>
<p>that we use for targeting,</p>
<p>mostly in the air to surface environment.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t use it in the air to air arena.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not that good of a tool, frankly.</p>
<p>But we would see IR energy emitting from that location</p>
<p>where the radar was dropping us off.</p>
<p>So the radar, we&rsquo;d lock onto the object</p>
<p>and our sensors would all look there.</p>
<p>And so then we could see that it&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>at that right piece of sky,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s energy actually coming from there.</p>
<p>So now we started thinking that, okay,</p>
<p>maybe not radar malfunctions, maybe more,</p>
<p>maybe something is physically here, of course.</p>
<p>And then people started to try to fly by it and see it.</p>
<p>And at this point, I would say maybe 80 to 90%</p>
<p>of our squadron had probably seen one of these</p>
<p>on the radar at this point.</p>
<p>Everyone was aware of it.</p>
<p>There was small communication, I think,</p>
<p>between squadrons of the same area that had the same radar.</p>
<p>So I knew it wasn&rsquo;t just our squadron</p>
<p>for whatever strange reason,</p>
<p>because other squadrons would be out there</p>
<p>and we would talk to them,</p>
<p>like, hey, careful, there&rsquo;s an object.</p>
<p>Are you aware of that?</p>
<p>So they would be aware of it.</p>
<p>And then, of course, people would want to go see</p>
<p>what they look like, right?</p>
<p>So people would try to fly by it.</p>
<p>I try to fly by it.</p>
<p>I like how that&rsquo;s an of course.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Of course you don&rsquo;t want to fly by it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an argument against that kind of perspective</p>
<p>that maybe the thing is dangerous, so maybe we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But perhaps that&rsquo;s part of the reason</p>
<p>you want to fly by it,</p>
<p>is to understand better what it is if it&rsquo;s a threat.</p>
<p>We have a lot of context now that we didn&rsquo;t back then.</p>
<p>So it was still, hey, is this a balloon?</p>
<p>Is this a drone at a certain point?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re also aware of potential intelligence gathering</p>
<p>operations that could be going on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re up there flying our tactics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re emitting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re practicing our EW.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re turning at particular times.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff that can be learned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a secret.</p>
<p>And countries keep different fishing vessels and whatnot</p>
<p>in international waters off there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not exactly a secret</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re being observed out there.</p>
<p>So to think that a foreign nation would want to</p>
<p>somehow intercept information,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s our radar signals or jamming capabilities</p>
<p>to try to break that down or understand it better,</p>
<p>be ready for that next fight, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what scares me about this scenario</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t jump right to aliens or UFOs.</p>
<p>We thought, this is a radar malfunction</p>
<p>we need to be aware of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a safety issue.</p>
<p>And then this could be a tactical problem right here</p>
<p>because everything we do is based off a crypto</p>
<p>and locations, everything&rsquo;s classified we do out there.</p>
<p>And so over time, if you gather enough data</p>
<p>about those fights and just monitor them forever,</p>
<p>just like some nations do with other</p>
<p>piece of technology or software,</p>
<p>they could probably learn a lot.</p>
<p>So we have to be cognizant of the fact</p>
<p>and defend against it.</p>
<p>So what can you say about the other characteristics</p>
<p>of these objects like shape, size,</p>
<p>texture, luminosity, how else do you describe object?</p>
<p>Is there something that could be said?</p>
<p>So you said like this is a tech town radar step one.</p>
<p>Now you have FLIR images that can give you a sense</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s actually a physical object.</p>
<p>What else can be said about those physical objects?</p>
<p>So eventually someone did see one with their own eyeballs,</p>
<p>multiple people and they saw it</p>
<p>in a somewhat interesting way.</p>
<p>The object presented itself at the exact altitude</p>
<p>and geographic location of the entry points</p>
<p>into our working areas.</p>
<p>So we enter at a very specific point at a certain altitude</p>
<p>and people leave the areas at the same point</p>
<p>at a lower altitude.</p>
<p>Probably one of the busiest pieces of sky</p>
<p>on the eastern seaboard.</p>
<p>So two jets from my squadron went out</p>
<p>and they went flying and they entered the area</p>
<p>and one of these objects went right between the aircraft.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re flying in formation</p>
<p>and the object went between the aircraft.</p>
<p>They went between the object I think.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the object was moving.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it aggressively went at them.</p>
<p>I think it was located still there</p>
<p>and then they flew through it.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t have it on their radar.</p>
<p>And I think the radar might have been malfunctioning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that for sure.</p>
<p>I would like to look into it</p>
<p>but my supposition is that if their radar was malfunctioning</p>
<p>it would make sense that they wouldn&rsquo;t avoid the object</p>
<p>that was there</p>
<p>because they knew these were physical at that point.</p>
<p>And we would go up to these objects all the time</p>
<p>and try to see them and couldn&rsquo;t see them.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t know what it was.</p>
<p>Was it, were they just not there or being fooled?</p>
<p>Was something happening?</p>
<p>Were they moving, dropping altitude at the last minute?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going by pretty quick so it&rsquo;s difficult to tell.</p>
<p>But perhaps if his radar wasn&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t receiving energy from the jet.</p>
<p>And the jet of course didn&rsquo;t know that it was there.</p>
<p>And so whatever the case was, they flew right by</p>
<p>and they described it just as a dark gray or black cube</p>
<p>inside a clear translucent sphere.</p>
<p>And the kind of the apex of the cube</p>
<p>or touching the inside of that sphere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an image that&rsquo;s haunting.</p>
<p>So what do they think it is?</p>
<p>What did they think at that moment?</p>
<p>That they, is it just this kind of cloud of uncertainty</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just describing a geometric object?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not on radar so it&rsquo;s unclear what it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, what was the, any kind of other description</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had of it in terms of the intuition</p>
<p>from a pilot&rsquo;s perspective?</p>
<p>You have to kind of identify what a thing is.</p>
<p>To answer the first part,</p>
<p>they actually canceled the flight and came back</p>
<p>because they were, it&rsquo;s like if there&rsquo;s one of these</p>
<p>out here and we&rsquo;re almost hitting them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s right there, then perhaps we need</p>
<p>to get a different jet with better radar.</p>
<p>So they came back and they&rsquo;re in their gear</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re talking to the front desk</p>
<p>and talking to Skipper and like,</p>
<p>hey, we almost hit one of those damn things out there.</p>
<p>And this kind of was one of those kind of</p>
<p>slight watershed moments where we all were kind of like,</p>
<p>all right, like this is a serious deal now.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a, maybe we thought they were balloons</p>
<p>or drones or malfunctions, or maybe we thought it was fine.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re gonna hit one of these things,</p>
<p>then we need to take care of the situation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually when we started submitting</p>
<p>hazard reports or hazard reps to the Naval Aviation Safety</p>
<p>kind of communication network.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like a big proactive thing</p>
<p>where people are gonna go investigate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a data collection mechanism</p>
<p>so that you can kind of share that aggregate data</p>
<p>and make sure that things are progressing.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t a mechanism that would result</p>
<p>in action being taken, but we were hoping</p>
<p>to at least get the message out to whomever</p>
<p>was maybe running a classified program</p>
<p>that we were not aware of or something like that,</p>
<p>that hey, like you could kill somebody here.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve grown too big for your bridges here.</p>
<p>Take a step back.</p>
<p>So that was our concern at that point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of where we were thinking this was going.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the protocol for shooting at a thing?</p>
<p>Was there a concern that it&rsquo;s a direct threat,</p>
<p>not just surveillance, but a thing that could be a threat?</p>
<p>At least from my perspective,</p>
<p>like that never really crossed into my mind.</p>
<p>I thought it was potentially an intelligence failure</p>
<p>that could be being watched and information gathered.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t think that it was something</p>
<p>that would proactively engage me in a hostile manner.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t really make sense either too.</p>
<p>It would be shocking to like have one of these objects</p>
<p>take out an F18, but there&rsquo;s no real tactical advantage</p>
<p>other than fear perhaps.</p>
<p>Psychological, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about the psychological warfare</p>
<p>in Ukraine as a big part of the war</p>
<p>in terms of when you talk about siege warfare,</p>
<p>about wars that last for many years, for many months,</p>
<p>and then perhaps could extend to years.</p>
<p>But yes, it didn&rsquo;t seem,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t fit your conception of a threatening entity.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So looking back now from all the pieces of data</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve integrated, you&rsquo;ve personally added,</p>
<p>what do you think it could be?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it could be.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve been able to categorize it successfully</p>
<p>into a few buckets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been able to say that this could be US technology</p>
<p>that someone put in the wrong piece of sky</p>
<p>or perhaps was developed and tested in an inappropriate spot</p>
<p>by someone that wasn&rsquo;t being best practices.</p>
<p>Is there, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>is there a sort of modularity to the way</p>
<p>the military operates, the way it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>for one branch not to know about the tests of another?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable</p>
<p>to think that that could occur, right?</p>
<p>And so if we just make that assumption,</p>
<p>we can integrate that into our analysis here</p>
<p>and just say, okay, but at the point we&rsquo;re at now,</p>
<p>we have to assume that that&rsquo;s not the case, right?</p>
<p>With everything that&rsquo;s been going on</p>
<p>and the statements have been made and the hearings,</p>
<p>I think that if it was a noncommunication issue,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in big trouble at this point.</p>
<p>What about it being an object from another nation,</p>
<p>from China, from Russia?</p>
<p>Or even one of our allies, perhaps, right?</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s, you know, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s controversial</p>
<p>to say that our allies could be gathering information</p>
<p>about us or anything of that nature,</p>
<p>but that would be an extreme case,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s just important to say, right?</p>
<p>To not just say Russia or China</p>
<p>and just call them the bad guys</p>
<p>and assume that if they don&rsquo;t have it, no one can do it.</p>
<p>And so from my perspective, you know, anyone else,</p>
<p>anyone else, and it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need</p>
<p>to be a foreign power.</p>
<p>It could be a non government entity, perhaps,</p>
<p>although I think that&rsquo;s very unlikely.</p>
<p>But again, these are things you must consider</p>
<p>if you kind of throw everything,</p>
<p>everything other than the US under scrutiny.</p>
<p>But you know, from what has been reported</p>
<p>and the behaviors that have been seen,</p>
<p>it would be, I would expect to see remnants</p>
<p>of that technology elsewhere in the economy.</p>
<p>There seems to be too many things</p>
<p>that require advanced technology</p>
<p>that would be beneficial commercially,</p>
<p>as well as in other military applications</p>
<p>for it to be completely locked away</p>
<p>by one of our competitors.</p>
<p>Now I could see us perhaps locking something away</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re already in the lead</p>
<p>and having it to pull out as needed.</p>
<p>But for someone that&rsquo;s perhaps in a power struggle</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in second place,</p>
<p>they might be more aggressive with the development</p>
<p>of different types of technology</p>
<p>willing to accept bigger risks.</p>
<p>Do you think it could be natural phenomena</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t yet understand?</p>
<p>I think that there are a number of things</p>
<p>that this is going to be, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one thing at the end of the day,</p>
<p>but I certainly think that that is part</p>
<p>of what some of this could be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s what we were seeing on the East Coast,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it is related to the Roosevelt incident,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll even go out and say the Nimitz incident, but.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Roosevelt incident?</p>
<p>The Roosevelt incident, typically referred to as the gimbal</p>
<p>and or the go fast video.</p>
<p>And then the Nimitz is from what the David Fravor</p>
<p>has witnessed directly and spoken about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d just love to get your sort of interpretation</p>
<p>of those incidents.</p>
<p>But yeah, so in this particular case,</p>
<p>natural phenomena could be a part of the picture,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying not the whole picture.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, and we can&rsquo;t discount it.</p>
<p>Oh, the other thing is what about the failure</p>
<p>of pilot eyesight?</p>
<p>Like sort of some deep mixture of actual direct vision,</p>
<p>human vision system failure, and like psychology.</p>
<p>Like seeing something weird and then filling in the gaps.</p>
<p>Because in order to make sense of the weird.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to expose myself to scenarios like that</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t necessarily think are right,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve explored them to see if they could have some truth.</p>
<p>And one example is let&rsquo;s imagine a scenario</p>
<p>where if we&rsquo;re seeing these objects every day</p>
<p>off the East Coast, I can imagine a technology</p>
<p>or an operation where you had some type</p>
<p>of traditional propulsion system operating drones</p>
<p>in order to gather data like we had discussed.</p>
<p>And I could envision a clever enough adversary</p>
<p>that could perhaps destroy or somehow remove these objects</p>
<p>and replace them with new objects essentially</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not looking, right?</p>
<p>And that accounts for the large airborne time.</p>
<p>And so I explore options like that</p>
<p>and I try to see what evidence and assumptions</p>
<p>need to be made in order to prove or disprove that.</p>
<p>And you would need so much infrastructure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d need so many assets.</p>
<p>And so I try to explore some of those fallacies</p>
<p>and some of those concerns.</p>
<p>And as aviators, we&rsquo;re trained into many</p>
<p>like actual physical, like eyesight</p>
<p>and kind of illusion training.</p>
<p>So like at nighttime flying,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things that can happen</p>
<p>flying with false horizons.</p>
<p>And so we receive hours of training on that type of stuff,</p>
<p>but this just falls outside the category</p>
<p>from my perspective.</p>
<p>What was the visibility conditions</p>
<p>in the times when people were able to see it?</p>
<p>And we just earlier discussed complete nighttime, darkness.</p>
<p>In this case, was it during the day?</p>
<p>It was a perfectly clear day that particular incident, yep.</p>
<p>In a world that&rsquo;s full of mystery,</p>
<p>I have to ask what do you think is the possibility</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not of this earth origin?</p>
<p>I like the term nonhuman intelligence in a sense,</p>
<p>because again, there&rsquo;s a lot of assumptions in there</p>
<p>that may cause us to go down the wrong roads.</p>
<p>It could, you know, these could be something</p>
<p>that are weather phenomena of earth, right?</p>
<p>Or something else that is just something we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t imagine right now that&rsquo;s still of this earth.</p>
<p>If we consider extraterrestrials or something</p>
<p>that came from a physical place far away in space time,</p>
<p>you know, that leads us to some detection assumptions</p>
<p>that we would need to make.</p>
<p>And so I just try to not categorize it under anything</p>
<p>and just say, hey, is this demonstrating intelligence?</p>
<p>And start from there as a single object.</p>
<p>What can we learn about it kinematically?</p>
<p>How it&rsquo;s performing?</p>
<p>What does that mean for its energy source?</p>
<p>What does that mean for the G forces inside?</p>
<p>And then step it out a level and say, okay,</p>
<p>how are these interacting with our fighters?</p>
<p>If they are, how are they interacting with the weather</p>
<p>and their environment?</p>
<p>How are they interacting with each other?</p>
<p>So can we look at these and how they&rsquo;re interacting</p>
<p>perhaps as a swarm, especially off the East coast</p>
<p>where this is happening all the time with multiple objects.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And so we might be able to determine some things</p>
<p>about their maybe, you know, sensor capabilities</p>
<p>or the areas of focus, you know, if we can determine</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re working in conjunction with each other.</p>
<p>But, you know, seeing one little flash of an object</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t provide that type of insight.</p>
<p>But we have the systems for it, and it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>you know, an irony, but it&rsquo;s a fact of life,</p>
<p>the reality that many of these well deployed,</p>
<p>highly capable systems are held under the military umbrella,</p>
<p>which makes it difficult to provide that data</p>
<p>for scientific analysis.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s probably a lot more data on these objects</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not being, that&rsquo;s not made available,</p>
<p>probably even within the military for analysis.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of data</p>
<p>that could be made available.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been engaged with the American Institute of Aeronautics</p>
<p>and Astronautics to build, you know,</p>
<p>a large resources of cross domain expertise</p>
<p>so that if or when that data is available</p>
<p>or that there&rsquo;s additional analysis needed, you know,</p>
<p>we can spin up those teams and make that analysis.</p>
<p>So there was a recently a house intelligence subcommittee</p>
<p>hearing on UFOs that you were a part of.</p>
<p>What was the goal of that hearing?</p>
<p>And can you maybe summarize what you heard?</p>
<p>The hearings, from my perspective,</p>
<p>seemed a bit disingenuous, kind of top level.</p>
<p>I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Who was it run by, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>like who were the people involved</p>
<p>and what was the goal, the stated goal?</p>
<p>Congressman Andre Carson did chair the committee</p>
<p>and he was, I think, ultimately responsible</p>
<p>for bringing it all together.</p>
<p>You know, I think the intent from Congress</p>
<p>was to try to bring light to what has been happening</p>
<p>with the Navy and to help show the American people</p>
<p>that Congress is taking this serious</p>
<p>because something serious is happening.</p>
<p>But, you know, the sense I got seemed a bit disingenuous.</p>
<p>They talked around it a lot.</p>
<p>They, you know, advertised their love of science fiction,</p>
<p>but they, you know, they didn&rsquo;t treat this,</p>
<p>I would say, in the manner it deserved</p>
<p>as a potential tactical threat</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s coming from a foreign power.</p>
<p>And I get it though, at the same day,</p>
<p>they have very specific objectives</p>
<p>within the DOD, right?</p>
<p>They have a very important job.</p>
<p>Their job isn&rsquo;t necessarily to do exploratory science</p>
<p>for no reason.</p>
<p>So I applaud and I encourage their efforts</p>
<p>on the intelligence side to help understand this,</p>
<p>but my concern is that they play a role</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not well suited for, which is doing science.</p>
<p>And the Pentagon has opened a new office</p>
<p>to investigate UFOs called</p>
<p>All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.</p>
<p>What do you think about this office?</p>
<p>Do you think it can help alleviate in a way</p>
<p>which this hearing perhaps has failed</p>
<p>to improve more the scientific rigor</p>
<p>and the seriousness of investigating UFOs?</p>
<p>I think that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a step that was taken</p>
<p>because the previous step didn&rsquo;t happen, right?</p>
<p>So the AOI MSG was the progeny, essentially,</p>
<p>of the AARO or AERO.</p>
<p>And the name was changed because nothing was happening</p>
<p>and it was essentially just a confusing mess of words</p>
<p>that were created to make this topic unpalatable.</p>
<p>The Airborne Objects Identification</p>
<p>Synchronization Management Group.</p>
<p>Quite the mouthful.</p>
<p>I practice that.</p>
<p>But the new All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office,</p>
<p>from my perspective at least,</p>
<p>at least the perspective that they&rsquo;re putting out,</p>
<p>they seem to want to be open.</p>
<p>They put out a Twitter handle,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going out on Twitter and communicating,</p>
<p>saying they want to keep this open.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s gonna run into a classification wall.</p>
<p>Well, so Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick seems like an interesting guy.</p>
<p>He does, yes.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s got a, Evan looked in too deeply,</p>
<p>but he seems to have sort of,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s coming from like a science research perspective,</p>
<p>like a background.</p>
<p>So he might be, at least in the right mindset,</p>
<p>the right background to kind of lead a serious investigation.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say generally,</p>
<p>the office has been receptive to AIAA reaching out</p>
<p>in order to collaborate, which has been a positive sign.</p>
<p>Also pass the same kudos to Dr. Spergel</p>
<p>and NASA&rsquo;s effort as well.</p>
<p>I see these organizations that are standing up,</p>
<p>I do see them as good faith efforts</p>
<p>that are coming about through a lot of difficulty</p>
<p>and negotiation most likely, right?</p>
<p>And I see these as a small door opening</p>
<p>that if we can take advantage of,</p>
<p>can lead to a much more productive relationship</p>
<p>between these organizations.</p>
<p>How do you put pressure on this kind of thing?</p>
<p>Does it come from the civilian leadership?</p>
<p>Does it come from sort of Congress and presidents?</p>
<p>Does it come from the public?</p>
<p>Does the public have any power to put pressure on this?</p>
<p>Or is the giant wall of bureaucracy</p>
<p>going to protect it against any public pressure?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve been in that latter state for a while,</p>
<p>but society seems to be a bit different nowadays.</p>
<p>We have the ability to communicate and to group</p>
<p>and to form relationships in a way</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been able to be present in the past.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been able to do research for better or worse</p>
<p>on our own in a way that hasn&rsquo;t been able to happen before.</p>
<p>And so I sense that people are a bit less willing</p>
<p>to kind of buy the bottom line statement</p>
<p>from those in power as they used to be</p>
<p>back when they didn&rsquo;t have access to those tools.</p>
<p>And so I do think there is a massive role</p>
<p>for the general society, general populace to play</p>
<p>to show that they are interested in this.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t think the politicians</p>
<p>or the leaders in the Pentagon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t like this topic necessarily</p>
<p>or think it&rsquo;s toxic per se,</p>
<p>but they exist in a culture where this has been toxic</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t feel comfortable talking about it.</p>
<p>And these are people that have spent their entire careers</p>
<p>working towards a goal and getting to very high positions</p>
<p>within government.</p>
<p>And so this is very against their nature</p>
<p>to take a stance on a topic like this.</p>
<p>And so the fact that these are standing up,</p>
<p>even if they do have a small budget</p>
<p>or if they struggled a bit at first,</p>
<p>I still think it&rsquo;s a massive change</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a big step away from that stigma</p>
<p>that has been pervading this topic for so long.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re actually part of alleviating the stigma</p>
<p>for somebody that&rsquo;s as credible, as intelligent,</p>
<p>as varied in background, able to speak about these things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big risk that you took,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s extremely valuable</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s alleviating the stigma.</p>
<p>I thank you for saying that,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t feel like much of a risk for me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come out about aliens or whatever.</p>
<p>I had a safety problem that I started asking questions about.</p>
<p>And I went down a road</p>
<p>as a Navy trained aviation safety officer, right?</p>
<p>That sent me to school for six weeks</p>
<p>and Pensacola would be a safety officer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost hitting these objects</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not something that happened in the past</p>
<p>and we want to understand it, it&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>Like these occurrences are still happening.</p>
<p>Aviators are flying right now,</p>
<p>are still flying by these things.</p>
<p>And in fact, I mentioned I was an instructor pilot.</p>
<p>And I had a student call me about eight months ago or so.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, hey, sir, I made it to the fleet finally.</p>
<p>I had trained him how to fly.</p>
<p>And then he goes to F18, he goes another year of training.</p>
<p>And then he gets out to his squadron on the East Coast</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s flying with a senior member of the base,</p>
<p>NAS Oceana, where the fighters fly out of Senior 0506.</p>
<p>And it was kind of a bad weather day.</p>
<p>And so they said, hey, if the weather&rsquo;s not good enough</p>
<p>for us to do this dog fighting set,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go out and do a UAP hunt,</p>
<p>and see if we can&rsquo;t find any things</p>
<p>or take a look at them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was ingest or not,</p>
<p>but I actually would say it&rsquo;s not ingest</p>
<p>because there were notices that were being briefed</p>
<p>about this being a safety hazard at this point.</p>
<p>And so now that I think about it, it likely wasn&rsquo;t ingest.</p>
<p>Long story short, they went flying.</p>
<p>The weather was too bad.</p>
<p>They did go on a UFO hunt and they physically saw one.</p>
<p>And he called me up and said,</p>
<p>hey, sir, I saw a Cuban sphere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still out here years later.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s almost like a generational issue</p>
<p>for these fighter pilots, at least on East Coast.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s great that they can talk about it, right?</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>They feel at least comfortable.</p>
<p>They have a reporting mechanism.</p>
<p>And so that was one of the problems that I noticed</p>
<p>that we have a lot of reporting mechanisms</p>
<p>to take care of safety issues and even tactical issues</p>
<p>when the time&rsquo;s right in order to keep track</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no way to communicate about this.</p>
<p>Sure, we could submit a hazard report,</p>
<p>but nothing&rsquo;s actually being investigated</p>
<p>and if this is a tactical vulnerability or something more,</p>
<p>it deserves attention.</p>
<p>If I could ask your sort of take your opinion</p>
<p>of the different UFO sightings</p>
<p>that the DOD has released videos on.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the Tic Tac UFO</p>
<p>that David Fravor and others have sighted?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a truly anomalous experience.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do like mental models in my head</p>
<p>to find potential solutions to discredit that, right?</p>
<p>Like as much as I try, right?</p>
<p>Just as a logical process, as a practice,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t pick it apart in the way</p>
<p>that we were just talking about a moment ago</p>
<p>about thousands of drones being like sent up</p>
<p>in very tricky manners, right?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really bring myself to a clever solution</p>
<p>that other than just saying the pilots are lying</p>
<p>or it was error, you know?</p>
<p>And I believe, you know, I know Dave Fravor,</p>
<p>you know, I consider him a friend, we talk a lot.</p>
<p>I have zero, zero reason to disbelieve anything he says.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with you, but in terms of the actual UFO,</p>
<p>is there something anomalous and interesting to you</p>
<p>about that particular case?</p>
<p>Maybe one interesting aspect there is how much</p>
<p>do I understand about the water surface</p>
<p>and underwater aspects of these UFOs?</p>
<p>It seems like a lot of the discussions</p>
<p>is about the movement of this particular thing</p>
<p>that seems to be weird, anomalous, seems to defy physics,</p>
<p>but what about stuff that&rsquo;s happening underwater?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting to me.</p>
<p>If I had advanced technology, I would certainly</p>
<p>like to operate in part underwater</p>
<p>because you can hide a lot of stuff there.</p>
<p>You think it would be somewhat as easy</p>
<p>as traveling through interstellar space, at least, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I wish I had a great answer for that,</p>
<p>but as an aviator, that&rsquo;s kind of a black box for us.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have great, what I would call</p>
<p>cross domain tracking, right?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see something go underwater</p>
<p>and then follow it underwater.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s literally not your domain,</p>
<p>like underwater, like leave that for somebody else.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you know, I use that terminology</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of important, right?</p>
<p>Cross domain tracking is something that we haven&rsquo;t had</p>
<p>to necessarily worry about, right?</p>
<p>Because airplanes operated in the air</p>
<p>and submarines operated underwater</p>
<p>and space planes operate in space, right?</p>
<p>But you know, there&rsquo;s going to be, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to blur, I think, as we move along here,</p>
<p>especially in the air and space regime</p>
<p>and being able to perhaps transition my radar contact</p>
<p>at 40,000 feet to another radar system</p>
<p>that can track it up to 200,000 feet,</p>
<p>you know, that might be a value.</p>
<p>And so we seem to be missing that right now.</p>
<p>So what about the go fast and the gimbal videos</p>
<p>that you mentioned earlier?</p>
<p>There was a, like, what&rsquo;s interesting there to you?</p>
<p>So the gimbal, I&rsquo;ll talk about that one first.</p>
<p>I was airborne for that one.</p>
<p>The person that recorded it was a good friend of mine,</p>
<p>but I mean, both air crew, I knew both of them,</p>
<p>but the wizard himself, very close friends,</p>
<p>went through a lot of her training together.</p>
<p>We went to the same fleet squadron.</p>
<p>He ended up transitioning to be a pilot</p>
<p>and then came to where I was instructing.</p>
<p>So I got to instruct him a bit on his transition.</p>
<p>And, you know, the way that was,</p>
<p>was we went out on a air to air training mission.</p>
<p>So simulating a air fight against our own guys,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re acting like the bad guys</p>
<p>and kind of go head to head against each other.</p>
<p>And when we fly on those missions,</p>
<p>we all fly out together, more or less,</p>
<p>we set up and then we kind of attrite from the fight</p>
<p>as we either, you know, run out of gas or something happens.</p>
<p>And so people usually go back onesies or twosies.</p>
<p>And so the air crew that recorded the gimbal,</p>
<p>they were going back to the boat</p>
<p>and we were on what&rsquo;s called a workup training event.</p>
<p>And so this is like a month on the boat</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re essentially conducting war time operations,</p>
<p>more or less, to stress ourselves out</p>
<p>and to kind of do the last training block</p>
<p>before we go on deployment, essentially.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty high stress.</p>
<p>They actually do send aircraft from like land bases</p>
<p>to kind of try to penetrate</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re expected to go intercept them.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re kind of practicing like we play.</p>
<p>And so he saw these objects on the radar,</p>
<p>the gimbal and a fleet of other aircraft or vehicles.</p>
<p>And they initially thought it was part</p>
<p>of the training exercise that they were sending something</p>
<p>in to try to penetrate the airspace.</p>
<p>And so they, you know, they flew over to it</p>
<p>and as they got close enough to get on the FLIR,</p>
<p>you know, I think everyone has heard their reaction</p>
<p>and they realized that it wasn&rsquo;t something</p>
<p>they were expecting to see.</p>
<p>Can you actually describe what&rsquo;s in the video</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the reaction in case they haven&rsquo;t seen it?</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of swearing.</p>
<p>But so what you see on the FLIR footage</p>
<p>is a black or white, depending on when you look at it,</p>
<p>object that&rsquo;s somewhat shaped like a gimbal.</p>
<p>It appears almost as if someone put two plates together</p>
<p>and then there seems to be almost like a small funnel</p>
<p>of IR energy that&rsquo;s at the top of the bottom</p>
<p>of those plates in a sense.</p>
<p>So almost as if, you know, there&rsquo;s a stick going in</p>
<p>between two plates, but not that pronounced, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an energy field that kind of went to a funnel</p>
<p>on the top and the bottom,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s being portrayed on the FLIR.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of conversation about that being glare,</p>
<p>things of that nature,</p>
<p>but it was actually a very tight IR image.</p>
<p>It just was nondescript shape, which was interesting.</p>
<p>Typically we would see the skin of the aircraft,</p>
<p>we can see the flames coming out of the exhaust,</p>
<p>especially at those ranges.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>And there was no flames or there&rsquo;s no exhaust here.</p>
<p>There was no exhaust, there was no, you know,</p>
<p>there was no outgassing of repellent in any manner, right?</p>
<p>It was just an object that had nothing emitting from it</p>
<p>that was stationary in the sky.</p>
<p>Well, not stationary, but it was moving along a path, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t falling out of the sky.</p>
<p>And it continued along, if we were to consider it</p>
<p>from a God&rsquo;s eye view, again, on the SA page,</p>
<p>it continued along in a path.</p>
<p>And from the perspective, that top down view,</p>
<p>it just went in another direction.</p>
<p>So no, just an instantaneous direction change</p>
<p>from that perspective.</p>
<p>You also hear them, you know, very excitedly talking</p>
<p>on the tapes about, you know, whatever the heck this thing is</p>
<p>and look at the SA, there&rsquo;s a whole formation of them.</p>
<p>And so the SA is a situational awareness page.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s a large display that gives</p>
<p>that God&rsquo;s eye view of all the radar contacts.</p>
<p>So the video is actually showing just one</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re speaking about many of them</p>
<p>on the SA display.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And what they essentially saw was,</p>
<p>if we were to consider above the object north,</p>
<p>so kind of offset to the north of the object,</p>
<p>there was a formation of about somewhere</p>
<p>between four and six of these objects</p>
<p>in a rough wedge formation, you know,</p>
<p>so kind of side by side like this.</p>
<p>And again, not in a like autopilot type manner</p>
<p>where it was very stiff.</p>
<p>It was very kind of non mechanical,</p>
<p>the flight mechanics again.</p>
<p>And these objects were in that formation</p>
<p>and they were going along and then they turned</p>
<p>pretty sharply, but they still had a radius of turn</p>
<p>and then went back in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>And during that turn, they were kind of like</p>
<p>all over the place.</p>
<p>Like it wasn&rsquo;t tight.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t even like super,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t flying in a way I would expect them</p>
<p>to be flying in relation to a flight lead.</p>
<p>They were flying as if they were flying close</p>
<p>to each other, but not in formation,</p>
<p>which was kind of strange, right?</p>
<p>And then when they rolled out,</p>
<p>they kind of tightened back up.</p>
<p>Like, so when they basically,</p>
<p>they started that turn and then 180 degrees out,</p>
<p>essentially they start flowing in the opposite direction</p>
<p>and kind of got back in that formation.</p>
<p>And while that was happening,</p>
<p>the gimbal object was proceeding, let&rsquo;s say left to right.</p>
<p>And as those, the formation kind of turned up to the north</p>
<p>and was just passing back it,</p>
<p>the gimbal just kind of went back in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>So to follow it back in that direction.</p>
<p>And in the FLIR itself, you see the object</p>
<p>changes orientation quite a bit.</p>
<p>So you see it more or less level,</p>
<p>maybe candid about 45 degrees.</p>
<p>And then you see it kind of moving around like this,</p>
<p>almost as if it was a gimbal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to learn after some,</p>
<p>having seen some research online</p>
<p>and people really looking into this,</p>
<p>that it seemed that the object actually climbed</p>
<p>during that maneuver.</p>
<p>And so the reason it looked like it turned immediately</p>
<p>is because it turned like this.</p>
<p>It turned in a vertical fashion like that,</p>
<p>which is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like another example of a flight mechanics</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t normally operate</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t change our directions</p>
<p>by maneuvering in the vertical.</p>
<p>If we can help it, you&rsquo;re just killing the fuel.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re like a surveillance platform</p>
<p>looking to spend as much time around something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna climb 500 feet every time you make a turn.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re Tom Cruise.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re Tom Cruise, naturally.</p>
<p>Okay, so is that one of the more impressive</p>
<p>flight mechanics you&rsquo;ve seen in video forms</p>
<p>or not the direct eyesight reports,</p>
<p>but like in terms of video evidence that we have?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>We were seeing a lot of these,</p>
<p>but we weren&rsquo;t just going on recording them all day.</p>
<p>We just kind of put them in that safety bucket,</p>
<p>be like, all right, there&rsquo;s objects over there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just not gonna go near it.</p>
<p>And so we weren&rsquo;t putting our sensors on them that much.</p>
<p>We were gathering the data kind of secondarily,</p>
<p>but we weren&rsquo;t primarily focusing on it</p>
<p>to see all the details.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating because you have a busy day.</p>
<p>You have a lot to do.</p>
<p>All right, well, there&rsquo;s some weird stuff going on there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just not gonna go there.</p>
<p>And that says something about human nature,</p>
<p>about the way that bureaucracies function,</p>
<p>the way the military functions.</p>
<p>It fills up your day with busy, important things,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get to, I mean, that is something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m in a sort of absurd way worry about,</p>
<p>which is like we fill our days with so much busyness</p>
<p>than when truly beautiful things happen,</p>
<p>whatever they are, truly anomalous things.</p>
<p>We just won&rsquo;t pay attention</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t fit our busy schedule.</p>
<p>Beautiful, I think that&rsquo;s right on the nose.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s on my nose because I didn&rsquo;t give this topic</p>
<p>the attention it deserved until I left, right?</p>
<p>Until I left and I went to be an instructor pilot</p>
<p>where I had more time.</p>
<p>I had more downtime to kind of process and think</p>
<p>and get out of exactly what you just described.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of what broke me out of it</p>
<p>and got me thinking more about it.</p>
<p>Why do you think the DOD released these videos?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Did the DOD release it or did they kind of get out</p>
<p>on their own in some sense?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question,</p>
<p>but my understanding of the situation</p>
<p>is that the DOD talked about them so much</p>
<p>because they were already out there in a sense.</p>
<p>And so they had a choice where they could have</p>
<p>just straight up lied and said it wasn&rsquo;t theirs or it was fake.</p>
<p>But again, I think our culture now is too open</p>
<p>and the information moves too freely to do things like that.</p>
<p>And it kind of left them in a pickle</p>
<p>that they had to respond to.</p>
<p>So what was the role of Pentagon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Advanced Aerospace Threat Intelligence Program, AATIP?</p>
<p>From your perspective, from what you know,</p>
<p>maybe your intuition, is AATIP a real thing that existed?</p>
<p>I was in a position as an aviator</p>
<p>that never would have exposed me to anything like that.</p>
<p>But I was curious about what people knew.</p>
<p>And I think in my mind, maybe you hoped or,</p>
<p>hope someone was looking into this in some sense.</p>
<p>But on the day that Gimbal was recorded,</p>
<p>I heard that they caught something extra interesting</p>
<p>on the FLIR, and I went to the Intel debrief space</p>
<p>to go see the film.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s gathered around watching it,</p>
<p>very interesting, and I heard the admiral was coming down.</p>
<p>And so I was like, I&rsquo;m gonna hang out back quietly,</p>
<p>mind my own business, and just wanna see his reaction,</p>
<p>try to read it to see if this is brand new</p>
<p>or if it is something that they&rsquo;ve been dealing with.</p>
<p>And you know, he came in and he watched a video</p>
<p>for like five or six seconds,</p>
<p>and he went, mm, and then like turned around and walked out.</p>
<p>And you know, I was like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s definitely seen these before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that you only watch that for a few seconds</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have more interest.</p>
<p>It was, you know, too bizarre.</p>
<p>So kind of going back, does the office exist?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I&rsquo;ve heard that the admiral essentially</p>
<p>reported back to the Pentagon about that case real time,</p>
<p>essentially, after he left, right?</p>
<p>So he basically went back and I was told he reported that</p>
<p>to either ATEP directly or to other, you know,</p>
<p>somehow the information got there.</p>
<p>So from my perspective and from what I&rsquo;ve experienced,</p>
<p>it seems like, yes, it was a thing.</p>
<p>But you know, as an aviator,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know either way, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just my experience from what happened.</p>
<p>But it seems like there&rsquo;s somewhere to report to.</p>
<p>At the time, it seemed like there was at least someplace</p>
<p>to complain to, if not report to.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about sort of people that are taking</p>
<p>a serious look at the videos</p>
<p>and just the different UFO sighting reports.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a person named Meg West who is a skeptic</p>
<p>and tries to take a skeptical view</p>
<p>on every single piece of evidence on these UFO sightings.</p>
<p>What do you think about his analysis?</p>
<p>He tries to analyze in a way that debunks some of these</p>
<p>videos and assign probabilities to their explanations,</p>
<p>sort of leaning towards things that give a very low</p>
<p>probability to alien extraterrestrial type of explanations</p>
<p>for these UFOs.</p>
<p>What do you think about his approach to these analysis?</p>
<p>Well, two parts to his approach.</p>
<p>One, I commend him for all the good work</p>
<p>and effort he put into it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen him build some models and things of that nature.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s absolutely needed</p>
<p>in this environment.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s asking anyone to believe anyone here, right?</p>
<p>Trust but verify should certainly be the mantra.</p>
<p>But where I have a disagreement with his approach</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s approaching from a debunker standpoint.</p>
<p>And from my perspective, not speaking for everyone,</p>
<p>but when I hear that, that tells me that you&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>towards a particular conclusion,</p>
<p>which has been a very safe process for the past X years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been like a very safe business to be in</p>
<p>to tell people that they haven&rsquo;t seen aliens,</p>
<p>but times have changed a little bit.</p>
<p>And the tactics I&rsquo;ve seen to try to retain that</p>
<p>view on reality has included things such as</p>
<p>completely dismissing what the aircrew are saying.</p>
<p>And I think that is a fallacy to think that</p>
<p>we have to take the human outside of that analysis.</p>
<p>So those are the two things I disagree with.</p>
<p>When you put the night vision on and you look at the stars</p>
<p>and you look out there in the vast cosmos,</p>
<p>only a small fraction of which we can see,</p>
<p>how many intelligent alien civilizations</p>
<p>do you think are out there?</p>
<p>Do you think about this kind of stuff?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m of the theory that we are not</p>
<p>the only people out there.</p>
<p>I think it would be a statistically silly comment</p>
<p>to assume we are, although I get that we are</p>
<p>the only data point that we currently have.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m willing to jump over that fence</p>
<p>and say that yes, there most likely is</p>
<p>intelligent life elsewhere.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ll concede that it is a possibility</p>
<p>we are early or it could be limited</p>
<p>or it could be in a manner that we don&rsquo;t recognize</p>
<p>or can really understand.</p>
<p>I spend so much time thinking about</p>
<p>how we anthropomorphize things on this UFO topic.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done it to ourselves with media in a sense.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve trained ourselves what to think about,</p>
<p>what we think is true or what this would be like.</p>
<p>And by doing so, I think we&rsquo;re closing ourselves off</p>
<p>to a lot of what the possibilities could be</p>
<p>and the things that we could miss.</p>
<p>You beautifully put that the thing that drew you</p>
<p>to fighter jets is the technology.</p>
<p>So if you were to think, to imagine</p>
<p>from an alien perspective, what kind of technologies</p>
<p>would we first encounter as human beings</p>
<p>if we were to meet another alien civilization</p>
<p>in the next few centuries?</p>
<p>What kind of thing would we see?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re now at the cutting edge</p>
<p>and you see the quick progress that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>That was happening throughout the 20th century,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening now with greater degrees of autonomy</p>
<p>with robots and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What do you think we will encounter?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna see the ability to manipulate matter</p>
<p>like we used to manipulate information.</p>
<p>Like I think that&rsquo;s what, whether that means</p>
<p>being able to pop something on the table</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t exist or to influence a chemical reaction</p>
<p>somewhere, but being able to manipulate</p>
<p>and treat matter as if it was information.</p>
<p>And so being able to design specific materials,</p>
<p>being able to move past a lot of the barriers</p>
<p>that seem to limit our progress with things</p>
<p>such as miniaturized fusion or even just fusion in general</p>
<p>is a lot of it is matter based, is material based</p>
<p>and our ability to not manipulate,</p>
<p>we can only discover materials in a sense.</p>
<p>And so I think that a complete mastery</p>
<p>of physical reality would be one of the key traits</p>
<p>of a very intelligent species.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re actually working on some,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but sort of quantum mechanical simulation</p>
<p>to understand materials.</p>
<p>So is that, do you see sort of the early steps</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing at quantum computing side</p>
<p>to start to simulate, to deeper understand materials,</p>
<p>but maybe to engineer and to mess with materials</p>
<p>at the very low level that aliens will be able to do</p>
<p>and hopefully humans will be able to do soon?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>so if we think about how, what materials are made of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a collection of atoms,</p>
<p>but each one of those atoms has a lot of data</p>
<p>associated with it.</p>
<p>So if we wanna kind of calculate</p>
<p>how they interact with each other,</p>
<p>it requires a massive amount of computational resources,</p>
<p>so much so that it can&rsquo;t be done in a lot of cases</p>
<p>with classical computers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where quantum computers come in.</p>
<p>Although we don&rsquo;t have a perfectly functioning</p>
<p>quantum computer at this point,</p>
<p>one of the things that we&rsquo;re working at</p>
<p>at quantum general materials is to essentially</p>
<p>bridge that gap between what a classical computer can do</p>
<p>as far as simulating materials.</p>
<p>And of course, what a fully functioning quantum computer</p>
<p>would mean for being able to design materials.</p>
<p>And so, you know, having the ability to study matter</p>
<p>at a very fundamental level</p>
<p>and unleashing artificial intelligence</p>
<p>to machine learning on that problem,</p>
<p>I think is, you know, in a sense, you know,</p>
<p>alien in a way that we&rsquo;re able to advance our science</p>
<p>using, you know, a process that we may not fully understand</p>
<p>with perhaps a non human based intelligence in some sense.</p>
<p>And so we may find patterns in the processes, right?</p>
<p>How does our machine learning output, you know,</p>
<p>can we match behaviors with what we&rsquo;re observing</p>
<p>with what may be a machine learning algorithm with output,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Can we try to classify the intelligence</p>
<p>in that manner, perhaps?</p>
<p>And so, you know, at GenMatt,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re looking at these materials,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re considering what these algorithms</p>
<p>could have used for later on.</p>
<p>Could we perhaps reverse the process</p>
<p>and determine what a unique or anomalous material,</p>
<p>what type of properties it potentially could have?</p>
<p>And you said GenMatt, right?</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, what is GenMatt?</p>
<p>GenMatt is a quantum general material.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the company I work for.</p>
<p>We essentially are working on a couple of verticals.</p>
<p>One of them is our quantum chemistry work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re essentially, we&rsquo;re bridging the gap</p>
<p>between essentially physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on those problems and again,</p>
<p>implementing artificial intelligence machine learning</p>
<p>into that process so that we can design those materials</p>
<p>from the ground up.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are what we consider</p>
<p>a vertically integrated material science company,</p>
<p>which means we can generate our own data.</p>
<p>And so within the next quarter coming up,</p>
<p>we are launching a satellite in the space.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have a fairly advanced hyperspectral sensor</p>
<p>in there, which is intended to be the first launch</p>
<p>that will help us detect different types of materials</p>
<p>using our advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna be leveraging that experience</p>
<p>in order to better analyze that data.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So materials that are strange or novel out there in space.</p>
<p>Not necessarily, but we&rsquo;ll be looking back at Earth</p>
<p>to be able to detect mineral deposits on Earth.</p>
<p>Got it, got it.</p>
<p>Getting the greater perspective from out in space</p>
<p>to do analysis of different materials.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was really impressed by the DeepMind.</p>
<p>I got to hang out with DeepMind recently</p>
<p>and they really impressed me</p>
<p>with the possibility of the application,</p>
<p>as you were saying, of machine learning</p>
<p>in the context of quantum mechanical simulation</p>
<p>for materials, so to understand materials.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really, really interesting.</p>
<p>So manipulate matter, huh?</p>
<p>I would say the next thing is horses, right?</p>
<p>Or maybe fields.</p>
<p>So manipulating or managing gravity.</p>
<p>Can we maneuver within fields in some manner</p>
<p>that allows us to perhaps move propellant less</p>
<p>or in other manners, right?</p>
<p>And so I think essentially having a deeper understanding</p>
<p>of different fields and being able to interact with them,</p>
<p>I think would be a potential avenue for travel</p>
<p>or advanced travel, right?</p>
<p>Propellant less travel.</p>
<p>Can we quantum entangle gravity fields together</p>
<p>and propel a ship by the gravity field of a planet,</p>
<p>the mass of a planet, and a drive on a ship?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s all sorts of interesting things, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, people will look back at people like you</p>
<p>and say, well, they used to fly,</p>
<p>like with this kind of propellant,</p>
<p>it seems like to be a very antiquated way of flying,</p>
<p>and they were very impressed with themselves,</p>
<p>these humans, that they could fly like birds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like so much energy is used to fly</p>
<p>such short distances from that perspective.</p>
<p>We can only throw so many rocks out the back.</p>
<p>There needs to be a better way.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It just seems dumb, like these.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Flintstones or something like that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good at it, but there&rsquo;s a limit, right?</p>
<p>Like we need to be good.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an interesting sort of trade off.</p>
<p>How much do you invest in getting really good at it?</p>
<p>I tend to believe the reason why it would be very important</p>
<p>and very powerful to put a human on Mars</p>
<p>is not necessarily for the exploration facet,</p>
<p>but in all the different technologies that come from that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about putting humans</p>
<p>in extreme conditions where we figure out</p>
<p>how to make it less extreme, more comfortable.</p>
<p>And for that, we invent things,</p>
<p>like the DOD sort of helping invent the internet</p>
<p>and all the different technologies we&rsquo;ve invented.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like an indirect consequence</p>
<p>of solving difficult problems,</p>
<p>whether that problem means winning wars</p>
<p>or colonizing other planets.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think Mars will help us figure out</p>
<p>propulsion systems or to crack open physics</p>
<p>to where you can travel close to the speed of light</p>
<p>or faster than the speed of light,</p>
<p>but it will help us figure out</p>
<p>how to build some cool technology here on Earth, I think.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a big proponent of doing really difficult things,</p>
<p>really difficult engineering things</p>
<p>to see what kind of technologies emerge from that.</p>
<p>But let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Do you think US government is hiding some technology</p>
<p>like alien spacecraft technology?</p>
<p>I have no information either way.</p>
<p>And if you did, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t tell me.</p>
<p>But my assumptions, like what did my heart tell me?</p>
<p>My heart tells me something&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but I have no evidence for that.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s me wanting something to go on.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a human feeling to want to know</p>
<p>that my government&rsquo;s in control</p>
<p>of what some strange unknown thing is.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense if such a thing happened?</p>
<p>Would this kind of information leak?</p>
<p>Would this kind of information be released by the government?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the worry that you have</p>
<p>is because when you don&rsquo;t understand a thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s novel, you want to hide it</p>
<p>so that some kind of enemy doesn&rsquo;t get access to it</p>
<p>and use it against you.</p>
<p>I wonder if that is the underlying assumption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one people always jump to,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s for to maintain secrecy of technology.</p>
<p>And I assume that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s any other reasons</p>
<p>that we would want to not talk about it.</p>
<p>I imagine that such information would have a shock</p>
<p>to the social economic system of any country,</p>
<p>if not the world.</p>
<p>And so I wonder if perhaps that was part</p>
<p>of the concern as well, how society can react to it.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re anti fragile enough now</p>
<p>with everything that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and with our communication networks that,</p>
<p>why not now?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I think about as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, the effect on the mass psyche of something like this,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s another intelligence out there.</p>
<p>We had trouble enough to deal with a pandemic,</p>
<p>to have something of this scale,</p>
<p>basically having just an inkling of a phenomena</p>
<p>that we have no understanding of</p>
<p>and could lead to complete destruction</p>
<p>of human civilization or a flourishing of it.</p>
<p>And what do you do?</p>
<p>What does a bureaucracy of government do with that?</p>
<p>Especially when they&rsquo;re the ones holding the range of power</p>
<p>and such a communication would relinquish that power</p>
<p>essentially, to some degree.</p>
<p>Since you think there&rsquo;s aliens out there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re somebody that&rsquo;s thought about war quite a bit,</p>
<p>do you think alien civilizations,</p>
<p>when we meet them, would want war?</p>
<p>Would they be a danger to us?</p>
<p>Would they be a friend to us?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition about intelligences out there?</p>
<p>My intuition tells me that when two people like yourself</p>
<p>or myself or anyone get together,</p>
<p>often the output is greater than the individuals.</p>
<p>And when we work together,</p>
<p>we can typically do things that are more impressive</p>
<p>and better than if a single person works alone.</p>
<p>And now I know that war has driven technological progress,</p>
<p>but perhaps there&rsquo;s other mechanisms that can do so.</p>
<p>But regardless, I wonder if we truly think</p>
<p>about an advanced society that has been perhaps thousands</p>
<p>or millions of years ahead of us,</p>
<p>I would imagine that same truth to be there,</p>
<p>that people working together or creatures working together</p>
<p>is a good thing for society or its society as a whole.</p>
<p>And if we consider that,</p>
<p>as we imagine a society growing and expanding,</p>
<p>in a sense, the ultimate output of a planet</p>
<p>could only be achieved in some senses</p>
<p>if everyone was working towards the same goal.</p>
<p>And there might be wonders and secrets and things</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t imagine just simply because of the timeframes</p>
<p>that we live under and we think in.</p>
<p>But if a planet has a single unit</p>
<p>and it almost is as an entity itself at a certain level,</p>
<p>if everything&rsquo;s working towards the same output,</p>
<p>I could almost imagine an intelligent species</p>
<p>that approached us planet to planet</p>
<p>instead of person to person,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ve evolved</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve assumed any intelligent species</p>
<p>would understand that working together is better than not.</p>
<p>And so my heart tells me that at a certain point,</p>
<p>love and caring and the desire to work together</p>
<p>is much more powerful than the technological progress</p>
<p>that war would bring.</p>
<p>I hope so as well.</p>
<p>Well, let me jump to the AI topic that you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done research and development efforts</p>
<p>focused on multiagent intelligence</p>
<p>for collaborative autonomy,</p>
<p>machine learning AI stuff</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about for combat,</p>
<p>for air to air combat,</p>
<p>manned, unmanned teaming technologies,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s some interesting ideas in this space</p>
<p>that fascinate you?</p>
<p>Randomness, being able to not predict</p>
<p>what the enemy is doing almost no matter what,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a level of randomness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s within the tactical envelope.</p>
<p>Even if utility of randomness.</p>
<p>The utility of randomness in an increasing.</p>
<p>Sounds like a book you should write.</p>
<p>That would be a good title.</p>
<p>Name my band.</p>
<p>Name your band?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, can you elaborate that?</p>
<p>So like trying to deeper understand</p>
<p>how you can integrate randomness through AI</p>
<p>in the context of combat.</p>
<p>In order to make yourself,</p>
<p>in order to take away the enemy&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to try to predict what you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>to disrupt their technological progress cycles</p>
<p>so that they don&rsquo;t have a clear target to aim at.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have a clear target to aim at,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to hit it.</p>
<p>Additionally, more distribution of assets and capability.</p>
<p>So imagine being able to digitally model</p>
<p>your weapon or your system</p>
<p>or your entire tactical engagement or scenario,</p>
<p>or allow a machine learning</p>
<p>to help you better understand the technology</p>
<p>that you need to build</p>
<p>in order to defeat a particular scenario.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking hardware now, not just the tactic itself.</p>
<p>And being able to use large amounts of simulation</p>
<p>and machine learning to build individual assets</p>
<p>that are small boutique using advanced manufacturing</p>
<p>techniques for a mission or for a particular battle.</p>
<p>Instead of just having these large things against an enemy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building systems and technology for individual cases.</p>
<p>What about manned and unmanned teaming?</p>
<p>So man and machine working together.</p>
<p>Is there interesting ideas there?</p>
<p>I approach it from the position</p>
<p>that the human should be commanding</p>
<p>from the highest level possible, right?</p>
<p>So mission, objective, base, targeting.</p>
<p>And so if, just for an example,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a building here and I want that building</p>
<p>to go away, that&rsquo;s the message I wanna communicate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna tell certain vehicles</p>
<p>to be in a certain spot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna know how much fuel they have.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even wanna know</p>
<p>what capabilities they have necessarily.</p>
<p>I just wanna know that I have the ability</p>
<p>to select from a cloud of capabilities</p>
<p>and the right assets are gonna arrive</p>
<p>such that they deal with the contingencies</p>
<p>around the target such as protection systems or EW</p>
<p>and then can prosecute the target</p>
<p>to the high enough probability of satisfaction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s needed by the mission commander.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the power of the human mind</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s able to do some of these strategic calculations</p>
<p>but also ethical calculations, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what humans are good at.</p>
<p>Does it worry you a future where we have increasingly</p>
<p>higher autonomy in our weapons systems, in our war?</p>
<p>So you said building.</p>
<p>What about telling a set of fully autonomous drones</p>
<p>to get rid of all the terrorists in the city?</p>
<p>So you said multiple buildings, region,</p>
<p>that kind of, so greater and greater autonomy.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a fear, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re viewing it from a we can cover more perspective</p>
<p>which is fair and a lot of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t approach it from that topic.</p>
<p>At least I don&rsquo;t think of it that way, at least morally.</p>
<p>I think that with the advancement of warfare,</p>
<p>assuming we have a just and moral leadership,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the case, then I am an advocate</p>
<p>for increased autonomy and technology</p>
<p>because I see it as an ability to be more precise.</p>
<p>And if we trust the moral leadership of our government,</p>
<p>then we would want to be as precise as possible</p>
<p>in order to mitigate effects that we don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>So I know that&rsquo;s not a satisfying answer</p>
<p>and it leaves us maybe with bad feelings but.</p>
<p>No, because having experienced sort of directly seen</p>
<p>what it looks like when deliberately or carelessly</p>
<p>war leads to the death of a large number of civilians</p>
<p>as it does currently in Ukraine,</p>
<p>the value of precision given ethical leadership</p>
<p>becomes apparent.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something distinctly unethical</p>
<p>about the murder of civilians in a time of war.</p>
<p>And I think technology helps lessen that.</p>
<p>Of course, all death is terrible</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about schools, hospitals</p>
<p>being destroyed with everybody inside being killed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s particularly terrible.</p>
<p>It is and you approached it from the angle of</p>
<p>more autonomy enables a wider swath of destruction.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we get back into</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s making the decisions based off of this.</p>
<p>And my hope again would be that we would have the leadership</p>
<p>that would use these things when needed</p>
<p>in the precise way as possible to minimize that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen that firsthand, I&rsquo;ve seen that in country,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen not blue forces but I&rsquo;ve seen truck bombs go off</p>
<p>on school buses, driving around Afghanistan</p>
<p>while escorting convoys and it wasn&rsquo;t easy then</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not any easier now</p>
<p>especially after what you&rsquo;ve just seen.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts about the current war in Ukraine</p>
<p>maybe from a military perspective,</p>
<p>maybe from the Air Force perspective?</p>
<p>So I can just mention a few things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Barakhtar drones that are being used.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re unmanned.</p>
<p>I think they have capability to be autonomous</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re usually remotely controlled.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used for reconnaissance but they&rsquo;re also used</p>
<p>by the Ukraine side for reconnaissance</p>
<p>and I think also to destroy different technologies,</p>
<p>tanks and so on, different targets like this.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also on the Russian side the Orlan 10.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the fighter jets, MiG 29 on the Ukraine side</p>
<p>and the Su 25 on the Russian side.</p>
<p>Is there anything kind of stands out to you</p>
<p>about this particular aspects of what this war looks like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unique to what you&rsquo;ve experienced?</p>
<p>Maybe not unique but it&rsquo;s just been absolutely incredible</p>
<p>to see the footage.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re watching war on Twitter essentially</p>
<p>and to see these aircraft flying down low,</p>
<p>spitting flares out, getting shot down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible to see this happening live</p>
<p>for everyone to see.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just kind of a quick meta comment</p>
<p>but as far as the actual,</p>
<p>I think these small form factor UAVs</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re just like strapping weapon to it</p>
<p>and flying over and trying to drop it at the right time</p>
<p>or any of these type of commercial applications</p>
<p>of technology into this ad hoc warfare area</p>
<p>is incredibly interesting</p>
<p>because it shows how useful that technology can be</p>
<p>outside of the military.</p>
<p>Especially like DJI, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s obviously a lot of technology in there</p>
<p>is being leveraged for other capabilities</p>
<p>within PLC military or at least we would assume.</p>
<p>What happens if that is more widespread, right?</p>
<p>Like what if we were creating our own drones</p>
<p>and they were being used against us?</p>
<p>Would we want to have some type of kill switch</p>
<p>or something like that, right?</p>
<p>So what I think governments are gonna have to consider</p>
<p>like all these tools that are gonna be easily available</p>
<p>to just any person could be turned into a tool of war</p>
<p>or how do we stop that from being turned against us?</p>
<p>Especially as we look at 10 years from now</p>
<p>when we have a large number of autonomous UAVs</p>
<p>delivering packages and doing everything else</p>
<p>over our country and any one of those</p>
<p>could be potentially a weapon</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t have the proper security.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re now in Texas and Texas values its guns</p>
<p>and it sees guns as among other things</p>
<p>a protector of individual freedom.</p>
<p>You could see a future perhaps where,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve certainly have experienced this in</p>
<p>the empowering nature of this in Ukraine</p>
<p>where you can put the fight for independence</p>
<p>into your own hands by literally strapping explosives</p>
<p>to GGI drones that you purchase on your own salary.</p>
<p>I mean that one of the interesting things</p>
<p>about the voluntary army in Ukraine</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re basically using their own salary</p>
<p>to buy the ammunition to fight for their independence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the very kind of ideal that sort of people speak about</p>
<p>when they speak about the Second Amendment in this country</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s interesting to see</p>
<p>the advanced technology version of that,</p>
<p>especially in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Sort of using computer vision technology</p>
<p>for surveillance and reconnaissance</p>
<p>to try to integrate that information</p>
<p>to discover the targets and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>To put that in the hands of civilians</p>
<p>is fascinating to see.</p>
<p>So to sort of fight for their independence,</p>
<p>you could say that to fight against authoritarian regime</p>
<p>of your own government, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It shows you how complicated the war space in the future</p>
<p>is gonna be invading a land like that</p>
<p>where people have that many different types of resources.</p>
<p>It could absolutely change warfare.</p>
<p>I mean hopefully that creates a disincentive to start war.</p>
<p>To go to war with a, yeah,</p>
<p>sort of it changes the nature of guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>It does, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Putin was expecting to be in that engagement</p>
<p>quite as long as he has, of course,</p>
<p>but it can show you how you can get caught up.</p>
<p>If land wars turn into an inescapable quagmire each time</p>
<p>due to the complications around the society&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to access interesting tools,</p>
<p>it could be a huge demotivator for aggression.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about this.</p>
<p>Do you think there will always be war in the world?</p>
<p>Is this just a part of human nature?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>Until we move past resource limitation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always gonna be at least</p>
<p>that one particular cause of conflict.</p>
<p>And then we can also consider all our psychological</p>
<p>lizard brain emotions that cause us to act out,</p>
<p>although hopefully we have enough things in place</p>
<p>to stop that from rising to the level of war.</p>
<p>But we have our own biology, our own psychology</p>
<p>and evolution to combat.</p>
<p>But there are pragmatic reasons</p>
<p>to exert violence sometimes, unfortunately,</p>
<p>and one of those cases could be resource limitations.</p>
<p>And so your question was,</p>
<p>do I think there will always be war in this world?</p>
<p>My unfortunate answer is perhaps yes,</p>
<p>but once there&rsquo;s more than one world</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re less resource constrained,</p>
<p>then perhaps there&rsquo;ll be a valve of sorts for that.</p>
<p>I talked to Jacco on this podcast.</p>
<p>I told him about a song called Brothers in Arms</p>
<p>by Dire Straits, and the question I asked him,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask you the same question,</p>
<p>is like the song goes, do you think we&rsquo;re fools</p>
<p>to wage war on our brothers in arms?</p>
<p>And Jacco said, our enemy is not our brothers in arms,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the enemy.</p>
<p>And so this kind of notion that we&rsquo;re all human,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a notion, that&rsquo;s a luxury you can have,</p>
<p>but there is good and bad in this world, according to Jacco.</p>
<p>I hear that anger and hate when I was in Ukraine</p>
<p>amongst some people, where there was a sense</p>
<p>where you could be brothers and sisters,</p>
<p>you can have family, you can have love</p>
<p>from Ukraine to Russia, but now that everything&rsquo;s changed</p>
<p>and generational hate for some people have taken over.</p>
<p>So I guess the question is, when you think about the enemy,</p>
<p>is there hate there?</p>
<p>Do you acknowledge that they&rsquo;re human?</p>
<p>I had never had any hate or discontent</p>
<p>when I was doing my job, I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>but I was also never in a true life or death situation</p>
<p>where they were gonna kill me if I didn&rsquo;t kill them.</p>
<p>But I think that environment isn&rsquo;t one born out of hate,</p>
<p>being in that type of scenario,</p>
<p>in a sense it&rsquo;s how to be alive, right?</p>
<p>I mean, our natural state is to be fighting</p>
<p>for our survival in a sense.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s great power and strength</p>
<p>and clarity perhaps in that, and it&rsquo;s not always born out</p>
<p>of hate, but out of necessity,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t always control that.</p>
<p>And I think as we focus on ourselves so much,</p>
<p>we only dance on that pinhead when we find ourselves</p>
<p>fighting for things that we need,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re always taking from someone else at this point.</p>
<p>And so as someone that&rsquo;s been in combat</p>
<p>and very high above it, I&rsquo;ll say, right,</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was in particular danger,</p>
<p>I rationalized it and I made my way through it,</p>
<p>knowing that there were people on the other side</p>
<p>that were going to die that were on our side than not.</p>
<p>So it was always a very human thing.</p>
<p>It was never a reaction, emotional reaction of any sense.</p>
<p>So you were able to see the basic, it&rsquo;s human versus human.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect of war that is basically</p>
<p>one people fighting each other.</p>
<p>Yes, at the end of the day, especially I would say</p>
<p>in aviation, tactical aviation, there&rsquo;s almost a kinship</p>
<p>with your enemies in a sense, because you know them</p>
<p>in a sense, right, you know what they&rsquo;ve been through,</p>
<p>you know what training they&rsquo;ve been through,</p>
<p>you know where they failed, and you know what type</p>
<p>of person they are, because it&rsquo;s a very unique person</p>
<p>that does that job and usually can spot them.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s the kind of respect you have</p>
<p>for the craftsmanship of the job that&rsquo;s taken on.</p>
<p>Certainly, and that person didn&rsquo;t come out</p>
<p>in his $100 million jet because I pissed him off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an emotional response.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both there, maybe because we chose to be in some sense,</p>
<p>but at the behest of someone else</p>
<p>and outside of our control and power.</p>
<p>And so in a sense for me, it&rsquo;s almost a challenge</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve engaged upon agreeably,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s such a romantic version that I have the luxury</p>
<p>to have being high in my castle in the jet up there,</p>
<p>not on the ground.</p>
<p>So I understand that it&rsquo;s a bit more romantic</p>
<p>than perhaps, you know, someone on the ground</p>
<p>experiencing all the horrors down there,</p>
<p>because everything looks very small from above.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another aspect of war with greater autonomy</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re controlling the mission versus,</p>
<p>you know, have a Genghis Khan type of intimacy</p>
<p>in terms of the actual experience of war</p>
<p>where you directly have, you murder with a sword</p>
<p>versus a gun versus a remotely controlled drone</p>
<p>versus a strategic mission assignment</p>
<p>to an autonomous drone that executes.</p>
<p>Abstracted away until it&rsquo;s just a small decision.</p>
<p>And my worry is the people without a voice</p>
<p>are completely forgotten and silenced</p>
<p>in all of these calculations.</p>
<p>I spoke to a lot of people, poor people that feel like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve never really had a voice</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re too easily forgotten,</p>
<p>even within the country of Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the big city versus the rural divide, you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to forget the people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have a Twitter account</p>
<p>and that their basic existence is just trying to survive,</p>
<p>trying to put food on the table</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have anything else, anything else.</p>
<p>And they are the ones that truly feel the pain of war,</p>
<p>of the supply chain going down,</p>
<p>of the food supplies going down,</p>
<p>of a cold winter without power.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still young, but you&rsquo;ve seen some things.</p>
<p>So let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat</p>
<p>and give advice to young people,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re fascinated by technology</p>
<p>or fascinated by fighter jets,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re fascinated by sort of engineering</p>
<p>or the way the stars look at night.</p>
<p>What advice would you give them?</p>
<p>How to have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or how to have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest that they don&rsquo;t fear looking foolish.</p>
<p>I spent a large portion of my life</p>
<p>considering the laughter or the comments</p>
<p>at my statements as indication</p>
<p>that I shouldn&rsquo;t pursue that.</p>
<p>And so I kind of woke up to that fact a bit later,</p>
<p>but I would advise that people trust in themselves</p>
<p>and trust in the things that they care about.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they&rsquo;re good at it.</p>
<p>All that matters is that they find something</p>
<p>that they can apply love and care to</p>
<p>and they will grow better at it</p>
<p>and then most likely make the world better because of it.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t be afraid to look stupid.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to look stupid.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the things that I think</p>
<p>as you get older, you&rsquo;re expected to be,</p>
<p>to have it all figured out</p>
<p>and so you are afraid to take on new things.</p>
<p>But I think as long as you&rsquo;re always,</p>
<p>okay, looking stupid and having a beginner&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>you can get really, really far even later on in life.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t just advice for young people.</p>
<p>This is really advice for everybody.</p>
<p>Maybe a dark question,</p>
<p>but has there been a difficult time in your life,</p>
<p>a really dark place you&rsquo;ve gone in your mind</p>
<p>that stands out that you had to really overcome?</p>
<p>I would suggest that I&rsquo;ve been pretty firm ground</p>
<p>for most of my life.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had too many personal tragedies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say that have really defined me.</p>
<p>Certainly none that I would think are outside the norm.</p>
<p>So there was no truly low point.</p>
<p>Actually, I have one and it&rsquo;s tough for me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life beating motions</p>
<p>and high emotional responses out of my system</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what flying is, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s keeping a steady line and doing what you need to do.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s been studies</p>
<p>that show reduced adrenaline production in fighter pilots</p>
<p>for a number of years after they get out.</p>
<p>But getting out of the Navy was difficult for me.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to be.</p>
<p>A lot of bravado and machoism, of course, in the military,</p>
<p>especially in fighter community.</p>
<p>And we all have our plans made up to get out</p>
<p>and none of it really accounts</p>
<p>for any type of mental health or anything like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very much, where am I gonna get my paycheck from?</p>
<p>Where am I gonna move to?</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s the Navy or just individuals,</p>
<p>truly understanding the difference that makes.</p>
<p>And when I got out, it was difficult for me.</p>
<p>I think a lot of guys in that job, when they get out,</p>
<p>they almost, at least I had anxiety when I got out</p>
<p>because I was so used to being highly involved</p>
<p>in something that just was I was always involved with</p>
<p>that when I got out,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know how to fill that space essentially.</p>
<p>And while I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was an overly</p>
<p>traumatic experience, I think it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not accounted for enough</p>
<p>that people that are getting out,</p>
<p>so I would encourage them to take it serious</p>
<p>and actually think about it and respect the change</p>
<p>because it is a big one.</p>
<p>Well, if I may say, you found a place in nature currently,</p>
<p>a home, is there, can you speak to that</p>
<p>being a source of happiness for you?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>An escape from the world?</p>
<p>Certainly, it very much is.</p>
<p>Was it deliberate that you found it there?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s home for me.</p>
<p>So, I moved back up to the Boston area</p>
<p>and my wife and I had an idea after moving</p>
<p>about eight or nine times in the Navy</p>
<p>of kind of what we wanted just generally.</p>
<p>And it was all really about the land</p>
<p>and not about the house,</p>
<p>we just wanted privacy and to be nearby.</p>
<p>And so we ended up finding a lot of land,</p>
<p>a parcel of land, we put a house on it</p>
<p>and it provides me with a sense of peace</p>
<p>that I think I can only get when I&rsquo;m in nature.</p>
<p>And a sense of clarity that helps me think,</p>
<p>helps me relax, maybe it&rsquo;s so relaxing</p>
<p>that helps me think, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But being surrounded by nature and birds and animals</p>
<p>for me has always allowed me to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, feel most in touch</p>
<p>with my own thoughts in a sense.</p>
<p>It just provides clarity.</p>
<p>And so this little sanctuary you could say I&rsquo;ve built</p>
<p>allows me to interface via a fiber line at my house</p>
<p>but also feel like I&rsquo;m a million miles away sometimes,</p>
<p>which is the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>A, you can just walk outside to escape at all.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>To experience life as hundreds of generations</p>
<p>of human species have experienced it.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the dichotomy, my desire for the fastness</p>
<p>of technology and experience compared</p>
<p>with the most basic baseline that we have.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that strange?</p>
<p>How do you square that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>How drawn you are to the cutting edge</p>
<p>and still the calm you find in nature.</p>
<p>I think it makes sense.</p>
<p>Nature is vastly superior to almost all of our technology.</p>
<p>From a technology perspective?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>And so in a way, it&rsquo;s being surrounded</p>
<p>by perfection in a lot of senses.</p>
<p>In the military and in general,</p>
<p>have you contemplated your mortality?</p>
<p>Have you been afraid of death?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your relationship like with death?</p>
<p>Well, I was willing to accept an oversized amount of risk,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, when I was younger as an aviator.</p>
<p>Not in the jet, but just that was my life.</p>
<p>I felt like I was gonna live forever.</p>
<p>And going out in the war, strangely,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really change that because as an aviator,</p>
<p>again, we&rsquo;re riding up high on our horse up there.</p>
<p>So there were times when I was in situations</p>
<p>that could have resulted in death from flying</p>
<p>or from emergency in the aircraft.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll be honest, I never really kind of sat down</p>
<p>to think about the mortality of it afterwards.</p>
<p>I feel like I kind of signed a check at the beginning</p>
<p>and it was my job to perform as well as I could.</p>
<p>And if something happened in that,</p>
<p>then I better damn well be sure</p>
<p>I would do my best at the time then.</p>
<p>So I maybe didn&rsquo;t personally reflect on it</p>
<p>as much as I one would think,</p>
<p>because once you get in that machine,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t give you a lot of time</p>
<p>to sit back and philosophize on your current situation.</p>
<p>And the same, just like we weren&rsquo;t seeing these,</p>
<p>or when we seen these objects off the coast,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t necessarily examining them every day, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d put them into that bucket</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t something</p>
<p>that was gonna kill us right away.</p>
<p>And thinking about death when you&rsquo;re so close to it</p>
<p>all the time would be debilitating.</p>
<p>It would probably make you worse at your job.</p>
<p>It would.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you can think about death</p>
<p>when you look out, when you go out into nature</p>
<p>and think like the fact that this whole ride ends,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a weird thing.</p>
<p>And the old makes way to new.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all throughout nature.</p>
<p>And if you just look at the cruelty of nature</p>
<p>or the beauty of nature, however you think about it,</p>
<p>the fact that the big thing eats the little thing</p>
<p>over and over, and that&rsquo;s just how it progresses.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how adaptation happens.</p>
<p>Death is a requirement for evolution.</p>
<p>And whether evolution allows us</p>
<p>to see objective reality or not,</p>
<p>it still gives you some interesting thoughts</p>
<p>about perspectives of death,</p>
<p>and especially considering it&rsquo;s a biological necessity</p>
<p>as far as evolution is concerned.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird that there&rsquo;s been like 100 billion people</p>
<p>that lived before us,</p>
<p>and that you and I will be forgotten.</p>
<p>This whole thing we&rsquo;re doing now is meaningless</p>
<p>in that sense, but at the same time,</p>
<p>it feels deeply meaningful somehow.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the question I wanna ask.</p>
<p>When you go out to nature with family,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Or maybe when you put on the night goggles,</p>
<p>the night vision goggles and look up at the stars,</p>
<p>why are we here?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for everyone,</p>
<p>but at least the way I interpret it,</p>
<p>or at least I feel like I interpret my way here,</p>
<p>my job is, I feel like my role is just to be curious</p>
<p>about the environment in a manner that allows us</p>
<p>to understand as much as possible.</p>
<p>I think that the human mind,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s just the mass inside our skull,</p>
<p>or whether there&rsquo;s some type of quantum interactions</p>
<p>going on, our mind has incredible ability</p>
<p>to output new information in a universe</p>
<p>that is somewhat stale of information, right?</p>
<p>Our minds are somewhat unique in that we can imagine</p>
<p>and perceive things that could never ever</p>
<p>have possibly naturally occurred,</p>
<p>and yet we can make it happen.</p>
<p>We can instantiate that with enough belief</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s true and it can happen.</p>
<p>And so for me, I feel like I just need to encourage that,</p>
<p>to encourage interaction with reality</p>
<p>such that it leaves us a newer and grander interactions</p>
<p>with this universe.</p>
<p>And all that starts with a little bit of curiosity.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Ryan, you&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done so many things,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so much still ahead of you.</p>
<p>Thank you for being brave enough to talk about UFOs</p>
<p>and doing it so seriously,</p>
<p>and thank you for pushing forward</p>
<p>on all these fronts in terms of technology.</p>
<p>So from just the fighter jets, the engineering of that,</p>
<p>to the AIML applications in the combat setting,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super interesting, and then now quantum.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do next.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for sitting down and talking today.</p>
<p>It was an honor.</p>
<p>It was my pleasure.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Lieutenant Ryan Graves.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Buzz Aldrin.</p>
<p>Bravery comes along as a gradual accumulation of discipline.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
