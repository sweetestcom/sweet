    <p>The following is a conversation with Barry Barish, a theoretical physicist at Caltech</p>
<p>and the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the LIGO detector</p>
<p>and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO, or the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave</p>
<p>Observatory, is probably the most precise measurement device ever built by humans.</p>
<p>It consists of two detectors with four kilometer long vacuum chambers situated three thousand</p>
<p>kilometers apart, operating in unison to measure a motion that is ten thousand times smaller than</p>
<p>the width of a proton. It is the smallest measurement ever attempted by science,</p>
<p>a measurement of gravitational waves caused by the most violent and cataclysmic events</p>
<p>in the universe, occurring over tens of millions of light years away.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here is my conversation with Barry Barish.</p>
<p>Yeah, that memory is kind of something I use to illustrate something I think is common in science,</p>
<p>that people that do science somehow have maintained something that kids always have.</p>
<p>A small kid, eight years old or so, asks you so many questions usually, typically, that you</p>
<p>consider them pests. You tell them to stop asking so many questions. And somehow our system manages</p>
<p>to kill that in most people. So in school, we make people study and do their things,</p>
<p>but not to pester them by asking too many questions. And I think, not just myself,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s typical of scientists like myself that have somehow escaped that. Maybe</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still children or maybe we somehow didn&rsquo;t get it beaten out of us. But I teach it in college</p>
<p>level and it&rsquo;s, to me, one of the biggest deficits is the lack of curiosity, if you want,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve beaten out of them because I think it&rsquo;s an innate human quality.</p>
<p>Is there some advice or insights you can give to how to keep that flame of curiosity going?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a problem of both parents and that parents should realize that&rsquo;s a great quality we</p>
<p>have. That you&rsquo;re curious and that&rsquo;s good. Instead, we have expressions like curiosity</p>
<p>killed the cat and more. But basically, it&rsquo;s not thought to be a good thing. Curiosity</p>
<p>killed the cat means if you&rsquo;re too curious, you get in trouble.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like cats anyway, so maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Yeah. That, to me, needs to be solved, really, in education and in homes. It&rsquo;s a realization</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s certain human qualities that we should try to build on and not destroy. One of</p>
<p>them is curiosity. Anyway, back to me and curiosity. I was a pest and asked a lot of</p>
<p>questions. My father generally could answer them at that age. And the first one I remember that he</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t answer was not a very original question, but basically that ice is made out of water,</p>
<p>and so why does it float on water? He couldn&rsquo;t answer it. It may not have been the first</p>
<p>question. It&rsquo;s the first one that I remember. And that was the first time that I realized that</p>
<p>to learn and answer your own curiosity or questions, there&rsquo;s various mechanisms. In</p>
<p>this case, it was going to the library or asking people who know more and so forth. But</p>
<p>eventually, you do it by what we call research. But it&rsquo;s driven by, hopefully, you ask good</p>
<p>questions. If you ask good questions and you have the mechanism to solve them, then you do what I</p>
<p>do in life, basically, not necessarily physics. And it&rsquo;s a great quality in humans, and we should</p>
<p>nurture it. Do you remember any other kind of in high school, maybe early college, more basic</p>
<p>physics ideas that sparked your curiosity or mathematics or science in general?</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really into science until I got to college, to be honest with you. But</p>
<p>just staying with water for a minute, I remember that I was curious what happens to water. It rains</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s water in a wet pavement, and then the pavement dries out. What happened to this</p>
<p>water that came down? And I didn&rsquo;t know that much. And then eventually, I learned in chemistry or</p>
<p>something, water is made out of hydrogen and oxygen. Those are both gases. So how the heck</p>
<p>does it make this substance? It&rsquo;s liquid. Yeah, so that has to do with states of matter.</p>
<p>I know perhaps LIGO and the thing for which you&rsquo;ve gotten the Nobel Prize and the things</p>
<p>much of your life work perhaps was a happy accident in some sense in the early days. But</p>
<p>is there a moment where you looked up to the stars and also, the same way you wondered about water,</p>
<p>wondered about some of the things that are out there in the universe?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I think everybody looks and is in awe and is curious about what it is out there. And</p>
<p>as I learned more, I learned, of course, that we don&rsquo;t know very much about what&rsquo;s there. And the</p>
<p>more we learn, the more we know we don&rsquo;t know. I mean, we don&rsquo;t know what the majority of anything</p>
<p>is out there. It&rsquo;s all what we call dark matter and dark energy. And that&rsquo;s one of the big</p>
<p>questions. When I was a student, those weren&rsquo;t questions. So we even know less, in a sense,</p>
<p>the more we look. So of course, I think that&rsquo;s one of the areas that almost it&rsquo;s universal.</p>
<p>People see the sky, they see the stars and they&rsquo;re beautiful and see it looks different</p>
<p>on different nights. And it&rsquo;s a curiosity that we all have.</p>
<p>What are some questions about the universe that in the same way that you felt about the ice</p>
<p>that today? You mentioned to me offline, you&rsquo;re teaching a course on the frontiers of science,</p>
<p>frontiers of physics. What are some questions outside the ones we&rsquo;ll probably talk about that</p>
<p>kind of, yeah, fill you with the, get your flame of curiosity up and firing up, you know,</p>
<p>fill you with awe? Well, first, I&rsquo;m a physicist, not an astronomer. So I&rsquo;m interested in the</p>
<p>physical phenomenon, really. So the question of dark matter and dark energy, which we probably</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t talk about, our recent last 20, 30 years, certainly dark energy. Dark energy is a complete</p>
<p>puzzle. It goes against what you will ask me about, which is general relativity and Einstein&rsquo;s</p>
<p>general relativity. It basically takes something that he thought was what he called a constant,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t. And if that&rsquo;s even the right theory, and it represents most of the universe. And then</p>
<p>we have something called dark matter, and there&rsquo;s good reason to believe it might be an exotic form</p>
<p>of particles. And that is something I&rsquo;ve always worked on, on particle accelerators and so forth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a big puzzle, what it is. It&rsquo;s a bit of a cottage industry in that there&rsquo;s lots and lots</p>
<p>of searches, but it may be a little bit like, you know, looking for a treasure under rocks or</p>
<p>something. You don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s hard to, we don&rsquo;t have really good guidance, except that we have very,</p>
<p>very good information that is pervasive and it&rsquo;s there. And that it&rsquo;s probably particles, small,</p>
<p>that the evidence is all of those things. But then the most logical solution doesn&rsquo;t seem to work,</p>
<p>something called supersymmetry. And do you think the answer could be something very complicated?</p>
<p>You know, I like to hope that, think that most things that appear complicated are actually</p>
<p>simple if you really understand them. I think we just don&rsquo;t know at the present time, and it isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>something that affects us. It does affect, it affects how the stars go around each other and so</p>
<p>forth, because we detect that there&rsquo;s missing gravity, but it doesn&rsquo;t affect everyday life at</p>
<p>all. I tend to think and expect maybe, and that the answers will be simple. We just haven&rsquo;t found</p>
<p>it yet. Do you think those answers might change the way we see other sources of gravity, black holes,</p>
<p>the way we see the parts of the universe that we do study? It&rsquo;s conceivable. The black holes that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve found in our experiment, we&rsquo;re trying now to understand the origin of those. It&rsquo;s conceivable,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t seem the most likely that they were primordial, that is, they were made at the</p>
<p>beginning. And in that sense, they could represent at least part of the dark matter.</p>
<p>So there can be connections, dark black holes or how many there are, how much of the mass they</p>
<p>encompass is still pretty primitive. We don&rsquo;t know. So before I talk to you more about black holes,</p>
<p>let me take a step back to, I actually went to high school in Chicago and would go to</p>
<p>take classes at Fermilab, watch the buffalo and so on. So let me ask about, you mentioned that Enrico</p>
<p>for me was somebody who was inspiring to you in a certain kind of way. Why is that? Can you speak</p>
<p>to that? Sure. He was amazing, actually. He&rsquo;s the last, I&rsquo;ll come to the reason in a minute, but</p>
<p>he had a big influence on me at a young age. But he was the last physicist of note that was both</p>
<p>an experimental physicist and a theorist at the same time. And he did two amazing things within</p>
<p>months in 1933. We didn&rsquo;t really know what the nucleus was, what radioactive decay was,</p>
<p>what beta decay was when electrons come out of a nucleus. And near the end of 1933, the neutron had</p>
<p>just been discovered. And that meant that we knew a little bit more about what the nucleus is, that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made out of neutrons and protons. The neutron wasn&rsquo;t discovered till 1932. And then once we</p>
<p>discovered that there was a neutron and proton and they made the nucleus and then their electrons</p>
<p>that go around, the basic ingredients were there. And he wrote down not only just the theory,</p>
<p>a theory, but a theory that lasted decades and has only been improved on of beta decay, that is,</p>
<p>the radiation. He did this, came out of nowhere, and it was a fantastic theory. He submitted it</p>
<p>to Nature magazine, which was the primary best place to publish even then. And it got rejected</p>
<p>as being too speculative. And so he went back to his drawing board in Rome where he was,</p>
<p>added some to it, made it even longer, because it&rsquo;s really a classic article, and then published</p>
<p>it in the local Italian journal for physics and the German one. At the same time, in January of</p>
<p>1932, Giulio and Curie, for the first time, saw artificial radioactivity. This was an important</p>
<p>discovery because radioactivity had been discovered much earlier. They had x rays and you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be using them, but there was radioactivity. People knew it was useful for medicine.</p>
<p>But radioactive materials are hard to find, and so it wasn&rsquo;t prevalent. But if you could make them,</p>
<p>they had great use. And Giulio and Curie were able to bombard aluminum or something with alpha</p>
<p>particles and find that they excited something that decayed and had some half life and so forth,</p>
<p>meaning it was artificial version, or let&rsquo;s call it not a natural version, an induced version of</p>
<p>radioactive materials. And Fermi somehow had the insight, and I still can&rsquo;t see where he got it,</p>
<p>that the right way to follow that up was not using charged particles like alphas and so forth,</p>
<p>but use these newly discovered neutrons as the bombarding particle. It seemed impossible</p>
<p>they barely had been seen. It was hard to get very many of them. But it had the advantage that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not charged, so they go right into the nucleus. And that turned out to be the experimental</p>
<p>work that he did that won him the Nobel Prize. And it was the first step in fission, discovery</p>
<p>of fission. And he did this two completely different things, an experiment that was a great</p>
<p>idea and a tremendous implementation, because how do you get enough neutrons? And then he learned</p>
<p>quickly that not only do you want neutrons, but you want really slow ones. He learned that</p>
<p>experimentally, and he learned how to make slow ones, and then they were able to go through the</p>
<p>go through the periodic table and make lots of particles. He missed on fission at the moment,</p>
<p>but he had the basic information, and then fission follows soon after that.</p>
<p>Forgive me for not knowing, but is the birth of the idea of bombarding with neutrons,</p>
<p>is that an experimental idea? Was it born out of an experiment? Did he just observe something,</p>
<p>or is this an Einstein style idea where you come up from basic intuition?</p>
<p>I think it took a combination, because he realized that neutrons had a characteristic</p>
<p>that would allow them to go all the way into the nucleus when we didn&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>what the structure was of all this. So that took an understanding or recognition of the physics</p>
<p>itself of how a neutron interacts compared to, say, an alpha particle that Julio and Curie had</p>
<p>used. And then he had to invent a way to have enough neutrons, and he had a team of associates,</p>
<p>and he pulled it off quite quickly. So it was pretty astounding.</p>
<p>And probably, maybe you can speak to it, his ability to put together the engineering aspects</p>
<p>of great experiments and doing the theory, they probably fed each other. I wonder,</p>
<p>can you speak to why we don&rsquo;t see more of that? Is that just really difficult to do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to do. Yeah, I think in both theory and experiment in physics anyway,</p>
<p>it was conceivable if you had the right person to do it, and no one&rsquo;s been able to do it since. So</p>
<p>I had the dream that that was what I was going to be like, Fermi.</p>
<p>But you love both sides of it, the theory. Yeah, I never liked the idea that you did</p>
<p>experiments without really understanding the theory, or the theory should be related</p>
<p>very closely to experiments. And so I&rsquo;ve always done experimental work that was closely related</p>
<p>to the theoretical ideas. I think I told you I&rsquo;m Russian,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to ask some romantic questions. But is it tragic to you that he&rsquo;s seen as the</p>
<p>architect of the nuclear age, that some of his creations led to potentially, some of his work</p>
<p>has led to potentially still the destruction of the human species, some of the most destructive</p>
<p>weapons? Yeah, I think even more general than him, I gave you all the virtues of curiosity a few</p>
<p>minutes ago. There&rsquo;s an interesting book called The Ratchet of Curiosity. A ratchet is something</p>
<p>that goes in one direction. And that is written by a guy who&rsquo;s probably a sociologist or philosopher</p>
<p>or something. And he picks on this particular problem, but other ones. And that is the danger</p>
<p>of knowledge, basically. You&rsquo;re curious, you learn something. So it&rsquo;s a little bit like</p>
<p>curiosity killed the cat. You have to be worried about whether you can handle new information that</p>
<p>you get. So in this case, the new information had to do with really understanding nuclear physics.</p>
<p>And that information, maybe we didn&rsquo;t have the sophistication to know how to keep it under</p>
<p>control. And Fermi himself was a very apolitical person. So he wasn&rsquo;t very driven by, or at least</p>
<p>he appears in all of his writing, the writing of his wife, the interactions that others had with</p>
<p>him. Either he avoided it all or he was pretty apolitical. I mean, he just saw the world through</p>
<p>kind of the lens of a scientist. But he asked if it&rsquo;s tragic. The bomb was tragic, certainly on</p>
<p>Japan. And he had a role in that. So I wouldn&rsquo;t want it as my legacy, for example. But brought</p>
<p>it to the human species that it&rsquo;s the ratchet of curiosity that we do stuff just to see what</p>
<p>happens. That curiosity, that in sort of my area of artificial intelligence, that&rsquo;s been a concern.</p>
<p>On a small scale, on a silly scale, perhaps currently, there&rsquo;s constantly unintended</p>
<p>consequences. You create a system and you put it out there and you have intuitions about how</p>
<p>it will work. You have hopes how it will work, but you put it out there just to see what happens.</p>
<p>And in most cases, because artificial intelligence is currently not super powerful,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t create a large scale negative effects, but that same curiosity as it progresses might</p>
<p>lead to something that destroys the human species. And the same may be true for bioengineering.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that engineer viruses to protect us from viruses to see how close is this to</p>
<p>mutating so it can jump to humans or engineering defenses against those. And it seems exciting and</p>
<p>the application, the positive applications are really exciting at this time, but we don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about how that runs away in decades to come. Yeah. And I think it&rsquo;s the same idea as this</p>
<p>little book, The Ratchet of Science, The Ratchet of Curiosity. I mean, whether you pursue,</p>
<p>take curiosity and let artificial intelligence or machine learning run away with having its</p>
<p>solutions to whatever you want, or we do it, it&rsquo;s, I think, a similar consequence.</p>
<p>I think from what I&rsquo;ve read about Enrico Fermi, he became a little bit cynical about the human</p>
<p>species towards the end of his life, both having observed what he observed.</p>
<p>Well, he didn&rsquo;t write much. I mean, he died young. He died soon after the World War. There was</p>
<p>already, you know, the work by Teller to develop the hydrogen bomb. And I think he was a little</p>
<p>cynical of that, you know, pushing it even further and rising tensions between the Soviet Union and</p>
<p>the U.S. and looked like an endless thing. So, but he didn&rsquo;t say very much, but a little bit,</p>
<p>as you said. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a few clips to sort of maybe picked on a bad mood, but in a sense that</p>
<p>almost like a sadness, a melancholy sadness to a hope that waned a little bit about that perhaps we</p>
<p>can do, like this curious species can find the way out. Well, especially, I think, people who</p>
<p>worked like he did at Los Alamos and spent years of their life somehow had to convince themselves</p>
<p>that dropping these bombs would bring lasting peace and that it didn&rsquo;t. Yeah. As a small,</p>
<p>interesting aside, it&rsquo;d be interesting to hear if you have opinions on this. His name is also</p>
<p>attached to the Fermi Paradox, which asks if there is a, you know, it&rsquo;s a very interesting question,</p>
<p>which is if it does seem if you sort of reason basically that there should be a lot of alien</p>
<p>civilizations out there. If the human species, if Earth is not that unique by basic, no matter the</p>
<p>values you pick, it&rsquo;s likely that there&rsquo;s a lot of alien civilizations out there. And if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>case, why have they not at least obviously visited us or sent us loud signals that everybody can</p>
<p>hear? Fermi&rsquo;s quoted as saying, sitting down at lunch, I think it was with Teller and Herb York,</p>
<p>who was kind of one of the fathers of the atomic bomb. And he sat down and he said something like,</p>
<p>where are they? Which meant, where are these other? And then he did some numerology where he</p>
<p>calculated, you know, how many, what they knew about how many galaxies there are and how many</p>
<p>stars and how many planets then are like the Earth and blah, blah, blah. That&rsquo;s been done much</p>
<p>better by somebody named Drake. And so, people usually refer to the, I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the Drake formula or something, but it has the same conclusion. The conclusion is it would</p>
<p>be a miracle if there weren&rsquo;t other, you know, the statistics are so high that how can we be</p>
<p>singular and separate? So, probably there is, but there&rsquo;s almost certainly life somewhere. Maybe</p>
<p>there was even life on Mars a while back, but intelligent life, probably. So, you know, the</p>
<p>statistics say that communicating with us, I think that it&rsquo;s harder than people think. We might not</p>
<p>know the right way to expect the communication, but all the communication that we know about</p>
<p>travels at the speed of light. And we don&rsquo;t think anything can go faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>That limits the problem quite a bit. And it makes it difficult to have any back and forth</p>
<p>communication. You could send signals like we try to or look for, but to have any communication,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty hard when it has to be close enough that the speed of light would mean we could</p>
<p>communicate with each other. And I think, and we didn&rsquo;t even understand that. I mean, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>an advanced civilization, but we didn&rsquo;t even understand that a little more than a hundred</p>
<p>years ago. So, are we just not advanced enough? Maybe to know something about that&rsquo;s the speed</p>
<p>of light. Maybe there&rsquo;s some other way to communicate that isn&rsquo;t based on electromagnetism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Gravity seems to be also have the same speed. That was a principle that Einstein</p>
<p>had and something we&rsquo;ve measured actually. So is it possible? I mean, so we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>gravitational waves and in some sense, there&rsquo;s a brainstorming going on, which is like,</p>
<p>how do we detect the signal? Like what would a signal look like and how would we detect it? And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true for gravitational waves. That&rsquo;s true for basically any physics phenomena. You have to</p>
<p>predict that that signal should exist. You have to have some kind of theory and model why that signal</p>
<p>should exist. I mean, is it possible that aliens are communicating with us via gravity? Like why</p>
<p>not? Well, yeah, it&rsquo;s true. Why not? For us, it&rsquo;s very hard to detect these gravitational effects.</p>
<p>They have to come from something pretty that has a lot of gravity like black holes, but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pretty primitive at this stage. There&rsquo;s very reputable physicists that look for a fifth force,</p>
<p>one that we haven&rsquo;t found yet. Maybe it&rsquo;s the key. What would a fifth force of physics look</p>
<p>like exactly? Well, usually they think it&rsquo;s probably a longer range force than we have now.</p>
<p>But there are reputable colleagues of mine that spend their life looking for a fifth force.</p>
<p>So longer range than gravity? Yeah. Super long? It doesn&rsquo;t fall off like one over r squared,</p>
<p>but maybe separately. Gravity, Newton taught us, goes like inversely one over the square of the</p>
<p>distance apart you are. So it falls pretty fast. That&rsquo;s okay. So now we have a theory of what</p>
<p>consciousness is. It&rsquo;s just the fifth force of physics. Yeah. There we go. That&rsquo;s a good hypothesis.</p>
<p>Speaking of gravity, what are gravitational waves? Let&rsquo;s maybe start from the basics.</p>
<p>We learned gravity from Newton, right? When you were young, you were told that if you jumped up,</p>
<p>the earth pulls you down. And when the apple falls out of the tree, the earth pulls it down.</p>
<p>And maybe you even asked your teacher why, but most of us accepted that. That was Newton&rsquo;s</p>
<p>picture, the apple falling out of the tree. But Newton&rsquo;s theory never told you why the apple</p>
<p>was attracted to the earth. That was a missing in Newton&rsquo;s theory. Newton&rsquo;s theory also</p>
<p>Newton recognized at least one of the two problems. I&rsquo;ll tell you one of them is there&rsquo;s more than</p>
<p>those, but one is why does the earth, what&rsquo;s the mechanism by which the earth pulls the apple or</p>
<p>holds the moon when it goes around, whatever it is. That&rsquo;s not explained by Newton, even though he</p>
<p>has the most successful theory of physics ever went 200 and some years with nobody ever seeing</p>
<p>a violation. But he accurately describes the movement of an object falling down to earth,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not answering why that what&rsquo;s yeah, because it&rsquo;s a distance. He gives a formula,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s a product of the earth&rsquo;s mass, the apple&rsquo;s mass inversely proportional to the square</p>
<p>of the distance between and then the strength he called capital G, the strength he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>determine, but it was determined 100 years later. But no one ever saw a violation of this until a</p>
<p>possible violation, which Einstein fixed, which was very small that has to do with</p>
<p>mercury going around the sun, the orbit being slightly wrong if you calculate it by Newton&rsquo;s</p>
<p>theory. But so like most theories then in physics, you can have a wonderful one like Newton&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t wrong. But you have to have an improvement on it to answer things that it can&rsquo;t answer. And</p>
<p>in this case, Einstein&rsquo;s theory is the next step. We don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s anything like a final theory</p>
<p>or even the only way to formulate it either. But he formulated this theory, which he released in 1915.</p>
<p>He took 10 years to develop it, even though in 1905, he solved three or four of the most important</p>
<p>problems in physics in a matter of months. And then he spent 10 years on this problem before he</p>
<p>let it out. And this is called general relativity. It&rsquo;s a new theory of gravity.</p>
<ol start="1915">
<li>In 1916, Einstein wrote a little paper where he did not do some fancy derivation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, he did what I would call he used his intuition, which he was very good at too. And that</p>
<p>is he noticed that if he wrote the formulas for general relativity in a particular way,</p>
<p>they looked a lot like the formulas for electricity and magnetism.</p>
<p>Being Einstein, he then took the leap that electricity and magnetism, we discovered only</p>
<p>20 years before that in the 1880s, have waves. Of course, that&rsquo;s light and electromagnetic waves,</p>
<p>radio waves, everything else. So he said, if the formulas look similar, then gravity probably has</p>
<p>waves too. That&rsquo;s such a big leap, by the way. I mean, maybe you could go back to the 1880s,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me, but that just seems like a heck of a leap.</p>
<p>Yeah. And it was considered to be a heck of a leap. So first that paper was, except for this</p>
<p>intuition, was poorly written, had a serious mistake. It had a factor of two wrong in the</p>
<p>strength of gravity, which meant if we use those formulas, we would&hellip; And two years later,</p>
<p>he wrote a second paper. And in that paper, it turns out to be important for us because in that</p>
<p>paper, he not only fixed his factor of two mistake, which he never admitted, he just wrote it,</p>
<p>fixed it like he always did. And then he told us how you make gravitational waves, what makes</p>
<p>gravitational waves. And you might recall in electromagnetism, we make electromagnetic waves</p>
<p>in a simple way. You take a plus charge and minus charge, you oscillate like this, and that makes</p>
<p>the electromagnetic waves. And a physicist named Hertz made a receiver that could detect the waves</p>
<p>and put it in the next room. He saw them and moved forward and backward and saw that it was wave like.</p>
<p>So Einstein said, it won&rsquo;t be a dipole like that, it&rsquo;ll be a four pole thing. And that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called, it&rsquo;s called a quadrupole moment that gives the gravitational wave. So that again, by insight,</p>
<p>not by derivation. That set the table for what you needed to do to do it. At the same time,</p>
<p>in the same year, Schwarzschild, not Einstein, said there were things called black holes. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting that that came the same. So what year was that? 1915. It was in parallel&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I should probably know this, but did Einstein not have an intuition that there</p>
<p>should be such things as black holes? That came from Schwarzschild. Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah. So Schwarzschild, who was a German theoretical physicist, he got killed in the war,</p>
<p>I think, in the First World War, two years later or so. He&rsquo;s the one that proposed black holes,</p>
<p>that there were black holes. That feels like a natural conclusion of general relativity, no? Or</p>
<p>is that not? Well, it may seem like it, but I don&rsquo;t know about a natural conclusion. It&rsquo;s a result</p>
<p>of curved space time though. Right. But it&rsquo;s such a weird result that you might have to&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a special&hellip; Yeah, it&rsquo;s a special case. Yeah. So I don&rsquo;t know. Anyway, Einstein then,</p>
<p>an interesting part of the story is that Einstein then left the problem. Most physicists,</p>
<p>because it really wasn&rsquo;t derived, he just made this, didn&rsquo;t pick up on it or general relativity</p>
<p>much because quantum mechanics became the thing in physics. And Einstein only picked up this</p>
<p>problem again after he immigrated to the US. So he came to the US in 1932. And I think in 1934 or</p>
<p>1935, he was working with another physicist called Rosen, who he did several important works with,</p>
<p>and they revisited the question. And they had a problem that most of us as students always had,</p>
<p>that study general relativity. General relativity is really hard because it&rsquo;s four dimensional</p>
<p>instead of three dimensional. And if you don&rsquo;t set it up right, you get infinities,</p>
<p>which don&rsquo;t belong there. We call them coordinate singularities as a name. But if you get these</p>
<p>infinities, you don&rsquo;t get the answers you want. And he was trying to derive now general relativity</p>
<p>from general relativity, gravitational waves. And in doing it, he kept getting these infinities.</p>
<p>And so he wrote a paper with Rosen that he submitted to our most important journal,</p>
<p>Physical Review Letters. And that when it was submitted to Physical Review Letters,</p>
<p>it was entitled, Do Gravitational Waves Exist? A very funny title to write 20 years after he</p>
<p>proposed they exist. But it&rsquo;s because he had found these singularities, these infinities. And so</p>
<p>the editor at that time, and the part of it that I don&rsquo;t know, is peer review. We live and die by</p>
<p>peer review as scientists send our stuff out. We don&rsquo;t know when peer review actually started</p>
<p>or what peer review Einstein ever experienced before this time. But the editor of Physical</p>
<p>Review sent this out for review. He had a choice. He could take any article and just accept it.</p>
<p>He could reject it, or he could send it for review. I believe the editors used to have much</p>
<p>more power. Yeah, yeah. And he was a young man. His name was Tate. And he ended up being editor</p>
<p>for years. So he sent this for review to a theoretical physicist named Robertson, who was</p>
<p>also in this field of general relativity, who happened to be on sabbatical at that moment at</p>
<p>Caltech. Otherwise, his institution was Princeton, where Einstein was. And he saw that the way they</p>
<p>set up the problem, the infinities were like I make it as a student, because if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>set it up right in general relativity, you get these infinities. And so he reviewed the article</p>
<p>and gave an illustration that if they set it up in what are called cylindrical coordinates, these</p>
<p>infinities went away. The editor of Physical Review was obviously intimidated by Einstein.</p>
<p>He wrote this really not a letter back like I would get saying, you&rsquo;re screwed up in your paper</p>
<p>instead. It was kind of, what do you think of the comments of our referee? Einstein wrote back,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a well documented letter, wrote back a letter to Physical Review saying, I didn&rsquo;t send</p>
<p>you the paper to send it to one of your so called experts. I sent it to you to publish. I withdraw</p>
<p>the paper. And he never published again in that journal. That was 1936. Instead, he rewrote it</p>
<p>with the fixes that were made, changed the title and published it in what was called the Franklin</p>
<p>Review, which is the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, which is Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>Institute, which doesn&rsquo;t have a journal now, but did at that time. So the article is published.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the last time he ever wrote about it. It remained controversial. So it wasn&rsquo;t until</p>
<p>close to 1960, 1958, where there was a conference that brought together the experts in general</p>
<p>relativity to try to sort out whether it was true that there were gravitational waves or not.</p>
<p>And there was a very nice derivation by a British theorist from the heart of the theory that gets</p>
<p>gravitational waves. And that was number one. The second thing that happened at that meeting is</p>
<p>Richard Feynman was there. And Feynman said, well, if there&rsquo;s typical Feynman, if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gravitational waves, they need to be able to do something, otherwise they don&rsquo;t exist. So they</p>
<p>have to be able to transfer energy. So he made an idea of a gedankenexperiment that is just a bar</p>
<p>with a couple of rings on it. And then if a gravitational wave goes through, it distorts the</p>
<p>bar and that creates friction on these little rings and that&rsquo;s heat and that&rsquo;s energy. So that</p>
<p>meant&hellip; Is that a good idea? That sounds like a good idea. Yeah. It means that he showed that</p>
<p>that with the distortion of space time, you could transfer energy just by this little idea.</p>
<p>And it was shown theoretically. So at that point, it was believed theoretically then</p>
<p>by people that gravitational waves should exist. No, we should be able to detect them.</p>
<p>We should be able to detect them, except that they&rsquo;re very, very small.</p>
<p>And so what kind of, there&rsquo;s a bunch of questions here, but what kind of events</p>
<p>would generate gravitational waves? You have to have this, what I call quadrupole moment.</p>
<p>That comes about if I have, for example, two objects that go around each other like this,</p>
<p>like the earth around the sun or the moon around the earth, or in our case, it turns out to be two</p>
<p>black holes going around each other like this. So how&rsquo;s that different than basic oscillation</p>
<p>back and forth? Is it just more common in nature to have&hellip; Oscillation is a dipole moment. So it</p>
<p>has to be in three dimensional space kind of oscillation. So you have to have something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s three dimensional that&rsquo;ll give what I called a quadrupole moment. That&rsquo;s just built</p>
<p>into this. And luckily in nature you have stuff&hellip; And luckily things exist. And it is luckily</p>
<p>because the effect is so small that you could say, look, I could take a barbell</p>
<p>and spin it, right? And detect the gravitational waves. But unfortunately, no matter how much I</p>
<p>spin it, how fast I spin it, so I know how to make gravitational waves, but they&rsquo;re so weak,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t detect them. So we have to take something that&rsquo;s stronger than I can make. Otherwise we</p>
<p>would do what Hertz did for electromagnetic waves. Go in our lab, take a barbell, put it on</p>
<p>something, spin it. Can I ask a dumb question? So a single object that&rsquo;s weirdly shaped,</p>
<p>does that generate gravitational waves? So if it&rsquo;s rotating? Sure. But it&rsquo;s just a much weaker signal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weaker. Well, we didn&rsquo;t know what the strongest signal would be that we would see.</p>
<p>We targeted seeing something called neutron stars actually, because black holes we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know very much about. It turned out we were a little bit lucky. There was a stronger source,</p>
<p>which was the black holes. Well, another ridiculous question. So you say waves. What does a wave mean?</p>
<p>Like the most ridiculous version of that question is, what does it feel like to ride a wave as you</p>
<p>get closer to the source? Or experience it? Well, if you experience a wave, imagine that this is</p>
<p>what happens to you. I don&rsquo;t know what you mean about getting close. It comes to you. So it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this light wave or something that comes through you. So when a light hits you, it makes your eyes</p>
<p>detect it. I flashed it. What does this do? It&rsquo;s like going to the amusement park, and they have</p>
<p>these mirrors. You look in this mirror and you look short and fat, and the one next to you makes</p>
<p>you tall and thin. Imagine that you went back and forth between those two mirrors once a second.</p>
<p>That would be a gravitational wave with a period of once a second. If you did it 60 times a second,</p>
<p>go back and forth. And then that&rsquo;s all that happens. It makes you taller and shorter and</p>
<p>fatter back and forth as it goes through you at the frequency of the gravitational wave. So the</p>
<p>frequencies that we detect are higher than one a second, but that&rsquo;s the idea. And the amount is</p>
<p>small. Amount is small, but if you&rsquo;re closer to the source of the wave, is it the same amount?</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t dissipate. It doesn&rsquo;t dissipate. Okay, so it&rsquo;s not that fun of an amusement ride.</p>
<p>Well, it does dissipate, but it&rsquo;s proportional to the distance.</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s not a big power.</p>
<p>Right. Gotcha. But it would be a fun ride if you get a little bit closer or a lot closer.</p>
<p>I mean, I wonder what the&hellip; Okay, this is a ridiculous question, but I have you here.</p>
<p>I mean, the getting fatter and taller, I mean, that experience, for some reason,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mind blowing to me because it brings the distortion of space time to you. I mean,</p>
<p>space time is being morphed, right? Like this is a wave.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so weird.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in space, so we&rsquo;re affected by it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re in space and now it&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s moving. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it. I mean, does it&hellip; Okay.</p>
<p>How much do you think about the philosophical implications of</p>
<p>general relativity? Like that we&rsquo;re in space time and it can be bent by gravity.</p>
<p>Like, is that just what it is? Are we supposed to be okay with this? Because like Newton,</p>
<p>even Newton is a little weird, right? But that at least like makes sense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our physical world. When an apple falls, it makes sense. But the fact that</p>
<p>entirety of the space time we&rsquo;re in can bend, that&rsquo;s really mind blowing.</p>
<p>Let me make another analogy.</p>
<p>This is a therapy session for me at this point.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. Another analogy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So imagine you have a trampoline.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay. What happens if you put a marble on a trampoline? It doesn&rsquo;t do anything, right?</p>
<p>No. Just a little bit, but not much.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, just if I drop it, it&rsquo;s not going to go anywhere.</p>
<p>Now imagine I put a bowling ball at the center of the trampoline.</p>
<p>Now I come up to the trampoline and I put a marble on, what happens?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll roll towards the bowling ball.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. So what&rsquo;s happened is the presence of this massive object distorted the space</p>
<p>that the trampoline did. This is the same thing that happens to the presence of the earth,</p>
<p>the earth and the apple. The presence of the earth affects the space around it,</p>
<p>just like the bowling ball on the trampoline.</p>
<p>Yeah. This doesn&rsquo;t make me feel better. I&rsquo;m referring from the perspective of an</p>
<p>ant walking around on that trampoline. Then some guy just dropped a ball and then not only dropped</p>
<p>the ball, right? It&rsquo;s not just dropping a bowling ball. It&rsquo;s making the ball go up and down or doing</p>
<p>some kind of oscillation thing where it&rsquo;s like waves. And that&rsquo;s so fundamentally different from</p>
<p>the experience on being on flatland and walking around and just finding delicious, sweet things</p>
<p>as ant does. And it just feels like to me from a human experience perspective, completely,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s humbling. It&rsquo;s truly humbling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humbling, but we see that kind of phenomenon all the time.</p>
<p>Let me give you another example. Imagine that you walk up to a still pond.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay. Now I throw, you throw a rock in it, what happens? The rock goes in, sinks to the bottom,</p>
<p>fine. And these little ripples go out and they travel out. That&rsquo;s exactly what happens. I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a disturbance, which is these, say, the bowling ball or black holes. And then the ripples</p>
<p>that go out in the water, they&rsquo;re not, they don&rsquo;t have any, they don&rsquo;t have the rock, any part,</p>
<p>pieces of the rock.</p>
<p>See, the thing is, I guess what&rsquo;s not disturbing about that is it&rsquo;s a, I mean, I guess a flat</p>
<p>two dimensional surface that&rsquo;s being disturbed. Like for a three dimensional surface, a three</p>
<p>dimensional space to be disturbed feels weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse. It&rsquo;s four dimensional because it&rsquo;s space and time.</p>
<p>Time, yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you need Einstein is to make it four dimensional.</p>
<p>To make it okay?</p>
<p>No, to make it.</p>
<p>To make it four dimensional?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, to take the same phenomenon and look at it in all of space and time. Anyway,</p>
<p>luckily for you and I and all of us, the amount of distortion is incredibly small.</p>
<p>So it turns out that if you think of space itself, now this is going to blow your mind too,</p>
<p>if you think of space as being like a material, like this table, it&rsquo;s very stiff. You know,</p>
<p>we have materials that are very pliable, materials that are very stiff. So space itself is very stiff.</p>
<p>So when gravitational waves come through it, luckily for us,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t distort it so much that it affects our ordinary life very much.</p>
<p>No, I mean, that&rsquo;s great. That&rsquo;s great. I thought there was something bad coming.</p>
<p>No, this is great. That&rsquo;s great news. So I mean, that, I mean, perhaps we evolved</p>
<p>as life on Earth to be such that for us, this particular set of effects of gravitational waves</p>
<p>is not that significant. Maybe that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>It is. You probably used this effect today or yesterday.</p>
<p>Did what?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pervasive. Well, because&hellip;</p>
<p>You mean gravity or the way, or external? Because I only&hellip;</p>
<p>Curvature of space and time.</p>
<p>Curvature of space. How? I only care, a person is a human, right? The gravity of Earth.</p>
<p>But you use it every day, almost.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s curving.</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No, no, no. It&rsquo;s in this thing. Every time it tells you where you are,</p>
<p>how does it tell you where you are? It tells you where you are because we have</p>
<p>24 satellites or some number that are going around in space and it asks how long it takes</p>
<p>the beam to go to the satellite and come back, the signal, to different ones.</p>
<p>And then it triangulates and tells you where you are. And then if you go down the road,</p>
<p>it tells you where you are. Do you know that if you did that with the satellites and you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t use Einstein&rsquo;s equations?</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t get the right answer. That&rsquo;s right. And in fact, if you take a road that&rsquo;s, say,</p>
<p>10 meters wide, I&rsquo;ve done these numbers, and you ask how long you&rsquo;d stay on the road if</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t make the correction for general relativity, this thing you&rsquo;re poo pooing,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re using every day, you&rsquo;d go off the road in about a minute.</p>
<p>Well, actually, that might be my problem.</p>
<p>So you use it. So don&rsquo;t poo poo it.</p>
<p>Well, I think I&rsquo;m using an Android, so maybe, and the GPS doesn&rsquo;t work that well, so maybe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Newton&rsquo;s physics. So I need to upgrade to general relativity. So gravitational waves</p>
<p>and Einstein had, wait, Feynman really does have a part in the story?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Was that one of the first kind of experimental proposed to detect gravitational waves?</p>
<p>Well, he did what we call a Godonkin experiment. That&rsquo;s a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay. Not a real experiment. But then after that, then people believe gravitational waves</p>
<p>must exist. You can kind of calculate how big they are. They&rsquo;re tiny. And so people</p>
<p>started searching. The first idea that was used was Feynman&rsquo;s idea, and the very end of it.</p>
<p>And it was to take a great big, huge bar of aluminum and then put around, and it&rsquo;s made</p>
<p>like a cylinder, and then put around it some very, very sensitive detectors so that if a</p>
<p>gravitational wave happened to go through it, it would go, and you&rsquo;d detect this extra strain</p>
<p>that was there. And that was this method that was used until we came along. It wasn&rsquo;t a very</p>
<p>good method to use.</p>
<p>And what was the, so we&rsquo;re talking about a pretty weak signal here.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why that method didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So what, can you tell the story of figuring out what kind of method would be able to detect</p>
<p>this very weak signal of gravitational waves?</p>
<p>So remembering what happens when you go to the amusement park, that it&rsquo;s going to do something</p>
<p>like stretch this way and squash that way, squash this way and stretch this way. We do</p>
<p>have an instrument that can detect that kind of thing. It&rsquo;s called an interferometer.</p>
<p>And what it does is it just basically takes, usually light, and the two directions that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about, you send light down one direction and the perpendicular direction.</p>
<p>And if nothing changes, it takes the same, and the arms are the same length, it just</p>
<p>goes down, bounces back. And if you invert one compared to the other, they cancel so</p>
<p>that nothing happens.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s like the amusement park and one of the arms got shorter and fatter, so it</p>
<p>took longer to go horizontally than it did to go vertically, then when the light comes</p>
<p>back, that comes back somewhat out of time. And that basically is the scheme. The only</p>
<p>problem is that that&rsquo;s not done very accurately in general, and we had to do it extremely</p>
<p>accurately.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difficulty of doing so accurately?</p>
<p>Okay. So the measurement that we have to do is a distortion in time. How big is it? It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a distortion that&rsquo;s one part in 10 to the 21. That&rsquo;s 21 zeros and a one. Okay.</p>
<p>So this is like a delay in the thing coming back?</p>
<p>One of them coming back after the other one, but the difference is just one part in 10</p>
<p>to the 21. So for that reason, we make it big, let the arms be long. Okay, so one part</p>
<p>in 10 to the 21. In our case, it&rsquo;s kilometers long. So we have an instrument that&rsquo;s kilometers</p>
<p>in one direction, kilometers in the other.</p>
<p>How many kilometers are we talking about? Four kilometers.</p>
<p>Four kilometers in each direction. If you take then one part in 10 to the 21, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about measuring something to 10 to the minus 18 meters.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, to tell you how small that is, the proton thing we&rsquo;re made of, which you can&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>and grab so easily, is 10 to the minus 15 meters. So this is one one thousandth the</p>
<p>size of a proton. That&rsquo;s the size of the effect. Einstein himself didn&rsquo;t think this</p>
<p>could be measured. We&rsquo;ve never seen, actually, he said that. But that&rsquo;s because he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>anticipate modern lasers and techniques that we developed.</p>
<p>Okay. So maybe can you tell me a little bit what you&rsquo;re referring to as LIGO, the Laser</p>
<p>Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. What is LIGO? Can you just elaborate kind</p>
<p>of the big picture view here before I ask you specific questions about it?</p>
<p>Yeah. So in the same idea that I just said, we have two long vacuum pipes, four kilometers</p>
<p>long. We start with a laser beam and we divide the beam going down the two arms. And we have</p>
<p>a mirror at the other end, reflects it back. It&rsquo;s more subtle, but we bring it back. If</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no distortion in space time and the lengths are exactly the same, which we calibrate</p>
<p>them to be, then when it comes back, if we just invert one signal compared to the other,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just cancel. So we see nothing. Okay. But if one arm got a little bit longer than</p>
<p>the other, then they don&rsquo;t come back at exactly the same time. They don&rsquo;t exactly cancel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we measure. So to give a number to it, we have the change of length to be</p>
<p>able to do this 10 to the minus 18 meters to one part in 10 to the 12th. And that was</p>
<p>the big experimental challenge that required a lot of innovation to be able to do.</p>
<p>You gave a lot of credit to, I think, Caltech and MIT for some of the technical developments</p>
<p>within this project. Is there some interesting things you can speak to at the low level of</p>
<p>some cool stuff that had to be solved? I&rsquo;m a software engineer, so I have so much more</p>
<p>respect for everything done here than anything I&rsquo;ve ever done. So I&rsquo;ll give you an example</p>
<p>of doing mechanical engineering at a better, basically mechanical engineering and geology</p>
<p>and maybe at a level. So what&rsquo;s the problem? The problem is the following, that I&rsquo;ve given</p>
<p>you this picture of an instrument that by some magic, I can make good enough to measure</p>
<p>this very short distance. But then I put it down here, it won&rsquo;t work. And the reason it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work is that the Earth itself is moving all over the place all the time. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize it, it seems pretty good to you, but it&rsquo;s moving all the time. So somehow it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>moving so much that we can&rsquo;t deal with it. We happen to be trying to do the experiment</p>
<p>here on Earth, but we can&rsquo;t deal with it. So we have to make the instrument isolated</p>
<p>from the Earth at the frequencies we&rsquo;re at. We&rsquo;ve got to float it. That&rsquo;s an engineering</p>
<p>problem, not a physics problem.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re having a conversation on a podcast right now, and people who record music work</p>
<p>with this, how to create an isolated room. And they usually build a room within a room,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s still not isolated. In fact, they say it&rsquo;s impossible to truly isolate from</p>
<p>sound, from noise and stuff like that. But that&rsquo;s like one step of millions that you</p>
<p>took is building a room inside a room, because you basically have to isolate all.</p>
<p>No, this is actually an easier problem. You just have to do it really well. So making</p>
<p>a clean room is really a tough problem because you have to put a room inside a room. This</p>
<p>is really simple engineering or physics. Okay, so what do you have to do? How do you isolate</p>
<p>yourself from the Earth? First, we work at, we&rsquo;re not looking at all frequencies for</p>
<p>gravitational waves. We&rsquo;re looking at particular frequencies that you can deal with here on</p>
<p>Earth. So what are frequencies would those be? You were just talking about frequencies.</p>
<p>We know by evolution, our bodies know, it&rsquo;s the audio band. Okay, the reason our ears</p>
<p>work where they work is that&rsquo;s where the Earth isn&rsquo;t going, making too much noise.</p>
<p>Okay, so the reason our ears work the way they work is because this is where it&rsquo;s quiet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. So if you go to one Hertz instead of 10 Hertz, the Earth is really moving around.</p>
<p>So somehow we live in what we call the audio band. It&rsquo;s tens of Hertz to thousands of Hertz.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we live, okay? If we&rsquo;re going to do an experiment on the Earth, it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>same frequency. That&rsquo;s where the Earth is the quietest. So we have to work in that frequency.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not looking at all frequencies, okay? So the solution for the shaking of the Earth</p>
<p>to get rid of it is pretty mundane if we do the same thing that you do to make your car drive</p>
<p>smoothly down the road. So what happens when your car goes over a bump? Early cars did that,</p>
<p>they bounced. Right.</p>
<p>Okay, but you don&rsquo;t feel that in your car. So what happened to that energy? You can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>disappear energy. So we have these things called shock absorbers in the car. What they do is they</p>
<p>take the thing that went like that, and they basically can&rsquo;t get rid of the energy, but they</p>
<p>move it to very, very low frequency. So what you feel isn&rsquo;t, you feel it go smoothly, okay? All</p>
<p>right. So we also work at this frequency. So we basically, why don&rsquo;t we have to do anything other</p>
<p>than shock absorbers? So we made the world&rsquo;s fanciest shock absorbers, okay? Not just like in</p>
<p>your car where there&rsquo;s one layer of them. They&rsquo;re just the right squishiness and so forth. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>better than what&rsquo;s in the cars. And we have four layers of it. So whatever shakes and gets through</p>
<p>the first layer, we treat it in a second, third, fourth layer. So it&rsquo;s a mechanical engineering</p>
<p>problem. Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I said. So it&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s no weird tricks to it, like a chemistry</p>
<p>type thing. No, no. Just, well, the right squishiness, you need the right material inside.</p>
<p>And ours look like little springs, but they&rsquo;re. Springs? They&rsquo;re springs? So like legitimately,</p>
<p>like shock absorbers. Yeah. What? Okay. Okay. And this is now experimental physics at the,</p>
<p>at its limit. Okay. So you do this and we make the world&rsquo;s fanciest shock absorbers,</p>
<p>just mechanical engineering. Just mechanical engineering, this is hilarious. But we didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t good enough to discover gravitational waves. So we did another, we added another</p>
<p>feature and it&rsquo;s something else that you&rsquo;re aware of, probably have one. And that is to get rid of</p>
<p>noise. You&rsquo;ve probably noise, which is, you don&rsquo;t like. And that&rsquo;s the same principle that&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>these little Bose earphones. Noise canceling? Noise canceling. So how do they work? They</p>
<p>basically, you go on an airplane and they sense the ambient noise from the engines</p>
<p>and cancel it. Cause it&rsquo;s just the same over and over again. They cancel it. And when the stewardess</p>
<p>comes and asks you whether you want coffee or tea or a drink or something, you hear, you&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s not ambient. She&rsquo;s the signal. So. Are we talking about active canceling? Like where</p>
<p>are the. Active canceling. So. This is, okay. So another. Don&rsquo;t tell me you have active canceling</p>
<p>on this. Yeah. Besides the shock absorbers. So we had this, so inside this array of shock absorbers.</p>
<p>Yeah. We, you asked for some interesting. This is awesome. So inside this, it&rsquo;s harder than the,</p>
<p>the earphone problem, but it&rsquo;s just engineering. We have to see measure, not just that the</p>
<p>engine still made noise, but the earth is shaking. It&rsquo;s moving in some direction. So we have to</p>
<p>actually tell not only that there&rsquo;s noise and cancel it, but what direction it&rsquo;s from. So we</p>
<p>put this array of seismometers inside this array of shock absorbers and measure the residual motion</p>
<p>and its direction. And we put little actuators that push back against it and cancel it.</p>
<p>This is awesome. So you have the actuators and you have the thing that is sensing the,</p>
<p>the vibrations and then you have the actual actuators that adjust for that and do so in</p>
<p>perfect synchrony. Yeah. What if it all works right. And so how much do we reduce the shaking</p>
<p>of the earth? I mean, one part in 10 to the 12th. One part in 10. So what gets through us is one</p>
<p>part in 10 to the 12th. That&rsquo;s pretty big reduction. You don&rsquo;t need that in your car,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what we do. And so that&rsquo;s how isolated we are from the earth. And that was the biggest,</p>
<p>and that was the biggest, I&rsquo;d say technical problem outside of the physics instrument,</p>
<p>the interferometer. Can I ask you a weird question here? You make it very poetically</p>
<p>and humorously is saying it&rsquo;s just a mechanical engineering problem, but is this one of the</p>
<p>biggest precision mechanical engineering efforts ever? I mean, this seems exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p>It is. And so it took a long time. And I think nobody seems to challenge the statement that</p>
<p>this is the most precision, precise instrument it&rsquo;s ever been built, LIGO.</p>
<p>I wonder what like listening to Led Zeppelin sounds on this thing,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so isolated. I mean, this is like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>No background. No, no back. It&rsquo;s wow. Wow. Wow. So when you were first</p>
<p>conceiving this, I would probably, if I was knowledgeable enough,</p>
<p>kind of laugh off the possibility that this is even possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, like how many people believe that this is possible? Did you believe this is possible?</p>
<p>I did. I didn&rsquo;t know that we needed, for sure that we needed active. When we started,</p>
<p>we did dispassive, but we were doing the tests to develop the active to add as a second stage,</p>
<p>which we ended up needing. But there was a lot of, you know, now there was a lot of skepticism.</p>
<p>A lot of us, especially astronomers, felt that money was being wasted,</p>
<p>because we were also expensive. Doing what I told you is not cheap. So it was kind of</p>
<p>controversial. It was funded by the National Science Foundation. Can you just linger on this</p>
<p>just for a little longer? The actuator thing, the act of canceling. Do you remember like little</p>
<p>experiments that were done along the way to prove to the team themselves that this is even possible?</p>
<p>Because I work with quite a bit of robots, and to me, the idea that you could do it this precisely</p>
<p>is humbling and embarrassing, frankly. Because like, this is another level of precision that I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even, because robots are a mess. And this is basically one of the most precise robots ever.</p>
<p>Right. So like, is there, do you have any like small scale experiments that were done that just</p>
<p>be like, this is possible? Yeah, and larger scale. We made a test, that also has to be in vacuum too,</p>
<p>but we made test chambers that had this system in it, our first mock of this system, so we could test</p>
<p>it and optimize it and make it work. But it&rsquo;s just a mechanical engineering problem. Okay.</p>
<p>And humans are just ape descendants. I gotcha. I gotcha. Is there any video of this? Like some kind</p>
<p>of educational purpose visualizations of this act of canceling? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I mean, does this live on? Well, we work for parts of it, for the active canceling,</p>
<p>we worked with, for the instruments, for the sensor and instruments, we worked with a small</p>
<p>company near where you are, because it was our MIT people that got them that were, you know,</p>
<p>interested in the problem because they thought they might be able to commercialize it for</p>
<p>making stable tables to make microelectronics, for example, which are limited by how stable the table</p>
<p>is. I mean, at this point, it&rsquo;s a little expensive. So you never know, never know where this leads.</p>
<p>So maybe on the, let me ask you, just sticking it a little longer, this silly old mechanical</p>
<p>engineering problem. What was to you kind of the darkest moment of what was the hardest</p>
<p>stumbling block to get over on the engineer side? Like, was there any time where there&rsquo;s a doubt,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not sure we would be able to do this, a kind of engineering challenge that was</p>
<p>hit? Do you remember anything like that? I think the one that my colleague at MIT,</p>
<p>Ray Weiss, worked on so hard and was much more of a worry than this. This is only a question if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not doing well enough, you have to keep making it better somehow. But this whole huge instrument has</p>
<p>to be in vacuum. And the vacuum tanks are, you know, this big around. And so it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>biggest high vacuum system. And how do you make it? First of all, how do you make this four meter</p>
<p>long sealed vacuum system? It has to be made out of four kilometers, four kilometers long. Would I</p>
<p>say something else? Meters. Four kilometers long. Big difference. Yeah. And so, but to make it,</p>
<p>yeah, we started with a roll of stainless steel, and then we roll it out like a spiral so that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a spiral weld on it. Okay, so the engineering was fine. We did that. We worked through</p>
<p>very good companies and so forth to build it. But the big worry was, what if you develop a leak?</p>
<p>This is a high vacuum, not just vacuum system. Typically, in a laboratory, if there&rsquo;s a leak,</p>
<p>you put helium around the thing you have, and then you detect where the helium is coming in.</p>
<p>But if you have something as big as this, you can&rsquo;t surround it with helium. So you might not</p>
<p>actually even know that there&rsquo;s a leak and it will be affecting it. Well, we can measure how</p>
<p>good the vacuum is so we can know that, but a leak can develop and then we don&rsquo;t, how do we fix it</p>
<p>or how do we find it? And so that was, you asked about a worry. That was always a really big worry.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference, you know, high vacuum and a vacuum? What is high vacuum? That&rsquo;s like some</p>
<p>delta close to vacuum? Is it some threshold? Well, there&rsquo;s a unit. High vacuum is when the vacuum</p>
<p>and the units that are used, which are tors, there&rsquo;s 10 to the minus nine. And there&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>vacuum is usually used in small places. The biggest vacuum system period is at CERN in this</p>
<p>big particle accelerator, but the high vacuum where they need really good vacuum so particles</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t scatter in it is smaller than ours. So ours is a really large high vacuum system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. This is so cool. I mean, this is basically by far the greatest listening device</p>
<p>ever built by human. The fact that like descendants of apes could do this, that evolution started with</p>
<p>single cell organisms. I mean, is there any more, I&rsquo;m a huge theory is like, yeah, yeah. But like</p>
<p>bridges, when I look at bridges from a civil engineering perspective, it&rsquo;s one of the most</p>
<p>beautiful creations by human beings. It&rsquo;s physics. You&rsquo;re using physics to construct objects that</p>
<p>can support huge amount of mass and it&rsquo;s like structural, but it&rsquo;s also beautiful.</p>
<p>And that humans can collaborate to create that throughout history. And then you take this</p>
<p>on another level. This is, this is like, it&rsquo;s exciting to me beyond measure that humans can</p>
<p>create something so precise. But another concept lost in this, you just said, you started talking</p>
<p>about single cell. Yeah. Okay. You have to realize this discovery that we made that everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bought off on happened 1.3 billion years ago, somewhere. And then the signal came to us 1.3</p>
<p>billion years ago, we were just converting on the earth from single cell to multi cell life.</p>
<p>So when this actually happened, this collision of two black holes, we weren&rsquo;t here. We weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even close to developing single. Yeah, we were had, we&rsquo;re going from single cell to multi cell</p>
<p>life at that point. All to meet up at this, at this point. Yeah. Wow. That&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>romantic. It is. Okay. So on the human side of things, it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about over a thousand people team for LIGO. Yeah. They started out with, you know,</p>
<p>around a hundred and you&rsquo;ve for parts of the time at least led this team. What does it take to lead</p>
<p>a team like this of incredibly brilliant theoreticians and engineers and just a lot of</p>
<p>different parties involved? A lot of egos, a lot of ideas. You had this fun, funny example,</p>
<p>I forget where, where in publishing a paper, you have to all agree on like, you know, the phrasing</p>
<p>of a certain sentence or the title of the paper and so on. That&rsquo;s a very interesting, simple</p>
<p>example. I&rsquo;d love you to speak to that, but just in general, how, what does it take to lead this</p>
<p>kind of team? Okay. I think that the general idea is one we all know. You want to, you want to,</p>
<p>you want to get where the, the sum of something is more than the individual parts is what we say,</p>
<p>right? Yeah. So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve. Yes. Okay. How do you do that? Actually,</p>
<p>mostly if we take multiple objects or people, I mean, you put them together, the sum is less.</p>
<p>Yes. Why? Because they overlap. So you don&rsquo;t have individual things that, you know, this</p>
<p>person does that, this person does that, then you get exactly the sum. But what you want is to</p>
<p>develop where you get more than what the individual contributions are. We know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very common. People use that expression everywhere. And it&rsquo;s the expression that has to be kind of</p>
<p>built into how people feel it&rsquo;s working. Because if you&rsquo;re part of a team, and you realize that</p>
<p>somehow the team is able to do more than the individuals could do themselves, then they buy on</p>
<p>kind of in terms of the process. So that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s the goal that you have to have is to, to</p>
<p>achieve that. And that means that you have to realize parts of what you&rsquo;re trying to do that</p>
<p>require not that one person couldn&rsquo;t do it, it requires the combined talents to be able to do</p>
<p>something that neither of them could do themselves. And we have a lot of that kind of thing. And I</p>
<p>think, I mean, build into the some of the examples that I gave you. And so, how do you then, so, so</p>
<p>the key almost in anything you do is the people themselves, right? So in our case,</p>
<p>the first and most important was to attract to spend years of their life on this. And the best</p>
<p>possible people in the world to do it. So the only way to convince them is that somehow it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better and more interesting for them than what they could do themselves. And so that&rsquo;s part of</p>
<p>this idea. Yeah, that&rsquo;s powerful. But nevertheless, there&rsquo;s best people in the world, there&rsquo;s egos. Is</p>
<p>there something to be said about managing egos? Oh, that&rsquo;s the human problem is always the hardest.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s an art, not a science, I think. I think the fact here that combined,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a was a romantic goal that we had to, you know, do something that people hadn&rsquo;t done before,</p>
<p>which was important scientifically and, and a huge challenge, enabled us to say, take and get, I mean,</p>
<p>what we did just to take an example, we use the light to go in this thing comes from lasers.</p>
<p>We need a certain kind of laser. So the kind of laser that we use, there were three different</p>
<p>institutions in the world that had the experts that do this, maybe in competition with each other.</p>
<p>So we got all three to join together and work with us to work on this as an example. So that</p>
<p>you had, and they had the thing that they were working together on a kind of object that they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise. And we&rsquo;re part of a bigger team where they could discover something</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t even engineers. These are engineers that do laser. So, and they&rsquo;re part of our laser</p>
<p>physicists. So could you describe the moment or the period of time when finally this incredible</p>
<p>creation of human beings led to a detection of gravitational waves? It&rsquo;s a long story. Unfortunately,</p>
<p>this is a part that we started failures along the way kind of thing or all failures. That&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s built into it. If you&rsquo;re not, if you&rsquo;re not mechanical engineering, you build on your failures,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s expected. So we&rsquo;re trying things that no one&rsquo;s done before. So it&rsquo;s technically not just</p>
<p>gravitational waves. And so it&rsquo;s built on failures. But anyway, we did before me, even</p>
<p>there, the people did R&amp;D on the concepts. But starting in 1994, we got money from the National</p>
<p>Science Foundation to build this thing. It took about five years to build it. So by 1999, we had</p>
<p>built the basic unit. It did not have active seismic isolation at that stage, didn&rsquo;t have some</p>
<p>other things that we have now. What we did at the beginning was stick to technologies that we had</p>
<p>at least enough knowledge that we could make work or had tested in our own laboratories. And so then</p>
<p>we put together the instrument. We made it work. It didn&rsquo;t work very well, but it worked. And we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t see any gravitational waves. Then we figured out what limited us. And we went through this</p>
<p>every year for almost 10 years, never seeing gravitational waves. We would run it, looking for</p>
<p>gravitational waves for months, learn what limited us, fix it for months, and then run it again.</p>
<p>Eventually, we knew we had to take another big step. And that&rsquo;s when we made several changes,</p>
<p>including adding these active seismic isolation, which turned out to be a key. And we</p>
<p>fortunately got the National Science Foundation to give us another couple hundred million dollars,</p>
<p>100 million more. And we rebuild it or fixed or improved it. And then in 2015, we turned it on.</p>
<p>And we almost instantly saw this first collision of two black holes.</p>
<p>And then we went through a process of, do we believe what we&rsquo;ve seen?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you&rsquo;re one of the people that went through that process. It sounds like some people</p>
<p>immediately believed it. And then you&rsquo;re like&hellip;</p>
<p>So as human beings, we all have different reactions to almost anything. And so</p>
<p>quite a few of my colleagues had a eureka moment immediately. I mean, the figure that we put in our</p>
<p>paper, first is just data. We didn&rsquo;t have to go through fancy computer programs to do anything.</p>
<p>And we show next to it the calculations of Einstein&rsquo;s equations. It looks just like what</p>
<p>we detected. And we did it in two different detectors halfway across the US. So it was</p>
<p>pretty convincing, but you don&rsquo;t want to fool yourself. So being a scientist, for me, we had</p>
<p>to go through and try to understand that the instrument itself, which was new, I said we had</p>
<p>rebuild it, couldn&rsquo;t somehow generate things that look like this. That took some tests. And then the</p>
<p>second, you&rsquo;ll appreciate more, we had to somehow convince ourselves we weren&rsquo;t hacked in some</p>
<p>clever way.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity question.</p>
<p>Yeah. Even though we&rsquo;re not on the internet, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah. No, it can be physical access too. Yeah. That&rsquo;s fascinating. It&rsquo;s fascinating that you</p>
<p>would think about that. I mean, not enough. I mean, because it matches prediction. So the chances</p>
<p>of it actually being manipulated is very, very low. But nevertheless&hellip;</p>
<p>We still could have disgruntled all the graduate students who had worked with us earlier that&hellip;</p>
<p>Who want you to&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how that&rsquo;s supposed to embarrass you. I suppose, yeah. I suppose I</p>
<p>see. But about what I think you said, within a month, you kind of convinced yourself officially.</p>
<p>Within a month, we convinced ourselves. We kept a thousand collaborators quiet during that time.</p>
<p>Then we spent another month or so trying to understand what we&rsquo;d seen so that we could do the</p>
<p>science with it instead of just putting it out to the world and let somebody else understand that it</p>
<p>was two black holes and what it was. The fact that a thousand collaborators were quiet</p>
<p>is a really strong indication that this is a really close knit team. Yeah. And they&rsquo;re around</p>
<p>the world. Either strong knit or tight knit or had a strong dictatorship or something. Yeah.</p>
<p>Either fear or love. You can rule by fear or love. Yeah, right. You can go back to Machiavelli.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right. Well, this is really exciting that that&rsquo;s a success story because it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to be a success story, right? I mean, eventually, perhaps you could say it&rsquo;ll be an</p>
<p>event, but it could have taken over a century to get there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it&rsquo;s only downhill</p>
<p>now. What do you mean? You mean with gravitational waves? Yeah. Well, now we&rsquo;re off because of the</p>
<p>pandemic, but when we turned off, we were seeing some sort of gravitational wave event each week.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re fixing, we&rsquo;re adding features where it&rsquo;ll probably be when we turn back on next year,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll probably be one every couple days. And they&rsquo;re not all the same. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>learning about what&rsquo;s out there in gravity instead of just optics. So it&rsquo;s all great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only limited by the fantastic thing other than that this is a great field and it&rsquo;s all new</p>
<p>and so forth is that experimentally, the great thing is that we&rsquo;re limited by technology and</p>
<p>technical limitations, not by science. So another really important discovery that was made before</p>
<p>ours was what&rsquo;s called the Higgs boson made on the big accelerator at CERN. This huge accelerator,</p>
<p>they discovered a really important thing. We have Einstein&rsquo;s equation, E equals MC squared.</p>
<p>So energy makes mass or mass can make energy and that&rsquo;s the bomb. But the mechanism by which that</p>
<p>happens, not vision, but how do you create mass from energy was never understood until there was</p>
<p>a theory of it about 70 years ago now. And so they discovered it&rsquo;s named after a man named Higgs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Higgs boson. And so it was discovered, but since that time, and I worked</p>
<p>on those experiments since that time, they haven&rsquo;t been able to progress very much further,</p>
<p>a little bit, but not a lot further. And the difference is that we&rsquo;re really lucky</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in what we&rsquo;re doing in that there you see this Higgs boson, but there&rsquo;s tremendous amount</p>
<p>of other physics that goes on and you have to pick out the needle in the haystack of physics.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make the physics go away, it&rsquo;s there. In our case, we have a very weak signal, but once we</p>
<p>get good enough to see it, it&rsquo;s weak compared to where we&rsquo;ve reduced the background, but the</p>
<p>background is not physics, it&rsquo;s just technology. It&rsquo;s getting ourselves better isolated from the</p>
<p>Earth or getting a more powerful laser. And so since 2015, when we saw the first one,</p>
<p>we continually can make improvements that are enabling us to turn this into a real science</p>
<p>to do astronomy, a new kind of astronomy. It&rsquo;s a little like astronomy. Galileo started the field.</p>
<p>He basically took lenses that were made for classes and he didn&rsquo;t invent the first telescope,</p>
<p>but made a telescope, looked at Neptune and saw that it had four moons. That was the birth of</p>
<p>not just using your eyes to understand what&rsquo;s out there. And since that time, we&rsquo;ve made better and</p>
<p>better telescopes, obviously, and astronomy thrives. And in a similar way, we&rsquo;re starting to</p>
<p>be able to crawl, but we&rsquo;re starting to be able to do that with gravitational waves. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be more and more that we can do as we can make better and better instruments because,</p>
<p>as I say, it&rsquo;s not limited by picking it out of others. Yeah, it&rsquo;s not limited by the physics.</p>
<p>So you have an optimism about engineering that as human progress marches on,</p>
<p>engineering will always find a way to build a large enough device,</p>
<p>accurate enough device to detect the same thing. As long as it&rsquo;s not limited by physics,</p>
<p>yeah, they&rsquo;ll do it. So you, two other folks and the entire team won the Nobel prize for this big</p>
<p>effort. There&rsquo;s a million questions I can ask for, but looking back, where does the Nobel prize</p>
<p>fit into all of this? If you think hundreds of years from now, I venture to say that people</p>
<p>will not remember the winners of a prize, but they&rsquo;ll remember creations like these.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m romanticizing engineering, but I guess I want to ask how important is the Nobel prize in</p>
<p>all of this? Well, that&rsquo;s a complicated question. As a physicist, it&rsquo;s something if you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to win a Nobel prize, forget it because they give one a year. So there&rsquo;s been 200 physicists</p>
<p>who have won the Nobel prize since 1900. And so things just have to fall right. So your goal cannot</p>
<p>be to win a Nobel prize. It wasn&rsquo;t my dream. It&rsquo;s tremendous for science. Why the Nobel prize for a</p>
<p>guy that made dynamite and stuff is what it is. It&rsquo;s a long story, but it&rsquo;s the one day a year</p>
<p>where actually the science that people have done is all over the world and so forth. Forget about</p>
<p>the people again. It is really good for science. It celebrates science for several days, different</p>
<p>fields, chemistry, medicine and so forth. And everybody doesn&rsquo;t understand everything about</p>
<p>these. They&rsquo;re generally fairly abstract, but then it&rsquo;s on the front page of newspapers around</p>
<p>the world. So it&rsquo;s really good for science. It&rsquo;s not easy to get science on the front page of the</p>
<p>New York Times. It&rsquo;s not there. Should be, but it&rsquo;s not. And so the Nobel prize is important in that</p>
<p>way. Otherwise, I have a certain celebrity that I didn&rsquo;t have before. And now you get to be a</p>
<p>celebrity that advertises science. It&rsquo;s a mechanism to remind us how incredible, how much credit</p>
<p>science deserves and everything. Well, it has a little bit more. One thing I didn&rsquo;t expect,</p>
<p>which is good, is that we have a government. I&rsquo;m not picking on ours necessarily, but it&rsquo;s true of</p>
<p>all governments are not run by scientists. In our case, it&rsquo;s run by lawyers and businessmen.</p>
<p>Yep. Okay. And at best they may have an aide or something that knows a little science. So</p>
<p>in all countries hardly take into account science in making decisions.</p>
<p>Yes. Okay. And</p>
<p>having a Nobel prize, the people in those positions actually listen. So you have more</p>
<p>influence. I don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s about global warming or what the issue is. There&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>influence, which is lacking otherwise. And people pay attention to what I say. If I talk about</p>
<p>global warming, they wouldn&rsquo;t have before I had the Nobel prize. Yeah, this is very true. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like the celebrities who talk. Celebrity has power. Celebrity has power. And that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing. That&rsquo;s a good thing. Singling out people, I mean, on the other side of it, singling out</p>
<p>people has all kinds of, whether it&rsquo;s for Academy Awards or for this, have unfairness and</p>
<p>arbitrariness and so forth and so on. So that&rsquo;s the other side of the coin. Just like you said,</p>
<p>especially with the huge experimental projects like this, you know, it&rsquo;s a large team and it</p>
<p>does the nature of the Nobel prizes. It singles out a few individuals to represent the team.</p>
<p>Yeah. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing. What are ways to improve LIGO in the future,</p>
<p>increase the sensitivity? I&rsquo;ve seen a few ideas that are kind of fascinating. Are you interested</p>
<p>in them? I&rsquo;m not speaking about five years. Perhaps you could speak to the next five years,</p>
<p>but also the next hundred years. Yeah. So let me talk to both the instrument and the science.</p>
<p>Sure. So they go hand in hand. I mean, the thing that I said is if we make it better,</p>
<p>we see more kinds of weaker objects and we do astronomy. Okay. We&rsquo;re very motivated to make</p>
<p>a new instrument, which will be a big step, the next step, like making a new kind of telescope or</p>
<p>something. And the ideas of what that instrument should be haven&rsquo;t converged yet. There&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>ideas in Europe. They&rsquo;ve done more work to kind of develop the ideas, but they&rsquo;re different from</p>
<p>ours and we have ideas. But I think over the next few years, we&rsquo;ll develop those. The idea is to make</p>
<p>an instrument that&rsquo;s at least 10 times better than what we can do with this instrument, 10 times</p>
<p>better than that. 10 times better means you can look 10 times further out. 10 times further out</p>
<p>is a thousand times more volume. So you&rsquo;re seeing much, much more of the universe. The best way to</p>
<p>look at it is to look further out. The big change is that if you can see far out, you see further</p>
<p>back in history. Yeah, you&rsquo;re traveling back in time. Yeah. And so we can start to do what we</p>
<p>call cosmology instead of astronomy or astrophysics. Cosmology is really the study of the evolution of</p>
<p>the universe. And so then you can start to hope to get to the important problems having to do with</p>
<p>how the universe began, how it evolved and so forth, which we really only study now with</p>
<p>optical instruments or electromagnetic waves. And early in the universe, those were blocked because</p>
<p>it was, basically it wasn&rsquo;t transparent. So the photons couldn&rsquo;t get out when everything was too</p>
<p>dense. What do you think, sorry on this tangent, what do you think an understanding of gravitational</p>
<p>waves from earlier in the universe can help us understand about the Big Bang and all that kind</p>
<p>of stuff? Yeah. But it&rsquo;s a non, it&rsquo;s another perspective on the thing. Is there some insights</p>
<p>you think could be revealed just to help a layman understand? Sure. First, we don&rsquo;t understand. We</p>
<p>use the word Big Bang. We don&rsquo;t understand the physics of what the Big Bang itself was.</p>
<p>So I think, and in the early stage, there were particles and there was a huge amount of gravity</p>
<p>and mass being made. So I&rsquo;ll say two things. One is, how did it all start? How did it happen? I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>give you at least one example that we don&rsquo;t understand what we should understand. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why we&rsquo;re here. Yes. No, we do not. I don&rsquo;t mean it philosophically. I mean it in terms of</p>
<p>physics. Now, what do I mean by that? If I go into my laboratory at CERN or somewhere and I</p>
<p>collide particles together or put energy together, I make as much anti matter as matter. Anti matter</p>
<p>then annihilates matter and makes energy. So in the early universe, you made somehow a lot of</p>
<p>matter and anti matter, but there was an asymmetry. Somehow there was more matter and anti matter.</p>
<p>The matter and anti matter annihilated each other. At least that&rsquo;s what we think.</p>
<p>And there was only matter leftover. And we live in a universe that we see this all matter.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any idea. We have ideas, but we don&rsquo;t have any way to understand that at the</p>
<p>present time with the physics that we know. Can I ask a dumb question? Does anti matter have</p>
<p>anything like a gravitational field to send signals? So how does this asymmetry of matter</p>
<p>and anti matter could be investigated or further understood by observing gravitational fields or</p>
<p>weirdnesses in gravitational fields? I think that in principle, if there were anti neutron stars,</p>
<p>instead of just neutron stars, we would see different kinds of signals, but it didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>to that. We live in a universe that we&rsquo;ve done enough looking because we don&rsquo;t see anti matter,</p>
<p>anti protons anywhere, no matter what we look at, that it&rsquo;s all made out of matter.</p>
<p>Hmm. There is no anti matter except when we go in our laboratories.</p>
<p>So, but when we go in our laboratories, we make as much anti matter as matter.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about the early universe that made this asymmetry. So we can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>explain why we&rsquo;re here. That&rsquo;s what I meant. Physics wise, not in terms of how we evolved</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff. So there might be inklings of some of the physics that gravitational</p>
<p>So gravitational waves don&rsquo;t get obstructed like light. So I said light only goes to 300,000 years.</p>
<p>So it goes back to the beginning. So if you could study the early universe with gravitational waves,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t do that yet. Then it took 400 years to be able to do that with optical, but</p>
<p>but then you can really understand the very, maybe understand the very early universe.</p>
<p>So in terms of questions like why we&rsquo;re here or what the big bang was, we should be, we can,</p>
<p>in principle, study that with gravitational waves. So to keep moving in this direction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a unique kind of way to understand our universe.</p>
<p>So you think there&rsquo;s more Nobel prize level ideas to be discovered in relation to</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be shocked if there, if there isn&rsquo;t, not even going to that, which is a very long range problem.</p>
<p>But I think that we only see with electromagnetic waves, 4% of what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>There must be, we looked for things that we knew should be there. There should be,</p>
<p>I would be shocked if there wasn&rsquo;t physics, objects, science, and with gravity that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>show up in everything we do with telescopes. So I think we&rsquo;re just limited by not having</p>
<p>powerful enough instruments yet to do this.</p>
<p>Do you have a preference? I keep seeing this E. Lisa idea.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it, do you have a preference for earthbound or space faring mechanisms for?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re complimentary. It&rsquo;s a little bit like, it&rsquo;s completely analogous to what&rsquo;s been done</p>
<p>in astronomy. So astronomy from the time of Galileo was done with visible light.</p>
<p>The big advances in astronomy in the last 50 years are because we have instruments that look</p>
<p>at the infrared, microwave, ultraviolet and so forth. So looking at different wavelengths</p>
<p>has been important. Basically going into space means that we&rsquo;ll look at instead of the audio</p>
<p>band, which we look at, as we said on the Earth&rsquo;s surface, we&rsquo;ll look at lower frequencies.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s completely complimentary and it starts to be looking at different frequencies just</p>
<p>like we do with astronomy.</p>
<p>It seems almost incredible to me, engineering wise, just like on earth to send something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kilometers across into space. Is that harder to engineer?</p>
<p>It actually is a little different. It&rsquo;s three satellites separated by hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of kilometers and they send a laser beam from one to the other. And if the triangle changes</p>
<p>shape a little bit, they detect that from a graph.</p>
<p>Did you say hundreds of thousands of kilometers? Yeah. Sending lasers to each other. Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just engineering.</p>
<p>Is it possible though? Is it doable?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay. That&rsquo;s just incredible because they have to maintain, I mean, the precision here</p>
<p>is probably, there might be some more, what is it? Maybe noise is a smaller problem. I</p>
<p>guess there&rsquo;s no vibration to worry about like seismic stuff. So getting away from earth,</p>
<p>maybe you get away from seismic stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah. Those parts are easier. They don&rsquo;t have to measure it as accurately at low frequencies.</p>
<p>But they have a lot of tough engineering problems.</p>
<p>In order to detect that the gravitational waves affect things, the sensors have to be</p>
<p>what we call free masses, just like ours, are isolated from the earth. They have to</p>
<p>isolate it from the satellite. And that&rsquo;s a hard problem. They have to do that pretty,</p>
<p>not as well as we have to do it, but very well. And they&rsquo;ve done a test mission and</p>
<p>the engineering seems to be at least in principle in hand. This will be in the 2030s.</p>
<p>2030s?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is incredible. This is incredible. Let me ask about black holes.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re talking about is observing orbiting black holes. I saw the terminology of like</p>
<p>binary black hole systems.</p>
<p>Binary black holes.</p>
<p>Is that the one that&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re dancing? Okay.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both going around each other, just like the earth around the sun.</p>
<p>Okay. Is that weird that there&rsquo;s black holes going around each other?</p>
<p>So the finding binary systems of stars is similar to finding binary systems of&hellip;</p>
<p>Of black holes.</p>
<p>Well, they were once stars. So we haven&rsquo;t said what a black hole is physically yet.</p>
<p>Yeah. What&rsquo;s a black hole?</p>
<p>So black hole is first, it&rsquo;s a mathematical concept or a physical concept. And that is</p>
<p>a region of space. So it&rsquo;s simply a region of space where the curvature of space time,</p>
<p>meaning the gravitational field is so strong that nothing can get out, including light.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s light gets bent if the space time is warped enough.</p>
<p>And so even light gets bent around and stays in it. So that&rsquo;s the concept of a black hole.</p>
<p>And maybe you can make&hellip; So that&rsquo;s a concept that didn&rsquo;t say how they come about.</p>
<p>And there could be different ways they come about. The ones that we are seeing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not sure. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to learn now is what they&hellip;</p>
<p>But the general expectation is that they come&hellip; These black holes happen when a star dies.</p>
<p>So what does that mean that a star dies? What happens? A star like our sun</p>
<p>basically makes heat and light by fusion. It&rsquo;s made up. And as it burns, it burns up the hydrogen</p>
<p>and then the helium and slowly works its way up to the heavier and heavier elements that are</p>
<p>in the star. And when it gets up to iron, the fusion process doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>
<p>And so the stars die and that happens to stars. And then they do what&rsquo;s called a supernova.</p>
<p>What happens then is that a star is a delicate balance between an outward pressure from fusion</p>
<p>and light and burning and an inward pressure of gravity trying to pull the</p>
<p>masses together. Once it burns itself out, it goes and it collapses and that&rsquo;s a supernova.</p>
<p>When it collapses, all the mass that was there is in a very much smaller space. And if a star,</p>
<p>if you do the calculations, if a star is big enough, that can create a strong enough</p>
<p>gravitational field to make a black hole. Our sun won&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s too small.</p>
<p>Too small.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know exactly what, but it&rsquo;s usually thought that a star has to be at least three</p>
<p>times as big as our sun to make a black hole. But that&rsquo;s the physical way there.</p>
<p>You can make black holes. That&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>explanation that one would give for what we see,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not necessarily true. We&rsquo;re not sure yet.</p>
<p>What we see in terms of, for the origins of black holes?</p>
<p>No, the black holes that we see in gravitational waves.</p>
<p>So the, but you&rsquo;re also looking for the ones who are binary solar systems.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re binary systems, but they could have been made from binary stars. So there&rsquo;s binary</p>
<p>stars around. So that&rsquo;s, so that&rsquo;s the first explanation is that that&rsquo;s what they are.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Other explanations, but what we see has some puzzles. This is kind of the way science works,</p>
<p>I guess. We see heavier ones than up to, we&rsquo;ve seen one system that was 140 times the mass of</p>
<p>our own sun. That&rsquo;s not believed to be possible with the parent being a big star because big</p>
<p>stars can only be so big or they are unstable. It&rsquo;s just the fact that they live in an environment</p>
<p>that makes them unstable. So the fact that we see bigger ones, they may be come from something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that they were made in a different way by little ones eating each other up or maybe</p>
<p>they were made or maybe they came with the big bang. The prime, what we call primordial, which</p>
<p>means they&rsquo;re really different. They came from that. We don&rsquo;t know at this point if they came</p>
<p>with a big bang, then maybe they account for what we call dark matter or some of it.</p>
<p>Hmm. Like there was a lot of them if they came with it because there&rsquo;s a lot of dark matter.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But will gravitational waves give you any kind of intuition about the origin of these oscillating?</p>
<p>We think that if we see the distributions enough of them, the distributions of their</p>
<p>masses, the distributions of how they&rsquo;re spinning, so we can actually measure when they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>around each other, whether they&rsquo;re spinning like this or whether the whole system has any wobbles.</p>
<p>What? So this is now. Okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re constantly kind of crawling back and back in time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re crawling back in time and seeing how many there are as we go back. And so do they</p>
<p>point back.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like, what is that discipline called, cartography or something? You&rsquo;re like mapping</p>
<p>this, the early universe via the lens of gravitational waves.</p>
<p>Not yet the early universe, but at least back in time.</p>
<p>Earlier.</p>
<p>Yeah. So black holes are this mathematical phenomenon, but they come about in different</p>
<p>ways. We have a huge black hole at the center of our galaxy and other galaxies. Those probably</p>
<p>were made some other way. We don&rsquo;t know when the galaxies themselves had to do with the</p>
<p>formation of galaxies. We don&rsquo;t really know. So the fact that we use the word black hole,</p>
<p>the origin of black holes might be quite different depending on how they happen. They just have</p>
<p>to in the end have a gravitational field that will bend everything in.</p>
<p>How do you feel about black holes as a human being? There&rsquo;s this thing that&rsquo;s nearly</p>
<p>infinitely dense, doesn&rsquo;t let light escape. Isn&rsquo;t that kind of terrifying? It feels like</p>
<p>the stuff in nightmares.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an opportunity.</p>
<p>To do what exactly?</p>
<p>So like the early universe is an opportunity. If we can study the early universe, we can</p>
<p>learn things like I told you. And here again, we have an embarrassing situation in physics.</p>
<p>We have two wonderful theories of physics, one based on quantum mechanics, quantum field</p>
<p>theory. And we can go to a big accelerator like at CERN and smash particles together</p>
<p>and almost explain anything that happens beautifully using quantum field theory and</p>
<p>quantum mechanics. Then we have another theory of physics called general relativity, which</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;ve been talking about most of the time, which is fantastic at describing the</p>
<p>things at high velocities, long distances, and so forth. So that&rsquo;s not the way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to be. We&rsquo;re trying to create a theory of physics, not two theories of physics.</p>
<p>So we have an embarrassment that we have two different theories of physics. People have</p>
<p>tried to make a unified theory, what they call a unified theory. You&rsquo;ve heard those</p>
<p>words for decades. They still haven&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s been primarily done theoretically or tried.</p>
<p>People actively do that. My personal belief is that like much of physics, we need some</p>
<p>clues. So we need some experimental evidence. So where is there a place? If we go to CERN</p>
<p>and do those experiments, gravitational waves or general relativity don&rsquo;t matter. If we</p>
<p>go to study our black holes, elementary particle physics doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;re studying these</p>
<p>huge objects. So where might we have a place where both phenomena have to be satisfied?</p>
<p>An example is black holes. Inside black holes. Yeah. So we can&rsquo;t do that today. But when</p>
<p>I think of black hole, it&rsquo;s a potential treasure chest of understanding the fundamental problems</p>
<p>of physics and maybe can give us clues to how we bring to the embarrassment of having</p>
<p>two theories of physics together. That&rsquo;s my own romantic idea. What&rsquo;s the worst that could</p>
<p>happen? It&rsquo;s so enticing. Just go in and look. Do you think, how far are we away from</p>
<p>figuring out the unified theory of physics, the theory of everything? What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>Who will solve it? Like what discipline will solve it? Yeah. I think so little progress</p>
<p>has been made without more experimental clues, as I said, that we&rsquo;re just not able to say</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re close without some clues. The most popular theory these days that might lead</p>
<p>to that is called string theory. The problem with string theory is it solves a lot of beautiful</p>
<p>mathematical problems we have in physics. It&rsquo;s very satisfying theoretically, but it</p>
<p>has almost no predictive, maybe no predictive ability because it is a theory that works</p>
<p>in 11 dimensions. We live in a physical world of three space and one time dimension. In</p>
<p>order to make predictions in our world with string theory, you have to somehow get rid</p>
<p>of these other seven dimensions. That&rsquo;s done mathematically by saying they curl up on each</p>
<p>other on scales that are too small to affect anything here. That&rsquo;s an okay argument, but</p>
<p>how you do that is not unique. That means if I start with that theory and I go to our</p>
<p>world here, I can&rsquo;t uniquely go to it. And if I can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not predictive. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually a killer. That&rsquo;s a killer. And string theory is, it seems like from my outsider&rsquo;s</p>
<p>perspective has lost favor over the years, perhaps because of this very idea. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lack of predictive power. I mean, that science has to connect to something where you make</p>
<p>predictions as beautiful as it might be. So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re close. I think we need</p>
<p>some experimental clues. It may be that information on something we don&rsquo;t understand presently</p>
<p>at all, like dark energy or probably not dark matter, but dark energy or something might</p>
<p>give us some ideas. But I can&rsquo;t envision right now in the short term, meaning the horizon</p>
<p>that we can see how we&rsquo;re going to bring these two theories together.</p>
<p>A kind of a two part question, maybe just asking the same thing in two different ways.</p>
<p>One question is, do you have hope that humans will colonize the galaxy? So expand out, become</p>
<p>a multi planetary species. Another way of asking that from a gravitational and a propulsion</p>
<p>perspective, do you think we&rsquo;ll come up with ways to travel closer to the speed of light</p>
<p>or maybe faster than the speed of light, which would make it a whole heck of a lot easier</p>
<p>to expand out into the universe?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I think that&rsquo;s very futuristic. I think we&rsquo;re not that far from being able</p>
<p>to make a one way trip to Mars. That&rsquo;s then a question of whether people are willing to</p>
<p>send somebody on a one way trip.</p>
<p>Oh, I think they are. There&rsquo;s a lot of the explorers burned bright within our hearts.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people willing to die for the opportunity to explore new territory.</p>
<p>So this recent landing on Mars is pretty impressive. They have a little helicopter. They&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to fly around. You can imagine in the not too distant future that you could have, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think civilizations colonizing, I can envision, but I can envision something more</p>
<p>like the South Pole. We haven&rsquo;t colonized Antarctica because it&rsquo;s all ice and cold and</p>
<p>so forth. But we have stations. So we have a station that&rsquo;s self sustaining at the South</p>
<p>Pole. I&rsquo;ve been there. It has.</p>
<p>Wow, really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that like? Because there&rsquo;s parallels there to go to Mars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the journey like?</p>
<p>The journey involves going. The South Pole station is run in the US by the National Science</p>
<p>Foundation. I went because I was on the National Science Board that runs the National Science</p>
<p>Foundation. And so you get a VIP trip if you&rsquo;re healthy enough to the South Pole to see it,</p>
<p>which I took. You fly from the US to Australia to Christchurch in Southern Australia. And</p>
<p>from there you fly to McMurdo Station, which is on the coast. And it&rsquo;s the station with</p>
<p>about a thousand people right on the coast of Antarctica. It&rsquo;s about a seven or eight</p>
<p>hour flight and they can&rsquo;t predict the weather. So when I flew from Christchurch to McMurdo</p>
<p>Station, they tell you in advance, you do it in a military aircraft, they tell you in</p>
<p>advance that they can&rsquo;t predict whether they can land because they have to land on ice.</p>
<p>And reassuring.</p>
<p>Yeah. And so about halfway the pilot got on and said, sorry, this is a, they call it a</p>
<p>boomerang flight. You know, boomerang goes out and goes back. So we had to stay a little</p>
<p>while in Christchurch, but then we eventually went to McMurdo Station and then flew to the</p>
<p>South Pole. The South Pole itself is, when I was there, it was minus 51 degrees. That</p>
<p>was summer. Zero humidity. And it&rsquo;s about 11,000 feet altitude because it&rsquo;s never warm</p>
<p>enough for anything to melt. So it doesn&rsquo;t snow very much, but it&rsquo;s about 11,000 feet</p>
<p>of snowpack. So you land in a place that&rsquo;s high altitude, cold as could be, and incredibly</p>
<p>dry, which means you have a physical adjustment. The place itself is fantastic. They have this</p>
<p>great station there. They do astronomy at the South Pole. Nature wise, is it beautiful?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the experience like? Or is it like visiting any town? No, it&rsquo;s very small. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only less than a hundred people there. Even when I was there, there were about 50 or 60</p>
<p>there. And in the winter, there&rsquo;s less, half of that. Their winter. Yeah. It gets real</p>
<p>cold. It gets really cold, yeah. But it&rsquo;s a station. And I think, and that&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t gone beyond that. On the coast of Antarctica, they have greenhouses and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>self sustaining in McMurdo Station, but we haven&rsquo;t really settled more than that kind</p>
<p>of thing in Antarctica, which is a big country or a big plot, a big piece of land. So I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t envision kind of colonizing at people living so much, as much as I can see the equivalent</p>
<p>of the South Pole Station. Well, in the computing world, there&rsquo;s an idea of backing up your</p>
<p>data and then you want to do offsite backup, to make sure that if the whole thing burns,</p>
<p>if your whole house burns down, that you can have a backup offsite of the data. I think</p>
<p>the difference between Antarctica and Mars is Mars is an offsite backup. That if we have</p>
<p>nuclear war, whatever the heck might happen here on earth, it&rsquo;d be nice to have a backup</p>
<p>elsewhere. And it&rsquo;d be nice to have a large enough colony where we sent a variety of people</p>
<p>except a few silly astronauts in suits, have an actual vibrant, get a few musicians and</p>
<p>artists up there, get a few, maybe like one or two computer scientists, those are essential.</p>
<p>Maybe even a physicist, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe not. So that comes back to something you talked about earlier, which is the paradox,</p>
<p>Fermi&rsquo;s paradox, because you talked about having to escape. And so one number you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to use in Fermi&rsquo;s calculation or Drake, who&rsquo;s done it better, is how long do</p>
<p>civilizations last? We&rsquo;ve barely gotten to where we can communicate with electricity</p>
<p>and magnetism and maybe we&rsquo;ll wipe ourselves out pretty soon.</p>
<p>Are you hopeful in general? Like you think we&rsquo;ve got another couple of hundred years</p>
<p>at least? Or are you worried?</p>
<p>Well, no, I&rsquo;m hopeful, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m hopeful in the longterm. If you say, are</p>
<p>we able to go for another couple of thousand years? I&rsquo;m not sure. I think we have where</p>
<p>we started, the fact that we can do things that don&rsquo;t allow us to kind of keep going</p>
<p>or there can be, whether it ends up being a virus that we create or ends up being the</p>
<p>equivalent of nuclear war or something else. It&rsquo;s not clear that we can control things</p>
<p>well enough.</p>
<p>So speaking of really cold conditions and not being hopeful and eventual suffering and</p>
<p>destruction of the human species, let me ask you about Russian literature. You mentioned,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s that for transition? I&rsquo;m doing my best here. You mentioned that you used to love</p>
<p>literature when you were younger and you even were hoping to be a writer yourself. That</p>
<p>was the motivation. And some of the books I&rsquo;ve seen that you listed that were inspiring</p>
<p>to you was from Russian literature, like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn. Maybe in general</p>
<p>you can speak to your fascination with Russian literature or in general what you picked up</p>
<p>from those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised you picked up on the Russian literature, your background, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You should be surprised I didn&rsquo;t make the entire conversation about this. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>real surprise.</p>
<p>Yeah. When I didn&rsquo;t really become a physicist or want to go in science until I started college.</p>
<p>So when I was younger, I was good at math and that kind of stuff, but I didn&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I came from a family, nobody went to college and I didn&rsquo;t have any mentors. But I liked</p>
<p>to read when I was really young. And so when I was very young, I always carried around</p>
<p>a pocket book and read it. And my mother read these mystery stories and I got bored by those</p>
<p>eventually. And then I discovered real literature. I don&rsquo;t know what age, but about 12 or 13.</p>
<p>And so then I started reading good literature and there&rsquo;s nothing better than Russian literature,</p>
<p>of course.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Reading good literature. So I read quite a bit of Russian literature at that time. And</p>
<p>so you asked me about, well, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ll say a few words, Dostoevsky. So what</p>
<p>about Dostoevsky? For me, Dostoevsky was important in two, I mean, I&rsquo;ve read a lot of literature</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of the other thing I do with my life. And he made two incredible,</p>
<p>in addition to his own literature, he influenced literature tremendously by having, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to pronounce polyphony. So he&rsquo;s the first real serious author that had multiple</p>
<p>narrators. And he absolutely is the first. And he also was the first, he began existential</p>
<p>literature. So the most important book that I&rsquo;ve read in the last year when I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>forced to be isolated was existential literature. I decided to reread Camus, The Plague.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. That&rsquo;s a great book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great book and it&rsquo;s right now to read it. It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I think that book is about love, actually. Love for humanity.</p>
<p>It is, but it has all the, if you haven&rsquo;t read it in recent years, I had read it before,</p>
<p>of course, but to read it during this, because it&rsquo;s about a plague. So it&rsquo;s really fantastic</p>
<p>to read down. But that reminds me of, he was a great existentialist, but the beginning</p>
<p>of existential literature was Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>Dostoevsky, yeah.</p>
<p>So in addition to his own great novels, he had a tremendous impact on literature.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also for Dostoevsky, unlike most other existentialists, he was at least in</p>
<p>part religious. I mean, religiosity permeated his idea. I mean, one of my favorite books</p>
<p>of his is The Idiot, which is a Christlike figure in there.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s Prince Mishkin, is that his name?</p>
<p>Prince Mishkin, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, Mishkin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing about, you read it in English, I presume.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. So the names, that&rsquo;s what gets a lot of people. There&rsquo;s so many names, so hard</p>
<p>to pronounce. You have to remember all of them. It&rsquo;s like you have the same problem.</p>
<p>But he was a great character.</p>
<p>I kind of have a connection with him, because I often, the title of the book, The Idiot,</p>
<p>is I kind of, I often call myself an idiot, because that&rsquo;s how I feel. I feel so naive</p>
<p>about this world. And I&rsquo;m not sure, I&rsquo;m not sure why that is. Maybe it&rsquo;s genetic or so</p>
<p>on. But I have a connection, a spiritual connection to that character.</p>
<p>To Mishkin.</p>
<p>To Mishkin, yeah.</p>
<p>But he was far from an idiot.</p>
<p>No, in some sense, in some sense. But in another sense, maybe not of this world.</p>
<p>In another sense he was. I mean, he was a bumbler, a bunker.</p>
<p>But you also mentioned Solzhenitsyn, very interesting.</p>
<p>And he always confused me. Of course, he was really, really important in writing about</p>
<p>Stalin, and first getting in trouble, and then later he wrote about Stalin in a way,</p>
<p>I forget what the book was, in a way that was very critical of Lenin.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s evolved through the years, and he actually showed support for Putin eventually.</p>
<p>It was a very interesting transition he took, no, journey he took through thinking about</p>
<p>Russia and the Soviet Union. But I think what I get from him is basic, it&rsquo;s like Viktor</p>
<p>has this man&rsquo;s search for meaning. I have a similar kind of sense of the cruelty of</p>
<p>human nature, cruelty of indifference, but also the ability to find happiness in the</p>
<p>small joys of life. That&rsquo;s something, there&rsquo;s nothing like a prison camp that makes you</p>
<p>realize you could still be happy with a very, very little.</p>
<p>Yeah, his description of how to go through a day and actually enjoy it in a prison camp</p>
<p>is pretty amazing. And some prison camp, it&rsquo;s the worst of the worst.</p>
<p>And also, I do think about the role of authoritarian states in hopeful idealistic systems somehow</p>
<p>leading to the suffering of millions. And this might be arguable, but I think a lot</p>
<p>of people believe that Stalin, I think, genuinely believed that he&rsquo;s doing good for the world.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a very valuable lesson that even evil people think they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>good. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s too difficult to do the evil. The best way to do evil is to believe</p>
<p>about framing it in a way like you&rsquo;re doing good. And then this is a very clear picture</p>
<p>of that, which is the gulags. And Solzhenitsyn is one of the best people to reveal that.</p>
<p>The most recent thing I read, it isn&rsquo;t actually fiction, was the woman, I can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>her name, who got the Nobel Prize about within the last five years. I don&rsquo;t know whether</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s Ukrainian or Russian, but there are interviews. Have you read that?</p>
<p>Interview of Ukrainian survivors of&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I think she may be originally Ukrainian. The book&rsquo;s written in Russian and translated</p>
<p>in English, and many of the interviews are in Moscow and places. But she won the Nobel</p>
<p>Prize within the last five years or so. But what&rsquo;s interesting is that these are people</p>
<p>of all different ages, all different occupations and so forth, and they&rsquo;re reflecting on their</p>
<p>reaction to basically the present Soviet system, the system they lived with before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of looking back by a lot of them with, well, it being much better before.</p>
<p>Yeah. I don&rsquo;t know what&hellip; In America, we think we know the right answer, what it means</p>
<p>to be, to build a better world. I&rsquo;m not so sure. I think we&rsquo;re all just trying to figure</p>
<p>it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing our best.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give to young people today, besides reading Russian literature</p>
<p>at a young age, about how to find their way in life, how to find success in Korea or just</p>
<p>life in general?</p>
<p>My own belief, it may not be very deep, but I believe it. I think you should follow your</p>
<p>dreams and you should have dreams and follow your dreams if you can, to the extent that</p>
<p>you can. And we spend a lot of our time doing something with ourselves. In my case, physics,</p>
<p>in your case, I don&rsquo;t know, whatever it is, machine learning and this. Yeah, you should</p>
<p>have fun.</p>
<p>What was&hellip; Wait, wait, wait. Follow your dreams. What dream did you have? Because there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, originally, I was&hellip;</p>
<p>Because you didn&rsquo;t follow your dream. I thought you were supposed to be a writer.</p>
<p>I changed along the way. I was gonna be, but I changed.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>That was&hellip; What happened? Oh, I read&hellip; I decided to take the most serious literature</p>
<p>course in my high school, which was a mistake. I&rsquo;d probably be a second rate writer now.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Could be a Nobel Prize winning writer.</p>
<p>And the book that we read, even though I had read Russian novels, I was 15, I think, cured</p>
<p>me from being a novelist.</p>
<p>Destroyed your dream?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Cured you. Okay. What was the book?</p>
<p>Moby Dick.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, why Moby Dick?</p>
<p>Yeah, why?</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve read it since, and it&rsquo;s a great novel. Maybe it&rsquo;s as good as the Russian novels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never made it through. It was too boring. It was too long.</p>
<p>Okay. Your words are gonna mesh with what I say.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>And you may have the same problem at older ages.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not a writer.</p>
<p>It may be. So, the problem is, Moby Dick is&hellip; What I remember was there was a chapter that</p>
<p>was maybe 100 pages long, all describing this, why there was Ahab and the white whale, and</p>
<p>it was the battle between Ahab with his wooden peg leg and the white whale.</p>
<p>And there was a chapter that was 100 pages long in my memory, I don&rsquo;t know how long it</p>
<p>really was, that described in detail, though, great white whale and what he was doing and</p>
<p>what his fins were like and this and that.</p>
<p>And it was so incredibly boring, the word you used, that I thought, if this is great</p>
<p>literature, screw it.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>Okay. And now, why did I have a problem? I know now in reflection, because I still read</p>
<p>a lot, and I read that novel after I was 30 or 40 years old, and the problem was simple.</p>
<p>I diagnosed what the problem was. That novel, in contrast to the Russian novels, which are</p>
<p>very realistic and point of view, is one huge metaphor.</p>
<p>At 15 years old, I probably didn&rsquo;t know the word, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t know the meaning</p>
<p>of metaphor.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, why do I care about a fish? Why are you telling me all about this fish?</p>
<p>Exactly. It&rsquo;s one big metaphor. So, reading it later as a metaphor, I could really enjoy</p>
<p>it. But the teacher gave me the wrong book, or maybe it was the right book because I went</p>
<p>into physics. But it was truly, I think, I may oversimplify, but it was really that I</p>
<p>was too young to read that book. Not too young to read the Russian novels, interestingly,</p>
<p>but too young to read that because I probably didn&rsquo;t even know the word, and I certainly</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t understand it as a metaphor.</p>
<p>Well, in terms of fish, I recommend people read Old Man and the Sea, much shorter, much</p>
<p>better. It&rsquo;s still a metaphor, though. But you can read it just as a story about a guy</p>
<p>catching a fish, and it&rsquo;s still fun to read. I had the same experience as you, not with</p>
<p>Moby Dick, but later in college, I took a course on James Joyce. Don&rsquo;t ask me why. I</p>
<p>was majoring in computer science, I took a course on James Joyce. And I was kept being</p>
<p>told that he is widely considered, by many considered, to be the greatest literary writer</p>
<p>of the 20th century. And I kept reading, I think, so his short story is The Dead, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called. It was very good. Well, not very good, but pretty good. And then Ulysses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually very good.</p>
<p>It is very good. Only The Dead, the final story, it still rings with me today. But then</p>
<p>Ulysses was, I got through Ulysses with the help of some Cliff Notes and so on. And so</p>
<p>I did Ulysses and then Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake. The moment I started Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake, I said,</p>
<p>this is stupid. That&rsquo;s when I went full into like, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s when I went full</p>
<p>Kafka, Bukowski, like people who just talk about the darkness of the human condition</p>
<p>in the fewest words possible and without any of the music of language. So it was a turning</p>
<p>point as well. I wonder when is the right time to appreciate the beauty of language.</p>
<p>Like even Shakespeare. I was very much off put by Shakespeare in high school and only</p>
<p>later I started to appreciate its value in the same way. Let me ask you a ridiculous</p>
<p>question. Okay. I mean, because you&rsquo;ve read Russian literature, let me ask this one last</p>
<p>question. I might be lying. There might be a couple more, but what do you think is the</p>
<p>meaning of this whole thing? You got a Nobel prize for looking out into the, trying to</p>
<p>reach back into the beginning of the universe, listening to the gravitational waves, but</p>
<p>that still doesn&rsquo;t answer the why. Why are we here? Beyond just the matter and anti matter,</p>
<p>the philosophical question.</p>
<p>The philosophical question about the meaning of life, I&rsquo;m probably not really good at.</p>
<p>I think that the individual meaning, I would say it rather simplistically is whether you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>made a difference, a positive difference, I&rsquo;d say for anything besides yourself. Meaning</p>
<p>you could have been important to other people or you could have discovered gravitational</p>
<p>waves that matters to other people or something, but something beyond just existing on the</p>
<p>earth as an individual. So your life has meaning if you have affected either knowledge or people</p>
<p>or something beyond yourself. It&rsquo;s a simplistic statement, but it&rsquo;s about as good as I can</p>
<p>say. In all of its simplicity, it may be very true. Does it make you sad that this ride</p>
<p>ends? Do you think about your mortality? Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>Not exactly afraid of it, but saddened by it. I&rsquo;m old enough to know that I&rsquo;ve lived</p>
<p>most of my life and I enjoy being alive. I can imagine being sick and not wanting to</p>
<p>be alive, but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good ride.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not happy to see it come to an end. I&rsquo;d like to see it prolong, but I don&rsquo;t fear the</p>
<p>dying itself or that kind of thing. It&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;d like to prolong what is I think a good</p>
<p>life that I&rsquo;m living and still living.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad to think that the finiteness of it is the thing that makes it special. And also</p>
<p>sad to me, at least it&rsquo;s kind of, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m using too strong of a word, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of terrifying the uncertainty of it. The mystery of it, the mystery of death.</p>
<p>The mystery of it, yeah, of death. When we&rsquo;re talking about the mystery of black holes that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>somehow distant, that&rsquo;s somehow out there and the mystery of our own.</p>
<p>But even life, the mystery of consciousness, I find so hard to deal with too. I mean, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not as painful. I mean, we&rsquo;re conscious, but the whole magic of life we can understand,</p>
<p>but consciousness where we can actually think and so forth. It&rsquo;s pretty.</p>
<p>It seems like such a beautiful gift that it really sucks that we get to let go of it.</p>
<p>We have to let go of it. What do you hope your legacy is? As I&rsquo;m sure they will. Aliens</p>
<p>when they visit and humans have destroyed all of human civilization. Aliens read about</p>
<p>you in an encyclopedia that we&rsquo;ll leave behind. What do you hope it says?</p>
<p>Well, I would hope they, to the extent that they evaluated me, felt that I helped move</p>
<p>science forward as a tangible contribution and that I served as a good role model for</p>
<p>how humans should live their lives.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re part of creating one of the most incredible things humans have ever created.</p>
<p>So yes, there&rsquo;s the science. That&rsquo;s the Fermi thing, right?</p>
<p>And the instrument, I guess.</p>
<p>And the instrument. The instrument is a magical creation, not just by a human, by a collection</p>
<p>of humans. The collaboration is, that&rsquo;s humanity at its best. I do hope we last quite a bit</p>
<p>longer, but if we don&rsquo;t, this is a good thing to remember humans by. At least they built</p>
<p>that thing. That&rsquo;s pretty impressive. Barry, this is an amazing conversation. Thank you</p>
<p>so much for wasting your time and explaining so many things so well. I appreciate your</p>
<p>time today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Barry Barish. To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from</p>
<p>Werner Heisenberg, a theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Not only is the universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think. Thank</p>
<p>you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
