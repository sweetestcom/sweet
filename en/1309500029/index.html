    <p>hi friends how are you today my name is Bailey</p>
<p>Syrian and today is Monday which means it&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>Mystery and makeup Monday</p>
<p>if you are new here hi</p>
<p>my name is Bailey</p>
<p>Sarian and on</p>
<p>Mondays I sit down and I talk about a true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>heavy on my</p>
<p>again and I do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>so before we jump into this</p>
<p>story I should add up disclaimer warning</p>
<p>The following presentation is intended for</p>
<p>mature audiences it contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions of crime scenes</p>
<p>adult dialogue and</p>
<p>strong language viewer discretion is advised</p>
<p>so today&rsquo;s story is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not weird it&rsquo;s just like I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand people I don&rsquo;t think I will ever</p>
<p>understand people do you</p>
<p>understand people no</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think so like what the hell is</p>
<p>going on sometimes you know but let&rsquo;s get into</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>Bobby Joe Stinette you know her</p>
<p>do you know the</p>
<p>story well let me tell you</p>
<p>she grew up in Graham</p>
<p>Missouri now it was said that she was</p>
<p>quiet she was</p>
<p>super kind she was a really good student</p>
<p>and she had a love of</p>
<p>horses and dogs</p>
<p>she and her husband who went by the name Zeb</p>
<p>his real name was</p>
<p>Zebulan they were high</p>
<p>school sweethearts and both of them had</p>
<p>graduated from I&rsquo;m gonna butcher this nod away Holt</p>
<p>high school in 2000 anywho</p>
<p>so at the age of 23</p>
<p>Bobby Joe she was 8</p>
<p>months pregnant and this was gonna be</p>
<p>their first</p>
<p>child so both of them they&rsquo;re living in this like</p>
<p>tiny farming town called</p>
<p>skidmore Missouri</p>
<p>now Skidmore had like one restaurant</p>
<p>a few streets are paved and they have a</p>
<p>population around</p>
<p>250 people yeah it&rsquo;s small</p>
<p>and Bobby Joe</p>
<p>and everyone in the community they all knew each other</p>
<p>so Bobby Joe she worked at the Kawasaki manufacturing</p>
<p>plant and that was in the nearby town of Maryville</p>
<p>she and Zeb</p>
<p>they also ran a dog</p>
<p>breeding business called</p>
<p>Happy Haven Farms out of</p>
<p>their home so on December 15th</p>
<p>2004 She met a woman</p>
<p>named Darlene Fisher</p>
<p>in an online chat room it was like a rat</p>
<p>terror carrier</p>
<p>chat room the chat room was called radder chatter so</p>
<p>Darlene and</p>
<p>Bobby Joe they were chatting</p>
<p>on radder chatter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>funny but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like a sad</p>
<p>story but like radder chatter so Darlene</p>
<p>was interested</p>
<p>in possibly buying a terrier</p>
<p>puppy from their most recent litter</p>
<p>so Bobby Joe gave Darlene her address</p>
<p>and they coordinated a time that they were</p>
<p>going to meet</p>
<p>for Darlene to come over the next day so they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>excited not really but like you know</p>
<p>so on the 16th</p>
<p>Bobby joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother her name was</p>
<p>Becky Harper</p>
<p>she stopped by her daughter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house to like</p>
<p>check in on her and she walks in and she finds her</p>
<p>daughter lying on the dining room</p>
<p>floor in a pool of her own blood okay</p>
<p>Bobby Joe was dead</p>
<p>Becky immediately calls</p>
<p>the police and she&rsquo;s just hysterical</p>
<p>she described her</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s wounds as looking as if her stomach exploded</p>
<p>paramedics were unsuccessful in</p>
<p>their attempts to revive</p>
<p>Bobby Joe and she was pronounced</p>
<p>dead at St Francis Hospital</p>
<p>in Maryville</p>
<p>so an amber</p>
<p>alert was set out</p>
<p>for a red Toyota Corolla that was seen</p>
<p>in the driveway</p>
<p>of Bobby joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and it was</p>
<p>issued out in hopes of</p>
<p>of enlisting help from the general public</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re asking the general public</p>
<p>we need your help finding this car and</p>
<p>initially the amber</p>
<p>alert was denied because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been used before</p>
<p>in the case of an unborn</p>
<p>child remember</p>
<p>Bobby Joe was pregnant</p>
<p>and when she was</p>
<p>found the baby was missing</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re sending out this amber</p>
<p>alert but there&rsquo;s no description</p>
<p>of the victim that&rsquo;s missing the baby I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been done before</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do you know what I&rsquo;m saying does that make</p>
<p>sense I hope that makes sense</p>
<p>but they put one out congressman</p>
<p>Sam Graves intervened</p>
<p>and the alert request was</p>
<p>granted so they did</p>
<p>send it out in hopes that somebody had some information</p>
<p>as to at least like had</p>
<p>had anyone seen this car baby&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what the baby looks like but</p>
<p>I know like how do you even</p>
<p>solve this I don&rsquo;t know I</p>
<p>guess like did anyone show up</p>
<p>randomly with a baby</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have a baby</p>
<p>I guess that</p>
<p>would be the biggest clue</p>
<p>this is something of like your</p>
<p>worst nightmares I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry but it is</p>
<p>to be pregnant</p>
<p>and to have somebody not</p>
<p>only murder you</p>
<p>but take your unborn</p>
<p>child like why in the</p>
<p>world what I just can&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people out there like this this to me is just like my</p>
<p>brain cannot compute this</p>
<p>it just can&rsquo;t it just really can&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know anyways</p>
<p>so back at the</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>there was no sign</p>
<p>of forced entry</p>
<p>this told investigators that</p>
<p>Bobby Joe she most likely knew her attacker</p>
<p>whoever it was she let them in</p>
<p>and then there was also evidence</p>
<p>that a gruesome and violent struggle had</p>
<p>taken place so she let the person in</p>
<p>but things just</p>
<p>got real bad</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it was clear that</p>
<p>Bobby Joe had been</p>
<p>strangled from behind and then she fell</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>blood on Bobby joe&rsquo;s feet indicated that she at some</p>
<p>point regained consciousness after</p>
<p>her her stomach had been</p>
<p>cut open I know</p>
<p>sorry kind of graphic</p>
<p>so there was enough</p>
<p>blood on the</p>
<p>floor to come up between her toes</p>
<p>and soak into her toenails they also</p>
<p>found like blondish</p>
<p>brown hair in her closed face</p>
<p>indicating that</p>
<p>Bobby Joe put up like a pretty good</p>
<p>fight against her attacker</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before in a previous</p>
<p>video not that I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>Jesus or something</p>
<p>but I pray to whatever you believe in</p>
<p>this never happens to you</p>
<p>right none of us</p>
<p>what if somebody&rsquo;s attacking you this is so</p>
<p>awful but like</p>
<p>maybe if you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get out make sure</p>
<p>to scratch and to</p>
<p>fight your attacker and get</p>
<p>their DNA under your</p>
<p>nails I&rsquo;m talking just</p>
<p>claw their shirt</p>
<p>under them and get</p>
<p>their DNA under your</p>
<p>nails because if</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>found with the DNA that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>about to scratch off of you okay so again</p>
<p>I pray that this</p>
<p>never happens to you</p>
<p>right but scratch the shit out of people attackers</p>
<p>okay so yeah she put up a</p>
<p>fight she got hair</p>
<p>the attacker&rsquo;s hair so like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I guess anyways</p>
<p>Bobby Joe also had cuts on her hands</p>
<p>which was from defending herself</p>
<p>and then she was also hit on the bridge of her nose</p>
<p>and the right side of her head</p>
<p>during the struggle eventually</p>
<p>Bobby joe&rsquo;s attacker got the better of her</p>
<p>strangling her</p>
<p>to death before extracting and making off with</p>
<p>Bobby joe&rsquo;s premature baby I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the hell is</p>
<p>going on around here terrifying</p>
<p>um so notaway</p>
<p>County Sheriff</p>
<p>Randy Strong</p>
<p>said that the</p>
<p>scene they found that day was so bloody</p>
<p>he and his 4</p>
<p>colleagues are</p>
<p>still traumatized</p>
<p>by it to this day</p>
<p>can I ask something that I always forget to Google</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always been curious</p>
<p>for anyone out there who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>detective or something and sees</p>
<p>these really</p>
<p>awful crime</p>
<p>scenes do they offer you guys</p>
<p>like therapy and</p>
<p>stuff or do they</p>
<p>or do they not</p>
<p>I really hope they do I would</p>
<p>think they would but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have a lot of</p>
<p>faith in the</p>
<p>system taking care of their</p>
<p>employees but</p>
<p>I could be wrong</p>
<p>but I hope they do</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t know how you</p>
<p>could just be normal</p>
<p>after seeing all this</p>
<p>stuff do you know what I&rsquo;m saying anyways</p>
<p>so of course</p>
<p>word over on the Radder Chatter</p>
<p>forum about</p>
<p>Bobby joe&rsquo;s brutal murder was</p>
<p>spreading like wildfire people were talking</p>
<p>were rather chattering it up</p>
<p>one of the members actually came forward and contacted</p>
<p>the police because they remembered the day before</p>
<p>the murder a woman</p>
<p>named Darlene</p>
<p>had contacted Bobby Joe</p>
<p>about buying a</p>
<p>puppy I mean what are the odds</p>
<p>you know so luckily this person did the right</p>
<p>thing so this</p>
<p>woman had come forward</p>
<p>and given police the information</p>
<p>about Darlene</p>
<p>good for her you know</p>
<p>with this information police</p>
<p>quickly tracked darlene&rsquo;s IP address</p>
<p>to a home out in Melbourne</p>
<p>Kansas that belonged to Lisa</p>
<p>and Kevin Montgomery</p>
<p>Bobby Joe and Lisa met</p>
<p>earlier that</p>
<p>April through dog show events</p>
<p>and they connected</p>
<p>through a shared</p>
<p>love of dogs</p>
<p>they have like ongoing interactions</p>
<p>in the same</p>
<p>online rat terrier chat room ratter chatter</p>
<p>Lisa had confided</p>
<p>to Bobby Joe</p>
<p>that she too was pregnant</p>
<p>leading the 2</p>
<p>women to like chatting online</p>
<p>and exchanging</p>
<p>emails about</p>
<p>their pregnancies and just really connecting over</p>
<p>their love of animals</p>
<p>and also just being pregnant with</p>
<p>their first</p>
<p>child like you</p>
<p>know bonding</p>
<p>the next day December 17th police went out to Melbourne</p>
<p>hoping to question Lisa</p>
<p>about Bobby Joe</p>
<p>when they arrived they noticed that outside</p>
<p>their farmhouse home was a car that</p>
<p>matched the description</p>
<p>of the one listed on the amber</p>
<p>alert now a red Toyota Corolla is pretty</p>
<p>common but you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still questionable</p>
<p>so they go inside and they find Lisa</p>
<p>just kind of laying around she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching TV</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s holding a baby</p>
<p>named Abigail</p>
<p>and they noticed</p>
<p>that this baby Abigail had a cut over her eye</p>
<p>this psycho ass lady I</p>
<p>swear to you</p>
<p>so Lisa told the police the same</p>
<p>story she told her husband the day before</p>
<p>that she delivered the infant girl at a nearby birthing</p>
<p>center in Topeka</p>
<p>and then that morning her and her husband</p>
<p>7 they went</p>
<p>around town showing off the newborn at a diner</p>
<p>at the local bank at a</p>
<p>courthouse at the convenience</p>
<p>store where Lisa worked</p>
<p>just going on a little</p>
<p>parade like look at this baby we got like it&rsquo;s mine</p>
<p>very bizarre</p>
<p>just I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with people I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know this is a different kind of sick</p>
<p>so when questioned</p>
<p>Kevin admitted</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t there for the</p>
<p>birth of this baby Abigail</p>
<p>Lisa had called him asking</p>
<p>him to pick her up and the baby at Long John silver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in Topeka Kansas</p>
<p>yeah Long John Silvers okay</p>
<p>and that however he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it was strange</p>
<p>because he knew she didn&rsquo;t like hospitals and doctors</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know you guys</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just here telling you a</p>
<p>story but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>freaking know so</p>
<p>later she asked to</p>
<p>speak to officers in private</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want I don&rsquo;t need my husband here he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need to hear this can I talk to you in private</p>
<p>so she tells her husband like go away for a</p>
<p>second I need to talk to them</p>
<p>and she tells the police that she had</p>
<p>actually given</p>
<p>birth to Abigail at home</p>
<p>so it was her baby and</p>
<p>after she gave</p>
<p>birth she took the placenta and she</p>
<p>threw it into a nearby</p>
<p>river because that makes lots of</p>
<p>sense right</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what she had done I</p>
<p>guess that was supposed to be believable</p>
<p>now things of course</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t adding up and they bring</p>
<p>Lisa down to the sheriff&rsquo;s office for more questioning</p>
<p>so they question her for like</p>
<p>an hour or so</p>
<p>and lisa&rsquo;s story just fell</p>
<p>apart and then she confessed</p>
<p>she told them that she had actually driven</p>
<p>the 130 mile trip</p>
<p>as a test run</p>
<p>on the 15th before</p>
<p>traveling back on the 16th</p>
<p>to murder Bobby Joe</p>
<p>Lisa said that she was</p>
<p>using a cord</p>
<p>she strangled</p>
<p>Bobby Joe and having</p>
<p>spent time watching</p>
<p>videos online of like home</p>
<p>births and C section procedures</p>
<p>she felt confident enough</p>
<p>to like use a</p>
<p>sharp kitchen</p>
<p>knife to cut</p>
<p>her baby out</p>
<p>what the hell</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so Lisa obviously was</p>
<p>charged with kidnapping</p>
<p>which resulted in the</p>
<p>death of Bobby Joe</p>
<p>and the baby was safely recovered and returned to Zeb</p>
<p>who renamed her Victoria Joe</p>
<p>so with all this information</p>
<p>who the heck was Lisa</p>
<p>Marie Montgomery</p>
<p>her middle name is</p>
<p>Marie whose middle name is it</p>
<p>Marie everyone&rsquo;s middle name is Marie why</p>
<p>I need to know</p>
<p>but who is Lisa Montgomery</p>
<p>well it turns out she actually has a very sad story it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that she shouldn&rsquo;t be held accountable</p>
<p>for what she did but I</p>
<p>think you know</p>
<p>she had a really</p>
<p>awful life and it makes</p>
<p>sense okay look</p>
<p>the whole like</p>
<p>thing when I do</p>
<p>these videos I like to figure out like</p>
<p>where these killers and bad people come from because I</p>
<p>think it actually makes more</p>
<p>sense as to why they did what they did</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>and a lot of people confuse that with me like trying to</p>
<p>make you feel bad for</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>and like you can&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re allowed to feel bad for</p>
<p>these people but I</p>
<p>think it makes you</p>
<p>understand why they do the</p>
<p>things they</p>
<p>do and that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m always personally curious</p>
<p>like what makes somebody</p>
<p>this freaking</p>
<p>crazy you know</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re not just born like this</p>
<p>where does it come</p>
<p>from and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where I am just so fascinated</p>
<p>when it comes to</p>
<p>these stories</p>
<p>anyways so let me do my eyebrows</p>
<p>okay so who&rsquo;s Lisa well Lisa</p>
<p>she was born</p>
<p>on February 27th 1968</p>
<p>in Melvern Kansas</p>
<p>her mother Judy</p>
<p>to nash&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>Shay I don&rsquo;t even know how to say her last name</p>
<p>snatchers no snake</p>
<p>something like that anyways she was addicted to alcohol</p>
<p>okay which caused</p>
<p>Lisa to be born</p>
<p>with permanent</p>
<p>brain damage</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t drink when you&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>step one thank</p>
<p>you lisa&rsquo;s father was in the military</p>
<p>and he just like wasn&rsquo;t around much</p>
<p>apparently allegedly</p>
<p>Lisa and her half</p>
<p>sister Diane</p>
<p>they were raised in a home</p>
<p>where physical</p>
<p>emotional and</p>
<p>sexual abuse</p>
<p>from Judy and her boyfriends was like an</p>
<p>everyday routine</p>
<p>sadly they were beaten with rooms and belts</p>
<p>and just really</p>
<p>cruel punishments like taking</p>
<p>their mouths</p>
<p>shut or putting them out in the snow</p>
<p>naked or just like normal</p>
<p>things that they did</p>
<p>to their children</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re sick people Diane</p>
<p>later on in life</p>
<p>would describe Judy</p>
<p>as manipulative in just</p>
<p>evil just awful person</p>
<p>she would go on to say that she</p>
<p>enjoyed torturing</p>
<p>the people around her and she got a joy out of it</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how you</p>
<p>could do that I really just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so sad</p>
<p>so at the age of</p>
<p>8 lisa&rsquo;s half</p>
<p>sister Diane</p>
<p>was luckily removed from the home by social services</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>whisked away to foster care</p>
<p>now Lisa at the time was only 4</p>
<p>and she was left behind with her</p>
<p>mother and her stepfather</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure as to why she stayed and the</p>
<p>other one was taken away</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just what happened</p>
<p>his other children</p>
<p>later confirmed that</p>
<p>their father was a violent alcoholic</p>
<p>and Lisa was allegedly beaten</p>
<p>and raped by her stepfather</p>
<p>and also by his friends</p>
<p>starting at the</p>
<p>age of 11 so they</p>
<p>would be like the parents</p>
<p>the grown adults here</p>
<p>would be like come on over I have a</p>
<p>child that you can</p>
<p>take advantage</p>
<p>of and do whatever you want with like how</p>
<p>sick are you</p>
<p>I just I don&rsquo;t get icha</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>so at the age of 13</p>
<p>while living in</p>
<p>Sperry Oklahoma</p>
<p>lisa&rsquo;s stepfather</p>
<p>built a special room in</p>
<p>his trailer</p>
<p>he could attack her privately</p>
<p>yeah he would also</p>
<p>store his liquor there</p>
<p>and Lisa turned</p>
<p>that she would</p>
<p>start drinking alcohol</p>
<p>in hopes to find some kind of escape from it all</p>
<p>so when Lisa was 14 her</p>
<p>mother discovered that the</p>
<p>abuse was going on</p>
<p>now as if the</p>
<p>story cannot get any</p>
<p>worse and I&rsquo;m sorry for</p>
<p>laughing I&rsquo;m just so uncomfortable because her</p>
<p>mother discovers that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s being abused</p>
<p>right her mother</p>
<p>burst into the room</p>
<p>when she&rsquo;s being abused</p>
<p>by her stepfather like during one of the attacks in the</p>
<p>trailer now instead of being like oh my God my</p>
<p>daughter like how</p>
<p>could you do this let me help my</p>
<p>daughter no instead</p>
<p>she threatened Lisa</p>
<p>with the gun</p>
<p>because she believed her mom believed that Lisa</p>
<p>had seduced</p>
<p>her husband</p>
<p>and Lisa was the one to be blamed here</p>
<p>can you will can you</p>
<p>Lisa described it as like the most terrifying</p>
<p>night of her life not only that she just felt extremely</p>
<p>alone because</p>
<p>nobody had her back nobody was looking out for her</p>
<p>how the hell</p>
<p>do you grow up and be a normal person you know and</p>
<p>again I&rsquo;m not trying to excuse what</p>
<p>she does in her life because what she did was awful</p>
<p>should not have</p>
<p>done that but like God this poor girl oh my God I just</p>
<p>wanna like punch</p>
<p>her family in the face</p>
<p>it was also around this time that her mother</p>
<p>started trafficking</p>
<p>her she was</p>
<p>allowing anybody</p>
<p>anybody with</p>
<p>money handymen</p>
<p>electricians plumbers</p>
<p>come on over</p>
<p>sexually abuse my</p>
<p>daughter Lisa in exchange for work on the</p>
<p>house we&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>wires up there I need fixing I don&rsquo;t have any money</p>
<p>but I got a daughter</p>
<p>mother of the goddamn Year award goes to</p>
<p>not her wow</p>
<p>so this is all</p>
<p>going on for a very long time</p>
<p>and Lisa she ends up confiding in her cousin</p>
<p>telling him that men</p>
<p>would tie her up beat her</p>
<p>urinate on her</p>
<p>and for some reason the cousin</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how old the cousin was at the time but the cousin</p>
<p>never did anything</p>
<p>about it and I</p>
<p>think a lot of us kind of can get</p>
<p>angry at that like why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you do anything</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re a kid</p>
<p>not all kids but a lot of kids are like terrified</p>
<p>of the adults in</p>
<p>their life they don&rsquo;t feel confident enough to</p>
<p>speak out you know they don&rsquo;t have like a safe</p>
<p>space to speak out</p>
<p>so I think that&rsquo;s why the cousin didn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>maybe it was happening to them</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so Judy lisa&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>ended up divorcing her</p>
<p>second husband</p>
<p>and Lisa testified about the</p>
<p>sexual assaults during the divorce proceedings</p>
<p>now the judge in the case he went off on Judy</p>
<p>for not reporting the abuse</p>
<p>yet the judge</p>
<p>never reported the</p>
<p>abuse either so there&rsquo;s just a lot of fuck ups</p>
<p>going on right</p>
<p>so at one point Lisa</p>
<p>tried to escape the chaotic home by</p>
<p>marrying her step brother his name was Carl</p>
<p>Bowman in 1986</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>only 18 at the time she saw as like her way out</p>
<p>but the relationship was not the escape that</p>
<p>from violence</p>
<p>like she was hoping it</p>
<p>would be cause this guy was just as bad as all the</p>
<p>other ones so</p>
<p>at 1.1 of lisa&rsquo;s brothers</p>
<p>found a home</p>
<p>movie of Carl raping and beating Lisa</p>
<p>he described it as violent</p>
<p>like a scene out of a horror movie</p>
<p>he was just</p>
<p>absolutely sick from</p>
<p>watching it and yet</p>
<p>had no idea what to do or how to talk to Lisa about it</p>
<p>so friends and family</p>
<p>they did notice</p>
<p>that Lisa had a tendency to slip into like a</p>
<p>world of her own</p>
<p>which could easily been</p>
<p>which probably was a sign of like</p>
<p>of a mental illness like her</p>
<p>disconnecting</p>
<p>but they just thought that she was like a daydreamer</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just a daydreamer</p>
<p>Lisa and Carl</p>
<p>they had 4 children together in a very</p>
<p>short period of time it was like</p>
<p>bang Bang Bang bang Bang 4 kids</p>
<p>and according to Carl</p>
<p>Lisa love the attention she got when she was pregnant</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like everybody seemed to cater to her</p>
<p>makes sense</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve heard this before from like other</p>
<p>women who are pregnant</p>
<p>like you get a lot of attention when you&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something you</p>
<p>never really</p>
<p>think about I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been pregnant so I never</p>
<p>I could see that</p>
<p>you know and she just</p>
<p>loved that anyways is what I&rsquo;m getting at</p>
<p>she loved the</p>
<p>attention she was getting when she was pregnant</p>
<p>and then in</p>
<p>1990 when their final</p>
<p>child was born</p>
<p>2 months premature</p>
<p>doctors feared that Lisa</p>
<p>would not be able to</p>
<p>carry another pregnancy to term</p>
<p>so they recommended that she</p>
<p>get her tubes tied</p>
<p>now Lisa was like really</p>
<p>hesitant to do it she didn&rsquo;t want to get her tubes tied</p>
<p>cause she wanted to have more kids</p>
<p>but her step brother</p>
<p>aka husband and her mom</p>
<p>told her that she needed to do it and like</p>
<p>force the procedure upon her so she</p>
<p>ended up going through with it</p>
<p>Lisa ends up</p>
<p>agreeing to the procedure to get her tubes tied</p>
<p>but she was</p>
<p>bombed she was devastated she wanted to have more kids</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think because she actually liked</p>
<p>the child I</p>
<p>think because she liked being pregnant</p>
<p>which like girl you</p>
<p>could have just gotten one of</p>
<p>those fake bellies and just worn that forever right so</p>
<p>after the procedure</p>
<p>Lisa ends up</p>
<p>claiming 2 different times that she was pregnant</p>
<p>and Carl her husband</p>
<p>or step brother or whatever he is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not pregnant there&rsquo;s no way like you&rsquo;re lying</p>
<p>you got your tubes tied you&rsquo;re not pregnant</p>
<p>and Carl is just sick of her shit</p>
<p>so he ends up divorcing her in 1993</p>
<p>now somehow the 2 of them they end up like making</p>
<p>amends and becoming</p>
<p>falling in love</p>
<p>again or something and they get remarried in 1994</p>
<p>and then in</p>
<p>1998 the 2 of them</p>
<p>break up for good</p>
<p>when Lisa took the 4 children to live with</p>
<p>Kevin Montgomery</p>
<p>this new man</p>
<p>Kevin had 3 children of his own and he</p>
<p>lived with his parents</p>
<p>and 2 years</p>
<p>later in the year 2000</p>
<p>Lisa and Kevin got</p>
<p>married so during her</p>
<p>marriage to</p>
<p>Kevin she claimed to be pregnant</p>
<p>3 different times the last time</p>
<p>being in 2004</p>
<p>with a due date of January 16th</p>
<p>so during these</p>
<p>quote unquote</p>
<p>pregnancies</p>
<p>Lisa dressed in maternity</p>
<p>clothes and even told people of like her</p>
<p>upcoming due dates</p>
<p>Kevin was unaware that she actually got her tubes tied</p>
<p>so he believed her each time</p>
<p>she told him that</p>
<p>she was pregnant</p>
<p>I mean he had no reason</p>
<p>to believe like she would be</p>
<p>lying to him</p>
<p>and Lisa eventually had to tell</p>
<p>Kevin that she lost the baby the</p>
<p>first time she told</p>
<p>Kevin that she had an abortion in New Mexico</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>second time she told him that there was something</p>
<p>wrong with the baby</p>
<p>and she miscarried and had the body donated to science</p>
<p>now Kevin what&rsquo;s he</p>
<p>gonna say I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know nothing he&rsquo;s got nothing to say he&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>because kevin&rsquo;s former wife said that she was skeptical</p>
<p>when she heard</p>
<p>about lisa&rsquo;s most recent pregnancy</p>
<p>and that Kevin</p>
<p>he just had really poor social</p>
<p>skills and he was easily manipulated</p>
<p>so Carl her ex husband</p>
<p>planned on exposing her lies when taking her to court</p>
<p>in order to gain custody</p>
<p>of the 2 of</p>
<p>their 4 children together</p>
<p>the custody hearing was set for January 25th 2005</p>
<p>and he was just</p>
<p>gonna tell em all like she&rsquo;s a liar</p>
<p>make her look bad so he</p>
<p>could take the kids</p>
<p>so in November 2004</p>
<p>Lisa called Carl</p>
<p>to tell him</p>
<p>that she was</p>
<p>going to prove him</p>
<p>wrong and she had an unusual air of</p>
<p>confidence about her</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s speculated that Lisa</p>
<p>alongside her long history of</p>
<p>trauma and severe mental illness felt extreme pressure</p>
<p>and need to produce a baby in</p>
<p>order to counter</p>
<p>the charge of lying</p>
<p>about her pregnancies</p>
<p>and to stop Carl from getting custody</p>
<p>of the children</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s believed that&rsquo;s why she went</p>
<p>killed Bobby Joe</p>
<p>took Victoria</p>
<p>Joe the baby out of</p>
<p>they keep calling it kidnapping but is that kidnapping</p>
<p>cause in my mind cutting</p>
<p>a baby out of someone&rsquo;s stomach is not kidnapping</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why they believe this happened</p>
<p>because she needed to produce a baby for the</p>
<p>trial you know</p>
<p>so at a pre</p>
<p>trial hearing a</p>
<p>neuropsychologist testified that head injuries at</p>
<p>least I had sustained some years</p>
<p>earlier kind of damaged</p>
<p>the part of her</p>
<p>brain that controls</p>
<p>aggression and lisa&rsquo;s original</p>
<p>legal team met</p>
<p>for dinner to discuss the case</p>
<p>there were many challenges that they faced Lisa had</p>
<p>drawn global headlines</p>
<p>when federal prosecutors</p>
<p>accused her of strangling</p>
<p>Bobby Joe to</p>
<p>death slicing open her</p>
<p>belly and kidnapping the unborn baby</p>
<p>and there was really little</p>
<p>to no room for doubt</p>
<p>that Lisa committed the</p>
<p>crime because she was arrested</p>
<p>while cradling the baby in her arms</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>this lady is just</p>
<p>insane so the debate at dinner was</p>
<p>sparked by the team</p>
<p>fighting amongst themselves as to who</p>
<p>would be in charge</p>
<p>not how they</p>
<p>would handle the case</p>
<p>the relationships between the 3 lawyers</p>
<p>soured and they eventually all but one</p>
<p>dropped off the case</p>
<p>the judge Judge Gary</p>
<p>Fenner he assigned John P o&rsquo;connor</p>
<p>and Frederick Dutch Art</p>
<p>to be lisa&rsquo;s defense attorney</p>
<p>some would even</p>
<p>describe it as the</p>
<p>dream team because like they just always won</p>
<p>their cases like you</p>
<p>would want these people on your side</p>
<p>but John a former prosecutor</p>
<p>was Kansas city&rsquo;s most successful</p>
<p>go to criminal defense lawyer Frederick had</p>
<p>tried more than a</p>
<p>dozen capital cases</p>
<p>he was also</p>
<p>an attorney who had more clients sentenced to</p>
<p>death in federal</p>
<p>court than any defense lawyer in America</p>
<p>so this Frederick</p>
<p>guy he was extremely busy</p>
<p>he was extremely busy with another case</p>
<p>and at that time he was only able to</p>
<p>visit Lisa 3 times</p>
<p>and Lisa seemed to like really not trust men</p>
<p>for a good freaking</p>
<p>reason but Lisa really didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust him she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust men so in</p>
<p>order to develop like some kind of rapport</p>
<p>with her he ends up sending his wife</p>
<p>her name is Ryland</p>
<p>to visit her in prison</p>
<p>now ryland had no</p>
<p>experience investigating</p>
<p>death penalty cases</p>
<p>her expertise was in</p>
<p>horse therapy</p>
<p>for artistic children</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s on the case now and she went to go</p>
<p>visit Lisa 16 times her and Lisa became very close</p>
<p>so as lisa&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trial date approached in</p>
<p>October of 2007</p>
<p>Frederick was convinced he</p>
<p>could secure a non</p>
<p>guilty verdict by suggesting that</p>
<p>Bobby Joe was killed by lisa&rsquo;s brother</p>
<p>Tommy and it was Tommy</p>
<p>who gave his</p>
<p>sister&rsquo;s baby</p>
<p>to Lisa that was the new plan</p>
<p>now unfortunately</p>
<p>just a few weeks before the</p>
<p>trial Tommy</p>
<p>he had an alibi his alibi</p>
<p>emerged and at the time of</p>
<p>Bobby joe&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>Tommy had been</p>
<p>meeting with his probation officer</p>
<p>so that little</p>
<p>situation the plan to</p>
<p>blame Tommy</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t gonna work for them sorry</p>
<p>her family now</p>
<p>believe she had been the one who decided to lay</p>
<p>blame on her brother which</p>
<p>revoking their</p>
<p>agreement to cooperate</p>
<p>the possibly</p>
<p>life saving evidence of providing lisa&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>story of abuse was no longer available</p>
<p>to them from the source</p>
<p>so they had to come up with a new strategy</p>
<p>which was getting Lisa to</p>
<p>admit that she had indeed killed Bobby Joe</p>
<p>but proved that</p>
<p>she was not guilty by reason of insanity</p>
<p>so if her lawyers</p>
<p>could get the jury to believe</p>
<p>as they did</p>
<p>that Lisa suffered from depression</p>
<p>borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>post traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p>and also phantom</p>
<p>pregnancy like that&rsquo;s a condition</p>
<p>where a woman believes she&rsquo;s pregnant</p>
<p>even though she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>remember we talked</p>
<p>about it in the Bloody Mary</p>
<p>story do you remember</p>
<p>phantom pregnancies</p>
<p>where like a woman</p>
<p>thinks she&rsquo;s pregnant</p>
<p>and then your body</p>
<p>reacts and you</p>
<p>experience symptoms of pregnancy</p>
<p>such as like</p>
<p>swelling of the belly</p>
<p>your menstruation stops I hate that word</p>
<p>and then also you may feel like movement</p>
<p>in your stomach isn&rsquo;t that wild so</p>
<p>unfortunately though like this</p>
<p>theory it didn&rsquo;t stand in</p>
<p>court and the prosecution managed to have forensic</p>
<p>psychiatrist Park dates</p>
<p>who worked with prosecutors</p>
<p>on the cases of Jeffrey Dahmer and the Unabomber</p>
<p>we did both of</p>
<p>those remember</p>
<p>oh my God how many members am I gonna say</p>
<p>anyways they testified that the diagnosis</p>
<p>offered by the defense&rsquo;s main</p>
<p>expert witness was</p>
<p>voodoo science</p>
<p>and excluded</p>
<p>from the case entirely</p>
<p>on the grounds that it had no</p>
<p>scientific basis</p>
<p>the defense also went on to further</p>
<p>prove that Lisa</p>
<p>knew her actions were</p>
<p>wrong and none of them were impulsive</p>
<p>so with no final</p>
<p>tactics available</p>
<p>Lisa was unable to be saved from</p>
<p>a murder conviction</p>
<p>on October 22 2007 Lisa</p>
<p>she was convicted of murder</p>
<p>and she received the</p>
<p>death sentence</p>
<p>on October 26</p>
<p>lisa&rsquo;s husband</p>
<p>Kevin and Bobby joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother Beck</p>
<p>as well as some</p>
<p>other family members</p>
<p>were all at the hearing but no one</p>
<p>spoke to reporters</p>
<p>so of course they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to appeal the case they don&rsquo;t want her to die</p>
<p>to get a death penalty</p>
<p>and then during the appeals process</p>
<p>experts examined</p>
<p>Lisa and found that</p>
<p>unbeknownst to her trial jury</p>
<p>her upbringing had left her suffering from</p>
<p>fluorid psychosis</p>
<p>bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and post traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p>she was often disassociated from reality</p>
<p>and as a result</p>
<p>from her many beatings had suffered permanent</p>
<p>brain damage because of all of this</p>
<p>before her trial</p>
<p>neither the prosecution</p>
<p>nor her own defense team had investigated</p>
<p>the relationship between lisa&rsquo;s many symptoms</p>
<p>and her traumatic history during the</p>
<p>trial the jury</p>
<p>found that Lisa</p>
<p>was unemotional</p>
<p>she showed like no remorse</p>
<p>for her actions</p>
<p>she showed really no emotion</p>
<p>about what had</p>
<p>taken place</p>
<p>and lisa&rsquo;s appeals team felt that the only</p>
<p>reason for this behavior was because Lisa was taking a</p>
<p>powerful anti</p>
<p>psychotic medication that Lisa deserved an appeal</p>
<p>because she was just as much a victim</p>
<p>as she was the perpetrator</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a hot debate</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what makes this kind of like an interesting</p>
<p>story because a lot of people do believe that she was</p>
<p>just as much</p>
<p>of a victim</p>
<p>as Bobby Joe</p>
<p>so Frederick responded to the appeal with an affidavit</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say this word</p>
<p>affidavit of over</p>
<p>100 pages defending his</p>
<p>legal proceedings insisting that none</p>
<p>of the issues raised by her appeal lawyers have merit</p>
<p>he felt that the</p>
<p>experience trying over a</p>
<p>dozen capital</p>
<p>cases many involving complex mental health issues</p>
<p>proved he handled the case the best way possible</p>
<p>and that this former clients</p>
<p>appeal lawyers were nothing more than</p>
<p>spoiled selfish</p>
<p>primadonnas</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he said</p>
<p>anyways to make a long</p>
<p>story short here because they</p>
<p>were just trying to like get an appeal and get Lisa</p>
<p>to be able to present in</p>
<p>court that she</p>
<p>was a victim</p>
<p>just as much</p>
<p>as Bobby Joe was for some odd reason she didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>the death penalty</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why people try to</p>
<p>avoid the death penalty</p>
<p>I would gladly take it over sitting in jail</p>
<p>is that just me</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>sitting in jail for the rest of your life</p>
<p>sounds way worse</p>
<p>anyways I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry anyways so</p>
<p>they tried to appeal</p>
<p>any way that they</p>
<p>could and they</p>
<p>tried every</p>
<p>which way possible</p>
<p>but they exhausted the appeals process Lisa was</p>
<p>scheduled for an</p>
<p>execution by lethal injection</p>
<p>December 8th</p>
<p>2020 but it was</p>
<p>delayed because her attorney</p>
<p>contracted COVID 19</p>
<p>I know just recently oh my God</p>
<p>so just recently like a couple months ago</p>
<p>January first</p>
<p>2021 the judge</p>
<p>granted a stay of her</p>
<p>execution on the ground that her mental competence</p>
<p>must first be tested</p>
<p>as executing</p>
<p>individuals</p>
<p>with intellectual disabilities violates the 8th</p>
<p>Amendment of the Constitution regarding</p>
<p>cruel and unusual punishments</p>
<p>therefore meaning Lisa</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t qualify for the deaf sentence</p>
<p>this day was then overturned by the Supreme</p>
<p>Court they voted 02:54 and the</p>
<p>execution order was</p>
<p>ordered to be</p>
<p>carried out immediately</p>
<p>not long after midnight January 13th</p>
<p>2021 Lisa Montgomery</p>
<p>was executed at the</p>
<p>prison in Indiana</p>
<p>yeah bye when</p>
<p>asked if she had any</p>
<p>final words</p>
<p>she simply responded with no she is the</p>
<p>first female federal inmate in 67 years to be</p>
<p>executed by the United States</p>
<p>federal government reports confirmed that members of</p>
<p>Bobby joe&rsquo;s family were present</p>
<p>for the execution but</p>
<p>Bobby joe&rsquo;s husband</p>
<p>he has not spoken publicly about</p>
<p>that day or really</p>
<p>about anything and that my friends is the</p>
<p>awful story</p>
<p>about Bobby Joe her</p>
<p>awful sad murder</p>
<p>how sick Lisa Montgomery was</p>
<p>and what the fuck</p>
<p>so okay this one&rsquo;s got me a little confused because I</p>
<p>think naturally like you want to see Lisa as the victim</p>
<p>but she did something really</p>
<p>awful I mean like that takes a special kind of sick</p>
<p>to kill somebody</p>
<p>and then cut</p>
<p>their stomach open</p>
<p>that takes a</p>
<p>different kind of fucking brain okay</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s like yes</p>
<p>Lisa went through some</p>
<p>awful shit but lots of people go through</p>
<p>awful shit and don&rsquo;t cut stomachs open</p>
<p>you know sorry Lisa</p>
<p>but bye you know I just it&rsquo;s hard to have</p>
<p>compassion for her when</p>
<p>she did something really really really really really</p>
<p>awful I don&rsquo;t know how I feel</p>
<p>how do you feel</p>
<p>I would love to hear your guys thoughts down</p>
<p>below do you</p>
<p>think Lisa should have been</p>
<p>executed is she a</p>
<p>victim shit</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>look in this country</p>
<p>we care more</p>
<p>about getting rid of people than we do helping people</p>
<p>when they go through traumatic shit</p>
<p>so it makes</p>
<p>sense in this country</p>
<p>but if we were a country that put</p>
<p>mental illness and</p>
<p>stuff first I</p>
<p>think she could have been helped</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s be honest</p>
<p>here that&rsquo;s not how this country works we like to just</p>
<p>lock them up get</p>
<p>them out of here you know so it&rsquo;s like realistically</p>
<p>it would have been nice if she</p>
<p>could receive some kind of help but was it</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>fucking no because that&rsquo;s not how this</p>
<p>place works you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my own opinion and um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but Lisa you</p>
<p>gotta go because that was that was real fucked up</p>
<p>where is Bobby joe&rsquo;s family now</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t look it up I didn&rsquo;t want to because</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;ve been through a lot</p>
<p>just leave them alone</p>
<p>but other than that I hope you have a wonderful day</p>
<p>you make good choices please be safe out there</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
