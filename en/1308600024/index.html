    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system,</p>
<p>with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>For the last month, four episodes to be exact,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been discussing physical performance</p>
<p>and skill learning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about how to learn skills faster,</p>
<p>whether or not those are skills for athletic performance,</p>
<p>dance, music, things of that sort.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also talked about how to gain strength</p>
<p>and how to lose fat faster by leveraging the nervous system,</p>
<p>things like shiver and non-shiver,</p>
<p>non-exercise activity-induced thermogenesis.</p>
<p>We talked about how neurons</p>
<p>can actually trigger accelerated fat loss.</p>
<p>We talked about hypertrophy, also called muscle growth,</p>
<p>and we covered everything from sets and reps, protocols,</p>
<p>how long to stay in a cold ice bath, when to get out,</p>
<p>how to keep shivering.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered a lot of tools and a lot of science.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in those things</p>
<p>and you even perhaps want to learn a little bit</p>
<p>about how we make energy, ATP,</p>
<p>from carbohydrates or from fats,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all covered in the previous four episodes.</p>
<p>This was going to be the time</p>
<p>that we move to a new topic entirely,</p>
<p>but we are going to do one more episode</p>
<p>in this series on physical performance</p>
<p>for the simple reason that you asked many questions</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s vitally important,</p>
<p>both for physical performance</p>
<p>and long-term and short-term health, and that&rsquo;s endurance.</p>
<p>And so today we are going to talk about endurance.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re a strength athlete</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not interested in endurance,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t depart just yet because it turns out</p>
<p>that there are ways to train endurance</p>
<p>that are very different</p>
<p>than I would have previously imagined.</p>
<p>If you only think about long runs, long swims,</p>
<p>marathons, half marathons, 10Ks, 5Ks,</p>
<p>and that sort of thing puts you to sleep,</p>
<p>kind of like Costello is snoring</p>
<p>in the background right now,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a long distance endurance athlete, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in those things</p>
<p>or if you are averse to those things,</p>
<p>I encourage you to continue listening</p>
<p>because we are going to talk about a little bit of science</p>
<p>and then some specific protocols</p>
<p>that really define what endurance is,</p>
<p>the four types of endurance,</p>
<p>and ways to train those in concert</p>
<p>with the other things that you might be doing,</p>
<p>like weight training or skill training or yoga.</p>
<p>And if you are an endurance athlete,</p>
<p>we are going to cover a lot of tools and science</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m certain will also help enhance your training</p>
<p>and performance in races or even just recreationally.</p>
<p>The topic of endurance, I think,</p>
<p>has been badly misrepresented, frankly, online.</p>
<p>And when you start digging into the science</p>
<p>and you start talking to real experts in this area,</p>
<p>what you discover, what I&rsquo;ve discovered,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s an incredibly interesting area</p>
<p>because it teaches us so much</p>
<p>about how our body and our brain use fuels</p>
<p>and how we can control which fuels</p>
<p>are used by our body and brain.</p>
<p>So today we will talk about the four kinds of endurance.</p>
<p>We will also cover the topic of hydration,</p>
<p>which might sound incredibly boring,</p>
<p>like, okay, just drink more water.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because not only is hydration</p>
<p>a limiting factor on performance,</p>
<p>but there is a right way to hydrate</p>
<p>and there is a wrong way to hydrate.</p>
<p>There actually is a formula that I&rsquo;ll teach you</p>
<p>to know how much water to be drinking,</p>
<p>depending on your activity levels.</p>
<p>And if that sounds like a simple thing,</p>
<p>like, oh, just tap off water until your urine runs clear,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually the wrong advice.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you don&rsquo;t hydrate properly,</p>
<p>you can see 20 to 30% reductions in performance,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s strength,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s increasing hypertrophy,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s running, swimming,</p>
<p>even mental performance.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re not an athlete</p>
<p>or a recreational athlete at all,</p>
<p>I encourage you to stay tuned for the part about hydration.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to cover, as usual, a little bit of science,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re going to dive right into protocols</p>
<p>that you can apply if you like,</p>
<p>and if you deem those correct and safe for you.</p>
<p>Before we dive into all that,</p>
<p>I want to make an important announcement,</p>
<p>which is all the episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>are now housed on a single website,</p>
<p>which is hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>If you go to hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>you can find all the episodes in YouTube,</p>
<p>Apple, and Spotify format with links there.</p>
<p>The website is also searchable.</p>
<p>So if you go into the little search function,</p>

<p>I briefly want to touch on something</p>
<p>from the previous episode,</p>
<p>which is that if you are somebody</p>
<p>that is trying to increase muscle strength and or size,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re simply somebody</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t want to increase muscle strength and size,</p>
<p>you just want to maintain the musculature that you have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s vital that you perform at least five sets</p>
<p>of resistance training per muscle per week.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t do that, we lose muscle over time.</p>
<p>And that is one reason among many</p>
<p>to have a regular resistance training protocol.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to start resembling a folded over envelope</p>
<p>or a melted candle.</p>
<p>No one wants to have challenges getting up out of a chair</p>
<p>or off the ground.</p>
<p>Maintaining musculature is vital,</p>
<p>not just to our immediate health,</p>
<p>but to our long-term health trajectory.</p>
<p>So I just want to emphasize that point.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re curious about the sets, the reps,</p>
<p>how close to failure to go or not go,</p>
<p>whether or not you should be doing</p>
<p>your cardiovascular training before</p>
<p>or after your weight training,</p>
<p>all of that is in the previous episode,</p>
<p>right down to the details.</p>
<p>And I like to think it made simple for you to understand.</p>
<p>But I do strongly believe that resistance training,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s with body weight or bands or weights</p>
<p>or simply lifting rocks in the yard or logs in the yard,</p>
<p>is vital for our systemic physiology and our overall health.</p>
<p>And that includes our brain health.</p>
<p>And I described the reasons for that</p>
<p>and the mechanisms in the previous episode.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;d like to talk about endurance</p>
<p>and how to build endurance and how to use endurance</p>
<p>for the health of your entire body.</p>
<p>Endurance, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>is our ability to engage in continuous bouts of exercise</p>
<p>or continuous movement or continuous effort of any kind.</p>
<p>And I do believe that our ability to engage in activities</p>
<p>that we call endurance training</p>
<p>or physical endurance activities</p>
<p>do have carryover to mental performance</p>
<p>of things that require long-term effort.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll touch on that at the end</p>
<p>and why there&rsquo;s reason to believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a biological crossover between those two things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s simply the case</p>
<p>that if you train yourself to be a strength</p>
<p>and speed athlete and to do short bouts of exercise</p>
<p>that are very intense,</p>
<p>that you can only do mental work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s of short bouts and very intense.</p>
<p>But it is clear that cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>exercise where you&rsquo;re getting your heart rate up</p>
<p>continuously for a period of time,</p>
<p>and endurance exercise,</p>
<p>we will define what that is in a moment,</p>
<p>is vital for tapping into and enhancing various aspects</p>
<p>of our biology in the body and in the brain</p>
<p>such that our brain can perform work</p>
<p>for longer periods of time,</p>
<p>focused work, learning, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I want to dive into the topic of endurance</p>
<p>and I want to just begin by addressing something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s vital to any kind of effort,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s mental effort or physical effort.</p>
<p>So as always, a little bit of science</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get right into protocols.</p>
<p>So the key thing to understand</p>
<p>about energy production in the body,</p>
<p>meaning your ability to think, your ability to talk,</p>
<p>your ability to walk, your ability to run</p>
<p>is this thing that we call ATP.</p>
<p>ATP and mitochondria,</p>
<p>which are just little, what we call organelles within cells,</p>
<p>these little factories that make energy, if you will,</p>
<p>ATP is required for anything that requires energy,</p>
<p>for anything that you do that requires effort.</p>
<p>And there are different ways to get ATP.</p>
<p>And we have been gifted as a species</p>
<p>with the ability to convert lots of things into ATP.</p>
<p>We can convert carbohydrates,</p>
<p>literally the kinds of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>You eat a bagel, you eat a piece of pizza,</p>
<p>usually is dough and it has cheese and some other things.</p>
<p>Costello hears me talking about pizza.</p>
<p>Costello loves pizza, by the way.</p>
<p>Eating a piece of pizza,</p>
<p>it gets converted into various things,</p>
<p>fatty acids from the fats, glucose from the bread.</p>
<p>And those things get converted into ATP within cells</p>
<p>through things like glycolysis, things like lipolysis.</p>
<p>I talked about this in previous episodes.</p>
<p>So our muscles and our neurons</p>
<p>use different fuel sources to generate ATP.</p>
<p>The ones that are used first</p>
<p>for short bouts of intense activity</p>
<p>are things like phosphocreatine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve only heard about creatine as a supplement,</p>
<p>well, phosphocreatine actually exists on our muscles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why people take creatine.</p>
<p>You can load your muscles with more creatine.</p>
<p>And though, and excuse me,</p>
<p>phosphocreatine is great for short, intense bouts of effort.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re really pushing hard on something physical,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you see a car on the side of the road</p>
<p>and that car is stalled and a person says,</p>
<p>hey, can you help me push my car?</p>
<p>And you start to push,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be phosphocreatine</p>
<p>is going to be your main fuel source.</p>
<p>Then you start to tap into things like glucose,</p>
<p>which is literally just carbohydrate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sugar that&rsquo;s in your blood.</p>
<p>And then if you keep pushing on that car,</p>
<p>you keep engaging in a particular effort</p>
<p>or you keep studying or you keep listening to this podcast,</p>
<p>you start to tap into other fuel sources</p>
<p>like glycogen from your liver,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a little pack,</p>
<p>just like you might&rsquo;ve packed a sandwich</p>
<p>or something for work.</p>
<p>You have a little pack of glycogen in your liver</p>
<p>that you can rely on.</p>
<p>And you have fats stored in adipose tissue.</p>
<p>Even if you have very, very low body fat percentage,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re one of these people</p>
<p>has like 3% or 5% body fat,</p>
<p>really thin skin, very little body fat.</p>
<p>You can extract lipids, fatty acids from that body fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a storage pack.</p>
<p>It is a storage pack for energy</p>
<p>that can be converted to ATP.</p>
<p>So without going into any more detail,</p>
<p>when I say today energy, or I say ATP,</p>
<p>just remember that regardless of your diet,</p>
<p>regardless of your nutritional plan,</p>
<p>your body has the capacity to use creatine, glucose,</p>
<p>glycogen, lipids.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re ketogenic, ketones,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about ketosis,</p>
<p>in order to generate fuel, energy.</p>
<p>Now, the other crucial point is that</p>
<p>in order to complete that process of taking these fuels</p>
<p>and converting them into energy,</p>
<p>most of the time you need oxygen.</p>
<p>You need air, basically, in your system.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not actual air.</p>
<p>You need oxygen molecules in your system,</p>
<p>comes in through your mouth and your nose,</p>
<p>goes to your lungs and distributes via the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Oxygen is not a fuel,</p>
<p>but like a fire that has no oxygen,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t actually burn the logs.</p>
<p>But when you blow a lot of oxygen onto a fire,</p>
<p>basically onto logs with a flame there,</p>
<p>then basically it will take fire, it will burn, okay?</p>
<p>Oxygen allows you to burn fuel.</p>
<p>So today we are going to ask the critical questions.</p>
<p>What allows us to perform?</p>
<p>What allows us to continue effort for long periods of time?</p>
<p>And that effort could be a run, it could be a swim,</p>
<p>it could be studying,</p>
<p>it could be anything that extends over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re going to need energy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to need oxygen.</p>
<p>But the way to answer a question,</p>
<p>like what allows us to endure, right?</p>
<p>Endurance, what allows us to keep going?</p>
<p>Well, we think of things like willpower,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s willpower?</p>
<p>Willpower is neurons, it&rsquo;s neurons in our brain.</p>
<p>We have this thing called the central governor,</p>
<p>which decides whether or not we should or could continue</p>
<p>or whether or not we should stop,</p>
<p>whether or not we should quit, okay?</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re somebody who has a lot</p>
<p>of what we would call resilience and endurance,</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re somebody who taps out early</p>
<p>and quits early or can&rsquo;t handle frustration,</p>
<p>that has to do with your fuel utilization</p>
<p>in specific neurons.</p>
<p>So we have to ask the question,</p>
<p>what is the limiting factor on performance, right?</p>
<p>So instead of saying what allows us to endure,</p>
<p>we should say, what prevents us from enduring?</p>
<p>What prevents us from moving forward?</p>
<p>What are the factors that say, you know what?</p>
<p>No more, I&rsquo;m not going to continue this run,</p>
<p>or you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a really long, hard day,</p>
<p>or maybe I&rsquo;ve had an easy day, or I&rsquo;m feeling lazy.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t even really feel like getting up and moving.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re going to talk about today</p>
<p>actually gets right down to the heart</p>
<p>of motivation and fuel use.</p>
<p>Motivation and fuel allocation.</p>
<p>And we are going to talk about specific training protocols</p>
<p>that you can follow that have carry over</p>
<p>between the bodily systems of running, swimming, et cetera,</p>
<p>and the way that your brain works.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about endurance by asking first,</p>
<p>what are the limiting factors on endurance?</p>
<p>What stops us?</p>
<p>Because in addressing that and answering that,</p>
<p>we will understand what allows us to get into effort</p>
<p>and to continue effort.</p>
<p>There are five main categories of things</p>
<p>that allow us to engage in effort.</p>
<p>And they are neurons, nerves, muscle, muscle,</p>
<p>blood, things in our blood, our heart, and our lungs.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want to completely write off things</p>
<p>like the immune system and other systems of the body,</p>
<p>but nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs</p>
<p>are the five that I want to focus on today,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where most of the data are.</p>
<p>As we go forward into this,</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge Dr. Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>who as with the last episode,</p>
<p>has been tremendously helpful and informative</p>
<p>in terms of the exercise physiology.</p>
<p>He is a true expert.</p>
<p>He has a laboratory.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a full professor who does work on muscle biopsy,</p>
<p>who understands the science,</p>
<p>but who also works with athletes</p>
<p>and works with recreational athletes,</p>
<p>professional athletes,</p>
<p>really understands at a variety of levels</p>
<p>how all these systems work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the person I consulted with about today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>although I did access other literature as well.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to mention a key review</p>
<p>for any of you aficionados</p>
<p>who really want to get down into the weeds.</p>
<p>But I encourage you, if you want more detail,</p>
<p>to check out Dr. Andy Galpin&rsquo;s YouTube page.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s also on Twitter.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s definitely on Instagram.</p>
<p>His content is excellent, and he really understands.</p>
<p>I have learned, and I really believe,</p>
<p>that an intellectual is somebody who understands a topic</p>
<p>at multiple levels of specificity, of detail,</p>
<p>and can communicate that.</p>
<p>And Andy is a true intellectual</p>
<p>of muscle physiology and performance.</p>
<p>And if you hear the word intellectual</p>
<p>and you kind of back up and cringe from that,</p>
<p>understand that he&rsquo;s also a practitioner.</p>
<p>So thank you, Andrew Galpin, Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>for your support in these episodes.</p>
<p>And we hope to have you as a guest on the podcast soon.</p>
<p>So nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about neurons and how they work, okay?</p>
<p>But I want to tell you about an experiment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to make it very clear</p>
<p>why quitting is a mental thing, not a physical thing.</p>
<p>So why do we quit?</p>
<p>Well, an experiment was done a couple of years ago</p>
<p>and was published in the journal Cell,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,</p>
<p>showing that there&rsquo;s a class of neurons</p>
<p>in our brainstem, in the back of our brain,</p>
<p>that if they shut off, we quit.</p>
<p>Now, these neurons release epinephrine.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is adrenaline.</p>
<p>And anytime we are engaged in effort of any kind,</p>
<p>we are releasing epinephrine.</p>
<p>Anytime we&rsquo;re awake, really,</p>
<p>we are releasing epinephrine into our brain.</p>
<p>In fact, this little group of neurons</p>
<p>in the back of our brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the locus coeruleus, if you like,</p>
<p>is churning out epinephrine all the time.</p>
<p>But if something stresses us out, it churns out more,</p>
<p>and then it acts as kind of an alertness signal</p>
<p>for the whole brain.</p>
<p>We also, of course, have adrenaline epinephrine</p>
<p>released in our body, which makes our body ready for things.</p>
<p>So think about epinephrine as a readiness signal.</p>
<p>And when we are engaged in effort,</p>
<p>this readiness signal is being churned into our brain.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re relaxed and we&rsquo;re falling asleep,</p>
<p>epinephrine levels are low.</p>
<p>Okay, so they did a really interesting experiment</p>
<p>where they had subjects engage in bouts of effort</p>
<p>of trying to move forward toward a goal,</p>
<p>but they manipulated the visual environment</p>
<p>with these stripes,</p>
<p>kind of like fences passing on both sides of them.</p>
<p>And by doing that, they could trick subjects</p>
<p>into thinking that their effort</p>
<p>was either allowing them to move forward, right?</p>
<p>Because these rungs on the fence were moving past,</p>
<p>or that their effort was futile,</p>
<p>that they were no longer moving forward</p>
<p>because they would make the rungs move slowly,</p>
<p>even though the subjects were making a lot of effort</p>
<p>to move forward, okay?</p>
<p>So this is analogous or similar to being on a treadmill,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to walk on this treadmill,</p>
<p>and you just can&rsquo;t move the conveyor, right?</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re in virtual reality,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting a ton of effort,</p>
<p>but it seems like you&rsquo;re moving excruciatingly slow.</p>
<p>I had this experience recently in real life.</p>
<p>I was doing a swim in the Pacific.</p>
<p>I was trying to go south,</p>
<p>and I was swimming, and I was caught in a current,</p>
<p>not the kind that pulls you out to ocean,</p>
<p>and I kept looking to my left,</p>
<p>and I saw this hotel on the shoreline,</p>
<p>and then I was swimming and swimming</p>
<p>and swimming and swimming,</p>
<p>and 20 minutes later, I looked to my left,</p>
<p>and the hotel is still exactly where it was before,</p>
<p>which meant that I wasn&rsquo;t moving.</p>
<p>It felt futile.</p>
<p>Eventually, either the current changed or something changed,</p>
<p>and I eventually swam past the hotel,</p>
<p>got back on the beach, and eventually drove home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what they did in this experiment,</p>
<p>but what they found was these neurons</p>
<p>that release epinephrine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another cell type called glia,</p>
<p>which actually means glue in Latin,</p>
<p>that is paying attention</p>
<p>to how much epinephrine is being released,</p>
<p>and at some point, the system reaches a threshold.</p>
<p>It reaches this threshold,</p>
<p>and it shuts off the release of more epinephrine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I quit, that&rsquo;s it, no more effort signal.</p>
<p>If they could extend the time</p>
<p>before those glia said, ah, enough,</p>
<p>if they could release more adrenaline into the system,</p>
<p>then subjects would keep going.</p>
<p>So our desire to continue, or put differently,</p>
<p>our willingness to continue and our desire to quit</p>
<p>is mediated by events between our two ears.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the body&rsquo;s not involved,</p>
<p>but it means that neurons are critically important.</p>
<p>So we have two categories of neurons that are important,</p>
<p>the ones in our head that tell us,</p>
<p>get up and go out and take that run,</p>
<p>and the ones that allow us,</p>
<p>encourage us to continue that run,</p>
<p>and we have neurons that shut things off,</p>
<p>that say no more.</p>
<p>And we, of course, have the neurons</p>
<p>that connect to our muscles and control our muscles.</p>
<p>But the reason we quit is rarely because our body quits,</p>
<p>our mind quits.</p>
<p>Now, I would never want to encourage people</p>
<p>to drive themselves to the point of injury.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to be good for anybody,</p>
<p>but it is good to know that it&rsquo;s neural.</p>
<p>Our ability to persist is neural.</p>
<p>So when people say, is it,</p>
<p>I hear that, you know, sports or effort or fighting,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s 90% mental, 10% physical,</p>
<p>you know, that whole discussion about how much is mental,</p>
<p>how much is physical is absolutely silly.</p>
<p>It just proves that there&rsquo;s no knowledge</p>
<p>of the underlying biology behind that statement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neither mental nor physical.</p>
<p>Everything is physical.</p>
<p>Everything is neurons.</p>
<p>Your thinking is the responsibility</p>
<p>of chemicals and electrical signals in your head.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not 90% mental, 10% physical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 50-50.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 70-30.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 100% nervous system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neurons, okay?</p>
<p>So when people say mental or physical,</p>
<p>understand it&rsquo;s 100% neural.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love for the, how much of it is mental</p>
<p>and how much is physical to just disappear.</p>
<p>That argument means nothing and it&rsquo;s not actionable.</p>
<p>Now, what do nerves need in order to continue to fire?</p>
<p>What do you need in order to get neurons to say,</p>
<p>I will persist?</p>
<p>Well, they need glucose.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re a keto and ketogenic adapted,</p>
<p>you need carbohydrate is glucose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what neurons run on.</p>
<p>And you need electrolytes.</p>
<p>Neurons have what&rsquo;s called a sodium potassium pump,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>They generate electricity.</p>
<p>We could go into all this.</p>
<p>I will probably do an entire lecture</p>
<p>about the action potential,</p>
<p>but basically in order to get nerve cells to fire,</p>
<p>to contract muscle, to say, I&rsquo;m going to continue,</p>
<p>you need sufficient sodium salt</p>
<p>because the action potential,</p>
<p>the actual firing of neurons is driven</p>
<p>by sodium entering the cell, rushing into the cell.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a removal of potassium.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a kind of resetting of those levels</p>
<p>by something called the sodium potassium pump</p>
<p>and the sodium potassium pump</p>
<p>and sodium and action potentials.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t know anything about that is ATP dependent.</p>
<p>It requires energy.</p>
<p>So you need energy in order to get neurons to fire.</p>
<p>And it is pH dependent.</p>
<p>It depends on the conditions</p>
<p>or the environment within the brain</p>
<p>being of a certain pH or acidity.</p>
<p>pH is about how acid or how basic the environment is.</p>
<p>And we will talk a little bit about pH</p>
<p>in simple terms that you can understand.</p>
<p>So nerves need salt.</p>
<p>They need potassium.</p>
<p>And it turns out they need magnesium</p>
<p>and you need glucose and carbohydrates</p>
<p>in order to power those neurons</p>
<p>unless you are running on ketones.</p>
<p>And to run on ketones,</p>
<p>you have to make sure that you&rsquo;re fully keto adapted.</p>
<p>I will talk about adding in ketones</p>
<p>on top of carbohydrate at the end of the episode.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s how nerves work.</p>
<p>You need carbohydrate,</p>
<p>you need sodium, potassium, and magnesium</p>
<p>in order to drive the brain.</p>
<p>Muscle, muscle is going to engage</p>
<p>and generate energy first</p>
<p>by using this phosphocreatine system.</p>
<p>High bouts of effort, really intense effort,</p>
<p>short-lived seconds to minutes,</p>
<p>but probably more like seconds</p>
<p>is going to be this phosphocreatine,</p>
<p>literally a fuel source in the muscle</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to burn</p>
<p>just like you would logs on a fire.</p>
<p>And glycogen, which is stored carbohydrate in the muscle,</p>
<p>that also can be burned</p>
<p>just like logs on a fire to generate energy.</p>
<p>So let me make this crystal clear.</p>
<p>If you move your wrist towards your shoulder</p>
<p>and contract your bicep really hard,</p>
<p>muscle fibers are burning up their own carbohydrate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re converting that into ATP</p>
<p>in order to generate that energy, okay?</p>
<p>And pH is important and temperature is important.</p>
<p>In the episode on supercharge, your physical performance,</p>
<p>I talked all about how by using cooling</p>
<p>specifically of the palms or the bottoms of the feet</p>
<p>or the cheeks of the face using particular methods,</p>
<p>you can adjust the temperature of the body and of muscle</p>
<p>in a way that allows you to do more work,</p>
<p>to do more reps, to run further,</p>
<p>to keep going and to persist.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because if temperature is too low or too high,</p>
<p>then ATP is not going to be available</p>
<p>because of this whole thing</p>
<p>called the pyruvate kinase pathway</p>
<p>and the temperature dependence of pyruvate kinase.</p>
<p>Check out that episode</p>
<p>if you want to learn more about that,</p>
<p>but temperature is important and pH is also important.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got nerve, muscle,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s stuff in our blood</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s available as an energy source.</p>
<p>And in blood, we&rsquo;ve got glucose,</p>
<p>so literally blood sugar that&rsquo;s floating around.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you have fasted for three days,</p>
<p>your blood glucose is going to be very low,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s not going to be a great fuel source,</p>
<p>but you will start to liberate fats</p>
<p>from your adipose tissue, from your fat.</p>
<p>Fatty acids will start to mobilize into the bloodstream</p>
<p>and you can burn those for energy.</p>
<p>And oxygen in your blood,</p>
<p>when you inhale, you&rsquo;re bringing oxygen into your blood.</p>
<p>So these are all fuel sources in your neurons,</p>
<p>in your muscle, in your blood,</p>
<p>in your various tissues that are providing the opportunity</p>
<p>to give effort, to induce effort,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a run or a swim or writing or talking.</p>
<p>Now, there are some other factors that are important</p>
<p>and those are the heart, which is going to move blood.</p>
<p>So the more that the heart can move blood and oxygen,</p>
<p>well, the more fuel that&rsquo;s going to be available</p>
<p>for you to engage in muscular effort and thinking effort.</p>
<p>So your heart is vitally important</p>
<p>to your muscle&rsquo;s ability to work</p>
<p>and your brain&rsquo;s ability to work.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve mentioned, oxygen a few times,</p>
<p>it should be obvious then that the lungs are very important.</p>
<p>You need to bring oxygen in</p>
<p>and distribute it to all these tissues</p>
<p>because oxygen is critical</p>
<p>for the conversion of carbohydrates</p>
<p>and the conversion of fats.</p>
<p>And we could get into the discussion</p>
<p>about whether or not oxygen is important</p>
<p>for ketogenic metabolism, but you need oxygen there.</p>
<p>You need to breathe and you need to breathe properly.</p>
<p>So I just covered what would normally be</p>
<p>about four lectures of energy consumption</p>
<p>and energy utilization.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go into much detail at all,</p>
<p>but what I want you to imagine</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;ve got these different cell types.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got neurons, you&rsquo;ve got muscle.</p>
<p>They need to collaborate in order to generate effort</p>
<p>or to make the decision to do something or to think hard</p>
<p>or to run hard or to run far.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got fuel sources,</p>
<p>both in the neurons, in the muscle, in your blood.</p>
<p>And then the heart and lungs</p>
<p>are going to help distribute the oxygen and those fuels.</p>
<p>And of course you have that little energy pack</p>
<p>that we call the liver that will allow you</p>
<p>to pull out a little more carbohydrate</p>
<p>if you need it for work.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s as much as I want to cover</p>
<p>about energy consumption because that&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>But what it tells you is that when you eat</p>
<p>and you use food as a fuel source,</p>
<p>that food can be broken down</p>
<p>and you can immediately burn the glucose</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in your bloodstream,</p>
<p>or you can rely on some of the stored fuel in your liver,</p>
<p>or you can rely on stored fuel in the muscle,</p>
<p>so-called glycogen.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of different ways</p>
<p>that we can generate ATP.</p>
<p>So when we ask the question,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s limiting for performance?</p>
<p>What is going to allow us to endure,</p>
<p>to engage in effort and endure long bouts of effort,</p>
<p>or even moderately long bouts of effort?</p>
<p>We need to ask which of those things,</p>
<p>nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs is limiting.</p>
<p>Or put differently,</p>
<p>we ask what should we be doing with our neurons?</p>
<p>What should we be doing with our muscles?</p>
<p>What should we be doing with our blood?</p>
<p>What should we be doing with our heart?</p>
<p>And what should we be doing with our lungs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to allow us to build endurance</p>
<p>for mental and physical work</p>
<p>and to be able to go longer, further with more intensity?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real question.</p>
<p>How can we do more work?</p>
<p>And the way we do that is with energy.</p>
<p>And the way to get energy to it is by those five things.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>how you can actually build different types of endurance</p>
<p>and what that does at the level of your blood,</p>
<p>your heart, your muscles, and your neurons.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to skip back and forth</p>
<p>between protocols, tools, and the underlying science.</p>
<p>So rather than heavy stack the science at the front end</p>
<p>and then just give you all the tools at the end,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about the protocols,</p>
<p>the four kinds of endurance and how to achieve them.</p>
<p>And we are going to talk about the underlying science</p>
<p>as we move through that.</p>
<p>If you would like a lot of detailed science,</p>
<p>I encourage you to check out a review</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve linked in the show notes.</p>
<p>And the review is called</p>
<p>Adaptations to Endurance and Strength Training.</p>
<p>This is a review article with many excellent citations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine.</p>
<p>The Cold Spring Harbor Press</p>
<p>is an excellent scientific press.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been the last 21 years,</p>
<p>doing summers at Cold Spring Harbor, teaching neuroscience.</p>
<p>But Cold Spring Harbor is involved</p>
<p>in all sorts of themes and topics</p>
<p>related to neuroscience and medicine.</p>
<p>This review by Hughes Eliphason,</p>
<p>Eliphason, that&rsquo;s the name, Eliphason and Barr, B-A-A-R,</p>
<p>Adaptations to Endurance and Strength Training,</p>
<p>is rich with citations.</p>
<p>It can be downloaded as a complete PDF.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no paywall and we will link to it.</p>
<p>And it gets really deep into all the signaling cascades,</p>
<p>the genetic changes within muscle</p>
<p>with high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>short-term super high intensity training, weight training.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a real nerd for this stuff</p>
<p>and you want to get right down into how PGC-1-alpha,</p>
<p>P53 and PH20 change the adaptation features</p>
<p>of muscle and gene regulation,</p>
<p>that is definitely the review for you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like most people</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not really interested in that level of detail,</p>
<p>no reason to pick up the review</p>
<p>unless you just want to check out</p>
<p>some of the figures and pictures.</p>
<p>But I do want to offer that as a resource.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been, in addition to discussions with Dr. Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a primary resource</p>
<p>for the content of this episode.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the four kinds of endurance</p>
<p>and how to achieve those.</p>
<p>I do believe that everybody should have</p>
<p>some sort of endurance practice,</p>
<p>regular endurance practice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that it&rsquo;s vital for the functioning of the body</p>
<p>and the mind, and there are clear longevity benefits.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but the main one is that</p>
<p>if we have good energy utilization in our musculature</p>
<p>and in our blood, in our vascular system,</p>
<p>and in our oxygenating system, our lungs,</p>
<p>the so-called cardiovascular system,</p>
<p>respiratory system, and musculature,</p>
<p>the body and brain function much better.</p>
<p>There are so many papers now, so much data to support that.</p>
<p>So I do believe everyone should either try</p>
<p>to maintain the muscle that they have,</p>
<p>provided they&rsquo;ve already gone through puberty</p>
<p>and development, and they should be engaged</p>
<p>in regular endurance exercise.</p>
<p>Now, for many people, they think endurance exercise,</p>
<p>that means what, an hour-long run,</p>
<p>or I got to get on the Stairmaster,</p>
<p>or I have to treadmill for hours on end each week.</p>
<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>There are four kinds of endurance,</p>
<p>and you can train specifically for any one of those,</p>
<p>and you can vary your training.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about those four kinds of endurance,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re very interesting,</p>
<p>and they each have very different protocols</p>
<p>that you use in order to build and maximize them,</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;ll understand what fuel sources they use</p>
<p>in order to build that thing we call endurance.</p>
<p>So first of all, we have muscular endurance.</p>
<p>Muscular endurance is the ability for our muscles</p>
<p>to perform work over time,</p>
<p>and our failure to continue to be able to perform that work</p>
<p>is going to be due to muscular fatigue,</p>
<p>not to cardiovascular fatigue.</p>
<p>So not because we&rsquo;re breathing too hard,</p>
<p>or we can&rsquo;t get enough blood to the muscles,</p>
<p>or because we quit mentally,</p>
<p>but because the muscles themselves give out, okay?</p>
<p>One good example of this would be</p>
<p>if you had to pick up a stone in the yard,</p>
<p>and that stone is not extremely heavy for you,</p>
<p>and you needed to do that anywhere from 50 to 100 times,</p>
<p>and you were picking it up and putting it down,</p>
<p>and picking it up and putting it down,</p>
<p>and picking up and putting it down,</p>
<p>at some point, your muscles will fatigue,</p>
<p>they will fail to endure.</p>
<p>Muscular endurance is incredibly useful</p>
<p>for a variety of physical pursuits,</p>
<p>and we will talk about the mental pursuits</p>
<p>that it supports as well.</p>
<p>In terms of physical pursuits,</p>
<p>the ability for a given muscle to perform repeated work</p>
<p>is going to improve your golf swing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to improve your tennis swing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to improve your posture, your ability to dance,</p>
<p>your ability to repeatedly engage in an activity</p>
<p>that requires effort in a way that&rsquo;s very different</p>
<p>from the kind of endurance that you will build</p>
<p>simply by increasing your cardiovascular fitness,</p>
<p>your ability to generate kind of easy repetition.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about muscular endurance and what it is.</p>
<p>Muscular endurance is going to be something</p>
<p>that you can perform for anywhere from 12 to 25,</p>
<p>or even up to 100 repetitions,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually how, if you like,</p>
<p>you would train muscular endurance,</p>
<p>and I will give the specific protocol in a few moments.</p>
<p>So a good example is pushups, right?</p>
<p>If you were to get on the floor and start doing pushups,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re somebody who has to do knees down pushups,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing your pushups,</p>
<p>eventually you won&rsquo;t be able to do any more pushups,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>because you couldn&rsquo;t get enough oxygen into your system</p>
<p>or your heart wasn&rsquo;t pumping enough blood,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be because the muscles fail, that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>So if you want to be able to do more pushups</p>
<p>or even more pull-ups,</p>
<p>muscular endurance is really what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually no coincidence</p>
<p>that a lot of military bootcamp style training</p>
<p>is not done with weights,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done with things like pushups, pull-ups,</p>
<p>sit-ups, and running,</p>
<p>because what they&rsquo;re really building is muscular endurance,</p>
<p>the ability to perform work repeatedly over time</p>
<p>for a given set of muscles and neurons.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a good protocol to build muscular endurance?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just give that to you now</p>
<p>and explain some of the underlying science as it follows.</p>
<p>So a really good muscular endurance training protocol,</p>
<p>according to the scientific literature,</p>
<p>would be three to five sets</p>
<p>of anywhere from 12 to 100 repetitions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge range.</p>
<p>Now, 12 to 25 repetitions</p>
<p>is going to be more reasonable for most people.</p>
<p>And the rest periods are going to be</p>
<p>anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds of rest.</p>
<p>So anywhere from half a minute to three minutes of rest.</p>
<p>So this might be five sets of pushups,</p>
<p>done getting your maximum pushups,</p>
<p>so for some people that might be zero</p>
<p>and you have to do it knees down.</p>
<p>For some people it might be 10 pushups,</p>
<p>for some people it might be 25,</p>
<p>but you could go all the way up to 100,</p>
<p>rest anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds,</p>
<p>and then do your next set for a total of three to five sets.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t actually sound like a ton of work.</p>
<p>The other thing you could do is something like a plank.</p>
<p>A plank position is actually a way</p>
<p>to build muscular endurance, not strength, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it could be used to develop strength,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really about muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So you would do three to five sets of planks.</p>
<p>Those planks would probably,</p>
<p>even because you&rsquo;re not doing repetitions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an isometric hold, as we say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of static hold,</p>
<p>or a wall sit would be another example.</p>
<p>And you would do that probably for a minute or two minutes,</p>
<p>take some rest of anywhere from 30 to 60 or 180 seconds,</p>
<p>and then repeat.</p>
<p>So things like pushing a sled, pushups, isometric planks,</p>
<p>even pull-ups, those will all work.</p>
<p>And as with other forms of training,</p>
<p>you would want to do this until you approach failure</p>
<p>or actually fail,</p>
<p>and where you&rsquo;re unable to perform another repetition,</p>
<p>that would mark the end of a set.</p>
<p>The one critical feature of building muscular endurance</p>
<p>is that it has no major eccentric loading component.</p>
<p>Now, I haven&rsquo;t talked much about eccentric</p>
<p>and concentric loading,</p>
<p>but concentric loading</p>
<p>is when you are shortening the muscle, typically,</p>
<p>or lifting a weight,</p>
<p>and eccentric movements</p>
<p>are when you are lengthening a muscle, typically,</p>
<p>or lowering a weight.</p>
<p>So if you do a pull-up</p>
<p>and you get your chin over the bar or a chin-up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the concentric portion of the effort.</p>
<p>And then as you lower yourself,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the eccentric portion.</p>
<p>Eccentric portion of resistance training of any kind,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s for endurance or for strength,</p>
<p>is one of the major causes of soreness.</p>
<p>Some people will be more susceptible to this, excuse me,</p>
<p>than others,</p>
<p>but it does create more damage in muscle fibers.</p>
<p>Muscular endurance and building muscular endurance</p>
<p>should not include any movements</p>
<p>that include major eccentric loads.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to do push-ups,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you want to drop,</p>
<p>you know, smash your chest into the floor.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>your chest should touch the ground on every push-up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real push-up, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about breaking 90 with the elbows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about pushing down till your chest touch the floor</p>
<p>and straightening out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a proper push-up.</p>
<p>And a pull-up is where you pull your chin above the bar.</p>
<p>Neither of those should include a slow eccentric</p>
<p>or lowering component.</p>
<p>If you are using those to train muscular endurance,</p>
<p>the three to five sets of 12 to 25,</p>
<p>and maybe even up to a hundred repetitions</p>
<p>with 30 to 180 seconds of rest in between.</p>
<p>That means that jumping also is going to be a very poor tool</p>
<p>for building muscular endurance</p>
<p>because jumping has a slowing down component as you land.</p>
<p>So things like plyometrics or agility work</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re moving from side to side</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re decelerating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re slowing yourself down a lot,</p>
<p>not going to be good for muscular endurance.</p>
<p>Terrific for cardiovascular training</p>
<p>and conditioning of other kinds</p>
<p>and skill training and agility and all that.</p>
<p>But if you want to build muscular endurance,</p>
<p>you want to make your muscles able</p>
<p>to do more work for longer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be this three to five sets</p>
<p>of 12 to a hundred reps,</p>
<p>30 to 180 seconds of mainly concentric movement, okay?</p>
<p>Not a slow lowering phase or a heavy lowering phase.</p>
<p>So that might be kettlebell swings</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Isometrics, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>things like plank and wall sits will work.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about this</p>
<p>is that it doesn&rsquo;t seem at all</p>
<p>like what people normally think of as endurance.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s been shown</p>
<p>in nice quality peer reviewed studies,</p>
<p>several of which are cited in the review</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>that muscular endurance can improve our ability</p>
<p>to engage in long bouts of what we call long duration,</p>
<p>low intensity endurance work.</p>
<p>So this can support long runs,</p>
<p>it can support long swims,</p>
<p>and it can build also,</p>
<p>it can build postural strength</p>
<p>and endurance simultaneously.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s mainly accomplished through isometric hold.</p>
<p>So things like planks are actually quite good</p>
<p>for building endurance of the spinal erector muscles</p>
<p>that provide posture of the abdominal muscles</p>
<p>that are helpful for posture,</p>
<p>for being upright,</p>
<p>for the upper neck muscles and things of that sort.</p>
<p>These days, everyone seems to have text neck.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s basically staring at their toes all the time.</p>
<p>It has a default towards their toes.</p>
<p>So isometric holds can be very good</p>
<p>for building muscular endurance.</p>
<p>You can spot people, including yourself,</p>
<p>perhaps with poor muscular endurance</p>
<p>in the postural muscles,</p>
<p>because anytime they stop moving,</p>
<p>they have to lean against a wall</p>
<p>or their hip will move to one side</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re always lean to one side.</p>
<p>I am guilty of this too.</p>
<p>Some of you have actually pointed out,</p>
<p>I like to think out of concern</p>
<p>that I often am rubbing my lower back.</p>
<p>And indeed I have some asymmetries in my postural muscles,</p>
<p>some of which are probably genetic</p>
<p>and some of which are probably just from excessive work</p>
<p>or something of that sort</p>
<p>that have my right shoulder sit lower than my left</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>If I wanted to improve those,</p>
<p>I could improve those by really focusing on symmetry</p>
<p>and isometric symmetry,</p>
<p>meaning holding my hands at equivalent positions in planks</p>
<p>and doing isometric holds</p>
<p>for building muscular endurance of the postural muscles.</p>
<p>But this can also be done with, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>kettlebell swings for the lower back and legs</p>
<p>and posterior chain.</p>
<p>So there are a number of different exercise</p>
<p>you could do this with,</p>
<p>but it should be compound exercises mainly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare for people to do</p>
<p>this kind of muscular endurance work</p>
<p>specifically for things like bicep curls or triceps.</p>
<p>And there aren&rsquo;t many activities</p>
<p>that really rely on isolation of those muscles repeatedly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are some out there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of hard to imagine.</p>
<p>So you can do this with isometrics,</p>
<p>you can do this with more standard</p>
<p>non-isometric type movements,</p>
<p>but make sure there isn&rsquo;t a strong eccentric load.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about the science briefly</p>
<p>of why this works.</p>
<p>Well, that takes us back to this issue of fuel utilization</p>
<p>and what fails.</p>
<p>So if we were to say, okay, let&rsquo;s say you do a plank</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re planking for, you know,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re able to plank for a minute or two minutes</p>
<p>or three minutes, at some point you will fail.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to fail because the heart gives out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to fail</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t get enough oxygen</p>
<p>because you can breathe while you&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to fail because of local muscular failure,</p>
<p>which means that as you do,</p>
<p>if you choose to do this protocol of three to five sets,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, to build muscular endurance,</p>
<p>mainly what you are going to be building</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re going to be building the ability</p>
<p>of your mitochondria to use oxygen</p>
<p>to generate energy locally.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s something called mitochondrial respiration,</p>
<p>because of the involvement of oxygen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also going to be increasing the extent</p>
<p>to which the neurons control the muscles</p>
<p>and provide a stimulus for the muscles to contract.</p>
<p>But this is independent of power and strength, okay?</p>
<p>So even though the low sets, like three to five sets,</p>
<p>and the fact that you&rsquo;re doing repetitions</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to failure,</p>
<p>even though it seems to resemble power and strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy type training,</p>
<p>it is distinctly different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to generate strength, hypertrophy, and power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to mainly create this ability to endure,</p>
<p>to continually contract muscles</p>
<p>or repeatedly contract muscles, okay?</p>
<p>Continually, if you&rsquo;re using isometric holds,</p>
<p>repeatedly, excuse me,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re using repetition type exercise,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a contraction and an extension of the muscle,</p>
<p>essentially concentric and an eccentric portion.</p>
<p>But remember that you want the eccentric portion</p>
<p>to be light and relatively fast,</p>
<p>not so fast that you injure yourself,</p>
<p>but certainly not deliberately slowed down.</p>
<p>It was recommended, I should say, by Andy Galpin</p>
<p>that you not use Olympic lifts for this,</p>
<p>because once you get past eight or 12 or 25 repetitions,</p>
<p>especially form on those Olympic lifts</p>
<p>is key for not getting injured.</p>
<p>And while some people can perform those sorts of lifts,</p>
<p>like snatches and deadlifts and cleans and jerks</p>
<p>and overhead presses, probably not a great idea</p>
<p>if the goal is to push the body to points of fatigue,</p>
<p>because you do open yourself up to injury,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re very skilled at doing that,</p>
<p>or you have a really good coach</p>
<p>who can help you guide through those lifts.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one form of endurance,</p>
<p>which is muscular endurance,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s mainly going to rely on neural energy,</p>
<p>so nerves and muscle.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not going to rely quite so much</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s available in your blood,</p>
<p>your heart, or your lungs.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about the other extreme of endurance,</p>
<p>which is long duration endurance.</p>
<p>This is the type that people typically think about</p>
<p>when they think about endurance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about a long run, a long swim,</p>
<p>a long bike ride.</p>
<p>Well, how long?</p>
<p>Well, anywhere from 12 minutes to several hours,</p>
<p>or maybe even an entire day,</p>
<p>maybe eight or nine hours of hiking or running or biking.</p>
<p>Some people are actually doing</p>
<p>those kinds of really long events,</p>
<p>marathons, for instance.</p>
<p>So anything longer than 12 minutes.</p>
<p>And this type of work builds on fuel utilization</p>
<p>in the muscles.</p>
<p>It builds on the activity of neurons in the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in what we call</p>
<p>central pattern generators.</p>
<p>We talked about this in a previous episode,</p>
<p>or several previous episodes.</p>
<p>These are groups of neurons that allow our body</p>
<p>to engage in regular rhythmic effort</p>
<p>without having to think about the movement too much.</p>
<p>So running and stepping,</p>
<p>or swimming if you already know how to swim,</p>
<p>or pedaling on a bike,</p>
<p>or walking upstairs and hiking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not thinking about right, left, right, left.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all carried out by central pattern generators.</p>
<p>This is going to be at less than 100%</p>
<p>of your maximum oxygen uptake, your VO2 max.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about what VO2 max is,</p>
<p>but I just want to give a sense of what the protocol is</p>
<p>and the underlying science.</p>
<p>How many sets?</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Long duration effort is one set of 12 minutes or longer.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not counting repetitions.</p>
<p>I sure hope that if you&rsquo;re going out on a 30 minute run,</p>
<p>or even a 15 minute run, that you&rsquo;re not counting steps,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not counting pedal strokes,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not on the rower counting pulls on the rower.</p>
<p>I suppose you could,</p>
<p>but I think that would be pretty dreadful.</p>
<p>Seems like a poor utilization of cognitive brain space.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting into regular repeated effort,</p>
<p>and your ability to continue that effort</p>
<p>is going to be dependent mainly</p>
<p>on the efficiency of the movement,</p>
<p>on your ability to strike a balance</p>
<p>between the movement itself,</p>
<p>the generation of the muscular movements that are required,</p>
<p>and fuel utilization across the different sources</p>
<p>of nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s ask the question,</p>
<p>why would you fail on a long run?</p>
<p>Why would you quit?</p>
<p>Well, as you set out on that long run,</p>
<p>assuming you have some glycogen in your liver</p>
<p>and in your muscles,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to use that energy first,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s very low intensity.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re not talking about sprinting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about heading out the door</p>
<p>or starting off on a marathon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to,</p>
<p>assuming you have some conditioning,</p>
<p>or even if you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re going to burn carbohydrate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to burn glucose in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to burn carbohydrate</p>
<p>as those muscles contract,</p>
<p>those what we call slow twitch muscles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re contracting.</p>
<p>You start burning up fuel to make ATP</p>
<p>to continue to contract.</p>
<p>Your mind is going to use more or less energy</p>
<p>depending on how much willpower,</p>
<p>how much of a fight you have to get into with yourself</p>
<p>in order to generate the effort.</p>
<p>I really want to underscore this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody that&rsquo;s thinking,</p>
<p>maybe I go for the run,</p>
<p>maybe I don&rsquo;t go for the run.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do it at two o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Okay, 205.</p>
<p>No, I only want to go on the half hour</p>
<p>or maybe on the main hour.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going through all that.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re burning up useful energy</p>
<p>that you could use either for the run,</p>
<p>for example, or for something else.</p>
<p>When we think about something hard,</p>
<p>when we ruminate,</p>
<p>when we perseverate on an idea or on a decision,</p>
<p>we are burning neural energy</p>
<p>and neural energy is glucose and epinephrine</p>
<p>and all the things we talked about before.</p>
<p>So willpower in part is the ability to devote resources</p>
<p>to things and part of that is making decisions</p>
<p>to just either do it or not do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not of the just do it mindset.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a right time and a place to train,</p>
<p>but I also think that it is not good.</p>
<p>In other words, it utilizes excessive resources</p>
<p>to churn over decisions excessively.</p>
<p>And you probably burn as much cognitive energy</p>
<p>deciding about whether or not to do a given training</p>
<p>or not as you do in the actual training.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk more about how this long duration effort</p>
<p>can relate to mental performance,</p>
<p>but the long duration effort should be one set,</p>
<p>12 minutes or longer.</p>
<p>It could go for 30 minutes or 60 minutes or an hour.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about programming later in the episode.</p>
<p>This is going to be less than 100%</p>
<p>of your maximum oxygen uptake.</p>
<p>Your heart rate is not going to be through the ceiling</p>
<p>or maxed out,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all about efficiency of movement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>When you go out for a run that&rsquo;s 30 minutes,</p>
<p>you are building the capacity to repeat that performance</p>
<p>the next time while being more efficient,</p>
<p>actually burning less fuel.</p>
<p>And that might seem a little bit counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but every time you do that run,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re building up</p>
<p>mitochondrial density.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much about mitochondrial oxidation</p>
<p>and respiration.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re building up mitochondrial density.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually increasing the amount of ATP</p>
<p>that you can create for a given bout of effort.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re becoming more efficient, okay?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re burning less fuel overall, doing the same thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what these long, slow distance</p>
<p>or long bouts of effort are really all about.</p>
<p>Now, why do this long duration effort?</p>
<p>Why would you want to do it?</p>
<p>Why is it good for you?</p>
<p>Well, it does something very important,</p>
<p>which is that it builds the capillary beds within muscles.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about vasculature.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done this too much yet,</p>
<p>but if you have seen the episode</p>
<p>on supercharging performance, we talked about AVAs,</p>
<p>these arteriovenous asthmosis,</p>
<p>where blood moves from arteries directly into veins,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s unusual.</p>
<p>That only takes place in the so-called glabrous skin</p>
<p>of the palms, the face, and the bottoms of the feet.</p>
<p>Typically, for most all other areas of the body,</p>
<p>what happens is arteries bring blood</p>
<p>to a given tissue, like a muscle,</p>
<p>and veins return that blood back to the heart.</p>
<p>There are exceptions, but in general.</p>
<p>And in between arteries and veins are these little tiny,</p>
<p>what are called capillary beds or microcapillaries.</p>
<p>So these are tiny little avenues,</p>
<p>like little tiny streams and estuaries</p>
<p>between the bigger arteries and veins.</p>
<p>Now, those are actually contained within muscle.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s amazing is that you can increase</p>
<p>the number of them.</p>
<p>You can literally build new capillaries.</p>
<p>You can create new little streams within your muscles.</p>
<p>And the type of long duration effort</p>
<p>that I was talking about before,</p>
<p>12 minutes or more of steady effort,</p>
<p>is very useful for doing that,</p>
<p>and is very useful for increasing the mitochondria,</p>
<p>the energy producing elements of the cells,</p>
<p>the actual muscle cells.</p>
<p>And the reason is when blood arrives to muscles,</p>
<p>it has oxygen.</p>
<p>The muscles are going to use some of that oxygen,</p>
<p>and then some of the deoxygenated blood</p>
<p>is going to be sent back to the heart and to the lungs.</p>
<p>Now, the more capillaries that you build into those muscles,</p>
<p>the more oxygen available to those muscles.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get too much into the physics</p>
<p>of fluid flow, but basically it&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between taking a hose and sticking it into some dirt</p>
<p>just directly, and turning on the faucet at a given rate,</p>
<p>the spigot rather, or having a bunch of little hoses,</p>
<p>like a sprinkler system that go out</p>
<p>and irrigate the whole yard.</p>
<p>The irrigation is equivalent to this capillary bed system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very good at using energy sources within blood.</p>
<p>So the simple way to think about this</p>
<p>is when you go out for a run,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s the first run you&rsquo;ve done for a while,</p>
<p>and you go out for 12 or 15 minutes,</p>
<p>and somewhere right around 20 minutes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s it, I just can&rsquo;t continue.</p>
<p>Well, when you come back the next time to do that run,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve built endurance,</p>
<p>largely because you&rsquo;ve built these capillary beds.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve expanded these little streams</p>
<p>in which blood can deliver oxygen to the muscles.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s going to feel relatively straightforward</p>
<p>to either go a little bit quicker for the same duration,</p>
<p>the same distance,</p>
<p>or to extend that run for another five to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>So this long duration work,</p>
<p>unlike muscular endurance like planks</p>
<p>and everything that we were talking about before,</p>
<p>is really about building the capillary systems</p>
<p>and the mitochondria,</p>
<p>the energy utilization systems</p>
<p>within the muscles themselves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very important to understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s distinctly different than say,</p>
<p>building the neurons that fire the muscles.</p>
<p>The neurons are already there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to fire those muscles just fine.</p>
<p>In fact, if your life depended on it today,</p>
<p>you could probably run a marathon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably get injured.</p>
<p>It would be very psychologically and physically painful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend you do that unless you&rsquo;re trained for it.</p>
<p>But if you were to train properly for it,</p>
<p>if you were to do long duration bouts of effort</p>
<p>once or twice a week, or three times a week,</p>
<p>pretty soon it would become easy</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re building these vascular microbeds</p>
<p>or microvascular beds as they&rsquo;re called.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re able to bring more energy to the muscles</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re able to utilize more energy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s long duration.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got muscular endurance</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got long duration endurance.</p>
<p>And then there are two kinds in between</p>
<p>that in recent years have gotten a lot of attention</p>
<p>and excitement, but most people are not distinguishing</p>
<p>between these two kinds of endurance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a shame because in failing to distinguish</p>
<p>between the two kinds of what we call</p>
<p>high intensity training,</p>
<p>sometimes called high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>most people, perhaps you,</p>
<p>are not getting nearly as much physical</p>
<p>and mental benefit out of high intensity training</p>
<p>as you could.</p>
<p>So I want to talk about the two kinds</p>
<p>of high intensity interval training</p>
<p>and what each of them does for your brain and body</p>
<p>and what sorts of adaptations they cause.</p>
<p>Because in doing that, you can really start</p>
<p>to build up specific energy systems in your brain and body</p>
<p>in ways that are best serve you for your cognitive work</p>
<p>and for other sorts of things</p>
<p>like strength and speed or hypertrophy</p>
<p>or for running marathons for that matter.</p>
<p>So there are two kinds of high intensity training</p>
<p>for endurance, sometimes called</p>
<p>high intensity interval training.</p>
<p>One is anaerobic, so-called anaerobic endurance,</p>
<p>so no oxygen, and the other is aerobic endurance,</p>
<p>both of which qualify as HIIT,</p>
<p>high intensity interval training.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about anaerobic endurance first.</p>
<p>Anaerobic endurance from a protocol perspective</p>
<p>is going to be three to 12 sets, okay?</p>
<p>And these repetitions,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about what the repetitions are,</p>
<p>are going to be performed at whatever speed allows you</p>
<p>to complete the work in good, safe form, okay?</p>
<p>So it could be fast, it could be slow.</p>
<p>As the work continues, your repetitions may slow down</p>
<p>or it may speed up, chances are it&rsquo;s going to slow down.</p>
<p>So what does this work, what do these sets look like?</p>
<p>Remember, long, slow distance is one set.</p>
<p>Muscular endurance is three to five sets.</p>
<p>High intensity anaerobic endurance</p>
<p>is going to be somewhere between three and 12 sets.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to have a ratio of work to rest</p>
<p>of anywhere from three to one to one to five, okay?</p>
<p>So what would a three to one ratio set look like?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s going to be 30 seconds</p>
<p>of hard pedaling on the bike, for instance,</p>
<p>or running, or on the rower.</p>
<p>These are just examples.</p>
<p>It could be in the pool swimming,</p>
<p>it could be any number of things,</p>
<p>or air squats, or weighted squats, if you will,</p>
<p>provided you can manage that.</p>
<p>30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very brief rest.</p>
<p>So three to one is just a good example,</p>
<p>would be 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.</p>
<p>The opposite extreme on that ratio would be one to five,</p>
<p>so 20 seconds on, 100 seconds off.</p>
<p>So you do the work for 20 seconds,</p>
<p>then you rest 100 seconds.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>Should you do three to one ratio,</p>
<p>so 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off,</p>
<p>or should you do one to five,</p>
<p>20 seconds on to 100 seconds off?</p>
<p>Well, that will depend on whether or not</p>
<p>the quality of the movement is important to you.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just take a look at the three to one ratio.</p>
<p>So in the three to one ratio,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to do 30 seconds</p>
<p>of hard pedaling on a bike, followed by 10 seconds,</p>
<p>so maybe one of these, what they call assault bikes,</p>
<p>and then you stop for 10 seconds and then repeat,</p>
<p>chances are you will be able to do one, two, three, four,</p>
<p>maybe even as many as 12 sets</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really in good condition,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll be able to do all those</p>
<p>because pedaling on the bike doesn&rsquo;t require a ton of skill.</p>
<p>And if you do it incorrectly,</p>
<p>if your elbow flares out a little bit or something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very unlikely that you&rsquo;ll get injured</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s really extreme, okay?</p>
<p>But the same movement done, for instance, with kettlebells,</p>
<p>so 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off,</p>
<p>the first set will probably be in good form.</p>
<p>The second one will be in pretty good form,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re getting to the fifth and sixth set</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off,</p>
<p>chances are the quality of your repetitions</p>
<p>will degrade significantly</p>
<p>and you increase the probability</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to get injured</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;re going to damage yourself in some way</p>
<p>or that you can&rsquo;t complete the movement</p>
<p>or that some smaller muscles,</p>
<p>like your grip muscles might give out, okay?</p>
<p>So the quality of repetitions is going to drop considerably</p>
<p>with the three-to-one approach.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just doing it for effort,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about what this builds in your system</p>
<p>in a moment, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But for most people, if quality of form is important,</p>
<p>so maybe this is using weights, maybe you&rsquo;re doing squats,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going to do 20 seconds on</p>
<p>and 100 seconds of rest.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s even a barbell loaded squat,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re doing kettlebells,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ve got some other resistance there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s allowing you to do this.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll find is that the longer rest,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s 20 seconds of intense effort</p>
<p>followed by a longer rest of about 100 seconds</p>
<p>will allow you to perform more quality repetitions</p>
<p>safely over time.</p>
<p>So what does building anaerobic endurance look like?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll tell you what it&rsquo;s actually good for</p>
<p>in the true practical sense.</p>
<p>What anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like</p>
<p>is that if you decide to do this for the first week,</p>
<p>you might do this two or three times a week,</p>
<p>maybe even just once a week,</p>
<p>depending on the other things you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about programming at the end.</p>
<p>And you would generate just three sets.</p>
<p>So it might be three sets of 20 seconds of hard effort</p>
<p>followed by 100 seconds rest.</p>
<p>Then you repeat 20 seconds of hard effort,</p>
<p>100 seconds rest, 20 seconds of hard, 100 seconds rest.</p>
<p>And you might do that twice a week.</p>
<p>And then each week you&rsquo;re adding one or two sets.</p>
<p>Okay, in doing that,</p>
<p>you will build up what we call anaerobic endurance.</p>
<p>What is anaerobic endurance?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s ask why we fail.</p>
<p>Anaerobic endurance is going to be taking your system</p>
<p>into greater than 100% of your VO2 max.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be taking your heart rate up very high,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to maximize your oxygen utilization systems.</p>
<p>That is going to have effects</p>
<p>that are going to lead to fatigue</p>
<p>at some point in the workout.</p>
<p>And that fatigue will trigger an adaptation.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s ask what adaptation it&rsquo;s triggering.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s triggering both mitochondrial respiration,</p>
<p>the ability of your mitochondria to generate more energy</p>
<p>by using more oxygen because you&rsquo;re bringing so,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re maxing out,</p>
<p>literally you&rsquo;re getting above your VO2 max.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hitting that threshold</p>
<p>of how much oxygen you can use in your system.</p>
<p>One of the adaptations will be that your mitochondria</p>
<p>will shift such that they can use more oxygen.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to also increase the capillary beds,</p>
<p>but not as much as you&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to increase the amount of neuron engagement of muscle.</p>
<p>So normally when we start to hit fatigue,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re exhausted, when we&rsquo;re breathing really hard,</p>
<p>because the systems of the body are linked</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a mental component to this as well,</p>
<p>a kind of motivational component.</p>
<p>After that third or fourth or sixth set of 20 seconds on,</p>
<p>100 seconds off,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re at the other extreme,</p>
<p>30 seconds on and 10 seconds off,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a component of you want to stop</p>
<p>and by pushing through and repeating another set safely,</p>
<p>of course, what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re training the neurons</p>
<p>to be able to access more energy,</p>
<p>literally convert that into ATP and for the muscles,</p>
<p>therefore to access more energy and ATP.</p>
<p>And the adaptation is in the mitochondria&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to use oxygen.</p>
<p>And this has tremendous carryover effects</p>
<p>for other types of exercise.</p>
<p>So while I know and appreciate that people are using</p>
<p>high intensity interval training of this kind or similar</p>
<p>in order to just like burn fat,</p>
<p>do their workouts, quote unquote,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very useful for building a capacity</p>
<p>to engage in short bouts of effort repeatedly,</p>
<p>to really lock in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to use the word focus</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not strictly mental focus,</p>
<p>but to be able to generate short bouts of very intense work.</p>
<p>This can be beneficial in competitive sports or team sports</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a sprinting component,</p>
<p>where the field opens up and you need to dribble the ball</p>
<p>down the field, for instance, and shoot on goal,</p>
<p>or where you&rsquo;re playing tennis and it&rsquo;s a long rally</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden somebody really starts</p>
<p>putting you back on your heels</p>
<p>and you have to really make the maximum amount of effort</p>
<p>to run to the net and to get the ball across that,</p>
<p>things of that sort, okay?</p>
<p>There are a variety of places where there&rsquo;s carryover</p>
<p>from this type of training, but it does support endurance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about muscle endurance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about these muscles&rsquo; ability to generate</p>
<p>a lot of force in the short term, but repeatedly, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way to conceptualize this.</p>
<p>And it is different than maximum power.</p>
<p>Even though it feels like maximum effort,</p>
<p>it is not the same as building power</p>
<p>and speed into muscles.</p>
<p>Those are distinctly different protocols.</p>
<p>So the key elements again are that you&rsquo;re bringing</p>
<p>your breathing and your oxygen utilization</p>
<p>way up above your max.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite hitting failure,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re really pushing the system to the point</p>
<p>where you are not ready to do another set</p>
<p>and yet you begin another set.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not necessarily psychologically ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk more about some of the adaptations</p>
<p>that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes</p>
<p>when we talk about how it is that work of this sort</p>
<p>can increase our heart&rsquo;s ability to deliver blood</p>
<p>and oxygen to our lungs and other tissues.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get very specific about how to breathe</p>
<p>during these different types of protocols</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s happening at the level of the heart,</p>
<p>but I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol,</p>
<p>which is high-intensity aerobic conditioning.</p>
<p>So HIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic,</p>
<p>and you just heard about anaerobic.</p>
<p>High-intensity aerobic conditioning</p>
<p>also involves about three to 12 sets,</p>
<p>starting off of course with fewer sets</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re getting into this training</p>
<p>and then extending into more sets</p>
<p>as one parameter you could expand.</p>
<p>Has again, the same ratio of three to one,</p>
<p>so 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off, or one to five,</p>
<p>20 seconds on, 100 seconds off,</p>
<p>or a very powerful tool for building up aerobic conditioning</p>
<p>is a one-to-one ratio.</p>
<p>A one-to-one ratio is powerful for building on average</p>
<p>most of the energy systems involving,</p>
<p>remember we had these nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs,</p>
<p>a one-to-one ratio might be you run a mile</p>
<p>and however long that takes,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it takes you six minutes or seven minutes,</p>
<p>then you rest for an equivalent amount of time,</p>
<p>then you repeat and then you rest</p>
<p>for an equivalent amount of time.</p>
<p>So you might run first mile as let&rsquo;s say seven minutes,</p>
<p>then you rest for seven minutes,</p>
<p>then you run a mile again and it might take eight minutes</p>
<p>and you rest for eight minutes.</p>
<p>And you continue that for a total of four miles of work,</p>
<p>for four miles of running work, I should say,</p>
<p>or seven miles of work.</p>
<p>You can build this up.</p>
<p>Many people find that using this type of training</p>
<p>allows them to do things like go run half marathons</p>
<p>and marathons, even though prior to the race date,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve never actually run a half marathon or marathon.</p>
<p>Now that might seem incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how could it be that running a mile on</p>
<p>and then resting for an equivalent amount of time,</p>
<p>running a mile, resting for equivalent amount of time</p>
<p>for seven miles allows you to run continuously for 13 miles</p>
<p>or for 26 miles?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not discouraging people</p>
<p>from ever doing the long duration endurance.</p>
<p>I think that is very important,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because it builds up</p>
<p>so many of these energy utilization systems.</p>
<p>It really teaches you to engage, excuse me,</p>
<p>the nerve to muscle firing.</p>
<p>It improves ATP and mitochondrial function in muscle.</p>
<p>It allows the blood to deliver more oxygen to the muscle</p>
<p>and to your brain.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explain how that is.</p>
<p>And it allows your heart to deliver more oxygen overall.</p>
<p>And it builds a tremendous lung capacity.</p>
<p>And we will talk about exactly how to breathe</p>
<p>and how to build lung capacity,</p>
<p>both for sake of warming up and for performance.</p>
<p>So what would this look like?</p>
<p>And when should you do this?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s really a question for these workouts</p>
<p>of asking how much work can one do</p>
<p>in eight to 12 minutes, right?</p>
<p>And then rest and then repeat.</p>
<p>How much work can you do for eight to 12 minutes</p>
<p>then rest and then repeat?</p>
<p>And how many times should you do this?</p>
<p>Well, this is the sort of thing, it&rsquo;s pretty intense.</p>
<p>And so you would probably only want to do this</p>
<p>two, maybe three times a week</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not doing many other things.</p>
<p>I will talk about how this program can be moved in</p>
<p>with other forms of training,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just give you a little hint now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear and it&rsquo;s described</p>
<p>in the review article referred to,</p>
<p>and we will link another article as well,</p>
<p>that concurrent training, doing strength training</p>
<p>and the endurance training of any of the four kinds</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m describing today can be done.</p>
<p>You can program those in the same week,</p>
<p>but you want to get four and ideally six</p>
<p>or even better 24 hours between these workouts</p>
<p>because it is very hard for instance,</p>
<p>to do a one-to-one mile repeats,</p>
<p>like run a mile, rest for equivalent time,</p>
<p>run a mile, rest for equivalent time,</p>
<p>to do that two or three times a week</p>
<p>and also do weight training before</p>
<p>or do a long run afterwards.</p>
<p>That would quickly lead to breakdown for most people</p>
<p>unless you have very, very good energy utilization systems,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a really kind of advanced or elite athlete</p>
<p>and or dare I say, you&rsquo;re using tools</p>
<p>to enhance your performance at the level of blood</p>
<p>or hormones and I&rsquo;m actually going to talk about those</p>
<p>at the end and why they work.</p>
<p>So we have four kinds of endurance, muscular endurance,</p>
<p>we have long duration endurance,</p>
<p>we have high intensity interval training of two kinds,</p>
<p>anaerobic and aerobic, and this last type,</p>
<p>the aerobic one works best it seems</p>
<p>if you kind of do this one-to-one ratio.</p>
<p>So how would you use these and what are they actually doing?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the heart and the lungs and oxygen</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s something that we can all benefit</p>
<p>from understanding and it will become very clear</p>
<p>in that discussion why this type of training is very useful</p>
<p>even for non-athletes in order to improve oxygenation</p>
<p>and energy utilization of the brain and the heart.</p>
<p>The brain and the heart are probably</p>
<p>the two most important systems that you need</p>
<p>to take care of in your life.</p>
<p>Yes, your musculature needs to be maintained.</p>
<p>If you want to build it, that&rsquo;s up to you</p>
<p>but you should try and maintain your musculature</p>
<p>but maintaining or enhancing a brain function</p>
<p>and cardiovascular function, it&rsquo;s absolutely clear</p>
<p>our key for health and longevity in the short and long term</p>
<p>and the sorts of training I talked about today</p>
<p>has been shown again and again and again to be very useful</p>
<p>for enhancing the strength of the mind,</p>
<p>yes, I&rsquo;ll talk about that,</p>
<p>as well as the health of the brain and the body.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the sorts of adaptations</p>
<p>that are happening in your brain and body</p>
<p>that are so beneficial in these different forms of training.</p>
<p>If you are breathing hard and your heart is beating hard,</p>
<p>so this would be certainly in the high-intensity</p>
<p>anaerobic and aerobic conditioning</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting up near your VO2 max</p>
<p>in high-intensity aerobic conditioning</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re exceeding your VO2 max</p>
<p>in high-intensity anaerobic conditioning,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen is,</p>
<p>as of course your heart beats faster,</p>
<p>your blood is going to be circulating faster in principle,</p>
<p>oxygen utilization in muscles is going to go up</p>
<p>and over time, not long, very quickly,</p>
<p>what will happen when those capillary beds start to expand,</p>
<p>we talked about that,</p>
<p>but in addition, because of the amount of blood</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being returned to the heart</p>
<p>when you engage in these really intense</p>
<p>bouts of effort repeatedly,</p>
<p>the amount of blood being returned to the heart</p>
<p>actually causes an eccentric loading</p>
<p>of one of the muscular walls of the heart.</p>
<p>So your heart is muscle, it&rsquo;s cardiac muscle.</p>
<p>We have skeletal muscle attached to our bones</p>
<p>and we have cardiac muscle, which is our heart.</p>
<p>When more blood is being returned to the heart</p>
<p>because of the additional work</p>
<p>that your muscles and nerves are doing,</p>
<p>it actually has the effect of creating an eccentric loading,</p>
<p>a kind of pushing of the wall, the left wall.</p>
<p>I realize I&rsquo;m not using the strict anatomy here,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to get into all the features</p>
<p>of the structural features of the heart,</p>
<p>but the left ventricle essentially getting slammed back</p>
<p>and then having to push back</p>
<p>in a kind of eccentric loading of the cardiac muscle</p>
<p>and the muscle thickens,</p>
<p>but not because the heart thickens overall,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a strengthening of the cardiac muscle</p>
<p>in a way that increases what we call stroke volume.</p>
<p>Meaning as more blood is returned to the heart,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an adaptation where the heart muscle</p>
<p>actually gets stronger</p>
<p>and therefore can pump more blood per stroke, per beat.</p>
<p>And as it does that, it delivers,</p>
<p>because blood contains glucose and oxygen and other things,</p>
<p>it delivers more fuel to your muscles,</p>
<p>which allows you to do yet more work per unit time.</p>
<p>Okay, so when we hear that, oh, you know,</p>
<p>so-and-so has a, or maybe you have a nice low heart rate</p>
<p>that, you know, maybe you&rsquo;re one of these</p>
<p>really extreme folks like 30 or 40 beats per minute,</p>
<p>although most people are sitting at 50, 60, 70, 80,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your resting heart rate.</p>
<p>If you exercise regularly</p>
<p>and you do long duration aerobic work,</p>
<p>your heart rate will start to go down,</p>
<p>your resting heart rate.</p>
<p>It will increase the stroke volume of your heart.</p>
<p>If you do this high intensity type training</p>
<p>where your heart is beating very hard,</p>
<p>so maybe the one-to-one ratio mile run repeats</p>
<p>that I described a minute ago,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you do that twice a week for three or four,</p>
<p>and I said it could go all the way up to 12 sets,</p>
<p>which is a lot, I don&rsquo;t recommend people start there.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, the stroke volume of your heart</p>
<p>will really increase, and as a consequence,</p>
<p>you can deliver more fuel to your muscles and to your brain</p>
<p>and you will notice that you can do more work,</p>
<p>meaning you can do the same work you were doing</p>
<p>a few days or weeks ago with relative ease,</p>
<p>your cognitive functioning will improve.</p>
<p>This has been shown again and again</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an increase in vasculature,</p>
<p>literally capillary beds within the brain,</p>
<p>the hippocampus areas that support memory,</p>
<p>but also areas of the brain that support respiration,</p>
<p>that support focus, that support effort.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t often discussed,</p>
<p>but the ability to deliver more blood</p>
<p>and therefore more glucose,</p>
<p>remember neurons run on glucose,</p>
<p>and oxygen to the brain is a big feature</p>
<p>of why exercise of the kind I&rsquo;m describing</p>
<p>helps with brain function.</p>
<p>Now, weight training does have some positive effects</p>
<p>on brain function also.</p>
<p>When I say weight training, I should be more specific,</p>
<p>I really am referring to strength and hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>Strength and hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s of the sort where you get into the burn,</p>
<p>as we talked about last episode,</p>
<p>and you start generating lactate as a hormonal signal</p>
<p>that can benefit your brain, et cetera,</p>
<p>it can have positive effects on the brain.</p>
<p>And frankly, there haven&rsquo;t been as many studies</p>
<p>of resistance training,</p>
<p>strength and hypertrophy training on brain function,</p>
<p>mainly because most of those experiments</p>
<p>are done in mice or primates, non-human primates,</p>
<p>I should say,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to get mice to do resistance training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get humans to do resistance training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely hard to get mice to do resistance training.</p>
<p>There are ways to do it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to get them to do, say,</p>
<p>three sets of eight on the deadlift,</p>
<p>and then do some curls,</p>
<p>and then do some chin-ups, and this kind of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy to get a mouse to run on a treadmill,</p>
<p>and you can set the tension on that treadmill</p>
<p>to make it so that it&rsquo;s easier or harder</p>
<p>for the mouse to turn that wheel.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the reasons.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s very clear,</p>
<p>and you should now understand intuitively</p>
<p>why the kind of standard strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy type workouts</p>
<p>are not going to activate the blood oxygenation</p>
<p>and the stroke volume increases for the heart</p>
<p>that the sorts of training I&rsquo;m talking about today will.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t have the same positive effects.</p>
<p>Now, that isn&rsquo;t to say that if you just weight train</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll be dumb</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;ll lose your memory over time.</p>
<p>You might, but it is to say that endurance work,</p>
<p>in particular, the high-intensity and long-duration work</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked about today,</p>
<p>the two high-intensity protocols and the long-duration work</p>
<p>has been shown again and again and again</p>
<p>to have positive effects on brain function,</p>
<p>not through the addition of new neurons.</p>
<p>Sorry to break it to you,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not a major event</p>
<p>in the exercised or non-exercised human brain</p>
<p>for reasons we can talk about in a future episode,</p>
<p>but it still has many positive effects</p>
<p>through the delivery of things like IGF-1,</p>
<p>but also just through plain oxygenation of the brain</p>
<p>and the way it promotes the development</p>
<p>of microvasculature to deliver neurons more nutrients.</p>
<p>If neurons don&rsquo;t get oxygen and glucose, they do die,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s another fuel source like ketones,</p>
<p>which can replace the glucose.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t give oxygen to neurons,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t deliver enough to them,</p>
<p>you get what&rsquo;s called ischemia, you get little microstrokes.</p>
<p>So the type of exercise I&rsquo;m talking about today</p>
<p>in generating intense heart rate increases,</p>
<p>provided that&rsquo;s safe for you to do,</p>
<p>breathing hard, that&rsquo;s going to deliver oxygen and blood,</p>
<p>increase stroke volume of the heart,</p>
<p>and is going to improve brain function.</p>
<p>This has been supported by many, many</p>
<p>quality peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one form of positive adaptation.</p>
<p>I also talked about just sort of performance adaptations,</p>
<p>how doing high-intensity aerobic conditioning</p>
<p>of the mile repeats type training</p>
<p>can actually improve your ability</p>
<p>to do long bouts of intense work.</p>
<p>It also seems like it dovetails or is compatible</p>
<p>with resistance training that&rsquo;s aimed</p>
<p>towards strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Now, in full disclosure, the data seem to indicate</p>
<p>that if people just weight train or train for strength,</p>
<p>so three reps, rest five minutes,</p>
<p>three reps of heavy weights, et cetera,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;ll get much stronger than you would</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing things like five repetitions up to 12</p>
<p>or 12 to 25 reps and you&rsquo;re going out for long jogs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be a compromise</p>
<p>in adaptations, unfortunately.</p>
<p>It does seem like you can do concurrent training,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, if you allow anywhere</p>
<p>from four to six or ideally 24 hours between workouts.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the previous episode,</p>
<p>if you want to know if you are recovered from a workout,</p>
<p>a great way to do that is to apply</p>
<p>the carbon dioxide tolerance test,</p>
<p>which is four breaths in and out,</p>
<p>inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>inhale, exhale, then a big inhale,</p>
<p>and then a slow controlled exhale.</p>
<p>If that slow controlled exhale is 60 seconds or longer,</p>
<p>it means that your parasympathetic,</p>
<p>your calming nervous system is under your control.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s likely, I should say likely,</p>
<p>that systemically your whole nervous system has recovered</p>
<p>from whatever it is that you&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>and experiencing in life, including work and relationships.</p>
<p>If not, you might want to take a rest day, dare I say,</p>
<p>or Costello&rsquo;s on his, what?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 10 now, I think he&rsquo;s on his 12,000th rest day.</p>
<p>Most people need, I should say,</p>
<p>one to two full rest days per week.</p>
<p>I know there are people who are going to say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous and okay,</p>
<p>maybe you have amazing recovery abilities.</p>
<p>Also depends on training intensity.</p>
<p>Many people benefit from having one or two</p>
<p>full rest days per week, at least one.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>But if you are not able to extend that exhale</p>
<p>on the carbon dioxide tolerance test</p>
<p>past 60 seconds or so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds,</p>
<p>chances are your so-called sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>your stress system is chronically elevated</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not really putting the brake</p>
<p>on that system enough.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a subconscious thing.</p>
<p>There are ways that you can accelerate recovery,</p>
<p>but I would encourage you to listen</p>
<p>to the previous episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s timestamped for how to assess recovery.</p>
<p>So how often to program these things</p>
<p>will depend on the other things you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable to do this type of training</p>
<p>with other types of training.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about a variety of combinations of those</p>
<p>toward the end of the episode.</p>
<p>I do want to talk about how to deliver</p>
<p>more energy and oxygen.</p>
<p>These are tools that are extremely useful, I believe,</p>
<p>and that are grounded in physiology.</p>
<p>The three things I&rsquo;d like to talk about</p>
<p>are how to breathe,</p>
<p>what to do immediately after training and hydration.</p>
<p>And I promise I will get back into programming</p>
<p>and sort of protocols,</p>
<p>but these are vitally important to your ability</p>
<p>to perform endurance work in particular.</p>
<p>And they are grounded in how neurons and blood</p>
<p>and oxygen and your heart work together.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s first talk about breathing or respiration.</p>
<p>We breathe a couple of different ways,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just remind ourselves why we breathe.</p>
<p>We breathe to bring oxygen into our system</p>
<p>and we breathe to get rid of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>And we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide</p>
<p>in order to utilize fuel and for our brain and body to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that oxygen is good and carbon dioxide is bad.</p>
<p>They have to be present in the appropriate ratios.</p>
<p>So one thing that is very clear</p>
<p>is our ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles</p>
<p>and to our brain is going to be important</p>
<p>for our ability to generate muscular effort,</p>
<p>especially of the kind I was talking about today,</p>
<p>but also weight training</p>
<p>and other forms of skill-based effort, et cetera,</p>
<p>and our ability to think.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re holding your breath for too long,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re breathing too much,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re what they call over-breathing or under-breathing,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re shallow breathing, if you&rsquo;re mouth breathing,</p>
<p>these are all things that can really impede</p>
<p>mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make it really simple.</p>
<p>And then I promise to do a future episode</p>
<p>all about respiration.</p>
<p>There are two main sources of air for your body</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s air coming in through your nose</p>
<p>and air coming in through your mouth.</p>
<p>In general, nasal breathing is better.</p>
<p>It scrubs the air of bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p>You have a microbiome in your nose that benefits.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also just a more efficient system, believe it or not.</p>
<p>Even though it feels like you can gulp more air</p>
<p>with your mouth, getting good at nasal breathing is useful.</p>
<p>A gear system of the type that Brian McKenzie</p>
<p>and colleagues have developed,</p>
<p>I think is a good way to conceptualize this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing long duration work,</p>
<p>try and do it all nasal breathing.</p>
<p>If you have deviated septum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably because you don&rsquo;t nasal breathe enough.</p>
<p>Mouth breathing is something that many people suffer from.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more prone to infections.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as efficient, et cetera.</p>
<p>There is a place for mouth breathing.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s usually if you need to do a strong exhale,</p>
<p>oftentimes you can discard more volume through the mouth</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re very trained at nasal breathing.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing high intensity training,</p>
<p>a good way to conceptualize this is to exhale</p>
<p>on the max effort and then to inhale</p>
<p>on the less intense part.</p>
<p>So that might be as you&rsquo;re generating the movement,</p>
<p>you know, in the concentric part of the movement,</p>
<p>you exhale, right?</p>
<p>Just like on a bat swing or something like that,</p>
<p>or, you know, fighters and martial artists</p>
<p>do this differently depending on how they were trained</p>
<p>and the different purposes,</p>
<p>but the kind of like, ah, or shh,</p>
<p>the kind of exhaling during the effort</p>
<p>and then inhaling on the portion of the repetition</p>
<p>that is not the highest effort portion.</p>
<p>Usually that&rsquo;s the eccentric phase</p>
<p>of anything involving weights or rowing</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So nasal breathing is great,</p>
<p>but as you increase the intensity of your endurance work,</p>
<p>you will need to incorporate the mouth.</p>
<p>So a gear system would look something like</p>
<p>first gear would be just nasal breathing,</p>
<p>or second gear would also be just nasal breathing,</p>
<p>but with more effort.</p>
<p>Third gear, again,</p>
<p>Power Speed Endurance has a lot more about this.</p>
<p>You can go to their website.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very intelligent way to conceptualize this.</p>
<p>As you go into more max effort,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going into third and fourth and fifth gear.</p>
<p>And at some point you&rsquo;re not thinking about nose or mouth.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just trying to hang on for dear life</p>
<p>and complete the work safely.</p>
<p>And that means breathe through</p>
<p>whatever orifice works for you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one aspect, nose versus mouth.</p>
<p>The other aspect is whether or not you&rsquo;re using your ribs,</p>
<p>the intercostal muscles are these muscles</p>
<p>that the Bruce Lee had these remarkable intercostal muscles</p>
<p>that allow you to lift the rib cage or the diaphragm,</p>
<p>which is a skeletal muscle that sits below the lungs.</p>
<p>Just to remind you, when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down</p>
<p>when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something that most people don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>and would benefit tremendously from.</p>
<p>And I can say this because Andy Galpin&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>has done work on this,</p>
<p>exploring how warming up the intercostals</p>
<p>and the nerve to diaphragm pathways</p>
<p>before any kind of endurance work</p>
<p>or in the first few minutes of endurance work</p>
<p>can allow you to breathe more deeply</p>
<p>and to deliver more oxygen to the blood,</p>
<p>and excuse me, and to the muscles</p>
<p>and to be able to do more work more efficiently.</p>
<p>So what that involves is sometimes sitting,</p>
<p>sometimes standing,</p>
<p>and just really concentrating on two things.</p>
<p>We always hear about how we should diaphragmatic breathe.</p>
<p>And that means our belly moves out when we inhale.</p>
<p>So our stomach expands,</p>
<p>but also expanding the intercostals,</p>
<p>which means actually raising the ribs, chest breathing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all told that in yoga class,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t breathe with your chest this,</p>
<p>but actually that is warming up the intercostal muscles.</p>
<p>So this is also a great way to generate adrenaline</p>
<p>if you do it a little bit intensely.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re feeling unmotivated to train.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly like doing endurance training</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;m actually doing it.</p>
<p>So I use and benefit from having a practice</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ll just sit there and for about three minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just breathe very deeply,</p>
<p>trying to raise my chest as much as I can</p>
<p>for maybe a minute,</p>
<p>and then expanding, contracting my diaphragm</p>
<p>and expanding my stomach outward when I inhale.</p>
<p>By the end of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually delivering more oxygen to your system.</p>
<p>My lab has looked at this in a totally different context.</p>
<p>Andy&rsquo;s lab has looked at it</p>
<p>in the context of physical performance.</p>
<p>So warming up the breathing muscles should make sense</p>
<p>given that you now know that muscles and neurons</p>
<p>need glucose and they need oxygen in order to function.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a great warmup.</p>
<p>You can also do this while walking</p>
<p>or while getting on the bike and starting to pedal,</p>
<p>really starting to think about</p>
<p>warming up the breathing system.</p>
<p>And then you can decide if you want to do pure nasal</p>
<p>or a combination of nasal and mouth breathing and so on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that we don&rsquo;t often hear about.</p>
<p>The other one, the other tool rather</p>
<p>that I talked about in a previous episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just mention again,</p>
<p>is some people, when they do endurance type work,</p>
<p>they get a stitch in their side.</p>
<p>They feel like they&rsquo;ve got a side cramp.</p>
<p>Very rarely is it actually a skeletal muscular cramp.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s oftentimes, it&rsquo;s a referenced pain</p>
<p>of the phrenic nerve that innervates the liver.</p>
<p>So the phrenic nerve is responsible</p>
<p>for the movement of the diaphragm.</p>
<p>It is a very important system,</p>
<p>but it has a number of what we call collateral.</p>
<p>So it branches to other organs, runs over other organs.</p>
<p>Sometimes when we&rsquo;re breathing shallow</p>
<p>and we are in physical motion</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re engaging in physical effort,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll feel that side stitch and we think,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;ve got a cramp or maybe I&rsquo;m dehydrated</p>
<p>or maybe I need to run with my hands over my head.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Typically you can relieve that side cramp,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t a cramp at all, that side stitch</p>
<p>by doing the double inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>really breathing deeply</p>
<p>and then sneaking a little bit more air in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a double kind of firing</p>
<p>or what we call volley of action potential</p>
<p>sent from the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm,</p>
<p>which will also activate that collateral,</p>
<p>that branch literally of the nerve</p>
<p>that innervates the liver.</p>
<p>And then when you exhale,</p>
<p>you offload a bunch of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>But if you repeat that a few times,</p>
<p>often, in fact, for me every time,</p>
<p>but often what&rsquo;ll happen is that side stitch</p>
<p>will just naturally disappear.</p>
<p>It just means you&rsquo;re not breathing properly.</p>
<p>The phrenic nerve is firing in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of aggravating that referenced pain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing kind of voodoo or mysterious about this.</p>
<p>It just has to do with the way</p>
<p>that the different nerves travel in the body.</p>
<p>So as you set out on your run</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re going to do some muscular endurance work</p>
<p>or high intensity work, warming up the intercostals,</p>
<p>warming up the diaphragm is good.</p>
<p>And there are exercises,</p>
<p>there is work that you can do to strengthen</p>
<p>the intercostals and to strengthen the diaphragm</p>
<p>during bouts of this kind of effort.</p>
<p>And I would say that one of the ways</p>
<p>that you can do that best is by really focusing</p>
<p>on getting the maximum diaphragmatic expansion</p>
<p>and chest lifting, what we&rsquo;re all told now not to do.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t chest breathe, belly breathe.</p>
<p>The intercostals are there for a reason</p>
<p>and they are perfectly good at filling your lungs.</p>
<p>They work best when they collaborate with your diaphragm.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re starting to fatigue,</p>
<p>to start to really inhale deeply</p>
<p>and try and really expand those</p>
<p>to deliver more oxygen to your system.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re talking about delivering more oxygen</p>
<p>to your system, I want to share with you a useful tool</p>
<p>that will now make total sense mechanistically why it works,</p>
<p>which is oftentimes when we are on a long run</p>
<p>or in long duration bouts of effort,</p>
<p>we will hit the so-called wall, right?</p>
<p>We will bonk, I think they used to call it</p>
<p>or maybe do they still call it that Costello?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s asleep.</p>
<p>We bonk, we just, we think, no, we can&rsquo;t continue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a curious thing as to whether or not that&rsquo;s neural</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s fuel-based.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly going to be a psychological</p>
<p>or motivational component.</p>
<p>But one way that you can reveal this kind of extra gear</p>
<p>or the capacity to push on is by understanding the way</p>
<p>that different muscle fibers use energy differently.</p>
<p>Remember the fast twitch phosphocreatine system</p>
<p>and the slow twitch system that relies mainly</p>
<p>on lipids and glucose.</p>
<p>Okay, well, even if you don&rsquo;t remember all that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been running steadily for a long time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re starting to fatigue</p>
<p>and you feel like it&rsquo;s time to quit,</p>
<p>you may have not tapped into an alternative fuel source.</p>
<p>One thing that you can do</p>
<p>is you can actually increase your speed.</p>
<p>This is also true of work where you&rsquo;re doing repetitions</p>
<p>with kettlebells or something.</p>
<p>You can start to increase your speed.</p>
<p>So run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster,</p>
<p>not all out sprint, but in doing that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re shifting the muscles and the nerves</p>
<p>over towards utilizing a separate fuel source</p>
<p>or a distinct fuel source.</p>
<p>Maybe the phosphocreatine system,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a quick bout of intense acceleration,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s a combination of lipids and carbohydrates</p>
<p>in your system that weren&rsquo;t available to you prior.</p>
<p>Now, of course,</p>
<p>if you completely deplete your liver glycogen,</p>
<p>you completely deplete everything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only going to be running on stored fuel and fats</p>
<p>and eventually you&rsquo;ll start metabolizing protein,</p>
<p>muscles themselves.</p>
<p>But this is a kind of a unique way to realize that,</p>
<p>oh, you weren&rsquo;t out of energy at all.</p>
<p>You were just over-relying on one fuel source.</p>
<p>And this is the reason why,</p>
<p>especially elite athletes are starting to</p>
<p>both rely on carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re doing the whole carb depletion,</p>
<p>then carb loading thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re loading up their liver and their muscles</p>
<p>with plenty of glycogen by eating pastas and rice</p>
<p>and stuff before races,</p>
<p>but they are also ingesting ketones during races,</p>
<p>during long bouts of effort,</p>
<p>because ketones can be a quick form of energy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why you can&rsquo;t use ketones</p>
<p>if they are taken, exogenous ketones,</p>
<p>and carbohydrate and in combination.</p>
<p>Remember the body is accustomed</p>
<p>to using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids, carbohydrates,</p>
<p>all these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only in the kind of internet age that we think</p>
<p>in terms of, oh, well, you&rsquo;re either keto</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re burning sugar or you&rsquo;re fat adapted</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re fat fasting or fast fasting or fat fadding.</p>
<p>Costello woke up when I said fat fadding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about you, Costello.</p>
<p>So the point is that your body is used</p>
<p>to using multiple fuel sources.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re kind of hitting that wall,</p>
<p>sometimes accelerating can actually allow you to tap</p>
<p>into a new fuel source or combination of fuel sources</p>
<p>just based on the way that muscles use fuel.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another tool.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s really important to think about</p>
<p>in terms of endurance type work is hydration.</p>
<p>And I think hydration is important</p>
<p>for all forms of physical work and exercise,</p>
<p>not just endurance.</p>
<p>The deal with hydration is that we&rsquo;ve been taught</p>
<p>about hydration all wrong,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s remember what neurons work on.</p>
<p>What do they use in order to fire?</p>
<p>Well, they certainly need water, right?</p>
<p>We need water in our system, I should say,</p>
<p>but remember they use electrolytes, sodium and potassium</p>
<p>to generate those action potentials</p>
<p>to actually get neurons to contract,</p>
<p>to be able, excuse me, muscles to contract</p>
<p>and for our brain to function and to be able to think.</p>
<p>Typically, we&rsquo;re going to lose anywhere</p>
<p>from one to five pounds of water per hour of exercise.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to vary tremendously.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to vary on weather.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to vary on intensity,</p>
<p>probably more like five pounds if it&rsquo;s hot day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re exercising very intensely.</p>
<p>So about one to five pounds per hour.</p>
<p>Now, you know how much you weigh.</p>
<p>So if you think about your weight in pounds,</p>
<p>once you lose about one to 4% of your body weight in water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to experience about a 20 to 30% reduction</p>
<p>in work capacity, in your ability to generate effort</p>
<p>of any kind, strength, endurance, et cetera.</p>
<p>You are also going to experience a significant drop</p>
<p>in your ability to think and perform mental operations.</p>
<p>So hydration is key.</p>
<p>Now, many people have been told,</p>
<p>well, if you urinate and your urine is clear,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;re hydrated enough.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Also, and this isn&rsquo;t a topic I enjoy discussing,</p>
<p>but urine is a biological phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually filtered blood.</p>
<p>Went to, every once in a while,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a kid and it&rsquo;s a family friend, I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>did you know that your pee is actually filtered blood?</p>
<p>And they usually kind of go wide-eyed,</p>
<p>but then they go, oh, that&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Like kids have this natural curiosity</p>
<p>about blood and pee and stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not contaminated by our preconceived notions</p>
<p>of those things being gross.</p>
<p>Because urine being filtered blood</p>
<p>can give you some indication</p>
<p>as to whether or not you&rsquo;re hydrated enough or not.</p>
<p>And in order to really assess that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be sufficient to urinate</p>
<p>into another volume of water</p>
<p>and assess whether or not your urine</p>
<p>is very dark or very light.</p>
<p>It actually requires urinating into a small volume</p>
<p>and saying, well, is it darker or lighter than before?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something you really want to do most places.</p>
<p>The etiquette of most gyms and environments</p>
<p>is not suitable for that.</p>
<p>But one of the things that you can just do</p>
<p>is you can figure, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lose one to five pounds of water per hour.</p>
<p>You can show up to exercise reasonably hydrated</p>
<p>with electrolytes.</p>
<p>So potassium, sodium, and magnesium are really key.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You can die from drinking too much water in particular</p>
<p>because it forces you,</p>
<p>if you drink too much water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll excrete too many electrolytes</p>
<p>and your brain will shut off.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll actually, your heart will stop functioning properly.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to over-consume water</p>
<p>to the extreme either.</p>
<p>But there are a number of equations</p>
<p>that go into figuring out how much water you need</p>
<p>based on how intense your training, et cetera,</p>
<p>body size, et cetera.</p>
<p>Just remember, you burn, you lose, excuse me,</p>
<p>about one to five pounds of water per hour,</p>
<p>depending on how hot it is</p>
<p>and how intensely you&rsquo;re exercising.</p>
<p>Once your body weight drops by one to 4%,</p>
<p>so you can just figure it,</p>
<p>well, if you lose five pounds per hour,</p>
<p>you exercise for two hours,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re about 200 pounds, that&rsquo;s about 10%, okay?</p>
<p>Well, you want to replace that before, very quickly,</p>
<p>or you want to replace that all along</p>
<p>before you start experiencing</p>
<p>this massive 20 to 30% reduction</p>
<p>in work capacity of muscles and the brain.</p>
<p>A simple formula, what I call the Galpin equation,</p>
<p>hereafter referred to as the Galpin equation,</p>
<p>is a formula that gets you close to the exact amount</p>
<p>that you would want that Dr. Andy Galpin came up with,</p>
<p>which is your body weight in pounds</p>
<p>divided by the number 30.</p>
<p>And that is how many ounces you should drink</p>
<p>for every 15 minutes of exercise.</p>
<p>So once again, the Galpin equation,</p>
<p>your body weight in pounds divided by 30,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the amount of fluid to drink in ounces, right?</p>
<p>Every 15 minutes of exercise.</p>
<p>Now, if you are sweating a lot, you may need more, okay?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re already very well hydrated, you may need less,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a good rule of thumb to begin</p>
<p>and to start to understand the relationship</p>
<p>between hydration and performance.</p>
<p>There is a phenomenon in which gastric emptying,</p>
<p>the ability to move stuff out of your gut,</p>
<p>including water and electrolytes,</p>
<p>out of your gut and into the bloodstream</p>
<p>and for delivery to the tissues of your body for effort</p>
<p>is hindered when you get above 70% of your VO2 max.</p>
<p>In other words, when you&rsquo;re doing high intensity training,</p>
<p>sometimes people experience that ingesting water</p>
<p>during intense training is difficult.</p>
<p>It is something that can be actually trained up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of learning to kind of relax</p>
<p>your abdominal muscles.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some other aspects of adaptation</p>
<p>that will allow you to drink during higher intensity work.</p>
<p>As Galpin says, don&rsquo;t try and ingest fluids</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re working out or competing at higher</p>
<p>than 70% of VO2 max.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never done it before,</p>
<p>you want to train up this capacity.</p>
<p>People can learn how to consume fluids during a race</p>
<p>or consume fluids during bouts of exercise</p>
<p>that are very intense.</p>
<p>And a lot of people don&rsquo;t want to do that</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want to have to stop to urinate, et cetera.</p>
<p>But given the crucial role of hydration</p>
<p>for muscular performance and for brain performance,</p>
<p>it seems that if you&rsquo;re going to be doing a lot</p>
<p>of high intensity interval training</p>
<p>of the various kinds I talked about today</p>
<p>or high intensity training of any kind,</p>
<p>that hydration is key and learning,</p>
<p>or in other words, getting your system to adapt</p>
<p>to ingesting fluids in the middle of these workouts</p>
<p>is something that seems beneficial, at least to me,</p>
<p>in terms of the trade-off between being dehydrated</p>
<p>and the somewhat discomfort of maybe drinking some fluid.</p>
<p>So you sip small amounts of fluid initially,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re able to take bigger and bigger gulps</p>
<p>as time goes on.</p>
<p>And pretty soon you&rsquo;re able to drink mid-set,</p>
<p>or excuse me, not mid-set, please don&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>between sets in your workout</p>
<p>or while you&rsquo;re still breathing hard after a mile repeat</p>
<p>or something of that sort without much disruption</p>
<p>or any at all to your performance.</p>
<p>Last episode, we talked about how to assess recovery</p>
<p>and things that you might want to do to improve recovery,</p>
<p>how exposure to ice baths and cold showers</p>
<p>can reduce inflammation, which can be great for recovery.</p>
<p>But can inhibit some of the adaptations</p>
<p>for strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>because inflammation isn&rsquo;t good or bad.</p>
<p>Inflammation isn&rsquo;t like a nice person or a mean person,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great thing for stimulating adaptations,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want it around too long.</p>
<p>And so we suggested that you not do ice baths</p>
<p>within probably six hours of any training</p>
<p>where the goal was hypertrophy or strength training.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that getting yourself</p>
<p>into an ice bath or cold shower after endurance training</p>
<p>can actually improve the mitochondrial aspects</p>
<p>of endurance exercise,</p>
<p>that you can get improvements in mitochondrial density</p>
<p>and you can get improvements in mitochondrial respiration</p>
<p>by doing that afterwards</p>
<p>and that it can facilitate recovery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still a bit of a controversial area.</p>
<p>I do think that what I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>that waiting at least six hours</p>
<p>and probably more like 24 hours between workouts</p>
<p>is a good idea,</p>
<p>that getting at least one full day of rest each week,</p>
<p>for some people that&rsquo;ll be two.</p>
<p>I have to say, I&rsquo;m one of these people</p>
<p>that after two days of absolutely no exercise,</p>
<p>I do perform better consistently</p>
<p>across all aspects of physical performance</p>
<p>and mentally I feel better as well,</p>
<p>even though I loathe to take those days off</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m really exhausted,</p>
<p>it does seem to help my training.</p>
<p>Some people can train seven days a week and they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>I think it just is, there&rsquo;s a lot of individual variation.</p>
<p>You want to work on sleep and maximizing sleep for recovery,</p>
<p>nutrition, of course, as well.</p>
<p>I talked about sleep in the first four episodes</p>
<p>of the podcast.</p>
<p>If you have trouble with sleep,</p>
<p>definitely check out those episodes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear and a number of sports teams,</p>
<p>even some folks that I work with</p>
<p>and Andy Galpin and others are starting to incorporate</p>
<p>a what&rsquo;s called a parasympathetic down regulation</p>
<p>after training of any kind as a way to accelerate recovery</p>
<p>and enable you to do more work.</p>
<p>In other words, get back to workout sooner.</p>
<p>What is parasympathetic down regulation?</p>
<p>It means finishing your training</p>
<p>and instead of just hopping on the phone</p>
<p>or hopping into your car</p>
<p>and heading off to take five minutes minimum,</p>
<p>maybe ideally more like 10 or 20,</p>
<p>but for sake of time, five minutes minimum</p>
<p>and doing just some slow, pure nasal,</p>
<p>long exhale devoted breathing</p>
<p>or lying down and just kind of zoning out.</p>
<p>That it seems can accelerate recovery</p>
<p>and allow you to get back into other types of work,</p>
<p>mental work or physical work more quickly,</p>
<p>which makes total sense</p>
<p>because remember your nervous system</p>
<p>and recovery and work is a local phenomenon.</p>
<p>Which muscles were you using?</p>
<p>Were you using your glutes, your hams and your back</p>
<p>or were you using your shoulders, et cetera,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a systemic thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about those neurons in the locus coeruleus</p>
<p>that are releasing epinephrine.</p>
<p>You want to quiet all that down after training.</p>
<p>You want to really just zone out.</p>
<p>Think Costello, channel your inner Costello</p>
<p>and just mellow out for five to 20 minutes</p>
<p>and then move into the rest of your day.</p>
<p>Five minutes should be manageable,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just sitting in the car with your eyes closed,</p>
<p>doing that down regulation breathing.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll see big benefits</p>
<p>in terms of allowing yourself to come back sooner,</p>
<p>do more work over time</p>
<p>and just perform and feel better generally,</p>
<p>as well as be able to think about other things</p>
<p>besides the just how much the previous workout</p>
<p>kind of beat you up.</p>
<p>A couple more things I think are going to be useful</p>
<p>and I do want to just pack these in</p>
<p>because we are closing out the month</p>
<p>on physical performance</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s about programming</p>
<p>and about pacing and the kind of mental aspects</p>
<p>of endurance.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with pacing and mental aspects of endurance.</p>
<p>I learned from a friend and colleague here at the podcast</p>
<p>that who&rsquo;s very active in triathlon and marathon</p>
<p>and other knows a lot about that whole world</p>
<p>and the competitive landscape there,</p>
<p>that pacing and literally physical pacers</p>
<p>of a laser on the ground</p>
<p>or visualizing or having a pace car</p>
<p>or a pace runner in front</p>
<p>is actually not allowed in many competitions.</p>
<p>And if those are present,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t allow the race times to qualify</p>
<p>as legitimate record holding times.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very interesting to me</p>
<p>because what we know is that the visual system</p>
<p>has this capacity to switch back and forth</p>
<p>between what we call panoramic vision</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re not really focused on anything.</p>
<p>Things are just flowing past us</p>
<p>or our eyes are just kind of zoned out.</p>
<p>So I can do this right now and you won&rsquo;t be able to tell,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m looking at the corners of the room.</p>
<p>I see Costello down there on the floor.</p>
<p>I see my podcast team here</p>
<p>and I can also see the microphone.</p>
<p>I can see myself in this environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s panoramic vision.</p>
<p>Whereas if I draw my eyes to one location,</p>
<p>like right there in the center of the camera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a vergence eye movement.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m contracting my visual window.</p>
<p>The contraction of the visual window when that&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>is the same thing that would happen</p>
<p>if I was tracking say a pace car or a pace runner</p>
<p>or a laser on the ground.</p>
<p>The mere bringing our eyes together</p>
<p>to what we call a vergence point</p>
<p>has the impact of triggering the activation</p>
<p>of neural circuits in the thalamus,</p>
<p>things like zona and serta,</p>
<p>if you really want to know what their names are,</p>
<p>of these brain areas,</p>
<p>as well as in the brainstem that activate</p>
<p>the so-called alertness system,</p>
<p>things like locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>Whereas panoramic vision tends to bring us</p>
<p>into states of relaxation.</p>
<p>You can actually leverage this during your runs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re out for a long run</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re swimming or you&rsquo;re cycling.</p>
<p>This is probably easiest to imagine out of the water,</p>
<p>but you probably do in the water as well.</p>
<p>If you focus your attention on a landmark</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to run to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s much easier</p>
<p>than if you don&rsquo;t actually have a set milestone</p>
<p>or landmark that you&rsquo;re going to run to.</p>
<p>However, if you were to continue that repeatedly,</p>
<p>just going milestone after milestone after milestone,</p>
<p>you would feel more mentally fatigued</p>
<p>and you would actually be able</p>
<p>to generate less work overall.</p>
<p>One thing that can be useful is focusing on a milestone,</p>
<p>running to that milestone or biking,</p>
<p>whatever it is the activity happens to be,</p>
<p>and then dilating your field of view to relax the system</p>
<p>and then continuing again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this kind of active contraction</p>
<p>or of the visual window</p>
<p>and then dilation of the visual window.</p>
<p>Contraction of the visual window</p>
<p>allows you to generate more effort,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a cost to doing that</p>
<p>because neurons consume energy</p>
<p>and now you know how they do that.</p>
<p>Whereas dilation allows you</p>
<p>to essentially be more efficient, right?</p>
<p>Now, pacing is not allowed or having a pacer,</p>
<p>a visual pacer, because it does allow you</p>
<p>to access systems in the brain and body</p>
<p>that allow you to create more energy, more effort.</p>
<p>And so I find it interesting</p>
<p>that I think in a kind of subconscious genius,</p>
<p>the race officials and the governing bodies</p>
<p>of these races have said, okay, sure,</p>
<p>having a pacer there or someone in front,</p>
<p>you can draft off of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a kind of a aerodynamic effect</p>
<p>of having someone in front of you</p>
<p>that makes it easier to run in the wake</p>
<p>of their airstream, so to speak.</p>
<p>Same is true in cycling.</p>
<p>This is why the cycling teams</p>
<p>are so good at maneuvering in packs in very specific ways.</p>
<p>You can go faster with less effort</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re drafting as it&rsquo;s called behind somebody.</p>
<p>But as well, where you place your vision</p>
<p>will allow you to generate more effort.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting that they&rsquo;ve taken out</p>
<p>this kind of, if you will, performance enhancing tool.</p>
<p>I imagine, and I have to imagine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the appropriate word here,</p>
<p>that good runners, good cyclists have the ability</p>
<p>to create a kind of pacer in their mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>I have to imagine that they&rsquo;re not just completely</p>
<p>allowing their attention to drift,</p>
<p>although they do that when they want to be</p>
<p>in highly efficient mode,</p>
<p>generating effort without having to tax</p>
<p>their mental capacity.</p>
<p>And remember, mental capacity is neural energy</p>
<p>and consumes glucose, energy that they could devote</p>
<p>to the functioning of their body,</p>
<p>but that when needed, that they can focus their energy in</p>
<p>and actually kind of chase a mental pacer</p>
<p>or pick milestones.</p>
<p>So this is a mental game that you can play as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit hard to do in the context</p>
<p>of weightlifting in the gym.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a moving through space kind of thing,</p>
<p>but some people do this by counting reps, et cetera.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s especially suitable for endurance type</p>
<p>of exercise, especially done outside.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I hate running on a treadmill</p>
<p>is it just feels like it&rsquo;s never ending.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never tried one of these Peloton things.</p>
<p>I try and avoid looking at screens</p>
<p>as much as I possibly can.</p>
<p>But if you try this next time you&rsquo;re out for a run</p>
<p>or a swim, what you&rsquo;ll find is that you have a capacity</p>
<p>to engage a system of higher energy output</p>
<p>when you focus your eyes on a particular location,</p>
<p>but you want to use that judiciously</p>
<p>because your goal, of course, is to become efficient</p>
<p>at moving through space over time</p>
<p>and not taxing your brain and body to the point</p>
<p>where you arrive at the end of that,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s race day, just completely tapped out.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a kind of interesting aspect of running.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of running, which I am,</p>
<p>and you get the chance to look at any of the documentaries</p>
<p>or docudramas made about, excuse me,</p>
<p>about Steve Prefontaine, it was clear that he was mostly</p>
<p>in a battle with himself,</p>
<p>but that he was also a highly competitive individual.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see this in some of his races.</p>
<p>I do encourage you to look some of those up on YouTube</p>
<p>or see the docudramas, they&rsquo;re quite good,</p>
<p>where he ran the, essentially was 12 laps on a track.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially the five, it is the 5,000 meter race,</p>
<p>which is essentially three miles.</p>
<p>And he essentially tried to sprint the whole thing,</p>
<p>which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Actually knowing what you know today,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll realize that Steve Prefontaine basically</p>
<p>was pulling from strength, speed, power,</p>
<p>muscular endurance, long duration effort,</p>
<p>high intensity aerobic and aerobic,</p>
<p>is he sort of tried to maximize every fuel system.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see that in the races that he runs,</p>
<p>but that when runners are nearing the final laps,</p>
<p>the so-called bell lap of a race,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll often look to one another to see where somebody is,</p>
<p>obviously to assess their progress</p>
<p>and how close somebody is.</p>
<p>But when somebody gets passed,</p>
<p>oftentimes you&rsquo;ll see someone access this mysterious kick,</p>
<p>this ability to tap into some additional gear</p>
<p>that allows them to run forward or faster</p>
<p>when they themselves actually thought</p>
<p>that they were maxed out.</p>
<p>So someone could be running for the finish line,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re convinced they&rsquo;re going to win,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going max effort,</p>
<p>or at least they perceive max effort, someone passes them.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden max effort has changed</p>
<p>because of that visual target,</p>
<p>they are able to access higher levels of speed and output</p>
<p>and effort and performance.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t always catch up to that person and win,</p>
<p>but having a target, a milestone is a powerful way</p>
<p>that we can generate more force and energy in anything.</p>
<p>And the visual system is the way</p>
<p>that we bring those milestones into our brain,</p>
<p>which then brings about epinephrine,</p>
<p>which brings about neural firing,</p>
<p>which allows us to access whatever resources</p>
<p>happen to be available to us.</p>
<p>So I find this fascinating because people often wonder like,</p>
<p>where does the kick come from?</p>
<p>Where is this kind of gift of an additional gear?</p>
<p>Where is that deeper resource?</p>
<p>And we often express it and talk about it</p>
<p>in kind of psychological terms like heart or willpower,</p>
<p>or that something kind of got transplanted into us</p>
<p>or descended into us.</p>
<p>And not to remove any of the spiritual aspects of sport</p>
<p>or running or effort or the human heart,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear that the nervous system,</p>
<p>when it has a specific visual target,</p>
<p>can generate the sorts of intense effort</p>
<p>that it couldn&rsquo;t otherwise.</p>
<p>And it sometimes even comes as a surprise</p>
<p>to the person generating the effort.</p>
<p>I promised that I would talk about programming,</p>
<p>meaning when and how many times a week</p>
<p>to do the various workouts related to endurance</p>
<p>and how to merge those with other types of exercise</p>
<p>that you might be doing for strength or yoga</p>
<p>or other things that you might be doing like work</p>
<p>and other things unrelated to exercise.</p>
<p>Since that&rsquo;s a vast space with many different parameters</p>
<p>and you all have different lives and lifestyles</p>
<p>and backgrounds with fitness, et cetera,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m going to do is I&rsquo;m going to put</p>
<p>three different levels, if you will,</p>
<p>or protocols that one could adopt</p>
<p>in a link on the show notes or in the caption on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you click on that link,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to see three possible combinations</p>
<p>of endurance work, strength and hypertrophy work,</p>
<p>or endurance work, flexibility and hypertrophy work</p>
<p>that are grounded in many of the major publications</p>
<p>that Dr. Andy Galpin and colleagues</p>
<p>and other people have described,</p>
<p>including this review that&rsquo;s also linked there</p>
<p>on concurrent training and how one can use</p>
<p>concurrent training, meaning training for endurance,</p>
<p>training for strength, training for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>training for all these different things</p>
<p>without having to train constantly every day,</p>
<p>twice a day, et cetera.</p>
<p>So if you are interested in taking the protocols</p>
<p>that you learned about in this episode</p>
<p>and in previous episodes and combining those,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve placed them there for you</p>
<p>as a completely zero cost resource.</p>
<p>Please understand they are not wholly,</p>
<p>Costello agrees, they are not wholly.</p>
<p>There will be variation in terms of what people can tolerate</p>
<p>and what they have time for,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;ll serve as a useful guideline</p>
<p>in getting started or in continuing with</p>
<p>and expanding on existing endurance work,</p>
<p>strength work, hypertrophy work, and so forth.</p>
<p>Just really quickly,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t talk about supplements much today.</p>
<p>In the previous episodes,</p>
<p>I talked about the phosphocreatine system</p>
<p>and supplementing with creatine,</p>
<p>talked about beta alanine for kind of moderate duration work.</p>
<p>You know, really the only things that have been shown</p>
<p>to really improve endurance work</p>
<p>across the four varieties of endurance work</p>
<p>I described today,</p>
<p>they have essentially two forms.</p>
<p>One are stimulants, so things like caffeine</p>
<p>will definitely improve endurance work and power output.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of evidence that caffeine intake</p>
<p>can actually inhibit the function of the creatine system,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just one study, but that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>If you want to read that study,</p>
<p>you can put caffeine into examine.com</p>
<p>and it will take you to that study.</p>
<p>Many people get sore after workouts,</p>
<p>in particular workouts that involve</p>
<p>a lot of eccentric loading</p>
<p>or workouts that are very novel</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve kind of pushed it</p>
<p>instead of moving gradually, as I suggest,</p>
<p>into say high intensity anaerobic endurance work</p>
<p>of three sets of 20 seconds on 100 second rest.</p>
<p>Maybe you get overambitious and you do eight sets,</p>
<p>in which case you are extremely sore.</p>
<p>Certain forms of magnesium,</p>
<p>in particular magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E,</p>
<p>have been shown to be useful for removing</p>
<p>or reducing the amount of delayed onset muscle soreness.</p>
<p>That form of magnesium is distinctly different</p>
<p>than the sorts of magnesium</p>
<p>that are good for getting us into sleep,</p>
<p>things like magnesium threonate and biglycinate.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this whole thing about beet powder</p>
<p>and beet juices and things that increase nitric oxide</p>
<p>and allow for more vasodilation</p>
<p>and therefore delivery of blood to muscle and neurons</p>
<p>and other tissues for long bouts of endurance work.</p>
<p>Some people like beet juice and the related compounds</p>
<p>that increase arginine and vasodilation.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t feel good when they take those.</p>
<p>Some people also don&rsquo;t feel good when they take beta-alanine</p>
<p>because it can give them this feeling</p>
<p>of kind of like itchy, creepy crawlies under the skin,</p>
<p>kind of the niacin phenomenon, the niacin flush.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t mind that</p>
<p>or some people don&rsquo;t experience that.</p>
<p>So when it comes to supplementation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of variety,</p>
<p>but magnesium malate has been shown to reduce soreness,</p>
<p>so sometimes that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Cold and hot contrast therapy for soreness,</p>
<p>things of that sort.</p>
<p>But in general, we focused mainly today</p>
<p>on behavioral tools.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that all of the tools are accessible</p>
<p>without the need for lots of equipment.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t say you need a rower or you need a kettlebell,</p>
<p>though those will work.</p>
<p>And I hope I was able to illustrate for you</p>
<p>that endurance isn&rsquo;t just one thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the ability to go for long bouts of exercise</p>
<p>of different kinds,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s also this mental component</p>
<p>because of the way that neurons work.</p>
<p>And also that there are these different forms of endurance,</p>
<p>of muscular endurance,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to fail because of the muscles</p>
<p>and muscle energy utilization</p>
<p>and the nerves that innervate those muscles locally,</p>
<p>not because of a failure to bring in oxygen or blood.</p>
<p>Whereas long duration effort,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be more about being below your VO2 max</p>
<p>and your ability to be efficient for long bouts</p>
<p>of more than 12 minutes of exercise.</p>
<p>One set, as they say, of 12 minutes to maybe several hours.</p>
<p>I should just mention with long duration type work,</p>
<p>you could even imagine raking in the yard or mowing a lawn,</p>
<p>depending on how big that lawn is.</p>
<p>I used to have a job when I was a kid mowing lawns.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have many neighbors with very big lawns,</p>
<p>but there are a few of them felt huge</p>
<p>because they were really convoluted.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re pushing that mower,</p>
<p>and these were the old fashioned mowers,</p>
<p>not electric mowers, it&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also of the sort</p>
<p>that we call long duration endurance work.</p>
<p>High intensity training will tap into yet other fuel sources</p>
<p>and mechanisms as we learn today.</p>
