    <p>The following is a conversation with Jordan Ellenberg,</p>
<p>a mathematician at University of Wisconsin</p>
<p>and an author who masterfully reveals the beauty</p>
<p>and power of mathematics in his 2014 book,</p>
<p>How Not To Be Wrong, and his new book,</p>
<p>just released recently, called Shape,</p>
<p>The Hidden Geometry of Information, Biology,</p>
<p>Strategy, Democracy, and Everything Else.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Indeed.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that geometry</p>
<p>is what made me fall in love with mathematics</p>
<p>when I was young.</p>
<p>It first showed me that something definitive</p>
<p>could be stated about this world</p>
<p>through intuitive visual proofs.</p>
<p>Somehow, that convinced me that math</p>
<p>is not just abstract numbers devoid of life,</p>
<p>but a part of life, part of this world,</p>
<p>part of our search for meaning.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Jordan Ellenberg.</p>
<p>If the brain is a cake.</p>
<p>It is?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s just go with me on this, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ll pause it.</p>
<p>So for Noam Chomsky, language,</p>
<p>the universal grammar, the framework</p>
<p>from which language springs is like most of the cake,</p>
<p>the delicious chocolate center,</p>
<p>and then the rest of cognition that we think of</p>
<p>is built on top, extra layers,</p>
<p>maybe the icing on the cake,</p>
<p>maybe consciousness is just like a cherry on top.</p>
<p>Where do you put in this cake mathematical thinking?</p>
<p>Is it as fundamental as language?</p>
<p>In the Chomsky view, is it more fundamental than language?</p>
<p>Is it echoes of the same kind of abstract framework</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s thinking about in terms of language</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re all really tightly interconnected?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting me to reflect on this question</p>
<p>of whether the feeling of producing mathematical output,</p>
<p>if you want, is like the process of uttering language</p>
<p>or producing linguistic output.</p>
<p>I think it feels something like that,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s certainly the case.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine doing mathematics</p>
<p>in a completely nonlinguistic way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine doing mathematics</p>
<p>without talking about mathematics</p>
<p>and sort of thinking in propositions.</p>
<p>But maybe it&rsquo;s just because that&rsquo;s the way I do mathematics,</p>
<p>and maybe I can&rsquo;t imagine it any other way, right?</p>
<p>Well, what about visualizing shapes,</p>
<p>visualizing concepts to which language</p>
<p>is not obviously attachable?</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s a really interesting question.</p>
<p>And one thing it reminds me of is one thing I talk about</p>
<p>in the book is dissection proofs,</p>
<p>these very beautiful proofs of geometric propositions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very famous one by Baskara</p>
<p>of the Pythagorean theorem, proofs which are purely visual,</p>
<p>proofs where you show that two quantities are the same</p>
<p>by taking the same pieces and putting them together one way</p>
<p>and making one shape and putting them together another way</p>
<p>and making a different shape,</p>
<p>and then observing that those two shapes</p>
<p>must have the same area</p>
<p>because they were built out of the same pieces.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous story,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a little bit disputed about how accurate this is,</p>
<p>but that in Baskara&rsquo;s manuscript,</p>
<p>he sort of gives this proof, just gives the diagram,</p>
<p>and then the entire verbal content of the proof</p>
<p>is he just writes under it, behold.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s some dispute</p>
<p>about exactly how accurate that is.</p>
<p>But so then there&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>If your proof is a diagram, if your proof is a picture,</p>
<p>or even if your proof is like a movie of the same pieces</p>
<p>like coming together in two different formations</p>
<p>to make two different things, is that language?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I have a good answer.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think it is. I think the process</p>
<p>of manipulating the visual elements</p>
<p>is the same as the process</p>
<p>of manipulating the elements of language.</p>
<p>And I think probably the manipulating, the aggregation,</p>
<p>the stitching stuff together is the important part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the actual specific elements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like, to me, language is a process</p>
<p>and math is a process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just specific symbols.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in action.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately created through action, through change.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re constantly evolving ideas.</p>
<p>Of course, we kind of attach,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain destination you arrive to</p>
<p>that you attach to and you call that a proof,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not, that doesn&rsquo;t need to end there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just at the end of the chapter</p>
<p>and then it goes on and on and on in that kind of way.</p>
<p>But I gotta ask you about geometry</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a prominent topic in your new book, Shape.</p>
<p>So for me, geometry is the thing,</p>
<p>just like as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>made me fall in love with mathematics when I was young.</p>
<p>So being able to prove something visually</p>
<p>just did something to my brain that it had this,</p>
<p>it planted this hopeful seed</p>
<p>that you can understand the world, like perfectly.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s an OCD thing,</p>
<p>but from a mathematics perspective,</p>
<p>like humans are messy, the world is messy, biology is messy.</p>
<p>Your parents are yelling or making you do stuff,</p>
<p>but you can cut through all that BS</p>
<p>and truly understand the world through mathematics</p>
<p>and nothing like geometry did that for me.</p>
<p>For you, you did not immediately fall in love</p>
<p>with geometry, so how do you think about geometry?</p>
<p>Why is it a special field in mathematics?</p>
<p>And how did you fall in love with it if you have?</p>
<p>Wow, you&rsquo;ve given me like a lot to say.</p>
<p>And certainly the experience that you describe</p>
<p>is so typical, but there&rsquo;s two versions of it.</p>
<p>One thing I say in the book</p>
<p>is that geometry is the cilantro of math.</p>
<p>People are not neutral about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who like you are like,</p>
<p>the rest of it I could take or leave,</p>
<p>but then at this one moment, it made sense.</p>
<p>This class made sense, why wasn&rsquo;t it all like that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other people, I can tell you,</p>
<p>because they come and talk to me all the time,</p>
<p>who are like, I understood all the stuff</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to figure out what X was,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some mystery you&rsquo;re trying to solve it,</p>
<p>X is a number, I figured it out.</p>
<p>But then there was this geometry, like what was that?</p>
<p>What happened that year? Like I didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>I was like lost the whole year</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t understand like why we even</p>
<p>spent the time doing that.</p>
<p>So, but what everybody agrees on</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s somehow different, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something special about it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna walk around in circles a little bit,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>You asked me how I fell in love with math.</p>
<p>I have a story about this.</p>
<p>When I was a small child, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe like I was six or seven, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from the 70s.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re from a different decade than that.</p>
<p>But in the 70s, we had a cool wooden box</p>
<p>around your stereo.</p>
<p>That was the look, everything was dark wood.</p>
<p>And the box had a bunch of holes in it</p>
<p>to let the sound out.</p>
<p>And the holes were in this rectangular array,</p>
<p>a six by eight array of holes.</p>
<p>And I was just kind of like zoning out</p>
<p>in the living room as kids do,</p>
<p>looking at this six by eight rectangular array of holes.</p>
<p>And if you like, just by kind of like focusing in and out,</p>
<p>just by kind of looking at this box,</p>
<p>looking at this rectangle, I was like,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s six rows of eight holes each,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also eight columns of six holes each.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>So eight sixes and six eights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the dissection proofs</p>
<p>we were just talking about, but it&rsquo;s the same holes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same 48 holes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how many there are,</p>
<p>no matter whether you count them as rows</p>
<p>or count them as columns.</p>
<p>And this was like unbelievable to me.</p>
<p>Am I allowed to cuss on your podcast?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s, are we FCC regulated?</p>
<p>Okay, it was fucking unbelievable.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s the last time.</p>
<p>Get it in there.</p>
<p>This story merits it.</p>
<p>So two different perspectives in the same physical reality.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just as you say.</p>
<p>I knew that six times eight was the same as eight times six.</p>
<p>I knew my times tables.</p>
<p>I knew that that was a fact.</p>
<p>But did I really know it until that moment?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question, right?</p>
<p>I sort of knew that the times table was symmetric,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t know why that was the case until that moment.</p>
<p>And in that moment I could see like,</p>
<p>oh, I didn&rsquo;t have to have somebody tell me that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s information that you can just directly access.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really amazing moment.</p>
<p>And as math teachers, that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really trying to bring to our students.</p>
<p>And I was one of those who did not love</p>
<p>the kind of Euclidean geometry ninth grade class</p>
<p>of like prove that an isosceles triangle</p>
<p>has equal angles at the base, like this kind of thing.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t vibe with me the way that algebra and numbers did.</p>
<p>But if you go back to that moment,</p>
<p>from my adult perspective,</p>
<p>looking back at what happened with that rectangle,</p>
<p>I think that is a very geometric moment.</p>
<p>In fact, that moment exactly encapsulates</p>
<p>the intertwining of algebra and geometry.</p>
<p>This algebraic fact that, well, in the instance,</p>
<p>eight times six is equal to six times eight.</p>
<p>But in general, that whatever two numbers you have,</p>
<p>you multiply them one way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same as if you multiply them</p>
<p>in the other order.</p>
<p>It attaches it to this geometric fact about a rectangle,</p>
<p>which in some sense makes it true.</p>
<p>So, who knows, maybe I was always fated</p>
<p>to be an algebraic geometer,</p>
<p>which is what I am as a researcher.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of transformation.</p>
<p>And you talk about symmetry in your book.</p>
<p>What the heck is symmetry?</p>
<p>What the heck is these kinds of transformation on objects</p>
<p>that once you transform them, they seem to be similar?</p>
<p>What do you make of it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s its use in mathematics</p>
<p>or maybe broadly in understanding our world?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s an absolutely fundamental concept.</p>
<p>And it starts with the word symmetry</p>
<p>in the way that we usually use it</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re just like talking English</p>
<p>and not talking mathematics, right?</p>
<p>Sort of something is, when we say something is symmetrical,</p>
<p>we usually means it has what&rsquo;s called an axis of symmetry.</p>
<p>Maybe like the left half of it</p>
<p>looks the same as the right half.</p>
<p>That would be like a left, right axis of symmetry.</p>
<p>Or maybe the top half looks like the bottom half or both.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s sort of a fourfold symmetry</p>
<p>where the top looks like the bottom</p>
<p>and the left looks like the right or more.</p>
<p>And that can take you in a lot of different directions.</p>
<p>The abstract study of what the possible combinations</p>
<p>of symmetries there are,</p>
<p>a subject which is called group theory</p>
<p>was actually one of my first loves in mathematics</p>
<p>when I thought about a lot when I was in college.</p>
<p>But the notion of symmetry is actually much more general</p>
<p>than the things that we would call symmetry</p>
<p>if we were looking at like a classical building</p>
<p>or a painting or something like that.</p>
<p>Nowadays in math,</p>
<p>we could use a symmetry to refer to</p>
<p>any kind of transformation of an image</p>
<p>or a space or an object.</p>
<p>So what I talk about in the book is</p>
<p>take a figure and stretch it vertically,</p>
<p>make it twice as big vertically</p>
<p>and make it half as wide.</p>
<p>That I would call a symmetry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a symmetry in the classical sense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a well defined transformation</p>
<p>that has an input and an output.</p>
<p>I give you some shape and it gets kind of,</p>
<p>I call this in the book a scrunch.</p>
<p>I just had to make up some sort of funny sounding name</p>
<p>for it because it doesn&rsquo;t really have a name.</p>
<p>And just as you can sort of study</p>
<p>which kinds of objects are symmetrical</p>
<p>under the operations of switching left and right</p>
<p>or switching top and bottom</p>
<p>or rotating 40 degrees or what have you,</p>
<p>you could study what kinds of things are preserved</p>
<p>by this kind of scrunch symmetry.</p>
<p>And this kind of more general idea</p>
<p>of what a symmetry can be.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way.</p>
<p>A fundamental mathematical idea,</p>
<p>in some sense, I might even say the idea</p>
<p>that dominates contemporary mathematics.</p>
<p>Or by contemporary, by the way,</p>
<p>I mean like the last like 150 years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on a very long time scale in math.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean like yesterday.</p>
<p>I mean like a century or so up till now.</p>
<p>Is this idea that it&rsquo;s a fundamental question</p>
<p>of when do we consider two things to be the same?</p>
<p>That might seem like a complete triviality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>For instance, if I have a triangle</p>
<p>and I have a triangle of the exact same dimensions,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s over here, are those the same or different?</p>
<p>Well, you might say, well, look,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two different things.</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s over here, this one&rsquo;s over there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you prove a theorem about this one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably still true about this one</p>
<p>if it has like all the same side lanes and angles</p>
<p>and like looks exactly the same.</p>
<p>The term of art, if you want it,</p>
<p>you would say they&rsquo;re congruent.</p>
<p>But one way of saying it is there&rsquo;s a symmetry</p>
<p>called translation, which just means</p>
<p>move everything three inches to the left.</p>
<p>And we want all of our theories</p>
<p>to be translation invariant.</p>
<p>What that means is that if you prove a theorem</p>
<p>about a thing that&rsquo;s over here,</p>
<p>and then you move it three inches to the left,</p>
<p>it would be kind of weird if all of your theorems</p>
<p>like didn&rsquo;t still work.</p>
<p>So this question of like, what are the symmetries</p>
<p>and which things that you want to study</p>
<p>are invariant under those symmetries</p>
<p>is absolutely fundamental.</p>
<p>Boy, this is getting a little abstract, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not at all abstract.</p>
<p>I think this is completely central</p>
<p>to everything I think about</p>
<p>in terms of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know about the MNIST dataset,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s handwritten digits.</p>
<p>And you know, I don&rsquo;t smoke much weed or any really,</p>
<p>but it certainly feels like it when I look at MNIST</p>
<p>and think about this stuff, which is like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between one and two?</p>
<p>And why are all the twos similar to each other?</p>
<p>What kind of transformations are within the category</p>
<p>of what makes a thing the same?</p>
<p>And what kind of transformations</p>
<p>are those that make it different?</p>
<p>And symmetries core to that.</p>
<p>In fact, whatever the hell our brain is doing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good at constructing these arbitrary</p>
<p>and sometimes novel, which is really important</p>
<p>when you look at like the IQ test or they feel novel,</p>
<p>ideas of symmetry of like playing with objects,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to see things that are the same and not</p>
<p>and construct almost like little geometric theories</p>
<p>of what makes things the same and not</p>
<p>and how to make programs do that in AI</p>
<p>is a total open question.</p>
<p>And so I kind of stared and wonder</p>
<p>how, what kind of symmetries are enough to solve</p>
<p>the MNIST handwritten digit recognition problem</p>
<p>and write that down.</p>
<p>And exactly, and what&rsquo;s so fascinating</p>
<p>about the work in that direction</p>
<p>from the point of view of a mathematician like me</p>
<p>and a geometer is that the kind of groups of symmetries,</p>
<p>the types of symmetries that we know of are not sufficient.</p>
<p>So in other words, like we&rsquo;re just gonna keep on going</p>
<p>into the weeds on this.</p>
<p>The deeper, the better.</p>
<p>A kind of symmetry that we understand very well</p>
<p>is rotation.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what would be easy.</p>
<p>If humans, if we recognize the digit as a one,</p>
<p>if it was like literally a rotation</p>
<p>by some number of degrees or some fixed one</p>
<p>in some typeface like Palatino or something,</p>
<p>that would be very easy to understand.</p>
<p>It would be very easy to like write a program</p>
<p>that could detect whether something was a rotation</p>
<p>of a fixed digit one.</p>
<p>Whatever we&rsquo;re doing when you recognize the digit one</p>
<p>and distinguish it from the digit two, it&rsquo;s not that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just incorporating one of the types of symmetries</p>
<p>that we understand.</p>
<p>Now, I would say that I would be shocked</p>
<p>if there was some kind of classical symmetry type formulation</p>
<p>that captured what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>when we tell the difference between a two and a three.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is actually more complicated than that.</p>
<p>I feel like it must be.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so simple, these numbers.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re really geometric objects.</p>
<p>Like we can draw out one, two, three.</p>
<p>It does seem like it should be formalizable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so strange.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s formalizable</p>
<p>when something stops being a two and starts being a three?</p>
<p>Right, you can imagine something continuously deforming</p>
<p>from being a two to a three.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s, there is a moment.</p>
<p>Like I have myself written programs</p>
<p>that literally morph twos and threes and so on.</p>
<p>And you watch, and there is moments that you notice</p>
<p>depending on the trajectory of that transformation,</p>
<p>that morphing, that it is a three and a two.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hard line.</p>
<p>Wait, so if you ask people, if you showed them this morph,</p>
<p>if you ask a bunch of people,</p>
<p>do they all agree about where the transition happened?</p>
<p>Because I would be surprised.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Oh my God, okay, we have an empirical dispute.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem, that if I just showed that moment</p>
<p>that I agreed on.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>No, but say I said,</p>
<p>so I want to move away from the agreement</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a fascinating actually question</p>
<p>that I want to backtrack from because I just dogmatically</p>
<p>said, because I could be very, very wrong.</p>
<p>But the morphing really helps that like the change,</p>
<p>because I mean, partially it&rsquo;s because our perception</p>
<p>systems, see this, it&rsquo;s all probably tied in there.</p>
<p>Somehow the change from one to the other,</p>
<p>like seeing the video of it allows you to pinpoint</p>
<p>the place where a two becomes a three much better.</p>
<p>If I just showed you one picture,</p>
<p>I think you might really, really struggle.</p>
<p>You might call a seven.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something also that we don&rsquo;t often</p>
<p>think about, which is it&rsquo;s not just about the static image,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the transformation of the image,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not a static shape,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the transformation of the shape.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in the movement that seems to be</p>
<p>not just about our perception system,</p>
<p>but fundamental to our cognition,</p>
<p>like how we think about stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s part of geometry too.</p>
<p>And in fact, again, another insight of modern geometry</p>
<p>is this idea that maybe we would naively think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna study, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like Poincare, we&rsquo;re gonna study the three body problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna study sort of like three objects in space</p>
<p>moving around subject only to the force</p>
<p>of each other&rsquo;s gravity, which sounds very simple, right?</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t know about this problem,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably like, okay, so you just like put it</p>
<p>in your computer and see what they do.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a problem that Poincare won a huge prize for</p>
<p>like making the first real progress on in the 1880s.</p>
<p>And we still don&rsquo;t know that much about it 150 years later.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a humongous mystery.</p>
<p>You just opened the door and we&rsquo;re gonna walk right in</p>
<p>before we return to symmetry.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, who&rsquo;s Poincare and what&rsquo;s this conjecture</p>
<p>that he came up with?</p>
<p>Why is it such a hard problem?</p>
<p>Okay, so Poincare, he ends up being a major figure</p>
<p>in the book and I didn&rsquo;t even really intend for him</p>
<p>to be such a big figure, but he&rsquo;s first and foremost</p>
<p>a geometer, right?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a mathematician who kind of comes up</p>
<p>in late 19th century France at a time when French math</p>
<p>is really starting to flower.</p>
<p>Actually, I learned a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, in math, we&rsquo;re not really trained</p>
<p>on our own history.</p>
<p>We got a PhD in math, learned about math.</p>
<p>So I learned a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole kind of moment where France</p>
<p>has just been beaten in the Franco Prussian war.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh my God, what did we do wrong?</p>
<p>And they were like, we gotta get strong in math</p>
<p>like the Germans.</p>
<p>We have to be like more like the Germans.</p>
<p>So this never happens to us again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very much, it&rsquo;s like the Sputnik moment,</p>
<p>like what happens in America in the 50s and 60s</p>
<p>with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This is happening to France and they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to kind of like instantly like modernize.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating that the humans and mathematics</p>
<p>are intricately connected to the history of humans.</p>
<p>The Cold War is I think fundamental to the way people</p>
<p>saw science and math in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that was true in the United States,</p>
<p>but certainly it was in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It definitely was, and I would love to hear more</p>
<p>about how it was in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I mean, there was, and we&rsquo;ll talk about the Olympiad.</p>
<p>I just remember that there was this feeling</p>
<p>like the world hung in a balance</p>
<p>and you could save the world with the tools of science.</p>
<p>And mathematics was like the superpower that fuels science.</p>
<p>And so like people were seen as, you know,</p>
<p>people in America often idolize athletes,</p>
<p>but ultimately the best athletes in the world,</p>
<p>they just throw a ball into a basket.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s not, what people really enjoy about sports,</p>
<p>I love sports, is like excellence at the highest level.</p>
<p>But when you take that with mathematics and science,</p>
<p>people also enjoyed excellence in science and mathematics</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union, but there&rsquo;s an extra sense</p>
<p>that that excellence would lead to a better world.</p>
<p>So that created all the usual things you think about</p>
<p>with the Olympics, which is like extreme competitiveness.</p>
<p>But it also created this sense that in the modern era</p>
<p>in America, somebody like Elon Musk, whatever you think</p>
<p>of him, like Jeff Bezos, those folks,</p>
<p>they inspire the possibility that one person</p>
<p>or a group of smart people can change the world.</p>
<p>Like not just be good at what they do,</p>
<p>but actually change the world.</p>
<p>Mathematics was at the core of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s a romanticism around it too.</p>
<p>Like when you read books about in America,</p>
<p>people romanticize certain things like baseball, for example.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like these beautiful poetic writing</p>
<p>about the game of baseball.</p>
<p>The same was the feeling with mathematics and science</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union, and it was in the air.</p>
<p>Everybody was forced to take high level mathematics courses.</p>
<p>Like you took a lot of math, you took a lot of science</p>
<p>and a lot of like really rigorous literature.</p>
<p>Like the level of education in Russia,</p>
<p>this could be true in China, I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>in a lot of countries is in whatever that&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s K to 12 in America, but like young people education.</p>
<p>The level they were challenged to learn at is incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like America falls far behind, I would say.</p>
<p>America then quickly catches up</p>
<p>and then exceeds everybody else as you start approaching</p>
<p>the end of high school to college.</p>
<p>Like the university system in the United States</p>
<p>arguably is the best in the world.</p>
<p>But like what we challenge everybody,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just like the good, the A students,</p>
<p>but everybody to learn in the Soviet Union was fascinating.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m gonna pick up on something you said.</p>
<p>I think you would love a book called</p>
<p>Dual at Dawn by Amir Alexander,</p>
<p>which I think some of the things you&rsquo;re responding to</p>
<p>and what I wrote, I think I first got turned on to</p>
<p>by Amir&rsquo;s work, he&rsquo;s a historian of math.</p>
<p>And he writes about the story of Everest to Galois,</p>
<p>which is a story that&rsquo;s well known to all mathematicians,</p>
<p>this kind of like very, very romantic figure</p>
<p>who he really sort of like begins the development of this</p>
<p>or this theory of groups that I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>this general theory of symmetries</p>
<p>and then dies in a duel in his early 20s,</p>
<p>like all this stuff, mostly unpublished.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, very romantic story that we all learn.</p>
<p>And much of it is true,</p>
<p>but Alexander really lays out just how much</p>
<p>the way people thought about math in those times</p>
<p>in the early 19th century was wound up with,</p>
<p>as you say, romanticism.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s when the romantic movement takes place</p>
<p>and he really outlines how people were predisposed</p>
<p>to think about mathematics in that way</p>
<p>because they thought about poetry that way</p>
<p>and they thought about music that way.</p>
<p>It was the mood of the era to think about</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re reaching for the transcendent,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sort of reaching for sort of direct contact</p>
<p>with the divine.</p>
<p>And part of the reason that we think of Gawa that way</p>
<p>was because Gawa himself was a creature of that era</p>
<p>and he romanticized himself.</p>
<p>I mean, now we know he wrote lots of letters</p>
<p>and he was kind of like, I mean, in modern terms,</p>
<p>we would say he was extremely emo.</p>
<p>Like we wrote all these letters</p>
<p>about his like florid feelings</p>
<p>and like the fire within him about the mathematics.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just as you say</p>
<p>that the math history touches human history.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re never separate because math is made of people.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what, it&rsquo;s people who do it</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re human beings doing it</p>
<p>and we do it within whatever community we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and we do it affected by the mores</p>
<p>of the society around us.</p>
<p>So the French, the Germans and Poincare.</p>
<p>Yes, okay, so back to Poincare.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>This book is filled with kind of mathematical characters</p>
<p>who often are kind of peevish or get into feuds</p>
<p>or sort of have like weird enthusiasms</p>
<p>because those people are fun to write about</p>
<p>and they sort of like say very salty things.</p>
<p>Poincare is actually none of this.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, he was an extremely normal dude</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t get into fights with people</p>
<p>and everybody liked him</p>
<p>and he was like pretty personally modest</p>
<p>and he had very regular habits.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>He did math for like four hours in the morning</p>
<p>and four hours in the evening and that was it.</p>
<p>Like he had his schedule.</p>
<p>I actually, it was like, I still am feeling like</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s gonna tell me now that the book is out,</p>
<p>like, oh, didn&rsquo;t you know about this</p>
<p>like incredibly sordid episode?</p>
<p>As far as I could tell, a completely normal guy.</p>
<p>But he just kind of, in many ways,</p>
<p>creates the geometric world in which we live</p>
<p>and his first really big success is this prize paper</p>
<p>he writes for this prize offered by the King of Sweden</p>
<p>for the study of the three body problem.</p>
<p>The study of what we can say about, yeah,</p>
<p>three astronomical objects moving</p>
<p>in what you might think would be this very simple way.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s going on except gravity.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the three body problem?</p>
<p>Why is it a problem?</p>
<p>So the problem is to understand</p>
<p>when this motion is stable and when it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So stable meaning they would sort of like end up</p>
<p>in some kind of periodic orbit.</p>
<p>Or I guess it would mean, sorry,</p>
<p>stable would mean they never sort of fly off</p>
<p>far apart from each other.</p>
<p>And unstable would mean like eventually they fly apart.</p>
<p>So understanding two bodies is much easier.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>When you have the third wheel is always a problem.</p>
<p>This is what Newton knew.</p>
<p>Two bodies, they sort of orbit each other</p>
<p>in some kind of either in an ellipse,</p>
<p>which is the stable case.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s what the planets do that we know.</p>
<p>Or one travels on a hyperbola around the other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the unstable case.</p>
<p>It sort of like zooms in from far away,</p>
<p>sort of like whips around the heavier thing</p>
<p>and like zooms out.</p>
<p>Those are basically the two options.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very simple and easy to classify story.</p>
<p>With three bodies, just the small switch from two to three,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a complete zoo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first, what we would say now</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s the first example of what&rsquo;s called chaotic dynamics,</p>
<p>where the stable solutions and the unstable solutions,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of like wound in among each other.</p>
<p>And a very, very, very tiny change in the initial conditions</p>
<p>can make the longterm behavior of the system</p>
<p>completely different.</p>
<p>So Poincare was the first to recognize</p>
<p>that that phenomenon even existed.</p>
<p>What about the conjecture that carries his name?</p>
<p>Right, so he also was one of the pioneers</p>
<p>of taking geometry, which until that point</p>
<p>had been largely the study of two</p>
<p>and three dimensional objects,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s like what we see, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s those are the objects we interact with.</p>
<p>He developed the subject we now called topology.</p>
<p>He called it analysis situs.</p>
<p>He was a very well spoken guy with a lot of slogans,</p>
<p>but that name did not,</p>
<p>you can see why that name did not catch on.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s called topology now.</p>
<p>Sorry, what was it called before?</p>
<p>Analysis situs, which I guess sort of roughly means</p>
<p>like the analysis of location or something like that.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a Latin phrase.</p>
<p>Partly because he understood that even to understand</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s going on in our physical world,</p>
<p>you have to study higher dimensional spaces.</p>
<p>How does this work?</p>
<p>And this is kind of like where my brain went to it</p>
<p>because you were talking about not just where things are,</p>
<p>but what their path is, how they&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>when we were talking about the path from two to three.</p>
<p>He understood that if you wanna study</p>
<p>three bodies moving in space,</p>
<p>well, each body, it has a location where it is.</p>
<p>So it has an X coordinate, a Y coordinate,</p>
<p>a Z coordinate, right?</p>
<p>I can specify a point in space by giving you three numbers,</p>
<p>but it also at each moment has a velocity.</p>
<p>So it turns out that really to understand what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t think of it as a point or you could,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s better not to think of it as a point</p>
<p>in three dimensional space that&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to think of it as a point</p>
<p>in six dimensional space where the coordinates</p>
<p>are where is it and what&rsquo;s its velocity right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a higher dimensional space called phase space.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t thought about this before,</p>
<p>I admit that it&rsquo;s a little bit mind bending,</p>
<p>but what he needed then was a geometry</p>
<p>that was flexible enough,</p>
<p>not just to talk about two dimensional spaces</p>
<p>or three dimensional spaces, but any dimensional space.</p>
<p>So the sort of famous first line of this paper</p>
<p>where he introduces analysis of Cetus</p>
<p>is no one doubts nowadays that the geometry</p>
<p>of n dimensional space is an actually existing thing, right?</p>
<p>I think that maybe that had been controversial.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s saying like, look, let&rsquo;s face it,</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s not physical doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t study it.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t jumping to the physical interpretation.</p>
<p>Like it can be real,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not perceivable to the human cognition.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think, don&rsquo;t get me wrong,</p>
<p>Poincare never strays far from physics.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always motivated by physics,</p>
<p>but the physics drove him to need to think about spaces</p>
<p>of higher dimension.</p>
<p>And so he needed a formalism that was rich enough</p>
<p>to enable him to do that.</p>
<p>And once you do that,</p>
<p>that formalism is also gonna include things</p>
<p>that are not physical.</p>
<p>And then you have two choices.</p>
<p>You can be like, oh, well, that stuff&rsquo;s trash.</p>
<p>Or, and this is more of the mathematicians frame of mind,</p>
<p>if you have a formalistic framework</p>
<p>that like seems really good</p>
<p>and sort of seems to be like very elegant and work well,</p>
<p>and it includes all the physical stuff,</p>
<p>maybe we should think about all of it.</p>
<p>Like maybe we should think about it,</p>
<p>thinking maybe there&rsquo;s some gold to be mined there.</p>
<p>And indeed, like, you know, guess what?</p>
<p>Like before long there&rsquo;s relativity and there&rsquo;s space time.</p>
<p>And like all of a sudden it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, maybe it&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>We already had this geometric apparatus like set up</p>
<p>for like how to think about four dimensional spaces,</p>
<p>like turns out they&rsquo;re real after all.</p>
<p>As I said, you know, this is a story much told</p>
<p>right in mathematics, not just in this context,</p>
<p>but in many.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to dig in a little deeper on that actually,</p>
<p>cause I have some intuitions to work out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>My brain.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not a mathematical physicist,</p>
<p>so we can work them out together.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll together walk along the path of curiosity,</p>
<p>but Poincare conjecture.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>The Poincare conjecture is about curved</p>
<p>three dimensional spaces.</p>
<p>So I was on my way there.</p>
<p>I promise.</p>
<p>The idea is that we perceive ourselves as living in,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t say a three dimensional space.</p>
<p>We just say three dimensional space.</p>
<p>You know, you can go up and down,</p>
<p>you can go left and right,</p>
<p>you can go forward and back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three dimensions in which we can move.</p>
<p>In Poincare&rsquo;s theory,</p>
<p>there are many possible three dimensional spaces.</p>
<p>In the same way that going down one dimension</p>
<p>to sort of capture our intuition a little bit more,</p>
<p>we know there are lots of different</p>
<p>two dimensional surfaces, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a balloon and that looks one way</p>
<p>and a donut looks another way</p>
<p>and a Mobius strip looks a third way.</p>
<p>Those are all like two dimensional surfaces</p>
<p>that we can kind of really get a global view of</p>
<p>because we live in three dimensional space.</p>
<p>So we can see a two dimensional surface</p>
<p>sort of sitting in our three dimensional space.</p>
<p>Well, to see a three dimensional space whole,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have to kind of have four dimensional eyes, right?</p>
<p>Which we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So we have to use our mathematical eyes.</p>
<p>We have to envision.</p>
<p>The Poincare conjecture says that there&rsquo;s a very simple way</p>
<p>to determine whether a three dimensional space</p>
<p>is the standard one, the one that we&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>And essentially it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>fundamental group has nothing interesting in it.</p>
<p>And that I can actually say without saying</p>
<p>what the fundamental group is,</p>
<p>I can tell you what the criterion is.</p>
<p>This would be good.</p>
<p>Oh, look, I can even use a visual aid.</p>
<p>So for the people watching this on YouTube,</p>
<p>you will just see this for the people on the podcast,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have to visualize it.</p>
<p>So Lex has been nice enough to like give me a surface</p>
<p>with an interesting topology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mug right here in front of me.</p>
<p>A mug, yes.</p>
<p>I might say it&rsquo;s a genus one surface,</p>
<p>but we could also say it&rsquo;s a mug, same thing.</p>
<p>So if I were to draw a little circle on this mug,</p>
<p>which way should I draw it so it&rsquo;s visible?</p>
<p>Like here, okay.</p>
<p>If I draw a little circle on this mug,</p>
<p>imagine this to be a loop of string.</p>
<p>I could pull that loop of string closed</p>
<p>on the surface of the mug, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely something I could do.</p>
<p>I could shrink it, shrink it, shrink it until it&rsquo;s a point.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>if I draw a loop that goes around the handle,</p>
<p>I can kind of zhuzh it up here</p>
<p>and I can zhuzh it down there</p>
<p>and I can sort of slide it up and down the handle,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t pull it closed, can I?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trapped.</p>
<p>Not without breaking the surface of the mug, right?</p>
<p>Not without like going inside.</p>
<p>So the condition of being what&rsquo;s called simply connected,</p>
<p>this is one of Poincare&rsquo;s inventions,</p>
<p>says that any loop of string can be pulled shut.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a feature that the mug simply does not have.</p>
<p>This is a non simply connected mug</p>
<p>and a simply connected mug would be a cup, right?</p>
<p>You would burn your hand when you drank coffee out of it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying the universe is not a mug.</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t speak to the universe,</p>
<p>but what I can say is that regular old space is not a mug.</p>
<p>Regular old space,</p>
<p>if you like sort of actually physically have</p>
<p>like a loop of string,</p>
<p>you can pull it shut.</p>
<p>You can always pull it shut.</p>
<p>But what if your piece of string</p>
<p>was the size of the universe?</p>
<p>Like what if your piece of string</p>
<p>was like billions of light years long?</p>
<p>Like how do you actually know?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s still an open question</p>
<p>of the shape of the universe.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>there is ideas of it being a torus.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some trippy ideas</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not like weird out there controversial.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s legitimate at the center of a cosmology debate.</p>
<p>I mean, I think most people think it&rsquo;s flat.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some kind of dodecahedral symmetry</p>
<p>or I mean, I remember reading something crazy</p>
<p>about somebody saying that they saw the signature of that</p>
<p>in the cosmic noise or what have you.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>To make the flat earthers happy,</p>
<p>I do believe that the current main belief is it&rsquo;s flat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s flat ish or something like that.</p>
<p>The shape of the universe is flat ish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the heck that means.</p>
<p>I think that has like a very,</p>
<p>how are you even supposed to think about the shape</p>
<p>of a thing that doesn&rsquo;t have any thing outside of it?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Ah, but that&rsquo;s exactly what topology does.</p>
<p>Topology is what&rsquo;s called an intrinsic theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so great about it.</p>
<p>This question about the mug,</p>
<p>you could answer it without ever leaving the mug, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a question about a loop drawn</p>
<p>on the surface of the mug</p>
<p>and what happens if it never leaves that surface.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like always there.</p>
<p>See, but that&rsquo;s the difference between the topology</p>
<p>and say, if you&rsquo;re like trying to visualize a mug,</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t visualize a mug while living inside the mug.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>The visualization is harder, but in some sense,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But if the tools of mathematics are there,</p>
<p>I, sorry, I don&rsquo;t want to fight,</p>
<p>but I think the tools of mathematics are exactly there</p>
<p>to enable you to think about</p>
<p>what you cannot visualize in this way.</p>
<p>Let me give, let&rsquo;s go, always to make things easier,</p>
<p>go down to dimension.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about we live in a circle, okay?</p>
<p>You can tell whether you live on a circle or a line segment,</p>
<p>because if you live in a circle,</p>
<p>if you walk a long way in one direction,</p>
<p>you find yourself back where you started.</p>
<p>And if you live in a line segment,</p>
<p>you walk for a long enough one direction,</p>
<p>you come to the end of the world.</p>
<p>Or if you live on a line, like a whole line,</p>
<p>infinite line, then you walk in one direction</p>
<p>for a long time and like,</p>
<p>well, then there&rsquo;s not a sort of terminating algorithm</p>
<p>to figure out whether you live on a line or a circle,</p>
<p>but at least you sort of,</p>
<p>at least you don&rsquo;t discover that you live on a circle.</p>
<p>So all of those are intrinsic things, right?</p>
<p>All of those are things that you can figure out</p>
<p>about your world without leaving your world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, ready?</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to go from intrinsic to extrinsic.</p>
<p>Boy, did I not know we were going to talk about this,</p>
<p>but why not?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t tell whether you live in a circle</p>
<p>or a knot, like imagine like a knot</p>
<p>floating in three dimensional space.</p>
<p>The person who lives on that knot, to them it&rsquo;s a circle.</p>
<p>They walk a long way, they come back to where they started.</p>
<p>Now we, with our three dimensional eyes can be like,</p>
<p>oh, this one&rsquo;s just a plain circle</p>
<p>and this one&rsquo;s knotted up,</p>
<p>but that has to do with how they sit</p>
<p>in three dimensional space.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to do with intrinsic features</p>
<p>of those people&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>We can ask you one ape to another.</p>
<p>Does it make you, how does it make you feel</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t know if you live in a circle</p>
<p>or on a knot, in a knot,</p>
<p>inside the string that forms the knot?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how to say that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be honest with you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, I fear you won&rsquo;t like this answer,</p>
<p>but it does not bother me at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t lose one minute of sleep over it.</p>
<p>So like, does it bother you that if we look</p>
<p>at like a Mobius strip, that you don&rsquo;t have an obvious way</p>
<p>of knowing whether you are inside of a cylinder,</p>
<p>if you live on a surface of a cylinder</p>
<p>or you live on the surface of a Mobius strip?</p>
<p>No, I think you can tell if you live.</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>Because what you do is you like tell your friend,</p>
<p>hey, stay right here, I&rsquo;m just going to go for a walk.</p>
<p>And then you like walk for a long time in one direction</p>
<p>and then you come back and you see your friend again.</p>
<p>And if your friend is reversed,</p>
<p>then you know you live on a Mobius strip.</p>
<p>Well, no, because you won&rsquo;t see your friend, right?</p>
<p>Okay, fair point, fair point on that.</p>
<p>But you have to believe the stories about,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t even know, would you even know?</p>
<p>Would you really?</p>
<p>Oh, no, your point is right.</p>
<p>Let me try to think of a better,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see if I can do this on the fly.</p>
<p>It may not be correct to talk about cognitive beings</p>
<p>living on a Mobius strip</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of things taken for granted there.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re constantly imagining actual</p>
<p>like three dimensional creatures,</p>
<p>like how it actually feels like to live in a Mobius strip</p>
<p>is tricky to internalize.</p>
<p>I think that on what&rsquo;s called the real protective plane,</p>
<p>which is kind of even more sort of like messed up version</p>
<p>of the Mobius strip, but with very similar features,</p>
<p>this feature of kind of like only having one side,</p>
<p>that has the feature that there&rsquo;s a loop of string</p>
<p>which can&rsquo;t be pulled closed.</p>
<p>But if you loop it around twice along the same path,</p>
<p>that you can pull closed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s extremely weird.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that would be a way you could know</p>
<p>without leaving your world</p>
<p>that something very funny is going on.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s extremely weird?</p>
<p>Maybe we can comment on,</p>
<p>hopefully it&rsquo;s not too much of a tangent is,</p>
<p>I remember thinking about this,</p>
<p>this might be right, this might be wrong.</p>
<p>But if we now talk about a sphere</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re living inside a sphere,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to see everywhere around you,</p>
<p>the back of your own head.</p>
<p>That I was,</p>
<p>cause like I was,</p>
<p>this is very counterintuitive to me to think about,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>But cause I was thinking of like earth,</p>
<p>your 3D thing sitting on a sphere.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re living inside the sphere,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re going to see, if you look straight,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always going to see yourself all the way around.</p>
<p>So everywhere you look, there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>the back of your own head.</p>
<p>I think somehow this depends on something</p>
<p>of like how the physics of light works in this scenario,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m sort of finding it hard to bend my.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>The sea is doing a lot of work.</p>
<p>Like saying you see something is doing a lot of work.</p>
<p>People have thought about this a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, this metaphor of like,</p>
<p>what if we&rsquo;re like little creatures</p>
<p>in some sort of smaller world?</p>
<p>Like how could we apprehend what&rsquo;s outside?</p>
<p>That metaphor just comes back and back.</p>
<p>And actually I didn&rsquo;t even realize like how frequent it is.</p>
<p>It comes up in the book a lot.</p>
<p>I know it from a book called Flatland.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you ever read this when you were a kid.</p>
<p>A while ago, yeah.</p>
<p>An adult.</p>
<p>You know, this sort of comic novel from the 19th century</p>
<p>about an entire two dimensional world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s narrated by a square.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main character.</p>
<p>And the kind of strangeness that befalls him</p>
<p>when one day he&rsquo;s in his house</p>
<p>and suddenly there&rsquo;s like a little circle there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re with him.</p>
<p>But then the circle like starts getting bigger</p>
<p>and bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, what the hell is going on?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a horror movie, like for two dimensional people.</p>
<p>And of course what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is that a sphere is entering his world.</p>
<p>And as the sphere kind of like moves farther and farther</p>
<p>into the plane, it&rsquo;s cross section.</p>
<p>The part of it that he can see.</p>
<p>To him, it looks like there&rsquo;s like this kind</p>
<p>of bizarre being that&rsquo;s like getting larger</p>
<p>and larger and larger</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s exactly sort of halfway through.</p>
<p>And then they have this kind of like philosophical argument</p>
<p>where the sphere is like, I&rsquo;m a sphere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from the third dimension.</p>
<p>The square is like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing.</p>
<p>And they have this kind of like sterile argument</p>
<p>where the square is not able to kind of like</p>
<p>follow the mathematical reasoning of the sphere</p>
<p>until the sphere just kind of grabs him</p>
<p>and like jerks him out of the plane and pulls him up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like now, like now do you see,</p>
<p>like now do you see your whole world</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t understand before?</p>
<p>So do you think that kind of process is possible</p>
<p>for us humans?</p>
<p>So we live in the three dimensional world,</p>
<p>maybe with the time component four dimensional</p>
<p>and then math allows us to go high,</p>
<p>into high dimensions comfortably</p>
<p>and explore the world from those perspectives.</p>
<p>Like, is it possible that the universe</p>
<p>is many more dimensions than the ones</p>
<p>we experience as human beings?</p>
<p>So if you look at the, you know,</p>
<p>especially in physics theories of everything,</p>
<p>physics theories that try to unify general relativity</p>
<p>and quantum field theory,</p>
<p>they seem to go to high dimensions to work stuff out</p>
<p>through the tools of mathematics.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>So like the two options are,</p>
<p>one is just a nice way to analyze a universe,</p>
<p>but the reality is, is as exactly we perceive it,</p>
<p>it is three dimensional, or are we just seeing,</p>
<p>are we those flatland creatures</p>
<p>that are just seeing a tiny slice of reality</p>
<p>and the actual reality is many, many, many more dimensions</p>
<p>than the three dimensions we perceive?</p>
<p>Oh, I certainly think that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Now, how would you figure out whether it was true or not</p>
<p>is another question.</p>
<p>And I suppose what you would do</p>
<p>as with anything else that you can&rsquo;t directly perceive</p>
<p>is you would try to understand</p>
<p>what effect the presence of those extra dimensions</p>
<p>out there would have on the things we can perceive.</p>
<p>Like what else can you do, right?</p>
<p>And in some sense, if the answer is</p>
<p>they would have no effect,</p>
<p>then maybe it becomes like a little bit</p>
<p>of a sterile question,</p>
<p>because what question are you even asking, right?</p>
<p>You can kind of posit however many entities that you want.</p>
<p>Is it possible to intuit how to mess</p>
<p>with the other dimensions</p>
<p>while living in a three dimensional world?</p>
<p>I mean, that seems like a very challenging thing to do.</p>
<p>The reason flatland could be written</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s coming from a three dimensional writer.</p>
<p>Yes, but what happens in the book,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even tell you the whole plot.</p>
<p>What happens is the square is so excited</p>
<p>and so filled with intellectual joy.</p>
<p>By the way, maybe to give the story some context,</p>
<p>you asked like, is it possible for us humans</p>
<p>to have this experience of being transcendentally jerked</p>
<p>out of our world so we can sort of truly see it from above?</p>
<p>Well, Edwin Abbott who wrote the book</p>
<p>certainly thought so because Edwin Abbott was a minister.</p>
<p>So the whole Christian subtext of this book,</p>
<p>I had completely not grasped reading this as a kid,</p>
<p>that it means a very different thing, right?</p>
<p>If sort of a theologian is saying like,</p>
<p>oh, what if a higher being could like pull you out</p>
<p>of this earthly world you live in</p>
<p>so that you can sort of see the truth</p>
<p>and like really see it from above as it were.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the things that&rsquo;s going on for him.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a testament to his skill as a writer</p>
<p>that his story just works whether that&rsquo;s the framework</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re coming to it from or not.</p>
<p>But what happens in this book and this part,</p>
<p>now looking at it through a Christian lens,</p>
<p>it becomes a bit subversive is the square is so excited</p>
<p>about what he&rsquo;s learned from the sphere</p>
<p>and the sphere explains to him like what a cube would be.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s like you but three dimensional</p>
<p>and the square is very excited</p>
<p>and the square is like, okay, I get it now.</p>
<p>So like now that you explained to me how just by reason</p>
<p>I can figure out what a cube would be like,</p>
<p>like a three dimensional version of me,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s figure out what a four dimensional version</p>
<p>of me would be like.</p>
<p>And then the sphere is like,</p>
<p>what the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fourth dimension, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s three dimensions,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s how many there are, I can see.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, it&rsquo;s this sort of comic moment</p>
<p>where the sphere is completely unable to conceptualize</p>
<p>that there could actually be yet another dimension.</p>
<p>So yeah, that takes the religious allegory</p>
<p>like a very weird place that I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>like understand theologically, but.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice way to talk about religion and myth in general</p>
<p>as perhaps us trying to struggle,</p>
<p>us meaning human civilization, trying to struggle</p>
<p>with ideas that are beyond our cognitive capabilities.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in fact not beyond our capability.</p>
<p>It may be beyond our cognitive capabilities</p>
<p>to visualize a four dimensional cube,</p>
<p>a tesseract as some like to call it,</p>
<p>or a five dimensional cube, or a six dimensional cube,</p>
<p>but it is not beyond our cognitive capabilities</p>
<p>to figure out how many corners</p>
<p>a six dimensional cube would have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so cool about us.</p>
<p>Whether we can visualize it or not,</p>
<p>we can still talk about it, we can still reason about it,</p>
<p>we can still figure things out about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, if we go back to this, first of all, to the mug,</p>
<p>but to the example you give in the book of the straw,</p>
<p>how many holes does a straw have?</p>
<p>And you, listener, may try to answer that in your own head.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna take a drink while everybody thinks about it</p>
<p>so we can give you a moment.</p>
<p>A slow sip.</p>
<p>Is it zero, one, or two, or more than that maybe?</p>
<p>Maybe you can get very creative.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of interesting to each,</p>
<p>dissecting each answer as you do in the book</p>
<p>is quite brilliant.</p>
<p>People should definitely check it out.</p>
<p>But if you could try to answer it now,</p>
<p>think about all the options</p>
<p>and why they may or may not be right.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s one of these questions</p>
<p>where people on first hearing it think it&rsquo;s a triviality</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, well, the answer is obvious.</p>
<p>And then what happens if you ever ask a group of people</p>
<p>that something wonderfully comic happens,</p>
<p>which is that everyone&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s completely obvious.</p>
<p>And then each person realizes that half the person,</p>
<p>the other people in the room</p>
<p>have a different obvious answer for the way they have.</p>
<p>And then people get really heated.</p>
<p>People are like, I can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that you think it has two holes</p>
<p>or like, I can&rsquo;t believe that you think it has one.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you really,</p>
<p>like people really learn something about each other</p>
<p>and people get heated.</p>
<p>I mean, can we go through the possible options here?</p>
<p>Is it zero, one, two, three, 10?</p>
<p>Sure, so I think, you know, most people,</p>
<p>the zero holders are rare.</p>
<p>They would say like, well, look,</p>
<p>you can make a straw by taking a rectangular piece of plastic</p>
<p>and closing it up.</p>
<p>A rectangular piece of plastic doesn&rsquo;t have a hole in it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t poke a hole in it when I,</p>
<p>so how can I have a hole?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be like, it&rsquo;s just one thing.</p>
<p>Okay, most people don&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a&hellip;</p>
<p>Is there any truth to that kind of conception?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that would be somebody who&rsquo;s account, I mean,</p>
<p>what I would say is you could say the same thing</p>
<p>about a bagel.</p>
<p>You could say, I can make a bagel by taking like a long</p>
<p>cylinder of dough, which doesn&rsquo;t have a hole</p>
<p>and then schmushing the ends together.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a bagel.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re really committed, you can be like, okay,</p>
<p>a bagel doesn&rsquo;t have a hole either.</p>
<p>But like, who are you if you say a bagel doesn&rsquo;t have a hole?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s almost like an engineering definition of it.</p>
<p>Okay, fair enough.</p>
<p>So what about the other options?</p>
<p>So, you know, one whole people would say&hellip;</p>
<p>I like how these are like groups of people.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve planted our foot, this is what we stand for.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s books written about each belief.</p>
<p>You know, I would say, look, there&rsquo;s like a hole</p>
<p>and it goes all the way through the straw, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one region of space, that&rsquo;s the hole.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>And two whole people would say like, well, look,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hole in the top and a hole at the bottom.</p>
<p>I think a common thing you see when people</p>
<p>argue about this, they would take something like this</p>
<p>bottle of water I&rsquo;m holding and go open it and they say,</p>
<p>well, how many holes are there in this?</p>
<p>And you say like, well, there&rsquo;s one hole at the top.</p>
<p>Okay, what if I like poke a hole here</p>
<p>so that all the water spills out?</p>
<p>Well, now it&rsquo;s a straw.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a one holder, I say to you like,</p>
<p>well, how many holes are in it now?</p>
<p>There was one hole in it before</p>
<p>and I poked a new hole in it.</p>
<p>And then you think there&rsquo;s still one hole</p>
<p>even though there was one hole and I made one more?</p>
<p>Clearly not, this is two holes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And yet if you&rsquo;re a two holder, the one holder will say like,</p>
<p>okay, where does one hole begin and the other hole end?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And in the book, I sort of, you know, in math,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things we do when we&rsquo;re faced with a problem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s confusing us.</p>
<p>We can make the problem simpler.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we were doing a minute ago</p>
<p>when we were talking about high dimensional space.</p>
<p>And I was like, let&rsquo;s talk about like circles</p>
<p>and line segments.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s like go down a dimension to make it easier.</p>
<p>The other big move we have is to make the problem harder</p>
<p>and try to sort of really like face up</p>
<p>to what are the complications.</p>
<p>So, you know, what I do in the book is say like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s stop talking about straws for a minute</p>
<p>and talk about pants.</p>
<p>How many holes are there in a pair of pants?</p>
<p>So I think most people who say there&rsquo;s two holes in a straw</p>
<p>would say there&rsquo;s three holes in a pair of pants.</p>
<p>I guess, I mean, I guess we&rsquo;re filming only from here.</p>
<p>I could take up, no, I&rsquo;m not gonna do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll just have to imagine the pants, sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Lex, if you want to, no, okay, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be in the director&rsquo;s cut.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that Patreon only footage.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>So many people would say there&rsquo;s three holes</p>
<p>in a pair of pants.</p>
<p>But you know, for instance, my daughter, when I asked,</p>
<p>by the way, talking to kids about this is super fun.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>What did she say?</p>
<p>She said, well, yeah, I feel a pair of pants</p>
<p>like just has two holes because yes, there&rsquo;s the waist,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just the two leg holes stuck together.</p>
<p>Whoa, okay.</p>
<p>Two leg holes, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>I mean, that really is a good combination.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s a one holder for the straw.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s a one holder for the straw too.</p>
<p>And that really does capture something.</p>
<p>It captures this fact, which is central</p>
<p>to the theory of what&rsquo;s called homology,</p>
<p>which is like a central part of modern topology</p>
<p>that holes, whatever we may mean by them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re somehow things which have an arithmetic to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re things which can be added.</p>
<p>Like the waist, like waist equals leg plus leg</p>
<p>is kind of an equation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not an equation about numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an equation about some kind of geometric,</p>
<p>some kind of topological thing, which is very strange.</p>
<p>And so, you know, when I come down, you know,</p>
<p>like a rabbi, I like to kind of like come up</p>
<p>with these answers and somehow like dodge</p>
<p>the original question and say like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re both right, my children.</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So for the straw, I think what a modern mathematician</p>
<p>would say is like, the first version would be to say like,</p>
<p>well, there are two holes,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re really both the same hole.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not quite right.</p>
<p>A better way to say it is there&rsquo;s two holes,</p>
<p>but one is the negative of the other.</p>
<p>Now, what can that mean?</p>
<p>One way of thinking about what it means is that</p>
<p>if you sip something like a milkshake through the straw,</p>
<p>no matter what, the amount of milkshake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s flowing in one end,</p>
<p>that same amount is flowing out the other end.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not independent from each other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some relationship between them.</p>
<p>In the same way that if you somehow</p>
<p>could like suck a milkshake through a pair of pants,</p>
<p>the amount of milkshake,</p>
<p>just go with me on this thought experiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m right there with you.</p>
<p>The amount of milkshake that&rsquo;s coming in</p>
<p>the left leg of the pants,</p>
<p>plus the amount of milkshake that&rsquo;s coming in</p>
<p>the right leg of the pants,</p>
<p>is the same that&rsquo;s coming out the waist of the pants.</p>
<p>So just so you know, I fasted for 72 hours</p>
<p>the last three days.</p>
<p>So I just broke the fast with a little bit of food yesterday.</p>
<p>So this sounds, food analogies or metaphors</p>
<p>for this podcast work wonderfully</p>
<p>because I can intensely picture it.</p>
<p>Is that your weekly routine or just in preparation</p>
<p>for talking about geometry for three hours?</p>
<p>Exactly, this is just for this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hardship to purify the mind.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s for the first time,</p>
<p>I just wanted to try the experience.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>And just to pause,</p>
<p>to do things that are out of the ordinary,</p>
<p>to pause and to reflect on how grateful I am</p>
<p>to be just alive and be able to do all the cool shit</p>
<p>that I get to do, so.</p>
<p>Did you drink water?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Water and salt, so like electrolytes</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But anyway, so the inflow on the top of the pants</p>
<p>equals to the outflow on the bottom of the pants.</p>
<p>Exactly, so this idea that,</p>
<p>I mean, I think, you know, Poincare really had this idea,</p>
<p>this sort of modern idea.</p>
<p>I mean, building on stuff other people did,</p>
<p>Betty is an important one,</p>
<p>of this kind of modern notion of relations between holes.</p>
<p>But the idea that holes really had an arithmetic,</p>
<p>the really modern view was really Emmy Noether&rsquo;s idea.</p>
<p>So she kind of comes in and sort of truly puts the subject</p>
<p>on its modern footing that we have now.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s always a challenge, you know,</p>
<p>in the book, I&rsquo;m not gonna say I give like a course</p>
<p>so that you read this chapter and then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s just like I took like a semester</p>
<p>of algebraic anthropology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like this and it&rsquo;s always a challenge</p>
<p>writing about math because there are some things</p>
<p>that you can really do on the page and the math is there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other things which it&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>in a book like this to like do them all the page.</p>
<p>You can only say something about them, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>So, you know, in the book, I try to do some of both.</p>
<p>I try to do, I try to, topics that are,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really compress and really truly say</p>
<p>exactly what they are in this amount of space.</p>
<p>I try to say something interesting about them,</p>
<p>something meaningful about them</p>
<p>so that readers can get the flavor.</p>
<p>And then in other places,</p>
<p>I really try to get up close and personal</p>
<p>and really do the math and have it take place on the page.</p>
<p>To some degree be able to give inklings</p>
<p>of the beauty of the subject.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of books that are like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite know how to express this well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still laboring to do it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of books that are about stuff,</p>
<p>but I want my books to not only be about stuff,</p>
<p>but to actually have some stuff there on the page</p>
<p>in the book for people to interact with directly</p>
<p>and not just sort of hear me talk about</p>
<p>distant features of it.</p>
<p>Right, so not be talking just about ideas,</p>
<p>but the actually be expressing the idea.</p>
<p>Is there, you know, somebody in the,</p>
<p>maybe you can comment, there&rsquo;s a guy,</p>
<p>his YouTube channel is 3Blue1Brown, Grant Sanderson.</p>
<p>He does that masterfully well.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Of visualizing, of expressing a particular idea</p>
<p>and then talking about it as well back and forth.</p>
<p>What do you think about Grant?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I mean, the flowering of math YouTube</p>
<p>is like such a wonderful thing</p>
<p>because math teaching, there&rsquo;s so many different venues</p>
<p>through which we can teach people math.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the traditional one, right?</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m in a classroom with, depending on the class,</p>
<p>it could be 30 people, it could be a hundred people,</p>
<p>it could, God help me, be a 500 people</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s like the big calculus lecture or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s sort of some,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some set of people of that order of magnitude</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m with them, we have a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with them for a whole semester</p>
<p>and I can ask them to do homework and we talk together.</p>
<p>We have office hours, if they have one on one questions,</p>
<p>a lot of, it&rsquo;s like a very high level of engagement,</p>
<p>but how many people am I actually hitting at a time?</p>
<p>Like not that many, right?</p>
<p>And you can, and there&rsquo;s kind of an inverse relationship</p>
<p>where the more, the fewer people you&rsquo;re talking to,</p>
<p>the more engagement you can ask for.</p>
<p>The ultimate of course is like the mentorship relation</p>
<p>of like a PhD advisor and a graduate student</p>
<p>where you spend a lot of one on one time together</p>
<p>for like three to five years.</p>
<p>And the ultimate high level of engagement to one person.</p>
<p>Books, this can get to a lot more people</p>
<p>that are ever gonna sit in my classroom</p>
<p>and you spend like however many hours it takes</p>
<p>to read a book.</p>
<p>Somebody like Three Blue One Brown or Numberphile</p>
<p>or people like Vi Hart.</p>
<p>I mean, YouTube, let&rsquo;s face it, has bigger reach than a book.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s YouTube videos that have many, many,</p>
<p>many more views than like any hardback book</p>
<p>like not written by a Kardashian or an Obama</p>
<p>is gonna sell, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>and then those are, some of them are like longer,</p>
<p>20 minutes long, some of them are five minutes long,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re shorter.</p>
<p>And then even some of you look like Eugenia Chang</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a wonderful category theorist in Chicago.</p>
<p>I mean, she was on, I think the Daily Show or is it,</p>
<p>I mean, she was on, she has 30 seconds,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s like 30 seconds</p>
<p>to sort of say something about mathematics</p>
<p>to like untold millions of people.</p>
<p>So everywhere along this curve is important.</p>
<p>And one thing I feel like is great right now</p>
<p>is that people are just broadcasting on all the channels</p>
<p>because we each have our skills, right?</p>
<p>Somehow along the way, like I learned how to write books.</p>
<p>I had this kind of weird life as a writer</p>
<p>where I sort of spent a lot of time</p>
<p>like thinking about how to put English words together</p>
<p>into sentences and sentences together into paragraphs,</p>
<p>like at length,</p>
<p>which is this kind of like weird specialized skill.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one thing, but like sort of being able to make</p>
<p>like winning, good looking, eye catching videos</p>
<p>is like a totally different skill.</p>
<p>And probably somewhere out there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably sort of some like heavy metal band</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like teaching math through heavy metal</p>
<p>and like using their skills to do that.</p>
<p>I hope there is at any rate.</p>
<p>Their music and so on, yeah.</p>
<p>But there is something to the process.</p>
<p>I mean, Grant does this especially well,</p>
<p>which is in order to be able to visualize something,</p>
<p>now he writes programs, so it&rsquo;s programmatic visualization.</p>
<p>So like the things he is basically mostly</p>
<p>through his Manum library and Python,</p>
<p>everything is drawn through Python.</p>
<p>You have to truly understand the topic</p>
<p>to be able to visualize it in that way</p>
<p>and not just understand it,</p>
<p>but really kind of think in a very novel way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because I&rsquo;ve spoken with him a couple of times,</p>
<p>spoken to him a lot offline as well.</p>
<p>He really doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s doing anything new,</p>
<p>meaning like he sees himself as very different</p>
<p>from maybe like a researcher,</p>
<p>but it feels to me like he&rsquo;s creating something totally new.</p>
<p>Like that act of understanding and visualizing</p>
<p>is as powerful or has the same kind of inkling of power</p>
<p>as does the process of proving something.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have that clear destination,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pulling out an insight</p>
<p>and creating multiple sets of perspective</p>
<p>that arrive at that insight.</p>
<p>And to be honest, it&rsquo;s something that I think</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t quite figured out how to value</p>
<p>inside academic mathematics in the same way,</p>
<p>and this is a bit older,</p>
<p>that I think we haven&rsquo;t quite figured out</p>
<p>how to value the development</p>
<p>of computational infrastructure.</p>
<p>We all have computers as our partners now</p>
<p>and people build computers that sort of assist</p>
<p>and participate in our mathematics.</p>
<p>They build those systems</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a kind of mathematics too,</p>
<p>but not in the traditional form</p>
<p>of proving theorems and writing papers.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, I think, for example,</p>
<p>the Institute for Computational Experimental Mathematics</p>
<p>at Brown, which is like, it&rsquo;s a NSF funded math institute,</p>
<p>very much part of sort of traditional math academia.</p>
<p>They did an entire theme semester</p>
<p>about visualizing mathematics,</p>
<p>looking at the same kind of thing that they would do</p>
<p>for like an up and coming research topic.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>So I think there really is buy in</p>
<p>from the mathematics community</p>
<p>to recognize that this kind of stuff is important</p>
<p>and counts as part of mathematics,</p>
<p>like part of what we&rsquo;re actually here to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m hoping to see more and more of that</p>
<p>from like MIT faculty, from faculty,</p>
<p>from all the top universities in the world.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this weird question about the Fields Medal,</p>
<p>which is the Nobel Prize in Mathematics.</p>
<p>Do you think, since we&rsquo;re talking about computers,</p>
<p>there will one day come a time when a computer,</p>
<p>an AI system will win a Fields Medal?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s what a human would say.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Is that like, that&rsquo;s like my captcha?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the proof that I&rsquo;m a human?</p>
<p>Is that like the lie that I know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is, how does he want me to answer?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to be said about that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I am tremendously interested</p>
<p>in what AI can do in pure mathematics.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, of course, it&rsquo;s a parochial interest, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, why am I interested in like,</p>
<p>how it can like help feed the world</p>
<p>or help solve like real social problems?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, can it do more math?</p>
<p>Like, what can I do?</p>
<p>We all have our interests, right?</p>
<p>But I think it is a really interesting conceptual question.</p>
<p>And here too, I think it&rsquo;s important to be kind of historical</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s certainly true that there&rsquo;s lots of things</p>
<p>that we used to call research in mathematics</p>
<p>that we would now call computation.</p>
<p>Tasks that we&rsquo;ve now offloaded to machines.</p>
<p>Like, you know, in 1890, somebody could be like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my PhD thesis.</p>
<p>I computed all the invariants of this polynomial ring</p>
<p>under the action of some finite group.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what those words mean,</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s like some thing that in 1890</p>
<p>would take a person a year to do</p>
<p>and would be a valuable thing that you might wanna know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still a valuable thing that you might wanna know,</p>
<p>but now you type a few lines of code</p>
<p>in Macaulay or Sage or Magma and you just have it.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t think of that as math anymore,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Macaulay, Sage and Magma?</p>
<p>Oh, those are computer algebra programs.</p>
<p>So those are like sort of bespoke systems</p>
<p>that lots of mathematicians use.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s similar to Maple and&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, oh yeah, so it&rsquo;s similar to Maple and Mathematica,</p>
<p>yeah, but a little more specialized, but yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s programs that work with symbols</p>
<p>and allow you to do, can you do proofs?</p>
<p>Can you do kind of little leaps and proofs?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really built for that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a whole other story.</p>
<p>But these tools are part of the process of mathematics now.</p>
<p>Right, they are now for most mathematicians, I would say,</p>
<p>part of the process of mathematics.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there&rsquo;s a story I tell in the book,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m fascinated by, which is, you know,</p>
<p>so far, attempts to get AIs</p>
<p>to prove interesting theorems have not done so well.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they can.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a paper I just saw,</p>
<p>which has a very nice use of a neural net</p>
<p>to find counter examples to conjecture.</p>
<p>Somebody said like, well, maybe this is always that.</p>
<p>And you can be like, well, let me sort of train an AI</p>
<p>to sort of try to find things where that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>And it actually succeeded.</p>
<p>Now, in this case, if you look at the things that it found,</p>
<p>you say like, okay, I mean, these are not famous conjectures.</p>
<p>Okay, so like somebody wrote this down, maybe this is so.</p>
<p>Looking at what the AI came up with, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you know, I bet if like five grad students</p>
<p>had thought about that problem,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t have come up with that.</p>
<p>I mean, when you see it, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>okay, that is one of the things you might try</p>
<p>if you sort of like put some work into it.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s pretty awesome.</p>
<p>But the story I tell in the book, which I&rsquo;m fascinated by</p>
<p>is there is, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna go back to knots.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a knot called the Conway knot.</p>
<p>After John Conway, maybe we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>a very interesting character also.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a small tangent.</p>
<p>Somebody I was supposed to talk to</p>
<p>and unfortunately he passed away</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s somebody I find as an incredible mathematician,</p>
<p>incredible human being.</p>
<p>Oh, and I am sorry that you didn&rsquo;t get a chance</p>
<p>because having had the chance to talk to him a lot</p>
<p>when I was a postdoc, yeah, you missed out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to sugarcoat it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that you didn&rsquo;t get that chance.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is what it is.</p>
<p>So knots.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there was a question and again,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter the technicalities of the question,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a question of whether the knot is slice.</p>
<p>It has to do with something about what kinds</p>
<p>of three dimensional surfaces and four dimensions</p>
<p>can be bounded by this knot.</p>
<p>But nevermind what it means, it&rsquo;s some question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually very hard to compute</p>
<p>whether a knot is slice or not.</p>
<p>And in particular, the question of the Conway knot,</p>
<p>whether it was slice or not, was particularly vexed</p>
<p>until it was solved just a few years ago</p>
<p>by Lisa Piccarillo, who actually,</p>
<p>now that I think of it, was here in Austin.</p>
<p>I believe she was a grad student at UT Austin at the time.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even realize there was an Austin connection</p>
<p>to this story until I started telling it.</p>
<p>In fact, I think she&rsquo;s now at MIT,</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s basically following you around.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly.</p>
<p>The reverse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of really interesting richness to this story.</p>
<p>One thing about it is her paper was rather,</p>
<p>was very short, it was very short and simple.</p>
<p>Nine pages of which two were pictures.</p>
<p>Very short for like a paper solving a major conjecture.</p>
<p>And it really makes you think about what we mean</p>
<p>by difficulty in mathematics.</p>
<p>Like, do you say, oh, actually the problem wasn&rsquo;t difficult</p>
<p>because you could solve it so simply?</p>
<p>Or do you say like, well, no, evidently it was difficult</p>
<p>because like the world&rsquo;s top topologists,</p>
<p>many, you know, worked on it for 20 years</p>
<p>and nobody could solve it, so therefore it is difficult.</p>
<p>Or is it that we need sort of some new category</p>
<p>of things that about which it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>to figure out that they&rsquo;re not difficult?</p>
<p>I mean, this is the computer science formulation,</p>
<p>but the sort of the journey to arrive</p>
<p>at the simple answer may be difficult,</p>
<p>but once you have the answer, it will then appear simple.</p>
<p>And I mean, there might be a large category.</p>
<p>I hope there&rsquo;s a large set of such solutions,</p>
<p>because, you know, once we stand</p>
<p>at the end of the scientific process</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re at the very beginning of,</p>
<p>or at least it feels like,</p>
<p>I hope there&rsquo;s just simple answers to everything</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll look and it&rsquo;ll be simple laws</p>
<p>that govern the universe,</p>
<p>simple explanation of what is consciousness,</p>
<p>what is love, is mortality fundamental to life,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the meaning of life, are humans special</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re just another sort of reflection</p>
<p>of all that is beautiful in the universe</p>
<p>in terms of like life forms, all of it is life</p>
<p>and just has different,</p>
<p>when taken from a different perspective</p>
<p>is all life can seem more valuable or not,</p>
<p>but really it&rsquo;s all part of the same thing.</p>
<p>All those will have a nice, like two equations,</p>
<p>maybe one equation, but.</p>
<p>Why do you think you want those questions</p>
<p>to have simple answers?</p>
<p>I think just like symmetry</p>
<p>and the breaking of symmetry is beautiful somehow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something beautiful about simplicity.</p>
<p>I think it, what is that?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s aesthetic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s aesthetic, yeah.</p>
<p>Or, but it&rsquo;s aesthetic in the way</p>
<p>that happiness is an aesthetic.</p>
<p>Like, why is that so joyful</p>
<p>that a simple explanation that governs</p>
<p>a large number of cases is really appealing?</p>
<p>Even when it&rsquo;s not, like obviously we get</p>
<p>a huge amount of trouble with that</p>
<p>because oftentimes it doesn&rsquo;t have to be connected</p>
<p>with reality or even that explanation</p>
<p>could be exceptionally harmful.</p>
<p>Most of like the world&rsquo;s history that has,</p>
<p>that was governed by hate and violence</p>
<p>had a very simple explanation at the core</p>
<p>that was used to cause the violence and the hatred.</p>
<p>So like we get into trouble with that,</p>
<p>but why is that so appealing?</p>
<p>And in this nice forms in mathematics,</p>
<p>like you look at the Einstein papers,</p>
<p>why are those so beautiful?</p>
<p>And why is the Andrew Wiles proof</p>
<p>of the Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem not quite so beautiful?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s beautiful about that story</p>
<p>is the human struggle of like the human story</p>
<p>of perseverance, of the drama,</p>
<p>of not knowing if the proof is correct</p>
<p>and ups and downs and all of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the interesting part.</p>
<p>But the fact that the proof is huge</p>
<p>and nobody understands, well,</p>
<p>from my outsider&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>nobody understands what the heck it is,</p>
<p>is not as beautiful as it could have been.</p>
<p>I wish it was what Fermat originally said,</p>
<p>which is, you know, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not small enough to fit in the margins of this page,</p>
<p>but maybe if he had like a full page</p>
<p>or maybe a couple of post it notes,</p>
<p>he would have enough to do the proof.</p>
<p>What do you make of,</p>
<p>if we could take another of a multitude of tangents,</p>
<p>what do you make of Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem?</p>
<p>Because the statement, there&rsquo;s a few theorems,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few problems that are deemed by the world</p>
<p>throughout its history to be exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p>And that one in particular is really simple to formulate</p>
<p>and really hard to come up with a proof for.</p>
<p>And it was like taunted as simple by Fermat himself.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to be said about</p>
<p>that X to the N plus Y to the N equals Z to the N</p>
<p>for N of three or greater, is there a solution to this?</p>
<p>And then how do you go about proving that?</p>
<p>Like, how would you try to prove that?</p>
<p>And what do you learn from the proof</p>
<p>that eventually emerged by Andrew Wiles?</p>
<p>Yeah, so right, so to give,</p>
<p>let me just say the background,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know if everybody listening knows the story.</p>
<p>So, you know, Fermat was an early number theorist,</p>
<p>at least sort of an early mathematician,</p>
<p>those special adjacent didn&rsquo;t really exist back then.</p>
<p>He comes up in the book actually,</p>
<p>in the context of a different theorem of his</p>
<p>that has to do with testing,</p>
<p>whether a number is prime or not.</p>
<p>So I write about, he was one of the ones who was salty</p>
<p>and like, he would exchange these letters</p>
<p>where he and his correspondents would like</p>
<p>try to top each other and vex each other with questions</p>
<p>and stuff like this.</p>
<p>But this particular thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem because it&rsquo;s a note</p>
<p>he wrote in his copy of the Disquisitiones Arithmetic I.</p>
<p>Like he wrote, here&rsquo;s an equation, it has no solutions.</p>
<p>I can prove it, but the proof&rsquo;s like a little too long</p>
<p>to fit in the margin of this book.</p>
<p>He was just like writing a note to himself.</p>
<p>Now, let me just say historically,</p>
<p>we know that Fermat did not have a proof of this theorem.</p>
<p>For a long time, people were like this mysterious proof</p>
<p>that was lost, a very romantic story, right?</p>
<p>But a fair amount later,</p>
<p>he did prove special cases of this theorem</p>
<p>and wrote about it, talked to people about the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear from the way that he wrote</p>
<p>where he can solve certain examples</p>
<p>of this type of equation</p>
<p>that he did not know how to do the whole thing.</p>
<p>He may have had a deep, simple intuition</p>
<p>about how to solve the whole thing</p>
<p>that he had at that moment</p>
<p>without ever being able to come up with a complete proof.</p>
<p>And that intuition maybe lost the time.</p>
<p>Maybe, but you&rsquo;re right, that is unknowable.</p>
<p>But I think what we can know is that later,</p>
<p>he certainly did not think that he had a proof</p>
<p>that he was concealing from people.</p>
<p>He thought he didn&rsquo;t know how to prove it,</p>
<p>and I also think he didn&rsquo;t know how to prove it.</p>
<p>Now, I understand the appeal of saying like,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if this very simple equation</p>
<p>there was like a very simple, clever, wonderful proof</p>
<p>that you could do in a page or two.</p>
<p>And that would be great, but you know what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of equations like that</p>
<p>that are solved by very clever methods like that,</p>
<p>including the special cases that Fermat wrote about,</p>
<p>the method of descent,</p>
<p>which is like very wonderful and important.</p>
<p>But in the end, those are nice things</p>
<p>that like you teach in an undergraduate class,</p>
<p>and it is what it is,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not big.</p>
<p>On the other hand, work on the Fermat problem,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we like to call it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not really his theorem</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t think he proved it.</p>
<p>So, I mean, work on the Fermat problem</p>
<p>developed this like incredible richness of number theory</p>
<p>that we now live in today.</p>
<p>Like, and not, by the way,</p>
<p>just Wiles, Andrew Wiles being the person</p>
<p>who, together with Richard Taylor,</p>
<p>finally proved this theorem.</p>
<p>But you know how you have this whole moment</p>
<p>that people try to prove this theorem</p>
<p>and they fail,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a famous false proof by LeMay</p>
<p>from the 19th century,</p>
<p>where Kummer, in understanding what mistake LeMay had made</p>
<p>in this incorrect proof,</p>
<p>basically understands something incredible,</p>
<p>which is that a thing we know about numbers</p>
<p>is that you can factor them</p>
<p>and you can factor them uniquely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one way to break a number up into primes.</p>
<p>Like if we think of a number like 12,</p>
<p>12 is two times three times two.</p>
<p>I had to think about it.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s two times two times three,</p>
<p>of course you can reorder them.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no other way to do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no universe in which 12 is something times five,</p>
<p>or in which there&rsquo;s like four threes in it.</p>
<p>Nope, 12 is like two twos and a three.</p>
<p>Like that is what it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s such a fundamental feature of arithmetic</p>
<p>that we almost think of it like God&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It has to be that way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really powerful idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool that every number</p>
<p>is uniquely made up of other numbers.</p>
<p>And like made up meaning like there&rsquo;s these like basic atoms</p>
<p>that form molecules that get built on top of each other.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I mean, when I teach undergraduate number theory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the first really deep theorem</p>
<p>that you prove.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s amazing is the fact</p>
<p>that you can factor a number into primes is much easier.</p>
<p>Essentially Euclid knew it,</p>
<p>although he didn&rsquo;t quite put it in that way.</p>
<p>The fact that you can do it at all.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s deep is the fact that there&rsquo;s only one way to do it</p>
<p>or however you sort of chop the number up,</p>
<p>you end up with the same set of prime factors.</p>
<p>And indeed what people finally understood</p>
<p>at the end of the 19th century is that</p>
<p>if you work in number systems slightly more general</p>
<p>than the ones we&rsquo;re used to,</p>
<p>which it turns out are relevant to Fermat,</p>
<p>all of a sudden this stops being true.</p>
<p>Things get, I mean, things get more complicated</p>
<p>and now because you were praising simplicity before</p>
<p>you were like, it&rsquo;s so beautiful, unique factorization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so great.</p>
<p>Like, so when I tell you</p>
<p>that in more general number systems,</p>
<p>there is no unique factorization.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like a whole new world of phenomena</p>
<p>to study that you just can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>through the lens of the numbers that we&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m for complication.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m highly in favor of complication</p>
<p>because every complication is like an opportunity</p>
<p>for new things to study.</p>
<p>And is that the big kind of one of the big insights</p>
<p>for you from Andrew Wiles&rsquo;s proof?</p>
<p>Is there interesting insights about the process</p>
<p>that you used to prove that sort of resonates</p>
<p>with you as a mathematician?</p>
<p>Is there an interesting concept that emerged from it?</p>
<p>Is there interesting human aspects to the proof?</p>
<p>Whether there&rsquo;s interesting human aspects</p>
<p>to the proof itself is an interesting question.</p>
<p>Certainly it has a huge amount of richness.</p>
<p>Sort of at its heart is an argument</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called deformation theory,</p>
<p>which was in part created by my PhD advisor, Barry Mazer.</p>
<p>Can you speak to what deformation theory is?</p>
<p>I can speak to what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>How about that?</p>
<p>What does it rhyme with?</p>
<p>Right, well, the reason that Barry called it</p>
<p>deformation theory, I think he&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>who gave it the name.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m not wrong in saying it&rsquo;s a name.</p>
<p>In your book, you have calling different things</p>
<p>by the same name as one of the things</p>
<p>in the beautiful map that opens the book.</p>
<p>Yes, and this is a perfect example.</p>
<p>So this is another phrase of Poincare,</p>
<p>this like incredible generator of slogans and aphorisms.</p>
<p>He said, mathematics is the art</p>
<p>of calling different things by the same name.</p>
<p>That very thing we do, right?</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re like this triangle and this triangle,</p>
<p>come on, they&rsquo;re the same triangle,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just in a different place, right?</p>
<p>So in the same way, it came to be understood</p>
<p>that the kinds of objects that you study</p>
<p>when you study Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s not even be too careful</p>
<p>about what these objects are.</p>
<p>I can tell you there are gaol representations</p>
<p>in modular forms, but saying those words</p>
<p>is not gonna mean so much.</p>
<p>But whatever they are, they&rsquo;re things that can be deformed,</p>
<p>moved around a little bit.</p>
<p>And I think the insight of what Andrew</p>
<p>and then Andrew and Richard were able to do</p>
<p>was to say something like this.</p>
<p>A deformation means moving something just a tiny bit,</p>
<p>like an infinitesimal amount.</p>
<p>If you really are good at understanding</p>
<p>which ways a thing can move in a tiny, tiny, tiny,</p>
<p>infinitesimal amount in certain directions,</p>
<p>maybe you can piece that information together</p>
<p>to understand the whole global space in which it can move.</p>
<p>And essentially, their argument comes down</p>
<p>to showing that two of those big global spaces</p>
<p>are actually the same, the fabled R equals T,</p>
<p>part of their proof, which is at the heart of it.</p>
<p>And it involves this very careful principle like that.</p>
<p>But that being said, what I just said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not what you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;re thinking when you think,</p>
<p>oh, I have a point in space and I move it around</p>
<p>like a little tiny bit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using your notion of distance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s from calculus.</p>
<p>We know what it means for like two points</p>
<p>on the real line to be close together.</p>
<p>So yet another thing that comes up in the book a lot</p>
<p>is this fact that the notion of distance</p>
<p>is not given to us by God.</p>
<p>We could mean a lot of different things by distance.</p>
<p>And just in the English language, we do that all the time.</p>
<p>We talk about somebody being a close relative.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they live next door to you, right?</p>
<p>It means something else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different notion of distance we have in mind.</p>
<p>And there are lots of notions of distances</p>
<p>that you could use.</p>
<p>In the natural language processing community and AI,</p>
<p>there might be some notion of semantic distance</p>
<p>or lexical distance between two words.</p>
<p>How much do they tend to arise in the same context?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredibly important for doing autocomplete</p>
<p>and like machine translation and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with</p>
<p>are they next to each other in the dictionary, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different kind of distance.</p>
<p>Okay, ready?</p>
<p>In this kind of number theory,</p>
<p>there was a crazy distance called the peatic distance.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t write about this that much in the book</p>
<p>because even though I love it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a big part of my research life,</p>
<p>it gets a little bit into the weeds,</p>
<p>but your listeners are gonna hear about it now.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>What a normal person says</p>
<p>when they say two numbers are close,</p>
<p>they say like their difference is like a small number,</p>
<p>like seven and eight are close</p>
<p>because their difference is one and one&rsquo;s pretty small.</p>
<p>If we were to be what&rsquo;s called a two attic number theorist,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d say, oh, two numbers are close</p>
<p>if their difference is a multiple of a large power of two.</p>
<p>So like one and 49 are close</p>
<p>because their difference is 48</p>
<p>and 48 is a multiple of 16,</p>
<p>which is a pretty large power of two.</p>
<p>Whereas one and two are pretty far away</p>
<p>because the difference between them is one,</p>
<p>which is not even a multiple of a power of two at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s odd.</p>
<p>You wanna know what&rsquo;s really far from one?</p>
<p>Like one and 1 64th</p>
<p>because their difference is a negative power of two,</p>
<p>two to the minus six.</p>
<p>So those points are quite, quite far away.</p>
<p>Two to the power of a large N would be two,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the difference between two numbers</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re close.</p>
<p>Yeah, so two to a large power is in this metric</p>
<p>a very small number</p>
<p>and two to a negative power is a very big number.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s two attic.</p>
<p>Okay, I can&rsquo;t even visualize that.</p>
<p>It takes practice.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever heard of the Cantor set,</p>
<p>it looks kind of like that.</p>
<p>So it is crazy that this is good for anything, right?</p>
<p>I mean, this just sounds like a definition</p>
<p>that someone would make up to torment you.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s amazing is there&rsquo;s a general theory of distance</p>
<p>where you say any definition you make</p>
<p>to satisfy certain axioms deserves to be called a distance</p>
<p>and this.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>My brain, you broke my brain.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>10 seconds ago.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m also starting to map for the two attic case</p>
<p>to binary numbers.</p>
<p>And you know, cause we romanticize those.</p>
<p>So I was trying to.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s exactly the right way to think of it.</p>
<p>I was trying to mess with number,</p>
<p>I was trying to see, okay, which ones are close.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m starting to visualize</p>
<p>different binary numbers and how they,</p>
<p>which ones are close to each other.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s very similar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly the right way to think of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like binary numbers written in reverse.</p>
<p>Because in a binary expansion, two numbers are close.</p>
<p>A number that&rsquo;s small is like 0.0000 something.</p>
<p>Something that&rsquo;s the decimal</p>
<p>and it starts with a lot of zeros.</p>
<p>In the two attic metric, a binary number is very small</p>
<p>if it ends with a lot of zeros and then the decimal point.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>So it is kind of like binary numbers written backwards</p>
<p>is actually, I should have said,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I should have said, Lex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good metaphor.</p>
<p>Okay, but so why is that interesting</p>
<p>except for the fact that it&rsquo;s a beautiful kind of framework,</p>
<p>different kind of framework</p>
<p>of which to think about distances.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking about not just the two attic,</p>
<p>but the generalization of that.</p>
<p>Why is that interesting?</p>
<p>Yeah, the NEP.</p>
<p>And so that, because that&rsquo;s the kind of deformation</p>
<p>that comes up in Wiles&rsquo;s proof,</p>
<p>that deformation where moving something a little bit</p>
<p>means a little bit in this two attic sense.</p>
<p>Trippy, okay.</p>
<p>No, I mean, it&rsquo;s such a,</p>
<p>I mean, I just get excited talking about it</p>
<p>and I just taught this like in the fall semester that.</p>
<p>But it like reformulating, why is,</p>
<p>so you pick a different measure of distance</p>
<p>over which you can talk about very tiny changes</p>
<p>and then use that to then prove things</p>
<p>about the entire thing.</p>
<p>Yes, although, honestly, what I would say,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true that we use it to prove things,</p>
<p>but I would say we use it to understand things.</p>
<p>And then because we understand things better,</p>
<p>then we can prove things.</p>
<p>But the goal is always the understanding.</p>
<p>The goal is not so much to prove things.</p>
<p>The goal is not to know what&rsquo;s true or false.</p>
<p>I mean, this is something I write about</p>
<p>in the book, Near the End.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a wonderful, wonderful essay by Bill Thurston,</p>
<p>kind of one of the great geometers of our time,</p>
<p>who unfortunately passed away a few years ago,</p>
<p>called on proof and progress in mathematics.</p>
<p>And he writes very wonderfully about how,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s not a theorem factory</p>
<p>where you have a production quota.</p>
<p>I mean, the point of mathematics</p>
<p>is to help humans understand things.</p>
<p>And the way we test that</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re proving new theorems along the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the benchmark, but that&rsquo;s not the goal.</p>
<p>Yeah, but just as a kind of, absolutely,</p>
<p>but as a tool, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>to approach a problem by saying,</p>
<p>how can I change the distance function?</p>
<p>Like what, the nature of distance,</p>
<p>because that might start to lead to insights</p>
<p>for deeper understanding.</p>
<p>Like if I were to try to describe human society</p>
<p>by a distance, two people are close</p>
<p>if they love each other.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then start to do a full analysis</p>
<p>on the everybody that lives on earth currently,</p>
<p>the 7 billion people.</p>
<p>And from that perspective,</p>
<p>as opposed to the geographic perspective of distance.</p>
<p>And then maybe there could be a bunch of insights</p>
<p>about the source of violence,</p>
<p>the source of maybe entrepreneurial success</p>
<p>or invention or economic success or different systems,</p>
<p>communism, capitalism start to,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, I guess what economics tries to do,</p>
<p>but really saying, okay, let&rsquo;s think outside the box</p>
<p>about totally new distance functions</p>
<p>that could unlock something profound about the space.</p>
<p>Yeah, because think about it.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s, I mean, now we&rsquo;re gonna talk about AI,</p>
<p>which you know a lot more about than I do.</p>
<p>So just start laughing uproariously</p>
<p>if I say something that&rsquo;s completely wrong.</p>
<p>We both know very little relative</p>
<p>to what we will know centuries from now.</p>
<p>That is a really good humble way to think about it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s just go for it.</p>
<p>Okay, so I think you&rsquo;ll agree with this,</p>
<p>that in some sense, what&rsquo;s good about AI</p>
<p>is that we can&rsquo;t test any case in advance,</p>
<p>the whole point of AI is to make,</p>
<p>or one point of it, I guess, is to make good predictions</p>
<p>about cases we haven&rsquo;t yet seen.</p>
<p>And in some sense, that&rsquo;s always gonna involve</p>
<p>some notion of distance,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s always gonna involve</p>
<p>somehow taking a case we haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>and saying what cases that we have seen is it close to,</p>
<p>is it like, is it somehow an interpolation between.</p>
<p>Now, when we do that,</p>
<p>in order to talk about things being like other things,</p>
<p>implicitly or explicitly,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re invoking some notion of distance,</p>
<p>and boy, we better get it right.</p>
<p>If you try to do natural language processing</p>
<p>and your idea of distance between words</p>
<p>is how close they are in the dictionary,</p>
<p>when you write them in alphabetical order,</p>
<p>you are gonna get pretty bad translations, right?</p>
<p>No, the notion of distance has to come from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s essentially what neural networks are doing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what word embeddings are doing is coming up with.</p>
<p>In the case of word embeddings, literally,</p>
<p>literally what they are doing is learning a distance.</p>
<p>But those are super complicated distance functions,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost nice to think</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a nice transformation that&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>Sorry, there&rsquo;s a nice formulation of the distance.</p>
<p>Again with the simple.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t, let me ask you about this.</p>
<p>From an understanding perspective,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the Richard Feynman, maybe attributed to him,</p>
<p>but maybe many others,</p>
<p>is this idea that if you can&rsquo;t explain something simply</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>In how many cases, how often is that true?</p>
<p>Do you find there&rsquo;s some profound truth in that?</p>
<p>Oh, okay, so you were about to ask, is it true?</p>
<p>To which I would say flatly, no.</p>
<p>But then you said, you followed that up with,</p>
<p>is there some profound truth in it?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, sure.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some truth in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true. But it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a mathematician answer.</p>
<p>The truth that is in it is that learning</p>
<p>to explain something helps you understand it.</p>
<p>But real things are not simple.</p>
<p>A few things are, most are not.</p>
<p>And to be honest, we don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>whether Feynman really said that right</p>
<p>or something like that is sort of disputed.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think Feynman could have literally believed that</p>
<p>whether or not he said it.</p>
<p>And he was the kind of guy, I didn&rsquo;t know him,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been reading his writing,</p>
<p>he liked to sort of say stuff, like stuff that sounded good.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s totally strikes me as the kind of thing</p>
<p>he could have said because he liked the way saying it</p>
<p>made him feel, but also knowing</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t like literally mean it.</p>
<p>Well, I definitely have a lot of friends</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of physicists</p>
<p>and they do derive joy from believing</p>
<p>that they can explain stuff simply</p>
<p>or believing it&rsquo;s possible to explain stuff simply,</p>
<p>even when the explanation is not actually that simple.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve heard people think that the explanation is simple</p>
<p>and they do the explanation.</p>
<p>And I think it is simple,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not capturing the phenomena that we&rsquo;re discussing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s capturing, it&rsquo;s somehow maps in their mind,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s taking as a starting point,</p>
<p>as an assumption that there&rsquo;s a deep knowledge</p>
<p>and a deep understanding that&rsquo;s actually very complicated.</p>
<p>And the simplicity is almost like a poem</p>
<p>about the more complicated thing</p>
<p>as opposed to a distillation.</p>
<p>And I love poems, but a poem is not an explanation.</p>
<p>Well, some people might disagree with that,</p>
<p>but certainly from a mathematical perspective.</p>
<p>No poet would disagree with it.</p>
<p>No poet would disagree.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s some things</p>
<p>that can only be described imprecisely?</p>
<p>As an explanation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any poet would say their poem</p>
<p>is an explanation.</p>
<p>They might say it&rsquo;s a description.</p>
<p>They might say it&rsquo;s sort of capturing sort of.</p>
<p>Well, some people might say the only truth is like music.</p>
<p>Not the only truth,</p>
<p>but some truths can only be expressed through art.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s the whole thing</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about religion and myth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some things</p>
<p>that are limited cognitive capabilities</p>
<p>and the tools of mathematics or the tools of physics</p>
<p>are just not going to allow us to capture.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s possible consciousness is one of those things.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Yes, that is definitely possible.</p>
<p>But I would even say,</p>
<p>look, I mean, consciousness is a thing about</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re still in the dark</p>
<p>as to whether there&rsquo;s an explanation</p>
<p>we would understand it as an explanation at all.</p>
<p>By the way, okay.</p>
<p>I got to give yet one more amazing Poincare quote</p>
<p>because this guy just never stopped coming up</p>
<p>with great quotes that,</p>
<p>Paul Erd≈ës, another fellow who appears in the book.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>he thinks about this notion of distance</p>
<p>of like personal affinity,</p>
<p>kind of like what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>the kind of social network and that notion of distance</p>
<p>that comes from that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that Paul Erd≈ës.</p>
<p>Erd≈ës did?</p>
<p>Well, he thought about distances and networks.</p>
<p>I guess he didn&rsquo;t probably,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t think about the social network.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how it started that story of Erd≈ës number.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to distract.</p>
<p>But you know, Erd≈ës was sort of famous for saying,</p>
<p>and this is sort of long lines we&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>he talked about the book,</p>
<p>capital T, capital B, the book.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the book where God keeps the right proof</p>
<p>of every theorem.</p>
<p>So when he saw a proof he really liked,</p>
<p>it was like really elegant, really simple.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s from the book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like you found one of the ones that&rsquo;s in the book.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t a religious guy, by the way.</p>
<p>He referred to God as the supreme fascist.</p>
<p>He was like, but somehow he was like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really believe in God,</p>
<p>but I believe in God&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>I mean, it was,</p>
<p>but Poincare on the other hand,</p>
<p>and by the way, there were other managers.</p>
<p>Hilda Hudson is one who comes up in this book.</p>
<p>She also kind of saw math.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s one of the people who sort of develops</p>
<p>the disease model that we now use,</p>
<p>that we use to sort of track pandemics,</p>
<p>this SIR model that sort of originally comes</p>
<p>from her work with Ronald Ross.</p>
<p>But she was also super, super, super devout.</p>
<p>And she also sort of on the other side</p>
<p>of the religious coin was like,</p>
<p>yeah, math is how we communicate with God.</p>
<p>She has a great,</p>
<p>all these people are incredibly quotable.</p>
<p>She says, you know, math is,</p>
<p>the truth, the things about mathematics,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re not the most important of God thoughts,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re the only ones that we can know precisely.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s like, this is the one place</p>
<p>where we get to sort of see what God&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>when we do mathematics.</p>
<p>Again, not a fan of poetry or music.</p>
<p>Some people will say Hendrix is like,</p>
<p>some people say chapter one of that book is mathematics,</p>
<p>and then chapter two is like classic rock.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s not clear that the&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, you just sent me off on a tangent,</p>
<p>just imagining like Erdos at a Hendrix concert,</p>
<p>like trying to figure out if it was from the book or not.</p>
<p>What I was coming to was just to say,</p>
<p>but what Poincar√© said about this is he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, if like, this is all worked out</p>
<p>in the language of the divine,</p>
<p>and if a divine being like came down and told it to us,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to understand it, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So Poincar√© was of the view that there were things</p>
<p>that were sort of like inhumanly complex,</p>
<p>and that was how they really were.</p>
<p>Our job is to figure out the things that are not like that.</p>
<p>That are not like that.</p>
<p>All this talk of primes got me hungry for primes.</p>
<p>You wrote a blog post, The Beauty of Bounding Gaps,</p>
<p>a huge discovery about prime numbers</p>
<p>and what it means for the future of math.</p>
<p>Can you tell me about prime numbers?</p>
<p>What the heck are those?</p>
<p>What are twin primes?</p>
<p>What are prime gaps?</p>
<p>What are bounding gaps and primes?</p>
<p>What are all these things?</p>
<p>And what, if anything,</p>
<p>or what exactly is beautiful about them?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, you know, prime numbers are one of the things</p>
<p>that number theorists study the most and have for millennia.</p>
<p>They are numbers which can&rsquo;t be factored.</p>
<p>And then you say, like, five.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, wait, I can factor five.</p>
<p>Five is five times one.</p>
<p>Okay, not like that.</p>
<p>That is a factorization.</p>
<p>It absolutely is a way of expressing five</p>
<p>as a product of two things.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you agree there&rsquo;s like something trivial about it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something you could do to any number.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have content the way that if I say</p>
<p>that 12 is six times two or 35 is seven times five,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really done something to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve broken up.</p>
<p>So those are the kind of factorizations that count.</p>
<p>And a number that doesn&rsquo;t have a factorization like that</p>
<p>is called prime, except, historical side note,</p>
<p>one, which at some times in mathematical history</p>
<p>has been deemed to be a prime, but currently is not.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s for the best.</p>
<p>But I bring it up only because sometimes people think that,</p>
<p>you know, these definitions are kind of,</p>
<p>if we think about them hard enough,</p>
<p>we can figure out which definition is true.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just an artifact of mathematics.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a question of which definition is best for us,</p>
<p>for our purposes.</p>
<p>Well, those edge cases are weird, right?</p>
<p>So it can&rsquo;t be, it doesn&rsquo;t count when you use yourself</p>
<p>as a number or one as part of the factorization</p>
<p>or as the entirety of the factorization.</p>
<p>So you somehow get to the meat of the number</p>
<p>by factorizing it.</p>
<p>And that seems to get to the core of all of mathematics.</p>
<p>Yeah, you take any number and you factorize it</p>
<p>until you can factorize no more.</p>
<p>And what you have left is some big pile of primes.</p>
<p>I mean, by definition, when you can&rsquo;t factor anymore,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re done, when you can&rsquo;t break the numbers up</p>
<p>anymore, what&rsquo;s left must be prime.</p>
<p>You know, 12 breaks into two and two and three.</p>
<p>So these numbers are the atoms, the building blocks</p>
<p>of all numbers.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot we know about them,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s much more that we don&rsquo;t know about them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you the first few.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two, three, five, seven, 11.</p>
<p>By the way, they&rsquo;re all gonna be odd from then on</p>
<p>because if they were even, I could factor out</p>
<p>two out of them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not all the odd numbers.</p>
<p>Nine isn&rsquo;t prime because it&rsquo;s three times three.</p>
<p>15 isn&rsquo;t prime because it&rsquo;s three times five,</p>
<p>but 13 is.</p>
<p>Where were we?</p>
<p>Two, three, five, seven, 11, 13, 17, 19.</p>
<p>Not 21, but 23 is, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, so you could go on.</p>
<p>How high could you go if we were just sitting here?</p>
<p>By the way, your own brain.</p>
<p>If continuous, without interruption,</p>
<p>would you be able to go over 100?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always those ones that trip people up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous one, the Grotendeek prime 57,</p>
<p>like sort of Alexander Grotendeek,</p>
<p>the great algebraic geometer was sort of giving</p>
<p>some lecture involving a choice of a prime in general.</p>
<p>And somebody said, can&rsquo;t you just choose a prime?</p>
<p>And he said, okay, 57, which is in fact not prime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s three times 19.</p>
<p>Oh, damn.</p>
<p>But it was like, I promise you in some circles</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a funny story.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a humor in it.</p>
<p>Yes, I would say over 100, I definitely don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Like 107, I think, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Okay, like, I mean.</p>
<p>So is there a category of like fake primes</p>
<p>that are easily mistaken to be prime?</p>
<p>Like 57, I wonder.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I would say 57 and 51 are definitely</p>
<p>like prime offenders.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t do that on purpose.</p>
<p>Oh, well done.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose.</p>
<p>Anyway, they&rsquo;re definitely ones that people,</p>
<p>or 91 is another classic, seven times 13.</p>
<p>It really feels kind of prime, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But it is not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also, by the way,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also an actual notion of pseudo prime,</p>
<p>which is a thing with a formal definition,</p>
<p>which is not a psychological thing.</p>
<p>It is a prime which passes a primality test</p>
<p>devised by Fermat, which is a very good test,</p>
<p>which if a number fails this test,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely not prime.</p>
<p>And so there was some hope that,</p>
<p>oh, maybe if a number passes the test,</p>
<p>then it definitely is prime.</p>
<p>That would give a very simple criterion for primality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s only perfect in one direction.</p>
<p>So there are numbers, I want to say 341 is the smallest,</p>
<p>which pass the test but are not prime, 341.</p>
<p>Is this test easily explainable or no?</p>
<p>Yes, actually.</p>
<p>Ready, let me give you the simplest version of it.</p>
<p>You can dress it up a little bit, but here&rsquo;s the basic idea.</p>
<p>I take the number, the mystery number,</p>
<p>I raise two to that power.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say your mystery number is six.</p>
<p>Are you sorry you asked me?</p>
<p>Are you ready?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re breaking my brain again, but yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do a live demonstration.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say your number is six.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to raise two to the sixth power.</p>
<p>Okay, so if I were working on it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like that&rsquo;s two cubes squared,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s eight times eight, so that&rsquo;s 64.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to divide by six,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t actually care what the quotient is,</p>
<p>only the remainder.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see, 64 divided by six is,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s a quotient of 10, but the remainder is four.</p>
<p>So you failed because the answer has to be two.</p>
<p>For any prime, let&rsquo;s do it with five, which is prime.</p>
<p>Two to the fifth is 32.</p>
<p>Divide 32 by five, and you get six with a remainder of two.</p>
<p>With a remainder of two, yeah.</p>
<p>For seven, two to the seventh is 128.</p>
<p>Divide that by seven, and let&rsquo;s see,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s seven times 14, is that right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Seven times 18 is 126 with a remainder of two, right?</p>
<p>128 is a multiple of seven plus two.</p>
<p>So if that remainder is not two,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s definitely not prime.</p>
<p>And then if it is, it&rsquo;s likely a prime, but not for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely a prime, but not for sure.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a beautiful geometric proof</p>
<p>which is in the book, actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like one of the most granular parts of the book</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a beautiful proof, I couldn&rsquo;t not give it.</p>
<p>So you draw a lot of like opal and pearl necklaces</p>
<p>and spin them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the geometric nature</p>
<p>of this proof of Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem.</p>
<p>So yeah, so with pseudo primes,</p>
<p>there are primes that are kind of faking it.</p>
<p>They pass that test, but there are numbers</p>
<p>that are faking it that pass that test,</p>
<p>but are not actually prime.</p>
<p>But the point is, there are many, many,</p>
<p>many theorems about prime numbers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of questions to ask.</p>
<p>Is there an infinite number of primes?</p>
<p>Can we say something about the gap between primes</p>
<p>as the numbers grow larger and larger and larger and so on?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a perfect example of your desire</p>
<p>for simplicity in all things.</p>
<p>You know what would be really simple?</p>
<p>If there was only finitely many primes</p>
<p>and then there would be this finite set of atoms</p>
<p>that all numbers would be built up.</p>
<p>That would be very simple and good in certain ways,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s completely false.</p>
<p>And number theory would be totally different</p>
<p>if that were the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>In fact, this is something else that Euclid knew.</p>
<p>So this is a very, very old fact,</p>
<p>like much before, long before we&rsquo;ve had anything</p>
<p>like modern number theory.</p>
<p>The primes are infinite.</p>
<p>The primes that there are, right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an infinite number of primes.</p>
<p>So what about the gaps between the primes?</p>
<p>Right, so one thing that people recognized</p>
<p>and really thought about a lot is that the primes,</p>
<p>on average, seem to get farther and farther apart</p>
<p>as they get bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s less and less common.</p>
<p>Like I already told you of the first 10 numbers,</p>
<p>two, three, five, seven, four of them are prime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot, 40%.</p>
<p>If I looked at 10 digit numbers,</p>
<p>no way would 40% of those be prime.</p>
<p>Being prime would be a lot rarer.</p>
<p>In some sense, because there&rsquo;s a lot more things</p>
<p>for them to be divisible by.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way of thinking of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more possible for there to be a factorization</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>you can try to factor out of it.</p>
<p>As the numbers get bigger and bigger,</p>
<p>primality gets rarer and rarer, and the extent</p>
<p>to which that&rsquo;s the case, that&rsquo;s pretty well understood.</p>
<p>But then you can ask more fine grained questions,</p>
<p>and here is one.</p>
<p>A twin prime is a pair of primes that are two apart,</p>
<p>like three and five, or like 11 and 13, or like 17 and 19.</p>
<p>And one thing we still don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is are there infinitely many of those?</p>
<p>We know on average, they get farther and farther apart,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean there couldn&rsquo;t be occasional folks</p>
<p>that come close together.</p>
<p>And indeed, we think that there are.</p>
<p>And one interesting question, I mean, this is,</p>
<p>because I think you might say,</p>
<p>well, how could one possibly have a right</p>
<p>to have an opinion about something like that?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any way of describing a process</p>
<p>that makes primes.</p>
<p>Sure, you can look at your computer</p>
<p>and see a lot of them, but the fact that there&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>why is that evidence that there&rsquo;s infinitely many, right?</p>
<p>Maybe I can go on the computer and find 10 million.</p>
<p>Well, 10 million is pretty far from infinity, right?</p>
<p>So how is that evidence?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a lot more than 10 million atoms.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s infinitely many atoms</p>
<p>in the universe, right?</p>
<p>I mean, on most people&rsquo;s physical theories,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably not, as I understand it.</p>
<p>Okay, so why would we think this?</p>
<p>The answer is that it turns out to be like incredibly</p>
<p>productive and enlightening to think about primes</p>
<p>as if they were random numbers,</p>
<p>as if they were randomly distributed</p>
<p>according to a certain law.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re not random.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no chance involved.</p>
<p>There it&rsquo;s completely deterministic</p>
<p>whether a number is prime or not.</p>
<p>And yet it just turns out to be phenomenally useful</p>
<p>in mathematics to say,</p>
<p>even if something is governed by a deterministic law,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just pretend it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just pretend that they were produced</p>
<p>by some random process and see if the behavior</p>
<p>is roughly the same.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not, maybe change the random process,</p>
<p>maybe make the randomness a little bit different</p>
<p>and tweak it and see if you can find a random process</p>
<p>that matches the behavior we see.</p>
<p>And then maybe you predict that other behaviors</p>
<p>of the system are like that of the random process.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s kind of like, it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>because I think when you talk to people</p>
<p>at the twin prime conjecture,</p>
<p>people think you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>wow, there&rsquo;s like some deep structure there</p>
<p>that like makes those primes be like close together</p>
<p>again and again.</p>
<p>And no, it&rsquo;s the opposite of deep structure.</p>
<p>What we say when we say we believe the twin prime conjecture</p>
<p>is that we believe the primes are like sort of</p>
<p>strewn around pretty randomly.</p>
<p>And if they were, then by chance,</p>
<p>you would expect there to be infinitely many twin primes.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re saying, yeah, we expect them to behave</p>
<p>just like they would if they were random dirt.</p>
<p>The fascinating parallel here is,</p>
<p>I just got a chance to talk to Sam Harris</p>
<p>and he uses the prime numbers as an example.</p>
<p>Often, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with who Sam is.</p>
<p>He uses that as an example of there being no free will.</p>
<p>Wait, where does he get this?</p>
<p>Well, he just uses as an example of,</p>
<p>it might seem like this is a random number generator,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all like formally defined.</p>
<p>So if we keep getting more and more primes,</p>
<p>then like that might feel like a new discovery</p>
<p>and that might feel like a new experience, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It was always written in the cards.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny that you say that</p>
<p>because a lot of people think of like randomness,</p>
<p>the fundamental randomness within the nature of reality</p>
<p>might be the source of something</p>
<p>that we experience as free will.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s like useful to look at prime numbers</p>
<p>as a random process in order to prove stuff about them.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, of course, it&rsquo;s not a random process.</p>
<p>Well, not in order to prove some stuff about them</p>
<p>so much as to figure out what we expect to be true</p>
<p>and then try to prove that.</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s what you don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>Try really hard to prove something that&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>That makes it really hard to prove the thing if it&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>So you certainly want to have some heuristic ways</p>
<p>of guessing, making good guesses about what&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So yeah, here&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be imaginary Sam Harris now.</p>
<p>Like you are talking about prime numbers</p>
<p>and you are like,</p>
<p>but prime numbers are completely deterministic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying like,</p>
<p>well, but let&rsquo;s treat them like a random process.</p>
<p>And then you say,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re just saying something that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not a random process, they&rsquo;re deterministic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, great.</p>
<p>You hold to your insistence that it&rsquo;s not a random process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m generating insight about the primes</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not because I&rsquo;m willing to sort of pretend</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>in order to understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the reality is.</p>
<p>What matters is what framework of thought</p>
<p>results in the maximum number of insights.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I feel, look, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>but I feel like you have more insights about people.</p>
<p>If you think of them as like beings that have wants</p>
<p>and needs and desires and do stuff on purpose,</p>
<p>even if that&rsquo;s not true,</p>
<p>you still understand better what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>by treating them in that way.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you find, look, when you work on machine learning,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you find yourself sort of talking</p>
<p>about what the machine is trying to do</p>
<p>in a certain instance?</p>
<p>Do you not find yourself drawn to that language?</p>
<p>Well, it knows this, it&rsquo;s trying to do that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s learning that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly drawn to that language</p>
<p>to the point where I receive quite a bit of criticisms</p>
<p>for it because I, you know, like.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m on your side, man.</p>
<p>So especially in robotics, I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>but robotics people don&rsquo;t like to name their robots.</p>
<p>They certainly don&rsquo;t like to gender their robots</p>
<p>because the moment you gender a robot,</p>
<p>you start to anthropomorphize.</p>
<p>If you say he or she, you start to,</p>
<p>in your mind, construct like a life story.</p>
<p>In your mind, you can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, you create like a humorous story</p>
<p>to this person.</p>
<p>You start to, this person, this robot,</p>
<p>you start to project your own.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s what we do to each other.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually really useful</p>
<p>for the engineering process,</p>
<p>especially for human robot interaction.</p>
<p>And yes, for machine learning systems,</p>
<p>for helping you build an intuition</p>
<p>about a particular problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like asking this question,</p>
<p>you know, when a machine learning system fails</p>
<p>in a particular edge case, asking like,</p>
<p>what were you thinking about?</p>
<p>Like, like asking, like almost like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about to a child</p>
<p>who just did something bad, you want to understand</p>
<p>like what was, how did they see the world?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a totally new, maybe you&rsquo;re the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s thinking about the world incorrectly.</p>
<p>And yeah, that anthropomorphization process,</p>
<p>I think is ultimately good for insight.</p>
<p>And the same is, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I tend to believe about free will as well.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a ridiculous question, if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just recently, most people go on like rabbit hole,</p>
<p>like YouTube things.</p>
<p>And I went on a rabbit hole often do of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>And I found a page on</p>
<p>finiteism, ultra finiteism and intuitionism</p>
<p>or into, I forget what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>Yeah, intuitionism.</p>
<p>Intuitionism.</p>
<p>That seemed pretty, pretty interesting.</p>
<p>I have it on my to do list actually like look into</p>
<p>like, is there people who like formally attract,</p>
<p>like real mathematicians are trying to argue for this.</p>
<p>But the belief there, I think, let&rsquo;s say finiteism</p>
<p>that infinity is fake.</p>
<p>Meaning, infinity might be like a useful hack</p>
<p>for certain, like a useful tool in mathematics,</p>
<p>but it really gets us into trouble</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no infinity in the real world.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m sort of not expressing that fully correctly,</p>
<p>but basically saying like there&rsquo;s things</p>
<p>that once you add into mathematics,</p>
<p>things that are not provably within the physical world,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re starting to inject to corrupt your framework</p>
<p>of reason.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>I mean, I think, okay, so first of all, I&rsquo;m not an expert</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t even tell you what the difference is</p>
<p>between those three terms, finiteism, ultra finiteism</p>
<p>and intuitionism, although I know they&rsquo;re related</p>
<p>and I tend to associate them with the Netherlands</p>
<p>in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll tell you, can I just quickly comment</p>
<p>because I read the Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>The difference in ultra.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the ultimate sentence of the modern age.</p>
<p>Can I just comment because I read the Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>That sums up our moment.</p>
<p>Bro, I&rsquo;m basically an expert.</p>
<p>Ultra finiteism.</p>
<p>So, finiteism says that the only infinity</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to have is that the natural numbers</p>
<p>are infinite.</p>
<p>So, like those numbers are infinite.</p>
<p>So, like one, two, three, four, five,</p>
<p>the integers are infinite.</p>
<p>The ultra finiteism says, nope, even that infinity is fake.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet ultra finiteism came second.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s like when there&rsquo;s like a hardcore scene</p>
<p>and then one guy&rsquo;s like, oh, now there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>in the scene.</p>
<p>I have to find a way to be more hardcore</p>
<p>than the hardcore people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all back to the emo, Doc.</p>
<p>Okay, so is there any, are you ever,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m often uncomfortable with infinity,</p>
<p>like psychologically.</p>
<p>I have trouble when that sneaks in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it works so damn well,</p>
<p>I get a little suspicious,</p>
<p>because it could be almost like a crutch</p>
<p>or an oversimplification that&rsquo;s missing something profound</p>
<p>about reality.</p>
<p>Well, so first of all, okay, if you say like,</p>
<p>is there like a serious way of doing mathematics</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t really treat infinity as a real thing</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s kind of agnostic</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not really gonna make a firm statement</p>
<p>about whether it&rsquo;s a real thing or not.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s called most of the history of mathematics.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only after Cantor that we really are sort of,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna like have a notion</p>
<p>of like the cardinality of an infinite set</p>
<p>and like do something that you might call</p>
<p>like the modern theory of infinity.</p>
<p>That said, obviously everybody was drawn to this notion</p>
<p>and no, not everybody was comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, this is what happens with Newton.</p>
<p>I mean, so Newton understands that to talk about tangents</p>
<p>and to talk about instantaneous velocity,</p>
<p>he has to do something that we would now call</p>
<p>taking a limit, right?</p>
<p>The fabled dy over dx, if you sort of go back</p>
<p>to your calculus class, for those who have taken calculus</p>
<p>and remember this mysterious thing.</p>
<p>And you know, what is it?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;d say like, well, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you sort of divide the length of this line segment</p>
<p>by the length of this other line segment.</p>
<p>And then you make them a little shorter</p>
<p>and you divide again.</p>
<p>And then you make them a little shorter</p>
<p>and you divide again.</p>
<p>And then you just keep on doing that</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re like infinitely short</p>
<p>and then you divide them again.</p>
<p>These quantities that are like, they&rsquo;re not zero,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also smaller than any actual number,</p>
<p>these infinitesimals.</p>
<p>Well, people were queasy about it</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t wrong to be queasy about it, right?</p>
<p>From a modern perspective, it was not really well formed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this very famous critique of Newton</p>
<p>by Bishop Berkeley, where he says like,</p>
<p>what these things you define, like, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not zero, but they&rsquo;re smaller than any number.</p>
<p>Are they the ghosts of departed quantities?</p>
<p>That was this like ultra burn of Newton.</p>
<p>And on the one hand, he was right.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really rigorous by modern standards.</p>
<p>On the other hand, like Newton was out there doing calculus</p>
<p>and other people were not, right?</p>
<p>It works, it works.</p>
<p>I think a sort of intuitionist view, for instance,</p>
<p>I would say would express serious doubt.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s not just infinity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, I think we would express serious doubt</p>
<p>that like the real numbers exist.</p>
<p>Now, most people are comfortable with the real numbers.</p>
<p>Well, computer scientists with floating point number,</p>
<p>I mean, floating point arithmetic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great point, actually.</p>
<p>I think in some sense, this flavor of doing math,</p>
<p>saying we shouldn&rsquo;t talk about things</p>
<p>that we cannot specify in a finite amount of time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something very computational in flavor about that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably not a coincidence</p>
<p>that it becomes popular in the 30s and 40s,</p>
<p>which is also like kind of like the dawn of ideas</p>
<p>about formal computation, right?</p>
<p>You probably know the timeline better than I do.</p>
<p>Sorry, what becomes popular?</p>
<p>These ideas that maybe we should be doing math</p>
<p>in this more restrictive way where even a thing that,</p>
<p>because look, the origin of all this is like,</p>
<p>number represents a magnitude, like the length of a line.</p>
<p>So I mean, the idea that there&rsquo;s a continuum,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of like, it&rsquo;s pretty old,</p>
<p>but just because something is old</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t reject it if we want to.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of the fundamental ideas in computer science,</p>
<p>when you talk about the complexity of problems,</p>
<p>to Turing himself, they rely on an infinity as well.</p>
<p>The ideas that kind of challenge that,</p>
<p>the whole space of machine learning,</p>
<p>I would say, challenges that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the engineering approach to things,</p>
<p>like the floating point arithmetic.</p>
<p>The other one that, back to John Conway,</p>
<p>that challenges this idea,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe to tie in the ideas of deformation theory</p>
<p>and limits to infinity is this idea of cellular automata</p>
<p>with John Conway looking at the game of life,</p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of for a while, cellular automata.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you have,</p>
<p>if you have ever encountered these kinds of objects,</p>
<p>you ever looked at them as a mathematician,</p>
<p>where you have very simple rules of tiny little objects</p>
<p>that when taken as a whole create incredible complexities,</p>
<p>but are very difficult to analyze,</p>
<p>very difficult to make sense of,</p>
<p>even though the one individual object, one part,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what we were saying about Andrew Wiles,</p>
<p>you can look at the deformation of a small piece</p>
<p>to tell you about the whole.</p>
<p>It feels like with cellular automata</p>
<p>or any kind of complex systems,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often very difficult to say something</p>
<p>about the whole thing,</p>
<p>even when you can precisely describe the operation</p>
<p>of the local neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I love that subject.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really done research on it myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played around with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you a fun blog post I wrote</p>
<p>where I made some cool texture patterns</p>
<p>from cellular automata that I, but.</p>
<p>And those are really always compelling</p>
<p>is like you create simple rules</p>
<p>and they create some beautiful textures.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Actually, did you see, there was a great paper.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this,</p>
<p>like a machine learning paper.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw the one I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>where they were like learning the texture</p>
<p>as like let&rsquo;s try to like reverse engineer</p>
<p>and like learn a cellular automaton</p>
<p>that can reduce texture that looks like this</p>
<p>from the images.</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
<p>And as you say, the thing you said is I feel the same way</p>
<p>when I read machine learning paper</p>
<p>is that what&rsquo;s especially interesting</p>
<p>is the cases where it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Like what does it do when it doesn&rsquo;t do the thing</p>
<p>that you tried to train it to do?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s extremely interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that was a cool paper.</p>
<p>So yeah, so let&rsquo;s start with the game of life.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with, or let&rsquo;s start with John Conway.</p>
<p>So Conway.</p>
<p>So yeah, so let&rsquo;s start with John Conway again.</p>
<p>Just, I don&rsquo;t know, from my outsider&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not many mathematicians that stand out</p>
<p>throughout the history of the 20th century.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>I feel like he&rsquo;s not sufficiently recognized.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s pretty recognized.</p>
<p>Okay, well.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a full professor at Princeton</p>
<p>for most of his life.</p>
<p>He was sort of certainly at the pinnacle of.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I found myself every time I talk about Conway</p>
<p>and how excited I am about him,</p>
<p>I have to constantly explain to people who he is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always a sad sign to me.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s probably true for a lot of mathematicians.</p>
<p>I was about to say,</p>
<p>I feel like you have a very elevated idea of how famous.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you grow up in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>or you think the mathematicians are like very, very famous.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&rsquo;m not actually so convinced at a tiny tangent</p>
<p>that that shouldn&rsquo;t be so.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not obvious to me</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s one of the,</p>
<p>like if I were to analyze American society,</p>
<p>that perhaps elevating mathematical and scientific thinking</p>
<p>to a little bit higher level would benefit the society.</p>
<p>Well, both in discovering the beauty of what it is</p>
<p>to be human and for actually creating cool technology,</p>
<p>better iPhones.</p>
<p>But anyway, John Conway.</p>
<p>Yeah, and Conway is such a perfect example</p>
<p>of somebody whose humanity was,</p>
<p>and his personality was like wound up</p>
<p>with his mathematics, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not, sometimes I think people</p>
<p>who are outside the field think of mathematics</p>
<p>as this kind of like cold thing that you do</p>
<p>separate from your existence as a human being.</p>
<p>No way, your personality is in there,</p>
<p>just as it would be in like a novel you wrote</p>
<p>or a painting you painted</p>
<p>or just like the way you walk down the street.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s in there, it&rsquo;s you doing it.</p>
<p>And Conway was certainly a singular personality.</p>
<p>I think anybody would say that he was playful,</p>
<p>like everything was a game to him.</p>
<p>Now, what you might think I&rsquo;m gonna say,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true is that he sort of was very playful</p>
<p>in his way of doing mathematics,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also true, it went both ways.</p>
<p>He also sort of made mathematics out of games.</p>
<p>He like looked at, he was a constant inventor of games</p>
<p>or like crazy names.</p>
<p>And then he would sort of analyze those games mathematically</p>
<p>to the point that he,</p>
<p>and then later collaborating with Knuth like,</p>
<p>created this number system, the serial numbers</p>
<p>in which actually each number is a game.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful book about this called,</p>
<p>I mean, there are his own books.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like a book that he wrote</p>
<p>with Berlekamp and Guy called Winning Ways,</p>
<p>which is such a rich source of ideas.</p>
<p>And he too kind of has his own crazy number system</p>
<p>in which by the way, there are these infinitesimals,</p>
<p>the ghosts of departed quantities.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in there now, not as ghosts,</p>
<p>but as like certain kind of two player games.</p>
<p>So, he was a guy, so I knew him when I was a postdoc</p>
<p>and I knew him at Princeton</p>
<p>and our research overlapped in some ways.</p>
<p>Now it was on stuff that he had worked on many years before.</p>
<p>The stuff I was working on kind of connected</p>
<p>with stuff in group theory,</p>
<p>which somehow seems to keep coming up.</p>
<p>And so I often would like sort of ask him a question.</p>
<p>I would sort of come upon him in the common room</p>
<p>and I would ask him a question about something.</p>
<p>And just anytime you turned him on, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>You sort of asked the question,</p>
<p>it was just like turning a knob and winding him up</p>
<p>and he would just go and you would get a response</p>
<p>that was like so rich and went so many places</p>
<p>and taught you so much.</p>
<p>And usually had nothing to do with your question.</p>
<p>Usually your question was just a prompt to him.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t count on actually getting the question answered.</p>
<p>Yeah, those brilliant, curious minds even at that age.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was definitely a huge loss.</p>
<p>But on his game of life,</p>
<p>which was I think he developed in the 70s</p>
<p>as almost like a side thing, a fun little experiment.</p>
<p>His game of life is this, it&rsquo;s a very simple algorithm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really a game per se</p>
<p>in the sense of the kinds of games that he liked</p>
<p>where people played against each other.</p>
<p>But essentially it&rsquo;s a game that you play</p>
<p>with marking little squares on the sheet of graph paper.</p>
<p>And in the 70s, I think he was like literally doing it</p>
<p>with like a pen on graph paper.</p>
<p>You have some configuration of squares.</p>
<p>Some of the squares in the graph paper are filled in,</p>
<p>some are not.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a rule, a single rule that tells you</p>
<p>at the next stage, which squares are filled in</p>
<p>and which squares are not.</p>
<p>Sometimes an empty square gets filled in,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called birth.</p>
<p>Sometimes a square that&rsquo;s filled in gets erased,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called death.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s rules for which squares are born</p>
<p>and which squares die.</p>
<p>The rule is very simple.</p>
<p>You can write it on one line.</p>
<p>And then the great miracle is that you can start</p>
<p>from some very innocent looking little small set of boxes</p>
<p>and get these results of incredible richness.</p>
<p>And of course, nowadays you don&rsquo;t do it on paper.</p>
<p>Nowadays you do it in a computer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a great iPad app called Golly,</p>
<p>which I really like that has like Conway&rsquo;s original rule</p>
<p>and like, gosh, like hundreds of other variants</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a lightning fast.</p>
<p>So you can just be like,</p>
<p>I wanna see 10,000 generations of this rule play out</p>
<p>like faster than your eye can even follow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like amazing.</p>
<p>So I highly recommend it if this is at all intriguing to you</p>
<p>getting Golly on your iOS device.</p>
<p>And you can do this kind of process,</p>
<p>which I really enjoy doing,</p>
<p>which is almost from like putting a Darwin hat on</p>
<p>or a biologist hat on and doing analysis</p>
<p>of a higher level of abstraction,</p>
<p>like the organisms that spring up.</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s different kinds of organisms.</p>
<p>Like you can think of them as species</p>
<p>and they interact with each other.</p>
<p>They can, there&rsquo;s gliders, they shoot different,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like things that can travel around.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things that can,</p>
<p>glider guns that can generate those gliders.</p>
<p>You can use the same kind of language</p>
<p>as you would about describing a biological system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a wonderful laboratory</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of a rebuke to someone</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t think that like very, very rich,</p>
<p>complex structure can come from very simple underlying laws.</p>
<p>Like it definitely can.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>If you just pick like some random rule,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t get interesting complexity.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the most interesting things</p>
<p>of these, one of these most interesting features</p>
<p>of this whole subject,</p>
<p>that the rules have to be tuned just right.</p>
<p>Like a sort of typical rule set</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t generate any kind of interesting behavior.</p>
<p>But some do.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we have a clear way of understanding</p>
<p>which do and which don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Maybe Steven thinks he does, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s a giant mystery where Steven Wolfram did is,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s a whole interesting aspect to the fact</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s a little bit of an outcast</p>
<p>in the mathematics and physics community</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s so focused on a particular,</p>
<p>his particular work.</p>
<p>I think if you put ego aside,</p>
<p>which I think unfairly some people</p>
<p>are not able to look beyond,</p>
<p>I think his work is actually quite brilliant.</p>
<p>But what he did is exactly this process</p>
<p>of Darwin like exploration.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s taking these very simple ideas</p>
<p>and writing a thousand page book on them,</p>
<p>meaning like, let&rsquo;s play around with this thing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>And can we figure anything out?</p>
<p>Spoiler alert, no, we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In fact, he does a challenge.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like rule 30 challenge,</p>
<p>which is quite interesting,</p>
<p>just simply for machine learning people,</p>
<p>for mathematics people,</p>
<p>is can you predict the middle column?</p>
<p>For his, it&rsquo;s a 1D cellular automata.</p>
<p>Can you, generally speaking,</p>
<p>can you predict anything about</p>
<p>how a particular rule will evolve just in the future?</p>
<p>Very simple.</p>
<p>Just looking at one particular part of the world,</p>
<p>just zooming in on that part,</p>
<p>100 steps ahead, can you predict something?</p>
<p>And the challenge is to do that kind of prediction</p>
<p>so far as nobody&rsquo;s come up with an answer.</p>
<p>But the point is like, we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have tools or maybe it&rsquo;s impossible or,</p>
<p>I mean, he has these kind of laws of irreducibility</p>
<p>that he refers to, but it&rsquo;s poetry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we can&rsquo;t prove these things.</p>
<p>It seems like we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic.</p>
<p>It almost sounds like ancient mathematics</p>
<p>or something like that, where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>the gods will not allow us to predict the cellular automata.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s fascinating that we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s power to calling this particular set of rules</p>
<p>game of life as Conway did, because not exactly sure,</p>
<p>but I think he had a sense that there&rsquo;s some core ideas here</p>
<p>that are fundamental to life, to complex systems,</p>
<p>to the way life emerge on earth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I think Conway thought that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that, I mean, Conway always had</p>
<p>a rather ambivalent relationship with the game of life</p>
<p>because I think he saw it as,</p>
<p>it was certainly the thing he was most famous for</p>
<p>in the outside world.</p>
<p>And I think that he, his view, which is correct,</p>
<p>is that he had done things</p>
<p>that were much deeper mathematically than that.</p>
<p>And I think it always aggrieved him a bit</p>
<p>that he was the game of life guy</p>
<p>when he proved all these wonderful theorems</p>
<p>and created all these wonderful games,</p>
<p>created the serial numbers.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a very tireless guy</p>
<p>who just did an incredibly variegated array of stuff.</p>
<p>So he was exactly the kind of person</p>
<p>who you would never want to reduce to one achievement.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Let me ask you about group theory.</p>
<p>You mentioned it a few times.</p>
<p>What is group theory?</p>
<p>What is an idea from group theory that you find beautiful?</p>
<p>Well, so I would say group theory sort of starts</p>
<p>as the general theory of symmetries,</p>
<p>that people looked at different kinds of things</p>
<p>and said, as we said, oh, it could have,</p>
<p>maybe all there is is symmetry from left to right,</p>
<p>like a human being, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s roughly bilaterally symmetric, as we say.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two symmetries.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, well, wait, didn&rsquo;t I say</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just one, there&rsquo;s just left to right?</p>
<p>Well, we always count the symmetry of doing nothing.</p>
<p>We always count the symmetry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s flip and don&rsquo;t flip.</p>
<p>Those are the two configurations that you can be in.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two.</p>
<p>You know, something like a rectangle</p>
<p>is bilaterally symmetric.</p>
<p>You can flip it left to right,</p>
<p>but you can also flip it top to bottom.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually four symmetries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s do nothing, flip it left to right</p>
<p>and flip it top to bottom or do both of those things.</p>
<p>And then a square, there&rsquo;s even more,</p>
<p>because now you can rotate it.</p>
<p>You can rotate it by 90 degrees.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a symmetry of the rectangle.</p>
<p>If you try to rotate it 90 degrees,</p>
<p>you get a rectangle oriented in a different way.</p>
<p>So a person has two symmetries,</p>
<p>a rectangle four, a square eight,</p>
<p>different kinds of shapes</p>
<p>have different numbers of symmetries.</p>
<p>And the real observation is that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just not like a set of things, they can be combined.</p>
<p>You do one symmetry, then you do another.</p>
<p>The result of that is some third symmetry.</p>
<p>So a group really abstracts away this notion of saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just some collection of transformations</p>
<p>you can do to a thing</p>
<p>where you combine any two of them to get a third.</p>
<p>So, you know, a place where this comes up</p>
<p>in computer science is in sorting,</p>
<p>because the ways of permuting a set,</p>
<p>the ways of taking sort of some set of things</p>
<p>you have on the table</p>
<p>and putting them in a different order,</p>
<p>shuffling a deck of cards, for instance,</p>
<p>those are the symmetries of the deck.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not two, there&rsquo;s not four, there&rsquo;s not eight.</p>
<p>Think about how many different orders</p>
<p>the deck of card can be in.</p>
<p>Each one of those is the result of applying a symmetry</p>
<p>to the original deck.</p>
<p>So a shuffle is a symmetry, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re reordering the cards.</p>
<p>If I shuffle and then you shuffle,</p>
<p>the result is some other kind of thing.</p>
<p>You might call it a double shuffle,</p>
<p>which is a more complicated symmetry.</p>
<p>So group theory is kind of the study</p>
<p>of the general abstract world</p>
<p>that encompasses all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>But then of course, like lots of things</p>
<p>that are way more complicated than that.</p>
<p>Like infinite groups of symmetries, for instance.</p>
<p>So they can be infinite, huh?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, okay, ready?</p>
<p>Think about the symmetries of the line.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, okay, I can reflect it left to right,</p>
<p>you know, around the origin.</p>
<p>Okay, but I could also reflect it left to right,</p>
<p>grabbing somewhere else, like at one or two</p>
<p>or pi or anywhere.</p>
<p>Or I could just slide it some distance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a symmetry.</p>
<p>Slide it five units over.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s clearly infinitely many symmetries of the line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example of an infinite group of symmetries.</p>
<p>Is it possible to say something that kind of captivates,</p>
<p>keeps being brought up by physicists,</p>
<p>which is gauge theory, gauge symmetry,</p>
<p>as one of the more complicated type of symmetries?</p>
<p>Is there an easy explanation of what the heck it is?</p>
<p>Is that something that comes up on your mind at all?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not a mathematical physicist,</p>
<p>but I can say this.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that it has been a very useful notion</p>
<p>in physics to try to say like,</p>
<p>what are the symmetry groups of the world?</p>
<p>Like what are the symmetries</p>
<p>under which things don&rsquo;t change, right?</p>
<p>So we just, I think we talked a little bit earlier</p>
<p>about it should be a basic principle</p>
<p>that a theorem that&rsquo;s true here is also true over there.</p>
<p>And same for a physical law, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if gravity is like this over here,</p>
<p>it should also be like this over there.</p>
<p>Okay, what that&rsquo;s saying is we think translation in space</p>
<p>should be a symmetry.</p>
<p>All the laws of physics should be unchanged</p>
<p>if the symmetry we have in mind</p>
<p>is a very simple one like translation.</p>
<p>And so then there becomes a question,</p>
<p>like what are the symmetries of the actual world</p>
<p>with its physical laws?</p>
<p>And one way of thinking, this isn&rsquo;t oversimplification,</p>
<p>but like one way of thinking of this big shift</p>
<p>from before Einstein to after</p>
<p>is that we just changed our idea</p>
<p>about what the fundamental group of symmetries were.</p>
<p>So that things like the Lorenz contraction,</p>
<p>things like these bizarre relativistic phenomenon</p>
<p>or Lorenz would have said, oh, to make this work,</p>
<p>we need a thing to change its shape</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s moving nearly the speed of light.</p>
<p>Well, under the new framework, it&rsquo;s much better.</p>
<p>You say, oh, no, it wasn&rsquo;t changing its shape.</p>
<p>You were just wrong about what counted as a symmetry.</p>
<p>Now that we have this new group,</p>
<p>the so called Lorenz group,</p>
<p>now that we understand what the symmetries really are,</p>
<p>we see it was just an illusion</p>
<p>that the thing was changing its shape.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can then describe the sameness of things</p>
<p>under this weirdness that is general relativity,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, still, I wish there was a simpler explanation</p>
<p>of like exact, I mean, gauge symmetries,</p>
<p>pretty simple general concept about rulers being deformed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually just personally been on a search,</p>
<p>not a very rigorous or aggressive search,</p>
<p>but for something I personally enjoy,</p>
<p>which is taking complicated concepts</p>
<p>and finding the sort of minimal example</p>
<p>that I can play around with, especially programmatically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great, I mean,</p>
<p>this is what we try to train our students to do, right?</p>
<p>I mean, in class, this is exactly what,</p>
<p>this is like best pedagogical practice.</p>
<p>I do hope there&rsquo;s simple explanation,</p>
<p>especially like I&rsquo;ve in my sort of drunk random walk,</p>
<p>drunk walk, whatever that&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>sometimes stumble into the world of topology</p>
<p>and like quickly, like, you know when you go into a party</p>
<p>and you realize this is not the right party for me?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, so whenever I go into topology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like so much math everywhere.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what, it feels like this is me</p>
<p>like being a hater, I think there&rsquo;s way too much math.</p>
<p>Like there are two, the cool kids who just want to have,</p>
<p>like everything is expressed through math.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re actually afraid to express stuff</p>
<p>simply through language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my hater formulation of topology.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s very necessary</p>
<p>to do sort of rigorous discussion.</p>
<p>But I feel like.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s what gauge symmetry is like?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not a field I know well,</p>
<p>but it certainly seems like.</p>
<p>Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p>But my problem with topology, okay,</p>
<p>and even like differential geometry is like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about beautiful things.</p>
<p>Like if they could be visualized, it&rsquo;s open question</p>
<p>if everything could be visualized,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re talking about things</p>
<p>that can be visually stunning, I think.</p>
<p>But they are hidden underneath all of that math.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the papers that are written</p>
<p>in topology, if you look at all the discussions</p>
<p>on Stack Exchange, they&rsquo;re all math dense, math heavy.</p>
<p>And the only kind of visual things</p>
<p>that emerge every once in a while,</p>
<p>is like something like a Mobius strip.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, some kind of simple visualizations.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s the vibration, there&rsquo;s the hop vibration</p>
<p>or all those kinds of things that somebody,</p>
<p>some grad student from like 20 years ago</p>
<p>wrote a program in Fortran to visualize it, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, you know, it&rsquo;s makes me sad</p>
<p>because those are visual disciplines.</p>
<p>Just like computer vision is a visual discipline.</p>
<p>So you can provide a lot of visual examples.</p>
<p>I wish topology was more excited</p>
<p>and in love with visualizing some of the ideas.</p>
<p>I mean, you could say that, but I would say for me,</p>
<p>a picture of the hop vibration does nothing for me.</p>
<p>Whereas like when you&rsquo;re like, oh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like about the quaternions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a subgroup of the quaternions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, so now I see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Like, why didn&rsquo;t you just say that?</p>
<p>Why were you like showing me this stupid picture</p>
<p>instead of telling me what you were talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, no, but it goes back</p>
<p>to what you were saying about teaching</p>
<p>that like people are different in what they&rsquo;ll respond to.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s no, I mean, I&rsquo;m very opposed</p>
<p>to the idea that there&rsquo;s a one right way to explain things.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s like a huge variation in like, you know,</p>
<p>our brains like have all these like weird like hooks</p>
<p>and loops and it&rsquo;s like very hard to know</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s gonna latch on</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna be the same thing for everybody.</p>
<p>So I think monoculture is bad, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, and I think we&rsquo;re agreeing on that point</p>
<p>that like, it&rsquo;s good that there&rsquo;s like a lot</p>
<p>of different ways in and a lot of different ways</p>
<p>to describe these ideas because different people</p>
<p>are gonna find different things illuminating.</p>
<p>But that said, I think there&rsquo;s a lot to be discovered</p>
<p>when you force little like silos of brilliant people</p>
<p>to kind of find a middle ground</p>
<p>or like aggregate or come together in a way.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like people that do love visual things.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of disciplines,</p>
<p>especially in computer science</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re obsessed with visualizing,</p>
<p>visualizing data, visualizing neural networks.</p>
<p>I mean, neural networks themselves are fundamentally visual.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work in computer vision that&rsquo;s very visual.</p>
<p>And then coming together with some folks</p>
<p>that were like deeply rigorous</p>
<p>and are like totally lost in multi dimensional space</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s hard to even bring them back down to 3D.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very comfortable in this multi dimensional space.</p>
<p>So forcing them to kind of work together to communicate</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just about public communication of ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, I feel like when you&rsquo;re forced</p>
<p>to do that public communication like you did with your book,</p>
<p>I think deep profound ideas can be discovered</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like applicable for research and for science.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something about that simplification</p>
<p>or not simplification, but distillation or condensation</p>
<p>or whatever the hell you call it,</p>
<p>compression of ideas that somehow</p>
<p>actually stimulates creativity.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be excited to see more of that</p>
<p>in the mathematics community.</p>
<p>Can you?</p>
<p>Let me make a crazy metaphor.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a little bit like the relation</p>
<p>between prose and poetry, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if you, you might say like,</p>
<p>why do we need anything more than prose?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to convey some information.</p>
<p>So you just like say it.</p>
<p>Well, poetry does something, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of, you might think of it as a kind of compression.</p>
<p>Of course, not all poetry is compressed.</p>
<p>Like not all, some of it is quite baggy,</p>
<p>but like you are kind of, often it&rsquo;s compressed, right?</p>
<p>A lyric poem is often sort of like a compression</p>
<p>of what would take a long time</p>
<p>and be complicated to explain in prose</p>
<p>into sort of a different mode</p>
<p>that is gonna hit in a different way.</p>
<p>We talked about Poincare conjecture.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy, he&rsquo;s Russian, Grigori Perlman.</p>
<p>He proved Poincare&rsquo;s conjecture.</p>
<p>If you can comment on the proof itself,</p>
<p>if that stands out to you as something interesting</p>
<p>or the human story of it,</p>
<p>which is he turned down the field&rsquo;s metal for the proof.</p>
<p>Is there something you find inspiring or insightful</p>
<p>about the proof itself or about the man?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, one thing I really like about the proof</p>
<p>and partly that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s sort of a thing</p>
<p>that happens again and again in this book.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m writing about geometry and the way</p>
<p>it sort of appears in all these kind of real world problems.</p>
<p>But it happens so often that the geometry</p>
<p>you think you&rsquo;re studying is somehow not enough.</p>
<p>You have to go one level higher in abstraction</p>
<p>and study a higher level of geometry.</p>
<p>And the way that plays out is that Poincare asks a question</p>
<p>about a certain kind of three dimensional object.</p>
<p>Is it the usual three dimensional space that we know</p>
<p>or is it some kind of exotic thing?</p>
<p>And so, of course, this sounds like it&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>about the geometry of the three dimensional space,</p>
<p>but no, Perelman understands.</p>
<p>And by the way, in a tradition that involves</p>
<p>Richard Hamilton and many other people,</p>
<p>like most really important mathematical advances,</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t happen alone.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>It happens as the culmination of a program</p>
<p>that involves many people.</p>
<p>Same with Wiles, by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, we talked about Wiles and I wanna emphasize</p>
<p>that starting all the way back with Kummer,</p>
<p>who I mentioned in the 19th century,</p>
<p>but Gerhard Frey and Mazer and Ken Ribbit</p>
<p>and like many other people are involved</p>
<p>in building the other pieces of the arch</p>
<p>before you put the keystone in.</p>
<p>We stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, what is this idea?</p>
<p>The idea is that, well, of course,</p>
<p>the geometry of the three dimensional object itself</p>
<p>is relevant, but the real geometry you have to understand</p>
<p>is the geometry of the space</p>
<p>of all three dimensional geometries.</p>
<p>Whoa, you&rsquo;re going up a higher level.</p>
<p>Because when you do that, you can say,</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s trace out a path in that space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mechanism called Ricci flow.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re outside my research area.</p>
<p>So for all the geometric analysts</p>
<p>and differential geometers out there listening to this,</p>
<p>if I, please, I&rsquo;m doing my best and I&rsquo;m roughly saying it.</p>
<p>So the Ricci flow allows you to say like,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s start from some mystery three dimensional space,</p>
<p>which Poincare would conjecture is essentially</p>
<p>the same thing as our familiar three dimensional space,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>And now you let it flow.</p>
<p>You sort of like let it move in its natural path</p>
<p>according to some almost physical process</p>
<p>and ask where it winds up.</p>
<p>And what you find is that it always winds up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve continuously deformed it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that word deformation again.</p>
<p>And what you can prove is that the process doesn&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>until you get to the usual three dimensional space.</p>
<p>And since you can get from the mystery thing</p>
<p>to the standard space by this process</p>
<p>of continually changing and never kind of</p>
<p>having any sharp transitions,</p>
<p>then the original shape must&rsquo;ve been the same</p>
<p>as the standard shape.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the nature of the proof.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it&rsquo;s incredibly technical.</p>
<p>I think as I understand it,</p>
<p>I think the hard part is proving</p>
<p>that the favorite word of AI people,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get any singularities along the way.</p>
<p>But of course, in this context,</p>
<p>singularity just means acquiring a sharp kink.</p>
<p>It just means becoming non smooth at some point.</p>
<p>So just saying something interesting about formal,</p>
<p>about the smooth trajectory</p>
<p>through this weird space of geometries.</p>
<p>But yeah, so what I like about it</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s just one of many examples of where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about the geometry you think it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the geometry of all geometries, so to speak.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only by kind of like being jerked out of flatland.</p>
<p>Same idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only by sort of seeing the whole thing globally at once</p>
<p>that you can really make progress on understanding</p>
<p>the one thing you thought you were looking at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a romantic question,</p>
<p>but what do you think about him</p>
<p>turning down the Fields Medal?</p>
<p>Is that just, are Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals</p>
<p>just the cherry on top of the cake</p>
<p>and really math itself, the process of curiosity,</p>
<p>of pulling at the string of the mystery before us?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the cake?</p>
<p>And then the awards are just icing</p>
<p>and clearly I&rsquo;ve been fasting and I&rsquo;m hungry,</p>
<p>but do you think it&rsquo;s tragic or just a little curiosity</p>
<p>that he turned down the medal?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting because on the one hand,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s absolutely true that right,</p>
<p>in some kind of like vast spiritual sense,</p>
<p>like awards are not important,</p>
<p>like not important the way that sort of like</p>
<p>understanding the universe is important.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most people who are offered that prize</p>
<p>accept it, so there&rsquo;s something unusual</p>
<p>about his choice there.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I see it as tragic.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe if I don&rsquo;t really feel like</p>
<p>I have a clear picture of why he chose not to take it.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s not alone in doing things like this.</p>
<p>People sometimes turn down prizes for ideological reasons,</p>
<p>but probably more often in mathematics.</p>
<p>I mean, I think I&rsquo;m right in saying that</p>
<p>Peter Schultz turned down sort of some big monetary prize</p>
<p>because he just, you know, I mean, I think he,</p>
<p>at some point you have plenty of money</p>
<p>and maybe you think it sends the wrong message</p>
<p>about what the point of doing mathematics is.</p>
<p>I do find that there&rsquo;s most people accept.</p>
<p>You know, most people give it a prize.</p>
<p>Most people take it.</p>
<p>I mean, people like to be appreciated,</p>
<p>but like I said, we&rsquo;re people.</p>
<p>Not that different from most other people.</p>
<p>But the important reminder that that turning down</p>
<p>a prize serves for me is not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong</p>
<p>with the prize and there&rsquo;s something wonderful</p>
<p>about the prize, I think.</p>
<p>The Nobel prize is trickier</p>
<p>because so many Nobel prizes are given.</p>
<p>First of all, the Nobel prize often forgets</p>
<p>many, many of the important people throughout history.</p>
<p>Second of all, there&rsquo;s like these weird rules to it</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s only three people</p>
<p>and some projects have a huge number of people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like this, it, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t kind of highlight the way science is done</p>
<p>on some of these projects in the best possible way.</p>
<p>But in general, the prizes are great.</p>
<p>But what this kind of teaches me and reminds me</p>
<p>is sometimes in your life, there&rsquo;ll be moments</p>
<p>when the thing that you would really like to do,</p>
<p>society would really like you to do,</p>
<p>is the thing that goes against something you believe in,</p>
<p>whatever that is, some kind of principle.</p>
<p>And standing your ground in the face of that</p>
<p>is something I believe most people will have</p>
<p>a few moments like that in their life,</p>
<p>maybe one moment like that, and you have to do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what integrity is.</p>
<p>So like, it doesn&rsquo;t have to make sense</p>
<p>to the rest of the world, but to stand on that,</p>
<p>like to say no, it&rsquo;s interesting, because I think.</p>
<p>But do you know that he turned down the prize</p>
<p>in service of some principle?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Well, yes, that seems to be the inkling,</p>
<p>but he has never made it super clear.</p>
<p>But the inkling is that he had some problems</p>
<p>with the whole process of mathematics that includes awards,</p>
<p>like this hierarchies and the reputations</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>and individualism that&rsquo;s fundamental to American culture.</p>
<p>He probably, because he visited the United States quite a bit</p>
<p>that he probably, it&rsquo;s all about experiences.</p>
<p>And he may have had some parts of academia,</p>
<p>some pockets of academia can be less than inspiring,</p>
<p>perhaps sometimes, because of the individual egos involved,</p>
<p>not academia, people in general, smart people with egos.</p>
<p>And if you interact with a certain kinds of people,</p>
<p>you can become cynical too easily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those people that I&rsquo;ve been really fortunate</p>
<p>to interact with incredible people at MIT</p>
<p>and academia in general, but I&rsquo;ve met some assholes.</p>
<p>And I tend to just kind of,</p>
<p>when I run into difficult folks,</p>
<p>I just kind of smile and send them all my love</p>
<p>and just kind of go around.</p>
<p>But for others, those experiences can be sticky.</p>
<p>Like they can become cynical about the world</p>
<p>when folks like that exist.</p>
<p>So he may have become a little bit cynical</p>
<p>about the process of science.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it&rsquo;s a good opportunity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s posit that that&rsquo;s his reasoning</p>
<p>because I truly don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting opportunity to go back</p>
<p>to almost the very first thing we talked about,</p>
<p>the idea of the Mathematical Olympiad,</p>
<p>because of course that is,</p>
<p>so the International Mathematical Olympiad</p>
<p>is like a competition for high school students</p>
<p>solving math problems.</p>
<p>And in some sense, it&rsquo;s absolutely false</p>
<p>to the reality of mathematics,</p>
<p>because just as you say,</p>
<p>it is a contest where you win prizes.</p>
<p>The aim is to sort of be faster than other people.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re working on sort of canned problems</p>
<p>that someone already knows the answer to,</p>
<p>like not problems that are unknown.</p>
<p>So, you know, in my own life,</p>
<p>I think when I was in high school,</p>
<p>I was like very motivated by those competitions.</p>
<p>And like, I went to the Math Olympiad and&hellip;</p>
<p>You won it twice and got, I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s something I have to explain to people</p>
<p>because it says, I think it says on Wikipedia</p>
<p>that I won a gold medal.</p>
<p>And in the real Olympics,</p>
<p>they only give one gold medal in each event.</p>
<p>I just have to emphasize</p>
<p>that the International Math Olympiad is not like that.</p>
<p>The gold medals are awarded</p>
<p>to the top 112th of all participants.</p>
<p>So sorry to bust the legend or anything like that.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re an exceptional performer</p>
<p>in terms of achieving high scores on the problems</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very difficult.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve achieved a high level of performance on the&hellip;</p>
<p>In this very specialized skill.</p>
<p>And by the way, it was a very Cold War activity.</p>
<p>You know, in 1987, the first year I went,</p>
<p>it was in Havana.</p>
<p>Americans couldn&rsquo;t go to Havana back then.</p>
<p>It was a very complicated process to get there.</p>
<p>And they took the whole American team on a field trip</p>
<p>to the Museum of American Imperialism in Havana</p>
<p>so we could see what America was all about.</p>
<p>How would you recommend a person learn math?</p>
<p>So somebody who&rsquo;s young or somebody my age</p>
<p>or somebody older who&rsquo;ve taken a bunch of math</p>
<p>but wants to rediscover the beauty of math</p>
<p>and maybe integrate it into their work</p>
<p>more solid in the research space and so on.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say about the process of&hellip;</p>
<p>Incorporating mathematical thinking into your life?</p>
<p>I mean, the thing is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in part a journey of self knowledge.</p>
<p>You have to know what&rsquo;s gonna work for you</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna be different for different people.</p>
<p>So there are totally people who at any stage of life</p>
<p>just start reading math textbooks.</p>
<p>That is a thing that you can do</p>
<p>and it works for some people and not for others.</p>
<p>For others, a gateway is, I always recommend</p>
<p>the books of Martin Gardner,</p>
<p>another sort of person we haven&rsquo;t talked about</p>
<p>but who also, like Conway, embodies that spirit of play.</p>
<p>He wrote a column in Scientific American for decades</p>
<p>called Mathematical Recreations</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s such joy in it and such fun.</p>
<p>And these books, the columns are collected into books</p>
<p>and the books are old now</p>
<p>but for each generation of people who discover them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re completely fresh.</p>
<p>And they give a totally different way into the subject</p>
<p>than reading a formal textbook,</p>
<p>which for some people would be the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And working contest style problems too,</p>
<p>those are bound to books,</p>
<p>especially like Russian and Bulgarian problems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s book after book problems from those contexts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna motivate some people.</p>
<p>For some people, it&rsquo;s gonna be like watching</p>
<p>well produced videos, like a totally different format.</p>
<p>Like I feel like I&rsquo;m not answering your question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of saying there&rsquo;s no one answer</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a journey where you figure out</p>
<p>what resonates with you.</p>
<p>For some people, it&rsquo;s the self discovery</p>
<p>is trying to figure out why is it that I wanna know?</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll tell you a story.</p>
<p>Once when I was in grad school,</p>
<p>I was very frustrated with my lack of knowledge</p>
<p>of a lot of things as we all are</p>
<p>because no matter how much we know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know much more and going to grad school</p>
<p>means just coming face to face</p>
<p>with the incredible overflowing vault of your ignorance.</p>
<p>So I told Joe Harris, who was an algebraic geometer,</p>
<p>a professor in my department,</p>
<p>I was like, I really feel like I don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>and I should just take a year of leave</p>
<p>and just read EGA, the holy textbook,</p>
<p>Elements de G√©om√©trie Algebraique,</p>
<p>the Elements of Algebraic Geometry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna, I feel like I don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just gonna sit and read this like 1500 page</p>
<p>many volume book.</p>
<p>And he was like, and Professor Harris was like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really stupid idea.</p>
<p>And I was like, why is that a stupid idea?</p>
<p>Then I would know more algebraic geometry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, because you&rsquo;re not actually gonna do it.</p>
<p>Like you learn.</p>
<p>I mean, he knew me well enough to say like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna learn because you&rsquo;re gonna be working</p>
<p>on a problem and then there&rsquo;s gonna be a fact from EGA</p>
<p>that you need in order to solve your problem</p>
<p>that you wanna solve and that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re gonna learn it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna learn it without a problem</p>
<p>to bring you into it.</p>
<p>And so for a lot of people, I think if you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand machine learning</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, I can see that there&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>some mathematical technology that I don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>I think you like let that problem</p>
<p>that you actually care about drive your learning.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing I&rsquo;ve learned from advising students,</p>
<p>math is really hard.</p>
<p>In fact, anything that you do right is hard.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s hard, like you might sort of have some idea</p>
<p>that somebody else gives you, oh, I should learn X, Y and Z.</p>
<p>Well, if you don&rsquo;t actually care, you&rsquo;re not gonna do it.</p>
<p>You might feel like you should,</p>
<p>maybe somebody told you you should,</p>
<p>but I think you have to hook it to something</p>
<p>that you actually care about.</p>
<p>So for a lot of people, that&rsquo;s the way in.</p>
<p>You have an engineering problem you&rsquo;re trying to handle,</p>
<p>you have a physics problem you&rsquo;re trying to handle,</p>
<p>you have a machine learning problem you&rsquo;re trying to handle.</p>
<p>Let that not a kind of abstract idea</p>
<p>of what the curriculum is, drive your mathematical learning.</p>
<p>And also just as a brief comment that math is hard,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense to which hard is a feature, not a bug,</p>
<p>in the sense that, again,</p>
<p>maybe this is my own learning preference,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a value to fall in love with the process</p>
<p>of doing something hard, overcoming it,</p>
<p>and becoming a better person because of it.</p>
<p>Like I hate running, I hate exercise,</p>
<p>to bring it down to like the simplest hard.</p>
<p>And I enjoy the part once it&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>the person I feel like in the rest of the day</p>
<p>once I&rsquo;ve accomplished it, the actual process,</p>
<p>especially the process of getting started in the initial,</p>
<p>like it really, I don&rsquo;t feel like doing it.</p>
<p>And I really have, the way I feel about running</p>
<p>is the way I feel about really anything difficult</p>
<p>in the intellectual space, especially in mathematics,</p>
<p>but also just something that requires</p>
<p>like holding a bunch of concepts in your mind</p>
<p>with some uncertainty, like where the terminology</p>
<p>or the notation is not very clear.</p>
<p>And so you have to kind of hold all those things together</p>
<p>and like keep pushing forward through the frustration</p>
<p>of really like obviously not understanding certain like</p>
<p>parts of the picture, like your giant missing parts</p>
<p>of the picture and still not giving up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same way I feel about running.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about falling in love</p>
<p>with the feeling of after you went through the journey</p>
<p>of not having a complete picture,</p>
<p>at the end having a complete picture,</p>
<p>and then you get to appreciate the beauty</p>
<p>and just remembering that it sucked for a long time</p>
<p>and how great it felt when you figured it out,</p>
<p>at least at the basic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not sort of research thinking,</p>
<p>because with research, you probably also have to</p>
<p>enjoy the dead ends with learning math</p>
<p>from a textbook or from video.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a nice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you have to enjoy the dead ends,</p>
<p>but I think you have to accept the dead ends.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, enjoy the suffering of it.</p>
<p>So the way I think about it, I do, there&rsquo;s an.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t enjoy the suffering.</p>
<p>It pisses me off.</p>
<p>You have to accept that it&rsquo;s part of the process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to kind of deal with that dead end.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s the ultra marathon runner,</p>
<p>Navy SEAL, David Goggins, who kind of,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a certain philosophy of like,</p>
<p>most people would quit here.</p>
<p>And so if most people would quit here and I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discover something beautiful</p>
<p>that others haven&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>And so like any feeling that really sucks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, most people would just like,</p>
<p>go do something smarter.</p>
<p>And if I stick with this,</p>
<p>I will discover a new garden of fruit trees that I can pick.</p>
<p>Okay, you say that, but like,</p>
<p>what about the guy who like wins</p>
<p>the Nathan&rsquo;s hot dog eating contest every year?</p>
<p>Like when he eats his 35th hot dog,</p>
<p>he like correctly says like,</p>
<p>okay, most people would stop here.</p>
<p>Are you like lauding that he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m gonna eat the 35th hot dog.</p>
<p>I am, I am.</p>
<p>In the long arc of history, that man is onto something.</p>
<p>Which brings up this question.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people today,</p>
<p>thinking about their career, about their life,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in mathematics, poetry,</p>
<p>or hot dog eating contest?</p>
<p>And you know, I have kids,</p>
<p>so this is actually a live issue for me, right?</p>
<p>I actually, it&rsquo;s not a thought experiment.</p>
<p>I actually do have to give advice</p>
<p>to two young people all the time.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t listen, but I still give it.</p>
<p>You know, one thing I often say to students,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve actually said this to my kids yet,</p>
<p>but I say it to students a lot is,</p>
<p>you know, you come to these decision points</p>
<p>and everybody is beset by self doubt, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, not sure like what they&rsquo;re capable of,</p>
<p>like not sure what they really wanna do.</p>
<p>I always, I sort of tell people like,</p>
<p>often when you have a decision to make,</p>
<p>one of the choices is the high self esteem choice.</p>
<p>And I always tell them, make the high self esteem choice.</p>
<p>Make the choice, sort of take yourself out of it</p>
<p>and like, if you didn&rsquo;t have those,</p>
<p>you can probably figure out what the version of you</p>
<p>that feels completely confident would do.</p>
<p>And do that and see what happens.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s often like pretty good advice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Sort of like, you know, like with Sims,</p>
<p>you can create characters.</p>
<p>Create a character of yourself</p>
<p>that lacks all the self doubt.</p>
<p>Right, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean,</p>
<p>I would never say to somebody,</p>
<p>you should just go have high self esteem.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t have doubts.</p>
<p>No, you probably should have doubts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to have them.</p>
<p>But sometimes it&rsquo;s good to act in the way</p>
<p>that the person who didn&rsquo;t have them would act.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really nice way to put it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s like from a third person perspective,</p>
<p>take the part of your brain that wants to do big things.</p>
<p>What would they do?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not afraid to do those things.</p>
<p>What would they do?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a really nice way to formulate it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very practical advice.</p>
<p>You should give it to your kids.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s meaning to any of it</p>
<p>from a mathematical perspective, this life?</p>
<p>If I were to ask you,</p>
<p>we talked about primes, talked about proving stuff.</p>
<p>Can we say, and then the book that God has,</p>
<p>that mathematics allows us to arrive</p>
<p>at something about in that book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly a chapter</p>
<p>on the meaning of life in that book.</p>
<p>Do you think we humans can get to it?</p>
<p>And maybe if you were to write cliff notes,</p>
<p>what do you suspect those cliff notes would say?</p>
<p>I mean, look, the way I feel is that mathematics,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve discussed, it underlies the way we think</p>
<p>about constructing learning machines.</p>
<p>It underlies physics.</p>
<p>It can be used.</p>
<p>I mean, it does all this stuff.</p>
<p>And also you want the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, we already did a lot for you.</p>
<p>Like, ask a rabbi.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I wrote a lot in the last book,</p>
<p>How Not to Be Wrong.</p>
<p>I wrote a lot about Pascal, a fascinating guy who is</p>
<p>a sort of very serious religious mystic,</p>
<p>as well as being an amazing mathematician.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s well known for Pascal&rsquo;s wager.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s probably among all mathematicians.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s best known for this.</p>
<p>Can you actually like apply mathematics</p>
<p>to kind of these transcendent questions?</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting when I really read Pascal</p>
<p>about what he wrote about this,</p>
<p>I started to see that people often think,</p>
<p>oh, this is him saying, I&rsquo;m gonna use mathematics</p>
<p>to sort of show you why you should believe in God.</p>
<p>You know, mathematics has the answer to this question.</p>
<p>But he really doesn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>He almost kind of says the opposite.</p>
<p>If you ask Blaise Pascal, like, why do you believe in God?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be like, oh, cause I met God.</p>
<p>You know, he had this kind of like psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a mystical experience where as he tells it,</p>
<p>he just like directly encountered God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, I guess there&rsquo;s a God, I met him last night.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he believed.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have to do with any kind.</p>
<p>You know, the mathematical argument was like</p>
<p>about certain reasons for behaving in a certain way.</p>
<p>But he basically said, like, look,</p>
<p>like math doesn&rsquo;t tell you that God&rsquo;s there or not.</p>
<p>Like, if God&rsquo;s there, he&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t even.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>So you have mathematics, you have, what do you have?</p>
<p>Like a way to explore the mind, let&rsquo;s say psychedelics.</p>
<p>You have like incredible technology.</p>
<p>You also have love and friendship.</p>
<p>And like, what the hell do you want to know</p>
<p>what the meaning of it all is?</p>
<p>Just enjoy it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it, Jordan.</p>
<p>This was a fascinating conversation.</p>
<p>I really love the way you explore math in your writing.</p>
<p>The willingness to be specific and clear</p>
<p>and actually explore difficult ideas,</p>
<p>but at the same time stepping outside</p>
<p>and figuring out beautiful stuff.</p>
<p>And I love the chart at the opening of your new book</p>
<p>that shows the chaos, the mess that is your mind.</p>
<p>Yes, this is what I was trying to keep in my head</p>
<p>all at once while I was writing.</p>
<p>And I probably should have drawn this picture</p>
<p>earlier in the process.</p>
<p>Maybe it would have made my organization easier.</p>
<p>I actually drew it only at the end.</p>
<p>And many of the things we talked about are on this map.</p>
<p>The connections are yet to be fully dissected, investigated.</p>
<p>And yes, God is in the picture.</p>
<p>Right on the edge, right on the edge, not in the center.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>It is a huge honor that you would waste</p>
<p>your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex.</p>
<p>We went to some amazing places today.</p>
<p>This was really fun.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Jordan Ellenberg.</p>
<p>And thank you to Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist,</p>
<p>and Indeed.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Jordan</p>
<p>in his book, How Not To Be Wrong.</p>
<p>Knowing mathematics is like wearing a pair of X ray specs</p>
<p>that reveal hidden structures underneath the messy</p>
<p>and chaotic surface of the world.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
