    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 23, Tacitus and Germanic Society.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to explore the social, legal, and political culture of the</p>
<p>early Germanic tribes, and I&rsquo;m going to do that by using the writings of the Roman historian</p>
<p>Tacitus, who provided us with the first detailed look at the early Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll continue to explore how certain modern English words developed during this</p>
<p>early Germanic period.</p>
<p>But before I begin, let me remind you that the History of the Alphabet series is still</p>
<p>available through iTunes, Amazon.com, and the website, historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And if any of you have any problems purchasing or downloading the series, just send me a</p>
<p>quick note at kevan at historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And as always, if you have any other questions or comments regarding the podcast, you can</p>
<p>always reach me at the same address.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn to this episode.</p>
<p>And let me begin by noting that I originally intended to discuss the writings of Tacitus</p>
<p>in a single episode.</p>
<p>But as I began putting this episode together, I realized that there was really too much</p>
<p>information for just one episode.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually going to deal with the subject of Germanic culture in two parts.</p>
<p>This episode will focus on the social and political structure of the Germanic tribes</p>
<p>and the nature of Germanic law and punishment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to use Tacitus as a jumping off point for that discussion.</p>
<p>In the next episode, I&rsquo;m going to focus on Germanic religion and mythology, and also</p>
<p>explore the early runic writing system which developed among the Germanic tribes shortly</p>
<p>after Tacitus.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s begin our look at the Germanic tribal culture.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of episodes, I looked at the common Germanic language, which linguists</p>
<p>call Proto-Germanic, or the first Germanic language.</p>
<p>And this early Proto-Germanic period extends from before 500 BC to around the first century</p>
<p>BC.</p>
<p>And during this period, there would have been some linguistic variation among the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes, but it&rsquo;s believed that the language of these tribes was similar enough that we</p>
<p>can think of it as a more or less common language.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re now at the first century of the Common Era, or AD, and I&rsquo;ll just use AD from</p>
<p>now on in this episode.</p>
<p>And at this point, some significant changes were beginning to occur.</p>
<p>From this point forward, the various Germanic tribes began to coalesce into larger and more</p>
<p>distinct tribal units.</p>
<p>And as these larger tribes began to coalesce, they began to develop their own distinct identities</p>
<p>and their own distinct cultures, and increasingly, their own distinct languages.</p>
<p>From these tribal units, we&rsquo;ll start to see the emergence of new tribes with names</p>
<p>that will become synonymous with the fall of the Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Names like the Goths and the Vandals and the Franks, and of course the Angles and the Saxons.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now at a transitional period from the early Common Germanic Era to the later</p>
<p>period of Germanic invasions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to explore this transitional period with the help of the earliest detailed</p>
<p>written account of these early Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And that account comes to us via the Roman historian Tacitus.</p>
<p>At the end of the first century AD, around the year 98, Tacitus compiled a detailed account</p>
<p>of the Germanic people which he called Germania.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s very difficult to explore the history of the early Germanic tribes without</p>
<p>encountering the writings of Tacitus.</p>
<p>And it may be surprising that I&rsquo;ve not discussed Tacitus prior to this point, but that&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to maintain some semblance of a chronological order.</p>
<p>So most of what we&rsquo;ve looked at over the past three episodes predated Tacitus.</p>
<p>And much of that knowledge is based on archaeology and linguistic reconstructions.</p>
<p>But now, at the end of the first century AD, we finally have Tacitus and his detailed</p>
<p>description of the early Germans.</p>
<p>Now since Tacitus&rsquo; Germania is so important to historians, it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>a little bit about it as an historical source.</p>
<p>First, the actual book was lost during the so-called Dark Ages and Middle Ages.</p>
<p>So there was no knowledge of it after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>And this is part of the reason why this period is called the Dark Ages, because so much of</p>
<p>the earlier knowledge of the Romans had disappeared during this period.</p>
<p>And Germania by Tacitus is a very small example of that loss.</p>
<p>But in the year 1455, almost 14 centuries after it was written, a single copy of the</p>
<p>book was discovered in an abbey in modern-day Germany.</p>
<p>And this copy of the book was then taken to Italy where it was examined and studied.</p>
<p>But copies soon made their way back to Central Europe, which was then part of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<p>And it was here that this ancient Roman historical account came to be dissected and analyzed,</p>
<p>almost word by word.</p>
<p>Up to that point in history, there really wasn&rsquo;t a common Germanic identity.</p>
<p>In fact, the terms German or Germanic weren&rsquo;t even in common use at the time.</p>
<p>But it was the fascination with Tacitus&rsquo; history which led many scholars in Central</p>
<p>Europe to begin studying the so-called Germanic people.</p>
<p>And in an earlier episode, I mentioned how the invasion of this region by Napoleon in</p>
<p>the 1800s really kick-started the study of Germanic culture and identity among the people</p>
<p>of the region.</p>
<p>But at least among scholars and academics, the study of German culture really began a</p>
<p>couple of centuries earlier with the discovery of this book by Tacitus.</p>
<p>Now the discovery of Germania was both a blessing and a curse for historians.</p>
<p>It was an obvious blessing in the sense that it provided a detailed account of the ancient</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And that was important because virtually nothing was known about these ancient Germans during</p>
<p>this period in the late Middle Ages.</p>
<p>So you can imagine why Central European historians were so fascinated by this book.</p>
<p>But it was also a curse in the sense that it was carefully parsed and analyzed.</p>
<p>And it was assumed by many to be an accurate description of these people.</p>
<p>But we now know that there are some elements of the work that have to be read with a lot</p>
<p>of skepticism.</p>
<p>First, it isn&rsquo;t clear if Tacitus ever actually traveled to the region.</p>
<p>Some modern historians are convinced that he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It appears that one of his primary sources of information was a history of the Roman</p>
<p>Wars in Germania written by Pliny the Elder about 40 years earlier.</p>
<p>Tacitus also apparently relied on information from traders and merchants and other people</p>
<p>who had traveled into the region.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very likely that everything he wrote was based on the second-hand accounts of others.</p>
<p>The other problem is that Tacitus was motivated by a desire to criticize what he considered</p>
<p>to be the corrupt and decadent lifestyle of the Romans of his day.</p>
<p>So he tended to play up certain features of the Germans, like their monogamy and their</p>
<p>chastity.</p>
<p>He considered them to be simple people, but in a positive sense, in the sense that they</p>
<p>were pure and moral people.</p>
<p>He described them as very brave warriors.</p>
<p>And he gave us the very unfortunate phrase, pure blood, to describe the Germans.</p>
<p>And now you can probably see the curse of Germania.</p>
<p>Some of the history is questionable because we don&rsquo;t know how much was based on actual</p>
<p>accounts and how much was made up or exaggerated by Tacitus to make some larger point about</p>
<p>Roman society.</p>
<p>And because he was inclined to emphasize the morality and purity of these people, well,</p>
<p>you can see how that got twisted by German nationalists in the 19th and 20th centuries</p>
<p>who were looking to prove that the German people were part of some ideal master race.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding the problems with Germania, it remains an essential source for the study</p>
<p>of the early Germanic tribes, if for no other reason than it&rsquo;s the only detailed account</p>
<p>we have from this time period.</p>
<p>So with that very broad disclaimer out of the way, let&rsquo;s take a look at what Tacitus</p>
<p>had to say about these tribes.</p>
<p>Let me begin by noting that I&rsquo;m not going to explore every aspect of the book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to make note of some of the information which is relevant to our story</p>
<p>of the Germanic tribes and their language.</p>
<p>The first thing to note about Germania is how short it is.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s been read and parsed and dissected so much through the years, it&rsquo;s easy to get</p>
<p>the impression that it&rsquo;s some massive work of literature.</p>
<p>In reality, it&rsquo;s not that big at all.</p>
<p>My standard paperback version is only about 25 pages long.</p>
<p>So again, you can see why every word has been dissected by scholars over the years.</p>
<p>There just isn&rsquo;t a whole lot there.</p>
<p>But it is much more than we have from any other source.</p>
<p>So as we look at the book, let&rsquo;s begin at the beginning.</p>
<p>Tacitus begins by describing the general location of the tribes in northern Europe.</p>
<p>And he does this initially by describing three separate groupings of tribes, which</p>
<p>he says were descended from three sons of an ancient god.</p>
<p>One group were called the Ingvionis.</p>
<p>And this group was located in the north, along the North Sea.</p>
<p>Another group was called the Istvionis.</p>
<p>And this group was the westernmost group and were located near the Rhine.</p>
<p>And a third group was called the Irminonis.</p>
<p>And this group was located eastward along the river Elbe.</p>
<p>He later described the individual tribes of these regions, which make up these three groupings.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not entirely clear why he used this initial grouping into three parts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tendency to assume that he was referring to the ultimate division of the</p>
<p>Germanic tribes into the North Germanic tribes, the West Germanic tribes, and the East Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>But modern historians don&rsquo;t think that was the case.</p>
<p>It actually appears that the three groupings mentioned by Tacitus were all part of what</p>
<p>we know today as the Western Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve mentioned previously, the North Germanic tribes in Scandinavia and Denmark</p>
<p>ultimately produced the Vikings and their Old Norse language.</p>
<p>And that language eventually evolved into the modern Scandinavian languages.</p>
<p>And the Eastern Germanic tribes migrated southeastward.</p>
<p>Some of those tribes eventually reached the Black Sea region.</p>
<p>And these easternmost tribes remained migratory and played a large role in the fall of the</p>
<p>Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>But then we have those West Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And those are particularly important to us because they included the Angles and the Saxons</p>
<p>and the Jutes and the Frisians, among many others.</p>
<p>Now given that these tribes were located in central Europe, generally east of the Rhine,</p>
<p>they were the ones located closest to the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>And so they were the ones who the Romans encountered and traded with the most.</p>
<p>And since Tacitus&rsquo; description was based on second- and third-hand accounts of Romans</p>
<p>who traveled into the region, it was mostly these Western Germanic tribes who were included</p>
<p>in the description set forth in Germanium.</p>
<p>And it appears that the three basic groupings of tribes described by Tacitus were three</p>
<p>separate portions of these Western Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>Tacitus says that the Ingvionis were located in the north, along the North Sea.</p>
<p>And this particular group is of the most importance to us because it appears that this group included</p>
<p>the tribes which would become known as the Frisians, the Angles, the Saxons, and the</p>
<p>Jutes.</p>
<p>In other words, the tribes which were the source of the later migrations to the British</p>
<p>Isles and which were therefore the ultimate source of the English language.</p>
<p>Again, these tribes were located in the North Sea region, around Denmark and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The second group mentioned by Tacitus, the Istvionis, were the westernmost group of Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>This group was located near and around the Rhine itself.</p>
<p>And this group apparently included the tribes which would later become known as the Franks.</p>
<p>And the Franks are indirectly important to our story because the Franks eventually conquered</p>
<p>the territory of Gaul after the Roman Empire in the West collapsed.</p>
<p>The Frankish kingdom which emerged produced leaders like Charlemagne.</p>
<p>And more importantly for our story, it produced the later nation-state of France, which is</p>
<p>named after the Franks.</p>
<p>And of course, the history of France and the French language is intertwined with the history</p>
<p>of England and the English language.</p>
<p>But during the time of Tacitus, the ancestors of the Franks lived to the south and west</p>
<p>of the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians.</p>
<p>And they lived along the Rhine.</p>
<p>The old Frankish language eventually died out in France where Latin remained the dominant</p>
<p>language and it eventually evolved into the old French language.</p>
<p>But the Frankish language actually survived east of the Rhine in the Germanic regions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the ultimate ancestor of modern Dutch, as well as Flemish, which is spoken</p>
<p>in Flanders in northern Belgium.</p>
<p>Because the Franks were basically southwestern neighbors of the Angles and Saxons in northern</p>
<p>Europe, their language was actually very similar to the language of the Angles and Saxons.</p>
<p>And even today, Dutch is one of the closest languages to English, at least old English.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the ancestral speakers of those languages were basically neighbors</p>
<p>in this part of northern Europe.</p>
<p>Now Tacitus also identified that third group of Germanic people called the Irminones.</p>
<p>This group was located just to the east of the group which I just mentioned.</p>
<p>And this third group was located along the river Elbe, so that puts them in the middle</p>
<p>between the Rhine in the west and the eastern Germanic tribes further to the east.</p>
<p>This third group probably included tribes such as the Alamanni, the Longobardi, and</p>
<p>the Marcomanni.</p>
<p>In later years, these tribes migrated southward, displacing Celtic groups and eventually settling</p>
<p>in southern Germany and northern Italy.</p>
<p>That means that they eventually settled in the heart of modern Germany.</p>
<p>And these are believed to be the ancestors of the modern German speakers in the highlands</p>
<p>of southern Germany.</p>
<p>One of these tribes, the Longobardi, eventually settled in northern Italy and established</p>
<p>an independent kingdom there after the Roman Empire collapsed.</p>
<p>And this is the ultimate source of the modern Lombardy region of northern Italy.</p>
<p>Of course, their language eventually gave way to Italian just as the Frankish language</p>
<p>gave way to Old French.</p>
<p>So many of these ancient Germanic languages died out and were replaced by local Romance</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>But the Alamanni and the Marcomanni retained their Germanic languages, and those languages</p>
<p>formed the basis of modern Alamannic and Bavarian dialects in modern German.</p>
<p>So the point of all this was to help you see how interconnected all of the western Germanic</p>
<p>dialects are, and to make the point that the linguistic ancestors of modern English,</p>
<p>modern Dutch, and modern German were all living next to each other in northern Europe around</p>
<p>the time of Tacitus in 98 AD.</p>
<p>So around the time of Tacitus, the northern areas of the Rhine were heavily Germanic,</p>
<p>but the southern areas were still a mixture of Germanic, Celtic, and perhaps even other</p>
<p>tribal groups.</p>
<p>But over the next couple of centuries, the migration of Germanic tribes southwards would</p>
<p>continue, and eventually all of this region would be occupied by Germanic-speaking tribes.</p>
<p>And Tacitus actually discusses this issue a little later in Germania, so I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>more to say about the interaction of Germans and Celts in these regions in the next episode.</p>
<p>Now before we leave the discussion of Tacitus&rsquo; division of these early Germanic tribes, let</p>
<p>me make a quick note about linguistics.</p>
<p>We know that the north Germanic tribes gave us Old Norse and the modern Scandinavian languages.</p>
<p>And we know that the east Germanic tribes gave us the Gothic language and the languages</p>
<p>of other tribes from that region, which were never written down and which have long since</p>
<p>died out.</p>
<p>And we now have Tacitus telling us that the west Germanic tribes were divided into these</p>
<p>three groups.</p>
<p>But at this early point, during the first century AD, the language of these west German</p>
<p>tribes was probably still a more or less common language.</p>
<p>Linguistic differences were probably starting to emerge between the northern tribes and</p>
<p>the eastern tribes and the western tribes.</p>
<p>But among the various western tribes, the language or dialects were still very, very</p>
<p>similar and those west Germanic peoples could probably communicate with each other without</p>
<p>any problems at all.</p>
<p>It may have been similar to modern differences between the various regional dialects of English.</p>
<p>Some are more distinct than others, but communication between the dialects is not typically a problem.</p>
<p>But if a west Germanic speaker had encountered an east German Gothic speaker, then communication</p>
<p>may have been a little more difficult.</p>
<p>But even so, the regional differences would have been small enough at this early point</p>
<p>that east German Goths and west German Saxons could probably communicate with each other</p>
<p>without too much difficulty.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re nearing the end of the original common proto-Germanic language, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to see regional differences emerge.</p>
<p>But the precise nature of those differences and the overall extent of those differences</p>
<p>is difficult to pinpoint with any certainty during the time of Tacitus.</p>
<p>Now Tacitus also tells us in this same early chapter of Germania that the Germans of this</p>
<p>region were indigenous or native to the region.</p>
<p>And part of his evidence to support this claim is that the region was so uninviting.</p>
<p>He writes,</p>
<p>Who would have left Asia, or Africa, or Italy, and sought Germany, which is rough in terrain,</p>
<p>bitter in climate, gloomy to live in and to see, unless it be one&rsquo;s native land?</p>
<p>Well, fortunately, modern scholars use more precise techniques to determine such things.</p>
<p>But this description of Germania reflects the common Roman attitude at the time.</p>
<p>This was barbarian territory.</p>
<p>It was harsh, cold, and dangerous.</p>
<p>And it was a region that Rome had been unable to conquer.</p>
<p>So it had to be especially harsh and dark and dangerous if even the mighty Romans couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tame it.</p>
<p>And again, Tacitus gives us the same view right at the beginning of the book.</p>
<p>Now shortly after introducing the three groupings of tribes, Tacitus makes one of the most controversial</p>
<p>and unfortunate statements in the book.</p>
<p>He writes,</p>
<p>I personally incline to the views of those who think that the peoples of Germany have</p>
<p>not been polluted by any marriages with other tribes, and that they have existed as a particular</p>
<p>people pure and only like themselves.</p>
<p>As a result, they all have the same bodily appearance, as far as is possible in so large</p>
<p>a number of men.</p>
<p>Fiery blue eyes, red hair, large bodies, which are strong only for violent exertion.</p>
<p>And there you have it.</p>
<p>That is probably the first written notion that the Germans were a pure race of people</p>
<p>with blue eyes and interestingly red hair.</p>
<p>And again, you can see how these words were interpreted and twisted by later Germans after</p>
<p>this book was discovered and read in the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>
<p>Suddenly a group of people who had no real national identity had this book and these</p>
<p>words from Tacitus.</p>
<p>And when these notions of purity were combined with the early evolutionary theories of Charles</p>
<p>Darwin and the early linguistic research of Jacob Grimm and others who spoke of an ancient</p>
<p>dominant people called the Aryans, well, you can see how all this got mixed together to</p>
<p>form some notion of pure Germanic Aryan identity.</p>
<p>And I mention this because this is the ultimate historical basis for some of those notions.</p>
<p>As I noted in an earlier episode, it&rsquo;s a warning to those who seek to misuse linguistic</p>
<p>or scientific research to promote some other agenda.</p>
<p>And it also shows the deep historical roots of some of these notions, which still exist</p>
<p>to this day.</p>
<p>And it also shows why later historians have read Tacitus with a much more skeptical eye</p>
<p>than earlier scholars did.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re only a couple of pages into Germania and you can begin to see why we have to be</p>
<p>so careful in interpreting what Tacitus has to tell us.</p>
<p>But from here we get detailed descriptions of the culture and lifestyle of the early</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And for the most part, modern historians believe that these chapters provide a more or less</p>
<p>accurate description of the early Germans.</p>
<p>Most of what he writes seems to be confirmed by the archaeological evidence and by later</p>
<p>accounts from other sources.</p>
<p>He begins by noting the German use of Roman coins and he discusses their interest in certain</p>
<p>precious metals.</p>
<p>He writes,</p>
<p>Those nearest our border value gold and silver for commercial purposes and recognize and</p>
<p>prefer certain types of our money.</p>
<p>Those farther away from us make use of barter in a simpler and more ancient manner.</p>
<p>They like money that is ancient and long known, notched silver coins, and coins stamped with</p>
<p>a two-horse chariot.</p>
<p>They favor silver more than gold, not from any predilection, but because the number of</p>
<p>silver coins is easier to use for those who trade in common and cheap items.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s consider what Tacitus tells us about the metals and coins used by the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already discussed in earlier episodes how Germanic tribes near the Roman border</p>
<p>began to trade with the Romans early on, and I noted how Celtic tribes in Britain had begun</p>
<p>to use Roman coins even before the Romans invaded Britain.</p>
<p>The economic power of Rome was so great during this period that even peoples outside of the</p>
<p>empire were using Roman coins for trade and commerce.</p>
<p>And this is supported by the archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>So Tacitus confirms this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that the early Germans didn&rsquo;t really have a preference for gold</p>
<p>over silver.</p>
<p>They actually preferred the small denomination of the silver coins because they could be</p>
<p>used to trade smaller and cheaper items.</p>
<p>I also discussed back in episode 20 how the Roman word for money, which was moneta, was</p>
<p>borrowed by the early Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>The Western Germans took the word as munita, meaning money or coins, which were basically</p>
<p>the same thing at the time.</p>
<p>And this word became minute in Old English, still meaning coins or money.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the Middle English period that the word came to refer to the place where</p>
<p>coins were made, and its pronunciation shifted to mint as we know it today.</p>
<p>And of course, the Norman French brought the Latin word moneta into English a second time</p>
<p>after the Norman invasion, where it ultimately produced the word money in modern English.</p>
<p>And this later word money replaced that earlier Old English word minute as a general word</p>
<p>for currency.</p>
<p>And I also noted that the early trade between the Germans and the Romans resulted in other</p>
<p>words borrowed into the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>Words like chest, dish, cup, kettle, pillow, sack, pepper, butter, cheese, wine, and others.</p>
<p>And even the word cheap originated as an early Germanic borrowing from Latin.</p>
<p>So all those examples I&rsquo;ve given before, but I wanted to mention them again here since</p>
<p>Tastus writes about the early trade between the Romans and the Germans.</p>
<p>Also, since I mentioned the word wine as an early Germanic borrowing from the Romans,</p>
<p>there was one aspect of the borrowing which I didn&rsquo;t mention in the earlier episode,</p>
<p>but which I did discuss in the alphabet series.</p>
<p>So I wanted to mention that here.</p>
<p>We know that the modern English word is wine with a W at the beginning.</p>
<p>And throughout all of the early Germanic dialects and languages, the word also began with a</p>
<p>W sound.</p>
<p>But the modern Italian word is vino with a V at the beginning.</p>
<p>And that word comes from the Latin word venom.</p>
<p>Well, one of the reasons why linguists know that the Latin word for wine was a very early</p>
<p>borrowing by the Germanic tribes, and not a later borrowing, is because the word was</p>
<p>originally pronounced with an initial W sound by the Romans.</p>
<p>It was originally pronounced as weenum in Latin.</p>
<p>The W sound shifted to a V sound in later Latin.</p>
<p>So the fact that the early Germanic dialects had the word wine with an initial W sound</p>
<p>meant that it had been borrowed very early on before that Latin sound shift occurred.</p>
<p>So you can see how linguistic evidence helps us to determine when some of these words were borrowed.</p>
<p>Another example of this same sound shift is the modern English word wall, which was also</p>
<p>borrowed very early on from the Romans.</p>
<p>The later Latin word was volum, but early on it was pronounced as wallum.</p>
<p>So the fact that this word appears with an initial W in the Germanic languages, but a</p>
<p>V in Latin, is a sign that the word was borrowed early on before the sound change occurred.</p>
<p>By the way, the word wall was borrowed by those neighboring tribes along the Rhine that</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier, and the tribes north of there who were the ancestors of the Franks</p>
<p>and the Saxons and the Frisians and the Angles, because the word has a W sound in all of those</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>But the version of the word in the Scandinavian languages begins with a V sound.</p>
<p>And that suggests that the Old Norse speakers, the Vikings and their ancestors, they borrowed</p>
<p>the word at a later date.</p>
<p>In fact, it appears that those tribes borrowed the word from the Low German speakers in northern</p>
<p>Germany who had borrowed the word from Latin at a later date.</p>
<p>So you can actually see how linguistic evidence helps us to determine not only when a word</p>
<p>was borrowed, but it can also help us to determine where the word was borrowed.</p>
<p>Now after talking about Germanic coins, Tacitus discussed the use of iron by the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>He noted that the Germans used iron weapons, but he concluded that iron must not have been</p>
<p>abundant in Germania because the Germans tended to use smaller iron weapons like spears instead</p>
<p>of larger weapons like swords and lances.</p>
<p>Now we know from other evidence that the Germans were using iron weapons and had iron technology.</p>
<p>The use of iron was apparently borrowed from the Celtic tribes who the Germans encountered</p>
<p>to the south.</p>
<p>Remember that the Celts were the first people of Europe to master iron technology.</p>
<p>So some of this technology passed to the Germanic tribes to the north.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, it appears that the Celtic word for iron was borrowed by the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>And this conclusion is based upon the similarity of the words in the Celtic languages and the</p>
<p>Germanic languages.</p>
<p>The Old Irish version is irn and the Welsh version is hern.</p>
<p>The Old English version of the word is eithern and it existed in an almost identical version</p>
<p>in Gothic, Old Norse, Old Saxon, and Old High German.</p>
<p>So the modern English word iron derives from an early Germanic borrowing from the ancient</p>
<p>Celts.</p>
<p>By the way, Latin borrowed an Etruscan word for iron, which became ferrum in Latin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the chemical symbol for iron, Fe, came from.</p>
<p>After discussing the Germanic use of iron weapons, Tacitus turns to the political structure</p>
<p>of the tribes in the next chapter.</p>
<p>He notes that Germanic kings were chosen on the basis of noble birth, and generals were</p>
<p>chosen on the basis of bravery.</p>
<p>He also notes that Germanic kings don&rsquo;t have limitless or arbitrary power.</p>
<p>So it appears that there was some type of check on the king&rsquo;s powers, and there was</p>
<p>some semblance of law which even the kings had to obey.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s consider the Germanic concept of a king.</p>
<p>I mentioned in an earlier episode that the Old English word for king was kining.</p>
<p>And that word was derived from an earlier Germanic word, which was kuning.</p>
<p>Again, this word meant king or ruler from this earlier Germanic period.</p>
<p>Now the Germanic tribes also had a similar word, kunjam, which meant family.</p>
<p>And this word ultimately evolved into the Old English word kin, spelled c-y-n-n.</p>
<p>And we still have this word in Modern English, only now it&rsquo;s spelled k-i-n.</p>
<p>So Germanic kuning and kunjam became Old English kining and kin.</p>
<p>And the point here is that many linguists believe these two words were very closely</p>
<p>related.</p>
<p>They think that the original Germanic word for king was derived from the word for family.</p>
<p>And it basically meant leader of the family or leader of the people.</p>
<p>And even today, the Modern English words king and kin are identical except for that extra</p>
<p>g in the word king.</p>
<p>So this connection tells us a lot about the nature of those original Germanic kings.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t like European kings of the later Middle Ages with divine right and unlimited</p>
<p>authority.</p>
<p>They were just leaders of the family or the tribe.</p>
<p>And apparently they were subject to certain rules, just like the rest of the tribe.</p>
<p>And keep this idea in the back of your mind when we get to the Anglo-Saxon rulers of England</p>
<p>and the early Norman and Plantagenet kings of England.</p>
<p>Because the idea that there are certain limitations on the king&rsquo;s powers, as ultimately represented</p>
<p>by the Magna Carta, well, that was a very old idea which the Anglo-Saxons had inherited</p>
<p>from their Germanic roots.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t as common in other parts of Europe.</p>
<p>And that was one of the things which tended to distinguish the English monarchs from other</p>
<p>European monarchs during the Middle Ages and thereafter.</p>
<p>So the Germanic tribes had a word for king that may have been derived from the Germanic</p>
<p>word for family.</p>
<p>But it also appears that they adopted the Celtic word for king as well.</p>
<p>I mentioned in an earlier episode that the Latin word for king was rex and the Celtic</p>
<p>word was rix and both words were derived from an original Indo-European word.</p>
<p>Well, as the Germanic tribes encountered the Celtic tribes, they apparently borrowed the</p>
<p>Celtic version of the word.</p>
<p>The Germanic Goths had the word as rix, meaning ruler.</p>
<p>It also meant powerful in Gothic and it was also borrowed into many of the other early</p>
<p>Germanic dialects meaning powerful as well.</p>
<p>That included Old Norse and Old High German, Old Saxon, Old Frisian, and even Old English.</p>
<p>The Old Saxon version of the word was riki and the Old English version was originally</p>
<p>something like rika.</p>
<p>But in Old English, the k sound became a ch sound in a lot of words.</p>
<p>So Old English had the word as rixa.</p>
<p>And it later evolved into rich in Modern English.</p>
<p>So the Modern English word rich is ultimately derived from a Germanic word meaning powerful,</p>
<p>which was itself borrowed from the Celtic word for king or ruler.</p>
<p>By the way, while the word evolved into rich in Old English, it evolved into reich within</p>
<p>German, meaning the kingdom or state.</p>
<p>So why would the Germanic tribes have borrowed the Celtic word for king or ruler when they</p>
<p>already had their own word, which ultimately became the word king in Modern English?</p>
<p>Well, it may have been because the political structure of the Celtic tribes was different</p>
<p>from the political structure of the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And therefore the Celtic rix held a different status than the Germanic king.</p>
<p>But notice that the Germanic tribes didn&rsquo;t tend to use the Celtic version of the word</p>
<p>as king.</p>
<p>They used it to mean powerful.</p>
<p>So perhaps they just borrowed it as an adjective, meaning powerful, because Celtic kings were</p>
<p>considered to be very powerful.</p>
<p>Now beyond the level of the Germanic king, the overall political structure of the Germans</p>
<p>was very similar to other ancient Indo-European societies.</p>
<p>Of course the king was at the top.</p>
<p>Then below the king was the nobility.</p>
<p>The later English Saxons called this class of nobles the √Üthelings and the Earldomen.</p>
<p>Of course the term earl has survived into Modern English, but √Ütheling largely disappeared</p>
<p>after the Norman conquest of England.</p>
<p>Below the nobles were the freemen.</p>
<p>These people were called carls.</p>
<p>And this word has filtered down to us in Modern English in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>This word ultimately resulted in the pejorative word churl in British English, which meant</p>
<p>a lowly, common, or backwards person.</p>
<p>It also resulted in the Germanic name Carl, which is still a common name in English-speaking</p>
<p>countries.</p>
<p>But interestingly, it&rsquo;s also the root of the name Charles, which is an even more common</p>
<p>name.</p>
<p>During the early Middle Ages, the Germanic Franks conquered Gaul and established the</p>
<p>early Frankish kingdom, which later became France.</p>
<p>One of the early kings was Pepin II, and he had an illegitimate son named Carl, which</p>
<p>may have been a nickname based on the sense of the word Carl as a common man or freeman,</p>
<p>in other words, not a person of noble birth.</p>
<p>And again, this young son Carl was illegitimate, so he wasn&rsquo;t technically of noble birth.</p>
<p>But when Pepin II died, Carl fought Pepin&rsquo;s legitimate son for control of the kingdom.</p>
<p>And young Carl won the war.</p>
<p>He became known as Carl the Hammer.</p>
<p>But over time, in the early French language, a lot of sounds shifted and slurred, and Carl</p>
<p>became Charles, and eventually in English it became Charles.</p>
<p>And we know Charles the Hammer today as Charles Martel, the founder of the Carolingian dynasty</p>
<p>in France.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why that dynasty is called the Carolingian and not the Charalingian dynasty.</p>
<p>It originally stemmed from the Germanic name Carl.</p>
<p>And Charles Martel&rsquo;s grandson was Carl the Great.</p>
<p>Of course, we know him by his French name Charlemagne.</p>
<p>And after Charlemagne, the French version of the name Charles became a common name for</p>
<p>kings in Europe, even though England didn&rsquo;t actually get a King Charles until the 17th</p>
<p>century.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how the word Carl, meaning a common man, became the name of kings in the form</p>
<p>of Charles.</p>
<p>Now going back to the early Germans, the class of people below the Carls were the servant</p>
<p>class, basically serfs or slaves.</p>
<p>The original Germanic word for this class of people led to the later Old Norse term</p>
<p>thrall.</p>
<p>This term was later borrowed by the Anglo-Saxons, and the term thralls came to be used in Old</p>
<p>English as well.</p>
<p>Even though English has lost that term in its original sense, it does survive in the</p>
<p>word enthrall, which means to captivate.</p>
<p>But originally it meant to hold captive in a more literal sense.</p>
<p>The thralls included slaves.</p>
<p>And a person could become a slave as a result of indebtedness.</p>
<p>And the children of slaves also tended to be slaves.</p>
<p>But one of the most common sources of slaves were foreign enemies conquered in a battle</p>
<p>or war.</p>
<p>And in fact, the word slave comes from the word Slav, meaning someone from the Slavic</p>
<p>areas of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>During the later periods of Germanic history, as the Germanic tribes were expanding into</p>
<p>Eastern Europe, they defeated many Slavic tribes in battle.</p>
<p>And the defeated Slavs were taken into captivity by the Germans, and the term Slav came to</p>
<p>be used as the word for a person held in servitude.</p>
<p>The term Slav passed into the common Latin of the Middle Ages and then eventually passed</p>
<p>into English thanks to the Norman French.</p>
<p>So even though the term originated with the Germans, English borrowed it indirectly via</p>
<p>Latin.</p>
<p>By the way, speaking of Latin, it originally used the term service for slave.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the root of the English words serve, servant, and servitude.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s also the root of the word sergeant.</p>
<p>By the Middle Ages, the term had evolved into the word serf in France, and then that</p>
<p>word passed into England after the Norman invasion.</p>
<p>A serf and a slave were very similar, but a serf was tied to the land, and a slave was</p>
<p>tied to a person, the slave&rsquo;s owner.</p>
<p>Latin also had the term conservus, which meant fellow slave.</p>
<p>It passed into French as concierge, which meant doorkeeper, and it&rsquo;s still used in</p>
<p>English.</p>
<p>Also, in Latin, a bought slave was a mancipium, which came from the words manus, meaning hand,</p>
<p>and capera, meaning to take.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the basis of the English words emancipate and emancipation.</p>
<p>A female slave was called an ancilla, which is the basis of the English word ancillary.</p>
<p>So between the Germanic languages and Latin, we get lots of English words from this class</p>
<p>of slaves and servants.</p>
<p>Now beyond the general political classes of people, it&rsquo;s very important to discuss one</p>
<p>of the most important social institutions in ancient Germanic society, and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>sib.</p>
<p>The sib was a group of freeborn people who were related by blood or marriage, so it was</p>
<p>sort of like your extended family.</p>
<p>The name sib derives from the same root as sibling in modern English.</p>
<p>These were family-bound units and were a more basic level within the larger Germanic tribe.</p>
<p>Anyone outside of the sib was a potential enemy.</p>
<p>Now kinship networks were very large and very important in Germanic culture.</p>
<p>It was a source of support and nurturing, but it was also a source of protection.</p>
<p>They served much of the same purpose as the police or courts in Roman and modern societies.</p>
<p>If a person was injured or killed by another person from another sib, the members of the</p>
<p>injured person&rsquo;s sib were expected to avenge the action.</p>
<p>But over time, this type of family feuding could result in a perpetual state of infighting</p>
<p>and warfare.</p>
<p>And in an effort to deal with this potential source of conflict, the Germanic tribes encouraged</p>
<p>cooperation within and among the different sibs.</p>
<p>And they did this through fosterage, which basically meant placing a child from his natural</p>
<p>family into the home of another family, thereby linking the families together.</p>
<p>They also encouraged oath brotherhood between male members of different sibs.</p>
<p>And this basically involved the swearing of oaths between males of different sibs, and</p>
<p>it often included ceremonies involving the mixing of blood, thereby producing blood brotherhood.</p>
<p>But sometimes none of those cooperative efforts worked, and a back-and-forth civil war would</p>
<p>break out within and among the various sibs.</p>
<p>So in an effort to regulate this type of conflict, the Germanic tribes developed the concept</p>
<p>of the Wehrgeld.</p>
<p>And this word literally meant man payment or man money.</p>
<p>You might remember that the Old English word for a male was wehr, as in werewolf, meaning</p>
<p>man-wolf.</p>
<p>Well, we see the same use of the word here as wehrgeld, and the wehrgeld was a payment</p>
<p>required to be made from one sib to another sib if a member of one sib killed or injured</p>
<p>a member of the other sib.</p>
<p>If the payment was not made, the conflict would often escalate into an ongoing bloody</p>
<p>feud between the sibs for many, many generations.</p>
<p>So if a person was killed, his sib would demand the wehrgeld, and the amount of the wehrgeld</p>
<p>depended on the victim&rsquo;s sex and age and social status.</p>
<p>It also varied according to the injury.</p>
<p>Death required a larger payment than a lesser non-life-threatening injury.</p>
<p>If the demanded amount was paid, the matter was resolved.</p>
<p>But if it was not paid, the kinsman or a member of the deceased or injured man&rsquo;s sib could</p>
<p>take retribution against anyone in the other sib.</p>
<p>And this could then trigger a chain reaction between the sibs, and since each sib was often</p>
<p>linked to and aligned with other sibs through various social ties, well, the conflict could</p>
<p>spread to other sibs.</p>
<p>So the wehrgeld was very important to try to ensure the internal stability of the tribe.</p>
<p>But you can also see why these tribes were sometimes unstable over long periods of time.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;re going to see shortly, the tribes which emerged in the history with the fall</p>
<p>of the Western Roman Empire are quite different from many of the tribes described by Tacitus.</p>
<p>So historians believe that these tribes would occasionally break apart and the various factions</p>
<p>would then combine and form new tribes.</p>
<p>And this process ultimately resulted in some of the large Germanic tribes which would later</p>
<p>conquer large portions of Western Europe.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve looked at the social structure of the Germanic tribes, and we looked at how</p>
<p>the sibs tried to resolve conflicts between the various sibs.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the larger issue of Germanic law.</p>
<p>And to do that, let&rsquo;s turn back to Tacitus.</p>
<p>After discussing the Germanic kings, Tacitus discusses Germanic crime and punishment.</p>
<p>He outlines the various punishments for certain crimes.</p>
<p>For example, he notes that traitors and deserters are hanged from trees, and cowards and those</p>
<p>committing incest or homosexuality are drowned in a swamp with a basket put over them.</p>
<p>And he notes that the distinction of punishment reflects a belief that violent crimes should</p>
<p>be displayed while they&rsquo;re being punished, but what he considered disgraceful acts should</p>
<p>be concealed.</p>
<p>Tacitus then notes that certain lesser crimes are punished by requiring the payment of a</p>
<p>fine, typically a certain number of horses or cattle.</p>
<p>Some of this is paid to the king or the state, and some is paid to compensate the wronged</p>
<p>person or their family.</p>
<p>So this reference is probably picking up on the idea of the Wehrgeld, which I discussed</p>
<p>earlier.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a closer look at Germanic law based on this and also other resources which</p>
<p>provide further insight into Germanic legal customs.</p>
<p>Since the early Germans didn&rsquo;t maintain written records, most of the early Germanic law was</p>
<p>based on the oral tradition, which was held in the memory of certain persons who served</p>
<p>as judges.</p>
<p>Established legal precedent was memorized, and it was passed on verbally.</p>
<p>That meant that justice tended to be personal and subjective.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the 5th century, about 300 or 400 years after Tacitus, that writing became</p>
<p>more prevalent among the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And it was also at that point that the various Germanic tribes began to adopt written legal</p>
<p>codes, almost all of them, by the way, written in Latin and based on Roman law.</p>
<p>The lone exception were the laws of the Anglo-Saxons in England in the 7th century, which were written</p>
<p>in Old English.</p>
<p>But during this earlier period, during the time of Tacitus, it appears that the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes were still using the common Germanic legal customs which had been used by the tribes</p>
<p>for centuries.</p>
<p>Criminal cases were tried before the popular assembly of Germans, and this assembly had</p>
<p>different names among the various Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>The Saxons called it the Gemmut, and the Franks called it the Mollus, but the Lombards and</p>
<p>the later Norsemen in Scandinavia called it the Thing.</p>
<p>For the most part, the focus of Germanic law was on compensation of the damaged party,</p>
<p>not revenge or retribution.</p>
<p>And we saw this in the discussion of the Wuergelt.</p>
<p>But for some crimes, compensation couldn&rsquo;t really be paid to resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>So as Tacitus mentioned, traitors and deserters were punished by hanging, and cowards were</p>
<p>drowned.</p>
<p>The assembly, or the Thing, could also prescribe other punishments.</p>
<p>For example, an offender could be deemed an outlaw.</p>
<p>An outlaw was banished from all social systems and ties.</p>
<p>His marriage was dissolved, he was not to be given any hospitality as a guest, and he</p>
<p>could be killed by anyone without penalty.</p>
<p>The term passed into Old English as utlaga, meaning outside of the law.</p>
<p>And the word has evolved over the centuries into its modern version, outlaw, basically</p>
<p>meaning the same thing.</p>
<p>An offender could also be banished from the tribe.</p>
<p>This was very similar to being declared an outlaw, but technically an outlaw could be</p>
<p>killed anywhere.</p>
<p>But a banished person could only be killed if he remained in the territory from which</p>
<p>he was banished, or if he returned to that territory later.</p>
<p>But outside of the banished territory, he couldn&rsquo;t be killed.</p>
<p>Another method of settling issues of guilt or innocence was the ordeal, or ordell in</p>
<p>Old English.</p>
<p>The term meant trial by physical test.</p>
<p>The ordeal usually involved subjecting the accused person to a painful or life-threatening</p>
<p>test to determine his or her guilt or innocence.</p>
<p>For example, the accused might be required to grasp a bar of red-hot iron, or dip his</p>
<p>hand into a pot of boiling water to retrieve a stone.</p>
<p>If the hand healed properly, he was innocent, but if it didn&rsquo;t, he was guilty.</p>
<p>This type of practice continued into Anglo-Saxon England and even to the Salem witch trials</p>
<p>of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>
<p>During the Salem witch trials, a person accused of being a witch could be lowered into a lake</p>
<p>or body of water which had been purified by blessing.</p>
<p>If the person sank into the water and was consumed by the blessed water, she was innocent.</p>
<p>But if she floated, thus being rejected by the blessed water, she was guilty.</p>
<p>Obviously, being deemed innocent wasn&rsquo;t much consolation for a person who sank into</p>
<p>the water and drowned.</p>
<p>But again, this type of trial, if you want to call it that, was a later version of the</p>
<p>Germanic ordeal, and so it was part of a very long and ancient tradition.</p>
<p>And the Germanic ordeal gave us the modern English word ordeal, meaning a painful or</p>
<p>difficult experience.</p>
<p>So with that, I&rsquo;m going to conclude this look at early Germanic society.</p>
<p>Next time, we&rsquo;ll continue to explore Germanic culture with a look at Germanic religion and</p>
<p>mythology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also look more closely at the runic writing system developed by the early Germans.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll continue to explore the evolution of the original Germanic language into the</p>
<p>various tribal dialects which ultimately produced modern languages like English, German, and</p>
<p>other Northern European languages.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks again for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
