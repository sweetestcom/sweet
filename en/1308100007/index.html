<p>Um, okay, should the pups do the clapping?</p>
<p>Should we fix her hair first?</p>
<p>What is happening to my hair?</p>
<p>Well, fix it!</p>

<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast, starring Mariah Carey.</p>
<p>Pups, what have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with is the Christmas lights going onto your house before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Number one is, if you listen to right-wing media, they claim there is a war on Christmas.</p>
<p>And that is such bullshit.</p>
<p>Christmas won that war.</p>
<p>Welcome to our podcast called I&rsquo;ve Had It, featuring myself, Jennifer, and Angie Pumps.</p>
<p>We have fucking had it with the imaginary war on Christmas that Christmas clearly won</p>
<p>2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Something that goes along with Thanksgiving and Christmas is travel.</p>
<p>Jen and Millie, you two motherfuckers cuddle on a plane, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What if you&rsquo;re sitting on a plane next to each other, it&rsquo;s five hours, and you want</p>
<p>to put your head on someone&rsquo;s shoulder and nuzzle in?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s define this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a lean-in is a cuddle.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m down with a lean-in.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s a cuddle to you, though?</p>
<p>A cuddle would be like you got arms together, legs pretzeling.</p>
<p>Who can pretzel on a plane?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen crazy people do it.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something that&rsquo;s really got me all worked up.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;ve completely had it with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the abuse going on on the escalators.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what&rsquo;s going on on the escalators.</p>
<p>So, I think there is an unspoken rule of common sense that mirrors the way we drive.</p>
<p>That you ride on the right and you pass on the left.</p>
<p>Every time I&rsquo;m in an airport, and I figure I&rsquo;m on this staircase, I might as well walk</p>
<p>and just burn that many more calories.</p>
<p>The person ahead of me has made that decision for me by parking out their fucking suitcase</p>
<p>right next to them with their goddamn big cup and straw on top of that.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something else that bugs the shit out of me when I travel.</p>
<p>So, we went to Machu Picchu, right?</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s this one money shot.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s kind of waiting in line to get to this spot.</p>
<p>And then there are the spot abusers, okay?</p>
<p>That start to put on a full 15-minute photo shoot.</p>
<p>They lack the self-awareness of the people around them.</p>
<p>All we wanted to do, Welch, family, party of four, hop in, smile, thumbs up,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at Machu Picchu, and then get the fuck out.</p>
<p>But we have to wait on these grandstanders, influencers,</p>
<p>that are doing a 20-part photo shoot, and it&rsquo;s a huge problem.</p>
<p>So, on today&rsquo;s episode, we have a guest, and her name is Becca,</p>
<p>and she is one-third of the podcast sensation, The Lady Gang.</p>
<p>And she obviously travels a lot, and so she has a lot to weigh in on</p>
<p>that is the horror that has become travel.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s particularly upset about what people are wearing and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>And, I mean, there&rsquo;s nothing I love more than airing grievances</p>
<p>with somebody who&rsquo;s just right with us.</p>
<p>So, I think we&rsquo;re going to drag out this horse and beat it with Becca.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get Becca on.</p>
<p>Hi, Becca. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>You guys, I am so sorry.</p>
<p>Ever since I had a fucking baby, I cannot keep my schedule in line,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>I have to ask, how old is your child?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s nine months old.</p>
<p>Oh, golly, you&rsquo;re in the weeds, man.</p>
<p>Guys, I just spent four days during Thanksgiving keeping my kid away from an open fireplace.</p>
<p>Like, shoot me in the face.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re in what Poms and I refer to as the kid jail phase.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Where you are in jail with your kid, and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>You are in kid jail.</p>
<p>And when your kid gets old enough to go to school,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some day they don&rsquo;t go to school, like President&rsquo;s Day or something,</p>
<p>or Martin Luther King Day, it is the biggest dick over on the planet</p>
<p>because all you want to do is take the child, drop them off.</p>
<p>And we used to smoke cigarettes together all the time.</p>
<p>Both of us have quit, but we used to go drop the kids off,</p>
<p>and she would say, I&rsquo;m coming to your front porch, let&rsquo;s burn.</p>
<p>And we would just, I mean, one after another after another.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the phase also with Christmas tree.</p>
<p>Like, do you put up a tree because you know they&rsquo;re going to be all into it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not even doing the Christmas tree for that reason.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m not spending my days grabbing his little leg</p>
<p>and yanking him from underneath the Christmas tree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>I just put a little bitty tiny fake one on the table one year.</p>
<p>So, Becca is joining us today because she has had it with something that I think is universal.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>We need to drag out this dead horse and beat the ever living shit out of it.</p>
<p>And it is the misery of traveling with all of these fuckers in the airport.</p>
<p>So, Becca, let us know, what is your number one out of all of the pet peeves?</p>
<p>What is your number one pet peeve of traveling?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the attire that people are wearing.</p>
<p>And specifically, I don&rsquo;t want to see a man&rsquo;s toes.</p>
<p>Really ever.</p>
<p>But certainly not on an airplane.</p>
<p>Not if they&rsquo;re fetish girls.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to see your personal blanket or pillow on that airplane.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s revolting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve put your crusty face on that pillow every night.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re never clean looking.</p>
<p>And that throw pillow has cat hair, dog hair.</p>
<p>Just grime from your house.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to bring that onto the plane and make me sit next to you</p>
<p>as you rest your little crusty pillow against the window and make me watch you do that?</p>
<p>I want to circle back to the attire.</p>
<p>Because this is something that I totally agree with you on.</p>
<p>And we go to Europe, our family goes to Europe every summer.</p>
<p>In Europe, the people in airports are dressed really well.</p>
<p>They look good.</p>
<p>They look sharp.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, I like this.</p>
<p>Everybody looks good.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s traveling.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dressed for the occasion.</p>
<p>You land in the United States of America and it is a God damn dump truck.</p>
<p>It is just everybody is like in these cutoffs and these just big baggy T-shirts,</p>
<p>trucker&rsquo;s hats, you know, dorky socks pulled up.</p>
<p>And my son, Roman, he was like, God, Mom, I mean, Americans just don&rsquo;t dress well.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I know.</p>
<p>Because you can do like athleisure chic on a plane.</p>
<p>You can pull together.</p>
<p>You can look comfy and cute.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s chaos with the attire at the airport.</p>
<p>And, again, there&rsquo;s no oversight.</p>
<p>There was a man standing in front of me to board, dare I say, a Southwest flight.</p>
<p>I will say that&rsquo;s the worst dressed list.</p>
<p>And he was in the thinnest, oldest, I don&rsquo;t even ‚Äì sweat pant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think ‚Äì pajama meets sweat pant hybrid.</p>
<p>And I could see a full outline of his cock and balls.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I like to call the sport package.</p>
<p>But just from head to toe, you could tell he rolled out of bed.</p>
<p>Listen, I don&rsquo;t think you ‚Äì I love a regular shower.</p>
<p>I just got out of one.</p>
<p>I love a night shower.</p>
<p>I love a morning shower.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re busy.</p>
<p>You have kids.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I want you to at least try to fake it that you took a shower this morning.</p>
<p>Try to fake it.</p>
<p>Do a hooker bath at the bare minimum.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whatever it takes.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just so inconsiderate that I&rsquo;m going to now have to sit next to your crusty toenails</p>
<p>and your greasy hair for three hours on Southwest.</p>
<p>So on Southwest, here&rsquo;s one of my biggest pet peeves that I have absolutely fucking had it with.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the comedy routine put on by the flight attendant.</p>
<p>And every time they do it, everybody kind of dorky laughs,</p>
<p>and I literally want to stand up and scream,</p>
<p>put a sock in it and get us from point A to B.</p>
<p>I have had it.</p>
<p>I am not at a comedy show.</p>
<p>Serve the drink, throw the peanuts,</p>
<p>sit down and shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d honestly rather them be mean to me than put on the comedy routine.</p>
<p>The comedy bums me out as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terribly cheesy jokes, but I will one-up you.</p>
<p>A friend of mine was just on ‚Äì my other podcast host was on a Southwest flight,</p>
<p>and they were getting off the plane,</p>
<p>and the Southwest flight attendant hugged every single person goodbye.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Barney the dinosaur.</p>
<p>I mean, I have had it with that.</p>
<p>I mean, that is so over the top, especially post-COVID.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was going to say.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>One great thing that came out of COVID is we don&rsquo;t have to touch each other as much.</p>
<p>I appreciate we don&rsquo;t have to hug all the time, you know?</p>
<p>What about the applause at landing when everybody starts clapping when the plane lands?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s my problem with that, Becca.</p>
<p>Why are we rewarding people for doing their job?</p>
<p>Why are we clapping for a pilot for landing the fucking plane?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their job.</p>
<p>Well, because in America, it&rsquo;s hard to get people to just do the bare minimum.</p>
<p>I actually do sometimes want to clap.</p>
<p>If I call in a takeout order and it&rsquo;s complicated,</p>
<p>I do feel an overwhelming excitement when they repeat back to me and they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s what it is, is that everybody&rsquo;s so mediocre at their jobs.</p>
<p>I agree with the clapping on a plane.</p>
<p>There was once a meme that was like, you&rsquo;ve met the man of your dreams.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s rich.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a huge penis, but he claps when they land the plane.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Do you travel with your podcast co-hosts?</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>All three of you on the same plane at the same time.</p>
<p>And would you say that they&rsquo;re good travelers?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s three girls.</p>
<p>Kelty, we made fun of her for the first two years of this podcast</p>
<p>because anywhere we flew, we would fly American</p>
<p>because she was part of the Admirals Club</p>
<p>and they have one other name for their stupid status.</p>
<p>Advantage.</p>
<p>Advantage.</p>
<p>And then some other, again, some really crazy thing</p>
<p>that you have to be selected for.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to‚Ä¶</p>
<p>You have to spend the amount of money and get the miles,</p>
<p>and then you also have to be selected, some stupid thing.</p>
<p>And so every time we would get on a plane, she would get upgraded</p>
<p>and just really, that really chapped our asses</p>
<p>because she was in the front.</p>
<p>So she was really entitled for a while.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>The other one is sometimes I have to give her a talking to</p>
<p>because another thing I hate is when girls wear bike shorts on airplanes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big thing now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Millennials and Gen Zers are loving wearing bike shorts.</p>
<p>They do wear bike britches.</p>
<p>Bike britches.</p>
<p>Bike britches.</p>
<p>So Jack is the other girl, and she is always in a crop top,</p>
<p>always in a bike short.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have never once been in an airport and been like,</p>
<p>you know what I wish?</p>
<p>I wish I was showing more skin.</p>
<p>Just there&rsquo;s no environment that I feel like I want to be looked at less in</p>
<p>than an airport.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you about my traveling companion, Pumps.</p>
<p>For some reason, the people in my life that I love a lot,</p>
<p>and one is my husband, Josh.</p>
<p>One is her.</p>
<p>They have toddler-like impulses,</p>
<p>and it is a 911 emergency-style situation with both of them.</p>
<p>And I have fucking had it back.</p>
<p>So we just get back from Mexico,</p>
<p>and everywhere she goes she has to take all of these beverages,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s spilling them on people.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s slinging bras off.</p>
<p>Then as soon as we get on the plane, she&rsquo;s got to pee again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s non-stop.</p>
<p>My husband&rsquo;s the same way.</p>
<p>With Pumps and Josh, it&rsquo;s like, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at a Hardee&rsquo;s today.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever taken a shit in a Hardee&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This is going to be an opportunity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t do it on planes.</p>
<p>You would.</p>
<p>I mean, if I had to, I would.</p>
<p>In a heartbeat.</p>
<p>You took a shit in a cup on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>I know I did.</p>
<p>She did.</p>
<p>Do we have to talk about it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>No, it happened, I think, after that.</p>
<p>Okay, because I feel like I&rsquo;ve seen an episode of something.</p>
<p>Was it me?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was her.</p>
<p>Oh, it was me.</p>
<p>Look, she doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>We toured on a tour bus for our most recent book tour for the podcast,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t take a poop on a bus.</p>
<p>You have to ask the bus driver to pull over.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll drive all night long.</p>
<p>You can pee.</p>
<p>You can brush your teeth.</p>
<p>You can shower, but you cannot take a shit in that toilet.</p>
<p>So I thought for sure I was the one with digestive issues that I would be</p>
<p>needing a toilet.</p>
<p>So it happens that Kelthy, my partner, did end up shitting herself on the bus.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s ‚Äì I mean, in the moment, it&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s like a war story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humbling, but it&rsquo;s a badge of honor, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Thank you, Becca.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a war story.</p>
<p>So Josh and I, every year we go to the Rosewood Mayakoba for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>And this is probably 10 years ago.</p>
<p>It was the first time everybody started talking about the supermoon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the supermoon, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>So we take the kids outside.</p>
<p>We see the supermoon.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert, it looks like the normal moon.</p>
<p>And we go to bed, and about three hours into sleeping,</p>
<p>I hear this,</p>
<p>Jennifer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, wake up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah?</p>
<p>And he goes, there&rsquo;s been an explosion.</p>
<p>I immediately abort out of the bed.</p>
<p>And he goes, will you help me clean it up?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re on your own.</p>
<p>I go and crawl in bed with my sons.</p>
<p>Josh proceeds to take all the sheets off, gives them to housekeeping,</p>
<p>and blames it on Roman, who at the time is five years old.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I cannot believe that you shit the bed</p>
<p>and blamed it on somebody in fucking kindergarten.</p>
<p>That is a new low, even for you.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to shit the bed, own it.</p>
<p>I shit the bed.</p>
<p>Fuck that.</p>
<p>Becca, we were talking before you got here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so impressed that you have more than one friend.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the only friends you have.</p>
<p>You have two.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a lot of friends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really particular with my friends,</p>
<p>and I have friends with annoying habits as well.</p>
<p>So my tolerance is low.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t come to my house and stay more than two nights.</p>
<p>I think that house guests are like leftovers.</p>
<p>After two days, they start to stink.</p>
<p>And I think people in my life are slightly scared of me too,</p>
<p>so that helps with my friendships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a power dynamic that works.</p>
<p>But, yeah, I mean, you guys have a friendship that I&rsquo;m very envious of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only type of female friendship that I want</p>
<p>and that I want to see.</p>
<p>We have obviously been friends for 20 years,</p>
<p>raised our kids together,</p>
<p>and her kids are like my kids and vice versa.</p>
<p>So this is just supernatural for us.</p>
<p>I mean, even I think the first time I met her,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve talked about this in the past,</p>
<p>she had to pull over at a fucking Firestone and take a shit.</p>
<p>And I was nine months pregnant.</p>
<p>She was.</p>
<p>Can you imagine anything worse?</p>
<p>Lied to the worker at the tire shop, lied to him,</p>
<p>and said, oh, I&rsquo;m looking for my mom in here.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the, like, worker stand, and then there&rsquo;s the back.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And she goes and has a Stage 5 blowout.</p>
<p>Pardon the pun.</p>
<p>At the tire store.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I want to ask a few more questions about traveling,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s survey the room here.</p>
<p>When the plane lands, are you a stander or a sitter?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go first.</p>
<p>I think you wait until your row,</p>
<p>and then you stand up in order of row.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in row Z, you&rsquo;re going to wait.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to go through every letter of the goddamn alphabet</p>
<p>before you stand up, even if you&rsquo;re on the aisle.</p>
<p>I have courtesy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Becca?</p>
<p>To go out into the aisle, I do follow the rules,</p>
<p>and I let every row go.</p>
<p>Are you saying that you get out into the aisle,</p>
<p>and you exit, like, before?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so obnoxious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, where the fuck are you going?</p>
<p>Listen, I wait.</p>
<p>The minute that plane lands,</p>
<p>I take my seat belt off against FAA guidelines immediately.</p>
<p>The tires touch, I take the seat belt off.</p>
<p>The minute they hit the brakes and you&rsquo;re waiting on the jet bridge,</p>
<p>I stand up.</p>
<p>If the person next to me doesn&rsquo;t stand up either,</p>
<p>I immediately start judging them,</p>
<p>and I think this lazy motherfucker is just going to sit there.</p>
<p>She bounces out into the middle of the hall</p>
<p>and acts like she&rsquo;s going to unlock the jetway herself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, I&rsquo;m sitting there going,</p>
<p>where the fuck are you going?</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s getting her bag out over people, like, little old people.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>What about chitchat?</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was just going to say.</p>
<p>Becca, we have to have your input.</p>
<p>This is one of my least favorites.</p>
<p>We hate yak mouths.</p>
<p>I hate yak mouths.</p>
<p>I hate yak mouths.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re flying by yourself.</p>
<p>You sit down, and some guy or girl sits down</p>
<p>and immediately starts chitchatting.</p>
<p>How do you feel on the inside,</p>
<p>and how do you act outwardly towards the person?</p>
<p>How I feel on the inside is rage.</p>
<p>Please let this be the last word that you speak to me</p>
<p>forever, until the end of time.</p>
<p>But usually it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So on the outside, I&rsquo;m very pleasant.</p>
<p>I have a really hard time showing people</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m annoyed with them, strangers.</p>
<p>And sometimes I&rsquo;m going to admit this.</p>
<p>Sometimes I give them too much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good with the short, curt answers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like hurting people&rsquo;s feelings.</p>
<p>So I will sometimes talk to a 76-year-old woman</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s telling me that her kids also live in L.A.</p>
<p>and what they do for a living,</p>
<p>and I ask her about her grandchildren.</p>
<p>And I get in.</p>
<p>I get in, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>You go all the way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an enabler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an enabler.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an enabler.</p>
<p>With the Yak Mouse, when I&rsquo;m traveling for work</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m traveling solo,</p>
<p>the earpods have been the biggest gift.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s what I was going to say, though.</p>
<p>There should be like, fasten your seatbelt sign</p>
<p>if your neighbor is wearing earpods.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to chitchat.</p>
<p>People talk to me over my earpods.</p>
<p>Let me ask you guys a question.</p>
<p>This guy I saw like on YouTube or,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, not YouTube, Instagram.</p>
<p>Some guy&rsquo;s sitting next to</p>
<p>Ted Fuckface Cruz on an airplane.</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, could you imagine</p>
<p>that you sit down</p>
<p>and Ted Fuckface Cruz comes and sits down next to you?</p>
<p>What would you do, Becca?</p>
<p>God, I mean.</p>
<p>This flies commercial all the time.</p>
<p>When they come by to take our drink order,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask if they have any margaritas</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re landing in Texas</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a winter storm,</p>
<p>so I know he&rsquo;s going to want to head back to Mexico.</p>
<p>Stay on the plane and head back to Mexico.</p>
<p>That is fantastic.</p>
<p>And flee the problem.</p>
<p>Or I might be like,</p>
<p>Hi, nice to meet you.</p>
<p>My name is Becca Tobin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually giving you a business card</p>
<p>for my abortion speakeasy</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m opening in the basement of my house.</p>
<p>If any of your girlfriends</p>
<p>get knocked up with your disgusting spawn,</p>
<p>here you go.</p>
<p>They can come to me.</p>
<p>Okay, Becca, I have one for you on the bad traveler.</p>
<p>How about the person that you&rsquo;re behind in the security line?</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;ve been in a long security line with that person</p>
<p>and they get up to the security officer.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have their passport or driver&rsquo;s license out.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t find their boarding pass.</p>
<p>They still have their shoes on.</p>
<p>They have holding water in their hand.</p>
<p>I think you should have to go back, get out of line,</p>
<p>and go to the back</p>
<p>every time you&rsquo;re not prepared in security.</p>
<p>I 100% agree.</p>
<p>The reason, I mean,</p>
<p>at this point, if you&rsquo;re not doing clear</p>
<p>and TSA pre-check,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time for you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you fly once every five years.</p>
<p>When the TSA person is screaming,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all screaming at JFK.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, take the water out of your bag.</p>
<p>Take your ID out.</p>
<p>Be ready.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re screaming orders.</p>
<p>And no one is listening.</p>
<p>This is humanity.</p>
<p>If she can do it.</p>
<p>Anybody can do it.</p>
<p>Let me tell you one final thing about pumps</p>
<p>that I think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>So, you know, she quit smoking.</p>
<p>She vapes.</p>
<p>She vapes nonstop.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just constant.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re flying.</p>
<p>And, you know, again, the flight attendants say,</p>
<p>you know, you can&rsquo;t vape on an airplane.</p>
<p>Well, pumps,</p>
<p>keeps her vaping her cleavage.</p>
<p>Which there&rsquo;s a lot of storage space in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely.</p>
<p>She can store a lot of stuff in her cleavage.</p>
<p>Extra purse.</p>
<p>So I look over and she has her boobs kind of hiked up.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You know, with her arms.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s vaping through her cleavage.</p>
<p>And then she kind of sprinkler shoots the vape out.</p>
<p>Like a sprinkler.</p>
<p>Like, no, I take issue with the fact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m such a good vapor on a plane.</p>
<p>When you wear a mask.</p>
<p>Like I was kind of sad.</p>
<p>The mask requirement left because it was just primo vaping.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t spit it out.</p>
<p>I mean, I hold it all the way in.</p>
<p>I can see it.</p>
<p>I can.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I can smell it.</p>
<p>And I can sell it.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I can see the vape.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What is the flavor of the vape?</p>
<p>Strawberry Kiwi.</p>
<p>You want to know something infuriating?</p>
<p>Is that.</p>
<p>My husband in his office.</p>
<p>His home office has a bathroom.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where he does.</p>
<p>You know, number one and number two.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Occasionally I will go in there.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;ll.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just come out of there.</p>
<p>And leaving our nine month old baby with me in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s got to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>And I go in there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t smell number two.</p>
<p>I smell vape.</p>
<p>I smell.</p>
<p>Strawberry shortcake.</p>
<p>Kiwi surprise.</p>
<p>Pastel cartel.</p>
<p>Whatever the fuck it is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like.</p>
<p>Either you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Running away to the bathroom to vape.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re taking a shit and you&rsquo;re vaping at the same time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which one I hate more.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s interesting about the transition.</p>
<p>And from cigarettes to vaping.</p>
<p>Is cigarettes were these manly things.</p>
<p>You had the marble.</p>
<p>He had a horse.</p>
<p>And he was basically riding it bareback.</p>
<p>And he had a hat.</p>
<p>He had a lasso.</p>
<p>And he was this badass motherfucker that smoked cigarettes.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got the vapors.</p>
<p>And he went from like this total manly man thing to do.</p>
<p>To now your husband is hiding in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Vaping strawberry shortcake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how society has just transitioned.</p>
<p>You know from being such hardcore.</p>
<p>The fall of the marble man.</p>
<p>The fall of the marble man.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Kevin Costner.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to see him vaping on that horse.</p>
<p>I want to see him with a dirty ass cigarette.</p>
<p>So Becca what is your stance on emotional support animals.</p>
<p>In an airport and on the plane.</p>
<p>I have to be honest.</p>
<p>I have treated my dogs like children my whole life.</p>
<p>So my ass is chapped.</p>
<p>Now that airlines don&rsquo;t accept emotional support animals.</p>
<p>I am devastated.</p>
<p>And my eight-year-old dog who has traveled her whole life on my lap.</p>
<p>Now is relegated to a bag and a seat in front of me.</p>
<p>And it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s abuse.</p>
<p>I hear your pain.</p>
<p>Becca and I.</p>
<p>I am ridiculed.</p>
<p>And berated and browbeat by my alleged best friend.</p>
<p>All the time because of the way that I treat.</p>
<p>What I perceive as my biological children.</p>
<p>Tubby and Chow Chow.</p>
<p>I treat my dogs better than I treat fucking people.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>I mean I want to treat them better than I treat my children.</p>
<p>My husband.</p>
<p>And most of all you.</p>
<p>Do you now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re allowed to say this on your podcast.</p>
<p>But did you do the service animal thing.</p>
<p>The racket of getting a service animal.</p>
<p>She was the first one in line on the racket service.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re registered.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re registered in the National Service Dog Registry.</p>
<p>I was like I&rsquo;m embarrassed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell people you have diabetes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too embarrassed to say.</p>
<p>She just can&rsquo;t go anywhere without her fucking dog.</p>
<p>And I think that the person that you&rsquo;ve had it with is the asshole that brought a peacock on the plane.</p>
<p>Like people took it too far.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bridge too far.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Everybody brought their little dog.</p>
<p>It had been fine.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we just ask the airlines to just make it specifically.</p>
<p>Dogs are emotional support and every other animal can fuck right off because.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Dogs are like humans.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what anybody says.</p>
<p>They feel deeper than than any other animal.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>But in my mind.</p>
<p>Even when I see cats.</p>
<p>Cat people are going to be very upset with me.</p>
<p>But your cat does not want to go on your fucking vacation with you.</p>
<p>Cats are fucking assholes.</p>
<p>I hate cats.</p>
<p>Cats are assholes.</p>
<p>Cats are on the plane.</p>
<p>Dogs bring complete joy to the majority of civilized people, Angie.</p>
<p>But you know what else.</p>
<p>Her dog farts on the plane the entire time.</p>
<p>It is a problem.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a gas ball.</p>
<p>I have had people text me that she didn&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;re sitting behind she and puppy.</p>
<p>And they have texted me from the plane and said.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>We think Jennifer Welch&rsquo;s dog is farting on the plane.</p>
<p>It smells so bad.</p>
<p>And I have to text back.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his specialty.</p>
<p>Like get ready.</p>
<p>Buckle in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the whole flight.</p>
<p>This is Jennifer&rsquo;s blind spot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mine too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly.</p>
<p>My husband is horrified so many times.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a blind spot.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going nowhere.</p>
<p>Oh, you are so fun, Becca.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much fun.</p>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p>Becca has a great podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super popular that I&rsquo;m sure all of you listen to called The Lady Gang.</p>
<p>I love your show so much.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>I just listened to the.</p>
<p>The sex.</p>
<p>Sex.</p>
<p>Fetish.</p>
<p>Mail order bride.</p>
<p>Mail order bride.</p>
<p>I loved your Burning Man because honestly, Burning Man, it was something that I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>almost talked into so many times.</p>
<p>But after your episode, I was like, fuck.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>See, I am.</p>
<p>So I have so much.</p>
<p>This we are doing.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>We prevented you from going on the worst vacation of your fucking life.</p>
<p>Our producers.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re so sad.</p>
<p>They went and they&rsquo;re big proponents of Burning Man.</p>
<p>So thank you for that, because I could have been in Burning Man next year and it would</p>
<p>have been a real disaster.</p>
<p>You would have hated it.</p>
<p>Hated.</p>
<p>What about that?</p>
<p>I mean, the seven hour exit.</p>
<p>That was the thing.</p>
<p>That was the nail in the coffin for me.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>So thank you for your work.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>We intend to flip a lot of people.</p>
<p>Maybe we could get to like a thousand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I hope after this podcast comes out, I want people to let you know how they&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>to get dressed to get on a plane and they elevated it slightly just because they heard</p>
<p>this podcast.</p>
<p>They put on a sock with a shoe that covers their toes.</p>
<p>I just that&rsquo;s all I ask.</p>
<p>Stop wearing bike britches.</p>
<p>Thank you guys so much for having me.</p>
<p>I love the podcast.</p>
<p>Thank you, Becca.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>She is a ball.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s precious.</p>
<p>Can I go to the bathroom real quick before we.</p>
<p>You just said the word precious.</p>
<p>So I was in London at the Roger Federer Labor Cup when he retired.</p>
<p>And there were these cute little British people and they had like on British flags and they</p>
<p>were all dolled up.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh my gosh, you guys look precious.</p>
<p>And the guy looked at me with his, you know, almost condescending British accent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I haven&rsquo;t been called precious since I was three years old.</p>
<p>I was like, well, Americans kind of use that word as meaning cute.</p>
<p>Like he was like, cute.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I totally like complimented him.</p>
<p>And it turns out I completely offended him on the same trip in London.</p>
<p>We were in London.</p>
<p>We are walking through Hyde Park.</p>
<p>Josh stepped out in the bicycle path and this guy said, watch where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>You fucking cunt.</p>
<p>Josh.</p>
<p>And I immediately thought I didn&rsquo;t think, hey, don&rsquo;t call my man that.</p>
<p>I looked at Josh and God, I love that guy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a problem using cunt.</p>
<p>I reserve that.</p>
<p>For special people.</p>
<p>Special people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only three people that I can get on board that are 100 percent.</p>
<p>Cunts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are any of them in this room?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Winner.</p>
<p>Speaking of, what does that remind you of?</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>Look at the growth.</p>
<p>Pumps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so proud of you.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t take my ears off until after.</p>
<p>How do you know we&rsquo;re finished?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Cunt.</p>
