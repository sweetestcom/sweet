    <p>The following is a conversation with Wojciech Zaremba, cofounder of OpenAI,</p>
<p>which is one of the top organizations in the world doing artificial intelligence</p>
<p>research and development.</p>
<p>Wojciech is the head of language and cogeneration teams, building and doing</p>
<p>research on GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, and GPT 3, and who knows, 4, 5, 6,</p>
<p>and, and, and plus one, and he also previously led OpenAI&rsquo;s robotic efforts.</p>
<p>These are incredibly exciting projects to me that deeply challenge and expand</p>
<p>our understanding of the structure and nature of intelligence.</p>
<p>The 21st century, I think, may very well be remembered for a handful of</p>
<p>revolutionary AI systems and their implementations.</p>
<p>GPT, Codex, and applications of language models and transformers in general</p>
<p>to the language and visual domains may very well be at the core of these AI</p>
<p>systems. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re listed in the description.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation</p>
<p>with Wojciech Zaremba.</p>
<p>You mentioned that Sam Altman asked about the Fermi Paradox, and the people</p>
<p>at OpenAI had really sophisticated, interesting answers, so that&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>knew this is the right team to be working with.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about the Fermi Paradox, about aliens.</p>
<p>Why have we not found overwhelming evidence for aliens visiting Earth?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a conviction in the answer, but rather kind of probabilistic</p>
<p>perspective on what might be, let&rsquo;s say, possible answers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting that the question itself even can touch on the, you</p>
<p>know, your typical question of what&rsquo;s the meaning of life, because if you</p>
<p>assume that, like, we don&rsquo;t see aliens because they destroy themselves, that</p>
<p>kind of upweights the focus on making sure that we won&rsquo;t destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>At the moment, the place where I am actually with my belief, and these</p>
<p>things also change over the time, is I think that we might be alone in</p>
<p>the universe, which actually makes life more, or let&rsquo;s say, consciousness</p>
<p>life, more kind of valuable, and that means that we should more appreciate it.</p>
<p>Have we always been alone?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your intuition about our galaxy, our universe?</p>
<p>Is it just sprinkled with graveyards of intelligent civilizations, or are</p>
<p>we truly, is life, intelligent life, truly unique?</p>
<p>At the moment, my belief that it is unique, but I would say I could also,</p>
<p>you know, there was like some footage released with UFO objects, which makes</p>
<p>me actually doubt my own belief.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can tell you one crazy answer that I have heard.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, apparently, when you look actually at the limits of computation, you</p>
<p>can compute more if the temperature of the universe would drop.</p>
<p>Temperature of the universe would drop down.</p>
<p>So one of the things that aliens might want to do if they are truly optimizing</p>
<p>to maximize amount of compute, which, you know, maybe can lead to, or let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say simulations or so, it&rsquo;s instead of wasting current entropy of the</p>
<p>universe, because, you know, we, by living, we are actually somewhat</p>
<p>wasting entropy, then you can wait for the universe to cool down such that</p>
<p>you have more computation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of a funny answer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I believe in it, but that would be one of the</p>
<p>reasons why you don&rsquo;t see aliens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to some people say that maybe there is not that much</p>
<p>point in actually going to other galaxies if you can go inwards.</p>
<p>So there is no limits of what could be an experience if we could, you</p>
<p>know, connect machines to our brains while there are still some limits</p>
<p>if we want to explore the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, there could be a lot of ways to go inwards too.</p>
<p>Once you figure out some aspect of physics, we haven&rsquo;t figured out yet.</p>
<p>Maybe you can travel to different dimensions.</p>
<p>I mean, travel in three dimensional space may not be the most fun kind of travel.</p>
<p>There may be like just a huge amount of different ways to travel and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t require a spaceship going slowly in 3d space to space time.</p>
<p>It also feels, you know, one of the problems is that speed of light</p>
<p>is low and the universe is vast.</p>
<p>And it seems that actually most likely if we want to travel very far, then</p>
<p>we would, instead of actually sending spaceships with humans that weight a</p>
<p>lot, we would send something similar to what Yuri Miller is working on.</p>
<p>These are like a huge sail, which is at first powered or there is a shot of</p>
<p>laser from an air and it can propel it to quarter of speed of light and sail</p>
<p>itself contains a few grams of equipment.</p>
<p>And that might be the way to actually transport matter through universe.</p>
<p>But then when you think what would it mean for humans, it means that we would</p>
<p>need to actually put their 3d printer and, you know, 3d print the human on</p>
<p>other planet, I don&rsquo;t know, play them YouTube or let&rsquo;s say, or like a 3d</p>
<p>print like huge human right away, or maybe a womb or so, um, yeah.</p>
<p>With our current techniques of archeology, if, if, if a civilization</p>
<p>was born and died, uh, long, long enough ago on earth, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to</p>
<p>tell, and so that makes me really sad.</p>
<p>And so I think about earth in that same way.</p>
<p>How can we leave some remnants if we do destroy ourselves?</p>
<p>How can we leave remnants for aliens in the future to discover?</p>
<p>Like, here&rsquo;s some nice stuff we&rsquo;ve done, like Wikipedia and YouTube.</p>
<p>Do we have it like in a satellite orbiting earth with a hard drive?</p>
<p>Like, how, how do we say, how do we back up human civilization?</p>
<p>Uh, the good parts or all of it is good parts so that, uh, it can be</p>
<p>preserved longer than our bodies can.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s kind of, um, it&rsquo;s a difficult question.</p>
<p>It also requires the difficult acceptance of the fact that we may die.</p>
<p>And if we die, we may die suddenly as a civilization.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see, I think it kind of depends on the cataclysm.</p>
<p>We have observed in other parts of the universe that birds of gamma rays, uh,</p>
<p>these are, uh, high energy, uh, rays of light that actually can</p>
<p>apparently kill entire galaxy.</p>
<p>So there might be actually nothing, even to, nothing to protect us from it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also, and I&rsquo;m looking actually at the past civilizations.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like Aztecs or so they disappear from the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>And one can ask, why is it the case?</p>
<p>And the way I&rsquo;m thinking about it is, you know, that definitely they had some</p>
<p>problem that they couldn&rsquo;t solve and maybe there was a flood and all of a</p>
<p>sudden they couldn&rsquo;t drink, uh, there was no potable water and they all died.</p>
<p>And, um, I think that, uh, so far the best solution to such a problems is I</p>
<p>guess, technology, so, I mean, if they would know that you can just boil</p>
<p>water and then drink it after, then that would save their civilization.</p>
<p>And even now, when we look actually at the current pandemic, it seems</p>
<p>that there, once again, actually science comes to rest.</p>
<p>And somehow science increases size of the action space.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But nature has a vastly larger action space, but still it might be a good thing</p>
<p>for us to keep on increasing action space.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, looking at past civilizations.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But looking at the destruction of human civilization, perhaps expanding the</p>
<p>action space will add, um, actions that are easily acted upon, easily executed</p>
<p>and as a result, destroy us.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see, I was pondering, uh, why actually even, uh, we have</p>
<p>negative impact on the, uh, globe.</p>
<p>Because, you know, if you ask every single individual, they</p>
<p>would like to have clean air.</p>
<p>They would like healthy planet, but somehow it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the case that as a collective, we are not going in this direction.</p>
<p>I think that there exists very powerful system to describe what we value.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s capitalism.</p>
<p>It assigns actually monetary values to various activities.</p>
<p>At the moment, the problem in the current system is that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some things which we value.</p>
<p>There is no cost assigned to it.</p>
<p>So even though we value clean air, or maybe we also, uh, value, uh,</p>
<p>value lack of destruction on, let&rsquo;s say internet or so at the moment, these</p>
<p>quantities, you know, companies, corporations can pollute them, uh, for free.</p>
<p>So in some sense, I wished or like, and that&rsquo;s, I guess, purpose of politics</p>
<p>to, to align the incentive systems.</p>
<p>And we are kind of maybe even moving in this direction.</p>
<p>The first issue is even to be able to measure the things that we value.</p>
<p>Then we can actually assign the monetary value to them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s getting the data and also probably through technology,</p>
<p>enabling people to vote and to move money around in a way that is aligned</p>
<p>with their values, and that&rsquo;s very much a technology question.</p>
<p>So like having one president and Congress and voting that happens every four years</p>
<p>or something like that, that&rsquo;s a very outdated idea that could be some</p>
<p>technological improvements to that kind of idea.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking from time to time about these topics, but it&rsquo;s also feels to me</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a little bit like, uh, it&rsquo;s hard for me to actually make</p>
<p>correct predictions.</p>
<p>What is the appropriate thing to do?</p>
<p>I extremely trust, uh, Sam Altman, our CEO on these topics here, um, like, uh,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more on the side of being, I guess, naive hippie.</p>
<p>That, uh, yeah, that&rsquo;s your life philosophy.</p>
<p>Um, well, like I think self doubt and, uh, I think hippie implies optimism.</p>
<p>Those, those two things are pretty, pretty good way to operate.</p>
<p>I mean, still, it is hard for me to actually understand how the politics</p>
<p>works or like, uh, how this, like, uh, exactly how the things would play out.</p>
<p>And Sam is, uh, really excellent with it.</p>
<p>What do you think is rarest in the universe?</p>
<p>You said we might be alone.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s hardest to build is another engineering way to ask that life,</p>
<p>intelligence or consciousness.</p>
<p>So like you said that we might be alone, which is the thing that&rsquo;s hardest to get</p>
<p>to, is it just the origin of life?</p>
<p>Is it the origin of intelligence?</p>
<p>Is it the origin of consciousness?</p>
<p>So, um, let me at first explain to you my kind of mental model, what I think</p>
<p>is needed for life to appear.</p>
<p>Um, so I imagine that at some point there was this primordial, uh, soup of, uh,</p>
<p>amino acids and maybe some proteins in the ocean and, uh, you know, some</p>
<p>proteins were turning into some other proteins through reaction and, uh, you</p>
<p>can also, uh, you know, you can, you know, you can, you know, you can</p>
<p>and, uh, you can almost think about this, uh, cycle of what, uh, turns into what</p>
<p>as there is a graph essentially describing which substance turns into</p>
<p>some other substance and essentially life means that all of a sudden in the graph</p>
<p>has been created that cycle such that the same thing keeps on happening over</p>
<p>and over again, that&rsquo;s what is needed for life to happen.</p>
<p>And in some sense, you can think almost that you have this gigantic graph and it</p>
<p>needs like a sufficient number of edges for the cycle to appear.</p>
<p>Um, then, um, from perspective of intelligence and consciousness, uh, my</p>
<p>current intuition is that they might be quite intertwined.</p>
<p>First of all, it might not be that it&rsquo;s like a binary thing that you</p>
<p>have intelligence or consciousness.</p>
<p>It seems to be, uh, uh, more, uh, continuous component.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, if we look for instance on the event networks, uh, recognizing</p>
<p>images and people are able to show that the activations of these networks</p>
<p>correlate very strongly, uh, with activations in visual cortex, uh, of</p>
<p>some monkeys, the same seems to be true about language models.</p>
<p>Um, also if you, for instance, um, look, um, if you train agent in, um, 3d</p>
<p>world, um, at first, you know, it, it, it, it barely recognizes what is going</p>
<p>on over the time, it kind of recognizes foreground from a background over the</p>
<p>time, it kind of knows where there is a foot, uh, and it just follows it.</p>
<p>Um, over the time it actually starts having a 3d perception.</p>
<p>So it is possible for instance, to look inside of the head of an agent and ask,</p>
<p>what would it see if it looks to the right?</p>
<p>And the crazy thing is, you know, initially when the agents are barely</p>
<p>trained, that these predictions are pretty bad over the time they become</p>
<p>better and better, you can still see that if you ask what happens when the</p>
<p>head is turned by 360 degrees for some time, they think that the different</p>
<p>thing appears and then at some stage they understand actually that the same</p>
<p>thing supposed to appear.</p>
<p>So they get that understanding of 3d structure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, you know, very likely that they have inside some level of, of like</p>
<p>a symbolic reasoning, like a particular, these symbols for other agents.</p>
<p>So when you look at DOTA agents, they collaborate together and, uh, and, uh,</p>
<p>no, they, they, they, they have some anticipation of, uh, if, if they would</p>
<p>win battle, they have some, some expectations with respect to other</p>
<p>agents.</p>
<p>I might be, you know, too much anthropomorphizing, um, the, the, the,</p>
<p>how the things look, look, look for me, but then the fact that they have a</p>
<p>symbol for other agents, uh, makes me believe that, uh, at some stage as the,</p>
<p>uh, you know, as they are optimizing for skills, they would have also symbol to</p>
<p>describe themselves.</p>
<p>Uh, this is like a very useful symbol to have.</p>
<p>And this particularity, I would call it like a self consciousness or self</p>
<p>awareness, uh, and, uh, still it might be different from the consciousness.</p>
<p>So I guess the, the way how I&rsquo;m understanding the word consciousness,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the experience of drinking a coffee or let&rsquo;s say experience of being</p>
<p>a bat, that&rsquo;s the meaning of the word consciousness.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean to be awake.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, it feels, it might be also somewhat related to memory and</p>
<p>recurrent connections.</p>
<p>So, um, it&rsquo;s kind of like, if you look at anesthetic drugs, they might be, uh,</p>
<p>uh, like, uh, that they essentially, they, they disturb, uh, uh, brainwaves, uh, such</p>
<p>that, um, maybe memories, not, not form.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lessening of consciousness when you do that.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the one way to intuit what is consciousness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also kind of another element here.</p>
<p>It could be that it&rsquo;s, you know, this kind of self awareness</p>
<p>module that you described, plus the actual subjective experience is a</p>
<p>storytelling module that tells us a story about, uh, what we&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>The crazy thing.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, I mean, in meditation, they teach people not to speak</p>
<p>story inside of their head.</p>
<p>And there is also some fraction of population who doesn&rsquo;t have actually</p>
<p>a narrator, I know people who don&rsquo;t have a narrator and, you know, they have</p>
<p>to use external people in order to, um, kind of solve tasks that</p>
<p>require internal narrator.</p>
<p>Um, so it seems that it&rsquo;s possible to have the experience without the talk.</p>
<p>What are we talking about when we talk about the internal narrator?</p>
<p>Is that the voice when you&rsquo;re like, yeah, I thought that that&rsquo;s what you are</p>
<p>referring to while I was referring more on the, like, not an actual voice.</p>
<p>I meant like, there&rsquo;s some kind of like subjective experience feels like it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fundamentally about storytelling to ourselves.</p>
<p>It feels like, like the feeling is a story that is much, uh, much</p>
<p>simpler abstraction than the raw sensory information.</p>
<p>So there feels like it&rsquo;s a very high level of abstraction that, uh, is useful</p>
<p>for me to feel like entity in this world.</p>
<p>M most useful aspect of it is that because I&rsquo;m conscious, I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an intricate connection to me, not wanting to die.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s a useful hack to really prioritize not dying, like those</p>
<p>seem to be somehow connected.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m telling the story of like, it&rsquo;s rich.</p>
<p>He feels like something to be me and the fact that me exists in this world.</p>
<p>I want to preserve me.</p>
<p>And so that makes it a useful agent hack.</p>
<p>So I will just refer maybe to that first part, as you said, about that kind</p>
<p>of story of describing who you are.</p>
<p>Um, I was, uh, thinking about that even, so, you know, obviously I&rsquo;m, I, I like</p>
<p>thinking about consciousness, uh, I like thinking about AI as well, and I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to see analogies of these things in AI, what would it correspond to?</p>
<p>So, um, um, you know, open AI train, uh, uh, a model called GPT, uh, which, uh,</p>
<p>can generate, uh, pretty, I&rsquo;m using texts on arbitrary topic and, um, um, and one</p>
<p>way to control GPT is, uh, by putting into prefix at the beginning of the text, some</p>
<p>information, what would be the story about, uh, you can have even chat with, uh, uh,</p>
<p>you know, with GPT by saying that the chat is with Lex or Elon Musk or so, and, uh,</p>
<p>GPT would just pretend to be you or Elon Musk or so, and, uh, uh, it almost feels</p>
<p>that this, uh, story that we give ourselves to describe our life, it&rsquo;s almost like, uh,</p>
<p>things that you put into context of GPT.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The primary, it&rsquo;s the, and so, but the context we provide to GPT is, uh, is multimodal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more so GPT itself is multimodal.</p>
<p>GPT itself, uh, hasn&rsquo;t learned actually from experience of single human, but from the</p>
<p>experience of humanity, it&rsquo;s a chameleon.</p>
<p>You can turn it into anything and in some sense, by providing context, um, it, you</p>
<p>know, behaves as the thing that you wanted it to be.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s interesting that the, you know, people have a stories of who they are.</p>
<p>And, uh, as you said, these stories, they help them to operate in the world.</p>
<p>Um, but it&rsquo;s also, you know, interesting, I guess, various people find it out through</p>
<p>meditation or so that, uh, there might be some patterns that you have learned when</p>
<p>you were a kid that actually are not serving you anymore.</p>
<p>And you also might be thinking that that&rsquo;s who you are and that&rsquo;s actually just a story.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a useful hack, but sometimes it gets us into trouble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a local optima.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a local optima.</p>
<p>You wrote that Stephen Hawking, he tweeted, Stephen Hawking asked what</p>
<p>breathes fire into equations, which meant what makes given mathematical</p>
<p>equations realize the physics of a universe.</p>
<p>Similarly, I wonder what breathes fire into computation.</p>
<p>What makes given computation conscious?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So how do we engineer consciousness?</p>
<p>How do you breathe fire and magic?</p>
<p>How do you breathe fire and magic into the machine?</p>
<p>So, um, it seems clear to me that not every computation is conscious.</p>
<p>I mean, you can, let&rsquo;s say, just keep on multiplying one matrix over and over</p>
<p>again and might be gigantic matrix.</p>
<p>You can put a lot of computation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it would be conscious.</p>
<p>So in some sense, the question is, uh, what are the computations which could be</p>
<p>conscious, uh, I mean, so, so one assumption is that it has to do purely</p>
<p>with computation that you can abstract away matter and other possibilities</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very important was the realization of computation that it has</p>
<p>to do with some, uh, uh, force fields or so, and they bring consciousness.</p>
<p>At the moment, my intuition is that it can be fully abstracted away.</p>
<p>So in case of computation, you can ask yourself, what are the mathematical</p>
<p>objects or so that could bring such a properties?</p>
<p>So for instance, if we think about the models, uh, AI models, the, what they</p>
<p>truly try to do, uh, or like a models like GPT is, uh, uh, you know, they try</p>
<p>to predict, uh, next word or so.</p>
<p>And this turns out to be equivalent to, uh, compressing, uh, text.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, because in some sense, compression means that, uh, you learn</p>
<p>the model of reality and you have just to, uh, remember where are your mistakes.</p>
<p>The better you are in predicting the, and, and, and in some sense, when we</p>
<p>look at our experience, also, when you look, for instance, at the car driving,</p>
<p>you know, in which direction it will go, you are good like in prediction.</p>
<p>And, um, you know, it might be the case that the consciousness is intertwined</p>
<p>with, uh, compression, it might be also the case that self consciousness, uh,</p>
<p>has to do with compress or trying to compress itself.</p>
<p>So, um, okay.</p>
<p>I was just wondering, what are the objects in, you know, mathematics or</p>
<p>computer science, which are mysterious that could, uh, that, that, that could</p>
<p>have to do with consciousness.</p>
<p>And then I thought, um, you know, you, you see in mathematics, there is</p>
<p>something called Gadel theorem, uh, which means, okay, you have, if you have</p>
<p>sufficiently complicated mathematical system, it is possible to point the</p>
<p>mathematical system back on itself.</p>
<p>In computer science, there is, uh, something called helping problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s somewhat similar construction.</p>
<p>So I thought that, you know, if we believe that, uh, that, uh, that under</p>
<p>assumption that consciousness has to do with, uh, with compression, uh, then</p>
<p>you could imagine that the, that the, as you keep on compressing things, then</p>
<p>at some point, it actually makes sense for the compressor to compress itself.</p>
<p>Metacompression consciousness is metacompression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s an I, an, an, an idea.</p>
<p>And in some sense, you know, the crazy, thank you.</p>
<p>So, uh, but do you think if we think of a Turing machine, a universal</p>
<p>Turing machine, can that achieve consciousness?</p>
<p>So is there some thing beyond our traditional definition</p>
<p>of computation that&rsquo;s required?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a specific computation.</p>
<p>And I said, this computation has to do with compression and, uh, the compression</p>
<p>itself, maybe other way of putting it is like, uh, you are internally creating</p>
<p>the model of reality in order, like, uh, it&rsquo;s like a, you try inside to simplify</p>
<p>reality in order to predict what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And, um, that also feels somewhat similar to how I think actually about my own</p>
<p>conscious experience, though clearly I don&rsquo;t have access to reality.</p>
<p>The only access to reality is through, you know, cable going to my brain and my</p>
<p>brain is creating a simulation of reality and I have access to the simulation of</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>Are you by any chance, uh, aware of, uh, the Hutter prize, Marcus Hutter?</p>
<p>He, uh, he made this prize for compression.</p>
<p>Uh, Wikipedia pages, and, uh, there&rsquo;s a few qualities to it.</p>
<p>One, I think has to be perfect compression, which makes, I think that</p>
<p>little cork makes it much less, um, applicable to the general task of</p>
<p>intelligence, because it feels like intelligence is always going to be messy.</p>
<p>Uh, like perfect compression is feels like it&rsquo;s not the right goal, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nevertheless a very interesting goal.</p>
<p>So for him, intelligence equals compression.</p>
<p>And so the smaller you make the file, given a large Wikipedia page, the</p>
<p>more intelligent the system has to be.</p>
<p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>So you can make perfect compression if you store errors.</p>
<p>And I think that actually what he meant is you have algorithm plus errors.</p>
<p>Uh, by the way, Hutter, Hutter is, uh, he was a PhD advisor of Sean</p>
<p>Leck, who is a DeepMind, uh, uh, DeepMind cofounder.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an interesting, uh, and now he&rsquo;s a DeepMind, there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting, uh, network of people.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s one of the people that I think seriously took on the task of</p>
<p>what would an AGI system look like?</p>
<p>Uh, I think for a longest time, the question of AGI was not taken</p>
<p>seriously or rather rigorously.</p>
<p>And he did just that, like mathematically speaking, what</p>
<p>would the model look like if you remove the constraints of it, having to be,</p>
<p>uh, um, having to have a reasonable amount of memory, reasonable amount</p>
<p>of, uh, running time, complexity, uh, computation time, what would it look</p>
<p>like and essentially it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a half math, half philosophical discussion</p>
<p>of, uh, how would it like a reinforcement learning type of</p>
<p>framework look like for an AGI?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he developed the framework even to describe what&rsquo;s optimal with</p>
<p>respect to reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>Like there is a theoretical framework, which is, as you said, under assumption,</p>
<p>there is infinite amount of memory and compute.</p>
<p>Um, there was actually one person before his name is Solomonov, who</p>
<p>there extended, uh, Solomonov work to reinforcement learning, but there</p>
<p>exists the, uh, theoretical algorithm, which is optimal algorithm to build</p>
<p>intelligence and I can actually explain you the algorithm.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>So the task itself, can I just pause how absurd it is for brain in a</p>
<p>skull, trying to explain the algorithm for intelligence, just go ahead.</p>
<p>It is pretty crazy.</p>
<p>It is pretty crazy that, you know, the brain itself is actually so</p>
<p>small and it can ponder, uh, how to design algorithms that optimally</p>
<p>solve the problem of intelligence.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the algorithm?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>So first of all, the task itself is, uh, described as, uh, you have infinite</p>
<p>sequence of zeros and ones.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay. You read, uh, N bits and they are about to predict N plus one bit.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the task.</p>
<p>And you could imagine that every task could be casted as such a task.</p>
<p>So if for instance, you have images and labels, you can just turn every image</p>
<p>into a sequence of zeros and ones, then label, you concatenate labels and</p>
<p>you, and that that&rsquo;s actually the, the, and you could, you could start by</p>
<p>having training data first, and then afterwards you have test data.</p>
<p>So theoretically any problem could be casted as a problem of predicting</p>
<p>zeros and ones on this, uh, infinite tape.</p>
<p>So, um, so let&rsquo;s say you read already N bits and you want to predict N plus</p>
<p>one bit, and I will ask you to write every possible program that generates</p>
<p>these N bits.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, um, and you can have, you, you choose programming language.</p>
<p>It can be Python or C plus plus.</p>
<p>And the difference between programming languages, uh, might be, there is</p>
<p>a difference by constant asymptotically, your predictions will be equivalent.</p>
<p>So you read N bits, you enumerate all the programs that produce</p>
<p>these N bits in their output.</p>
<p>And then in order to predict N plus one bit, you actually weight the programs</p>
<p>according to their length.</p>
<p>And there is like a, some specific formula, how you weight them.</p>
<p>And then the N plus, uh, one bit prediction is the prediction, uh, from each</p>
<p>of these program, according to that weight.</p>
<p>Like statistically, you pick, so the smaller the program, the more likely</p>
<p>you, you are to pick the, its output.</p>
<p>So, uh, that&rsquo;s, that algorithm is grounded in the hope or the intuition</p>
<p>that the simple answer is the right one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a formalization of it.</p>
<p>Um, it also means like, if you would ask the question after how many years</p>
<p>would, you know, sun explode, uh, you can say, hmm, it&rsquo;s more likely</p>
<p>the answer is due to some power because they&rsquo;re shorter program.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, then other, well, I don&rsquo;t have a good intuition about, uh, how different</p>
<p>the space of short programs are from the space of large programs.</p>
<p>Like, what is the universe where short programs, uh, like run things?</p>
<p>Uh, so, so I said, the things have to agree with N bits.</p>
<p>So even if you have, you, you need to start, okay.</p>
<p>If, if you have very short program and they&rsquo;re like a steel, some has, if, if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not perfectly prediction of N bits, you have to start errors.</p>
<p>What are the errors?</p>
<p>And that gives you the full program that agrees on N bits.</p>
<p>Oh, so you don&rsquo;t agree with the N bits.</p>
<p>And you store, that&rsquo;s like a longer, a longer program, slightly longer program</p>
<p>because it can take these extra bits of errors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s your intuition about the, the programs that are able to do cool</p>
<p>stuff like intelligence and consciousness, are they, uh, perfectly like, is, is it,</p>
<p>uh, is there if then statements in them?</p>
<p>So like, is there a lot of a good, uh, if then statements in them?</p>
<p>So like, is there a lot of exceptions that they&rsquo;re storing?</p>
<p>So, um, you could imagine if there would be tremendous amount of if statements,</p>
<p>then they wouldn&rsquo;t be that short.</p>
<p>In case of neural networks, you could imagine that, um, what happens is, uh,</p>
<p>they, uh, when you start with an initialized neural network, uh, it stores</p>
<p>internally many possibilities, how the, uh, how the problem can be solved.</p>
<p>And SGD is kind of magnifying some, some, uh, some, uh, paths, which are slightly</p>
<p>similar to the correct answer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of magnifying correct programs.</p>
<p>And in some sense, SGD is a search algorithm in the program space and the</p>
<p>program space is represented by, uh, you know, kind of the wiring inside of the</p>
<p>neural network and there&rsquo;s like an insane number of ways how the features can be</p>
<p>computed.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the high level, basic question that&rsquo;s not so basic.</p>
<p>What is deep learning?</p>
<p>Is there a way you&rsquo;d like to think of it that is different than like</p>
<p>a generic textbook definition?</p>
<p>The thing that I hinted just a second ago is maybe that, uh, closest to how I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking these days about deep learning.</p>
<p>So, uh, now the statement is, uh, neural networks can represent some programs.</p>
<p>Uh, it seems that various modules that we are actually adding up to, or like, uh,</p>
<p>you know, we, we want networks to be deep because we, we want multiple</p>
<p>steps of the computation and, uh, uh, and deep learning provides the way to</p>
<p>represent space of programs, which is searchable and it&rsquo;s searchable with,</p>
<p>uh, stochastic gradient descent.</p>
<p>So we have an algorithm to search over humongous number of programs and</p>
<p>gradient descent kind of bubbles up the things that are, uh, tend to give correct</p>
<p>answers.</p>
<p>So a neural network with a, with fixed weights that&rsquo;s optimized, do you think</p>
<p>of that as a single program?</p>
<p>Um, so there is a, uh, work by Christopher Olaj where he, uh, so he works on</p>
<p>interpretability of neural networks and he was able to, uh, to identify the</p>
<p>neural network, for instance, a detector of a wheel for a car, or the detector of</p>
<p>a mask for a car, and then he was able to separate them out and assemble them, uh,</p>
<p>together using a simple program, uh, for the detector, for a car detector.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, uh, if you think of traditionally defined programs, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a function within a program that this particular neural network was able</p>
<p>to find and you can tear that out, just like you can copy and paste it into a</p>
<p>stack overflow that, so, uh, any program is a composition of smaller programs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the nice thing about the neural networks is that it allows the things</p>
<p>to be more fuzzy than in case of programs.</p>
<p>Uh, in case of programs, you have this, like a branching this way or that way.</p>
<p>And the neural networks, they, they have an easier way to, to be somewhere in</p>
<p>between or to share things.</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful or surprising idea in deep learning and the utilization</p>
<p>of these neural networks, which by the way, for people who are not familiar,</p>
<p>neural networks is a bunch of, uh, what would you say it&rsquo;s inspired by the human</p>
<p>brain, there&rsquo;s neurons, there&rsquo;s connection between those neurons, there&rsquo;s inputs and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s outputs and there&rsquo;s millions or billions of those neurons and the</p>
<p>learning happens in the neural network.</p>
<p>Neurons and the learning happens, uh, by adjusting the weights on the</p>
<p>edges that connect these neurons.</p>
<p>Thank you for giving definition that I supposed to do it, but I guess you have</p>
<p>enough empathy to listeners to actually know that the, that that might be useful.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s like, so I&rsquo;m asking Plato of like, what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not going to answer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being philosophical and deep and quite profound talking about the space</p>
<p>of programs, which is, which is very interesting, but also for people who</p>
<p>just not familiar with the hell we&rsquo;re talking about when we talk about deep</p>
<p>learning anyway, sorry, what is the most beautiful or surprising idea to you in,</p>
<p>in, um, in all the time you&rsquo;ve worked at deep learning and you worked on a lot of.</p>
<p>Fascinating projects, applications of neural networks.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be big and profound.</p>
<p>It can be a cool trick.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m thinking about the trick, but like, uh, it&rsquo;s still, uh, I&rsquo;m using</p>
<p>to me that it works at all that let&rsquo;s say that the extremely simple algorithm</p>
<p>stochastic gradient descent, which is something that I would be able to derive</p>
<p>on the piece of paper to high school student, uh, when put at the, at the</p>
<p>scale of, you know, thousands of machines actually, uh, can create the.</p>
<p>Behaviors we, which we called kind of human like behaviors.</p>
<p>So in general, any application is stochastic gradient descent</p>
<p>to neural networks is, is amazing to you.</p>
<p>So that, or is there a particular application in natural language</p>
<p>reinforcement learning, uh, and also what do you attribute that success to?</p>
<p>Is it just scale?</p>
<p>What profound insight can we take from the fact that the thing works</p>
<p>for gigantic, uh, sets of variables?</p>
<p>I mean, the interesting thing is this algorithms, they were invented decades</p>
<p>ago and, uh, people actually, uh, gave up on the idea and, um, you know, back</p>
<p>then they thought that we need profoundly different algorithms and they spent a lot</p>
<p>of cycles on very different algorithms.</p>
<p>And I believe that, uh, you know, we have seen that various, uh, various innovations</p>
<p>that say like transformer or, or dropout or so they can, uh, you know, pass the</p>
<p>help, but it&rsquo;s also remarkable to me that this algorithm from sixties or so, uh, or,</p>
<p>I mean, you can even say that the gradient descent was invented by Leibniz in, I</p>
<p>guess, 18th century or so that actually is the core of learning in the past.</p>
<p>In the past people are, it&rsquo;s almost like a, out of the, maybe an ego, people are</p>
<p>saying that it cannot be the case that such a simple algorithm is there, you</p>
<p>know, uh, could solve complicated problems.</p>
<p>So they were in search for the other algorithms.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;m saying, like, I believe that actually we are in the game where there</p>
<p>is, there are actually frankly three levers.</p>
<p>There is compute, there are algorithms and there is data.</p>
<p>And, uh, if we want to build intelligent systems, we have to pull, uh, all three</p>
<p>levers and they are actually multiplicative.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s also interesting.</p>
<p>So you ask, is it only compute?</p>
<p>Uh, people internally, they did the studies to determine how much gains they</p>
<p>were coming from different levers.</p>
<p>And so far we have seen that more gains came from compute than algorithms, but</p>
<p>also we are in the world that in case of compute, there is a kind of, you know,</p>
<p>exponential increase in funding and at some point it&rsquo;s impossible to, uh, invest</p>
<p>more, it&rsquo;s impossible to, you know, invest $10 trillion as we are speaking about</p>
<p>the, let&rsquo;s say all taxes in us.</p>
<p>Uh, but you&rsquo;re talking about money that could be innovation in the compute.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s true as well.</p>
<p>Uh, so I mean, they&rsquo;re like a few pieces.</p>
<p>So one piece is human brain is an incredible supercomputer and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>a, it, it, it has a hundred trillion parameters or like a, if you try to count</p>
<p>the various quantities in the brain, they&rsquo;re like a neuron synapses that small</p>
<p>number of neurons, there is a lot of synapses it&rsquo;s unclear even how to map, uh,</p>
<p>synapses to, uh, to parameters of neural networks, but it&rsquo;s clear that there are</p>
<p>many more.</p>
<p>Yeah. Um, so it might be the case that our networks are still somewhat small.</p>
<p>Uh, it also might be the case that they are more efficient than brain or less</p>
<p>efficient by some, by some huge factor.</p>
<p>Um, I also believe that there will be like a, you know, at the moment we are at</p>
<p>the stage that the, these neural networks, they require thousand X or, or like a</p>
<p>huge factor of more data than humans do.</p>
<p>And it will be a matter of, uh, um, there will be algorithms that vastly decrease</p>
<p>sample complexity, I believe so, but that place where we are heading today is</p>
<p>there are domains which contains million X more data.</p>
<p>And even though computers might be 1000 times slower than humans in learning,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a problem.</p>
<p>Like, uh, for instance, uh, I believe that, uh, it should be possible to create</p>
<p>super human therapist, uh, by, uh, and, and the, the, like, uh, even simple</p>
<p>steps of, of, of doing what, of, of doing it.</p>
<p>And, you know, the, the core reason is there is just machine will be able to</p>
<p>read way more transcripts of therapies, and then it should be able to speak</p>
<p>simultaneously with many more people and it should be possible to optimize it,</p>
<p>uh, all in parallel.</p>
<p>And, uh, well, there&rsquo;s now you&rsquo;re touching on something I deeply care about</p>
<p>and think is way harder than we imagine.</p>
<p>Um, what&rsquo;s the goal of a therapist?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal of therapies?</p>
<p>So, okay, so one goal now this is terrifying to me, but there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people that, uh, contemplate suicide, suffer from depression, uh, and they</p>
<p>could significantly be helped with therapy and the idea that an AI algorithm</p>
<p>might be in charge of that, it&rsquo;s like a life and death task.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, uh, the stakes are high.</p>
<p>So one goal for a therapist, whether human or AI is to prevent suicide</p>
<p>ideation to prevent suicide.</p>
<p>How do you achieve that?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>So to be clear, I don&rsquo;t think that the current models are good enough for such</p>
<p>a task because it requires insane amount of understanding, empathy, and the</p>
<p>models are far from this place, but it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But do you think that understanding empathy, that signal is in the data?</p>
<p>Um, I think there is some signal in the data.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, there are plenty of transcripts of conversations and it is possible to,</p>
<p>it is possible from it to understand personalities.</p>
<p>It is possible from it to understand, uh, if conversation is, uh,</p>
<p>friendly, uh, amicable, uh, uh, antagonistic, it is, I believe that the,</p>
<p>you know, given the fact that the models that we train now, they can, uh, they</p>
<p>can have, they are chameleons that they can have any personality, they might</p>
<p>turn out to be better in understanding, uh, personality of other people than</p>
<p>anyone else and they empathetic to be empathetic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting. Uh, but I wonder if there&rsquo;s some level of, uh, multiple</p>
<p>modalities required to be able to, um, be empathetic of the human experience,</p>
<p>whether language is not enough to understand death, to understand fear,</p>
<p>to understand, uh, childhood trauma, to understand, uh, wit and humor required</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dancing with a person who might be depressed or suffering both</p>
<p>humor and hope and love and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s another underlying question, which is self supervised versus</p>
<p>supervised.</p>
<p>So can you get that from the data by just reading a huge number of transcripts?</p>
<p>I actually, so I think that reading huge number of transcripts is a step one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like at the same way as you cannot learn to dance if just from YouTube by</p>
<p>watching it, you have to actually try it out yourself.</p>
<p>And so I think that here that&rsquo;s a similar situation.</p>
<p>I also wouldn&rsquo;t deploy the system in the high stakes situations right away, but</p>
<p>kind of see gradually where it goes.</p>
<p>And, uh, obviously initially, uh, it would have to go hand in hand with humans.</p>
<p>But, uh, at the moment we are in the situation that actually there is many</p>
<p>more people who actually would like to have a therapy or, or speak with, with</p>
<p>someone than there are therapies out there.</p>
<p>I can, you know, I was so, so fundamentally I was thinking, what are</p>
<p>the things that, uh, can vastly increase people&rsquo;s well being therapy is one of</p>
<p>them being meditation is other one, I guess maybe human connection is a third</p>
<p>one, and I guess pharmacologically it&rsquo;s also possible, maybe direct brain</p>
<p>stimulation or something like that.</p>
<p>But these are pretty much options out there.</p>
<p>Then let&rsquo;s say the way I&rsquo;m thinking about the AGI endeavor is by default,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an endeavor to, uh, increase amount of wealth.</p>
<p>And I believe that we can invest the increase amount of wealth for everyone</p>
<p>and simultaneously.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there are like a two endeavors that make sense to me.</p>
<p>One is like essentially increase amount of wealth.</p>
<p>And second one is, uh, increase overall human wellbeing.</p>
<p>And those are coupled together and they, they can, like, uh, I would</p>
<p>say these are different topics.</p>
<p>One can help another and, uh, you know, therapist is a, is a funny word</p>
<p>because I see friendship and love as therapy.</p>
<p>I mean, so therapist broadly defined as just friendship as a friend.</p>
<p>So like therapist is, has a very kind of clinical sense to it, but what</p>
<p>is human connection you&rsquo;re like, uh, not to get all Camus and Dostoevsky on you,</p>
<p>but you know, life is suffering and we draw, we seek connection with the</p>
<p>humans as we, uh, desperately try to make sense of this world in a deep</p>
<p>overwhelming loneliness that we feel inside.</p>
<p>So I think connection has to do with understanding.</p>
<p>And I think that almost like a lack of understanding causes suffering.</p>
<p>If you speak with someone and do you, do you feel ignored that actually causes pain?</p>
<p>If you are feeling deeply understood that actually they, they, they might</p>
<p>not even tell you what to do in life, but like a pure understanding</p>
<p>or just being heard, understanding is a kind of, that&rsquo;s a lot, you know,</p>
<p>just being heard, feel like you&rsquo;re being heard, like somehow that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>alleviation temporarily of the loneliness that if somebody knows</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re here with their body language, with the way they are, with the way</p>
<p>they look at you, with the way they talk, do you feel less alone for a brief moment?</p>
<p>Yeah, very much agree.</p>
<p>So I thought in the past about, um, somewhat similar question to yours,</p>
<p>which is what is love, uh, rather what is connection.</p>
<p>Yes. And, um, and obviously I think about these things from AI perspective.</p>
<p>What would it mean?</p>
<p>Um, so I said that, um, you know, intelligence has to do with some compression,</p>
<p>which is more or less like I can say, almost understanding of what is going around.</p>
<p>It seems to me that, uh, other aspect is there seem to be reward functions and you</p>
<p>can have, uh, uh, you know, reward for, uh, food, for maybe human connection, for,</p>
<p>uh, let&rsquo;s say warmth, uh, sex and so on.</p>
<p>And, um, and it turns out that the various people might be optimizing slightly</p>
<p>different, uh, reward functions.</p>
<p>They essentially might care about different things.</p>
<p>And, uh, uh, in case of, uh, love at least the love between two people, you can say</p>
<p>that the, um, you know, boundary between people dissolves to such extent that, uh,</p>
<p>they end up optimizing each other reward functions and yeah, oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Um, celebrate the success of each other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In some sense, I would say love means, uh, helping others to optimize their, uh,</p>
<p>reward functions, not your reward functions, not the things that you think are</p>
<p>important, but the things that the person cares about, you try to help them to,</p>
<p>uh, optimize it.</p>
<p>So love is, uh, if you think of two reward functions, you just, it&rsquo;s a condition.</p>
<p>You combine them together, pretty much maybe like with a weight and it depends</p>
<p>like the dynamic of the relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you could imagine that if you&rsquo;re fully, uh, optimizing someone&rsquo;s reward</p>
<p>function without yours, then, then maybe are creating codependency or something</p>
<p>like that, but I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s the appropriate weight, but the interesting</p>
<p>thing is I even, I even think that the, uh, individual reward function is</p>
<p>saying that the individual person, uh, uh, we ourselves, we are actually less</p>
<p>of a unified insight.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you look at, at the donut on the one level, you might think,</p>
<p>oh, this is like, it looks tasty.</p>
<p>I would like to eat it on other level.</p>
<p>You might tell yourself, I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing it because I want to gain muscles.</p>
<p>So, and you know, you might do it regardless kind of against yourself.</p>
<p>So it seems that even within ourselves, they&rsquo;re almost like a kind of intertwined</p>
<p>personas and, um, I believe that the self love means that, uh, the love between all</p>
<p>these personas, which also means being able to love, love yourself when we are</p>
<p>angry or stressed or so combining all those reward functions of the different</p>
<p>selves you have and accepting that they are there, like, uh, you know, often</p>
<p>people, they have a negative self talk or they say, I don&rsquo;t like when I&rsquo;m angry.</p>
<p>And like, I try to imagine, try to imagine if there would be like a small</p>
<p>baby Lex, like a five years old, angry, and then they are like, you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be angry.</p>
<p>Like stop being angry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But like an instant, actually you want the Lex to come over, give him a hug and</p>
<p>just like, I say, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be angry as long as you want.</p>
<p>And then he would stop or, or maybe not, or maybe not, but you cannot expect it</p>
<p>even.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But still, that doesn&rsquo;t explain the why of love.</p>
<p>Like why is love part of the human condition?</p>
<p>Why is it useful to combine the reward functions?</p>
<p>It seems like that doesn&rsquo;t, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think reinforcement learning</p>
<p>frameworks can give us answers to why even, even the Hutter framework has</p>
<p>an objective function that&rsquo;s static.</p>
<p>So we came to existence as a consequence of evolutionary process.</p>
<p>And in some sense, the purpose of evolution is survival.</p>
<p>And then the, this complicated optimization objective baked into us, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say compression, which might help us operate in the real world and it baked</p>
<p>into us various reward functions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then to be clear at the moment we are operating in the regime, which is somewhat</p>
<p>out of distribution, where they even evolution optimized us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like love is a consequence of a cooperation that we&rsquo;ve discovered is</p>
<p>useful.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>In some way it&rsquo;s even the case.</p>
<p>If you, I just love the idea that love is like the out of distribution.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s not out of distribution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, as you said, it evolved for cooperation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I believe that the cop, like in some sense, cooperation ends up helping each</p>
<p>of us individually, so it makes sense evolutionary and there is a, in some</p>
<p>sense, and, you know, love means there is this dissolution of boundaries that you</p>
<p>have a shared reward function and we evolve to actually identify ourselves with</p>
<p>larger groups, so we can identify ourselves, you know, with a family, we can</p>
<p>identify ourselves with a country to such extent that people are willing to give</p>
<p>away their life for country.</p>
<p>So there is, we are wired actually even for love.</p>
<p>And at the moment, I guess, the, maybe it would be somewhat more beneficial if you</p>
<p>will, if we would identify ourselves with all the humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>So you can clearly see when people travel around the world, when they run into</p>
<p>person from the same country, they say, oh, which CPR and all this, like all the</p>
<p>sudden they find all these similarities.</p>
<p>They find some, they befriended those folks earlier than others.</p>
<p>So there is like a sense, some sense of the belonging. And I would say, I think</p>
<p>it would be overall good thing to the world for people to move towards, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even called open individualism, move toward the mindset of a larger and</p>
<p>larger groups.</p>
<p>So the challenge there, that&rsquo;s a beautiful vision and I share it to expand</p>
<p>that circle of empathy, that circle of love towards the entirety of humanity.</p>
<p>But then you start to ask, well, where do you draw the line?</p>
<p>Because why not expand it to other conscious beings?</p>
<p>And then finally, for our discussion, something I think about is why not</p>
<p>expand it to AI systems?</p>
<p>Like we, we start respecting each other when the, the person, the entity on the</p>
<p>other side has the capacity to suffer.</p>
<p>Cause then we develop a capacity to sort of empathize.</p>
<p>And so I could see AI systems that are interacting with humans more and more</p>
<p>having conscious, like displays.</p>
<p>So like they display consciousness through language and through other means.</p>
<p>And so then the question is like, well, is that consciousness?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re acting conscious.</p>
<p>And so, you know, the reason we don&rsquo;t like torturing animals is because</p>
<p>they look like they&rsquo;re suffering when they&rsquo;re tortured and if AI looks like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s suffering when it&rsquo;s tortured, how is that not requiring of the same kind</p>
<p>of empathy from us and respect and rights that animals do and other humans do?</p>
<p>I think it requires empathy as well.</p>
<p>I mean, I would like, I guess us or humanity or so make a progress in</p>
<p>understanding what consciousness is, because I don&rsquo;t want just to be speaking</p>
<p>about that, the philosophy, but rather actually make a scientific, uh, to have</p>
<p>a, like, you know, there was a time that people thought that there is a force of</p>
<p>life and, uh, the things that have this force, they are alive.</p>
<p>And, um, I think that there is actually a path to understand exactly what</p>
<p>consciousness is and how it works.</p>
<p>Understand exactly what consciousness is.</p>
<p>And, uh, um, in some sense, it might require essentially putting</p>
<p>probes inside of a human brain, uh, what Neuralink, uh, does.</p>
<p>So the goal there, I mean, there&rsquo;s several things with consciousness</p>
<p>that make it a real discipline, which is one is rigorous</p>
<p>measurement of consciousness.</p>
<p>And then the other is the engineering of consciousness,</p>
<p>which may or may not be related.</p>
<p>I mean, you could also run into trouble.</p>
<p>Like, for example, in the United States for the department, DOT,</p>
<p>department of transportation, and a lot of different places</p>
<p>put a value on human life.</p>
<p>I think DOT is, uh, values $9 million per person.</p>
<p>Sort of in that same way, you can get into trouble.</p>
<p>If you put a number on how conscious of being is, because then you can start</p>
<p>making policy, if a cow is a 0.1 or like, um, 10% as conscious as a human,</p>
<p>then you can start making calculations and it might get you into trouble.</p>
<p>But then again, that might be a very good way to do it.</p>
<p>I would like, uh, to move to that place that actually we have scientific</p>
<p>understanding what consciousness is.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll be able to actually assign value.</p>
<p>And I believe that there is even the path for the experimentation in it.</p>
<p>So, uh, you know, w we said that, you know, you could put the</p>
<p>probes inside of the brain.</p>
<p>There is actually a few other things that you could do with</p>
<p>devices like Neuralink.</p>
<p>So you could imagine that the way even to measure if AI system is conscious</p>
<p>is by literally just plugging into the brain.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, that, that seems like it&rsquo;s kind of easy, but the plugging</p>
<p>into the brain and asking person if they feel that their consciousness</p>
<p>expanded, um, this direction of course has some issues.</p>
<p>You can say, you know, if someone takes a psychedelic drug, they might</p>
<p>feel that their consciousness expanded, even though that drug</p>
<p>itself is not conscious.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So like, you can&rsquo;t fully trust the self report of a person saying their,</p>
<p>their consciousness is expanded or not.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a little bit about psychedelics is, uh, there&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>a lot of excellent research on, uh, different psychedelics, psilocybin,</p>
<p>MDMA, even DMT drugs in general, marijuana too.</p>
<p>Uh, what do you think psychedelics do to the human mind?</p>
<p>It seems they take the human mind to some interesting places.</p>
<p>Is that just a little, uh, hack, a visual hack, or is there some</p>
<p>profound expansion of the mind?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see, I don&rsquo;t believe in magic.</p>
<p>I believe in, uh, I believe in, uh, in science in, in causality, um, still,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, and then as I said, like, I think that the brain, that the, our</p>
<p>subjective experience of reality is, uh, we live in the simulation run by our</p>
<p>brain and the simulation that our brain runs, they can be very pleasant or very</p>
<p>hellish drugs, they are changing some hyper parameters of the simulation.</p>
<p>It is possible thanks to change of these hyper parameters to actually look back</p>
<p>on your experience and even see that the given things that we took for</p>
<p>granted, they are changeable.</p>
<p>So they allow to have a amazing perspective.</p>
<p>There is also, for instance, the fact that after DMT people can see the</p>
<p>full movie inside of their head, gives me further belief that the brain can generate</p>
<p>that full movie, that the brain is actually learning the model of reality</p>
<p>to such extent that it tries to predict what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Very high resolution.</p>
<p>So it can replay reality.</p>
<p>Extremely high resolution.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also kind of interesting to me that somehow there seems to be some similarity</p>
<p>between these, uh, drugs and meditation itself.</p>
<p>And I actually started even these days to think about meditation as a psychedelic.</p>
<p>Do you practice meditation?</p>
<p>I practice meditation.</p>
<p>I mean, I went a few times on the retreats and it feels after like after</p>
<p>second or third day of meditation, uh, there is a, there is almost like a</p>
<p>sense of, you know, tripping what, what does the meditation retreat entail?</p>
<p>So you w you wake up early in the morning and you meditate for extended</p>
<p>period of time, uh, and yeah, so it&rsquo;s optimized, even though there are other</p>
<p>people, it&rsquo;s optimized for isolation.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t speak with anyone.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually look into other people&rsquo;s eyes and, uh, you know, you sit</p>
<p>on the chair and say Vipassana meditation tells you, uh, to focus on the breath.</p>
<p>So you try to put, uh, all the, all attention into breathing and, uh,</p>
<p>breathing in and breathing out.</p>
<p>And the crazy thing is that as you focus attention like that, uh, after some</p>
<p>time, their stems starts coming back, like some memories that you completely</p>
<p>forgotten, it almost feels like, uh, that you&rsquo;ll have a mailbox and then you know,</p>
<p>you are just like a archiving email one by one.</p>
<p>And at some point, at some point there is this like a amazing feeling of getting</p>
<p>to mailbox zero, zero emails.</p>
<p>And, uh, it&rsquo;s very pleasant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s crazy to me that, um, that once you</p>
<p>resolve these, uh, inner store stories or like inner traumas, then once there is</p>
<p>nothing, uh, left that default, uh, state of human mind is extremely peaceful and</p>
<p>happy, extreme, like, uh, some sense it, it feels that the, it feels at least to</p>
<p>me that way, how, when I was a child that I can look at any object and it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>beautiful, I have a lot of curiosity about the simple things and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>the usual meditation takes me.</p>
<p>Are you, what are you experiencing?</p>
<p>Are you just taking in simple sensory information and they&rsquo;re just enjoying</p>
<p>the rawness of that sensory information?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no memories or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just enjoying being.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty much.</p>
<p>I mean, still there is, uh, that it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s thoughts are slowing down.</p>
<p>Sometimes they pop up, but it&rsquo;s also somehow the extended meditation takes you</p>
<p>to the space that they are way more friendly, way more positive.</p>
<p>Um, there is also this, uh, this thing that, uh, we&rsquo;ve, it almost feels that the.</p>
<p>It almost feels that the, we are constantly getting a little bit of a reward</p>
<p>function and we are just spreading this reward function on various activities.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ll stay still for extended period of time, it kind of accumulates,</p>
<p>accumulates, accumulates, and, uh, there is a, there is a sense, there is a sense</p>
<p>that some point it passes some threshold and it feels as drop is falling into kind</p>
<p>of ocean of love and this, and that&rsquo;s like, uh, this is like a very pleasant.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m saying like, uh, that corresponds to the subjective experience.</p>
<p>Some people, uh, I guess in spiritual community, they describe it that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the reality, and I would say, I believe that they&rsquo;re like, uh, all sorts of</p>
<p>subjective experience that one can have.</p>
<p>And, uh, I believe that for instance, meditation might take you to the</p>
<p>subjective experiences with the subject.</p>
<p>Vision might take you to the subjective experiences, which are</p>
<p>very pleasant, collaborative.</p>
<p>And I would like a word to move toward a more collaborative, uh, uh, place.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s very pleasant and I enjoy doing stuff like that.</p>
<p>I, um, I wonder how that maps to your, uh, mathematical model of love with, uh,</p>
<p>the reward function, combining a bunch of things, it seems like our life then is</p>
<p>just, we have this reward function and we&rsquo;re accumulating a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>in it with weights, it&rsquo;s like, um, like multi objective and what meditation</p>
<p>is, is you just remove them, remove them until the weight on one, uh, or</p>
<p>just a few is very high and that&rsquo;s where the pleasure comes from.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So something similar, how I&rsquo;m thinking about this.</p>
<p>So I told you that there is this like, uh, that there is a story of who you are.</p>
<p>And I think almost about it as a, you know, text prepended to GPT.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, uh, some people refer to it as ego.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a story who, who, who you are.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So ego is the prompt for GPT three or GPT.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s description of you.</p>
<p>And then with meditation, you can get to the point that actually you experience</p>
<p>things without the prompt and you experience things like as they are, you</p>
<p>are not biased over the description, how they supposed to be, uh, that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>pleasant.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ve respected the reward function.</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s possible to get to the point that the, there is the solution of self.</p>
<p>And therefore you can say that the, or you&rsquo;re having a, your, or like a, your</p>
<p>brain attempts to simulate the reward function of everyone else or like</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s that there is this like a love, which feels like a oneness with</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also, you know, very beautiful, very pleasant.</p>
<p>At some point you might have a lot of altruistic thoughts during that moment.</p>
<p>And then the self, uh, always comes back.</p>
<p>How would you recommend if somebody is interested in meditation, like a big</p>
<p>thing to take on as a project, would you recommend a meditation retreat?</p>
<p>How many days, what kind of thing would you recommend?</p>
<p>I think that actually retreat is the way to go.</p>
<p>Um, it almost feels that, uh, um, as I said, like a meditation is a psychedelic,</p>
<p>but, uh, when you take it in the small dose, you might barely feel it.</p>
<p>Once you get the high dose, actually you&rsquo;re going to feel it.</p>
<p>Um, so even cold turkey, if you haven&rsquo;t really seriously meditated for a long</p>
<p>period of time, just go to a retreat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How many days, how many days?</p>
<p>Start weekend one weekend.</p>
<p>So like two, three days.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, uh, it&rsquo;s interesting that first or second day, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And at some point it becomes easy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of seconds in a day.</p>
<p>How hard is the meditation retreat just sitting there in a chair?</p>
<p>So the thing is actually, it literally just depends on your, uh, on the,</p>
<p>your own framing, like if you are in the mindset that you are waiting for it to</p>
<p>be over, or you are waiting for a Nirvana to happen, you are waiting</p>
<p>it will be very unpleasant.</p>
<p>And in some sense, even the difficulty, it&rsquo;s not even in the lack of being</p>
<p>able to speak with others, like, uh, you&rsquo;re sitting there, your legs</p>
<p>will hurt from sitting in terms of like the practical things.</p>
<p>Do you experience kind of discomfort, like physical discomfort of just</p>
<p>sitting, like your, your butt being numb, your legs being sore, all that kind of</p>
<p>stuff?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You experience it.</p>
<p>And then the, the, they teach you to observe it rather.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, uh, the crazy thing is you at first might have a feeling</p>
<p>toward trying to escape it and that becomes very apparent that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extremely unpleasant.</p>
<p>And then you just, just observe it.</p>
<p>And then at some point it just becomes, uh, it just is, it&rsquo;s like, uh, I remember</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve, Ilya told me some time ago that, uh, you know, he takes a cold</p>
<p>shower and he&rsquo;s the mindset of taking a cold shower was to embrace suffering.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>I do the same.</p>
<p>This is your style?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s my style.</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>So my style is actually, I also sometimes take cold showers.</p>
<p>It is purely observing how the water goes through my body, like a purely being</p>
<p>present, not trying to escape from there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I would say then it actually becomes pleasant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, ah, well, that that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Um, I I&rsquo;m also that mean that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the way to deal with anything really</p>
<p>difficult, especially in the physical space is to observe it to say it&rsquo;s pleasant.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a D I would use a different word.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, um, you&rsquo;re accepting of the full beauty of reality.</p>
<p>I would say, cause say pleasant.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, in some sense it is pleasant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way to deal with a cold shower is to, to, uh, become an</p>
<p>observer and to find joy in it.</p>
<p>Um, same with like really difficult, physical, um, exercise or like running</p>
<p>for a really long time, endurance events, just anytime you&rsquo;re, any kind of pain.</p>
<p>I think the only way to survive it is not to resist it is to observe it.</p>
<p>You mentioned, you mentioned, um, you mentioned, um, you mentioned</p>
<p>Ilya, Ilya says, it&rsquo;s very, he&rsquo;s our chief scientist, but also</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very close friend of mine.</p>
<p>He cofounded open air with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken with him a few times.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>I really enjoy talking to him.</p>
<p>His mind, just like yours works in fascinating ways.</p>
<p>Now, both of you are not able to define deep learning simply.</p>
<p>Uh, what&rsquo;s it like having him as somebody you have technical discussions with on</p>
<p>in the space of machine learning, deep learning, AI, but also life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like when these two, um, agents get into a self play situation in a room?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like collaborating with him?</p>
<p>So I believe that we have, uh, extreme, uh, respect to each other.</p>
<p>So, uh, in, I love Ilya&rsquo;s insight, both like, uh, I guess about</p>
<p>consciousness, uh, life AI, but, uh, in terms of the, it&rsquo;s interesting to</p>
<p>me, cause you&rsquo;re a brilliant, uh, Thinker in the space of machine</p>
<p>learning, like intuition, like digging deep in what works, what doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>why it works, why it doesn&rsquo;t, and so is Ilya.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if there&rsquo;s interesting deep discussions you&rsquo;ve had with him in the</p>
<p>past or disagreements that were very productive.</p>
<p>So I can say, I also understood over the time, where are my strengths?</p>
<p>So obviously we have plenty of AI discussions and, um, um, and do you</p>
<p>know, I myself have plenty of ideas, but like I consider Ilya, uh, what</p>
<p>of the most prolific AI scientists in the entire world.</p>
<p>And, uh, I think that, um, I realized that maybe my super skill, um, is, uh,</p>
<p>being able to bring people to collaborate together, that I have some level of</p>
<p>empathy that is unique in AI world.</p>
<p>And that might come, you know, from either meditation, psychedelics, or</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I read just hundreds of books on this topic.</p>
<p>So, and I also went through a journey of, you know, I developed a</p>
<p>lot of, uh, algorithms, so I think that maybe I can, that&rsquo;s my super human skill.</p>
<p>Uh, Ilya is, uh, one of the best AI scientists, but then I&rsquo;m pretty</p>
<p>good in assembling teams and I&rsquo;m also not holding to people.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m growing people and then people become managers at OpenAI.</p>
<p>I grew many of them, like a research managers.</p>
<p>So you, you find, you find places where you&rsquo;re excellent and he finds like his,</p>
<p>his, his deep scientific insights is where he is and you find ways you can,</p>
<p>the puzzle pieces fit together.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Like, uh, you know, ultimately, for instance, let&rsquo;s say Ilya, he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>manage people, uh, that&rsquo;s not what he likes or so.</p>
<p>Um, I like, I like hanging out with people.</p>
<p>By default, I&rsquo;m an extrovert and I care about people.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting. Okay. All right. Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So that, that fits perfectly together.</p>
<p>But I mean, uh, I also just like your intuition about various</p>
<p>problems in machine learning.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s definitely one I really enjoy.</p>
<p>I remember talking to him about something I was struggling with, which</p>
<p>is coming up with a good model for pedestrians, for human beings across</p>
<p>the street in the context of autonomous vehicles, and I was like, okay,</p>
<p>in the context of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>And he immediately started to like formulate a framework within which you</p>
<p>can evolve a model for pedestrians, like through self play, all that kind of</p>
<p>mechanisms, the depth of thought on a particular problem, especially problems</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t know anything about is, is fascinating to watch.</p>
<p>It makes you realize like, um, yeah, the, the, the limits of the, that the human</p>
<p>intellect may be limitless, or it&rsquo;s just impressive to see a descendant of</p>
<p>ape come up with clever ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, so even in the space of deep learning, when you look at various</p>
<p>people, there are people now who invented some breakthroughs once, but</p>
<p>there are very few people who did it multiple times.</p>
<p>And you can think if someone invented it once, that might be just a sheer luck.</p>
<p>And if someone invented it multiple times, you know, if a probability of</p>
<p>inventing it once is one over a million, then probability of inventing it twice</p>
<p>or three times would be one over a million square or, or to the power of</p>
<p>three, which, which would be just impossible.</p>
<p>So it literally means that it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s given that, uh, it&rsquo;s not the luck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Ilya is one of these few people who, uh, uh, who have, uh, a lot of</p>
<p>these inventions in his arsenal.</p>
<p>It also feels that, um, you know, for instance, if you think about folks</p>
<p>like Gauss or Euler, uh, you know, at first they read a lot of books and then</p>
<p>they did thinking and then they figure out math and that&rsquo;s how it feels with</p>
<p>Ilya, you know, at first he read stuff and then like he spent his thinking cycles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really good way to put it.</p>
<p>When I talk to him, I, I see thinking.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually thinking, like, he makes me realize that there&rsquo;s like deep</p>
<p>thinking that the human mind can do.</p>
<p>Like most of us are not thinking deeply.</p>
<p>Uh, like you really have to put in a lot of effort to think deeply.</p>
<p>Like I have to really put myself in a place where I think deeply about a</p>
<p>problem, it takes a lot of effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, uh, it&rsquo;s like an airplane taking off or something.</p>
<p>You have to achieve deep focus.</p>
<p>He he&rsquo;s just, uh, he&rsquo;s what is it?</p>
<p>He said, what does it, his brain is like a vertical takeoff in</p>
<p>terms of airplane analogy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting, but it, I mean, Cal Newport talks about</p>
<p>this as ideas of deep work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, most of us don&rsquo;t work much at all in terms of like, like deeply</p>
<p>think about particular problems, whether it&rsquo;s a math engineering, all that kind</p>
<p>of stuff, you want to go to that place often and that&rsquo;s real hard work.</p>
<p>And some of us are better than others at that.</p>
<p>So I think that the big piece has to do with actually even engineering</p>
<p>your environment that says that it&rsquo;s conducive to that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, um, see both Ilya and I, uh, on the frequent basis, we kind of disconnect</p>
<p>ourselves from the world in order to be able to do extensive amount of thinking.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So Ilya usually, he just, uh, leaves iPad at hand.</p>
<p>He loves his iPad.</p>
<p>And, uh, for me, I&rsquo;m even sometimes, you know, just going for a few days</p>
<p>to different location to Airbnb, I&rsquo;m turning off my phone and there is no</p>
<p>access to me and, uh, that&rsquo;s extremely important for me to be able to actually</p>
<p>just formulate new thoughts, to do deep work rather than to be reactive.</p>
<p>And the, the, the older I am, the more of these random tasks are at hand.</p>
<p>Before I go on to that, uh, thread, let me return to our friend, GPT.</p>
<p>And let me ask you another ridiculously big question.</p>
<p>Can you give an overview of what GPT three is, or like you say in</p>
<p>your Twitter bio, GPT N plus one, how it works and why it works.</p>
<p>So, um, GPT three is a humongous neural network.</p>
<p>Um, let&rsquo;s assume that we know what is neural network, the definition, and it</p>
<p>is trained on the entire internet and just to predict next word.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say it sees part of the, uh, article and it, the only task that it</p>
<p>has at hand, it is to say what would be the next word and what would be the next</p>
<p>word and it becomes a really exceptional at the task of figuring out what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>next word. So you might ask, why would, uh, this be an important, uh, task?</p>
<p>Why would it be important to predict what&rsquo;s the next word?</p>
<p>And it turns out that a lot of problems, uh, can be formulated, uh, as a text</p>
<p>completion problem.</p>
<p>So GPT is purely, uh, learning to complete the text.</p>
<p>And you could imagine, for instance, if you are asking a question, uh, who is</p>
<p>the president of the United States, then GPT can give you an answer to it.</p>
<p>It turns out that many more things can be formulated this way.</p>
<p>You can format text in the way that you have sentence in English.</p>
<p>You make it even look like some content of a website, uh, elsewhere, which would</p>
<p>be teaching people how to translate things between languages.</p>
<p>So it would be EN colon, uh, text in English, FR colon, and then you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>uh, uh, and then you&rsquo;ll ask people and then you ask model to, to continue.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the, such a model is predicting translation from English</p>
<p>to French.</p>
<p>The crazy thing is that this model can be used for way more sophisticated tasks.</p>
<p>So you can format text such that it looks like a conversation between two people.</p>
<p>And that might be a conversation between you and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>And because the model read all the texts about Elon Musk, it will be able to</p>
<p>predict Elon Musk words as it would be Elon Musk.</p>
<p>It will speak about colonization of Mars, about sustainable future and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also possible to, to even give arbitrary personality to the model.</p>
<p>You can say, here is a conversation that we&rsquo;ve a friendly AI bot.</p>
<p>And the model, uh, will complete the text as a friendly AI bot.</p>
<p>So, I mean, how do I express how amazing this is?</p>
<p>So just to clarify, uh, a conversation, generating a conversation between me and</p>
<p>Elon Musk, it wouldn&rsquo;t just generate good examples of what Elon would say.</p>
<p>It would get the same results as the conversation between Elon Musk and me.</p>
<p>Say it would get the syntax all correct.</p>
<p>So like interview style, it would say like Elon call and Lex call, like it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just like, uh, inklings of, um, semantic correctness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the whole thing, grammatical, syntactic, semantic, it&rsquo;s just really,</p>
<p>really impressive, uh, generalization.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I also want to, you know, provide some caveats so it can generate</p>
<p>few paragraphs of coherent text, but as you go to, uh, longer pieces,</p>
<p>it, uh, it actually goes off the rails.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If you try to write a book, it won&rsquo;t work out this way.</p>
<p>What way does it go off the rails, by the way?</p>
<p>Is there interesting ways in which it goes off the rails?</p>
<p>Like what falls apart first?</p>
<p>So the model is trained on the, all the existing data, uh, that is out there,</p>
<p>which means that it is not trained on its own mistakes.</p>
<p>So for instance, if it would make a mistake, then, uh, I kept,</p>
<p>so to give you, give you an example.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I have a conversation with a model pretending that is Elon Musk.</p>
<p>And then I start putting some, uh, I&rsquo;m start actually making up</p>
<p>things which are not factual.</p>
<p>Um, I would say like Twitter, but I got you.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, like, uh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would say that Elon is my wife and the model will just keep on carrying it on.</p>
<p>And as if it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And in some sense, if you would have a normal conversation with Elon,</p>
<p>he would be what the fuck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be some feedback between, so the model is trained on things</p>
<p>that humans have written, but through the generation process, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no human in the loop feedback.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s magnified.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the errors get magnified and magnified and it&rsquo;s also interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, humans have the same problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we, uh, we&rsquo;ll make fewer errors and magnify the errors slower.</p>
<p>I think that actually what happens with humans is if you have a wrong</p>
<p>belief about the world as a kid, then very quickly we&rsquo;ll learn that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not correct because they are grounded in reality and they are learning</p>
<p>from your new experience.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But do you think the model can correct itself too?</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t it through the power of the representation.</p>
<p>And so the absence of Elon Musk being your wife information on the</p>
<p>internet, won&rsquo;t it correct itself?</p>
<p>There won&rsquo;t be examples like that.</p>
<p>So the errors will be subtle at first.</p>
<p>Subtle at first.</p>
<p>And in some sense, you can also say that the data that is not out there is</p>
<p>the data, which would represent how the human learns and maybe model would</p>
<p>be learned, trained on such a data.</p>
<p>Then it would be better off.</p>
<p>How intelligent is GPT3 do you think?</p>
<p>Like when you think about the nature of intelligence, it</p>
<p>seems exceptionally impressive.</p>
<p>But then if you think about the big AGI problem, is this</p>
<p>footsteps along the way to AGI?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see, it seems that intelligence itself is, there are multiple axis of it.</p>
<p>And I would expect that the systems that we are building, they might end up being</p>
<p>superhuman on some axis and subhuman on some other axis.</p>
<p>It would be surprising to me on all axis simultaneously, they would become superhuman.</p>
<p>Of course, people ask this question, is GPT a spaceship that would take us to</p>
<p>the moon or are we putting a, building a ladder to heaven that we are just</p>
<p>building bigger and bigger ladder.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know in some sense, which one of these two.</p>
<p>Which one is better?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to, I like stairway to heaven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good song.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not exactly sure which one is better, but you&rsquo;re saying like the</p>
<p>spaceship to the moon is actually effective.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So people who criticize GPT, they say, you guys just building a</p>
<p>taller, a ladder, and it will never reach the moon.</p>
<p>And at the moment, I would say the way I&rsquo;m thinking is, is like a scientific question.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also in heart, I&rsquo;m a builder creator and like, I&rsquo;m thinking, let&rsquo;s try out, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see how far it goes.</p>
<p>And so far we see constantly that there is a progress.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So do you think GPT four, GPT five, GPT N plus one will, um, there&rsquo;ll be a phase</p>
<p>shift, like a transition to a, to a place where we&rsquo;ll be truly surprised.</p>
<p>Then again, like GPT three is already very like truly surprising.</p>
<p>The people that criticize GPT three as a stair, as a, what is it?</p>
<p>Ladder to heaven.</p>
<p>I think too quickly get accustomed to how impressive it is that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>impressive, it is that the prediction of the next word can achieve such depth of</p>
<p>semantics, accuracy of syntax, grammar, and semantics.</p>
<p>Um, do you, do you think GPT four and five and six will continue to surprise us?</p>
<p>I mean, definitely there will be more impressive models that there is a</p>
<p>question of course, if there will be a phase shift and, uh, the, also even the</p>
<p>way I&rsquo;m thinking about the, about these models is that when we build these</p>
<p>models, you know, we see some level of the capabilities, but we don&rsquo;t even fully</p>
<p>understand everything that the model can do.</p>
<p>And actually one of the best things to do is to allow other people to probe the</p>
<p>model to even see what is possible.</p>
<p>Hence the, the using GPT as an API and opening it up to the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, so when I&rsquo;m thinking from perspective of like, uh, obviously</p>
<p>various people are, that have concerns about AGI, including myself.</p>
<p>Um, and then when I&rsquo;m thinking from perspective, what&rsquo;s the strategy even to</p>
<p>deploy these things to the world, then the one strategy that I have seen many</p>
<p>times working is that iterative deployment that you deploy, um, slightly</p>
<p>better versions and you allow other people to criticize you.</p>
<p>So you actually, or try it out, you see where are their fundamental issues.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost, you don&rsquo;t want to be in that situation that you are holding</p>
<p>into powerful system and there&rsquo;s like a huge overhang, then you deploy it and it</p>
<p>might have a random chaotic impact on the world.</p>
<p>So you actually want to be in the situation that they are</p>
<p>gradually deploying systems.</p>
<p>I asked this question of Illya, let me ask you, uh, you this question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about Stalin and power.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in possession of a system that&rsquo;s like AGI, that&rsquo;s exceptionally</p>
<p>powerful, do you think your character and integrity might become corrupted?</p>
<p>Like famously power corrupts and absolute power corrupts.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So I believe that the, you want at some point to work toward distributing the power.</p>
<p>I think that the, you want to be in the situation that actually AGI is not</p>
<p>controlled by a small number of people, uh, but, uh, essentially, uh, by a larger</p>
<p>collective.</p>
<p>So the thing is that requires a George Washington style move in the ascent to</p>
<p>power, there&rsquo;s always a moment when somebody gets a lot of power and they</p>
<p>have to have the integrity and, uh, the moral compass to give away that power.</p>
<p>That humans have been good and bad throughout history at this particular</p>
<p>step.</p>
<p>And I wonder, I wonder we like blind ourselves in a, for example, between</p>
<p>nations, a race, uh, towards, um, they, yeah, AI race between nations, we might</p>
<p>blind ourselves and justify to ourselves the development of AI without distributing</p>
<p>the power because we want to defend ourselves against China, against Russia,</p>
<p>that kind of, that kind of logic.</p>
<p>And, um, I wonder how we, um, how we design governance mechanisms that, um,</p>
<p>prevent us from becoming power hungry and in the process, destroying ourselves.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see, I have been thinking about this topic quite a bit, but I also want</p>
<p>to admit that, uh, once again, I actually want to rely way more on Sam Altman on it.</p>
<p>He wrote an excellent blog on how even to distribute wealth.</p>
<p>Um, and he&rsquo;s proper, he proposed in his blog, uh, to tax, uh, equity of the companies</p>
<p>rather than profit and to distribute it.</p>
<p>And this is, this is an example of, uh, Washington move.</p>
<p>I guess I personally have insane trust in some here already spent plenty of money</p>
<p>running, uh, universal basic income, uh, project.</p>
<p>That like, uh, gives me, I guess, maybe some level of trust to him, but I also,</p>
<p>I guess love him as a friend.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wonder because we&rsquo;re sort of summoning a new set of technologies.</p>
<p>I wonder if we&rsquo;ll be, um, cognizant, like you&rsquo;re describing the process of open AI,</p>
<p>but it could also be at other places like in the U S government, right?</p>
<p>Uh, both China and the U S are now full steam ahead on autonomous</p>
<p>weapons systems development.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really worrying to me because in the framework of something being a</p>
<p>national security danger or military danger, you can do a lot of pretty dark</p>
<p>things that blind our moral compass.</p>
<p>And I think AI will be one of those things, um, in some sense, the, the mission</p>
<p>and the work you&rsquo;re doing in open AI is like the counterbalance to that.</p>
<p>So you want to have more open AI and less autonomous weapons systems.</p>
<p>I, I, I, I like these statements, like to be clear, like this interesting and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about it myself, but, uh, this is a place that I, I, I put my trust</p>
<p>actually in Sam&rsquo;s hands, because it&rsquo;s extremely hard for me to reason about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, one important statement to make is, um, it&rsquo;s good to think about this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No question about it.</p>
<p>No question, even like low level quote unquote engineer, like there&rsquo;s such a,</p>
<p>um, I remember I, I programmed a car, uh, our RC car, um, and it was, it was</p>
<p>programmed a car, uh, our RC car, they went really fast, like 30, 40 miles an hour.</p>
<p>And I remember I was like sleep deprived.</p>
<p>So I programmed it pretty crappily and it like, uh, the, the, the code froze.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s doing some basic computer vision and it&rsquo;s going around on track,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s going full speed.</p>
<p>And, uh, there was a bug in the code that, uh, the car just went, it didn&rsquo;t turn.</p>
<p>Went straight full speed and smash into the wall.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking the seriousness with which you need to approach the</p>
<p>design of artificial intelligence systems and the programming of artificial</p>
<p>intelligence systems is high because the consequences are high, like that</p>
<p>little car smashing into the wall.</p>
<p>For some reason, I immediately thought of like an algorithm that controls</p>
<p>nuclear weapons, having the same kind of bug.</p>
<p>And so like the lowest level engineer and the CEO of a company all need to</p>
<p>have the seriousness, uh, in approaching this problem and thinking</p>
<p>about the worst case consequences.</p>
<p>So I think that is true.</p>
<p>I mean, the, what I also recognize in myself and others even asking this</p>
<p>question is that it evokes a lot of fear and fear itself ends up being</p>
<p>actually quite debilitating.</p>
<p>The place where I arrived at the moment might sound cheesy or so, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost to build things out of love rather than fear, like a focus on how, uh, I can,</p>
<p>you know, maximize the value, how the systems that I&rsquo;m building might be, uh,</p>
<p>useful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that the fear doesn&rsquo;t exist out there and like it totally</p>
<p>makes sense to minimize it, but I don&rsquo;t want to be working because, uh, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>scared, I want to be working out of passion, out of curiosity, out of the,</p>
<p>you know, uh, looking forward for the positive future.</p>
<p>With, uh, the definition of love arising from a rigorous practice of empathy.</p>
<p>So not just like your own conception of what is good for the world, but</p>
<p>always listening to others.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Like the love where I&rsquo;m considering reward functions of others.</p>
<p>Others to limit to infinity is like a sum of like one to N where N is, uh,</p>
<p>7 billion or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Not, not projecting my reward functions on others.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can we just take a step back to something else?</p>
<p>Super cool, which is, uh, OpenAI Codex.</p>
<p>Can you give an overview of what OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot is, how it works</p>
<p>and why the hell it works so well?</p>
<p>So with GPT tree, we noticed that the system, uh, you know, that system train</p>
<p>on all the language out there started having some rudimentary coding capabilities.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re able to ask it, you know, to implement addition function between</p>
<p>two numbers and indeed it can write item or JavaScript code for that.</p>
<p>And then we thought, uh, we might as well just go full steam ahead and try to</p>
<p>create a system that is actually good at what we are doing every day ourselves,</p>
<p>which is programming.</p>
<p>We optimize models for proficiency in coding.</p>
<p>We actually even created models that both have a comprehension of language and code.</p>
<p>And Codex is API for these models.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s first pre trained on language and then codex.</p>
<p>Then I don&rsquo;t know if you can say fine tuned because there&rsquo;s a lot of code,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s language and code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s language and code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also optimized for various things.</p>
<p>I can, let&rsquo;s say low latency and so on.</p>
<p>Codex is the API, the similar to GPT tree.</p>
<p>We expect that there will be proliferation of the potential products that can use</p>
<p>coding capabilities and I can, I can speak about it in a second.</p>
<p>Copilot is a first product and developed by GitHub.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re building, uh, models, we wanted to make sure that these</p>
<p>models are useful and we work together with GitHub on building the first product.</p>
<p>Copilot is actually, as you code, it suggests you code completions.</p>
<p>And we have seen in the past, there are like a various tools that can suggest</p>
<p>how to like a few characters of the code or a line of code.</p>
<p>Then the thing about Copilot is it can generate 10 lines of code.</p>
<p>You, it&rsquo;s often the way how it works is you often write in the comment</p>
<p>what you want to happen because people in comments, they describe what happens next.</p>
<p>So, um, these days when I code, instead of going to Google to search, uh, for</p>
<p>the appropriate code to solve my problem, I say, Oh, for this area, could you</p>
<p>smooth it and then, you know, it imports some appropriate libraries and say it</p>
<p>uses NumPy convolution or so I, that I was not even aware that exists and</p>
<p>it does the appropriate thing.</p>
<p>Um, so you, uh, you write a comment, maybe the header of a function</p>
<p>and it completes the function.</p>
<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t know what is the space of all the possible small</p>
<p>programs that can generate.</p>
<p>What are the failure cases?</p>
<p>How many edge cases, how many subtle errors there are, how many big errors</p>
<p>there are, it&rsquo;s hard to know, but the fact that it works at all in a large</p>
<p>number of cases is incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, uh, it&rsquo;s a kind of search engine into code that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been written on the internet.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So for instance, when you search things online, then usually you get to the,</p>
<p>some particular case, like if you go to stack overflow and people describe</p>
<p>that one particular situation, uh, and then they seek for a solution.</p>
<p>But in case of a copilot, it&rsquo;s aware of your entire context and in</p>
<p>context is, Oh, these are the libraries that they are using.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the set of the variables that is initialized.</p>
<p>And on the spot, it can actually tell you what to do.</p>
<p>So the interesting thing is, and we think that the copilot is one</p>
<p>possible product using codecs, but there is a place for many more.</p>
<p>So internally we tried out, you know, to create other fun products.</p>
<p>So it turns out that a lot of tools out there, let&rsquo;s say Google</p>
<p>calendar or Microsoft word or so, they all have a internal API</p>
<p>to build plugins around them.</p>
<p>So there is a way in the sophisticated way to control calendar or Microsoft word.</p>
<p>Today, if you want, if you want more complicated behaviors from these</p>
<p>programs, you have to add the new button for every behavior.</p>
<p>But it is possible to use codecs and tell for instance, to calendar, uh,</p>
<p>could you schedule an appointment with Lex next week after 2 PM and it</p>
<p>writes corresponding piece of code.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing that actually you want.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>So you figure out is there&rsquo;s a lot of programs with which</p>
<p>you can interact through code.</p>
<p>And so there you can generate that code from natural language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s somewhat like also closest to what was the promise of Siri or Alexa.</p>
<p>So previously all these behaviors, they were hard coded and it seems</p>
<p>that codecs on the fly can pick up the API of let&rsquo;s say, given software.</p>
<p>And then it can turn language into use of this API.</p>
<p>So without hard coding, you can find, it can translate to machine language.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>To, uh, so for example, this would be really exciting for me, like for, um,</p>
<p>Adobe products, like Photoshop, uh, which I think action scripted, I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a scripting language that communicates with them, same with Premier.</p>
<p>And do you could imagine that that allows even to do coding by voice on your phone?</p>
<p>So for instance, in the past, okay.</p>
<p>As of today, I&rsquo;m not editing Word documents on my phone because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just the keyboard is too small.</p>
<p>But if I would be able to tell, uh, to my phone, you know, uh, make the</p>
<p>header large, then move the paragraphs around and that&rsquo;s actually what I want.</p>
<p>So I can tell you one more cool thing, or even how I&rsquo;m thinking about codecs.</p>
<p>So if you look actually at the evolution of, uh, of computers, we started with</p>
<p>a very primitive interfaces, which is a punch card and punch card.</p>
<p>So Charlie, you make a holes in the, in the plastic card to indicate zeros and ones.</p>
<p>And, uh, during that time, there was a small number of specialists</p>
<p>who were able to use computers.</p>
<p>And by the way, people even suspected that there is no need for many</p>
<p>more people to use computers.</p>
<p>Um, but then we moved from punch cards to at first assembly and see, and</p>
<p>at these programming languages, they were slightly higher level.</p>
<p>They allowed many more people to code and they also, uh, led to more</p>
<p>of a proliferation of technology.</p>
<p>And, uh, you know, further on, there was a jump to say from C++ to Java and Python.</p>
<p>And every time it has happened, more people are able to code</p>
<p>and we build more technology.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s even, you know, hard to imagine now, if someone will tell you that you</p>
<p>should write code in assembly instead of let&rsquo;s say, Python or Java or JavaScript.</p>
<p>And codecs is yet another step toward kind of bringing computers closer to</p>
<p>humans such that you communicate with a computer with your own language rather</p>
<p>than with a specialized language, and, uh, I think that it will lead to an</p>
<p>increase of number of people who can code.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then, and the kind of technologies that those people will create is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>innumerable, it could, you know, it could be a huge number of technologies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not predicting at all because that&rsquo;s less and less requirement</p>
<p>of having a technical mind, a programming mind, you&rsquo;re not opening it to the world</p>
<p>of, um, other kinds of minds, creative minds, artistic minds, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I would like, for instance, biologists who work on DNA to be able to program</p>
<p>and not to need to spend a lot of time learning it.</p>
<p>And I, I believe that&rsquo;s a good thing to the world.</p>
<p>And I would actually add, I would add, so at the moment I&rsquo;m a managing codecs</p>
<p>team and also language team, and I believe that there is like a plenty</p>
<p>of brilliant people out there and they should have a lot of experience.</p>
<p>There and they should apply.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the language and the codecs is, so those are kind of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re overlapping teams.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like GPT, the raw language, and then the codecs is like applied to programming.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And they are quite intertwined.</p>
<p>There are many more things involved making this, uh, models,</p>
<p>uh, extremely efficient and deployable.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>For instance, there are people who are working to, you know, make our data</p>
<p>centers, uh, amazing, or there are people who work on putting these</p>
<p>models into production or, uh, or even pushing it at the very limit of the scale.</p>
<p>So all aspects from, from the infrastructure to the actual machine.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just saying there are multiple teams while the, and the team working</p>
<p>on codecs and language, uh, I guess I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m directly managing them.</p>
<p>I would like, I would love to hire more interested in machine learning.</p>
<p>This is probably one of the most exciting problems and like systems</p>
<p>to be working on is it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Like what, what, uh, the program synthesis, like generating a</p>
<p>programs is very interesting, very interesting problem that has echoes</p>
<p>of reasoning and intelligence in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s and I think there&rsquo;s a lot of fundamental questions that you might</p>
<p>be able to sneak, uh, sneak up to by generating programs.</p>
<p>Yeah, that one more exciting thing about the programs is that, so I said</p>
<p>that the, um, you know, the, in case of language, that one of the travels</p>
<p>is even evaluating language.</p>
<p>So when the things are made up, you, you need somehow either a human to,</p>
<p>to say that this doesn&rsquo;t make sense or so in case of program, there is one extra</p>
<p>lever that we can actually execute programs and see what they evaluate to.</p>
<p>So that process might be somewhat, uh, more automated in, in order to improve</p>
<p>the, uh, qualities of generations.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So like the, wow, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So, so for the language, the, you know, the simulation to actually</p>
<p>execute it as a human mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For programs, there is a, there is a computer on which you can evaluate it.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a brilliant little insight.</p>
<p>Insight that the thing compiles and runs that&rsquo;s first and second, you can evaluate</p>
<p>on a, like do automated unit testing and in some sense, it seems to me that we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to make a tremendous progress.</p>
<p>You know, we are in the paradigm that there is way more data.</p>
<p>There is like a transcription of millions of, uh, of, uh, software engineers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, uh, I mean, you just mean, cause I was going to ask you about reliability.</p>
<p>The thing about programs is you don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re going to, like a program</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s controlling a nuclear power plant has to be very reliable.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t start with controlling nuclear power plant maybe one day,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not actually, that&rsquo;s not on the current roadmap.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the step one.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s the Russian thing.</p>
<p>You just want to go to the most powerful, destructive, most powerful</p>
<p>the most powerful, destructive thing right away run by JavaScript.</p>
<p>But I got you.</p>
<p>So this is a lower impact, but nevertheless, when you make me</p>
<p>realize it is possible to achieve some levels of reliability by doing testing.</p>
<p>And you could, you could imagine that, you know, maybe there are ways for</p>
<p>model to write event code for testing itself and so on, and there exists</p>
<p>a ways to create the feedback loops that the model could keep on improving.</p>
<p>Yeah. By writing programs that generate tests for the instance, for instance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we get consciousness, because it&rsquo;s metacompression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to write.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the comment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the prompt that generates consciousness.</p>
<p>Compressor of compressors.</p>
<p>You just write that.</p>
<p>Do you think the code that generates consciousness will be simple?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately, the core idea behind will be simple,</p>
<p>but there will be also decent amount of engineering involved.</p>
<p>Like in some sense, it seems that, you know, spreading these models</p>
<p>on many machines, it&rsquo;s not that trivial.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we find all sorts of innovations that make our models more efficient.</p>
<p>I believe that first models that I guess are conscious or like a truly intelligent,</p>
<p>they will have all sorts of tricks, but then again, there&rsquo;s a Richard Sutton</p>
<p>argument that maybe the tricks are temporary things that they might be</p>
<p>temporary things and in some sense, it&rsquo;s also even important to, to know</p>
<p>that even the cost of a trick.</p>
<p>So sometimes people are eager to put the trick while forgetting that</p>
<p>there is a cost of maintenance or like a long term cost, long term cost</p>
<p>or maintenance, or maybe even flexibility of code to actually implement new ideas.</p>
<p>So even if you have something that gives you 2x, but it requires, you know,</p>
<p>1000 lines of code, I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s actually worth it.</p>
<p>So in some sense, you know, if it&rsquo;s five lines of code and 2x, I would take it.</p>
<p>And we see many of this, but also, you know, that requires some level of,</p>
<p>I guess, lack of attachment to code that we are willing to remove it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you led the OpenAI robotics team.</p>
<p>Can you give an overview of the cool things you were able to</p>
<p>accomplish, what are you most proud of?</p>
<p>So when we started robotics, we knew that actually reinforcement learning works</p>
<p>and it is possible to solve fairly complicated problems.</p>
<p>Like for instance, AlphaGo is an evidence that it is possible to build superhuman</p>
<p>Go players, DOTA2 is an evidence that it&rsquo;s possible to build superhuman agents</p>
<p>playing DOTA, so I asked myself a question, you know, what about robots out there?</p>
<p>Could we train machines to solve arbitrary tasks in the physical world?</p>
<p>Our approach was, I guess, let&rsquo;s pick a complicated problem that if we would</p>
<p>solve it, that means that we made some significant progress in the domain.</p>
<p>And if can progress the domain, and then we went after the problem.</p>
<p>So we noticed that actually the robots out there, they are kind of at the moment</p>
<p>optimized per task, so you can have a robot that it&rsquo;s like, if you have a robot</p>
<p>opening a bottle, it&rsquo;s very likely that the end factor is that bottle opener.</p>
<p>And the, and in some sense, that&rsquo;s a hack to be able to solve a task,</p>
<p>which makes any task easier and ask myself, so what would be a robot that</p>
<p>can actually solve many tasks?</p>
<p>And we conclude that human hands have such a quality that indeed they are, you</p>
<p>know, you have five kind of tiny arms attached individually.</p>
<p>They can manipulate pretty broad spectrum of objects.</p>
<p>So we went after a single hand, like trying to solve Rubik&rsquo;s cube single handed.</p>
<p>We picked this task because we thought that there is no way to hard code it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, we picked the robot on which it would be hard to hard code it.</p>
<p>And we went after the solution such that it could generalize to other problems.</p>
<p>And just to clarify, it&rsquo;s one robotic hand solving the Rubik&rsquo;s cube.</p>
<p>The hard part isn&rsquo;t the solution to the Rubik&rsquo;s cube is the manipulation of the,</p>
<p>of like having it not fall out of the hand, having it use the, uh, five baby</p>
<p>arms to, uh, what is it like rotate different parts of the Rubik&rsquo;s cube to</p>
<p>achieve the solution.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what, uh, what was the hardest part about that?</p>
<p>What was the approach taken there?</p>
<p>What are you most proud of?</p>
<p>Obviously we have like a strong belief in reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>And, uh, you know, one path it is to do reinforcement learning, the real</p>
<p>world other path is to, uh, uh, that simulation in some sense, the tricky</p>
<p>part about the real world is at the moment, our models, they require a lot</p>
<p>of data and there is essentially no data.</p>
<p>And, uh, I did, we decided to go through the path of the simulation.</p>
<p>And in simulation, you can have infinite amount of data.</p>
<p>The tricky part is the fidelity of the simulation.</p>
<p>And also can you in simulation represent everything that you represent</p>
<p>otherwise in the real world.</p>
<p>And, you know, it turned out that, uh, that, you know, because there is</p>
<p>lack of fidelity, it is possible to what we, what we arrived at is training</p>
<p>a model that doesn&rsquo;t solve one simulation, but it actually solves the</p>
<p>entire range of simulations, which, uh, uh, in terms of like, uh, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the, exactly the friction of the cube or the weight or so, and the single AI</p>
<p>that can solve all of them ends up working well with the reality.</p>
<p>How do you generate the different simulations?</p>
<p>So, uh, you know, there&rsquo;s plenty of parameters out there.</p>
<p>We just pick them randomly.</p>
<p>And, uh, and in simulation model just goes for thousands of years and keeps</p>
<p>on solving Rubik&rsquo;s cube in each of them.</p>
<p>And the thing is that neural network that we used, it has a memory.</p>
<p>And as it presses, for instance, the side of the, of the cube, it can sense,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s actually, this side was, uh, difficult to press.</p>
<p>I should press it stronger and throughout this process kind of, uh, learn it&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>how to, uh, how to solve this particular instance of the Rubik&rsquo;s cube, like even</p>
<p>mass, it&rsquo;s kind of like, uh, you know, sometimes when you go to a gym and after,</p>
<p>um, after bench press, you try to leave the class and you kind of forgot, uh, and,</p>
<p>and your head goes like up right away because kind of you got used to maybe</p>
<p>different weight and it takes a second to adjust and this kind of, of a memory,</p>
<p>the model gained through the process of interacting with the cube in the</p>
<p>simulation, I appreciate you speaking to the audience with the bench press,</p>
<p>all the bros in the audience, probably working out right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably somebody listening to this actually doing bench press.</p>
<p>Um, so maybe, uh, put the bar down and pick up the water bottle and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>know exactly what, uh, what Jack is talking about.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what, uh, what was the hardest part of getting the whole thing to work?</p>
<p>So the hardest part is at the moment when it comes to, uh, physical work, when it</p>
<p>comes to robots, uh, they require maintenance, it&rsquo;s hard to replicate a</p>
<p>million times it&rsquo;s, uh, it&rsquo;s also, it&rsquo;s hard to replay things exactly.</p>
<p>I remember this situation that one guy at our company, he had like a model that</p>
<p>performs way better than other models in solving Rubik&rsquo;s cube.</p>
<p>And, uh, you know, we kind of didn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on, why it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And, uh, it turned out, uh, that, you know, he was running it from his laptop</p>
<p>that had better CPU or better, maybe local GPU as well.</p>
<p>And, uh, because of that, there was less of a latency and the model was the same.</p>
<p>And that actually made solving Rubik&rsquo;s cube more reliable.</p>
<p>So in some sense, there might be some subtle bugs like that when it comes</p>
<p>to running things in the real world.</p>
<p>Even hinting on that, you could imagine that the initial models you would like</p>
<p>to have models, which are insanely huge neural networks, and you would like to</p>
<p>give them even more time for thinking.</p>
<p>And when you have these real time systems, uh, then you might be constrained</p>
<p>actually by the amount of latency.</p>
<p>And, uh, ultimately I would like to build a system that it is worth for you to wait</p>
<p>five minutes because it gives you the answer that you&rsquo;re willing to wait for</p>
<p>five minutes.</p>
<p>So latency is a very unpleasant constraint under which to operate.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And also there is actually one more thing, which is tricky about robots.</p>
<p>Uh, there is actually, uh, no, uh, not much data.</p>
<p>So the data that I&rsquo;m speaking about would be a data of, uh, first person</p>
<p>experience from the robot and like a gigabytes of data like that, if we would</p>
<p>have gigabytes of data like that, of robots solving various problems, it would</p>
<p>be very easy to make a progress on robotics.</p>
<p>And you can see that in case of text or code, there is a lot of data, like a</p>
<p>first person perspective, they don&rsquo;t writing code.</p>
<p>Yeah. So you had this, you mentioned this really interesting idea that if you were</p>
<p>to build like a successful robotics company, so open as mission is much</p>
<p>bigger than robotics, this is one of the, one of the things you&rsquo;ve worked on, but</p>
<p>if it was a robotics company, they, you wouldn&rsquo;t so quickly dismiss supervised</p>
<p>learning, uh, correct that you would build a robot that, uh, was perhaps what</p>
<p>like, um, an empty shell, like dumb, and they would operate under teleoperation.</p>
<p>So you would invest, that&rsquo;s just one way to do it, invest in human supervision,</p>
<p>like direct human control of the robots as it&rsquo;s learning and over time, add</p>
<p>more and more automation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s how I would build a robotics company today.</p>
<p>If I would be building a robotics company, which is, you know, spend 10</p>
<p>million dollars or so recording human trajectories, controlling a robot.</p>
<p>After you find a thing that the robot should be doing, that there&rsquo;s a market</p>
<p>fit for, like you can make a lot of money with that product.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, so I would record data and then I would essentially train supervised</p>
<p>learning model on it.</p>
<p>That might be the path today.</p>
<p>Long term.</p>
<p>I think that actually what is needed is to have a robot that can</p>
<p>train powerful models over video.</p>
<p>So, um, you have seen maybe a models that can generate images like Dali and people</p>
<p>are looking into models, generating videos, they&rsquo;re like, uh, bodies,</p>
<p>algorithmic questions, even how to do it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unclear if there is enough compute for this purpose, but, uh, I, I</p>
<p>suspect that the models that which would have a level of understanding of video,</p>
<p>same as GPT has a level of understanding of text, could be used, uh, to train</p>
<p>robots to solve tasks.</p>
<p>They would have a lot of common sense.</p>
<p>If one day, I&rsquo;m pretty sure one day there will be a robotics company by robotics</p>
<p>company, I mean, the primary source of income is, is from robots that is worth</p>
<p>over $1 trillion.</p>
<p>What do you think that company will do?</p>
<p>I think self driving cars.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Cause my mind went to personal robotics, robots in the home.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s much more market opportunity there.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>I mean, this, this, this might speak to something important, which is I understand</p>
<p>self driving much better than understand robotics in the home.</p>
<p>So I understand how difficult it is to actually solve self driving to a, to a</p>
<p>level, not just the actual computer vision and the control problem and just the</p>
<p>basic problem of self driving, but creating a product that would undeniably</p>
<p>be, um, that will cost less money.</p>
<p>Like it will save you a lot of money, like orders of magnitude, less money</p>
<p>that could replace Uber drivers, for example.</p>
<p>So car sharing that&rsquo;s autonomous, that creates a similar or better</p>
<p>experience in terms of how quickly you get from A to B or just whatever, the</p>
<p>pleasantness of the experience, the efficiency of the experience, the value</p>
<p>of the experience, and at the same time, the car itself costs cheaper.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot more, um, low hanging fruit in the home.</p>
<p>That, that, that could be, I also want to give you a perspective on like how</p>
<p>challenging it would be at home or like it maybe kind of depends on that exact</p>
<p>problem that you&rsquo;d be solving.</p>
<p>Like if we&rsquo;re speaking about these robotic arms and hands, these things,</p>
<p>they cost tens of thousands of dollars or maybe a hundred K and, um, you know,</p>
<p>maybe, obviously, maybe there would be economy of scale.</p>
<p>These things would be cheaper, but actually for any household to buy it,</p>
<p>the price would have to go down to maybe a thousand bucks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I personally think that, uh, so self driving car, it provides a clear service.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think robots in the home, there&rsquo;ll be a trillion dollar company</p>
<p>will just be all about service, meaning it will not necessarily be about like</p>
<p>a robotic arm that&rsquo;s helps you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, open a bottle or wash the dishes or, uh, any of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It has to be able to take care of that whole, the therapist thing.</p>
<p>You mentioned, I think that&rsquo;s, um, of course there&rsquo;s a line between what</p>
<p>is a robot and what is not like, does it really need a body?</p>
<p>But you know, some, um, uh, AI system with some embodiment, I think.</p>
<p>So the tricky part when you think actually what&rsquo;s the difficult part is,</p>
<p>um, when the robot has like, when there is a diversity of the environment</p>
<p>with which the robot has to interact, that becomes hard.</p>
<p>So, you know, on the one spectrum, you have, uh, industrial robots as they</p>
<p>are doing over and over the same thing, it is possible to some extent to</p>
<p>prescribe the movements and we&rsquo;ve very small amount of intelligence, the, the</p>
<p>movement can be repeated millions of times.</p>
<p>Um, the, it, there are also, you know, various pieces of industrial robots</p>
<p>where it becomes harder and harder.</p>
<p>I can, for instance, in case of Tesla, it might be a matter of putting a, a</p>
<p>rack inside of a car and, you know, because the rack kind of moves around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, uh, it&rsquo;s not that easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly the same every time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not being the case that you need actually humans to do it.</p>
<p>Uh, while, you know, welding cars together, it&rsquo;s a very repetitive process.</p>
<p>Um, then in case of self driving itself, uh, that difficulty has to do with the</p>
<p>diversity of the environment, but still the car itself, um, the problem</p>
<p>that they are solving is you try to avoid even interacting with things.</p>
<p>You are not touching anything around because touching itself is hard.</p>
<p>And then if you would have in the home, uh, robot that, you know, has to</p>
<p>touch things and like if these things, they change the shape, if there is a huge</p>
<p>variety of things to be touched, then that&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>If you are speaking about the robot, which there is, you know, head that</p>
<p>is smiling in some way with cameras that either doesn&rsquo;t, you know, touch things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s relatively simple.</p>
<p>Okay. So to both agree and to push back.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re referring to touch, like soft robotics, like the actual touch, but.</p>
<p>I would argue that you could formulate just basic interaction between, um, like</p>
<p>non contact interaction is also a kind of touch and that might be very difficult</p>
<p>to solve that&rsquo;s the basic, this not disagreement, but that&rsquo;s the basic open</p>
<p>question to me with self driving cars and this agreement with Elon, which</p>
<p>is how much interaction is required to solve self driving cars.</p>
<p>How much touch is required?</p>
<p>You said that in your intuition, touch is not required.</p>
<p>And my intuition to create a product that&rsquo;s compelling to use, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have to, uh, interact with pedestrians, not just avoid pedestrians,</p>
<p>but interact with them when we drive around.</p>
<p>In major cities, we&rsquo;re constantly threatening everybody&rsquo;s life with</p>
<p>our movements, um, and that&rsquo;s how they respect us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a game to ready going out with pedestrians and I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just formulate autonomous driving as a collision avoidance problem.</p>
<p>So I think it goes beyond like a collision avoidance is the</p>
<p>first order approximation.</p>
<p>Uh, but then at least in case of Tesla, you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>at least in case of Tesla, they are gathering data from people driving their</p>
<p>cars and I believe that&rsquo;s an example of supervised data that they can train</p>
<p>their models, uh, on, and they are doing it, uh, which, you know, can give</p>
<p>a model dislike, uh, another level of, uh, of, uh, behavior that is needed</p>
<p>to actually interact with the real world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how much data is required to achieve that.</p>
<p>Um, w what do you think of the whole Tesla autopilot approach, the computer</p>
<p>vision based approach with multiple cameras and there&rsquo;s a data engine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a multitask, multiheaded neural network, and it&rsquo;s this fascinating</p>
<p>process of, uh, similar to what you&rsquo;re talking about with the robotics</p>
<p>approach, uh, which is, you know, you deploy in your own network and</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s humans that use it and then it runs into trouble in a bunch</p>
<p>of places and that stuff is sent back.</p>
<p>So like the deployment discovers a bunch of edge cases and those edge</p>
<p>cases are sent back for supervised annotation, thereby improving the</p>
<p>neural network and that&rsquo;s deployed again.</p>
<p>It goes over and over until the network becomes really good at the task of</p>
<p>driving becomes safer and safer.</p>
<p>What do you think of that kind of approach to robotics?</p>
<p>I believe that&rsquo;s the way to go.</p>
<p>So in some sense, even when I was speaking about, you know, collecting</p>
<p>trajectories from humans, that&rsquo;s like a first step and then you deploy</p>
<p>the system and then you have humans revising the, all the issues.</p>
<p>And in some sense, like at this approach converges to system that doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>mistakes because for the cases where there are mistakes, you got their</p>
<p>data, how to fix them and the system will keep on improving.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very, to me, difficult question of how hard that, you know,</p>
<p>how long that converging takes, how hard it is.</p>
<p>The other aspect of autonomous vehicles, this probably applies to certain</p>
<p>robotics applications is society, right?</p>
<p>They put as, as the quality of the system converges.</p>
<p>So one, there&rsquo;s a human factors perspective of psychology of humans being</p>
<p>able to supervise those even with teleoperation, those robots.</p>
<p>And the other is society willing to accept robots.</p>
<p>Currently society is much harsher on self driving cars than it is on human</p>
<p>driven cars in terms of the expectation of safety.</p>
<p>So the bar is set much higher than for humans.</p>
<p>And so if there&rsquo;s a death in an autonomous vehicle, that&rsquo;s seen as a much more,</p>
<p>much more dramatic than a death in the human driven vehicle.</p>
<p>Part of the success of deployment of robots is figuring out how to make robots</p>
<p>part of society, both on the, just the human side, on the media side, on the</p>
<p>media journalist side, and also on the policy government side.</p>
<p>And that seems to be, maybe you can put that into the objective function to</p>
<p>optimize, but that is, that is definitely a tricky one.</p>
<p>And I wonder if that is actually the trickiest part for self driving cars or</p>
<p>any system that&rsquo;s safety critical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the algorithm, it&rsquo;s the society accepting it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say, I believe that the part of the process of deployment is actually</p>
<p>showing people that the given things can be trusted and, you know, trust is also</p>
<p>like a glass that is actually really easy to crack it and damage it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually very common with, with innovation, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some resistance toward it and it&rsquo;s just the natural progression.</p>
<p>So in some sense, people will have to keep on proving that indeed these</p>
<p>systems are worth being used.</p>
<p>And I would say, I also found out that often the best way to convince people</p>
<p>is by letting them experience it.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the case with Tesla autopilot, for example, that&rsquo;s the case with, yeah,</p>
<p>with basically robots in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny to hear people talk about robots.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of fear, even with like legged robots, but when they</p>
<p>actually interact with them, there&rsquo;s joy.</p>
<p>I love interacting with them.</p>
<p>And the same with the car, with a robot, if it starts being useful, I think</p>
<p>people immediately understand.</p>
<p>And if the product is designed well, they fall in love.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually even similar when I&rsquo;m thinking about the car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually even similar when I&rsquo;m thinking about Copilot, the GitHub Copilot.</p>
<p>There was a spectrum of responses that people had.</p>
<p>And ultimately the important piece was to let people try it out.</p>
<p>And then many people just loved it.</p>
<p>Especially like programmers.</p>
<p>Yeah, programmers, but like some of them, you know, they came with a fear.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But then you try it out and you think, actually, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>And, you know, you can try to resist the same way as, you know, you could</p>
<p>resist moving from punch cards to, let&rsquo;s say, C++ or so.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little bit futile.</p>
<p>So we talked about generation of program, generation of language, even</p>
<p>self supervised learning in the visual space for robotics and then</p>
<p>reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>What do you, in like this whole beautiful spectrum of AI, do you think is a</p>
<p>good benchmark, a good test to strive for to achieve intelligence?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a strong test of intelligence.</p>
<p>You know, it started with Alan Turing and the Turing test.</p>
<p>Maybe you think natural language conversation is a good test.</p>
<p>So, you know, it would be nice if, for instance, machine would be able to</p>
<p>solve Riemann hypothesis in math.</p>
<p>That would be, I think that would be very impressive.</p>
<p>So theorem proving, is that to you, proving theorems is a good, oh, oh,</p>
<p>like one thing that the machine did, you would say, damn.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That would be quite, quite impressive.</p>
<p>I mean, the tricky part about the benchmarks is, you know, as we are</p>
<p>getting closer with them, we have to invent new benchmarks.</p>
<p>There is actually no ultimate benchmark out there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, my thought with the Riemann hypothesis would be the moment the</p>
<p>machine proves it, we would say, okay, well then the problem was easy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>And I mean, in some sense, that&rsquo;s actually what happens over the years</p>
<p>in AI that like, we get used to things very quickly.</p>
<p>You know something, I talked to Rodney Brooks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who that is.</p>
<p>He called AlphaZero homework problem.</p>
<p>Cause he was saying like, there&rsquo;s nothing special about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a big leap.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t, well, he&rsquo;s coming from one of the aspects that we referred</p>
<p>to is he was part of the founding of iRobot, which deployed now tens</p>
<p>of millions of robot in the home.</p>
<p>So if you see robots that are actually in the homes of people as the</p>
<p>legitimate instantiation of artificial intelligence, then yes, maybe an AI</p>
<p>that plays a silly game like go and chess is not a real accomplishment,</p>
<p>but to me it&rsquo;s a fundamental leap.</p>
<p>But I think we as humans then say, okay, well then that that game of</p>
<p>chess or go wasn&rsquo;t that difficult compared to the thing that&rsquo;s currently</p>
<p>unsolved.</p>
<p>So my intuition is that from perspective of the evolution of these AI</p>
<p>systems will at first seen the tremendous progress in digital space.</p>
<p>And the, you know, the main thing about digital space is also that you</p>
<p>can, everything is that there is a lot of recorded data.</p>
<p>Plus you can very rapidly deploy things to billions of people.</p>
<p>While in case of a physical space, the deployment part takes multiple</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>You have to manufacture things and, you know, delivering it to actual</p>
<p>people, it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m expecting that the first and that prices in digital space of</p>
<p>goods, they would go, you know, down to the, let&rsquo;s say marginal costs</p>
<p>are two zero.</p>
<p>And also the question is how much of our life will be in digital because</p>
<p>it seems like we&rsquo;re heading towards more and more of our lives being in</p>
<p>the digital space.</p>
<p>So like innovation in the physical space might become less and less</p>
<p>significant.</p>
<p>Like why do you need to drive anywhere if most of your life is spent in</p>
<p>virtual reality?</p>
<p>I still would like, you know, to at least at the moment, my impression</p>
<p>is that I would like to have a physical contact with other people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very important to me.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a way to replicate it in the computer.</p>
<p>It might be the case that over the time it will change.</p>
<p>Like in 10 years from now, why not have like an arbitrary infinite number</p>
<p>of people you can interact with?</p>
<p>Some of them are real, some are not with arbitrary characteristics that</p>
<p>you can define based on your own preferences.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s maybe where we are heading and maybe I&rsquo;m resisting the</p>
<p>future.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m telling you, if I got to choose, if I could live in Elder</p>
<p>Scrolls Skyrim versus the real world, I&rsquo;m not so sure I would stay with</p>
<p>the real world.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the question is, so will VR be sufficient to get us there</p>
<p>or do you need to, you know, plug electrodes in the brain?</p>
<p>And it would be nice if these electrodes wouldn&rsquo;t be invasive.</p>
<p>Or at least like provably non destructive.</p>
<p>But in the digital space, do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to solve the</p>
<p>Turing test, the spirit of the Turing test, which is, do you think we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to achieve compelling natural language conversation between</p>
<p>people, like have friends that are AI systems on the internet?</p>
<p>I totally think it&rsquo;s doable.</p>
<p>Do you think the current approach of GPT will take us there?</p>
<p>So there is, you know, the part of at first learning all the content</p>
<p>out there and I think that Steel System should keep on learning as</p>
<p>it speaks with you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that should work.</p>
<p>The question is how exactly to do it.</p>
<p>And, you know, obviously we have people at OpenAI asking these</p>
<p>questions and kind of at first pre training on all existing content</p>
<p>is like a backbone and is a decent backbone.</p>
<p>Do you think AI needs a body connecting to our robotics question to</p>
<p>truly connect with humans or can most of the connection be in the</p>
<p>digital space?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see, we know that there are people who met each other online</p>
<p>and they fell in love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it seems that it&rsquo;s conceivable to establish connection, which is</p>
<p>purely through internet.</p>
<p>Of course, it might be more compelling the more modalities you add.</p>
<p>So it would be like you&rsquo;re proposing like a Tinder, but for AI, you</p>
<p>like swipe right and left and half the systems are AI and the other is</p>
<p>humans and you don&rsquo;t know which is which.</p>
<p>That would be our formulation of Turing test.</p>
<p>The moment AI is able to achieve more swipe right or left, whatever,</p>
<p>the moment it&rsquo;s able to be more attractive than other humans, it</p>
<p>passes the Turing test.</p>
<p>Then you would pass the Turing test in attractiveness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Well, no, like attractiveness just to clarify.</p>
<p>There will be conversation.</p>
<p>Not just visual.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also attractiveness with wit and humor and whatever makes</p>
<p>conversation is pleasant for humans.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s possible to achieve in the digital space.</p>
<p>In some sense, I would almost ask that question.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t that be possible?</p>
<p>Well, I have this argument with my dad all the time.</p>
<p>He thinks that touch and smell are really important.</p>
<p>So they can be very important.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying the initial systems, they won&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>Still, there are people being born without these senses and I believe</p>
<p>that they can still fall in love and have meaningful life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to go close to all the way by just training</p>
<p>on transcripts of conversations.</p>
<p>I wonder how far that takes us.</p>
<p>So I think that actually still you want images like I would like.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have kids, but like I could imagine having AI Tutor.</p>
<p>It has to see, you know, kids drawing some pictures on the paper.</p>
<p>And also facial expressions, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>We use dogs and humans use their eyes to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really powerful mechanism of communication.</p>
<p>Body language too, that words are much lower bandwidth.</p>
<p>And for body language, we still, you know, we kind of have a system</p>
<p>that displays an image of its or facial expression on the computer.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have to move, you know, mechanical pieces or so.</p>
<p>So I think that, you know, that there is like kind of a progression.</p>
<p>You can imagine that text might be the simplest to tackle.</p>
<p>But this is not a complete human experience at all.</p>
<p>You expand it to, let&rsquo;s say images, both for input and output.</p>
<p>And what you describe is actually the final, I guess, frontier.</p>
<p>What makes us human, the fact that we can touch each other or smell or so.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the hardest from perspective of data and deployment.</p>
<p>And I believe that these things might happen gradually.</p>
<p>Are you excited by that possibility?</p>
<p>This particular application of human to AI friendship and interaction?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Like would you, do you look forward to a world?</p>
<p>You said you&rsquo;re living with a few folks and you&rsquo;re very close friends with them.</p>
<p>Do you look forward to a day where one or two of those friends are AI systems?</p>
<p>So if the system would be truly wishing me well, rather than being in the situation</p>
<p>that it optimizes for my time to interact with the system.</p>
<p>The line between those is, it&rsquo;s a gray area.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the distinction between love and possession.</p>
<p>And these things, they might be often correlated for humans, but you might find that there are</p>
<p>some friends with whom you haven&rsquo;t spoke for months.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you pick up the phone, it&rsquo;s as the time hasn&rsquo;t passed.</p>
<p>They are not holding to you.</p>
<p>And I will, I wouldn&rsquo;t like to have AI system that, you know, it&rsquo;s trying to convince me</p>
<p>to spend time with it.</p>
<p>I would like the system to optimize for what I care about and help me in achieving my own goals.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s some manipulation, there&rsquo;s some possessiveness,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some insecurities, this fragility, all those things are necessary to form a close</p>
<p>friendship over time, to go through some dark shit together, some bliss and happiness together.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of greedy self centered behavior within that process.</p>
<p>My intuition, but I might be wrong, is that human computer interaction doesn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>go through a computer being greedy, possessive, and so on.</p>
<p>It is possible to train systems, maybe, that they actually</p>
<p>they are, I guess, prompted or fine tuned or so to truly optimize for what you care about.</p>
<p>And you could imagine that, you know, the way how the process would look like is at</p>
<p>some point, we as humans, we look at the transcript of the conversation or like an entire</p>
<p>interaction and we say, actually here, there was more loving way to go about it.</p>
<p>And we supervise system toward being more loving, or maybe we train the system such</p>
<p>that it has a reward function toward being more loving.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or maybe the possibility of the system being an asshole and manipulative and possessive</p>
<p>every once in a while is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Because some of the happiness that we experience when two souls meet each other, when two humans</p>
<p>meet each other, is a kind of break from the assholes in the world.</p>
<p>And so you need assholes in AI as well, because, like, it&rsquo;ll be like a breath of fresh air</p>
<p>to discover an AI that the three previous AIs you had are too friendly or no, or cruel</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some kind of mix.</p>
<p>And then this one is just right, but you need to experience the full spectrum.</p>
<p>Like, I think you need to be able to engineer assholes.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s some level to us being appreciated to appreciate the human experience.</p>
<p>We need the dark and the light.</p>
<p>So that kind of reminds me.</p>
<p>I met a while ago at the meditation retreat, one woman, and she told me, you know,</p>
<p>beautiful, beautiful woman, and she had a she had a crutch.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She had the trouble walking on one leg.</p>
<p>I asked her what has happened.</p>
<p>And she said that five years ago she was in Maui, Hawaii, and she was eating a salad and</p>
<p>some snail fell into the salad.</p>
<p>And apparently there are neurotoxic snails over there.</p>
<p>And she got into coma for a year.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And apparently there is, you know, high chance of even just dying.</p>
<p>But she was in the coma.</p>
<p>At some point, she regained partially consciousness.</p>
<p>She was able to hear people in the room.</p>
<p>People behave as she wouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>You know, at some point she started being able to speak, but she was mumbling like a</p>
<p>barely able to express herself.</p>
<p>Then at some point she got into wheelchair.</p>
<p>Then at some point she actually noticed that she can move her toe and then she knew that</p>
<p>she will be able to walk.</p>
<p>And then, you know, that&rsquo;s where she was five years after.</p>
<p>And she said that since then she appreciates the fact that she can move her toe.</p>
<p>And I was thinking, hmm, do I need to go through such experience to appreciate that I have</p>
<p>I can move my toe?</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a really good story and really deep example.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And in some sense, it might be the case that we don&rsquo;t see light if we haven&rsquo;t went through</p>
<p>the darkness.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t say that we should.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t assume that that&rsquo;s the case, which it may be able to engineer shortcuts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ilya had this, you know, belief that maybe one has to go for a week or six months to</p>
<p>do some challenging camp to just experience, you know, a lot of difficulties and then comes</p>
<p>back and actually everything is bright, everything is beautiful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Ilya on this.</p>
<p>It must be a Russian thing.</p>
<p>Where are you from originally?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Polish.</p>
<p>Polish.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to say that explains a lot.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s something about the Russian, the necessity of suffering.</p>
<p>I believe suffering or rather struggle is necessary.</p>
<p>I believe that struggle is necessary.</p>
<p>I mean, in some sense, you even look at the story of any superhero in the movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it was like everything goes easy, easy, easy, easy.</p>
<p>I like how that&rsquo;s your ground truth is the story of superheroes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You mentioned that you used to do research at night and go to bed at like 6 a.m.</p>
<p>or 7 a.m.</p>
<p>I still do that often.</p>
<p>What sleep schedules have you tried to make for a productive and happy life?</p>
<p>Like, is there is there some interesting wild sleeping patterns that you engaged that you</p>
<p>found that works really well for you?</p>
<p>I tried at some point decreasing number of hours of sleep like a gradually like a half</p>
<p>an hour every few days to this.</p>
<p>You know, I was hoping to just save time.</p>
<p>That clearly didn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>Like at some point, there&rsquo;s like a phase shift and I felt tired all the time.</p>
<p>You know, there was a time that I used to work during the nights.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the nights is that no one disturbs you.</p>
<p>And even I remember when I was meeting for the first time with Greg Brockman, his</p>
<p>CTO and chairman of OpenAI, our meeting was scheduled to 5 p.m.</p>
<p>And I overstepped for the meeting.</p>
<p>Over slept for the meeting at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Yeah, now you sound like me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>OK, yeah.</p>
<p>And at the moment, in some sense, my sleeping schedule also has to do with the fact that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interacting with people.</p>
<p>I sleep without an alarm.</p>
<p>So, yeah, the the team thing you mentioned, the extrovert thing, because most humans operate</p>
<p>during a certain set of hours, you&rsquo;re forced to then operate at the same set of hours.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not quite there yet.</p>
<p>I found a lot of joy, just like you said, working through the night because it&rsquo;s quiet</p>
<p>because the world doesn&rsquo;t disturb you.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some aspect counter to everything you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some joyful aspect to sleeping through the mess of the day because people are having</p>
<p>people are having meetings and sending emails and there&rsquo;s drama meetings.</p>
<p>I can sleep through all the meetings.</p>
<p>You know, I have meetings every day and they prevent me from having sufficient amount of</p>
<p>time for focused work.</p>
<p>And then I modified my calendar and I said that I&rsquo;m out of office Wednesday, Thursday</p>
<p>and Friday every day and I&rsquo;m having meetings only Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>And that busty positively influenced my mood that I have literally like at three days for</p>
<p>fully focused work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s better solutions to this problem than staying awake all night.</p>
<p>OK, you&rsquo;ve been part of development of some of the greatest ideas in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>What would you say is your process for developing good novel ideas?</p>
<p>You have to be aware that clearly there are many other brilliant people around.</p>
<p>So you have to ask yourself a question, why the given idea, let&rsquo;s say, wasn&rsquo;t tried by</p>
<p>someone else and in some sense, it has to do with, you know, kind of simple.</p>
<p>It might sound simple, but like a thinking outside of the box.</p>
<p>And what do I mean here?</p>
<p>So, for instance, for a while, people in academia, they assumed that you have a feeling that</p>
<p>you have a fixed data set and then you optimize the algorithms in order to get the best performance.</p>
<p>And that was so in great assumption that no one thought about training models on</p>
<p>anti internet or like that.</p>
<p>Maybe some people thought about it, but it felt to many as unfair.</p>
<p>And in some sense, that&rsquo;s almost like a it&rsquo;s not my idea or so, but that&rsquo;s an example of</p>
<p>breaking at the typical assumption.</p>
<p>So you want to be in the paradigm that you&rsquo;re breaking at the typical assumption.</p>
<p>In the context of the community, getting to pick your data set is cheating.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And in some sense, so that was that was assumption that many people had out there.</p>
<p>And then if you free yourself from assumptions, then they are likely to achieve something</p>
<p>that others cannot do.</p>
<p>And in some sense, if you are trying to do exactly the same things as others, it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>likely that you&rsquo;re going to have the same results.</p>
<p>Yeah, I but there&rsquo;s also that kind of tension, which is asking yourself the question, why</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t others done this?</p>
<p>Because, I mean, I get a lot of good ideas, but I think probably most of them suck when</p>
<p>they meet reality.</p>
<p>So so actually, I think the other big piece is getting into habit of generating ideas,</p>
<p>training your brain towards generating ideas and not even suspending judgment of the ideas.</p>
<p>So in some sense, I noticed myself that even if I&rsquo;m in the process of generating ideas,</p>
<p>if I tell myself, oh, that was a bad idea, then that actually interrupts the process</p>
<p>and I cannot generate more ideas because I&rsquo;m actually focused on the negative part, why</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I created also environment in the way that it&rsquo;s very easy for me to store new ideas.</p>
<p>So, for instance, next to my bed, I have a voice recorder and it happens to me often</p>
<p>like I wake up during the night and I have some idea.</p>
<p>In the past, I was writing them down on my phone, but that means, you know, turning on</p>
<p>the screen and that wakes me up or like pulling a paper, which requires, you know, turning</p>
<p>on the light.</p>
<p>These days, I just start recording it.</p>
<p>What do you think, I don&rsquo;t know if you know who Jim Keller is.</p>
<p>I know Jim Keller.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big proponent of thinking harder on a problem right before sleep so that he can</p>
<p>sleep through it and solve it in his sleep or like come up with radical stuff in his</p>
<p>sleep that&rsquo;s trying to get me to do this.</p>
<p>So it happened from my experience perspective, it happened to me many times during the high</p>
<p>school days when I was doing mathematics that I had a solution to my problem as I woke up.</p>
<p>At the moment, regarding thinking hard about the given problem is I&rsquo;m trying to actually</p>
<p>devote substantial amount of time to think about important problems, not just before</p>
<p>the sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m organizing amount of the huge chunks of time such that I&rsquo;m not constantly working</p>
<p>on the urgent problems, but I actually have time to think about the important one.</p>
<p>So you do it naturally.</p>
<p>But his idea is that you kind of prime your brain to make sure that that&rsquo;s the focus.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people have other worries in their life that&rsquo;s not fundamentally deep problems</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know, just stupid drama in your life and even at work, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>He wants to kind of pick the most important problem that you&rsquo;re thinking about and go</p>
<p>to bed on that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s wise.</p>
<p>I mean, the other thing that comes to my mind is also I feel the most fresh in the morning.</p>
<p>So during the morning, I try to work on the most important things rather than just being</p>
<p>pulled by urgent things or checking email or so.</p>
<p>What do you do with the&hellip;</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve been doing the voice recorder thing too, but I end up recording so many</p>
<p>messages it&rsquo;s hard to organize.</p>
<p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>Now I have heard that Google Pixel is really good in transcribing text and I might get</p>
<p>a Google Pixel just for the sake of transcribing text.</p>
<p>Yeah, people listening to this, if you have a good voice recorder suggestion that transcribe,</p>
<p>please let me know.</p>
<p>Some of it has to do with OpenAI codecs too.</p>
<p>Like some of it is simply like the friction.</p>
<p>I need apps that remove that friction between voice and the organization of the resulting</p>
<p>transcripts and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But yes, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Absolutely, like during, for me it&rsquo;s walking, sleep too, but walking and running, especially</p>
<p>running, get a lot of thoughts during running and there&rsquo;s no good mechanism for recording</p>
<p>thoughts.</p>
<p>So one more thing that I do, I have a separate phone which has no apps.</p>
<p>Maybe it has like audible or let&rsquo;s say Kindle.</p>
<p>No one has this phone number, this kind of my meditation phone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I try to expand the amount of time that that&rsquo;s the phone that I&rsquo;m having.</p>
<p>It has also Google Maps if I need to go somewhere and I also use this phone to write down ideas.</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s a really good idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good idea.</p>
<p>Often actually what I end up doing is even sending a message from that phone to the other</p>
<p>phone.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually my way of recording messages or I just put them into notes.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person, high school, college, about how to be successful?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done a lot of incredible things in the past decade, so maybe, maybe have some.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, there might be something.</p>
<p>There might be something.</p>
<p>I mean, might sound like a simplistic or so, but I would say literally just follow your</p>
<p>passion, double down on it.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s your passion, just figure out what could be a, what could</p>
<p>be a passion.</p>
<p>So that might be an exploration.</p>
<p>When I was in elementary school was math and chemistry.</p>
<p>And I remember for some time I gave up on math because my school teacher, she told me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m dumb.</p>
<p>And I guess maybe an advice would be just ignore people if they tell you that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dumb.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dumb. You mentioned something offline about chemistry and explosives.</p>
<p>What was that about?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>So a story goes like that.</p>
<p>I got into chemistry.</p>
<p>Maybe I was like a second grade of my elementary school, third grade.</p>
<p>I started going to chemistry classes.</p>
<p>I really love building stuff.</p>
<p>And I did all the experiments that they describe in the book, like, you know, how to create</p>
<p>oxygen with vinegar and baking soda or so.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I did all the experiments and at some point I was, you know, so what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>And explosives, they also, it&rsquo;s like a, you have a clear reward signal, you know, if the</p>
<p>thing worked or not.</p>
<p>So I remember at first I got interested in producing hydrogen.</p>
<p>That was kind of funny experiment from school.</p>
<p>You can just burn it.</p>
<p>And then I moved to nitroglycerin.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also relatively easy to synthesize.</p>
<p>I started producing essentially dynamite and detonating it with a friend.</p>
<p>I remember there was a, you know, there was at first like maybe two attempts that I went</p>
<p>with a friend to detonate what we built and it didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>And like a third time he was like, ah, it won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t waste time.</p>
<p>And, you know, we were, I was carrying this, this, you know, that tube with dynamite, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, pound or so, dynamite in my backpack, we&rsquo;re like riding on the bike to the edges</p>
<p>of the city.</p>
<p>Yeah, and attempt number three, this was be attempt number three.</p>
<p>Attempt number three.</p>
<p>And now we dig a hole to put it inside.</p>
<p>It actually had the, you know, electrical detonator.</p>
<p>We draw a cable behind the tree.</p>
<p>I even, I never had, I haven&rsquo;t ever seen like a explosion before.</p>
<p>So I thought that there would be a lot of, you know, a lot of, you know, a lot of, you</p>
<p>know, there will be a lot of sound.</p>
<p>But, you know, we&rsquo;re like laying down and I&rsquo;m holding the cable and the battery.</p>
<p>At some point, you know, we kind of like a three to one and I just connected it and it</p>
<p>felt like the ground shake.</p>
<p>It was like more like a sound.</p>
<p>And then the soil started kind of lifting up and started falling on us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the friend said, let&rsquo;s make sure the next time we have helmets.</p>
<p>But also, you know, I&rsquo;m happy that nothing happened to me.</p>
<p>It could have been the case that I lost the limbo or so.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s childhood of an engineering mind with a strong reward signal of an</p>
<p>explosion.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>My there&rsquo;s some aspect of chemists that the chemists I know, like my dad with plasma</p>
<p>chemistry, plasma physics, he was very much into explosives, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a worrying quality of people that work in chemistry that they love.</p>
<p>I think it is that exactly is the strong signal that the thing worked.</p>
<p>There is no doubt.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some magic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a reminder that physics works, that chemistry works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a little glimpse at nature that you yourself engineer.</p>
<p>I that&rsquo;s why I really like artificial intelligence, especially robotics, is you create a little</p>
<p>piece of nature and in some sense, even for me with explosives, the motivation was creation</p>
<p>rather than destruction.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>In terms of advice, I forgot to ask about just machine learning and deep learning for</p>
<p>people who are specifically interested in machine learning, how would you recommend</p>
<p>they get into the field?</p>
<p>So I would say re implement everything and also there is plenty of courses.</p>
<p>So like from scratch?</p>
<p>So on different levels of abstraction in some sense, but I would say re implement something</p>
<p>from scratch, re implement something from a paper, re implement something, you know,</p>
<p>from podcasts that you have heard about.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s a powerful way to understand things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s often the case that you read the description and you think you understand, but you truly</p>
<p>understand once you build it, then you actually know what really matter in the description.</p>
<p>Is there a particular topics that you find people just fall in love with?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>I tend to really enjoy reinforcement learning because it&rsquo;s much more, it&rsquo;s much easier</p>
<p>to get to a point where you feel like you created something special, like fun games</p>
<p>kind of things that are rewarding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rewarding.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As opposed to like re implementing from scratch, more like supervised learning kind of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, if someone would optimize for things to be rewarding, then it feels that</p>
<p>the things that are somewhat generative, they have such a property.</p>
<p>So you have, for instance, adversarial networks, or do you have just even generative language</p>
<p>models?</p>
<p>And you can even see, internally, we have seen this thing with our releases.</p>
<p>So we have, we released recently two models.</p>
<p>There is one model called Dali that generates images, and there is other model called Clip</p>
<p>that actually you provide various possibilities, what could be the answer to what is on the</p>
<p>picture, and it can tell you which one is the most likely.</p>
<p>And in some sense, in case of the first one, Dali, it is very easy for you to understand</p>
<p>that actually there is magic going on.</p>
<p>And in the case of the second one, even though it is insanely powerful, and you know, people</p>
<p>from a vision community, they, as they started probing it inside, they actually understood</p>
<p>how far it goes.</p>
<p>How far it goes, it&rsquo;s difficult for a person at first to see how well it works.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the same, as you said, that in case of supervised learning models, you might</p>
<p>not kind of see, or it&rsquo;s not that easy for you to understand the strength.</p>
<p>Even though you don&rsquo;t believe in magic, to see the magic.</p>
<p>To see the magic, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a generative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really brilliant.</p>
<p>So anything that&rsquo;s generative, because then you are at the core of the creation.</p>
<p>You get to experience creation without much effort.</p>
<p>Unless you have to do it from scratch, but.</p>
<p>And it feels that, you know, humans are wired.</p>
<p>There is some level of reward for creating stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Of course, different people have a different weight on this reward.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In the big objective function.</p>
<p>In the big objective function of a person.</p>
<p>Of a person.</p>
<p>You wrote that beautiful is what you intensely pay attention to.</p>
<p>Even a cockroach is beautiful.</p>
<p>If you look very closely, can you expand on this?</p>
<p>What is beauty?</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m, I wrote here actually corresponds to my subjective experience that I had through</p>
<p>extended periods of meditation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s pretty crazy that at some point the meditation gets you to the place that</p>
<p>you have really increased focus, increased attention.</p>
<p>Increased attention.</p>
<p>And then you look at the very simple objects that were all the time around you can look</p>
<p>at the table or on the pen or at the nature.</p>
<p>And you notice more and more details and it becomes very pleasant to look at it.</p>
<p>And it, once again, it kind of reminds me of my childhood.</p>
<p>Like I just pure joy of being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, I have seen even the reverse effect that by default, regardless of what we possess,</p>
<p>we very quickly get used to it.</p>
<p>And you know, you can have a very beautiful house and if you don&rsquo;t put sufficient effort,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going to get used to it and it doesn&rsquo;t bring any more joy,</p>
<p>regardless of what you have.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I actually, I find that material possessions get in the way of that experience of pure</p>
<p>joy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always, I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate to just find joy in simple things.</p>
<p>Just, just like you&rsquo;re saying, just like, I don&rsquo;t know, objects in my life, just stupid</p>
<p>objects like this cup, like thing, you know, just objects sounds okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being eloquent, but literally objects in the world, they&rsquo;re just full of joy.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t believe when I can&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to be alive</p>
<p>to experience these objects.</p>
<p>And then two, I can&rsquo;t believe humans are clever enough to have built these objects.</p>
<p>The hierarchy of pleasure that that provides is infinite.</p>
<p>I mean, even if you look at the cup of water, so, you know, you see first like a level of</p>
<p>like a reflection of light, but then you think, you know, man, there&rsquo;s like a trillions upon</p>
<p>of trillions of particles bouncing against each other.</p>
<p>There is also the tension on the surface that, you know, if the back, back could like a stand</p>
<p>on it and move around.</p>
<p>And you think it also has this like a magical property that as you decrease temperature,</p>
<p>it actually expands in volume, which allows for the, you know, legs to freeze on the,</p>
<p>on the surface and at the bottom to have actually not freeze, which allows for life like a crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You look in detail at some object and you think actually, you know, this table, that</p>
<p>was just a figment of someone&rsquo;s imagination at some point.</p>
<p>And then there was like a thousands of people involved to actually manufacture it and put</p>
<p>it here.</p>
<p>And by default, no one cares.</p>
<p>And then you can start thinking about evolution, how it all started from single cell organisms</p>
<p>that led to this table.</p>
<p>And these thoughts, they give me life appreciation and even lack of thoughts, just the pure raw</p>
<p>signal also gives the life appreciation.</p>
<p>See, the thing is, and then that&rsquo;s coupled for me with the sadness that the whole ride</p>
<p>ends and perhaps is deeply coupled in that the fact that this experience, this moment</p>
<p>ends, gives it, gives it an intensity that I&rsquo;m not sure I would otherwise have.</p>
<p>So in that same way, I tried to meditate on my own death.</p>
<p>Often.</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>So fear of death is like one of the most fundamental fears that each of us has.</p>
<p>We might be not even aware of it.</p>
<p>It requires to look inside, to even recognize that it&rsquo;s out there and there is still, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say, this property of nature that if things would last forever, then they would be also</p>
<p>boring to us.</p>
<p>The fact that the things change in some way gives any meaning to them.</p>
<p>I also, you know, found out that it seems to be very healing to people to have these</p>
<p>short experiences, like, I guess, psychedelic experiences in which they experience death</p>
<p>of self in which they let go of this fear and then maybe can even increase the intensity</p>
<p>can even increase the appreciation of the moment.</p>
<p>It seems that many people, they can easily comprehend the fact that the money is finite</p>
<p>while they don&rsquo;t see that time is finite.</p>
<p>I have this like a discussion with Ilya from time to time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you know, man, like the life will pass very fast.</p>
<p>At some point I will be 40, 50, 60, 70 and then it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>This is true, which also makes me believe that, you know, that every single moment it</p>
<p>is so unique that should be appreciated.</p>
<p>And this also makes me think that I should be acting on my life because otherwise it</p>
<p>will pass.</p>
<p>I also like this framework of thinking from Jeff Bezos on regret minimization that like</p>
<p>I would like if I will be at that deathbed to look back on my life and not regret that</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually you might regret that you haven&rsquo;t tried.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with failing.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Nietzsche eternal occurrence?</p>
<p>Try to live a life that if you had to live it infinitely many times, that would be the</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be okay with that kind of life.</p>
<p>So try to live it optimally.</p>
<p>I can say that it&rsquo;s almost like I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m available to me where I am in my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely grateful for actually people whom I met.</p>
<p>I would say I think that I&rsquo;m decently smart and so on.</p>
<p>But I think that actually to a great extent where I am has to do with the people who I</p>
<p>met.</p>
<p>Would you be okay if after this conversation you died?</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m dead, then it kind of I don&rsquo;t have a choice anymore.</p>
<p>So in some sense, there&rsquo;s like plenty of things that I would like to try out in my life.</p>
<p>I feel that I&rsquo;m gradually going one by one and I&rsquo;m just doing them.</p>
<p>I think that the list will be always infinite.</p>
<p>Yeah, so might as well go today.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, to be clear, I&rsquo;m not looking forward to die.</p>
<p>I would say if there is no choice, I would accept it.</p>
<p>But like in some sense, I&rsquo;m if there would be a choice, if there would be a possibility</p>
<p>to leave, I would fight for leaving.</p>
<p>I find it&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>I find it&rsquo;s more honest and real to think about, you know, dying today at the end of</p>
<p>the day.</p>
<p>That seems to me, at least to my brain, more honest slap in the face as opposed to I still</p>
<p>have 10 years like today, then I&rsquo;m much more about appreciating the cup and the table and</p>
<p>so on and less about like silly worldly accomplishments and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But we have in the company a person who say at some point found out that they have cancer</p>
<p>and that also gives, you know, huge perspective with respect to what matters now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, often people in situations like that, they conclude that actually what</p>
<p>matters is human connection.</p>
<p>And love and that&rsquo;s people conclude also if you have kids, kids as family.</p>
<p>You, I think, tweeted, we don&rsquo;t assign the minus infinity reward to our death.</p>
<p>Such a reward would prevent us from taking any risk.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t be able to cross the road in fear of being hit by a car.</p>
<p>So in the objective function, you mentioned fear of death might be fundamental to the</p>
<p>human condition.</p>
<p>So, as I said, let&rsquo;s assume that they&rsquo;re like a reward functions in our brain.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is even realization, how different reward functions can play with</p>
<p>your behavior.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that you should assign infinite negative reward to</p>
<p>anything because that messes up the math.</p>
<p>The math doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>And as you said, even, you know, government or some insurance companies, you said they</p>
<p>assign $9 million to human life.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just saying it with respect to, that might be a hard statement to ourselves, but</p>
<p>in some sense that there is a finite value of our own life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to put it from perspective of being less, of being more egoless and realizing</p>
<p>fragility of my own life.</p>
<p>And in some sense, the fear of death might prevent you from acting because anything can</p>
<p>cause death.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure actually, if you were to put death in the objective function, there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>so many aspects to death and fear of death and realization of death and mortality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just whole components of finiteness of not just your life, but every experience</p>
<p>and so on that you&rsquo;re going to have to formalize mathematically.</p>
<p>And also, you know, that might lead to you spending a lot of compute cycles on this like</p>
<p>a deliberating this terrible future instead of experiencing now.</p>
<p>And then in some sense, it&rsquo;s also kind of unpleasant simulation to run in your head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s an objective function that describes the entirety of human life?</p>
<p>So, you know, usually the way you ask that is what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Is there a universal objective functions that captures the why of life?</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, I suspect that they will ask this question, but it&rsquo;s also a question</p>
<p>that I ask myself many, many times.</p>
<p>See, I can tell you a framework that I have these days to think about this question.</p>
<p>So I think that fundamentally, meaning of life has to do with some of our reward actions</p>
<p>that we have in brain and they might have to do with, let&rsquo;s say, for instance, curiosity</p>
<p>or human connection, which might mean understanding others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible for a person to slightly modify their reward function.</p>
<p>Usually they mostly stay fixed, but it&rsquo;s possible to modify reward function and you can pretty</p>
<p>much choose.</p>
<p>So in some sense, the reward functions, optimizing reward functions, they will give you a life</p>
<p>satisfaction.</p>
<p>Is there some randomness in the function?</p>
<p>I think when you are born, there is some randomness.</p>
<p>You can see that some people, for instance, they care more about building stuff.</p>
<p>Some people care more about caring for others.</p>
<p>Some people, there are all sorts of default reward functions.</p>
<p>And then in some sense, you can ask yourself, what is the satisfying way for you to go after</p>
<p>this reward function?</p>
<p>And you just go after this reward function.</p>
<p>And, you know, some people also ask, are you satisfied with your life?</p>
<p>And, you know, some people also ask, are these reward functions real?</p>
<p>I almost think about it as, let&rsquo;s say, if you would have to discover mathematics, in</p>
<p>mathematics, you are likely to run into various objects like complex numbers or differentiation,</p>
<p>some other objects.</p>
<p>And these are very natural objects that arise.</p>
<p>And similarly, the reward functions that we are having in our brain, they are somewhat</p>
<p>very natural, that, you know, there is a reward function for understanding, like a comprehension,</p>
<p>curiosity, and so on.</p>
<p>So in some sense, they are in the same way natural as their natural objects in mathematics.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s the old sort of debate, is mathematics invented or discovered?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying reward functions are discovered.</p>
<p>So nature.</p>
<p>So nature provided some, you can still, let&rsquo;s say, expand it throughout the life.</p>
<p>Some of the reward functions, they might be futile.</p>
<p>Like, for instance, there might be a reward function, maximize amount of wealth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this is more like a learned reward function.</p>
<p>But we know also that some reward functions, if you optimize them, you won&rsquo;t be quite satisfied.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know which part of your reward function resulted in you coming today, but</p>
<p>I am deeply appreciative that you did spend your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>Wojtek is really fun talking to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a good human being.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an honor to meet you and an honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking today, brother.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex a lot.</p>
<p>I appreciated your questions, curiosity.</p>
<p>I had a lot of time being here.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Wojtek Zaremba.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Arthur C. Clarke, who is the author of</p>
<p>2001 A Space Odyssey.</p>
<p>It may be that our role on this planet is not to worship God, but to create him.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and I hope to see you next time.</p>
