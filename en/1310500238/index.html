    <p>The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram, his third time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a computer scientist, mathematician, theoretical physicist, and the founder of</p>
<p>Wolfram Research, a company behind Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language, and the new</p>
<p>Wolfram Physics Project. This conversation is a wild technical roller coaster ride</p>
<p>through topics of complexity, mathematics, physics, computing, and consciousness.</p>
<p>I think this is what this podcast is becoming, a wild ride. Some episodes are about physics,</p>
<p>some about robots, some are about war and power, some are about the human condition</p>
<p>and our search for meaning, and some are just what the comedian Tim Dillon calls fun.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, to support it please check out the sponsors in the description,</p>
<p>and now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Stephen Wolfram.</p>
<p>Stephen.</p>
<p>Almost 20 years ago, you published A New Kind of Science, where you presented a study of</p>
<p>complexity and an approach for modeling of complex systems. So, let us return again to</p>
<p>the core idea of complexity. What is complexity?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think that&rsquo;s not the most interesting question. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, if you ask a biologist what is life, that&rsquo;s not the question they care the most about.</p>
<p>But what I was interested in is, how does something that we would usually identify as</p>
<p>complexity arise in nature? And I got interested in that question like 50 years ago, which is</p>
<p>really embarrassingly long time ago. And, you know, I was, you know, how does snowflakes get</p>
<p>to have complicated forms? How do galaxies get to have complicated shapes? How do living systems</p>
<p>get produced? Things like that. And the question is, what&rsquo;s the sort of underlying scientific</p>
<p>basis for those kinds of things? And the thing that I was at first very surprised by, because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing physics and particle physics, some fancy mathematical physics and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I know all this fancy stuff, I should be able to solve this sort of basic</p>
<p>science question. And I couldn&rsquo;t, this was like early, maybe 1980 ish timeframe. And it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, what can one do to understand the sort of basic secret that nature seems to have?</p>
<p>Because it seems like nature, you look around in the natural world, it&rsquo;s full of incredibly</p>
<p>complicated forms. You look at sort of most engineered kinds of things, for instance,</p>
<p>they tend to be, you know, we&rsquo;ve got sort of circles and lines and things like this.</p>
<p>And the question is, what secret does nature have that lets it make all this complexity</p>
<p>that we in doing engineering, for example, don&rsquo;t naturally seem to have?</p>
<p>And so that was the kind of the thing that I got interested in. And then the question was,</p>
<p>you know, could I understand that with things like mathematical physics? Well, it didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>very well. So then I got to thinking about, okay, is there some other way to try to understand this?</p>
<p>And then the question was, if you&rsquo;re going to look at some system in nature,</p>
<p>how do you make a model for that system, for what that system does? So, you know,</p>
<p>a model is some abstract representation of the system, some formal representation system.</p>
<p>What is the raw material that you can make that model out of? And so what I realized was,</p>
<p>well, actually, programs are a really good source of raw material for making models of things.</p>
<p>And, you know, in terms of my personal history, to me, that seemed really obvious. And the reason</p>
<p>it seemed really obvious is because I just spent several years building this big piece of software</p>
<p>that was sort of a predecessor to Mathematica and Morphan Language, then called SMP, Symbolic</p>
<p>Manipulation Program, which was something that had this idea of starting from just these</p>
<p>computational primitives and building up everything one had to build up. And so kind of the notion of,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s just try and make models by starting from computational primitives and seeing what we</p>
<p>can build up, that seemed like a totally obvious thing to do. In retrospect, it might not have been</p>
<p>externally quite so obvious, but it was obvious to me at the time, given the path that I happened</p>
<p>to have been on. So, you know, so that got me into this question of, let&rsquo;s use programs</p>
<p>to model what happens in nature. And the question then is, well, what kind of programs?</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;re used to programs that you write for some particular purpose, and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>big, long piece of code, and it does some specific thing. But what I got interested in was, okay,</p>
<p>if you just go out into the sort of computational universe of possible programs, you say,</p>
<p>take the simplest program you can imagine, what does it do? And so I started studying these things</p>
<p>called cellular automata. Actually, I didn&rsquo;t know at first they were called cellular automata,</p>
<p>but I found that out subsequently. But it&rsquo;s just a line of cells, you know, each one is black or</p>
<p>white, and it&rsquo;s just some rule that says the color of the cell is determined by the color that it had</p>
<p>on the previous step and its two neighbors on the previous step. And I had initially thought,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, you know, sufficiently simple setup is not going to do anything interesting. It&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>going to be simple, no complexity, simple rule, simple behavior. Okay, but then I actually ran</p>
<p>the computer experiment, which was pretty easy to do. I mean, it probably took a few hours</p>
<p>originally. And the results were not what I&rsquo;d expected at all. Now, needless to say,</p>
<p>in the way that science actually works, the results that I got had a lot of unexpected</p>
<p>things which I thought were really interesting, but the really strongest results, which was</p>
<p>already right there in the printouts I made, I didn&rsquo;t really understand for a couple more years.</p>
<p>So it was not, you know, the compressed version of the story is you run the experiment and you</p>
<p>immediately see what&rsquo;s going on, but I wasn&rsquo;t smart enough to do that, so to speak. But the</p>
<p>big thing is, even with very simple rules of that type, sort of the minimal, tiniest program,</p>
<p>sort of the one line program or something, it&rsquo;s possible to get very complicated behavior. My</p>
<p>favorite example is this thing called Rule 30, which is a particular cellular automaton rule.</p>
<p>You just started off from one black cell and it makes this really complicated pattern. And so that</p>
<p>for me was sort of a critical discovery that then kind of said, playing back onto, you know,</p>
<p>how does nature make complexity, I sort of realized that might be how it does it.</p>
<p>That might be kind of the secret that it&rsquo;s using is that in this kind of computational</p>
<p>universe of possible programs, it&rsquo;s actually pretty easy to get programs where even though</p>
<p>the program is simple, the behavior when you run the program is not simple at all.</p>
<p>And so for me, that was the kind of the story of kind of how that was sort of the indication that</p>
<p>one had got an idea of what the sort of secret that nature uses to make complexity and how</p>
<p>complexity can be made in other places. Now, if you say, what is complexity? You know,</p>
<p>complexity is it&rsquo;s not easy to tell what&rsquo;s going on. That&rsquo;s the informal version of what is</p>
<p>complexity, but there is something going on, but there&rsquo;s a rule to know what, right? Well, no,</p>
<p>the rules can generate just randomness, right? Well, that&rsquo;s not obvious. In other words,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not obvious at all. And it wasn&rsquo;t what I expected. It&rsquo;s not what people&rsquo;s intuition</p>
<p>had been and has been for, you know, for a long time. That is one might think you have a rule.</p>
<p>You can tell there&rsquo;s a rule behind it. I mean, it&rsquo;s just like, you know, the early, you know,</p>
<p>robots in science fiction movies, right? You can tell it&rsquo;s a robot cause it does simple things,</p>
<p>right? It turns out that isn&rsquo;t actually the right story, but it&rsquo;s not obvious that isn&rsquo;t the right</p>
<p>story because people assume simple rules, simple behavior. And that the sort of the key discovery</p>
<p>about the computational universe is that isn&rsquo;t true. And that discovery goes very deep and</p>
<p>relates to all kinds of things that I&rsquo;ve spent years and years studying. But, you know, that in</p>
<p>the end, the sort of the, the what is complexity is, well, you can&rsquo;t easily tell what it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to do. You could just run the rule and see what happens, but you can&rsquo;t just say, oh, you know,</p>
<p>show me the rule. Great. And now I know what&rsquo;s going to happen. And, you know, the key phenomenon</p>
<p>around that is this thing I call computational irreducibility. This fact that in something like</p>
<p>rule 30, you might say, well, what&rsquo;s it going to do after a million steps? Well, you can run it</p>
<p>for a million steps and just do what it does to find out, but you can&rsquo;t compress that. You can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>reduce that and say, I&rsquo;m going to be able to jump ahead and say, this is what it&rsquo;s going to do after</p>
<p>a million steps, but I don&rsquo;t have to go through anything like that computational effort.</p>
<p>CB. By the way, has anybody succeeded at that? Do you have to challenge a competition</p>
<p>for predicting the middle column of rule 30? Anybody?</p>
<p>MG. A number of people have sent things in and sort of people are picking away at it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard. I mean, I&rsquo;ve been actually even proving that the center column of rule 30 doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>repeat. That&rsquo;s something I think might be doable. Okay?</p>
<p>CB. Mathematically proving.</p>
<p>MG. Yes. And so that&rsquo;s analogous to a similar kind of thing as like the digits of pi,</p>
<p>which are also generated in this very deterministic way. And so a question is how random are the</p>
<p>digits of pi? For example, first of all, do the digits of pi ever repeat? We know they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because it was proved in the 1800s that pi is not a rational number. So that means only rational</p>
<p>numbers have digit sequences that repeat. So we know the digits of pi don&rsquo;t repeat.</p>
<p>So now the question is, does 0, 1, 2, 3 or whatever, do all the digits base 10 or base 2 or</p>
<p>however you work it out, do they all occur with equal frequency? Nobody knows. That&rsquo;s far away</p>
<p>from what can be understood mathematically at this point. But I&rsquo;m even looking for step one,</p>
<p>which is prove that the center column doesn&rsquo;t repeat and then prove other things about it,</p>
<p>like equidistribution of equal numbers of zeros and ones. And those are things which I kind of</p>
<p>set up this little prize thing because I thought those were not too out of range. Those are things</p>
<p>which are within a modest amount of time, it&rsquo;s conceivable that those could be done. They&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>far away from what current mathematics might allow. They&rsquo;ll require a bunch of cleverness</p>
<p>and hopefully some interesting new ideas that will be useful other places.</p>
<p>But you started in 1980 with this idea before I think you realized this idea of programs.</p>
<p>You thought that there might be some kind of a thermodynamic randomness and then complexity</p>
<p>comes from a clever filter that you kind of like, I don&rsquo;t know, spaghetti or something. You filter</p>
<p>the randomness and outcomes complexity, which is an interesting intuition. How do we know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not actually what&rsquo;s happening? So just because you were then able to develop, look, you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>this like incredible randomness. You can just have very simple, predictable initial conditions</p>
<p>and predictable rules. And then from that emerged complexity, still there might be some systems</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s filtering randomness on the inputs. Well, the point is when you have quotes randomness</p>
<p>in the input, that means there&rsquo;s all kinds of information in the input. And in a sense,</p>
<p>what you get out will be maybe just something close to what you put in. Like people are very</p>
<p>in dynamical systems theory, sort of big area mathematics that developed</p>
<p>from the early 1900s and really got big in the 1980s. An example of what people study</p>
<p>there a lot and it&rsquo;s popular version is chaos theory. An example of what people study a lot</p>
<p>is the shift map, which is basically taking 2x mod one to the fractional part of 2x,</p>
<p>which is basically just taking digits in binary and shifting them to the left. So at every step,</p>
<p>you get to see if you say, how big is this number that I got out? Well, the most important digit in</p>
<p>that number is whatever ended up at the left hand end. But now if you start off from an arbitrary</p>
<p>random number, which is quotes randomly chosen, so all its digits are random, then when you run</p>
<p>that sort of chaos theory shift map, all that you get out is just whatever you put in. You just get</p>
<p>to see what you&hellip; It&rsquo;s not obvious that you would excavate all of those digits. And if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>for example, making a theory, I don&rsquo;t know, fluid mechanics, for example, if there was that</p>
<p>phenomenon in fluid mechanics, then the equations of fluid mechanics can&rsquo;t be right. Because what</p>
<p>that would be saying is the equations that it matters to the fluid, what happens in the fluid</p>
<p>at the level of the millionth digit of the initial conditions, which is far below the point at which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hitting sizes of molecules and things like that. So it&rsquo;s kind of almost explaining</p>
<p>if that phenomenon is an important thing, it&rsquo;s kind of telling you that fluid dynamics,</p>
<p>which describes fluids as continuous media and so on, isn&rsquo;t really right.</p>
<p>But so this idea that&hellip; It&rsquo;s a tricky thing because as soon as you put randomness in,</p>
<p>you have to know how much of what&rsquo;s coming out is what you put in versus how much is actually</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s being generated. And what&rsquo;s really nice about these systems where you just</p>
<p>have very simple initial conditions and where you get random stuff out or seemingly random stuff out</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t have that issue. You don&rsquo;t have to argue about, was there something complicated put</p>
<p>in? Because it&rsquo;s plainly obvious there wasn&rsquo;t. Now, as a practical matter in doing experiments,</p>
<p>the big thing is if the thing you see is complex and reproducible, then it didn&rsquo;t come from just</p>
<p>filtering some, quotes, randomness from the outside world. It has to be something that is</p>
<p>intrinsically made because it wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be&hellip; It could be the case that you set things up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always the same each time and you say, well, it&rsquo;s kind of the same, but it&rsquo;s not random</p>
<p>each time because it&rsquo;s kind of the definition of it being random is it was kind of picked at random</p>
<p>each time, so to speak. So is it possible to for sure know that our universe does not at the</p>
<p>fundamental level have randomness? Is it possible to conclusively say there&rsquo;s no randomness at the</p>
<p>bottom? Well, it&rsquo;s an interesting question. I mean, you know, science, natural science is an</p>
<p>inductive business, right? You observe a bunch of things and you say, can we fit these together?</p>
<p>What is our hypothesis for what&rsquo;s going on? The thing that I think I can say fairly definitively</p>
<p>is at this point, we understand enough about fundamental physics that if there was sort of</p>
<p>an extra dice being thrown, it&rsquo;s something that doesn&rsquo;t need to be there. We can get what we see</p>
<p>without that. Now, could you add that in as an extra little featureoid without breaking the</p>
<p>universe? Probably, but in fact, almost certainly yes. But is it necessary for understanding the</p>
<p>universe? No. And I think actually from a more fundamental point of view, I think I might be</p>
<p>able to argue. So one of the things that I&rsquo;ve been interested in and been pretty surprised that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had anything sentient to say about is the question of why does the universe exist? I didn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that was a question that I would, you know, I thought that was a far out there metaphysical</p>
<p>kind of thing. Even the philosophers have stayed away from that question for the most part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a kind of difficult to address question. But I actually think to my great surprise that</p>
<p>from our physics project and so on, that it is possible to actually address that question and</p>
<p>explain why the universe exists. And I kind of have a suspicion. I&rsquo;ve not thought it through.</p>
<p>I kind of have a suspicion that that explanation will eventually show you that in no meaningful</p>
<p>sense can there be randomness underneath the universe. That is that if there is, it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that is necessarily irrelevant to our perception of the universe. That is that it could be there,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t matter because in a sense, we&rsquo;ve already, you know, whatever it would do,</p>
<p>whatever extra thing it would add is not relevant to our perception of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So why does the universe exist? How does the relevance of randomness connect to the big</p>
<p>why question of the universe? So, OK, so I mean, why does the universe exist? Well, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>And is this the only universe we got? It&rsquo;s the only one that about that I&rsquo;m pretty sure.</p>
<p>So now maybe which one which of these topics is better to enter first? Why does the universe exist</p>
<p>and why you think it&rsquo;s the only one that exists? Well, I think they&rsquo;re very closely related. OK.</p>
<p>OK. So, I mean, the first thing, let&rsquo;s see, I mean, this why does the universe exist question</p>
<p>is built on top of all these things that we&rsquo;ve been figuring out about fundamental physics,</p>
<p>because if you want to know why the universe exists, you kind of have to know what the</p>
<p>universe is made of. And I think the well, let me let me describe a little bit about</p>
<p>the why does the universe exist question. So the main issue is let&rsquo;s say you have a model</p>
<p>for the universe and you say I&rsquo;ve got this this program or something and you run it and you make</p>
<p>the universe. Now you say, well, how do you actually why is that program actually running?</p>
<p>And people say you&rsquo;ve got this program that makes the universe. What computer is it running on?</p>
<p>Right. What what does it mean? What actualizes something? You know, two plus two equals four.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s different from saying this to a pile of two rocks, another pile of two rocks, and so</p>
<p>many moves them together and makes four, so to speak. And so what is it that kind of turns it</p>
<p>from being just this formal thing to being something that is actualized? OK, so there we</p>
<p>have to start thinking about, well, well, what do we actually know about what&rsquo;s going on in the</p>
<p>universe? Well, we are observers of this universe. But confusingly enough, we&rsquo;re part of this</p>
<p>universe. So in a sense, we what what what if we say what do we what do we know about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in the universe? Well, what we know is what sort of our consciousness records about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in the universe. And consciousness is part of the fabric of the universe. So we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in it. Yes, we&rsquo;re in it. And maybe I should maybe I should start off by saying something about</p>
<p>the consciousness story, because that&rsquo;s some. Maybe we should begin even before that at the</p>
<p>very base layer of the Wolfram physics project. Maybe you can give a broad overview once again</p>
<p>really quick about this hypergraph model. Yes. And also, what is it a year and a half ago since</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve brought this project to the world? What is the status update where what are all the beautiful</p>
<p>ideas you have come across? What are the interesting things you can mention? It&rsquo;s I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a frigging Cambrian explosion. I mean, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s crazy. I mean, there are all these</p>
<p>things which I&rsquo;ve kind of wondered about for years. And suddenly, there&rsquo;s actually a way to</p>
<p>think about them. And I really did not see. I mean, the real strength of what&rsquo;s happened,</p>
<p>I absolutely did not see coming. And the real strength of it is we&rsquo;ve got this model for physics,</p>
<p>but it turns out it&rsquo;s a foundational kind of model. That&rsquo;s a different kind of computation</p>
<p>like model that I&rsquo;m kind of calling the sort of multi computational model. And that that kind of</p>
<p>model is applicable not only to physics, but also to lots of other kinds of things. And one reason</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extremely powerful is because physics has been very successful. So we know a lot based on</p>
<p>what we figured out in physics. And if we know that the same model governs physics and governs,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, economics, linguistics, immunology, whatever, we know that the same kind of model</p>
<p>governs those things. We can start using things that we&rsquo;ve successfully discovered in physics</p>
<p>and applying those intuitions in all these other areas. And that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s pretty exciting and very</p>
<p>and very surprising to me. And in fact, it&rsquo;s kind of like in the original story of sort of you go</p>
<p>and you explain why is there complexity in the natural world, then you realize, well, there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>this complexity, there&rsquo;s all this computational irreducibility. You know, there&rsquo;s a lot we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know about what&rsquo;s going to happen. It&rsquo;s kind of kind of very confusing thing for people who say,</p>
<p>you know, science has nailed everything down. We&rsquo;re going to, you know, based on science,</p>
<p>we can know everything. Well, actually, there&rsquo;s this computational irreducibility thing</p>
<p>right in the middle of that, thrown up by science, so to speak. And then the question is, well,</p>
<p>given computational irreducibility, how can we actually figure out anything about what happens</p>
<p>in the world? Why aren&rsquo;t we why are we able to predict anything? Why are we able to operate in</p>
<p>the world? And the answer is that we sort of live in these slices of computational reusability</p>
<p>that exist in this kind of ocean of computational irreducibility. And it turns out that seems that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very fundamental feature of the kind of model that seems to operate in physics,</p>
<p>and perhaps in a lot of these other areas, that there are these particular slices of</p>
<p>computational reusability that are relevant to us. And those are the things that both allow us to</p>
<p>operate in the world, and not just have everything be completely unpredictable. But there are also</p>
<p>things that potentially give us what amount to sort of physics like laws in all these other areas.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s been sort of an exciting thing. But, but I would say that in general, for our</p>
<p>project, it&rsquo;s been going spectacularly well. I mean, you know, I, it&rsquo;s very, honestly, it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>something I expected to happen in my lifetime. I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s something where,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s an in fact, one of the things about it, some of the things that we&rsquo;ve discovered,</p>
<p>are things where I was pretty sure that wasn&rsquo;t how things worked. And turns out I&rsquo;m wrong. And,</p>
<p>you know, in a major area in metamathematics, I&rsquo;ve been realizing that I something I&rsquo;ve long</p>
<p>believed we can talk about it later that that that just just really isn&rsquo;t right. But But I think that</p>
<p>the the thing that so so what&rsquo;s happened with the physics project? I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>can explain a little bit about how the how the model works. But basically,</p>
<p>we can maybe ask you the following question. So it&rsquo;s easy through words describe how cellular</p>
<p>automata works, you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve explained this. And it&rsquo;s the fundamental mechanism by which you in</p>
<p>your book, and you kind of science explored the idea of complexity and how to do science in this</p>
<p>world of island reducible islands and irreducible general irreducibility. Okay, so how does the model</p>
<p>of hypergraphs differ from cellular automata? And how does the idea of multi computation</p>
<p>differ? Like, maybe that&rsquo;s a way to describe it. We&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re, you know, right. This is a, you know,</p>
<p>my life is like all of our lives, something of a story of computational irreducibility. Yes.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s been going for a few years now. So it&rsquo;s always a challenge to kind of find</p>
<p>these appropriate pockets of reducibility. But let me see what I can do. So, so I mean,</p>
<p>first of all, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s talk about physics, first of all. And, you know, a key observation,</p>
<p>that one of the starting point of our physics project is things about what is space? What is</p>
<p>the universe made of? And, you know, ever since Euclid, people just sort of say space is just this</p>
<p>thing where you can put things at any position you want. And they&rsquo;re just points. And they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>geometrical things that you can just arbitrarily put at different different coordinate positions.</p>
<p>So the first thing in our physics project is the idea that space is made of something, just like</p>
<p>just like water is made of molecules, space is made of kind of atoms of space. And the only thing we</p>
<p>can say about these atoms of space is they have some identity. There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a there is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this atom as opposed to this atom. And, you know, you could give them a few a computer person, you</p>
<p>give them UUIDs or something. And that&rsquo;s all there is to say about them, so to speak. And then all we</p>
<p>know about these atoms of space is how they relate to each other. So we say, these three atoms of</p>
<p>space are associated with each other in some relation. So you can think about that as you know,</p>
<p>what atom of space is friends with what other atom of space, you can build this essentially friend</p>
<p>network of the atoms of space. And the sort of starting point of our physics project is that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what our universe is, it&rsquo;s a giant friend network of the atoms of space. And so how can that</p>
<p>possibly represent our universe? Well, it&rsquo;s like in something like water, you know, their molecules</p>
<p>bouncing around, but on a large scale that, you know, that produces fluid flow, and we have fluid</p>
<p>vortices, and we have all of these phenomena that are sort of the emergent phenomena from that</p>
<p>underlying kind of collection of molecules bouncing around. And by the way, it&rsquo;s important that that</p>
<p>collection of molecules bouncing around have this phenomenon of computational irreducibility,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually what leads to the second law of thermodynamics among other things.</p>
<p>And that leads to the sort of randomness of the underlying behavior, which is what gives you</p>
<p>something which on a large scale seems like it&rsquo;s a smooth continuous type of thing. And so okay,</p>
<p>so first thing is space is made of something, it&rsquo;s made of all these atoms of space connected</p>
<p>together in this network. And then everything that we experience is sort of features of that</p>
<p>structure of space. So, you know, when we have an electron or something or a photon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some kind of tangle in the structure of space, much like kind of a vortex in a fluid</p>
<p>would be just this thing that is, you know, it can actually, the vortex can move around,</p>
<p>it can involve different molecules in the fluid, but the vortex still stays there.</p>
<p>And if you zoom out enough, the vortex looks like an atom itself, like a basic</p>
<p>element. So there&rsquo;s the levels of abstraction. If you squint and kind of blur things out,</p>
<p>it looks like at every level of abstraction, you can define what is a basic individual entity.</p>
<p>Yes. But, you know, in this model, there&rsquo;s a bottom level, you know, there&rsquo;s an elementary</p>
<p>length, maybe 10 to the minus 100 meters, let&rsquo;s say, which is really small, you know,</p>
<p>proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters, the smallest we&rsquo;ve ever been able to sort of see with a particle</p>
<p>accelerator is around 10 to the minus 21 meters. So, you know, if we don&rsquo;t know precisely what</p>
<p>the correct scale is, but it&rsquo;s perhaps over the order of 10 to the minus 100 meters, so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty small. But that&rsquo;s the end, that&rsquo;s what things are made of.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition where the 10 to the minus 100 comes from? What&rsquo;s your intuition about this</p>
<p>scale?</p>
<p>Well, okay, so there&rsquo;s a calculation, which I consider to be somewhat rickety,</p>
<p>okay, which has to do with comparing, so there are various fundamental constants,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a speed of light, the speed of light, once you know the elementary time,</p>
<p>the speed of light tells you the conversion from the elementary time to the elementary length.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the question of how do you convert to the elementary energy? And how do you convert</p>
<p>to between other things? And the various constants we know, we know the speed of light,</p>
<p>we know the gravitational constant, we know Planck&rsquo;s constant and quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>those are the three important ones. And we actually know some other things, we know things</p>
<p>like the size of the universe, the Hubble constant, things like that. And essentially,</p>
<p>this calculation of the elementary length comes from looking at the combination of those.</p>
<p>Okay, so the most obvious thing, people have assumed that quantum gravity happens at this</p>
<p>thing, the Planck scale, 10 to the minus 34 meters, which is the combination of Planck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>constant and the gravitational constant, the speed of light, that gives you that kind of length.</p>
<p>Turns out in our model, there is an additional parameter, which is essentially the number of</p>
<p>simultaneous threads of execution of the universe, which is essentially the number of sort of</p>
<p>independent quantum processes that are going on. And that number, let&rsquo;s see if I remember that</p>
<p>number, that number is 10 to the 170, I think, and so it&rsquo;s a big number. But that number then</p>
<p>connects, sort of modifies what you might think from all these Planck units to give you the things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re giving. And there&rsquo;s been sort of a mystery actually in the more technical physics thing,</p>
<p>that the Planck mass, the Planck energy, Planck energy is actually surprisingly big. The Planck</p>
<p>length is tiny, 10 to the minus 34 meters, you know, Planck time, 10 to the minus 43 meters,</p>
<p>I think, seconds, I think. But the Planck energy is like the energy of a lightning strike,</p>
<p>okay, which is pretty weird. In our models, the actual elementary energy is that divided by the</p>
<p>number of sort of simultaneous quantum threads, and it ends up being really small too. And that</p>
<p>sort of explains that mystery that&rsquo;s been around for a while about how Planck units work. But</p>
<p>whether that precise estimate is right, we don&rsquo;t know yet. I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the things that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of been a thing we&rsquo;ve been pretty interested in is how do you see through, you know, how do you</p>
<p>make a gravitational microscope that can kind of see through to the atoms of space? You know,</p>
<p>how do you get in fluid flow, for example, if you go to hypersonic flow or something, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a Mach 20, you know, space plane or something, it really matters that there are</p>
<p>individual molecules hitting the space plane, not a continuous fluid. The question is, what is the</p>
<p>analog of hypersonic flow for things about the structure of spacetime? And it looks like a</p>
<p>rapidly rotating black hole, right, at the sort of critical rotation rate, it looks as if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a case where essentially the structure of spacetime is just about to fall apart, and you</p>
<p>may be able to kind of see the evidence of sort of discrete elements, you know, you may be able</p>
<p>to kind of see there the sort of gravitational microscope of actually seeing these discrete</p>
<p>elements of space. And there may be some effect in, for example, gravitational waves produced by</p>
<p>rapidly rotating black hole that in which one could actually see some phenomenon where one</p>
<p>can say, yes, these don&rsquo;t come out the way one would expect based on having a continuous structure</p>
<p>of spacetime, that is something where you can kind of see through to the discrete structure.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that yet. So can you maybe elaborate a little bit deeper how a microscope that can see</p>
<p>the 10 to the minus 100, how rotating black holes and presumably the detailed accurate</p>
<p>detection of gravitational waves from such black holes can reveal the discreteness of space?</p>
<p>Okay, first thing is, what is a black hole? Actually, we need to go a little bit further in</p>
<p>the story of what spacetime is, because I explained a little bit about what space is,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t talk about what time is. And that&rsquo;s sort of important in understanding spacetime,</p>
<p>so to speak. And your sense is both space and time in the story are discrete.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Absolutely. But it&rsquo;s a complicated story. And needless to say.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s simple at the bottom. It&rsquo;s very simple at the bottom. In the end,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simple but deeply abstract. And something that is simple in conception,</p>
<p>but kind of wrapping one&rsquo;s head around what&rsquo;s going on is pretty hard. So first of all,</p>
<p>we have this. So I&rsquo;ve described these kind of atoms of space and their connections.</p>
<p>You can think about these things as a hypergraph. A graph is just you connect nodes to nodes,</p>
<p>but a hypergraph you can have not just individual friends to friends, but you can have these</p>
<p>triplets of friends or whatever else. And so we&rsquo;re just saying that&rsquo;s just the relations</p>
<p>between atoms of space are the hyperedges of the hypergraph. And so we got some big collection of</p>
<p>these atoms of space, maybe 10 to the 400 or something in our universe. And that&rsquo;s the structure</p>
<p>of space. And every feature of what we experience in the world is a feature of that hypergraph,</p>
<p>that spatial hypergraph. So then the question is, well, what does that spatial hypergraph do?</p>
<p>Well, the idea is that there are rules that update that spatial hypergraph. And in a cellular</p>
<p>automaton, you&rsquo;ve just got this line of cells and you just say at every step, at every time step,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got fixed time steps, fixed array of cells. At every step, every cell gets updated</p>
<p>according to a certain rule. And that&rsquo;s the way it works. Now in this hypergraph, it&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>vaguely the same kind of thing. We say every time you see a little piece of hypergraph that looks</p>
<p>like this, update it to one that looks like this. So just keep rewriting this hypergraph. Every time</p>
<p>you see something that looks like that, anywhere in the universe, it gets rewritten. Now, one thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tricky about that, which we&rsquo;ll come to, is this multi computational idea, which has to do</p>
<p>with you&rsquo;re not saying in some kind of lockstep way, do this one, then this one, then this one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just whenever you see one you can do, you can go ahead and do it. And that leads one not to</p>
<p>have a single thread of time in the universe. Because if you knew which one to do, you just say,</p>
<p>okay, we do this one, then we do this one, then we do this one. But if you say, just do whichever</p>
<p>one you feel like, you end up with these multiple threads of time, these kind of multiple histories</p>
<p>of the universe, depending on which order you happen to do the things you could do in.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fundamentally asynchronous and parallel.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>Which is very uncomfortable for the human brain that seeks for things to be sequential.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And synchronous.</p>
<p>Right. Well, I think that this is part of the story of consciousness,</p>
<p>is I think the key aspect of consciousness that is important for sort of parsing the universe,</p>
<p>is this point that we have a single thread of experience. We have a memory of what happened</p>
<p>in the past. We can say something, predict something about the future, but there&rsquo;s a single</p>
<p>thread of experience. And it&rsquo;s not obvious it should work that way. I mean, we&rsquo;ve got 100</p>
<p>billion neurons in our brains and they&rsquo;re all firing at all kinds of different ways.</p>
<p>But yet, our experience is that there is the single thread of time that goes along. And I</p>
<p>think that one of the things I&rsquo;ve kind of realized with a lot more clarity in the last year is the</p>
<p>fact that the fact that we conclude that the universe has the laws it has is a consequence</p>
<p>of the fact that we have consciousness the way we have consciousness. And so, just to go on with</p>
<p>kind of the basic setup, so we&rsquo;ve got this spatial hypergraph, it&rsquo;s got all these atoms of space,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting these little clumps of atoms of space, they&rsquo;re getting turned into other clumps</p>
<p>of atoms of space, and that&rsquo;s happening everywhere in the universe all the time. And so, one thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit weird is there&rsquo;s nothing permanent in the universe. The universe is getting</p>
<p>rewritten everywhere all the time. And if it wasn&rsquo;t getting rewritten, space wouldn&rsquo;t be knitted</p>
<p>together. That is, space would just fall apart. There wouldn&rsquo;t be any way in which we could say</p>
<p>this part of space is next to this part of space. One of the things that people were confused about</p>
<p>back in antiquity, the ancient Greek philosophers and so on, is how does motion work? How can it be</p>
<p>the case that you can take a thing that we can walk around and it&rsquo;s still us when we walked a</p>
<p>foot forward, so to speak? And in a sense, with our models, that&rsquo;s again a question because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a different set of atoms of space. When I move my hand, it&rsquo;s moving into a different set of atoms</p>
<p>of space. It&rsquo;s having to be recreated. The thing itself is not there. It&rsquo;s being continuously</p>
<p>recreated all the time. Now, it&rsquo;s a little bit like waves in an ocean, vortices in a fluid,</p>
<p>which again, the actual molecules that exist in those are not what define the identity of the</p>
<p>thing. But this idea that there can be pure motion, that it is even possible for an object</p>
<p>to just move around in the universe and not change, it&rsquo;s not self evident that such a thing</p>
<p>should be possible. And that is part of our perception of the universe is that we parse</p>
<p>those aspects of the universe where things like pure motion are possible. Now, pure motion,</p>
<p>even in general relativity, the theory of gravity, pure motion is a little bit of a complicated</p>
<p>thing. I mean, if you imagine your average teacup or something approaching a black hole,</p>
<p>it is deformed and distorted by the structure of space time. And to say, is it really pure motion?</p>
<p>Is it that same teacup that&rsquo;s the same shape? Well, it&rsquo;s a bit of a complicated story. And this</p>
<p>is a more extreme version of that. So anyway, the thing that&rsquo;s happening is we&rsquo;ve got space,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got this notion of time. So time is this kind of this rewriting of the hypergraph. And one</p>
<p>of the things that&rsquo;s important about that time is this sort of computational irreducible process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, you know, time is not something where it&rsquo;s kind of the mathematical view of time</p>
<p>tends to be time is just to coordinate. We can, you know, slide a slider, turn a knob,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll change the time that we&rsquo;ve got in this equation. But in this picture of time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not how it works at all. Time is this inexorable, irreducible kind of set of computations</p>
<p>that go on, that go from where we are now to the future. And one of the things that is, again,</p>
<p>something one sort of has to break out of is your average trained physicist like me says,</p>
<p>you know, space and time are the same kind of thing. They&rsquo;re related by, you know,</p>
<p>the Poincare group and Lorentz transformations and relativity and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And, you know, space and time, you know, there are all these kind of sort of folk stories you</p>
<p>can tell about why space and time are the same kind of thing. In this model, they&rsquo;re fundamentally</p>
<p>not the same kind of thing. Space is this kind of sort of connections between these atoms of space.</p>
<p>Time is this computational process. So the thing that the first sort of surprising thing is, well,</p>
<p>it turns out you get relativity anyway. And the reason that happens, there are a few bits and</p>
<p>pieces here which one has to understand. But the fundamental point is if you are an observer</p>
<p>embedded in the system that are part of this whole story of things getting updated in this way and</p>
<p>that, there&rsquo;s sort of a limit to what you can tell about what&rsquo;s going on. And really, in the end,</p>
<p>the only thing you can tell is what are the causal relationships between events. So an event in this</p>
<p>sort of an elementary event is a little piece of hypergraph got rewritten. And that means a few</p>
<p>hyper edges of the hypergraph were consumed by the event and you produce some other hyper edges.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an elementary event. And so then the question is what we can tell is kind of what the</p>
<p>network of causal relationships between elementary events is. That&rsquo;s the ultimate thing,</p>
<p>the causal graph of the universe. And it turns out that, well, there&rsquo;s this property of causal</p>
<p>invariance that is true of a bunch of these models and I think is inevitably true for a variety of</p>
<p>reasons that makes it be the case that it doesn&rsquo;t matter kind of if you are sort of saying, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this hypergraph and I can rewrite this piece here and this piece here and I do them all</p>
<p>in different orders. When you construct the causal graph for each of those orders that you choose to</p>
<p>do things in, you&rsquo;ll end up with the same causal graph. And so that&rsquo;s essentially why, well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the end why relativity works. It&rsquo;s why our perception of space and time is as having</p>
<p>this kind of connection that relativity says they should have. And that&rsquo;s kind of how that works.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m missing a little piece. If we can go there again, you said the fact that the</p>
<p>observer is embedded in this hypergraph, what&rsquo;s missing? What is the observer not able to state</p>
<p>about this universe of space and time? If you look from the outside, you can say,</p>
<p>oh, I see this particular place was updated and then this one was updated and I&rsquo;m seeing which</p>
<p>order things were updated in. But the observer embedded in the universe doesn&rsquo;t know which order</p>
<p>things were updated in because until they&rsquo;ve been updated, they have no idea what else happened.</p>
<p>So the only thing they know is the set of causal relationships. Let me give an extreme example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that the universe is a Turing machine. Turing machines have just this one</p>
<p>update head which does something and otherwise the Turing machine just does nothing.</p>
<p>And the Turing machine works by having this head move around and do its updating just where the</p>
<p>head happens to be. The question is, could the universe be a Turing machine? Could the universe</p>
<p>just have a single updating head that&rsquo;s just zipping around all over the place? You say,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy because I&rsquo;m talking to you, you seem to be updating, I&rsquo;m updating,</p>
<p>et cetera. But the thing is, there&rsquo;s no way to know that because if there was just this head</p>
<p>moving around, it&rsquo;s like, okay, it updates me, but you&rsquo;re completely frozen at that point.</p>
<p>Until the head has come over and updated you, you have no idea what happened to me.</p>
<p>And so if you sort of unravel that argument, you realize the only thing we actually can tell</p>
<p>is what the network of causal relationships between the things that happened were. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to know from some sort of outside, sort of God&rsquo;s eye view of the thing. We don&rsquo;t get to know</p>
<p>what sort of from the outside, what happened. We only get to know sort of what the set of</p>
<p>relationships between the things that happened actually were.</p>
<p>Yeah. But if I somehow record like a trace of this, I guess it would be called multi computation.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t I then look back in the causal tree?</p>
<p>Where do you record the trace?</p>
<p>Some, you place throughout the universe, like throughout like a log that records in my own</p>
<p>pocket of, in this hypergraph. Can&rsquo;t I, like realizing that I&rsquo;m getting an outdated picture,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t I record?</p>
<p>See, the problem is, and this is where things start getting very entangled in terms of what</p>
<p>one understands. The problem is that any such recording device is itself part of the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t get to say, you never get to say, let&rsquo;s go outside the universe and go do this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, I mean, lots of the features of this model and the way things work end up being</p>
<p>a result of that.</p>
<p>So, but what, I guess from on a human level, what is the cost you&rsquo;re paying? What are you missing</p>
<p>from not getting an updated picture all the time? Okay. I got, I understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, right.</p>
<p>But like what, like, how does consciousness emerge from that? Like how, like, what are</p>
<p>the limitations of that observer? I understand you&rsquo;re getting a delayed picture.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a, okay. So there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a bunch of limitations of the observer, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah. Maybe just explain something about quantum mechanics, because that maybe is a,</p>
<p>is an extreme version of some of these issues, which helps to kind of motivate why one should</p>
<p>sort of think things through a little bit more carefully. So one feature of the, of this, okay.</p>
<p>So in standard physics, like high school physics, you learn, you know, the equations of motion for</p>
<p>a ball and the, the, you know, it says you throw the ball this angle, this velocity,</p>
<p>things will move in this way. And there&rsquo;s a definite answer, right? The story, the key story</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics is there aren&rsquo;t definite answers to where does the ball go? There&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of this whole sort of bundle of possible paths. And all we say we know from quantum mechanics</p>
<p>is certain probabilities for where the ball will end up. Okay. So that&rsquo;s kind of the,</p>
<p>the core idea of quantum mechanics. So in our models, you, quantum mechanics is not some kind</p>
<p>of plugin add on type thing. You absolutely cannot get away from quantum mechanics because</p>
<p>as you think about updating this hypergraph, there isn&rsquo;t just one sequence of things,</p>
<p>one definite sequence of things that can happen. There are all these different possible update</p>
<p>sequences that can occur. You could do this, you know, piece of the hypergraph now, and then this</p>
<p>one later and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. All those different paths of history correspond to</p>
<p>these quantum, quantum paths and quantum mechanics, these different possible quantum histories.</p>
<p>And one of the things that&rsquo;s kind of surprising about it is they, they branch, you know, there can</p>
<p>be a certain state of the universe and it could do this or it could do that, but they can also</p>
<p>merge. There can be two states of the universe, which their next state, the next state they</p>
<p>produce is the same for both of them. And that process of branching and merging is kind of</p>
<p>critical. And the idea that there can be merging is critical and somewhat non trivial for these</p>
<p>hypergraphs because there&rsquo;s a whole graph isomorphism story and there&rsquo;s a whole very</p>
<p>elaborate set of mathematics. Yes. Among other things. Right. Yes. But so then what happens is</p>
<p>that what one&rsquo;s seeing, okay, so we&rsquo;ve got this thing, it&rsquo;s branching, it&rsquo;s merging, et cetera,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera. Okay. So now the question is how do we perceive that? Why don&rsquo;t we notice</p>
<p>that the universe is branching and merging? Why is it the case that we just think a definite set</p>
<p>of things happen? Well, the answer is we are embedded in that universe and our brains are</p>
<p>branching and merging too. And so what quantum mechanics becomes a story of is how does a</p>
<p>branching brain perceive a branching universe? And the key thing is as soon as you say,</p>
<p>I think definite things happen in the universe, that means you are essentially conflating</p>
<p>lots of different parts of history. You&rsquo;re saying, actually, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m convinced that definite things happen in the universe, all these parts of history must</p>
<p>be equivalent. Now, it&rsquo;s not obvious that that would be a consistent thing to do. It might be,</p>
<p>you say, all these parts of history are equivalent, but by golly, moments later,</p>
<p>that would be a completely inconsistent point of view. Everything would have gone to hell in</p>
<p>different ways. The fact that that doesn&rsquo;t happen is, well, that&rsquo;s a consequence of this causal</p>
<p>invariance thing. And the fact that that does happen a little bit is what causes little quantum</p>
<p>effects. And if that didn&rsquo;t happen at all, there wouldn&rsquo;t be anything that sort of is like quantum</p>
<p>mechanics. Quantum mechanics is kind of like in this bundle of paths. It&rsquo;s a little bit like what</p>
<p>happens in statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics, whatever, that most of the time,</p>
<p>you just see this continuous fluid. You just see the world just progressing in this kind of way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like this continuous fluid. But every so often, if you look at the exact right experiment,</p>
<p>you can start seeing, well, actually, it&rsquo;s made of these molecules where they might go that way,</p>
<p>or they might go this way, and that&rsquo;s kind of quantum effects. And so, this kind of idea of</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re sort of embedded in the universe, this branching brain is perceiving this branching</p>
<p>universe, and that ends up being sort of a story of quantum mechanics. That&rsquo;s part of the whole</p>
<p>picture of what&rsquo;s going on. But I think, I mean, to come back to sort of what is the story of</p>
<p>consciousness. So, in the universe, we&rsquo;ve got whatever it is, 10 to the 400 atoms of space,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all doing these complicated things. It&rsquo;s all a big, complicated, irreducible computation.</p>
<p>The question is, what do we perceive from all of that? And the answer is that we are parsing the</p>
<p>universe in a particular way. Let me again go back to the gas molecules analogy. In the gas in this</p>
<p>room, there are molecules bouncing around all kinds of complicated patterns, but we don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>All we notice is there&rsquo;s, you know, the gas laws are satisfied. Maybe there&rsquo;s some fluid dynamics.</p>
<p>These are kind of features of that assembly of molecules that we notice, and then lots of details</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t notice. When you say we, do you mean the tools of physics, or do you mean literally</p>
<p>the human brain and its perception system? Well, okay. So, the human brain is where it starts,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve built a bunch of instruments to do a bit better than the human brain, but they still</p>
<p>have many of the same kinds of ideas, you know, their cameras and their pressure sensors and</p>
<p>these kinds of things. They&rsquo;re not, you know, at this point, we don&rsquo;t know how to make</p>
<p>fundamentally qualitatively different sensory devices. Right. So, it&rsquo;s always just an extension</p>
<p>of the consciousness experience. Or our sensory experience. Sensory experience, but</p>
<p>sensory experience is somehow intricately tied to consciousness. Right. Well, so one question is,</p>
<p>when we are looking at all these molecules in the gas, and there might be 10 to the 20th molecules</p>
<p>in some little box or something, it&rsquo;s like, what do we notice about those molecules? So,</p>
<p>one thing that we can say is, we don&rsquo;t notice that much. We are, you know, we are computationally</p>
<p>bounded observers. We can&rsquo;t go in and say, okay, I&rsquo;m the 10 to the 20th molecules, and I know</p>
<p>that I can sort of decrypt their motions, and I can figure out this and that. It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to say, what&rsquo;s the average density of molecules? And so, one key feature of us is that</p>
<p>we are computationally bounded. And that when you are looking at a universe which is full of</p>
<p>computation and doing huge amounts of computation, but we are computationally bounded, there&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>certain things about that universe that we&rsquo;re going to be sensitive to. We&rsquo;re not going to be,</p>
<p>you know, figuring out what all the atoms of space are doing, because we&rsquo;re just computationally</p>
<p>bounded observers, and we are only sampling these small set of features. So, I think the</p>
<p>two defining features of consciousness that, and I, you know, I would say that the sort of the</p>
<p>preamble to this is, for years, you know, as I&rsquo;ve talked about sort of computation and fundamental</p>
<p>features of physics and science, people ask me, so what about consciousness? And I, for years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said, I have nothing to say about consciousness. And, you know, I&rsquo;ve kind of</p>
<p>told this story, you know, you talk about intelligence, you talk about life. These are</p>
<p>both features where you say, what&rsquo;s the abstract definition of life? We don&rsquo;t really know the</p>
<p>abstract definition. We know the one for life on Earth, it&rsquo;s got RNA, it&rsquo;s got cell membranes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got all this kind of stuff. Similarly for intelligence, we know the human definition of</p>
<p>intelligence, but what is intelligence abstractly? We don&rsquo;t really know. And so, what I&rsquo;ve long</p>
<p>believed is that sort of the abstract definition of intelligence is just computational sophistication.</p>
<p>That is, that as soon as you can be computationally sophisticated, that&rsquo;s kind of the abstract</p>
<p>version, the generalized version of intelligence. So, then the question is, what about consciousness?</p>
<p>And what I sort of realized is that consciousness is actually a step down from intelligence. That</p>
<p>is, that you might think, oh, you know, consciousness is the top of the pie, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the top of the pile. But actually, I don&rsquo;t think it is. I think that there&rsquo;s this notion of kind</p>
<p>of computational sophistication, which is the generalized intelligence. But consciousness</p>
<p>has two limitations, I think. One of them is computational boundedness. That is, that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only perceiving a sort of computationally bounded view of the universe. And the other is this idea</p>
<p>of a single thread of time. That is, that we, and in fact, we know neurophysiologically our brains</p>
<p>go to some trouble to give us this one thread of attention, so to speak. And it isn&rsquo;t the case that</p>
<p>in all the neurons in our brains that, at least in our conscious, the correspondence of language,</p>
<p>in our conscious experience, we just have the single thread of attention, single thread of</p>
<p>perception. And maybe there&rsquo;s something unconscious that&rsquo;s bubbling around that&rsquo;s the kind of</p>
<p>almost the quantum version of what&rsquo;s happening in our brain, so to speak. We&rsquo;ve got the classical</p>
<p>flow of what we are mostly thinking about, so to speak. But there&rsquo;s this kind of bubbling around</p>
<p>of other paths that is all those other neurons that didn&rsquo;t make it to be part of our sort of</p>
<p>conscious stream of experience. So in that sense, intelligence as computational sophistication is</p>
<p>much broader than the computational constraints which consciousness operates under, and also the</p>
<p>sequential, like the sequential thing, like the notion of time. That&rsquo;s kind of interesting. But</p>
<p>then the follow up question is like, okay, starting to get a sense of what is intelligence, and how</p>
<p>does that connect to our human brain? Because you&rsquo;re saying intelligence is almost like a fabric,</p>
<p>like what we like plug into it or something, like our consciousness plugs into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the intelligence, I think the core, I mean, you know, intelligence at some</p>
<p>level is just a word, but we are asking, you know, what is the notion of intelligence as we</p>
<p>generalize it beyond the bounds of humans, beyond the bounds of even the AIs that we humans have</p>
<p>built and so on? You know, what is intelligence? You know, is the weather, you know, people say the</p>
<p>weather has a mind of its own. What does that mean? You know, can the weather be intelligent?</p>
<p>Yeah. What does agency have to do with intelligence here? So is intelligence just</p>
<p>like your conception of computation, just intelligence is the capacity to perform</p>
<p>computation and the sea of? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think that&rsquo;s right. And I think that,</p>
<p>you know, this question of, is it for a purpose? Okay, that quickly degenerates into a horrible</p>
<p>philosophical mess. Because, you know, whenever you say, did the weather do that for a purpose?</p>
<p>Yeah. Right? Well, yes, it did. It was trying to move a bunch of hot air from the equator to the</p>
<p>poles or something. That&rsquo;s its purpose. But why? Because I seem to be equally as dumb today as I</p>
<p>was yesterday. So there&rsquo;s some persistence, like a consistency over time that the intelligence</p>
<p>I plugged into. So like, what&rsquo;s, it seems like there&rsquo;s a hard constraint between the amount of</p>
<p>computation I can perform in my consciousness. Like they seem to be really closely connected</p>
<p>somehow. Well, I think the point is that the thing that gives you kind of the ability to have</p>
<p>kind of conscious intelligence, you can have kind of this, okay, so one thing is we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>intelligences other than the ones that are very much like us. Yes. Right. And the ones that are</p>
<p>very much like us, I think have this feature of single thread of time, bounded, you know,</p>
<p>computationally bounded. But you also need computational sophistication. Having a single</p>
<p>thread of time and being computationally bounded, you could just be a clock going tick tock. That</p>
<p>would satisfy those conditions. But the fact that we have this sort of irreducible computational</p>
<p>ability, that&rsquo;s an important feature. That&rsquo;s sort of the bedrock on which we can construct</p>
<p>the things we construct. Now, the fact that we have this experience of the world that has the</p>
<p>single thread of time and computational boundedness, the thing that I sort of realized is it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>that causes us to deduce from this irreducible mess of what&rsquo;s going on in the physical world,</p>
<p>the laws of physics that we think exist. So in other words, if we say, why do we believe that</p>
<p>there is, you know, continuous space, let&rsquo;s say, why do we believe that gravity works the way it</p>
<p>does? Well, in principle, we could be kind of parsing details of the universe that were, you</p>
<p>know, that OK, the analogy is, again, with the statistical mechanics and molecules in a box,</p>
<p>we could be sensitive to every little detail of the swirling around of those molecules. And we</p>
<p>could say what really matters is the, you know, the wiggle effect that is, you know, that is</p>
<p>something that we humans just never noticed because it&rsquo;s some weird thing that happens when</p>
<p>there are 15 collisions of air molecules and this happens and that happens. We just see the pure</p>
<p>motion of a ball moving about. Right. Why do we see that? Right. And the point is that that what</p>
<p>seems to be the case is that the things that if we say, given this sort of hypergraph that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>updating and all the details about all the sort of atoms of space and what they do, and we say,</p>
<p>how do we slice that to what we can be sensitive to? What seems to be the case is that as soon as</p>
<p>we assume, you know, computational boundedness, single thread of time, that leads us to general</p>
<p>relativity. In other words, we can&rsquo;t avoid that. That&rsquo;s the way that we will parse the universe.</p>
<p>Given those constraints, we parse the universe according to those particular in such a way that</p>
<p>we say the aggregate reducible sort of pocket of computational reducibility that we slice out of</p>
<p>this kind of whole computational irreducible ocean of behavior is just this one that corresponds to</p>
<p>general relativity. Yeah, but we don&rsquo;t perceive general relativity. Well, we do if we do fancy</p>
<p>experiments. So you&rsquo;re saying so perceive really does mean the full. We drop something. That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great example of general relativity in action. No, but like what&rsquo;s the difference in that and</p>
<p>Newtonian mechanics? I mean, oh, it doesn&rsquo;t. This is when I say general relativity, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the uber theory, so to speak. I mean, Newtonian gravity is just the approximation that we can make,</p>
<p>you know, on the earth and things like that. So this is, you know, the phenomenon of gravity</p>
<p>is one that is a consequence of, you know, we would perceive something very different from</p>
<p>gravity. So so the way to understand that is when we think about OK, so we make up reference frames</p>
<p>with which we parse what&rsquo;s happening in space and time. So in other words, one of the one of</p>
<p>the things that we do is we say as time progresses everywhere in space is something happens at a</p>
<p>particular time and then we go to the next time and we say this is what space is like at the next</p>
<p>time is what space is like at the next time. That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the reason we are used to doing that</p>
<p>is because, you know, when we look around, we might see, you know, ten hundred meters away.</p>
<p>The time it takes light to travel that distance is really short compared to the time it takes our</p>
<p>brains to know what happened. So as far as our brains are concerned, we are parsing the universe</p>
<p>in this. There is a moment in time, it&rsquo;s all of space. There&rsquo;s a moment in time, it&rsquo;s all of</p>
<p>space. If we were the size of planets or something, we would have a different perception because the</p>
<p>speed of light would be much more important to us. We wouldn&rsquo;t have this perception that</p>
<p>things happen progressively in time everywhere in space. And so that&rsquo;s an important kind of</p>
<p>constraint. And the reason that we kind of parse the universe in the way that causes us to say</p>
<p>gravity works the way it does is because we&rsquo;re doing things like deciding that we can say the</p>
<p>universe exists, space has a definite structure. There is a moment in time, space has this definite</p>
<p>structure. We move to the next moment in time, space has another structure. That kind of setup</p>
<p>is what lets us kind of deduce kind of what parse the universe in such a way that we say gravity</p>
<p>works the way it does. So that kind of reference frame is that the illusion of that is that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying that&rsquo;s somehow useful for consciousness. That&rsquo;s what consciousness does. Because in a</p>
<p>sense, what consciousness is doing is it&rsquo;s insisting that the universe is kind of sequentialized.</p>
<p>And it is not allowing the possibility that, oh, there are these multiple threads of time</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all flowing differently. It&rsquo;s like saying, no, everything is happening in this one</p>
<p>thread of experience that we have. And that illusion of that one thread of experience</p>
<p>cannot happen at the planetary scale. Are you saying typical human, are you saying we are at a</p>
<p>human level is special here for consciousness? Well, for our kind of consciousness, if we existed</p>
<p>at a scale close to the elementary length, for example, then our perception of the universe</p>
<p>will be absurdly different. Okay. But this makes consciousness seem like a weird side effect to</p>
<p>this particular scale. And so who cares? I mean, consciousness is not that special.</p>
<p>Look, I think that a very interesting question is, which I&rsquo;ve certainly thought a little bit about,</p>
<p>is what can you imagine? What is a sort of factoring of something? What are some other</p>
<p>possible ways you could exist, so to speak? And if you were a photon, if you were some kind of thing</p>
<p>that was kind of, you know, intelligence represented in terms of photons, you know,</p>
<p>for example, the photons we receive in the cosmic microwave background, those photons,</p>
<p>as far as they&rsquo;re concerned, the universe just started. They were emitted, you know,</p>
<p>100,000 years after the beginning of the universe, they&rsquo;ve been traveling at the speed of light,</p>
<p>time stayed still for them, and then they just arrived and we just detected them. So for them,</p>
<p>the universe just started. And that&rsquo;s a different perception of, you know, that has</p>
<p>implications for a very different perception of time. They don&rsquo;t have that single thread</p>
<p>that seems to be really important for being able to tell a heck of a good story.</p>
<p>So we humans, we can tell a story. Right. We can tell a story. What other kind of stories can you</p>
<p>tell? So photon is a really boring story. Yeah. I mean, so that&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>boring story, but I think it&rsquo;s, you know, I&rsquo;ve been wondering about this and I&rsquo;ve been asking,</p>
<p>you know, friends of mine who are science fiction writers and things, have you written stuff about</p>
<p>this? And I&rsquo;ve got one example, a great collection of books from my friend Rudy Rooker, which I have</p>
<p>to say, they&rsquo;re books that are very informed by a bunch of science that I&rsquo;ve done. And the thing</p>
<p>that I really loved about them is, you know, in the first chapter of the book, the Earth is consumed</p>
<p>by these things called nants, which are nano, nanobot type things. So, you know, so the Earth</p>
<p>is gone in the first, but then it comes back. But then, yeah, right. That was only a micro</p>
<p>spoiler. It&rsquo;s only chapter one. But the thing that is not a real spoiler alert because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such a complicated concept, but in the end, the Earth is saved by this thing called the</p>
<p>principle of computational equivalence, which is a kind of a core scientific idea of mine.</p>
<p>And I was just like, like thrilled. I don&rsquo;t read fiction books very often. And I was just thrilled.</p>
<p>I get to the end of this and it&rsquo;s like, oh, my gosh, you know, everything is saved by this sort</p>
<p>of deep scientific principle. Can you maybe elaborate how the principle of computational</p>
<p>equivalence can save a planet? That would, that would be a terrible spoiler. That would be a</p>
<p>spoiler. But no, but let me say what the principle of computational equivalence is. So the question</p>
<p>is, you are, you have a system, you have some rule, you can think of its behavior as corresponding</p>
<p>to a computation. The question is, how sophisticated is that computation? The statement of the principle</p>
<p>of computational equivalence is, as soon as it&rsquo;s not obviously simple, it will be as sophisticated</p>
<p>as anything. And so that has the implication that, you know, rule 30, you know, our brains,</p>
<p>other things in physics, they&rsquo;re all ultimately equivalent in the computations they can do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what leads to this computational irreducibility idea because the reason we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to jump ahead, you know, and out think rule 30 is because we&rsquo;re just computationally equivalent</p>
<p>to rule 30. So we&rsquo;re kind of just both just running computations that are the same sort of</p>
<p>raw, the same level of computation, so to speak. So that&rsquo;s kind of the idea there. And the question,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like the, you know, in the science fiction version would be, okay, somebody says,</p>
<p>we just need more servers, get us more servers. The way to get even more servers is turn the</p>
<p>whole planet into a bunch of microservers. And that&rsquo;s where it starts. And so the question of,</p>
<p>you know, computational equivalence, principle of computational equivalence is, well, actually,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to build those custom servers. Actually, you can just use natural computation</p>
<p>to compute things, so to speak. You can use nature to compute. You don&rsquo;t need to have done</p>
<p>all that engineering. I mean, it kind of feels a little disappointing that you say, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>build all these servers. We&rsquo;re going to do all these things. We&rsquo;re going to make, you know,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;re going to have human consciousness uploaded into, you know, some elaborate digital</p>
<p>environment. And then you look at that thing and you say, it&rsquo;s got electrons moving around,</p>
<p>just like in a rock. And then you say, well, what&rsquo;s the difference? And the principle of</p>
<p>computational equivalence says there isn&rsquo;t, at some level, a fundamental, you know, you can&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>mathematically, there&rsquo;s a fundamental difference between the rock that is the future of human</p>
<p>consciousness and the rock that&rsquo;s just a rock. Now, what I&rsquo;ve sort of realized with this kind</p>
<p>of consciousness thing is there is an aspect of this that seems to be more special. And for</p>
<p>example, something I haven&rsquo;t really teased apart properly is when it comes to something like the</p>
<p>weather and the weather having a mind of its own or whatever, or your average, you know,</p>
<p>pulsar magnetosphere acting like a sort of intelligent thing, how does that relate to,</p>
<p>you know, how is that entity related to the kind of consciousness that we have? And sort of,</p>
<p>what would the world look like, you know, to the weather? If we think about the weather as a mind,</p>
<p>what will it perceive? What will its laws of physics be? I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very parallel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very parallel, among other things. And it&rsquo;s not obvious. I mean, this is a really kind of</p>
<p>mindbending thing because we&rsquo;ve got to try and imagine a parsing of the universe different from</p>
<p>the one we have. And by the way, when we think about extraterrestrial intelligence and so on,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of the key thing is, you know, we&rsquo;ve always assumed, I&rsquo;ve always assumed,</p>
<p>okay, the extraterrestrials, at least they have the same physics. We all live in the same universe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got the same physics. But actually, that&rsquo;s not really right because the extraterrestrials</p>
<p>could have a completely different way of parsing the universe. So it&rsquo;s as if, you know, there could</p>
<p>be for all we know, right here in this room, you know, in the details of the motion of these gas</p>
<p>molecules, there could be an amazing intelligence that we were like, but we have no way of, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not parsing the universe in the same way. If only we could parse the universe in the right way,</p>
<p>you know, immediately this amazing thing that&rsquo;s going on and this, you know, huge culture that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>developed and all that kind of thing would be obvious to us, but it&rsquo;s not because we have our</p>
<p>particular way of parsing the universe. Would that thing also have an agency? I don&rsquo;t know the right</p>
<p>word to use, but something like consciousness, but a different kind of consciousness?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a question of just what you mean by the word, because I think that the,</p>
<p>you know, this notion of consciousness and the, okay, so some people think of consciousness as</p>
<p>sort of a key aspect of it is that we feel that there&rsquo;s sort of a feeling of that we exist in</p>
<p>some way, that we have this intrinsic feeling about ourselves. You know, I suspect that any</p>
<p>of these things would also have an intrinsic feeling about themselves. I&rsquo;ve been sort of</p>
<p>trying to think recently about constructing an experiment about what if you were just a piece</p>
<p>of a cellular automaton, let&rsquo;s say, you know, what would your feeling about yourself actually be?</p>
<p>And, you know, can we put ourselves in the shoes, in the cells of the cellular automaton,</p>
<p>so to speak? Can we get ourselves close enough to that, that we could have a sense of what the</p>
<p>world would be like if you were operating in that way? And it&rsquo;s a little difficult because,</p>
<p>you know, you have to not only think about what are you perceiving, but also what&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>going on in your brain. And our brains do what they actually do. And they don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I think there might be some experiments that are possible with neural nets and so on,</p>
<p>where you can have something where you can at least see in detail what&rsquo;s happening inside the</p>
<p>system. And one of my projects to think about is, is there a way of kind of getting a sense</p>
<p>kind of from inside the system about what its view of the world is and how it, you know,</p>
<p>can we make a bridge? See, the main issue is this. It&rsquo;s a sort of philosophically difficult thing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like we do what we do. We understand ourselves, at least to some extent.</p>
<p>We humans understand ourselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct. But yet, okay, so what are we trying to do, for example, when we are trying to</p>
<p>make a model of physics? What are we actually trying to do? Because, you know, you say, well,</p>
<p>can we work out what the universe does? Well, of course we can. We just watch the universe. The</p>
<p>universe does what it does. But what we&rsquo;re trying to do when we make a model of physics is we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to get to the point where we can tell a story to ourselves that we understand that is also</p>
<p>a representation of what the universe does. So it&rsquo;s this kind of, you know, can we make a bridge</p>
<p>between what we humans can understand in our minds and what the universe does? And in a sense,</p>
<p>you know, a large part of my kind of life efforts have been devoted to making computational</p>
<p>language, which kind of is a bridge between what is possible in the computational universe</p>
<p>and what we humans can conceptualize and think about. In a sense, when I built Wolfram Language</p>
<p>and our whole sort of computational language story, it&rsquo;s all about how do you take sort of raw</p>
<p>computation and this ocean of computational possibility and how do we sort of represent</p>
<p>pieces of it in a way that we humans can understand and that map onto things that we care about doing.</p>
<p>And in a sense, when you add physics, you&rsquo;re adding this other piece where we can, you know,</p>
<p>mediated by computer, can we get physics to the point where we humans can understand something</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening in it? And when we talk about an alien intelligence, it&rsquo;s kind of the</p>
<p>same story. It&rsquo;s like, is there a way of mapping what&rsquo;s happening there onto something that we</p>
<p>humans can understand? And, you know, physics in some sense is like our exhibit one of the story</p>
<p>of alien intelligence. It&rsquo;s an alien intelligence in some sense. And what we&rsquo;re doing in making a</p>
<p>model of physics is mapping that onto something that we understand. And I think, you know, a lot</p>
<p>of these other things that I&rsquo;ve recently been kind of studying, whether it&rsquo;s molecular biology,</p>
<p>other kinds of things, which we can talk about a bit, those are other cases where we&rsquo;re in a sense</p>
<p>trying to, again, make that bridge between what we humans understand and sort of the natural</p>
<p>language of that sort of alien intelligence in some sense. When you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>just to backtrack a little bit about cellular automata, being able to, what&rsquo;s it like to be</p>
<p>a cellular automata in the way that&rsquo;s equivalent to what is it like to be a conscious human being?</p>
<p>How do you approach that? So is it looking at some subset of the cellular automata, asking questions</p>
<p>of that subset, like how the world is perceived, how you as that subset, like for that local pocket</p>
<p>of computation, what are you able to say about the broader cellular time? And that somehow then</p>
<p>can give you a sense of how to step outside of that cellular time. Right, but the tricky part is</p>
<p>that that little subset, what it&rsquo;s doing is it has a view of itself. And the question is,</p>
<p>how do you get inside it? It&rsquo;s like when we, with humans, it&rsquo;s like we can&rsquo;t get inside each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>consciousness. That doesn&rsquo;t really even make sense. It&rsquo;s like there is an experience that</p>
<p>somebody is having, but you can perceive things from the outside, but sort of getting inside</p>
<p>it, it doesn&rsquo;t quite make sense. And for me, these sort of philosophical issues, and this one I have</p>
<p>not untangled, so let&rsquo;s be&hellip; For me, the thing that has been really interesting in thinking</p>
<p>through some of these things is when it comes to questions about consciousness or whatever else,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when I can run a program and actually see pictures and make things concrete, I have a</p>
<p>much better chance to understand what&rsquo;s going on than when I&rsquo;m just trying to figure out what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on. I have a much better chance to understand what&rsquo;s going on than when I&rsquo;m just trying to</p>
<p>reason about things in a very abstract way. Yeah, but there may be a way to map the program to your</p>
<p>conscious experience. So for example, when you play a video game, you do a first person shooter,</p>
<p>you walk around inside this entity. It&rsquo;s a very different thing than watching this entity. So</p>
<p>connect more and more, connect this full conscious experience to the subset of the cellular automata.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s something like that. But the difference in the first person shooter thing is there&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>your brain and your memory is still remembering. You still have&hellip; It&rsquo;s hard to&hellip; I mean, again,</p>
<p>what one&rsquo;s going to get, one is not going to actually be able to be the cellular automaton.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s going to be able to watch what the cellular automaton does. But this is the frustrating thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m trying to understand how to think about being it, so to speak.</p>
<p>Okay. So like in virtual reality, there&rsquo;s a concept of immersion, like with anything,</p>
<p>with video games, with books, there&rsquo;s a concept of immersion. It feels like over time, if the</p>
<p>virtual reality experience is well done, and maybe in the future it&rsquo;ll be extremely well done,</p>
<p>the immersion leads you to feel like&hellip; You mentioned memories. You forget that you even</p>
<p>ever existed outside that experience. It&rsquo;s so immersive. I mean, you could argue sort of</p>
<p>mathematically that you can never truly become immersed, but maybe you can. I mean, why can&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>merge with the cellular automata? I mean, aren&rsquo;t you just part of the same fabric? Why can&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>just like&hellip; Well, that&rsquo;s a good question. I mean, so let&rsquo;s imagine the following scenario. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>imagine&hellip; Can you return? But then can you return back? Well, yeah, right. I mean, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine you&rsquo;ve uploaded, your brain is scanned, you&rsquo;ve got every synapse mapped out,</p>
<p>you upload everything about you, the brain simulator, you upload the brain simulator,</p>
<p>and the brain simulator is basically some glorified cellular automaton. And then you say,</p>
<p>well, now we&rsquo;ve got an answer to what does it feel like to be a cellular automaton?</p>
<p>It feels just like it felt to be ordinary you, because they&rsquo;re both computational systems,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both operating in the same way. But I think there&rsquo;s somehow more to it,</p>
<p>because in that sense, when you&rsquo;re just making a brain simulator, we&rsquo;re just saying there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another version of our consciousness. The question that we&rsquo;re asking is, if we tease away from our</p>
<p>consciousness and get to something that is different, how do we make a bridge to understanding</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on there? And there&rsquo;s a way of thinking about this. Okay, so this is coming</p>
<p>on to questions about the existence of the universe and so on. But one of the things is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this notion that we have of ruleal space. So we have this idea of this physical space,</p>
<p>which is something you can move around in that&rsquo;s associated with the extent of the</p>
<p>spatial hypergraph. Then there&rsquo;s what we call branchial space, the space of quantum branches.</p>
<p>So in this thing we call the multiway graph of all of this branching histories,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this idea of a kind of space where instead of moving around in physical space,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re moving from history to history, so to speak, from one possible history to another</p>
<p>possible history. And that&rsquo;s kind of a different kind of space that is the space in which quantum</p>
<p>mechanics plays out. Quantum mechanics, for example, I think we&rsquo;re slowly understanding</p>
<p>things like destructive interference in quantum mechanics, that what&rsquo;s happening is branchial</p>
<p>space is associated with phase in quantum mechanics. And what&rsquo;s happening is the two</p>
<p>photons that are supposed to be interfering and destructively interfering are winding up at</p>
<p>different ends of branchial space. And so us as these poor observers that have branching brains</p>
<p>that are trying to conflate together these different threads of history and say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve really got a consistent story that we&rsquo;re telling here. We&rsquo;re really knitting together</p>
<p>these threads of history. By the time the two photons wound up at opposite ends of branchial</p>
<p>space, we just can&rsquo;t knit them together to tell a consistent story. So for us,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of the analog of destructive interference. Got it. And then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rule space too, which is the space of rules. Yes. Well, that&rsquo;s another level up. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the question. Actually, I do want to mention one thing because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve realized in</p>
<p>recent times and I think it&rsquo;s really, really kind of cool, which is about time dilation and</p>
<p>relativity. And it kind of helps to understand it&rsquo;s something that kind of helps in understanding</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on. So according to relativity, if you have a clock, it&rsquo;s ticking at a certain rate,</p>
<p>you send it in a spacecraft that&rsquo;s going at some significant fraction of the speed of light,</p>
<p>to you as an observer at rest, that clock that&rsquo;s in the spacecraft will seem to be ticking much</p>
<p>more slowly. And so in other words, it&rsquo;s kind of like the twin who goes off to Alpha Centauri and</p>
<p>goes very fast will age much less than the twin who&rsquo;s on Earth that is just hanging out where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hanging out. Okay, why does that happen? Okay, so it has to do with what motion is.</p>
<p>So in our models of physics, what is motion? Well, when you move from somewhere to somewhere,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having to sort of recreate yourself at a different place in space.</p>
<p>When you exist at a particular place and you just evolve with time, again, you&rsquo;re updating yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re following these rules to update what happens. Well, so the question is, when you</p>
<p>have a certain amount of computation in you, so to speak, when there&rsquo;s a certain amount,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re computing, the universe is computing at a certain rate, you can either</p>
<p>use that computation to work out sitting still where you are, what&rsquo;s going to happen successively</p>
<p>in time, or you can use that computation to recreate yourself as you move around the universe.</p>
<p>Mm hmm. And so time dilation ends up being, it&rsquo;s really cool, actually, that this is explainable</p>
<p>in a way that isn&rsquo;t just imagine the mathematics of relativity. But time dilation is a story of</p>
<p>the fact that as you kind of are recreating yourself as you move, you are using up some</p>
<p>of your computation. And so you don&rsquo;t have as much computation left over to actually work out what</p>
<p>happens progressively with time. So that means that time is running more slowly for you because</p>
<p>it is, you&rsquo;re using up your computation, your clock can&rsquo;t tick as quickly, because every tick</p>
<p>of the clock is using up some computation, but you already use that computation up on moving at,</p>
<p>you know, half the speed of light or something. And so that&rsquo;s why time dilation happens.</p>
<p>And so you can start, so it&rsquo;s kind of interesting that one can sort of get an intuition about</p>
<p>something like that, because it has seemed like just a mathematical fact about the mathematics of</p>
<p>special relativity and so on. Well, for me, it&rsquo;s a little bit confusing what the you in that picture</p>
<p>is, because you&rsquo;re using up computation. Okay, so we&rsquo;re simply saying the entity is updating</p>
<p>itself according to the way that the universe updates itself. And the question is, you know,</p>
<p>those updates, let&rsquo;s imagine the you as a clock. Okay. And the clock is, you know, there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these little updates, the hypergraph and a sequence of updates cause the pendulum to swing back the</p>
<p>other way, and then swing back, swinging back and forth. Okay. And all of those updates are</p>
<p>contributing to the motion of, you know, the pendulum going back and forth or the little</p>
<p>oscillator moving, whatever it is. Okay. But then the alternative is that sort of situation one,</p>
<p>where the thing is at rest, situation two, where it&rsquo;s kind of moving, what&rsquo;s happening is it is</p>
<p>having to recreate itself at every moment, the thing is going to have to do the computations</p>
<p>to be able to sort of recreate itself at a different position in space. And that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>the intuition behind, so it&rsquo;s either going to spend its computation recreating itself at a</p>
<p>different position in space, or it&rsquo;s going to spend its computation doing the sort of doing the</p>
<p>updating of the, you know, of the ticking of the clock, so to speak. So the more updating is doing,</p>
<p>the less the ticking of the clock update is doing. That&rsquo;s right. The more it&rsquo;s having to update</p>
<p>because of motion, the less it can update the clock. Obviously, there&rsquo;s a sort of mathematical</p>
<p>version of it that relates to how it actually works in relativity, but that&rsquo;s kind of, to me,</p>
<p>that was sort of exciting to me that it&rsquo;s possible to have a really mechanically explainable story</p>
<p>there. And similarly in quantum mechanics, this notion of branching brains perceiving branching</p>
<p>universes, to me, that&rsquo;s getting towards a sort of mechanically explainable version of what happens</p>
<p>in quantum mechanics, even though it&rsquo;s a little bit mind bending to see, you know, these things</p>
<p>about under what circumstances can you successfully knit together those different threads of history,</p>
<p>and when do things sort of escape, and those kinds of things. But the thing about this physical space</p>
<p>and physical space, the main sort of big theory is general relativity, the theory of gravity,</p>
<p>and that tells you how things move in physical space. In branchial space, the big theory is the</p>
<p>Feynman path integral, which it turns out tells you essentially how things move in quantum in the</p>
<p>space of quantum phases. So it&rsquo;s kind of like motion in branchial space. And it&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>fun thing to start thinking about all these things that we know in physical space, like event horizons</p>
<p>and black holes and so on. What are the analogous things in branchial space? For example, the speed</p>
<p>of light, what&rsquo;s the analog of the speed of light in branchial space? It&rsquo;s the maximum speed of</p>
<p>quantum entanglement. So the speed of light is a flash bulb goes off here. What&rsquo;s the maximum rate</p>
<p>at which the effect of that flash bulb is detectable moving away in space? So similarly,</p>
<p>in branchial space, something happens. And the question is, how far in this branchial space,</p>
<p>in the space of quantum states, how far away can that get within a certain period of time?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this notion of a maximum entanglement speed. And that might be observable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing we&rsquo;ve been sort of poking at, is might there be a way to observe it,</p>
<p>even in some atomic physics kind of situation? Because one of the things that&rsquo;s weird in</p>
<p>quantum mechanics is when we study quantum mechanics, we mostly study it in terms of small</p>
<p>numbers of particles. This electron does this, this thing on an ion trap does that and so on.</p>
<p>But when we deal with large numbers of particles, kind of all bets are off. It&rsquo;s kind of too</p>
<p>complicated to deal with quantum mechanics. And so what ends up happening is, so this question</p>
<p>about maximum entanglement speed and things like that may actually play in the sort of story of</p>
<p>many body quantum mechanics and even have some suspicions about things that might happen even in</p>
<p>one of the things I realized I&rsquo;d never understood and it&rsquo;s kind of embarrassing, but I think I now</p>
<p>understand a little better, is when you have chemistry and you have quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, there&rsquo;s two carbon atoms in this molecule and we do a reaction and we draw a</p>
<p>diagram and we say this carbon atom ends up in this place. And it&rsquo;s like, but wait a minute,</p>
<p>in quantum mechanics, nothing ends up in a definite place. There&rsquo;s always just some wave</p>
<p>function for this to happen. How can it be the case that we can draw these reasonable, it just</p>
<p>ended up in this place? And you have to kind of say, well, the environment of the molecule</p>
<p>effectively made a bunch of measurements on the molecule to keep it kind of classical.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a story that has to do with this whole thing about measurements have to do with this</p>
<p>idea of, can we conclude that something definite happened? Because in quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>the intrinsic quantum mechanics, the mathematics of quantum mechanics is all about,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just these amplitudes for different things to happen. Then there&rsquo;s this thing of,</p>
<p>and then we make a measurement and we conclude that something definite happened. And that has</p>
<p>to do with this thing, I think, about sort of moving about knitting together these different</p>
<p>threads of history and saying, this is now something where we can definitively say something</p>
<p>definite happened. In the traditional theory of quantum mechanics, it&rsquo;s just like, after you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done all this amplitude computation, then this big hammer comes down and you do a measurement</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all over. And that&rsquo;s been very confusing. For example, in quantum computing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a very confusing thing because when you say, in quantum computing, the basic idea is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to use all these separate threads of computation, so to speak, to do all the different</p>
<p>parts of, try these different factors for an integer or something like this. And it looks</p>
<p>like you can do a lot because you&rsquo;ve got all these different threads going on. But then you have to</p>
<p>say, well, at the end of it, you&rsquo;ve got all these threads and every thread came up with a definite</p>
<p>answer, but we got to conflate those together to figure out a definite thing that we humans</p>
<p>can take away from it, a definite, so the computer actually produced this output.</p>
<p>So having this branchial space and this hypergraph model of physics, do you think it&rsquo;s possible to</p>
<p>then make predictions that are definite about many body quantum mechanical systems?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s likely, yes. Every one of these things, when you go from the underlying theory,</p>
<p>which is complicated enough and it&rsquo;s, I mean, the theory at some level is beautifully simple,</p>
<p>but as soon as you start actually trying to, it&rsquo;s this whole question about how do you bridge it to</p>
<p>things that we humans can talk about, it gets really complicated. And this thing about actually</p>
<p>getting it to a definite prediction about definite thing you can say about chemistry or something</p>
<p>like this, that&rsquo;s just a lot of work. So I&rsquo;ll give you an example. There&rsquo;s a thing called the</p>
<p>quantum Zeno effect. So the idea is quantum stuff happens, but then if you make a measurement,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of freezing time in quantum mechanics. So it looks like there&rsquo;s a possibility that with</p>
<p>sort of the relationship between the quantum Zeno effect and the way that many body quantum</p>
<p>mechanics works and so on, maybe just conceivably, it may be possible to actually figure out a way</p>
<p>to measure the maximum entanglement speed. And the reason we can potentially do that</p>
<p>is because the systems we deal with in terms of atoms and things, they&rsquo;re pretty big. A mole of</p>
<p>atoms is a lot of atoms, but it&rsquo;s something where to get, when we&rsquo;re dealing with how can you see</p>
<p>10 to the minus 100, so to speak? Well, by the time you&rsquo;ve got 10 to the 30th atoms, you&rsquo;re within</p>
<p>a little bit closer striking distance of that. It&rsquo;s not like, oh, we&rsquo;ve just got two atoms and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to see down to 10 to the minus 100 meters or whatever. So I don&rsquo;t know how it will</p>
<p>work, but this is a potential direction. And if you can tell, by the way, if we could measure</p>
<p>the maximum entanglement speed, we would know the elementary length. These are all related.</p>
<p>So if we get that one number, we just need one number. If we can get that one number,</p>
<p>the theory has no parameters anymore. And there are other places, well, there&rsquo;s another hope for</p>
<p>doing that is in cosmology. In this model, one of the features is the universe is not fixed</p>
<p>dimensional. We think we live in three dimensional space, but this hypergraph doesn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>particular dimension. It can emerge as something which on an approximation, it&rsquo;s as if you say,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the volume of a sphere in the hypergraph where a sphere is defined as how many nodes do</p>
<p>you get to when you go a distance R away from a given point? And you can say, well, if I get to</p>
<p>about R cubed nodes, when I go a distance R away in the hypergraph, then I&rsquo;m living roughly in</p>
<p>three dimensional space. But you might also get to R to the point 2.92 for some value of R. As R</p>
<p>increases, that might be the sort of fit to what happens. And so one of the things we suspect is</p>
<p>that the very early universe was essentially infinite dimensional, and that as the universe</p>
<p>expanded, it became lower dimensional. And so one of the things that is another little sort of point</p>
<p>where we think there might be a way to actually measure some things is dimension fluctuations in</p>
<p>the early universe. That is, is there leftover dimension fluctuation of at the time of the cosmic</p>
<p>microwave background, 100,000 years or something after the beginning of the universe? Is it still</p>
<p>the case that there were pieces of the universe that didn&rsquo;t have dimension three, that had</p>
<p>dimension 3.01 or something? And can we tell that? Is that possible to observe fluctuations in</p>
<p>dimensions? I don&rsquo;t even know what that entails. Okay. So the question, which should be an</p>
<p>elementary exercise in electrodynamics, except it isn&rsquo;t, is understanding what happens to a</p>
<p>photon when it propagates through 3.01 dimensional space. So for example, the inverse square law</p>
<p>is a consequence of the surface area of a sphere is proportional to R squared. But if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>in three dimensional space, the surface area of sphere is not proportional to R squared. It&rsquo;s R</p>
<p>to the whatever 2.01 or something. And so that means that I think when you kind of try and do</p>
<p>optics, you know, a common principle in optics is Huygens principle, which basically says that every</p>
<p>piece of a wave front of light is a source of new spherical waves. And those spherical waves,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re different dimensional spherical waves, will have other characteristics. And so there will</p>
<p>be bizarre optical phenomena which we haven&rsquo;t figured out yet. So you&rsquo;re looking for some weird</p>
<p>photon trajectories that designate that it&rsquo;s 3.01 dimensional space? Yeah. Yeah. That would be an</p>
<p>example of, I mean, you know, there are only a certain number of things we can measure about</p>
<p>photons. You know, we can measure their polarization, we can measure their frequency,</p>
<p>we can measure their direction, those kinds of things. And, you know, how that all works out.</p>
<p>And, you know, in the current models of physics, you know, it&rsquo;s been hard to explain how the</p>
<p>universe manages to be as uniform as it is. And that&rsquo;s led to this inflation idea that,</p>
<p>to the great annoyance of my then collaborator, we figured out in like 1979, we had this</p>
<p>realization that you could get something like this. But it seemed implausible that that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>way the universe worked. So we put it in a footnote. But in any case, I&rsquo;ve never really</p>
<p>completely believed it. But that&rsquo;s an idea for how to sort of puff out the universe faster than the</p>
<p>speed of light, early moments of the universe. That&rsquo;s the sort of the inflation idea and that</p>
<p>you can somehow explain how the universe manages to be as uniform as it is. In our model, this turns</p>
<p>out to be much more natural because the universe just starts very connected. The hypergraph is not</p>
<p>such that the ball that you grow starting from a single point has volume R cubed, it might have</p>
<p>volume R to the 500 or R to the infinity. And so that means that you sort of naturally get this</p>
<p>much higher degree of connectivity and uniformity in the universe. And then the question is,</p>
<p>this is sort of the mathematical physics challenge, is in the standard theory of the universe,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the Friedman Robertson Walker universe, which is the kind of standard model where the</p>
<p>universe is isotropic and homogeneous. And you can then work out the equations of general relativity,</p>
<p>and you can figure out how the universe expands. We would like to do the same kind of thing,</p>
<p>including dimension change. This is just difficult mathematical physics. I mean,</p>
<p>the reason it&rsquo;s difficult is the sort of fundamental reason it&rsquo;s difficult. When</p>
<p>people invented calculus 300 years ago, calculus was a story of understanding change and change</p>
<p>as a function of a variable. So people study univariate calculus, they study multivariate</p>
<p>calculus, it&rsquo;s one variable, it&rsquo;s two variables, three variables. But whoever studied, you know,</p>
<p>2.5 variable calculus, turns out nobody. Turns out that what we need to have to understand these</p>
<p>fractional dimensional spaces, which don&rsquo;t work like well, they&rsquo;re spaces where the effective</p>
<p>dimension is not an integer. So you can&rsquo;t apply the tools of calculus naturally and easily to</p>
<p>fractional dimensions? No. So somebody has to figure out how to do that. Yeah,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to figure this out. I mean, it&rsquo;s very interesting. I mean, it&rsquo;s very connected to</p>
<p>very frontier issues in mathematics. It&rsquo;s very beautiful. So is it possible? Is it possible?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re dealing with a scale that&rsquo;s so, so much smaller than our human scale. Is it possible</p>
<p>to make predictions versus explanations? Do you have a hope that with this hypergraph model,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be able to make predictions that then could be validated with a physics experiment,</p>
<p>predictions that couldn&rsquo;t have been done or weren&rsquo;t done otherwise? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,</p>
<p>you know, I think which, in which domain do you think? Okay, so they&rsquo;re going to be cosmology ones</p>
<p>to do with dimension fluctuations in the universe. That&rsquo;s a very bizarre effect. Nobody, you know,</p>
<p>dimension fluctuations is just something nobody ever looked for that. If anybody sees dimension</p>
<p>fluctuation, that&rsquo;s a huge flag that something like our model is going on. And how one detects</p>
<p>that, you know, that&rsquo;s a problem of kind of, you know, that&rsquo;s a problem of traditional physics in</p>
<p>a sense of what&rsquo;s the best way to actually figure that out. And for example, that&rsquo;s one,</p>
<p>there are all kinds of things one could imagine. I mean, there are things that in black hole mergers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that there will be effects of maximum entanglement speed in large black hole mergers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another possible thing. And all of that is detected through like what? Do you have a</p>
<p>hope for LIGO type of situation? Like that&rsquo;s gravitational waves? Yeah. Or alternatively,</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s, you know, look, figuring out experiments is like figuring out technology</p>
<p>inventions. That is, you know, you&rsquo;ve got a set of raw materials, you&rsquo;ve got an underlying model,</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;ve got to be very clever to figure out, you know, what is that thing I can measure</p>
<p>that just somehow, you know, leverages into the right place. And we&rsquo;ve spent less effort on that</p>
<p>than I would have liked. Because one of the reasons is that I think that the physicists</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been working on our models, with now lots of physicists actually, it&rsquo;s very, very nice. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of, it&rsquo;s one of these cases where I&rsquo;m almost, I&rsquo;m really kind of pleasantly surprised that the</p>
<p>sort of absorption of the things we&rsquo;ve done has been quite rapid and quite sort of, you know,</p>
<p>very positive. So it&rsquo;s a Cambrian explosion of physicists too, not just ideas. Yes. I mean,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of what&rsquo;s happened that&rsquo;s really interesting, and again, not what I expected,</p>
<p>is there are a lot of areas of sort of very elaborate, sophisticated mathematical physics,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s causal set theory, whether it&rsquo;s higher category theory, whether it&rsquo;s categorical</p>
<p>quantum mechanics, all sorts of elaborate names for these things, spin networks, perhaps,</p>
<p>you know, causal dynamical triangulations, all kinds of names of these fields. And these fields</p>
<p>have a bunch of good mathematical physicists in them who&rsquo;ve been working for decades in these</p>
<p>particular areas. And the question is, but they&rsquo;ve been building these mathematical structures.</p>
<p>And the mathematical structures are interesting, but they don&rsquo;t typically sit on anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just mathematical structures. And I think what&rsquo;s happened is our models provide kind of</p>
<p>a machine code that lives underneath those models. So a typical example, this is due to</p>
<p>Jonathan Gorod, who&rsquo;s one of the key people who&rsquo;s been working on our project. This is in,</p>
<p>okay, so I&rsquo;ll give you an example just to give a sense of how these things connect. This is in</p>
<p>causal set theory. So the idea of causal set theory is there are, in spacetime, we imagine</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s space and time. It&rsquo;s a three plus one dimensional, you know, setup. We imagine that</p>
<p>there are just events that happen at different times and places in space and time. And the idea</p>
<p>of causal set theory is the only thing you say about the universe is there are a bunch of events</p>
<p>that happen sort of randomly at different places in space and time. And then the whole sort of</p>
<p>theory of physics has to be to do with this graph of causal relationships between these randomly</p>
<p>thrown down events. So they&rsquo;ve always been confused by the fact that to get even Lorentz</p>
<p>invariants, even relativistic invariants, you need a very special way to throw down those events.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve had no natural way to understand how that would happen. So what Jonathan figured out</p>
<p>is that, in fact, from our models, instead of just generating events at random, our models</p>
<p>necessarily generate events in some pattern in spacetime effectively that then leads to Lorentz</p>
<p>invariants and relativistic invariants and all those kinds of things. So it&rsquo;s a place where</p>
<p>all the mathematics that&rsquo;s been done on, well, we just have a random collection of events.</p>
<p>Now what consequences does that have in terms of causal set theory and so on? That can all be kind</p>
<p>of wheeled in now that we have some different underlying foundational idea for what the</p>
<p>particular distribution of events is as opposed to just what we throw down random events.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a typical sort of example of what we&rsquo;re seeing in all these different areas of kind</p>
<p>of how you can take really interesting things that have been done in mathematical physics</p>
<p>and connect them. And it&rsquo;s really kind of beautiful because the abstract models we have</p>
<p>just seem to plug into all these different very interesting, very elegant abstract ideas.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re now giving sort of a reason for that to be the way, a reason for one to care. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like saying you can think about computation abstractly. You can think about, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>combinators or something as abstract computational things. And you can sort of do all kinds of study</p>
<p>of them. But it&rsquo;s like, why do we care? Well, okay, Turing machines are a good start because</p>
<p>you can kind of see they&rsquo;re sort of mechanically doing things. But when we actually start thinking</p>
<p>about computers, computing things, we have a really good reason to care. And this is sort of</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re providing, I think, is a reason to care about a lot of these areas of mathematical</p>
<p>physics. So that&rsquo;s been very nice. So I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;ve ever got to the</p>
<p>question of why does the universe exist at all? No, no, let&rsquo;s talk about that. So it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>simplest question in the world. So it takes a few steps to get to it. And it&rsquo;s nevertheless even</p>
<p>surprising that you can even begin to answer this question, as you were saying.</p>
<p>Indeed. I&rsquo;m very surprised. So the next thing to perhaps understand is this idea of ruleal space.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got kind of physical space. We&rsquo;ve got branchial space, the space of possible quantum</p>
<p>histories. And now we&rsquo;ve got another level of kind of abstraction, which is ruleal space. And</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where that comes from. So you say, okay, you say we&rsquo;ve got this model for the universe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a particular rule. And we run this rule and we get the universe. So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Why that rule? Why not another rule? And so that confused me for a long time. And I realized,</p>
<p>well, actually, what if the thing could be using all possible rules? What if at every step,</p>
<p>in addition to saying apply a particular rule at all places in this hypergraph, one could say,</p>
<p>just take all possible rules and apply all possible rules at all possible places in this</p>
<p>hypergraph. And then you make this ruleal multiway graph, which both is all possible</p>
<p>histories for a particular rule and all possible rules. So the next thing you&rsquo;d say is, how can you</p>
<p>get anything reasonable out of it? How can anything real come out of the set of all possible</p>
<p>rules applied in all possible ways? This is a subtle thing, which I haven&rsquo;t fully untangled.</p>
<p>There is this object, which is the result of running all possible rules in all possible ways.</p>
<p>And you might say, if you&rsquo;re running all possible rules, why can&rsquo;t everything possible happen?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is because when you, there&rsquo;s sort of this entanglement that occurs.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that you have a lot of different possible initial conditions, a lot of different</p>
<p>possible states. Then you&rsquo;re applying these different rules. Well, some of those rules can</p>
<p>end up with the same state. So it isn&rsquo;t the case that you can just get from anywhere to anywhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole entangled structure of what can lead to what, and there&rsquo;s a definite structure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s produced. I think I&rsquo;m going to call that definite structure the rulead, the limit of kind</p>
<p>of all possible rules being applied in all possible ways. And you&rsquo;re saying that structure is finite,</p>
<p>so that somehow connects to maybe a similar kind of thing as like causal invariance.</p>
<p>Well, it happens that the rulead necessarily has causal invariance. That&rsquo;s a feature of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a mathematical consequence of essentially using all possible rules</p>
<p>plus universal computation gives you the fact that from any diverging paths, the paths will</p>
<p>always converge. But does that necessarily infer that the rulead is finite?</p>
<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s not necessarily finite. I mean, just like the history of the universe may not be</p>
<p>finite. The history of the universe, time may keep going forever. You can keep running the</p>
<p>computations of the rulead and you&rsquo;ll keep spewing out more and more and more structure. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>time doesn&rsquo;t have to end. But the issue is there are three limits that happen in this rulead</p>
<p>object. One is how long you run the computation for. Another is how many different rules you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>applying. And another is how many different states you start from. And the mixture of those</p>
<p>three limits. I mean, this is just mathematically a horrendous object. And what&rsquo;s interesting about</p>
<p>this object is the one thing that does seem to be the case about this object is it connects with</p>
<p>ideas in higher category theory. And in particular, it connects to some of the 20th century&rsquo;s most</p>
<p>abstract mathematics done by this chap Grothendieck. Grothendieck had a thing called the infinity</p>
<p>groupoid, which is closely related to this rulead object. Although the details of the relationship,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t fully understand yet. But I think that what&rsquo;s interesting is this thing that</p>
<p>is sort of this very limiting object. So, okay, so a way to think about this that, again, will</p>
<p>take us into another direction, which is the equivalence between physics and mathematics.</p>
<p>The way that, well, let&rsquo;s see, maybe this is just to give a sense of this kind of groupoid and</p>
<p>things like that. You can think about, in mathematics, you can think you have certain axioms,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of like atoms, and you, well, actually, let&rsquo;s say, let&rsquo;s talk about mathematics</p>
<p>for a second. So what is mathematics? What is it made of, so to speak? Mathematics, there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>of statements, like, for addition, x plus y is equal to y plus x, that&rsquo;s a statement in mathematics.</p>
<p>Another statement would be, you know, x squared minus one is equal to x plus one, x minus one.</p>
<p>There are an infinite number of these possible statements of mathematics.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not, I mean, it&rsquo;s not just, I guess, a statement, but with x plus y,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a rule that you can, I mean, you think of it as a rule.</p>
<p>It is a rule. It&rsquo;s also just a thing that is true in mathematics.</p>
<p>Right. The statement of truth, okay.</p>
<p>Right. And what you can imagine is, you imagine just laying out this giant kind of ocean</p>
<p>of all statements. Well, actually, you first start, okay, this is where this was segueing</p>
<p>into a different thing. Let me not go in this direction for a second.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not go to metamathematics just yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll maybe get to metamathematics, but it&rsquo;s, so let me not, let me explain the groupoid</p>
<p>and things later. But, so let&rsquo;s come back to the universe, always a good place to be in,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what does the universe have to do with the rule add, the rule of L space,</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s possibly connected to why the thing exists at all, and why there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>one of them?</p>
<p>Yes. Okay. So here&rsquo;s the point. So the thing that had confused me for a long time was,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we get the rule for the universe. We hold it in our hand. We say, this is our</p>
<p>universe. Then the immediate question is, well, why isn&rsquo;t it another one? And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of the sort of the lesson of Copernicus is, we&rsquo;re not very special. So how come we</p>
<p>got universe number 312 and not universe quadrillion, quadrillion, quadrillion? And</p>
<p>I think the resolution of that is the realization that the universe is running all possible</p>
<p>rules. So then you say, well, how on earth do we perceive the universe to be running</p>
<p>according to a particular rule? How do we perceive definite things happening in the</p>
<p>universe? Well, it&rsquo;s the same story. It&rsquo;s the observer, there is a reference frame that</p>
<p>we are picking in this ruleal space, and that that is what determines our perception of</p>
<p>the universe. With our particular sensory information and so on, we are parsing the</p>
<p>universe in this particular way. So here&rsquo;s the way to think about it. In physical space,</p>
<p>we live in a particular place in the universe. And we could live on Alpha Centauri, but we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t. We live here. And similarly, in ruleal space, we could live in many different places</p>
<p>in ruleal space, but we happen to live here. And what does it mean to live here? It means</p>
<p>we have certain sensory input. We have certain ways to parse the universe. Those are our</p>
<p>interpretation of the universe. What would it mean to travel in ruleal space? What it</p>
<p>basically means is that we are successively interpreting the universe in different ways.</p>
<p>So in other words, to be at a different point in ruleal space is to have a different, in a sense,</p>
<p>a different interpretation of what&rsquo;s going on in the universe. And we can imagine even</p>
<p>things like an analog of the speed of light as the maximum speed of translation in ruleal</p>
<p>space and so on. So wait, what&rsquo;s the interpretation? So ruleal space and we,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confused by the we and the interpretation and the universe. I thought moving about in</p>
<p>ruleal space changes the way the universe is. The way we would perceive it. So it ultimately</p>
<p>has to do with the perception. So it doesn&rsquo;t real, ruleal space is not somehow changing,</p>
<p>like branching into another universe or something like that. No, I mean, the point is that the whole</p>
<p>point of this is the rule yard is sort of the encapsulated version of everything that is the</p>
<p>universe running according to all possible rules. We think of our universe, the observable universe,</p>
<p>as a thing. So we&rsquo;re a little bit loose with the word universe then, because wouldn&rsquo;t the rule yard</p>
<p>potentially encapsulate a very large number, like combinatorially large, maybe infinite</p>
<p>set of what we human physicists think of as universes? That&rsquo;s an interesting, interesting</p>
<p>parsing of the word universe, right? Because what we&rsquo;re saying is, just as we&rsquo;re at a particular</p>
<p>place in physical space, we&rsquo;re at a particular place in ruleal space, at that particular place</p>
<p>in ruleal space, our experience of the universe is this. Just as if we lived at the center of the</p>
<p>galaxy, our universe, our experience of the universe will be different from the one it is,</p>
<p>given where we actually live. And so what we&rsquo;re saying is, you might say, I mean, in a sense,</p>
<p>this rule yard is sort of a super universe, so to speak. But it&rsquo;s all entangled together. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like you can separate out. You can say, let me, it&rsquo;s like when we take a reference, okay, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>our experience of the universe is based on where we are in the universe. We could imagine moving</p>
<p>to somewhere else in the universe, but it&rsquo;s still the same universe.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not like universes existing in parallel?</p>
<p>No. Because, and the whole point is that if we were able to change our interpretation of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on, we could perceive a different reference frame in this rule yard.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s just, yeah, that&rsquo;s the same rule yard. That&rsquo;s the same universe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just moving about. These are just coordinates in the universe.</p>
<p>Right. So the reason that&rsquo;s interesting is, imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence,</p>
<p>so the alien intelligence, we should say. The alien intelligence might live on Alpha Centauri,</p>
<p>but it might also live at a different place in real space.</p>
<p>It can live right here on Earth. It just has a different reference frame that</p>
<p>includes a very different perception of the universe. And then because that</p>
<p>real space is very large, I mean,</p>
<p>Do we get to communicate with them? Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s also, well, one thing is how different the perception of the universe could be.</p>
<p>I think it could be bizarrely, unimaginably completely different. And I mean, one thing to</p>
<p>realize is, even in kind of things I don&rsquo;t understand well, you know, I know about the kind</p>
<p>of Western tradition of understanding, you know, science and all that kind of thing. And, you know,</p>
<p>you talk to people who say, well, I, you know, I&rsquo;m really into some, you know, Eastern tradition of</p>
<p>this, that and the other. And it&rsquo;s really obvious to me how things work. I don&rsquo;t understand it</p>
<p>at all. But, you know, it is not obvious, I think, with this kind of realization that there&rsquo;s these</p>
<p>very different ways to interpret what&rsquo;s going on in the universe. That kind of gives me at least,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t help me to understand that different interpretation. But it gives me at least more</p>
<p>respect for the possibility that there will be other interpretations.</p>
<p>Yeah, it humbles you to the possibility that like, what is it, reincarnation or all these like</p>
<p>eternal recurrence with Nietzsche, like just these ideas? Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you know, the thing that I realized about a bunch of those things is that, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sort of doing my little survey of the history of philosophy, just trying to understand,</p>
<p>you know, what can I actually say now about some of these things? And you realize that some of</p>
<p>these concepts like the immortal soul concept, which, you know, I remember when I was a kid,</p>
<p>and, you know, it was kind of a lots of religion bashing type stuff of people saying, you know,</p>
<p>well, we know about physics, tell us how much does a soul weigh? And people are like, well,</p>
<p>how can it be a thing if it doesn&rsquo;t weigh anything? Well, now we understand, you know,</p>
<p>there is this notion of what&rsquo;s in brains that isn&rsquo;t the matter of brains, and it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>computational. And there is a sense and in fact, it is correct, that it is in some sense, immortal,</p>
<p>because this pattern of computation is something abstract that is not specific to the particular</p>
<p>material of a brain. Now, we don&rsquo;t know how to extract it, you know, in our traditional scientific</p>
<p>approach. But it&rsquo;s still something where it isn&rsquo;t a crazy thing to say there is something doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>weigh anything. That&rsquo;s a kind of a silly question. How much does it weigh? Well, actually, maybe it</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t such a silly question in our model of physics, because the actual computational activity</p>
<p>has has a consequence for gravity and things, but that&rsquo;s a very subtle.</p>
<p>You can talk about mass and energy and so on. That could be a, what would you call it, a solitron.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>A particle that somehow contains soulness.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. Well, that&rsquo;s what, by the way, that&rsquo;s what Leibniz said. And, you know,</p>
<p>one thing I&rsquo;ve never understood this, you know, Leibniz had this idea of monads and monadology,</p>
<p>and he had this idea that what exists in the universe is this big collection of monads.</p>
<p>And that they that the only thing that one knows about the monads is sort of how they relate to</p>
<p>each other. It sounds awfully like hypergraphs, right? But Leibniz had really lost me at the</p>
<p>following thing. He said, each of these monads has a soul, and each of them has a consciousness.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;m out of here. I don&rsquo;t understand this at all. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on. But I realized recently that in his day, the concept that a thing could do something</p>
<p>could spontaneously do something. That was his only way of describing that.</p>
<p>And so what I would now say is, well, there&rsquo;s this abstract rule that runs. To Leibniz,</p>
<p>that would have been, you know, in 1690 or whatever, that would have been kind of,</p>
<p>well, it has a soul, it has a consciousness. And so, you know, in a sense, it&rsquo;s like one</p>
<p>of these, there&rsquo;s no new idea under the sun, so to speak. That&rsquo;s a sort of a version of the same</p>
<p>kinds of ideas, but couched in terms that are sort of bizarrely different from the ones that</p>
<p>we would use today. Would you be able to maybe play devil&rsquo;s advocate on your conception of</p>
<p>consciousness that, like the two characteristics of it that is constrained, and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>single thread of time? Is it possible that Leibniz was onto something that the basic atom,</p>
<p>the discrete atom of space has a consciousness? Is that, so these are just words, right? But like,</p>
<p>what is there? Is there some sense where consciousness is much more fundamental</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;re making it seem? I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, you know, I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you construct a world in which it is much more fundamental?</p>
<p>I think that, okay, so the question would be, is there a way to think about kind of,</p>
<p>if we sort of parse the universe down at the level of atoms of space or something,</p>
<p>could we say, well, so that&rsquo;s really a question of a different point of view,</p>
<p>a different place in real space. We&rsquo;re asking the question, could there be a civilization</p>
<p>that exists? Could there be sort of conscious entities that exist at the level of atoms of</p>
<p>space? And what would that be like? And I think that comes back to this question of,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it like to be a cellular automaton type thing? I mean, I&rsquo;m not yet there. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that this is a&hellip; And I know I don&rsquo;t even know yet quite how to think about this</p>
<p>in the sense that I was considering, you know, I never write fiction, but I haven&rsquo;t written it</p>
<p>since I was like 10 years old. And my fiction, I made one attempt, which I sent to some science</p>
<p>fiction writer friends of mine, and they told me it was terrible. So, but&hellip;</p>
<p>This is a long time ago?</p>
<p>No, this is recently.</p>
<p>Recently. They said it was terrible. That&rsquo;d be interesting to see you write a short story</p>
<p>based on what sounds like it&rsquo;s already inspiring short stories or stories by science fiction</p>
<p>writers.</p>
<p>But I think the interesting thing for me is, you know, what is it like to be a whatever?</p>
<p>How do you describe that? I mean, that&rsquo;s not a thing that you describe in mathematics,</p>
<p>the what is it like to be such and such.</p>
<p>Well, see, to me, when you say what is it like to be something,</p>
<p>it presumes that you&rsquo;re talking about a singular entity. So, like, there&rsquo;s some kind of feeling of</p>
<p>the entity, the stuff that&rsquo;s inside of it and the stuff that&rsquo;s outside of it.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when consciousness starts making sense. But then it seems like that could be</p>
<p>generalizable. If you take some subset of a cellular automata, you could start talking</p>
<p>about what does that subset feel. But then you can, I think you could just take arbitrary</p>
<p>numbers of subsets. Like, to me, like, you and I individually are consciousnesses,</p>
<p>but you could also say the two of us together is a singular consciousness.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe. I&rsquo;m not so sure about that. I think that the single thread of time thing</p>
<p>may be pretty important. And that as soon as you start saying, there are two different threads</p>
<p>of time, there are two different experiences, and then we have to say, how do they relate?</p>
<p>How are they sort of entangled with each other? I mean, that may be a different story of a thing</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t much like, you know, what do the ants, you know, what&rsquo;s it like to be an ant,</p>
<p>you know, where there&rsquo;s a sort of more collective view of the world, so to speak?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I think that, I mean, this is, you know, I don&rsquo;t really have a good, I mean,</p>
<p>you know, my best thought is, you know, can we turn it into a human story? It&rsquo;s like the question</p>
<p>of, you know, when we try and understand physics, can we turn that into something which is sort of</p>
<p>a human understandable narrative? And now what&rsquo;s it like to be a such and such? You know, maybe the</p>
<p>only medium in which we can describe that is something like fiction, where it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re telling, you know, the life story in that setting. But I&rsquo;m, this is beyond what I&rsquo;ve yet</p>
<p>understood how to do. Yeah, but it does seem so, like with human consciousness, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re made up of cells and like, there&rsquo;s a bunch of systems that are networked that work together</p>
<p>that at this, at the human level, feel like a singular consciousness when you take, and so</p>
<p>maybe like an ant colony is just too low level. Sorry, an ant is too low level. Maybe you have to</p>
<p>look at the ant colony. Yeah, I agree. There&rsquo;s some level at which it&rsquo;s a conscious being. And then</p>
<p>if you go to the planetary scale, then maybe that&rsquo;s going too far. So there&rsquo;s a nice sweet spot for</p>
<p>consciousness. No, I agree. I think the difficulty is that, you know, okay, so in sort of people who</p>
<p>talk about consciousness, one of the terrible things I&rsquo;ve realized, because I&rsquo;ve now interacted</p>
<p>with some of this community, so to speak, some interesting people who do that kind of thinking.</p>
<p>But, you know, one of the things I was saying to one of the leading people in that area, I was</p>
<p>saying, you know, that, you know, it must be kind of frustrating because it&rsquo;s kind of like a poetry</p>
<p>story. That is many people are writing poems, but few people are reading them. So there are always</p>
<p>these different, you know, everybody has their own theory of consciousness, and they are very</p>
<p>non inter sort of inter discussable. And by the way, I mean, you know, my own approach to sort of</p>
<p>the question of consciousness, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I&rsquo;m an applied consciousness operative,</p>
<p>so to speak, because I don&rsquo;t really, in a sense, the thing I&rsquo;m trying to get out of it is how does</p>
<p>it help me to understand what&rsquo;s a possible theory of physics? And how does it help me to say,</p>
<p>how do I go from this incoherent collection of things happening in the universe to our definite</p>
<p>perception and definite laws and so on, and sort of an applied version of consciousness? And I</p>
<p>think the reason it sort of segues to a different kind of topic, but the reason that one of the</p>
<p>things I&rsquo;m particularly interested in is kind of what&rsquo;s the analog of consciousness in systems</p>
<p>very different from brains? And so why is that matter? Well, you know, this whole description</p>
<p>of this kind of, you know what, we haven&rsquo;t talked about why the universe exists. So let&rsquo;s get to why</p>
<p>the universe exists. And then we can talk about perhaps a little bit about what these models of</p>
<p>physics kind of show you about other kinds of things like molecular computing and so on.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Why does the universe exist? Okay, so we finally sort of more or less set the stage,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got this idea of this rule yard of this object that is made from following all possible</p>
<p>rules, the fact that it&rsquo;s sort of not just this incoherent mess, it&rsquo;s got all this entangled</p>
<p>structure in it, and so on. Okay, so what is this rule yard? Well, it is the working out of all</p>
<p>possible formal systems. So the sort of the question of why does the universe exist? Its</p>
<p>core question, which we kind of started with is, you&rsquo;ve got two plus two equals four, you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>some other abstract result, but that&rsquo;s not actualized. It&rsquo;s just an abstract thing.</p>
<p>And when we say we&rsquo;ve got a model for the universe, okay, it&rsquo;s this rule, you run it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll make the universe, but it&rsquo;s like, but where&rsquo;s it actually running? What is it actually</p>
<p>doing? Is it actual, or is it merely a formal description of something? So the thing to realize</p>
<p>with this, the thing about the rule yard is it&rsquo;s an inevitable, it is the entangled running of all</p>
<p>possible rules. So you don&rsquo;t get to say, it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re saying, which rule yard are you</p>
<p>picking? Because it&rsquo;s all possible formal rules. It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s just, well, actually, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only footnote. The only footnote, it&rsquo;s an important footnote, is it&rsquo;s all possible</p>
<p>computational rules, not hyper computational rules. That is, it&rsquo;s running all the rules that would be</p>
<p>accessible to a Turing machine, but it is not running all the rules that will be accessible</p>
<p>to a thing that can solve problems in finite time that would take a Turing machine infinite time to</p>
<p>solve. So you can, even Alan Turing knew this, that you could make oracles for Turing machines,</p>
<p>where you say a Turing machine can&rsquo;t solve the whole thing problem for Turing machines. It can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what will happen in any Turing machine after an infinite time, in any finite time,</p>
<p>but you could invent a box, just make a black box. You say, I&rsquo;m going to sell you an oracle</p>
<p>that will just tell you, you know, press this button. It&rsquo;ll tell you what the Turing machine</p>
<p>will do after an infinite time. You can imagine such a box. You can&rsquo;t necessarily build one in</p>
<p>the physical universe, but you can imagine such a box. And so we could say, well, in addition to,</p>
<p>so in this Rulliad, we&rsquo;re imagining that there is a computational, that at the end, it&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>rules that are computational. It doesn&rsquo;t have a bunch of oracle black boxes in it. You say, well,</p>
<p>why not? Well, it turns out if there are oracle black boxes, the Rulliad that is,</p>
<p>you can make a sort of super Rulliad that contains those oracle black boxes,</p>
<p>but it has a cosmological event horizon relative to the first one. They can&rsquo;t communicate.</p>
<p>In other words, you can end up with, what ends up happening is it&rsquo;s like in the physical universe,</p>
<p>in this causal graph that represents the causal relationships of different things,</p>
<p>you can have an event horizon where the causal graph is disconnected, where the effect here,</p>
<p>an event happening here does not affect an event happening here because there&rsquo;s a disconnection</p>
<p>in the causal graph. And that&rsquo;s what happens in an event horizon. And so what will happen between</p>
<p>this kind of the ordinary Rulliad and the hyper Rulliad is there is an event horizon and we,</p>
<p>in our Rulliad, will just never know that they&rsquo;re just separate things. They&rsquo;re not connected.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;m not understanding, but just because we can&rsquo;t observe it,</p>
<p>why does that mean it doesn&rsquo;t exist?</p>
<p>So it might exist, but it&rsquo;s not clear what it&hellip; So what, so to speak, whether it exists. What</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to understand is why does our universe exist? We&rsquo;re not trying to ask the</p>
<p>question what&hellip; Let me say another thing. Let me make a meta comment, which is that I have not</p>
<p>thought through this hyper Rulliad business properly. So I can&rsquo;t&hellip; The hyper Rulliad is</p>
<p>referring to a Rulliad in which hyper computation is possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct. Yes.</p>
<p>Okay. So the footnote to the footnote is we&rsquo;re not sure why this is important.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. So let&rsquo;s ignore that. Okay. It&rsquo;s already abstract enough. Okay. So,</p>
<p>okay. So the one question is we have to say, if we&rsquo;re saying, why does the universe exist?</p>
<p>One question is why is it this universe and not another universe? Okay. So the important point</p>
<p>about this Rulliad idea is that in the Rulliad are all possible formal systems. So there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>choice being made. There&rsquo;s no like, oh, we pick this particular universe and not that one. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the first thing. The second thing is that we have to ask the question. So you say, why does two plus</p>
<p>two equals four exist? That is a thing that necessarily is that way just on the basis of</p>
<p>the meaning of the terms, two and plus and equals and so on. So the thing is that this Rulliad</p>
<p>object is in a sense a necessary object. It is just the thing that is the consequence of working</p>
<p>out the consequence of the formal definition of things. It is not a thing where you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>and this is picked as the particular thing. This is just something which necessarily is that thing</p>
<p>because of the definition of what it means to have computation. So the Rulliad, it&rsquo;s a formal system.</p>
<p>Yes. But does it exist? Ah, well, where are we in this whole thing?</p>
<p>Yes. We are part of this Rulliad. So there is no sense to say, does two plus</p>
<p>two equals four exist? Well, in some sense, it necessarily exists. It&rsquo;s a necessary object. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a thing that way you can ask. Usually in philosophy, there&rsquo;s a sort of distinction made</p>
<p>between necessary truths, contingent truths, analytic propositions, synthetic propositions</p>
<p>that are a variety of different versions of this. They&rsquo;re things which are necessarily true just</p>
<p>based on the definition of terms. And there are things which happen to be true in our universe.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t exist in Rullial space. That&rsquo;s one of the coordinates that define our existence.</p>
<p>Well, okay. So yes, yes. But this Rulliad is the set of all possible Rullial coordinates.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re saying is it contains that. So what we&rsquo;re saying is we exist as, okay, so</p>
<p>our perception of what&rsquo;s going on is we&rsquo;re at a particular place in this Rulliad,</p>
<p>and we are concluding certain things about how the universe works based on that.</p>
<p>But the question is, do we understand, you know, is there something where we say,</p>
<p>okay, so why does it work that way? Well, the answer is, I think it has to work that way,</p>
<p>because this Rulliad is a necessary object in the sense that it is a purely formal object,</p>
<p>just like 2 plus 2 equals 4. It&rsquo;s not an object that was made of something. It&rsquo;s an object that</p>
<p>is just an expression of the necessary collection of formal relations that exist.</p>
<p>And so then the issue is, can we, in our experience of that, is it, you know, can we have</p>
<p>tables and chairs, so to speak, in that just by virtue of our experience of that necessary thing?</p>
<p>And, you know, what people have generally thought, and I don&rsquo;t know of a lot of discussion of this,</p>
<p>why does the universe exist question? It&rsquo;s been a very, you know, I&rsquo;ve been surprised actually at</p>
<p>how little, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s one of these things that&rsquo;s really kind of far out there. But</p>
<p>the thing that is, you know, the surprise here is that all possible formal rules, when you run them</p>
<p>together, and that&rsquo;s the critical thing, when you run them together, they produce this kind of</p>
<p>entangled structure that has a definite structure. It&rsquo;s not just, you know, a random arbitrary thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a thing with definite structure. And that structure is the thing when we are embedded in</p>
<p>that structure, when anything, you know, an entity embedded in that structure perceives something,</p>
<p>which is then we can interpret as physics and things like this. So in other words, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to ask the question, the why does it exist? It necessarily exists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m missing this part. Why does it necessarily exist?</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>So like, you need to have it if you want to formalize the relation between entities, but</p>
<p>why do you need to have relations?</p>
<p>Okay, okay. So let&rsquo;s say you say, well&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why does math have to exist?</p>
<p>Fair question. Okay, fair question. Let&rsquo;s see. I think the thing to think about is</p>
<p>the existence of mathematics is something where given a definition of terms,</p>
<p>what follows from that definition inevitably follows. So now you can say, why define any terms?</p>
<p>But in a sense, the, well, that&rsquo;s okay. So the definition of terms, I mean, I think the way to</p>
<p>think about this, let me see.</p>
<p>So like concrete terms.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re not very concrete. I mean, they&rsquo;re just things like, you know, logical or.</p>
<p>Right, but that&rsquo;s a thing. That&rsquo;s a powerful thing.</p>
<p>Well, yes, okay. But the point is that it is not a thing of a, you know, people imagine there is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, the, you know, an elephant or something or the, you know, elephants are presumably</p>
<p>not necessary objects. They happen to exist as a result of kind of biological evolution and</p>
<p>whatever else. But the thing is that in some sense that there is, it is a different kind of thing</p>
<p>to say, does plus exist? It&rsquo;s not like an elephant.</p>
<p>So a plus seems more fundamental, more basic than an elephant. Yes. But you can imagine a world</p>
<p>without plus or anything like it. Like, why do formal things that are discrete, that can be used</p>
<p>to reason have to exist?</p>
<p>Well, okay. So why? Okay. So then the question is, but the whole point is computation.</p>
<p>We can certainly imagine computation. That is, we can certainly say there is a formal system that</p>
<p>we can construct abstractly in our minds that is computation. And that&rsquo;s the, you know, we can</p>
<p>imagine it. Now the question is, is it that formal system, once we exist as observers embedded in</p>
<p>that formal system, that&rsquo;s enough to have something which is like our universe. And so then what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of asking is perhaps is why, I mean, the point is we definitely can imagine it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that says that we&rsquo;re not saying that it&rsquo;s sort of inevitable that that is a thing</p>
<p>that we can imagine. We don&rsquo;t have to ask, does it exist? We&rsquo;re just, it is definitely something</p>
<p>we can imagine. Now that&rsquo;s, then we have this thing that is a formally constructible thing</p>
<p>that we can imagine. And now we have to ask the question, what, you know, given that formally</p>
<p>constructible thing, what is, what consequences does that, if we were to perceive that formally,</p>
<p>if we were embedded in that formally constructible thing, what would we perceive about the world?</p>
<p>And we would say, we perceive that the world exists because we are seeing all of this mechanism</p>
<p>of all these things happening. And, but that&rsquo;s something that is just a feature of, it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>where we are&hellip; See, another way of asking this that I&rsquo;m trying to get at, I understand why it</p>
<p>feels like this ruley ad is necessary, but maybe it&rsquo;s just me being human, but it feels like then</p>
<p>you should be able to, not us, but somehow step outside of the ruley ad. Like what&rsquo;s outside the</p>
<p>ruley ad? Well, the ruley ad is all formal systems. So there&rsquo;s nothing because&hellip; But that&rsquo;s what a</p>
<p>human would say. I know that&rsquo;s what a human would say, because we&rsquo;re used to the idea that there are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, but the whole point is that by the time it&rsquo;s all possible formal systems, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it is all things you can imagine, but&hellip; All computations you can imagine, but like we don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, so the issue is, can we encode? Okay. So that&rsquo;s a fair question. Is it possible to encode</p>
<p>all, I mean, once we, is there something that isn&rsquo;t what we can represent formally?</p>
<p>Right. That is, is there something that, and that&rsquo;s, I think, related to the hyper ruley ad</p>
<p>footnote, so to speak, which I&rsquo;m afraid that the, you know, one of the things sort of interesting</p>
<p>about this is, you know, there has been some discussion of this in theology and things like</p>
<p>that, but, which I don&rsquo;t necessarily understand all of, but the key sort of new input is this idea</p>
<p>that all possible formal systems, it&rsquo;s like, you know, if you make a world, people say, well, you</p>
<p>make a world with a particular, in a particular way with particular rules, but no, you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that. You can make a world that deals with all possible rules, and then merely by virtue of</p>
<p>living in a particular place in that world, so to speak, we have the perception we have of what the</p>
<p>world is like. Now, I have to say the, it&rsquo;s sort of interesting because I&rsquo;ve, you know, I wrote this</p>
<p>piece about this, and I, you know, this philosophy stuff is not super easy, and I&rsquo;ve, as I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>to you about it, and I actually haven&rsquo;t, you know, people have been interested in lots of different</p>
<p>things we&rsquo;ve been doing, but this, why does the universe exist, has been, I would say, one of the,</p>
<p>one of the ones that you would think people will be most interested in, but actually, I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like, oh, that&rsquo;s just something complicated that, so I haven&rsquo;t, I haven&rsquo;t explained</p>
<p>it as much as I&rsquo;ve explained a bunch of other things, and I have to say, I think I, I think I</p>
<p>may be missing a couple of pieces of that argument that would be, so it&rsquo;s kind of a like‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Well, you are, your conscious being is computationally bounded, so you&rsquo;re missing‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Having written quite a few articles yourself, you&rsquo;re now missing some of the pieces.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the limitation of being human.</p>
<p>Right. One of the consequences of this, why the universe exists thing, is that you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>something, and this kind of concept of rule adds and, you know, places in there representing our</p>
<p>perception of the universe and so on. One of the weird consequences is, if the universe exists,</p>
<p>mathematics must also exist. And that&rsquo;s a weird thing, because mathematics, people have been very</p>
<p>confused, including me, have been very confused about the question of kind of what, what is the</p>
<p>definition of mathematics? What is, what kind of a thing is mathematics? Is mathematics something</p>
<p>where we just write down axioms like Euclid did for geometry, and we just build the structure,</p>
<p>and we could have written down different axioms, and we&rsquo;d have a different structure? Or is it</p>
<p>something that has a more fundamental sort of truth to it? And I have to say, this is one of</p>
<p>these cases where I&rsquo;ve long believed that mathematics has a great deal of arbitrariness to</p>
<p>it, that there are particular axioms that kind of got written down by the Babylonians, and, you</p>
<p>know, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve ended up with the mathematics that we have. And I have to say,</p>
<p>actually, my wife has been telling me for 25 years, she was a mathematician, she&rsquo;s been telling me,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wrong about the foundations of mathematics. And, you know, I&rsquo;m like, no, no, no, I know what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about. And finally, she&rsquo;s much more right than I&rsquo;ve been. So it&rsquo;s one of the&hellip;</p>
<p>So, I mean, her sense and your sense, are we just, so this is to the question of metamathematics,</p>
<p>just kind of on a trajectory through ruleal space, except in mathematics, through a trajectory of</p>
<p>a certain kind of&hellip; I think that&rsquo;s partly the idea. So I think that the notion is this. So 100</p>
<p>years ago, a little bit more than 100 years ago, people have been doing mathematics for ages,</p>
<p>but then in the late 1800s, people decided to try and formalize mathematics and say, you know,</p>
<p>it is mathematics is, you know, we&rsquo;re going to break it down, we&rsquo;re going to make it like logic,</p>
<p>make it out of sort of fundamental primitives. And that was people like Frager and Piano and</p>
<p>Hilbert and so on. And they kind of got this idea of let&rsquo;s do kind of Euclid, but even better,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just make everything just in terms of this sort of symbolic axioms, and then build</p>
<p>up mathematics from that. And that, you know, they thought at the time, as soon as they get</p>
<p>these symbolic axioms, that they made the same mistake, the kind of computational irreducibility</p>
<p>mistake. They thought as soon as we&rsquo;ve written down the axioms, then we&rsquo;ll just have a machine,</p>
<p>kind of a super mathematical, so to speak, that can just grind out all true theorems of mathematics.</p>
<p>That got exploited by G√∂del&rsquo;s theorem, which is basically the story of computational</p>
<p>irreducibility. It&rsquo;s that even though you know those underlying rules, you can&rsquo;t deduce all</p>
<p>the consequences in any finite way. But now the question is, okay, so they broke mathematics down</p>
<p>into these axioms, and they say now you build up from that. So what I&rsquo;m increasingly coming to</p>
<p>realize is that&rsquo;s similar to saying let&rsquo;s take a gas and break it down into molecules. There&rsquo;s gas</p>
<p>laws that are the large scale structure and so on that we humans are familiar with, and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the underlying molecular dynamics. And I think that the axiomatic level of mathematics, which</p>
<p>we can access with automated theorem proving and proof assistance and these kinds of things,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the molecular dynamics of mathematics. And occasionally we see through to that molecular</p>
<p>dynamics. We see undecidability, we see other things like this. One of the things I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>found very mysterious is that G√∂del&rsquo;s theorem shows that there are sort of things which cannot</p>
<p>be finitely proved in mathematics. There are proofs of arbitrary length, infinite length proofs that</p>
<p>you might need. But in practical mathematics, mathematicians don&rsquo;t typically run into this.</p>
<p>They just happily go along doing their mathematics. And I think what&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>happening is that what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re looking at this. They are essentially observers</p>
<p>in metamathematical space, and they are picking a reference frame in metamathematical space,</p>
<p>and they are computationally bounded observers in metamathematical space,</p>
<p>which is causing them to deduce that the laws of metamathematics and the laws of mathematics,</p>
<p>like the laws of fluid mechanics, are much more understandable than this underlying</p>
<p>molecular dynamics. And so what gets really bizarre is thinking about kind of the analogy</p>
<p>between metamathematics, this idea of you exist in this sort of space of possible,</p>
<p>in this kind of mathematical space where the individual kind of points in the mathematical</p>
<p>space are statements in mathematics, and they&rsquo;re connected by proofs where one statement, you know,</p>
<p>you take a couple of different statements, you can use those to prove some other statement,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got this whole network of proofs. That&rsquo;s the kind of causal network of mathematics,</p>
<p>of what can prove what and so on. And you can say at any moment in the history of a mathematician,</p>
<p>of a single mathematical consciousness, you are in a single kind of slice of this</p>
<p>kind of metamathematical space. You know a certain set of mathematical statements.</p>
<p>You can then deduce with proofs, you can deduce other ones, and so on. You&rsquo;re kind of gradually</p>
<p>moving through metamathematical space. And so it&rsquo;s kind of the view is that the reason that</p>
<p>mathematicians perceive mathematics to have the sort of integrity and lack of kind of undecidability</p>
<p>and so on that they do is because they, like we as observers of the physical universe,</p>
<p>we have these limitations associated with computational boundedness, single thread of time,</p>
<p>consciousness limitations, basically, that the same thing is true of mathematicians perceiving</p>
<p>sort of metamathematical space. And so what&rsquo;s happening is that if you look at one of these</p>
<p>formalized mathematics systems, something like Pythagoras&rsquo;s theorem, it&rsquo;ll take, oh, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>what is it, maybe 10,000 individual little steps to prove Pythagoras&rsquo;s theorem. And one of the</p>
<p>bizarre things that&rsquo;s sort of an empirical fact that I&rsquo;m trying to understand a little bit better,</p>
<p>if you look at different formalized mathematics systems, they actually have different axioms</p>
<p>underneath that they can all prove Pythagoras&rsquo;s theorem. And so in other words, it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>like what happens with gases. We can have air molecules, we can have water molecules, but they</p>
<p>still have fluid dynamics. Both of them have fluid dynamics. And so similarly, at the level that</p>
<p>mathematicians care about mathematics, it&rsquo;s way above the molecular dynamics, so to speak.</p>
<p>And there are all kinds of weird things. Like, for example, one thing I was realizing recently</p>
<p>is that the quantum theory of mathematics, that&rsquo;s a very bizarre idea. But basically,</p>
<p>when you prove what is a proof is you&rsquo;ve got one statement in mathematics, you go through</p>
<p>other statements, you eventually get to a statement you&rsquo;re trying to prove, for example,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a path in metamathematical space. And that&rsquo;s a single path, a single proof is a single</p>
<p>path. But you can imagine there are other proofs of the same result. There are a bundle of proofs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole set of possible proofs. Yeah, you could think of it as branching,</p>
<p>similar to the quantum mechanics model that you were talking about. Exactly. And then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some invariance that you can formalize in the same way that you can for the quantum mechanical.</p>
<p>Right. So the question is, in proof space, as you start thinking about multiple proofs,</p>
<p>are there analogs of, for example, destructive interference of multiple proofs? So here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bizarre idea that&rsquo;s just a couple of days old, so not yet fully formed. But as you try and do that,</p>
<p>when you have two different proofs, it&rsquo;s like two photons going in different directions,</p>
<p>you have two proofs, which at an intermediate stage are incompatible. And that&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>destructive interference. Is it possible for this to instruct the engineering of automated proof</p>
<p>systems? Absolutely. I mean, as a practical matter, I mean, you know, this whole question,</p>
<p>in fact, Jonathan Gorod has a nice heuristic for automated theorem provers that&rsquo;s based on</p>
<p>our physics project that is looking for essentially using kind of using energy in our</p>
<p>models. Energy is kind of level of activity in this hypergraph. And so it&rsquo;s sort of a heuristic</p>
<p>for automated theorem proving about how do you pick which path to go down that is based on</p>
<p>essentially physics. And I mean, the thing that gets interesting about this is the way that one</p>
<p>can sort of have the interplay between, like, for example, a black hole. What is a black hole</p>
<p>in metamathematics? So the answer is, what is black hole in physics? A black hole in physics</p>
<p>is where in the simplest form of black hole time ends. That is all, you know, everything is crunched</p>
<p>down to the space time singularity, and everything just ends up at that singularity. So in our</p>
<p>models, and that&rsquo;s a little hard to understand in general relativity with continuous mathematics,</p>
<p>and what does singularity look like? In our models, it&rsquo;s something very pragmatic. It&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re applying these rules, time is moving forward. And then there comes a moment where</p>
<p>the rules, no rules apply. So time stops. It&rsquo;s kind of like the universe dies, that, you know,</p>
<p>that nothing happens in the universe anymore. Well, in mathematics, that&rsquo;s a decidable theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a theory. So theories which have undecidability, which are things like</p>
<p>arithmetic, set theory, all the serious models, theories in mathematics, they all have the feature</p>
<p>that there are proofs of arbitrarily long length. In something like Boolean algebra,</p>
<p>which is a decidable theory, there are, you know, any question in Boolean algebra, you can just go</p>
<p>crunch, crunch, crunch, and in a known number of steps, you can answer it. You know, satisfiability,</p>
<p>you know, might be hard, but it&rsquo;s still a bounded number of steps to answer any satisfiability</p>
<p>problem. And so that&rsquo;s the notion of a black hole in physics where time stops. That&rsquo;s analogous to</p>
<p>in mathematics where there aren&rsquo;t infinite length proofs, where when in physics, you know, you can</p>
<p>wander around the universe forever if you don&rsquo;t run into a black hole. If you run into a black</p>
<p>hole and time stops, you&rsquo;re done. And it&rsquo;s the same thing in mathematics between decidable</p>
<p>theories and undecidable theories. That&rsquo;s an example. And I think where sort of the attempt</p>
<p>to understand, so another question is kind of what is the general activity of metamathematics?</p>
<p>What is the bulk theory of metamathematics? So in the literature of mathematics, there are about</p>
<p>three million theorems that people have published. And those represent, it&rsquo;s kind of on this, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like on the earth, we would be, you know, we&rsquo;ve put cities in particular places on the earth,</p>
<p>but yet there is ultimately, you know, we know the earth is roughly spherical,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an underlying space. And we could just talk about, you know, the world of space</p>
<p>in terms of where our cities happen to be, but there&rsquo;s actually an underlying space. And so the</p>
<p>question is, what&rsquo;s that for metamathematics? And as we kind of explore what is, for example,</p>
<p>for mathematics, which is always likes taking sort of abstract limits. So an obvious abstract</p>
<p>limit for mathematics to take is the limit of the future of mathematics. That is, what will be,</p>
<p>you know, the ultimate structure of mathematics. And one of the things that&rsquo;s an empirical</p>
<p>observation about mathematics that&rsquo;s quite interesting is that a lot of theories in one</p>
<p>area of mathematics, algebraic geometry or something, might have, they play into another area</p>
<p>of mathematics. That same kind of fundamental construct seemed to occur in very different</p>
<p>areas of mathematics. And that&rsquo;s structurally captured a bit with category theory and things</p>
<p>like that. But I think that there&rsquo;s probably an understanding of this metamathematical space that</p>
<p>will explain why different areas of mathematics ultimately sort of map into the same thing.</p>
<p>And I mean, you know, my little challenge to myself is what&rsquo;s time dilation in metamathematics?</p>
<p>In other words, as you basically, as you move around in this mathematical space of possible</p>
<p>statements, you know, how does that moving around? It&rsquo;s basically what&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>that as you move around in the space of mathematical statements, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>changing from algebra to geometry to whatever else. And you&rsquo;re trying to prove the same theorem.</p>
<p>But as you try, if you keep on moving to these different places, it&rsquo;s slower to prove that</p>
<p>theorem because you keep on having to translate what you&rsquo;re doing back to where you started from.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the beginnings of the analog of time dilation in metamathematics.</p>
<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s probably fractional dimensions in this space as well.</p>
<p>Oh, this space is a very messy space. This space is much messier than physical space. I mean,</p>
<p>even in the models of physics, physical space is very tame compared to branchial space and</p>
<p>ruleal space. I mean, the mathematical structure, you know, branchial space is probably more like</p>
<p>Hilbert space, but it&rsquo;s a rather complicated Hilbert space. And ruleal space is more like</p>
<p>this weird infinity groupoid story of Grothendieck. And, you know, I can explain that a little bit</p>
<p>because in metamathematical space, a path in metamathematical space is a path between two</p>
<p>statements is a way to get by proofs, is a way to find a proof that goes from one statement to</p>
<p>another. And so one of the things you can do, you can think about is between statements, you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>proofs and they are paths between statements. Okay, so now you can go to the next level and you</p>
<p>can ask, what about a mapping from one proof to another? And so that&rsquo;s in category theory,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a higher category, the notion of higher categories where you&rsquo;re mapping not just</p>
<p>between objects, but you&rsquo;re mapping between the mappings between objects and so on.</p>
<p>And so you can keep doing that. You keep saying higher order proofs. I want mappings between</p>
<p>proofs between proofs and so on. And that limiting structure, oh, by the way, one thing that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>interesting is imagine in proof space, you&rsquo;ve got these two proofs. And the question is,</p>
<p>what is the topology of proof space? In other words, if you take these two paths,</p>
<p>can you continuously deform them into each other? Or is there some big hole in the middle that</p>
<p>prevents you from continuously deforming them one into the other? It&rsquo;s kind of like, you know,</p>
<p>when you think about some, I don&rsquo;t know, some puzzle, for example, you&rsquo;re moving pieces around</p>
<p>on some puzzle, and you can think about the space of possible states of the puzzle.</p>
<p>And you can make this graph that shows from one state of the puzzle to another state of</p>
<p>the puzzle and so on. And sometimes you can easily get from one state to any other state,</p>
<p>but sometimes there&rsquo;ll be a hole in that space. And there&rsquo;ll be, you know, you always have to</p>
<p>go around the circuitous route to get from here to there. There won&rsquo;t be any direct way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a question of whether there&rsquo;s sort of an obstruction in the space. And so the question</p>
<p>is in proof space, what is the, what are, you know, what does it mean if there&rsquo;s an obstruction in proof</p>
<p>space? Yeah, I don&rsquo;t even know what an obstruction means in proof space because for it to be an</p>
<p>obstruction, it should be reachable some other way from some other place, right? So this is like</p>
<p>an unreachable part of the graph. No, it&rsquo;s not just an unreachable part. It&rsquo;s a part where</p>
<p>there are paths that go one way, there are paths that go the other way. And this question of</p>
<p>homotopy in mathematics is this question, can you continuously deform, you know, from one path to</p>
<p>another path or do you have to go in a jump, so to speak? So it&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re going around a</p>
<p>sphere, for example, if you&rsquo;re going around, I don&rsquo;t know, a cylinder or something, you can</p>
<p>wind around one way and you can, there&rsquo;s no paths where you can easily deform one path into another</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just sort of sitting on the same side of the cylinder. But when you&rsquo;ve got something</p>
<p>that winds all the way around a cylinder, you can&rsquo;t continuously deform that down to a point</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s stuck wrapped around. My intuition about proof spaces, you should be</p>
<p>able to deform it. I mean that because then otherwise it doesn&rsquo;t even make sense because</p>
<p>if the topology matters of the way you move about the space that I don&rsquo;t even know what that means.</p>
<p>Well, what it would mean is that you would have one way of doing a proof of something over here</p>
<p>in algebra and another way of doing a proof of something over here in geometry. And there would</p>
<p>not be an intermediate way to map between those proofs. How would that be possible if they started</p>
<p>the same place and ended the same place? Well, it&rsquo;s the same thing as, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got points on a, you know, if we&rsquo;ve got paths on a cylinder.</p>
<p>Now I understand how it works in physical space, but it just doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it feels like proof space shouldn&rsquo;t have that. Okay. I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. I don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll know very soon because we get to do some experiments. This is</p>
<p>the great thing about this stuff is that in fact, you know, in the next few days,</p>
<p>I hope to do a bunch of experiments on this. So you&rsquo;re playing like proofs in this kind of space.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. I mean, so, you know, this is toy, you know, theories and, you know, we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>good. So this kind of segues to perhaps another thing, which is this whole idea of multi computation.</p>
<p>So this is another kind of bigger idea that, so, okay, this has to do with how do you make models</p>
<p>of things? And it&rsquo;s going to, so I&rsquo;ve sort of claimed that there&rsquo;ve been sort of four epochs</p>
<p>in the history of making models of things. And this multi computation thing is the fourth,</p>
<p>is a new epoch. What are the first three? The first one is back in antiquity, ancient Greek</p>
<p>times. People were like, what&rsquo;s the universe made of? Oh, it&rsquo;s made of, you know, everything is</p>
<p>water, Thales, you know, or everything is made of atoms. It&rsquo;s sort of, what are things made of?</p>
<p>Or the, you know, there are these crystal spheres that represent where the planets are and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a structural idea of how the universe is constructed. There&rsquo;s no real notion of dynamics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, what is the universe? How is the universe made? Then we get to the 1600s and we</p>
<p>get to the sort of revolution of mathematics being introduced into physics. And then we have this</p>
<p>kind of idea of you write down some equation. The, what happens in the universe is the solving of</p>
<p>that equation. Time enters, but it&rsquo;s usually just a parameter. We just can, you know, sort of slide</p>
<p>it back and forth and say, here&rsquo;s where it is. Okay. Then we come to this kind of computational</p>
<p>idea that I kind of started really pushing in the early 1980s as a result, you know,</p>
<p>the things that we were talking about before about complexity, that was my motivation. But</p>
<p>the bigger story was the story of kind of computational models of things. And the big</p>
<p>difference there from the mathematical models is, in mathematical models, there&rsquo;s an equation,</p>
<p>you solve it, you kind of slide time to the place where you want it. In computational models,</p>
<p>you give the rule and then you just say, go run the rule. And time is not something you get to</p>
<p>slide. Time is something where it just, you run the rule, time goes in steps. And that&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>work out how the system behaves. You don&rsquo;t, time is not just a parameter. Time is something that</p>
<p>is about the running of these rules. And so there&rsquo;s this computational irreducibility. You can&rsquo;t jump</p>
<p>ahead in time. But there&rsquo;s still, important thing is there&rsquo;s still one thread of time. It&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>the case, you know, the cellular automaton state, then it has the next state and the next state and</p>
<p>so on. The thing that is kind of, we&rsquo;ve sort of tipped off by quantum mechanics in a sense,</p>
<p>although it actually feeds back even into relativity and things like that, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these multiple threads of time. And so in this multi computation paradigm, the kind of idea is,</p>
<p>instead of there being the single thread of time, there are these kind of distributed asynchronous</p>
<p>threads of time that are happening. And the thing that&rsquo;s sort of different there is if you want to</p>
<p>know what happened, if you say what happened in the system, in the case of the computational</p>
<p>paradigm, you just say, well, after a thousand steps, we got this result, right? But in the</p>
<p>multi computational paradigm, after a thousand steps, not even clear what a thousand steps means,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got all these different threads of time, but there is no state. There&rsquo;s all these</p>
<p>different possible, you know, there&rsquo;s all these different paths. And so the only way you can know</p>
<p>what happened is to have some kind of observer who is saying, here&rsquo;s how to parse the results</p>
<p>of what was going on. Right. But that observer is embedded and they don&rsquo;t have a complete picture.</p>
<p>So in the case of physics, that&rsquo;s right. Yes. And then in the, but that&rsquo;s, but so the idea is</p>
<p>that in this multi computation setup, that it&rsquo;s this idea of these multiple threads of time</p>
<p>and models that are based on that. And this is similar to what people think about in</p>
<p>non deterministic computation. So you have a Turing machine. Usually it has a definite state. It</p>
<p>follows another state, follows another state. But typically what people have done when they</p>
<p>thought about these kinds of things is they&rsquo;ve said, well, there are all these possible paths,</p>
<p>and non deterministic Turing machine can follow all these possible paths, but we just want one</p>
<p>of them. We just want the one that&rsquo;s the winner that factors the number or whatever else. And</p>
<p>similarly, it&rsquo;s the same story in logic programming and so on, but we say, we&rsquo;ve got this goal,</p>
<p>find us a path to that goal. I just want one path, then I&rsquo;m happy. Or theorem proving,</p>
<p>same story. I just want one proof and then I&rsquo;m happy. What&rsquo;s happening in multi computation</p>
<p>in physics is we actually care about many paths. And well, there is a case, for example, probabilistic</p>
<p>programming is a version of multi computation in which you&rsquo;re looking at all the paths. You&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>asking for probabilities of things. But in a sense in physics, we&rsquo;re taking different kinds of</p>
<p>samplings. For example, in quantum mechanics, we&rsquo;re taking a different kind of sampling</p>
<p>of all these multiple paths. But the thing that is notable is that when you&rsquo;re an observer embedded</p>
<p>in this thing, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, with various other sort of footnotes and so on,</p>
<p>it is inevitable that the thing that you parse out of the system looks like general relativity</p>
<p>and quantum mechanics. In other words, that just by the very structure of this multi computational</p>
<p>setup, it inevitably is the case that you have certain emergent laws. Now, why is this perhaps</p>
<p>not surprising? In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, there are sort of inevitable emergent</p>
<p>laws of sort of gas dynamics that are independent of the details of the molecular dynamics,</p>
<p>sort of the same kind of thing. But I think what happens is what&rsquo;s a sort of a funny thing that I</p>
<p>just been understanding very recently is when when I kind of introduced this whole sort of</p>
<p>computational paradigm complexity ish thing back in the 80s, it was kind of like a big downer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff you can&rsquo;t say about what systems will do.</p>
<p>And then what I realized is and then you might say, now we&rsquo;ve got multi computation, it&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>worse. You know, it isn&rsquo;t just one thread of time that we can&rsquo;t explain. It&rsquo;s all these threads of</p>
<p>time. It can&rsquo;t explain anything. But the following thing happens because there is all this</p>
<p>irreducibility and any detailed thing you might want to answer, it&rsquo;s very hard to answer. But</p>
<p>when you have an observer who has certain characteristics like computational boundedness,</p>
<p>sequentiality of time and so on, that observer only samples certain aspects of this incredible</p>
<p>complexity going on in this multi computational system. And that observer is sensitive only to</p>
<p>to some underlying core structure of this multi computational system. There is all this</p>
<p>irreducible computation going on, all these details. But to that kind of observer, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important is only the core structure of multi computation, which means that observer</p>
<p>observes comparatively simple laws. And I think it is inevitable that that observer</p>
<p>observes laws which are mathematically structured like general relativity and quantum</p>
<p>mechanics, which, by the way, are the same law in our in our model of physics.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an explanation why there are simple laws that explain a lot for this observer.</p>
<p>Potentially, yes. But what the place where this gets really interesting is there are all these</p>
<p>fields of science where people have kind of gotten stuck, where they say we&rsquo;d really love to</p>
<p>have a physics like theory of economics. We&rsquo;d really love to have a physics like law and</p>
<p>linguistics. You got to talk about molecular biology here. OK, so where where where does</p>
<p>multi computation come in for biology? Economics is super interesting, too, but biology. OK,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about that. So let&rsquo;s talk about chemistry for a second. OK, so I mean, I have</p>
<p>to say, you know, this is it&rsquo;s such a weird business for me because, you know, there are</p>
<p>these kind of paradigmatic ideas and then the actual applications. And it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>said, I know nothing about chemistry. I learned all the chemistry I know, you know, the night</p>
<p>before some exam when I was 14 years old. But I&rsquo;ve actually learned a bunch more chemistry.</p>
<p>And in Wolfram language these days, we have really pretty nice symbolic representation</p>
<p>of chemistry. And in understanding the design of that, I&rsquo;ve actually, I think, learned a certain</p>
<p>amount of chemistry. So if you quizzed me on sort of basic high school chemistry, I would</p>
<p>probably totally fail. But but but OK, so what is chemistry? I mean, chemistry is sort of a</p>
<p>story of, you know, chemical reactions are like you&rsquo;ve got this particular chemical that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>represented as some graph of, you know, these are these are this configuration of molecules</p>
<p>with these bonds and so on. And a chemical reaction happens. You&rsquo;ve got these sort of</p>
<p>two graphs. They interact in some way. You&rsquo;ve got another graph or multiple other graphs</p>
<p>out. So that&rsquo;s kind of the sort of the the abstract view of what&rsquo;s happening in chemistry.</p>
<p>And so when you do a chemical synthesis, for example, you are given certain sort of these</p>
<p>are possible reactions that can happen. And you&rsquo;re asked, can you piece together this</p>
<p>sequence of such reactions, a sequence of such sort of axiomatic reactions usually called name</p>
<p>reactions in chemistry? Can you piece together a sequence of these reactions so that you get out</p>
<p>at the end this great molecule you were trying to synthesize? And so that&rsquo;s a story very much</p>
<p>like theorem proving. And people have done actually they start in the 1960s looking at</p>
<p>kind of the theorem proving approach to that, although it didn&rsquo;t really it didn&rsquo;t it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>was sort of done too early, I think. But anyway, so that&rsquo;s kind of the view is that that chemistry,</p>
<p>chemical reactions are the story of of all these different sort of paths of possible things that</p>
<p>go on. OK, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s go to an even lower level. Let&rsquo;s say instead of asking about which species</p>
<p>of molecules we&rsquo;re talking about, let&rsquo;s look at individual molecules and let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at individual molecules and they are having chemical reactions and we&rsquo;re building up this</p>
<p>big graph of all these reactions that are happening. OK, so so then we&rsquo;ve got this big</p>
<p>graph. And by the way, that big graph is incredibly similar to this hypergraph rewriting things.</p>
<p>In fact, in the underlying theory of multi computation there, these things we call token</p>
<p>event graphs, which are basically you&rsquo;ve broken your state into tokens. Like in the case of a</p>
<p>hypergraph, you&rsquo;ve broken it into hyper edges and each event is just consuming some number of tokens</p>
<p>and producing some number of tokens. But then you have to there&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done</p>
<p>on update rules in terms of what they actually are for chemistry. Yeah, what they offer are</p>
<p>observed chemistry. Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. And we&rsquo;ve been working on that actually because we</p>
<p>have this beautiful system and Wolfram language for representing chemistry symbolically. So we</p>
<p>actually have you know, this is this is an ongoing thing to actually figure out what they are for</p>
<p>some practical cases. Does that require human injection or can it be automatically discovered</p>
<p>these update rules? Well, if we can do chemistry better, we could probably discover them</p>
<p>automatically. But I think in, in reality, right now, it&rsquo;s like there are these particular</p>
<p>reactions. And really, to understand what&rsquo;s going on, we&rsquo;re probably going to pick a particular</p>
<p>subtype of chemistry. And just because because let me explain where this is going to the place</p>
<p>that his his where this is going. So got this whole network of all these molecules,</p>
<p>having all these reactions and so on. And this is some whole multi computational story because each</p>
<p>each sort of chemical reaction event is its own separate event. We&rsquo;re saying they will happen</p>
<p>asynchronously. We&rsquo;re not describing in what order they happen. You know, maybe that order is governed</p>
<p>by some quantum mechanics thing doesn&rsquo;t really matter. We&rsquo;re just saying they happen in some</p>
<p>order. And then we ask, what is the what what&rsquo;s the you know, how do we think about the system?</p>
<p>Well, this thing is some kind of big multi computational system. The question is what is</p>
<p>the chemical observer? And one possible chemical observer is all you care about is did you make</p>
<p>that particular drug molecule? You&rsquo;re just asking, you know, the for the one path. Another thing you</p>
<p>might care about is I want to know the concentration of each species. I want to know,</p>
<p>you know, at every stage, I&rsquo;m going to solve the differential equations that represent the</p>
<p>concentrations. And I want to know what those all are. But there&rsquo;s more. Because when and it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like you&rsquo;re going below and statistical mechanics, there&rsquo;s kind of all these molecules</p>
<p>bouncing around. And you might say, we&rsquo;re just going to ignore we&rsquo;re just going to look at the</p>
<p>aggregate densities of certain kinds of molecules. But you can look at a lower level, you can look</p>
<p>at this whole graph of possible interactions. And so the kind of the idea would be what, you know,</p>
<p>is the only chemical observer, one who just cares about overall concentrations? Or can there be a</p>
<p>chemical observer who cares about this network of what happened? And so that the question then is,</p>
<p>so let me give an analogy. So this is where I think this is potentially very relevant to molecular</p>
<p>biology and molecular computing. When we think about a computation, usually, we say it&rsquo;s input,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s output, we, you know, or chemistry, we say there&rsquo;s this input, we&rsquo;re going to make this</p>
<p>molecule as the output. But what if what we actually encode, what if our computation, what</p>
<p>thing we care about is some part of this dynamic network? What if it isn&rsquo;t just the input and the</p>
<p>output that we care about? What if there&rsquo;s some dynamics of the network that we care about? Now,</p>
<p>imagine you&rsquo;re a chemical observer, what is a chemical observer? Well, in molecular biology,</p>
<p>there are all kinds of weird sorts of observers, there are membranes that exist, that have, you</p>
<p>know, different kinds of molecules that can bind to them, things like this, it&rsquo;s not obvious that</p>
<p>the from a human scale, we just measure the concentration of something is the relevant story.</p>
<p>We can imagine that, for example, when we look at this whole network of possible reactions,</p>
<p>we can imagine, you know, at a physical level, we can imagine, well, what was the actual momentum</p>
<p>direction of that of that molecule? What was it which we don&rsquo;t pay any attention to when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just talking about chemical concentrations? What was the orientation of that molecule,</p>
<p>these kinds of things? And so here&rsquo;s the place where I&rsquo;m, I have a little suspicion, okay? So</p>
<p>one of the questions in biology is what matters in biology? And that is, you know, we have all</p>
<p>these chemical reactions, we have all these, all these molecular processes going on in, you know,</p>
<p>in biological systems, what matters? And, you know, one of the things is to be able to tell</p>
<p>what matters, well, so a big story of the what matters question was what happened in genetics</p>
<p>in 1953, when DNA, when it was figured out how DNA worked. Because before that time, you know,</p>
<p>genetics have been all these different effects and complicated things. And then it was realized,</p>
<p>ah, there&rsquo;s something new, a molecule can store information, which wasn&rsquo;t obvious before that</p>
<p>time, a single molecule can store information. So there&rsquo;s a place where there can be something</p>
<p>important that&rsquo;s happening in molecular biology, and it&rsquo;s just in the sequence that&rsquo;s storing</p>
<p>information in a molecule. So the possibility now is imagine this dynamic network, this, you know,</p>
<p>causal graphs and multiway causal graphs and so on, that represent all of these different reactions</p>
<p>between molecules. What if there is some aspect of that, that is storing information that&rsquo;s relevant</p>
<p>for molecular biology? And the dynamic aspect of that. Yes, that&rsquo;s right. So that it&rsquo;s similar to</p>
<p>how the structure of a DNA molecule stores information, it could be the dynamics of the</p>
<p>system somehow stores information. And this kind of process might allow you to give predictions</p>
<p>of what that would be. Well, yes, but also imagine that you&rsquo;re trying to do, for example, imagine</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to do molecular computation. Okay. You might think the way we&rsquo;re going to do molecular</p>
<p>computation is we&rsquo;re just going to run the thing. We&rsquo;re going to see what came out. We&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>see what molecule came out. This is saying that&rsquo;s not the only thing you can do. There is a different</p>
<p>kind of chemical observer that you can imagine constructing, which is somehow sensitive to this</p>
<p>dynamic network. Exactly how that works, how we make that measurement, I don&rsquo;t know, but a few</p>
<p>ideas, but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important, so to speak. And that means, and by the way, you can do the</p>
<p>same thing even for Turing machines. You can say, if you have a multiway Turing machine, you can say,</p>
<p>how do you compute with a multiway Turing machine? You can&rsquo;t say, well, we&rsquo;ve got this input and this</p>
<p>output because the thing has all these threads of time and it&rsquo;s got lots of outputs. And so then you</p>
<p>say, well, what does it even mean to be a universal multiway Turing machine? I don&rsquo;t fully know the</p>
<p>answer to that. It&rsquo;s an interesting idea. It would freak Turing out for sure, because then the</p>
<p>dynamics of the trajectory of the computation matters. Yes. Yes. I mean, but the thing is</p>
<p>that that, so this is again, a story of what&rsquo;s the observer, so to speak. In chemistry, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the observer there? Now to give an example of where that might matter, a very sort of present</p>
<p>day example is in immunology, where we have whatever it is, 10 billion different kinds of</p>
<p>antibodies that are all these different shapes and so on. We have a trillion different kinds of T</p>
<p>cell receptors that we produce. And the traditional theory of immunology is this clonal</p>
<p>selection theory where we are constantly producing, randomly producing all these different antibodies.</p>
<p>And as soon as one of them binds to an antigen, then that one gets amplified and we produce more</p>
<p>of that antibody and so on. Back in the 1960s, an immunologist called Nils Joerner, who was the guy</p>
<p>who invented monoclonal antibodies, various other things, kind of had this network theory of the</p>
<p>immune system where it would be like, well, we produce antibodies, but then we produce antibodies</p>
<p>to the antibodies, anti antibodies, and we produce anti anti antibodies. And we get this whole dynamic</p>
<p>network of interactions between different immune system cells. And that was kind of a qualitative</p>
<p>theory at that time. And I&rsquo;ve been a little disappointed because I&rsquo;ve been studying immunology</p>
<p>a bit recently. And I knew something about this like 35 years ago or something. And I knew,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;d read a bunch of the books and I talked to a bunch of the people and so on.</p>
<p>And it was like an emerging theoretical immunology world. And then I look at the books now,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very thick because they&rsquo;ve got, you know, there&rsquo;s just a ton known about immunology</p>
<p>and, you know, all these different pathways, all these different details and so on.</p>
<p>But the theoretical sections seem to have shrunk. And so it&rsquo;s so the question is, what, you know,</p>
<p>for example, immune memory, where is the where does the immune memory reside? Is it actually</p>
<p>some cells sitting in our bone marrow that is, you know, living for the whole of our lives that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to spring into action as soon as we&rsquo;re shown the same antigen? Or is it something different</p>
<p>from that? Is it something more dynamic? Is it something more like some network of interactions</p>
<p>between these different kinds of immune system cells and so on? And it&rsquo;s known that there are</p>
<p>plenty of interactions between T cells and, you know, there&rsquo;s plenty of dynamics. But what the</p>
<p>consequence of that dynamics is, is not clear. And to have a qualitative theory for that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to exist. In fact, I was just been trying to study this. So I&rsquo;m quite incomplete in my study</p>
<p>of these things. But I was a little bit taken aback because I&rsquo;ve been looking at these things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, and then they get to the end where they have the most advanced theory that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got. And it turns out it&rsquo;s a cellular automaton theory. It&rsquo;s like, okay, well, at least I understand</p>
<p>that theory. But but, you know, I think that the possibility is that in that this is a place where</p>
<p>if you want to know, you know, explain roughly how the immune system works, it ends up being</p>
<p>this sort of dynamic network. And then the the, you know, the immune consciousness, so to speak,</p>
<p>the observer ends up being something that, you know, in the end, it&rsquo;s kind of like, does the</p>
<p>human get sick or whatever? But it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s something which is a complicated story that</p>
<p>relates to this whole sort of dynamic network and so on. And I think that&rsquo;s another place where this</p>
<p>kind of notion of where I think multi computation has the possibility. See, one of the things, okay,</p>
<p>you can end up with something where yes, there is a general relativity in there. But it turns up,</p>
<p>but it may turn out that the observer who sees general relativity in the immune system is an</p>
<p>observer that&rsquo;s irrelevant to what we care about about the immune system. I mean, it could be yes,</p>
<p>there is some effect where, you know, there&rsquo;s some, you know, time dilation of T cells interacting</p>
<p>with whatever. But it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s an effect that&rsquo;s just irrelevant. And the thing we actually</p>
<p>care about is things about, you know, what happens when you have a vaccine that goes into some place</p>
<p>in shapespace? And, you know, how does that affect other places in shapespace? And how does that spread?</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s the what&rsquo;s the analog of the speed of light in shapespace, for example, that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an important issue. If you have one of these dynamic theories, it&rsquo;s like, you know, you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re poking to shapespace by having, you know, let&rsquo;s say, a vaccine or something that has a</p>
<p>particular configuration in shapespace. How, how quickly as this dynamic network spreads out, how</p>
<p>quickly do you get sort of other antibodies in different places in shapespace, things like that?</p>
<p>When you say shapespace, you mean the shape of the molecules? And then, so this is like,</p>
<p>could be deeply connected to the protein and multi protein folding, all of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>To be able to say something interesting about the the dance of proteins that</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>then actually has an impact on helping develop drugs, for example, or has an impact on</p>
<p>virology, immunology, helping.</p>
<p>Well, I think the big thing is, you know, when we think about molecular biology, the you know,</p>
<p>what, what is the qualitative way to think about it? You know, in other words, is it chemical</p>
<p>reaction networks? Is it, you know, genetics, you know, DNA, big, you know, big news, it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a digital aspect to the whole thing. You know, what is the qualitative way to think about</p>
<p>how things work in biology? You know, when we think about, I don&rsquo;t know, some phenomenon like</p>
<p>aging or something, which is a big, complicated phenomenon, which just seems to have all these</p>
<p>different tentacles. Is it really the case that that can be thought about in some, you know,</p>
<p>without DNA, when people were describing, you know, genetic phenomena, there were, you know,</p>
<p>dominant recessive, this, that and the other got very, very complicated. And then people realize,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s just, you know, and what is a gene and so on and so on and so on. Then people realize</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just base pairs. And there&rsquo;s this digital representation. And so the question is, what is</p>
<p>the overarching representation that we can now start to think about using a molecular biology?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how this will work out. And this is again, one of these things where, and the place</p>
<p>where that gets important is, you know, maybe molecular biology is doing molecular computing</p>
<p>by using some dynamic process that is something where it is very happily saying, oh, I just got</p>
<p>a result. It&rsquo;s in the dynamic structure of this network. Now I&rsquo;m going to go and do some other</p>
<p>thing based on that result, for example. But we&rsquo;re like, oh, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. You know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, we just measured the levels of these chemicals and we couldn&rsquo;t conclude anything.</p>
<p>But it just, we&rsquo;re looking at the wrong thing. And so that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s kind of the potential</p>
<p>there. And it&rsquo;s, I mean, these things are, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s for me, it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve not really,</p>
<p>that was not a view. I mean, I&rsquo;ve thought about molecular computing for ages and ages and ages.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always imagined that the big story is kind of the original promise of nanotechnology</p>
<p>of like, can we make a molecular scale constructor that will just build a molecule in any shape?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m now increasingly concluding that&rsquo;s not the big point. The big point is</p>
<p>something more dynamic. That will be an interesting endpoint for any of these things. But that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>perhaps not the thing, you know, because the one example we have in molecular computing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really working is us biological organisms. And, you know, maybe the thing that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>there is not this, you know, what chemicals do you make, so to speak, but more this kind of</p>
<p>dynamic process. The dynamic process. And then you can have a good model like the hypergraph to then</p>
<p>explore what, like simulate again, make predictions. And if they, I think just have a way to reason</p>
<p>about biology. I mean, it&rsquo;s hard, you know, but first of all, biology doesn&rsquo;t have theories like</p>
<p>physics. You know, physics is a much more successful sort of global theory kind of area.</p>
<p>You know, biology, what are the global theories of biology? Pretty much Darwinian evolution. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the only global theory of biology. You know, are there any other theories just say, well,</p>
<p>the kidneys work this way, this thing works this way and so on. There isn&rsquo;t, I suppose,</p>
<p>another global theory is digital information in DNA. That&rsquo;s another sort of global fact about</p>
<p>biology. But the difficult thing to do is to match something you have a model of in the hypergraph</p>
<p>to the actual, like how do you discover the theory? How do you discover the theory? Okay,</p>
<p>you have something that looks nice and makes sense, but like you have to match it to validation.</p>
<p>Oh, sure. Right. And that&rsquo;s tricky because you&rsquo;re walking around in the dark.</p>
<p>Not entirely. I mean, so, you know, for example, in what we&rsquo;ve been trying to think about is</p>
<p>take actual chemical reactions. Okay. So, you know, one of my goals is can I compute the primes</p>
<p>with molecules? Okay. If I can do that, then I kind of, maybe I can compute things. And, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this nice automated lab, these guys, these Emerald Cloud Lab people have built with</p>
<p>Wolfram language and so on. That&rsquo;s an actual physical lab and you send it a piece of Wolfram</p>
<p>language code and it goes and, you know, actually does physical experiments. And so one of my goals,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not a test tube kind of guy, I&rsquo;m more of a software kind of person, is can I make</p>
<p>something where, you know, in this automated lab, we can actually get it so that there&rsquo;s some gel</p>
<p>that we made and, you know, the positions of the stripes are the primes. I love it. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that would be an example of where, and that would be with a particular, you know,</p>
<p>framework for actually doing the molecular computing, you know, with particular kinds</p>
<p>of molecules. And there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of ambient technological mess, so to speak,</p>
<p>associated with, oh, is it carbon? Is it this? Is it that? You know, is it important that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bromine atom here, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is all chemistry that I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>much about. And, you know, that&rsquo;s a sort of, you know, unfortunately that&rsquo;s down at the level,</p>
<p>you know, I would like to be at the software level, not at the level of the transistors,</p>
<p>so to speak. But in chemistry, you know, there&rsquo;s a certain amount we have to do, I think, at the</p>
<p>level of transistors before we get up to being able to do it. Although, you know, the automated</p>
<p>labs certainly help in setting that up. I talked to a guy named Charles Hoskinson.</p>
<p>He mentioned that he&rsquo;s collaborating with you. He&rsquo;s an interesting guy. He sends me papers on</p>
<p>speaking of automated theorem proving a lot. He&rsquo;s exceptionally well read on that area as well.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the nature of your collaboration with him? He&rsquo;s the creator of Cardano.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the nature of the collaboration between Cardano and the whole space of blockchain and</p>
<p>Wolfram, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram blockchain, all that kind of stuff? Well, OK, we&rsquo;re segueing to a</p>
<p>slightly different world. But so although not completely unconnected. Right. The whole thing</p>
<p>is somehow connected. I know. I mean, you know, the strange thing in my life is I&rsquo;ve sort of</p>
<p>alternated between doing basic science and doing technology about five times in my life so far.</p>
<p>And the thing that&rsquo;s just crazy about it is, you know, every time I do one of these alternations,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s not going to be a way back to the other thing. And like I thought for this</p>
<p>physics project, I thought, you know, we&rsquo;re doing fundamental theory of physics. Maybe it&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>an application in 200 years. But now I&rsquo;ve realized actually this multi computation idea is is</p>
<p>applicable here now. It&rsquo;s and in fact, it&rsquo;s also giving us this way. I&rsquo;ll just mention one other</p>
<p>thing and then talk about blockchain. The the question of actually that relates to several</p>
<p>different things. But but one of the things about about OK, so our Wolfram language, which is our</p>
<p>attempt to kind of represent everything in the world computationally. And it&rsquo;s the thing I kind</p>
<p>of started building 40 years ago in the form of actual Wolfram language 35 years ago. It&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of this idea of can we can we express things about the world in computational terms? And, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve come a long way in being able to do that. Wolfram Alpha is kind of the consumer version of</p>
<p>that where you&rsquo;re just using natural language as input. The and it turns it into our symbolic</p>
<p>language. And that&rsquo;s, you know, the symbolic language Wolfram language is what people use</p>
<p>and have been using for the last 33 years. Actually, Mathematica, which is its first</p>
<p>instantiation, will be one third of a century old in in October. And that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>interesting. What do you mean one third of a century? I mean, 33 or 30? What are we? 33 and a</p>
<p>third. 33 and a third. So I&rsquo;ve never heard of anyone celebrating that anniversary, but I like</p>
<p>it. I know. A third of a century, though, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of get many, many slices of a century</p>
<p>that are interesting. But but, you know, I think that the the thing that&rsquo;s really striking about</p>
<p>that is that means, you know, including the whole sort of technology stack I built around that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about 40 years old. And that means it&rsquo;s a significant fraction of the total age of the</p>
<p>computer industry. And it&rsquo;s I mean, I think it&rsquo;s cool that we can still run, you know,</p>
<p>Mathematica version one programs today and so on. And we&rsquo;ve sort of maintained compatibility.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been just building this big tower all those years of just more and more and more</p>
<p>computational capabilities. It&rsquo;s sort of interesting. We just made this this picture</p>
<p>of kind of the different kind of threads of of of computational content, of, you know,</p>
<p>mathematical content and and, you know, all sorts of things with, you know, data and graphs and</p>
<p>whatever else. And what you see in this picture is about the first 10 years. It&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a few threads. And then then about maybe 15, 20 years ago, it kind of explodes</p>
<p>in this whole collection, different threads of all these different capabilities that are now</p>
<p>part of open language and representing different things in the world. But the thing that was super</p>
<p>lucky in some sense is it&rsquo;s all based on one idea. It&rsquo;s all based on the idea of symbolic expressions</p>
<p>and transformation rules for symbolic expressions, which was kind of what I originally</p>
<p>put into this SMP system back in 1979 that was a predecessor of the whole open language stack.</p>
<p>So that idea was an idea that I got from sort of trying to understand mathematical logic and so on.</p>
<p>It was my attempt to kind of make a general human comprehensible model of computation</p>
<p>of just everything is a symbolic expression. And all you do is transform symbolic expressions.</p>
<p>And, you know, in in retrospect, I was very lucky that I understood as little as I understood then,</p>
<p>because had I understood more, I would have been completely freaked out about all the different</p>
<p>ways that that kind of model can can fail. Because what do you do when you have a symbolic</p>
<p>expression, you make transformations for symbolic expressions? Well, for example, one question is,</p>
<p>there may be many transformations that could be made in a very multi computational kind of way.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re doing is picking, we&rsquo;re using the first transformation</p>
<p>that applies. And we keep doing that until we reach a fixed point. And that&rsquo;s the result. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a very, it&rsquo;s kind of a way of sort of sliding around the edge of multi computation.</p>
<p>And back when I was working on SMP and things, I actually thought about these questions about</p>
<p>about how, you know, how, what determines the this kind of evaluation path. So for example,</p>
<p>you know, you work out Fibonacci, you know, Fibonacci is a recursive thing, f of n is f of</p>
<p>n minus one plus f of n minus two, and you get this whole tree of recursion, right? And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the question of how do you evaluate that tree of recursion? Do you do it sort of depth first,</p>
<p>where you go all the way down one side? Do you do it breadth first, where you&rsquo;re kind of collecting</p>
<p>the terms together, where you know that, you know, f of eight plus f of seven, f of seven,</p>
<p>plus f of six, you can collect the f of sevens, and so on. These are, you know, I didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that at the time, it&rsquo;s kind of funny, I was working on on gauge field theories back in 1979.</p>
<p>And I was also working on the evaluation model in SMP. And they&rsquo;re the same problem. But it took me</p>
<p>40 more years to realize that. And this question about how you do this sort of evaluation front,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a question of reference frames. It&rsquo;s a question of kind of the story of I mean,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s, that is basically this question of, in what order is the universe evaluated?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, and so what you realize is, there&rsquo;s this whole sort of world of different kinds of</p>
<p>computation that you can do, sort of multi computationally. And that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting thing. It has a lot of implications for distributed computing, and so on. It also has</p>
<p>a potential implication for blockchain, which we haven&rsquo;t fully worked out, which is, and this is</p>
<p>not what we&rsquo;re doing with Cardano, but but this is a different thing. The this is something where</p>
<p>one of the questions is, when you have, in a sense, blockchain is a deeply sequentialized</p>
<p>story of time. Because in blockchain, there&rsquo;s just one copy of the ledger. And you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>this is what happened, you know, time has progressed in this way. And there are little</p>
<p>things around the edges, as you try and reach consensus and so on. And, and, you know, actually,</p>
<p>we just recently, we&rsquo;ve had this little conference we organized about the theory of distributed</p>
<p>consensus, because I realized that a bunch of interesting things that some of our science can</p>
<p>tell one about that. But that&rsquo;s a different let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s not go down that that part. Yeah,</p>
<p>but distributed consensus that still has a sequential there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>sequentiality. So don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re thinking through like how to apply multi computation to</p>
<p>blockchain. Yes. And so so that becomes a story of, you know, instead of transactions all having</p>
<p>to settle in one ledger, it&rsquo;s like a story of all these different ledgers. And they all have to have</p>
<p>some ultimate consistency, which is what causal invariance would give one, but it can take a</p>
<p>while. And the it can take a while is kind of like quantum mechanics. So it&rsquo;s kind of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening is there these different paths of history that correspond to, you know, in one path</p>
<p>of history, you got paid this amount in another path of history, you got paid this amount. In the</p>
<p>end, the universe will always become consistent. Now, now the way it will it works is, okay, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little bit more complicated than that. What happens is, the way space is knitted together</p>
<p>in our theory of physics is through all these events. And the the idea is that the way that</p>
<p>economic space is knitted together is between is there these autonomous events that essentially</p>
<p>knit together economic space. So there are all these threads of transactions that are happening.</p>
<p>And the question is, can they be made consistent? Are there is there something forcing them to be</p>
<p>sort of a consistent fabric of economic reality? And sort of what this has led me to is trying to</p>
<p>realize how does economics fundamentally work? And, you know, what is economics? And, you know,</p>
<p>what what are the atoms of economics, so to speak? And so what I&rsquo;ve kind of realized is that, that</p>
<p>sort of the perhaps I don&rsquo;t even know if this is right yet, there&rsquo;s sort of events in economics,</p>
<p>the transactions, there are states of agents that are kind of the atoms of economics. And then</p>
<p>transactions are kind of agents transact in some transact in some way, and that&rsquo;s an event. And</p>
<p>then the question is, how do you knit together sort of economic space from that? What is there</p>
<p>in economic space? Well, all these transactions, there&rsquo;s a whole complicated collection of possible</p>
<p>transactions. But one thing that&rsquo;s true about economics is we tend to have the notion of a</p>
<p>definite value for things. We could imagine that, you know, you buy a cookie from somebody, and</p>
<p>they want to get a movie ticket. And there is some way that AI bots could make some path</p>
<p>from the cookie to the movie ticket by all these different intermediate transactions. But in fact,</p>
<p>we have an approximation to that, which is we say they each have a dollar value. And we have this</p>
<p>kind of numeraire concept of there&rsquo;s just a way of kind of taking this whole complicated space of</p>
<p>transactions and parsing it in something which is a kind of a simplified thing that is kind of like</p>
<p>our parsing of physical space. And so my guess is that the yet again, I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy that all</p>
<p>these things are so connected. This is another multi computation story. Another story of where</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is that the economic consciousness, the economic observer is not going to deal with</p>
<p>all of those are different microscopic transactions. They&rsquo;re just going to parse the</p>
<p>whole thing by saying, there&rsquo;s this value, it&rsquo;s a number. And that&rsquo;s their understanding of their</p>
<p>summary of this economic network. And there will be all kinds of things like there are all kinds of</p>
<p>arbitrage opportunities, which are kind of like the quantum effects in this whole thing. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in places where there&rsquo;s sort of different paths that can be followed and so on. So the question</p>
<p>is, can one make a sort of global theory of economics? And then my test case is again,</p>
<p>what is time dilation in economics? And I know if you imagine a very agricultural economics where</p>
<p>people are growing lettuces and fields and things like this, and you ask questions about, well,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re transporting lettuces to different places, what is the value of the lettuces after</p>
<p>you have to transport them versus if you&rsquo;re just sitting in one place and selling them,</p>
<p>you can kind of get a little bit of an analogy there. But I think there&rsquo;s a better and more</p>
<p>complete analogy. And that&rsquo;s the question of, is there a theory like general relativity that is a</p>
<p>global theory of economics? And is it about something we care about? It could be that there</p>
<p>is a global theory, but it&rsquo;s about a feature of economic reality that isn&rsquo;t important to us.</p>
<p>Now, another part of the story is, can one use those ideas to make essentially a distributed</p>
<p>blockchain, a distributed generalization of blockchain, kind of the quantum analog of money,</p>
<p>so to speak, where you have, for example, you can have uncertainty relations where you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>you know, well, if I insist on knowing my bank account right now, there&rsquo;ll be some uncertainty.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m prepared to wait a while, then it&rsquo;ll be much more certain. And so there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>is there a way of using and so we&rsquo;ve made a bunch of prototypes of this, which I&rsquo;m not yet happy</p>
<p>with. But what I realized is, to really understand these prototypes, I actually have to have a</p>
<p>foundational theory of economics. And so that&rsquo;s kind of a, you know, it may be that we could</p>
<p>deploy one of these prototypes as a practical system. But I think it&rsquo;s really going to be much</p>
<p>better if we actually have an understanding of how this plugs into kind of the economics.</p>
<p>And that means like a fundamental theory of transactions between</p>
<p>entities. That&rsquo;s what you mean by economics.</p>
<p>Yes, I think so. But I mean, you know, how there emerge sort of laws of economics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know. And I&rsquo;ve been asking friends of mine who are economists and things,</p>
<p>what is economics? You know, is it an axiomatic theory? Is it a theory</p>
<p>that is kind of a qualitative description theory? Is it, you know, what kind of a theory is it? Is</p>
<p>it a theory, you know, what kind of thinking? It&rsquo;s like in biology, in evolutionary biology,</p>
<p>for example, there&rsquo;s a certain pattern of thinking that goes on in evolutionary biology where</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a, you know, a good evolutionary biologist, somebody says, that creature has a</p>
<p>weird horn. And they&rsquo;ll say, well, that&rsquo;s because this and this and this and the selection of this</p>
<p>kind and that kind. And that&rsquo;s the story. And it&rsquo;s not a mathematical story. It&rsquo;s a story of</p>
<p>a different type of thinking about these things. By the way, evolutionary biology is yet another</p>
<p>place where it looks like this multi computational idea can be applied. And that&rsquo;s where maybe</p>
<p>speciation is related to things like event horizons. And there&rsquo;s a whole other kind of</p>
<p>world of that. But it seems like this kind of model can be applicable to so many aspects,</p>
<p>like the different levels of understanding of our reality. So it could be the biology,</p>
<p>the chemistry, at the physics level, the economics. And you could potentially, the thing is, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, sure, at all these levels, it might rhyme. It might make sense as a model. The question is,</p>
<p>can you make useful predictions as one of these levels? That&rsquo;s right. And that&rsquo;s really a question</p>
<p>of, you know, it&rsquo;s a weird situation because the situation where the model probably has definite</p>
<p>consequences. The question is, are they consequences we care about? Yeah. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some, you know, and so in the case of, in the economic case, the, where, so, you know,</p>
<p>one thing is this idea of using kind of physics like notions to construct a kind of distributed</p>
<p>analog of blockchain. Okay. The much more pragmatic thing is a different direction.</p>
<p>And it has to do with this computational language that we built to describe the world</p>
<p>that knows about, you know, different kinds of cookies and knows about different cities and</p>
<p>knows about how to compute all these kinds of things. One of the things that is of interest is</p>
<p>if you want to run the world, you need, you know, with contracts and laws and rules and so on,</p>
<p>there are rules at a human level and there are kind of things like, and so this gets one into</p>
<p>the idea of computational contracts. You know, right now when we write a contract, it&rsquo;s a piece</p>
<p>of legalese. It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s just written in English and it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s automatically</p>
<p>analyzable, executable, whatever else. It&rsquo;s just English. You know, back in Gottfried Leibniz,</p>
<p>back in, you know, 1680 or whatever was like, I&rsquo;m going to, you know, figure out how to use logic</p>
<p>to decide legal cases and so on. And he had kind of this idea of let&rsquo;s make a computational language</p>
<p>for the human law. Forget about modeling nature, forgot about natural laws. What about human law?</p>
<p>Can we make kind of a computational representation of that? Well, I think finally we&rsquo;re close to</p>
<p>being able to do that. And one of the projects that I hope to get to as soon as there&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>bit of slowing down of some of this Cambrian explosion that&rsquo;s happening is a project I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been meaning to really do for a long time, which is what I&rsquo;m calling a symbolic discourse language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just finishing the job of being able to represent everything like the conversation we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having in computational terms. And one of the use cases for that is computational contracts.</p>
<p>Another use case is something like the constitution that says what the AIs, what we want the AIs to do.</p>
<p>So, but this is useful. So you&rsquo;re saying, so these are like, you&rsquo;re saying computational contracts,</p>
<p>but smart contracts. This is what&rsquo;s in the domain of cryptocurrency is known as smart contracts.</p>
<p>And so the language you&rsquo;ve developed, this symbolic or seek to further develop symbolic discourse</p>
<p>language enables you to write a contract and write a contract that richly represents</p>
<p>some aspect of the world. So, I mean, smart contracts tend to be right now mostly about</p>
<p>things happening on the blockchain. And sometimes they have oracles. And in fact, our Wolfman Alpha</p>
<p>API is the main thing people use to get information about the real world, so to speak,</p>
<p>within smart contracts. So Wolfram Alpha, as it stands, is a really good oracle for</p>
<p>whoever wants to use it. That&rsquo;s perhaps where the relationship with Cardano is.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s how we started getting involved with blockchains. As we realized,</p>
<p>people were using Wolfram Alpha as the oracle for smart contracts, so to speak. And so that</p>
<p>got us interested in blockchains in general. And what was ended up happening is Wolfram Language</p>
<p>is, with its symbolic representation of things, is really very good at representing things like</p>
<p>blockchains. And so I think we now have, and we don&rsquo;t really know all the comparisons, but we now</p>
<p>have a really nice environment within Wolfram Language for dealing with the sort of, for</p>
<p>representing what happens in blockchains, for analyzing what happens in blockchains.</p>
<p>We have a whole effort in blockchain analytics. And we&rsquo;ve sort of published some samples of how</p>
<p>that works. But it&rsquo;s because our technology stack, Wolfram Language and Mathematica,</p>
<p>are very widely used in the quant finance world. There&rsquo;s a sort of immediate coevolution there of</p>
<p>the quant finance kind of thing and blockchain analytics. So it&rsquo;s kind of the representation</p>
<p>of blockchain in computational language. Then ultimately, it&rsquo;s kind of like, how do you run</p>
<p>the world with code? That is, how do you write sort of all these things which are right now,</p>
<p>regulations and laws and contracts and things in computational language? And kind of the ultimate</p>
<p>vision is that sort of something happens in the world, and then there&rsquo;s this giant domino effect</p>
<p>of all these computational contracts that trigger based on the thing that happened. And there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole story to that. And of course, I like to always pay attention to the latest things that</p>
<p>are going on. And I really, I kind of like blockchain because it&rsquo;s another rethinking</p>
<p>of kind of computation. It&rsquo;s kind of like cloud computing was a little bit of that, of sort of</p>
<p>persistent kind of computational resources and so on. And this multi computation is a big</p>
<p>rethinking of kind of what it means to compute. Blockchain is another bit of rethinking of what</p>
<p>it means to compute. The idea that you lodge kind of these autonomous lumps of computation</p>
<p>out there in the blockchain world. And one of the things that just sort of for fun,</p>
<p>so to speak, is we&rsquo;ve been doing a bit of stuff with NFTs, and we just did some NFTs on Cardano,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be doing some more. And we did some cellular automaton NFTs on Cardano,</p>
<p>which people seem to like quite a bit. And one of the things I&rsquo;ve realized about NFTs</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s kind of this notion, and we&rsquo;re really working on this, I like recording stuff.</p>
<p>You know, one of the things that&rsquo;s come out of kind of my science, I suppose, is this history</p>
<p>matters type story of, you know, it&rsquo;s not just the current state, it&rsquo;s the history that matters.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve kind of, I don&rsquo;t think this is actually realizing, maybe it&rsquo;s not coincidental that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sort of the human who&rsquo;s recorded more about themselves than anybody else. And then I end up</p>
<p>with these science results that say history matters, which was not those things. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think those were connected, but they&rsquo;re at least correlated, yes. Yeah, right. So, you know,</p>
<p>this question about sort of recording what has happened and having sort of a permanent record</p>
<p>of things, one of the things that&rsquo;s kind of interesting there is, you know, you put up a</p>
<p>website and it&rsquo;s got a bunch of stuff on it, but you know, you have to keep paying the hosting</p>
<p>fees or the thing&rsquo;s going to go away. But one of the things about blockchain is quite interesting</p>
<p>is if you put something on a blockchain and you pay, you know, your commission to get that thing,</p>
<p>you know, put on, you know, mine, put on the blockchain, then in a sense, everybody who comes</p>
<p>after you is, you know, they are motivated to keep your thing alive because that&rsquo;s what keeps</p>
<p>the consistency of the blockchain. So in a sense with sort of the NFT world, it&rsquo;s kind of like if</p>
<p>you want to have something permanent, well, at least for the life of the blockchain, but even if</p>
<p>the blockchain goes out of circulation, so to speak, there&rsquo;s going to be enough value in that</p>
<p>whole collection of transactions that people are going to archive the thing. But that means that,</p>
<p>you know, pay once and you&rsquo;re kind of, you&rsquo;re lodged in the blockchain forever. And so we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been kind of playing around with sort of a hobby thing of mine of thinking about sort of the NFTs</p>
<p>and how you and sort of the consumer idea of kind of the it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the anti, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the opposite of the Snapchat view of the world. There&rsquo;s a permanence to it that&rsquo;s heavily</p>
<p>incentivized and thereby you can have a permanence of history. Right. And that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>the now, you know, so that&rsquo;s so that&rsquo;s one of the things we&rsquo;ve been doing with Cardano. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of fun. I think that I mean, this whole question about, you know, you mentioned automated</p>
<p>theorem proving and blockchains and so on. And as I&rsquo;ve thought about this kind of physics inspired</p>
<p>distributed blockchain, obviously, there, the sort of the proof that it works, that there are no</p>
<p>double spends, there&rsquo;s no whatever else, that proof becomes a very formal kind of almost a</p>
<p>matter of physics, so to speak. And, you know, it&rsquo;s been it&rsquo;s been an interesting thing for the</p>
<p>for the practical blockchains to do kind of actual automated theorem proving. And I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>anybody&rsquo;s really managed it in an interesting case yet. It&rsquo;s a thing that people, you know,</p>
<p>aspire to. But I think it&rsquo;s a challenging thing because basically, the point is one of the one</p>
<p>of the things about proving correctness of something as well. You know, people say I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got this program and I&rsquo;m going to prove it&rsquo;s correct. It&rsquo;s like, what does that mean? You</p>
<p>have to say what correct means. I mean, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of like then you have to have another</p>
<p>language. And people are very confused back in past decades of, you know, oh, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>prove the correctness by representing the program in another language, which we also don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s correct. And, you know, often by correctness, we just mean it can&rsquo;t crash or it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t scribble on memory. But but the thing is that there&rsquo;s this complicated trade off,</p>
<p>because as soon as there&rsquo;s as soon as you&rsquo;re really using computation, you have computational</p>
<p>irreducibility, you have undecidability. If you want to use computation seriously,</p>
<p>you have to kind of let go of the idea that you&rsquo;re going to be able to box it in and say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have just this happen and not anything else. I mean, this is a this is an old</p>
<p>fact. I mean, G√∂del&rsquo;s theorem tries to say, you know, piano arithmetic, the axioms of arithmetic,</p>
<p>can you box in the integers and say these axioms give just the integers and nothing about the</p>
<p>integers. G√∂del&rsquo;s theorem showed that wasn&rsquo;t the case. You can have all these wild, weird things</p>
<p>that are obey the piano axioms, but aren&rsquo;t integers. And there&rsquo;s this kind of infinite</p>
<p>hierarchy of additional axioms you would have to add. And it&rsquo;s kind of the same thing. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to, you know, if you want to say, I want to know what happens, you&rsquo;re boxing yourself in and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a limit to what can happen, so to speak. So it&rsquo;s a complicated trade off. And it&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>trade off for AI, so to speak. It&rsquo;s kind of like, do you want to let computation actually do what</p>
<p>it can do? Or do you want to say, no, it&rsquo;s very, very boxed in to the point where we can understand</p>
<p>every step. And that&rsquo;s kind of a thing that becomes difficult to do. But that&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>in general, I would say one of the things that&rsquo;s kind of complicated in my sort of life and the</p>
<p>whole sort of story of computational language and all this technology and science and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, I kind of in the flow of one&rsquo;s life, it&rsquo;s sort of interesting to see how these things play</p>
<p>out because I&rsquo;ve kind of concluded that I&rsquo;m in the business of making kind of artifacts from the</p>
<p>future, which means, you know, there are things that I&rsquo;ve done, I don&rsquo;t know, this physics project,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether anybody would have gotten to it for 50 years. You know, the fact that</p>
<p>Mathematica is a third of a century old, and I know that a bunch of the core ideas are not</p>
<p>well absorbed. I mean, that is people finally got this idea that I thought was a triviality</p>
<p>of notebooks, that was 25 years. And, you know, some of these core ideas about symbolic computation</p>
<p>and so on are not absorbed. I mean, people use them every day in Wolfram language and, you know,</p>
<p>do all kinds of cool things with them. But if you say, what is the fundamental intellectual point</p>
<p>here? It&rsquo;s not well absorbed. And it&rsquo;s something where you kind of realize that you&rsquo;re sort of</p>
<p>building things. And I kind of made this thing about, you know, we&rsquo;re building artifacts from</p>
<p>the future, so to speak. And I mentioned that we have a conference coming up actually in a couple</p>
<p>of weeks, our annual technology conference, where we talk about all the things we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And, you know, so I was talking about it last year, about, you know, we&rsquo;re making artifacts</p>
<p>from the future. And I was kind of like, I had some version of that, that was kind of a dark</p>
<p>and frustrated thing of like, you know, I&rsquo;m building things which nobody&rsquo;s going to care</p>
<p>about until long after I&rsquo;m dead, so to speak. But then I realized, you know, people were sort of</p>
<p>telling me afterwards, you know, that&rsquo;s exactly how, you know, we&rsquo;re using Wolfram language in</p>
<p>some particular setting and, you know, some computational X field or some organization or</p>
<p>whatever. And it&rsquo;s like, people are saying, oh, you know, what did you manage to do? You know,</p>
<p>well, we know that in principle, it will be possible to do that. But we didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>was possible now. And it&rsquo;s kind of like, that&rsquo;s sort of the business we&rsquo;re in. And in a sense,</p>
<p>with some of these ideas in science, you know, I feel a little bit the same way that there are</p>
<p>some of these things where, you know, some things like, for example, this whole idea, well, so to</p>
<p>relate to another sort of piece of history and the future, one of, you know, I mentioned at the</p>
<p>beginning kind of complexity as this thing that I was interested in back 40 years ago and so on.</p>
<p>Where does complexity come from? Well, I think we kind of nailed that. The answer is in the</p>
<p>computational universe, even simple programs make it. And that&rsquo;s kind of the secret that nature has</p>
<p>that allows you to make it. So that&rsquo;s that part. But the bigger picture there was this idea of</p>
<p>this kind of computational paradigm, the idea that you could go beyond mathematical equations,</p>
<p>which have been sort of the primary modeling medium for 300 years. And so it was like, look,</p>
<p>it is inexorably the case that people will use programs rather than just equations. And, you</p>
<p>know, I was saying that in the 1980s and people were, you know, I published my big book, New Kind</p>
<p>of Science, that&rsquo;ll be 20 years ago next year. So in 2002, and people were saying, oh, no,</p>
<p>this can&rsquo;t possibly be true. You know, we know for 300 years we&rsquo;ve been doing all this stuff.</p>
<p>Right. To be fair, I now realize I&rsquo;m a little bit more analysis of what people actually</p>
<p>said in pretty much every field other than physics. People said, oh, these are new models.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty interesting. In physics, people were like, we&rsquo;ve got our physics models. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very happy with them. Yeah, in physics, there&rsquo;s more resistance because of the attachment and</p>
<p>the power of the equations. The idea that programs might be the right way to approach</p>
<p>this field. Was there some resistance? And like you&rsquo;re saying, it takes time. For somebody who</p>
<p>likes the idea of time dilation and all these applications, I thought you would understand this.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. But, you know, and computational irreducibility. Yes, exactly. But I mean,</p>
<p>it is really interesting that just 20 years, a span of 20 years, it&rsquo;s gone from, you know,</p>
<p>pitchforks and horror to, yeah, we get it. And, you know, it&rsquo;s helped that we&rsquo;ve, you know, in our</p>
<p>current effort in fundamental physics, we&rsquo;ve gotten a lot further and we&rsquo;ve managed to</p>
<p>put a lot of puzzle pieces together that make sense. But the thing that I&rsquo;ve been thinking</p>
<p>about recently is this field of complexity. So I&rsquo;ve kind of was a sort of a field builder.</p>
<p>Back in the 1980s, I was kind of like, okay, you know, can we, you know, I&rsquo;d understood this point</p>
<p>that there was this sort of fundamental phenomenon of complexity that showed up in lots of places.</p>
<p>And I was like, this is an interesting sort of field of science. And I was recently was reminded,</p>
<p>I was at this, the very first sort of get together of what became the Santa Fe Institute. And I was</p>
<p>like, in fact, there&rsquo;s even an audio recording of me sort of saying, people have been talking about,</p>
<p>oh, what should this, you know, outfit do? And I was saying, well, there is this thing that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been thinking about. It&rsquo;s this kind of idea of complexity. And it&rsquo;s kind of like, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what that ended up. And you planted the seed of complexity at Santa Fe. That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful vision. But I mean, so that, but what&rsquo;s happened then is this idea of complexity</p>
<p>and, you know, and I started the first research center at University of Illinois for doing that</p>
<p>in the first journal, complex systems and so on. And it&rsquo;s kind of an interesting thing in my life,</p>
<p>at least that it&rsquo;s kind of like you plant the seed, you have this idea. It&rsquo;s a kind of a science</p>
<p>idea. You have this idea of sort of focusing on the phenomenon of complexity. The deeper idea was</p>
<p>this computational paradigm. But the nominal idea is this kind of idea of complexity. Okay. Then you</p>
<p>roll time forward 30 years or whatever, 35 years, whatever it is. And you say, what happened? Okay.</p>
<p>Well now there are a thousand complexity institutes around the world. I think more or less,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been trying to count them. And, you know, there are 40 complexity journals, I think.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of like what actually happened in this field, right? And I look at a lot of what</p>
<p>happened and I&rsquo;m like, you know, I have to admit to some eye rolling, so to speak, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like, like, what is, what&rsquo;s actually going on? Well, what people definitely got</p>
<p>was this idea of computational models. And then they got, but they thought one of the,</p>
<p>one of the kind of cognitive mistakes, I think is they say, we&rsquo;ve got a computational model</p>
<p>and it, and we&rsquo;re looking at a system that&rsquo;s complex and our computational model gives</p>
<p>complexity. By golly, that must mean it&rsquo;s right. And unfortunately, because complexity is a generic</p>
<p>phenomenon and computational irreducibility is a generic phenomenon that actually tells you nothing.</p>
<p>And so then the question is, well, what can you do? You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of things that have</p>
<p>been sort of done under this banner of complexity. And I think it&rsquo;s been very successful in providing</p>
<p>sort of an interdisciplinary way of connecting different fields together. Which is powerful</p>
<p>in itself. Right. I mean, that&rsquo;s a very useful. Biology and economics and physics. Right. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good organizing principle, but in the end, a lot of that is around this sort of computational</p>
<p>paradigm, computational modeling. That&rsquo;s the raw material that powers that kind of, that kind of</p>
<p>correspondence, I think. But the question is sort of, what is the, you know, I was just thinking</p>
<p>recently, you know, we&rsquo;ve been, I mean, the other we&rsquo;ve been, we&rsquo;ve been for years, people have</p>
<p>told me you should start some Wolfram Institute that does basic science. You know, all I have</p>
<p>is a company that, that builds software and we, you know, we have a little piece that does basic</p>
<p>science as kind of a hobby. People are saying you should start this Wolfram Institute thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been, you know, cause I&rsquo;ve known about lots of institutes and I&rsquo;ve seen kind of their</p>
<p>flow of money and, and kind of, you know, what happens in different situations and so on. So I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been kind of reluctant, but, but I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve, I have realized that, you know, what we&rsquo;ve done with</p>
<p>our company over the last 35 years, you know, we built a very good machine for doing R and D and,</p>
<p>you know, innovating and creating things. And I just applied that machine to the physics project.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we did the physics project in a fairly short amount of time with a, you know,</p>
<p>a efficient machine with, you know, various people involved and so on. And so, you know,</p>
<p>it, it works for basic science and it&rsquo;s like, we can do more of this. And so now.</p>
<p>In biology and chemistry, so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s become an institute.</p>
<p>Yes. Well, it needs to become an institute.</p>
<p>An official institute.</p>
<p>Right. Right. But the, the thing that, so I was thinking about, okay, so what do we do with</p>
<p>complexity? You know, what, what, there are all these people who&rsquo;ve, you know, what, what should</p>
<p>happen to that field? And what I realized is there&rsquo;s kind of this area of foundations of</p>
<p>complexity. That&rsquo;s about these questions about simple programs, what they do that&rsquo;s far away</p>
<p>from a bunch of the detailed applications that people, it&rsquo;s not far away. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the under, you know, the, the bedrock underneath those applications. And so I realized</p>
<p>recently, this is my recent kind of little innovation of a sort, a post that I&rsquo;ll do very</p>
<p>soon about kind of, you know, the foundations of complexity. What really are they? I think</p>
<p>there are really two ideas, two conceptual ideas that I hadn&rsquo;t really enunciated, I think before.</p>
<p>One is what I call meta modeling. The other is ruleology. So what is meta modeling? So</p>
<p>meta modeling is you&rsquo;ve got this complicated model and it&rsquo;s a model of, you know, hedgehogs</p>
<p>interacting with this, interacting with that. And the question is what&rsquo;s really underneath that?</p>
<p>What is it? You know, is it a Turing machine? Is it a cellular automaton? You know,</p>
<p>what is the underlying stuff underneath that model? And so there&rsquo;s this kind of meta science</p>
<p>question of given these models, what is the core model? And I realized, I mean, to me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of an obvious question, but then I realized I&rsquo;ve been doing language design for 40</p>
<p>years and language design is exactly that question. You know, underneath all of this</p>
<p>detailed stuff people do, what are the underlying primitives? And that&rsquo;s a question people haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tended to ask about models. They say, well, we&rsquo;ve got this nice model for this and that and the</p>
<p>other, what&rsquo;s really underneath it? And what, you know, because once you have the thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>underneath it, well, for example, this multi computation idea is an ultimate meta modeling</p>
<p>idea because it&rsquo;s saying underneath all these fields is one kind of paradigmatic structure.</p>
<p>And, you know, you can imagine the same kind of thing in much more sort of much sort of shallower</p>
<p>levels in different kinds of modeling. So the first activity is this kind of meta modeling,</p>
<p>the kind of the models about models, so to speak. You know, what is the, what&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>drilling down into models? That&rsquo;s one thing. The other thing is this thing that I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to call ruleology, which is kind of the, okay, you&rsquo;ve got these simple rules. You&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>cellular automata, you&rsquo;ve got turing machines, you&rsquo;ve got substitution systems, you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>register machines, you&rsquo;ve got all these different things. What do they actually do in the wild? And</p>
<p>this is an area that I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time, you know, working on. It&rsquo;s a lot of stuff in my new</p>
<p>kind of science book is about this. You know, this new book I wrote about combinators is full of</p>
<p>stuff like this. And this journal Complex Systems has lots of papers about these kinds of things.</p>
<p>But there isn&rsquo;t really a home for people who do ruleology or what I&rsquo;m now&hellip;</p>
<p>As you call the basic science of rules.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Right. So it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;ve got some, what is it? Is it mathematics? No,</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t really like mathematics. In fact, from my now understanding of metamathematics,</p>
<p>I understand that it&rsquo;s the molecular dynamics level. It&rsquo;s not the level that mathematicians</p>
<p>have traditionally cared about. It&rsquo;s not computer science because computer science is about writing</p>
<p>programs that do things, you know, that were for a purpose, not programs in the wild, so to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not physics. It doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with, you know, maybe underneath some physics,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not physics as such. So it just hasn&rsquo;t had a home. And if you look at, you know,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s great about it is it&rsquo;s a surviving field, so to speak. It&rsquo;s something where,</p>
<p>you know, one of the things I find sort of inspiring about mathematics, for example,</p>
<p>is you look at mathematics that was done, you know, in ancient Greece, ancient, you know, Babylon,</p>
<p>Egypt, and so on. It&rsquo;s still here today. You know, you find an icosahedron that somebody made</p>
<p>in ancient Egypt. You look at it. Oh, that&rsquo;s a very modern thing. It&rsquo;s an icosahedron. You know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a timeless kind of activity. And this idea of studying simple rules and what they do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a timeless activity. And I can see that over the last 40 years or so as, you know,</p>
<p>even with cellular automata, it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, you can sort of catalog what are the</p>
<p>different cellular automata used for and, you know, like the simplest rules like one, you might</p>
<p>even know this one, Rule 184. Rule 184 is a minimal model for road traffic flow. And, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also a minimal model for various other things. But it&rsquo;s kind of fun that you can literally say,</p>
<p>you know, Rule 90 is a minimal model for this and this and this. Rule 4 is a minimal model for this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of remarkable that you can just by in this raw level of this kind of study of rules,</p>
<p>they then branch, they&rsquo;re the raw material that you can use to make models of different things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very pure basic science, but it&rsquo;s one that, you know, people have explored it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been kind of a little bit in the wilderness. And I think, you know, one of the</p>
<p>things that I would like to do finally is, you know, I always thought that sort of this notion</p>
<p>of pure NKS, pure NKS being the acronym for my book, New Kind of Science, was something that</p>
<p>people should be doing. And, you know, we tried to figure out what&rsquo;s the right institutional</p>
<p>structure to do this stuff. You know, we dealt with a bunch of universities. Oh, you know,</p>
<p>can we do this here? Well, what department would be in it? Well, it isn&rsquo;t in a department. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>its own new kind of thing. That&rsquo;s why the book was called The New Kind of Science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the, because that&rsquo;s an increasingly good description of what it is, so to speak.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually, we were thinking about kind of the ruleological society because we&rsquo;re realizing</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s very interesting. I mean, I&rsquo;ve never really done</p>
<p>something like this before because there&rsquo;s this whole group of researchers who are,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been doing things that are really, in some cases, very elegant, very surviving, very solid,</p>
<p>you know, here&rsquo;s this thing that happens in this very abstract system. But it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, what is that part of, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t have a home. And I think that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>I, you know, I kind of fault myself for not having been more, you know, when complexity</p>
<p>was developing in the 80s, I didn&rsquo;t understand the danger of applications. That is, it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>cool that you can apply this to economics and you can apply it to evolutionary biology and this and</p>
<p>that and the other. But what happens with applications is everything gets sucked into</p>
<p>the applications. And the pure stuff, it&rsquo;s like the pure mathematics, there isn&rsquo;t any pure</p>
<p>mathematics, so to speak. It&rsquo;s all just applications of mathematics. And I failed to kind of make sure</p>
<p>that this kind of pure area was kind of maintained and developed. And I think now, you know, one of</p>
<p>the things I want to try to do and, you know, it&rsquo;s a funny thing because I&rsquo;m used to, look,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a tech CEO for more than half my life now. So, you know, this is what I know how to do.</p>
<p>And, you know, I can make stuff happen and get projects to happen, even as it turns out,</p>
<p>basic science projects in that kind of setting and how that translates into kind of, you know,</p>
<p>there are a lot of people working on, for example, our physics project sort of distributed through</p>
<p>the academic world and that&rsquo;s working just great. But the question is, you know, can we have a sort</p>
<p>of accelerator mechanism that makes use of kind of what we&rsquo;ve learned in sort of R&amp;D innovation?</p>
<p>And, you know, but on the other hand, it&rsquo;s a funny thing because, you know, in a company,</p>
<p>in the end, the thing is, you know, it&rsquo;s a company, it makes products, it sells things,</p>
<p>sells things to people. And, you know, when you&rsquo;re doing basic research, one of the challenges is</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t that same kind of sort of mechanism. And so it&rsquo;s, you know, how do you drive the thing</p>
<p>in a kind of, in a led kind of way so that it really can make forward progress rather than,</p>
<p>you know, what can often happen in, you know, in academic settings where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, there are all these flowers blooming, but it&rsquo;s not clear that, you know, that it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>You have to have a central mission and a drive, just like you do with a company that&rsquo;s delivering</p>
<p>a big overarching product. And that&rsquo;s&hellip; But the challenge is, you know, when you have</p>
<p>the economics of the world are such that, you know, when you&rsquo;re delivering a product and people</p>
<p>say, wow, that&rsquo;s useful, we&rsquo;ll buy it. And then that kind of feeds back and, okay, then you can</p>
<p>pay the people who build it to eat, you know, so they can eat and so on. And with basic science,</p>
<p>the payoff is very much less visible. And, you know, with this physics project, as I say,</p>
<p>the big surprise has been that, I mean, you know, for example, well, the big surprise with</p>
<p>the physics project is that it looks like it has near term applications. And I was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing this is 200 years away. I was kind of using the analogy of, you know, Newton</p>
<p>starting a satellite launch company, which would have been kind of wrong time.</p>
<p>And, you know, but it turns out that&rsquo;s not the case, but we can&rsquo;t guarantee that. And if you say</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re signing up to do basic research, basic rheology, let&rsquo;s say, and, you know, and we can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know the horizon, you know, it&rsquo;s an unknown horizon. It&rsquo;s kind of like an undecidable</p>
<p>kind of proposition of when is this proof going to end, so to speak? When is it going to be</p>
<p>something that gets applied? Well, I hope this becomes a vibrant new field of rheology. I love</p>
<p>it. Like I told you many, many times, it&rsquo;s one of the most amazing ideas that has been brought to</p>
<p>this world. So I hope you get a bunch of people to explore this world. Thank you once again for</p>
<p>spending your really valuable time with me today. Fun stuff. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this</p>
<p>conversation with Stephen Wolfram. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the</p>
<p>description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Richard Feynman. Nature uses only the</p>
<p>longest threads to weave her patterns, so each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization</p>
<p>of the entire tapestry. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
