    <p>The lesson I would want everyone to take from the story of the First World War is that</p>
<p>human life is not cheap. That all of the warring powers thought that just by throwing</p>
<p>more men and more material at the front, they would solve their political problems with military</p>
<p>force. And at the end of the day in 1918, one side did win that, but it didn&rsquo;t actually solve</p>
<p>any of those political problems. You said that World War I gave birth to the surveillance state</p>
<p>in the US. Can you explain? The following is a conversation with Christopher Capozzola,</p>
<p>a historian at MIT specializing in the history of politics and war in modern American history,</p>
<p>especially about the role of World War I in defining the trajectory of the United States</p>
<p>and our human civilization in the 20th and 21st centuries. This is the Lux Friedman podcast. To</p>
<p>support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Christopher Capozzola. Let&rsquo;s start with a big and difficult question. How did World War I</p>
<p>start? On the one hand, World War I started because of a series of events in the summer of 1914,</p>
<p>and that brought the major powers of Europe into conflict with one another. But I actually think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more useful to say that World War I started at least a generation earlier when rising powers,</p>
<p>particularly Germany, started devoting more and more of their resources toward military affairs</p>
<p>and naval affairs. This sets off an arms race in Europe. It sets off a rivalry over the colonial</p>
<p>world and who will control the resources in Africa and Asia. And so by the time you get to the summer</p>
<p>of 1914, and in a lot of ways I say the war has already begun, and this is just the match that</p>
<p>lights the flame. So the capacity for war was brewing within like the leaders and within the</p>
<p>populace. They started accepting sort of slowly through the culture propagated this idea that</p>
<p>we can go to war, it&rsquo;s a good idea to go to war, it&rsquo;s a good idea to expand and dominate others,</p>
<p>that kind of thing. Maybe not put in those clear terms, but just the sense that military action is</p>
<p>the way that nations operate at the global scale. Yes, yes and, right. So yes, there&rsquo;s a sense that</p>
<p>the military can be the solution to political conflict in Europe itself. And the and is that</p>
<p>war and military conflict are already happening, right? That there&rsquo;s war particularly in Africa,</p>
<p>in North Africa, in the Middle East, in the Balkans. Conflict is already underway and the</p>
<p>European powers haven&rsquo;t faced off against each other. They&rsquo;ve usually faced off against</p>
<p>an asymmetrical conflict against much less powerful states. But in some ways that war is</p>
<p>already underway. So do you think it was inevitable? Because World War One is brought up as a case</p>
<p>study where it seems like a few accidental leaders and a few accidental events or one accidental</p>
<p>event led to the war. And if you change that one little thing, it could have avoided the war. Your</p>
<p>sense is that the drums of war have been beating for quite a while and it would have happened</p>
<p>almost no matter what or very likely to have happened. Yes, historians never like to say things</p>
<p>are inevitable. And certainly, you know, there were people who could have chosen a different path</p>
<p>both in the short term and the long term. But fundamentally, there were irreconcilable conflicts</p>
<p>in the system of empires in the world in 1914. I can&rsquo;t see, you know, it didn&rsquo;t have to be this war</p>
<p>but it probably had to be a war. So there was the German Empire, the Austro Hungarian Empire,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s France and Great Britain, US. Could USP call that empire at that moment yet?</p>
<p>When do you graduate to empire status? Well, certainly after 1898 with the acquisition of</p>
<p>the former territories of the Spanish Empire, you know, the United States has formal colonial</p>
<p>possessions and it has sort of mindsets of rule and military acquisition that would define empire</p>
<p>in a kind of more informal sense. So you would say you would put the blame or the responsibility</p>
<p>of starting World War I into the hands of the German Empire and Kaiser Wilhelm II?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a really tough call to make. And, you know, deciding that is going to keep</p>
<p>historians in business for the next 200 years. I think there are people who would lay all of the</p>
<p>blame on the Germans, right? And, you know, who would point toward a generation of arms build up,</p>
<p>you know, alliances that Germany made and promises that they made to their allies in the Balkans,</p>
<p>to the Austro Hungarians. And so yes, there&rsquo;s an awful lot of responsibility there.</p>
<p>There has been a trend lately to say, no, it&rsquo;s no one&rsquo;s fault, right? That, you know,</p>
<p>that all of the various powers literally were sleepwalking into the war, right? They backed into</p>
<p>it inadvertently. I think that lets everyone a little too much off the hook, right? And so I</p>
<p>think in between is, you know, I would put the blame on the system of empires itself, on the</p>
<p>system. But in that system, the actor that sort of carries the most responsibility is definitely</p>
<p>Imperial Germany. So the leader of the Austro Hungarian Empire, Franz Joseph I, his nephews,</p>
<p>Archduke Franz Ferdinand, he was assassinated. And so that didn&rsquo;t have to lead to a war. And then</p>
<p>the leader of the German Empire, Kaiser Wilhelm II, pressured, sort of started talking trash</p>
<p>and boiling the water that ultimately resulted in the explosion, plus all the other players.</p>
<p>So what can you describe the dynamics of how that unrolled? Well, US, what&rsquo;s the role of US? What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the role of France? What&rsquo;s the role of Great Britain, Germany, and Austro Hungarian Empire?</p>
<p>Yeah, over the course of about four weeks, right, following the assassination of the Archduke</p>
<p>in Sarajevo, it sort of triggers a series of political conflicts and ultimately ultimatums,</p>
<p>sort of demanding sort of that one or other power sort of stand down in response to the demands of</p>
<p>either Britain, France, or in turn, Germany or Russia, at the same time that those alliances</p>
<p>kind of trigger automatic responses from the other side. And so it escalates. And once that</p>
<p>escalation is combined with the call up of military troops, then none of those powers wants</p>
<p>to be sort of the last one to kind of get ready for conflict. So even throughout it, they think</p>
<p>they are getting ready in a defensive maneuver. And if they think if there is conflict, well,</p>
<p>it might be a skirmish, it might be, you know, sort of a standoff. It could be solved with</p>
<p>diplomacy later, because diplomacy is failing now. That turns out not to be the case. Diplomacy fails,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a skirmish, it becomes a massive war. And the Americans are watching all of this from</p>
<p>the sidelines. They have very little influence over what happens that summer.</p>
<p>How does it go from a skirmish between a few nations to a global war? Is there a place where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a phase transition? Yeah, I think the phase transition is in over the course of the fall of</p>
<ol start="1914">
<li>When the Germans make an initial sort of bold move into France, in many ways, they&rsquo;re</li>
</ol>
<p>fighting the last war, the Franco Prussian War of 1870. And they really do sort of, you know, kind</p>
<p>of want to have a quick sort of lightning strike in some ways against France to kind of bring the war</p>
<p>to a speedy conclusion. France turns out to be able to fight back more effectively than the Germans</p>
<p>expected. And then the battle lines sort of harden. And then behind that, the French and the Germans,</p>
<p>as well as the British on the side of the French, start digging in, literally, and digging trenches.</p>
<p>Trenches that at first are three feet deep to avoid shelling from artillery, then become six</p>
<p>feet, 10 feet deep, two miles wide, that include telegraph wires, that include whole hospitals in</p>
<p>the back. And then at that point, the front is locked in place. And the only way to break that</p>
<p>is sort of basically dialing the war up to 11, right? Sort of massive numbers of troops, massive</p>
<p>efforts, none of which work, right? And so the war is stuck in this. But that&rsquo;s the phase transition</p>
<p>right there. What were the machines of war in that case? You mentioned trenches. What were the guns</p>
<p>used? What was the size of guns? What are we talking about? What did Germany start accumulating</p>
<p>that led up to this war? One of the things that we see immediately is the industrial revolution</p>
<p>of the previous 30 or 40 years brought to bear on warfare, right? And so you see sort of machine</p>
<p>guns. You see artillery. These are the key weapons of war on both sides, right? The vast majority of</p>
<p>battlefield casualties are from artillery shelling from one side to another, not sort of rifle or</p>
<p>even sort of machine gun kind of attacks. In some ways, the weapons of war are human beings, right?</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of them horde over the top in these sort of waves to kind of try to break through</p>
<p>the enemy lines. And it would work for a little while. But holding the territory that had been</p>
<p>gained often proved to be even more demanding than gaining it. And so often, each side would retreat</p>
<p>back into the trenches and wait for another day. And how did Russia, how did Britain,</p>
<p>how did France get pulled into the war? I suppose the France one is the easy one. But what is the</p>
<p>order of events here? How it becomes a global war? Yeah. So Britain, France, and Russia are at this</p>
<p>time and they&rsquo;re an alliance. And so the conflicts in the summer of 1914 that lead sort of to the</p>
<p>declarations of war happened sort of one after another in late August of 1914. And all three</p>
<p>powers essentially come in at the same time because they have promised to do so through a series of</p>
<p>alliances conducted secretly in the years before 1914 that committed them to defend one another.</p>
<p>Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire have their own sort of set of secret agreements</p>
<p>that also commit them to defend one another. And what this does is it sort of brings them all into</p>
<p>conflict at the exact same moment. They&rsquo;re also, for many of these countries, bringing not just</p>
<p>their national armies, but also their empires into the conflict. So Britain and France, of course,</p>
<p>have enormous sort of global empires. They begin mobilizing soldiers as well as raw materials.</p>
<p>Germany has less of an overseas empire. Russia and the Ottoman Empire, of course, have their own sort</p>
<p>of hinterland within the empire. And very soon, all of the warring powers are bringing the entire</p>
<p>world into the conflict. Did they have a sense of how deadly the war is? I mean, this is another</p>
<p>scale of death and destruction. At the beginning, no, but very quickly, the scale of the devastation</p>
<p>of these sort of massive over the top attacks on the trenches is apparent to the military officers</p>
<p>and it very quickly becomes apparent even at home. You know, there is, of course, censorship of the</p>
<p>battlefield and specific details don&rsquo;t reach people. But for civilians and in any of the</p>
<p>warring powers, they know fairly soon how destructive the war is. And to me, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always been a real sort of puzzle, right? That by the time the United States comes to decide whether</p>
<p>to join the war in 1917, they know exactly what they&rsquo;re getting into, right? They&rsquo;re not backing</p>
<p>into the war in the ways that the European powers did. You know, they&rsquo;ve seen the devastation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve seen photographs, they&rsquo;ve seen injured soldiers, and they make that choice anyway.</p>
<p>When you say they, do you mean the leaders of the people? Did</p>
<p>the death and destruction reach the minds of the American people by that time?</p>
<p>AOB Yes, absolutely. We don&rsquo;t in 1917 have the mass media that we have now, but there are images</p>
<p>in newspapers, there are newsreels that play at the movie theaters, and of course, some of it is</p>
<p>sanitized. But that combined with press accounts, often really quite descriptive press accounts,</p>
<p>gory accounts, reached anyone who cared to read them. Certainly, plenty of people didn&rsquo;t follow</p>
<p>the news, felt it was far away. But most Americans who cared about the news knew how devastating this</p>
<p>war was. LR Yeah, there&rsquo;s something that happens that I recently visited Ukraine for a few weeks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that happens with the human mind as you get away from the actual front where</p>
<p>the bullets are flying, like literally one kilometer away. You start to not feel the war.</p>
<p>AOB You&rsquo;ll hear an explosion, you&rsquo;ll see an explosion, you start to get assimilated to it,</p>
<p>or you start to get used to it. And then when you get as far away from currently what is Kiev,</p>
<p>you know the war&rsquo;s going on, everybody around you is fighting in that war, but it&rsquo;s still somehow</p>
<p>distant. And I think with the United States, with the ocean between, even if you have the stories</p>
<p>everywhere, it still is somehow distant, like the way a movie is. Like a movie or a video game,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somewhere else, even if your loved ones are going, or you are going to fight.</p>
<p>LR Yeah, that is absolutely the case. And in some ways, that&rsquo;s true even for the home fronts in</p>
<p>Europe, except for the areas where, in Belgium and France, where the war is right there in your</p>
<p>backyard. For other people, yeah, there&rsquo;s a distance. And soldiers, of course, feel this</p>
<p>very strongly. European soldiers, when they&rsquo;re able to go home on leave, often deeply resent</p>
<p>what they see as the luxury that civilians are living in during the war.</p>
<p>LR So how did US enter the war? Who was the president? What was the dynamics involved? And could it have stayed out?</p>
<p>LR To answer your last question first, yes. That the United States could have stayed out of the</p>
<p>First World War as a military power. The United States could not have ignored the war completely.</p>
<p>It shaped everything. It shaped trade. It shaped goods and services, agriculture, whether</p>
<p>there was a crop coming, whether there were immigrants coming across the Atlantic to work</p>
<p>in American factories. So the US can&rsquo;t ignore the war. But the US makes a choice in 1917 to enter</p>
<p>the war by declaring war on Germany and Austria. And in that sense, this is a war of choice,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kicked off by a series of events. So President Woodrow Wilson has been president</p>
<p>through this entire period of time. He has just run in the 1916 presidential election on a campaign</p>
<p>to keep the United States out of war. But then in early 1917, the Germans in some ways</p>
<p>sort of twist the Americans arms. The Germans sort of high command comes to understand that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re stuck. They&rsquo;re stuck in this trench warfare. They need a big breakthrough. Their one</p>
<p>big chance is to sort of break the blockade to push through that the British have imposed on them,</p>
<p>to break through against France. And so they do. And along with this, they start sinking ships on</p>
<p>the Atlantic, including American ships. The Germans know full well this will draw the United States</p>
<p>into war. But the Germans look at the United States at this moment, a relatively small army,</p>
<p>a relatively small Navy, a country that at least on paper is deeply divided about whether to join</p>
<p>the war. And so they say, let&rsquo;s do it. They&rsquo;re not going to get any American soldiers there in time.</p>
<p>It was a gamble, but I think probably their best chance. They took that gamble. They lost.</p>
<p>Right. In part, because French resistance was strong in part because Americans mobilized much</p>
<p>faster and in much greater numbers than the Germans thought they would. So the American</p>
<p>people were divided. The American people were absolutely divided about whether to enter this</p>
<p>war. Right. From 1914 to 1917, there is a searing debate across the political spectrum. It doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break down easily on party lines about whether it was in the US interest to do this, whether American</p>
<p>troops should be sent abroad, whether Americans would end up just being cannon fodder for the</p>
<p>European empires. Eventually, as American ships are sunk, first in the Lusitania in 1915, then in</p>
<p>much greater numbers in 1917, the tide starts to turn and Americans feel that our response is</p>
<p>necessary. And the actual declaration of war in Congress is pretty lopsided, but it&rsquo;s not unanimous</p>
<p>by any means. Lopsided towards entering the war. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s echoes of that in later wars where Congress seems to&hellip; Nobody wants to be the guy</p>
<p>that says no to war for some reason. Once you sense that in terms of, sorry, in terms of</p>
<p>politicians, because then you appear weak, but I wonder if that was always the case. So you make</p>
<p>the case that World War I is largely responsible for defining what it means to be an American</p>
<p>citizen. So in which way does it define the American citizen? When you think about citizenship,</p>
<p>what it means is two things. First of all, what are your rights and obligations? What</p>
<p>is the legal citizenship that you have as a citizen of the United States or any other state?</p>
<p>And the second is a more amorphous definition of what does it mean to belong, to be part of America,</p>
<p>to feel American, to love it or hate it or be willing to die for it. And both of those things</p>
<p>really are crystal clear in terms of their importance during the war. So both of those</p>
<p>things are on the table. Being a citizen who is a citizen who isn&rsquo;t matters. So people who had</p>
<p>never carried passports or anything before suddenly have to. But also what it means to</p>
<p>be an American, to feel like it, to be part of this project is also being defined and enforced</p>
<p>during World War I. So project is a funny way to put a global war. So can you tell the story,</p>
<p>perhaps that&rsquo;s a good example of it, of the James Montgomery Flagg&rsquo;s 1916 poster that reads,</p>
<p>I want you. A lot of people know this poster. I think in its original form, its memeified form,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. But we know this poster and we don&rsquo;t know where it came from. Or most Americans,</p>
<p>I think, me included, didn&rsquo;t know where it came from. And it actually comes from 1916.</p>
<p>Does this poster represent the birth of something new in America, which is a</p>
<p>commodification or, I don&rsquo;t know, that propaganda machine that says what it</p>
<p>means to be an American is somebody that fights for their country?</p>
<p>Yeah. So the image, it&rsquo;s in fact, I think one of the most recognizable images, not only in the</p>
<p>United States, but in the entire world. And you can bring it almost anywhere on Earth in 2022,</p>
<p>and people will know what it refers to. And so this is an image that circulated first as a magazine</p>
<p>cover, later as a recruitment poster, where the figure is Uncle Sam, sort of pointing at the</p>
<p>viewer with his finger, sort of pointing and saying, I want you. And the I want you is a</p>
<p>recruitment tool to join the US Army. And this image really kind of starts as a kind of, like I</p>
<p>said, a magazine cover in 1916 by the artist James Montgomery Flagg. It initially appears under the</p>
<p>heading, What are you doing for preparedness? Meaning to prepare in case war comes to the</p>
<p>United States. And at that point in 1916, we&rsquo;re still neutral. In 1917, it&rsquo;s turned into a US</p>
<p>Army recruiting poster. And then it reappears in World War Two, reappears generations after,</p>
<p>like you said, it&rsquo;s now gets remixed, memefied, it&rsquo;s all over the place. I think for me, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>turning point, it&rsquo;s a sort of window into American culture at a crucial moment in our history,</p>
<p>where the federal government is now embarking on a war overseas that&rsquo;s going to make enormous</p>
<p>demands on its citizens. And at the same time, where sort of technologies of mass production</p>
<p>and mass media, and what we would probably call propaganda, are being sort of mobilized for the</p>
<p>for the first time in this new kind of way. Well, in some sense, is it fair to say that</p>
<p>the Empire is born? The expanding Empire is born from the Noam Chomsky perspective kind of empire</p>
<p>that seeks to have military influence elsewhere in the world?</p>
<p>Yes, but I think as historians, we need to be at least as interested in what happens to the people</p>
<p>who are getting pointed to by Uncle Sam, right, rather than just the one, you know, whether he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pointing at us. And, you know, so, so yes, he&rsquo;s asking us to do that. But how do we respond?</p>
<p>And the people responded. So the people are ultimately the the machines of history, the</p>
<p>mechanisms of history. It&rsquo;s not Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam can only do so much if the people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>willing to step up. Absolutely. They and, you know, the American people responded for sure,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t build what Uncle Sam asked them to do in that poster, right? And I think that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, kind of a crucial aspect that, you know, there never would have been sort of global</p>
<p>U.S. power without the response that begins in World War One.</p>
<p>What was the Selective Service Act of 1917?</p>
<p>So one of the very first things that Uncle Sam wants you to do, right, is to register for</p>
<p>selective service for the draft, right? And the law is passed very soon after the U.S. enters the</p>
<p>war. It&rsquo;s sort of, you know, demanding that all men first between 21 and 30, then between 18 and</p>
<p>45, register for the draft, and they&rsquo;ll be selected by a government agency, by a volunteer</p>
<p>organization. It&rsquo;s a requirement to sign up. It is a legal requirement to register. Of course,</p>
<p>not everyone who registers is selected, but over the course of the war, 24 million men register,</p>
<p>almost 4 million serve in some fashion.</p>
<p>What was the response? What was the feeling amongst the American people to have to sign up</p>
<p>to the Selective Service Act? Have to register.</p>
<p>Yeah. This is a bigger turning point than we might think, right? In some ways, this is a tougher</p>
<p>demand of the American public than entering the war. It&rsquo;s one thing to declare war on Germany,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s another thing to go down to your local post office and fill out the forms that allow</p>
<p>your own government to send you there to fight. And this is especially important at a time when</p>
<p>the federal government doesn&rsquo;t really have any other way to find you unless you actually go</p>
<p>and register yourself, right? And so, you know, ordinary people are participating in the building</p>
<p>of this war machine, but at least a half a million of them don&rsquo;t, right? And simply never fill out</p>
<p>the forms, move from one town to another.</p>
<p>But you said 20 million did? 20 something?</p>
<p>Yeah. About 24 million register, at least 500,000.</p>
<p>Is it surprising to you that that many registered? Since the country was divided?</p>
<p>It is. And that&rsquo;s what I, you know, sort of tried to dig in to figure out how did you get 24 million</p>
<p>people to register for the draft? And it&rsquo;s certainly not coming from the top down, right? You</p>
<p>know, there may be a hundred sort of agents in what&rsquo;s now called the FBI. You know, it&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>not being enforced from Washington. It&rsquo;s being enforced in, you know, through the eyes of everyday</p>
<p>neighbors, you know, through community surveillance, all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>Oh, so there was like a pressure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>Interesting. So there was not a significant like antiwar movement as you would see maybe</p>
<p>later with Vietnam and things like this?</p>
<p>There was a significant movement before 1917, but it becomes very hard to keep up an organized</p>
<p>antiwar movement after that, particularly when the government starts shutting down protests.</p>
<p>So as the Selective Service Act of 1917 runs up against some of the freedoms, some of the rights</p>
<p>that are defined in our founding documents, what was that clash like? What was sacrificed? What</p>
<p>freedoms and rights were sacrificed in this process?</p>
<p>I mean, I think on some level, the fundamental right is liberty, right? That conscription sort</p>
<p>of demands, you know, sacrifice on the behalf of some notionally for the protection of all.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re against the war, you&rsquo;re forced to fight.</p>
<p>Yes. You know, and there were small provisions for conscientious objectors, solely those who</p>
<p>had religious objections to all war, right? Not political objections to this war. And so,</p>
<p>you know, several thousand were able to take those provisions. But even then, they faced</p>
<p>social sanction, they faced ridicule, some of them faced intimidation. So those liberty</p>
<p>interests, both individual freedom, religious freedom, you know, those are some of the first</p>
<p>things to go.</p>
<p>Right. So what about freedom of speech? What&rsquo;s the silencing of the press, of the voices</p>
<p>of the different people that were object?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. Right. And so very soon after the Selective Service Act is passed, then</p>
<p>you get the Espionage Act, which of course is back in the news in 2022.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Espionage Act?</p>
<p>The Espionage Act is a sort of omnibus bill. It contains about 10 or different provisions,</p>
<p>very few of which have to do with espionage. But one key provision basically makes it illegal</p>
<p>to say or do anything that would interfere with military recruitment, right? And that</p>
<p>provision is used to shut down radical publications, to shut down German language publications.</p>
<p>And, you know, this really has a chilling impact on speech during the war.</p>
<p>Could you put into words what it means to be an American citizen that is in part sparked</p>
<p>by World War I? What does that mean? Somebody that should be willing to sacrifice certain</p>
<p>freedoms to fight for their country? Somebody that&rsquo;s willing to fight to spread freedom</p>
<p>elsewhere in the world, spread the American ideals? Does that begin to tell the story</p>
<p>what it means to be an American?</p>
<p>I think what we see is a change, right? So citizenship during World War I now includes</p>
<p>the obligation to defend the country, right, to serve, and to, if asked, to die for it,</p>
<p>right? And we certainly see that. And I think we see the close linkage of military service</p>
<p>and US citizenship coming out of this time period. But, you know, when you start making</p>
<p>lots of demands on people to fulfill obligations, in turn, they&rsquo;re going to start demanding rights.</p>
<p>And we start to see, not necessarily during the war but after, more demands for free speech</p>
<p>protections, more demands for equality, for marginalized groups. And so, you know, obligations</p>
<p>and rights are sort of developing in a dynamic relationship.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s almost like an overreach of power sparked a sense like, oh crap, we can&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>centralized power to abuse, like to drag us into a war. We need to be able to. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the birth of that tension between the government and the people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rebirth of it. You know, of course, that tension is always there. But in its modern form,</p>
<p>I think it comes from this reintensification of it. So what about, you said that World War I gave</p>
<p>birth to the surveillance state in the US. Can you explain?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the Espionage Act, you know, sort of empowers federal organizations to watch other</p>
<p>Americans. They are particularly interested in anyone who is obstructing the draft, anyone who</p>
<p>is trying to kind of organize labor or strikes or radical movements, and anyone who might have</p>
<p>sympathy for Germany, which basically means, you know, all German Americans come under surveillance.</p>
<p>Initially, you know, this is very small scale. But soon, every government agency gets involved</p>
<p>from the Treasury Department Secret Service to the Post Office, which is sort of breeding mail,</p>
<p>to the Justice Department, which mobilizes 200,000 volunteers. You know, it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>significant enterprise. Much of it goes away after the war. But of all the things that go away,</p>
<p>this core of the surveillance state is the thing that persists most fully.</p>
<p>Is this also a place where government, the size of government starts to grow</p>
<p>in these different organizations, or maybe creates a momentum for growth of government?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s exponential growth, right? That, you know, that over the course of the war,</p>
<p>by almost any metric you use, right, the size of the federal budget, the number of federal</p>
<p>employees, the number of soldiers in the standing army, all of those things skyrocket during the</p>
<p>war. They go down after the war, but they never go down to what they were before.</p>
<p>And probably gave a momentum for growth.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Did World War I give birth to the military industrial complex in the United States? So,</p>
<p>war profiteering, expanding of the war machine in order to</p>
<p>financially benefit a lot of parties involved?</p>
<p>So, I guess I would maybe break that into two parts, right? That, on the one hand, yes,</p>
<p>there is war profiteering. There are investigations of it. In the years after the war,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a widespread concern that the profit motive had played too much of a part in the war,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s definitely the case. But I think when you try to think of this term military industrial</p>
<p>complex, it&rsquo;s best to think of it as, at what point does the one side lock in the other,</p>
<p>right? That military choices are shaped by industry objectives and vice versa. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that that was fully locked into place during World War I. I think that&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>Cold War phenomenon, when the United States is on this intense kind of footing for two</p>
<p>generations in a row.</p>
<p>So, industrial is really important there, there is companies. So, before then,</p>
<p>weapons of war were created, were funded directly by the government. Who was manufacturing the</p>
<p>weapons of war?</p>
<p>They were generally manufactured by private industry. There were, of course, arsenals,</p>
<p>sort of 19th century iterations where the government would produce its own weapons,</p>
<p>partly to make sure that they got what they wanted. But most of the weapons of war for all</p>
<p>of the European powers, and the United States, are produced by private industry.</p>
<p>So, why do you say that the military industrial complex didn&rsquo;t start then? What was the</p>
<p>important thing that happened in the Cold War?</p>
<p>I think one way to think about it is that the Cold War is a point at which it switches</p>
<p>from being a dial to a ratchet, right? So, during World War I, the relationship between</p>
<p>the military and industry dials up fast and high, and stays that way, and it dials back</p>
<p>down. Whereas during the Cold War, sort of the relationship between the two often looks</p>
<p>more like a ratchet.</p>
<p>Yeah, it becomes unstoppable.</p>
<p>It goes up again.</p>
<p>In the way that you start, I think, the way the military industrial complex is often</p>
<p>discussed as a system that is unstoppable, like it expands. If you take a very cynical</p>
<p>view, it creates war so that it can make money. It doesn&rsquo;t just find places where it can help</p>
<p>through military conflict. It creates tensions that directly or indirectly lead to military</p>
<p>conflict that it can then fuel and make money from.</p>
<p>That is certainly one of the concerns of both people who are critical of the First</p>
<p>World War, and then also of Dwight Eisenhower, right, when he&rsquo;s president and sort of in</p>
<p>his farewell address, where he sort of introduces the term military industrial complex. And</p>
<p>some of it is about the profit motive, but some of it is a fear that Eisenhower had that</p>
<p>no one had an interest in stopping this, right, and that no one had a voice in stopping it,</p>
<p>and that the ordinary American could really do nothing to dial things down.</p>
<p>Is it strange to you that we don&rsquo;t often hear that kind of speech today, with Eisenhower</p>
<p>speaking about the military industrial complex? For example, we&rsquo;ll have people criticizing</p>
<p>the spending on war efforts, but they&rsquo;re not discussing the machinery of the military industrial</p>
<p>complex, like the basic way that human nature works, that we get ourselves trapped in this</p>
<p>thing. They&rsquo;re saying, like, there&rsquo;s better things to spend money on, versus describing</p>
<p>a very seemingly natural process of when you build weapons of war that&rsquo;s going to lead</p>
<p>to more war. Like, it pulls you in somehow.</p>
<p>RW. Yeah, I would say throughout the Cold War, and even after the end of it, there has</p>
<p>not been a sustained conversation in the United States about our defense establishment, right,</p>
<p>what we really need, and what serves our interest, and to what extent sort of other things like</p>
<p>blanket forces, profit motives, belong in that conversation. What&rsquo;s interesting is that</p>
<p>in the generation after the First World War, that conversation was on the table, right,</p>
<p>through a series of investigations in the US, the Nye Committee in Britain, the Royal</p>
<p>Commission, journalistic expos√©s. This would have been just talked about constantly in</p>
<p>the years between about 1930 and 1936, as people were starting to worry that storm clouds</p>
<p>were gathering in Europe again.</p>
<p>LR. Yeah, but it always seems like those folks get pushed to the fringes. You&rsquo;re made an</p>
<p>activist versus a thinking leader.</p>
<p>RW. Those discussions are often marginalized, framed as conspiracy theory, etc. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to realize that in the generation after World War I, this was a serious civic</p>
<p>conversation. It led to investigations of defense finance. It led to experiments in</p>
<p>Britain and France in public finance of war material. I think those conversations need</p>
<p>to be reconvened now in the 21st century.</p>
<p>LR. Is there any parallels between World War I and the war in Ukraine? The reason I bring</p>
<p>it up is because you mentioned there was a hunger for war, a capacity for war that was</p>
<p>already established, and the different parties were just boiling the tensions. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a case made that America had a role to play, NATO had a role to play in the current war</p>
<p>in Ukraine. Is there some truth to that when you think about it in the context of World</p>
<p>War I? Or is it purely about the specific parties involved, which is Russia and Ukraine?</p>
<p>RW. I think it&rsquo;s very easy to draw parallels between World War I and the war in Ukraine,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think they really work. The First World War in some ways is generated by a fundamental</p>
<p>conflict in the European system of empires, in the global system of empires. In many ways,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a parallel, the war in Ukraine is the parallel to some of the conflicts in</p>
<p>the Mediterranean and the Balkans in 1911 to 1913, that then later there was a much</p>
<p>greater conflict. So I think if there&rsquo;s any lessons to be learned for how not to let World</p>
<p>War III look like World War I, it would be to make sure that systems aren&rsquo;t locked into</p>
<p>place that escalate wars out of people&rsquo;s expectations.</p>
<p>LR. That&rsquo;s I suppose what I was implying, that this is the early stages of World War III. That in the same way that several wolves are licking their chops or whatever the expression is, they&rsquo;re creating tension, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>creating military conflict with a kind of unstoppable imperative for a global war. Many people that</p>
<p>are looking at this are really worried about that. Now the forcing function to stop this</p>
<p>war is that there&rsquo;s several nuclear powers involved, which has at least for now worked</p>
<p>to stop full on global war. But I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s going to be the case. In fact, what</p>
<p>is one of the surprising things to me in Ukraine is that still in the 21st century, we can</p>
<p>go to something that involves nuclear powers, not directly yet, but awfully close to directly,</p>
<p>go to a hot war. And so do you worry about that, that there&rsquo;s a kind of descent into</p>
<p>a World War I type of scenario?</p>
<p>RW. Yes, I mean, that keeps me up at night, and I think it should keep the citizens of</p>
<p>both the United States and Russia up at night. And I think, again, it gets back to what I</p>
<p>was saying, that in the summer of 1914, even then, things that looked like a march toward</p>
<p>war could have been different. And so I think it&rsquo;s important for leaders of both countries</p>
<p>and of all of the related countries, of Ukraine, of the various NATO powers, to really imagine</p>
<p>off ramps and to imagine alternatives and to make them possible. Whether it&rsquo;s through</p>
<p>diplomacy, whether it&rsquo;s through other formats, I think that that&rsquo;s the only way to prevent</p>
<p>sort of greater escalation.</p>
<p>LR. What&rsquo;s the difference between World War I and the Civil War? In terms of how they</p>
<p>defined what it means to be an American, but also the American citizen&rsquo;s relationship with</p>
<p>the war, what the leaders were doing, is there interesting differences and similarities?</p>
<p>Besides the fact that everybody seems to have forgot about World War I in the United States</p>
<p>and everyone still remembers Civil War.</p>
<p>RW. I mean, it&rsquo;s true. And the American Civil War defines American identity in some ways,</p>
<p>along with the Revolution and the Second World War, more so than any other conflict. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fundamentally different war. It&rsquo;s won because it is a civil war, because of secession,</p>
<p>because of the Confederacy. This is a conflict happening on the territory of the United States</p>
<p>between Americans. And so the dynamics are really quite different. So the leaders particularly</p>
<p>Lincoln have a different relationship to the home front, to civilians, than they say Wilson</p>
<p>or Roosevelt have in World War I and II.</p>
<p>LR. Also the way you would tell the story of the Civil War, perhaps similar to the way</p>
<p>we tell the story of World War II, there&rsquo;s like a reason to actually fight the war. The</p>
<p>way we tell the story is we&rsquo;re fighting for this idea that all men are created equal,</p>
<p>that the war is over slavery in part. Perhaps that&rsquo;s a drastic oversimplification of what</p>
<p>the war was actually about in the moment, like how do you get pulled into an actual</p>
<p>war versus a hot discussion. And the same with World War II, people kind of framed the</p>
<p>narrative that it was against evil, Hitler being evil. I think the key part of that is</p>
<p>probably the Holocaust, is how you can formulate Hitler&rsquo;s being evil. If there&rsquo;s no Holocaust,</p>
<p>perhaps there&rsquo;s a case to be made that we wouldn&rsquo;t see World War II as such a quote</p>
<p>unquote good war, that there&rsquo;s an atrocity that had to happen to make it really, to be</p>
<p>able to tell a clear narrative of why we get into this war. Perhaps such a narrative doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist for World War I, and so that doesn&rsquo;t stay in the American mind. We try to sweep</p>
<p>it under the rug, given though overall 16 million people died. So to you the difference</p>
<p>is in the fact that you&rsquo;re fighting for ideas and fighting on the homeland. But in terms</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s participation, you know, fighting for your country, was there similarities there?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I think, I mean the Civil War in both the North and the South, troops are</p>
<p>raised overwhelmingly through volunteer recruitment. There is a draft in both the North and the</p>
<p>South, but it&rsquo;s not significant. Only 8% of Confederate soldiers came in through conscription.</p>
<p>And so in fact, the mobilization for volunteers often organized locally around individual</p>
<p>communities or states, creates sort of multiple identities and levels of loyalty, where people</p>
<p>both in the North and the South have loyalty both to their state regiments, to their sort</p>
<p>of community militias and as well to the country. They are fighting over the country, right?</p>
<p>Over the United States. And so the Union and the Confederacy have conflicting and ultimately</p>
<p>irreconcilable visions of that. But that sort of nationalism that comes out of the Union</p>
<p>after the victory in the war is a kind of crucial force shaping America ever since.</p>
<p>So what was the neutrality period? Why did US stay out of the war for so long? What was</p>
<p>going on in that interesting, like, what made Woodrow Wilson change his mind? What was the</p>
<p>interesting dynamic there?</p>
<p>I always say that the United States entered the war in April of 1917, but Americans entered</p>
<p>it right away, right? They entered it. Some of them actually went and volunteered and</p>
<p>fought almost exclusively on the side of Britain and France. At least 50,000 joined the Canadian</p>
<p>army or the British army and served. Millions volunteer. They sent humanitarian aid. I think</p>
<p>in many ways, modern war creates modern humanitarianism, and we can see that in the neutrality period.</p>
<p>And even if they wanted the United States to stay out of the war, a lot of Americans</p>
<p>get involved in it by thinking about it, caring about it, arguing about it. And at the same</p>
<p>time, they&rsquo;re worried that British propaganda is shaping their news system. They are worried</p>
<p>that German espionage is undermining them. They&rsquo;re worried that both Britain and Germany</p>
<p>are trying to interfere in American elections and American news cycles. And at the same</p>
<p>time, a revolution is breaking out in Mexico. So there are sort of concerns about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening in the Western Hemisphere as well as what&rsquo;s happening in Europe.</p>
<p>So World War I was supposed to be the war to end all wars, and it didn&rsquo;t. How did World</p>
<p>War I pave the way to World War II? Every nation probably has their own story in this</p>
<p>trajectory towards World War II. How did Europe allow World War II to happen? How did the</p>
<p>Soviet Union, Russia allow World War II to happen, and how did America allow World War</p>
<p>II to happen? And Japan?</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. The answer is different for each country, right? That in some ways</p>
<p>in Germany, the culture of defeat and the experience of defeat at the end of World War</p>
<p>I leads to a culture of resentment, recrimination, finger pointing blame that makes German politics</p>
<p>very ugly. As one person puts it, brutalizes German politics.</p>
<p>It places resentment at the core of the populace and its politics.</p>
<p>Yeah. And so in some ways, that lays the groundwork for the kind of politics of resentment and</p>
<p>hate that comes from the Nazis. For the United States, in some ways, the failure to win the</p>
<p>peace sets up the possibility for the next war, that the United States, through Wilson,</p>
<p>is sort of crafting a new international order in order that this will be the war to end</p>
<p>all wars. But because the United States failed to join the League of Nations, you see the</p>
<p>United States really sort of on the hook for another generation.</p>
<p>In Asia, the story is more complicated, right? And I think it&rsquo;s worth bearing that in mind</p>
<p>that World War II is a two front war. It starts in Asia for its own reasons. World War I is</p>
<p>transformative for Japan, right? It is a time of massive economic expansion. A lot of that</p>
<p>sort of economic wealth is poured into sort of greater industrialization and militarization.</p>
<p>And so when the military wing in Japanese politics takes over in the 1930s, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in some ways flexing muscles that come out of the First World War.</p>
<p>Can you talk about the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles? What&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>about that dynamics there, of the parties involved, of how it could have been done differently</p>
<p>to avoid the resentment? Or again, is it inevitable?</p>
<p>So the war ends and very soon, even before the war is over, the United States in particular</p>
<p>is trying to shape the peace, right? And the United States is the central actor at the</p>
<p>Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Woodrow Wilson is there, he&rsquo;s presiding, and he knows that</p>
<p>he calls the shots.</p>
<p>So he was respected.</p>
<p>He was respected, but resentfully in some ways by the European powers, Britain and France</p>
<p>and Italy to a lesser extent, who felt that they had sacrificed more. They had two goals,</p>
<p>right? They wanted to shape the imperial system in order to make sure that their kind of fundamental</p>
<p>economic structures wouldn&rsquo;t change. And they also wanted to sort of weaken Germany as much</p>
<p>as possible, right? So that Germany couldn&rsquo;t rise again.</p>
<p>What this leads to is a peace treaty that maintains some of the fundamental conflicts</p>
<p>of the imperial system and makes, bankrupts Germany, starves Germany, and kind of feeds</p>
<p>this politics of resentment that make it impossible for Germany to kind of participate in a European</p>
<p>order.</p>
<p>So people like historian Neil Ferguson, for example, make the case that if Britain stayed</p>
<p>out of World War I, we would have avoided this whole mess and we would potentially even</p>
<p>avoid World War II, this kind of counterfactual history. Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to make</p>
<p>the case for that? That there was a moment, especially in that case, staying out of the</p>
<p>war for Britain, that the escalation to a global war could have been avoided and one</p>
<p>that ultimately ends in a deep global resentment. So where Germany is resentful not just of</p>
<p>France or particular nations, but is resentful of the entire, I don&rsquo;t know how you define</p>
<p>it, the West or something like this, the entire global world.</p>
<p>I wish it were that easy. And I think it&rsquo;s useful to think in counterfactuals. What if?</p>
<p>And if you believe, as historians do, in causation, if that one thing causes another, then you</p>
<p>also have to believe in counterfactuals, right? That if something hadn&rsquo;t happened, then maybe</p>
<p>that would have worked differently. But I think all the things that led to World War</p>
<p>I are multi causal and nuanced. And this is what historians do. We make things more complicated.</p>
<p>And so there was no one thing that could have turned the tide of history. Oh, if only Hitler</p>
<p>had gotten into art school or if only Fidel Castro had gotten into the major leagues.</p>
<p>Those are interesting thought experiments, but few events in history I think are that</p>
<p>contingent.</p>
<p>Well, Hitler is an example of somebody who is a charismatic leader that seems to have</p>
<p>a really disproportionate amount of influence on the tide of history. So if you look at</p>
<p>Stalin, you could imagine that many other people could have stepped into that role.</p>
<p>And the same goes for many of the other presidents through, or even Mao. It seems that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a singular nature to Hitler, that you could play the counterfactual, that if there was</p>
<p>no Hitler, you may have not had World War II. He better than many leaders in history</p>
<p>was able to channel the resentment of the populace into a very aggressive expansion</p>
<p>of the military and I would say skillful deceit of the entire world in terms of his plans</p>
<p>and was able to effectively start the war. So is it possible that, I mean, could Hitler</p>
<p>have been stopped? Could we have avoided if he just got into art school? Or again, do</p>
<p>you feel like there&rsquo;s a current of events that was unstoppable?</p>
<p>I mean, part of what you&rsquo;re talking about is Hitler the individual as a sort of charismatic</p>
<p>leader who&rsquo;s able to mobilize the nation. And part of it is Hitlerism, his own sort</p>
<p>of individual ability to play, for example, play off his subordinates against one another</p>
<p>to set up a system of that nature that in some ways escalates violence, including the</p>
<p>violence that leads to the Holocaust. And some of it is also Hitlerism as a leader cult.</p>
<p>And we see this in many other sort of things where a political movement surrounds one particular</p>
<p>individual who may or may not be replaceable. So yes, the World War II we got would have</p>
<p>been completely different if a different sort of faction had risen to power in Germany.</p>
<p>But Europe, you know, Depression era Europe was so unstable and democracies collapsed</p>
<p>throughout Western Europe over the course of the 1930s, you know, whether they had charismatic</p>
<p>totalitarian leaders or not.</p>
<p>Have you actually read one book I just recently finished? I&rsquo;d love to get your opinion from</p>
<p>a historian perspective. There&rsquo;s a book called Blitzed Drugs in the Third Reich by Norman</p>
<p>Mohler. It makes a case that drugs played a very large role, meth essentially, played</p>
<p>a very large role in World War II. There&rsquo;s a lot of criticism of this book, saying that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of to what you&rsquo;re saying, it takes this one little variable and makes it like</p>
<p>this explains everything. So everything about Hitler, everything about the blitzkrieg, everything</p>
<p>about the military, the way the strategy, the decisions could be explained through drugs,</p>
<p>or at least implies that kind of thing. And the interesting thing about this book because</p>
<p>Hitler and Nazi Germany is one of the most sort of written about periods of human history.</p>
<p>And this was not drugs were almost entirely not written about in this context. So here</p>
<p>come along this semi historian because I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s even a historian. He&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>his work is fiction. Hopefully I&rsquo;m saying that correctly. So he tells a really that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the criticisms he tells a very compelling story that drugs were at the center of this</p>
<p>period and also of the man of Hitler. What are your sort of feelings and thoughts about</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to read this book, but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s books like it that tell</p>
<p>an interesting perspective singular perspective on a war. Yeah, I mean, I have read it and</p>
<p>I also had this sort of eye opening experience that a lot of historians did and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t, why didn&rsquo;t we think about this? And I think whether he&rsquo;s, the author Oller</p>
<p>is sort of not a trained academic historian, but the joy of history is like, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to be one to write good history. And I don&rsquo;t think anyone sort of criticizes him</p>
<p>for, for that. Um, I like the book as a, as a window into the third Reich. You know, of</p>
<p>course drugs don&rsquo;t explain all of it, but it helps us see, um, you know, uh, it see</p>
<p>helps us see the people who supported Hitler, um, uh, the ways in which, um, you know, uh,</p>
<p>it was that mind altering and performance altering drugs were used to kind of keep soldiers</p>
<p>on the battlefield. Um, the ways in which, um, you know, I think that we take, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fully understand the extent to which the third Reich is held together with like duct tape,</p>
<p>um, from, um, you know, from a pretty early phase by like 1940 or 41 even, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all smoke and mirrors. And I think that wartime propaganda, both Germans trying to say, you</p>
<p>know, we&rsquo;re winning everything and America trying to mobilize, uh, and the other allies,</p>
<p>you know, to mobilize against Germany, uh, described a more formidable enemy than it</p>
<p>really was by 1941 and 42.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I could see both cases. Uh, one is that duct tape doesn&rsquo;t make the man,</p>
<p>but also as an engineer, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of duct tape because it does seem to solve a</p>
<p>lot of problems. And, uh, I do worry that this perspective that the book presents about</p>
<p>drugs is somehow to the mind really compelling because it&rsquo;s almost like the mind, or at least</p>
<p>my mind searches for an answer. How could this have happened? And it&rsquo;s nice to have</p>
<p>a clean explanation and drugs is one popular one. When people talk about steroids and sports,</p>
<p>the moment you introduced the topic of steroids, somehow the mind wants to explain all success</p>
<p>in the context was because this person was on steroids, Lance Armstrong. Well, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it like, it&rsquo;s a very sticky idea. Certain ideas, certain explanations are very sticky.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really dangerous because then you lose the full context. And also in</p>
<p>the case of drugs, it removes the responsibility from the person, both for the military genius</p>
<p>and the evil. And I think you, I mean, it&rsquo;s a very dangerous thing to do because something</p>
<p>about the mind, maybe it&rsquo;s just mind that&rsquo;s sticky to this. Well, drugs explain it. If</p>
<p>the drugs didn&rsquo;t happen, uh, then it would be very different. Yeah. It worries me how</p>
<p>compelling it is of an explanation, you know? Yeah. So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s maybe better to think</p>
<p>of it as a window into the third, right? Is that an explanation of it? But it&rsquo;s also a</p>
<p>nice exploration of Hitler, the man. For some reason, discussing his habits, especially</p>
<p>later in the war, um, his practices with drugs gives you a window into the person. It reminds</p>
<p>you that there&rsquo;s a human, this is a human being, like a human being that gets emotional</p>
<p>in the morning, gets thoughtful in the morning, hopeful, sad, depressed, angry, like a story</p>
<p>of emotions of the human being. Somehow we construct, um, which is a pretty dangerous</p>
<p>thing to do, construct an evil monster out of Hitler when in reality he&rsquo;s a human being</p>
<p>like all of us. I think the lesson there is the soldier needs to lesson, which is all</p>
<p>of us to some degree are capable of evil. Um, or maybe if you want to make it less powerful</p>
<p>a statement, many of our leaders are capable of evil. That this Hitler is not truly singular</p>
<p>in history. That, uh, yeah, when the resentment of the populace matches the right charismatic</p>
<p>leader, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s easy to make the kind of, not easy, but it&rsquo;s possible to frequently</p>
<p>make the kind of, uh, initiation of military conflict that happened in World War, World</p>
<p>War II. By the way, because you said not a trained historian, one of the, one of the</p>
<p>most compelling and I don&rsquo;t know, entertaining and fascinating exploration of World War I</p>
<p>comes from Dan Carlin. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to listen to his sort of podcast</p>
<p>form telling of the blueprint for Armageddon, which is the telling of World War I. What</p>
<p>do you think about Dan Carlin, you yourself as a historian who has studied, who has written</p>
<p>about World War I? Do you, do you enjoy that kind of telling of history? Absolutely. And</p>
<p>I think, um, again, you know, uh, you don&rsquo;t need a PhD in history to, to be a historian.</p>
<p>Um, does every historian agree with that? Uh, he gets quite a bit of criticism from</p>
<p>historians. Uh, you know, I mean, we, you know, we like to argue with each other and</p>
<p>nitpick with each other, but, um, but the one thing I have no patience for is when we</p>
<p>like pull rank on each other. Um, you know, I think, um, we depend on, uh, you know, if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, you know, a historian in a university with degrees and research materials, you know,</p>
<p>you depend on the work of people in some local community, like recording oral histories,</p>
<p>saving documents. And history is a, it&rsquo;s a social science, but it&rsquo;s also a storytelling</p>
<p>art. Um, and you know, uh, history books are the ones you find on the shelves and bookstores</p>
<p>that people read for, for fun. And, and then, and you can appreciate both the, the knowledge</p>
<p>production, um, as well as the storytelling. Um, and when you get a good oral storyteller</p>
<p>like Dan Carlin, um, there&rsquo;s a reason that thousands and hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p>tune in. Yeah. But he definitely suffers from anxiety about getting things correct. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s very difficult. Well, our first job is to get the facts, uh, the facts</p>
<p>correct and then, and then to tell the story off of those. But the, the facts are so fuzzy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, I mean, you have the, probably my favorite telling of World War II is William</p>
<p>Shire&rsquo;s Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. And, uh, or at least not telling of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>And that goes to primary sources a lot, which is like, I suppose that&rsquo;s the honest way to</p>
<p>do it. But it&rsquo;s tough. It&rsquo;s really tough to write that way, to really go to primary sources</p>
<p>always. And I think the, one of the things that Dan tries to do, which is also really</p>
<p>tough to do, perhaps easier in, in oral history is, uh, try to make you feel what it was like</p>
<p>to be there. Which, uh, I think he does by trying to tell the story of like individual</p>
<p>soldiers and, um, do you find that telling like individual citizens? Do you find that</p>
<p>kind of telling of history compelling?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I think we need, uh, historical imagination. Um, and I think historical imagination</p>
<p>teaches something very valuable, which is humility, um, to realize that there are other</p>
<p>people, um, who&rsquo;ve lived on this planet and they organized their lives differently and,</p>
<p>you know, they made it through just fine too. Um, and, um, you know, I think that, that,</p>
<p>that kind of, of, of meeting other people from the past can be actually a very useful</p>
<p>skill for meeting people unlike you in the present.</p>
<p>Unlike you, but also like you. I think both are, uh, both are humbling. One realizing</p>
<p>that they did live in a different space and time, but two realizing that if you, if you</p>
<p>were placed in that space and time, you might have done all the same things, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the brave, good thing or the evil thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. Um, and you get a, also a sense of, um, uh, of possibility. You know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this famous line, right? That, um, you know, those who do not learn history are</p>
<p>condemned to repeat it. Um, but I think the other half is true, uh, as well, which is</p>
<p>those who do not learn history don&rsquo;t get the chance to repeat it, right? Um, you know,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not the first people on this planet to face, you know, any certain kinds of problems.</p>
<p>Um, you know, other people have, have lived through worlds like this one before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you fall in love as a teenager for the first time, there&rsquo;s, and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a breakup. You think it, it&rsquo;s the greatest tragedy, tragedy that has ever happened in</p>
<p>the world. You&rsquo;re the first person. Even though, like, Romeo and Juliet and so on had, had</p>
<p>this issue, you&rsquo;re the first person that truly feels the catastrophic heartbreak of that</p>
<p>experience. It&rsquo;s good to be reminded that no, the human condition is what it is. We</p>
<p>have lived through it at the individual and the societal scale.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about nationalism, which I think is at the core of I want you poster.</p>
<p>Is nationalism destructive or empowering to a nation? And we can use different words like</p>
<p>patriotism, which is in many ways synonymous to nationalism, but in recent history, perhaps</p>
<p>because of the Nazis has, has, um, slowly parted ways that somehow nationalism is when</p>
<p>patriotism, patriotism gone bad or something like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re different, right? Um, patriotism, um, you know, patriotism is in</p>
<p>some ways best thought of as an emotion, right? Uh, and a feeling of, of love of country,</p>
<p>right? Um, you know, uh, literally, um, uh, and in some ways that&rsquo;s a necessary condition</p>
<p>to participate in nationalism. Um, you know, whether to me, I think nationalism is crucial,</p>
<p>um, in a world organized around nation states. Um, and you have to sort of believe that you</p>
<p>are engaged in a common project together, right? Um, and so, you know, in the contemporary</p>
<p>United States, um, you know, uh, in some ways that that question is actually on the table</p>
<p>in ways that it hasn&rsquo;t been in the past, but you know, you have to believe that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>engaged in a common project, that you have something in common with the person with whom</p>
<p>you share this nation. Um, and, um, and that you would sacrifice for them, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>by paying taxes for them or, um, you know, we&rsquo;re going to war to defend them. Um, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a vision of, you know, what we might call civic nationalism. Um, uh, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the good version. The question is whether you could have that, um, without having, um,</p>
<p>exclusionary nationalism, you know, hating the other, right? Fearing the other saying,</p>
<p>uh, yeah, you&rsquo;re part of this nation, uh, against all others. Um, and I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a long tradition in America of a very inclusive, uh, nationalism, um, that is open, uh, inclusive,</p>
<p>um, and, you know, new people to this shared project. Um, that&rsquo;s something to be defended.</p>
<p>Exclusionary nationalism is based on, you know, um, uh, uh, ethnic hatreds and others</p>
<p>that we see throughout the world. Um, those are things to be afraid of.</p>
<p>But there is a kind of narrative in the United States that a nationalism that includes the</p>
<p>big umbrella of democratic nations, nations that strive for freedom and everybody else</p>
<p>is against, is against freedom and against human nature. And it just so happens that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s half and half split across the world. So that&rsquo;s imperialism that feels like it beats</p>
<p>the drum of war.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I, I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to paint too rosy a picture and certainly, you know,</p>
<p>the United States, um, as a nation has often found it easier to define ourselves against</p>
<p>something than to clarify exactly what we&rsquo;re for.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. The Cold War, China today. That&rsquo;s not only United States. I suppose that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s human nature. It&rsquo;s, we need a competitor. It&rsquo;s almost like maybe the success of human</p>
<p>civilization requires figuring out how to construct competitors that don&rsquo;t result in</p>
<p>global war.</p>
<p>Yes. Or figuring out how to turn enemies into rivals and competitors. There&rsquo;s a real difference.</p>
<p>You know, you can, you, you know, you compete with competitors. You, you fight with enemies.</p>
<p>Yeah. With competitors is a respect, maybe even a love underlying the competition.</p>
<p>What lessons, what are the biggest lessons you take away from World War I? Maybe we talked</p>
<p>about several, but you know, you look back at the 20th century. What, as a historian,</p>
<p>what do you learn about human nature, about human civilization, about history from looking</p>
<p>at this war?</p>
<p>I think the, the lesson I would want everyone to take from the story of the First World</p>
<p>War is that human life is not cheap. That all of the warring powers thought that just</p>
<p>by throwing more men and more material at the front, they would solve their political</p>
<p>problems with military force. And at the end of the day in 1918, one side did win that,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t actually solve any of those political problems.</p>
<p>And in the end, the regular people paid the price with their lives.</p>
<p>They did. And people who, people who had been told that their lives were cheap remembered</p>
<p>that, right? And it sort of, you know, reshapes mass politics for the rest of the 20th century,</p>
<p>both in Europe and around the world.</p>
<p>Yeah. The, yeah, the cost of a death of a single soldier is not just, or a single civilian</p>
<p>is not just the cost of that single life. It&rsquo;s the resentment, that the anger, the hate</p>
<p>that reverberates throughout. One of the things I saw in Ukraine is the birth of, at scale</p>
<p>of generational hate, not towards administrations or leaders, but towards entire peoples. And</p>
<p>that hate, I mean, overnight that hate is created and it takes perhaps decades for that</p>
<p>hate to dissipate.</p>
<p>It takes decades and it takes, it takes collective effort to build institutions that divert that</p>
<p>hate into other places.</p>
<p>One of the biggest things I thought was not part of the calculus in when the United States</p>
<p>invaded Afghanistan and Iraq is the creation of hate. When you drop a bomb, even if it</p>
<p>hits military targets, even if it kills soldiers, which in that case it didn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>large amount of civilians. What does that do to the, yeah, like, how many years, minutes,</p>
<p>hours, months, and years of hate do you create with a single bomb you drop? And I calculate</p>
<p>that like literally in the Pentagon have a chart, how many people will hate us? How many</p>
<p>people does it take, do some science here, how many people does it take, when you have</p>
<p>a million people that hate you, how many of them will become terrorists? How many of them</p>
<p>will do something to the nation you love and care about, which is the United States, will</p>
<p>do something that will be very costly? I feel like there was not a plot in a chart. It was</p>
<p>more about short term effects.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s again, it&rsquo;s the idea of using military force to solve political problems. And I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a squandering of goodwill that people have around the world toward the United States.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a respect for its economy, for its consumer products, and so forth. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been lost, a lot of that.</p>
<p>Do you think leaders can stop war? I have perhaps a romantic notion, perhaps because</p>
<p>I do these podcasts in person and so on, that leaders that get in a room together and can</p>
<p>talk, they can stop war. I mean, that&rsquo;s the power of a leader, especially one in an authoritarian</p>
<p>regime that they can, through camaraderie, alleviate some of the emotions associated</p>
<p>with ego.</p>
<p>Yes, leaders can stop war if they get into the room when they understand from the masses</p>
<p>in their countries that war is something that they want stopped.</p>
<p>So the people ultimately have a really big say.</p>
<p>They do, that it was mass movements by people in the United States for the nuclear freeze,</p>
<p>even Russia pushing for openness that brought, for example, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev</p>
<p>to Reykjavik to sort of debate and eventually sort of put caps on nuclear weapons. Those</p>
<p>two people made choices in the room that made that possible, but they were both being pushed</p>
<p>and knew they were being pushed by their people.</p>
<p>Boy, that&rsquo;s a tough one. It puts a lot of responsibility on the German people, for example.</p>
<p>In both wars, we fans of history tend to conceive of history as a meeting of leaders. We think</p>
<p>of Chamberlain, we think of Churchill and the importance of them in the Second World</p>
<p>War. We think about Hitler and Stalin and think that if certain conversations happen,</p>
<p>the war could have been avoided. You tell the story of how many times Hitler and Nazi</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s military might was not sufficient, they could have been easily stopped. And the</p>
<p>pacifists, the people who believed Hitler or foolish enough to believe Hitler didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>act properly. And if the leaders just woke up to that idea, in fact, Churchill is a kind</p>
<p>of representation of that. But in your conception here, it&rsquo;s possible that Churchill was also</p>
<p>a representation of the British people, even though seemingly unpopular. That gave birth</p>
<p>to somebody like Churchill, who said, we&rsquo;ll never surrender, right? She&rsquo;ll fight in the</p>
<p>beaches.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think World War II Britain is a good example of that. It is clearly a dynamic</p>
<p>leader who has his pulse on what the people want and demand and are willing to do. And</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a dynamic art of leading that and shaping those wants at the same time as</p>
<p>knowing that you&rsquo;re bound by them.</p>
<p>Well then if we conceive of history in this way, let me ask you about our presidents.</p>
<p>You are taking on the impossibly difficult task of teaching a course in a couple of years</p>
<p>here or in one year called the history of American presidential elections. So if the</p>
<p>people are in part responsible for leaders, how can we explain what is going on in America</p>
<p>that we have the leaders that we do today? So if we think about the elections of the</p>
<p>past several cycles, I guess let me ask, are we a divided nation? Are we more of a divided</p>
<p>nation than we were in the past? What do you understand about the American citizen at the</p>
<p>beginning of this century from the leaders we have elected?</p>
<p>Yes, obviously we are a divided country in our rhetoric, in our day to day politics.</p>
<p>But we are nowhere near as divided as we have been in other periods in our history, right?</p>
<p>The most obvious, of course, being in the American Civil War, 150 years ago. And the</p>
<p>distinction is not just that we haven&rsquo;t come to blows, but that we are fundamentally one</p>
<p>society, one economy, and sort of deeply integrated as a nation, both domestically and on the</p>
<p>world stage in ways that look nothing like the United States in 1861. Will political</p>
<p>rhetoric continue to be extreme? Of course. But we&rsquo;re not as divided as people think we</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>Well, then if you actually look throughout human history, does it always get, so outside</p>
<p>of the people, do the elections get as contentious as they&rsquo;ve recently been? So there&rsquo;s a kind</p>
<p>of perception has been very close and there&rsquo;s a lot of accusations, a lot of tensions. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very heated. It&rsquo;s almost fueling the machine of division. Has that often been the case?</p>
<p>It has. It hasn&rsquo;t, it hasn&rsquo;t. I mean, I do think right now is different. And there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth distinguishing, are there deep social or economic divisions, which I don&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>think that there are, versus partisanship in particular, sort of the rivalry between</p>
<p>the two parties. And it&rsquo;s very clear that we are in an era of what political scientists</p>
<p>call hyper partisanship, right? And that the two parties have taken sort of fundamentally</p>
<p>different positions and moved further apart from one another. And that is what I think</p>
<p>people talk about when they say our country is divided. So the country may not be divided</p>
<p>even if our politics are highly partisan. That is a divergence from other time periods</p>
<p>in our history.</p>
<p>So I wonder if this kind of political partisanship is actually an illusion of division. I sometimes</p>
<p>feel like we mostly all agree on some basic fundamentals and the things that people allegedly</p>
<p>disagree on are really blown out of proportion. And there&rsquo;s like a media machine and the politicians</p>
<p>really want you to pick a blue side and a red side. And because of that, somehow I mean,</p>
<p>families break up over Thanksgiving dinner about who they voted for. There&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>strong pressure to be the red or blue. And I wonder if that&rsquo;s a feature or a bug. Whether</p>
<p>this is just part of the mechanism of democracy that we want to, even if there&rsquo;s not a real</p>
<p>thing to be divided over, we need to construct it such that you can always have attention</p>
<p>of ideas in order to make progress, to figure out how to progress as a nation.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re figuring that out in real time. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s easy to say that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a feature of a political system that has two parties. And the United States is in some</p>
<p>ways unique in not being a parliamentary democracy. And so in some ways, you would think that</p>
<p>would be the feature that is causing partisanship and to reach these heights. That said, we</p>
<p>can even see in parliamentary systems all around the world that the same kinds of rhetorics</p>
<p>of irreconcilable division, a kind of politics of emotion are proliferating around the world.</p>
<p>Some of that, as you say, I think is not as real as it appears on television, on social</p>
<p>media and other formats. I don&rsquo;t know that other countries that are experiencing political</p>
<p>conflict, I&rsquo;m not sure that they&rsquo;re deeply divided either.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had the fortune of being intellectually active through the George Bush versus Al Gore</p>
<p>election, then the Obama and it&rsquo;s just every election since. And it seems like a large</p>
<p>percentage of those elections, there&rsquo;s been a claim that the elections were rigged, that</p>
<p>there is some conspiracy, corruption, malevolence on the other side. I distinctly remember when</p>
<p>Donald Trump won in 2016, a lot of people I know said that election was rigged and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different explanations, including Russian influence. And then in 2020, I was just running</p>
<p>in Austin along the river and somebody said like, oh, huge fan of the podcast. And they</p>
<p>said like, what do you think of it? This is just not right. What&rsquo;s happening in this country</p>
<p>that the 2020 election was obviously rigged from their perspective in electing Joe Biden</p>
<p>versus Donald Trump. Do you think there&rsquo;s a case to be made for and against each claim</p>
<p>in the full context of history of our elections being rigged?</p>
<p>I think the American election system is fundamentally sound and reliable. And I think that the evidence</p>
<p>is clear for that regardless of which election you&rsquo;re looking at. In some ways, whether you</p>
<p>look at a presidential election or even a local county election for dog catcher or something,</p>
<p>that the amount of time and resources and precision that go into voter registration,</p>
<p>vote counting, certification processes are crucial to democratic institutions.</p>
<p>I think when someone says rigged, regardless of which side of the political spectrum they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming from, they&rsquo;re looking for an answer. They&rsquo;re looking for that one answer for what</p>
<p>is in fact a complex system. So on the left, when they say rigged, they may be pointing</p>
<p>to a wide range of ways in which they think that the system is tilted through gerrymandering,</p>
<p>misrepresentation through the electoral college. On the right, when people say rigged, they</p>
<p>may be concerned about voter security, about ways in which the mainstream media may control</p>
<p>messages. And in both cases, the feeling is it&rsquo;s articulated as my vote didn&rsquo;t get counted</p>
<p>right. But the deeper concern is my vote doesn&rsquo;t count. My voice isn&rsquo;t being heard. So no, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think the elections are rigged.</p>
<p>So let me sort of push back, right? There&rsquo;s a comfort to the story that they&rsquo;re not rigged.</p>
<p>And a lot of us like to live in comfort. So people who articulate conspiracy theories</p>
<p>say, sure, it&rsquo;s nice to be comfortable, but here&rsquo;s the reality. And the thing they articulate</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s incentives in close elections, which we seem to have nonstop close elections.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many financial interests. There&rsquo;s so many powerful people. Surely you can construct</p>
<p>not just with the media and all the ways you describe both on the left and the right, the</p>
<p>elections could be rigged, but literally actually in a fully illegal way manipulate the results</p>
<p>of votes. Surely there&rsquo;s incentive to do that. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a totally ridiculous</p>
<p>argument because it&rsquo;s like, all right, well, I mean, it actually lands to the question,</p>
<p>which is a hard question for me to ask as an optimist of how many malevolent people</p>
<p>out there and how many malevolent people are required to rig an election. So how many,</p>
<p>what is the face transition for a system to become from like a corruption light to high</p>
<p>level of corruption such that you could do things like rig elections, which is what happens</p>
<p>quite a lot in many nations in the world even today.</p>
<p>So yes, there is interference in elections and there has been in American history. And</p>
<p>we can go all the way back into the 18th century. You don&rsquo;t have to go back to Texas in the</p>
<p>1960s, LBJ to find examples of direct interference in the outcome of elections. And there are</p>
<p>incentives to do that. Those incentives will only feel more existential as hyper partisanship</p>
<p>makes people think that the outcome of the elections are a matter of black and white</p>
<p>or life and death. And you will see people organizing every way they can to shape elections.</p>
<p>We saw this in the 1850s when settlers, pro and anti slavery, flooded into Kansas to try</p>
<p>to determine the outcome of an election. We see this in the reconstruction period, right?</p>
<p>When the Ku Klux Klan shows up to block the doors for black voters in the South. This</p>
<p>history is not new, it&rsquo;s there. I think the reason why I think that the system is sound</p>
<p>is not&hellip; When I say I believe that the election system is fundamentally sound, I&rsquo;m not trying</p>
<p>to be reassuring or encourage complacency, right? I&rsquo;m saying this is something that we</p>
<p>need to do and to work on.</p>
<p>So the current electoral mechanisms are sufficiently robust. Even if there is corruption, even</p>
<p>if there is rigging, the force that self corrects and ensures that nobody gets out of line is</p>
<p>much stronger than the other incentives, which are the corrupting incentives. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing I talked about visiting Ukraine, talking about corruption, where a lot of people</p>
<p>talk about corruption as being a symptom. If the system allows, creates these incentives</p>
<p>for there to be corruption, humans will always go for corruption. That&rsquo;s just, you have to</p>
<p>assume that. The power of the United States is that it constructs systems that prevent</p>
<p>you from being corrupt at scale. At least, I mean, it depends what you believe of most</p>
<p>of us. If you believe in this country, you have to&hellip; You believe in the self correcting</p>
<p>mechanisms of corruption, that even if that desire is in the human heart, the system resists</p>
<p>it, prevents it. That&rsquo;s your current belief.</p>
<p>Yes, as of today. But I do think that that will require oversight by institutions, ideally</p>
<p>ones that are insulated as much as possible from partisan politics, which is very difficult</p>
<p>right now. And it will require the demands of the American people that they want these</p>
<p>elections to be fair and secure. And that means being willing to lose them, regardless</p>
<p>of which party you&rsquo;re in favor of.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the power of the media to create partisanship? I&rsquo;m really worried</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a huge incentive, speaking of incentives, to divide the country. The media</p>
<p>and the politicians, I&rsquo;m not sure where it originates, but it feels like it&rsquo;s the media.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a very cynical perspective on journalism, but it seems like if we&rsquo;re angry and divided</p>
<p>as evenly as possible, you&rsquo;re going to maximize the number of clicks. So it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>the media wants to elect people that are going to be the most divisive, maximizing. And the</p>
<p>worry I have is they are not beyond either feeding or, if you want to be very cynical,</p>
<p>manufacturing narratives that lead that division, like the narrative of an election being rigged.</p>
<p>Because if you convinced half the populace that the election was completely rigged, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really good way to get a lot of clicks. And the very cynical view is I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if the media machine will stop the destruction of our democracy in service of getting more</p>
<p>clicks. It may destroy our entire democracy just to get more clicks, just because the</p>
<p>fire as the thing burns down will get clicks. Am I putting too much blame on the media here?</p>
<p>The machine of it?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re diagnosing the incentive structure, you&rsquo;re depicting that with 100% accuracy.</p>
<p>But I think history teaches that you might be giving the media too much sort of causal</p>
<p>power, that the American people are smarter than the media that they consume. Even today,</p>
<p>we know that. Even people who consume just Fox or just MSNBC know what they&rsquo;re consuming.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that media will be the solution. And I certainly don&rsquo;t think that returning</p>
<p>to a media structure of the mid 20th century with three news channels that all tell us</p>
<p>one story, that&rsquo;s no golden age that we&rsquo;re trying to get back to, for sure.</p>
<p>Well, there is a novel thing in human history, which is Twitter and social media and so on.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to find our footing as a nation to figure out how to think about politics,</p>
<p>how to maintain our basic freedoms, our sense of democracy, of our interaction with government</p>
<p>and so on, on this new medium of social media. Do you think Twitter, how do you think Twitter</p>
<p>changed things? Do you think Twitter is good for democracy? Do you think it has changed</p>
<p>what it means to be an American citizen? Or is it just the same old media mechanism?</p>
<p>It has not changed what it means to be an American citizen. It may have changed the</p>
<p>day to day sound of being and the experience of it. It got noisier, it got louder and it</p>
<p>got more decentered. I think Twitter, it&rsquo;s paradoxical. On the one hand, it is a fundamentally</p>
<p>democratic platform. And in some ways, it democratizes institutions that had gatekeepers</p>
<p>and authority figures for a very long time. But on the other hand, it&rsquo;s not a democratic</p>
<p>institution at all. It&rsquo;s a for profit corporation. And it operates under those principles. And</p>
<p>so that said, it&rsquo;s an institution of American and global life that the people of the United</p>
<p>States have the authority to regulate or reshape as they see fit, both that and other major</p>
<p>media players.</p>
<p>So one of the most dramatic decisions that illustrate both sides of what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is when Twitter decided to ban, I think permanently, the President of the United States, Donald</p>
<p>Trump off of Twitter. Can you make the case that that was a good idea and make the case</p>
<p>that that was a bad idea? Can you see both perspectives on this?</p>
<p>Yes, I think, I mean, the simple fact of the matter is, you know, Twitter is a platform,</p>
<p>it has rules of service. Twitter concluded that President Trump had violated the terms</p>
<p>of service and blocked him, right? And if you have rules, you have to enforce them.</p>
<p>Did it have, you know, did it have consequences? It had direct and predictable consequences,</p>
<p>you know, that of creating a sense among millions of Americans that Twitter had taken a side</p>
<p>in politics or confirming their belief that it had done so. Will it have unintended consequences?</p>
<p>You know, this is where the historian can come in and say, yes, there&rsquo;s always unintended</p>
<p>consequences. And we don&rsquo;t know, you know, sort of what it would mean for political figures</p>
<p>to be excluded from various media platforms under sort of under these notions, right,</p>
<p>that they had violated terms of service, etc. So, you know, so I guess we&rsquo;ll see, I guess.</p>
<p>Well, to me, so I&rsquo;m generally against censorship. But to take Twitter&rsquo;s perspective, it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>to me, in terms of unintended consequences, whether censoring a human being from being</p>
<p>part of your platform is going to decrease or increase the amount of hate in the world.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a strong case to be made that banning somebody like Donald Trump increases the amount</p>
<p>of resentment among people, and that&rsquo;s a very large number of people that support him, or</p>
<p>even love him, or even see him as a great president, one of the greatest this country</p>
<p>has had. And so if you completely suppress his voice, you&rsquo;re going to intensify the support</p>
<p>that he has, from just the regular support for another human being who ran for president,</p>
<p>to somebody that becomes an almost heroic figure for that set of people. Now, the flipside</p>
<p>is removing a person from a platform like Donald Trump might lessen the megaphone of</p>
<p>that particular person, might actually level the democratic notion that everybody has a</p>
<p>voice. So basically, removing the loud extremes is helpful for giving the center, the calm,</p>
<p>the thoughtful voices more power. And so in that sense, that teaches a lesson that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be crazy in any one direction. Don&rsquo;t go full, don&rsquo;t go Lenin, don&rsquo;t go Hitler, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like you have to stay in the middle. There&rsquo;s divisions in the middle, there&rsquo;s discussions</p>
<p>in the middle, but stay in the middle. That&rsquo;s sort of the steel man the case for, for censoring.</p>
<p>But I, boy, is censorship a slippery slope. And also boys Twitter becoming a thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more than just a company. It seems like it&rsquo;s a medium of communication that we use for,</p>
<p>for information, for, for knowledge, for wisdom even, you know, during the period of COVID,</p>
<p>we use that to gain an understanding of what the hell&rsquo;s going on. What should we do? What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the state of the art science? Science fundamentally transformed during the time of COVID because</p>
<p>you have no time for the full review cycle that science usually goes through. And some</p>
<p>of the best sources of information for me, from the conspiracy theory to the best doctors</p>
<p>was Twitter. The data, the stats, all that kind of stuff. And that feels like, like more</p>
<p>than a com more than a company. And then Twitter and YouTube and different places took a really</p>
<p>strong stance on COVID, which is the lazy stance in my opinion, which is we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to listen to whatever CDC or the institutions have said. But the reality is you&rsquo;re an institution</p>
<p>of your own now. You&rsquo;re kind of the press. You&rsquo;re like, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really difficult position. It&rsquo;s a really, really difficult position to take. But I wish</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve stepped up and take on the full responsibility and the pain of fighting for the freedom of</p>
<p>speech. Yes, they need, they need to do that. But you know, I&rsquo;m struck by some of the things</p>
<p>that you said, ways in which, you know, Twitter has the power to shape the conversation. And</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think in a democratic society, democratic policies should cede that power to, to for</p>
<p>profit companies. Do you agree that it&rsquo;s possible that Twitter has that power currently? Do</p>
<p>you sense that it has the power? Is that my sense is Twitter has the power to start wars,</p>
<p>like tweets have the power to start wars to, to, yeah, to, to change the direction of elections?</p>
<p>Maybe in the sense in the ways in which, you know, a wave has the power to wash away sand,</p>
<p>right? You know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s still the medium, right? It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not in itself</p>
<p>an actor. It&rsquo;s how actors use the platform, which requires us to scrutinize the structure</p>
<p>of the platform and access to it. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not, maybe it&rsquo;s similar to the wave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a medium. It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a medium plus, it&rsquo;s a medium that enables virality</p>
<p>that benefits from virality of engagement. And that means singular voices can, can have</p>
<p>a disproportionate impact, like not even voices, singular ideas, dramatic ideas can have a</p>
<p>disproportionate impact. And so that actually threatens, it&rsquo;s almost like I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>the equivalent is in nature, but it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a wave that can grow exponentially because</p>
<p>of the intensity of the, the initial intensity of the wave. I don&rsquo;t know how to describe</p>
<p>this as a dynamical system, but it feels like, it feels like there, there is a responsibility</p>
<p>there not to accelerate, not to accelerate voices just because they get a lot of engagement.</p>
<p>You have to have a proportional representation of that voice. But you&rsquo;re saying that a strong</p>
<p>democracy should be robust to that. A strong democracy can and should, and will be. I mean,</p>
<p>I think the other thing a historian will tell you about Twitter is that this too shall pass,</p>
<p>right? Yeah. But, but I do think, you know, the structures of, of the, of the platform</p>
<p>of the algorithm of, of this and other major players are, are eligible for scrutiny by,</p>
<p>by democratic institutions. So in preparing to teach the course, the history of American</p>
<p>presidential elections leading up to the 2024 elections. So one of the lessons of history</p>
<p>is this too shall pass. So don&rsquo;t make everything about, this is, this is going to either save</p>
<p>or destroy our nation. That seems to be like the message of every single election. As I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing Trump hands. Do you think Donald Trump, what do you think about the 2024 election?</p>
<p>Do you think Donald Trump runs? Do you think the, the tension will grow? Or was that a</p>
<p>singular moment? Do you think you&rsquo;ll be like AOC versus Trump or whoever, whatever the</p>
<p>most maximum drama maximizing thing? Or will things stabilize?</p>
<p>I think I can, I can, you know, historians don&rsquo;t like to predict the future, but I can</p>
<p>predict this one that it will not be a calm and, and, and stabilized election. I think</p>
<p>as of, you know, the time that we&rsquo;re talking in 2022, we don&rsquo;t, there are too many you</p>
<p>know, sort of open questions, particularly about whether Joe Biden will run for reelection.</p>
<p>He says he will, but you know, but the jury I think is out on that. You know, I, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>predict whether Donald Trump will run for, for election or not. I think you know, we</p>
<p>do know that, that, that president Trump doesn&rsquo;t like to, to start things he can&rsquo;t win. And</p>
<p>if the polling data suggests that he&rsquo;s not a credible candidate, he might be reluctant</p>
<p>to enter the race and might might find more appealing, the kind of sideline kind of King</p>
<p>maker role that he&rsquo;s been crafting since he left the White House. You know, I think there</p>
<p>are plenty of people who are you know, dreaming that there&rsquo;s some sort of centrist candidate</p>
<p>you know, you know whether it&rsquo;s a conservative Democrat or a liberal Republican who will</p>
<p>you know, save us from, from, from all of this either within the party or in a third</p>
<p>party run. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s likely.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t we getting them? Why don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s likely? What&rsquo;s the explanation?</p>
<p>This seems to be a general hunger for a person like this.</p>
<p>You would, but the system sorts it out, right? You know, that the, the, that the primary systems</p>
<p>and the party you know, party candidate selection systems you know, will favor sort of more,</p>
<p>you know, more partisan views, right? More conservative Republicans, more liberal Democrats</p>
<p>as the kind of center candidates.</p>
<p>It seems like the system prefers mediocre executor, mediocre leaders, mediocre partisan</p>
<p>leaders. If I had to take a cynical look, but maybe I&rsquo;m romanticizing the leaders of</p>
<p>the past and maybe I&rsquo;m just remembering the great leaders of the past. And yeah, I can</p>
<p>assure you there&rsquo;s plenty of mediocre partisans in the 19th century.</p>
<p>In the 20th. Well, let me ask you about platforming. Do you think Donald, it&rsquo;s the Twitter question,</p>
<p>but I was torn about whether to talk to Donald Trump on this podcast. As a historian, what</p>
<p>would you advise?</p>
<p>I think, I mean, you know, this is a, this is a difficult question, right? For, for historians</p>
<p>who want, you know, sort of want to make sure that they know sort of what Americans are</p>
<p>thinking and talking about, you know, for centuries later. So one of the things that,</p>
<p>you know, at least my understanding is that when President Trump was banned from Twitter,</p>
<p>his account was also deleted. And that is one of the most valuable sources that historians</p>
<p>will use to understand that the era and parts of it were sort of, you know, archived and</p>
<p>reconstructed. But, you know, but in that sense, I think that that is also a real loss</p>
<p>to the historical record. I mean, I think that your podcast shows you&rsquo;ll, you&rsquo;ll talk</p>
<p>to, you&rsquo;ll talk to anyone. I&rsquo;m here, right? So, you know, I&rsquo;m not in the business of saying,</p>
<p>you know, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t talk, don&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the difficult things when I think about Hitler. I think Hitler, Stalin,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if World War I quite has the same intensity of controversial leaders. But</p>
<p>one of the sad things from a historian perspective is how few interviews Hitler has given or</p>
<p>Stalin has given. And that&rsquo;s such a difficult thing because it&rsquo;s obvious that talking to</p>
<p>Donald Trump, that talking to Xi Jinping, talking to Putin is really valuable from a</p>
<p>historical perspective to understand. But then you think about the momentary impact</p>
<p>of such a conversation and you think, well, depending on how the conversation goes, you</p>
<p>could steer or a flame. What is it? Feed the flame of war or conflict or, um, abuses of</p>
<p>power and things like this. And that&rsquo;s, I think the tension between the journalist and</p>
<p>the historian, because when a journalist interview dictators, for example, one of the things</p>
<p>that strikes me is they&rsquo;re often very critical of the dictator. They&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, um, they&rsquo;re basically attacking them in front of their face as opposed to trying</p>
<p>to understand. Because what I perceive they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re signaling to the other journalists</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re on the right side of history kind of thing. Um, but that&rsquo;s not very productive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also why the dictators and leaders often don&rsquo;t do those interviews. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>productive to understanding who the human being is. To understand, you have to empathize.</p>
<p>Because few people, I think few leaders do something from a place of malevolence. I think</p>
<p>they really do think they&rsquo;re doing good. And not even for themselves, not even for selfish</p>
<p>reasons. I think they&rsquo;re doing great for the, they&rsquo;re doing the right thing for their country</p>
<p>or for whoever the group they&rsquo;re leading. And to understand that you have to, and, and</p>
<p>by the way, a large percent of the country often supports them. I bet if you poll legitimately</p>
<p>poll people in North Korea, they will believe that their leader is doing the right thing</p>
<p>for their country. Um, and so to understand that you have to empathize. So that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>tension of the journalist, I think, and the historian, cause obviously the historian doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care. They really want to, they care obviously deeply, but they, they know that</p>
<p>history requires deep understanding of the human being in the full context. Uh, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a tough decision to make.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I think it&rsquo;s, uh, both for journalists and historians, um, the challenge is not to</p>
<p>be too close to your subject, right? Um, and you know, not to be, um, overly influenced</p>
<p>and used by them, right? You know, when you&rsquo;re talking to a living subject, which historians</p>
<p>do, you know, um, to, um, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a matter of making sure that you triangulate</p>
<p>their story with, with the rest of the record, right? Um, uh, and that may paint a different</p>
<p>picture of, of the person then, um, and will prevent you as a journalist or a historian</p>
<p>from kind of, you know, just telling someone else&rsquo;s story. And so, and historians also</p>
<p>have the benefit of going back, you know, 30, 40 years and finding all the other stories</p>
<p>and figuring out, you know, uh, playing two truths and a lie, you know, which parts are,</p>
<p>you know, which parts are accurate, which are, which are not. And journalists do that</p>
<p>work in a day to day basis, but historians, um, you know, we get a little more time to</p>
<p>think about what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Well, I, I personally also think it&rsquo;s deeply disrespectful to the populace, to people,</p>
<p>to um, censor and ignore a person that&rsquo;s supported by a very large number of people. Like that</p>
<p>you owe, I personally feel like you owe the citizens of this country a deep, uh, empathy</p>
<p>and understanding of the leaders they support, even if you disagree with what they say. I</p>
<p>mean, that&rsquo;s the, the, to me, I&rsquo;m much more worried about the resentment of the censorship,</p>
<p>um, that it&rsquo;s to having a good conversation with Donald Trump is, is ultimately valuable.</p>
<p>Uh, because he, I think, uh, especially in this case, I agree with you that Donald Trump</p>
<p>is not a singular person. He is a, he represents a set of feelings that a large number of people</p>
<p>have and whatever those feelings are, you can try to figure out by talking to people,</p>
<p>but also talking to the, the, the, the man and then seeing the interplay there, what</p>
<p>does this really represent in this period in history, in this slice of the world? Um,</p>
<p>yeah, ultimately understanding, I think leads to, uh, compassion and love and unity, which</p>
<p>is how this whole thing progresses. The tension between the different sides is useful to,</p>
<p>um, have a good conversation, but ultimately coming up with the right answer and progressing</p>
<p>towards that answer is, is how you make progress. Do you think a pure democracy can work? So</p>
<p>we have this representative of democracy with these contentious elections and so on. When</p>
<p>we start a civilization on Mars, which becomes more and more realistic technologically, we</p>
<p>can have a more direct access to be able to vote on issues and vote for ideas. Do you</p>
<p>think it can work? I don&rsquo;t think we have to go to Mars, uh, to do it. Right. Um, uh, I</p>
<p>think, um, the answer is not, you know, to flip a switch and turn on something called</p>
<p>pure democracy. Um, uh, when people are not ready for it, when their, uh, incentive structures</p>
<p>are not sort of structured for it, but you can, um, you know, experiment with more democratic</p>
<p>forms of governance one after another, right? Whether it&rsquo;s, um, you know, sort of experimenting</p>
<p>with, um, technology to find new ways of sort of, of getting, uh, greater rates of participation</p>
<p>in democracy. Um, I think that we see some experiments in, um, sort of more complicated</p>
<p>systems of voting, um, that in fact might actually be more reflective of people&rsquo;s choices</p>
<p>than simply picking one candidate, right? Sort of ranked choice voting or, uh, runoffs,</p>
<p>other kinds of things. Um, you know, I think that we can think more, uh, creatively about</p>
<p>something like participatory budgeting, right? In which, um, you know, uh, we put all this</p>
<p>money into the government. Um, and then, um, you know, we, we, um, you know, should, as</p>
<p>a, as a people, there are more democratic ways of, of sort of, of how we spend it. Um,</p>
<p>and I think the most urgent in some level is a more, uh, democratic form of foreign</p>
<p>policymaking, right? That foreign policymaking, decision making, um, uh, about the military,</p>
<p>about foreign policy, um, is, is very ways insulated from, from popular participation,</p>
<p>um, in, in modern American history. Um, and I think, you know, there, uh, technology is</p>
<p>not the, the going to solve this. Um, you know, it&rsquo;s a combination of technology and,</p>
<p>and human creativity, but I think, um, you know, I think we can start heading that direction.</p>
<p>Whether we get there before we get to Mars, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What interesting lessons and thoughts, if you look at the fundamentals of the history</p>
<p>of American elections, do you hope to reveal when you try to teach the class? And, um,</p>
<p>how would those fundamentals be met by the, by the students that received that wisdom?</p>
<p>So what do you think about this dance? It&rsquo;s such an interesting idea. And I hope you do</p>
<p>go through with this kind of idea is look at the history while the next one is happening.</p>
<p>Yes. I think, you know, it&rsquo;s worth remembering, right? That the students who are typical American</p>
<p>student who&rsquo;s in college right now, right? Has lived their entire life after, uh, the</p>
<p>election of 2000 and Bush V Gore, right? Um, and after nine 11 probably. And yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes. After all of, after all of these things. Right. And, and, um, so on the one hand they</p>
<p>take partisanship and contentious elections for granted. Um, they don&rsquo;t, I think share,</p>
<p>um, you know, sort of some vision that things were, you know, things used to be different,</p>
<p>right? They don&rsquo;t remember a world that had like lots of moderate Democrats and liberal</p>
<p>Republicans and, um, you know, sort of running around in it. Um, but, um, you know, so in</p>
<p>some ways it&rsquo;s a way of, of looking back into the past to find other ways of, of, of organizing</p>
<p>our politics. Uh, it&rsquo;s also a way of, of reassuring students that we have been through contentious</p>
<p>and even, um, sort of violent elections before in our history. Um, and you know, that people</p>
<p>have defended the right to vote, right? People have risked their lives to vote. Um, uh, you</p>
<p>know, I think they will, they will understand that, that as well.</p>
<p>And maybe knowledge of history here can help deescalate the emotions you might feel about</p>
<p>one candidate or another. And I, from a place of calmness, you can more easily arrive at</p>
<p>wisdom.</p>
<p>Uh, that, that&rsquo;s my hope. Um, yeah.</p>
<p>Just as a brief aside, you, brief aside, but nevertheless, uh, you wrote the book Bound</p>
<p>by War that describes a century of war in the Pacific. So looking at this slice of geography</p>
<p>and power, uh, so most crucially through the partnership between the United States and</p>
<p>the Philippines, can you tell us some aspect of the story that is often perhaps not considered</p>
<p>when you start to look more at the geopolitics of Europe and Soviet Union and the United</p>
<p>States? What, how did the, the war in, in the Pacific define the 20th century?</p>
<p>Yeah, I came to this book Bound by War, um, from a sense that, um, that our stories were</p>
<p>too lopsided, um, toward, toward Europe, right? That American history, when viewed from the</p>
<p>Pacific, um, specifically in the 20th century, um, helps us understand American power, um,</p>
<p>in some new ways, right? Uh, not only American, uh, projection of power into Asia, right?</p>
<p>But also the ways in which American power affected, uh, people in Asia, right? Um, either</p>
<p>as, uh, you know, in places like the Philippines where the United States, uh, had a colony</p>
<p>for almost 50 years or Asian Americans, people who had migrated over their descendants in</p>
<p>the United States. And those linkages, uh, between the United States and Asia, uh, particularly,</p>
<p>uh, the U S Philippine connection, I think were something that needed to be traced across</p>
<p>the 20th century. Cause it&rsquo;s a way kind of a new way of seeing American power, you know,</p>
<p>from, from a different angle, uh, you see it in, in that way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect that define America from, from when you take the perspective of the</p>
<p>Pacific, what, what military conflict and, and the asymmetry of power there, right?</p>
<p>So I start in, uh, in 1898, um, you know, with the U S invasion of the Philippines,</p>
<p>um, uh, it&rsquo;s a conquest and annexation. Uh, and I think in many ways, this is a defining</p>
<p>conflict of the 20th century. That&rsquo;s often completely overlooked or described, uh, I</p>
<p>think incorrectly as merely a war with Spain, right? That the war in the Philippines, um,</p>
<p>is our, uh, our first extended overseas conflict, our first conflict, um, in what would come</p>
<p>to be called the developing world or third world. Uh, it&rsquo;s a form of, of counter insurgency.</p>
<p>Um, you know, this is the U S army sort of learning lessons that are then repeated again</p>
<p>in the second world war in Korea, Vietnam, and, and even after 9 11.</p>
<p>Is the Philippines our friends or enemies in this history?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the interesting part, right? Is that, uh, the book focuses in particular</p>
<p>on Filipinos, uh, who fight with the Americans who fought, you know, sort of in the U S army</p>
<p>and Navy, um, over the course of the 20th century. And they are in a fundamentally ironic</p>
<p>position, right? They are, they are from the Philippines and they&rsquo;re fighting for the United</p>
<p>States, um, which is the colonial power, uh, occupying their country. Um, and I think that,</p>
<p>that irony persists, right? Um, so if you look at sort of polling data where they ask</p>
<p>people all around the world, you know, you know, do you think positively or negatively</p>
<p>about the United States? Um, that the highest, uh, responses are from the Philippines, right?</p>
<p>Filipinos view the United States more favorably than people from any other country in the</p>
<p>world, including America, right? That, that they&rsquo;re more think more favorably of Americans</p>
<p>than Americans do. Um, and so, you know, sort of unpacking that irony is, is part of what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get at in the book.</p>
<p>What was the people power revolution and what lessons can we learn from it? You kind of</p>
<p>assign an important, um, a large value to it in terms of what we can learn for the,</p>
<p>uh, the American project.</p>
<p>Yeah. So in 1986, um, the, the president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos is overthrown</p>
<p>by a popular revolution known as people power, um, uh, in the wake of a contested and probably,</p>
<p>uh, almost certainly rigged election, um, that, that sort of, uh, you know, kind of</p>
<p>confirms his, his, his rule. Um, when that is over, overturned through sort of mass movements</p>
<p>in the Philippines, it&rsquo;s also, uh, sort of confirmed in many ways by the, the reluctance</p>
<p>of the United States to intervene, to prop up a cold war ally. Ferdinand Marcos had supported</p>
<p>American policy throughout, um, his administration. Um, the Reagan administration, Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>president at the time, basically chooses not to support him. That&rsquo;s a personally wrenching</p>
<p>decision for, for Reagan himself. Um, but it, it he&rsquo;s being shaped in many ways by the</p>
<p>emerging voices of neoconservative political, uh, foreign policy voices. Um, in particular,</p>
<p>uh, Paul Wolfowitz and the state department and others who see sort of movements for democracy</p>
<p>and democratization that then kind of, uh, take fire in the late 20th century in Latin</p>
<p>America, um, in South Korea, in Eastern Europe, um, and, you know, all around the world until</p>
<p>it hits the wall in, in Tiananmen Square in June, 1989.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s that wall? Uh, what&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s the wall, what&rsquo;s the, what, what do you mean</p>
<p>by it hits the wall? So there are, you know, the, there are global</p>
<p>movements for pot for democratization, um, for, for, uh, opening up, um, you know, throughout</p>
<p>the world, um, starting in the 1980s. Um, and, you know, obviously they continue, um,</p>
<p>in Eastern Europe with the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. Um, you know, I say it hits</p>
<p>the wall in, in, in China, um, in, with the protests in Tiananmen Square and that are,</p>
<p>that are blocked, um, and that are crushed. And I think represent, uh, a real sort of</p>
<p>turning point, um, in the history of, of democratic institutions, uh, on a global scale in the</p>
<p>late 20th century.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some places where the fight for freedom will work and some places not. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the kind of lesson from the 20th to take forward to the 21st century.</p>
<p>Uh, no, I think the lesson is, is maybe one that, that, you know, we talked about earlier</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this dynamic dance between, um, between leaders, whether, uh, totalitarian</p>
<p>leaders or leaders of democratic movements and the people that they&rsquo;re leading. Um, and</p>
<p>some, you know, sometimes it works and sometimes, sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Let me ask a big, ridiculous question because we talked about, uh, sort of presidential</p>
<p>elections. Um, now this is objectively, definitively, you have to answer one person. Who is the</p>
<p>greatest president in American history?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>Is that easy? Not George Washington?</p>
<p>Um, you know, Washington had his, uh, had the statesman qualities. He understood his</p>
<p>power as, as, uh, as the first president.</p>
<p>Also relinquished power.</p>
<p>He was willing to relinquish power. Um, he, you know, uh, but, but Lincoln has the combination</p>
<p>of personal leadership, um, a fundamental moral character and, um, and just the ability</p>
<p>to kind of, uh, to fight the, the fight of politics, to play the game of it, um, to get</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s going, to play the short game and the long game, um, to kind of, you know, make</p>
<p>to, uh, you know, to work with his enemies, to, to block them when he had to. Um, and</p>
<p>you know, I mean, he, uh, gets the United States through the civil war. So you gotta</p>
<p>give him some credit for that.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s pretty good at making speeches.</p>
<p>Uh, it, you know, obviously it helps that he&rsquo;s, uh, uh, a remarkable speaker, um, and</p>
<p>able to convey those kinds of visions. Um, but, um, you know, but he, but he is first</p>
<p>and foremost a politician, um, and probably the best one we have.</p>
<p>Both at getting elected and at ruling.</p>
<p>In some ways better, better at the doing than at the getting elected, right? Um, you know,</p>
<p>that he, uh, you know, the election of 1860 is a, it&rsquo;s just a hot mess. Um, you know,</p>
<p>that that could have worked out, um, many different ways. And even the election of 1864,</p>
<p>um, you know, when we have a presidential election in the middle of a civil war, um,</p>
<p>it was not a foregone conclusion that Lincoln would be reelected. Um, so, you know, both</p>
<p>times he&rsquo;s sort of, um, you know, he&rsquo;s not a, a master campaigner, um, by, by any means,</p>
<p>but he, he was a master politician as a, as a governor.</p>
<p>Do we have leaders like that today? Is, is that, so one perspective is like, well, leaders</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t, ain&rsquo;t what they used to be. And then another perspective is, well, we always romanticize</p>
<p>stuff that happens in the past. We forget the flaws and remember the great moments.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh, both of those things are true, right? Um, on the one hand, um, you know, we, we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, uh, we are not surrounded by people of, of Lincoln&rsquo;s caliber, um, right now.</p>
<p>That feels like the case.</p>
<p>Um, and I think that, I think we can say that with some certainty, but, um, you know, I,</p>
<p>I always like to point to president Harry Truman who left office with, you know, some</p>
<p>truly abysmal, uh, uh, presidential ratings, um, was dismissed as a, throughout his presidency</p>
<p>as a, you know, as a, as unqualified as not knowing what he was doing, et cetera. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s then, you know, turns out, um, uh, with hindsight, we know that he was better at the</p>
<p>job than anyone understood better at getting elected, right? You remember that sign, do</p>
<p>he defeats Truman, right? He showed them, right? Uh, and better, better at holding power</p>
<p>and better at sort of, um, you know, kind of building the kind of institutions that</p>
<p>long after he was gone, um, demonstrated that he, he, he won the long game.</p>
<p>And some of that is the victors do write the story. And, um, I asked myself very much,</p>
<p>how will history remember Volodymyr Zelensky? It&rsquo;s not obvious. And how will history remember</p>
<p>Putin? That too is not obvious. Um, because it depends on how the role, the geopolitics,</p>
<p>the, how the nations, how the history of these nations unravel, unfold rather. So it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>interesting to think about. And the same is true for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Obama, uh,</p>
<p>George Bush, uh, Bill Clinton, and so on. I think it&rsquo;s a probably unanswerable question</p>
<p>of which of the presidents will be remembered as a great president from this time. You can</p>
<p>make all kinds of cases for all kinds of people and they do, but it&rsquo;s unclear. It&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>to think about when the robots finally take over, uh, what, which of the humans they will</p>
<p>appreciate the most. Uh, let me ask for advice. Do you have, um, advice for, for young folks</p>
<p>as they, uh, uh, cause you mentioned the, the, the folks you&rsquo;re teaching, they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even, they don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to have waited on the internet for the, for the thing</p>
<p>to load up for every single webpage is suffering. They don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to not have</p>
<p>the internet and have a dial phone that goes, and then the joy of getting angry at somebody</p>
<p>and hanging up with a physical phone. They don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t know any of that. Uh, so</p>
<p>for those young folks that look at the contention election, contentious elections, they look</p>
<p>at our contentious world, our divided world. What advice would you give them of how to</p>
<p>have a career they can be proud of? Let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re in college or in high school and</p>
<p>how to have a life they can be proud of.</p>
<p>Oh man, that&rsquo;s a big question. Um, yeah, I&rsquo;ve never given a graduation speech. Uh,</p>
<p>this is like warm up. Let&rsquo;s look for like raw materials before you write it. Uh, if</p>
<p>I did, um, I think, um, I think I would advise students, um, that history teaches that you</p>
<p>should be more optimistic than, um, than your current surroundings suggest. Right. And I</p>
<p>think it would be very easy as a young person today to think, um, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>I can do about this politics. There&rsquo;s nothing I can say to this person on the other side</p>
<p>of the aisle. There&rsquo;s nothing I can do about, you know, the planet, um, uh, et cetera, and</p>
<p>just sort of give up. Um, and I think history, uh, teaches that, um, you know, uh, you know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know who the winners and losers are in the long run, but, um, but we know that</p>
<p>the people who give up are always the losers. Right. Um, so don&rsquo;t give into cynicism or</p>
<p>apathy. Yeah. Optimism paves the way. Yeah. Because human beings are deeply, uh, resilient</p>
<p>and creative, even under, um, far more difficult circumstances than, um, you know, than we</p>
<p>face right now. Well, let me ask a question that you don&rsquo;t even need to, that you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even dare cover in your graduation, um, uh, commencement speech. Uh, what&rsquo;s the meaning</p>
<p>of life? Why are we here? This whole project that history studies and analyzes as if, as</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a point to the whole thing. What is the point? All the wars, all the presidents,</p>
<p>all the struggles to discover what it means to be human of, uh, or reach for a higher</p>
<p>ideal. Why? Why do you think we&rsquo;re here? Hmm. I think this is where there is often a handoff</p>
<p>from the historian, um, to the clergy, um, you know, who, but in the end, um, uh, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>less of there&rsquo;s less distance between the two than you think. Right. That, um, you know,</p>
<p>if you think about some of the kind of, uh, answers to that question, what is the meaning</p>
<p>of life that are given from religious traditions? Um, often they have a fundamentally historical</p>
<p>core, right? It&rsquo;s about, you know, unifying the past and the present, um, in some other,</p>
<p>you know, non earthly, um, sort of dimension. Uh, and you know, so I think there is that,</p>
<p>I think even for people who, who don&rsquo;t have a religious belief and there&rsquo;s a way in which</p>
<p>history, um, is about the shared, the shared human condition. Um, and I think historians</p>
<p>aspire to telling all of that story, right? Um, you know, we, we drill down on the, on</p>
<p>the miseries of, of war and depressions and, and so forth. But, um, but you know, the story</p>
<p>is not complete without, you know, blueberries and butterflies and, and, and, and all the</p>
<p>rest that, that go with it. So both the humbling and the inspiring aspect that you get by looking</p>
<p>back at human history that, uh, we&rsquo;re in this together. Christopher, this is a huge honor.</p>
<p>This is an amazing conversation. Thank you for taking us back to a war that, uh, not</p>
<p>often discussed, but in many ways defined the 20, the 20th century and the century we</p>
<p>are in today, which is the first world war, the war that was supposed to end all wars,</p>
<p>but instead defined the future wars and defines our struggle to, to try to avoid the world</p>
<p>war three. So it&rsquo;s a huge honor you talk with me today. This is amazing. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Christopher Capozzola. To support this</p>
<p>podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you</p>
<p>some words from Woodrow Wilson in 1917 about world war one that haunted the rest of the</p>
<p>20th century. This is a war to end all wars. George Santana, a Spanish American philosopher</p>
<p>responded to this quote in 1922 by saying, only the dead have seen the end of war. Thank</p>
<p>you for listening. I hope to see you next time.</p>
