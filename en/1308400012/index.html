    <p>Hi friends! This episode is gonna be all about red flags, and yes, I have enough</p>
<p>fucking red flags to make an entire episode on them. Now these are gonna be</p>
<p>random things that I think are red flags. If you don&rsquo;t agree, you&rsquo;re wrong, but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to be wrong. That&rsquo;s fine. If you do or are any of these things, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t mean any offense to you, I just probably wouldn&rsquo;t date you. And half of</p>
<p>these things are just things that piss me off, okay? So I have sections for this. I</p>
<p>have things people post and do on social media, I have a whole list of tattoos, and</p>
<p>then I have shit about a vehicle and someone&rsquo;s car, and then I have a whole</p>
<p>just list of random ass shit too. And then I have some deep ones. There are</p>
<p>gonna be some that are like funny and you&rsquo;re gonna kind of be like, huh, like</p>
<p>little quirky shit, then there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of deep ones. We&rsquo;re gonna get into</p>
<p>all of it. Like, I have subcategories for this shit because I am so serious. So</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;ve learned about red flags is there are little things you can look</p>
<p>for and spot that reveals how someone&rsquo;s brain works. So these little things, they</p>
<p>might just seem like little weird fucking things that I&rsquo;m pointing out, but</p>
<p>it shows that their judgment is flawed. If they think these things are</p>
<p>acceptable, their judgment is fucked, and for them to rationalize it in their brain</p>
<p>for this to be okay, something&rsquo;s wrong. That&rsquo;s a red flag in itself. These</p>
<p>are just things to help you notice someone&rsquo;s brain don&rsquo;t fucking work</p>
<p>properly, their judgment is bad. And also there&rsquo;s some things that scream no</p>
<p>self-awareness, and that is a motherfucker you need to avoid. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just get right into this shit, and I do want to start with the category of</p>
<p>social media. So the first thing I want to talk about is people&rsquo;s bios. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care if it&rsquo;s Instagram, TikTok, whatever their bio is, if they have their</p>
<p>snapchat username in their bio, they&rsquo;re a fucking whore. Don&rsquo;t fuck with them. They</p>
<p>like fucking attention, they like to send in little nudey-dudeys on fucking</p>
<p>snapchat, they got snapchat for attention. No, don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>involved with this person. I don&rsquo;t care, y&rsquo;all can get mad at me about</p>
<p>that one, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck, okay? The second thing that goes along with that</p>
<p>is their cash app. If they have their cash app or their Venmo in any of their</p>
<p>bios, get the fuck away from them. Don&rsquo;t interact. Okay, I need to cool it. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna be so harsh with my delivery of this shit. You know what? Yes I am, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my podcast, I can say what I want. If they have their mental disorder in their</p>
<p>bio, no. That screams that they&rsquo;re gonna use it as an excuse. I made a whole</p>
<p>episode on this shit, but if someone has their mental disorder in their bio, why</p>
<p>the fuck are you bragging about that? Why the fuck are you posting about that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between sharing your experiences and what you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through to help others relate, versus using it as a fucking personality trait,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing. I kind of borderline want to say if someone has</p>
<p>the rainbow flag in their bio, it&rsquo;s a red flag, but it&rsquo;s not. That&rsquo;s just my</p>
<p>personal thing. Like, you&rsquo;ll never catch me with a rainbow flag in my bio, because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to be associated with the gay community. I&rsquo;m gay, but these</p>
<p>motherfuckers are embarrassing. They&rsquo;re literally embarrassing. I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>be associated. So the rainbow flag is fine, because I know that we all want to</p>
<p>find each other and all the gays. Like, it&rsquo;s just a good way for people to, like,</p>
<p>find each other. I get it, but that&rsquo;s teetering for me. That&rsquo;s, like, on the</p>
<p>fucking fence for me. So something else in their bio. If they have ten fucking</p>
<p>job titles, model, singer, songwriter, actor, entrepreneur, stock investor, broker,</p>
<p>like, bitch, why do you have so much fucking shit? Realtor. Add that one.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s a fucking realtor. If they have, like, 25 things that they do, that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>red flag. Why the fuck are you doing so many things, one? And two, what are you</p>
<p>trying to gain by letting everyone know that you do all these things? Like, is it</p>
<p>feeding your sense of being important, or what? Because, like, that&rsquo;s just, no, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not gonna be mean. I&rsquo;m just gonna say what these are. A big red flag. If they</p>
<p>post anything about their phone being dry, if they use that terminology at all,</p>
<p>whether they post about it, or they talk about it, if someone fucking posts about</p>
<p>their phone being dry, cut them off. Block them. Get rid of them. Another one. If they</p>
<p>lip-sync, but it&rsquo;s wrong. Like, if it&rsquo;s obvious they&rsquo;re singing the wrong</p>
<p>fucking word, bro, like I said, this exposes someone&rsquo;s judgment. They fucking</p>
<p>had to re-watch that video before they posted it. That&rsquo;s how stories work. You</p>
<p>have to re-watch the video. And if someone doesn&rsquo;t re-watch the video, that&rsquo;s a red</p>
<p>flag. So if someone can just record something and post it, they have too much</p>
<p>trust in their self, okay? No. Could never be me. But for someone to lip-sync the</p>
<p>wrong fucking words and then post it anyway, babe, what? Just redo it. Redo it</p>
<p>and get the words right, cuz you look like a fucking buffoon. Another type of story</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a red flag is a black screen. Someone that posts a black screen, or a</p>
<p>blank screen, with something along the lines of, like, they&rsquo;re upset, or they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>mad, or whatever. All that is is for fucking attention. They want people to</p>
<p>swipe up and ask what&rsquo;s wrong, or ask what happened. I don&rsquo;t like those type</p>
<p>people. And since I&rsquo;m on that, the black screen for attention, I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead</p>
<p>and talk about the people that ask for prayers. So they&rsquo;ll make a fucking post</p>
<p>asking for prayers and not say why. Bitch, you are just asking for attention. All you</p>
<p>want is for people to be up your ass asking, why? What happened? What&rsquo;s wrong? Oh</p>
<p>my god. Like, bitch, no. I don&rsquo;t like that. You know, asking for prayers itself is a</p>
<p>red flag. Asking for prayers and not saying why, it&rsquo;s another red flag. So</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just stack these motherfuckers on top of each other. Your flagpole is full.</p>
<p>Okay, next one. If they post pictures of money, red flag. What the fuck is that? Are</p>
<p>we 13? Why are you posting pictures of money? That&rsquo;s embarrassing. And the people</p>
<p>that are usually posting pictures of money, it&rsquo;s not that much. It&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>grand. Maybe two, three grand. Like, bitch, if it&rsquo;s not a million dollars cash, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>post shit. And even if there is a million dollars cash, don&rsquo;t post that, cuz</p>
<p>someone like me now knows to come rob you, bitch. Like, don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>play like that. Don&rsquo;t post money. Do not do that. It&rsquo;s tacky. And what goes hand in</p>
<p>hand with that is posting the picture of the bill at a restaurant. Nobody gives a</p>
<p>fuck how much your dinner was, bitch. Just pay the bill and tip good, okay?</p>
<p>Cuz you didn&rsquo;t post the tip. I saw you left that out. It&rsquo;s cheap-ass. So another</p>
<p>red flag. If they only have pictures of theirself posted, that&rsquo;s self-explanatory.</p>
<p>And also, if they&rsquo;re overly perfect. Like, if they look like a fucking Ken doll or</p>
<p>a Barbie doll, like, if they&rsquo;re overly perfect, something&rsquo;s off. And my only</p>
<p>problem with looking too perfect is you&rsquo;re fucking stiff. Like, to hang out</p>
<p>with one of these people that look so fucking perfect, they&rsquo;re stiff, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not as confident as they seem. Like, there&rsquo;s just a lot of things to unpack.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the term. There&rsquo;s a lot of things you can unpack with each of these red</p>
<p>flags, and I&rsquo;m not gonna fucking do all of it. If you don&rsquo;t get it from me just</p>
<p>saying it, you don&rsquo;t get it, okay? So just ignore it. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. The girls</p>
<p>that get it, get it. The ones that don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t. If you haven&rsquo;t seen that TikTok, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get the reference. But just, whatever. The people that get it, get it.</p>
<p>If they post too much of their body, and before y&rsquo;all attack me for body shaming,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about body shaming. If someone wants to go be a whore, go be a</p>
<p>whore. There needs to be people that make porn because I need something to fucking</p>
<p>beat off to, okay? Like, I&rsquo;m not mad at y&rsquo;all for posting yourself naked and</p>
<p>shirtless and all this and that. Like, do what the fuck you want, I don&rsquo;t care. But</p>
<p>for someone like me, it&rsquo;s a red flag. Why are you showing your body so much? If</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just a normal civilian and you&rsquo;re not an entertainer, why the fuck are you</p>
<p>doing that? Why are you showing off all the goods? Like, if I&rsquo;m going to look at</p>
<p>dating you and you have everything posted online, if you have a picture of</p>
<p>your fucking ass online as a guy, I don&rsquo;t want to fuck with you. Why are you</p>
<p>showing everybody your ass? Like, that&rsquo;s for me. If I&rsquo;m dating you, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>nobody else seeing what I&rsquo;m dating. Bitch, no. I want you wrapped the fuck up like a</p>
<p>Muslim wife, bitch. I want you wrapped up. I don&rsquo;t want nobody seeing nothing, just</p>
<p>your eyes. Like, I&rsquo;m so protective and territorial. Like, if someone is showing</p>
<p>their body all the time, why is that the focal point of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>posting? That&rsquo;s the thing. If it&rsquo;s the focal point of what they post is that</p>
<p>they look good shirtless or they look good almost naked, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>attention-seeking there and I don&rsquo;t fuck with that. So, if they post some</p>
<p>shirtless shit, some cutesy shit, some here and there, that&rsquo;s fine. But if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the focal point of their entire personality online, ah, red flag. Okay, this</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s kind of funny. If they&rsquo;re always doing shit and they never post who they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>with, so if they&rsquo;re always going out to nice dinners or they&rsquo;re always traveling</p>
<p>somewhere and they&rsquo;re not posting who they&rsquo;re with, you know what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on. Someone has a sugar daddy. Or they&rsquo;re with someone that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>gross. So, that&rsquo;s just not really a red flag, but that&rsquo;s just one of those</p>
<p>signals to, like, dive deeper. Get curious, bitch. Start asking. Ask questions.</p>
<p>Cuz, like, don&rsquo;t put puzzle pieces out because I will connect them. And</p>
<p>sometimes I put them in the wrong spots, but it makes sense and it&rsquo;s funny. Okay,</p>
<p>if they have too much designer shit, like high-end designer stuff, if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>focal point of most of their outfits and their posts, steer clear because that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very asleep individual. I used to be one. I used to fucking think that that was</p>
<p>what made you important and that&rsquo;s what was cool, but now I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>embarrassing. Like, if someone is trying too hard to show off that they have</p>
<p>something designer, it&rsquo;s gross. I tend to keep talking about Birkins, but everybody</p>
<p>knows what a goddamn Birkin is. When a girl has a Birkin and she holds it the</p>
<p>opposite way. Like, you know how when you see it from the front and it&rsquo;s got the</p>
<p>little clasp things and it&rsquo;s got the whole, you know what it fucking looks</p>
<p>like and it hangs open? You know what I mean. When bitches are so rich, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not posing for the picture to make sure that you can see their bags. Like, when</p>
<p>girls have Chanel bags and they&rsquo;re not trying to show it off. Like, if you can</p>
<p>just tell what it is, but the bitches that hold the Birkin backwards, like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll hold the front towards them, you just see the back or the side of the bag.</p>
<p>That is the biggest fuck you and I love it. That is the funniest shit to me and</p>
<p>that is the most green flag, because they&rsquo;re not trying to pose their Birkin</p>
<p>for social media. Green flag, green flags for you. Okay, the next one, if they always</p>
<p>post every single one of their thoughts. Like, if they are constantly on fucking</p>
<p>Twitter tweeting every thought that they have, any thought they think, if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>posting it, I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s on Twitter or their story or whatever, shut</p>
<p>up. Shut the fuck up. Like, you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s clear you&rsquo;re neglected. Like, no one cares</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re thinking. Like, every thought does not need to be posted and half of</p>
<p>them are embarrassing. So, that&rsquo;s just a red flag in itself. Unpack that on your</p>
<p>own. Next one, if someone is constantly taking breaks from social media, and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not talking the person that takes a break and actually takes a break, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking the bitch that posts, I&rsquo;m taking a break from social media and posts the</p>
<p>next day. Like, bitch, how, that was a quick break? You&rsquo;re back very fast. But, you know</p>
<p>what I mean? Like, the people that are constantly, I&rsquo;m taking a break, it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>toxic, wah, and they&rsquo;re back on it like a day or two later, or that night, which is</p>
<p>funny. I just want to give a heads up to people that do that, no one gives a fuck</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re taking a break from social media. If you don&rsquo;t post for a week,</p>
<p>people probably aren&rsquo;t gonna notice. Like, no one is watching you that fucking hard,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many other people to be entertained by, that people are probably</p>
<p>not gonna notice if you take a break. You don&rsquo;t need to announce it. So, I feel</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a ploy for attention, and that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s a red flag, is</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re constantly saying, I&rsquo;m taking a break from social media, and</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re right back on it. Like, bitch, if you&rsquo;re gonna say you&rsquo;re gone for a</p>
<p>week, be gone for a week and fuck off. Like, don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t like not</p>
<p>keeping their word, motherfucker. So, keep it. Okay, this one is a very personal one</p>
<p>to me, and I might, I&rsquo;m gonna offend every fucking gay person that listens to this,</p>
<p>but this is just for me. If I&rsquo;m interested in a guy, and I follow him, and</p>
<p>I see that he follows a lot of other gay guys, I&rsquo;m out. I&rsquo;m disgusted. I&rsquo;m over it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done. My feelings are hurt. Why the fuck do you follow that many people that</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t me? I don&rsquo;t like that. Like, that&rsquo;s just messy as fuck to me, but I get that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a thing in the community. Like, all gays just follow each other. I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking like it. The stereotypical gays that post, like,</p>
<p>shirtless every fucking picture, and they&rsquo;re just the typical, like, circuit</p>
<p>gays. I don&rsquo;t like that shit. I don&rsquo;t want to be near it. If you follow too many</p>
<p>boys, red flag. That&rsquo;s for me, though. So, if you&rsquo;re a girl, and you like guys, and</p>
<p>he follows too many bitches, that&rsquo;s a red flag. Why you following so many people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not me? Like, I&rsquo;m upset about that. Like, I don&rsquo;t fucking like, this is why</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m single, y&rsquo;all, because I understand it doesn&rsquo;t make logical sense, but I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>help it. Like, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. Like, as soon as you start to like me, you</p>
<p>should be unfollowing every other single person that&rsquo;s not me. Like, every other</p>
<p>attractive boy needs to be gone. You don&rsquo;t need- why would you want to be</p>
<p>looking at him? You have me now. You have me to be interested in. Oh, this next one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna piss you off. People that post, happy Father&rsquo;s Day, happy Mother&rsquo;s Day, to</p>
<p>their fucking parents, and write this long-ass paragraph, and their parents</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even have social media. Like, bitch, you just made this whole Instagram</p>
<p>post for the person that&rsquo;s never gonna see it. How about you go spend the</p>
<p>fucking day with your parent? How about you go talk to them in their face, and go</p>
<p>tell them this personally, instead of making a post they&rsquo;re not gonna fucking</p>
<p>see? And honestly, if you&rsquo;re posting a Father&rsquo;s Day picture, and your dad is</p>
<p>ugly, you just wasted my time. Fuck you. At least give me something to look at</p>
<p>when I scroll past your long fucking paragraph. Ooh, one I just thought of, off</p>
<p>the cuff, if someone has someone&rsquo;s death date in their bio, like, R.I.P. whoever, in</p>
<p>their bio, like, girl, why the fuck do you need that there? Why do you need that</p>
<p>there? Like, let&rsquo;s think this through. I get your mourning, I get you&rsquo;re upset, but</p>
<p>like, I guess I&rsquo;m just too private about my life. I don&rsquo;t want people to know too</p>
<p>much about me, and I&rsquo;m, like, very private. So people that post too fucking much, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like, no. Um, me with my whole ass podcast. But people with the death date shit, like,</p>
<p>why you got that up there? Like, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re not, like, it&rsquo;s okay. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to do that. They know that you miss them. Okay, my final one for social media</p>
<p>is someone that sends too many fucking DMs. If I send someone a DM, and they do</p>
<p>not respond to it, I&rsquo;m not sending them another one, okay? If we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>conversation, and you&rsquo;re not, like, I&rsquo;m not gonna double message you, fuck you. And</p>
<p>also, if I&rsquo;m messaging someone I don&rsquo;t know, and have not talked to before, like,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m trying to slide in someone&rsquo;s DMs, which is very rare, it is a big thing for</p>
<p>me. So if I slide in someone&rsquo;s DMs, and, like, 24 hours has gone by, and they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t even seen it, like, I&rsquo;m still in there requested, I unsend it. Fuck you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not getting that upper hand on me. You&rsquo;re not gonna, I know you saw it, bitch,</p>
<p>because everybody goes through the requested. I know you saw it. You&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna fucking ignore me, and I&rsquo;m not gonna look like no thirsty fuck in your</p>
<p>DMs that, no, you don&rsquo;t get to have me sitting in your DM requests. Sorry, fuck</p>
<p>you. It&rsquo;s not happening. But I, that&rsquo;s how important it is to me if I slide in</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s DMs. I&rsquo;m watching for them to reply. So if someone is sending, like,</p>
<p>multiple DMs, and they&rsquo;re not unsending their DM that they get ignored by,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sending too fucking many to keep up with, red flag. I hope all that made</p>
<p>sense, because I just went five different directions, but if you get it, you get it.</p>
<p>Oh, one more I need to add really quick about the phone. If someone has a lot of</p>
<p>unopened text messages, I just, I need to calm myself down, because this one</p>
<p>makes me so fucking mad. First thing I have to say, it doesn&rsquo;t give you anxious,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make you anxiety, like, seeing all the unopened messages, you, like, it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fuck with you, see the red badge with all the numbers, but I&rsquo;m talking to</p>
<p>people that have, like, over a hundred. Like, babe, what the fuck is going on? And</p>
<p>some people like to use the excuse, oh, it&rsquo;s just a group chat. Motherfucker,</p>
<p>open it. Be active in the group chat. Why are you in a group chat that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>active in, you nosy bitch? You&rsquo;re just reading everybody&rsquo;s messages? Clearly not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just letting it stack up on your phone. But I have two, like, bones to pick</p>
<p>with this shit. People that have a bunch of unopened texts because they think it</p>
<p>looks cool to have a lot of unopened texts, like, people are trying to get at</p>
<p>them. Bitch, you&rsquo;re nobody, okay? You&rsquo;re fucking rude, and nobody actually wants</p>
<p>to talk to you, because all you do is leave people on delivered, so that you</p>
<p>can have an extra number on your messages. I don&rsquo;t fuck with that shit.</p>
<p>That is childish, and that&rsquo;s fucking ugly when you look at your phone and you</p>
<p>have the little badge right there. I don&rsquo;t like that. I open my messages when</p>
<p>I fucking get them. If I&rsquo;m on my phone, I&rsquo;ll respond. If I don&rsquo;t respond, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not on my phone. I don&rsquo;t care about looking anxious to respond. Like,</p>
<p>bitch, if I want to talk to you, I&rsquo;m gonna talk to you. So if I&rsquo;m on my phone, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>reply. I don&rsquo;t play the whole waiting game when it comes to messaging. Sometimes,</p>
<p>okay? I&rsquo;ll be honest. Like, sometimes I&rsquo;ll do it, but most of the time, I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>straight the fuck up. Like, I&rsquo;ll text you if I want to text you, and if I&rsquo;m on my</p>
<p>phone, I&rsquo;m responding. But these people with all these unopened texts, you got</p>
<p>some kind of fucking shit misfiring in your brain for you to think that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s annoying, I don&rsquo;t like you if you do that, that&rsquo;s a red flag for friendships,</p>
<p>and for dating. Don&rsquo;t fuck with nobody that has like hundreds of unopened texts.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re messy, they&rsquo;re unorganized, they don&rsquo;t care who they&rsquo;re ignoring, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>inconsiderate, they&rsquo;re gonna leave you undelivered. Like, that shit pisses me the</p>
<p>fuck off. You leave me on red before you leave me undelivered, you fucking rat. If</p>
<p>you have your fucking red receipts on, you leave me on red. I don&rsquo;t play with me</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing. Oh, you&rsquo;re gonna pretend I didn&rsquo;t see your message. Well, bitch, now</p>
<p>I blocked you. So, did you see that? Huh. Oh, I do have one more for social media,</p>
<p>but it slides into my next topic. So, like, a vehicle. If someone has too many</p>
<p>posts with their car, or they post, like, leaned up, posing with their car, what the</p>
<p>fuck are you doing? Like, why? Like, post a picture of your car and be done with it.</p>
<p>But why are you, like, posing up against your fucking car in every other picture?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s weird. To me. To me, that&rsquo;s weird. Another red flag when it comes to cars,</p>
<p>if they have a colorful car, any kind of, like, bright-ass colored car, red flag. And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about, like, a cheap beat-up car. Like, if that&rsquo;s all someone</p>
<p>can afford, I get it. I&rsquo;m talking about, like, a nice car. Like, if you have a</p>
<p>normal day-to-day car and it&rsquo;s a bright-ass color, what the fuck are you</p>
<p>doing? And also, if someone has a super nice car, like a Lamborghini, Rolls-Royce,</p>
<p>whatever, if it is some bright-ass color, that&rsquo;s a red flag. So the fact that you</p>
<p>have a really nice car, people are already gonna be looking. I love a</p>
<p>classy-ass black car. I like everything black. I only like black cars. Honestly, I</p>
<p>want to say, if you have any other color car than black as a red flag, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too hard to do, that&rsquo;s gonna offend too many people. But I understand, like, a</p>
<p>white, black, or a gray. I get it. I fucking get it. Maybe, like, a dark, dark</p>
<p>green, a dark, dark blue. Anything that&rsquo;s not, like, look at me, look at me. So my</p>
<p>point with the bougie cars, if you got a really nice fucking car, and, like, people</p>
<p>are already gonna look. So for you to go paint it, like, bright fucking orange, or</p>
<p>yellow, or bright pink, why are you, like, begging for attention that hard? Like,</p>
<p>look at, look at me, look at me, look, look, look, look, look, I&rsquo;m important. Look, look,</p>
<p>everybody, look, I have a nice car, look. Like, that&rsquo;s the vibe your car gives off.</p>
<p>When you have a bright-ass color on a really nice car, that&rsquo;s pick-me. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pick-me as fuck. Like, quit it. Fucking stop. Honestly, in my opinion, when you have</p>
<p>a really, really nice car, you have two color options. Black or matte black. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it. Everything else is too try-hard. Oh my god, the next one just made me, like,</p>
<p>seize a little. If they have their Instagram or social media at, like, on</p>
<p>their car somewhere, like, typically it&rsquo;s on a back windshield. Like, there&rsquo;s these</p>
<p>fucking faggots in my town that, they&rsquo;re straight, but I call straight men that do</p>
<p>stupid-ass shit faggots. I call everybody a faggot. That&rsquo;s just a funny word to me.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t use it to, like, call a gay dude gay. Like, I mean, I do, but, like, I</p>
<p>use faggot for everybody. These straight fucking guys, like, with their big lifted</p>
<p>trucks, have their, like, Instagram at on the back of their window, like, the back</p>
<p>windshield. What are you doing, bitch? Like, what the fuck are you doing? I guess</p>
<p>that just goes back to my whole, like, privacy thing. When I&rsquo;m on the road, my</p>
<p>car is all black. There is no, like, defining characteristics about my car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a blacked-out car. I don&rsquo;t like people to know who I am. I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>people to know, like, that&rsquo;s me. You know, I don&rsquo;t like a target on my back, but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s me and my own paranoia. But these motherfuckers posting their at on their</p>
<p>car, red flag. Stay away from them. Okay, my last one about cars is if someone</p>
<p>wears the merch for their car, like a Mercedes t-shirt or a Mercedes hat or,</p>
<p>like, a Ferrari shirt and a Ferrari hat, babe, just drive the fucking car. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to wear the clothes, too. Why? Like, that&rsquo;s just so fucking stupid and</p>
<p>tacky to me. Next one before I get mad. Let&rsquo;s move on to tattoos, okay? These</p>
<p>are all of my tattoo red flags. Most of them are self-explanatory, but I will go</p>
<p>into them. My first three, they are the absolute fuck-no&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>Sagittarius. That&rsquo;s the one sign I will take zero chances with. I don&rsquo;t give a</p>
<p>fuck. Like, astrology is fun and Sagittarius is just the one sign I, that</p>
<p>is my absolute no. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. Sorry. Like, I&rsquo;m talking about dating. Like,</p>
<p>friends, fine. Keep them under glass. So my first three tattoos are kind of like</p>
<p>that. So I don&rsquo;t care. There, there could be, like, an exception to it, but these</p>
<p>first three are my absolute fuck-no&rsquo;s. Then the rest are just like, eh, red flag,</p>
<p>watch out. Like, fucking look deeper into that, you know? So the first three, if they</p>
<p>have a tree or forest tattoo, and you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Typically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the forearm. Like, that fucking twilight looking dark, just forest. Like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just trees, and it&rsquo;s just black ink. What the fuck are you doing? That reveals</p>
<p>so much about this person. It&rsquo;s self-explanatory. Next, if they have any</p>
<p>type of clock or timepiece on them. Self-explanatory. If they have any sort of</p>
<p>compass on them, run. Those three tattoos, if they have any of those, run the fuck</p>
<p>away. And if you don&rsquo;t get it, you don&rsquo;t get it. You&rsquo;re gonna have to go interact</p>
<p>with a few of them to understand why I&rsquo;m saying this. Okay, my other tattoo red</p>
<p>flags are praying hands. Self-explanatory. A cross or a rosary, and those kind of</p>
<p>tie into the God is greater than me or the he is greater than I tattoos. Like,</p>
<p>God is greater than the highs and lows and shit. If they got anything like that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s trauma there. Next, if they have a thigh tattoo, and I&rsquo;m talking the trendy</p>
<p>ones from TikTok, like the fucking, just right across the thigh, okay? I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>talking about, like, a giant picture that&rsquo;s, like, their whole quad. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking just the little thigh tattoo that sticks out of these boys&rsquo; little,</p>
<p>like, five-inch seam shorts. Like, you get what I mean. The TikTok boys. Another one</p>
<p>from the TikTok trends is a snake or a butterfly. Self-explanatory. If they have</p>
<p>their birthday or their birth here tattooed on them, the judgment is flawed.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t run from them. That&rsquo;s just a weird one to me. Like, bitch, you wanted a tattoo that</p>
<p>bad, you just didn&rsquo;t have nothing to give, so you got your own birthday. What the</p>
<p>hell? Okay, if they have the word loyalty tattooed on them or the word respect, oh</p>
<p>my god, that, that kind of goes up there. That might be with the, with the three,</p>
<p>like, the absolute fuck knows. That one might be in there. No, it&rsquo;s okay. Everyone</p>
<p>can, everyone has a chance, except those first three I talked about. That one, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see, okay? Maybe they did time and they got it in prison, who knows, whatever. The</p>
<p>next one, antlers or any kind of deer tattooed on them, and I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>the hicks, the rednecks that get that stupid-ass shit, or, like, a fishing hook.</p>
<p>What? I&rsquo;m not gonna go further. I&rsquo;m not gonna bully them because that&rsquo;s too easy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna just go to the next one, okay? If they have some kind of designer brand</p>
<p>tattooed on them, like Gucci, or Versace, or fucking Louis Vuitton, what are you</p>
<p>doing? What the fuck are you doing? I just keep hearing Azealia Banks in my head.</p>
<p>What the fuck are you doing? Like, that&rsquo;s all I have to say about that one. Like, a</p>
<p>designer logo or a name, babe. Babe, no. No, babes, no. Okay, now moving on to my</p>
<p>random list of red flags. So these are in no fucking order, no rhyme or reason, just</p>
<p>random shit to look out for. If someone uses the phrase or terms alpha and beta</p>
<p>seriously, like if they genuinely use those terms in a serious manner, no,</p>
<p>absolutely not. If someone is friends with all of their exes. I understand being friends with, like,</p>
<p>one ex, okay? If you&rsquo;re gonna date me, you&rsquo;re not gonna be in contact with any of your fucking</p>
<p>exes. Sorry about it. If you don&rsquo;t like it, leave. Friends with all of their exes is kind of a red</p>
<p>flag. Like, you got a problem with, like, cutting people off and commitment because you can&rsquo;t commit</p>
<p>to leave them behind and in the past. So that&rsquo;s just a red flag for me. And one that ties in with</p>
<p>that is someone that has a pet with an ex and still wants to see it. Like, if they have split</p>
<p>custody of, like, a fucking pet, that&rsquo;s weird. That&rsquo;s fucking stupid. No, that&rsquo;s a red flag.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s self-explanatory why that is exposing someone&rsquo;s judgment as fucked. And speaking of the</p>
<p>pet thing, if someone is too in love with their pet, like, some people are so obsessed with their</p>
<p>dog, like, they treat it like a human. And I&rsquo;m like, I love animals. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I will never</p>
<p>mistreat an animal. I&rsquo;m always for, like, being sweet to them. I love an animal. But some people</p>
<p>take it too far. Like, some people are so obsessed with their dogs that, like, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>to me. And that&rsquo;s a red flag. Like, stop it. That&rsquo;s fucking weird. Okay. How they treat wait</p>
<p>staff or any type of customer service personnel. If they talk down to anyone that is in customer</p>
<p>service, they&rsquo;re a fucking piece of shit. If they try to, like, if they treat them with anything less</p>
<p>than basic consideration and, like, respect, they can eat a fucking dick and die. Okay? That&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>opinion across the board. If a wait staff is rude to me, bitch, I&rsquo;m gonna be rude back. But if</p>
<p>someone just out the gate is rude for no reason just because someone works in customer service,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the worst type of person there is, to be honest. And what ties in with that is tipping. If</p>
<p>they tip like shit, don&rsquo;t fuck with them. And I will head back to, like, the whole loving the</p>
<p>animals too much because I do have one about how people treat animals. You need to watch the way</p>
<p>that people treat animals and pets. Because if something is fully dependent on them, and they</p>
<p>act annoyed by it, that&rsquo;s a red flag. If they act annoyed by their pet, if they act like their pet</p>
<p>is an inconvenience, knowing that it is fully dependent on them, and they signed up for that</p>
<p>when they fucking got it, that&rsquo;s how they will be to kids. So if you&rsquo;re thinking about having kids</p>
<p>with someone, look at how they treat their pets. Also, if someone is gonna, like, mistreat or</p>
<p>neglect a pet that is fully dependent on them, that&rsquo;s a red flag. They&rsquo;re very disconnected.</p>
<p>If something can&rsquo;t meet a need for itself, you have to take care of it. Like, yeah, you can,</p>
<p>like, mope and whine and be, like, be annoyed by it sometimes. But if that&rsquo;s, like, a consistent</p>
<p>trend where they&rsquo;re annoyed that the animal has needs, they&rsquo;re gonna act the same way with you.</p>
<p>Next one, bad breath. If someone has bad breath, that&rsquo;s not good. Like, it&rsquo;s not good because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bad breath, sure. But the fact that you can&rsquo;t taste it or smell it yourself, like, you just</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t aware that your breath could potentially stink. I chew gum non-stop. Like, I always have</p>
<p>a piece of fucking gum in my mouth or I have a pack nearby. That&rsquo;s just how I am. I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>conscious about my breath. And if someone is not, and, like, if someone has bad fucking breath and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just gonna kiss you, like, before I kiss anyone ever, I make sure my breath is good. Like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll eat a piece of gum or I&rsquo;ll take a shot of rumple. Like, there&rsquo;s ways to make sure your</p>
<p>breath is good, even if you don&rsquo;t have gum or, like, mints. Like, bitch. Or don&rsquo;t kiss them.</p>
<p>Or don&rsquo;t get in their face and talk close to them. Back the fuck up. Like,</p>
<p>someone that&rsquo;s just not aware that their breath could be a problem, that&rsquo;s a red flag.</p>
<p>Okay, remember when I talked about people that have tons of jobs in their Instagram bios? So,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t about Instagram or, like, social media. This is just about real life. If they have a lot</p>
<p>of LLCs and they claim to have opened a lot of businesses and they have all this shit that they</p>
<p>do, bitch, why do you have so many LLCs? Why do you have so many, like, things opened up? You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>own a business just because you have an LLC. Like, you did some paperwork. There&rsquo;s no actual, like,</p>
<p>business going on. You don&rsquo;t have, like, a place of work. You know what I mean? Like,</p>
<p>I mean, technically, on paper, it&rsquo;s like a business. It&rsquo;s a registered business. I get it.</p>
<p>But if you have a bunch and they just have them and they, like, brag about them,</p>
<p>bitch, you&rsquo;re not actually, like, working or doing anything with these things. You&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>saying you&rsquo;re an entrepreneur and have all these businesses. They&rsquo;re not operating. They&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>functioning. You&rsquo;re filing zero on your tax returns, bitch. What are you doing? You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to brag about that. That&rsquo;s embarrassing. Red flag. So the next one, if someone is a recovering</p>
<p>addict and them being sober is their entire personality, that&rsquo;s a red fucking flag. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most annoying fucking shit to be around because I have friends that are addicts and</p>
<p>are dealing with sobriety and all that and they don&rsquo;t make it their whole personality.</p>
<p>If you want an example of this, Jersey Shore, Mike the Situation, how when he got sober,</p>
<p>it turned into his entire personality. Everything about him was about being sober. Like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking exhausting. It&rsquo;s annoying. Shut up. Go find something else to have be interesting</p>
<p>about you because I swear that&rsquo;s not the serve you think it is. It&rsquo;s not as exciting and, like,</p>
<p>riveting to people as you think it is. It might be to you, but everybody&rsquo;s annoyed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not shaming addicts. I&rsquo;m not shaming people that are sober. I&rsquo;m shaming the people</p>
<p>that make it their entire personality trait. If you didn&rsquo;t get that, you didn&rsquo;t get it. All right,</p>
<p>whatever. Speaking of Jersey Shore, if someone has not seen Jersey Shore, that&rsquo;s a red flag.</p>
<p>Sorry. That&rsquo;s that raised me. That show raised me. And if you haven&rsquo;t seen Jersey Shore,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a certain element of your personality that&rsquo;s not developed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get the jokes. When I go running around the club and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the beach? Like out of fucking nowhere. We&rsquo;re nowhere near a beach. I don&rsquo;t want you</p>
<p>being like, huh? I want you yelling. I&rsquo;m a good person. Get off. Get the fuck off. Like,</p>
<p>when Snooki got arrested and she&rsquo;s yelling at the cops, I want you to yell a quote at me back.</p>
<p>Like, I deadass when I&rsquo;m out with my friends. Who&rsquo;s your fat friend? Like, we yell at each</p>
<p>other. This Jersey Shore quotes. People think we&rsquo;re fighting all the time because when I</p>
<p>yell at my girlfriend, who&rsquo;s your fat friend in the club? Like, people don&rsquo;t fucking get it.</p>
<p>And then she&rsquo;ll yell back at me. You don&rsquo;t even look at Sally and you fuck like we just Jersey</p>
<p>Shore back and forth. And you just do quotes back. It&rsquo;s so fun. And if you don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m sorry, you&rsquo;re missing out. If you weren&rsquo;t raised by Jersey Shore, red flag.</p>
<p>If whiskey is someone&rsquo;s drink of choice, self explanatory. If someone cannot take a pill,</p>
<p>like swallow a pill, you are past 13 years old and you can&rsquo;t take a pill.</p>
<p>Mmm, some character development has been lacked there.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t trust that motherfucker. Baby talk. Self explanatory, self fucking explanatory. If you are</p>
<p>an adult, and you baby talk to other grown ass people, go to hell. Go to fucking hell. Go to</p>
<p>the middle of hell. Okay, this one&rsquo;s kind of personal, but it makes sense. If someone doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>use what wipes when they shit, I do. I haven&rsquo;t never not use what wipes like if I&rsquo;m ever out</p>
<p>somewhere and I have to use toilet paper. I&rsquo;m like sad about it. That&rsquo;s fucking disgusting.</p>
<p>Like use what wipes clean your fucking ass. This boy gave me an analogy a long time ago,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never forgot it. He was like, if you get shit on your arm, like on your skin,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just gonna grab some toilet paper, like paper and wipe it off and be like, Oh,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good. I just wiped it off. It&rsquo;s fine. No, you&rsquo;re gonna want to wash it. You&rsquo;re gonna want</p>
<p>to like, clean it the fuck off. So it&rsquo;s the same thing with your asshole. Like it&rsquo;s still skin back</p>
<p>there. Don&rsquo;t just throw a piece of paper on it and think that&rsquo;s fine. Like a wet wipe is as close</p>
<p>as you can get to like washing your ass. So use a fucking wet wipe. That&rsquo;s weird. Okay, next red</p>
<p>flag. If they do some sort of substance every single day, like they smoke pot every day,</p>
<p>multiple times a day. They do hard drugs every that&rsquo;s duh, like fucking dove at the hard drug.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re doing some kind of substance, every single fucking day, whether it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking today, they&rsquo;re smoking tomorrow, they&rsquo;re doing coke the next day. It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>constantly doing something, that&rsquo;s a red flag for me. Like you have no day when you just have</p>
<p>nothing in you. Nothing altering your mood and your mind. That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s weird. That&rsquo;s a red flag</p>
<p>to me. You can&rsquo;t sit with yourself. You can&rsquo;t just be Okay, next red flag is near and dear to my</p>
<p>heart. If someone is soo happy. Like they get in a car accident and they look at it as an</p>
<p>opportunity to sue someone and get money. If you&rsquo;re not actually hurt, don&rsquo;t fucking sue nobody.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some pussy shit. And I hate that also goes in line with this a cop caller. If a motherfucker</p>
<p>is first reaction for everything is to call the cops. Don&rsquo;t come near me. Don&rsquo;t fucking be near</p>
<p>me. You&rsquo;re weak. I don&rsquo;t fuck with that shit. I don&rsquo;t like no cop caller. Okay, self explanatory.</p>
<p>So the next red flag kind of goes with that if they&rsquo;re against violence, or they&rsquo;re scared of</p>
<p>guns. Like if you don&rsquo;t understand that, like violence, you need to be prepared for it. Like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just be like a powder puff your whole life. And just be like, No, you should never hit</p>
<p>anyone. Oh my god, like violence is bad. Like bitch, I agree. Violence is not good. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever like to have to get violent when I do. But sometimes you just got to hit somebody. And I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want nobody around me that&rsquo;s going to be like chicken shit and scared when that happens.</p>
<p>I need someone that&rsquo;s gonna stand the fuck up and have my back. You know, like we&rsquo;re not gonna go</p>
<p>out looking for fights. But if something happens, I need to know that you got me. I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>feel like I have some like puppy next to me. I have to defend in the middle of a fight because</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t defend yourself like bitch, you need to be right up there with me. We need to be like</p>
<p>in this together. I don&rsquo;t need to feel like I have a toddler next to me. I need to protect like be</p>
<p>grown. Oh, next one. Someone that does not stand behind what they say someone that backtracks when</p>
<p>they say something. If you&rsquo;re gonna be fucking bold, and talk some shit, or say something,</p>
<p>stand behind it. Own it. If you&rsquo;re gonna say some shit, own it. Because when I get in your fucking</p>
<p>face, and I tell you to repeat yourself and you start stuttering, I&rsquo;m hitting you anyway,</p>
<p>because fuck you. And that goes with talking about other people too. Like, when I talk about people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very bold in what I say, because I&rsquo;m never wrong. If I say something about somebody and</p>
<p>you perceive it as talking shit, I&rsquo;m not talking shit. It&rsquo;s a fact. Whatever I&rsquo;m saying is true,</p>
<p>or I wouldn&rsquo;t be saying it because I&rsquo;m the type person. I will stand behind what I say. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>prepared at any moment for someone to confront me about what I&rsquo;m saying. So when I speak, I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>like strategic with it. And I&rsquo;m very sure of what I&rsquo;m saying before I go run my mouth. Because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna stand there and own it. And if I&rsquo;m gonna have to stand there and own something, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna say no stupid shit. Like, you know, those friends that like talk this and that, and then</p>
<p>they get called out by the other friend? And they&rsquo;re like, no, I didn&rsquo;t say that. Bitch, yeah, I did.</p>
<p>And what? I get being like, yeah, I shouldn&rsquo;t have said it. I feel bad that I said it. But</p>
<p>you look like a fucking bozo. You look like a clown. Ew. Okay, next one is natural long nails.</p>
<p>So girls that have long nails, and they&rsquo;re their natural nails, like, you know how they have that,</p>
<p>like that yellow tint. And they&rsquo;re like, not clean and pretty. They look fucking like little</p>
<p>witchy finger. They&rsquo;re gross. Like if someone has naturally long nails, ew, acrylics are fine.</p>
<p>I love a long acrylic. But you know what I&rsquo;m talking about? It just gives like librarian,</p>
<p>assistant teacher vibes. And I&rsquo;m talking unpainted. If they&rsquo;re painted, they&rsquo;re acceptable</p>
<p>sometimes, like as long as you can&rsquo;t tell their natural nails, you&rsquo;re fine. But the bitches that</p>
<p>have like the unpainted, unkept just naturally long fingernails. What the fuck, dude, like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just gross. I was talking about girls with that. But especially guys, if a guy has long nails,</p>
<p>like naturally, ew, make sure they&rsquo;re fucking clean and kept or just get acrylics. You fucking</p>
<p>faggot. Just do it right. If you&rsquo;re gonna do it, do it right. Don&rsquo;t do no nasty fucking raggedy shit.</p>
<p>Oh, another thing about boys with the whole painted nails thing. Guys that paint their</p>
<p>fucking nails. And I&rsquo;m talking about the guys that are like masculine. I&rsquo;m not talking about</p>
<p>the twinkie little feminine acting guys like paint your nails on the fuck, go get your acrylics.</p>
<p>But these guys on TikTok that have recently gotten to the trend of painting their nails,</p>
<p>like they look straight, they present straight, but they got painted nails.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not personally for me. I don&rsquo;t like it. But the thing that pisses me off with it is when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s chipped. Like I said, if you&rsquo;re gonna do it, do it. Don&rsquo;t look fucking nasty. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna paint your nails, make sure they look good. I don&rsquo;t like that chipped, nasty fucking nail</p>
<p>polish like, ew, that&rsquo;s gross. Dude, you look dirty. Now. You look fucking dirty. You thought</p>
<p>you were being cute and quirky with your painted nails, bro. But now you look fucking dirty and</p>
<p>dusty. And no girl is gonna want you digging up in her fucking pussy with some chipped nail polish.</p>
<p>No, take it off, fix it and make it perfect or fucking take it off. One that kind of goes with</p>
<p>this is if someone has no skincare routine. So if they don&rsquo;t have like a certain few steps that</p>
<p>they do, even if they don&rsquo;t do it all the time, because I don&rsquo;t do my skincare routine all the</p>
<p>time. I don&rsquo;t have the energy sometimes I just fucking do a like a face wash and I fucking</p>
<p>throw moisturizer on and I&rsquo;m like enough. I don&rsquo;t tone every fucking night. I don&rsquo;t care. But if</p>
<p>someone doesn&rsquo;t have like any sort of rhyme or reason to like a skincare routine, red flag.</p>
<p>If someone wears Converse, they&rsquo;re a really popular shoe just like Vans. Vans are a red flag.</p>
<p>No ifs, ands or buts. Converse, they&rsquo;re not really that much of a red flag, but the all black</p>
<p>Converse are our red flag. Do not trust a motherfucker that rocks some all black Converse.</p>
<p>The black and the white. All right, they&rsquo;re doable. But the all black ones, no bitch run for the</p>
<p>hills. Okay, if someone is greedy with food, I&rsquo;m Albanian, so I&rsquo;m kind of jaded with that. But if</p>
<p>someone is greedy with food, that&rsquo;s the most unattractive fucking shit. Like I want to feed</p>
<p>everybody I want to make sure everybody ate. I&rsquo;m not a cheap ass when it comes to food. Like I</p>
<p>like to just make sure everybody&rsquo;s good. And if someone is greedy with food, that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>disgusting. I don&rsquo;t like that. If someone cannot hit a beat, or if they have no rhythm, I know some</p>
<p>people can&rsquo;t dance, but you understand how to like nod to a beat. You can like nod to a beat,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fine. I&rsquo;m talking about the motherfuckers that can&rsquo;t even do that. If someone has no rhythm</p>
<p>in their body, and they can&rsquo;t like bop to a beat even like that&rsquo;s just a red flag to me because it</p>
<p>means like they&rsquo;re not in touch with their body. And if they&rsquo;re not in touch with their body,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know how to use it. And that goes into my next one. If someone can&rsquo;t kiss,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a red flag. It means they can&rsquo;t fuck because if you can&rsquo;t kiss, you can&rsquo;t do nothing</p>
<p>else. That is the biggest red flag. If someone has no rhythm, and or they can&rsquo;t kiss, because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much disconnection with them in their own body. They don&rsquo;t know how to work it. They</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how to move it. Like if you can&rsquo;t kiss, you can&rsquo;t do nothing else. Sorry. It&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>Okay, I know y&rsquo;all are gonna get real mad. But this is just my personal opinion. If someone has</p>
<p>a septum piercing or a septum or like a nose ring that hangs like a bull, I&rsquo;m sorry, we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna move past that one really quick because I know a lot of you guys have those. That&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a red flag for me personally, because there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack there. And I&rsquo;m not gonna unpack it</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want everyone to unfollow me. That&rsquo;s one fight I&rsquo;m not willing to have yet</p>
<p>maybe in a couple years when this trend dies out. But right now I&rsquo;m gonna shut the fuck up on that.</p>
<p>Okay, this next one. If you get it, you get it. If someone wears a Gucci belt.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking any kind of Gucci belt. I&rsquo;m talking the one with the two big gold G&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right at the front. The little ones are fine, I guess. But if they have the big G belt,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a guy and he is tucking his shirt in, and the Gucci belt is the focal point of his</p>
<p>fucking outfit, that&rsquo;s a red flag. That&rsquo;s a fucking loser. If they are trying so hard to</p>
<p>show off their belt. That&rsquo;s weird. That&rsquo;s weird behavior. Okay, just wear your belt. And fucking</p>
<p>shut up. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be your whole personality for the night. And honestly, that</p>
<p>belt is so over with it&rsquo;s so done with, like it&rsquo;s so far overdone past the point. It&rsquo;s not even a</p>
<p>classic Gucci piece anymore. Like it&rsquo;s just that overdone fucking one. You know, it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>never full for Louis Vuitton. It&rsquo;s gross. When people see bitches with a never full Louis Vuitton</p>
<p>bag. They&rsquo;re not like, Oh my god, she has a Louis bag. It&rsquo;s like, Oh, she has a fucking never full.</p>
<p>Like it shouldn&rsquo;t even be considered a Louis bag anymore. And a Gucci belt with the two gold G&rsquo;s</p>
<p>should not be considered a Gucci belt. Like it&rsquo;s just fucking gross. Like that&rsquo;s my opinion. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry if you have one I used to have one I would wear it. And I&rsquo;m only able to speak to you about</p>
<p>this because I&rsquo;ve been through it. They&rsquo;re tacky. Okay, now there are three jobs, I guess you could</p>
<p>say that I&rsquo;m gonna say our red flag. If someone is a cop, red flag if someone is a nurse, red flag,</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m a nurse, but still bitch red flag, I can give credit where credit&rsquo;s due. It doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>apply across the board. It&rsquo;s not fully everybody. There&rsquo;s always a good apple in the bad bunch,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure. But for the most part, steer clear, cops, nurses and military. I said it. I sure</p>
<p>as fuck did. And not all military are bad. Not all cops are bad. Not all nurses are bad.</p>
<p>But motherfucking red flag look deeper with that shit. Because military boys, every single one of</p>
<p>them is emotionally stunted. They&rsquo;re not aware. They&rsquo;re the they&rsquo;re like worse than frat boys.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re married after meeting a bitch for two fucking weeks. They always got a Mustang</p>
<p>or a Camaro. Like no, just no, no, just look deeper. Okay, because you might find the good</p>
<p>one out of the bunch. But bitch, you got to hunt for him because especially a gay in the military.</p>
<p>If a gay guy is in the know, bitch, absolutely not. I&rsquo;ve had my fair share. I have not met a</p>
<p>single one. That is the slightest mentally bit sane, bitch. No, absolutely not. If you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with that, that&rsquo;s fine. You can have your opinion and I can&rsquo;t. Okay, so the last few red</p>
<p>flags is probably like 10 left. They&rsquo;re gonna be a lot deeper. So this other shit was a little</p>
<p>more superficial. And these are things that you&rsquo;re gonna have to like read into. If you experience</p>
<p>them. First one out the gate. If someone says I love you before three months, red flag. And if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand why you got to go through it. So go have fun. You will end up in therapy.</p>
<p>If someone instantly talks about sex, like that is their first approach at you is sexualizing you</p>
<p>or commenting on something sexual. That&rsquo;s a red flag. Very, very big red flag. I&rsquo;ve touched on</p>
<p>this kind of in a lot of my episodes about value and shit. And the one about dating apps, just</p>
<p>trust me, it&rsquo;s a red flag. I&rsquo;ll do a whole episode on hookup culture that&rsquo;s going to come soon.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really gonna dive into that. But just know if someone&rsquo;s first fucking like interaction</p>
<p>with you is sexual, steer clear. Okay, if someone doesn&rsquo;t have an iPhone, I saved this for the</p>
<p>serious section because that&rsquo;s kind of serious, like, androids and anything that&rsquo;s not an iPhone,</p>
<p>they just look messy. Like I&rsquo;m sorry, like you&rsquo;re allowed to have one if you like it. My best friend</p>
<p>Genevieve has a fucking Android and she has since high school. Like I have fought with this bitch</p>
<p>every year since we were 16. About getting an iPhone, she won&rsquo;t. She just likes her little</p>
<p>Android galaxy, whatever the hell she&rsquo;s got. I don&rsquo;t know the name of it. But I&rsquo;ve always been</p>
<p>an iPhone person. I like the way it looks. I think it&rsquo;s pretty. But I just don&rsquo;t like the look of</p>
<p>Android phones. And there&rsquo;s no iMessage. There&rsquo;s no red receipts. There&rsquo;s no delivered. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>green fucking text. I don&rsquo;t like it. And for someone to like that type of phone, their judgment</p>
<p>is flawed. I&rsquo;m sorry, Genevieve. I love you. And for everybody else that has a fucking Android.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the truth. And you know, you can&rsquo;t fight it. You&rsquo;re mad because you can&rsquo;t fight it.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t think I fucking hate you just because you don&rsquo;t have an iPhone. It&rsquo;s fine. Have whatever</p>
<p>phone you want. I just think it&rsquo;s a little bit of a red flag. And of course, I&rsquo;m not making fun</p>
<p>of people that can&rsquo;t afford an iPhone, bitch. Don&rsquo;t try to make me a fucking dick. That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m talking about. Because honestly, I wish we could just go back to having razors like that</p>
<p>was the best fucking phone little flip phone, a little mind your fucking business snap that</p>
<p>fucker shut when you&rsquo;re done and you&rsquo;re mad like you get to prove your little attitude</p>
<p>snapping your phone shit. Ah, I wish we could go back to like flip phones. I swear.</p>
<p>Okay, next one is someone is divorced before the age of 25. Babe, whether they were the problem,</p>
<p>or they dated someone that was the problem, their judgment. If they got married before 25,</p>
<p>their judgment and decision making abilities and skills are undeveloped, not undeveloped,</p>
<p>underdeveloped. Okay, just a red flag. Just keep that in the back of your head.</p>
<p>Leo on his podcast saying if they&rsquo;re divorced by 25 bing bing bing red flag, bitch.</p>
<p>Okay, the fattest red flag of them all is if they send you a picture of their self crying.</p>
<p>Under no fucking circumstance. Should you ever send a picture or a video of yourself crying to</p>
<p>somebody? Now I&rsquo;m not talking about posting a little story of like you being sad. Okay,</p>
<p>do it. Don&rsquo;t be excessive with it. All right. Don&rsquo;t be fucking annoying. But you should under</p>
<p>no circumstances ever in your life, send a picture or video of yourself crying to the</p>
<p>person that made you cry. No, big fat fuck. No. If you do that, unfollow me unsubscribe from my</p>
<p>podcast. Do not ever they don&rsquo;t associate don&rsquo;t associate yourself with me, bitch.</p>
<p>Like none of my followers. Actually, I&rsquo;m confident none of my followers do that because</p>
<p>no, like if you like me, your brain works a certain way. And we&rsquo;re not sending pictures</p>
<p>of ourselves crying to people bitch. Like that is so embarrassing. Do you not have any ego?</p>
<p>Do you have no ego at all, bitch? For like, you&rsquo;re giving someone that much ammunition on you?</p>
<p>Uh, no, no red flag. That&rsquo;s the biggest red flag out of this entire podcast, I think.</p>
<p>Okay, this next one is something that makes me cut people off nonstop. And like very quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sudden and consistency. So if things have been going a certain way, and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>they flip or change it with no explanation, red fucking flag. So if you&rsquo;re texting with someone,</p>
<p>and you text every day for a week, and you text all day, there&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a little routine.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re in a routine with someone, and you&rsquo;re doing this, and then all of a sudden,</p>
<p>they stop, they stop that routine. And when I act like nothing happened, that&rsquo;s a fucking issue.</p>
<p>Like my best analogy is like if you have a gym buddy, so you go to the gym every day with your</p>
<p>friend at 10am. So every day you two go to the gym, and you work out together. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been going to the gym together for a month, and you just know you meet at that time, and you work</p>
<p>out, and then you&rsquo;re done. And then one day you show up, and they just don&rsquo;t come. And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just gone. Like, that&rsquo;s sudden inconsistency. And then it&rsquo;s like them showing up the next day,</p>
<p>at 10am, and acting like nothing happened. Bitch, what the fuck? Where the fuck were you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to give no explanation? You just want to walk in like nothing just happened?</p>
<p>Like, fuck you. No, you&rsquo;re very unaware. If someone does that, they&rsquo;re extremely unaware.</p>
<p>Sudden inconsistency. That means they&rsquo;re not even aware enough to be able to be considerate</p>
<p>of the way that you feel, and how it could be perceived for them to just all of a sudden be</p>
<p>inconsistent. So that&rsquo;s a fat red flag. Okay, my next red flag is something that I do, and I hate</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m about to call myself out on it. But I need to be able to warn everybody. But it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to bite me in the ass with the people in my life. Once I warn you about it, is if someone is always</p>
<p>FaceTiming you, like out of the blue, randomly FaceTiming you all the fucking time. And even if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not all the time, but they just randomly will start FaceTiming you. They&rsquo;re checking where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at. Okay? So if you&rsquo;re going to cheat on somebody, you don&rsquo;t want them rolling up on you. So you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to call them FaceTime and pretend like you&rsquo;re just saying, Hi, how are you? How&rsquo;s your day? Yada</p>
<p>yada. You&rsquo;re going to have some bullshit conversation. What you&rsquo;re really doing is checking where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at. Are they at work? Are they driving somewhere? Where are they headed? What are they</p>
<p>doing? What are their plans? You know what I mean? Like you&rsquo;re checking to keep up with where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at and what they&rsquo;re doing. So that&rsquo;s just an example. Like if you&rsquo;re going to cheat on somebody,</p>
<p>you need to check where the fuck they&rsquo;re at. So if someone is FaceTiming you out of the blue,</p>
<p>they could be cheating. They might be trying to figure out where you&rsquo;re at so they don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>caught. I&rsquo;m not saying always, I&rsquo;m just saying, look at that. Like that might be a red flag.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons that I FaceTime people randomly is I&rsquo;m seeing where the fuck you&rsquo;re at,</p>
<p>because I want to see if you&rsquo;re lying to me about where you&rsquo;re at. So if I just FaceTime you out of</p>
<p>the fucking blue, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m checking. Because if you told me you were going out with</p>
<p>so-and-so or you were doing something that night and I didn&rsquo;t believe you, whether it&rsquo;s a friend or</p>
<p>someone I&rsquo;m interested in, I&rsquo;m calling you to find that out. I don&rsquo;t like being fucking lied to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust people for shit. So that&rsquo;s just something that I do is I just FaceTime people</p>
<p>out of the fucking blue. It&rsquo;s usually a test. Okay, sometimes. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a test with me.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m dating you or I&rsquo;m about to start dating you, it&rsquo;s a thousand percent a test.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just calling you because I want to talk to you, bitch. I&rsquo;ll just show up where you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>if I want to see you. But if I&rsquo;m calling you, bitch, I&rsquo;m checking. I&rsquo;m taking notes and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>checking where the fuck you&rsquo;re at. I&rsquo;m not saying always. I&rsquo;m just saying, look at that. Like that</p>
<p>might be a red flag. Okay, my next one is something I despise. And it&rsquo;s when someone uses their bad</p>
<p>childhood as an excuse for doing some fucked up shit. That&rsquo;s not an excuse because you had a hard</p>
<p>or bad childhood or because your parents didn&rsquo;t love you. It&rsquo;s not an excuse to be a piece of</p>
<p>shit. Grow up. Take accountability. Go to fucking fair. Honestly, go get euthanized.</p>
<p>Okay, next red flag. If someone is going to talk shit about their partner behind their back,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not talking about they&rsquo;re going to their best friend and they&rsquo;re confiding in them about</p>
<p>something and they&rsquo;re just like venting. I&rsquo;m talking if they&rsquo;re with a group of friends</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like dogging the fuck out of their partner. That&rsquo;s a red flag. Whether you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be friends with this person or you&rsquo;re interested in this person. Like if someone comes to you</p>
<p>talking about their partner, and they&rsquo;re talking shit like dogging them and disrespecting them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a red flag. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck what the situation is. Even when you&rsquo;re venting,</p>
<p>you need to watch your fucking mouth about your partner. Your partner is someone you should never</p>
<p>embarrass. You need to keep their sense of respect and like their sense of self in the forefront of</p>
<p>your mind no matter how mad you are. Like there&rsquo;s no excuse to disrespect your partner to other</p>
<p>people if they&rsquo;re going to continue being their your partner. And that&rsquo;s the worst shit is when</p>
<p>someone breaks up. They dog the shit out of their partner and they expose everything they were</p>
<p>dealing with and they get back with them. You look like a dumbass. Okay, if you&rsquo;re going to break up</p>
<p>with somebody, don&rsquo;t run your fucking mouth about them. If there&rsquo;s any chance of you getting back</p>
<p>with them because then you look stupid. Sorry. Okay, next red flag. If someone unprovoked</p>
<p>bullies somebody. So if you&rsquo;re out with your friend or you&rsquo;re out with your partner and</p>
<p>someone walks by you and your partner or your friend just starts like bullying the other person</p>
<p>and like talking shit to them. That&rsquo;s a red flag. You need to check them and you need to leave.</p>
<p>You need to never talk to them again. There&rsquo;s a difference between someone walking by and us like</p>
<p>kicking and like talking shit. But it&rsquo;s a different thing to talk shit to somebody and to</p>
<p>try and be mean to somebody and embarrass them. That&rsquo;s mean. Don&rsquo;t fucking do that. Don&rsquo;t own</p>
<p>provoke just bully somebody. You can talk shit with your friends fine. Don&rsquo;t do it where they</p>
<p>can hear you like be polite and talk behind their back. Okay, have some respect. But be ready to own</p>
<p>whatever the fuck you&rsquo;re saying. Like I said earlier, if you&rsquo;re going to talk shit behind</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s back, be prepared to own it. It&rsquo;s a red flag when someone is just mean to somebody.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that. So one thing that someone can say to you, that&rsquo;s an instant red flag and should</p>
<p>throw you right the fuck off is, well, I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way. Because that right there exposes</p>
<p>that they do not understand why you feel the way you do. They&rsquo;re just judging it. They don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it. They don&rsquo;t get it. Because they&rsquo;re like, well, I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way. Like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dismissive. And that shows that there&rsquo;s a big disconnection. They don&rsquo;t understand your</p>
<p>perspective. And if they&rsquo;re fine, just walking away from a conversation, knowing you&rsquo;re upset</p>
<p>by something and saying, well, I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way. If that&rsquo;s all they have to fucking say,</p>
<p>big disconnect, big red flag, real lack of emotional intelligence and emotional maturity.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t understand why that is so deep, bitch, read a book, read a fucking book,</p>
<p>go learn something. Because that itself, I feel is very self explanatory. But a lot of people say</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re telling me something happened to you, and you feel a certain way, even if I did</p>
<p>something to you, and you&rsquo;re hurt by it, I&rsquo;m not just going to tell you, well, I&rsquo;m sorry you feel</p>
<p>that way. Like, I don&rsquo;t say sorry, we know that. But I&rsquo;m going to try my best to understand where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re coming from. And I&rsquo;m not going to be able to say, well, I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to say, I understand why you feel that way. That&rsquo;s what you can say. That&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>want to hear. You don&rsquo;t want to hear I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way. Like that shit pisses me the</p>
<p>fuck off. I&rsquo;ve heard it from every single person in my life, my entire life. And me and my sister</p>
<p>Beja, we fucking talk shit on everybody that says that that is the most annoying thing. And me and</p>
<p>her don&rsquo;t say that to each other. Like we have both been spit that our entire life. Because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the biggest cop out like, well, I&rsquo;m sorry, like, the person feels like they&rsquo;re apologizing</p>
<p>for something. But they&rsquo;re really not like, Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, you feel that way. That is so invalidating</p>
<p>and like, fuck you. I hate it. I&rsquo;d rather you not say anything. I&rsquo;d rather you shit on my chest.</p>
<p>Okay, that was a little dramatic. I don&rsquo;t want you to actually shit on my chest. But I&rsquo;d rather</p>
<p>you just not say anything and say, Well, I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way. shove that in your fucking</p>
<p>dickhole. Okay, a big red flag for relationships. And someone you&rsquo;re interested in is if you both</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be upset at the same time. So if you&rsquo;re aggravated, or you&rsquo;re upset and hurt by something,</p>
<p>and then they get mad, they try to immediately district credit and like discard the fact that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re upset. Like if they can&rsquo;t hold space for you both to be upset. That&rsquo;s a red flag.</p>
<p>It has to be like one or the other. I don&rsquo;t fuck with that. I don&rsquo;t like that. That translates</p>
<p>into so many things. And I don&rsquo;t have the time to unpack that. That&rsquo;s a fucking two year podcast.</p>
<p>Another one is this someone treats you bad, and then says I love you. If someone treats you like</p>
<p>shit, or does something that actively hurts you, and they keep doing it, and they know that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing something that hurts you. They don&rsquo;t get to say I love you. snatch that word out of their</p>
<p>fucking mouth. They&rsquo;re not allowed to treat you like shit, and then say I love you. That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>love. And then that kind of goes into my next one. And my last point is, if someone thinks that</p>
<p>sacrifice is them showing that they love you, sacrifice is not love. And if someone thinks that</p>
<p>that is a very dangerous person to get involved with, whether it&rsquo;s a friend or a partner,</p>
<p>do not fuck with nobody that thinks that sacrifice means they love you. And sacrificing what they</p>
<p>want is them proving that they love you. That&rsquo;s not love. That&rsquo;s gonna lead to resentment. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking hate you eventually. And then when everything goes wrong, or anything goes wrong in</p>
<p>their life, they&rsquo;re gonna blame you. Well, I fucking gave this up for you. I did this because</p>
<p>of you like it&rsquo;s No, don&rsquo;t just trust me. Just fucking trust me. If you only listen to one thing</p>
<p>I ever say is do not get involved with someone that thinks that sacrifice equals love. That</p>
<p>will ruin you. I&rsquo;m gonna polish it off there. We had our fun, then we got deep. But I&rsquo;m over it.</p>
<p>Like this podcast has me sweating. I&rsquo;m fucking aggravated. Right? Like all these things that we</p>
<p>just went through, y&rsquo;all, you have a new like, guidebook for your life now, if you are trying</p>
<p>to find someone that&rsquo;s aware, because someone aware ain&rsquo;t doing none of this shit. Okay,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re welcome for your new cheat sheet for all the people that you&rsquo;re going to be friends</p>
<p>with or date. Much love. Good luck. Many wishes. I hope you guys enjoyed this episode. If you did</p>
