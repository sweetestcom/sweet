    <p>The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist at Stanford,</p>
<p>working to understand how the brain works, how it can change through experience,</p>
<p>and how to repair brain circuits damaged by injury or disease. He has a great Instagram account</p>
<p>at Huberman Lab where he teaches the world about the brain and the human mind. Also, he&rsquo;s a friend</p>
<p>and an inspiration in that he shows that you can be humble, giving, and still succeed in the</p>
<p>science world. Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>

<p>this podcast. As a side note, let me say that I heard from a lot of people about the previous</p>
<p>conversation I had with Yaron Brook about objectivism. Some people loved it, some people</p>
<p>hated it. I misspoke in some parts, was more critical on occasion than I&rsquo;m meant to be,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t push on certain points that I should&rsquo;ve, was undereducated or completely unaware about</p>
<p>some major things that happened in the past or major ideas out there. I bring all that up to say</p>
<p>that if we are to have difficult conversations, we have to give each other space to make mistakes,</p>
<p>to learn, to grow. Taking one or two statements from a three hour podcast and suggesting that</p>
<p>they encapsulate who I am, I was, or ever will be is a standard that we can&rsquo;t hold each other to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone could live up to that kind of standard, at least I know I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The conversation with Yaron is mild relative to some conversations that I will likely have in</p>
<p>the coming year. Please continue to challenge me, but please try to do so with love and with</p>
<p>patience. I promise to work my ass off to improve. Whether I&rsquo;m successful at that or not, we shall</p>
<p>see. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars on Apple Podcast, follow</p>

<p>conversation with Andrew Huberman. You&rsquo;ve mentioned that in your lab at Stanford, you induce stress by</p>
<p>putting people into a virtual reality and having them go through one of a set of experiences. I</p>
<p>think you mentioned this on Rogan or with Whitney that scare them. So just on a practical, psychological</p>
<p>level, and maybe on a philosophical level, what are people afraid of? What are the fears? What</p>
<p>are these fear experiences that you find to be effective? Yeah, so it depends on the person,</p>
<p>obviously. And we should probably define fear, right? Because you can, without going too far</p>
<p>down the rabbit hole of defining these things, you can&rsquo;t really have fear without stress,</p>
<p>but you could have stress without fear. And you can&rsquo;t really have trauma without fear and stress,</p>
<p>but you could have fear and stress without trauma. So we can start playing the word game.</p>
<p>And that actually is one of the motivations for even having a laboratory that studies these things</p>
<p>is that we really need better physiological, neuroscientific, and operational definitions</p>
<p>of what these things are. I mean, the field of understanding emotions and states, which is mainly</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m interested in, is very complicated. But we can do away with a lot of complicated debate</p>
<p>and say in our laboratory, what we&rsquo;re looking for to assign it a value of fear is a big inflection</p>
<p>in autonomic arousal. So increases in heart rate, increases in breathing, perspiration,</p>
<p>pupil dilation, all the hallmark signature features of the stress response. And in some cases,</p>
<p>we have the benefit of getting neurosurgery patients where we&rsquo;ve got electrodes in their</p>
<p>amygdala and their insula and the orbitofrontal cortex down beneath the skull. So these are</p>
<p>chronically implanted electrodes. We&rsquo;re getting multiunit signals and we can start seeing some</p>
<p>central features of meaning within the brain. And what&rsquo;s interesting is that as trivial as it might</p>
<p>seem in listening to it, almost everybody responds to heights and falling from a high virtual place</p>
<p>with a very strong stress, if not fear response. And that&rsquo;s because the visual vestibular apparatus,</p>
<p>right? The optic flow and how it links to the balanced semicircular canals of the inner ears,</p>
<p>all this technical stuff. But really, all of that pulls all your physiology, the feeling that your</p>
<p>stomach is dropping, the feeling that suddenly you&rsquo;re sweating, even though you&rsquo;re not afraid</p>
<p>of falling off this virtual platform, but you feel as if you&rsquo;re falling because of the optic flow.</p>
<p>That one is universal. So we&rsquo;ve got a dive with great white sharks experience where you actually</p>
<p>exit the cage. We went out and did this in the real world and brought back 360 video that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>built out pretty. Oh, so this is actually 360 video.</p>
<p>360 video. And this was important to us, right? So when we decided to set up this platform,</p>
<p>a lot of the motivation was that a lot of the studies of these things in laboratories,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to call them lame because I want to be respectful of the people that did this stuff</p>
<p>before, but they study fear by showing subjects a picture of a bloody arm or a snake or something</p>
<p>like that. And it just, unless you have a snake phobia, it just wasn&rsquo;t creating a real enough</p>
<p>experience. So we need to do something where people aren&rsquo;t going to get injured, but where</p>
<p>we can tap into the physiology and that thing of presence of people momentarily, not the whole time,</p>
<p>but momentarily forgetting they&rsquo;re in a laboratory. And so heights will always do it. And if people</p>
<p>want to challenge me on this, I like to point to that movie, Free Solo, which was wild because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an incredible movie, but I think a lot of its popularity can be explained by a puzzle,</p>
<p>which is you knew he was going to live when you walked in the theater or you watched it at home.</p>
<p>You knew before that he survived. And yet it was still scary that people somehow were able to put</p>
<p>themselves into that experience or into Alex&rsquo;s experience enough that they were concerned or</p>
<p>worried or afraid at some level. So heights always does it. If we get people who have generalized</p>
<p>anxiety, these are people who wake up and move through life at a generally higher state of</p>
<p>autonomic arousal and anxiety, then we can tip them a little bit more easily with things that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily get everyone afraid. Things like claustrophobia, public speaking, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to vary from person to person. And then if you&rsquo;re afraid of sharks, like my sister for instance</p>
<p>is afraid of sharks, she won&rsquo;t even come to my laboratory because there&rsquo;s a thing about sharks</p>
<p>in it. That&rsquo;s how terrified some people are of these specific stimuli, but heights gets them</p>
<p>every time. Yeah. And I&rsquo;m terrified of heights. We have you step off a platform, virtual platform,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a flat floor in my lab, but you&rsquo;re up there. Well, you actually allow them the</p>
<p>possibility in the virtual world to actually take the leap of faith. Yeah. Maybe I should</p>
<p>describe a little bit of the experiment. So without giving away too much, in case someone</p>
<p>wants to be a subject in one of these experiments, we have them playing a cognitive game. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>simple lights out kind of game where you&rsquo;re pointing a cursor and turning out lights on a</p>
<p>grid, but it gets increasingly complex and it speeds up on them. And there&rsquo;s a failure point</p>
<p>for everybody where they just can&rsquo;t make the motor commands fast enough. And then we surprise</p>
<p>people essentially by placing them virtually, all of a sudden they&rsquo;re on a narrow platform between</p>
<p>two buildings. And then we encourage them or we cue them by talking to them through a microphone</p>
<p>to continue across that platform to continue the game. And some people, they actually will</p>
<p>get down on the ground and hold onto a virtual beam that doesn&rsquo;t even exist on a flat floor.</p>
<p>And so what this really tells us is the power of the brain to enter these virtual states as if</p>
<p>they were real. And we really think that anchoring the visual and the vestibular, the balance</p>
<p>components of the nervous system are what bring people into that presence so quickly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the potential, and we haven&rsquo;t done this yet to bring in 360 sound.</p>
<p>So the reason we did 360 video is when we started all this back in 2016,</p>
<p>a lot of the VR was pretty lame, frankly, it was CGI, it just wasn&rsquo;t real enough. But with 360</p>
<p>video, we knew that we could get people into this presence where they think they&rsquo;re in a real</p>
<p>experience more quickly. And our friend Michael Muller, who I was introduced to because of the</p>
<p>project, I reached out to some friends. Michael Muller is a very famous portrait</p>
<p>photographer in Hollywood, but he dives with great white sharks and he leaves the cage.</p>
<p>And so we worked with him to build a 360 video apparatus that we could swim underwater with,</p>
<p>went out to Guadalupe Island, Mexico, and actually got the experience. It was a lot of fun. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some interesting moments out there of danger, but it came back with that video and built that for</p>
<p>the sharks. And then we realized we need to do this for everything. We need to do it for heights. We</p>
<p>need to do it for public speaking, for claustrophobia. And what&rsquo;s missing still is 360 sound where 360</p>
<p>sound would be, for instance, if I were to turn around and there was a giant attack dog there,</p>
<p>the moment I would turn around and see it, the dog would growl. But if I turn back toward you,</p>
<p>then it would be silent. And that brings a very real element to one&rsquo;s own behavior where you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen if you turn a corner. Whereas if there&rsquo;s a dog growling behind</p>
<p>me and I turn around and then I turn back to you and it&rsquo;s still growling, that might seem like more</p>
<p>of an impending threat and sustained threat, but actually it&rsquo;s when you start linking your own body</p>
<p>movements to the experience. So when it&rsquo;s closed loop where my movements and choices are starting</p>
<p>to influence things and they&rsquo;re getting scarier and scarier, that&rsquo;s when you can really drive</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s nervous system down these paths of high states of stress and fear. Now we don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>traumatize people obviously, but we also study a number of tools that allow them to calm themselves</p>
<p>in these environments. So the short answer is height. Well, from a psychology and from a neuroscience</p>
<p>perspective, this whole construction that you&rsquo;ve developed is fascinating. We did this a little</p>
<p>bit with autonomous vehicles. So to try to understand the decision making process of a</p>
<p>pedestrian when they cross the road and trying to create an experience of a car, you know, that</p>
<p>could run you over. So there&rsquo;s the danger there. I was so surprised how real that whole world was.</p>
<p>And the graphics that we built wasn&rsquo;t ultra realistic or anything, but I was still afraid</p>
<p>of being hit by a car. Everybody we tested were really afraid of being hit by that car.</p>
<p>Even though it was all a simulation.</p>
<p>It was all a simulation. It was kind of boxy actually. I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t like ultra realistic</p>
<p>simulation. It was fascinating. Looms and heights. So any kind of depth,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just programmed to not necessarily recoil, but to be cautious about that edge and that depth.</p>
<p>And then looms, things coming at us that are getting larger. There are looming sensing neurons</p>
<p>even in the retina at a very, very early stage of visual processing. And incidentally, the way</p>
<p>Muller and folks learn how to not get eaten by great white sharks when you&rsquo;re swimming outside</p>
<p>the cage is as they start lumbering in, you swim toward them. And they get very confused when you</p>
<p>loom on them because clearly you&rsquo;re smaller. Clearly they could eat you if they wanted to,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about forward movement toward any creature that that creature questions</p>
<p>whether or not it would be a good idea to generate forward movement toward you. And so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually the survival tool of these cage exit white shark divers. Are you playing around with,</p>
<p>like one of the critical things for the autonomous vehicle research is you couldn&rsquo;t do 360 video</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a game theoretic. There&rsquo;s an interactive element that&rsquo;s really necessary.</p>
<p>So maybe people realize this, maybe they don&rsquo;t, but 360 video, you obviously,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s actually not that obvious to people, but you can&rsquo;t change the reality that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching. That&rsquo;s right. So, but you find that that&rsquo;s like, is there something fundamental</p>
<p>about fear and stress that the interactive element is essential for, or do you find you can,</p>
<p>you can arouse people with just the video? Great question. It works best to use mixed</p>
<p>reality. So we have a snake stimulus that I personally don&rsquo;t like snakes at all. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mind spiders. We also have a spider stimulus, but like snakes, I just don&rsquo;t like them. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something about the, the slithering and the, it just creates a visceral response for me.</p>
<p>Some people not so much, and they have lower levels of stress and fear in there. But one way</p>
<p>that we can get them to feel more of that is to use mixed reality where we have an actual physical</p>
<p>bat and they have to stomp out the snake as opposed to just walk to a little safe corner,</p>
<p>which then makes the snake disappear. That tends to be not as stressful as if they have</p>
<p>a physical weapon. And so you&rsquo;ve got people in there, you know, banging on the floor against</p>
<p>this thing. And there&rsquo;s something about engaging that makes it more of a, more of a threat. Now,</p>
<p>I should also mention that we, we always get the subjective report from the subject of what they</p>
<p>experienced because we never want to project our own ideas about what they were feeling,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the beauty of working with humans is you can ask them how they feel and humans aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>great at explaining how they feel. But it&rsquo;s a lot easier to understand what they&rsquo;re saying than a</p>
<p>mouse or a macaque monkey is saying. So it&rsquo;s the best we can do is language plus these physiological</p>
<p>and neurophysiological signals. Is there something you&rsquo;ve learned about yourself about your deepest</p>
<p>fears? Like you said, snakes, is there something that, like if I were to torture you, I&rsquo;m, so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>Russian. So, you know, I always kind of think, how can I murder this people that this person</p>
<p>entered the room, but also how, how can I torture you to get some information out of you? What would</p>
<p>I go with? Hmm. It&rsquo;s interesting. You should say that I never considered myself claustrophobic,</p>
<p>but because I don&rsquo;t mind small environments provided they&rsquo;re well ventilated. But I,</p>
<p>before COVID, I started going to this Russian banya, you know, and then, and I had never been</p>
<p>to a banya. So, you know, the whole experience of really, really hot sauna and what are they</p>
<p>called? The plots. They&rsquo;re hitting you with the leaves and it gets really hot and humid in there.</p>
<p>And there were a couple of times where I thought, okay, this thing is below ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a city where there are a lot of earthquakes. Like if this place crumbled and</p>
<p>we were stuck in here and I&rsquo;d start getting a little panicky and I realized, I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like small confined spaces with poor ventilation. So I realized I think I have some claustrophobia</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that before. So I&rsquo;ve put myself into our own claustrophobia stimulus,</p>
<p>which involves getting into an elevator and with a bunch of people, virtual people,</p>
<p>and the elevator gets stalled. And at first you&rsquo;re fine. You feel fine. But then as we start</p>
<p>modulating the environment and we actually can control levels of oxygen in the environment,</p>
<p>if we want to, it is really uncomfortable for me. And I never would have thought, you know, I fly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m comfortable in planes, but it is really uncomfortable. And so I think I&rsquo;ve unhatched</p>
<p>a bit of a claustrophobia. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For me as well, probably that one, that one is pretty</p>
<p>bad. The heights I tried to overcome. So I went to skydiving to try to overcome the fear of heights,</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t help. Did you jump out? Yeah. Yeah. I jumped out, but it was, it was a,</p>
<p>it was fundamentally different experience. And I guess there could be a lot of different flavors</p>
<p>of fear of heights maybe, but the one I have didn&rsquo;t seem to be connected to jumping out of a</p>
<p>plane is a very different, cause like once you accept that you&rsquo;re going to jump, then it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different thing. I think what I&rsquo;m afraid of is the moments before it is the scariest part.</p>
<p>Absolutely. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s emphasized in the skydiving experience as much,</p>
<p>and also just the acceptance of the fact that it&rsquo;s going to happen. So once you accept that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to happen, it&rsquo;s not as scary. It&rsquo;s the fact that it&rsquo;s not supposed to happen.</p>
<p>And it might, that&rsquo;s the scary part that I guess I&rsquo;m not being eloquent in this description,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about skydiving that was actually philosophically liberating. I was,</p>
<p>I was like, wow, it, it was the possibility that you can walk on a surface. And then at a certain</p>
<p>point there&rsquo;s no surface anymore to walk on. And it&rsquo;s all of a sudden the world becomes</p>
<p>three dimensional and there&rsquo;s this freedom of floating that the concept of like of earth</p>
<p>disappears for a brief few seconds. I don&rsquo;t know. That was, that was wild. That was wild,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m still terrified of heights. So, I mean, one, one thing I want to ask just on fear,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s so fascinating is have you learned anything about what it takes to overcome fears?</p>
<p>Yes. And that comes from two, from a, you know, research study standpoint,</p>
<p>two parallel tracks of research. One was done actually in mice, because we have a mouse lab</p>
<p>also where we can probe around in different brain areas and try and figure out what interesting</p>
<p>brain areas we might want to probe around in humans. And a graduate student in my lab,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s now at Caltech, Lindsay Saleh, published a paper back in 2018, showing that what at first</p>
<p>might seem a little bit obvious, but the mechanisms are not, which is that there are really three</p>
<p>responses to fear. You can pause, you can freeze essentially. You can retreat, you can back up,</p>
<p>or you can go forward. And there&rsquo;s a single hub of neurons in the midbrain, it&rsquo;s actually not</p>
<p>the midbrain, but it&rsquo;s in the middle of the thalamus, which is a forebrain structure.</p>
<p>And depending on which neurons are active there, there&rsquo;s a much higher probability that a mouse,</p>
<p>or it turns out, or a human will advance in the face of fear or will pause or will retreat.</p>
<p>Now that just assigns a neural structure to a behavioral phenomenon. But what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>is that it turns out that the lowest level of stress or autonomic arousal is actually associated</p>
<p>with the pausing and freezing response. Then as the threat becomes more impending, and we used</p>
<p>visual looms in this case, the retreat response has a slightly higher level of autonomic arousal</p>
<p>and stress. So think about playing hide and go seeking, you&rsquo;re trying to stay quiet in a closet</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re hiding. If you&rsquo;re very calm, it&rsquo;s easy to stay quiet and still. As your level of stress</p>
<p>goes up, it&rsquo;s harder to maintain that level of quiet and stillness. You see this also in animals</p>
<p>that are stalking, a cat will chatter its teeth. That&rsquo;s actually sort of top down inhibition and</p>
<p>trying to restrain behavior. So the freeze response is actually an active response,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fairly low stress. And what was interesting to us is that the highest level</p>
<p>of autonomic arousal was associated with the forward movement toward the threat. So in your case,</p>
<p>jumping out of the plane. However, the forward movement in the face of threat was linked to the</p>
<p>activation of what we call collateral, which means just a side connection, literally a wire in the</p>
<p>brain that connects to the dopamine circuits for reward. And so when one safely and adaptively,</p>
<p>meaning you survive, moves through a threat or toward a threat, it&rsquo;s rewarded as a positive</p>
<p>experience. And so the key, it actually maps very well to cognitive behavioral therapy and</p>
<p>a lot of the existing treatments for trauma is that you have to confront the thing that</p>
<p>makes you afraid. So otherwise you exist in this very low level of reverberatory circuit activity</p>
<p>where the circuits for autonomic arousal are humming and they&rsquo;re humming more and more and</p>
<p>more. And we have to remember that stress and fear and threat were designed to agitate us so</p>
<p>that we actually move. So the reason I mentioned this is I think a lot of times people think that</p>
<p>the maximum stress response or fear response is to freeze and to lock up. But that&rsquo;s actually not</p>
<p>the maximum stress response. The maximum stress response is to advance, but it&rsquo;s associated with</p>
<p>reward. It has positive valence. So there&rsquo;s this kind of, everyone always thinks about the bell</p>
<p>shape, you know, the sort of hump shape curve for, you know, at low levels arousal performance is low</p>
<p>and as the increases performance goes higher and then it drops off as you get really stressed.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another bump further out that distribution where you perform very well under</p>
<p>very high levels of stress. And so we&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time in humans and in animals</p>
<p>exploring what it takes to get people comfortable to go to that place and also to let them experience</p>
<p>how there are heightened states of cognition there. There&rsquo;s changes in time perception that</p>
<p>allow you to evaluate your environment at a faster frame rate, essentially. This is the matrix as a</p>
<p>lot of people think of it. But we tend to think about fear as all the low level stuff where</p>
<p>things aren&rsquo;t worked out, but there are a lot of different features to the fear response.</p>
<p>And so we think about it quantitatively and we think about it from a circuit perspective</p>
<p>in terms of outcomes. And we try and weigh that against the threat. So we never want people to</p>
<p>put themselves in unnecessary risk, but that&rsquo;s where the VR is fun because you can push people</p>
<p>hard without risk of physically injuring them. And that&rsquo;s like you said, the little bump that</p>
<p>seems to be a very small fraction of the human experience, right? So it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating</p>
<p>to study it because most of us move through life without ever experiencing that kind of focus.</p>
<p>Well, everything&rsquo;s in a peak state there. I really think that&rsquo;s where optimal performance lies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many interesting words here, but what&rsquo;s performance? And what&rsquo;s optimal performance?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about mental ability to what to perceive the environment quickly to make actions</p>
<p>quickly. What&rsquo;s optimal performance? Yeah. Well, it&rsquo;s very subjective and it</p>
<p>varies depending on task and environment. So one way we can make it a little bit more</p>
<p>operational and concrete is to say there is a sweet spot, if you will, where the level of internal</p>
<p>autonomic arousal, AKA stress or alertness, whatever you want to call it, is ideally matched to the</p>
<p>speed of whatever challenge you have to be facing in the outside world. So we all have</p>
<p>perception of the outside world as exteroception and the perception of our internal real estate</p>
<p>interoception. And when those two things, when interoception and exteroception are matched along</p>
<p>a couple of dimensions, performance tends to increase or tends to be in an optimal range.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t play guitar, but I know you play guitar. So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to learn something new on the guitar. I&rsquo;m not saying that being in these super high</p>
<p>states of activation are the best place for you to be in order to learn. It may be that your</p>
<p>internal arousal needs to be at a level where your analysis of space and time has to be well matched</p>
<p>to the information coming in and what you&rsquo;re trying to do in terms of performance, in terms of</p>
<p>playing chords and notes and so forth. Now, in these cases of high threat where things are coming</p>
<p>in quickly and animals and humans need to react very quickly, the higher your state of autonomic</p>
<p>arousal, the better because you&rsquo;re slicing time more finely just because of the way the autonomic</p>
<p>system works. The pupil dilation, for instance, and movement of the lens essentially changes your</p>
<p>optics and that&rsquo;s obvious. But with the change in optics is a change in how you bin time and</p>
<p>slice time, which allows you to get more frames per second readout. With the guitar learning, for</p>
<p>instance, it might actually be that you want to be almost sleepy, almost in a drowsy state to be able</p>
<p>to, and I don&rsquo;t play music, so I&rsquo;m guessing here, but sense some of the nuance in the chords or the</p>
<p>ways to be relaxed enough that your fingers can follow an external cue. So matching the movement</p>
<p>of your fingers to something that&rsquo;s pure exteroception. And so there is no perfect</p>
<p>autonomic state for performance. This is why I don&rsquo;t favor terms like flow because they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>well operationally defined enough. But I do believe that optimal or peak performance is</p>
<p>going to arise when internal state is ideally matched to the space time features of the external</p>
<p>demands. So there&rsquo;s some slicing of time that happens and then you&rsquo;re able to adjust, slice</p>
<p>time more finely or more, less finely in order to adjust to the stimulus, the dynamics of the</p>
<p>stimulus. What about the realm of ideas? So like, you know, I&rsquo;m a big believer, this guy named</p>
<p>Cal Newport who wrote a book about deep work. Yeah, I love that book. Yeah, he&rsquo;s great. I mean,</p>
<p>one of the nice things, I&rsquo;ve always practiced deep work, but it&rsquo;s always nice to have words</p>
<p>put to the concepts that you&rsquo;ve practiced. It somehow makes them more concrete and allows you</p>
<p>to get better. It turns it into a skill that you can get better at. But, you know, I also value</p>
<p>deep thinking where you think it&rsquo;s almost meditative. You think about a particular</p>
<p>concept for long periods of time. The programming you have to do that kind of thing for. You just</p>
<p>have to hold this concept, like you hold it and then you take steps with it. You take further</p>
<p>steps and you&rsquo;re holding relatively complicated things in your mind as you&rsquo;re thinking about them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of, I mean, the hardest part is there&rsquo;s frustrating things like you take a step</p>
<p>and it turns out to be the wrong direction. So you have to calmly turn around and take a step back.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s, you kind of like exploring through the space of ideas. Is there something about</p>
<p>your study of optimal performance that can be applied to the act of thinking as opposed to</p>
<p>action? Well, we haven&rsquo;t done too much work there, but I think I can comment on it from a neuroscience</p>
<p>perspective, which is really all I do is, well, I mean, we do experiments in the lab, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>looking at things through the lens of neuroscience. So what you&rsquo;re describing can be mapped fairly</p>
<p>well to working memory, just keeping things online and updating them as they change in information</p>
<p>is coming back into your brain. Jack Feldman, who I&rsquo;m a huge fan of and fortunate to be friends</p>
<p>with is a professor at UCLA, works on respiration and breathing, but he has a physics background.</p>
<p>And so he thinks about respiration and breathing in terms of ground states and how they modulate</p>
<p>other states. Very, very interesting and I think important work. Jack has an answer to your</p>
<p>question. So I&rsquo;m not going to get this exactly right because this is lifted from a coffee</p>
<p>conversation that we had about a month ago. So apologies in advance, but I think I can get mostly</p>
<p>right. So we were talking about this, about how the brain updates cognitive states depending on</p>
<p>demands and thinking in particular. And he used an interesting example. I&rsquo;d be curious to know if you</p>
<p>agree or disagree. He said, most great mathematics is done by people in their late teens and 20s,</p>
<p>and even you could say early 20s, sometimes into the late 20s, but not much further on. Maybe I</p>
<p>just insulted some mathematicians. No, that&rsquo;s true. And I think that it demands, his argument</p>
<p>was there&rsquo;s a tremendous demand on working memory to work out theorems in math and to keep a number</p>
<p>of plates spinning, so to speak mentally and run back and forth between them, updating them.</p>
<p>In physics, Jack said, and I think this makes sense to me too, that there&rsquo;s a reliance on</p>
<p>working memory, but an increased reliance on some deep memory and deep memory stores,</p>
<p>probably stuff that&rsquo;s moved out of the hippocampus and forebrain and into the cortex and is some</p>
<p>episodic and declarative stuff, but really, so you&rsquo;re pulling from your library, basically. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not all RAM, it&rsquo;s not all working memory. And then in biology, and physicists tend to have</p>
<p>very active careers into their 30s and 40s and 50s and so forth, sometimes later. And then in</p>
<p>biology, you see careers that have a much longer arc, these protracted careers often, people still</p>
<p>in their 60s and 70s doing really terrific work, not always doing it with their own hands because</p>
<p>people in the labs are doing them, of course. And that work does tend to rely on insights</p>
<p>gained from having a very deep knowledge base where you can remember a paper or maybe a figure</p>
<p>in a paper, you could go look it up if you wanted to, but it&rsquo;s very different than the working</p>
<p>memory of the mathematician. And so when you&rsquo;re talking about coding or being in that tunnel of</p>
<p>thought and trying to iterate and keeping a lot of plates spinning, it speaks directly to working</p>
<p>memory. My lab hasn&rsquo;t done too much of that. But we are pushing working memory when we have people</p>
<p>do things like these simple lights out tasks. We can increase the cognitive load by increasing the</p>
<p>level of autonomic arousal to the point where they start doing less well. And everyone has a cliff.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s kind of fun. We&rsquo;ve had SEAL team operators come to the lab. We&rsquo;ve had people from</p>
<p>other units in the military. We&rsquo;ve had a range of intellects and backgrounds and all sorts of things</p>
<p>and everyone has a cliff. And those cliffs sometimes show up as a function of the demands of</p>
<p>speed of processing or how many things you need to keep online. I mean, we&rsquo;re all limited at some</p>
<p>point in the number of things we can keep online. So what you&rsquo;re describing is very interesting</p>
<p>because I think it has to do with how narrow or broad the information set is. And I&rsquo;m not an</p>
<p>active programmer, so this is a regime I don&rsquo;t really fully know. So I don&rsquo;t want to comment</p>
<p>about it in any way that doesn&rsquo;t suggest that. But I think that what you&rsquo;re talking about is</p>
<p>top down control. So this is prefrontal cortex keeping every bit of reflexive circuitry at bay,</p>
<p>the one that makes you want to get up and use the restroom, the one that makes you want to check</p>
<p>your phone, all of that, but also running these anterior thalamus to prefrontal cortex loops,</p>
<p>which we know are very important for working memory. Let me try to think through this a little</p>
<p>bit. So reducing the process of thinking to working memory access is tricky. It&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>ultimately correct. But if I were to say some of the most challenging things that an engineer has</p>
<p>to do, and a scientific thinker, I would say it&rsquo;s kind of depressing to think that we do that best</p>
<p>in our 20s, but is this kind of first principles thinking step of saying you&rsquo;re accessing the</p>
<p>things that you know, and then saying, well, let me, how do I do this differently than I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>it before? This weird like stepping back, like, is this right? Let&rsquo;s try it this other way. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most mentally taxing step is like, you&rsquo;ve gotten quite good at this particular pattern of</p>
<p>how you solve this particular problem. So there&rsquo;s a pattern recognition first. You&rsquo;re like, okay,</p>
<p>I know how to build a thing that solves this particular problem in programming, say. And then</p>
<p>the question is, but can I do it much better? And I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>the hell that is. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s accessing working memory. That&rsquo;s almost access. Maybe it is</p>
<p>accessing memory in a sense. It&rsquo;s trying to find similar patterns in a totally different place that</p>
<p>it could be projected onto this. But you&rsquo;re not querying facts. You&rsquo;re querying like functional</p>
<p>things like. Yeah, it&rsquo;s patterns. I mean, you&rsquo;re running out, you&rsquo;re testing algorithms. Yeah.</p>
<p>Right. You&rsquo;re testing algorithms. So I want to just, because I know some of the people listening</p>
<p>to this and you have a basis in scientific training and have scientific training. So I</p>
<p>want to be clear. I think we can be correct about some things like the role of working memory in</p>
<p>these kinds of processes without being exhaustive. We&rsquo;re not saying they&rsquo;re the only thing. We can be</p>
<p>correct, but not assume that that&rsquo;s the only thing involved. And neuroscience, let&rsquo;s face it,</p>
<p>is still in its infancy. I mean, we probably know 1% of what there is to know about the brain.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve learned so much and yet there may be global states that underlie this that</p>
<p>make prefrontal circuitry work differently than it would in a different regime or even time of day.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of mysteries about this. So I just want to make sure that we&rsquo;re aiming for</p>
<p>precision and accuracy, but we&rsquo;re not going to be exhausted. So there&rsquo;s a difference there. And I</p>
<p>think sometimes in the vastness of the internet, that gets forgotten. So the other is that</p>
<p>we think about these operations at really focused, keeping a lot of things online.</p>
<p>But what you were describing is actually, it speaks to the very real possibility probably</p>
<p>that with certainty, there&rsquo;s another element to all this, which is when you&rsquo;re trying out lots</p>
<p>of things, in particular, lots of different algorithms, you don&rsquo;t want to be in a state of</p>
<p>very high autonomic arousal. That&rsquo;s not what you want, because the higher level of autonomic</p>
<p>arousal and stress in the system, the more rigidly you&rsquo;re going to analyze space and time. And what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about is playing with space time dimensionality. And I want to be very clear. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>the son of a physicist. I am not a physicist. When I talk about space and time, I&rsquo;m literally</p>
<p>talking about visual space and how long it takes for my finger to move from this point to this</p>
<p>point. You are facing a tiger and trying to figure out how to avoid being eaten by the tiger.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s primarily going to be determined by the visual system in humans. We don&rsquo;t walk through</p>
<p>space, for instance, like a cent hound would and look at three dimensional scent plumes. When a</p>
<p>scent hound goes out in the environment, they have depth to the odor trails they&rsquo;re following.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t think about them. We don&rsquo;t think about odor trails. You might say,</p>
<p>oh, well, the smell&rsquo;s getting more intense. Aha. But they actually have three dimensional odor</p>
<p>trails. So they see a cone of odor, see, of course, with their nose, with their olfactory cortex.</p>
<p>We do that with our visual system. And we parse time, often subconsciously, mainly with our visual</p>
<p>system, also with our auditory system. And this shows up for the musicians out there. Metronomes</p>
<p>are a great way to play with this. Bass drumming, when the frequency of bass drumming changes,</p>
<p>your perception of time changes quite a lot. So in any event, space and time are linked</p>
<p>through the sensory apparatus, through the eyes and ears and nose, and probably through taste too,</p>
<p>and through touch for us, but mainly through vision. So when you drop into some coding or</p>
<p>iterating through a creative process or trying to solve something hard,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really do that well if you&rsquo;re in a rigid, high level of autonomic arousal because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re plugging in algorithms that are in this space regime, this time regime matches. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>space time matched. Whereas creativity, I always think the lava lamp is actually a pretty good</p>
<p>example, even though it has these counterculture, new agey connotations, because you actually don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know which direction things are going to change. And so in drowsy states, sleeping and drowsy</p>
<p>states, space and time become dislodged from one another somewhat, and they&rsquo;re very fluid.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why a lot of solutions come to people after sleep and naps. And this could</p>
<p>even take us into a discussion, if you like, about psychedelics and what we now know, for instance,</p>
<p>that people thought that psychedelics work by just creating spontaneous bursting of neurons</p>
<p>and hallucinations. But the 5H2C and 2A receptors, which are the main sites for things like LSD and</p>
<p>psilocybin and some of the other ones that create hallucinations, the drugs that create hallucinations,</p>
<p>most of those receptors are actually in the collection of neurons that encase the thalamus,</p>
<p>which is where all the sensory information goes into, a structure called the thalamic</p>
<p>reticular nucleus. And it&rsquo;s an inhibitory structure that makes sure that when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting here talking, that I&rsquo;m mainly focused on whatever I&rsquo;m seeing visually, that I&rsquo;m essentially</p>
<p>eliminating a lot of sensory information. Under conditions where people take psychedelics and</p>
<p>these particular serotonin receptors are activated, that inhibitory shell, it&rsquo;s literally shaped like</p>
<p>a shell, starts losing its ability to inhibit the passage of sensory information. But mostly</p>
<p>the effects of psychedelics are because the lateral connectivity in layer five of cortex</p>
<p>across cortical areas is increased. And what that does is that means that the space time relationship</p>
<p>for vision, like moving my finger from here to here, very rigid space time relationship,</p>
<p>right? If I slow it down, it&rsquo;s slower, obviously, but there&rsquo;s a prediction that can be made based on</p>
<p>the neurons in the retina and the cortex. On psychedelics, this could be a very strange</p>
<p>experience. But the auditory system has one that&rsquo;s slightly different space time, and they&rsquo;re matched</p>
<p>to one another in deeper circuits in the brain. The olfactory system has a different space time</p>
<p>relationship to it. So under conditions of these increased activation of these serotonin receptors,</p>
<p>space and time across sensory area starts being fluid. So I&rsquo;m no longer running the algorithm for</p>
<p>moving my finger from here to here and making a prediction based on vision alone. I&rsquo;m now,</p>
<p>this is where people talk about hearing sites, right? You start linking, this might actually</p>
<p>make a sound in a psychedelic state. Now I&rsquo;m not suggesting people run out and do psychedelics</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very disorganized, but essentially what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re mixing the algorithms.</p>
<p>And so when you talk about being able to access new solutions, you don&rsquo;t need to rely on</p>
<p>psychedelics. If people choose to do that, that&rsquo;s their business. But in drowsy states, this lateral</p>
<p>connectivity is increased as well. The shell of the thalamus shuts down. And these are through</p>
<p>these so called pons chiniculate occipital waves. And what&rsquo;s happening is you&rsquo;re getting whole brain</p>
<p>activation at a level that you start mixing algorithms. And so sometimes I think solutions</p>
<p>come not from being in that narrow tunnel of space time and strong activation of working memory and</p>
<p>trying to well iterate if this, then this very strong, deductive and inductive thinking and</p>
<p>working from first principles, but also from states where something that was an algorithm</p>
<p>that you never had in existence before suddenly gets lumped with another algorithm. And all of a</p>
<p>sudden a new possibility comes to mind. And so space and time need to be fluid and space and</p>
<p>time need to be rigid in order to come up with something meaningful. And I realize I&rsquo;m riffing</p>
<p>long on this, but this is why I think, you know, there was so much interest a few years ago with</p>
<p>Michael Pollan&rsquo;s book and other things happening about psychedelics as a pathway to exploration and</p>
<p>all this kind of thing. But the real question is what you export back from those experiences,</p>
<p>because dreams are amazing, but if you can&rsquo;t bring anything back from them, they&rsquo;re just amazing.</p>
<p>I wonder how to experiment with the mind without, without any medical assistance</p>
<p>first. Like, you know, I, I pushed my mind in all kinds of directions. I definitely want to,</p>
<p>I did, uh, shrooms a couple of times. I definitely want to, uh, figure out how I can experiment with,</p>
<p>um, with psychedelics. I&rsquo;m talking to, uh, Rick Doblin, uh, soon. I even went back and forth. So</p>
<p>he does all these studies on psychedelics and he keeps ignoring the parts of my email that asks,</p>
<p>like, how do I participate in these studies? Well, there are some legality issues. I mean,</p>
<p>conversation, I want to be very clear. I&rsquo;m not saying that anyone should go out and do psychedelics.</p>
<p>I think that drowsy states and sleep states are super interesting for accessing some of</p>
<p>these more creative states of mind. Hypnosis is something that my colleague, David Spiegel,</p>
<p>associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford works on where also, again, it&rsquo;s a unique state because</p>
<p>you have narrow context. So this is very, um, kind of tunnel vision and yet deeply relaxed,</p>
<p>excuse me, deeply relaxed where new algorithms, if you will, can start to surface, um, strong</p>
<p>state for inducing neuroplasticity. And I think, you know, so if I had a, um, I&rsquo;m part of a group,</p>
<p>um, that, uh, it&rsquo;s called the liminal collective as a group of people that get together and talk</p>
<p>about, um, just wild ideas, but they try and implement. Um, and it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a really interesting</p>
<p>group. Some people from a military, from a logitech and some other backgrounds, academic</p>
<p>backgrounds. And I was asked, you know, what would be, um, if you could create a tool,</p>
<p>you just had a tool like your magic wand wish for the day, what would it be? I thought it&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be really interesting if someone could develop psychedelics that have, um, on off switches.</p>
<p>So you could go into a psychedelic state very deeply for 10 minutes, but you could launch</p>
<p>yourself out of that state and place yourself into a linear real world state very quickly</p>
<p>so that you could extract whatever it was that happened in that experience. And then go back</p>
<p>in if you wanted, because the problem with psychedelic states and dream states is that</p>
<p>first of all, a lot of the reason people do them is they&rsquo;re lying. They say they want plasticity</p>
<p>and they want all this stuff. They want a peak experience inside of an amplified experience.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re kind of seeking something unusual. And I think we should just be honest about that</p>
<p>because a lot of times they&rsquo;re not trying to make their brain better. They&rsquo;re just trying</p>
<p>to experience something really amazing. But the problem is space and time are so unlocked</p>
<p>in these states, just like they are in dreams, that you can really end up with a whole lot of</p>
<p>nothing. You can have an amazing amplified experience housed in an amplified experience</p>
<p>and come out of that thinking you had a meaningful experience when you didn&rsquo;t bring anything back.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t bring anything back. All you have is a fuzzy memory of having a transformational</p>
<p>experience, but you don&rsquo;t actually have tools to bring back, sorry, actually concrete ideas to</p>
<p>bring back. Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting. I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to do that with a mind to be able to</p>
<p>hop back and forth. I think that&rsquo;s where the real power of adjusting states is going to be. It</p>
<p>probably will be with devices. I mean, maybe it will be done through pharmacology. It&rsquo;s just that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to do on off switches in human pharmacology that we have them for animals.</p>
<p>I mean, we have Cree flip recombinases and we have channel opsins and halo root opsins and</p>
<p>all these kinds of things. But to do that work in humans is tricky, but I think you could do it</p>
<p>with virtual reality, augmented reality and other devices that bring more of the somatic experience</p>
<p>into it. You&rsquo;re of course, a scientist who&rsquo;s studying humans as a collective. I tend to be</p>
<p>just a one person scientist of just looking at myself and I play when these deep thinking,</p>
<p>deep work sessions, I&rsquo;m very cognizant in the morning that there&rsquo;s times when my mind is so</p>
<p>eloquent at being able to jump around from ideas and hold them all together. I&rsquo;m almost like I</p>
<p>step back from a third person perspective and enjoy that, whatever that mind is doing,</p>
<p>I do not waste those moments. I&rsquo;m very conscious of this little creature that woke up that&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>awake for, if we&rsquo;re being honest, maybe a couple hours a day. Early part of the day for you.</p>
<p>Early part of the day. Not always. Well, early part of the day for me is a very fluid concept.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of those.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m one.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re one of those.</p>
<p>Being single, one of the problems, single and no meetings. I don&rsquo;t schedule any meetings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been living at like a 28 hour day. So it drifts. So it&rsquo;s all over the place. But</p>
<p>after a traditionally defined full night&rsquo;s sleep, whatever the heck that means, I find that in those</p>
<p>moments, there&rsquo;s a clarity of mind that&rsquo;s just, everything is effortless. And it&rsquo;s the deepest</p>
<p>dives intellectually that I make. And I&rsquo;m cognizant of it. And I try to bring that to the other parts</p>
<p>of the day that don&rsquo;t have it and treasure them even more in those moments because they only last</p>
<p>like five or 10 minutes. Because of course, in those moments you want to do all kinds of stupid</p>
<p>stuff that are completely is worthless, like check social media or something like that.</p>
<p>But those are the most precious things in intellectual life is those mental moments</p>
<p>of clarity. And I wonder, I&rsquo;m learning how to control them. I think caffeine is somehow involved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly.</p>
<p>Sure. Well, because if you learn how to titrate caffeine,</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s slightly different with this, what they need, but if you learn to titrate caffeine</p>
<p>with time of day and the kind of work that you&rsquo;re trying to do, you can bring that autonomic arousal</p>
<p>state into a close to perfect place. And then you can tune it in with, sometimes people want a little</p>
<p>bit of background music. Sometimes they want less, these kinds of things. The early part of the day</p>
<p>is interesting because the one thing that&rsquo;s not often discussed is this transition out of sleep.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a book, I think it&rsquo;s called Winston Churchill&rsquo;s Nap. And it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>naps and the transition between wake and sleep as a valuable period. A long time ago,</p>
<p>someone who I respect a lot was mentoring me said, be very careful about bringing in</p>
<p>someone else&rsquo;s sensory experience early in the day. So when I wake up, I&rsquo;m very drowsy. I sleep</p>
<p>well, but I don&rsquo;t emerge from that very quickly. I need a lot of caffeine to wake up and whatnot.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this concept of getting the download from sleep, which is in sleep, you were essentially</p>
<p>expunging the things that you don&rsquo;t need, the stuff that is meaningless from the previous day,</p>
<p>but you were also running variations on these algorithms of whatever it is you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>work out in life on short timescales like the previous day and long timescales like your whole</p>
<p>life. And those lateral connections in layer five of the neocortex are very robustly active and</p>
<p>across sensory areas. And you&rsquo;re running an algorithm or it&rsquo;s a brain state that will be</p>
<p>useless in waking. You wouldn&rsquo;t get anything done. You&rsquo;d be the person talking to yourself</p>
<p>in the hallway or something about something that no one else can see. But in those states,</p>
<p>the theory is that you arrive at certain solutions and those solutions will reveal</p>
<p>themselves in the early part of the day, unless you interfere with them by bringing in,</p>
<p>social media is a good example of you immediately enter somebody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>space time sensory relationship. Someone is the conductor of your thoughts in that case.</p>
<p>And so many people have written about this. What I&rsquo;m saying isn&rsquo;t entirely new, but allowing the</p>
<p>download to occur in the early part of the day and asking the question, am I more in my head</p>
<p>or am I more of an interoceptive or exteroceptive mode? And depending on the kind of work you need</p>
<p>to do, if it sounds like for you, it&rsquo;s very interoceptive and you&rsquo;ve got a lot of thinking</p>
<p>going on and a lot of computing going on, allowing yourself to transition out of that sleep state and</p>
<p>arrive with those solutions from sleep and plug into the work really deeply. And only then allowing</p>
<p>things like music, news, social media, doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t talk to loved ones and see</p>
<p>faces and things like that. But some people have taken this to the extreme. When I was a graduate</p>
<p>student at Berkeley, there was a guy there, a professor, brilliant, odd, but brilliant,</p>
<p>who was so fixated on this concept that he wouldn&rsquo;t look at faces in the early part of the</p>
<p>day because he just didn&rsquo;t want anything else to impact him. Now he didn&rsquo;t have the most rounded</p>
<p>life, I suppose. But if you&rsquo;re talking about cognitive performance, this could actually be</p>
<p>very beneficial. You said so many brilliant things. So one, if you read books that describe</p>
<p>the habits of brilliant people like writers, they do control that sensory experience in the</p>
<p>hours after wake. Like many writers, you know, they have a particular habit of several hours</p>
<p>early in the morning of actual writing. They don&rsquo;t do anything else for the rest of the day,</p>
<p>but they control, they&rsquo;re very sensitive to noises and so on. I think they make it very difficult to</p>
<p>live with them. I try to, I&rsquo;m definitely like that. Like I could, I love to control the sensory</p>
<p>how much information is coming in. There&rsquo;s something about the peaceful, just everything</p>
<p>being peaceful. At the same time, and we were talking to a mutual friend of Whitney Cummings,</p>
<p>who has a mansion, a castle on top of a cliff in the middle of nowhere. She actually purchased her</p>
<p>own island. She wants silence. She wants to control how much sound is coming in.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s very sensitive to sound and environment. Beautiful home and environment, but like clearly</p>
<p>puts a lot of attention into details. Yeah. And very creative.</p>
<p>Yeah. And that&rsquo;s, yeah, that allows for creativity to flourish. I&rsquo;m also, I don&rsquo;t like that feels</p>
<p>like a slippery slope. So I enjoy introducing the noises and signals and training my mind to</p>
<p>be able to tune them out. Cause I feel like you can&rsquo;t always control the environment so perfectly</p>
<p>because, cause your mind gets comfortable with that. I think it&rsquo;s a skill that you want to learn</p>
<p>to be able to shut it off. Like I often go to like back before COVID to a coffee shop.</p>
<p>It really annoys me when there&rsquo;s sounds and voices and so on, but I feel like I can train my mind</p>
<p>to, to block them out. So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a balance, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think you know, two things come to mind as you&rsquo;re saying this first of all,</p>
<p>yeah. I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about what&rsquo;s best for work is not always what&rsquo;s best for, you know,</p>
<p>completeness of life. I mean, you know, autism is probably many things like when you hit autism,</p>
<p>just like feet, there are probably 50 ways to get a fever. There are probably 50 ways to,</p>
<p>that the brain can create what looks like autism or what people call autism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting set of studies that have come out of David Ginty&rsquo;s lab at Harvard med,</p>
<p>looking at these are mouse mutants where these are models for autism, where nothing is disrupted</p>
<p>in the brain proper and in the central nervous system, but the sensory app, the sensory neurons,</p>
<p>the ones that innervate the skin and the ears and everything are, are hypersensitive. And this maps</p>
<p>to a mutation in certain forms of human autism. So this means that the, the overload of sensory</p>
<p>information and sensory experience that a lot of autistics feel, they&rsquo;re like that they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tolerate things. And then they get the stereotype behaviors, the rocking and the kind of the</p>
<p>shouting it, you know, we always thought of that as a brain problem. In some cases it might be,</p>
<p>but in many cases it&rsquo;s because they just can&rsquo;t, they, they seem to have a, it&rsquo;s like turning the</p>
<p>volume up on every sense. And so they&rsquo;re overwhelmed and none of us want to become like</p>
<p>that. I think it&rsquo;s very hard for them and it&rsquo;s hard for their parents and so forth. So I, I like</p>
<p>the coffee shop example because the way I think about trying to build up resilience, you know,</p>
<p>physically or mentally or otherwise is one of I guess we could call it limb. I like to call it</p>
<p>limbic friction. That&rsquo;s not a real scientific term. And I acknowledge that I&rsquo;m making it up</p>
<p>now because I think it captures the concept, which is that, you know, we always hear about</p>
<p>resilience. It makes it sound like, oh, you know, under stress where everything&rsquo;s coming at you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to stay calm, but there&rsquo;s another, you know, so limbic, the limbic system wants to</p>
<p>pull you in some direction, typically in the direction of reflexive behavior and the prefrontal</p>
<p>cortex through top down mechanisms has to suppress that and say, no, we&rsquo;re not going to respond to</p>
<p>the banging of the coffee cups behind me, or I&rsquo;m going to keep focusing. That&rsquo;s pure top down</p>
<p>control. So limbic friction is high in that environment. You&rsquo;ve put yourself into a high</p>
<p>limbic friction environment, meaning that the prefrontal cortex has to work really hard.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another side to limbic friction too, which is when you&rsquo;re very sleepy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing incoming. It can be completely silent and it&rsquo;s hard to engage and focus because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drifting off and you&rsquo;re getting sleepy. So their limbic friction is high, but for the</p>
<p>opposite reason, autonomic arousal is too low. So they&rsquo;re turning on Netflix in the background or</p>
<p>looping a song might boost your level of alertness that will allow top down control to be in exactly</p>
<p>the sweet spot you want it. So this is why earlier I was saying it&rsquo;s all about how we feel inside</p>
<p>relative to what&rsquo;s going on on the outside. We&rsquo;re constantly in this, I guess one way you</p>
<p>could envision it spatially, especially if people are listening to this just on audio,</p>
<p>is I like to think about it kind of like a glass barbell where one sphere of perception and</p>
<p>attention can be on what&rsquo;s going on with me. And one sphere of attention can be on what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>with you or something else in the room or in my environment. But this barbell isn&rsquo;t rigid. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not really glass. Would plasma work here? I don&rsquo;t know anything about plasma. Sorry. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So imagine that this thing can contort the size of the globes at the end of this barbell can get</p>
<p>bigger or smaller. So let&rsquo;s say I close my eyes and I bring all my experience into what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>through interoception internally. Now it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;ve got two orbs of perception just on my</p>
<p>internal state, but I can also do the opposite and bring both orbs of perception outside me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about my heart rate or my breathing. I&rsquo;m just thinking about something</p>
<p>I see. And what you&rsquo;ll start to realize as you kind of use this spatial model is that two things.</p>
<p>One is that it&rsquo;s very dynamic and that the more relaxed we are, the more these two orbs of</p>
<p>attention, the two ends of the barbell can move around freely. The more alert we are,</p>
<p>the more rigid they&rsquo;re going to be tethered in place. And that was designed so that if I have</p>
<p>a threat in my environment, it&rsquo;s tethered to that threat. If something&rsquo;s coming to attack me, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to be like, oh, my breathing cadence is a little bit quick. That&rsquo;s not how it works. Why?</p>
<p>Because both orbs are linked to that threat. And so my behavior is now actually being driven by</p>
<p>something external, even though I think it&rsquo;s internal. And so I don&rsquo;t want to get too abstract</p>
<p>here because I&rsquo;m a neuroscientist. I&rsquo;m not a theorist. But when you start thinking about</p>
<p>models of how the brain works, there are only really three things that neurons do. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>either sensory neurons, they&rsquo;re motor neurons, or they&rsquo;re modulating things. And the models of</p>
<p>attention and perception that we have now, 2020, tell us that we&rsquo;ve got interoception</p>
<p>and exteroception. They&rsquo;re strongly modulated by levels of autonomic arousal. And that if we want</p>
<p>to form the optimal relationship to some task or some pressure or some thing, whether or not it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sleep, an impending threat, or coding, we need to adjust our internal space time relationship with</p>
<p>the external space time relationship. And I realize I&rsquo;m repeating what I said earlier.</p>
<p>But we can actually assign circuitry to this stuff. It mostly has to do with how much limbic</p>
<p>friction there is, how much you&rsquo;re being pulled to some source. That source could be internal.</p>
<p>If I have pain, physical pain in my body, I&rsquo;m going to be much more interoceptive than I am</p>
<p>exteroceptive. You could be talking to me and I&rsquo;m just going to be thinking about that pain. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very hard. And the other thing that we can link it to is top down control, meaning anything in</p>
<p>our environment that has a lot of salience will tend to bring us into more exteroception than</p>
<p>interoception. And again, I don&rsquo;t want to litter the conversation with just a bunch of terms, but</p>
<p>what I think it can be useful for people is to do what essentially you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>Lex, is to start developing an awareness. When I wake up, am I mostly in a mode of interoception</p>
<p>or exteroception? When I work well, what does working well look like from the perspective of</p>
<p>autonomic arousal? How alert or calm am I? What kind of balance between internal focus and external</p>
<p>focus is there? And to sort of watch this process throughout the day. Can you linger just briefly</p>
<p>on, because you use this term a lot and it&rsquo;d be nice to try to get a little more color to it,</p>
<p>which is interoception and exteroception. What are we exactly talking about? So like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s included in each category and how much overlap is there? Interoception would be an</p>
<p>awareness of anything that&rsquo;s within the confines or on the surface of my skin that I&rsquo;m sensing.</p>
<p>So literally physiological. Physiologically, like within the boundaries of my skin</p>
<p>and probably touched to the skin as well. Exteroception would be perception of anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beyond the reach of my skin. So that bottle of water, a scent, a sound, and this</p>
<p>can change dramatically actually. If you have headphones in, you tend to hear things in your</p>
<p>head as opposed to a speaker in the room. This is actually the basis of ventriloquism.</p>
<p>So there are beautiful experiments done by Greg Reckenzone up at UC Davis, looking at how auditory</p>
<p>and visual cues are matched and you have an array of speakers and this will become obvious as I say</p>
<p>it, but obviously the ventriloquist doesn&rsquo;t throw their voice. What they do is they direct your</p>
<p>vision to a particular location and you think the sound is coming from that location. And there are</p>
<p>beautiful experiments that Greg and his colleagues have done where they suddenly introduce an</p>
<p>auditory visual mismatch and it freaks people out because you can actually make it seem from a</p>
<p>perception standpoint as if the sound arrived from the corner of the room and hit you physically and</p>
<p>people will recoil. And so sounds aren&rsquo;t getting thrown across the room. They&rsquo;re still coming from</p>
<p>a defined location, an array of speakers, but this is the way the brain creates these internal</p>
<p>representations. And again, I don&rsquo;t want to go down a rabbit hole, but I&rsquo;m sure the listeners</p>
<p>appreciate this, but everything in the brain is an abstraction, right? I mean, the sensory</p>
<p>apparatus, there are the eyes and ears and nose and skin and taste and all that are taking</p>
<p>information and with interoception, taking information from sensors inside the body,</p>
<p>the enteric nervous system for the gut. I&rsquo;ve got sensory neurons that innervate my liver,</p>
<p>um, et cetera, taking all that. And the brain is abstracting that in the same way that if I</p>
<p>took a picture of your face and I handed it to you and I&rsquo;d say, that&rsquo;s you, you&rsquo;d say, yeah, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>me. But if I were an abstract artist, I&rsquo;d be doing a little bit more of what the brain does, where if</p>
<p>I took a pen, pad and paper, maybe I could do this because I&rsquo;m a terrible artist and I could just</p>
<p>mix it up. And I, let&rsquo;s say I would make your eyes like water bottles, but I&rsquo;d flip them upside down</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d start assigning fruits and objects to the different features of your face. And I show it to</p>
<p>you, I say, Lex, that&rsquo;s you say, well, that&rsquo;s not me. And I&rsquo;d say, no, but that&rsquo;s my abstraction</p>
<p>of you. But that&rsquo;s what the brain does. The space time relationship of the neurons that fire that</p>
<p>encode your face has have no resemblance to your face. Right. And I think people don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people have fully internalized that, but the day that I, and I&rsquo;m not sure I</p>
<p>fully internalized that because it&rsquo;s weird to think about, but all neurons can do is fire in</p>
<p>space and in time, different neurons in different sequences, perhaps with different intensities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear. The action potential is all or none. Although people, neuroscientists don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>to talk about that, even though it&rsquo;s been published in nature a couple of times, the</p>
<p>action potential for a given neuron doesn&rsquo;t always have the exact same waveform. People,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in all the textbooks, but you can modify that waveform.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating stuff with neuroscience about the fuzziness of all the,</p>
<p>of the transfer of information from neuron to neuron. I mean, we certainly touch upon it every</p>
<p>time we at all try to think about the difference between artificial neural networks and biological</p>
<p>neural networks. But can we maybe linger a little bit on this, on the circuitry that you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>at? So the brain is just a bunch of stuff firing and it forms abstractions that are fascinating</p>
<p>and beautiful, like layers upon layers upon layers of abstraction. And I think it, just like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re programming, you know, I&rsquo;m programming in Python, it&rsquo;s awe inspiring to think that</p>
<p>underneath it all, it ends up being zeros and ones. And the computer doesn&rsquo;t know about, you know,</p>
<p>stupid Python or Windows or Linux. It only knows about the zeros and ones. In the same way with</p>
<p>the brain, is there something interesting to you or fundamental to you about the circuitry of the</p>
<p>brain that allows for the magic that&rsquo;s in our mind to emerge? How much do we understand? I mean,</p>
<p>maybe even focusing on the vision system, is, is there something specific about the structure of</p>
<p>the vision system, the circuitry of it that allows for the complexity of the vision system to emerge?</p>
<p>Or is it all just the complete chaotic mess that we don&rsquo;t understand?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely not all a chaotic mess that we don&rsquo;t understand, if we&rsquo;re talking about vision.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not just because I&rsquo;m a vision scientist.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stick to vision.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stick to vision. Well, because in the beauty of the visual system, the reason David Hubel and</p>
<p>Torrance and Wiesel won the Nobel prize was because they were brilliant and forward thinking and</p>
<p>adventurous and all that good stuff. But the reason that the visual system is such a great</p>
<p>model for addressing these kinds of questions and other systems are hard, is we can control</p>
<p>the stimuli. We can adjust spatial frequency, how finer the gratings are, thick gratings,</p>
<p>thin gratings. We can adjust temporal frequency, how fast things are moving. We can use cone</p>
<p>isolating stimuli. We can use it. There&rsquo;s so many things that you can do in a controlled way.</p>
<p>Whereas if we were talking about cognitive encoding, like encoding the space of concepts</p>
<p>or something. I, like you, if I may, am drawn to the big questions.</p>
<p>The big questions in neuroscience. But I confess in part because of some good advice I got early</p>
<p>in my career and in part because I&rsquo;m not perhaps smart enough to go after the really high level</p>
<p>stuff. I also like to address things that are tractable and we need to address what we can</p>
<p>stand to make some ground on at a given time.</p>
<p>There you can construct brilliant controlled experiments to study, to really literally</p>
<p>answer questions about, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I&rsquo;m happy to have a talk about consciousness, but it&rsquo;s a scary talk. And I</p>
<p>think most people don&rsquo;t want to hear what I have to say, which is, we can save that for later,</p>
<p>perhaps.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an interesting question of, we talk about psychedelics. We can talk about</p>
<p>consciousness. We can talk about cognition. Can experiments in neuroscience be constructed</p>
<p>to shed any kind of light on these questions?</p>
<p>So, I mean, it&rsquo;s cool that vision, I mean, to me, vision is probably one of the most beautiful</p>
<p>things about human beings. Also from the AI side, computer vision has some of the most</p>
<p>exciting applications of neural networks is in computer vision. But it feels like that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a neighbor of cognition and consciousness. It&rsquo;s just that we maybe haven&rsquo;t come up with</p>
<p>experiments to study those yet.</p>
<p>Yeah. The visual system is amazing. We&rsquo;re mostly visual animals to navigate,</p>
<p>survive. Humans mainly rely on vision, not smell or something else, but it&rsquo;s a filter</p>
<p>for cognition and it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a strong driver of cognition. Maybe just cause it came up and</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re moving to higher level concepts. Just the way the visual system works can be</p>
<p>summarized in it in a few relatively succinct statements. Unlike most of what I&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>which has not been succinct at all.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>You know, the retina, yeah. So the retina is this three layers of neuron structure at the</p>
<p>back of your eye. It&rsquo;s about as thick as a credit card. It is a piece of your brain.</p>
<p>And sometimes people think I&rsquo;m kind of wriggling by out of a reality by saying that it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely a piece of the brain. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a forebrain structure that in the first</p>
<p>trimester, there&rsquo;s a genetic program that made sure that that neural retina, which is part of</p>
<p>your central nervous system was squeezed out into what&rsquo;s called the embryonic eye cups.</p>
<p>And that the bone formed with a little hole where the optic nerve is going to connect</p>
<p>it to the rest of the brain. And those, that window into the world is the only window into</p>
<p>the world for a, for a mammal, which has a thick skull. Birds have a thin skull. So their pineal</p>
<p>gland sits and lizards too, and snakes actually have a hole so that light can make it down into</p>
<p>the pineal directly. And in train melatonin rhythms for time of day and time of year,</p>
<p>humans have to do all that through the eyes. So three layers of neurons that are a piece of your</p>
<p>brain, their central nervous system, and the optic nerve connects to the rest of the brain,</p>
<p>the neurons in the eye, somewhat just care about luminance, just how bright or dim it is.</p>
<p>And they inform the brain about time of day. And then the central circadian clock informs every</p>
<p>cell in your body about time of day and make sure that all sorts of good stuff happens. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting light in your eyes at the right times and all sorts of bad things happen. If you are getting</p>
<p>light randomly throughout the 24 hour cycle, we could talk about all that, but this is a good</p>
<p>incentive for keeping a relatively normal schedule, consistent schedule, light exposure,</p>
<p>consistent schedule, try and keep a consistent schedule. When you&rsquo;re young, it&rsquo;s easy to go off</p>
<p>schedule and recover. As you get older, it gets harder, but you see everything from outcomes in</p>
<p>cancer patients to diabetes improves when people are getting light at a particular time of day and</p>
<p>getting darkness at a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle. We were designed to get light and</p>
<p>dark at different times of the circadian cycle. All that information is coming in through</p>
<p>specialized type of neuron in the retina called the melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive</p>
<p>ganglion cell discovered by David Berson at Brown University. That&rsquo;s not spatial information. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>subconscious. You don&rsquo;t think, Oh, it&rsquo;s daytime. Even if you&rsquo;re looking at the sun, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter. It&rsquo;s a photon counter. It&rsquo;s literally counting photons. And it&rsquo;s saying, Oh, even</p>
<p>though it&rsquo;s a cloudy day, lots of photons coming in at winter in Boston, it must be winter. And</p>
<p>your system is a little depressed. It&rsquo;s spring. You feel alert. That&rsquo;s not a coincidence. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these melanopsin cells signaling the circadian clock. There are a bunch of other neurons in the</p>
<p>eye that signal to the brain and they mainly signal the presence of things that are lighter</p>
<p>than background or darker than background. So a black objects would be darker than background,</p>
<p>a light object lighter than background. And that all come, it&rsquo;s mainly it&rsquo;s looking at pixels.</p>
<p>Mainly it&rsquo;s they look at circles and those neurons have receptive fields,</p>
<p>which not everyone will understand, but those neurons respond best to little circles of dark</p>
<p>light or little circles of bright light, little circles of red light versus little circles of</p>
<p>green light or blue light. And so it sounds very basic. It&rsquo;s like red, green, blue and circles</p>
<p>brighter or dimmer than what&rsquo;s next to it. But that&rsquo;s basically the only information that sent</p>
<p>down the optic nerve. And when we say information, we can be very precise. I don&rsquo;t mean little bits</p>
<p>of red traveling down the optic nerve. I mean, spikes neural action potentials in space and time,</p>
<p>which for you is like makes total sense. But I think for a lot of people, it&rsquo;s actually beautiful</p>
<p>to think about all that information in the outside world is converted into a language</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very simple. It&rsquo;s just like a few syllables, if you will. And those syllables</p>
<p>are being shouted down the optic nerve, converted into a totally different language, like Morse code</p>
<p>goes into the brain. And then the thalamus essentially responds in the same way that</p>
<p>the retina does, except the thalamus is also waiting things. It&rsquo;s saying, you know what,</p>
<p>that thing was moving faster than everything else, or it&rsquo;s brighter than everything else.</p>
<p>So that signal I&rsquo;m going to get up, I&rsquo;m going to allow up to cortex or that signal is much</p>
<p>redder than it is green. So I&rsquo;m going to let that signal go through that signal as much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of more like the red next to it. Throw that out. The information just doesn&rsquo;t get up into</p>
<p>your cortex. And then in cortex, of course, is where perceptions happen. And in V1, if you will,</p>
<p>visual area one, but also some neighboring areas, you start getting representations of</p>
<p>things like oriented lines. So there&rsquo;s a neuron that responds to this angle of my hand versus</p>
<p>vertical. This is the defining work of Hubel and Wiesel&rsquo;s Nobel. And it&rsquo;s a very systematic map</p>
<p>of orientation, line orientation, direction of movement, and so forth. And that&rsquo;s pretty much,</p>
<p>and color, and that&rsquo;s how the visual system is organized all the way up to the cortex.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hierarchical. I want to be clear. It&rsquo;s hierarchical because you don&rsquo;t build up that line</p>
<p>by suddenly having a neuron that responds to lines in some random way. It responds to lines</p>
<p>by taking all the dots that are aligned in a vertical stack, and they all converge on one</p>
<p>neuron. And then that neuron responds to vertical lines. So it&rsquo;s not random. There&rsquo;s no abstraction</p>
<p>at that point, in fact. In fact, if I showed you a black line, I could be sure that if I</p>
<p>were imaging V1, that I would see a representation of that black line as a vertical line somewhere in</p>
<p>your cortex. So at that point, it&rsquo;s absolutely concrete. It&rsquo;s not abstract. But then things get</p>
<p>really mysterious. Some of that information travels further up into the cortex and goes from</p>
<p>one visual area to the next, to the next, to the next, so that by time you get into an area that</p>
<p>Nancy Kanwisher at MIT has studied much of her career, the fusiform face area, you start finding</p>
<p>single neurons that respond only to your father&rsquo;s face or to Joe Rogan&rsquo;s face, regardless of the</p>
<p>orientation of his face. I&rsquo;m sure if you saw Joe, because you know him well, from across the room</p>
<p>and you just saw his profile, you&rsquo;d be like, oh, that&rsquo;s Joe. Walk over and say hello.</p>
<p>The orientation of his face isn&rsquo;t there. You wouldn&rsquo;t even see his eyes necessarily,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s represented in some abstract way by a neuron that actually would be called the Joe</p>
<p>Rogan neuron. He might have limits. I might not recognize him if he was upside down or</p>
<p>something like that. It&rsquo;d be fascinating to see what the limits of that Joe Rogan concept is.</p>
<p>So Nancy&rsquo;s lab has done that because early on she was challenged by people that said</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t face neurons. There are neurons that they only respond to space and time,</p>
<p>shapes and things like that, moving in particular directions and orientations. It turns out</p>
<p>Nancy was right. They use these stimuli called greeble stimuli, which any computer programmer</p>
<p>would appreciate, which kind of morphs a face into something gradually that eventually just</p>
<p>looks like this alien thing they call the greeble. The neurons don&rsquo;t respond to greebles.</p>
<p>In most cases, they only respond to faces and familiar faces. Anyway, I&rsquo;m summarizing a lot</p>
<p>of literature and forgive me, Nancy, and for those of the greeble people, if they&rsquo;re ours,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, don&rsquo;t come after me with pitchforks. Actually, you know what? Come after me with</p>
<p>pitchforks. I think you know what I&rsquo;m trying to do here. So the point is that in the visual system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very concrete up until about visual area four, which has color pinwheels and seems to</p>
<p>respond to pinwheels of colors. And so the stimuli become more and more elaborate, but at some point</p>
<p>you depart that concrete representation and you start getting abstract representations that can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be explained by simple point to point wiring. And to take a leap out of the visual system to</p>
<p>the higher level concepts, what we talked about in the visual system maps to the auditory system</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re encoding what? Frequency of tone sweeps. So this is going to sound weird to do,</p>
<p>but you know, like a Doppler, like hearing something, a car passing by, for instance,</p>
<p>but at some point you get into motifs of music that can&rsquo;t be mapped to just a, what they call a</p>
<p>tonotopic map of frequency. You start abstracting. And if you start thinking about concepts of</p>
<p>creativity and love and memory, like what is the map of memory space? Well, your memories are very</p>
<p>different than mine, but presumably there&rsquo;s enough structure at the early stages of memory processing</p>
<p>or at the early stages of emotional processing or at the earlier stages of creative processing</p>
<p>that you have the building blocks, your zeros and ones, if you will,</p>
<p>but you depart from that eventually. Now the exception to this, and I want to be really clear</p>
<p>because I was just mainly talking about neocortex, the six layered structure on the outside of the</p>
<p>brain that explains a lot of human abilities, other animals have them too, is that subcortical</p>
<p>structures are a lot more like machines. It&rsquo;s more plug and chug. And what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>is the machinery that controls heart rate and breathing and receptive fields, neurons that</p>
<p>respond to things like temperature on the top of my left hand. I came into neuroscience from</p>
<p>more of a perspective initially of psychology, but one of the reasons I forced upon myself to learn</p>
<p>some electrophysiology, not a ton, but enough, and some molecular biology and about circuitry</p>
<p>is that one of the most beautiful experiences you can have in life, I&rsquo;m convinced, is to lower</p>
<p>an electrode into the cortex and to show a person or an animal, we do this ethically of course,</p>
<p>stimulus like an oriented line or a face. And you can convert the recordings coming off of</p>
<p>that electrode into an audio signal or an audio monitor, and you can hear what they call hash.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the hash you smoke, it&rsquo;s the hash you hear. And it sounds like, it just sounds like</p>
<p>noise. And in the cortex, eventually you find a stimulus that gets the neuron to spike and</p>
<p>fire action potentials that are converted into an auditory stimulus that are very concrete,</p>
<p>crack, crack, crack, sounds like a bat cracking, like home runs or outfield balls.</p>
<p>When you drop electrodes deeper into the thalamus or into the hypothalamus or into the brainstem</p>
<p>areas that control breathing, it&rsquo;s like a machine. You never hear hash. You drop the electrode down.</p>
<p>This could be like a grungy old Tugston electrode, not high fidelity electrode, as long as it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>a little bit of insulation on it. You plug it into an audio monitor, it&rsquo;s picking up electricity.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a visual neuron and it&rsquo;s in the thalamus or the retina and you walk in front</p>
<p>of that animal or person, that neuron goes, and then you walk away and it stops. And you put your</p>
<p>hand in front of the eye again and it goes, and you could do that for two days. And that neuron</p>
<p>will just, every time there&rsquo;s a stimulus, it fires. So whereas before, it&rsquo;s a question of</p>
<p>how much information is getting up to cortex. And then these abstractions happening where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re creating these ideas, when you go subcortical, everything is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no abstraction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two plus two equals four. There&rsquo;s no abstractions. And this is why I know we have</p>
<p>some common friends at Neuralink and I love the demonstration they did recently. I&rsquo;m a huge fan</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re doing and where they&rsquo;re headed. And no, I don&rsquo;t get paid to say that. And I have</p>
<p>no business relationship to them. I&rsquo;m just a huge fan of the people in the mission.</p>
<p>But my question was to some of them, when are you going to go subcortical? Because if you want to</p>
<p>control an animal, you don&rsquo;t do it in the cortex. The cortex is like the abstract painting I made</p>
<p>of your face. Removing one piece or changing something may or may not matter for the abstraction.</p>
<p>But when you are in the subcortical areas of the brain, a stimulating electrode can</p>
<p>evoke an entire behavior or an entire state. And so the brain, if we&rsquo;re going to have a</p>
<p>discussion about the brain and how the brain works, we need to really be clear which brain,</p>
<p>because everyone loves neocortex. It&rsquo;s like, oh, canonical circuits in cortex. We&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>the cortical connectome. And sure, necessary, but not sufficient. Not to be able to plug in</p>
<p>patterns of electrical stimulation and get behavior. Eventually we&rsquo;ll get there. But if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking subcortical circuits, that&rsquo;s where the action is. That&rsquo;s where you could potentially</p>
<p>cure Parkinson&rsquo;s by stimulating the subthalamic nucleus, because we know that it gates motor</p>
<p>activation patterns in very predictable ways. So I think for those that are interested in</p>
<p>neuroscience, it pays to pay attention to like, is this a circuit that abstracts the sensory</p>
<p>information? Or is it just one that builds up hierarchical models in a very predictable way?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a huge chasm in neuroscience right now, because there&rsquo;s no conceptual</p>
<p>leadership. No one knows which way to go. And this is why I think Neuralink has captured an</p>
<p>amazing opportunity, which was, okay, well, while all you academic research labs are figuring all</p>
<p>this stuff out, we&rsquo;re going to pick a very specific goal and make the goal, the end point. And some</p>
<p>academic laboratories do that, but I think that&rsquo;s a beautiful way to attack this whole thing about</p>
<p>the brain, because it&rsquo;s very concrete. Let&rsquo;s restore motion to the Parkinsonian patient.</p>
<p>Academic labs want to do that too, of course. Let&rsquo;s restore speech to the stroke patient.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing abstract about that. That&rsquo;s about figuring out the solution to a particular</p>
<p>problem. So anyway, those are my&hellip; And I admit I&rsquo;ve mixed in a lot of opinion there,</p>
<p>but having spent some time, like 25 years digging around in the brain and listening to neurons</p>
<p>firing and looking at them anatomically, I think given it&rsquo;s 2020, we need to ask the right&hellip; The</p>
<p>way to get better answers is ask better questions. And the really high level stuff is fun. It makes</p>
<p>for good conversation and it has brought enormous interest. But I think the questions about</p>
<p>consciousness and dreaming and stuff, they&rsquo;re fascinating, but I don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;re there yet.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying there might be a chasm in the two views of the power of the brain arising from</p>
<p>the circuitry that forms abstractions or the power of the brain arising from the majority</p>
<p>of the circuitry that&rsquo;s just doing very brute force, dumb things that don&rsquo;t have any fancy</p>
<p>kind of stuff going on. That&rsquo;s really interesting to think about.</p>
<p>And which one to go after first. And here I&rsquo;m poaching badly from someone I&rsquo;ve never met,</p>
<p>but whose work I follow, which is, and it was actually on your podcast. I think Elon Musk</p>
<p>said, basically the brain is a, I want to say a monkey brain with a supercomputer on top.</p>
<p>And I thought that&rsquo;s actually probably the best description of the brain I&rsquo;ve ever heard because</p>
<p>it captures a lot of important features like limbic friction. But we think of like, oh,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re making plans, we&rsquo;re using the prefrontal cortex and we&rsquo;re executive function</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff. But think about the drug addict who&rsquo;s driven to go pursue</p>
<p>heroin or cocaine. They make plans. So clearly they use their frontal cortex. It&rsquo;s just that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been hijacked by the limbic system and all the monkey brain as he referred to. It&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>not fair to monkeys though, Elon, because actually monkeys can make plans. They just don&rsquo;t make plans</p>
<p>as sophisticated as us. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time with monkeys, but I&rsquo;ve also spent a lot of time</p>
<p>with humans. Anyway, you&rsquo;re saying like, there&rsquo;s a lot of value to focusing on the monkey brain</p>
<p>or whatever the heck you call it. I do because let&rsquo;s say I had an ability to place a chip anywhere</p>
<p>I wanted in the brain today and activate it or inhibit that area. I&rsquo;m not sure I would put that</p>
<p>chip in neocortex, except maybe to just kind of have some fun and see what happens. The reason</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s an abstraction machine. And especially if I wanted to make a mass production tool,</p>
<p>a tool in mass production that I could give to a lot of people, because it&rsquo;s quite possible that</p>
<p>your abstractions are different enough than mine that I wouldn&rsquo;t know what patterns of firing to</p>
<p>induce. But if I want, let&rsquo;s say I want to increase my level of focus and creativity. Well, then I</p>
<p>would love to be able to, for instance, control my level of limbic friction. I would love to be</p>
<p>able to wake up and go, Oh, you know what? I have an eight o clock appointment. I wake up slowly.</p>
<p>So between seven, eight, but I want to do a lot of linear thinking. So you know what? I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>just, I&rsquo;m going to turn down the limbic friction and or ramp up prefrontal cortexes activation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that can happen in the thalamus with sensory gating. For instance,</p>
<p>you could shut down that shell around the thalamus and allow more creative thinking by allowing more</p>
<p>lateral connections. These would be some of the, those would be the experiments I&rsquo;d want to do.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re in the subcortical quote unquote monkey brain, but you could then look at what sorts of</p>
<p>abstract thoughts and behaviors would arise from that rather than, and here I&rsquo;m not pointing my</p>
<p>finger at neural link at all, but there&rsquo;s this obsession with neocortex, but I, I&rsquo;m going to,</p>
<p>well, I might lose a few friends, but I&rsquo;ll hopefully gain a few. And also one of the</p>
<p>reasons people spend so much time in neocortex. Yes. I have a fact and an opinion. One fact is</p>
<p>that you can image there and you can record there right now, the two photon and one photon microscopy</p>
<p>methods that allow you to image deep into the brain still don&rsquo;t allow you to image down really</p>
<p>deep unless you&rsquo;re jamming prisms in there and endoscopes. And then the endoscopes are very</p>
<p>narrow. So you&rsquo;re getting very, you know, it&rsquo;s like looking at the bottom of the ocean through a,</p>
<p>through a spotlight. And so you much easier look at the waves up on top. Right. So let&rsquo;s face it,</p>
<p>folks. A lot of the reasons why there&rsquo;s so many recordings in layer two, three of cortex with all</p>
<p>this advanced microscopy is because it&rsquo;s very hard to image deeper. Now the microscopes are getting</p>
<p>better and thanks to the amazing work, mainly of engineers and chemists and physicists. Let&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>it. They&rsquo;re the ones who brought this revolution to neuroscience in the last 10 years or so.</p>
<p>You can image deeper, but we don&rsquo;t really, that&rsquo;s why you see so many reports on layer two, three.</p>
<p>The other thing, which is purely opinion, and I&rsquo;m not going after anybody here, but is that</p>
<p>as long as there&rsquo;s no clear right answer, it becomes a little easier to do creative work</p>
<p>in a structure where no one really knows how it works. So it&rsquo;s fun to probe around because anything</p>
<p>you see is novel. If you&rsquo;re going to work in the thalamus or the pulvinar or the hypothalamus or</p>
<p>these structures that have been known about since the sixties and seventies, and really since the,</p>
<p>you know, centuries ago, you are dealing with existing, you have to combat existing models.</p>
<p>And whereas in cortex, no one knows how the thing works, the neocortex, six layer cortex.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot more room for discovery. There&rsquo;s a lot more room for discovery and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not calling anyone out. I love cortex. We&rsquo;ve published some papers on cortex. It&rsquo;s super</p>
<p>interesting. But I think with the tools that are available nowadays and where people are trying</p>
<p>ahead of, of not just reading from the brain, monitoring activity, but writing to the brain,</p>
<p>I think we really have to be careful and we need to be thoughtful about what are we trying to write?</p>
<p>What script are we trying to write? Because there are many brain structures for which we already</p>
<p>know what scripts they write. And I think there&rsquo;s tremendous value there. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s boring.</p>
<p>The fact that they act like machines makes them predictable. Those are your zeros and ones.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start there. But let the, what they&rsquo;re, what&rsquo;s sort of happening in this field of writing</p>
<p>to the brain is there&rsquo;s this idea. And again, I want to be clear. I&rsquo;m not pointing at Neuralink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mainly pointing at the neocortical jockeys out there that you go and you observe patterns.</p>
<p>And then you think replaying those patterns is going to give rise to something interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah. I should call out one experiment or two experiments, which were done by Susumu</p>
<p>Tonagawa, Nobel prize winner from MIT, done important work in memory and immunology,</p>
<p>of course, is where he got his Nobel as well as Mark Mayford&rsquo;s lab at UC San Diego.</p>
<p>They did an experiment where they monitored a bunch of neurons while an animal learned something.</p>
<p>Then they captured those neurons through some molecular tricks so they could replay the neurons.</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s like perfect case scenario. It&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>you monitor the neurons in your brain. Then I say, okay, neurons one through 100 were played</p>
<p>in the particular sequence. So, you know, the space time, you know, the keys on the piano that</p>
<p>were played that gave rise to the song, which was the behavior. And then you go back and you</p>
<p>reactivate those neurons, except you reactivate them all at once, like slamming on all the keys</p>
<p>once on the piano and you get the exact same behavior. So the space time code</p>
<p>may be meaningless for some structures. Now that&rsquo;s freaky. That&rsquo;s a scary thing because what that</p>
<p>means is that all the space time firing in cortex, the space part may matter more than the time part.</p>
<p>So, you know, rate codes and space time codes, we don&rsquo;t know. And, you know, I&rsquo;d rather have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather deliver more answers in this discussion questions, but I think it&rsquo;s an important</p>
<p>consideration. You&rsquo;re saying some of the magic is in the early stages of what the closer to the</p>
<p>raw information. I believe so. You know, the stimulus, you know, the neuron that encodes</p>
<p>that stimulus. So, you know, the transformation. When I say this for those who don&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>sensory transformations, it&rsquo;s like, I can show you a red circle. And then I look at how many times</p>
<p>the neuron fires in response to that red circle. And then I could show the red circle a bunch of</p>
<p>times, green circle, see if it changes. And then essentially the number of times that is the</p>
<p>transformation. You&rsquo;ve converted red circle into like three action potentials, you know, beep, beep,</p>
<p>beep, or whatever you want to call it, you know, for those that think in sound space.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve created, you know, the transformation and you march up the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the neuro axis as you go from the periphery up into the cortex. And we know that,</p>
<p>and I know Lisa Feldman Barrett, or is it Barrett Feldman? Barrett Feldman, excuse me,</p>
<p>Lisa, that talked a lot about this, that, you know, birds can do sophisticated things and whatnot as</p>
<p>well, but humans, there&rsquo;s a strong, what we call cephalization. A lot of the processing</p>
<p>has moved up into the cortex and out of these subcortical areas, but it happens nonetheless.</p>
<p>And so as long as you know the transformations, you are in a perfect place to build machines</p>
<p>or add machines to the brain that exactly mimic what the brain wants to do, which is take events</p>
<p>in the environment and turn them into internal firing of neurons.</p>
<p>So the mastery of the brain can happen at their early level. You know, another perspective of it</p>
<p>is you saying this means that humans aren&rsquo;t that special. If we look at the evolutionary time scale,</p>
<p>the leap to intelligence is not that special. So like the extra layers of abstraction</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t where most of the magic happens of intelligence, which gives me hope that maybe,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s true, that means the evolution of intelligence is not that rare of an event.</p>
<p>I certainly hope not.</p>
<p>Oh, so you hope there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I hope there are other forms of intelligence. I mean, I think what humans are really good at,</p>
<p>and here I want to be clear that this is not a formal model, but what humans are really good at</p>
<p>is taking that plasma barbell that we were talking about earlier and not just using it for analysis</p>
<p>of space, like the intermediate environment, but also using historical information. Like I can read</p>
<p>a book today about the history of medicine. I happen to be doing that lately for some stuff</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m researching and I can take that information and if I want, I can inject it into my plans for</p>
<p>the future. Other animals don&rsquo;t seem to do that over the same time scales that we do. Now,</p>
<p>it may be that the chipmunks are all hiding little notebooks everywhere in the form of little dirt</p>
<p>castles or something that we don&rsquo;t understand. I mean, the waggle dance of the bee is in the most</p>
<p>famous example. Bees come back to the hive, they orient relative to the honeycomb and they waggle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy down in Australia named Serena Vasson who studied this. It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>No one really understands it except he understands it best. The bee waggles in a couple of ways</p>
<p>relative to the orientation of the honeycomb and then all the other bees see that it&rsquo;s visual and</p>
<p>they go out and they know the exact coordinate system to get to the source of whatever it was,</p>
<p>the food and bring it back. He&rsquo;s done it where they isolate the bees, he&rsquo;s changed the visual</p>
<p>flight environment, all this stuff. They are communicating and they&rsquo;re communicating something</p>
<p>about something they saw recently, but it doesn&rsquo;t extend over very long periods of time.</p>
<p>The same way that you and I can both read a book or you can recommend something to me and then we</p>
<p>could converge on a set of ideas later. And in fairness, because she was the one that said it</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t and I hadn&rsquo;t even thought of it, when you talk to Lisa on your podcast,</p>
<p>she brought up something beautiful, which is that it never really occurred to me and I was</p>
<p>sort of embarrassed that it hadn&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s really beautiful and brilliant, which is that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t just encode senses in the form of like color and light and sound waves and taste,</p>
<p>but ideas become a form of sensory mapping. And that&rsquo;s where the really, really cool and</p>
<p>exciting stuff is, but we just don&rsquo;t understand what the receptive fields are for ideas. What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an idea receptive field? And how they&rsquo;re communicated</p>
<p>between humans because we seem to be able to encode those ideas in some kind of way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be able to encode those ideas in some kind of way. Yes, it&rsquo;s taking all the raw information</p>
<p>and the internal physical states, that sensory information put into this concept blob that we</p>
<p>cut in the store and then we&rsquo;re able to communicate that. Yeah, your abstractions are different than</p>
<p>mine. I actually think the comment section on social media is a beautiful example of where</p>
<p>the abstractions are different for different people. So much of the misunderstanding of the</p>
<p>world is because of these idea receptive fields, they&rsquo;re not the same. Whereas I can look at a</p>
<p>photoreceptor neuron or olfactory neuron or a V1 neuron, and I am certain, I would bet my life</p>
<p>that yours look and respond exactly the same way that Lisa&rsquo;s do and mine do. But once you get</p>
<p>beyond there, it gets tricky. And so when you say something or I say something and somebody gets</p>
<p>upset about it or even happy about it, their concept of that might be quite a bit different.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really know what you mean. They only know what it means to them.</p>
<p>Yeah. So from a neural link perspective, it makes sense to optimize the control and the</p>
<p>augmentation of the more primitive circuitry. So like the stuff that is closer to the raw sensory</p>
<p>information. Go deeper. If they, I think, go deeper into the brain. And to be fair,</p>
<p>so Matt McDougall, who&rsquo;s a neurosurgeon at Neuralink and also a clinical nurse, a great guy,</p>
<p>brilliant. They have amazing people. I have to give it to them. They&rsquo;ve been very cryptic in</p>
<p>recent years. Their website was just like nothing there. They really know how to do things with</p>
<p>style. And they&rsquo;ve upset a lot of people, but that&rsquo;s good too. But Matt is there. I know Matt,</p>
<p>he actually came up through my lab at Stanford, although he was a neurosurgery resume. He spent</p>
<p>time in our lab. He actually came out on the shark dive and did great white shark diving with my lab</p>
<p>to collect the VR that we use in our fear stuff. I&rsquo;ve talked to Matt and I think he and other folks</p>
<p>there are hungry for the deeper brain structures. The problem is that damn vasculature, all that</p>
<p>blood supply. It&rsquo;s not trivial to get through and down into the brain without damaging the</p>
<p>vasculature in the neocortex, which is on the outer crust. But once you start getting into</p>
<p>the thalamus and closer to some of the main arterial sources, you really risk getting massive</p>
<p>bleeds. And so it&rsquo;s an issue that can be worked out. It just is hard. Maybe it&rsquo;d be nice to educate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my ignorance. So the smart stuff is on the surface. So I didn&rsquo;t realize this. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite realize because you keep saying deep. Yeah. So like the early stages are deep.</p>
<p>Yeah. So in actual, physically in the brain. Yeah. So the way that, of course you got your</p>
<p>deep brain structures, they&rsquo;re involved in breathing and heart rate and kind of lizard</p>
<p>brain stuff. And then on top of that, this is the model of the brain that no one really subscribes</p>
<p>to anymore, but anatomically it works. And then on top in mammals. And then on top of that,</p>
<p>you have the limbic structures, which gate sensory information and decide whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to listen to something more than you&rsquo;re going to look at it, or you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>split your attention to both kind of sensory allocation stuff. And then the neocortex is on</p>
<p>the outside. And that is where you get a lot of this abstraction stuff. And now not all cortical</p>
<p>areas are doing abstraction. Some like visual area one, auditory area one, they&rsquo;re just doing</p>
<p>concrete representations. But as you get into the higher order stuff, that when you start hearing</p>
<p>names like inferoparietal cortex, and when you start hearing multiple names in the same, then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about higher order areas. But actually there&rsquo;s an important experiment that</p>
<p>drives a lot of what people want to do with brain machine interface. And that&rsquo;s the work of Bill</p>
<p>Newsome, who is at Stanford and Tony Movshin, who runs the Center for Neuroscience at NYU.</p>
<p>This is a wild experiment. And I think it might freak a few people out if they really think about</p>
<p>it too deeply. But anyway, here it goes. There&rsquo;s an area called MT in the cortex. And if I showed</p>
<p>you a bunch of dots all moving up, and this is what Tony and Bill and some of the other people</p>
<p>in that lab did way back when, is they show a bunch of dots moving up. Somewhere in MT,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some neurons that respond. They fire when the neurons move up. And then what they did is</p>
<p>they started varying the coherence of that motion. So they made it so only 50% of the dots moved up</p>
<p>and the rest move randomly. And that neuron fires a little less. And eventually it&rsquo;s random and that</p>
<p>neuron stops firing because it&rsquo;s just kind of dots moving everywhere. It&rsquo;s awesome. And there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>systematic map so that other neurons are responding and things moving down and other things responding</p>
<p>left and other things moving right. Okay. So there&rsquo;s a map of direction space. Okay, well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great. You could lesion MT, animals lose the ability to do these kind of coherence</p>
<p>discrimination or direction discrimination. But the amazing experiment, the one that just</p>
<p>is kind of eerie is that they lowered a stimulating electrode into MT, found a neuron</p>
<p>that responds to when dots go up, but then they silence that neuron. And sure enough,</p>
<p>the animal doesn&rsquo;t recognize the neurons are going up and then they move the dots down.</p>
<p>They stimulate the neuron that responds to things moving up and the animal responds because it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak. It responds by doing a lever press, which says the dots are moving up. So in other words,</p>
<p>the sensory, the dots are moving down in reality on the computer screen. They&rsquo;re stimulating the</p>
<p>neuron that responds to dots moving up. And the perception of the animal is that dots are moving</p>
<p>up, which tells you that your perception of external reality absolutely has to be a neuronal</p>
<p>abstraction. It is not tacked to the movement of the dots in any absolute way. Your perception</p>
<p>of the outside world depends entirely on the activation patterns of neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>And you can hear that and say, well, duh, because if I stimulate the stretch reflex and you kick or</p>
<p>something or whatever, the knee reflex and you kick, of course, there&rsquo;s a neuron that triggers</p>
<p>that, but it didn&rsquo;t have to be that way. Because A, the animal had prior experience, B, you&rsquo;re way</p>
<p>up in the higher order cortical areas. What this means is that, and I generally try and avoid</p>
<p>conversations about this kind of thing, but what this means is that we are constructing our reality</p>
<p>with this space time firing the zeros and ones. And it doesn&rsquo;t have to have anything to do with</p>
<p>the actual reality. And the animal or person can be absolutely convinced that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening. Are you familiar with the work of Donald Hoffman? So he makes an evolutionary argument</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not important of that. We, our brains are completely detached from reality in the sense that</p>
<p>he makes a radical case that we have no idea what physical reality is. And in fact,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s drastically different than what we think it is. So he goes, that&rsquo;s scary. So he doesn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s just, cause you&rsquo;re kind of implying there&rsquo;s a gap. There might be a gap with constructing</p>
<p>an illusion and then maybe using communication to maybe create a consistency that&rsquo;s sufficient for</p>
<p>human collaboration or whatever, or mammal, you know, just maybe even just life forms constructing</p>
<p>a consistent reality that&rsquo;s maybe detached. I mean, that&rsquo;s really cool that neurons are constructing</p>
<p>that, like that you can prove that this is when neuroscience at its best vision science. But he</p>
<p>says that like our brain is actually just lost its shit on the, on the, on the path of evolution to</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re normal. We&rsquo;re just playing games with each other in constructing realities that allow</p>
<p>our survival. But it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s completely detached from physical reality. We&rsquo;re missing a</p>
<p>lot. We&rsquo;re missing like most of it, if not all of it. Well, this was, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s fascinating because</p>
<p>I just saw the Oliver Sacks documentary. There&rsquo;s a new documentary out about his life. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this one part where he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve spent part of my life trying to imagine what it would like to be,</p>
<p>be, to be a bat or something, to see the world through the life, the sensory apparatus of a bat.</p>
<p>And he did this with his, these patients that were locked into these horrible syndromes that</p>
<p>to pull out some of the, the beauty of their experience as well, not just communicate the</p>
<p>suffering, although the suffering too. And as I was listening to him talk about this,</p>
<p>I started to realize it&rsquo;s like, well, what, you know, like they&rsquo;re these mantis shrimps that can</p>
<p>see 60 shades of pink or something. And they, they see this stuff all the time and animals,</p>
<p>they can see UV light. Every time I learn about an animal that can sense other things in the</p>
<p>environment that I can&rsquo;t like heat sensing, well, not, I don&rsquo;t crave that experience the same way</p>
<p>Sacks talked about craving that experience, but it does throw another penny in the jar for what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying, which is that it could be that most, if not all of what I perceive and believe</p>
<p>is just a neural fabrication and that for better, for worse, we all agree on enough</p>
<p>of the same neural fabrications in the same time and place that we&rsquo;re able to function.</p>
<p>Not only that, but we agree with the things that are trying to eat us</p>
<p>enough to where we don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t eat us. Meaning like that it&rsquo;s not just us humans,</p>
<p>you know, right?</p>
<p>I see. Because it&rsquo;s interactive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interactive. So like, so like now I think it&rsquo;s a really nice thought experiment.</p>
<p>I think because Donald really frames it in a scientific, like he makes a hard,</p>
<p>like as hard as our discussion has been now, he makes a hard scientific case that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know shit about reality. I think that&rsquo;s a little bit hardcore, but I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hardcore, but I think it&rsquo;s a good thought experiment that kind of cleanses the</p>
<p>palette of the confidence we might have about, because we are operating in this abstraction</p>
<p>space, you know, and, you know, the sensory space, it might be something very different.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think about if you start to go into the realm of Neuralink or</p>
<p>start to talk about just everything that you&rsquo;ve been talking about with dream states and</p>
<p>psychedelics and stuff like that, which part of the, which layer can we control and play</p>
<p>around with to maybe look into a different slice of reality?</p>
<p>I just got to do the experiment. The key is to just do the experiment in the most ethical way</p>
<p>possible. You just, I mean, that&rsquo;s the beauty of experiments. This is why, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wonderful theoretical neuroscience happening now to make predictions. But that&rsquo;s why experimental</p>
<p>science is so wonderful. You can go into the laboratory and poke around in there and be a</p>
<p>brain explorer and listen to and write to neurons. And when you do that, you get answers. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always get the answers you want, but that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s the beauty of it. When you were</p>
<p>saying this thing about reality and the Donald Hoffman model, I was thinking about children,</p>
<p>you know, like when I have an older sister, she&rsquo;s very sane. But when she was a kid, she had an</p>
<p>imaginary friend and she would play with this imaginary friend. And it had, there was this</p>
<p>whole, there was a consistency. This friend was like, it was Larry lived in a purple house.</p>
<p>Larry was a girl. It was like all this stuff that a child, a young child wouldn&rsquo;t have any issue</p>
<p>with. And then one day she announced that Larry had died. Right. And it wasn&rsquo;t traumatic or</p>
<p>traumatic and that was it. And she just stopped. And I always wonder what that neuro developmental</p>
<p>event was that kept her out of a psychiatric ward had she kept that imaginary friend. But it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>there was something kind of sad to it. I think the way it was told to me, cause I&rsquo;m the younger</p>
<p>brother, I didn&rsquo;t, I wasn&rsquo;t around for that. But my, my dad told me that, you know, there was a</p>
<p>kind of a sadness because it was this beautiful reality that had been constructed. And so we kind</p>
<p>of won. I wonder as you&rsquo;re telling me this, whether or not, you know, as adults, we try and</p>
<p>create as much reality for children as we can so that they can make predictions and feel safe</p>
<p>because the ability to make predictions is a lot of what keeps our autonomic arousal in check. I</p>
<p>mean, we go to sleep every night and we give up total control and that should frighten us deeply.</p>
<p>But you know, unfortunately, autonomic arousal, the yanks us down under and we don&rsquo;t negotiate</p>
<p>too much. So you sleep sooner or later. I don&rsquo;t know. I was a little worried. We get into</p>
<p>discussions about the nature of reality because I&rsquo;m I it&rsquo;s interesting in the laboratory. I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>very much like, what&rsquo;s the experiment? What would the, you know, what&rsquo;s the analysis going to look</p>
<p>like? What mutant mouse are we going to use? What, what, what experience are we going to put</p>
<p>someone through? But I think it&rsquo;s wonderful that in 2020, we can finally have discussions about</p>
<p>this stuff and look, kind of peek around the corner and say, well, Neuralink and people,</p>
<p>others who are doing similar things are going to figure it out. They&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>the answers will show up and we just have to be open to interpretation.</p>
<p>Do you think there could be an experiment centered around consciousness? I mean,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re plugged into the neuroscience community. I think for the longest time, the quote unquote</p>
<p>C word was totally not, was almost anti scientific, but now more and more people are</p>
<p>talking about consciousness. Elon is talking about consciousness. AI folks are talking about</p>
<p>consciousness. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s still nobody knows anything, but it feels like a legitimate domain</p>
<p>of inquiry. That&rsquo;s hungry for a real experiment. So I have fortunately three short answers to</p>
<p>this. The first one is, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not particularly succinct. I agree that the joke</p>
<p>I always tell is there are two things you never want to say to a scientist. One is what do you</p>
<p>do? And the second one is take as much time as you need. And you definitely don&rsquo;t want to say</p>
<p>them in the same sentence. I have three short answers to it. So there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a cynical</p>
<p>answer kind of, and it&rsquo;s not one I enjoy giving, which is that if you look into the seventies and</p>
<p>eight back at the 1970s and 1980s, and even into the early two thousands, there were some very</p>
<p>dynamic, very impressive speakers who are very smart in the field of neuroscience and related</p>
<p>fields who thought hard about the consciousness problem and fell in love with the problem,</p>
<p>but overlook the fact that the technology wasn&rsquo;t there. So I admire them for falling in love with</p>
<p>the problem, but they gleaned tremendous taxpayer resources essentially for nothing. And these</p>
<p>people know who they are. Some of them are alive. Some of them aren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not referring to Francis</p>
<p>Crick, who was brilliant by the way, and thought the claustrum was involved in consciousness,</p>
<p>which I think is a great idea. It&rsquo;s this obscure structure that no one&rsquo;s really studied. People</p>
<p>are now starting to study it. So I think Francis was brilliant and wonderful, but there it, you</p>
<p>know, there were books written about it. It makes for great television stuff and thought</p>
<p>around the table or after a couple of glasses of wine or whatever. It&rsquo;s an important problem</p>
<p>nonetheless. And so I think, I do think the consciousness, the issue is it&rsquo;s not operationally</p>
<p>defined, right? That psychologists are much smarter than a lot of hard scientists in that</p>
<p>for the following reason, they put operational definitions. They know that psychology, if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about motivation, for instance, they know they need to put operational definitions on that</p>
<p>so that two laboratories can know they&rsquo;re studying the same thing. The problem with consciousness is</p>
<p>no one can agree on what that is. And this was a problem for attention when I was coming up. So in</p>
<p>the early two thousands, people would argue, what is attention? Is it spatial attention,</p>
<p>auditory attention? Is it, and finally people were like, you know what, we agree.</p>
<p>Have they agreed on that one?</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>I remember hearing people scream about attention.</p>
<p>Right. They couldn&rsquo;t even agree on attention. So I was coming up as a young graduate student,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking like, I&rsquo;m definitely not going to work on attention and I&rsquo;m definitely not</p>
<p>going to work on consciousness. And I wanted something that I could solve or figure out.</p>
<p>I want to be able to see the circuit or the neurons. I want to be able to hear it on the</p>
<p>audio. I want to record from it. And then I want to do gain a function and loss a function,</p>
<p>take it away, see something change, put it back, see something change in a systematic way.</p>
<p>And that takes you down into the depths of some stuff that&rsquo;s pretty plug and chug, you know,</p>
<p>but you know, I&rsquo;ll borrow from something in the military because I&rsquo;m fortunate to do some work</p>
<p>with units from special operations and they have beautiful language around things because their</p>
<p>world is not abstract. And they talk about three meter targets, 10 meter targets and 100 meter</p>
<p>targets. And it&rsquo;s not an issue of picking the 100 meter target because it&rsquo;s more beautiful</p>
<p>or because it&rsquo;s more interesting. If you don&rsquo;t take down the three meter targets and the 10</p>
<p>meter targets first, you&rsquo;re dead. So that&rsquo;s, I think scientists could pay to, you know, adopt</p>
<p>a more kind of military thinking in that, in that sense. The other thing that is really important is</p>
<p>that just because somebody conceived of something and can talk about it beautifully and can glean a</p>
<p>lot of resources for it, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s led anywhere. So this isn&rsquo;t just true of the</p>
<p>consciousness issue. And I don&rsquo;t want to sound cynical, but I could pull up some names of</p>
<p>molecules that occupied hundreds of articles in the very premier journals that then were later</p>
<p>discovered to be totally moot for that process. And biotech companies folded everyone in the lab</p>
<p>pivots and starts doing something different with that molecule. And nobody talks about it because</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re in the game, we have this thing called anonymous peer review. You can&rsquo;t afford to</p>
<p>piss off anybody too much, unless you have some other funding stream. And I have avoided battles</p>
<p>most of my career, but I pay attention to all of it. And I&rsquo;ve watched this and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ego driven. I think it&rsquo;s that people fall in love with an idea. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough money in science for people to sit back there rubbing their hands together,</p>
<p>you know, the beauty of what Neuralink and Elon and team, cause obviously he&rsquo;s very impressive,</p>
<p>but the team as a whole is really what gives me great confidence in their mission is that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>already got enough money. So it can&rsquo;t be about that. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to need it at a level of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know him, but it doesn&rsquo;t, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to need it at a kind of an ego level or something.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s driven by genuine curiosity and the team that he&rsquo;s assembled include people that are</p>
<p>very kind of abstract neuro neocortex, space time coding people. There are people like Matt,</p>
<p>who is a neurosurgeon. You can&rsquo;t, I mean, you know, you can&rsquo;t BS neurosurgery. Failures in</p>
<p>neurosurgery are not tolerated. So you have to be very good to exceptional to even get through the</p>
<p>gate. And he&rsquo;s exceptional. And then they&rsquo;ve got people like Dan Adams, who was at UCSF for a long</p>
<p>time as a good friend and a known him for years, who is very concrete studied the vasculature in</p>
<p>the eye and how it maps to the vasculature and cortex. When you get a team like that together,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have dissenters. You&rsquo;re going to have people that are high level thinkers,</p>
<p>people that are coders. When you get a team like that, it no longer looks like an academic laboratory</p>
<p>or even a field in science. And so I think they&rsquo;re going to solve some really hard problems.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not here. They don&rsquo;t, you know, I have nothing at stake with them, but I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the solution. You need a bunch of people who don&rsquo;t need first author papers,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t need to complete their PhD, who aren&rsquo;t relying on outside funding, who have a clear</p>
<p>mission. And you have a bunch of people who are basically will adapt to solve the problem.</p>
<p>I like the analogy of the three meter target and the a hundred meter target.</p>
<p>So the folks at Neuralink are basically many of them are some of the best people in the world at</p>
<p>the three meter target. Like you mentioned Matt and neurosurgery, like they&rsquo;re solving real problems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no BS, philosophical smokes and weed and look back and look at the stars. But</p>
<p>so both on Elon and because I think like this, I think it&rsquo;s really important to think about</p>
<p>the hundred meter and the hundred meter is not even a hundred meter, but like</p>
<p>like the stuff behind the hill that&rsquo;s too far away, which is where I put consciousness. Maybe</p>
<p>I tend to believe that consciousness can be engineered. I mean, part of the reason,</p>
<p>part of the business I want to build leverages that idea that consciousness is a lot simpler</p>
<p>than we&rsquo;ve been talking about. Well, if someone can simplify the problem,</p>
<p>right, that will be wonderful. I mean, the reason we can talk about something as abstract as face</p>
<p>representations, infusive form face area is because Nancy Kanwisher had the brilliance</p>
<p>to tie it to the kind of lower level statistics of visual scenes. It wasn&rsquo;t because she was like,</p>
<p>oh, I bet it&rsquo;s there. That wouldn&rsquo;t have been interesting. So people like her understand how</p>
<p>to bridge that gap and they put a tractable definition. So I, so I just, I, that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m begging for in science is a tractable definition. This is what, but I want people</p>
<p>to sit in the, I want people who are really uncomfortable with woo woo, like consciousness,</p>
<p>like high level stuff to sit in that topic and sit uncomfortably because it forces them</p>
<p>to then try to ground and simplify it into something that&rsquo;s concrete because too many</p>
<p>people are just uncomfortable to sit in the consciousness room because there&rsquo;s no definitions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like attention or, or intelligence in the artificial intelligence community. But the reality</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s easy to avoid that room altogether, which is what, I mean, there&rsquo;s analogies to everything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve said with the artificial intelligence community with Minsky and even Alan Turing that</p>
<p>talked about intelligence a lot. And then they drew a lot of funding and then it crashed because</p>
<p>they really didn&rsquo;t do anything with it. And it was a lot of force of personality and so on. But that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean the topic of the Turing test and intelligence isn&rsquo;t something we should sit on</p>
<p>and think like, think like, what is, well, first of all, Turing actually attempted this with the</p>
<p>Turing test. He tried to make concrete this very question of intelligence. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t linger on it. And we shouldn&rsquo;t forget that ultimately that is what our efforts are all</p>
<p>about in the artificial intelligence community. And in the people, whether it&rsquo;s neuroscience or</p>
<p>whatever bigger umbrella you want to use for understanding the mind, the goal is not just</p>
<p>about understanding layer two or three of the vision. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s to understand consciousness</p>
<p>and intelligence and maybe create it or just all the possible biggest questions of our universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s ultimately the dream. Absolutely. And I think what I really</p>
<p>appreciate about what you&rsquo;re saying is that everybody, whether or not they&rsquo;re working on a</p>
<p>kind of a low level synapse, that&rsquo;s like a reflex and the musculature or something very high level</p>
<p>abstract can benefit from looking at those who prefer three, you know, everyone&rsquo;s going after a</p>
<p>three meter, 10 meter and a hundred meter targets in some sense, but to be able to tolerate the</p>
<p>discomfort of being in a conversation where there are real answers, where the zeros and ones are,</p>
<p>are known zeros and ones are those, the equivalent of that in the nervous system.</p>
<p>And also, as you said, for the people that are very much like, Oh, I can only trust what I can</p>
<p>see and touch. Those people need to put themselves into the discomfort of the high level conversation</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s missing is conversation and conceptualization of things at multiple levels.</p>
<p>I think one of the, this is, um, I don&rsquo;t gripe about my life&rsquo;s been fortunate. We&rsquo;ve been funded</p>
<p>from the start and we&rsquo;ve been happy, um, in that, in that regard and lucky, and we&rsquo;re grateful for</p>
<p>that. But I think one of the challenges of research being so expensive is that there isn&rsquo;t a lot of</p>
<p>time, especially nowadays for people to just convene around a topic because there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>emphasis on productivity. Um, and so there, there are actually, believe it or not, there aren&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>many concepts, formal concepts in neuroscience right now. The last 10 years has been this huge</p>
<p>influx of tools. And so people in neural circuits and probing around and connect homes, it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>wonderful, but w you know, 10, 20 years ago, when the consciousness stuff was more prominent,</p>
<p>the C word, as you said, um, what was good about that time is that people would go to meetings and</p>
<p>actually discuss ideas and models. Now it&rsquo;s sort of like, it&rsquo;s sort of like demonstration day at</p>
<p>the school science fair where everyone&rsquo;s got their thing and some stuff is cooler than others.</p>
<p>But, um, I think we&rsquo;re going to see a shift. I&rsquo;m grateful that we have so many computer scientists</p>
<p>and theoreticians and, um, or theorists, I think they call themselves. Um, and somebody tell me</p>
<p>what the difference is someday. Um, and you know, psychology and even dare I say philosophy,</p>
<p>you know, these things are starting to converge. We, you know, neuroscience that the name</p>
<p>neuroscience, there wasn&rsquo;t even such a thing when I started graduate school or as a postdoc,</p>
<p>it was neurophysiology or you were a neuro anatomist or what now every it&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s invited and that&rsquo;s beautiful. That means that something&rsquo;s useful is going to come</p>
<p>of all this. And there&rsquo;s also tremendous work of course happening on it for the treatment of disease</p>
<p>and we shouldn&rsquo;t overlook that. That&rsquo;s where, you know, endings, you know, eliminating,</p>
<p>reducing suffering is also a huge initiative in neuroscience. So there&rsquo;s a lot of beauty in the</p>
<p>field, but the consciousness thing continues to be a, uh, it&rsquo;s like an exotic bird. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>no one really quite knows how to handle it and it dies very easily.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I think also from the AI perspective, I, uh, so I view the brain as less sacred. Uh,</p>
<p>I think from a neuroscience perspective, you&rsquo;re a little bit more sensitive to BS,</p>
<p>like BS narratives about the brain or whatever. I&rsquo;m a little bit more, uh, comfortable with just</p>
<p>poetic BS about the brain as long as it helps engineer intelligence systems. Well, you know</p>
<p>what I mean? Well, and I have to, you know, I confess, um, ignorance when it comes to,</p>
<p>you know, most things about coding and I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m have some quantitative ability,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have strong quantitative leanings. And so I know my limitations too. And so I,</p>
<p>I think the next generation coming up, you know, a lot of the students at Stanford are really</p>
<p>interested in quantitative models and theory and AI. And I remember when I was coming up, um,</p>
<p>a lot of the people who were doing work ahead of me, I kind of rolled my eyes at some of the stuff</p>
<p>they were doing, um, including some of their personalities, although I have many great,</p>
<p>um, senior colleagues, uh, everywhere in the world. So it&rsquo;s the way of the world. So nobody</p>
<p>knows what it&rsquo;s like to be a, you know, a young graduate student in 2020, except the young graduate</p>
<p>students. So I, I know what I, I&rsquo;m, I know there are a lot of things I don&rsquo;t know. And, um, in</p>
<p>addition to wanting to do a lot of public education, increased scientific literacy and</p>
<p>neuroscientific thinking, et cetera, a big goal of mine is to try and at least pave the way so that</p>
<p>these really brilliant and forward thinking, um, younger scientists can make the biggest</p>
<p>possible dent and make what will eventually be all us old guys and gals look stupid. I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what we were all trying to do. That&rsquo;s what we were trying to do. So yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. So from the highest possible topic of consciousness to the, to the lowest level,</p>
<p>uh, topic of David Goggins, uh, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s low, low level. He&rsquo;s high performance.</p>
<p>High performance, but like low, like there&rsquo;s no, I don&rsquo;t think David has any time for philosophy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just put it this way. Uh,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s, I mean, I think we can tack it to what we were just saying in a, in a,</p>
<p>in a meaningful way, which is whatever goes on in that abstraction part of the brain,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s figured, you know, he&rsquo;s figured out how to dig down in whatever the limbic friction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s figured out how to grab ahold of that,</p>
<p>scruff it and send it in the direction that he&rsquo;s decided it needs to go. And what&rsquo;s wild is that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s, what we&rsquo;re talking about is him doing that to himself, right? He&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s scruffing</p>
<p>himself and directing himself in a particular direction and sending himself down that trajectory.</p>
<p>And he, what&rsquo;s beautiful is that he acknowledges that that process is not pretty. It doesn&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>good. It&rsquo;s kind of horrible at every level, but he&rsquo;s created this rewarding element to it. And I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s so it, it&rsquo;s so admirable. And it&rsquo;s what so many people crave, which is</p>
<p>regulation of the self at that level.</p>
<p>And he practices, I mean, there&rsquo;s a ritual to it. There&rsquo;s a, every single day, like no exceptions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a practice aspect to the suffering that he goes through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s principled suffering.</p>
<p>Principled suffering.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I mean, I just, I mean, I admire all aspects of it, including him and his girlfriend slash wife.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. She&rsquo;ll probably know this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Fiance.</p>
<p>Wonderful person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not asking him.</p>
<p>No, no. We&rsquo;ve only communicated, I&rsquo;ve only communicated with her by text about some stuff</p>
<p>I was asking David, but yeah, they clearly formed a powerful team.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing to see people working in that kind of synergy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s inspiring to me, same as with Elon, that a guy like David Goggins can find love.</p>
<p>That you find a thing that works, which gives me hope that like whatever,</p>
<p>whatever flavor of crazy I am, you can always find another thing that works with that.</p>
<p>But I, I&rsquo;ve had the, so maybe let&rsquo;s trade Goggins stories.</p>
<p>Uh, you from a neuroscience perspective, me from a, uh, self inflicted pain perspective,</p>
<p>I somehow found myself in communication with David about some challenges that I was undergoing.</p>
<p>One of which is we were communicating every single day, email, phone,</p>
<p>about a particular 30 day challenge that I did.</p>
<p>That stretched for longer of, uh, pushups and pullups.</p>
<p>And you made a call out on social media.</p>
<p>Yeah. Social media was dumb.</p>
<p>Actually, I think that was the point I, I knew of you before,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where I started tracking some of what you were doing with these physical challenges.</p>
<p>And I, um, well, no, I think I actually, I don&rsquo;t often comment on people&rsquo;s stuff,</p>
<p>but I think I commented something like, uh, neuroplasticity loves a nonnegotiable rule.</p>
<p>No, I said a nonnegotiable contract because at the point where neuroplasticity really loves a</p>
<p>nonnegotiable contract, because, you know, and I&rsquo;ve said this before, so forgive me,</p>
<p>but you know, the brain is doing analysis of duration, path and outcome.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lot of work for the brain. And the more that it can pass off duration,</p>
<p>path and outcome to just reflex, the more energy and it can allocate to other things.</p>
<p>So if you decide there&rsquo;s no negotiation about how many pushups, how far I&rsquo;m going to run,</p>
<p>how many days, how many pullups, et cetera, you actually have more energy for pushups,</p>
<p>running and pullups.</p>
<p>And when you say neuroplasticity, you mean like the brain, once the decision is made,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll start rewiring stuff to, to make sure that this, we can actually make this happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. I mean, so much of what we do is reflexive at the level of just</p>
<p>core circuitry, breathing, heart rate, all that, that boring stuff, digestion.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s a lot of reflexive stuff, like how you drink out of a mug of coffee</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s reflexive too, but that you had to learn at some point in your life earlier</p>
<p>when you were very little, analyzing duration, path and outcome.</p>
<p>And that involves a lot of top down processing with the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>but through plasticity mechanisms, you now do it. So when you take on a challenge,</p>
<p>provided that you understand the core mechanics of how to run pushups and pullups and whatever</p>
<p>else you decided to do, once you set the number and the duration and all that,</p>
<p>then you, all you have to do is just go, but people get caught in that tide pool of just,</p>
<p>well, do I really have to do it? How do I not do that? What if I get injured? What if I,</p>
<p>you know, can I sneak a this or that, you know? And that&rsquo;s work. And to some extent,</p>
<p>I look, I not David Goggins, obviously, nor, nor do I claim to understand his process</p>
<p>partially, you know, but maybe a little bit, which is that it&rsquo;s clear that by making the decision,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more resources to devote to the effort of the actual execution.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a really, like what you&rsquo;re saying was not a lesson that was obvious to me. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still not obvious. It&rsquo;s something I really work at, which is there is always an option to</p>
<p>quit. And I mean, that&rsquo;s something I really struggle with. I mean, I&rsquo;ve quit some things</p>
<p>in my life, sick, stupid stuff. And, uh, one lesson I&rsquo;ve learned is if you quit once,</p>
<p>it opens the door that like, it&rsquo;s really valuable to trick your brain into thinking</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re going to have to die before you quit. Like it&rsquo;s actually really convenient.</p>
<p>So actually what you&rsquo;re saying is very profound, but you shouldn&rsquo;t intellectualize it. Like</p>
<p>it took me time to develop like psychologically in ways that I think it would be another</p>
<p>conversation, cause I&rsquo;m not sure how to put it into words, but it&rsquo;s really tough on me to, uh,</p>
<p>to do certain parts of that challenge, which is a huge, you know, is a huge output. The number,</p>
<p>the number that I was, I thought it would be, the number would be hard, but it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the entirety of it. Uh, especially in the early days was just spending a kind of embarrassed to</p>
<p>say how many hours this took. So I didn&rsquo;t say publicly how many hours, cause people,</p>
<p>I knew people would be like, don&rsquo;t you, aren&rsquo;t you supposed to do other stuff?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, um, again, I don&rsquo;t want to speculate too much, but occasionally David has said this</p>
<p>publicly where people will be like, don&rsquo;t you sleep or something. And his process used to just</p>
<p>be that he would just block delete, you know, like gone, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s actually, um, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a super interesting topic. And because self control and directing our actions and the role of</p>
<p>emotion and quitting, these are, these are vital to the human experience and they&rsquo;re vital to</p>
<p>performing well at anything. And at a high, obviously at a super high level, being able to</p>
<p>understand this about the self is crucial. Um, so I have a friend who was also in the teams.</p>
<p>His name is Pat Dossett. He did nine years in the seal teams. Um, and in a similar way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lore about him among team guys, um, because of a kind of funny challenge he gave</p>
<p>himself, which was, so he and I swim together, although he swims for a long time. Um, and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t swim together, although he swims further up front than I do. Um, and he&rsquo;s very patient. Um,</p>
<p>but you know, he was on a, uh, he was assigned when he was in the teams to a position that gave</p>
<p>him a little more time behind a desk than he wanted. And it&rsquo;s not as much time out out and</p>
<p>deployments, although he did deployments. Um, so he didn&rsquo;t know what to do at that time,</p>
<p>but he thought about it and he asked himself, what, what does he hate the most? And it turns</p>
<p>out the thing that he hated doing the most was bear crawls, you know, walking on your hands and</p>
<p>so he decided to bear crawl for a mile for time. So he was bear crawling a mile a day.</p>
<p>Right. And I thought that was an interesting example that he gave because, you know, like</p>
<p>why pick the thing you hate the most? And I think it maps right back to limbic friction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that creates the most limbic friction. And so if you can overcome that,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s carry over. And I think the notion of carry over has been talked about psychologically</p>
<p>and in kind of in the self help space, like, Oh, if you run a marathon, it&rsquo;s going to help you in</p>
<p>other areas of life, but will it really will it? Well, I think it depends on whether or not there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of limbic friction because if there is what you&rsquo;re exercising is not a circuit for bear crawls</p>
<p>or a circuit for pull ups. What you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re exercising a circuit for top down control</p>
<p>and that circuit was not designed to be for bear crawls or pull ups or coding</p>
<p>or waking up in the middle of the night to do something hard. That circuit was designed to</p>
<p>override limbic friction. And so neural circuits were designed to generalize, right? The stress</p>
<p>response to an incoming threat that&rsquo;s a physical threat was designed to feel the same way and be</p>
<p>the same response internally as the threat to an impending exam or divorce or marriage or whatever</p>
<p>it is that&rsquo;s stressing somebody out. And so neural circuits are not designed to be for one particular</p>
<p>action or purpose. So if you can, as you did, if you can train up top down control under conditions</p>
<p>of the highest limbic friction that when the desire to quit is at its utmost, either because</p>
<p>of fatigue or hyper arousal, being too stressed or too tired, you&rsquo;re learning how to engage a</p>
<p>circuit and that circuit is forever with you. And if you don&rsquo;t engage it, it sits there, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>atrophied. It&rsquo;s like a plant that doesn&rsquo;t get any water. And a lot of this has been discussed in</p>
<p>self help and growth mindset and all these kinds of ideas that circle the internet and social media.</p>
<p>But when you start to think about how they map to neural circuits, I think there&rsquo;s some utility</p>
<p>because what it means is that the limbic friction that you&rsquo;ll experience in, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe</p>
<p>some future relationship to something or someone, it&rsquo;s a category of neural processing that should</p>
<p>immediately click into place. It&rsquo;s just like the limbic friction you experienced trying to engage</p>
<p>in the God knows how many pushups, pull ups and running runs you were doing.</p>
<p>25,000. Who&rsquo;s counting?</p>
<p>So folks, if Lex does this again, more comments, more likes. This is the problem with you getting</p>
<p>more followers is you&rsquo;re going to get more. Actually, I should say that&rsquo;s the benefit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe it&rsquo;s not politically correct for me to ask, but there is this</p>
<p>a stereotype about Russians being like being really durable. And I started going to that</p>
<p>Russian banya that way back before COVID and they could tolerate a lot of heat and they would sit</p>
<p>very stoic. No one was going, oh, it&rsquo;s hot in here. They&rsquo;re just kind of like ease into it.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s something there, who knows?</p>
<p>Might be something there, but it could be also just personal. I just have some, I found myself,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s different, but I&rsquo;ve found myself to be able to do something unpleasant for very long</p>
<p>periods of time. Like I&rsquo;m able to shut off the mind and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s been fully tested.</p>
<p>Monkey mind or the supercomputer?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting. I mean, which mind tells you to quit exactly?</p>
<p>Limbic. Limbic friction tells you.</p>
<p>Well, limbic friction is the source of that, but who are you talking with exactly?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, we can put something very concrete to that. So there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>paper published in Cell, super top tier journal, two years ago, looking at effort.</p>
<p>And this was in a visual environment of trying to swim forward toward a target and a reward.</p>
<p>And it was a really cool experiment because they manipulated virtually the visual environment. So</p>
<p>the same amount of effort was being expended every time. But sometimes the perception was</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making forward progress. And sometimes the perception was you&rsquo;re making no progress</p>
<p>because stuff wasn&rsquo;t drifting by meant no progress. So you can be swimming and swimming</p>
<p>and swimming and not making progress. And it turns out that with each bout of effort, there&rsquo;s epinephrine</p>
<p>and norepinephrine is being released in the brainstem and glia, what traditionally were</p>
<p>thought of as support cells for the neurons, but they do a lot of things actively too,</p>
<p>are measuring the amount of epinephrine and norepinephrine in that circuit.</p>
<p>And when it exceeds a certain threshold, the glia send inhibitory signals that shut down</p>
<p>top down control. They literally it&rsquo;s the quit. You stop. There&rsquo;s no more. It&rsquo;s you quit enduring.</p>
<p>It can be rescued. Endurance can be rescued with dopamine. So that&rsquo;s where the subjective part</p>
<p>really comes into play. So you quit because you&rsquo;ve learned how to turn that off or you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned how to, some people will reward the pain process so much that friction becomes the reward.</p>
<p>And when you talk about people like Goggins and other people I know from special operations and</p>
<p>people have gone through cancer treatments three times, you hear about, just when you hear about</p>
<p>people, the Viktor Frankl stories, I mean, you hear about Nelson Mandela, you hear about these</p>
<p>stories. I&rsquo;m sure the same process is involved. Again, this speaks to the generalizability of</p>
<p>these processes as opposed to a neural circuit for a particular action or cognitive function.</p>
<p>So I think you have to learn to subjectively self reward in a way that replenishes you.</p>
<p>Goggins talks about eating souls. It&rsquo;s a very dramatic example in his mind, apparently that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a form of reward, but it&rsquo;s not just a form of reward where it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re picking up a trophy</p>
<p>or something. It&rsquo;s actually, it gives you energy. It&rsquo;s a reward that gives more neural energy. And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m defining that as more dopamine to suppress the noradrenaline adrenaline circuits in the</p>
<p>brainstem. So ultimately maps to that. Yeah. He creates enemies. He&rsquo;s always fighting enemies.</p>
<p>I never, I think I have enemies, but there are usually just versions of me inside my head. So</p>
<p>I thought about through that 30 day challenge, I tried to come up with like fake enemies. It wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>working. The only enemy I came up with is David. Well, now you have a, you certainly have a form</p>
<p>formidable adversary in this one. I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m David. I&rsquo;m willing to die on this one. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go there. Well, let&rsquo;s hope you both survive this one. My problem is the physical. So everything</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about in the mind, there&rsquo;s a physical aspect that&rsquo;s just practically difficult,</p>
<p>which is like, I can&rsquo;t like, you know, when you injure yourself at a certain point, like you just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t function or you&rsquo;re doing more damage. Yeah. Talking about it, taking yourself out of running</p>
<p>for the rest of your life potentially, or like, you know, or did it for years. So, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to avoid that, right? There&rsquo;s just like stupid physical stuff that you just want to avoid.</p>
<p>You want to keep it purely in the mental. And if it&rsquo;s purely in the mental, that&rsquo;s when the race</p>
<p>is interesting. But yeah, the problem with these physical challenges as David has experienced,</p>
<p>I mean, it has a toll on your body. I tend to think of the mind is limitless and the body is</p>
<p>kind of unfortunately quite limited. Well, I think the key is to dynamically control your output.</p>
<p>And that can be done by reducing effort, which doesn&rsquo;t work for throughout, but also by</p>
<p>restoring through these subjective reward processes. And we don&rsquo;t want to go down the</p>
<p>rabbit hole of why this all works, but these are ancient pathways that were designed to</p>
<p>bring resources to an animal or to a person through foraging for hunting or mates or water,</p>
<p>all these things. And they work so well because they&rsquo;re down in those circuits where we know the</p>
<p>zeros and ones. And that&rsquo;s great because it can be subjective at the level of, oh, I reached this</p>
<p>one milestone, this one horizon, this one three meter target. But if you don&rsquo;t reward it, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just effort. If you do self reward it, it&rsquo;s effort minus one in terms of the adrenaline output.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about this. You&rsquo;re one of the great communicators in science. I&rsquo;m really a big</p>
<p>fan of yours, enjoying in terms of the educational stuff you&rsquo;re putting on neuroscience.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, do you have a philosophy behind it or is it just an instinct,</p>
<p>unstoppable force? Do you have, like, what&rsquo;s your thinking? Because it&rsquo;s rare and it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited that, you know, somebody from Stanford. So I, okay, I&rsquo;m in multiple places</p>
<p>in the sense of like where my interests lie. And one, you know, politically speaking, academic</p>
<p>institutions are under fire, you know, for many reasons we don&rsquo;t need to get into. I get into it</p>
<p>in a lot of other places, but I believe in places like Stanford and places like MIT as one of the</p>
<p>most magical institutions for inspiring people to dream, people to build the future. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I believe that it is a really special, these universities are really special places.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s always exciting to me when somebody as inspiring as you represents those places. So</p>
<p>it makes me proud that somebody from Stanford is like, somebody like you is representing Stanford.</p>
<p>So maybe you could speak to what&rsquo;s, how did you come to be who you are in being a communicator?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, thanks for the kind words, especially coming from you. I think Stanford is</p>
<p>an amazing place as is MIT and it&rsquo;s such a. MIT is better by the way. I&rsquo;ll let it out. Anything</p>
<p>you say at this point. I have many friends at MIT. Yeah. Smarter friends. Yeah. Ed Boyden is</p>
<p>among the best in class. There&rsquo;s some people, not me that can hold a candle to him, but not many,</p>
<p>maybe one or two. I think the great benefit of being in a place like MIT or Stanford is that</p>
<p>when you look around, the average is very high. You have many best in class among the one or two</p>
<p>or three best in the world at what they do. And it&rsquo;s a wonderful privilege to be there. And one</p>
<p>thing that I think also makes them and other universities like them very special is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an emphasis on what gets exported out of the university, not keeping it ivory tower and</p>
<p>really trying to keep an eye on what&rsquo;s needed in the world and trying to do something useful.</p>
<p>And I think the proximity to industry and Silicon Valley and in the Boston area and Cambridge also</p>
<p>lends itself well to that. And there are other institutions too, of course. So the reason I got</p>
<p>involved in educating on social media was actually because of Pat Dossett, the mile bear call guy.</p>
<p>It was at the turn of 2018 to 2019. We had formed a good friendship and he talked me into doing these</p>
<p>early morning cold water swims. I was learning a lot about pain and suffering, but also the beauty</p>
<p>of cold water swims. And we were talking one morning and he said, so what are you going to</p>
<p>do to serve the world in 2019? It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s the way that like a Texan former seal talks.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re just literally like, what are you going to do to serve the world in 2019?</p>
<p>Like, well, I&rsquo;ve run my lab. It&rsquo;s like, no, no, what are you going to do? That&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t forceful in it, but I was like, that&rsquo;s interesting question. I said, well,</p>
<p>if I had my way, I would just teach people, everyone about the brain. Because I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing. He goes, we&rsquo;ll do it. I go, all right. He goes, shake on it. So we did it, you</p>
<p>know? And so I started putting out these posts and it&rsquo;s grown into, to include a variety of things,</p>
<p>but you asked about a governing philosophy. So I want to increase interest in the brain and in the</p>
<p>nervous system and in biology generally, that&rsquo;s one major goal. I&rsquo;d like to increase scientific</p>
<p>literacy, which can&rsquo;t be rammed down people&rsquo;s throats of talking about how to look at a graph</p>
<p>and statistics and Z scores and P values and genetics. It has to be done gradually, in my</p>
<p>opinion. I want to put valuable tools into the world, mainly tools that map to things that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing in our lab. So these will be tools centered around how to understand and direct one&rsquo;s states</p>
<p>of mind and body. So reduce stress, raise one&rsquo;s stress threshold. So it&rsquo;s not always just about</p>
<p>being calm. Sometimes it&rsquo;s about learning how to tolerate being not calm, raise awareness for</p>
<p>mental health. There&rsquo;s a ton of micro missions in this, but it all really maps back to, you know,</p>
<p>like the eight and 10 year old version of me, which is I used to spend my weekends when I was</p>
<p>a kid reading about weird animals. And I had this obsession with like medieval weapons and stuff</p>
<p>like catapults. And then I used to come into school on Monday and I would ask if I could talk</p>
<p>about it to the class and teach. And I just, it&rsquo;s really, I promise, and some people might</p>
<p>not believe me, but it&rsquo;s really, I don&rsquo;t really like being the point of focus. I just get so</p>
<p>excited about these gems of that I find in the world in books and in experiments and in</p>
<p>discussions with colleagues and discussions with people like you and around the universe.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t just compulsively, I got to tell people about it. So I try and package it into</p>
<p>a form that people can access. You know, I think if I&rsquo;ve, I think the reception has been really</p>
<p>wonderful. Stanford has been very supportive, thankfully. I&rsquo;ve done some podcasts even with</p>
<p>them and they&rsquo;ve reposted some stuff on social media. It&rsquo;s a precarious place to put yourself</p>
<p>out there as a research academic. I think some of my colleagues, both locally and elsewhere,</p>
<p>probably wonder if I&rsquo;m still serious about research, which I absolutely am. And I also</p>
<p>acknowledge that their research and the research coming out of the field needs to be talked about</p>
<p>and not all scientists are good at translating that into a language that people can access.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like the phrase dumb it down. What I like to do is take a concept that I think people</p>
<p>will find interesting and useful and offer it sort of like you would offer food to somebody visiting</p>
<p>your home. You&rsquo;re not going to cram foie gras in their face. You&rsquo;re going to say, like, do you want</p>
<p>a cracker? And they say, yeah. And like, do you want something on that cracker? Like, do you like</p>
<p>cheese? Like, yeah. Like, do you want Swiss cheese or you want that really like stinky, like French?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like cheese much. Or do you want foie gras? Like, what&rsquo;s that? Like, so you&rsquo;re trying,</p>
<p>the best information prompts more questions of interest, not questions of confusion,</p>
<p>but questions of interest. And so I feel like one door opens, then another door opens,</p>
<p>then another door opens. And pretty soon, the image in my mind is you create a bunch of</p>
<p>neuroscientists who are thinking about themselves neuroscientifically. And I don&rsquo;t begin to think</p>
<p>that I have all the answers at all. I cast a neuroscience, sometimes a little bit of a psychology</p>
<p>lens onto what I think are interesting topics. And someday I&rsquo;m going to go into the ground or</p>
<p>the ocean or wherever it is I end up. And I&rsquo;m very comfortable with the fact that not everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be happy with how I deliver the information, but I would hope that people</p>
<p>would feel like some of it was useful and meaningful and got them to think a little bit</p>
<p>harder. Since you mentioned going into the ground and Victor Frankl, Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning,</p>
<p>I reread that book quite often. Let me ask the big ridiculous question about life. What do you</p>
<p>think is the meaning of it all? And maybe why do you, do you mention that book from a psychologist</p>
<p>perspective, which Victor Frankl was, or do you ever think about the bigger philosophical questions</p>
<p>that raises about meaning? What&rsquo;s the meaning of it all? One of the great challenges in assigning a</p>
<p>good, you know, giving a good answer to the question of like, what&rsquo;s the meaning of life is,</p>
<p>um, I think illustrated best by the Victor Frankl example, although there are other examples too,</p>
<p>which is that our sense of meaning is very elastic in time and space. And I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>uh, we talked a little bit about this earlier, but it&rsquo;s amazing to me that somebody locked in a cell</p>
<p>or a concentration camp can bring the horizon in close enough that they can then micro slice their</p>
<p>environment so that they can find rewards and meaning and power and beauty, even in a little</p>
<p>square box or, or a horrible situation. And I think this is really speaks to one of the most</p>
<p>important features of the human mind, which is we could do, let&rsquo;s take two opposite extremes.</p>
<p>One would be, let&rsquo;s say the alarm went off right now in this building and the building started</p>
<p>shaking our vision, our hearing, everything would be tuned to this space, time bubble for those</p>
<p>moments and everything that we were processed, all that would matter. The only meaning would be</p>
<p>get out of here, safe, figure out what&rsquo;s going on, contact loved ones, et cetera.</p>
<p>If we were to sit back, totally relaxed, we could do the, you know, I think it&rsquo;s called pale blue</p>
<p>dot thing or whatever, where we could imagine ourselves in this room. And then they were in</p>
<p>the United States and this continent and the earth, and then it&rsquo;s peering down us. And all of</p>
<p>a sudden you get back, it can seem so big that all of a sudden it&rsquo;s meaningless, right? If you</p>
<p>see yourself as just one brief glimmer in all of time and all of space, you go to, I don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And if you go to, oh, every little thing that happens in this text thread or this, you know,</p>
<p>comment section on YouTube or Instagram, your space time bubble is tiny, then everything seems</p>
<p>inflated and the brain will contract and dilate its space, time, vision and time, but also sense</p>
<p>of meaning. And that&rsquo;s beautiful. And it&rsquo;s what allows us to be so dynamic in different environments</p>
<p>and we can pull from the past and the present and future. It&rsquo;s why examples like Nelson Mandela and</p>
<p>Viktor Frankl had to include, it makes sense that it wasn&rsquo;t just about grinding it out. They had to</p>
<p>find those dopamine rewards, even in those little boxes they were forced into. So I&rsquo;m not trying to</p>
<p>dodge an answer, but for me personally, and I think about this a lot because I have this complicated</p>
<p>history in science where my undergraduate, graduate advisor and postdoctoral advisor all died young.</p>
<p>So, you know, and they were wonderful people and had immense importance in my life. But what I</p>
<p>realized is that we can get so fixated on the thing that we&rsquo;re experiencing, holding tremendous</p>
<p>meaning, but it only holds that meaning for as long as we&rsquo;re in that space, time regime.</p>
<p>And this is important because what really gives meaning is the understanding that you can move</p>
<p>between these different space, time dimensionalities. And I&rsquo;m not trying to sound like a</p>
<p>theoretical physicist or anyone that thinks about the cosmos and saying that it&rsquo;s really the fact</p>
<p>that sometimes we&rsquo;d say and do and think things and it feels so important. And then two days later,</p>
<p>like what happened? Well, you had a different brain processing algorithm entirely. You were in a</p>
<p>completely different state. And so what I want to do in this lifetime is I want to engage in as many</p>
<p>different levels of contraction and dilation of meaning as possible. I want to go to the micro.</p>
<p>I sometimes think about this. I&rsquo;m like, if I just pulled over the side of the road, I bet you there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an anthill there and their whole world is fascinating. You can&rsquo;t stay there. And you also</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t stay staring up at the clouds and just think about how we&rsquo;re just these little beings and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter. The key is the journey back and forth, up and down that staircase, back and forth</p>
<p>and back and forth. And my goal is to get as many trips up and down that staircase as I can before</p>
<p>the reaper comes for me. Oh, beautiful. So the, the, the dance of dilation of meaning,</p>
<p>contraction between the different space, zoom in, zoom out, and get as many steps in on that</p>
<p>staircase. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s my goal anyway. And I&rsquo;ve watched people die. I watched my postdoc advisor</p>
<p>die wither away. My graduate, it was tragic, but they found beauty in these closing moments</p>
<p>because their bubble was their kids in one case, or like one of them was a Giants fan and like got</p>
<p>to see a Giants game, you know, in her last moments and like, and you just realize like it&rsquo;s a Giants</p>
<p>game, but not in that moment because time is closing. And so those time bins feel huge because</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s slicing things so differently. So I think, um, learning how to do that better and more fluidly,</p>
<p>recognizing where one is and not getting too taxed to the idea that there&rsquo;s one correct answer,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s what brings meaning. That&rsquo;s my goal anyway. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end</p>
<p>it. Andrew, I really appreciate that you would, uh, come down and contract your space time and</p>
<p>focus on this conversation for a few hours. Uh, is a huge honor. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours. As I told</p>
<p>you, I hope you keep growing and educating the world about the human mind. Thanks for talking</p>
<p>today. Thank you. I really appreciate the invitation to be here. And people might think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying it just cause I&rsquo;m here, but I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours. I send your podcasts to my colleagues</p>
<p>and other people. And I think what you&rsquo;re doing is, isn&rsquo;t just, uh, amazing. It&rsquo;s important. And</p>
<p>so thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Andrew Huberman. And thank</p>
