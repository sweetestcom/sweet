    <p>The following is a conversation with Niels Jorgensen,</p>
<p>a New York firefighter for over 21 years</p>
<p>who was there at Ground Zero on September 11th, 2001.</p>
<p>He was forced to retire because of the leukemia</p>
<p>he contracted from cleaning up Ground Zero.</p>
<p>This podcast tells his story,</p>
<p>and the story of other great men and women</p>
<p>who were there that day.</p>
<p>Some of the stories we talk about</p>
<p>are part of a new limited podcast series</p>
<p>that Niels hosts called 20 for 20,</p>
<p>with 20 episodes for the 20 years since 9 11.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>As a side note, please allow me to say a few words</p>
<p>about the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001.</p>
<p>I was in downtown Chicago on that day,</p>
<p>lost in the mundane busyness of an early Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>At that time, I was already fascinated by human nature,</p>
<p>the best and the worst of it,</p>
<p>exploring it through the study of history and literature.</p>
<p>In the years before, as a young boy growing up in Russia,</p>
<p>I saw chaos, uncertainty, and desperation</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union of the 1990s,</p>
<p>wrapping up a century of war and suffering.</p>
<p>But after coming to America for me,</p>
<p>there was a sense of hope, like all of it was behind us,</p>
<p>a bad dream to be forgotten</p>
<p>as we enter into the new century.</p>
<p>On 9 11, when I saw the news</p>
<p>of the second plane hitting the towers,</p>
<p>my sense of hope had changed.</p>
<p>I understood that the 21st century,</p>
<p>like the century before, would too have its tragedies,</p>
<p>its evildoers, its wars, and its suffering.</p>
<p>And unlike the history books,</p>
<p>these stories will involve all of us.</p>
<p>They will involve me in however small</p>
<p>and insignificant a role,</p>
<p>but one that nevertheless carries the responsibility</p>
<p>to help.</p>
<p>I became an American that day, a citizen of the world.</p>
<p>I felt the common humanity in all of us.</p>
<p>I felt the unity and the love in the days that followed.</p>
<p>And I think most of the world shared in this feeling</p>
<p>that we are all in this together.</p>
<p>Evil cannot defeat the human spirit.</p>
<p>There were many heroes sung and unsung on that day</p>
<p>and in the years after.</p>
<p>Often politicians fail to rightfully honor the service</p>
<p>and sacrifice of these heroes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much I could say about that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to waste my words</p>
<p>on the failures of weak leaders.</p>
<p>Instead, I want to say thank you</p>
<p>to the men and women who rushed to Ground Zero to help,</p>
<p>who put on a uniform to serve,</p>
<p>who make me proud to be an American and a human being,</p>
<p>and give me hope about the future of our civilization</p>
<p>here on a small spinning rock</p>
<p>that despite the long odds</p>
<p>keeps kindling the fire of human consciousness and love.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Niels Jorgensen.</p>
<p>Take me through the day of September 11th, 2001</p>
<p>as you experienced it, as you lived it.</p>
<p>September 11th, 2001 was a bright, beautiful,</p>
<p>sunny Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>It was a late summer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of folks who go to the beaches in New Jersey</p>
<p>and call it the short summer.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s left there for Labor Day,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still beautiful enough to enjoy the weather.</p>
<p>I left my house about 6.30 in the morning</p>
<p>and my four and a half year old daughter said to me,</p>
<p>daddy, which truck are you driving today, the fire truck,</p>
<p>the oil truck, or the boar&rsquo;s head truck?</p>
<p>Because I had three jobs at the time.</p>
<p>Most New York City firefighters and police officers, EMS,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t make the most amount of money.</p>
<p>So in order to live in that city, you have to hustle.</p>
<p>And my wife stayed at home raising the children.</p>
<p>So my daughter said, oh, so you should be safe</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re on the oil truck.</p>
<p>I told her I was going on the oil truck that day.</p>
<p>So she said, you should be safe today, daddy.</p>
<p>So I left and worked for this great company</p>
<p>on the North Shore, Staten Island, Quinlan Fuel.</p>
<p>Very nice people, treated me very well.</p>
<p>And it was my first day back actually for the winter season.</p>
<p>Usually get laid off a couple months in the summer</p>
<p>because things, you know, too hot to need oil.</p>
<p>So I took the truck, started my route that day</p>
<p>and plane to New Jersey.</p>
<p>And plane hit the tower.</p>
<p>So initially I&rsquo;m like, oh, it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>some silly Lear jet pilot.</p>
<p>And he veered off track to get a better picture</p>
<p>for a client and he hit the building.</p>
<p>Probably hit a, you know, bad turbulence, gust of wind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very windy down in that area in Manhattan.</p>
<p>So that was my first thought.</p>
<p>Can we pause there for a second?</p>
<p>So 6.30 a.m. you wake up, you leave,</p>
<p>and then the plane hits at 8.45 a.m.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting how you phrase it.</p>
<p>So how did you hear that a plane hit something?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big news radio guy, news guy, bit of a buff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been that way since I was a kid</p>
<p>and I had the news radio on the local New York radio station.</p>
<p>And as I was driving the truck,</p>
<p>I heard, you know, an emergency report.</p>
<p>This just in, aircraft has just struck</p>
<p>the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>And where Quinlan&rsquo;s is located,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the north rim of Staten Island,</p>
<p>which is right on New York Harbor.</p>
<p>And you could see Statue of Liberty,</p>
<p>you know, a mile or two away in your distance.</p>
<p>And then past that is the towers.</p>
<p>So I just literally stopped the truck and looked out</p>
<p>and I saw the smoke.</p>
<p>So there was smoke?</p>
<p>Oh, it was dark, black smoke.</p>
<p>It was just, yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>it was burning fully at that point.</p>
<p>Did you have fear of what the hell happened?</p>
<p>Or is it? I was initially scared</p>
<p>for anybody involved.</p>
<p>I realized, I said, there&rsquo;s gonna be lots of fatalities,</p>
<p>obviously, depending on the size of the aircraft.</p>
<p>And, you know, the business day there</p>
<p>had started probably at 8, 8.30.</p>
<p>So those buildings should have been packed at that moment.</p>
<p>So that was a thought that crossed my mind.</p>
<p>But from our being responder perspective,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re off duty, normally you do not go to a scene</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t want you to</p>
<p>because of accountability and safety.</p>
<p>The on duty platoon will handle it.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s something very horrific,</p>
<p>then they will have something called a recall,</p>
<p>which is any police firefighter or EMS personnel</p>
<p>is obligated to go to their command immediately,</p>
<p>check in with, you know, their command to get their gear</p>
<p>and stand by and await orders for deployment</p>
<p>or to remain in that command for routine duties.</p>
<p>How often throughout history have there been recalls?</p>
<p>I believe the one prior to that was like in the 1968 riots,</p>
<p>possibly, and then maybe in the 70s,</p>
<p>there was another blackout and riots.</p>
<p>And I remember my dad talking about it.</p>
<p>And he actually always said,</p>
<p>just remember if something bad&rsquo;s going down,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t just rush in, you will wait the recall.</p>
<p>Or at the very least, if there isn&rsquo;t a recall,</p>
<p>you get to your firehouse.</p>
<p>And because if you show up somewhere,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good chance that no one knows you&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>And now you, in your well intended movements,</p>
<p>you get lost or trapped or no one&rsquo;s looking for you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the whole thing with, you know, checking in.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re with a squad or, you know, group of guys</p>
<p>and everyone knows, you know,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s Nels, there&rsquo;s Lex.</p>
<p>Okay, they&rsquo;re on, you know, this team.</p>
<p>So I said, all right, they&rsquo;re not gonna need us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably gonna be a fifth alarm.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;ll be 250 firefighters there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll handle it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a bad day for those guys,</p>
<p>but you know, our guys take on some heavy stuff</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the second plane hit</p>
<p>and I knew immediately, I&rsquo;m like, okay, we&rsquo;re under attack.</p>
<p>So I just flew the truck back in.</p>
<p>I told my boss, I have to go.</p>
<p>He understood, he knew something was way wrong</p>
<p>and I just was flying.</p>
<p>At the time, I actually had a yellow Volkswagen Beetle,</p>
<p>kind of a goofy car to be driving, but I loved it.</p>
<p>So for people who are just listening,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of a big guy.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I definitely need to lose about 50 pounds.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t mean in that way, your frame, big hands.</p>
<p>As my beloved friend, Bobby Adams would say to me,</p>
<p>I was driving around in a clown wagon</p>
<p>and he also says, I have a waving hairdo, waving bye bye.</p>
<p>So thanks, Bobby.</p>
<p>But yeah, he&rsquo;s a great friend.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I took the Volkswagen and I flew in</p>
<p>and I was heading over to Verrazano Bridge</p>
<p>and hit the Brooklyn Queens Expressway.</p>
<p>And my phone rang and my wife normally doesn&rsquo;t curse</p>
<p>or raise a voice and she was yelling at me.</p>
<p>And she said, don&rsquo;t go in there, go to your firehouse.</p>
<p>Well, first she asked, well, she knew I was on the way,</p>
<p>but she just wanted to know where.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m on the curve, which is 65th Street</p>
<p>on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway called Dead Man&rsquo;s Curve.</p>
<p>We actually used to do a lot of car wrecks up there.</p>
<p>And I was hitting that curve pretty fast.</p>
<p>And then right around the curve is the exit to the firehouse.</p>
<p>And I had to decide, well, am I driving right in</p>
<p>to the battery tunnel to the city</p>
<p>or am I going to the firehouse?</p>
<p>And then I said, but I have no gear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be ineffective.</p>
<p>How do I show up with no gear, no protection, you know?</p>
<p>So she said, do what your dad would follow the recall,</p>
<p>go to the firehouse.</p>
<p>And I hung up the phone, said, I love you, gotta go.</p>
<p>And I did, I went to the firehouse</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m glad I listened to her.</p>
<p>I had my father ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>My dad, beautiful guy, he&rsquo;s 82.</p>
<p>He did 34 years in the New York City Fire Department.</p>
<p>He came down on end stage, non</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s 38 back in, going on 39, 1978.</p>
<p>And this guy, he&rsquo;s my hero.</p>
<p>He was gonna die, they sent him home.</p>
<p>They said, there&rsquo;s really not much we can do.</p>
<p>Go get your affairs in order.</p>
<p>And he says, but doc, I have three young kids.</p>
<p>And she called him a couple hours later.</p>
<p>She said, I got in touch with Sloan Kettering</p>
<p>and they have a new drug.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll take you to the hospital.</p>
<p>and do the same exact reverse route</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d get to the cancer center</p>
<p>and my mom would meet him and he&rsquo;d get his infusion</p>
<p>and within two hours he&rsquo;d be violently ill</p>
<p>for a few days, really badly ill.</p>
<p>And I just remember, yeah, I was 10 years old</p>
<p>and he just had to have the room darkened out</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d be so sick and I&rsquo;d just go in</p>
<p>and wipe the vomit on his face,</p>
<p>just try to give him a little water</p>
<p>but he couldn&rsquo;t take it down because he&rsquo;d throw it up.</p>
<p>And maybe on Saturday he&rsquo;d start coming around a little bit,</p>
<p>drink down a little bit of tea</p>
<p>and on Sunday morning he&rsquo;d put his robe on</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d go down, mom would make him black coffee and toast</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d sit up, watch the news, watch a game</p>
<p>and then Monday morning he&rsquo;d go back to work.</p>
<p>He did that for four years.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s 82 and he&rsquo;s still here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You said that your dad&rsquo;s a man of a few words</p>
<p>but when he talks, they&rsquo;re profound.</p>
<p>So what words were ringing in your ear</p>
<p>when you were driving?</p>
<p>I just always remember him saying,</p>
<p>kid, they give the recall, you go to the firehouse,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go where you think you should,</p>
<p>you go to the firehouse, you follow your orders.</p>
<p>So do the smart thing, do your job.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>And every time we&rsquo;d hang up the phone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fireman talk, he&rsquo;d say, I love you, keep low.</p>
<p>My dad couldn&rsquo;t tell me he loved me</p>
<p>until I told him when I first got on a fire</p>
<p>upon when I was 22 and my dad grew up in a tough household.</p>
<p>My granddad was a good man, but a tormented man.</p>
<p>He was sent away from home at 12 years old.</p>
<p>He was from Denmark and I&rsquo;m named after him, Grandpa Nils.</p>
<p>And I think his demons took up a large part of his life.</p>
<p>His anger, whatever it was, his fear.</p>
<p>We got the sense that maybe when he was a child,</p>
<p>he was an apprentice baker,</p>
<p>living with strangers, working for them.</p>
<p>And we think maybe he was abused</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why he took it out on my dad</p>
<p>and my grandma and my aunts.</p>
<p>But they made it up to each other</p>
<p>at the end of my granddad&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>My granddad turned out to be the best grandfather ever.</p>
<p>I think he tried to heal and heal everyone</p>
<p>by his change of behavior.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s proof that you can change,</p>
<p>you can improve if you work on it.</p>
<p>But I know I&rsquo;m going off track here, but.</p>
<p>But you were man enough in your,</p>
<p>you say in your 20s to tell your dad.</p>
<p>To my dad, yeah.</p>
<p>And my dad, I got on a job.</p>
<p>He said, how&rsquo;d it go, kid?</p>
<p>That was the tour, we called it Tour of Duty.</p>
<p>I said, oh, dad, it was great, it was great, I love it.</p>
<p>And he goes, well, just remember, you keep low,</p>
<p>you always keep low.</p>
<p>And keep low means you stay down below the flames,</p>
<p>if a room flashes over and it&rsquo;s burning,</p>
<p>if you stay up high, you&rsquo;re gonna get burned badly.</p>
<p>But if you get down on your belly and you crawl,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get out.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;d always say that when he&rsquo;d hang up the phone.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I love you, pop.</p>
<p>And he says, well, thanks, kid.</p>
<p>I said, well, you can say it too.</p>
<p>Oh, nice, you pressured him.</p>
<p>And he did, and he said it.</p>
<p>And now every time we talk, he says it.</p>
<p>So, you know, they talk about masculinity and whatnot.</p>
<p>And my dad is one of those tough, tough guys</p>
<p>with a soft edge.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how he brought me up, you know,</p>
<p>to be a protector.</p>
<p>I hate bullies.</p>
<p>I was bullied really badly as a kid,</p>
<p>and I really hated it.</p>
<p>And now I find myself sometimes throwing myself</p>
<p>into situations to protect people that are being,</p>
<p>you know, violated and hurt.</p>
<p>And I just can&rsquo;t walk away from it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my dad.</p>
<p>My dad was that, you know, just a great guy.</p>
<p>But anyway, yeah.</p>
<p>You still listen to, therefore, see,</p>
<p>you probably went to rush right to the towers,</p>
<p>but you went.</p>
<p>Yeah, so anyway, I got, I did, I listened to him.</p>
<p>I listened to my wife.</p>
<p>I went to the firehouse, and it was really strange.</p>
<p>It was eerie because the computer dispatch system</p>
<p>was still beeping, which meant it sent a dispatch,</p>
<p>and the truck received it.</p>
<p>Ladder 114, my truck company received it,</p>
<p>and they left, they were gone.</p>
<p>So it was this beautiful old building built in the 1880s</p>
<p>with a spiral staircase, just a narrow old brick garage,</p>
<p>and it was empty.</p>
<p>And I just heard the computer chirping.</p>
<p>And I looked down on a ticket, and it said,</p>
<p>Ladder 114, respond, the Vessian West World Trade Center</p>
<p>aircraft into building.</p>
<p>And I said, oh, God, I just hope they&rsquo;re not on a death ride</p>
<p>because this now was two towers, and they were burning.</p>
<p>They were free burning, and I knew</p>
<p>this was really, really bad.</p>
<p>And I got on the phone, and I called command right away.</p>
<p>I called the 40th Battalion, and Chief&rsquo;s aide just said, look,</p>
<p>get 12 guys.</p>
<p>Sign them in to the journal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a journal of daily events.</p>
<p>Everything that takes place in the firehouse 24 seven</p>
<p>has to be logged.</p>
<p>And I logged myself as coming in, reporting for duty.</p>
<p>And as the guys came in, I logged them in.</p>
<p>And then one of our lieutenants took command.</p>
<p>We grabbed up a bunch of gear, and they basically</p>
<p>told us, get 12 guys, get a city bus,</p>
<p>and get down to the battery tunnel they said</p>
<p>would probably be closed.</p>
<p>There was threats it was going to be blown up</p>
<p>to get to the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p>And so we did.</p>
<p>We got a city bus.</p>
<p>We flagged it down, and the bus driver said, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give you the bus.</p>
<p>I will drive you.</p>
<p>And he took us, and we stopped at Engine 201,</p>
<p>which is just about a quarter mile down the road from us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our affiliated engine company,</p>
<p>and my childhood best friend here, Johnny Schardt,</p>
<p>he was assigned there, and he was on shift.</p>
<p>And then they went through the tunnel.</p>
<p>And we picked up those guys, the off duty guys from 201,</p>
<p>and then we kept going down Fourth Avenue,</p>
<p>and we picked up 239&rsquo;s crew.</p>
<p>And then we hightailed it down the bridge,</p>
<p>and there was a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>There was a lot of people fleeing,</p>
<p>coming over the bridge in waves, so it affected the inbound.</p>
<p>What was the mood like among the crew?</p>
<p>It was somber, because just prior to getting on the bus,</p>
<p>the first tower went down.</p>
<p>So we figured that I heard 114, my lieutenant, Dennis Oberg,</p>
<p>heard him on the radio.</p>
<p>And he said, 114, Manhattan, we&rsquo;re on your frequency.</p>
<p>What do you need us?</p>
<p>And they said, Tally Ho, which is our nickname.</p>
<p>Tally Ho, respond to the Vessian West to the command post</p>
<p>and receive your orders.</p>
<p>And I heard Dennis say, Tally Ho, 10 4.</p>
<p>And Dennis, a little while after that,</p>
<p>they were proceeding to go into, I believe it was,</p>
<p>I get this mixed up, and I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I should know this by the back of my hand,</p>
<p>but sometimes it&rsquo;s just such a haze.</p>
<p>But the second tower hit was the first one to go down.</p>
<p>And they were heading over to go in it.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, he looked up,</p>
<p>and he saw what he thought to be disintegration.</p>
<p>And he turned the guys around.</p>
<p>He said, run.</p>
<p>Just run.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look back.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look up.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>They sprinted as fast as they could.</p>
<p>And they dove under a fire truck.</p>
<p>And the guys that were sprinting behind him 40 feet away</p>
<p>were underneath a pile that was 10 stories deep.</p>
<p>They were killed.</p>
<p>And just further into that pile was his rookie son, Dennis&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rookie son, who was working in Ladder 105, which</p>
<p>was my first command under the department.</p>
<p>I worked for it, proudly served for three years.</p>
<p>And just aside them was my childhood best friend,</p>
<p>John Chard, and his crew from 201.</p>
<p>And they were all killed.</p>
<p>And a strange irony to that is that Dennis&rsquo;s son, Dennis Jr.,</p>
<p>was working underneath, under the wing of a senior man,</p>
<p>as we say.</p>
<p>A senior man is a guy with a lot of experience.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll watch over you, make sure you don&rsquo;t veer off,</p>
<p>like I veer off a lot in talking.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t veer off, and you get yourself hurt.</p>
<p>In the morning of 1993 bombing, Henry Miller was my senior man.</p>
<p>And I was the young guy under his wing.</p>
<p>And he protected me.</p>
<p>And toward the end of the day, he looked around.</p>
<p>He said, kid, it&rsquo;s a bad day.</p>
<p>He said, they didn&rsquo;t do it right.</p>
<p>They blew it up in the middle.</p>
<p>If they did it in a corner, they would</p>
<p>have dropped this building half a mile down at Canal Street.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t kid yourself.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be back, and they&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll do it right next time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so strange and so prophetic,</p>
<p>because he was there with them.</p>
<p>He died with Dennis.</p>
<p>He knew it.</p>
<p>And like 1994, we had a training manual</p>
<p>with a picture of the towers with a target.</p>
<p>And this is not a matter of if, but a matter</p>
<p>of when, be prepared.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s haunting.</p>
<p>It was like people knew, right?</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t stop it.</p>
<p>And so we got off the bus, but just prior to that,</p>
<p>coming over the bridge of the second tower, it&rsquo;s gone now.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just destroyed, because we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>our guys are there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all in there.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re feeling like cowards, because we got there late.</p>
<p>And initially, we&rsquo;re thinking there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>500 guys that are gone, because there was a tent alarm</p>
<p>assignment, which means 50, 60 fire trucks, five to six guys</p>
<p>per, you know, you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>At least there was even more tent alarm,</p>
<p>plus multiple alarms on top of it.</p>
<p>There was a dispatch, basically equivalent of five</p>
<p>to 600 firefighters.</p>
<p>We figured, oh, they&rsquo;re all in there, all gone.</p>
<p>All the police officers, Port Authority police,</p>
<p>NYPD police, court officers just up the street</p>
<p>from the courts, transit cops from the train tunnels.</p>
<p>Like, just, you know, we knew everybody was going there,</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>So what you saw, what were we looking at?</p>
<p>What did it look like?</p>
<p>So you saw rubble, and then you knew that many, that 105</p>
<p>and 201, many of those guys are in the, they&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we thought 114 was in there, too.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t realize at that point.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even realize that they had gotten under that truck.</p>
<p>We thought they were all gone.</p>
<p>But yeah, it looked like, it looked like a movie scene</p>
<p>with just end of the earth destruction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just massive piles of intertwined steel,</p>
<p>what was left of the steel.</p>
<p>And you know, there was no cement.</p>
<p>It was all just dust.</p>
<p>And it was just a burning pile of dust and concrete</p>
<p>and plastic.</p>
<p>And it was just, everything was just pulverized.</p>
<p>And it was truly hard to mentally compute that.</p>
<p>Like, it was like, what?</p>
<p>And then there was just fighter jets, a couple of fighter jets</p>
<p>just circling.</p>
<p>And you just heard them flying by over your head.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;d literally see the guy banking</p>
<p>a turn around a Brooklyn bridge and just coming back.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, holy shoot, we&rsquo;re under attack?</p>
<p>And we couldn&rsquo;t really get concrete intel</p>
<p>as to what exactly we knew planes.</p>
<p>But then we kept hearing there was multiple devices.</p>
<p>There was devices in a battery tunnel.</p>
<p>And there was devices on a George Washington bridge</p>
<p>and in the subways.</p>
<p>And it was just chaos.</p>
<p>It was, I mean, we kept it together, obviously,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s kind of, we try.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>But the just constant barrage of different reports,</p>
<p>it was like, holy shoot.</p>
<p>And then as we were being deployed,</p>
<p>it was a little frustrating.</p>
<p>But they were trying to take command and send us</p>
<p>in groups now because they realized</p>
<p>we have to start searching this.</p>
<p>You could hear the alarms on the Scott Air Mask, the packs</p>
<p>we wear to go into the building.</p>
<p>It has a motion alarm.</p>
<p>And if you stop moving for 30 seconds,</p>
<p>it just sounds like this whining, just screaming bell.</p>
<p>And it just keeps going and going.</p>
<p>And you could hear multiple units of those going off.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, wait a minute.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s guys with those.</p>
<p>Where are they?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s emanating from underneath the pile.</p>
<p>And it was just surreal and truly like a war zone.</p>
<p>I mean, I was a soldier in the reserves.</p>
<p>And I never saw combat.</p>
<p>And I would never claim that I did.</p>
<p>But we trained.</p>
<p>We trained for a lot of situations.</p>
<p>And we trained in real life atmospheres and whatnot.</p>
<p>And this was just beyond that by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>It was bizarre.</p>
<p>Did you see the towers collapse?</p>
<p>As we were coming over the bridge,</p>
<p>the first one, as we were deploying from the firehouse,</p>
<p>we had a television on.</p>
<p>And I saw it go down.</p>
<p>And we were so involved in getting gear together</p>
<p>and getting teams set up and, OK, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be with these two guys.</p>
<p>And I just yelled, there&rsquo;s the guys.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re looking at me.</p>
<p>I dropped to my knees.</p>
<p>And I started praying.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, what the hell&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>I said, I couldn&rsquo;t even say.</p>
<p>I was like, 114, they&rsquo;re in there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, what?</p>
<p>I said, the tower&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And all you saw on the TV was just this pile of dust.</p>
<p>And I guess because they didn&rsquo;t see it going down,</p>
<p>they probably thought I truly lost it.</p>
<p>And then the realization came.</p>
<p>It was like, wow, the tower&rsquo;s down.</p>
<p>So now it was like, wow, this is really on.</p>
<p>So we just took off and got that boss.</p>
<p>And so if you thought many of the guys on 114 were dead,</p>
<p>if you thought that, did you think you were going to die?</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re rushing towards the rubble?</p>
<p>As crazy as it sounds, I never thought that the other tower</p>
<p>would go down.</p>
<p>I said, OK, maybe some freak chance that one went down.</p>
<p>But no, the other one&rsquo;s not going to go.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re built so strong.</p>
<p>I was in those towers so many times.</p>
<p>I mean, I ate dinner up in the top floor restaurant windows</p>
<p>on the world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying, nah, there&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>Like, how the hell did this one happen?</p>
<p>But I was having a hard time mentally processing</p>
<p>that the building was gone.</p>
<p>And believe me, if you don&rsquo;t have fear in this industry</p>
<p>and police, fire, military, then you&rsquo;re kidding yourself</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re a danger to everyone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care who it is, as tough as they are, this and that.</p>
<p>Everybody has a certain level of fear</p>
<p>with doing this.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t care how long you do it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always that chance of something going bad.</p>
<p>And everyone who does it has that certain amount of fear.</p>
<p>But at that point, it was such a feeling of disbelief</p>
<p>that fear wasn&rsquo;t even kicking in.</p>
<p>It was just like, what the hell just happened?</p>
<p>And I honestly think it was almost like a shock.</p>
<p>And it just stayed that whole day.</p>
<p>So the building is, before it collapses, is burning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just burning.</p>
<p>I mean, upper floors, up in the 78th, up to the 80s.</p>
<p>And then the way that the cut was from the plane,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just straight across.</p>
<p>It was from the 78th, then on up to maybe the 86th.</p>
<p>And then the jet fuel had come down and was burning down.</p>
<p>And there was people on the ground</p>
<p>who were doused with jet fuel that was already burning.</p>
<p>And they were lit on fire on the ground.</p>
<p>It was just insane how vast the destruction path was.</p>
<p>As a firefighter, what are you supposed</p>
<p>to do with that scale of fire?</p>
<p>I think the first bosses in, the first chiefs,</p>
<p>were just going to do their best to get,</p>
<p>as we get hose lines, what our whole theory is,</p>
<p>or our tactics is, to get water at the fire,</p>
<p>at the base of the fire, and get the truck company,</p>
<p>which is the ladder company.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the guys who break the doors down, put ladders up,</p>
<p>this and that, to get them to where the life is most</p>
<p>expected and get them out of there.</p>
<p>So I think the chiefs tactics at that point</p>
<p>was, let me get multiple engine companies.</p>
<p>Let me get four, five, six hose lines</p>
<p>fighting this fire, this massive fire.</p>
<p>And let me get 15, 20 truck companies up there just</p>
<p>yoking people out of there.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you got to go up the stair.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>Yeah, guys had to walk up 80, 80, 90, 100 flights of stairs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s audio of officers and firefighters</p>
<p>speaking to each other on the radio channels.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, at that point in time,</p>
<p>we had very, very bad communication system.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d been fighting for years to get radios</p>
<p>that work properly.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t because it was a lot of money.</p>
<p>We fought for years to get the full bunker firefighting</p>
<p>suits, which is the pants and the coat.</p>
<p>We used to have just coats and these roll up rubber boots</p>
<p>and guys were burning to death and we had to fight.</p>
<p>And unfortunately we lost three guys</p>
<p>in one vicious, vicious fire in 1994.</p>
<p>And then they finally said, enough&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>Give these guys the gear.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a strange phenomenon in the first responder world</p>
<p>and in the military world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really one of the most important things</p>
<p>that takes place in society.</p>
<p>The most pertinent organizations.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t get the funding we need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll throw money at every nonsensical thing.</p>
<p>But when it comes to gear, equipment,</p>
<p>protective equipment, trucks, this couldn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Just all the ways you could take care of people.</p>
<p>I saw since 9 11, the wars in the Middle East</p>
<p>have cost America over six trillion dollars.</p>
<p>And the amount of that money that was spent</p>
<p>on the soldiers, in this case the first responders,</p>
<p>is minimal.</p>
<p>Compared to it, yeah.</p>
<p>Almost nothing.</p>
<p>They, Lex, they closed down.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s either seven or eight.</p>
<p>In May of 2002, they closed down nine firehouses</p>
<p>in New York City for budget reasons.</p>
<p>We hadn&rsquo;t even finished cleaning up</p>
<p>the World Trade Center site and they slashed the budget.</p>
<p>And still to this day, have not reopened those firehouses.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million more people now living in New York City</p>
<p>than there were in 2001.</p>
<p>And the fire protection is way less than it was.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a sin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a sin.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a difficult question?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this famous photograph of a falling man.</p>
<p>So many people had to decide when they&rsquo;re above the fire,</p>
<p>in the fire, whether to jump out of the building</p>
<p>or to burn to death.</p>
<p>What do you make of that decision?</p>
<p>What do you make of that situation?</p>
<p>Those people who jumped,</p>
<p>those were acts of sheer desperation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in fires and just minor burns,</p>
<p>but minor in situation.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been trapped, caught somewhat.</p>
<p>Ended up in a burn center for nothing serious at all.</p>
<p>But for those brief seconds, half a minute was,</p>
<p>thank God, if I didn&rsquo;t have my fire gear on,</p>
<p>I would have been burned to a very, very horrible level.</p>
<p>Those people were burning alive.</p>
<p>And they had the choice of either to stay there</p>
<p>and burn alive or to launch themselves.</p>
<p>And some of them, I don&rsquo;t fault them,</p>
<p>but they had a few folks, they won&rsquo;t show it anymore</p>
<p>because they say, I don&rsquo;t know why it offends some people,</p>
<p>but they had a couple folks that took umbrellas</p>
<p>and they took garbage bags</p>
<p>because they thought that it would slow down</p>
<p>their acceleration rate to the ground</p>
<p>and maybe, just maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t be killed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, to me, a true sense of desperation for humanity</p>
<p>to say, I&rsquo;m going to die either way,</p>
<p>but let me take my chance.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know the exact number of those folks</p>
<p>who did that, but our first member of the fire department</p>
<p>killed firefighter Daniel Serf, aged 216,</p>
<p>was struck by a jumper.</p>
<p>And one of my dear friends was ordered to help take him</p>
<p>and they knew he was passed away</p>
<p>because he was hit by a flying missile.</p>
<p>I mean, 120 miles an hour, a body lands on you.</p>
<p>Those two bodies are now crushed.</p>
<p>And they were ordered to take that firefighter</p>
<p>and bring him across the street to Engine 10, Ladder 10.</p>
<p>It was literally a firehouse, less than 100 yards</p>
<p>from the facade of the Trade Center,</p>
<p>from the Trade Center complex.</p>
<p>They were literally right there.</p>
<p>And there was plane parts that went into that firehouse,</p>
<p>landed into the front doors onto the roof,</p>
<p>but the building itself was not destroyed.</p>
<p>So it was used as a mini command center for quite a while.</p>
<p>So my friend was ordered to take Daniel&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>in respect and bring it over to this firehouse</p>
<p>and give it some semblance of dignity</p>
<p>and lay it out on one of the bunk rooms,</p>
<p>the bunks we have in the bunkhouse,</p>
<p>and just cover it with a sheet and put a sign,</p>
<p>please firefighter killed, do not disturb,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll get to him later</p>
<p>because obviously this operation is gonna go on for days.</p>
<p>And my friend, who&rsquo;s such a great, wonderful guy,</p>
<p>is so still to this day, filled with guilt</p>
<p>because if they weren&rsquo;t taking his body out</p>
<p>with the respect and dignity that they did,</p>
<p>it took a while because it&rsquo;s a tough situation.</p>
<p>His ladder company was coming over the bridge.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous picture of Ladder 118.</p>
<p>You see this tractor trailer fire truck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one when the guy in the back also drives.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a zoomed out shot, and you see the Brooklyn Bridge,</p>
<p>and you see only the fire truck in the middle,</p>
<p>and you see the two burning towers in the distance.</p>
<p>Well, his engine company was just ahead of them</p>
<p>on the bridge, and the only reason that engine company lived</p>
<p>is their initial duty assignment</p>
<p>was to take that firefighter and bring his body over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the military.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t leave anyone behind.</p>
<p>These are our guys.</p>
<p>As some guys say, it&rsquo;s all about the guy right next to you,</p>
<p>and nothing else really matters.</p>
<p>When that guy right next to you goes down, it stops.</p>
<p>You get that guy to safety,</p>
<p>or if he&rsquo;s dead, you get him out.</p>
<p>So in that time frame, that saved his life.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a heavy burden to carry now</p>
<p>for the rest of your life,</p>
<p>because you say, if I wasn&rsquo;t helping my dead friend,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dead.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What did it look like at Ground Zero?</p>
<p>What did it feel like?</p>
<p>What did it smell like?</p>
<p>What, you said there was a sense</p>
<p>that it was almost like a war zone,</p>
<p>but can you paint a picture of how much dust is in the air?</p>
<p>How hot is it?</p>
<p>How many people are there?</p>
<p>And again, how did it feel like?</p>
<p>It was just, it was a scene of controlled chaos,</p>
<p>controlled because there was a semblance of command,</p>
<p>and we were just trying to do our jobs.</p>
<p>But it was such a frantic pace</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re now digging frantically,</p>
<p>knowing that there&rsquo;s life underneath this pile.</p>
<p>And this is throughout the afternoon</p>
<p>of that day, the evening.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this was nonstop,</p>
<p>just nonstop, really, for days.</p>
<p>But for my particular crew, we literally kept going.</p>
<p>We initially were dispatched over towards number seven,</p>
<p>had just gone down,</p>
<p>and we were searching the post office that was there.</p>
<p>There was reports of people trapped.</p>
<p>And we painstakingly searched every single inch</p>
<p>of that building to make sure no one was left in there.</p>
<p>And then we were deployed to the pile,</p>
<p>and the pile is sort of ambiguous</p>
<p>because it was just such a vast, vast pile.</p>
<p>I mean, it went for city blocks.</p>
<p>And we were assisting in the retrieval</p>
<p>of two Port Authority police officers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re lucky enough to survive, but they were trapped.</p>
<p>They were deep down into a crevasse,</p>
<p>and they had to be physically dug out and extricated.</p>
<p>So there was a couple hundred, few hundred guys involved</p>
<p>in that process of bringing in equipment,</p>
<p>jaws of life, airbags to lift steel,</p>
<p>to cut pieces of steel.</p>
<p>It was just a huge operation.</p>
<p>And we were back toward the logistics end of it,</p>
<p>shuttling in gear and bringing in stretchers,</p>
<p>bringing in oxygen, whatever was needed.</p>
<p>And you were trying to climb over</p>
<p>this jagged pile of debris.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like you just walked 100 feet</p>
<p>on a street with something.</p>
<p>You were trying to climb over this I beam</p>
<p>and then down into this hole and then back up that hole.</p>
<p>I mean, just to run one piece of equipment</p>
<p>took a half an hour to get 100 feet, 200 feet.</p>
<p>You know, mind you, some of these pieces of equipment</p>
<p>are 100 pounds, you know, generator for hearse tools,</p>
<p>this massive motor on a frame.</p>
<p>Unstable ground.</p>
<p>Unstable ground, just horrible conditions.</p>
<p>Fires were still burning aside you, beneath you.</p>
<p>And at one point, I kind of veered off to the side</p>
<p>and I was with this other fireman</p>
<p>from my father&rsquo;s old ladder company, 172.</p>
<p>And it was strange because we were quite a bit down,</p>
<p>like 70 feet down into this ravine of debris.</p>
<p>And he says, brother, what do you hear?</p>
<p>And at the time it was like dust,</p>
<p>it was like sand just falling down a pile</p>
<p>and it was hissing from gas pipes and water pipes.</p>
<p>And I said, I hear the gas lines,</p>
<p>I hear the sand, I hear the concrete.</p>
<p>He goes, no, no, what else do you hear?</p>
<p>And just the side of us was a lady&rsquo;s pocketbook</p>
<p>and a high heel shoe and someone&rsquo;s sneaker</p>
<p>with nobody with it.</p>
<p>And I said, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t hear anything.</p>
<p>He says, me neither.</p>
<p>He goes, no one&rsquo;s coming out of here.</p>
<p>And I said, no, no, no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be someone coming out of here.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just thousands of people in here</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re coming out.</p>
<p>He says, brother, we would hear them calling for help,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>And I still at that point thought there was a chance.</p>
<p>And after about the fourth day,</p>
<p>they just said, this is a recovery now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more life, there&rsquo;s no more chance.</p>
<p>And then that first night we went full tilt</p>
<p>till my crew, my specific crew of 12, 15 guys.</p>
<p>And four in the morning, we just couldn&rsquo;t breathe anymore.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t see, we were caked just with,</p>
<p>it was like if you took flour</p>
<p>and just kept dousing yourself.</p>
<p>And the Lieutenant just said, look, guys,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go back, we&rsquo;re gonna get some medical aid</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll come back in a few hours.</p>
<p>And we took a city bus back through the battery tunnel</p>
<p>and unbeknownst to us that morning,</p>
<p>this off duty firefighter,</p>
<p>Steven Siller from Squad Company One,</p>
<p>he raced down there with his pickup</p>
<p>and he couldn&rsquo;t go any further</p>
<p>because the traffic was stopped up</p>
<p>because they had a report of a bomb.</p>
<p>So everything was held up and he grabbed his fire gear</p>
<p>and he put it on, stuff weighs about 60 pounds.</p>
<p>And he ran through the tunnel.</p>
<p>Two and a half miles, got to the end of the tunnel,</p>
<p>fire truck was coming in from the other way.</p>
<p>He hopped on the back, got him up to West Street,</p>
<p>jumped off, tried to look for his company,</p>
<p>where they were and he was never seen again.</p>
<p>He just ran through the tunnel.</p>
<p>Ran through the tunnel and he got there</p>
<p>to help his team, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the team,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about the guy right next to you.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, Steven.</p>
<p>His brother Frank decided in his name in perpetuity,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a fund that now builds a home</p>
<p>for every Gold Star family,</p>
<p>for every seriously battle wounded warrior,</p>
<p>for every seriously wounded first responder</p>
<p>or killed in a line of duty first responder.</p>
<p>If they had a home, they&rsquo;ll pay the mortgage.</p>
<p>If they didn&rsquo;t have a home, they give them a home.</p>
<p>And especially if it&rsquo;s a severely battle wounded,</p>
<p>they give them a smart home</p>
<p>because these poor guys come home with no limbs.</p>
<p>And so the beauty of Steven and his selfless act</p>
<p>was that he&rsquo;s now helped thousands and thousands of people.</p>
<p>I mean, the Tunnel to Towers is incredible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of our mission is to bring awareness</p>
<p>to these great people at Tunnel to Towers, what they do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve raised $250 million to help protect the protectors,</p>
<p>to rescue the rescuers in a what&rsquo;s become, unfortunately,</p>
<p>a somewhat ungrateful society.</p>
<p>But they will not forget these great guys.</p>
<p>So you tell Steven&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the 20 people that you talk about</p>
<p>in the new Iron Labs 20 for 20 podcast series.</p>
<p>If you can just linger on his story a little longer,</p>
<p>what does that tell you about the human spirit?</p>
<p>That this guy, the Tunnel couldn&rsquo;t drive through,</p>
<p>so he just puts on that heavy pack and runs.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>That shows the depth of a man&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>He could have turned around and went home to his family,</p>
<p>and nobody would have shamed him.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s one of those beautiful, brave people</p>
<p>that take a job that really doesn&rsquo;t pay a lot of money.</p>
<p>And you become a cop or a firefighter or a nurse or an EMT</p>
<p>or a medic or a soldier or a Marine or airman, sailor.</p>
<p>When you take these jobs, you don&rsquo;t do it for fanfare.</p>
<p>You definitely don&rsquo;t do it for money.</p>
<p>I mean, those 13 brave souls we lost a week or two ago</p>
<p>in Afghanistan, they&rsquo;re brand new soldiers and Marines.</p>
<p>They make $22,000 an hour,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t work 40 hours a week.</p>
<p>They work 80, they work 90 hours a week.</p>
<p>So they make it about six bucks an hour.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>They sign off.</p>
<p>And firefighters and cops and medics and EMTs,</p>
<p>nurses, emergency room doctors,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really make a lot of money.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re starting salary right now for a New York cop.</p>
<p>I was a New York cop for two years first.</p>
<p>I made 12.25 an hour back in 1989 to get shot at</p>
<p>during the crack wars.</p>
<p>If you made $11 an hour with a family of four,</p>
<p>you were entitled to welfare back then.</p>
<p>So I was just above the welfare level, risking my life.</p>
<p>And these are the guys that are getting ripped up now.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And look, I won&rsquo;t get into any politics,</p>
<p>but like that says something about someone&rsquo;s soul</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re willing to take a job like that</p>
<p>and get now, get zero respect.</p>
<p>So a guy like Steven, what that shows is the depth</p>
<p>of that man&rsquo;s soul and courage and determination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to be selfless in this world anymore,</p>
<p>but I still know a lot of selfless people</p>
<p>that just put on equipment every day, bulletproof vests,</p>
<p>fire bunker gear, stethoscopes,</p>
<p>you know, flak jackets, military helmets,</p>
<p>and they go in and they do it smiling.</p>
<p>That young Marine that passed last week,</p>
<p>she was photographed and quoted as saying,</p>
<p>I have my dream job,</p>
<p>but she was holding a little Afghani baby.</p>
<p>And she was dead a few days later.</p>
<p>She was so thrilled to be making $7 an hour</p>
<p>helping people, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that huge?</p>
<p>Like that to me says,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a true sign of character right there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important for our society</p>
<p>to elevate those people as heroes.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about firefighting.</p>
<p>What do you think it means to be a great firefighter</p>
<p>and a great man, a great human being</p>
<p>in a situation like you were in in 9 11?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s kind of a broad term.</p>
<p>Like some, you know, you can go to different firehouses</p>
<p>and they might have a different definition</p>
<p>of what they consider a great firefighter.</p>
<p>But I think in the industry as a whole,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re willing to put everyone else before you,</p>
<p>especially your team, you know,</p>
<p>as we say, there ain&rsquo;t no I in team, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s T E A M and there&rsquo;s no I in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about those guys and girls next to you.</p>
<p>If you can do that, that makes you pretty great.</p>
<p>You put everything else second and you just run in</p>
<p>and you run in with that team for strangers.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve had the honor of,</p>
<p>I spent almost 25 years of my adult life serving humanity,</p>
<p>my country, my former city.</p>
<p>And the people I worked with were giants.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean that in height,</p>
<p>I mean, but I mean that in spirit and in soul.</p>
<p>I saw some of the most heroic, selfless acts.</p>
<p>And then I saw some of the behind the scenes</p>
<p>that were so impressive.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;d go to the movies,</p>
<p>so impressive, you know, we&rsquo;d go to a fire around Christmas</p>
<p>and the family would lose everything.</p>
<p>And even when I was a cop, same thing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d come back either to the police precinct</p>
<p>or the firehouse or the EMS station.</p>
<p>And someone would put together a collection and say,</p>
<p>hey guys, hey Lex, 50 bucks a man,</p>
<p>you know, the Smith&rsquo;s down the street,</p>
<p>just lost everything, we&rsquo;re gonna go get some presents</p>
<p>for the kids and some turkeys.</p>
<p>And not one of those guys questioned that.</p>
<p>And they were making 12.25 an hour</p>
<p>and they still came up with 50 bucks for that family.</p>
<p>But see, that&rsquo;s the stuff the press won&rsquo;t show you, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna show that humanity, that soft edge.</p>
<p>See, when you&rsquo;re a warrior, you need to have</p>
<p>this rough shield, this rough exterior.</p>
<p>Cause if you don&rsquo;t, you die.</p>
<p>But a true great firefighter or responder or a cop</p>
<p>or military personnel, they have that rough exterior</p>
<p>with that soft underbelly, that heart, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, to me, the true great ones.</p>
<p>Some of them, they just have a hard time doing that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shame in showing your soft side.</p>
<p>Well, you got your dad to say I love you back.</p>
<p>No, that was huge, man.</p>
<p>That took me 22 years, Lex.</p>
<p>So you were a firefighter for 21, I was 22 years.</p>
<p>Why did you become a firefighter?</p>
<p>Oh, my dad, I mean, I was five years old</p>
<p>and I went to his firehouse and there was these,</p>
<p>at the time, they looked like giants to me with mustaches</p>
<p>and the trucks smelled like smoke and the gear smelled</p>
<p>like smoke and the tires and the diesel fuel</p>
<p>and that one was like, this is what I&rsquo;m gonna do.</p>
<p>And then they bring you in the kitchen</p>
<p>and they stuff you with ice cream and cake and everything.</p>
<p>And then I go home to my mom, shaking with a sugar cone</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s mad at my dad, but yeah, it was just,</p>
<p>oh, I was like, I gotta do this.</p>
<p>It was like, they were like a baseball team in a garage</p>
<p>with a truck and these big tools and big coats and helmets</p>
<p>and they were just laughing and having fun</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, yeah, man, I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p>And I knew, I was obsessed with it.</p>
<p>I mean, I was so pissed that the fireman&rsquo;s test came out</p>
<p>when I was 14 and I couldn&rsquo;t take it, you had to be 18.</p>
<p>And it was done, the test was graded and whatever.</p>
<p>So my dad, now there&rsquo;s a copy circulating</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s old now.</p>
<p>And he goes, yeah, yeah, this is what you&rsquo;re in for.</p>
<p>And I took it and I did it like it was real</p>
<p>and I got a 99 and I was so pissed.</p>
<p>I said, I wanna get hired.</p>
<p>He goes, you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re 14.</p>
<p>But I just wanted to do it so bad</p>
<p>and I just wanted to help people.</p>
<p>I just wanted to be like my dad,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d come home smiling as tired as he was</p>
<p>and he fought fires in the 60s and 70s</p>
<p>when the city was burning and he&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>as exhausted as he was, he&rsquo;d still be smiling.</p>
<p>I wanted to smile at work and I used to,</p>
<p>I got paid to laugh and joke.</p>
<p>I got paid to cry sometimes.</p>
<p>But man, we laughed a lot.</p>
<p>We really, it was, the chop breaking is just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just unending and it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind, can you tell me,</p>
<p>you were really kind enough to give me</p>
<p>one of these shirts with 114.</p>
<p>Can you tell me the story of 114 and Tally Ho?</p>
<p>I wear proudly, I served eight years in that command</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t finish my career there.</p>
<p>I passed the lieutenant&rsquo;s test</p>
<p>and once you do, you have to leave.</p>
<p>The story behind Tally Ho is back in World War II,</p>
<p>there was this gentleman named Bad Jack Carroll</p>
<p>and Jack was an airborne ranger</p>
<p>and my father in law was also on the department</p>
<p>and he knew Jack.</p>
<p>And Jack came home, Jack jumped Normandy</p>
<p>and stormed up through the Battle of the Bulls in Bastogne</p>
<p>and he came back, greatest generation as they all did</p>
<p>and they got jobs and they went right to work</p>
<p>and they were treated better back then, vets, right?</p>
<p>And he got on the New York City Fire Department</p>
<p>and he got assigned a ladder 114</p>
<p>and they first got radios back then</p>
<p>and when Jack, he would drive the truck,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re up there with the officer,</p>
<p>either the lieutenant or captain,</p>
<p>so if the boss is off the truck,</p>
<p>you operate the radio for them as the driver.</p>
<p>So when they called him and they&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>you know, ladder 114 responding to 52nd Street,</p>
<p>3rd Avenue, Structure Fire,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to get back and say,</p>
<p>ladder 114, 10 four, but he refused to do that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d say, ladder 114, Tally Ho,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d yell</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;d jump out the plane.</p>
<p>So all these years later, it stuck</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a little bit of a bragging right,</p>
<p>but out of 350 engine and truck companies</p>
<p>in the whole New York City Fire Department,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re pretty much the only one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called by their nickname on the radio,</p>
<p>not their number.</p>
<p>So it tweaked some guys off in other places,</p>
<p>you know, they may F you, Tally Ho,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just, yeah, it&rsquo;s a great, great heritage</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re really proud and Shamrock was,</p>
<p>he was Irish and a lot of the guys back then</p>
<p>were Irish immigrants from the area,</p>
<p>from the neighborhood,</p>
<p>and they would actually take the fire truck</p>
<p>to church on Sunday and park out front</p>
<p>and one guy would stay in it to hear the radio</p>
<p>in case they got a call.</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s the proud history.</p>
<p>And you said that if I wear this around New York,</p>
<p>am I getting a little bit of?</p>
<p>You might get a guy from the Bronx,</p>
<p>go, hey, Tally Ho, screw you, you know?</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s all that good rivalry, you know?</p>
<p>We like to, you know, we like to kid each other</p>
<p>back and forth, you know, guys from Manhattan,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll say, yeah, you guys are in Brooklyn,</p>
<p>yeah, short buildings, tall stories.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah, you guys are in Manhattan,</p>
<p>tall buildings, no stories, you know?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just all that jocular ball break</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s good stuff, you know?</p>
<p>Let me ask, I guess, a difficult question.</p>
<p>If you just step back on the events of 9 11,</p>
<p>on the side of the people that flew into the towers,</p>
<p>what do you take away from that day about the nature,</p>
<p>about human nature, about good and evil?</p>
<p>How did that change your view of the world?</p>
<p>I witnessed evil firsthand.</p>
<p>I remember later on, well into that night</p>
<p>when we were trying to help get those police officers out,</p>
<p>I remember looking up at the building, Century 21,</p>
<p>the store runs along the east side of the towers</p>
<p>and it was still there and the debris had come down</p>
<p>right almost to the edge.</p>
<p>Century 21 is this old storied department store</p>
<p>in New York City and the sign was there</p>
<p>and it was still lit up, like some of the neon was broken</p>
<p>but I think some of it was actually still lit up</p>
<p>and I just looked around and I was like,</p>
<p>this is a war zone, like we&rsquo;re at war.</p>
<p>And we knew we were attacked, we heard the fighter planes</p>
<p>and back then it wasn&rsquo;t the extensive communication</p>
<p>network and we had cell phones but they were the old school</p>
<p>flip phones and there was no news on them</p>
<p>and so plus we didn&rsquo;t have signal down there anyway.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t reach my family for like 12, 13 hours</p>
<p>and my dad had deployed down to the ferry terminal</p>
<p>to retrieve bodies.</p>
<p>He was retired but he still went and they deployed him</p>
<p>to go be basically the morgue transport guys.</p>
<p>They expected to be sending hundreds and thousands</p>
<p>of bodies across on the ferry and they set up</p>
<p>these tractor trailers as a mobile morgue</p>
<p>and that never happened because there were no bodies</p>
<p>to take, they were all buried.</p>
<p>So I saw evil firsthand, I don&rsquo;t know how someone</p>
<p>can inflict such revenge or a vengeful act</p>
<p>in the name of anything, in the name of a religion,</p>
<p>in the name of a cause, in the name, like what the hell?</p>
<p>Were you ever able to make sense of that,</p>
<p>why men are able to commit such acts of terror</p>
<p>in the days and the years after?</p>
<p>No, Lex, I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s from Ireland and I still have a lot of family there</p>
<p>and my great uncles, one of them was dragged out and shot.</p>
<p>He lived but just based on a rumor that he was in the IRA</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t happy to see what happened to my mom&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>because they were victimized and brutalized</p>
<p>by England at that time.</p>
<p>But blowing up bombs and killing innocents</p>
<p>in the name of that, it doesn&rsquo;t make it right.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t justify something like that.</p>
<p>I can see, I was a cop, I was a soldier</p>
<p>and you never wanna take life and those jobs</p>
<p>but sometimes you have to.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t do it with a vengeance,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do it with a thirst,</p>
<p>you do it because it&rsquo;s necessary for survival.</p>
<p>When you do it out of a bloodlust, out of a thirst,</p>
<p>out of a cause, that&rsquo;s evil, there&rsquo;s something wrong</p>
<p>with you, I have no, I respect life to the highest level.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m very, life is sacred to me, it&rsquo;s precious,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beyond, it&rsquo;s not a commodity, it&rsquo;s a gift.</p>
<p>But to take life just so randomly,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s something way wrong with that person</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;m a conflicted soul</p>
<p>but I would have no problem seeing someone like that</p>
<p>put to death because they do not deserve life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many children around me</p>
<p>and many children around this world</p>
<p>that are being taught to hate someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s different than them just because the person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s allegedly teaching them says so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>Well, that starts with just having a basic respect</p>
<p>and appreciation of other human beings</p>
<p>and that starts with empathy.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons I love this country,</p>
<p>while joking that I&rsquo;m Russian, maybe you could say the same</p>
<p>as you being Irish, you&rsquo;re actually truly an American</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I consider myself very much an American.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons I love this country</p>
<p>is it serves as a beacon.</p>
<p>I still believe it serves as a beacon of hope</p>
<p>and that empathy and love for the rest of the world</p>
<p>that hate is not gonna get you far,</p>
<p>that love will get you a lot farther.</p>
<p>And I still think sometimes it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>to see the press, mainstream media,</p>
<p>you could see social networks.</p>
<p>Because you can make so much money on division,</p>
<p>sometimes because it makes so much money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to think like we&rsquo;re really divided.</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t think we are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like the very surface level thing</p>
<p>we see on Twitter and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re 100% right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people out there that are maximizing</p>
<p>off this whole division, right?</p>
<p>They want us divided, they want people angry</p>
<p>because it sells.</p>
<p>A lot of these people that are in charge</p>
<p>of certain organizations, well, they all seem to have</p>
<p>nice cars and nice houses and nice vacations</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re constantly trying to convince everybody</p>
<p>that we hate each other.</p>
<p>To me, I&rsquo;ll use a fireman analogy, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little campfire.</p>
<p>And if you just let the embers flutter, they&rsquo;ll go out.</p>
<p>But if you take a little cup of gasoline with those embers,</p>
<p>boom, it&rsquo;ll blow right up in your face.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a lot of these politicians</p>
<p>and a lot of these media folks are doing</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something in it for them.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s possible to defeat them</p>
<p>with great leaders, with great spokespeople,</p>
<p>with great human beings having a voice.</p>
<p>One of the powerful things with the internet</p>
<p>is more and more people have a voice.</p>
<p>And I ultimately believe, certainly in America,</p>
<p>but in the world, the good people outnumber the assholes.</p>
<p>Oh, I agree.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s days when I think the assholes</p>
<p>are overrunning us, but you know what?</p>
<p>I think what the downfall of the world is</p>
<p>is ego and arrogance and people that think they&rsquo;re better</p>
<p>than that other guy.</p>
<p>My parents raised me to be this way.</p>
<p>My mom is such a sweet, gentle soul.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an immigrant.</p>
<p>She came here at 16 years old.</p>
<p>She helps everybody but herself, right?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just one of those people.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s sick.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d never know it.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s still flying around her condo complex</p>
<p>helping everybody because that&rsquo;s what she does.</p>
<p>She loves to help people.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s been in their shoes.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been poor.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s sick.</p>
<p>Her husband was sick.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s had all sorts of suffering and loss in her life.</p>
<p>My granddad died when my mom was 10</p>
<p>and she was one of 10 children that survived out of 14.</p>
<p>She knows hard times, but she so appreciates the good times</p>
<p>and the goodness of this country.</p>
<p>You know, the fire department</p>
<p>and the police department, military,</p>
<p>it taught me a lot about empathy</p>
<p>and trying to really feel for someone</p>
<p>and put yourself in their situation.</p>
<p>I remember years back, I was a much younger fireman.</p>
<p>I was probably five years on the job.</p>
<p>And I was sent down to the next firehouse over to fill in.</p>
<p>You know, we would get sent around randomly</p>
<p>when they needed an extra guy.</p>
<p>And someone came banging on the firehouse door</p>
<p>and in the tenement apartment next door,</p>
<p>they said there was an older woman that was unconscious.</p>
<p>So we dispatched ourselves</p>
<p>and we ran over with a medical kit</p>
<p>and it was an elderly woman laying there on the bed.</p>
<p>And she was obviously not breathing.</p>
<p>She was obviously in cardiac arrest</p>
<p>and an older gentleman that was holding her hand,</p>
<p>just inconsolably crying.</p>
<p>And it turned out it was her husband</p>
<p>and they were married for 65 years.</p>
<p>And normally we would just respectfully ask</p>
<p>the family members to just step aside</p>
<p>and let us do our work.</p>
<p>And I realized that he wouldn&rsquo;t leave her side.</p>
<p>So I kind of gave the crew a wink</p>
<p>and they were doing CPR on what they had to.</p>
<p>And I just let him keep holding her hand.</p>
<p>And I said, sir, if you, you know,</p>
<p>could you just come over just a little bit so we can work?</p>
<p>And I held his hand as he held hers.</p>
<p>And I said, sir, I said, do you have faith?</p>
<p>And he did.</p>
<p>And I said, would you like to pray with me for your wife?</p>
<p>And he said, I would like to.</p>
<p>So we said the Lord&rsquo;s prayer</p>
<p>and you know, I just asked God to protect her and bless her.</p>
<p>And I think he realized that she didn&rsquo;t have a chance,</p>
<p>but we still gave her that chance.</p>
<p>And we, you know, got her in the ambulance</p>
<p>and maybe it was wrong to try to make it look</p>
<p>like we could save her, but you know,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really not try.</p>
<p>But the one beautiful moment was he thanked me</p>
<p>and he was almost okay with it at that point.</p>
<p>Like he wasn&rsquo;t as upset.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t as distraught because I tried to just humanize</p>
<p>that situation of what we were trying to do.</p>
<p>We were trying to do our best,</p>
<p>but we also tried to be compassionate to his sadness.</p>
<p>And it just, I walked away just feeling so good,</p>
<p>even though it was a tragic situation.</p>
<p>And she did pass that, you know, he came by to, you know,</p>
<p>thank us days later and just heartbreaking.</p>
<p>But you know, there&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just happens many,</p>
<p>many times throughout the country every day.</p>
<p>People get that opportunity as a responder to be</p>
<p>that last bridge to the family and the loved one.</p>
<p>And you only get that opportunity once sometimes</p>
<p>and you really have to, to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like your moment to shine.</p>
<p>You know, you could just be very,</p>
<p>very dismissive and very rude,</p>
<p>or you could be compassionate and just show,</p>
<p>hey, I have a mom, I have a grandma, I have, you know,</p>
<p>and just in your mind, pretend that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who you&rsquo;re working on and that&rsquo;s who you&rsquo;re with.</p>
<p>So that moment of compassion, that moment of empathy,</p>
<p>even if his brief can be the thing that saves the person</p>
<p>from suffering, make the difference between suffering</p>
<p>and overcoming in the face of tragedy.</p>
<p>Yes, like I felt that even though obviously his loss</p>
<p>was still huge, it just made it a little more bearable</p>
<p>and, you know, tried to just take his grief down</p>
<p>to a lower level and it made me feel,</p>
<p>just feel really good about doing it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a powerful way to see the job of a first responder.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to deal with certain aspects</p>
<p>of the tragedy, but it&rsquo;s to provide somebody</p>
<p>with that moment of compassion.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you know, I made it a little habit</p>
<p>because sometimes with faith,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of a tricky subject.</p>
<p>So every time I had someone who died,</p>
<p>which unfortunately was many, many times,</p>
<p>I would just touch their hand</p>
<p>and just say a little quick prayer and just say,</p>
<p>look, you know, I hope you&rsquo;re moving on to a better place.</p>
<p>I hope if you did have faith that it&rsquo;s strong as you depart</p>
<p>and if you didn&rsquo;t have faith,</p>
<p>I hope maybe at your last moment that you found some</p>
<p>and you just found some closure.</p>
<p>So that was just my little ritual, I think.</p>
<p>I just, you know, I felt it was important</p>
<p>that that person, even though they were a stranger,</p>
<p>just had someone there just sort of hoping</p>
<p>for the best for them in their last moments.</p>
<p>You mentioned cancer.</p>
<p>You had a rare leukemia due to all the work</p>
<p>that you did at Ground Zero.</p>
<p>Can you maybe talk to the experience</p>
<p>of just breathing through those days</p>
<p>and what that was like, being unable to breathe,</p>
<p>being overwhelmed by all of the dust in the air?</p>
<p>Yes, the first day especially, we didn&rsquo;t have equipment.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have breathing apparatus</p>
<p>and then we were handed little 69 cent</p>
<p>hardware store dust mask, you know,</p>
<p>it was a little thin paint mask</p>
<p>that would just get sweated up</p>
<p>and sticking to your face within 30 seconds.</p>
<p>So you would just, they were useless.</p>
<p>And what you wound up feeling like was</p>
<p>that you swallowed a box of razor blades</p>
<p>because there was glass and there was cement</p>
<p>and it was just so caustic.</p>
<p>And I remember that night, you know,</p>
<p>when we went back just to get some medical relief</p>
<p>for the few hours, we were walking up the hill</p>
<p>to the firehouse because they dropped us off</p>
<p>like a block away down at Engine 201&rsquo;s quarters</p>
<p>and one of the older firemen as we&rsquo;re walking up the block,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all struggling, we&rsquo;re all having a hard time breathing</p>
<p>and just, I mean, I felt like I was dying,</p>
<p>literally, it was pretty bad.</p>
<p>And I just remember the one guy going out,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all dead.</p>
<p>And I said, no, no, we made it, we made it.</p>
<p>He goes, no, you don&rsquo;t get it, kid.</p>
<p>He said, we just breathed in poison after poison for hours</p>
<p>and then that went into days and then went into months.</p>
<p>He says, we&rsquo;re all dead, man, this is gonna take us all.</p>
<p>And I thought he was crazy and then now years later,</p>
<p>like starting in 03 or 04,</p>
<p>guys just started coming down with these really rare</p>
<p>and advanced cancers and then it just stopped</p>
<p>being a coincidence with the number of guys</p>
<p>and they were young, one of the first guys, John McNamara,</p>
<p>he was 33 or 34 and he came down colon cancer</p>
<p>and it took him quickly in 2000, he was in 2005.</p>
<p>And I kind of said to friends and family,</p>
<p>I said, I feel like I&rsquo;m running through a minefield</p>
<p>and I wonder when I&rsquo;m gonna step on my mind</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s gonna get sick.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t feeling well from 2008 on,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on it, but I just wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>And in 2011, I failed my medical,</p>
<p>my bloods came back horrifically wrong</p>
<p>and they pulled me off the truck,</p>
<p>but they strung me out for a month,</p>
<p>the doctors in the fire department,</p>
<p>one of them said my spleen was engorged</p>
<p>because I was probably drinking myself to death,</p>
<p>like as he said, most of the guys did after 9 11,</p>
<p>which was pretty wrong of him and stereotypical,</p>
<p>just to stereotype and to categorize</p>
<p>and guy couldn&rsquo;t have cared less,</p>
<p>he just, he was so crude and nasty.</p>
<p>And then my one doctor who was my doctor on the outside,</p>
<p>my blood pressure was 240 over 140,</p>
<p>my spleen was about to rupture,</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t even show up for my appointment</p>
<p>and I went down, passed out, the paramedics responded,</p>
<p>she got into an argument with a paramedic</p>
<p>because for big ego and basically telling him</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t really anything wrong</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s looking at my paperwork going,</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s got leukemia and he overrode her,</p>
<p>he raced me out of there down to Brooklyn Methodist</p>
<p>and the doctor, the charge physician, the ER physician,</p>
<p>he says, you&rsquo;re not leaving, you&rsquo;re in a bad way.</p>
<p>And I said, what is it?</p>
<p>He said, I need a little while to figure it out,</p>
<p>he goes, but you probably have one of a few different types</p>
<p>of leukemia, he said, I&rsquo;ll drill into your hip,</p>
<p>take your marrow and find out.</p>
<p>And he said, but in the meantime,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get the swelling on the spleen down,</p>
<p>I guess some sort of rapid medicines and whatnot</p>
<p>because my spleen is about to rupture.</p>
<p>I had no blood platelets left which is your clotter</p>
<p>so I basically would have bled to death</p>
<p>and I found out from my team of doctors</p>
<p>that I had about 48 hours to live</p>
<p>and that really set me off, I was infuriated</p>
<p>because I was telling them for a long time that I was sick.</p>
<p>The doctors failed you,</p>
<p>the few doctors in the beginning failed you.</p>
<p>I felt very betrayed and other guys had died</p>
<p>and I had it out with that one doctor,</p>
<p>I basically told her she was fired from my case</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s pretty politically in charge person</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t care, I jeopardized my job for it</p>
<p>because it was my life and I got the sense</p>
<p>that it didn&rsquo;t really matter to her.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have any empathy, as you say.</p>
<p>It was exact, so why for her, why for a few others,</p>
<p>was there not a special care, a special compassion</p>
<p>for, first of all, all humans,</p>
<p>but human beings in your position,</p>
<p>especially a firefighter, a first responder?</p>
<p>You know, Alex, I think what it is in the department,</p>
<p>their title is just to get us back to duty</p>
<p>as quickly as possible when we are either injured or sick</p>
<p>because what happens then is your replacement</p>
<p>is now in overtime so you&rsquo;re out being paid on medical leave</p>
<p>but then they need to replace your spot</p>
<p>and then that costs more money.</p>
<p>So I think it just behooves them</p>
<p>to get as many personnel back</p>
<p>and especially during the summertime,</p>
<p>they look at it like, oh, maybe you want a few extra days off</p>
<p>to go to the beach and this one doctor,</p>
<p>he tipped his hand back as if I was drinking</p>
<p>an alcohol beverage, he says, hey, busy summer?</p>
<p>Because I asked him to look at my spleen</p>
<p>which was sticking out of my abdomen like a football</p>
<p>and I said, excuse me, sir, I said,</p>
<p>how dare you assume that I&rsquo;m abusing alcohol</p>
<p>because alcohol abuse sometimes will present itself</p>
<p>as the spleen is engorged and having an issue.</p>
<p>So he automatically just assumed that that was my situation,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even give me an exam and I was horrified.</p>
<p>I was so angry, I mean, I wanted to punch this guy out</p>
<p>and I literally was screaming at him</p>
<p>and an executive officer came in to diffuse it</p>
<p>and sent me to another doctor</p>
<p>and when I showed her my paperwork, she was horrified.</p>
<p>She was like, what did he say?</p>
<p>And she said, oh, okay, go to your regular doctor tomorrow</p>
<p>who was one of the department doctors</p>
<p>and it was just an indifference.</p>
<p>It was like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I was shocked at the lack of compassion</p>
<p>but you know what, that being said, I&rsquo;m past it,</p>
<p>life moves on.</p>
<p>The team of doctors, I ended up with a Methodist</p>
<p>and my subsequent oncologist, Dr. Peter Menzel,</p>
<p>world class, just incredible human being.</p>
<p>My Dr. Pete is just, I love him.</p>
<p>I just, I love him like a friend, like a big brother,</p>
<p>like a father, like my primary oncology care nurse,</p>
<p>Mike Nunez, was just an incredible human being</p>
<p>and he knew I was frightened</p>
<p>because I had to get two and a half years of chemo</p>
<p>compressed into seven days or I was dead.</p>
<p>And these massive bags of chemo that never stopped</p>
<p>and they burned, the minute they went into your body,</p>
<p>you felt like you were burning to death</p>
<p>from the inside out.</p>
<p>And Mike, when Mike came in to hook me up,</p>
<p>he said, look, I have to wear a hazmat suit.</p>
<p>This stuff is so caustic that if it drips,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll burn whenever it touches.</p>
<p>And I was like, but Mike, you&rsquo;re gonna put that in my body.</p>
<p>How the hell is it not gonna kill me?</p>
<p>He says, no, no, this is exactly what it&rsquo;s supposed to do.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>So when he prepped the IV tube to get it flowing,</p>
<p>it spilled onto the tube</p>
<p>and the tube started to smoke and burn.</p>
<p>And I said, no effing way, Mike,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not putting that in me.</p>
<p>No way, no way.</p>
<p>And he goes, listen, let me get another one.</p>
<p>Let me start it over.</p>
<p>And here he is wearing a hazmat suit, looking at me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going, this is insane.</p>
<p>And he goes, he looked at me, he took my hand</p>
<p>and he says, Nels, if you don&rsquo;t take it, you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>He says, you got those three kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I have no other option.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>And I said, all right, Mike, okay.</p>
<p>And he hooked me up.</p>
<p>And you know what, it was like, you know,</p>
<p>if you do drink alcohol and you have like a shot</p>
<p>or want, you know, strong type spirit</p>
<p>and you start feeling that burn.</p>
<p>Well, the minute he hit me in the vein,</p>
<p>it just started going up my arm, burning</p>
<p>and then up my shoulder, across my neck, into my head,</p>
<p>across the rest of my body,</p>
<p>within a minute down to my feet.</p>
<p>And I was writhing in pain for seven days</p>
<p>and I was praying to die.</p>
<p>I was the seventh rescuer in six months</p>
<p>to come down with the rarest leukemia there is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only 500 cases in all of North America a year.</p>
<p>And seven of us came down in six months.</p>
<p>Two guys died during treatment.</p>
<p>Seven responders, police, fire.</p>
<p>Two guys died in the first couple of days of the treatment</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so vicious, your liver, your heart,</p>
<p>your kidneys, something will fail.</p>
<p>And I was praying and I was praying, but I wanted to die.</p>
<p>I was in so much pain.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t take a painkiller</p>
<p>because I know people with some issues</p>
<p>and I just didn&rsquo;t want to go there.</p>
<p>And finally on the last day I gave in,</p>
<p>I said, please, I can&rsquo;t do this anymore.</p>
<p>I was literally like jumping out of my skin</p>
<p>and they gave me something.</p>
<p>But it had burned out my mind, it burned out my body.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t hear, I could barely see, it was vicious.</p>
<p>But it worked.</p>
<p>And my nurses especially,</p>
<p>they just, they were so dedicated and devoted.</p>
<p>And I was not an easy patient</p>
<p>because I was in a lot of pain.</p>
<p>It was bad and it was, drove my friends, my family crazy.</p>
<p>It was just, it wasn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>But on that first night I had a quick vision</p>
<p>of all these people that I loved that were dead, that died.</p>
<p>A lot of them in a trade center and I saw Johnny,</p>
<p>I saw friends I grew up with.</p>
<p>The last one was my mother in law</p>
<p>who had passed six months before and she died of,</p>
<p>she was in a coma, she had a stroke.</p>
<p>She had a horrible, horrible last six months of life</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t fair because she was so religious.</p>
<p>She went to church every day, devout Catholic woman.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden I see her and she&rsquo;s smiling</p>
<p>and we used to talk a lot, it&rsquo;s the Irish thing,</p>
<p>like the gab, the gift of gab.</p>
<p>And she used to call me her boyfriend</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;d sit and talk for hours</p>
<p>and talk about books and about movies and about food.</p>
<p>I loved her, she was my friend.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;d say, you know, my boyfriend&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden she&rsquo;s smiling</p>
<p>and she goes, hi, my boyfriend.</p>
<p>And I says, Nan, Nan, what are you doing?</p>
<p>She goes, he&rsquo;s not ready, he doesn&rsquo;t want you.</p>
<p>You gotta go back, you got things to do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, Nan, Nan, it hurts so much.</p>
<p>Please, please take me and she left.</p>
<p>She goes, no, no, not yet, I&rsquo;ll see you.</p>
<p>And she just faded away.</p>
<p>And one of my doctors on my team,</p>
<p>she had a problem with religion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay, I understand that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a preacher, I have a faith,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t preach it, I don&rsquo;t push it.</p>
<p>I just live and let live.</p>
<p>So she sent in this shrink to see me.</p>
<p>And I was messed up from the chemo,</p>
<p>but I knew what I was seeing, I knew what I was saying.</p>
<p>And he was a Jewish gentleman.</p>
<p>He was a rabbi also in a synagogue.</p>
<p>And I actually had responded in that district</p>
<p>and he knew 114 would run into Borough Park.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I see Tyler, oh, they come down the street.</p>
<p>And he asked me to tell him the story and I did.</p>
<p>And he started laughing and he scared me now.</p>
<p>I says, Doc, am I really crazy?</p>
<p>He said, no, no.</p>
<p>He said, I believe you, my friend.</p>
<p>He said, we share the same God.</p>
<p>He goes, we work in the same corporation,</p>
<p>but in different departments.</p>
<p>And he says, you did see your mother in law.</p>
<p>He says, your faith is that strong.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;ve had many patients</p>
<p>express the same sentiments.</p>
<p>He said, so I want you to listen to her</p>
<p>and fight and be strong.</p>
<p>And he said, so what else do you want to talk about?</p>
<p>I said, well, I don&rsquo;t know, Doc, am I that messed up?</p>
<p>He goes, no, no.</p>
<p>He goes, they&rsquo;re paying me for an hour.</p>
<p>It only took 20 minutes.</p>
<p>So we watched the Yankee game together and that&rsquo;s less.</p>
<p>But it was just, again, it showed the human condition.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s these two men of two totally different faiths.</p>
<p>And yet we shared that bond of faith.</p>
<p>And he had empathy and he had sympathy.</p>
<p>And he saw me in many other patients.</p>
<p>So he just didn&rsquo;t assume.</p>
<p>And he gave me a fair shake</p>
<p>and I will always be grateful to him for that.</p>
<p>Through any of this, the pain you had to go through</p>
<p>with the leukemia, but also the days of 9 11</p>
<p>and after, did your faith get challenged?</p>
<p>You know, Lex, it was strange.</p>
<p>It was times I was so angry.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s that range of emotions,</p>
<p>the anger, the denial, the depression, the this, the that.</p>
<p>And this is the weirdest thing.</p>
<p>It was mostly, I knew my career was over</p>
<p>and they retired me out of the job.</p>
<p>That, I got sick in August and that October,</p>
<p>they told me I was out.</p>
<p>And by the time I was processed and, you know,</p>
<p>used up my leaves and whatever you want to say it was,</p>
<p>I was officially retired in January of 02</p>
<p>and it was less than six months.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m there walking my dog one day,</p>
<p>my rescued Greyhound who I miss.</p>
<p>She was such a soul.</p>
<p>God, she lived to be almost 13, Katie.</p>
<p>And we were walking in the snow and I got the call.</p>
<p>I was retired and I looked at her and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>Katie, what am I going to do?</p>
<p>She just looked up and said, we&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>on a lot more walks, you know?</p>
<p>And I was so sad and I was so sad and I was so angry</p>
<p>because I lost my priesthood.</p>
<p>I loved helping people.</p>
<p>I really, like I would have done it for free.</p>
<p>I would never tell Mayor Bloomberg that, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s all about the buck, right?</p>
<p>But like, you know, honestly,</p>
<p>I would have been a New York City fireman.</p>
<p>I would have paid them to do it, you know?</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t allowed anymore.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You have over 20 years and you have cancer.</p>
<p>You know, back when my dad got sick,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d let you hang around for 10, 12 years in an office,</p>
<p>but not now.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s all about the bottom line.</p>
<p>But I was more depressed about losing a job</p>
<p>than almost losing my life.</p>
<p>Like, as crazy as that sounds, you know?</p>
<p>And it just&hellip;</p>
<p>It was more than a job.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a way of life.</p>
<p>Oh, man, yeah.</p>
<p>It also is your family, your father,</p>
<p>your carrying torture, your father&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, my friend.</p>
<p>I love my friends.</p>
<p>I love, we worked 24 hour shifts together.</p>
<p>You cook, you clean, you break each other&rsquo;s jobs</p>
<p>relentlessly.</p>
<p>I mean, I love those guys so much.</p>
<p>I mean, I hope that my kids</p>
<p>and anyone that I know and care about,</p>
<p>I hope they can experience the bond of that brotherhood</p>
<p>that I experienced in my life.</p>
<p>It was so&hellip;</p>
<p>God, I would give anything to have it back.</p>
<p>Just, yeah.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about New York?</p>
<p>So unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve never lived in New York.</p>
<p>I visit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to live there for a bit.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s a very different experience</p>
<p>to have really lived in New York for many, many years.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a few friends of mine that are from&hellip;</p>
<p>They got similar accent as yours.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That are a little bit saddened.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s temporary, but perhaps not.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seem to think so of what New York has become,</p>
<p>especially with COVID.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s losing some of the spirit of New York.</p>
<p>Do you have that sense?</p>
<p>Do you have a hope for the city</p>
<p>that has been so defining to what is America?</p>
<p>My heart&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>I had moved to New Jersey many years ago,</p>
<p>but I still have a close attachment to New York.</p>
<p>My parents are still there, many, many family members.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve since now moved to Tennessee.</p>
<p>I needed to go somewhere quiet.</p>
<p>I wanted to heal my fractured soul.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in the middle of a beautiful farming rural area</p>
<p>in middle Tennessee.</p>
<p>And so they probably called me a sellout</p>
<p>back in New York for leaving,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the same city and it&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll refrain from the politics and the finger pointing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a mess compared to what it was.</p>
<p>And I did Broadway theater security for many years,</p>
<p>and I started to see it slide</p>
<p>like with stuff that was happening,</p>
<p>like public urination and defecation</p>
<p>and just like tourists don&rsquo;t wanna see that, right?</p>
<p>And I had an unfortunate incident two years ago.</p>
<p>I was jumped by four teenagers coming off the subway</p>
<p>and they were pissed off</p>
<p>because I was wearing an American flag hat.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not really sure why,</p>
<p>but it left me, I got out of it, okay.</p>
<p>But I was taken back.</p>
<p>They were literally videoing it</p>
<p>and the kid was just throwing shadow punches at my face</p>
<p>wanting to beat me up.</p>
<p>And I finally looked him in the eyes and I was like,</p>
<p>oh boy, I&rsquo;m a little too old for this.</p>
<p>Body&rsquo;s a little broken down for chemo.</p>
<p>And I finally just said, all right, all right.</p>
<p>I just had enough, I wanted to go home.</p>
<p>Just worked a 17 hour shift as a stage hand.</p>
<p>And I was so taken back, I was so insulted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, I spent my life protecting this city</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m getting attacked like for nothing.</p>
<p>And I just, I gave up</p>
<p>and maybe I should have given it a little more time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s turned into an angry place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s turned into, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t getting the resources they need in a sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of mental illness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of homelessness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of violent people</p>
<p>just roaming around the streets and it&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not safe.</p>
<p>And tourists are not gonna come back.</p>
<p>Even just leading up to the COVID,</p>
<p>I had some tourists saying to me, I won&rsquo;t be back.</p>
<p>And now I can only imagine</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just gotten exponentially worse,</p>
<p>but I hope there&rsquo;s a chance it&rsquo;ll swing back.</p>
<p>Cause it is, it&rsquo;s the gateway to the world.</p>
<p>I mean, my grandfather came from Denmark.</p>
<p>He landed in Ellis Island in the twenties.</p>
<p>American success story, 25 bucks in his pocket,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t speak the language,</p>
<p>had a sponsor family in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.</p>
<p>And he made it, you know, he ended up dying</p>
<p>owning a bakery at one point and then an apartment building.</p>
<p>And he did pretty well for himself</p>
<p>for an immigrant who was poor.</p>
<p>And my mom, my Irish mother landed in the same neighborhood,</p>
<p>Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 16 years old.</p>
<p>Worked as a cashier 50, 60 hours a week in the supermarket</p>
<p>and finished school at night.</p>
<p>Married my father, the fireman,</p>
<p>and, you know, lived the American dream.</p>
<p>And it was all, it was all from New York.</p>
<p>And my father&rsquo;s mom was from Irish immigrants</p>
<p>and they all landed in Ellis Island.</p>
<p>Well, my mom didn&rsquo;t cause it was closed at that point,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s people breaking down the doors</p>
<p>to come to this country, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one breaking down the doors to leave.</p>
<p>And this is, this is a problem I have</p>
<p>with people that aren&rsquo;t grateful for being here.</p>
<p>And this, again, it&rsquo;s not political,</p>
<p>just straight down the middle fastball.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it here, I&rsquo;ll show you the door.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get you the plane ticket.</p>
<p>I mean, would you want to live back in Russia</p>
<p>compared to here?</p>
<p>Would you, you might because of family ties,</p>
<p>but I mean, if you had no ties to Russia</p>
<p>or would you want to go to China right now</p>
<p>and possibly end up in a labor camp or, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people busting down the doors to get to this place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got its flaws, it&rsquo;s got its blemishes, you know,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a damn great place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best country in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, and some of it, so first of all,</p>
<p>I have hope for New York.</p>
<p>I think that culture is very difficult to kill.</p>
<p>I think it will persevere.</p>
<p>And I think ultimately the same story with New York</p>
<p>as with the rest of the United States,</p>
<p>it has to do with leaders.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always hopeful that great leaders will emerge.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And the kind of leadership we see now</p>
<p>and the kind of conversations we have now,</p>
<p>I think it has to do with the prosperity and comfort.</p>
<p>And in the face of hardship,</p>
<p>I think great leaders will emerge.</p>
<p>And yeah, I just think ultimately</p>
<p>in the long arc of history.</p>
<p>Well, leaders shouldn&rsquo;t become rich.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t become rich in the process, right?</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t go into political office</p>
<p>as an alleged lunchbox kind of guy</p>
<p>and then come out eating at the best steakhouse in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the problem with politics, right?</p>
<p>My Irish grandmother, God rest her, used to say,</p>
<p>oh, those politicians, they&rsquo;re all like dirty diapers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re full of shit and they stink.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a crap what party they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Yeah, greed and power.</p>
<p>We had to beg these guys,</p>
<p>beg them for federal legislation</p>
<p>to cover our medical bills, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gentleman, John Field</p>
<p>from the Feel Good Foundation.</p>
<p>This guy is a lion of a man, a general,</p>
<p>but with a soft, big, great heart.</p>
<p>And John is a former construction worker</p>
<p>who came to the 9.11 site the day after.</p>
<p>He was one of those guys cutting the steel with torches</p>
<p>and craning it out of the air.</p>
<p>One of those hard hats that just,</p>
<p>that never got the credit and the praise</p>
<p>that we did as responders.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean that as a knock to responders, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we lost 37 Port Authority police officers,</p>
<p>23 NYPD officers,</p>
<p>about a dozen emergency medical technicians and paramedics,</p>
<p>three court officers from New York State courts</p>
<p>and two federal agents,</p>
<p>and I hope, and 343 New York City firefighters.</p>
<p>We lost a ton of responders.</p>
<p>But the recovery workers,</p>
<p>thankfully weren&rsquo;t killed in that process,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s hundreds of them now who are dead from illnesses</p>
<p>because they came down to recover our people</p>
<p>and the civilians and the poor lost souls</p>
<p>that were killed at work that day.</p>
<p>And John literally almost lost his foot</p>
<p>in a construction accident at the site.</p>
<p>An 8,000 pound I beam tore off half of his foot,</p>
<p>ended up with massive sepsis, six months in the hospital,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousand dollars in medical bills,</p>
<p>and then no one wanted to pay him.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a guy, he&rsquo;s gonna lose his house,</p>
<p>lose his life, lose everything.</p>
<p>And now the never forget, it started quick, right?</p>
<p>And he went on a mission,</p>
<p>formed his Feel Good Foundation.</p>
<p>His last name is Feel, F E A L, Feel Good Foundation.</p>
<p>And this man literally went to Washington, DC</p>
<p>with his army, as he called it.</p>
<p>And I was honored and blessed to be with him</p>
<p>a couple, only a couple times.</p>
<p>I wish I had dedicated some more time to it.</p>
<p>And what it was with John is he set out on a mission</p>
<p>to get, and initially what he did is he got funding</p>
<p>to take care of responders who were in that limbo,</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t get their medical bills paid,</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t make their mortgages,</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t make their car payments,</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t make their childcare payments.</p>
<p>And John just took it upon his own to get donations</p>
<p>and take care of you while you were suffering, right?</p>
<p>I got a call when I got out of hospital.</p>
<p>You okay?</p>
<p>You need anything?</p>
<p>I said, who is this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s John Feel.</p>
<p>I said, aren&rsquo;t you that constructor?</p>
<p>Yeah, you need anything?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty good right now.</p>
<p>I said, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Phone ring again a few weeks later.</p>
<p>Hey, John Feel, you need anything?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this guy&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s people who needed stuff</p>
<p>and he was getting it done.</p>
<p>And he, with his army, had to chase these politicians</p>
<p>through the halls of Congress</p>
<p>to get funding to cover the medical bills.</p>
<p>I was getting sued for $125,000</p>
<p>for my month stay in the cancer ward.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>I said, well, wait a minute, I have insurance.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, no, no, this is terrorism related.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t cover that.</p>
<p>So usually then workers comp will cover</p>
<p>your on duty injury or illness.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, leukemia is not covered under that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t cover that.</p>
<p>So then the ping pong game starts</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m literally have people showing up,</p>
<p>taking pictures of my kids in front of the house.</p>
<p>And I went and grabbed the guy one day by the collar.</p>
<p>So who the hell are you?</p>
<p>Sir, I&rsquo;m a private investigator.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re putting a lien on this property</p>
<p>due to a nonpayment of a bill.</p>
<p>I said, okay, I understand.</p>
<p>Do your job.</p>
<p>Let me bring my kids inside.</p>
<p>Take all the pictures you want.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t step on my front lawn.</p>
<p>And I went in the house.</p>
<p>I closed my room, my door, my door, my room, and I cried.</p>
<p>I said, I can&rsquo;t believe this.</p>
<p>I spent my entire adult life trying to help people,</p>
<p>give of myself, and I can&rsquo;t even get my medical bill paid.</p>
<p>Well, John Field got my medical bill paid.</p>
<p>He finally got these politicians with his team,</p>
<p>firefighter Ray Pfeiffer, who has since died,</p>
<p>fought with terminal cancer for nine years in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Literally at the end, came out of hospice</p>
<p>to go finalize getting us this coverage.</p>
<p>Detective Luis Alvarez, who testified days before he died</p>
<p>in front of Congress, and a bunch of other guys</p>
<p>that were really, really sick,</p>
<p>and we had to shame these people into signing on.</p>
<p>And luckily we had John Stewart come on</p>
<p>and literally just hound these guys</p>
<p>and shame them and embarrass them.</p>
<p>And what it all stemmed from was in 2006,</p>
<p>the first death that was determined to be linked to 9 11,</p>
<p>there was others,</p>
<p>but the first one that was officially linked</p>
<p>was a New York City police detective who initially,</p>
<p>the city said he died of advanced lung disease.</p>
<p>His lungs were protruding out of his body.</p>
<p>And he was on painkillers and it was so bad at the end</p>
<p>that the doctor said, just grind them up, snort them,</p>
<p>drink it, whatever you need to do to get instant relief.</p>
<p>So when they found the talcum</p>
<p>from the pill lining in his lungs,</p>
<p>they said, oh no, this is opiate abuse.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t die of lung disease.</p>
<p>So they said, and the mayor was quoted as saying,</p>
<p>he is not a hero.</p>
<p>Well, shame on you, Mr. Mayor.</p>
<p>He was a hero.</p>
<p>And his father, who was a retired police chief,</p>
<p>married up with the Feel Good Foundation</p>
<p>and John Stewart and Ray Pfeiffer, Detective Alvarez.</p>
<p>And they got us all covered.</p>
<p>But it took so long.</p>
<p>Like it was so heartbreaking.</p>
<p>These people who were lining up three deep politicians,</p>
<p>three deep to catch a picture with a responder</p>
<p>so they can tweet, hashtag never forget</p>
<p>and hashtag look at me and hey, how am I doing?</p>
<p>All that bull crap.</p>
<p>They were nowhere to be freaking found.</p>
<p>I literally witnessed them hiding in cloak rooms,</p>
<p>running down hallways away from us, those freaking cowards.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cowardice.</p>
<p>Can I just linger on the John Stewart thing,</p>
<p>the comedian, actor, John Stewart,</p>
<p>his testimony before Congress over the benefits</p>
<p>for 9 11 first responders.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of important human beings</p>
<p>in the story, but he has a big voice.</p>
<p>And he spoke from the heart.</p>
<p>What do you make of that testimony?</p>
<p>Oh, it was heartfelt.</p>
<p>I mean, he spoke.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, John was a polarizing guy, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain things like over the years,</p>
<p>he was cutting edge and I might not have agreed</p>
<p>with all of his, you know, some stuff, some not, right?</p>
<p>You know, like we all, but I tell you,</p>
<p>I found him as funny.</p>
<p>I enjoyed his humor.</p>
<p>I would love the two of you to have a conversation.</p>
<p>No, but again, I love a guy where you can have,</p>
<p>you can have a difference in opinions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beautiful thing about the firehouse kitchen.</p>
<p>I mean, it could get raucous and now, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little different situation,</p>
<p>but I mean, back in the day, some funny stuff.</p>
<p>But yeah, John, John literally just took his talents.</p>
<p>You would think he was speaking from the heart</p>
<p>of a fireman or a cop or a soldier or a Marine,</p>
<p>you know, someone who was there.</p>
<p>But I think he especially got to know Ray so well</p>
<p>and Ray had this stack of mask cards from, you know,</p>
<p>the funeral cards they give out.</p>
<p>It looks like, you know, a larger business card</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s laminated.</p>
<p>And Ray had a stack of them he would carry around.</p>
<p>I think it was close to a hundred cards</p>
<p>and John saw it and he said, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>He says, these are my cards.</p>
<p>He said, for what?</p>
<p>He says, for my brother&rsquo;s funerals.</p>
<p>He was like, oh my God, you&rsquo;ve been to that many funerals?</p>
<p>He goes, yeah, this is just the ones I made.</p>
<p>Like, you know, and John, I think was just stunned.</p>
<p>And John actually had that stack of cards</p>
<p>after Ray passed and like said, look, look at these.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be more of these cards.</p>
<p>We have one guy a week or girl,</p>
<p>one responder or a recovery worker</p>
<p>or someone who actually resided down there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more than one a week dying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one a day dying on average.</p>
<p>And on average, two people are diagnosed</p>
<p>with a 9 11 cancer or disease.</p>
<p>Right now, the worst part is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s autoimmune diseases flying off the graph</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not covered under the legislation.</p>
<p>By the grace of God, my cancer is covered.</p>
<p>If my cancer comes back, I mean, I&rsquo;m in remission.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s technically incurable, but I&rsquo;ve been blessed</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m staying ahead of this stuff going on 10 years.</p>
<p>But if it comes back with a vengeance tomorrow and takes me,</p>
<p>at least my wife will get my pension</p>
<p>and be able to live her life without fear.</p>
<p>But my friends who are suffering</p>
<p>from these advanced autoimmunes, their wives get nothing.</p>
<p>Their pension dies with them.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re hoping that John and his army</p>
<p>can shame these politicians once again</p>
<p>to have the kindness and decency to cover these autoimmunes.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re throwing a lot of money around</p>
<p>at a lot of things lately.</p>
<p>And this is one that they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And these are lives in the balance who really need it.</p>
<p>And John had this strong line.</p>
<p>They did their jobs, do yours, talking to the politicians.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a strong wake up call</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not about the Twitter or the social media</p>
<p>or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You have a job to do and you have to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that compassion implemented in the form of money</p>
<p>of helping people that were there for you</p>
<p>when you needed help.</p>
<p>Well, we had a guy, I mean,</p>
<p>I might get audited out of this one, I hope not,</p>
<p>but we had a Congressman from out West,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say where, but he prided himself on saying</p>
<p>he was a retired cop, a busy cop, 22 years.</p>
<p>He said no on the legislation.</p>
<p>I witnessed a cop who was dying get out of his wheelchair</p>
<p>and said, hey brother, I got a half a million dollars</p>
<p>in medical bills and I&rsquo;m a short timer.</p>
<p>I got a few months to live.</p>
<p>Who the F is gonna pay him?</p>
<p>Do the right thing.</p>
<p>You say you&rsquo;re a cop, you show me you&rsquo;re a cop</p>
<p>and you sign that paper.</p>
<p>And the guy started tearing up the Congressman</p>
<p>and he signed it, but he had to be freaking shamed.</p>
<p>And you know what he said?</p>
<p>Well, this doesn&rsquo;t really confront me.</p>
<p>This is pork as far as my district is concerned.</p>
<p>He goes, oh yeah, do you know there&rsquo;s 10 guys</p>
<p>from your district who came across the country</p>
<p>to help us that are also dying?</p>
<p>He had no idea.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the sad part about Alex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a failure in leadership.</p>
<p>I think some people would vote for Mickey Mouse</p>
<p>just because if he ran.</p>
<p>I mean, I have no offense against Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>I like him, he&rsquo;s a good guy, right?</p>
<p>I mean, but like, I mean.</p>
<p>Allegedly.</p>
<p>Allegedly, supposedly.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But seriously, I look at some of the leaderships sometimes</p>
<p>and go, we&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>And also you lose, I think the way government</p>
<p>is structured is people who are senators</p>
<p>or people who are in Congress,</p>
<p>they start playing a game between each other</p>
<p>and they lose track of the connection to the people,</p>
<p>to the basic humanity.</p>
<p>So you forget, even when you think of yourself as a cop,</p>
<p>you forget what are like the cops and the other people</p>
<p>servicing the community actually experiencing</p>
<p>all the troubles they&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>and how they can actually be helped</p>
<p>because you lose touch to that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not actually living,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not talking to them, you&rsquo;re not living among them.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s a natural part of the system,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s why character and great leadership</p>
<p>is important is you say you leave the game of Congress</p>
<p>and you go back to the people.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what the country,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the George Washington ideal</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re not playing a game of power.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ultimately see yourself as somebody who&rsquo;s servicing</p>
<p>this country&rsquo;s service in the community</p>
<p>and that requires talking to the people</p>
<p>in their time of hardship.</p>
<p>Well, you have some people serving</p>
<p>in congressional districts don&rsquo;t even live in that district.</p>
<p>I mean, so how are they gonna empathize?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not even driving through there on a daily basis.</p>
<p>And again, when anything becomes lucrative</p>
<p>from a financial standpoint, it blurs people&rsquo;s vision.</p>
<p>You have to take the potential</p>
<p>of becoming rich out of politics.</p>
<p>Politics is public service.</p>
<p>Police and fire and EMS are public service,</p>
<p>but cops and firemen and medics don&rsquo;t walk out</p>
<p>of their career with gazillion dollar contracts</p>
<p>with this company and that company</p>
<p>on that board of directors and this board of directors.</p>
<p>They walk out with a pension and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And you have to wonder the intentions</p>
<p>of people getting into politics.</p>
<p>Are they truly going into to help the human condition</p>
<p>or are they trying to help their own damn condition</p>
<p>with their wallet and their pocketbook?</p>
<p>And I try to lean toward the latter lately</p>
<p>with what I&rsquo;m seeing out there.</p>
<p>Well, some of them are the good ones</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s our job as a society is to elevate the good ones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it and that has to do with the ideals that we elevate.</p>
<p>There are a number of conspiracy theories</p>
<p>around the events of 9 11.</p>
<p>Do any of these hold true to you</p>
<p>or do they just frustrate you, even anger you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked this by a few different people in my life.</p>
<p>This is my take on it, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a man of science and a man of education.</p>
<p>So you&hellip;</p>
<p>Allegedly.</p>
<p>Allegedly, but yes, but you&rsquo;re a very, very intelligent man.</p>
<p>And what I believe took place is this.</p>
<p>Structural steel will fail</p>
<p>at a sustained temperature of 1500 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know exactly how long</p>
<p>that would have to be sustained, but that&rsquo;s the temp, right?</p>
<p>Diesel fuel, kerosene fuel, kerosene based jet fuel,</p>
<p>which was the ignition there burns</p>
<p>at 2200 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>So that continued burning of that diesel, that jet fuel,</p>
<p>but kerosene based, it&rsquo;s all kind of similar</p>
<p>exceeded the temperature needed for that steel</p>
<p>in the structural members of the trade center to fail.</p>
<p>In my heart of hearts, I would hate to ever think</p>
<p>that somebody affiliated with our government</p>
<p>with some sort of agenda would perpetrate that crime</p>
<p>and that tragic just destruction of humanity and property</p>
<p>for some other form of gain.</p>
<p>Those planes rammed into those buildings</p>
<p>at 450 miles an hour.</p>
<p>They were loaded with thousands and thousands</p>
<p>of gallons of jet fuel.</p>
<p>Number seven trade center had the backup</p>
<p>for the emergency management system for the city.</p>
<p>And it was an emergency generator in that complex</p>
<p>which had a 25,000 gallon tank of diesel fuel</p>
<p>to continually run for weeks to keep the 911 system,</p>
<p>the backup system going in the case of a catastrophic event.</p>
<p>Well, that tank in seven heated up from the fire</p>
<p>that was already going on from the aircraft debris</p>
<p>coming into the building.</p>
<p>So once that diesel became ignited in seven,</p>
<p>now you had enough temperature to fail that steel</p>
<p>in that building.</p>
<p>So I would like to truly believe what I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>from the minimal fire science knowledge I have</p>
<p>from my career, that it was just a matter of,</p>
<p>it burned too long, it burned too hot and it failed.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at the way it came down,</p>
<p>it came down as it was designed to</p>
<p>in the God forbid event that it was to collapse.</p>
<p>It came down pancaking upon itself.</p>
<p>If it had failed horizontally</p>
<p>and just sprayed out side to side,</p>
<p>those buildings would have dropped for a quarter,</p>
<p>half a mile up to Canal Street.</p>
<p>But you know, Lex, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The fire and the destruction that could have resulted.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh my gosh, it could have been so much worse.</p>
<p>I mean, you would have taken out every building</p>
<p>from that point all the way up.</p>
<p>But in my heart, I&rsquo;d like to just believe</p>
<p>that it was just a fire that burned too long and too hot.</p>
<p>These planes cause structural damage upon impact</p>
<p>in both buildings and it was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>And then you think about it, you add all the plastics,</p>
<p>all the carpeting, all of the stuff</p>
<p>that was burning on those floors.</p>
<p>You add that to that fire load.</p>
<p>I think it just had enough to collapse it.</p>
<p>And you were in building seven for part of that day.</p>
<p>I was just after it came down as well.</p>
<p>We were aside it and we weren&rsquo;t in it or next to it</p>
<p>when it actually did come down.</p>
<p>But moments after we were there.</p>
<p>And again, I would like to believe that it just,</p>
<p>it was just that that fuel was going</p>
<p>and it just took its physics, took its course and it failed.</p>
<p>So physics and science aside, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both I would like to believe</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that anybody would be so evil</p>
<p>as to orchestrate parts of this</p>
<p>from within the United States government.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very difficult for me to imagine.</p>
<p>You know what though, Lex, there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t elaborate, I won&rsquo;t get into it.</p>
<p>Any controversial subjects or what have you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some people that don&rsquo;t have any problem at all</p>
<p>perpetrating any level of evil.</p>
<p>People like you and I who have hearts</p>
<p>and we have depth of soul.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t imagine it, but there&rsquo;s other people</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even be a second thought.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen some horrific incidents in my career</p>
<p>that I go home shaking my head at night going,</p>
<p>human beings are just, they&rsquo;re not wired right.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, I look at animals, I love animals,</p>
<p>I love dogs especially, right.</p>
<p>And I see this dog park when I train to fly airplanes now</p>
<p>and something I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a dog park across from the airport</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s 60 dogs and there&rsquo;s bones flying up in the air</p>
<p>and chew toys and sticks and they&rsquo;re running around</p>
<p>having the time of their life, right.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all getting along</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not hurting each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not violating each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not canceling each other.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going, we really need to learn from these dogs.</p>
<p>Like, right.</p>
<p>And like, I just, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes it sounds crazy,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;re a better species than people.</p>
<p>Unless they&rsquo;re rabid, they don&rsquo;t hurt on purpose.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, you know, they don&rsquo;t cut you off in traffic</p>
<p>and throw you the middle finger.</p>
<p>And you know, they just don&rsquo;t do these acts of humanity</p>
<p>that sometimes are so vicious.</p>
<p>Why do you think these conspiracy theories</p>
<p>of which there&rsquo;s a lot take hold?</p>
<p>Why do you think so many people believe</p>
<p>some version of different conspiracy theories around 9 11?</p>
<p>Well, you know, like many things in life,</p>
<p>it leaves me a little conflicted.</p>
<p>I have to say this, I am at the point now,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who to believe anymore.</p>
<p>So I could see that lending a hand to someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s already a doubter going, oh yeah, look,</p>
<p>exactly, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing, right.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, look at this whole virus.</p>
<p>Like, who do you believe?</p>
<p>Like, where&rsquo;d it come from?</p>
<p>You know, like, and you know, if you plant that seed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that little campfire</p>
<p>we were talking about earlier, right?</p>
<p>You just toss a little gas into those embers.</p>
<p>You got a fire now.</p>
<p>I also think there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>with a hell of a lot of extra time on their hands, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really bored.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And the two are combined.</p>
<p>Alex, yeah, man, you know, like, look,</p>
<p>I was a three job Charlie, right?</p>
<p>You know, one guy used to say to me, anything but home.</p>
<p>I go, no, I got deadlines, responsibilities.</p>
<p>You know, like, that&rsquo;s what it comes down to is like,</p>
<p>I mean, look, we all have our hobbies and things we like</p>
<p>and, you know, little nuances.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes us special.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re unique.</p>
<p>Every person is a unique being.</p>
<p>But I also think some people just,</p>
<p>they want to cling to something.</p>
<p>Like, we all want to feel accepted and belong to something.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden you group up with these people</p>
<p>and you all believe this fervently.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, they did it.</p>
<p>They took it down.</p>
<p>And now you start going, yeah.</p>
<p>And I think what happens is when you&rsquo;re in company of people</p>
<p>and you start telling each other the same thing often,</p>
<p>you freaking believe it.</p>
<p>I mean, if you keep telling me I got a gray head of hair,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go, you know what?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, right?</p>
<p>I got that waving bye bye do.</p>
<p>But like, but you know,</p>
<p>I think when you start hearing something often,</p>
<p>you start believing it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to doubt their intelligence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to doubt their intentions,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t see it as being plausible.</p>
<p>I just, I, it would be too,</p>
<p>too big of an operation to successfully happen.</p>
<p>I, you know, I mean, look, there&rsquo;s other things that,</p>
<p>you know, I won&rsquo;t say it on the interview there,</p>
<p>but like I have my doubts with certain things,</p>
<p>you know, that, that.</p>
<p>I mean, conspiracy theories take hold for a reason.</p>
<p>Cause some of them are true.</p>
<p>No, yeah.</p>
<p>The hard thing is just to know which ones is the problem.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t have facts, right?</p>
<p>Or you don&rsquo;t know who to trust.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you don&rsquo;t have facts,</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have figures and you don&rsquo;t have science,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to take someone&rsquo;s word on it.</p>
<p>You know, I had a conversation</p>
<p>with someone a while back, right?</p>
<p>And the guy&rsquo;s like, just, just dedicated atheist.</p>
<p>And he thinks I&rsquo;m an idiot for believing in God.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yo, you&rsquo;re one of those jerks</p>
<p>who believes in creation.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I do.</p>
<p>Well, what about the big bang theory?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going on his diatribe about the science</p>
<p>and the gases and the chemistry.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going, dude,</p>
<p>I barely got through high school chemistry, slow down.</p>
<p>And he went on a tangent and all of a sudden I stopped.</p>
<p>I went, who, who created the gas and the molecules</p>
<p>and the stuff you&rsquo;re talking about and the collisions?</p>
<p>And he was furious and stoned off.</p>
<p>And I got him.</p>
<p>And again, I had no facts.</p>
<p>I had no figure.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t either, but I stumped him.</p>
<p>But sometimes when you can&rsquo;t show something,</p>
<p>people need to see something tangible.</p>
<p>They need to see it in their hand to believe it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the real hard thing about faith.</p>
<p>I see it in action.</p>
<p>People restore my faith.</p>
<p>And then I say to myself, well,</p>
<p>there can&rsquo;t be that many dummies in this world</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s so many billions of us believing</p>
<p>in this higher power, this higher, right?</p>
<p>I mean, and you said, you said earlier,</p>
<p>like you believe most people are good and I do too.</p>
<p>The bad outshine the good because the bad get the press.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>If it bleeds, it leads.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, you know, like, think about it.</p>
<p>How many more damn zombie apocalypse movies can we make?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know there was that many zombies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it just seems like every other show</p>
<p>is just guys like, you know,</p>
<p>bashing each other&rsquo;s heads in with bats with nails in it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, after a while, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>all right, gosh, you gotta get a new boogeyman here.</p>
<p>You know, right?</p>
<p>Like, but seriously, like.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, human civilization</p>
<p>is getting better and better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just like making Hollywood movies.</p>
<p>They just.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re getting better and better,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re treating each other worse and worse.</p>
<p>You would think with all this technology</p>
<p>and all the knowledge and all the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, what the hell is going on sometimes?</p>
<p>Like, I really want to see the good.</p>
<p>And I think maybe, maybe the level of bad</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re seeing was always existent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just now everything is instantaneous news</p>
<p>and flashes and tweets and this and this.</p>
<p>Like, like, you know.</p>
<p>Well, with the technology we have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also come to the light.</p>
<p>So you get to see all these fights.</p>
<p>It almost, I think that&rsquo;s step one</p>
<p>of dealing with the problem is revealing it</p>
<p>in its full beautiful light.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>How much of a bickering species we are.</p>
<p>50 years ago, a guy like me who loves to talk,</p>
<p>how the hell would I have gotten an opportunity</p>
<p>to have someone listen to me and have, right?</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>This is amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>But like, but you didn&rsquo;t have that arena.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have all these things.</p>
<p>My grandfather, Nels, God rest him, he died in 1979.</p>
<p>I mean, that dude didn&rsquo;t even want to have</p>
<p>a checking account.</p>
<p>He would walk to each store, each, the phone company,</p>
<p>the gas company, this company, and pay the bill in person.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t trust the bank.</p>
<p>And it was like, now, ATMs, this, that,</p>
<p>he would be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be just like, I mean, I love my dad,</p>
<p>but to watch him on his iPad is comical, right?</p>
<p>He calls my niece&rsquo;s boyfriend, who&rsquo;s a tech guy,</p>
<p>Matt, Matt, if you listen, he&rsquo;s the greatest.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll have this poor guy on the phone for like hours.</p>
<p>Like the second you&rsquo;ll walk in to see my father, my kids,</p>
<p>hey, do me a favor, you fucking straighten out this pad.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s comical because I&rsquo;m looking at my dad</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going, he was born when Hitler started World War II.</p>
<p>Yeah, wow.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going, he&rsquo;s seen all of that.</p>
<p>Oh, my wife&rsquo;s grandmother was born in 1900 in Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>and she died in 1998.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going, holy, the stuff she saw in the span of her life,</p>
<p>just, it&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>But what troubles me sometimes is with all of these advances</p>
<p>and all these devices, this is what I say to my kids,</p>
<p>look up from the phone and look up, right?</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t talk anymore.</p>
<p>I saw a girl literally, and I shouldn&rsquo;t say girl, guy,</p>
<p>whatever, I saw a person literally just about walking</p>
<p>to an open manhole cover texting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going, that&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>because your awareness is gone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve been at restaurants, groups of people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re texting, they&rsquo;re texting each other</p>
<p>just sitting on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, put the freaking thing down</p>
<p>and have a conversation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing, we&rsquo;ve lost the art of conversation.</p>
<p>You know, like, my wife runs, she has this running joke.</p>
<p>She goes, there&rsquo;s a lot going on up there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, because I really, I&rsquo;m inquisitive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about life.</p>
<p>I love to meet people.</p>
<p>I love to learn.</p>
<p>I love, and the only way you can do that</p>
<p>is to have a conversation.</p>
<p>The hilarious thing about this,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re obviously very charismatic.</p>
<p>You got great stories.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a great human being.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking to a guy who spent most of his life</p>
<p>behind a computer hiding from people.</p>
<p>No, no, and I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re like trying to bridge this.</p>
<p>Right, but I don&rsquo;t mean that as a rip,</p>
<p>but you, I would never know that.</p>
<p>I would never know that because you&rsquo;re very engaging.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very, like, I would not know,</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t have any impediments</p>
<p>to your social skills, your personal, and that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and again, I don&rsquo;t mean it as a knock to you</p>
<p>and these young people.</p>
<p>Well, no, but this is me trying to look up</p>
<p>from a smartphone is having these conversations,</p>
<p>talking to people.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I mean, some of it could be, it&rsquo;s always hard to know.</p>
<p>Some of it could be just you and I being old school,</p>
<p>because you grew up before the internet.</p>
<p>Maybe there is joy and deep human connection</p>
<p>to be discovered inside the smartphone.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t seem that way,</p>
<p>because the smartphone&rsquo;s so new,</p>
<p>maybe we just haven&rsquo;t figured out those things,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a globalizing aspect.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a opportunity for you to connect with people</p>
<p>from across the world in ways that.</p>
<p>I have cousins in Ireland and England.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I get a FaceTime or a WhatsApp and it&rsquo;s like, holy crap,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, you know, three, 4,000 miles away</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m having a conversation now.</p>
<p>I used to send my grandma in Ireland a letter.</p>
<p>I adored her.</p>
<p>She passed when I was 10.</p>
<p>And, no, I&rsquo;m sorry, I was 11.</p>
<p>And I sent her a letter, airmailed,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d wait and I&rsquo;d wait, and about two weeks later,</p>
<p>this airmail letter would come back</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d call me Master Nils William Jorgensen.</p>
<p>I would be so excited, open that bad letter.</p>
<p>Handwritten, just like. Yeah, and like,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d write her another one</p>
<p>and I just couldn&rsquo;t wait for letters from granny.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s like, you know, that&rsquo;s kind of faded away.</p>
<p>Yeah, I still write letters, by the way, handwritten.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>The way this all came about was I wrote a letter</p>
<p>to someone to say thank you for cancer research.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blessed to be alive.</p>
<p>My cancer, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good starting point for any story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blessed to be alive.</p>
<p>And my cancer was one that if I got it 15 years prior</p>
<p>to 19, excuse me, 2011, I was a dead man, right?</p>
<p>15, 20 years before there was no drug to treat.</p>
<p>I was gone, going home to see him.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this wonderful gentleman</p>
<p>that donated hundreds of millions of dollars</p>
<p>to cancer research, Mr. David Koch.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s since, God rest his soul, passed away.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a controversial guy, big time business titan.</p>
<p>And, you know, there was,</p>
<p>the press was just brutalizing him one day</p>
<p>over something to do with his politics.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a union guy, proudly served in unions,</p>
<p>still in a union, you know?</p>
<p>And he was not, you know,</p>
<p>most business guys don&rsquo;t like unions, right?</p>
<p>But, you know, most guys like me don&rsquo;t like working</p>
<p>for $3 an hour, so we like our unions, right?</p>
<p>And I reached out across the table, so to speak,</p>
<p>and I sent him a handwritten letter to thank him,</p>
<p>to say, we may not agree on everything,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t thank you enough.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just this regular dude out there</p>
<p>who is now living his life, watching his kids grow.</p>
<p>Thanks to generous people like you</p>
<p>who believe enough in cancer research, you&rsquo;ve saved my life.</p>
<p>Maybe, I can&rsquo;t say his exact dollars, but people like him.</p>
<p>And he reached back out and his secretary said,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;d like to talk to you on the phone.</p>
<p>I go, well, he&rsquo;s kind of a busy guy,</p>
<p>he wants to talk to me, he&rsquo;s a billionaire.</p>
<p>And he got on the phone,</p>
<p>he was like the greatest guy in the world.</p>
<p>Invited me up to Sloan Kettering</p>
<p>to dedicate a new cancer wing.</p>
<p>It was like I was hanging out with my dad.</p>
<p>And the sweetest man, just so kind, so empathy,</p>
<p>because he was a cancer survivor.</p>
<p>But now he&rsquo;s got the means to help people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve suffered his fate to a better place.</p>
<p>And he was so real and it was so beautiful</p>
<p>just to get to know, say, hey, you know what?</p>
<p>This guy is a big time guy,</p>
<p>but yeah, he&rsquo;s just a regular human like you and I.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a guy who went to night college and I went to the army</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a blue collar kind of dude.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s this guy who went to MIT, like you,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a wildly successful billionaire, a genius.</p>
<p>But yet he can sit down and mix it up with me</p>
<p>and know that I was truly grateful.</p>
<p>And that to me was just like one of the coolest</p>
<p>little relationships I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like we were hanging out,</p>
<p>having barbecues together, but like, you know,</p>
<p>it was just, I was so touched by his decency.</p>
<p>Well, the basics of the, like cancer reveals, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like fundamental to the human experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trauma, it&rsquo;s tragedy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like money, who gives a shit about money?</p>
<p>Education, all of that is like weird new inventions.</p>
<p>You know, life is short.</p>
<p>You suffer with the various diseases.</p>
<p>And that is a reminder that life is short</p>
<p>and a reminder of the basic human connection.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you can bridge that gap.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>All sparked by a handwritten letter,</p>
<p>which just makes for a hell of a story.</p>
<p>And you know what, Lex?</p>
<p>This is the commonality between us.</p>
<p>A guy with three jobs to a billionaire.</p>
<p>We both had that sense of a sledgehammer to the chest.</p>
<p>Boom, you have cancer and you can&rsquo;t breathe</p>
<p>for like 30 seconds.</p>
<p>And then when your heart&rsquo;s just about to kick off</p>
<p>and you take a breath and you go, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;d you say, doc?</p>
<p>You have cancer.</p>
<p>And it don&rsquo;t matter what kind.</p>
<p>One of my best buddies, Bobby&rsquo;s going through right now,</p>
<p>a prostate, and I got way too many of my buddies</p>
<p>with cancer, right?</p>
<p>My buddy, Hugh, who became a vet since his first cancer,</p>
<p>he was a fireman, he&rsquo;s now a veterinarian, right?</p>
<p>He diagnosed me actually over the phone, by the way.</p>
<p>When they couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was wrong with me.</p>
<p>Well, Dr. Hugh, he nailed it to the T.</p>
<p>And we talk.</p>
<p>And the same thing that the dozen of my close friends</p>
<p>that have cancer, the same thing we say is the fear.</p>
<p>So Mr. Koch and I, we shared that same sledgehammer</p>
<p>to the chest and that same fear.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t matter how much money he had</p>
<p>and how much I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s just like the morning of the trade center.</p>
<p>There was big time brokers who went to their demise, right?</p>
<p>Working in these firms, God rest them.</p>
<p>And there was dishwashers, excuse me,</p>
<p>dishwashers up on the windows on the world restaurant</p>
<p>on the 107th floor, making five bucks an hour.</p>
<p>And they died together, it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter if you had an armored car</p>
<p>loaded with bills, you were done that day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think where people need</p>
<p>to humanize each other.</p>
<p>Just because you drive around in a nice car</p>
<p>and you got your own jet and you got this and you got that,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t mean nothing.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re going, when you&rsquo;re in that vulnerable spot,</p>
<p>you could have more money than the US reserves.</p>
<p>Federal reserve, or you could have a welfare check.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>I learned that in a cancer ward.</p>
<p>I had people in my ward that died on me.</p>
<p>I was going around as a little bit of an ambassador</p>
<p>because I was trying to, I was putting on a fake,</p>
<p>I was putting on a fake like I got this, I got this.</p>
<p>I was so scared.</p>
<p>But when I got past that seven days of torture</p>
<p>and the days leading up to it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go around and try to comfort the other cancer patients.</p>
<p>I had this one older African American gentleman,</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t talk because he had</p>
<p>such advanced throat cancer.</p>
<p>He was my roommate for a little while,</p>
<p>but then he got worse so they had to put him by himself.</p>
<p>And you couldn&rsquo;t understand what he was saying</p>
<p>because his throat was just so radiated from the radiation.</p>
<p>But if you put your ear down to him,</p>
<p>you could make out what he was saying.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not faulting the nurses</p>
<p>for maybe not wanting to do that, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re busy, they got a ton going on,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t spend, you know.</p>
<p>So if he was in need, I&rsquo;d put my ear down</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d find out and I&rsquo;d go get it for him.</p>
<p>So when they moved me down the hall,</p>
<p>they asked me to come down with my IV tower.</p>
<p>He needed me.</p>
<p>And I knew it was bad because he just, his look was gone.</p>
<p>And I said, sir, what do you need?</p>
<p>And he whispered, call my sister, I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>He had only one survivor in his whole life.</p>
<p>And she was in North Carolina and he wanted her to know</p>
<p>she couldn&rsquo;t get up, she was elderly.</p>
<p>And I got the nurse and I got on the phone</p>
<p>and I called his sister and I said, ma&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I explained who I was.</p>
<p>And I said, he can&rsquo;t really talk.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t really verbalize too well right now,</p>
<p>but he wants to say he loves you.</p>
<p>And I put the phone down and he told her he loved her</p>
<p>and he said, I&rsquo;m going home.</p>
<p>And that was it.</p>
<p>And I hung the phone up and I said, ma&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>I said, you know, they&rsquo;ll notify you.</p>
<p>And I stayed with him for a while holding his hand</p>
<p>and then, you know, they wanted him to rest.</p>
<p>And then I left and then I got the tap an hour later</p>
<p>and they said, I&rsquo;m sorry, he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And then there was another girl and she was a young girl</p>
<p>from one of the areas I work, young African American girl</p>
<p>where I used to respond and I didn&rsquo;t know her,</p>
<p>but I knew her neighborhood.</p>
<p>And she had what I had, but they weren&rsquo;t sure which one.</p>
<p>You know, leukemias, they&rsquo;re an elusive beast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 49 of them, right?</p>
<p>And each one of them is like,</p>
<p>they got their own little nuances,</p>
<p>own specific treatments.</p>
<p>So if they don&rsquo;t know what you have,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what to do for you.</p>
<p>And she refused to let him drill into her hip</p>
<p>to take the marrow because it&rsquo;s vicious.</p>
<p>It hurts so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like someone born into your hip with a wood drill</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s no joke.</p>
<p>And they asked me to try to convince her</p>
<p>to let them do that or she was gonna die.</p>
<p>Cause if they couldn&rsquo;t figure it out, it was advancing quickly.</p>
<p>She was, so I talked to her and she said,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m too scared.</p>
<p>I said, but are you more scared to die?</p>
<p>And she said, I am.</p>
<p>I said, okay, I&rsquo;ll stay with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hold your hand.</p>
<p>You squeeze it as hard as you want.</p>
<p>I said, if you want, they&rsquo;ll give you like a towel</p>
<p>or something to bite on, whatever.</p>
<p>I said, but you get that pain out,</p>
<p>but you need to do this so you can get saved.</p>
<p>And she said, okay.</p>
<p>And they came in and they, this huge thick needle,</p>
<p>they just bore it into you.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s screaming for her life</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s squeezing my fingers so hard and so hard.</p>
<p>And I said, that&rsquo;s okay, hon.</p>
<p>You keep going, you keep going.</p>
<p>We got it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just 10 more seconds, 10 more seconds.</p>
<p>They got it.</p>
<p>They figured out her treatment</p>
<p>and they got her onto her road to recovery.</p>
<p>And then I spent a long time asking God, why do I have cancer?</p>
<p>Then I stopped and I went, wait a minute.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t die that day with my friends.</p>
<p>Shame on me for asking them why I have cancer.</p>
<p>I had 10 years after 9 11 with such great ears.</p>
<p>And I got to watch my little girl being born</p>
<p>when John never got to see his son.</p>
<p>So it was all gravy after that.</p>
<p>And I said, but now I know why I have my cancer</p>
<p>because I can empathize with people who have it.</p>
<p>And I can try to be their voice when they can&rsquo;t talk,</p>
<p>be their shield to try to take that pain</p>
<p>because I can understand, I can walk their walk.</p>
<p>And now I thank God for my cancer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s made me a better human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made me, I&rsquo;m not gonna lie,</p>
<p>it brought a lot of anger for a while</p>
<p>and my family suffered it,</p>
<p>but I really tried to go past that and heal</p>
<p>and part of living out in the country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very healing for the mind and the soul.</p>
<p>But I now thank God for the cancer</p>
<p>because it humbled me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really need humbling.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t an arrogant puffed up type of person at all,</p>
<p>but maybe I was running away at myself a little bit</p>
<p>and working on a TV show, I&rsquo;m fine, man.</p>
<p>30 at the time, well, I was 42, I got sick.</p>
<p>Life was cruising, man, it was great.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden it was like a blow out</p>
<p>on the highway in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and you were just veering off towards the guardrail.</p>
<p>Yeah, you remembered, you&rsquo;re reminded that you&rsquo;re mortal</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s ultimately a connection to all the rest of us.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s a good thing though,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the problem, I think.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people running around</p>
<p>and thinking they&rsquo;re immortal, right?</p>
<p>You know, when you look at it, Lex, right?</p>
<p>You look at the heartache in a lot of segments of people</p>
<p>and anytime like someone that&rsquo;s got fame and wealth</p>
<p>and success and they die tragically,</p>
<p>a lot of times it&rsquo;s from a substance abuse</p>
<p>or just some horrible death.</p>
<p>And I used to say to myself,</p>
<p>how the hell would someone with that much money</p>
<p>and that much fame and this freaking mansion</p>
<p>and I love cars, my son and I are just big car heads,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m like, you know, this guy&rsquo;s got a collection</p>
<p>of cars and he overdosed because he was sad.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going, how the frig are you sad?</p>
<p>But then I stop and I go, okay,</p>
<p>because maybe he doesn&rsquo;t have any idea who loves him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a lot of people clinging onto him</p>
<p>because of his success.</p>
<p>And he just, he can&rsquo;t fill that void, you know?</p>
<p>And then they fill the void with something destructive.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not bashing people that have substance abuse</p>
<p>problems or alcohol problems, I don&rsquo;t mean it that way.</p>
<p>But what I mean is it&rsquo;s just sad that their level</p>
<p>of despair is so high, on the surface,</p>
<p>they look like they just got everything going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all great, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still human, still got to deal with the same.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, because they want love, right?</p>
<p>They want love and they can&rsquo;t really find it.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, that&rsquo;s true for all of us.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re deeply lonely and looking for love</p>
<p>and when we find it, that&rsquo;s what friendship is.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s true for whether you&rsquo;re super rich</p>
<p>or super poor, it&rsquo;s all the same journey.</p>
<p>My dad said all the time, kid, you&rsquo;re gonna end up</p>
<p>working with hundreds of guys and you&rsquo;ll love a lot of them</p>
<p>but he says when it&rsquo;s all said and done</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re all like me and if you&rsquo;ve still got</p>
<p>two or three of them that you talk to and you&rsquo;ll love.</p>
<p>And I tell you what, I mean, I have thanked the Lord</p>
<p>more than two or three of them and I have my six,</p>
<p>I call it my six, it&rsquo;s the six guys that are gonna</p>
<p>carry my coffin when I&rsquo;m gone, right?</p>
<p>Because I know this cancer&rsquo;s gonna come back, I know it.</p>
<p>Like we get multiples, right?</p>
<p>My friend Yvette just got his second.</p>
<p>My friend Mike&rsquo;s had five of them.</p>
<p>My other Mike has two of them, yeah.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t ready to accept it in 2011.</p>
<p>There was so much more to do and it was so much,</p>
<p>I was so scared, I&rsquo;m like wow, who&rsquo;s gonna take care</p>
<p>of my kids and who, you know, they were little.</p>
<p>Nine, 11 and 14, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what the hell, I have two girls and a boy</p>
<p>in between and they&rsquo;re beautiful kids.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re such good, good children, adults now.</p>
<p>I mean, but you know, my wife&rsquo;s a drill sergeant,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s tough, she don&rsquo;t mess, you know, she&rsquo;s this big.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the softy in the family, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it&rsquo;s funny because my son said to me,</p>
<p>my son&rsquo;s 21 now, he&rsquo;s a good kid, you know.</p>
<p>And he says to me, back when he was like 12,</p>
<p>he goes, dad, I don&rsquo;t want you to be offended</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m really scared of mom,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really that scared of you.</p>
<p>And you know, like I cracked up because it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gotta stand on like a milk crate to reach him</p>
<p>because you know, she&rsquo;s tiny and he&rsquo;s tall,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s true, but you know, but she was hard but fair,</p>
<p>but loved, that&rsquo;s, see, this is the thing,</p>
<p>you take any child anywhere from any background,</p>
<p>if you love them, you nurture them,</p>
<p>you teach them and you guide them,</p>
<p>you have a successful adult.</p>
<p>And see, that&rsquo;s the problem in our society,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not judgmental, I&rsquo;m not judging anyone,</p>
<p>but we need to try harder as parents</p>
<p>as siblings, as friends,</p>
<p>but especially when we&rsquo;re blessed with a child,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you gotta put that child first,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like being a military personal responder,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about you anymore, now it&rsquo;s the team.</p>
<p>So that little child is now the team</p>
<p>and you know, your wife or your significant other,</p>
<p>you know, like it&rsquo;s not about you anymore.</p>
<p>And see, that&rsquo;s the problem is people have a hard time</p>
<p>not making it about them, you know,</p>
<p>like now it&rsquo;s really weird, my kids are 19, 21 and 24</p>
<p>and they hardly wanna hang with me</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re busy in their life, we love each other,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably tired of hearing me go on</p>
<p>and you know, preach and whatever,</p>
<p>but like, but they&rsquo;re adults,</p>
<p>we did pretty much the crux of what we had to do</p>
<p>to put them into adulthood.</p>
<p>And I look back and I go, wow,</p>
<p>I wish I didn&rsquo;t work so much and I wish,</p>
<p>but then I say, no, but it was okay,</p>
<p>my wife stayed home, good lessons, good, you know,</p>
<p>just like.</p>
<p>But ultimately, like you said, it&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s the common,</p>
<p>love is the most important ingredient on this earth</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the problem what&rsquo;s going on right now,</p>
<p>like take politics out of it, right?</p>
<p>Take polarizing each other against each other,</p>
<p>take all that crap out of it</p>
<p>and just airdrop a bunch of love, right?</p>
<p>Like when I worked on Rescuing Me, right?</p>
<p>I love those people so much, they were such great,</p>
<p>we had such a great crew and they worked so hard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a celebrity.</p>
<p>No, no, no, not at all.</p>
<p>If I was, it didn&rsquo;t really work out so good.</p>
<p>I went on to be in the stagehand,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m not pretty, but they don&rsquo;t want old guys</p>
<p>waving bye bye hairdos, but it was funny,</p>
<p>the crew, we became really tight,</p>
<p>we had like, shoot, like 80, 90 people on a set, right?</p>
<p>And you know, the first few episodes,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s trying to feel each other out</p>
<p>because you know, you work with different crews,</p>
<p>different people and this is going back,</p>
<p>starting in 2004, so it was a different time</p>
<p>and I love to hug people</p>
<p>because to me, a hug is a true expression</p>
<p>of love and caring.</p>
<p>You may not know a person a long time,</p>
<p>but you say, I care about you with a hug.</p>
<p>Can I add just a tiny tangent?</p>
<p>This was in the midst of COVID when I was in Boston</p>
<p>and it was, you know, masks, like triple masks, nobody.</p>
<p>And when I went to see Joe here</p>
<p>when he was trying to convince me to move to Austin,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan, and then the first time I see him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, ah, you motherfucking big ass hug.</p>
<p>And it felt so good.</p>
<p>But people probably looked horrified.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hugging.</p>
<p>It was just him.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, I know what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>but if you do it in public now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you committed.</p>
<p>But that expression, because I was so,</p>
<p>you forget how powerful that is.</p>
<p>Oh, I got some of my buddies.</p>
<p>I give them a huge hug and a big sloppy kiss on their cheek</p>
<p>and I, cause I love them.</p>
<p>They, these are my brothers, you know?</p>
<p>But on this set, I swear to God, it got to the point</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not trying to whatever,</p>
<p>but there was people that would come up to me</p>
<p>for the daily hug.</p>
<p>And I said, what are you doing?</p>
<p>And they said, come on, bring it in.</p>
<p>And I give them the hug and they said, you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>It just makes me feel so good.</p>
<p>It makes me feel like you give a crap about me.</p>
<p>I said, I really do.</p>
<p>I said, but it touched my heart</p>
<p>that people were seeking me out</p>
<p>to get that hug to start the day.</p>
<p>And I remember there was a guy in Manhattan,</p>
<p>he was selling hugs for like 50 cents</p>
<p>and I think he got arrested, right?</p>
<p>It was just before COVID.</p>
<p>But like, I wouldn&rsquo;t sell them if, but now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given them away for free.</p>
<p>Well, now I got leukemia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be kind of concerned to get into COVID.</p>
<p>I mean, but like, I really think we need that.</p>
<p>We need hugging booths, like in each city or each town.</p>
<p>Like, because there&rsquo;s so many people</p>
<p>that just want to know someone gives a shit about them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, like, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I love about small little towns</p>
<p>like where I am now in Tennessee.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not knocking New York.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not knocking big towns,</p>
<p>but I guess it&rsquo;s easier to do in a smaller area</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just not this mass of humanity.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll stop and check on you.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re out in the road and you know,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m cutting and cleaning or whatever.</p>
<p>Occasionally I&rsquo;ll roll a lawnmower or a tractor</p>
<p>into a ditch cause I&rsquo;m not a farmer, too good.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s easier to drive a fire truck in New York.</p>
<p>But they literally, oh, I was worried.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, no, I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p>But they literally like check on you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re worried about you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going, these people hardly know me,</p>
<p>but yet they&rsquo;re so caring.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Like this is what I love about my life.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time as, especially as a young boy</p>
<p>and a lot of time in Ireland at my grandma&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<p>And my mom comes from this tiny, tiny little village.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s out in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>And the childhood home she grew up in still,</p>
<p>my aunt and uncle live in it still.</p>
<p>I just love it there so much.</p>
<p>Cause everyone waves.</p>
<p>Tennessee&rsquo;s similar.</p>
<p>They wave, driving by and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>who the hell&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I just wave, you know.</p>
<p>But my cousin will point it out.</p>
<p>Actually third cousin, second removed by, you know, Johnny.</p>
<p>Like, holy shoot, I&rsquo;m related to everyone here, right?</p>
<p>But like everyone stops to say hello and how are you?</p>
<p>And I have a problem doing that because my wife goes,</p>
<p>people think you&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>Why are you talking to everybody?</p>
<p>I said, like, I&rsquo;ll literally stop someone and say,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s your day going?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I&rsquo;ll randomly on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Then it looks a little nuts.</p>
<p>But like, if I&rsquo;m buying a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Oh, that happens here in Austin all the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love it here on the sidewalk randomly.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s just so nice.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say hi to me.</p>
<p>I thought they recognized me or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit who you are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just being nice.</p>
<p>I was on the road coming back,</p>
<p>driving from my family up north down to Tennessee last week.</p>
<p>I stopped in a bathroom and it was closed.</p>
<p>The girl was cleaning it, whatever.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s working so hard, whatever.</p>
<p>And she goes, sir, she goes,</p>
<p>if you go down the hall, there&rsquo;s a family restroom.</p>
<p>Feel free to use it.</p>
<p>You know, she didn&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>And I went down and I&rsquo;m old.</p>
<p>You need a bathroom, you need a bathroom, right?</p>
<p>And I walked back out and I said, ma&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I said, I want to thank you for being here today.</p>
<p>I says, the bathroom was immaculate.</p>
<p>It was, it was like my army bathroom in the barracks.</p>
<p>It was spotless, right?</p>
<p>And I gave her $10.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;d really like you to buy lunch with me today.</p>
<p>I said, you really didn&rsquo;t have to do me that favor.</p>
<p>And she goes, no, sir.</p>
<p>I said, no, no.</p>
<p>I said, I want.</p>
<p>And it was like I gave her a million bucks.</p>
<p>And I say to my wife now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been praying to be a billionaire.</p>
<p>She goes, that&rsquo;s a sin.</p>
<p>I said, no, no, you don&rsquo;t understand, right?</p>
<p>She goes, oh, you&rsquo;re Mr., you know, Mr. God.</p>
<p>I said, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I said, you&rsquo;re getting it wrong.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m praying to be like a multi gazillionaire</p>
<p>because I want to give it all away.</p>
<p>We used to have a sign in ladder 114</p>
<p>until some other rival truck company stole it, right?</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>You know, they get sent to cover your district</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re at a fire and now your stuff&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>And the old timers had a sign that says, I am content.</p>
<p>Because if you got to ladder 114,</p>
<p>that was considered such a great place,</p>
<p>such a great assignment, such great guys.</p>
<p>You had to be vetted to get there.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t just randomly go.</p>
<p>And it was a little exclusionary, but they wanted good guys.</p>
<p>And I said to myself, that&rsquo;s who I am in life right now.</p>
<p>I am content, but I&rsquo;m restless</p>
<p>because I want to really do a lot more good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this podcast.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that it&rsquo;s not forgotten.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure that these charities</p>
<p>that are really, really helping people get recognized.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to take it a step further, right?</p>
<p>A friend of mine runs this foundation</p>
<p>for young folks suffering mental illness and in crisis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for someone that we love dearly.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s on a mission now to get therapy dogs</p>
<p>for really, really mentally wounded warriors, right?</p>
<p>A lot of these young soldiers are having a really hard time.</p>
<p>And now they could be out a while.</p>
<p>They may have come back in country two, three years ago.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s just starting to set in.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a waiting list for thousands of therapy dogs.</p>
<p>And he said that they can&rsquo;t get enough of them quick enough.</p>
<p>But he said, when you see the response,</p>
<p>the way these veterans just light up</p>
<p>when they get these dogs,</p>
<p>it just changes their life radically, immediately.</p>
<p>And I said, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>God, I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to do it,</p>
<p>but I want to be a gazillionaire.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want any picture, photo ops, this, that.</p>
<p>I just want to go, there&rsquo;s a dog, there&rsquo;s a dog,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dog, there&rsquo;s a dog.</p>
<p>And then I want to build veterans land</p>
<p>for these vets who just need a nice clean place to live.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we take these old army bases</p>
<p>and Marine bases and Navy bases that have been shut down.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just sitting there rotting away.</p>
<p>I was in the army in Alabama.</p>
<p>My old Fort McClellan is three quarters vacant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sitting there.</p>
<p>They just did a documentary on it.</p>
<p>It just looks like zombie land going back to zombies.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we take that and renovate it</p>
<p>and say to vets who are struggling,</p>
<p>hey guys, you&rsquo;re going to live here.</p>
<p>And they take the old army,</p>
<p>the places where they had all the supplies,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s massive buildings where you could just retrofit it</p>
<p>and make light manufacturing within two weeks.</p>
<p>Give these guys jobs.</p>
<p>There they live, there they work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll take care of it.</p>
<p>Military guys, they teach you how to take care of stuff.</p>
<p>How the hell in this country should any vet</p>
<p>come back home and be homeless?</p>
<p>Because now they have to dedicate their lives</p>
<p>for six, seven, 10, 12 years,</p>
<p>five, six deployments making $7.50 an hour.</p>
<p>And then they spend seven years</p>
<p>or they get a whopping $16 an hour.</p>
<p>They walk out making 35 grand.</p>
<p>And now no one gives them a job.</p>
<p>No one gives them a chance.</p>
<p>So very quickly they end up homeless</p>
<p>by no fault of their own.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how that&rsquo;s even possible.</p>
<p>The people in this country who&rsquo;ve given the very most</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re struggling, they&rsquo;re hurting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>And my whole thing is if I can have this dream</p>
<p>of succeeding, so to speak, I want to try to change it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m praying to be a billionaire.</p>
<p>My Irish mother probably wouldn&rsquo;t agree either</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not supposed to, right?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m the same with you.</p>
<p>The more money you have, the more you&rsquo;re able to help.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can put smiles on people&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>I have to ask you, the US invaded Afghanistan</p>
<p>in October, 2001 in response to terror attacks.</p>
<p>Now 20 years later, we still had a presence</p>
<p>and abruptly withdrew all troops.</p>
<p>What do you think about this war across the world</p>
<p>that was sparked by this tragedy?</p>
<p>Whenever you do something quickly without thinking it out,</p>
<p>thinking it through and planning, it doesn&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>I understand that we needed to exit.</p>
<p>I mean, how long were you gonna stay over there?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve lost over 7,000 of our young souls over there.</p>
<p>For sometimes people, I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re grateful</p>
<p>for it or not, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the other element, and sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>One is the financial of $6 trillion</p>
<p>and that money is not just money, it&rsquo;s education,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everything, it&rsquo;s money that could have gone towards,</p>
<p>first of all, the first responders,</p>
<p>but all the servicemen and women of all kinds</p>
<p>throughout this country.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the other side,</p>
<p>which is the over 800,000 people who died</p>
<p>in direct result of this conflict.</p>
<p>So not just the American side of the troops,</p>
<p>but just people who died, those humans.</p>
<p>And those humans, many of them civilians,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s spreading hate, especially if you have leaders</p>
<p>on the other side who frame the death of those civilians</p>
<p>in certain ways that just spreads hate throughout the world.</p>
<p>And so you think about this kind of 20 year saga</p>
<p>and think, what are the ways that money could be spent better</p>
<p>and what was the way that we could have spread more love</p>
<p>in the world versus hate?</p>
<p>And you wonder, but then the other side, what is it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure who says this line,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something like we sleep at night</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a rough men out there</p>
<p>ready to fight for you.</p>
<p>There is some sense in which we have to make sure</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s strength coupled with the love, right?</p>
<p>Otherwise evil men will do evil onto the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very difficult decision,</p>
<p>but then you look at the final picture</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, what have we gotten for this $6 trillion?</p>
<p>What have we gotten for this 20 years?</p>
<p>The thousands of American soldiers who died,</p>
<p>the hundreds of thousands of civilians who have died.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a troubling subject for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a patriot, I love this country.</p>
<p>I love it with my soul.</p>
<p>And I was just about to head over to the first Iraqi war</p>
<p>and we went out for desert warfare training</p>
<p>and then it ended.</p>
<p>I was at that time a combat medic assigned</p>
<p>to an armored cav unit.</p>
<p>So basically tanks driving around</p>
<p>an armored personnel carrier and when it gets hit,</p>
<p>then you tend to that guy, try to save his life.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wanna go.</p>
<p>I may sound like a coward, I did not wanna go to war.</p>
<p>I would have went willingly if I was sent</p>
<p>to defend my country, I took my oath.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t join the military to kill,</p>
<p>but if necessary, I would.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use the analogy of cancer.</p>
<p>If you have a cancer and you&rsquo;re aware of its presence</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t annihilate those cells</p>
<p>and take them out quickly, it&rsquo;s gonna spread</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna kill you.</p>
<p>Those evil bastards that flew those airplanes,</p>
<p>one of those airplanes had a little three year old child</p>
<p>in it from Ireland where my mom&rsquo;s hometown.</p>
<p>A friend of mine who since died of a heart attack</p>
<p>from 9 11 toxins, he found her shoe</p>
<p>with human remains in it.</p>
<p>And he thought someone was messing with us</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t know there was any kids in the building.</p>
<p>He says, boss, there&rsquo;s a baby shoe</p>
<p>and it looks like there&rsquo;s something in it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no kids in the trade center.</p>
<p>I went, the plane, it&rsquo;s a little girl shoe.</p>
<p>I can never get that shoe out of my mind.</p>
<p>The evil bastards who perpetrated that</p>
<p>needed to have missiles strike and rain down upon them</p>
<p>and annihilate them like a cancer that they are.</p>
<p>What just fascinates me is they&rsquo;ll show videos</p>
<p>of these guys flying around and pick up trucks</p>
<p>with 50 cows on the back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, wait a minute.</p>
<p>If a camera crew can get this footage,</p>
<p>you think all these freaking drones and planes</p>
<p>and radar assisted systems can&rsquo;t just go</p>
<p>whist, whist, whist, goodnight, you&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>So kill the cancer, kill the cells, get rid of it,</p>
<p>get rid of it quickly and go into remission.</p>
<p>Like an undeniable show of force that sends a message</p>
<p>that gets rid of most of the obvious centers of terrorism.</p>
<p>And that note, that&rsquo;s though,</p>
<p>because we offline mentioned a discussion with Jaco</p>
<p>and maybe romanticize view and mentioning brothers in arms</p>
<p>by dire straits and saying we&rsquo;re all brothers in arms</p>
<p>even when it&rsquo;s on the opposite side of fighting,</p>
<p>which is more of a vision and growing up in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>you saw about World War II, that it&rsquo;s all just kids</p>
<p>thrown into the kids sent to die in all sides.</p>
<p>But then presenting that to Jaco who was in Iraq,</p>
<p>he did not see as brothers in arms,</p>
<p>which is his basic statement is there&rsquo;s evil people</p>
<p>and some people don&rsquo;t deserve the compassion.</p>
<p>You give them a few chances,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t take the chances they have to go</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re spreading evil onto the world.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not, we&rsquo;re not, all of us deserve a chance.</p>
<p>Oh no, absolutely, but the difference though,</p>
<p>and believe me, I, Jaco, I am from a way, way minor league</p>
<p>compared to him, right?</p>
<p>I mean, this man was right there in the firing line,</p>
<p>but I can understand his analogy</p>
<p>because when you think about it, right,</p>
<p>those young conscripts back in Germany and Russia</p>
<p>and all the countries where they were being drafted,</p>
<p>even our guys were being drafted and thrown into this.</p>
<p>They were gallantly and bravely defending their country.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure the young Germans felt,</p>
<p>well, hey, Hitler must be right, right?</p>
<p>And young Russians felt, hey, Stalin must be right.</p>
<p>And the young Americans figured,</p>
<p>hey, President Roosevelt must be right.</p>
<p>So they were romantically in a sense</p>
<p>defending the honor of their country, of their motherland.</p>
<p>The difference between those,</p>
<p>so they did have that commonality.</p>
<p>If you and I were firing across each other</p>
<p>from France to Germany or, you know,</p>
<p>from Germany to Russia or whatever,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just these two kids who got thrown into this.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t freaking ask for this, right?</p>
<p>But the difference with Jaco&rsquo;s enemy is</p>
<p>no one was attacking their country over there, right?</p>
<p>No one was taking their country over.</p>
<p>Maybe in their mind, they didn&rsquo;t want people</p>
<p>trying to build their government, this and that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know enough about the history there</p>
<p>to really elaborate.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t attack them.</p>
<p>And if a soldier attacks a soldier,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an understood concept amongst warriors.</p>
<p>But when a soldier attacks a civilian,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re after a different beast,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve written that beast off, if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the enemy, I mean, as Jaco explains,</p>
<p>the enemy in Iraq and just certain parts of the Middle East</p>
<p>is essentially terrorists who don&rsquo;t value the lives</p>
<p>of the civilians of their own country.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so it becomes like this weird guerrilla warfare</p>
<p>slash game of violence that ultimately allows them</p>
<p>to gain more power within their country,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>with civilian lives as pawns.</p>
<p>If you have a child who dies</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a civilian in their country,</p>
<p>that could be seen as a positive for them</p>
<p>because they can use that to leverage</p>
<p>for more and more power within that country.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re fighting an enemy like that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a vicious, that&rsquo;s an evil enemy.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like snakes are beautiful,</p>
<p>but if you go pet a rattler,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting bit and you&rsquo;re getting dead, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s with terrorists,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to cut the head of the snake off.</p>
<p>And I feel, no, don&rsquo;t commit our guys to be there anymore.</p>
<p>But what we need to do is go with tech warfare.</p>
<p>If we have intel from drones or planes or whatever it is</p>
<p>that so and so and so and so and so and so</p>
<p>are driving down in that pickup or whatever,</p>
<p>take it out and do it again tomorrow</p>
<p>and tomorrow and tomorrow.</p>
<p>And maybe they&rsquo;ll get the message after a while,</p>
<p>oh shit, these guys aren&rsquo;t messing around.</p>
<p>Instead of throwing wave after wave of our brave warriors,</p>
<p>brave SEALs, brave special ops guys,</p>
<p>and God bless them for what they do, I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I could not have done it.</p>
<p>But they have to be now sitting home going,</p>
<p>what the hell?</p>
<p>My friends, my body, myself,</p>
<p>like they must feel so betrayed</p>
<p>because they passionately went over there</p>
<p>to cure a cancer, the cancer of terrorism.</p>
<p>And now the cancer is back.</p>
<p>And I hate to say it,</p>
<p>but I think the cancer might start running wild.</p>
<p>We need to change our tactics up.</p>
<p>This is just my opinion.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see committing all of our guys</p>
<p>to a continuous eternal war.</p>
<p>But I think what we need to do is hit surgically</p>
<p>and hit hard at that cancer that is over there.</p>
<p>We are never gonna rebuild that region.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s thousands of years of traditions</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not going to change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just some people are unchangeable</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>And we have so many social problems here in our country,</p>
<p>I think that we need to fix first.</p>
<p>I heard this spoken in the past by many people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the garden theory.</p>
<p>You have your garden with a fence around it.</p>
<p>You tend to your garden.</p>
<p>There may be weeds on the outside of the fence,</p>
<p>but as long as they&rsquo;re not inside your garden,</p>
<p>your garden will prosper.</p>
<p>And I know some people don&rsquo;t agree to that America first</p>
<p>and the whole take care of our own,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, how are we gonna take in more people now?</p>
<p>And I have a human feeling for them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost like the lifeboat theory.</p>
<p>How many people can we take into the lifeboat</p>
<p>before the lifeboat itself sinks as the ship is going down?</p>
<p>So if we can&rsquo;t take care of our own homeless vets</p>
<p>and our own homeless people,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just gonna become worse.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, we need to just take a timeout</p>
<p>and I think switch our tactics a little bit.</p>
<p>And invest into helping people here at home.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few as obvious of cases</p>
<p>as the first responders in 9 11.</p>
<p>That one of the things that I really wanna kind of talk about</p>
<p>at least a little bit,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve already talked about the amazing project</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing the 20 for 20 podcast that you host.</p>
<p>We mentioned one story, Steven Siller,</p>
<p>is there other stories</p>
<p>or maybe you can speak out at a high level,</p>
<p>what are you hoping to tell?</p>
<p>And all these different stories that are weaved</p>
<p>about that connect the tragedies and the triumphs,</p>
<p>the heroism of that day</p>
<p>and the days and the years that followed.</p>
<p>You know, Lex, it seems like the common few themes,</p>
<p>the common threads are being selfless,</p>
<p>helping out others even though they might be a stranger,</p>
<p>in acts of kindness, acts of love,</p>
<p>and it seems to all be weaved together with faith.</p>
<p>They all seem to have some sort of faith.</p>
<p>I mean, we have one gentleman, Mark Hanna,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a Coptic Egyptian priest,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an immigrant to the United States.</p>
<p>He was a port authority building engineer.</p>
<p>And with his crew who subsequently passed away,</p>
<p>the crew did, he was effectively rescuing dozens of people</p>
<p>on the upper floors,</p>
<p>and his boss ordered him to assist an elderly gentleman</p>
<p>who was 89 down 78 flights of stairs to get him out.</p>
<p>And in stopping on the 21st floor,</p>
<p>he figured they would just wait there for medics.</p>
<p>He came across Captain Patty Brown of Ladder Company 3,</p>
<p>who told him, no, sir, you need to evacuate.</p>
<p>And Captain Brown picked his brain a little bit</p>
<p>about the structure because he figured,</p>
<p>found out he was an engineer.</p>
<p>And Captain Patty Brown continued on to effect rescues,</p>
<p>and he and his crew were killed.</p>
<p>But father, he&rsquo;s now,</p>
<p>Mark was able to effectively evacuate this gentleman.</p>
<p>They were the two known last survivors</p>
<p>to come out of the tower.</p>
<p>He now has dedicated his life to becoming a Coptic priest</p>
<p>in St. Mary&rsquo;s Church in East Brunswick, New Jersey.</p>
<p>He did this for a total stranger.</p>
<p>And he said he was inspired by his bosses who died</p>
<p>and his friends.</p>
<p>One of his best friends was an Italian man.</p>
<p>The other man was a retired Navy SEAL, Hispanic man.</p>
<p>And they were part of this melting pot.</p>
<p>And no one looked at each other that day,</p>
<p>what color, what race, what belief are you?</p>
<p>They just said, hey, you&rsquo;re a human in need, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>And we have the story about John Field</p>
<p>on his mission to help the responders.</p>
<p>We have a young lady, Mariah,</p>
<p>whose birth father was on flight 93.</p>
<p>She had not even met him.</p>
<p>And she had this premonition that somebody in her family</p>
<p>was killed that day.</p>
<p>And her adopted mom said, no, everyone&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Three years later, when she was legally able</p>
<p>to find out who her dad was,</p>
<p>she found out that her dad, Tom, was actually on that plane</p>
<p>as part of the Let&rsquo;s Roll team.</p>
<p>And we have a gentleman, Robert Burke,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an actor, sweetheart of a man.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a gentleman and he&rsquo;s a very, very popular actor</p>
<p>in Hollywood.</p>
<p>He was on Rescue Me, Blue Bloods, Gossip Girls.</p>
<p>And Bobby, my friend, as I call him,</p>
<p>is a volunteer fireman now.</p>
<p>This man doesn&rsquo;t need to get out of bed</p>
<p>at two oclock in the morning and help people with a stroke</p>
<p>or a burning garage or a burning house,</p>
<p>but he does because he wants to.</p>
<p>Because his best friend was Captain Patty Brown.</p>
<p>And his other best friend was Father Michael Judge,</p>
<p>who was our chaplain, who was killed,</p>
<p>literally blessing the victims at the site,</p>
<p>had just given last rites to the firefighter</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier, Danny, who was killed.</p>
<p>And Father Judge was in the lobby of the building,</p>
<p>giving a blessing, praying to God to please stop this.</p>
<p>And he was struck by debris and he was killed.</p>
<p>And Bobby goes on to elaborate about Father Judge&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Father Judge used to walk the streets of New York City,</p>
<p>helping AIDS patients just with whatever they needed.</p>
<p>And he was a Franciscan friar.</p>
<p>They wear sandals and a robe.</p>
<p>They just live very humble lives.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a common denominator is loving each other</p>
<p>and helping each other,</p>
<p>regardless of you know the person or not.</p>
<p>And really, when you think about it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how America was made.</p>
<p>We fought for independence.</p>
<p>Stranger fought next to stranger and fought tyranny</p>
<p>because they wanted freedom.</p>
<p>They wanted to be able to live, love, pray and prosper.</p>
<p>And they fought and died alongside of strangers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of symbolic of what happened that day.</p>
<p>And then strangers from around this great country</p>
<p>just flocked in by the thousands to help.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know who was in that pile, but they didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>That was another American.</p>
<p>And what I ultimately am trying to do</p>
<p>involved in this beautiful project</p>
<p>is spread the message of doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Look at these examples.</p>
<p>These brave people who didn&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>especially the civilians,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t paid to run back in there</p>
<p>and help person after person.</p>
<p>And they had no obligation.</p>
<p>They could have just said,</p>
<p>hey man, I&rsquo;m out of here and just bolted.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just trying to say to people,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s bring back that unity and that feeling of 912.</p>
<p>As strange as 912 of a day it was,</p>
<p>it was so sad because it was the first dawn of the sun</p>
<p>where we realized this wasn&rsquo;t a dream.</p>
<p>This was real and it&rsquo;s not going away.</p>
<p>But the beauty of it was there was thousands of people</p>
<p>lined up along the West Side Highway</p>
<p>with signs and American flags.</p>
<p>And they were from every country</p>
<p>and every race and every creed.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t matter who they were,</p>
<p>but they all shared one bond, love.</p>
<p>And they were hugging and crying and thanking rescuers.</p>
<p>And it brought the morale so high</p>
<p>for a group of people that was so beaten down the day before.</p>
<p>It just started lifting the morale</p>
<p>and making us realize, you know what?</p>
<p>People really do give a crap.</p>
<p>They really do love each other.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m gonna be honest with you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doubting that a little bit lately.</p>
<p>I still have these examples of it.</p>
<p>You know, that lady who helped me last night with the phone</p>
<p>and just, you know, I know there&rsquo;s these shining</p>
<p>little examples, but sometimes I think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, are we running out of them?</p>
<p>Well, I gotta give you some advice.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two words that were repeated often</p>
<p>in the days and the years after 911, which is never forget.</p>
<p>So might I remind you to never forget about 912.</p>
<p>I mean, those words, you talked about that, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people, what is it, college freshmen, maybe.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t even born.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s people in the 20s that were too young</p>
<p>to remember or to understand the events of that day.</p>
<p>But I think what that day, as you&rsquo;re describing, means,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the unity that followed.</p>
<p>It was tremendous, Lex.</p>
<p>I never felt so proud.</p>
<p>I was always proud of this country.</p>
<p>You know, I remember my grandpa Nels used to walk by,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d see a flag, I&rsquo;d hear the Star Spangled Banner</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d tear up and I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>Grant, why are you crying?</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m not crying, it&rsquo;s the tears of joy.</p>
<p>I love this country so much.</p>
<p>And I just remember like feeling that way.</p>
<p>I felt that way 910.</p>
<p>I felt that way on 911, but then on 912,</p>
<p>I was just so proud of just the people,</p>
<p>the way they stepped up.</p>
<p>And I just want to try to see if that can happen again.</p>
<p>And I hope it&rsquo;s not necessary for us to have another tragedy</p>
<p>to bring that about.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do that without the tragedy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just stop and say, hey, you know what?</p>
<p>Let me listen to what this guy has to say.</p>
<p>And maybe he&rsquo;s, he probably won&rsquo;t convince me,</p>
<p>but maybe I&rsquo;ll go, well, you know,</p>
<p>I never thought of it that way.</p>
<p>Stop the finger pointing, the bickering,</p>
<p>the tantrums, the fighting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not necessary.</p>
<p>It gets you nowhere, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, I was two years old</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d stomp around because I wanted a cookie</p>
<p>or a piece of candy.</p>
<p>I still didn&rsquo;t get it, right?</p>
<p>You know, turned blue in the face and whatever,</p>
<p>got a little swat in the rear end,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t get the candy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we got going on right now.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s just stomping around, being a baby.</p>
<p>Stop, just stop.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really lucky.</p>
<p>Look, the country&rsquo;s not perfect, right?</p>
<p>You know, but it&rsquo;s damn good.</p>
<p>It gives us all these opportunities, you know?</p>
<p>Like I said, no one&rsquo;s rushing out the gates</p>
<p>to get out of here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re freaking, I got a cousin of mine.</p>
<p>I love him dearly.</p>
<p>My cousin Tony in Ireland.</p>
<p>And he said, he&rsquo;s just a little older than me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in his fifties.</p>
<p>He said, man, I should have done it.</p>
<p>I should have went to America.</p>
<p>My dad said, go to America.</p>
<p>I went to England and he went back to Ireland.</p>
<p>And you know, but he&rsquo;s happy in Ireland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his home.</p>
<p>But he said, wow, what a place of opportunity.</p>
<p>And I said, it&rsquo;s never too late.</p>
<p>He goes, yeah, but you know what?</p>
<p>You get tied down.</p>
<p>And I understand that.</p>
<p>I thank God my mom came here at 16.</p>
<p>I thank God my grandpa got on that ship.</p>
<p>But in his 20s, 27, I think, you know,</p>
<p>with not a nickel to rub together.</p>
<p>I thank God they did it.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t know where else I would have ended up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no place else I want to be.</p>
<p>And I thank God that there&rsquo;s people like you</p>
<p>who rushed towards ground zero to help other human beings.</p>
<p>And I believe that that human spirit</p>
<p>is ultimately represents the best of this country</p>
<p>and the best of this world.</p>
<p>Thank you for the stories you&rsquo;re telling,</p>
<p>for your perseverance in that.</p>
<p>And thank you for welcoming me to the crew.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very welcome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll take you any day.</p>
<p>You look like you could do the job just fine.</p>
<p>I love lifting heavy things and doing dangerous things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m proud to be part of this country</p>
<p>and part of the Tally Ho now.</p>
<p>Well, you are definitely an attribute to America</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re glad you chose to come here.</p>
<p>You know, Lex, it&rsquo;s such a beautiful place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful melting pot.</p>
<p>You know, if we were all the same,</p>
<p>it would be kind of a boring place, right?</p>
<p>Kind of boring.</p>
<p>It really would.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just such a great place.</p>
<p>And I just want to say thanks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor to have someone to let me sound off</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be even bigger honor</p>
<p>if somebody will listen to me and just say,</p>
<p>hey, you know, let me just try to do something good today.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s the tunnel to towers mantra</p>
<p>is let us do good.</p>
<p>And I just, you know,</p>
<p>I got a really big credit card with God,</p>
<p>a big balance, right?</p>
<p>I need to pay him back a lot</p>
<p>and I need to pay him forward.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just going to spend the rest of my days</p>
<p>trying my best.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where this is going to go,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;ll lead into,</p>
<p>but I really would like to get those dogs</p>
<p>or those vets and build them that village</p>
<p>and just keep going on from project to project</p>
<p>to just say, when my final day comes</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m laying there and I say, you know what?</p>
<p>I really made the most of that second chance</p>
<p>God gave me way back in 2011.</p>
<p>I mean, I hope it&rsquo;s 30, 40 years from now,</p>
<p>but even if it&rsquo;s 30 months from now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving it the best shot.</p>
<p>So thank you, sir.</p>
<p>I appreciate it and wishing you blessings</p>
<p>and success in your career.</p>
<p>Keep up the good fight</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re always welcome back to Texas.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great food and a little hot,</p>
<p>a little hot, but I can deal with it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do so good Irish in the sun, you know?</p>
<p>Well, the barbecue and the people are worth it.</p>
<p>No, they are, they&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>I was down here for some storm relief a few years ago</p>
<p>and I tell you what, I fell in love with it.</p>
<p>The people are great, it&rsquo;s a great state</p>
<p>and yeah, I&rsquo;ll definitely be back again for sure.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking to me, Neil.</p>
<p>Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>Appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Niels Jorgensen.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Human kindness has never weakened the stamina</p>
<p>or softened the fiber of a free people.</p>
<p>A nation does not have to be cruel, to be tough.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
