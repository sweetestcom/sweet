    <ul>
<li>Well, good afternoon, everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>And welcome to the first Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series</p>
<p>of the academic year.</p>
<p>Our event today is co-sponsored by BERC,</p>
<p>which is the student led</p>
<p>Berkeley Energy and Resources Collaborative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the largest of its kind in the United States.</p>
<p>Anybody here who&rsquo;s a member of BERC raise your hands.</p>
<p>Woohoo, woo.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also co-sponsored by the Energy Institute at Haas,</p>
<p>which brings together the largest concentration</p>
<p>of energy economists of any university in the country.</p>
<p>And we have a number of leaders from the Energy Institute,</p>
<p>you wanna stand up if you&rsquo;re part of the Energy Institute.</p>
<p>Woohoo.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>We are really fortunate to have this incredible resource</p>
<p>of research and relationships</p>
<p>and it really is important in helping government agencies</p>
<p>and companies at our school.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really excited to see you all here today,</p>
<p>and to welcome our guest, Pierre Breber.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, especially delighted to host Pierre</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s coming back to his alma mater.</p>
<p>Pierre earned his bachelor&rsquo;s. - Hey, go Bears.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go Bears.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>Pierre earned both his bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re a double Bear,</p>
<p>in mechanical engineering here at UC Berkeley</p>
<p>in 1986 and 1987,</p>
<p>he then went on to earn his MBA from Cornell University</p>
<p>in 1989.</p>
<p>Today, Pierre serves as vice president</p>
<p>and chief financial officer of Chevron.</p>
<p>Pierre has more than 25 years of service at Chevron.</p>
<p>He started in 1989 as a financial analyst.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s held a wide variety of roles</p>
<p>throughout the organization.</p>
<p>Most recently, as EVP of downstream and chemicals</p>
<p>and also EVP of gas and midstream.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s held leadership positions,</p>
<p>both in the United States and globally abroad,</p>
<p>including in Asia and in Europe.</p>
<p>He also serves as chair of the board of directors</p>
<p>of United Way Bay Area.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a board member</p>
<p>of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.</p>
<p>So Pierre, we are really, really glad to have you here</p>
<p>for this conversation, for this important conversation.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re kicking off today,</p>
<p>the first of our Sustainable Futures Events</p>
<p>as part of our Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be having a series of leaders,</p>
<p>both in the private sector, in business, and in government,</p>
<p>who will be coming to speak to us about sustainable futures.</p>
<p>So we created the Sustainable Futurist Track</p>
<p>here at Haas because we believe that developing</p>
<p>a sustainable climate resilient economy,</p>
<p>goes into every aspect of business,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s agriculture, real estate, energy, finance,</p>
<p>anything and everything will need to be reimagined</p>
<p>and redesigned to address the current</p>
<p>environmental, social and economic crises.</p>
<p>We really believe here at Haas</p>
<p>that addressing our climate crisis</p>
<p>and transition to a carbon free energy source</p>
<p>is an integral component of the world&rsquo;s sustainable future.</p>
<p>Now the bad news is that even though so many companies</p>
<p>and so many governments have been making pledges</p>
<p>to reduce their emissions to net zero by 2030.</p>
<p>In fact, every year annual emissions of greenhouse gases</p>
<p>are still going up, not down.</p>
<p>We know from recent IPCC reports</p>
<p>that just stabilizing emissions isn&rsquo;t enough,</p>
<p>we need to cut emissions to net zero by 2050.</p>
<p>But actually more urgently,</p>
<p>we need to cut them in half by 2030,</p>
<p>which is only eight years from now.</p>
<p>Now the good news is a lot can happen.</p>
<p>We already have a lot of the technologies that we need</p>
<p>and the cost of those technologies to cut emissions,</p>
<p>especially in renewable energy is really falling quickly.</p>
<p>Now climate change isn&rsquo;t just about risk,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about incredible opportunities.</p>
<p>That low carbon transformation can lead to</p>
<p>better quality jobs,</p>
<p>it can lead to health benefits</p>
<p>as we reduce our pollution levels,</p>
<p>it can create many new and exciting companies,</p>
<p>which I really hope that Haas</p>
<p>and Berkeley students and faculty will be leaders in.</p>
<p>It can also help disadvantaged communities</p>
<p>and it can be a terrific investment opportunity.</p>
<p>So to ensure that we reach these goals</p>
<p>and this transformation,</p>
<p>we really need to have leaders</p>
<p>who can lead these transformations.</p>
<p>And although I&rsquo;m very heartened to see</p>
<p>the recent legislation that was passed</p>
<p>by Biden&rsquo;s Administration on climate change,</p>
<p>I personally believe that it is business</p>
<p>that is leading right now on climate and on sustainability.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s conversation is one step,</p>
<p>one important step in this effort.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re very, very grateful to Pierre</p>
<p>for being here with us today</p>
<p>so that we can have this important conversation</p>
<p>as we work to educate the next generation</p>
<p>of sustainability focused leaders.</p>
<p>So please join me again in welcoming Pierre Breber.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>So the way we&rsquo;re going to conduct this</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m going to ask a number of questions</p>
<p>for maybe about half an hour, 30 minutes,</p>
<p>and then you all will have a open Q&amp;A</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have a chance to ask questions</p>
<p>that are on your mind.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna start with my first question.</p>
<p>So you began your career as a financial analyst at Chevron,</p>
<p>and today you&rsquo;re the CFO.</p>
<p>So tell us a little bit about this journey.</p>
<p>What are some of the experiences that shaped this journey</p>
<p>and what has really led you to stay</p>
<p>all these years at Chevron?</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks Anne, thanks everyone for joining us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it started here, 40 years ago, hard to believe,</p>
<p>I was a freshman in the engineering school</p>
<p>and as a junior, a professor,</p>
<p>I took a class from a professor</p>
<p>and he invited me to work in his research lab</p>
<p>and he was doing combustion research.</p>
<p>So at an engine lab, ended up working with him,</p>
<p>ended up at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.</p>
<p>And really that&rsquo;s when I was exposed to energy</p>
<p>and was fascinated by it.</p>
<p>As you said, I later went to Cornell and got an MBA</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m from this area,</p>
<p>my future wife is also from this area,</p>
<p>and wanna stay connected.</p>
<p>And so energy and the Bay Area really led me to Chevron.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really pleased that I&rsquo;ve been able to have</p>
<p>the career at Chevron and keep connected to the Bay Area</p>
<p>and all the friends and family that we have here.</p>
<p>The third element really is being happy.</p>
<p>And I hope all of you find happiness</p>
<p>in your professional career,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve invested a lot of time in your education,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been happy for 33 years.</p>
<p>And so the first thing I&rsquo;d point to is my ability,</p>
<p>I was able to balance work and life at Chevron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a value that the company respects and supports,</p>
<p>and as important as our professional life is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way more important that I&rsquo;m a good father</p>
<p>to our three kids, a good husband to my wife of 26 years.</p>
<p>A son to my mother who lives not too far from here,</p>
<p>a brother to my three sisters and on and on.</p>
<p>So all the roles we play outside of work require time</p>
<p>and that balance and I&rsquo;ve been able to maintain that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part of what kept me at Chevron.</p>
<p>I did have professional growth</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;ve had new opportunities,</p>
<p>had a chance to live in different parts of the world,</p>
<p>all that was part of keeping me happy.</p>
<p>And then energy is intellectually challenging.</p>
<p>I read the Energy Institute&rsquo;s Monday blogs every week,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating, to work in energy, the geopolitics,</p>
<p>the technology, obviously the environmental impacts,</p>
<p>the economic impacts,</p>
<p>the role it plays in the underlying economy.</p>
<p>So all those things is part of the reason</p>
<p>why I stayed at Chevron,</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m still happy and honored to be CFO.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I mean, you&rsquo;ve had so many different roles</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been there for a while</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;ve finished your MBA.</p>
<p>How has your leadership style evolved</p>
<p>in taking on these larger and larger roles?</p>
<p>And one of the questions we&rsquo;ve been asking our leaders</p>
<p>who come to this event is,</p>
<p>and did the pandemic really change how you yourself lead</p>
<p>at Chevron?</p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier in my career, feedback was really the key.</li>
</ul>
<p>I came out of school and within a handful of years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leading people, and I thought I was a great leader,</p>
<p>of course I was.</p>
<p>And it turns out I had strengths,</p>
<p>but I had things that I could do better.</p>
<p>And having 360 confidential feedback early in my career,</p>
<p>relatively early in my career,</p>
<p>I learned that I need to listen more,</p>
<p>keep an open mind, slow down.</p>
<p>I was so focused on the task and getting stuff done,</p>
<p>not paying enough attention to relationships.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s advice, that&rsquo;s good for work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for outside of work too, and your relationships.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one early experience.</p>
<p>If I go about 10 years ago,</p>
<p>so the first 20 years of my career,</p>
<p>I was largely in finance and commercial roles.</p>
<p>And then in 2011,</p>
<p>I was asked to lead what we call our upstream,</p>
<p>it was oil and gas producing operations in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>And I had never done those jobs, technically,</p>
<p>or operational jobs.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m leading a big business,</p>
<p>multi-billion dollar business,</p>
<p>without having really have grown up in those kinds of roles.</p>
<p>And so what that taught me was really</p>
<p>how you have to trust and empower your teams.</p>
<p>And literally you have to,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t have the foundation and the expertise,</p>
<p>but again, that&rsquo;s something that translates now</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m back in finance, trusting teams, empowering them,</p>
<p>trusting your direct reports.</p>
<p>Obviously, makes their job more satisfying.</p>
<p>And it frees me up to balance work and life</p>
<p>and do some other things that only I can uniquely do</p>
<p>from my position.</p>
<p>In terms of COVID, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fairly recent and have been at it for a long time,</p>
<p>but clearly flexibility, we were talking a bit beforehand.</p>
<p>COVID has taught us that for our type of work,</p>
<p>at least, office work, it&rsquo;s an activity, it&rsquo;s not a place.</p>
<p>When I joined at Chevron, you showed up every day,</p>
<p>and eight to five, nine to five, whatever it was,</p>
<p>for a job you could do from your living room,</p>
<p>almost even back then, maybe not quite.</p>
<p>And so being much more flexible.</p>
<p>I think the next generation,</p>
<p>you all will be able to balance work and life much easier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still hard, right?</p>
<p>Two career couples, kids, whatever you have going on,</p>
<p>elderly parents, all the challenges that are out there,</p>
<p>but being flexible in where you do your work</p>
<p>gives you a much better chance of doing that.</p>
<p>And so I think we&rsquo;ve just embraced that in Chevron Finance,</p>
<p>in particular, we&rsquo;re focused on the work, not the workplace.</p>
<p>And we want to get our teams together</p>
<p>for this kind of events</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s really good to see everybody,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s lots of things people can do remotely</p>
<p>and they should continue to do it that way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, thanks so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, the point about really trusting</p>
<p>and empowering your team,</p>
<p>that really, really resonates with me personally.</p>
<p>I mean, I have my chief operating officer</p>
<p>and chief strategy officer, Courtney Chandler,</p>
<p>sitting right there.</p>
<p>And I think I have learned so much</p>
<p>about the power of trusting and empowering others,</p>
<p>and the amazing things that she and her team</p>
<p>and the rest of them have been able to achieve</p>
<p>during this pandemic is amazing.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I&rsquo;ve learned,</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;ve been really spending a lot of time on</p>
<p>as the dean here,</p>
<p>is what does it mean to create a sustainable education</p>
<p>for our students?</p>
<p>And one of the things we&rsquo;ve decided</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re not just trying to educate</p>
<p>the chief sustainability officer,</p>
<p>who will be over in this one office in the company</p>
<p>and will do whatever it takes.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re trying to do is we&rsquo;re moving towards</p>
<p>an education where students,</p>
<p>no matter what role they&rsquo;re going to take in the company,</p>
<p>whatever role that is,</p>
<p>they will have a sustainable viewpoint</p>
<p>as they take on that task.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of wondering,</p>
<p>what do you think about that?</p>
<p>Is that the way you&rsquo;re thinking about sustainability</p>
<p>in terms of your employees and your own role at Chevron?</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely, ESG, which really is probably what underpins</li>
</ul>
<p>sustainability,</p>
<p>is a mega trend that has only accelerated.</p>
<p>And it reflects the interests of many of our investors</p>
<p>who of course want to save for retirement,</p>
<p>or teachers funds, or university endowments,</p>
<p>they want to grow their savings</p>
<p>and grow their wealth for some future expenditure.</p>
<p>And they want to also contribute to societies,</p>
<p>meeting objectives and making society better,</p>
<p>and the ability to do both.</p>
<p>And so that underpins our shareholders</p>
<p>and investors all across the market.</p>
<p>Our primary objective is to safely deliver</p>
<p>higher returns and lower carbon.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a simple message, higher returns, lower carbon.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s meant to capture and balance</p>
<p>our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders,</p>
<p>who are again, teachers and firefighters,</p>
<p>and folks saving for retirement.</p>
<p>And so they earn a good return on their investment.</p>
<p>And lower carbon is to do our part</p>
<p>to address the risk of climate change,</p>
<p>and society&rsquo;s objectives to, as you said, Anne,</p>
<p>reduce emissions.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s central to our message to our investors,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s central to our employees.</p>
<p>Every employee can connect to</p>
<p>how can I make this asset higher returns?</p>
<p>How can I lower costs or add revenue?</p>
<p>And every employee can do something to also lower the carbon</p>
<p>of whether it&rsquo;s our traditional business</p>
<p>or our new energy business.</p>
<p>So it is something that our employees have rallied around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear and simple.</p>
<p>And as CFO, I spend a lot of time in this space</p>
<p>because probably the number one question,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll get to this Anne,</p>
<p>and that Chevron shareholders have, or the market has,</p>
<p>is how does Chevron sustain higher returns</p>
<p>in a lower carbon future?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a really important part of my job.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will definitely get to that question.</li>
</ul>
<p>But let me ask you a little bit more about your role as CFO.</p>
<p>So in this role, you have wide responsibilities,</p>
<p>you oversee the tax, the treasury,</p>
<p>and the investor relations worldwide.</p>
<p>So Chevron&rsquo;s in over 100 countries,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the largest companies in the world.</p>
<p>What are some of the unique opportunities</p>
<p>that this role has afforded you?</p>
<p>And what are some of the challenges that you&rsquo;ve faced?</p>
<ul>
<li>The global part of the company is something</li>
</ul>
<p>that always appealed to me, it&rsquo;s a big world out there.</p>
<p>And billions and billions of people</p>
<p>and all across the continents.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been able travel to every continent,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in two other continents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with people from all around the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of what attracted me to energy</p>
<p>and attracted me to Chevron.</p>
<p>The reality is there&rsquo;s a crisis somewhere in the world,</p>
<p>almost every single day, in Chevron,</p>
<p>just because there&rsquo;s so many countries,</p>
<p>something is gonna happen, but trust and empower teams,</p>
<p>we have really good people locally,</p>
<p>that can manage that and do manage that.</p>
<p>So what is unique in terms of challenge</p>
<p>and opportunities for me is really this investor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what we call winning back investors.</p>
<p>So energy has underperformed the market</p>
<p>over the last 10 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done pretty well the last year plus,</p>
<p>but if you look over 10 years,</p>
<p>it has underperformed the broader market.</p>
<p>And we have investors, large institutions</p>
<p>that owned more of our shares and that we have not</p>
<p>convinced them or shown them</p>
<p>that we can sustain higher returns in a lower carbon future.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really what is the challenge,</p>
<p>but also the opportunity,</p>
<p>and a big part that&rsquo;s unique to my role.</p>
<ul>
<li>So that actually brings me to my next question,</li>
</ul>
<p>which is over these decades,</p>
<p>how have you seen attitudes towards the oil and gas industry</p>
<p>shift in part, in particular,</p>
<p>I guess the question is,</p>
<p>have you seen investors change their perception</p>
<p>of the oil and gas industry,</p>
<p>or are they changing their perceptions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 33 years, you see a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve seen the Asian crisis in the late &rsquo;90s,</p>
<p>when the economists said oil was never gonna become</p>
<p>more than $10 a barrel, you know, headline story,</p>
<p>to Beijing Olympics in 2008,</p>
<p>and oil goes over $140, to an economic crisis, in &lsquo;08, &lsquo;09,</p>
<p>and COVID.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen technology change to where we can produce</p>
<p>oil and gas from areas we never thought we could.</p>
<p>We see it again, a lot around the geopolitics.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll just step back and say,</p>
<p>experience is a really nice thing to have.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s wonderful to be young</p>
<p>and going to school and learning.</p>
<p>And again, that was 40 years ago for me now.</p>
<p>And one thing about having been around is you see a lot.</p>
<p>And so when COVID hit,</p>
<p>we were prepared and we knew what to do.</p>
<p>I called the two CFO predecessors</p>
<p>just to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t missing anything,</p>
<p>but we had a playbook because we&rsquo;d been through &lsquo;08, &lsquo;09,</p>
<p>for us, &lsquo;14, &lsquo;15 was another time when oil prices</p>
<p>decreased about 50%, almost overnight.</p>
<p>And so we knew what to do.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s comforting</p>
<p>because in what could be a stressful situation,</p>
<p>we knew what to do.</p>
<p>In terms of investors, again, in the 2000s,</p>
<p>it ran up along with oil prices,</p>
<p>and then there really are two big investors shifts.</p>
<p>And so if you go back about 10 years,</p>
<p>oil prices were $100 a barrel,</p>
<p>but investors started to decrease their weighting to energy,</p>
<p>primarily because they felt we were overinvesting.</p>
<p>And in hindsight, we were.</p>
<p>And the view at that time is that oil and gas was scarce,</p>
<p>we were running out of it and we needed to go</p>
<p>after higher cost supplies, and the market corrected,</p>
<p>and a lot of those investments were low return.</p>
<p>And prices sort of bounced back in &lsquo;17, &lsquo;18, &lsquo;19,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really when ESG became very mainstream.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when investors said,</p>
<p>okay, well, maybe you&rsquo;re making money now,</p>
<p>but how do I know you can make that money again</p>
<p>in a lower carbon future?</p>
<p>So for sure, we&rsquo;ve seen investor sentiment change</p>
<p>during the whole time.</p>
<p>But the last two moves have been again for the most part,</p>
<p>negative, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re trying to win them back.</p>
<p>And I feel we have actions and answers to both</p>
<p>why we&rsquo;re much more disciplined with capital,</p>
<p>why we&rsquo;ll generate higher returns,</p>
<p>and we have very clear strategies and actions,</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re part of a lower carbon future.</p>
<ul>
<li>So actually that brings me to my next question.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of companies and individuals define sustainability</p>
<p>in a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love for you to just give us kind of the big picture.</p>
<p>How does Chevron define sustainability</p>
<p>and you say you&rsquo;re moving towards a low carbon future,</p>
<p>what kind of measures is Chevron putting in place</p>
<p>to meet those sustainability goals?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, we put out a sustainability report,</li>
</ul>
<p>I encourage anyone to read it.</p>
<p>If you think of ESG, lots of times, you know,</p>
<p>the S is really important,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of things around diversity, inclusion,</p>
<p>and racial equity and all kinds of activities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the Thurgood Marshall College Fund Board,</p>
<p>as we talked about,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s important things in governance.</p>
<p>And then even within E, the environment,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s water issues, there&rsquo;s biodiversity,</p>
<p>and local air pollution and others.</p>
<p>But it usually does for us become mostly about the E,</p>
<p>mostly about climate, which is very understandable.</p>
<p>So we have very clear guidance and targets in both areas.</p>
<p>The first is our traditional oil and gas business,</p>
<p>as you pointed out, demand for our products is growing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not decreasing.</p>
<p>And we need to meet that demand.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t, you know, prices will go really high</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not good either.</p>
<p>But we want to meet that demand</p>
<p>at the lowest carbon possible.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re a top quartile producer,</p>
<p>which means that 75% of the oil and gas</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s produced in the world today</p>
<p>is produced with higher carbon intensity</p>
<p>than what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And then we have targets by 2028, to lower that further,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll be 35% lower by 2028 than 2016,</p>
<p>when the Paris Agreement was signed,</p>
<p>2028 is a second stock take period,</p>
<p>which is why we chose that.</p>
<p>We also have a net zero aspiration for our upstream,</p>
<p>our oil and gas production by 2050.</p>
<p>So that would take it further down from 2028 to zero</p>
<p>in 2050.</p>
<p>And then we have a metric that captures</p>
<p>the full value chain of emissions.</p>
<p>We call it portfolio carbon intensity</p>
<p>and includes scope one, two, and three,</p>
<p>for folks to understand that, it&rsquo;s pretty complicated.</p>
<p>But the idea is that you wanna look at</p>
<p>the whole life cycle emissions.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some things,</p>
<p>that if you look at one piece of it, you say,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s lower carbon,</p>
<p>but then you have to look at well,</p>
<p>what is upstream and what is downstream of that?</p>
<p>And so we have a metric that captures all aspects</p>
<p>of our products through the life cycle.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s in the traditional business.</p>
<p>How do we make the traditional oil and gas business,</p>
<p>lower carbon?</p>
<p>And then if we go to new energies,</p>
<p>we have three business lines, renewable fuels,</p>
<p>hydrogen, carbon capture and storage.</p>
<p>We have very clear targets for all three,</p>
<p>100,000 barrels a day by 2030 in renewable fuels.</p>
<p>We just acquired a company called Renewable Energy Group,</p>
<p>it makes us the second largest biodiesel,</p>
<p>renewable diesel producer in the country,</p>
<p>the third largest in the world.</p>
<p>We have 150,000 tons per year of low carbon hydrogen</p>
<p>by 2030 and then 25 million tons of carbon capture</p>
<p>and storage.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s guidance to 2030, it might go faster,</p>
<p>it might go slower.</p>
<p>And then again, it&rsquo;s an energy transition.</p>
<p>We need to sync up supply and demand.</p>
<p>And depending on how things go,</p>
<p>we can do more traditional energy</p>
<p>or more new energies.</p>
<p>All three of those business lines have great promise.</p>
<p>They all have challenges, and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll talk about &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>But of course, companies like Chevron</p>
<p>have to be part of the solution,</p>
<p>we have to do our part, and I think we are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks. I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m actually gonna ask you a question</li>
</ul>
<p>about your acquisition of the Renewable Energy Group.</p>
<p>in just a second.</p>
<p>But I just wanna ask a question about carbon capture</p>
<p>and storage,</p>
<p>so we know, or we have the impression</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a significant component of Chevron&rsquo;s plan</p>
<p>for achieving net zero upstream emission goals.</p>
<p>Now, does Chevron see that as becoming commercially viable?</p>
<p>Because right now it&rsquo;s operating at a pretty limited scale.</p>
<ul>
<li>So I&rsquo;d say outside of wind and solar,</li>
</ul>
<p>most things are nascent in terms of solutions,</p>
<p>and wind and solar works well</p>
<p>for lowering the carbon intensity of the grid,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t help United Airlines</p>
<p>fly people across the country.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help cement manufacturing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help heavy duty transport,</p>
<p>18 wheelers on the interstate.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of hard to abate sectors</p>
<p>where renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets,</p>
<p>can be the solution.</p>
<p>So in terms of carbon capture and storage,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just for our own emissions.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s industrial emitters</p>
<p>and coal&rsquo;s still 25% of the US power grid, right?</p>
<p>Natural gas is 50% of the California power grid.</p>
<p>So there are gonna be CO2 emissions,</p>
<p>almost every net zero scenario has carbon capture storage</p>
<p>as one of the tools in the toolkit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting from a small base,</p>
<p>but again, it&rsquo;s making progress.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you a couple examples.</p>
<p>We operate one of the world&rsquo;s largest</p>
<p>carbon capture and storage projects in Australia,</p>
<p>at a place called Gorgon,</p>
<p>up to 4 million tons per year.</p>
<p>We just acquired leases offshore, Texas,</p>
<p>this is the first lease in the United States</p>
<p>that is dedicated to storing CO2.</p>
<p>I mean, you need a place to put it,</p>
<p>there needs to be a regulatory framework,</p>
<p>you need to have leases for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the reverse of what we&rsquo;ve done for years,</p>
<p>is take oil and gas out of the ground.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s putting CO2 back in.</p>
<p>We recently just were rewarded three leases in Australia,</p>
<p>same thing, land, or this is offshore,</p>
<p>dedicated to storing CO2 underground.</p>
<p>Again, when you store it, you&rsquo;re storing it forever.</p>
<p>So it needs to be a certain kind of structure</p>
<p>that you put it into.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re working on reducing the technology</p>
<p>of capturing the carbon.</p>
<p>So CO2 comes out with steam, right, water, nitrogen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 10% of what&rsquo;s emitted.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t wanna inject the other 90%.</p>
<p>You want to capture that 10% and then store that.</p>
<p>But the cost of that needs to come down.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re investing in companies like Svante</p>
<p>and Carbon Clean that are working on technologies</p>
<p>to lower the cost of capture.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re piloting their technology,</p>
<p>including in the Central Valley, near Bakersfield.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re putting it in real life situations</p>
<p>and see how we can capture the carbon.</p>
<p>So again, 25 million tons is a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s about the total emissions</p>
<p>of the state of New York.</p>
<p>So is it, you know, gigatons? No.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s good progress if we get there by 2030.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, Pierre, thanks for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Pierre already knows this, but I&rsquo;m gonna tell you all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask a couple of even tougher questions now.</p>
<p>And somehow I feel that I can do this</p>
<p>because as Pierre knows,</p>
<p>the reason that I was raised in the Bay Area,</p>
<p>is &lsquo;cause my father took a job at Chevron 40 years ago</p>
<p>and we moved to Pinole, California.</p>
<p>And he went to the refinery every day as a researcher.</p>
<p>And so this debate that Pierre and I are having,</p>
<p>which might get a little more intense,</p>
<p>I used to have with my father at the dining room table</p>
<p>in Pinole for 15 years where his daughter would say,</p>
<p>daddy, how can you possibly be doing X?</p>
<p>And daddy would explain what he was doing.</p>
<p>But anyway, on that side note, here&rsquo;s my next question,</p>
<p>so recent news has highlighted Chevron&rsquo;s acquisition</p>
<p>of the Renewable Energy Group, which according to Chevron,</p>
<p>will enable the company to grow its</p>
<p>renewable fuels production capacity to 100,000 barrels a day</p>
<p>by 2030.</p>
<p>Yet, right now, as we know, Chevron&rsquo;s oil production</p>
<p>is not just a 100,000, it&rsquo;s 1.2 million barrels per day.</p>
<p>So how does the discrepancy between those two numbers</p>
<p>indicate that you really do have a solid base</p>
<p>for transitioning away from oil and gas</p>
<p>to clean energy in the future?</p>
<ul>
<li>A couple things, first, as I said,</li>
</ul>
<p>we&rsquo;re the second largest renewable diesel,</p>
<p>biodiesel producer in the country,</p>
<p>third largest in the world.</p>
<p>So it reflects that this is a nascent industry.</p>
<p>There are constraints on renewable fuels</p>
<p>because they come from land</p>
<p>and it competes with food sources.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Renewable Energy Group,</p>
<p>70% of its feed stock are waste oils.</p>
<p>So this is not soybean oil, it&rsquo;s not competing with land.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s taking used cooking oil, distillers&rsquo; corn oil,</p>
<p>beef tallow, and turning that into renewable diesel,</p>
<p>and then one day sustainable aviation fuel.</p>
<p>So there are limits on it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re working on other, cover crops.</p>
<p>So you could grow something in between productive land use.</p>
<p>Because we know there could be a food crisis</p>
<p>also happening right now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, it was close to zero</p>
<p>just a handful of years ago.</p>
<p>So this is a growing industry.</p>
<p>It addresses again, a hard to abate sector,</p>
<p>heavy duty transport, air transport, marine transport,</p>
<p>some rail transport.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of heavy duty transport</p>
<p>that is not gonna be electrified anytime soon</p>
<p>or possibly ever,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause batteries are just too heavy for it.</p>
<p>Where renewable fuels and hydrogen,</p>
<p>which we can talk about too, can play a role.</p>
<p>So I wanna be clear and this is where</p>
<p>people can have different points of view.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t said we&rsquo;re transitioning from one to the other,</p>
<p>we said, we&rsquo;re gonna do both.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have a traditional business,</p>
<p>that is gonna be very low carbon,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna meet the demand that society has,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re gonna have faster growing,</p>
<p>new energy business.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t think we have to make a choice</p>
<p>of one or the other, we think we can do both.</p>
<p>And then depending on the pace of the energy transition,</p>
<p>the speed of the two and the size of the two may vary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to turn to the IPCC.</p>
<p>Now the IPCC states that emissions</p>
<p>from existing and currently planned fossil fuel projects</p>
<p>are more than the earth can support</p>
<p>to avoid the worst effects of climate change.</p>
<p>That same idea has been highlighted</p>
<p>by the International Energy Agency,</p>
<p>and a number of academics and environmentalists,</p>
<p>which means that nations around the world</p>
<p>need to stop approving new coal fired plants</p>
<p>or new oil and gas fields.</p>
<p>Now, how will Chevron take this information</p>
<p>into consideration as it looks to the future</p>
<p>for developing new drilling sites?</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand for our products is growing, not shrinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s seven and a half billion people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to 9 billion people,</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of people,</p>
<p>hopefully billions are gonna come out of poverty,</p>
<p>go to a higher standard of living,</p>
<p>get something closer to the standard of living that we have,</p>
<p>and that takes energy.</p>
<p>And again, wind and solar, there&rsquo;s lots of renewable power,</p>
<p>but power is one part of the energy mix.</p>
<p>So we see a role for traditional oil and gas.</p>
<p>Now, again, I said, we&rsquo;re top quartile,</p>
<p>we intend to go even better than that.</p>
<p>But also we&rsquo;re 2% of the traditional oil and gas market.</p>
<p>And so we can grow and be most responsible on carbon,</p>
<p>the financially strongest,</p>
<p>technically have the best engineers like your dad</p>
<p>and others that we have, solve all the best problems.</p>
<p>If and when oil does decline,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a big, big market.</p>
<p>And we were talking earlier,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s hundreds of operators of oil and gas fields</p>
<p>just here in California, thousands in the United States,</p>
<p>more if you go around the world,</p>
<p>having the most responsible companies</p>
<p>provide the traditional energy you need,</p>
<p>every IPCC scenario does have oil and gas in 2050,</p>
<p>you can get to net zero again, in other ways.</p>
<p>But there are just some hard to abate sectors</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna have oil and gas,</p>
<p>even in the most aggressive scenarios.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a role</p>
<p>for the most responsible companies to play in that.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re very clear, we&rsquo;re gonna do both.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna be a really strong,</p>
<p>responsible traditional energy provider,</p>
<p>and we intend to be a leading a new energy provider,</p>
<p>not in wind and solar, where we don&rsquo;t have capability,</p>
<p>but in these businesses, renewable fuels,</p>
<p>hydrogen, carbon capture and storage,</p>
<p>where we have unique strengths, where we have capabilities,</p>
<p>where we have assets that we can leverage,</p>
<p>and where we have customers</p>
<p>who are looking for solutions.</p>
<p>Again, United Airlines, you know,</p>
<p>batteries don&rsquo;t help United Airlines,</p>
<p>heavy duty transport, 18 wheelers,</p>
<p>batteries, EV, electrifying that is not a solution.</p>
<p>Those companies have serious climate commitments</p>
<p>and pledges too.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t work with us, with Chevron,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll work with other companies, they&rsquo;ll fund startups,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause they are very serious about</p>
<p>addressing climate change too.</p>
<p>We wanna work with our customers</p>
<p>and help develop those low carbon solutions for them,</p>
<p>and meet the demand that exists, whatever it&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what it is, but again,</p>
<p>Jason Bordoff of Columbia talks about</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a gap between ambition and where we are right now.</p>
<p>We need to be clear eye about where demand is,</p>
<p>where the world is with seven and a half billion people,</p>
<p>going to 9 billion people,</p>
<p>and we need to meet those energy demand needs,</p>
<p>and we need to do it in the most carbon inefficient way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have one last question for Pierre,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m going to open it up to all of you,</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re going to do after I ask my question</p>
<p>and Pierre gives me his thoughts,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to ask you to go to the mics in the room.</p>
<p>I see one right there in the back.</p>
<p>And if you have a question you wanna ask,</p>
<p>I ask that you identify yourself,</p>
<p>what your name is, what program you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>before you go ahead and ask the question,</p>
<p>and everything of course is being recorded.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my last question for you, Pierre.</p>
<p>Chevron is one of the largest backers</p>
<p>of the American Petroleum Institute, or API lobby group,</p>
<p>which has been characterized by some</p>
<p>as obstructing climate change initiatives,</p>
<p>including supporting the rollback of regulations</p>
<p>on methane emissions and lobbying against EV subsidies.</p>
<p>How does Chevron reconcile their commitment</p>
<p>to this low carbon future that you emphasize</p>
<p>with being a member of the API?</p>
<ul>
<li>The API does a lot more than lobbying,</li>
</ul>
<p>it&rsquo;s the standards group for environmental, safety,</p>
<p>methane control,</p>
<p>so it does a bunch of really important work</p>
<p>around our standards.</p>
<p>And it does lobby, it has a climate action program,</p>
<p>and I encourage you to read it, it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Not all climate policy is good policy.</p>
<p>I think reading the Energy Institute&rsquo;s blogs,</p>
<p>there are policies that are supported,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re efficient and effective,</p>
<p>and there are others that are less effective,</p>
<p>less efficient.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be a lower carbon future,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s clear, how we get there,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best policy for that,</p>
<p>is something that I think reasonable people can debate.</p>
<p>And again, every Monday I enjoy reading it,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s really complex.</p>
<p>What are the trade offs on affordability, energy security?</p>
<p>Just this one on Tuesday, &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s Labor Day,</p>
<p>on heat pumps, it sounds like a very simple decision.</p>
<p>And it turns out it&rsquo;s really complex</p>
<p>because of the refrigerants and the greenhouse gas</p>
<p>heating from those refrigerants when it leaks.</p>
<p>And so it takes a lot of smart people</p>
<p>having really healthy discussions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated, we&rsquo;re dealing with externalities,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that economics struggles with.</p>
<p>So we support a price on carbon,</p>
<p>the API supports the price on carbon,</p>
<p>but the reality is most of the policy</p>
<p>is really kind of picking winners and that can work,</p>
<p>but it can also have some unintended consequences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we open the floor to questions.</p>
<p>And please do go back and read,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like you to use the mic</p>
<p>so that those who are viewing this virtually</p>
<p>can hear the questions.</p>
<p>And we also ask that you identify yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, my name is Julia, I&rsquo;m a law student here.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked a lot about reputation,</p>
<p>and the reputation of Chevron and the oil industry,</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s important to your investors</p>
<p>and your financial future.</p>
<p>There was a study published in February of this year</p>
<p>in the journal, Plus One,</p>
<p>which is a very legitimate scientific journal,</p>
<p>that found that Chevron, Exxon, BP, and Shell,</p>
<p>used terms like climate, low-carbon, transition,</p>
<p>to talk about strategies for decarbonization</p>
<p>and how you are making actions on clean energy.</p>
<p>But in fact, you are not making</p>
<p>any of the capital investments on the scale that we need,</p>
<p>according to the IPCC,</p>
<p>and a massive majority of scientists around the globe.</p>
<p>And these scientists concluded that the transition</p>
<p>to clean energy business models</p>
<p>is not occurring since the magnitude of investments</p>
<p>and actions are not matching the discourse.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t really heard anything from you</p>
<p>about actual, tangible actions that are happening.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m kind of wondering, if you&rsquo;re just here to launder</p>
<p>your reputation with this group of esteemed students</p>
<p>who are young and impressionable,</p>
<p>and they might make this transition, like the moderator has,</p>
<p>from questioning, to being bought into this system.</p>
<p>It is 122 degrees in the Central Valley right now,</p>
<p>there are records being broken.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you face your children at the dinner table</p>
<p>every night and tell them</p>
<p>what their future is gonna be like.</p>
<p>I am up every night terrified because of you,</p>
<p>and what you and your comrades are doing for this economy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what purpose you have here</p>
<p>besides to launder your reputation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So is that the question?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is my question, why are you here?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are you here?</p>
<p>And what value is this actually serving</p>
<p>besides to get a bunch of people to buy into this future</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to sell us?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in the shadow of Richmond right now.</p>
<p>And there are health consequences in Richmond</p>
<p>that the black and brown communities are facing</p>
<p>because of pollution in this, I grew up here,</p>
<p>I am from here, Chevron has done nothing for me.</p>
<p>So why are you here?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you for your question, Pierre, please answer that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was invited here and&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Julia] Why were you invited here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please give him a chance to answer the question,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>thank you for your question.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is more investment going into lower carbon</li>
</ul>
<p>than in traditional energy.</p>
<p>If you look at the numbers, it&rsquo;s like 700 billion,</p>
<p>a trillion dollars across the globe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost all going into wind and solar,</p>
<p>some of it&rsquo;s going into like Tesla and EVs.</p>
<p>A lot of the car companies are investing in that.</p>
<p>And traditional oil and gas is 300 to 400 billion globally.</p>
<p>Many experts are concerned</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough investment</p>
<p>going in traditional oil and gas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a crisis in Europe right now where natural gas</p>
<p>is costing 10 times what it is in this country,</p>
<p>where people can&rsquo;t pay their utility bills</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so expensive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s clearly exacerbated</p>
<p>by the Russia-Ukraine conflict,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also tied to an under investment.</p>
<p>And I understand the concerns that you&rsquo;re expressing,</p>
<p>but if we just decrease supply, while demand is still there,</p>
<p>then all we do is make it unaffordable for people.</p>
<p>We can maybe view energy as something that we always have,</p>
<p>but billions of people on this planet</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have access to any energy.</p>
<p>I understand your points of view.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I actually used the word reputation anywhere.</p>
<p>I think I refer to many actions and I won&rsquo;t repeat &rsquo;em all,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re second largest renewable diesel, biodiesel producer.</p>
<p>We talked about, we&rsquo;re doing carbon capture,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re taking real actions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an energy transition, it&rsquo;s not a light switch.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t happen overnight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a massive, I mean the policy support</p>
<p>and the investments that are being made</p>
<p>are absolutely massive, they&rsquo;re unprecedented.</p>
<p>But the size of the energy system is underestimated by many,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s understandable, you can&rsquo;t all be experts on it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m here just to have a healthy discourse.</p>
<p>And I appreciate coming back to my alma mater</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing our part, we really are.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the point from the API,</li>
</ul>
<p>about supporting the API was pretty relevant</p>
<p>to what you just said.</p>
<p>The reason we&rsquo;re in this position</p>
<p>and we have this reliance upon fossil fuels</p>
<p>is because of lobbying that your company has done</p>
<p>for the past 33 years with you involved.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned,</p>
<p>you should be tried for crimes against humanity</p>
<p>at The Hague, thank you very much.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, we are here to have a serious conversation,</p>
<p>so I appreciate, the next, let&rsquo;s hear the next question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yep, hey Pierre, PJ, second year MBA student,</li>
</ul>
<p>also on the BERC executive team.</p>
<p>And I want to ask about your investments in carbon capture.</p>
<p>And I wanna ask because to the point</p>
<p>that the last question made.</p>
<p>We are moving late to prevent a climate crisis.</p>
<p>And a lot of that was because of lobbying done by the API</p>
<p>and effectively Chevron.</p>
<p>And so I do believe that Chevron</p>
<p>has a larger responsibility than almost anyone</p>
<p>to help invest in those types of technologies.</p>
<p>So within carbon capture specifically,</p>
<p>this is multi part.</p>
<p>You mentioned CCS,</p>
<p>and typically that&rsquo;s put on an industrial source</p>
<p>of carbon emissions,</p>
<p>so like a natural gas power plant or an ethanol plant,</p>
<p>and those plants are still emitting net new carbon.</p>
<p>Are you investing in true carbon removal,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re pulling carbon from the atmosphere</p>
<p>and putting it underground?</p>
<p>Second part, when you alluded to the storage of carbon</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing today, is that enhanced oil recovery,</p>
<p>or is that true carbon removal?</p>
<p>And then third, you mentioned, sorry,</p>
<p>I know this is multi part,</p>
<p>third, you said 25 million tons of CO2.</p>
<p>I agree that&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not nearly on the scale that we need.</p>
<p>The National Academy of Science States</p>
<p>that we need to remove 10 gigatons,</p>
<p>10 billion tons annually by 2050.</p>
<p>And I would love to hear your thoughts</p>
<p>on how Chevron is gonna make that happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if you read Bill Gates&rsquo;s book,</li>
</ul>
<p>transportation is the fourth largest source</p>
<p>of greenhouse gases, right?</p>
<p>Industrial, power generation, agricultural land use,</p>
<p>and then transportation.</p>
<p>Turn every single vehicle,</p>
<p>light passenger vehicle on the planet, a billion of them,</p>
<p>turn &rsquo;em electric overnight,</p>
<p>power them all with wind and solar overnight,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve dealt with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big complex world out there.</p>
<p>And to think that coal, by the way is again,</p>
<p>25% of the power grid here, 75% in China and India,</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of people</p>
<p>aspiring to a higher quality of life,</p>
<p>a life that we take for granted,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not available to the vast majority of the people</p>
<p>on this planet.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of demands</p>
<p>that seven and a half billion people,</p>
<p>9 billion people require.</p>
<p>Food, let me just gimme one more data point.</p>
<p>So COVID, in the year 2020,</p>
<p>most of us didn&rsquo;t leave our houses.</p>
<p>Demand for oil, went down 8%.</p>
<p>So that means just supplying, moving essential workers,</p>
<p>essential products, housing us, feeding us, that&rsquo;s oil,</p>
<p>natural gas went down 1%,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause that has other industrial applications.</p>
<p>So we didn&rsquo;t even drive or fly or do anything</p>
<p>and there was barely demand.</p>
<p>So we require a lot of energy to support the system,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re providing that energy.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t accept your premise that we are causing this.</p>
<p>We are providing the energy that&rsquo;s needed today</p>
<p>and we are providing the energy that&rsquo;ll be needed tomorrow.</p>
<p>So on carbon capture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Really quickly, just to jump in,</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that you are causing this,</p>
<p>there is true demand for fossil fuel and you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>we need to help developing nations achieve</p>
<p>poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s absolutely a role for fossil fuel,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re moving very late.</p>
<p>We could have been making this transition 10 years ago</p>
<p>and there was a political discourse in this country</p>
<p>and other places that denied climate change.</p>
<p>And a lot of that was actually funded by the API</p>
<p>and Chevron.</p>
<ul>
<li>So in 1986, I was here, I wrote a paper on climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Climate change has been well known for 100 years</p>
<p>and the science has been,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve never challenged the science.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t accept that.</p>
<p>Let me answer your specific questions on carbon cap,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s not for UOR.</p>
<p>Our project in Australia is taking CO2</p>
<p>and putting it in the ground.</p>
<p>Removing it from the atmosphere,</p>
<p>well, it gets into the atmosphere from emissions.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see the distinction between direct air capture,</p>
<p>we are doing some stuff in direct air capture.</p>
<p>The challenge is when you&rsquo;re trying to remove 400 PPM</p>
<p>versus 10%, it&rsquo;s very dilute.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d rather go after the 10% concentration emissions</p>
<p>than the dilute 400 billion, 400 PPM</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the general atmosphere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s room for both.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s technology that can do it,</p>
<p>absolutely we&rsquo;re gonna do it.</p>
<p>Did I miss one of your questions?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[PJ] I asked about the scale of CCS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scale, yeah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, 25 million tons would more than offset ours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the size of the state of New York,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just one company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take a lot of smart people, a lot of you,</p>
<p>we talked about the climate solutions,</p>
<p>new program that a CAL&rsquo;s gonna do,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the climate school of Columbia.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s gonna take a lot of smart people</p>
<p>working together to figure this out</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing our part.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for your question, there&rsquo;s a lot of questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of you wanna ask questions.</p>
<p>So maybe you could try to make one question</p>
<p>so that the others behind you</p>
<p>get to ask their questions too,</p>
<p>and please identify yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, thank you so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is (indistinct) from the MBA program</p>
<p>at Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>So I come from the conventional energy industry.</p>
<p>So I was a program engineer</p>
<p>and project engineer for Schlumberger.</p>
<p>So we have worked with the clients such as Chevron.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;d like to correct from the previous answer</p>
<p>in India, the coal,</p>
<p>it has been bought down from 75 to 55% right now.</p>
<p>So just wanted to point that out.</p>
<p>But my question is even Schlumberger,</p>
<p>as a traditional oil service provider company,</p>
<p>we have struggled with the transformation,</p>
<p>I think COVID has done some good steps in helping push</p>
<p>that on a faster track.</p>
<p>But as a service provider,</p>
<p>one of the struggles we face is that ultimately</p>
<p>any technology we pour our R&amp;D money into,</p>
<p>we need client companies such as Chevron, BP, et cetera,</p>
<p>to actually be willing to purchase</p>
<p>and invest in those areas.</p>
<p>And that is one growth area within Schlumberger,</p>
<p>we have seen takeoff slower</p>
<p>than what we would&rsquo;ve anticipated or liked</p>
<p>or what is necessary to meet the climate goals.</p>
<p>And I think some of the challenge comes from how you told</p>
<p>we need to convince our shareholders</p>
<p>for going for lower carbon energy.</p>
<p>And you mentioned that you guys are still figuring it out,</p>
<p>but I wanted to understand if there are any concrete plans</p>
<p>that you have to convince the shareholders</p>
<p>that this is the direction we need to move into.</p>
<p>Because I, for one, really understand</p>
<p>how big a role demand plays in having the transition happen</p>
<p>at a certain pace.</p>
<p>But what are some of the solid plans</p>
<p>that Chevron has in mind to convince the shareholders</p>
<p>about how we need to really pick up pace on this transition?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, thanks for your question.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I thought that number was current, but.</p>
<p>I think Anne said, everybody is working on this.</p>
<p>Last year, right around this time,</p>
<p>we did a full energy transition spotlight.</p>
<p>We only talked about our energy transition strategy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that is really essential</p>
<p>to winning back investors.</p>
<p>So, I think the investors that have left energy in part</p>
<p>have said, well, we don&rsquo;t understand how you participate</p>
<p>in a lower carbon future.</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t wanna repeat all the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve already said to Anne,</p>
<p>but I think there are a lot of very specific actions</p>
<p>that reflect all the engineering capability.</p>
<p>We partner with Schlumberger on lots of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take a lot of talent, a lot of companies,</p>
<p>a lot of solutions.</p>
<p>If it was easy, it would&rsquo;ve been done,</p>
<p>and wind and solar has worked really well.</p>
<p>Again, the scale is just massive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the power system is so big,</p>
<p>it takes that kind of investment.</p>
<p>And then that doesn&rsquo;t really deal</p>
<p>with the other parts of the economy</p>
<p>that cannot be electrified, steel making, cement making,</p>
<p>off-road transport, like farm equipment,</p>
<p>mining equipment.</p>
<p>Think of all the mining that&rsquo;ll have to happen</p>
<p>for all the EVs.</p>
<p>Well, how do you do all that?</p>
<p>Cement manufacturing, concrete, food production,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these other aspects of our modern lives</p>
<p>that require energy and many can&rsquo;t be electrified,</p>
<p>and will require other solutions.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re working on the solutions</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re making progress.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going as fast as we can.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re one company working with many others.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you. - Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey, my name&rsquo;s Ethan Miller.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a law student here at Berkeley</p>
<p>focusing on energy and environmental law.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also the co-president</p>
<p>of the Energy and Resource Collaborative Here.</p>
<p>A note on that, I just wanna point out green hydrogen</p>
<p>does work for a majority of the applications</p>
<p>you just talked about, and Europe&rsquo;s really focused on that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to hear more about that maybe at a later point.</p>
<p>But my question is from a legal perspective,</p>
<p>do you think Chevron has a responsibility</p>
<p>to pay reparations for some of its past actions?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to elaborate on why.</p>
<ul>
<li>No, no, I mean again, we all consume all these products.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we&rsquo;re gonna pay, then everyone has to pay,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s essential to modern life.</p>
<p>And on green hydrogen,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re absolutely working on green hydrogen.</p>
<p>Again, I said, if you turned a billion cars to EV overnight</p>
<p>and electrified &rsquo;em all overnight,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t have that scale today,</p>
<p>you still have 90% of it.</p>
<p>So can we all claim all the wind, solar</p>
<p>just to make green hydrogen, which you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>hydrogen can work for a lot of these heavy duty solutions,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re in it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s only also so much wind and solar.</p>
<p>So again, the scale of this is a big challenge,</p>
<p>but again, it&rsquo;s also an opportunity as Anne said,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna take all kinds of smart people</p>
<p>working together in companies and capital</p>
<p>and the Energy Institute here,</p>
<p>all working together to solve this.</p>
<p>And we are making progress,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want this sense that we&rsquo;re not making progress.</p>
<p>I disagree with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a massive system and energy demand keeps growing</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re trying to make this transition.</p>
<ul>
<li>I appreciate that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I understand you don&rsquo;t think you should pay reparations,</p>
<p>the courts might have a different view.</p>
<p>There was a 200 billion settlement</p>
<p>for the tobacco industry in the &rsquo;90s</p>
<p>following years of resistance from tobacco companies</p>
<p>and different courts as well.</p>
<p>Are you factoring that into your finances as the CFO</p>
<p>in case there is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of litigation going on right now</p>
<p>that could lead to large settlements,</p>
<p>is that something you&rsquo;re considering?</p>
<ul>
<li>We feel the cases are without merit</li>
</ul>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll just see where they progress.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you. - Thank you.</p>

<p>We only have about four minutes left.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So to give the students a chance to</p>
<p>express their question,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s try to keep the question brief</p>
<p>after you identify yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be short.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi, my name is (indistinct),</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a first year MBA student here.</p>
<p>In my previous job, I worked as a ESG due diligence advisor,</p>
<p>helping a lot of the PE firms performing, you know,</p>
<p>analysis on recent opportunities</p>
<p>within the mergers and acquisition market.</p>
<p>And as we can see, like there&rsquo;s a lot of shift</p>
<p>from the LPs that are focusing more on ESG topics,</p>
<p>but very unfortunately in the past six months,</p>
<p>you can clearly see a shift downward,</p>
<p>turning away from ESG topics</p>
<p>and labeling them as greenwashing.</p>
<p>And a lot of the bad words to it.</p>
<p>From my perspective,</p>
<p>I think all of those topics are really good and important,</p>
<p>but I can also see optically that is greenwashing topics.</p>
<p>So before we can prove that ESG topics,</p>
<p>especially environmental sustainability topics,</p>
<p>can be good for rate of return,</p>
<p>and then all those like profit.</p>
<p>What would you recommend on persuading businesses</p>
<p>in terms of like shifting towards</p>
<p>a more sustainability focused method of performing</p>
<p>and operating?</p>
<ul>
<li>So I think I said earlier to one of Anne&rsquo;s questions,</li>
</ul>
<p>ESG is a good thing, I mean, we all want to</p>
<p>save for retirement and make society better.</p>
<p>I think the moderation in ESG, I think ESG is a mega trend,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna continue to grow.</p>
<p>It has moderated a little bit.</p>
<p>If you look to Larry Fink of BlackRock,</p>
<p>because it was putting in his words too much pressure</p>
<p>on the most responsible companies to decrease supply</p>
<p>while the demand was still growing.</p>
<p>And that creates a different dislocation in society.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t heat your home, if you can&rsquo;t get food,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t, you know, all the things,</p>
<p>energy is so essential.</p>
<p>And so again, this transition has to be managed,</p>
<p>where supply demand move in sync.</p>
<p>And I think the ESG moderation that you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>is just saying, well, maybe we went a little too far,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still very strong</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a top priority for investors and we support it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>We should advance all kinds of</p>
<p>environmental, social and governance goals.</p>
<p>And we can do that while fulfilling</p>
<p>our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders,</p>
<p>who are again, you know,</p>
<p>everyday people trying to save for retirement.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, my name&rsquo;s Charlie, I&rsquo;m a student here,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m also working on a clean tech startup.</p>
<p>And I wanna ask you about low-carbon fuel standard programs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re essentially a market based pricing scheme on carbon.</p>
<p>How has these programs in California and Washington</p>
<p>affected Chevron&rsquo;s business model?</p>
<p>And do you foresee like a national low-carbon fuel standard</p>
<p>program being developed?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m trying to be short in my answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, we operate in California,</p>
<p>we have the refinery in Richmond and down in LA,</p>
<p>we were part of the original greenhouse gas regulations</p>
<p>that Governor Schwarzenegger did.</p>
<p>We were part of bringing a coalition of moderate Democrats</p>
<p>and moderate Republicans to the extension of it</p>
<p>when Governor Brown extended LCFS and cap and trade</p>
<p>and all that, and we bought Renewable Energy Group</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part of providing lower carbon fuels.</p>
<p>The state of Washington has done it,</p>
<p>the federal government has not,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something called the Renewable Fuel Standard,</p>
<p>which is primarily around ethanol,</p>
<p>but does have other encouragement,</p>
<p>other support, and the Inflation Reduction Act,</p>
<p>which Anne talked about, has made it so like,</p>
<p>sustainably, aviation fuel,</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t really included in that,</p>
<p>and the blender&rsquo;s tax credit is down there.</p>
<p>So there is a lot of policy support in this space.</p>
<p>We absolutely can operate.</p>
<p>And again, in a state like California, that leads</p>
<p>on greenhouse gas regulations.</p>
<p>And Governor Brown was very clear,</p>
<p>California is 1% of greenhouse gas emissions,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna solve climate change,</p>
<p>but we can show with policy and technology,</p>
<p>the rest of the world, how to innovate,</p>
<p>and LCFS was one of it, California was the first,</p>
<p>and we operate in the environment</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done fine in the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you think it&rsquo;s led to any specific,</li>
</ul>
<p>like operational changes for Chevron?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it&rsquo;s led to what it was designed to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;re having carb, you&rsquo;re having Mary on,</p>
<p>I saw as a future, a good question for her,</p>
<p>but absolutely the carbon intensity of the fuels</p>
<p>that you consume here in California</p>
<p>is lower as a result of that.</p>
<p>Let me talk about sustainable aviation fuel, right?</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s a 100% conventional.</p>
<p>The European spec, the US doesn&rsquo;t have a spec.</p>
<p>The first spec is 98/2, 98% conventional, 2% renewable.</p>
<p>Then 2025 is 95/5, 2 30 is 90/10, even 2050, it&rsquo;s 50/50.</p>
<p>So it is a transition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good analog on how you slowly kind of reduce carbon</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d like to do it faster,</p>
<p>there just aren&rsquo;t solutions that can go faster</p>
<p>at this point in time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re actually almost out of time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So this&rsquo;ll be the last question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi, my name is Alfredo Angulo.</p>
<p>I am a fourth year political science major.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a lifelong resident of Richmond,</p>
<p>where you have the second largest refinery</p>
<p>in the state of California,</p>
<p>as well as the second largest polluter</p>
<p>in the state of California.</p>
<p>The city of Richmond is one that experiences</p>
<p>amongst the worst rates of respiratory illnesses</p>
<p>in the nation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s largely attributed by scientists</p>
<p>to the existence of the Chevron refinery in Richmond,</p>
<p>and 100 years of fossil fuel operations in the city.</p>
<p>A couple years ago,</p>
<p>the Bay Area Air Quality Management District</p>
<p>passed a regulation called rule 65,</p>
<p>which required the refinery to largely reduce</p>
<p>particulate matter emissions by using technology</p>
<p>that has already been widely adopted by many refineries</p>
<p>on the West Coast.</p>
<p>And the Chevron Corporation sued the Air District</p>
<p>to block this regulation from taking place.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned a couple times that one of your goals</p>
<p>is higher returns, lower carbon,</p>
<p>and this was a great opportunity</p>
<p>for the refinery to immediately,</p>
<p>or at least very quickly reduce carbon emissions</p>
<p>here at home.</p>
<p>And you guys fought that regulation.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t want to reduce carbon emissions</p>
<p>here at home, where is it that you want to do so?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I don&rsquo;t accept your premise</li>
</ul>
<p>that Richmond causes those incidents.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s lots of other industrial activity.</p>
<p>We are heavily regulated.</p>
<p>Every air emission is closely monitored</p>
<p>and we comply with all of the standards.</p>
<p>The very specifics of that is a technical question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s again, it&rsquo;s not around carbon, it&rsquo;s around particulate,</p>
<p>as you say, but it was really a mandated,</p>
<p>way, more expensive solution.</p>
<p>It goes back to you want to do this economically,</p>
<p>and we totally support reducing particulates,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t support necessarily being told how to do it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll see what the courts determine.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been in Richmond a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there many times.</p>
<p>Where we are a constructive investor in that community.</p>
<p>United Way has got big facilities in there that help out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a big taxpayer,</p>
<p>we do our part to make that community better.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t accept your premise,</p>
<p>but thanks for your question.</p>
<ul>
<li>So we are out of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has been, I think the most dynamic</p>
<p>Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series that I have seen possibly</p>
<p>since I became dean four years ago.</p>
<p>So I wanna thank Pierre for his time today,</p>
<p>for voluntarily coming out here,</p>
<p>and for sharing his experience with the Haas students</p>
<p>and the community.</p>
<p>Students, we look forward to a sustainable future,</p>
<p>we need to think big.</p>
<p>Working on the biggest challenges,</p>
<p>with the biggest companies,</p>
<p>creating the biggest transformations.</p>
<p>We need your courage to engage</p>
<p>in this kind of transformational change</p>
<p>that will save our planet.</p>
<p>So on that note, I think we should all give Pierre</p>
<p>a big round of applause.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
