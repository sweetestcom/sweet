    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Casey Halpern.</p>
<p>Dr. Halpern is the Chief of Neurosurgery</p>
<p>at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.</p>
<p>His laboratory focuses on bulimia, binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>and other forms of obsessive compulsive behaviors.</p>
<p>Normally, when we hear about eating disorders</p>
<p>or obsessive compulsive disorders of other kinds,</p>
<p>the conversation quickly migrates</p>
<p>to pharmacologic interventions</p>
<p>and serotonin or dopamine or talk therapy interventions,</p>
<p>many of which can be effective.</p>
<p>The Halpern Laboratory, however,</p>
<p>takes an entirely different approach.</p>
<p>While they embrace pharmacologic</p>
<p>and behavioral and talk therapy interventions,</p>
<p>their main focus is the development and application</p>
<p>of engineered devices to go directly into the brain</p>
<p>and stimulate the neurons,</p>
<p>the nerve cells that generate compulsions</p>
<p>that cause people to want to eat more</p>
<p>even when their stomach is full.</p>
<p>In other words, they do brain surgery of various kinds,</p>
<p>sometimes removing small bits of brain,</p>
<p>sometimes stimulating small bits of brain</p>
<p>with electrical current,</p>
<p>and even stimulating the brain through the intact skull,</p>
<p>that is without having to drill down beneath the skull</p>
<p>in order to alleviate</p>
<p>and indeed sometimes cure these conditions.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s discussion with Dr. Halpern</p>
<p>was an absolutely fascinating one for me</p>
<p>because it represents the leading edge</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening in modification of brain circuits</p>
<p>and the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disease.</p>
<p>For instance, they just recently published a paper</p>
<p>in Nature Medicine,</p>
<p>one of the premier journals out there,</p>
<p>entitled,</p>
<p>Pilot Study of Responsive Nucleus Accumbens</p>
<p>Deep Brain Stimulation for Loss of Control Eating.</p>
<p>The nucleus accumbens is an area of our brains</p>
<p>that we all have.</p>
<p>In fact, we have two of them,</p>
<p>one on each side of the brain</p>
<p>that is intimately involved in the release of dopamine</p>
<p>for particular motivated behaviors.</p>
<p>And while most often we think about dopamine</p>
<p>for the release of behaviors that we want to engage in,</p>
<p>in this context,</p>
<p>they are using stimulation</p>
<p>and control of neuronal activity in nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>to control loss of control eating,</p>
<p>something that when people suffer from it,</p>
<p>despite knowing that they shouldn&rsquo;t eat,</p>
<p>despite not even wanting to eat,</p>
<p>they find themselves eating.</p>
<p>So again, this represents really the leading edge</p>
<p>of where neuroscience is going,</p>
<p>and it certainly is going to be an area of neuroscience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to expand in the years to come.</p>
<p>And Dr. Halpern and the members of his laboratory</p>
<p>are among a very small group of scientists in the world</p>
<p>that are using the types of approaches</p>
<p>that I described a minute ago,</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re going to hear more about in today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>in order to resolve some of the most difficult</p>
<p>and debilitating human conditions.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>you will also learn about the use of deep brain stimulation</p>
<p>and other approaches</p>
<p>for the treatment of movement disorders,</p>
<p>such as essential tremor, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>and various types of dystonias,</p>
<p>which are challenges in generating</p>
<p>particular types of movement.</p>
<p>So whether or not you or somebody that you know</p>
<p>suffers from an eating disorder,</p>
<p>from obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>or from a movement disorder,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode is sure to teach you</p>
<p>not only about what&rsquo;s happening in those arenas,</p>
<p>but also in the arenas of neuroscience generally.</p>
<p>In fact, I would say today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>is especially important for anyone that wants to understand</p>
<p>how the brain works</p>
<p>and what the future of brain modification</p>
<p>really looks like for all of us.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>are critical to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Casey Halpern.</p>
<p>Casey, I should say, Dr. Halpern, for those listening.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Great to be here.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>We were colleagues at Stanford,</p>
<p>and then recently you moved, of course,</p>
<p>to University of Pennsylvania,</p>
<p>also an incredible institution.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sorry to lose you.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>It was bittersweet for me too.</p>
<p>Stanford&rsquo;s loss is UPenn&rsquo;s gain,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about your work.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve been a neurosurgeon in the past and present.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve told the listeners already,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>which I consider the astronauts of neuroscience,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re in somewhat uncharted territory,</p>
<p>or very uncharted territory,</p>
<p>and yet precision is everything, right?</p>
<p>The margins of error are very, very small.</p>
<p>So, for those that aren&rsquo;t familiar</p>
<p>with the differences between neurosurgery,</p>
<p>neurology, psychiatry,</p>
<p>you could just educate us a bit.</p>
<p>What does a neurosurgeon do,</p>
<p>and what does the fact that you&rsquo;re a neurosurgeon</p>
<p>do for your view of the brain?</p>
<p>How do you think about and conceptualize the brain?</p>
<p>Yeah, the scope of neurosurgery is quite broad.</p>
<p>When I was in medical school,</p>
<p>I was drawn to neurosurgery</p>
<p>because of a procedure known as deep brain stimulation.</p>
<p>When I was at Penn as a college student,</p>
<p>I actually watched my first</p>
<p>deep brain stimulation surgery performed by Gordon Baltuck,</p>
<p>who to date is one of my career mentors.</p>
<p>Deep brain stimulation is one surgery</p>
<p>that neurosurgeons offer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually sort of a very small minority</p>
<p>of what neurosurgery does.</p>
<p>You know, we take out brain tumors,</p>
<p>we clip aneurysms in the brain,</p>
<p>we take care of patients</p>
<p>that have had traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>concussion, spine surgeries,</p>
<p>90% of what neurosurgeons do around the country,</p>
<p>taking care of herniated discs and lumbar fusions.</p>
<p>So the scope is the entire central nervous system,</p>
<p>including the peripheral nervous system.</p>
<p>We take care of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome</p>
<p>and nerve disorders.</p>
<p>Now over the course of the past two decades or so,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a mission in the field to subspecialize.</p>
<p>And so historically neurosurgeons</p>
<p>did everything in that domain,</p>
<p>but now we subspecialize</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m lucky to be at Penn Medicine</p>
<p>where we can focus on one of these areas.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m Chief of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery.</p>
<p>All I do is deep brain stimulation surgery.</p>
<p>And a compliment to that is focus ultrasound</p>
<p>or transcranial focus ultrasound,</p>
<p>which is a non-invasive way to do an ablation in the brain,</p>
<p>recently FDA approved.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s FDA approved for tremor at the moment.</p>
<p>These two procedures are for me, my every day,</p>
<p>but still the minority of what neurosurgeons have to offer.</p>
<p>The majority of neurosurgery in my mind</p>
<p>is a bit more structural than it is physiology</p>
<p>or deeply rooted in how the brain functions.</p>
<p>When we take out a brain tumor,</p>
<p>we have to find a safe trajectory to get to the brain tumor</p>
<p>and then we remove it</p>
<p>and we help the patient recover in the ICU.</p>
<p>Similar to a brain aneurysm,</p>
<p>often we don&rsquo;t have to go into the brain</p>
<p>to clip a brain aneurysm,</p>
<p>but we go around the brain or under the brain to get there.</p>
<p>And in my mind, those surgeries are a bit more structural.</p>
<p>Deep brain stimulation, the surgery that I do routinely</p>
<p>is a procedure where yes, there is structure involved.</p>
<p>Of course, we have to place a very thin wire</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s insulated deep into a part of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, for example.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s actually not the therapy.</p>
<p>The therapy is delivering electrical stimulation</p>
<p>through the tip of that wire or one of the tips</p>
<p>as there actually are multiple contacts</p>
<p>at the bottom of the wire.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very small.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all done out of the operating room.</p>
<p>This stimulation wire is connected to a battery pack</p>
<p>or a pulse generator that&rsquo;s kind of like a pacemaker.</p>
<p>And so we deliver this therapy and I always tell patients,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit more like I have to implant a tool</p>
<p>to deliver you a medication,</p>
<p>but that medication is gonna be in the form of electricity</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be delivered</p>
<p>into a very small region of the brain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that procedure that&rsquo;s inspired me</p>
<p>to not just become a neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>but has really defined the focus</p>
<p>of my research laboratory as well.</p>
<p>Maybe by way of antidote,</p>
<p>you could tell us one of the more outrageous</p>
<p>or surprising or who knows delightful and thrilling things</p>
<p>about the brain that you&rsquo;ve observed</p>
<p>as a consequence of stimulating different brain areas.</p>
<p>You know, in textbooks,</p>
<p>we always hear about the kind of dark stuff,</p>
<p>you know, stimulate one brain area,</p>
<p>somebody goes into a rage, stimulate another brain area,</p>
<p>person starts laughing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>First of all, given that some of the information,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hope not much,</p>
<p>but some of the information in textbooks is incorrect.</p>
<p>Are those sorts of statements true?</p>
<p>Can one observe those in the clinic?</p>
<p>And what are some of the more interesting</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean entertaining,</p>
<p>but surprising things that you&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve poked around in the brain,</p>
<p>deliberately of course.</p>
<p>And what have you seen?</p>
<p>What have you heard?</p>
<p>I have to say, I am amazed by these effects every day.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m very privileged to be able to interact</p>
<p>with the human brain in this way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always with the goal of trying to provide somebody</p>
<p>with a meaningful therapy.</p>
<p>But when we deliver electrical stimulation,</p>
<p>you know, these electrodes,</p>
<p>while they might be sitting</p>
<p>in a very small region of the brain,</p>
<p>there are regions within a few millimeters</p>
<p>of where these electrodes are</p>
<p>that if stimulated could cause a temporary,</p>
<p>a very brief side effect,</p>
<p>a moment of laughter, like you said,</p>
<p>or a moment of panic.</p>
<p>And of course we can just shut that electrode off,</p>
<p>but often these side effects could be therapeutic.</p>
<p>And actually that&rsquo;s how we have discovered ways</p>
<p>to use deep brain stimulation,</p>
<p>not just for movement disorders like Parkinson&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>but for example, patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>that have a psychiatric comorbidity like depression</p>
<p>or obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>A lot of these patients are highly compulsive and impulsive.</p>
<p>Sometimes these problems actually melt away</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to help their tremor,</p>
<p>but the patients also tell us</p>
<p>that their gambling issue has gotten better</p>
<p>or their mood has improved.</p>
<p>And why is that?</p>
<p>Well, you know, there&rsquo;s probably more than one reason.</p>
<p>You know, you can help somebody&rsquo;s mood</p>
<p>by making their tremor go away, of course,</p>
<p>but we see laughter in the clinic sometimes.</p>
<p>And why is that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re stimulating parts of the brain</p>
<p>that are not just involved in these motor circuits,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also involved in what we call a limbic circuit</p>
<p>or part of the brain involved in emotion.</p>
<p>And if we learn how to modulate those areas therapeutically,</p>
<p>step-by-step, we can actually develop these therapies</p>
<p>for other indications like depression.</p>
<p>I would say the most impressive and consistent effect</p>
<p>we have when we have a patient with tremor</p>
<p>who has been tremoring for the past 20 years,</p>
<p>if we can deliver stimulation through that electrode</p>
<p>in the clinic, we have immediate relief of tremor.</p>
<p>And that is the effect that inspired me</p>
<p>to be a neurosurgeon when I was in college.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really wanted to do anything else</p>
<p>except help develop that type of therapeutic</p>
<p>for another kind of symptom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in obesity and related eating disorders,</p>
<p>compulsive behavior, the urge to have something</p>
<p>that might be delicious, but dangerous,</p>
<p>or unhealthy, or a drug,</p>
<p>or a compulsion like we see in OCD</p>
<p>or obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>Interestingly, like we see tremor melt away</p>
<p>when we deliver electricity to a certain part of the brain,</p>
<p>we can see these psychiatric, more psychiatric problems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not all psychiatric disorders,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say disorders of the brain.</p>
<p>We can see symptoms of those disorders also improve</p>
<p>and often immediately, just like we do with tremor.</p>
<p>So I see it all the time.</p>
<p>To pick out one would be a challenge</p>
<p>because for me, this is my every day.</p>
<p>The speed of the relief that you described for tremor</p>
<p>is really incredible.</p>
<p>Just thinking about drug therapies,</p>
<p>and there too, there are side effects,</p>
<p>but there are still a lot of mysteries as to, for instance,</p>
<p>why SSRIs even work when they work.</p>
<p>The timing is always a challenge.</p>
<p>Timing, dosage, yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to learn more from you about OCD.</p>
<p>I have several reasons for asking this.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m a somewhat obsessive person.</p>
<p>I tend to be very narrowly focused,</p>
<p>although I confess it&rsquo;s not a step function.</p>
<p>It takes me some time to turn off the chatter,</p>
<p>but once I&rsquo;m into a thought train or a mode</p>
<p>of being and thinking and work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard for me to exit that mode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a deep trench.</p>
<p>Adaptive in some circumstances, less adaptive</p>
<p>in others, as you know.</p>
<p>The other is that when I was a kid,</p>
<p>I had a little bit of a grunting tick.</p>
<p>I used to, I had this intense, intense desire</p>
<p>to clear my throat to the point where my dad said,</p>
<p>look, you need to stop that.</p>
<p>And he used to squeeze my hand every time I&rsquo;d do it.</p>
<p>And I used to hide in the backseat of the car</p>
<p>or in the closet to do it</p>
<p>because it provided so much relief.</p>
<p>And then it eventually passed.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t medicated.</p>
<p>They never did anything about it.</p>
<p>Every once in a while now, if I&rsquo;m very fatigued,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve been working a lot, I notice it starts to come back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do this kind of grunting.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been sort of like a pet neurological symptom</p>
<p>for me that reminds me that these circuits exist</p>
<p>in all of us and that sometimes they go haywire</p>
<p>and sometimes they just have subtle over-excitation</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>And then the third reason is that I get thousands</p>
<p>of questions about OCD.</p>
<p>Could you perhaps just tell us what is OCD?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What are some brain areas involved?</p>
<p>What are the current range of treatments?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the difference between someone who is obsessive</p>
<p>and somebody who has true OCD?</p>
<p>So a brief disclosure, as a neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>I do take care of patients</p>
<p>with severe obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>But my perspective on OCD may be a little bit different</p>
<p>than a psychiatrist who lives and breathes OCD</p>
<p>and sees patients every single day with OCD.</p>
<p>I probably take care of three to five patients a year</p>
<p>with deep brain stimulation</p>
<p>for obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see these patients as routinely,</p>
<p>but my laboratory is geared as a researcher.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very focused on trying to improve outcomes</p>
<p>of deep brain stimulation for OCD.</p>
<p>So I do feel I have expertise and a perspective to share,</p>
<p>but just a brief disclosure.</p>
<p>I do feel that as a neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>I am obligated to better understand</p>
<p>where the obsessions in the brain come from</p>
<p>and how we can interrupt them to stop the compulsion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with the obsession,</p>
<p>sort of the intrinsic most feature of OCD,</p>
<p>better than we&rsquo;re actually doing it.</p>
<p>For example, if we were to offer a patient</p>
<p>with tremor deep brain stimulation surgery,</p>
<p>of course there&rsquo;s some risk to the procedure,</p>
<p>but the outcome is so consistent and positive</p>
<p>that many patients are willing to take on that risk.</p>
<p>For obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>the surgery risk is about the same.</p>
<p>However, the benefit is not quite as robust.</p>
<p>And so a lot of patients and their referring psychiatrists</p>
<p>are reluctant to refer these patients to us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely understandable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been leading an endeavor</p>
<p>with a number of collaborators around the country</p>
<p>to try to better understand these circuits in the brain,</p>
<p>study them in humans, both invasively and non-invasively.</p>
<p>That would be with an electrode-based surgery,</p>
<p>sort of like we do in epilepsy</p>
<p>to understand where seizures come from.</p>
<p>We wanna understand better where obsessions come from,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also working with imaging experts and geneticists</p>
<p>to understand OCD at a broader level as well.</p>
<p>I consider OCD to be a spectrum disorder in a way.</p>
<p>And I apologize to those who might feel</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m using that term incorrectly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using it in a way to describe patients</p>
<p>that have obsessions and even some related compulsions</p>
<p>might not meet criteria for OCD.</p>
<p>It may be something, Andrew, that you have.</p>
<p>As a neurosurgeon, I&rsquo;m really obsessive about safety</p>
<p>and compulsive about my surgical procedures.</p>
<p>So I think that some aspect of OCD,</p>
<p>which we often joke about, but we should consider seriously</p>
<p>because people do suffer from this,</p>
<p>some aspect of it helps us.</p>
<p>There are famous CEOs that probably have some level of OCD,</p>
<p>surgeons and scientists alike.</p>
<p>So perhaps if it can be controlled, it&rsquo;s an asset.</p>
<p>But if it goes awry and is uncontrollable,</p>
<p>then it becomes obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>And I tend to see the patients that are the most severe.</p>
<p>So they have failed medication</p>
<p>and there are multiple medications</p>
<p>that are worth trying for OCD.</p>
<p>Some can actually be very helpful.</p>
<p>Which neurotransmitter systems do they tend to poke at?</p>
<p>Well, SSRIs are sort of the first line for OCD,</p>
<p>but also tricyclics can be helpful.</p>
<p>So this is still the serotonin system.</p>
<p>But as we know, the serotonin system interacts</p>
<p>with the neurodrenergic system and the dopamine system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to be specific to one of these things.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s also why it&rsquo;s hard for us</p>
<p>to predict how these medications are going to work</p>
<p>for these kinds of patients.</p>
<p>But tricyclics and SSRIs can be very helpful</p>
<p>and are definitely first line.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s others.</p>
<p>Exposure response prevention</p>
<p>is probably the most effective option,</p>
<p>which is kind of like cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>but these are different and offered by psychologists.</p>
<p>And this is a whole field.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a field or I should say a whole clinic</p>
<p>at my institution focused,</p>
<p>it was started by Edna Foa at Penn,</p>
<p>who this is what they do for these patients,</p>
<p>is offer these types of cognitive therapies,</p>
<p>exposure to the stressor</p>
<p>and to try to get patients to habituate</p>
<p>to whatever it is that stresses them</p>
<p>and causes these compulsions</p>
<p>to help these patients live in every day and function.</p>
<p>These are all fabulously helpful therapies</p>
<p>for a variety of patients,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still about 30% of patients</p>
<p>that still suffer from OCD.</p>
<p>And some of them have severe OCD.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s moderate to severe.</p>
<p>And those are the patients</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m really motivated to try to help.</p>
<p>Our therapies for those patients right now,</p>
<p>I would say are worth pursuing, but not optimal.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>that we have to balance as a researcher,</p>
<p>because when you see patients like this,</p>
<p>you wanna do everything you can to help them.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important to educate patients</p>
<p>on the risks and benefits of them.</p>
<p>This is deep brain stimulation surgery,</p>
<p>but also capsulotomy,</p>
<p>which is more of an ablation approach,</p>
<p>a little bit like deep brain stimulation,</p>
<p>but rather than delivering stimulation through an electrode,</p>
<p>you can actually heat the tissue</p>
<p>and even destroy it.</p>
<p>Some would say this part of the brain</p>
<p>is very safe to destroy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like an appendix.</p>
<p>Others would say it&rsquo;s safer to modulate.</p>
<p>I have seen patients do very well with these ablations.</p>
<p>And so, you asked me earlier</p>
<p>what I find so amazing about the brain,</p>
<p>these effects that we can have.</p>
<p>Sometimes the lack of effect is what&rsquo;s so amazing.</p>
<p>You can actually traverse parts of the brain</p>
<p>without having any adverse effects</p>
<p>on patients&rsquo; function, at least that you can test.</p>
<p>But you can also destroy small parts of the brain.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking three or four millimeters in size.</p>
<p>These little ablations can be really helpful for patients,</p>
<p>but have no obvious side effects that we can tell,</p>
<p>perhaps after a short recovery from surgery.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, despite how safe they might be,</p>
<p>these surgical procedures still are surgical procedures,</p>
<p>and patients are hesitant to proceed,</p>
<p>especially when they know that their chance</p>
<p>of a transformative effect is quite low.</p>
<p>We can generally achieve a responder rate of about 50%.</p>
<p>And responders still have symptomatic OCD.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m really sort of inspired</p>
<p>to really find a way to deliver these therapies</p>
<p>in a more disease-specific or symptom-specific way.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re years away, probably, from that therapy,</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s all part of a research study at the moment.</p>
<p>What brain areas should I think about</p>
<p>when I think about OCD?</p>
<p>Years ago, I remember opening a textbook,</p>
<p>I think I was an undergraduate still,</p>
<p>and work from Judith Rappaport</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health,</p>
<p>this would be late 80s, early 90s,</p>
<p>had done some neuroimaging,</p>
<p>or maybe it was PET, or some other imaging technique,</p>
<p>and had identified portions of the basal ganglia,</p>
<p>caudate-putanum-type structures in OCD,</p>
<p>and maybe some differences in boys versus girls.</p>
<p>So, what brain areas,</p>
<p>are there sex differences in terms of OCD?</p>
<p>And were one to come into your clinic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for this sort of work of ablations or stimulation,</p>
<p>where would you first start to probe in the brain?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a disorder of both cortex</p>
<p>and the subcortex.</p>
<p>The cortical control areas,</p>
<p>areas that are involved in inhibitory control,</p>
<p>we have found to not function properly</p>
<p>in patients with OCD.</p>
<p>So, areas like the obrofrontal cortex</p>
<p>and the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>If you image these areas,</p>
<p>or study them even in a rodent model of OCD,</p>
<p>which quite honestly, these models,</p>
<p>they model aspects of OCD,</p>
<p>but OCD is a human condition.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really model this whole condition</p>
<p>in a mouse or a rat,</p>
<p>but perhaps you can model compulsive behavior in a rat.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Pulling out their hair.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>but that is compulsive behavior.</p>
<p>And perhaps if you can ameliorate that in a rat,</p>
<p>that might be helpful for a patient with OCD,</p>
<p>but we have to approach animal modeling of OCD thoughtfully.</p>
<p>And most scientists do, I think.</p>
<p>And when we study OCD in models</p>
<p>or in humans with imaging,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to do it invasively with electrodes</p>
<p>like we do in epilepsy patients,</p>
<p>we find that areas in the cortex,</p>
<p>like the prefrontal and obronofrontal cortex,</p>
<p>are not functioning the way they would</p>
<p>in a non-OCD patient.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often hyper-functioning,</p>
<p>such that while you might say,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re hyper-functioning,</p>
<p>so aren&rsquo;t these patients functioning better?</p>
<p>Hyper-focused.</p>
<p>Yeah, hyper-focused, exactly.</p>
<p>No, I would say it&rsquo;s not so much an up or a down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more that they&rsquo;re just dysfunctional.</p>
<p>And we need to find a way</p>
<p>to try to restore normal function to these areas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much directional, really.</p>
<p>We tend to oversimplify brain function</p>
<p>by thinking about it with directionality too much.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, imaging studies</p>
<p>sometimes demonstrate activation or hypo-activation,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where I think these kinds of things</p>
<p>can be misconstrued.</p>
<p>But what I would call the cortical areas of OCD</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re dysregulated,</p>
<p>and we need to find a way</p>
<p>to try to normalize their function.</p>
<p>So the frontal lobe is huge,</p>
<p>but areas of the frontal lobe that are a bit more basal,</p>
<p>like the OFC, or orbital frontal cortex,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>definitely consistently seem to be implicated</p>
<p>in patients with OCD.</p>
<p>And then there are projections to the subcortex.</p>
<p>This is the basal ganglia, like you were saying.</p>
<p>Caudate putamen are the dorsal stratum,</p>
<p>and these are interconnected with the ventral stratum.</p>
<p>This is an area of the brain</p>
<p>that I focus a lot of my energy in.</p>
<p>This is the ventral stratum,</p>
<p>which is not limited to,</p>
<p>but includes the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>This is an area of the brain</p>
<p>that we know to be involved</p>
<p>in gating reward-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s perturbed,</p>
<p>it seems to gate compulsive behavior,</p>
<p>meaning a rat will pursue a reward despite punishment,</p>
<p>despite a foot shock, for example.</p>
<p>And that can be similar to an OCD patient.</p>
<p>They will check their home for safety</p>
<p>until 3 a.m. in the morning and not sleep that night.</p>
<p>In a way, that is similar to a rat</p>
<p>seeking out a food reward despite a foot shock,</p>
<p>doing something because of the urge,</p>
<p>but despite the risk.</p>
<p>And perhaps there is some normal judgment there.</p>
<p>We all have to take risks to function in everyday society.</p>
<p>To be successful, we have to take a risk.</p>
<p>To take care of patients with surgery,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some risk there.</p>
<p>We make a judgment call,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not a condition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just normal.</p>
<p>But when our judgment is consistently</p>
<p>sort of puts us at risk,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we have something like OCD.</p>
<p>But OCD is also, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of many conditions</p>
<p>that suffer from these kinds of problems.</p>
<p>We tend to label them</p>
<p>because they tend to present in a consistent way.</p>
<p>So we have patients with OCD</p>
<p>that have hyper-checking behavior</p>
<p>or contamination behavior</p>
<p>where if they feel contaminated,</p>
<p>they will wash their hands for hours repeatedly,</p>
<p>or if they drop their toothbrush on the floor,</p>
<p>this will lead to a compulsive behavior</p>
<p>of cleaning a toothbrush</p>
<p>and brushing your teeth consistently.</p>
<p>Very, very common symptoms that we see</p>
<p>or signs that the patients report to us</p>
<p>or that we observe.</p>
<p>But, you know, patients with eating disorders,</p>
<p>they tend to, if they have binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll overeat.</p>
<p>If they have bulimia, they might purge</p>
<p>despite the risk of these things.</p>
<p>And so addiction is similar.</p>
<p>We tend to drug seek if we&rsquo;re addicted.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll pay off a dealer in order to get our fix</p>
<p>despite the risk.</p>
<p>And that type of urge despite the risk</p>
<p>is something that I&rsquo;ve always been really interested in.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a common denominator to all of these problems.</p>
<p>And if you think about these problems,</p>
<p>I mean, these are some of the most common conditions</p>
<p>in our society today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that you&rsquo;re building this bridge</p>
<p>from OCD to nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>which is, of course, associated with reward in various forms.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get to that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share a personal anecdote as a form of question.</p>
<p>When I was in college and studying a lot,</p>
<p>I relied on caffeine as a stimulant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really been into drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky in that sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t drink and I care less if alcohol disappeared.</p>
<p>Never really liked recreational drugs.</p>
<p>So I was never drawn to them.</p>
<p>However, when I was in college,</p>
<p>at the time there were these little epinephrine pills</p>
<p>that were common in a lot of sports supplements.</p>
<p>These were like pre-workout type things.</p>
<p>Not unlike energy drinks now, which I completely avoid.</p>
<p>And I had this experience of taking one of these</p>
<p>and drinking some coffee.</p>
<p>And of course it gave me a lift in energy.</p>
<p>These are very similar to amphetamine.</p>
<p>They were legal over the counter at the time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now either banned or illegal.</p>
<p>I do not recommend them.</p>
<p>And I had a lot of energy,</p>
<p>but what I noticed is that my grunting came back</p>
<p>and I made one mistake.</p>
<p>I still think of this as one mistake,</p>
<p>which was I engaged in a superstitious behavior.</p>
<p>I knocked on wood.</p>
<p>And then somehow it felt very rewarding.</p>
<p>Like it gave me some totally irrational,</p>
<p>but internally rational sense of security around.</p>
<p>I forget what I was knocking on wood about.</p>
<p>And I found that I couldn&rsquo;t break</p>
<p>that knock on wood compulsion.</p>
<p>I felt I needed to knock on wood.</p>
<p>And so then I started sneaking knock on woods</p>
<p>like in mid exam and studying.</p>
<p>And pretty soon I was knocking on wood often.</p>
<p>I developed a superstition.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m curious about the role of superstition</p>
<p>and compulsion and the crossover there.</p>
<p>It makes sense logically to me,</p>
<p>but I was equally shocked to learn</p>
<p>that when I stopped taking this stimulant,</p>
<p>which I was quite happy to stop</p>
<p>because it did make me feel too alert,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t sleep well, et cetera,</p>
<p>that the superstition went away as well.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing this has something to do</p>
<p>with some of the reward circuitry as it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>related to stimulants.</p>
<p>Again, I am not encouraging anyone to take stimulants,</p>
<p>although healthy use of caffeine or safe use of caffeine</p>
<p>might be the one universally accepted stimulant.</p>
<p>It was really surprising to me how quickly this came on,</p>
<p>how quickly it engaged my thinking and my behavior,</p>
<p>the obsessions and the compulsions,</p>
<p>and how quickly it turned off</p>
<p>when I stopped taking this sports stimulant</p>
<p>or whatever it was.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember.</p>
<p>I think it was some form of epinephrine, ephedrine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not epinephrine, excuse me.</p>
<p>I misspoke, ephedrine.</p>
<p>Does what I described sound totally outside the bounds</p>
<p>of logic or am I imagining it all?</p>
<p>It did happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain it happened.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re imagining it at all.</p>
<p>The grunting that you mentioned to me,</p>
<p>first of all, I didn&rsquo;t comment,</p>
<p>but that sort of, not to put a label on it,</p>
<p>but it sounds like a tick.</p>
<p>And ticks in young males, extremely common.</p>
<p>And they do tend to go away.</p>
<p>Blinking ticks.</p>
<p>I have a good friend who,</p>
<p>actually a famous neuroscientist,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t mention who it is,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s worked very hard to suppress his blinking tick.</p>
<p>And when he gets fatigued, it comes back.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s very high-functioning in his personal life</p>
<p>and his professional life.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re talking to him and he starts doing this,</p>
<p>you kind of start wondering like, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s unfortunate.</p>
<p>People with these problems,</p>
<p>especially as they get more severe,</p>
<p>then you get Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to function in our society.</p>
<p>I have some friends that have Tourette,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell you, I&rsquo;m just so inspired</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so confident.</p>
<p>And people obviously notice these problems,</p>
<p>but they just live their life and they&rsquo;re very successful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not typical.</p>
<p>I have friends that I went to Penn with undergrad</p>
<p>that had these kinds of problems,</p>
<p>and I was always just so happy and inspired by them.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s more typical is these problems cause people</p>
<p>to lose their confidence and not pursue their profession</p>
<p>as they may have done or things of that nature.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s all related to the fact</p>
<p>that our brains are very vulnerable.</p>
<p>And to get back to your question about the stimulant,</p>
<p>I think your brain was very vulnerable to it.</p>
<p>You sort of may have had a predisposition to it.</p>
<p>You mentioned that you&rsquo;re a little obsessive,</p>
<p>and with the tick there, maybe you have this kind of,</p>
<p>on the mild side of the spectrum, OCD.</p>
<p>And I probably do as well, by the way.</p>
<p>So I also have avoided drugs for that reason in my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll drink a little bit of wine here and there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>And, but I think most people don&rsquo;t avoid these things.</p>
<p>And we see these problems in relation</p>
<p>to not just taking a stimulant,</p>
<p>but any kind of environmental exposure.</p>
<p>Our own society causes so much stress.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think we have these human conditions.</p>
<p>These are human conditions.</p>
<p>We try to model them in animals,</p>
<p>but most animals don&rsquo;t have these kinds of problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that an animal, like a monkey in the wild,</p>
<p>can have depression, a monkey&rsquo;s version of depression,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really typical or human depression.</p>
<p>And certainly it&rsquo;s not as prevalent as depression</p>
<p>is in our human society.</p>
<p>I think we haven&rsquo;t evolved to manage the stresses</p>
<p>that are in this society that we currently have.</p>
<p>And stimulants is probably one of them.</p>
<p>And I suspect you are probably a little bit vulnerable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible the stimulant led to an overdrive</p>
<p>of your prefrontal and orbital frontal cortex,</p>
<p>and even brought out a little OCD behavior</p>
<p>related to this superstition that you had.</p>
<p>So, no, I believe that entirely.</p>
<p>And I also think that&rsquo;s why things like OCD</p>
<p>and other kinds of psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>tend to present themselves in college,</p>
<p>when people leave their home and they&rsquo;re in school</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re stressed and they&rsquo;re getting exposed to things</p>
<p>that they haven&rsquo;t been exposed to before</p>
<p>outside of the home.</p>
<p>And their brains aren&rsquo;t evolved and sophisticated enough yet</p>
<p>to help them cope with these kinds of stresses</p>
<p>and how it manifests is in these kinds of conditions.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to put a label on those conditions,</p>
<p>but certainly could be a psychiatric disorder,</p>
<p>but could also just be lots of anxiety.</p>
<p>It could also be the kind of problems that you had as well.</p>
<p>So, and I think the nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>and the cortical areas that we&rsquo;ve been discussing</p>
<p>that sort of send projections to these areas</p>
<p>are probably at least one of the main circuits</p>
<p>involved in these kinds of things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m relieved it&rsquo;s no longer present, but I confess it.</p>
<p>I always feel it close by, a long run helps.</p>
<p>So, you know, being a slightly fatigued,</p>
<p>not overly fatigued, but slightly fatigued</p>
<p>seems to move out the kind of physical compulsion,</p>
<p>but tried to channel it, never taken any medication for it.</p>
<p>Here I am still going.</p>
<p>I may call you for a referral at some point,</p>
<p>but at this point I&rsquo;m feeling okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about nucleus accumbens and reward circuitry</p>
<p>and the relationship between OCD, reward, addiction,</p>
<p>and to just give you a sense of where I&rsquo;m headed with this</p>
<p>is into the realm of food-related and eating-related</p>
<p>behaviors and disorders,</p>
<p>because I know you&rsquo;re doing some very important work there.</p>
<p>What is nucleus accumbens?</p>
<p>I know we all have one or two,</p>
<p>one on each side of the brain.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What roles does it play in healthy brain behavior</p>
<p>and in pathology?</p>
<p>Yeah, the nucleus accumbens is a part of the brain,</p>
<p>part of our reward circuits,</p>
<p>the hub of the reward circuits</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve always been most fascinated in.</p>
<p>There are scientists around the world,</p>
<p>some of the leading,</p>
<p>arguably some of the leading scientists in the world,</p>
<p>the father of addiction neuroscience, I call him,</p>
<p>although he tells me I&rsquo;m nuts,</p>
<p>Rob Malenka, who has studied the nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>since the beginning of his career</p>
<p>and who I worked with when I was at Stanford.</p>
<p>Fabulous scientist and mentor, taught me so much,</p>
<p>taught the world so much.</p>
<p>Incredible person, scientist and physician as well.</p>
<p>Yes, MD, PhD and brilliant in both ways</p>
<p>and very fatherly in a lot of way</p>
<p>in terms of teaching people how to do science</p>
<p>and be good citizens as well.</p>
<p>But the nucleus accumbens is an area</p>
<p>that is also very complicated</p>
<p>because it has a lot of functions.</p>
<p>It interconnects with many parts of the brain,</p>
<p>but there are some things about the nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>that are very consistent.</p>
<p>So when I started getting interested in reward</p>
<p>and what I could do as a surgeon</p>
<p>to try to improve how we manage rewards,</p>
<p>and what I mean by that specifically</p>
<p>is if you have an urge for a reward,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a normal phenomenon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something we&rsquo;re trying to stop.</p>
<p>The issue is if you have an urge for a reward</p>
<p>that either puts you or somebody else at risk,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a reward we shouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>I suppose you could say,</p>
<p>well, it depends on the size of the reward</p>
<p>and the size of the risk</p>
<p>and how that fits into your societal norms.</p>
<p>But for example, if you&rsquo;re obese</p>
<p>and you have a doctor who is advising that you lose weight</p>
<p>and try to control your eating habits,</p>
<p>you know, perhaps better food choices</p>
<p>is an important way for you to be healthier</p>
<p>and not pursuing those better food choices,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an urge that we probably need to treat.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a drug addict and you use heroin or opiate,</p>
<p>considering the opiate crisis right now,</p>
<p>or cocaine, which is untreatable at the moment,</p>
<p>you know, that cocaine might make you feel</p>
<p>like you have some more energy that day</p>
<p>to deal with your work,</p>
<p>or that opiate might make you feel better</p>
<p>because life is stressful.</p>
<p>But the risk of doing those things is really high,</p>
<p>in fact, potentially lethal.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an urge that&rsquo;s treatable.</p>
<p>If you have OCD and you can&rsquo;t sleep at night</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re so nervous that you didn&rsquo;t lock the door</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve checked 30 times,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a reality for some people with severe OCD.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an urge we gotta treat.</p>
<p>Eating disorders, the same.</p>
<p>Eating disorders and obesity are obviously linked</p>
<p>because of the relationship of a patient with food,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also quite distinct.</p>
<p>Not everybody with obesity has an eating disorder,</p>
<p>and obviously not everybody with an eating disorder</p>
<p>has obesity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested in patients</p>
<p>that have binge eating disorder as well as obesity,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so heavily linked.</p>
<p>Not everybody with binge eating disorder has obesity,</p>
<p>but on average, most are overweight.</p>
<p>We are doing a deep brain stimulation trial at Penn</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re trying to modulate the nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>and understand it better in patients</p>
<p>that have failed gastric bypass surgery,</p>
<p>the most aggressive form of treatment for obesity.</p>
<p>And we believe they failed gastric bypass surgery</p>
<p>because of binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>meaning they just can&rsquo;t control how much they eat.</p>
<p>So their obesity is either related</p>
<p>or even due to overeating,</p>
<p>not some predisposition to that body habitus.</p>
<p>Obesity is a phenotype, something that we can see.</p>
<p>Not everybody is obese because of the same thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>I was taught this by a close mentor and friend, Tom Wadden,</p>
<p>when he was the director of the Obesity Center at Penn</p>
<p>or the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders.</p>
<p>And he said to me, Casey, be careful with obesity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re interested in addiction,</p>
<p>and I understand you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in the addictive tendencies of certain patients with obesity</p>
<p>and their relationship with food,</p>
<p>but not everybody with obesity has that problem.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s probably present</p>
<p>in about 20% of patients with obesity.</p>
<p>But now taking a step back,</p>
<p>20% of patients with obesity is still a massive problem</p>
<p>of epidemic proportions.</p>
<p>And perhaps some of these patients</p>
<p>have either some form of binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>or I should say some degree of binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>or at least loss of control eating,</p>
<p>which is common to both.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a feature that I think eating disorder experts,</p>
<p>obesity experts, neurosurgeons,</p>
<p>obesity medicine experts would agree is common</p>
<p>to eating disorders and obesity.</p>
<p>And I also believe it&rsquo;s common to addicts.</p>
<p>And perhaps patients with OCD</p>
<p>is sort of a loss of control disorder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not a disorder known by like the DSM-5,</p>
<p>some diagnostic manual,</p>
<p>but a feature I should say of these conditions that&rsquo;s common</p>
<p>and that common denominator I believe can be restored</p>
<p>or at least this problem can be ameliorated</p>
<p>or improved upon by a better understanding</p>
<p>and a tailored treatment</p>
<p>to the nucleus accumbens specifically.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve learned in mice that if you expose a mouse,</p>
<p>now this is just a model.</p>
<p>If you expose a mouse to high fat food,</p>
<p>not food that they would normally eat,</p>
<p>food that is like 60% fat, high fat, it&rsquo;s like butter.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve learned that if you expose them to food like that,</p>
<p>within two weeks,</p>
<p>their nucleus accumbens is not functioning</p>
<p>like a mouse that was never exposed to that high fat food.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s aspects of it that are hyperactive, I could say,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s aspects of it that are hypoactive</p>
<p>or decreased activity.</p>
<p>But either way, it&rsquo;s not functioning properly.</p>
<p>And most likely that function</p>
<p>is predisposing continued behavior.</p>
<p>And then probably eventually leads to things like a habit</p>
<p>that gets developed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a whole nother area of these kinds of problems</p>
<p>that is very complicated and poorly understood.</p>
<p>But in any case, if we just focus on the behavior at hand,</p>
<p>it seems that repeated exposure</p>
<p>to something like high fat food, a drug of abuse,</p>
<p>or any type of reward that is a really strong reward,</p>
<p>in a way it can hijack normal functioning</p>
<p>of the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>So the goal of our invasive trial</p>
<p>is to try to restore normal functioning</p>
<p>to that nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>In mice, there seems to be a signal</p>
<p>that predicts when they&rsquo;re going to lose control.</p>
<p>And we can use that signal to deliver</p>
<p>a sort of a real-time therapy</p>
<p>in the form of deep brain stimulation,</p>
<p>just a brief amount of stimulation.</p>
<p>And that actually blocks the behavior.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is over time,</p>
<p>that signal actually decreases in frequency,</p>
<p>which suggests some level of restoring normal function</p>
<p>to that circuit in a mouse.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying to do that now in a human trial.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>Where is the stimulation provided?</p>
<p>Because I would imagine that if one were</p>
<p>to stimulate nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>you would see a reinforcement of whatever behavior</p>
<p>coincided or preceded the stimulation.</p>
<p>So the stimulation, it&rsquo;s a brief delivery of stimulation,</p>
<p>anywhere between five and 10 seconds,</p>
<p>that is intended to just disrupt the perturbed signaling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>There are disorders like depression, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>that I would describe as a bit more of a state disorder.</p>
<p>And this is obviously oversimplified</p>
<p>because we know that there&rsquo;s fluctuations</p>
<p>in mood and depression as well.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t let me oversimplify it too much.</p>
<p>But for now, let&rsquo;s forgive the oversimplification.</p>
<p>If we accept that depression is a state disorder,</p>
<p>or maybe Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is a state disorder,</p>
<p>recognizing that they do fluctuate,</p>
<p>these types of problems most likely, but not definitely,</p>
<p>most likely need a continuous therapy of some form,</p>
<p>a therapy that&rsquo;s consistent.</p>
<p>Perhaps a therapy that fluctuates with the condition,</p>
<p>but nevertheless still consistent.</p>
<p>Binge eating disorder, or OCD, or addiction,</p>
<p>and binge eating disorder in the context of obesity.</p>
<p>A lot of these patients are functioning quite normally</p>
<p>every single day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that intermittently throughout the day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s brief interruptions in their normal function,</p>
<p>such that they have thoughts about food</p>
<p>or the drug of abuse that they&rsquo;re really longing to have.</p>
<p>And so we wanna deliver a episodic therapy,</p>
<p>delivered at the right time, and only at the right time,</p>
<p>to try to interrupt the circuit aberration,</p>
<p>or the problem at hand,</p>
<p>that is gonna lead to that dangerous behavior,</p>
<p>and to kind of get the patient back on track</p>
<p>to what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that it leads to a reinforcement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>We have to study that more.</p>
<p>But rather, the goal is to just disrupt</p>
<p>perhaps what is kind of habitual,</p>
<p>or at least this kind of recurring problem</p>
<p>that is happening.</p>
<p>People that have binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>at least at a severe level,</p>
<p>they tend to binge about once a day.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t binge all day long, of course.</p>
<p>They have a moment, perhaps, when they get home from work</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>where they might have a bout of binge.</p>
<p>What constitutes a binge?</p>
<p>And I also want to know,</p>
<p>does binge eating disorder come on suddenly,</p>
<p>meaning as an entire disorder?</p>
<p>One day, people wake up,</p>
<p>suddenly they have binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>or is this a few too many buffets,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m being entirely serious here,</p>
<p>you know, unlimited food,</p>
<p>and a circuit gets flipped,</p>
<p>or it kind of starts moving into the high RPMs,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>So how does it come on?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m actually surprised to hear that it&rsquo;s once a day.</p>
<p>I would think, just hearing binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>I assume it&rsquo;s like OCD,</p>
<p>which it probably fluctuates across the day as well.</p>
<p>But I would have thought,</p>
<p>anytime people are around food,</p>
<p>they just simply can&rsquo;t control their intake of food.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what does this look like</p>
<p>in terms of the onset of the disorder?</p>
<p>And then what do you think underlies</p>
<p>this once a day type of phenomenon?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, so severe binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>these patients will binge about once a day.</p>
<p>It could be a couple of times a day,</p>
<p>but in general, it&rsquo;s not more than that.</p>
<p>Moderate is about three to four times a week, for example.</p>
<p>The reason I think that that seems surprising to you,</p>
<p>and if you think about it, it is surprising,</p>
<p>but, and I agree with you,</p>
<p>but the reason for that</p>
<p>is actually just in the definitions of the word.</p>
<p>And as a neurosurgeon, in full disclosure, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t see these patients clinically.</p>
<p>I see them for research trial purposes,</p>
<p>and I try to understand the literature</p>
<p>around eating disorders.</p>
<p>And I obviously collaborate with fabulous eating disorders</p>
<p>in these problems that are highly innovative people.</p>
<p>But the word binge is a definition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a definition to that word.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t necessarily binge all day</p>
<p>because our stomachs are not big enough.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a limit to how much one can eat.</p>
<p>And to meet criteria for a binge,</p>
<p>you have to have a sense of loss of control.</p>
<p>You have to eat an enormous amount of food</p>
<p>in a brief period of time.</p>
<p>And yes, generally that doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>more than about once a day</p>
<p>in a patient with severe binge eating disorder.</p>
<p>However, they can lose control quite often.</p>
<p>And in fact, perhaps even at every meal,</p>
<p>they might meet criteria for a bout of loss of control</p>
<p>where they, yes, they may have lost control,</p>
<p>but they might not have eaten enough</p>
<p>to constitute what we would define as a binge.</p>
<p>And that would be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no specific number to that, by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just compared to their normal meal,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s 50% of their daily calories</p>
<p>in that one brief moment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think it seems surprising</p>
<p>that binges aren&rsquo;t happening more often than that.</p>
<p>What I would say is if we replace the term binge</p>
<p>with loss of control eating,</p>
<p>loss of control eating could happen</p>
<p>dozens of times a week.</p>
<p>And in fact, the patients that we&rsquo;re studying,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen patients that lose control 20, 30 times a week.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably the term you have in mind</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re surprised that it&rsquo;s just one time a day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s specifically related to the fact</p>
<p>that these patients have to eat such a large amount of food</p>
<p>in such a brief period of time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to do that more than once a day.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>You mentioned that some preexisting anxiety</p>
<p>might bias somebody to have a binge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also fascinated by something I&rsquo;ve observed before,</p>
<p>which was when I was in college,</p>
<p>my girlfriend had a roommate who we were aware was bulimic</p>
<p>and would binge and then purge.</p>
<p>And often when she ingested alcohol,</p>
<p>that would lead to a binge.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Which is kind of the opposite of anxiety</p>
<p>when I think about alcohol as something</p>
<p>that slightly reduces prefrontal activity,</p>
<p>somewhat of a sedative,</p>
<p>or certainly a sedative at higher dosages.</p>
<p>So this brings to something that you said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna, I won&rsquo;t say it as eloquently as you did,</p>
<p>that it seems like it&rsquo;s neither the case</p>
<p>that anxiety leads to binging,</p>
<p>nor that hypo-reduced activation of the forebrain</p>
<p>and lower anxiety leads to binging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this dysregulation of circuitry</p>
<p>that the seesaw could go either way</p>
<p>and it can throw things off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s off balance in both cases.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, and that seems to be,</p>
<p>that seems to pose a problem.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s a particularly tricky problem</p>
<p>and kind of explains to me in my non-clinical awareness</p>
<p>why medication might be really hard to use</p>
<p>as a way to treat this,</p>
<p>but that being able to poke around in the brain</p>
<p>and assay in real time, you know, how do you feel?</p>
<p>Do you feel like binging now?</p>
<p>Or do you feel further from the binge impulse?</p>
<p>Is that what you do with these patients?</p>
<p>Are they awake while you&rsquo;re stimulating the brain?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s one thing to say,</p>
<p>I stimulate a brain area and that binging goes away</p>
<p>or partial relief or complete relief,</p>
<p>but how do you know?</p>
<p>Are they in there with a donut and you&rsquo;re tempting them?</p>
<p>So how do you actually know if ablating a brain area</p>
<p>is going to lead to relief or exacerbation</p>
<p>or no impact on this disorder?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to go one step at a time.</p>
<p>And if I miss something, please remind me.</p>
<p>And I tend to ask these three-part questions</p>
<p>specifically of neurosurgeons</p>
<p>because I like to challenge you guys.</p>
<p>Because again, you are the astronauts of neuroscience.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m just going to take a moment</p>
<p>to poke at neurosurgeons</p>
<p>because I have a couple of close friends</p>
<p>who are neurosurgeons and I consider Casey a friend.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he considers me a friend,</p>
<p>but I consider him a friend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m teasing there too, which is, first of all,</p>
<p>they all have incredible hands, right?</p>
<p>They have, I&rsquo;m not, they all guard their hands</p>
<p>with the kind of protection that you would guard,</p>
<p>the tools of, the most important tools of your trade.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very careful with their hands.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to see them doing heavy deadlifts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not because of the way that impacts the motor neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about fine control.</p>
<p>So if your neurosurgeon does heavy deadlifts,</p>
<p>you might want to consider getting a different neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>Hope I didn&rsquo;t put anyone out of work there.</p>
<p>And then the other thing is that</p>
<p>you all tend to be very calm people,</p>
<p>at least on the exterior.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to this later.</p>
<p>But I do throw three or four questions out at once.</p>
<p>So elevated autonomic arousal and alertness,</p>
<p>as well as decreased autonomic arousal and alertness,</p>
<p>both seem to be able to lead to binging.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this question of how do you know</p>
<p>whether or not to stimulate or to ablate</p>
<p>or whether or not to leave a structure alone?</p>
<p>In other words, what does one of these experiments</p>
<p>look like in the laboratory?</p>
<p>Yeah, sort of a-</p>
<p>Clinic, excuse me.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>These are questions I think about all the time.</p>
<p>And I do want to come back to the deadlifting comment.</p>
<p>But regarding, and you referred to this earlier as well,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if I addressed it sufficiently either,</p>
<p>is sort of like what comes first here</p>
<p>or how does this develop?</p>
<p>I think, first of all,</p>
<p>I like to understand these kinds of problems</p>
<p>in sort of the construct of what I consider to be</p>
<p>a bit of a two-hit hypothesis.</p>
<p>So you sort of need, like in the concussion literature,</p>
<p>you need, the second hit can be devastating.</p>
<p>So if you have a concussion,</p>
<p>you know you want to only return to play</p>
<p>when your symptoms are gone and cleared by a physician.</p>
<p>So in the context of eating disorders,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>first of all, I didn&rsquo;t mention earlier,</p>
<p>but this is the most common eating disorder.</p>
<p>Affects anywhere between three and 5% of the population.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably underdiagnosed in obesity, by the way.</p>
<p>And if obesity affects 35% of our population,</p>
<p>most likely binge eating disorder affects</p>
<p>more than three to 5%.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the current literature estimate</p>
<p>on the prevalence.</p>
<p>So how do we develop binge eating disorder?</p>
<p>And is it related to this anxiety question?</p>
<p>You know, I think that there is a predisposition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first hit.</p>
<p>I actually think all humans have this predisposition.</p>
<p>Just some have it more than others.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;ve evolved to live in a society</p>
<p>where foods are so readily available</p>
<p>and enormously delicious</p>
<p>and have so much sugar and fat in them.</p>
<p>Not that there&rsquo;s any particular problem</p>
<p>with either of these micronutrients.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the excess of it and how they&rsquo;re refined</p>
<p>that I think is the problem.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s high fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>in almost everything we eat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in bread.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know why it&rsquo;s in bread sometimes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of crazy.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re evolved to live in a society</p>
<p>that has food that&rsquo;s so readily available like that.</p>
<p>And cheap, by the way.</p>
<p>In fact, the cheaper the foods are,</p>
<p>sort of the more refined and palatable</p>
<p>and I would argue dangerous to eat.</p>
<p>I think they change our reward circuits for the worse</p>
<p>and put us at risk for wanting more.</p>
<p>I tend to get a headache when I eat food like that.</p>
<p>And perhaps that&rsquo;s a evolutionary advantage</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to eat those foods</p>
<p>because they actually do make me sick.</p>
<p>So in a lot of ways, I kind of wish that headache</p>
<p>on everybody because perhaps we wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>all these problems or at least some of them would go away.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the first issue is a predisposition</p>
<p>to or a vulnerability to these types of foods,</p>
<p>which we undoubtedly all have to a certain extent,</p>
<p>but some more than others.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the first hit,</p>
<p>is this predisposition in the context</p>
<p>of this sort of food-focused society.</p>
<p>And then the second hit is probably a stressful event</p>
<p>or a stressful life.</p>
<p>And probably a recurring stressful event.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure this is published.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never sat down with like a eating disorder expert</p>
<p>and had this question about how this develops.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s actually well known.</p>
<p>But in a lot of ways, I think that that answer,</p>
<p>anybody would agree with,</p>
<p>that we need sort of a predisposition in the exposure,</p>
<p>the environmental exposure and the genetic predisposition,</p>
<p>but also a stressor.</p>
<p>And that stressor is probably one that&rsquo;s recurring.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s obvious in our society,</p>
<p>these stressors are everywhere</p>
<p>and how we can manage them is often poor.</p>
<p>And I think we could all relate with that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s something else in the background</p>
<p>that I think is really important to mention</p>
<p>is that patients with these kinds of problems are embarrassed</p>
<p>because our society doesn&rsquo;t think fondly</p>
<p>of these kinds of patients.</p>
<p>Binging disorder patients, they do tend to be overweight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obviously a stigma.</p>
<p>Obesity is another stigma.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>In a way, it&rsquo;s an opposite, by the way,</p>
<p>from a phenotype standpoint, that&rsquo;s anorexia.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s another stigma.</p>
<p>And gosh, not to make this about one sex over another,</p>
<p>but when girls are told they&rsquo;re pretty because they&rsquo;re thin,</p>
<p>it just reinforces this problem.</p>
<p>And of course you want to compliment people</p>
<p>and make them feel good about themselves.</p>
<p>But the problem is that in this vulnerable society,</p>
<p>that that can lead to problems</p>
<p>because people start thinking,</p>
<p>oh, I should be thin or thinner.</p>
<p>So I think that it&rsquo;s a little bit of a societal understanding</p>
<p>that our brains are very vulnerable.</p>
<p>And I think that will really help.</p>
<p>Changing society is hard.</p>
<p>And most of society is not ill-meaning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all done by accident,</p>
<p>but that is the society that we live in.</p>
<p>So if we can try to improve that stigma</p>
<p>and be kinder to people in that way,</p>
<p>I think a lot of these problems would get better.</p>
<p>People that are obese,</p>
<p>that feel embarrassed by their obesity, it doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>It only makes it worse because they give up.</p>
<p>Same thing might be true for anorexics.</p>
<p>So I really think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to consider all of these things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so complicated.</p>
<p>And it would be so hard to do a well-controlled study</p>
<p>to understand it better</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many of these variables to control for</p>
<p>that you really can&rsquo;t control for.</p>
<p>You might be able to control for them</p>
<p>in a mouse&rsquo;s home cage,</p>
<p>but not in the society that we live in.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of my brief sort of summary</p>
<p>of how I would answer your first question.</p>
<p>Then I think your second question,</p>
<p>I sort of take that as,</p>
<p>well, how do you study such a complicated problem</p>
<p>in the operating room and in the clinic?</p>
<p>Because I mentioned the operating room</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s sort of the first step here.</p>
<p>First, we have, just to clarify,</p>
<p>we have a NIH-funded trial approved by the FDA</p>
<p>for research to do this first-in-human study.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve treated two patients.</p>
<p>We have four more to come at Penn.</p>
<p>And in this study,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been working towards my entire career.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t know is where in the nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>will we identify cells or regions</p>
<p>that seem to be involved</p>
<p>in this sort of reward-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>I would call it appetitive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like appetite,</p>
<p>but the word appetitive is,</p>
<p>I think, a good word to use.</p>
<p>What part of the nucleus accumbens is appetitive?</p>
<p>Is the whole thing appetitive?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>In my world, it&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>As a neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>I target parts of the brain</p>
<p>that are three or four millimeters in size.</p>
<p>The nucleus accumbens is almost a centimeter in size.</p>
<p>Wow, I didn&rsquo;t realize it was that large.</p>
<p>This sort of reminds me of discussions</p>
<p>around the amygdala.</p>
<p>Everyone thinks amygdala fear,</p>
<p>but amygdala&rsquo;s got a lot of different sub-regions.</p>
<p>And stimulation of certain areas of the amygdala</p>
<p>makes people feel great.</p>
<p>And stimulation of other areas</p>
<p>makes them feel terribly afraid.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us</p>
<p>because when we treat patients</p>
<p>with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease for tremor,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re in one part of the subthalamic nucleus,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll help their tremor.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re in another part of the subthalamic nucleus,</p>
<p>the neurologist is looking at me like,</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t this working?</p>
<p>And that shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us.</p>
<p>We already know that, you know,</p>
<p>two or three millimeters deviation</p>
<p>or two or three millimeters away</p>
<p>from where we want to be,</p>
<p>and you might not have the result you want.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably also true</p>
<p>for these more limbic structures</p>
<p>like the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>So, you know, regarding the nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>we traverse some of the nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>not all of it,</p>
<p>in order to place the electrode</p>
<p>that we want to use to detect</p>
<p>when cravings are happening, for example,</p>
<p>and to try to block the cravings</p>
<p>from leading to the behavior</p>
<p>related to the reward seeking,</p>
<p>which is the overeating in this case.</p>
<p>So what we decided to do in the operating room</p>
<p>was to actually try to leverage a tool</p>
<p>that we use all the time</p>
<p>when we take care of patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So with Parkinson&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>a lot of these patients, not all, have tremor.</p>
<p>And so when we place an electrode</p>
<p>into this motor structure</p>
<p>to try to improve their movement disorder,</p>
<p>we often can hear tremor cells.</p>
<p>And they sound,</p>
<p>we convert their electrical signal</p>
<p>to an audible signal so we can actually hear it.</p>
<p>And it sounds kind of like the tremor looks,</p>
<p>like the frequency of the signal</p>
<p>is the same as the hand shaking.</p>
<p>So, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so the patient with Parkinson&rsquo;s is trembling.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re awake,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re poking around</p>
<p>in a dedicated, careful way, of course.</p>
<p>One poke at a time.</p>
<p>One poke at a time,</p>
<p>and with a very fine wire,</p>
<p>a set of wires,</p>
<p>listening to the electrical activity</p>
<p>until you encounter some cells</p>
<p>that are sending out electrical activity</p>
<p>at a similar frequency.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you can stimulate them or quiet them</p>
<p>and see if the tremor goes away.</p>
<p>So we are very confident</p>
<p>that when we stimulate that area of,</p>
<p>in this case, the subthalamic nucleus,</p>
<p>we will make that tremor,</p>
<p>we will disrupt that tremor circuit,</p>
<p>and that tremor will dissolve.</p>
<p>And it does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Parkinson&rsquo;s is so beautiful</p>
<p>and inspiring from a surgeon.</p>
<p>And tractable.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It makes us feel we understand the brain,</p>
<p>at least in that limited way.</p>
<p>So what is the analog to tremor</p>
<p>in terms of appetite and desire to binge?</p>
<p>Craving.</p>
<p>So craving is a term that,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s probably other terms</p>
<p>we could use, by the way,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the term we&rsquo;ve chosen to use</p>
<p>for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>One, because people relate with that term.</p>
<p>People that have binge eating disorder or obesity,</p>
<p>if you ask them if they crave,</p>
<p>the answer will often be yes.</p>
<p>If you ask them if they lose control or binge,</p>
<p>they might not know what you mean,</p>
<p>or they might not actually feel out of control,</p>
<p>even when they are.</p>
<p>But the word craving is relatable.</p>
<p>And so we set out to see</p>
<p>if we could identify craving cells.</p>
<p>In a patient with OCD, which is related,</p>
<p>in fact, we target a very similar part of the brain,</p>
<p>we tried to identify cells related to obsessions.</p>
<p>And we believe we did do that.</p>
<p>It was a single case study</p>
<p>where we tried to optimize where our electrode was placed.</p>
<p>So we had some proof of concept</p>
<p>that we would be able to elicit</p>
<p>a sort of disease-specific symptom in the operating room,</p>
<p>assuming the patient could tolerate being awake.</p>
<p>Not everybody needs to be awake for this procedure,</p>
<p>but at least for these first human trials</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re trying to establish</p>
<p>where in the brain we need to be,</p>
<p>I think this type of approach is really critical.</p>
<p>And by the way, none of this has been published,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s so important for people to know this.</p>
<p>So I am willing to share some aspects</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really the first goal of this trial</p>
<p>is to identify where in the nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>we can detect these craving cells.</p>
<p>So we have to provoke food craving in the operating room.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>Well, there are some somewhat validated ways to do that.</p>
<p>So for example, we asked patients</p>
<p>to provide pictures of food</p>
<p>that they rate very highly</p>
<p>as something that they would typically crave.</p>
<p>And depending on the patient,</p>
<p>it might be something that&rsquo;s very salty,</p>
<p>it could be very sweet, like a donut.</p>
<p>Donuts are good.</p>
<p>I love donuts.</p>
<p>Donuts are great.</p>
<p>You should try the Cronut</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re here in New York City.</p>
<p>I just might.</p>
<p>I try not to eat that sort of thing.</p>
<p>For all the reasons they change your brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth one bite.</p>
<p>Just try to stop yourself after that one bite.</p>
<p>So if I were one of these patients,</p>
<p>given the fact that the binges come on</p>
<p>pretty seldom once a day,</p>
<p>I imagine you have them come to the operating room fasted</p>
<p>or semi-fasted.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fasted, yep.</p>
<p>Okay, they&rsquo;re fasted,</p>
<p>which there are probably surgical reasons</p>
<p>for wanting that too.</p>
<p>Yes, they kind of have to be.</p>
<p>Right, and then you&rsquo;ve done the craniotomy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve removed a patch of skull,</p>
<p>lowered the wire into the nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>and then they are viewing pictures of food</p>
<p>that they crave and thinking about it.</p>
<p>Do they have olfactory cues,</p>
<p>smells of Cronuts and donuts?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;d love to do the olfactory cues.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t implemented that,</p>
<p>but that is a great thank you,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll give you full credit when we do.</p>
<p>Sure, I didn&rsquo;t review the grant,</p>
<p>but it sounds,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad this work is funded</p>
<p>because this time it&rsquo;s not a joke.</p>
<p>When I referred to you all,</p>
<p>you neurosurgeons as the astronauts of the brain,</p>
<p>this is out on the extreme edge of what we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about how the brain functions,</p>
<p>and this is so far and away different</p>
<p>than giving a mouse access to a high-fat food.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m not being disparaging of the mouse work,</p>
<p>but so the person says,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m the patient in this case,</p>
<p>so I might say, you know, I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>
<p>A donut sounds really good right now,</p>
<p>but craving to me is like,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ll cross the street, cross town,</p>
<p>be late for my meeting, eat three of these,</p>
<p>maybe even hide that from somebody that cares about me</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t want me doing this,</p>
<p>this kind of thing, hide it from myself.</p>
<p>These kinds of behaviors I&rsquo;m projecting,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m fortunate that I have cravings for things in life,</p>
<p>but donuts are not among the more extreme of them.</p>
<p>So this is all happening in real time,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re listening to the cells</p>
<p>the same way you would listen to it</p>
<p>and search for tremor cells.</p>
<p>Exactly, same exact tools.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing that by recording</p>
<p>from a small population of cells in the area?</p>
<p>Yeah, in fact, we do get multi-unit activity,</p>
<p>which is multiple cells,</p>
<p>but we really try to find one, a single unit to listen to.</p>
<p>One neuron.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s just much easier</p>
<p>to understand what that one neuron is doing</p>
<p>versus trying to listen to multiple,</p>
<p>and we also measure local field potential recordings,</p>
<p>but those are analyzed,</p>
<p>which is more of a population response,</p>
<p>thousands of cells.</p>
<p>Kind of chorus of cells.</p>
<p>Exactly, that we measure offline.</p>
<p>The device that we use to sort of treat these patients</p>
<p>or intervene that we&rsquo;re studying,</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t do single unit recordings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only doing these more population responses.</p>
<p>So we correlate what we see in the operating room</p>
<p>at the single unit level to the population response,</p>
<p>but we do that all offline.</p>
<p>I can explain that in a moment.</p>
<p>But yeah, so we try to identify these craving cells.</p>
<p>And because this is a feasibility study</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t be in the operating room</p>
<p>searching for hours and hours and hours,</p>
<p>we do have some sort of,</p>
<p>we have guidelines that we&rsquo;ve set for ourselves</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve developed with the NIH or the FDA</p>
<p>to make sure that what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is feasible and safe as well.</p>
<p>So we will spend a limited time</p>
<p>trying to identify these craving cells.</p>
<p>But another sort of strategy</p>
<p>that we think is really important</p>
<p>is the effect of the stimulation.</p>
<p>So a lot of patients,</p>
<p>and this gets to sort of your question earlier</p>
<p>about what comes first.</p>
<p>A lot of people, when they binge</p>
<p>or they lose control over food,</p>
<p>or seek drugs,</p>
<p>that moment of vulnerability is preceded</p>
<p>by what we call a moment of sort of pre-meal negative effect,</p>
<p>which basically means right before they binge,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re feeling down or they feel stressed or anxious.</p>
<p>And they compensate for that momentary symptom</p>
<p>by binging or losing control over food.</p>
<p>Not everybody meets criteria for a binge.</p>
<p>So I try to specify that we are looking</p>
<p>at loss of control eating specifically</p>
<p>just because the criterion of a binge</p>
<p>is not as critical for us.</p>
<p>So what we want to be able to do</p>
<p>is trigger stimulation</p>
<p>when this craving is detected by the device.</p>
<p>But we trigger it only when the craving is there.</p>
<p>And we believe that if we can sort of</p>
<p>temporarily elevate their mood ever so briefly,</p>
<p>again, this is about five to 10 seconds</p>
<p>of stimulation only,</p>
<p>that perhaps that elevation in mood</p>
<p>could actually sort of disrupt the craving to binge cycle.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a habit, maybe it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>But if you crave and then you binge,</p>
<p>if we can interrupt that with this moment of feeling good,</p>
<p>that might be a really good therapy for a patient.</p>
<p>And in fact, when we do deep brain stimulation</p>
<p>for obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>we can fairly reliably induce a positive affect.</p>
<p>The problem is that it&rsquo;s not sustained.</p>
<p>And the reason it&rsquo;s likely not sustained</p>
<p>is because with obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>we treat that condition with continuous stimulation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not surprising that over time,</p>
<p>the effect kind of goes away.</p>
<p>So when they&rsquo;re in the clinic and we turn the device on,</p>
<p>our patients feel great.</p>
<p>And we feel like we&rsquo;ve solved the problem.</p>
<p>But they call us the next day and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>my depression came back or my OCD hasn&rsquo;t gotten better</p>
<p>and my mood&rsquo;s back to where it was.</p>
<p>Can you get it back to where it was yesterday?</p>
<p>Because that felt great.</p>
<p>The brain loves homeostatic regulation.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>And it does not like to shift patterns.</p>
<p>Regression to the norm.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s sort of a tolerance effect there</p>
<p>that is limiting the effect of continuous stimulation.</p>
<p>And actually in a mouse, if you do continuous stimulation,</p>
<p>the sort of blockade of binge eating goes away.</p>
<p>So actually in a mouse, we&rsquo;ve actually demonstrated,</p>
<p>we published this not too long ago in PNAS,</p>
<p>that if you deliver stimulation intermittently</p>
<p>and only when sort of a craving signal is detected,</p>
<p>so to speak,</p>
<p>that effect will be the most robust and durable.</p>
<p>But if you deliver it continuously,</p>
<p>actually the benefit goes away over time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always encouraged my colleagues</p>
<p>to consider more of an episodic stimulation approach</p>
<p>rather than continuous deep brain stimulation.</p>
<p>But of course, that&rsquo;s for these more episodic conditions.</p>
<p>Whereas these more quote-unquote state disorders,</p>
<p>as I oversimplified earlier,</p>
<p>they might need more of a continuous therapy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s definitely subject</p>
<p>for a lot of research in the future.</p>
<p>So in any case, the goal in the operating room</p>
<p>was to identify a craving cell,</p>
<p>deliver stimulation safely,</p>
<p>but also to capture a moment of elevated mood.</p>
<p>We were able to do that</p>
<p>as we are in our OCD patients as well.</p>
<p>And also to get an intraoperative CAT scan.</p>
<p>We have devices now in the operating room</p>
<p>that allow us to get imaging in real time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fabulous tools that we didn&rsquo;t have 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So we can confirm accuracy.</p>
<p>You can see where the electrode is precisely.</p>
<p>Exactly, with 0.5 millimeters of error.</p>
<p>So super precise, or as precise as we think we need to be.</p>
<p>And we use connectomics.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a tool in brain imaging called tractography,</p>
<p>where we can actually measure circuit connections.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an indirect assay, but we believe it&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>It has its assumptions, like anything in science.</p>
<p>But we can actually map out</p>
<p>where the nucleus accumbens connects</p>
<p>to the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>sort of the cortical control, inhibitory control pathway,</p>
<p>and where that pathway intersects</p>
<p>with the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>And we can target that area structurally.</p>
<p>So those three goals of the surgery</p>
<p>we aim to set out to accomplish.</p>
<p>And we believed if we achieved two of those three,</p>
<p>that we would have a successful result in our early trial.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Given that, at least to me, the non-clinician,</p>
<p>that anorexia is the mirror image of binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>and at least from what I learned,</p>
<p>one of the more deadly psychiatric conditions,</p>
<p>but also quite common.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is it possible that nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>this so-called reward circuit,</p>
<p>is also involved in anorexia,</p>
<p>but somehow it is the resistance to eating,</p>
<p>the craving of the fasted state,</p>
<p>or something like that that&rsquo;s being reinforced?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I ask this for two reasons.</p>
<p>One, because I&rsquo;m genuinely curious about anorexia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve observed anorexia in a number of people I know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a striking thing to see somebody</p>
<p>just resist food despite all better knowledge</p>
<p>of the fact that they&rsquo;re getting quite ill,</p>
<p>maybe even at risk of death.</p>
<p>But the other reason is that</p>
<p>if, in fact, nucleus accumbens is the site</p>
<p>which can harbor cells to promote craving</p>
<p>and craving of fasted states, so to speak,</p>
<p>then that, I think, might tell us something fundamental</p>
<p>about how the brain works,</p>
<p>which is that structures don&rsquo;t control functions per se.</p>
<p>Structures control dynamics of interactions.</p>
<p>Sort of like an orchestra conductor</p>
<p>has a certain number of operations that they perform,</p>
<p>but really their main function</p>
<p>is to coordinate the actions of a lot of things,</p>
<p>not to make sure that the violins always play</p>
<p>in a certain way alongside the oboes.</p>
<p>You can tell I&rsquo;m not a musician here.</p>
<p>I see you have an appreciation for the oboes.</p>
<p>Those usually get left out.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that, the oboes?</p>
<p>Yeah, they usually get ignored.</p>
<p>My partner plays the oboes.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great analogy, by the way.</p>
<p>You know, I make this statement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little controversial,</p>
<p>but I actually think people would understand</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m coming from</p>
<p>across all of these sort of subspecialties of medicine.</p>
<p>But I actually think, especially with obesity,</p>
<p>remember, it&rsquo;s a phenotype that&rsquo;s reflective</p>
<p>often, but not always, of a behavior.</p>
<p>But if you consider patients that have obesity</p>
<p>and they exhibit some sort of compulsion towards food,</p>
<p>so they overeat despite the risk of it,</p>
<p>I think those kinds of patients</p>
<p>are more similar to anorexics than they are different.</p>
<p>Anorexia and obesity are both phenotypes that are,</p>
<p>at least in this specific case of obesity and in anorexia,</p>
<p>a result of a compulsion to either over or undereat</p>
<p>despite the risk.</p>
<p>These types of compulsions are driven by societal pressures,</p>
<p>brain vulnerabilities that are probably more similar</p>
<p>than they are different.</p>
<p>They just happen to manifest differently.</p>
<p>Why they manifest differently</p>
<p>is probably related to each patient&rsquo;s predisposition</p>
<p>or perhaps preference.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard to know.</p>
<p>Like you, I have a personal connection</p>
<p>to these eating disorders, anorexia included,</p>
<p>and yeah, I think it&rsquo;s very scary.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a condition that often instills fear</p>
<p>in psychiatrists because I think,</p>
<p>not everybody, by the way,</p>
<p>I mean, I have some phenomenal psychiatrists</p>
<p>that I work with both at Stanford and at Penn.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also involved in my obesity study</p>
<p>that take care of these patients.</p>
<p>I mean, these are heroes,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of psychiatrists</p>
<p>that are not in this domain that find anorexia scary</p>
<p>for the reason you said.</p>
<p>It has the highest mortality of all psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>That includes depression</p>
<p>because not only can these patients die of suicide,</p>
<p>but they die of metabolic complications</p>
<p>of being underweight.</p>
<p>So it is a scary condition.</p>
<p>I relate with that.</p>
<p>I am trying, over time,</p>
<p>to bridge what I&rsquo;m doing in obesity</p>
<p>and binging disorder to anorexia for two reasons.</p>
<p>One, because I think these problems</p>
<p>are more similar than they are different,</p>
<p>and two, because of the need.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re well-positioned</p>
<p>to sort of tackle anorexia using similar approaches,</p>
<p>not identical, but similar approaches.</p>
<p>The nucleus accumbens has been studied</p>
<p>in patients with anorexia in China.</p>
<p>Actually, my postdoc, my first postdoc,</p>
<p>who I had the honor to train when I was at Stanford</p>
<p>as a neurosurgeon in China before he came to me,</p>
<p>actually was involved in a trial of anorexia</p>
<p>that had some benefits.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s studies in Europe</p>
<p>and elsewhere that have examined preliminarily</p>
<p>the effects of deep brain stimulation</p>
<p>targeting the nucleus accumbens for anorexia.</p>
<p>Colleagues of mine in Canada,</p>
<p>Andres Lozada, who&rsquo;s a wonderful neurosurgeon scientist,</p>
<p>has been studying the effects of going after area 25,</p>
<p>which is directly connected to the nucleus accumbens by,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a monosynaptic connection.</p>
<p>So in a lot of ways, you know,</p>
<p>perhaps delivering stimulation there</p>
<p>could be very similar to delivering stimulation</p>
<p>to the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of one critical inhibitory control circuit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s seen benefits as well.</p>
<p>So I definitely think there&rsquo;s some evidence</p>
<p>that this is an area that we need to be studying.</p>
<p>I think our more episodic approach</p>
<p>with responsive stimulation,</p>
<p>going after sort of a signal in the nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>that seems to be related to the compulsion</p>
<p>to withhold from eating,</p>
<p>I think is what we will be trying to accomplish</p>
<p>in our study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right now just being conceived though.</p>
<p>These studies, they move so slowly</p>
<p>because you have to get a grant</p>
<p>and that grant gets reviewed by the NIH</p>
<p>six months after you submit it,</p>
<p>often gets rejected because it&rsquo;s too innovative</p>
<p>and too high risk.</p>
<p>So then you have to edit it and decrease the risk.</p>
<p>So it takes, my obesity study took two years to get funded.</p>
<p>And I worry about that timeframe</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a lot of time for patients</p>
<p>with anorexia to suffer that I might be able to help</p>
<p>at least in a small sample of patients.</p>
<p>So, but that is the nature of how these things go.</p>
<p>You also have to get FDA approval</p>
<p>to do these kinds of things.</p>
<p>We try to do all of this in parallel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enormous undertaking.</p>
<p>And in a lot of ways we&rsquo;re starting from scratch,</p>
<p>but in some ways we have some preliminary data</p>
<p>to go after this.</p>
<p>So my hope is in about a year,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have a similar trial for anorexia at Penn.</p>
<p>So more to come on that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not the only lab that&rsquo;s trying to go after</p>
<p>because of the clear need, so.</p>
<p>What is the status of non-invasive brain stimulation,</p>
<p>ablation and blocking activity in the brain?</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions</p>
<p>about transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually had that done as a research subject.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>When I was at Berkeley,</p>
<p>Rich Ivory&rsquo;s lab put a coil on my head.</p>
<p>I was tapping my finger in concert to a drum beat.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, because of the stimulation,</p>
<p>it was impossible for me to keep time with the drum beat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty wild experience to not have motor control</p>
<p>and then to have motor control returned</p>
<p>at the flip of a switch</p>
<p>when someone else is controlling the switch.</p>
<p>It makes it especially eerie.</p>
<p>So my understanding is that</p>
<p>transcranial magnetic stimulation is being used</p>
<p>to treat depression and a number of other brain syndromes,</p>
<p>non-invasively, so no drilling through the skull.</p>
<p>Surgeons don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>Surgeons love to cut and drill with purpose, but they do.</p>
<p>With purpose, yes.</p>
<p>But my understanding is that</p>
<p>the spatial precision isn&rsquo;t that great.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Ultrasound is something I hear a lot about these days.</p>
<p>And my understanding is that ultrasound can allow researchers</p>
<p>and clinicians to stimulate specific brain areas,</p>
<p>perhaps with more precision.</p>
<p>Maybe you could just give us a brief coverage</p>
<p>of what those are being used for.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on these forms of non-invasive,</p>
<p>meaning no flipping open of a piece of the skull,</p>
<p>type brain stimulation and blockade of brain activity?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I wanted to clarify also,</p>
<p>these surgeries generally don&rsquo;t, by the way,</p>
<p>require a full craniotomy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually just a small opening</p>
<p>about the size of a dime in the bone.</p>
<p>So just to clarify.</p>
<p>Painless too, right?</p>
<p>Usually without pain.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little bit of scalp numbing.</p>
<p>We give a scalp block</p>
<p>and the patients are getting IV sedation.</p>
<p>So they, in general, don&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
<p>And if they do, they tell me</p>
<p>and we give them more local anesthetic,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re usually asleep during that part.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s minimally invasive, but in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no such thing as a minimally invasive procedure</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a misnomer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad to hear you say that.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I am not one of those neurosurgeons</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve probably encountered</p>
<p>and we have mutual friends that,</p>
<p>and these mutual friends</p>
<p>are some of my favorite people in neurosurgery</p>
<p>and they probably actually think more like me than not,</p>
<p>but there are neurosurgeons that you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>And this is true for all surgeries.</p>
<p>They really, in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>they think what they do is sort of the ground truth</p>
<p>or closer to the ground truth.</p>
<p>And I get that,</p>
<p>probing with purpose.</p>
<p>I actually really like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna use that if you don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just describing what you do.</p>
<p>But I actually have always said this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it publicly, I&rsquo;ve said it to my boss,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this to my team.</p>
<p>We need to embrace non-invasive approaches.</p>
<p>Some of them are a little fluffy,</p>
<p>fluffy in that we don&rsquo;t understand how they work.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t necessarily understand</p>
<p>how deep brain stimulation works, by the way.</p>
<p>But because we don&rsquo;t know exactly how they work,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not as precise as we would like them to be.</p>
<p>So we have work to do there.</p>
<p>And I actually think that work is doable</p>
<p>and actually underway.</p>
<p>At Stanford, we have great collaborators</p>
<p>that I think are doing this,</p>
<p>people like Nolan Williams and Connor Liston</p>
<p>at Cornell and others.</p>
<p>I think that TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation,</p>
<p>it is FDA approved for depression, by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also FDA approved for OCD and for nicotine addiction.</p>
<p>Where do they put the coil for those three things,</p>
<p>or more or less?</p>
<p>Yeah, so they put it over,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s always on the scalp and over the frontal lobe.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different parts of the frontal lobe</p>
<p>that have been demonstrated to be a little better</p>
<p>or a little bit worse.</p>
<p>But what the FDA has approved for depression,</p>
<p>I believe is similar to what&rsquo;s been approved for OCD.</p>
<p>But for addiction, I believe it is a different target,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;d have to ask our TMS experts on that.</p>
<p>Can they direct the transcranial magnetic stimulation</p>
<p>deep below the cortex?</p>
<p>They try.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re actually studying this in OCD patients now.</p>
<p>As a part of our invasive trial,</p>
<p>we are trying to pull patients from a TMS trial</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in parallel to what we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>all funded by the Foundation for OCD Research,</p>
<p>where we believe we can use TMS to define a circuit</p>
<p>that if modulated improves OCD, albeit temporarily.</p>
<p>And in those patients, if it&rsquo;s temporary,</p>
<p>they would be appropriate for an invasive study.</p>
<p>So something we&rsquo;re actively working on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed that neurosurgeons</p>
<p>need to be part of the discussion</p>
<p>with these non-invasive approaches.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to do them,</p>
<p>but I think we can help make them more precise</p>
<p>and to probe non-invasively with purpose</p>
<p>rather than this more kind of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a non-invasive blast effect kind of, you know,</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t imagine how that is gonna be as effective</p>
<p>as probing with purpose,</p>
<p>but you can do that non-invasively as well.</p>
<p>And I think we need to do better in that way.</p>
<p>I do believe that&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>and I think people are actively trying to do it.</p>
<p>Getting deep in the brain with TMS</p>
<p>I think will always be hard,</p>
<p>but you can get there indirectly</p>
<p>by using connectivity assays</p>
<p>and targeting superficial structures</p>
<p>that have high connectivity to deep structures.</p>
<p>So for example, perhaps one day there will be a TMS target</p>
<p>for anorexia and obesity.</p>
<p>If we are scratching the surface</p>
<p>with invasive approaches to these problems,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re even doing less with the brain stimulation.</p>
<p>So we have so much work to do there.</p>
<p>Eating disorders and TMS have been so,</p>
<p>sort of scarcely studied,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;ve been such little research done in that space.</p>
<p>And so it is an area that we need to work on.</p>
<p>For the obvious reason, for example,</p>
<p>in a patient with anorexia, just thinking practically,</p>
<p>you know, placing a device in a patient</p>
<p>who is significantly underweight</p>
<p>might not be the best approach.</p>
<p>You know, wound erosion and issues like that could come up.</p>
<p>So developing a non-invasive approach I think is critical.</p>
<p>The problem is, where do we target?</p>
<p>And so the only way to answer that, I think reliably,</p>
<p>is to accept that we have to get into the brain</p>
<p>before we&rsquo;re out of the brain.</p>
<p>And with these kinds of conditions,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only just starting to get into the brain, you know?</p>
<p>So I worry that we&rsquo;re a long way away</p>
<p>from a non-invasive approach that really works consistently.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt, but I want to make sure</p>
<p>we touch on ultrasound.</p>
<p>Yes, sure.</p>
<p>Historically, it seemed that there was a bit more permission</p>
<p>for people to probe around in the human brain.</p>
<p>I sometimes refer the podcast to some of these papers</p>
<p>that were done allowing patients</p>
<p>to self-stimulate in the brain.</p>
<p>These are work done in the 60s,</p>
<p>and now his name escapes me, Robert.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s a couple of papers published in Science</p>
<p>allowing patients to stimulate</p>
<p>a couple of different brain areas,</p>
<p>asking which ones they preferred.</p>
<p>And I was always shocked and slightly intrigued</p>
<p>by the fact that the brain area</p>
<p>that all three of these patients,</p>
<p>who I don&rsquo;t think had any syndromes,</p>
<p>I think they volunteered for these experiments.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you could do this anymore.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Regulatory was not the same as it is now.</p>
<p>Things have changed, fortunately.</p>
<p>But all three of them seem to like</p>
<p>some midline thalamic structure,</p>
<p>which for those listening is just an area</p>
<p>kind of in the dead center of the brain, more or less,</p>
<p>that evoked a sense of kind of frustration and anger,</p>
<p>which surprised me because I would have thought,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s Robert Heath, these experiments,</p>
<p>rather than patients preferring to stimulate areas</p>
<p>that evoke laughter or joy</p>
<p>or a feeling of drunkenness or delight.</p>
<p>It also explains a lot of what I observe in social media,</p>
<p>this sort of kind of people repeatedly engaging in battles</p>
<p>that are kind of trivial.</p>
<p>It seems like frustration and anger</p>
<p>might have its own reward circuitry.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t want to go too far down that rabbit hole,</p>
<p>but it-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep one and kind of gets to our nature as humans</p>
<p>and what we find interesting or rewarding.</p>
<p>But the inability to probe around the brain in a safe way</p>
<p>without the need for somebody to be very sick</p>
<p>would be, I think, would be enormously powerful</p>
<p>and at least in my mind, if I were in charge,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not, would offer the opportunity</p>
<p>to really come to an understanding</p>
<p>about how the human brain works</p>
<p>without all these issues</p>
<p>of how to translate for mouse studies.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s huge value to animal studies,</p>
<p>as we both agree,</p>
<p>but so many of the things that we want to know</p>
<p>about the human brain involve asking the person,</p>
<p>hey, what do you feel when that set of neurons is stimulated</p>
<p>and what don&rsquo;t you feel?</p>
<p>And a mouse, we can ask and ask,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not going to tell us,</p>
<p>and they do tell us, they&rsquo;re not going to tell us in English.</p>
<p>So how do we overcome this challenge?</p>
<p>But first, ultrasound, or if you prefer after ultrasound,</p>
<p>is ultrasound going to be really useful</p>
<p>toward solving these clinical issues and these basic issues?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think, let&rsquo;s start with ultrasound</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll come back to it.</p>
<p>So ultrasound right now, transcranial magnetic guide,</p>
<p>magnetic resonance guided focus ultrasound.</p>
<p>So this is an FDA approved method</p>
<p>to deliver an ablation to the brain non-invasively.</p>
<p>There are researchers, myself included,</p>
<p>that are trying to use transcranial magnetic guided,</p>
<p>magnetic resonance guided focus ultrasound</p>
<p>or MRI guided focus ultrasound</p>
<p>to use it in a modulatory way, not just as an ablation,</p>
<p>but to drive neuronal activity or inhibit it perhaps.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still learning how to do that.</p>
<p>There are trials that are trying to understand</p>
<p>if you can use ultrasound to open the blood brain barrier.</p>
<p>So you can deliver a medication to that specific area,</p>
<p>perhaps for a brain tumor or something like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very exciting field</p>
<p>and it is FDA approved for tremor right now.</p>
<p>And so I actually do it routinely</p>
<p>for patients with tremor with Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or essential tremor.</p>
<p>And so I love doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often just kind of a miracle</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no incision.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to place an electrode into the brain</p>
<p>to achieve a similar result.</p>
<p>How early into the pathology of Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>can someone think about approaching this?</p>
<p>So for instance, if somebody has a parent or a sibling</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re developing some resting tremor,</p>
<p>obviously they should talk to a neurologist,</p>
<p>but a neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>but this non-invasive approach could be incredible for them</p>
<p>as opposed to just only taking drugs</p>
<p>to increase dopamine levels.</p>
<p>Yeah, so depending on the reason you have tremor</p>
<p>would dictate the kind of medication you would use.</p>
<p>It could be Parkinson&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s not, it might be essential tremor.</p>
<p>Essential tremor is 10 times as common as Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Essential tremor is the most common neurologic condition</p>
<p>in patients over the age of 70.</p>
<p>We often aren&rsquo;t aware of that.</p>
<p>People with essential tremor</p>
<p>feel they have their forgotten disease</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no Michael J. Fox for essential tremor.</p>
<p>I sent a letter to Bill-</p>
<p>Sorry, is it essential tremor or-</p>
<p>Essential tremor, yep, E-S-S-E-N-T-I-A-L.</p>
<p>I actually sent a letter to Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve observed tremor in him,</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s actually disclosed that he has it,</p>
<p>and I hoped he&rsquo;d become a champion</p>
<p>for patients with essential tremor.</p>
<p>Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor does as well.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also public about it,</p>
<p>but I was not able to get them eager</p>
<p>to become the champion for this condition.</p>
<p>But like Michael J. Fox,</p>
<p>these patients need a champion like that.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a bit of a forgotten disease.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because of the FDA approval</p>
<p>of focus ultrasound for tremor,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to get some attention for sure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fabulously effective for these patients.</p>
<p>It treats patients on one side,</p>
<p>usually their dominant hand or their worst hand.</p>
<p>And it really speaks to the fact that,</p>
<p>wow, you can deliver noninvasively an ablation to the brain</p>
<p>in a hypothesized zone</p>
<p>that we think is related to the problem at hand.</p>
<p>And at least with tremor, it works really well.</p>
<p>Could this be effective for psychiatric disease,</p>
<p>obesity, eating disorders?</p>
<p>Well, perhaps.</p>
<p>Actually, that would be the ideal.</p>
<p>The problem is we don&rsquo;t know where to do the ablation.</p>
<p>There is a trial that we would like to do for OCD</p>
<p>where we would deliver an ablation</p>
<p>to the same area of the brain</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been delivering ablations to for years</p>
<p>for patients with OCD.</p>
<p>And it helps a bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called a capsulotomy.</p>
<p>But really the outcome is probably gonna be about the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice method because it&rsquo;s noninvasive,</p>
<p>but we need to find a new target for these conditions.</p>
<p>And because of the common denominator</p>
<p>of the urge despite the risk, sort of that compulsion,</p>
<p>perhaps it could be the same target.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I would argue we need to do these</p>
<p>modulatory experiments,</p>
<p>either with a device or with invasive recordings</p>
<p>to better understand where these problems are coming from</p>
<p>to define where we should do an ultrasound treatment.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Historically, without much regulation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve probed the brain.</p>
<p>The problem, we can&rsquo;t learn a lot</p>
<p>from those experiments now.</p>
<p>Well, in this way, at least.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly where those electrodes were.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have MRI scanning or high quality CAT scanning</p>
<p>to know where those electrodes were with certainty.</p>
<p>And we know two or three millimeters matters.</p>
<p>And we also didn&rsquo;t have the tools to place electrodes</p>
<p>in a precise way back then.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t learn a lot</p>
<p>from those experiments right now.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sort of redesigning them.</p>
<p>And there is a way to do it now.</p>
<p>Patients with epilepsy benefit from this all the time.</p>
<p>There has been a revolution in America.</p>
<p>It was in Europe before it was in America</p>
<p>where we would do stereo encephalography,</p>
<p>which is basically like doing an EEG</p>
<p>of patients with epilepsy, but with invasive electrodes.</p>
<p>And we would place tiny little wires,</p>
<p>less than a millimeter in diameter,</p>
<p>all throughout the brain into parts of the brain</p>
<p>that we believe are involved in seizures.</p>
<p>And we would admit the patients to the hospital</p>
<p>and figure out where the seizures were starting</p>
<p>and propagating.</p>
<p>And then we could stimulate these electrodes</p>
<p>to see if there was a symptom that was important.</p>
<p>And I try to identify a region</p>
<p>that we thought we could either remove surgically,</p>
<p>ablate with a laser, or put a stimulator in it, perhaps.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s commonplace now for epilepsy.</p>
<p>And it works extremely well, and it&rsquo;s very safe.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s still a brain procedure,</p>
<p>but the complication rate is surprisingly low,</p>
<p>quite honestly, for the amount of electrodes that we place.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s extremely well tolerated.</p>
<p>Most of these patients leave the hospital</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even feel like they&rsquo;ve had surgery.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually a lot of interest</p>
<p>in using that procedure to study mental health disorders.</p>
<p>We are trying to do it for patients</p>
<p>with obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re awaiting an FDA decision on that.</p>
<p>But actually, I credit our colleagues at Baylor</p>
<p>and at UCSF for studying this already.</p>
<p>We have fabulous colleagues at UCSF</p>
<p>that have studied depression using this type of approach.</p>
<p>A mutual friend of ours, Eddie Chang,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a wonderful friend and colleague,</p>
<p>somebody I&rsquo;ve emulated for many years as well,</p>
<p>and the psychiatry team at UCSF</p>
<p>have worked together on this,</p>
<p>sort of bringing together the epilepsy technique</p>
<p>and the psychiatry expertise</p>
<p>to study how we could better target electrodes</p>
<p>in depression.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you, if they have a consistent target,</p>
<p>perhaps there it becomes an ultrasound target.</p>
<p>But right now, the approach is a bit more reversible</p>
<p>because you can always shut that electrode off</p>
<p>or even remove the electrode</p>
<p>if perhaps it&rsquo;s not in the optimal location</p>
<p>to treat the depression.</p>
<p>But actually, after a large volume of cases,</p>
<p>perhaps they could pool that data</p>
<p>to develop a new ultrasound target for depression.</p>
<p>I think that would be fabulous</p>
<p>and probably is their long-term goal,</p>
<p>not to speak for them,</p>
<p>but that would be something that I&rsquo;m sure is on their radar.</p>
<p>And Baylor&rsquo;s trying to do the same thing for depression.</p>
<p>Their approaches are a little bit different,</p>
<p>but a similar tool to try to understand depression.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re working with all of these types of colleagues,</p>
<p>some of these are our friends,</p>
<p>to try to bring this to OCD as well.</p>
<p>And it makes sense to try to do this for addiction</p>
<p>and obesity and anorexia.</p>
<p>You might ask, well, why aren&rsquo;t you doing this</p>
<p>for obesity right now in our study?</p>
<p>And the reason is that we&rsquo;ve developed a target for obesity</p>
<p>and binge eating disorder developed out of mice</p>
<p>that we believe is relevant for the human state</p>
<p>because you can model this problem in a mouse</p>
<p>a bit better than you can model depression or OCD.</p>
<p>So we feel like we can rely on the preclinical studies more,</p>
<p>whereas with these perhaps more,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say more complicated,</p>
<p>but more human mental health conditions</p>
<p>that are hard to model in a mouse,</p>
<p>you really have to study it in the human.</p>
<p>And you can perhaps start in an epileptic patient,</p>
<p>a patient that has electrodes</p>
<p>and try to provoke a depressed state</p>
<p>or study epileptics like Dr. Chang has done</p>
<p>that have comorbid depression, for example,</p>
<p>and that can really validate this approach as well.</p>
<p>But in the end, it&rsquo;s getting into the human brain</p>
<p>that we need to do in the disease specifically</p>
<p>that will eventually lead to a non-invasive approach,</p>
<p>either a lesion or a modulatory approach.</p>
<p>Modulatory would be like TMS</p>
<p>or lesion approach would be with ultrasound.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, because there are many, many millions</p>
<p>of people suffering from depression, eating disorders,</p>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s and essential tremor, et cetera.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I should say,</p>
<p>based on everything you&rsquo;ve told me thus far,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing to me that any pharmacologic treatments work</p>
<p>because of how systemic they are</p>
<p>and impacting serotonergic neurons over here</p>
<p>and dopaminergic neurons over there</p>
<p>and not targeting any specific batch of cells.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense</p>
<p>as to why all the side effects exist.</p>
<p>But earlier you said something</p>
<p>that really grabbed my attention I want to come back to,</p>
<p>which is that if people can be made to feel</p>
<p>or make themselves feel just a little bit better,</p>
<p>a little less anxious just prior to a craving episode</p>
<p>or a binge episode,</p>
<p>maybe even if people can become better</p>
<p>at detecting their own internal states</p>
<p>and when they&rsquo;re kind of veering toward a binge</p>
<p>or veering toward using a drug</p>
<p>or maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking.</p>
<p>Based on what you said earlier,</p>
<p>that those kind of pre-behavioral states</p>
<p>on the kind of drift on the steering,</p>
<p>those sound like powerful levels of awareness,</p>
<p>at least for now, until we have specific sites in the brain</p>
<p>that we can target non-invasive methods</p>
<p>that could be deployed to millions and millions of people.</p>
<p>It seems like that awareness seems like</p>
<p>maybe among the best tools that people could develop.</p>
<p>Yes, I 100% agree with you.</p>
<p>So for the person with OCD</p>
<p>or who suffers from anorexia or binge eating disorder</p>
<p>and to their clinicians,</p>
<p>I just want to highlight that you said that.</p>
<p>I mean, again, I&rsquo;m not a clinician.</p>
<p>I always say this, I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything,</p>
<p>I profess things.</p>
<p>But awareness of one&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>seems immensely powerful in this context.</p>
<p>And after all, it is the clinical probe that you use.</p>
<p>Because if, let&rsquo;s say the patient were to lie to you</p>
<p>about their experience of what happens in their mind</p>
<p>when you stimulate, you could basically the whole thing,</p>
<p>the whole surgery, the whole procedure</p>
<p>could go badly wrong.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s up to the patient to be, of course, honest with you</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re incentivized to do that.</p>
<p>But to be honest with themselves about,</p>
<p>ah, I&rsquo;ve gone all day without a binge,</p>
<p>but the smell of a donut or the thought of a donut</p>
<p>is starting to have a particular allure.</p>
<p>That awareness seems like an incredibly powerful thing</p>
<p>to own and to build and cultivate.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve always thought that if we can improve awareness,</p>
<p>we can improve outcomes.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably true for many of these patients.</p>
<p>The problem I think comes down to the fact</p>
<p>that some of these patients are so resistant to treatment.</p>
<p>And the patients that we see as a surgeon, for example,</p>
<p>are the patients that they&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>certainly have tried medications,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve tried behavioral management.</p>
<p>They are aware of their problem</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve shown that to us.</p>
<p>They can tell us when they&rsquo;re craving,</p>
<p>but despite the craving and despite being involved</p>
<p>in this invasive brain surgical trial,</p>
<p>highly first in human novel study,</p>
<p>which I think will have a positive effect,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still experimental.</p>
<p>They still can&rsquo;t stop themselves.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re sort of as made aware as could possibly be.</p>
<p>Did I use grammar there correctly?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re as aware as they could possibly be</p>
<p>and they still lose control.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had this studied in the lab.</p>
<p>So we will bring patients to the laboratory</p>
<p>with this implanted device</p>
<p>to try to provoke this electrographic electrical signal</p>
<p>that can be detected by the actual device</p>
<p>that will stimulate them when they&rsquo;re at home.</p>
<p>But before we actually initiate stimulation,</p>
<p>we want to see can this device</p>
<p>detect this craving cell signal,</p>
<p>which is gonna be different</p>
<p>than what we saw in the operating room</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a single cell.</p>
<p>But these devices,</p>
<p>these electrodes are about a millimeter in diameter</p>
<p>instead of like a 10th of a millimeter,</p>
<p>which is what we use in the operating room.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re only hearing or detecting,</p>
<p>I should say thousands of cells responses.</p>
<p>And we actually have a way to provoke binges.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a mood provocation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very well validated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like provoking seizures</p>
<p>in the epilepsy monitoring unit,</p>
<p>but here in the sort of psychiatric monitoring unit</p>
<p>or the food monitoring unit,</p>
<p>we actually have a psychiatrist</p>
<p>and eating disorder specialist come</p>
<p>and induce a mood that is related</p>
<p>to each patient&rsquo;s sort of self-described binge episode.</p>
<p>So the psychiatrist comes in</p>
<p>and provokes a feeling</p>
<p>that can evoke the negative behavior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So that we can video and synchronize the video</p>
<p>to the brain signal recordings.</p>
<p>The patients all wear an eye tracker</p>
<p>so we can see what they&rsquo;re eating at all times</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re looking at specifically.</p>
<p>And that allows us to have</p>
<p>the best temporal resolution possible</p>
<p>to understand what is happening right before the bite.</p>
<p>And even under video surveillance</p>
<p>through a one-way mirror in a laboratory setting,</p>
<p>when patients are very well aware</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re there to be studied if they&rsquo;re going to binge,</p>
<p>they still do.</p>
<p>And we believe they do because they just can&rsquo;t control it</p>
<p>as aware as they are of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably because they&rsquo;re the most severe.</p>
<p>So I think if we can improve awareness,</p>
<p>not just the societal awareness</p>
<p>that I was talking about earlier,</p>
<p>but the patient awareness around their problem,</p>
<p>I think that could be a powerful way</p>
<p>to help so many of these patients.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of the role of cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>The problem with cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>or I should say the limitation of it,</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t have any problem with it,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful treatment,</p>
<p>is that if you stop it,</p>
<p>many of these patients go back to their old behaviors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say old habits,</p>
<p>but it might be a habit, but the old behaviors.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the problem is it&rsquo;s not necessarily lasting</p>
<p>in the absence of continued cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>Some people can benefit from it long-term, but some can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I think in the less severe patients,</p>
<p>improving awareness, key.</p>
<p>But in these really refractory patients,</p>
<p>this is kind of like, this is the disease.</p>
<p>Despite the awareness, they can&rsquo;t control themselves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to restore,</p>
<p>is that improved ability to control their behavior.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a role for machines</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence here?</p>
<p>There are a couple of laboratories up</p>
<p>at the University of Washington</p>
<p>that are using particular signature patterns within voice</p>
<p>to try and help people who are suicidally depressed</p>
<p>know when they&rsquo;re headed towards an episode</p>
<p>before they even can consciously know.</p>
<p>So this gets right down to issues of free will</p>
<p>and whether or not machines can be smarter than we are.</p>
<p>But one could argue that some of the search algorithms</p>
<p>on Google and other search engines</p>
<p>are actually more aware of our preferences than we are.</p>
<p>Basically what these are,</p>
<p>these are devices that are listening to people talk all day.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also paying attention to patterns of breathing</p>
<p>and how well people slept, et cetera,</p>
<p>integrating a huge number of cues</p>
<p>and then signaling somebody with a yellow light,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re headed into a depressive episode.</p>
<p>The person might say, oh, I feel fine,</p>
<p>or I feel pretty good.</p>
<p>This is kind of baseline state for me.</p>
<p>And they say, ah, this is where you were</p>
<p>preceding the last episode</p>
<p>that took you down a deep, dark trench</p>
<p>and it took months to get out of.</p>
<p>I wonder whether or not some of these devices</p>
<p>could help with the sorts of things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about today.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said we have to get in the brain</p>
<p>before we get out of it.</p>
<p>And if we get in the brain</p>
<p>and understand what these signals look like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll know what those non-invasive signals are.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible that we are</p>
<p>scientifically sophisticated enough</p>
<p>to use machine learning</p>
<p>and sort of this kind of bot technique</p>
<p>to anticipate when somebody is going to be highly impulsive.</p>
<p>You know, suicide is the most dangerous impulse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that is</p>
<p>immensely a focus of the lab is impulsivity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked mostly about compulsion,</p>
<p>being going after a reward or the urge despite the risk.</p>
<p>Impulsivity is similar, but different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of going after something a little bit,</p>
<p>if you model impulsivity in a mouse,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s related to going after a food reward</p>
<p>without the sort of paired tone</p>
<p>that the mouse is supposed to wait for.</p>
<p>The mouse doesn&rsquo;t want to wait anymore.</p>
<p>They just go after the food.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been that mouse.</p>
<p>Yeah, we all have been.</p>
<p>We could all relate with this to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s the spectrum.</p>
<p>So in any case, non sequitur,</p>
<p>but I certainly think that there is a way</p>
<p>to use our own body&rsquo;s physiology</p>
<p>to anticipate when these impulses are coming online.</p>
<p>How best to do that,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re just scratching the surface,</p>
<p>but these are the kinds of solutions we need.</p>
<p>Some of these problems are of epidemic proportions,</p>
<p>largest public health problems in this country,</p>
<p>in this world, obesity, opiate crisis, depression,</p>
<p>suicidality, I mean, that&rsquo;s like a third of our country,</p>
<p>maybe more, probably more, if you think about it.</p>
<p>And a colleague of ours at Stanford Psychiatry</p>
<p>told me something that still just blows my mind,</p>
<p>which is that something like 75%</p>
<p>of the antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication</p>
<p>that exists in the world is consumed in the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Which is, I mean, that&rsquo;s an outrageous number.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do have an obsession in this country for pharmacy.</p>
<p>And the pharmaceutical industry is very powerful here</p>
<p>and probably related to some aspect of capitalism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m capitalistic and just like everybody else,</p>
<p>but I do worry about that a little bit.</p>
<p>But we tend to over-prescribe,</p>
<p>and I think we, as patients, tend to over-want medication.</p>
<p>We like quick solutions,</p>
<p>and sometimes medications provide it, sometimes not,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re often just a Band-Aid.</p>
<p>Depends on the problem, of course.</p>
<p>But I agree that we need scalable solutions.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only gonna be able to treat the most severe of patients</p>
<p>with these problems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only done about 200,000</p>
<p>deep brain stimulation surgeries ever.</p>
<p>So, I mean, the problem we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>is 50 million Americans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no possibility</p>
<p>that surgeons can address that problem.</p>
<p>But we could help inspire an initiative</p>
<p>to go after that kind of problem</p>
<p>or help make it more rigorous.</p>
<p>Because the last thing we need is some sort of wearable,</p>
<p>fancy tool that wastes people&rsquo;s money and time.</p>
<p>We need real therapies for these things.</p>
<p>Not that these devices that we&rsquo;re discussing are not.</p>
<p>I think, actually, there&rsquo;s lots of promise.</p>
<p>We use machine learning in the lab all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an electrical engineer</p>
<p>or the computational neuroscientist doing this type of work.</p>
<p>I just help develop the hypotheses around it</p>
<p>and help fundraise around it.</p>
<p>But I definitely think there&rsquo;s a future for it.</p>
<p>I suspect we&rsquo;re scratching the surface</p>
<p>on how best to do it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about your hands.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>All the neurosurgeons I know</p>
<p>are very faithfully protect their hands.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s talk about-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because hand insurance is too expensive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m guessing that you all are not the ones</p>
<p>to reach into the garbage disposal,</p>
<p>even if your eye is on the switch</p>
<p>to make sure that that isn&rsquo;t going to get turned on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just too precious.</p>
<p>They are your livelihood.</p>
<p>And earlier, we talked about deadlifts.</p>
<p>There are other forms of exercise.</p>
<p>There are things like tennis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s drawing and painting,</p>
<p>a full range of things that one can do with their hands.</p>
<p>Use your imagination, folks.</p>
<p>Is it true that neurosurgeons</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do any really like heavy grip activity</p>
<p>because it can refine the motor circuits</p>
<p>in the brain and elsewhere</p>
<p>that can throw off their neurosurgery game?</p>
<p>I would say that many neurosurgeons</p>
<p>avoid activities that put their hands at risk.</p>
<p>Another one, by the way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an annual softball tournament</p>
<p>that neurosurgeons come to in New York City,</p>
<p>in Central Park.</p>
<p>With a very softball.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Well, actually, it&rsquo;s actually a very typical hard softball.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they call it softball.</p>
<p>And actually, two close colleagues of mine</p>
<p>have gotten injured at that tournament.</p>
<p>Maybe this is, it&rsquo;s also, I must say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m poking fun,</p>
<p>but for those of you who are going</p>
<p>in the medical profession,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also one of the more,</p>
<p>how should I say this?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m just gonna say it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a steep hierarchy of training in neurosurgery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain harshness that&rsquo;s been conveyed to me</p>
<p>about the training,</p>
<p>much like astronaut training, to be totally fair.</p>
<p>And so maybe this is a tactic to weed out</p>
<p>either the younger or the older generation.</p>
<p>This is evolution, right?</p>
<p>We have to evolve and-</p>
<p>We are weak in medical training.</p>
<p>We have the weak, I guess.</p>
<p>Well, I can say that one of the individuals</p>
<p>that got injured is one of the more senior surgeons</p>
<p>that I work with now,</p>
<p>and is one of the best athletes that I know.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s definitely not weak,</p>
<p>but you can get injured playing these sports.</p>
<p>And that being said, I can tell you briefly,</p>
<p>is I think that, you know, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>My mother came to me recently.</p>
<p>She has osteopenia.</p>
<p>And she told me, her doctor told her</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not allowed to do deadlifts.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not telling you you should do deadlifts.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t exactly understand the relationship.</p>
<p>But I can say that I do think,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a little story here.</p>
<p>The reason why I&rsquo;m being a little hesitant</p>
<p>to confirm that I agree with you on the deadlifts</p>
<p>is when I was operating,</p>
<p>this was when I was at Stanford University operating.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>we get an intraoperative CAT scan</p>
<p>to confirm accuracy of our lectures.</p>
<p>I do this for all of my surgeries.</p>
<p>When I was reviewing that CAT scan,</p>
<p>the x-ray technician looked at me and said,</p>
<p>whispered into my ear.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, your posture is really bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>Your physical posture while doing your surgeries.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I looked at him and I kind of wanted to say</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t curse, but yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing it intermittently during our conversation</p>
<p>because he made me realize</p>
<p>that I really did have bad posture.</p>
<p>And we kind of had a little brief aside</p>
<p>and I learned he was a personal trainer</p>
<p>and his name was Zach.</p>
<p>And he said to me, your posture is weak because,</p>
<p>or your posture is poor because you&rsquo;re weak.</p>
<p>You need to strengthen your body and strengthen your core.</p>
<p>I was like, how?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, powerlifting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m a little hesitant to do this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you, I started very slowly</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t prescribe powerlifting to everybody</p>
<p>for the exact reason you said.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve gotten hurt doing it, by the way.</p>
<p>But I do think, I wish I started a little younger</p>
<p>and I would argue that with close supervision</p>
<p>and very well, if you have a very experienced trainer,</p>
<p>which I would argue if you&rsquo;re a neurosurgeon or an astronaut</p>
<p>or have a highly specialized profession</p>
<p>where you need your limbs to function,</p>
<p>dentists, things like that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna take something on like this,</p>
<p>it really needs to be extremely carefully supervised.</p>
<p>And I can tell you that my trainer had a profound impact</p>
<p>on my life and my posture and my physical health.</p>
<p>And so we did deadlift, I&rsquo;ll admit.</p>
<p>So when you brought it up, I kind of chuckled to myself,</p>
<p>but yes, I have gotten mildly hurt deadlifting,</p>
<p>but it was when I was doing it by myself</p>
<p>and I was kind of cocky and I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention.</p>
<p>But when I was with him and he was all over my technique,</p>
<p>it actually was the most efficient way for me</p>
<p>to feel stronger and it improved my posture significantly.</p>
<p>And I miss him since I left California.</p>
<p>I have a new trainer in Philadelphia who&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>but, and I still deadlift occasionally with him,</p>
<p>but I can say I am opposed to deadlifting callously,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re extremely well monitored</p>
<p>by an experienced personal trainer or weightlifter,</p>
<p>I think it could be a great exercise.</p>
<p>Great, I love to be wrong in this case,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a huge proponent</p>
<p>and on the podcast you go on and on.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so much data now pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that 180 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio,</p>
<p>kind of jogging, cycling, swimming type behavior</p>
<p>is very healthy for everybody.</p>
<p>And we should all be doing that, at least that.</p>
<p>Yes, I need to as well.</p>
<p>And that resistance training on the order of,</p>
<p>you know, six hard sets per muscle group per week</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s really important just to offset</p>
<p>deterioration of muscles and skeletal function</p>
<p>and tendon strength.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just to maintain,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking about all out sets to absolute failure,</p>
<p>but as you pointed out with proper form.</p>
<p>So even the neurosurgeons are doing this,</p>
<p>which I think is wonderful.</p>
<p>As a final question, but one that I think really,</p>
<p>or maybe second to final question,</p>
<p>earlier I commented on the remarkable calm,</p>
<p>at least perceived calm of neurosurgeons.</p>
<p>It could be cause or it could be effect of the training,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s obvious to me why one would want that trait</p>
<p>in their neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want a hyperactive,</p>
<p>certainly not an impulsive neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>given that the margins of error are so,</p>
<p>so tiny in spatial scale</p>
<p>and probably on the temporal scale too.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want people doing things in time</p>
<p>that are being spontaneous at all.</p>
<p>Do you think that this branch of medicine that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>selects for people that at least can know how to control</p>
<p>any kind of fluctuations in autonomic arousal?</p>
<p>They can calm themselves in real time.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a specific question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never operated on the human brain,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;ve had the privilege</p>
<p>of being in the operating room and seeing this</p>
<p>with some of our experiments with people in VR.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a remarkable thing.</p>
<p>I wish for everybody that would get this experience</p>
<p>at some point, not hopefully as a patient,</p>
<p>unless they have a need, but to observe it.</p>
<p>But what was just striking to me</p>
<p>is the various stereotype behaviors of the surgeon.</p>
<p>And when I did surgeries as a graduate student,</p>
<p>as a postdoc in the brains of other types of animals,</p>
<p>I would find, for instance,</p>
<p>that if I started to tremble a little bit,</p>
<p>if I tapped my left foot,</p>
<p>that my hand would stabilize a bit,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this kind of need to move the body</p>
<p>or one feels the impulse.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s my Tourette&rsquo;s-like compulsions again.</p>
<p>But that one can kind of siphon off some of that energy</p>
<p>into another limb so that you could remain precise.</p>
<p>So are these sorts of things that I&rsquo;m talking about,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s entirely my imagination,</p>
<p>but are these the sorts of things</p>
<p>that one learns as a neurosurgeon?</p>
<p>How to still the body and still the mind?</p>
<p>Do you have a meditative practice?</p>
<p>When you go into the operating room,</p>
<p>if you had a particularly challenging morning</p>
<p>or a poor night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>do you have tools that you use to calibrate yourself</p>
<p>and get yourself into the zone?</p>
<p>I think this would be very interesting for people</p>
<p>to get some insight into,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t want to be a neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>Yeah, I completely agree.</p>
<p>And I appreciate the earlier reference to neurosurgeons</p>
<p>as astronauts,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve also heard us compared to cowboys before,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a little bit less flattering.</p>
<p>Some of what we do surgically</p>
<p>really does require a substantial amount of confidence.</p>
<p>And that confidence hopefully comes</p>
<p>from years of training and experience.</p>
<p>You always worry that the confidence is sort of misplaced,</p>
<p>and that is problematic.</p>
<p>Luckily, you so rarely see that</p>
<p>because our training is so rigorous.</p>
<p>We have a board of,</p>
<p>American Board of Neurological Surgeons</p>
<p>that sort of allows and assesses surgeons</p>
<p>to continue practice and holds us to a really high bar.</p>
<p>I do think it tends to attract a certain personality.</p>
<p>In my subspecialty as a deep brain stimulation surgeon,</p>
<p>we call it stereotactic and functional neurosurgery.</p>
<p>Some people have likened us</p>
<p>to the neurologists with a scalpel.</p>
<p>We tend to be a bit more intellectual.</p>
<p>Maybe bedside manner is a little bit friendlier.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the vascular neurosurgeon</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t sleep, and so they&rsquo;re not as friendly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the spine surgeons who operate the most,</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re busy, busy, busy.</p>
<p>There are some of these kind of reputations going around,</p>
<p>but I agree with you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sort of a common feature</p>
<p>of a calmness across neurosurgeons.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some of my, obviously my favorite people,</p>
<p>my closest friends, and I can relate with them</p>
<p>probably because of that, sort of a big picture.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get sort of flustered.</p>
<p>They tend to be really good at figuring out</p>
<p>how to have quality time because we work really hard.</p>
<p>Our hours are significant.</p>
<p>And so the time with our families, our friends,</p>
<p>is less than we would like it to be.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s true for people</p>
<p>who work hard across any profession,</p>
<p>but definitely true for neurosurgeons.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re very good at figuring out</p>
<p>how to make that time high quality.</p>
<p>Even just texting with some of my friends</p>
<p>that are neurosurgeons, a great friend of mine</p>
<p>just became chairman at Duke,</p>
<p>and just connecting with him by text, which takes seconds,</p>
<p>we feel connected.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a trait amongst neurosurgeons.</p>
<p>We sort of know how to cut to the chase in a way</p>
<p>and prioritize our time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a skill that we probably have innately,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also part of the training.</p>
<p>When we are interns now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of work hour regulations</p>
<p>that is probably quite appropriate, by the way.</p>
<p>I think our hours before were bordering on,</p>
<p>not necessarily, let&rsquo;s just say they were not ideal</p>
<p>for mental health and sleep,</p>
<p>which we know are very important components.</p>
<p>Certainly, we had no time for meditation.</p>
<p>I definitely did not.</p>
<p>I wish I did.</p>
<p>Now, knowing what I know about meditation,</p>
<p>my wife&rsquo;s a health coach.</p>
<p>I get it, I see it, I practice it myself with her.</p>
<p>I see the value.</p>
<p>I wish I had that tool when I was in training</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s stressful.</p>
<p>Even with the work hour restrictions,</p>
<p>we still don&rsquo;t sleep very much.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still at work a lot,</p>
<p>80 hours a week.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire career?</p>
<p>There are times when it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>because after training,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no work hour restrictions.</p>
<p>So sometimes I feel like as faculty,</p>
<p>we get abused and the trainees</p>
<p>are a little bit more protected now.</p>
<p>It definitely was the reverse at one point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also a huge problem,</p>
<p>probably more of a problem.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m joking a little bit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily think we&rsquo;re abused,</p>
<p>but certainly our hours are significant.</p>
<p>But they come a bit more here and there.</p>
<p>On my OR days when I&rsquo;m operating,</p>
<p>those are long days,</p>
<p>but on the days that I&rsquo;m lucky enough</p>
<p>to be a researcher,</p>
<p>like you, those days tend to be a bit gentler</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m grant writing.</p>
<p>Those days can be long, as you know.</p>
<p>So to answer your question,</p>
<p>I do think we&rsquo;re sort of self-selected for it,</p>
<p>but I also think it&rsquo;s part of the training.</p>
<p>Because of the long hours that we&rsquo;re in the hospital,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re taking care of sick patients</p>
<p>and we have sort of a type A mentor approach</p>
<p>where our mentors are hard on us.</p>
<p>We learn to cope with our stress</p>
<p>and be efficient and prioritize things</p>
<p>despite the stress of it all.</p>
<p>And I think we take from that this sort of calm demeanor.</p>
<p>And perhaps it&rsquo;s just amplifies</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re probably drawn to.</p>
<p>Because before we come to neurosurgery,</p>
<p>we might rotate in neurosurgery.</p>
<p>We might spend a month pretending to be a neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>learning from residents and faculty</p>
<p>that are practicing the specialty.</p>
<p>But prior to actually starting your training,</p>
<p>you never experienced anything</p>
<p>like being a resident in neurosurgery,</p>
<p>the stress and the volume of patients</p>
<p>that you have to take care of and the long nights.</p>
<p>It can be quite lonely, by the way.</p>
<p>You develop friends in the hospital,</p>
<p>but sometimes you&rsquo;re on your own when you&rsquo;re on call</p>
<p>and you have backup.</p>
<p>You can call your chief resident or your attending,</p>
<p>but you really have to learn</p>
<p>how to take care of patients yourself.</p>
<p>You obviously form teams with nurses and staff</p>
<p>and things like that and other residents,</p>
<p>but it can be lonely.</p>
<p>It can be really challenging.</p>
<p>And I think because of those experiences</p>
<p>that all neurosurgeons go through,</p>
<p>we tend to have this sort of unflappable personality</p>
<p>that perhaps we started with a bit</p>
<p>compared to the average person,</p>
<p>but the training definitely amplifies it.</p>
<p>And do you have tools that you implement</p>
<p>if you ever feel that you&rsquo;re getting slightly off center?</p>
<p>I do now.</p>
<p>When I was in training,</p>
<p>I actually remember in my second year.</p>
<p>So most neurosurgery programs,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a junior resident,</p>
<p>in some ways that&rsquo;s your toughest year, not in every way.</p>
<p>It is your toughest year because you&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re inexperienced</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such a tough year</p>
<p>because you have to learn a lot very quickly</p>
<p>for patient safety reasons, for self-survival.</p>
<p>You just have to learn a lot</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on call by yourself in the hospital.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a real challenge.</p>
<p>And I think that, personally,</p>
<p>I gained a lot of weight during that year.</p>
<p>The only exercise I did consciously was taking the stairs.</p>
<p>I refused to take the elevator.</p>
<p>And I was at Penn, at HUP, where I currently practice now.</p>
<p>And I remember I would see patients</p>
<p>anywhere from sort of the ground floor,</p>
<p>where the trauma bay was, or the ER,</p>
<p>all the way up to Founders 12th, the 12th floor.</p>
<p>And I would never take an elevator.</p>
<p>That was my rule for the year</p>
<p>because I knew I would not have time to exercise,</p>
<p>but I would just take the stairs.</p>
<p>And in the beginning of the year,</p>
<p>I would be a little winded when I got to the 12th floor.</p>
<p>But by the end of the year, actually,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t really phase me</p>
<p>and it became a great habit to have.</p>
<p>The problem with that, though,</p>
<p>was I paired that, unfortunately,</p>
<p>with a lot of sleepless nights,</p>
<p>or not enough sleep, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And I had this terrible habit</p>
<p>of drinking coffee late at night,</p>
<p>and I would put a lot of sugar in it.</p>
<p>And it was sort of the only way for me to get a quick,</p>
<p>a quick bout of energy that, for some reason,</p>
<p>I prioritized at that time,</p>
<p>obviously knowing that I would crash, which I always did,</p>
<p>and I always kind of regretted it, but I still did it anyway.</p>
<p>And I attribute that to poor decision-making,</p>
<p>inexperience, and perhaps being a little vulnerable,</p>
<p>like I think we all are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I relate with a lot of the research that I do.</p>
<p>And I remember, I got married in my third year,</p>
<p>the year after my second year.</p>
<p>And my wife and I, or my fiancee at the time,</p>
<p>we started going to the gym together in the morning,</p>
<p>and my hours were a little better,</p>
<p>so I would actually be able to exercise</p>
<p>before I operated that day.</p>
<p>And I operated almost every day as a third-year resident.</p>
<p>So I remember I&rsquo;d get to the gym really early,</p>
<p>and in three months, I lost like 20 pounds,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t trying to lose weight.</p>
<p>I just was sleeping better and taking care of myself.</p>
<p>And I remember when we got married,</p>
<p>I fit into a tuxedo that I had in college,</p>
<p>or it would have fit me in college.</p>
<p>It actually was a new tuxedo, admittedly,</p>
<p>but it was the same size as my tuxedo from college.</p>
<p>So I think that I&rsquo;ve always related with the problems</p>
<p>that our patients have to a certain extent.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;ve been most vulnerable,</p>
<p>which is when I was working the hardest</p>
<p>with the least amount of sleep,</p>
<p>I related with it the most.</p>
<p>And yes, exercise for me has always been my tool.</p>
<p>More recently, exercise, some strength training</p>
<p>I think is important compared with cardio.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do enough of either, but I definitely do some,</p>
<p>and that helps.</p>
<p>Meditation helps me a bit.</p>
<p>I do that every night before I go to sleep.</p>
<p>I use an app for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not the best way to do meditation, but-</p>
<p>If it keeps you doing it regularly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best way to do it.</p>
<p>Andrew, I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>where I look forward to it every night.</p>
<p>And sometimes my wife falls asleep</p>
<p>and I come to bed a little later and I whisper,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, are you okay if I turn the app on?</p>
<p>So, and she does the same to me</p>
<p>because I think we both value it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s been very helpful.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have that tool probably when I needed it most,</p>
<p>but I have it now and it&rsquo;s very helpful.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you sharing those tools</p>
<p>that a number of people, I&rsquo;m guessing out there,</p>
<p>might want to become neurosurgeons.</p>
<p>I really believe that in hearing today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>that you will spark an interest in medicine</p>
<p>and or neurosurgery.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>Well, certainly you need to be a physician</p>
<p>before you can become a neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>So, and neurosurgery in some cases,</p>
<p>and that would be beautiful.</p>
<p>And I predict that will be happen,</p>
<p>that will happen, excuse me,</p>
<p>as a consequence of what you&rsquo;ve shared today.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your mentioning</p>
<p>of the emphasis and appreciation on quality time.</p>
<p>I very much see this as quality time.</p>
<p>I know that our listeners will as well.</p>
<p>Really want to thank you for taking time out of your,</p>
<p>not just immensely busy, but very important schedule,</p>
<p>because again, the work that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is really out there on that cutting,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say bleeding edge,</p>
<p>because in this context, it&rsquo;s not going to sound right,</p>
<p>but on that extreme cutting edge</p>
<p>of what we understand about how the human brain works</p>
<p>and how it can be repaired.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing marvelous work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll point people to various places</p>
<p>they can find you online.</p>
<p>And should they need the help of your clinic,</p>
<p>to your clinic and your laboratory as well.</p>
<p>So on behalf of everybody and myself as well,</p>
<p>thank you so, so very much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me today</p>
<p>for my discussion with Dr. Casey Halpern</p>

<p>Not so much today,</p>
<p>but in many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we talk about supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like enhancing sleep and focus</p>
<p>and hormone optimization.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has partnered with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that the Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered</p>
<p>with Momentous on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>so livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And there you&rsquo;ll see a number of the supplements</p>
<p>that we talk about regularly on the podcast.</p>
<p>I should just mention that that catalog of supplements</p>
<p>is constantly being updated.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already signed up</p>
<p>for the Neural Network Newsletter,</p>
<p>this is a monthly Huberman Lab Podcast newsletter</p>
<p>in which you get some brief show note summaries,</p>
<p>as well as a lot of actionable tools in summary form.</p>
<p>Many people find these very useful</p>
<p>for distilling out the vast amount of information</p>
<p>that we cover on the podcast.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you go to HubermanLab.com,</p>
<p>you can click on the menu,</p>
<p>click to Neural Network Newsletter, or simply newsletter,</p>
<p>and you can sign up, just give us your email.</p>
<p>We do not share your email with anybody.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s completely zero cost.</p>
<p>We also have examples of previous newsletters</p>
<p>that you can download immediately</p>
<p>without having to sign up for anything</p>
<p>and decide whether or not you want to sign up.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s the Neural Network Newsletter</p>
<p>at HubermanLab.com.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following us on social media,</p>
<p>we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, on Twitter,</p>
<p>on Facebook, and on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And especially on Instagram and on Twitter,</p>
<p>I cover many of the tools that are discussed</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but also a lot of science and science-based tools</p>
<p>not covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on all platforms.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for joining me today</p>
<p>for my discussion with Dr. Casey Halpern.</p>
<p>I hope you learned as much as I did.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
