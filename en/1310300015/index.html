    <p>This is an All Ears English podcast, episode 1914.</p>
<p>Make business English work out with this phrasal verb.</p>
<p>Welcome to the All Ears English podcast downloaded more than 200 million times.</p>
<p>Are you feeling stuck with your English?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll show you how to become fearless and fluent by focusing on connection, not perfection</p>
<p>with your American hosts, Aubrey Carter, the IELTS whiz, and Lindsay McMahon, the English</p>
<p>adventurer, coming to you from Arizona and Colorado, USA.</p>
<p>And to get your transcripts delivered by email every week, go to allearsenglish.com forward</p>
<p>slash subscribe.</p>
<p>When your colleague has something going on at work that matters, you should ask them</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>Today, find out how to use the magical phrasal verb work out to check in with your colleague</p>
<p>and even transition the conversation into your social life.</p>
<p>Listen in today.</p>
<p>Hey there, Aubrey, how&rsquo;s everything going today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m great.</p>
<p>How are you, Lindsay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling great today.</p>
<p>And I am so excited about our new podcast, Business English podcast from All Ears English.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it working out, by the way?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s working out great, Aubrey, because the point is, you know, we publish so much here</p>
<p>on All Ears English, which is fantastic.</p>
<p>But sometimes I know our listeners who are super focused on their careers, they want</p>
<p>to show just for Business English, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re giving them.</p>
<p>So guys, if you haven&rsquo;t found our new Business English podcast from All Ears English, Aubrey,</p>
<p>how can they find it?</p>
<p>Yes, you need to search All Ears English in the search bar, wherever you listen to podcasts,</p>
<p>and all three of our podcasts will show up.</p>
<p>Look for Business English and make sure that you follow it, especially if you work in English,</p>
<p>or will it sometime in the future so that you have all those episodes in one place.</p>
<p>Yes, good stuff.</p>
<p>So today I&rsquo;m excited because we are answering a student question.</p>
<p>I love it when we bring our student, our listener questions in on the episodes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you guys will notice that I asked Lindsay, how&rsquo;s that working out?</p>
<p>Which is a very native, natural way to say, is it working?</p>
<p>Is it successful?</p>
<p>And that is the phrasal verb that we&rsquo;re focusing on today.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s read this question and dive in.</p>
<p>This is a really good one.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>So our listener, what is this listener&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>Do we have their name?</p>
<p>No, unfortunately, it was a listener on WeChat in China.</p>
<p>And we get great comments and questions, but unfortunately, you guys don&rsquo;t always leave</p>
<p>your name.</p>
<p>So shout out to this Chinese listener, we don&rsquo;t have the name.</p>
<p>All right, good stuff.</p>
<p>So here she says, can you girls explain how to use the phrase workout?</p>
<p>I heard others say this phrase in different situations, and I was wondering how to use</p>
<p>this phrase correctly.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, Chinese listener on WeChat.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh, guys, this is so fascinating.</p>
<p>Because as soon as I started, I know a lot of them, but I thought, oh, there are quite</p>
<p>a few.</p>
<p>And I did a bit of a deep dive.</p>
<p>There are so many phrasal verbs, just for workout, or there&rsquo;s so many meanings for that</p>
<p>one phrasal verb, right?</p>
<p>Oh, we love this.</p>
<p>As native speakers, we love this phrasal verb.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much we can do with it.</p>
<p>We can be sarcastic, we can be straightforward, we can be professional, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>So what are we focusing on today when it comes to this one?</p>
<p>Yes, we are going to focus in on the meaning that means be successful.</p>
<p>There are lots of meanings for this phrasal verb.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve definitely heard it used to mean to exercise, to make calculations.</p>
<p>But today we&rsquo;re talking about one meaning, which is to have success.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think that it really applies in the business world because we often want to check</p>
<p>in with our colleagues on how something is going, right?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So you guys are, yeah.</p>
<p>If you know they&rsquo;ve set a goal or they just did a presentation, this is such a great way</p>
<p>to connect to ask them how it worked out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go into it, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So first we use this three different ways, this phrasal verb, the meaning of being successful.</p>
<p>And the first is to make predictions.</p>
<p>So for example, you might ask, Ooh, do you think it&rsquo;ll work out?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or how do you think that&rsquo;s going to work out?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then the answer might be, it&rsquo;ll all work out or it&rsquo;ll all work out.</p>
<p>That sounds really natural.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll all work out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll all work out.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a pronunciation wise.</p>
<p>That could be a little confusing for our listeners.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Really, it&rsquo;s it will.</p>
<p>It will all work out.</p>
<p>But we always squish these together in that contraction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll all work out.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>What else, Aubrey?</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll definitely hear also that&rsquo;ll instead of that will work out.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;ll work out?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll work out.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll work out.</p>
<p>Or do you think it&rsquo;s gonna work out?</p>
<p>I use gonna all the time and I actually type it in text messages too.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder, should I type this in a text message even to friends?</p>
<p>It seems kind of weird, right?</p>
<p>But I do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just natural.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I want to say to sound friendly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I probably wouldn&rsquo;t put it in a business email, especially if it&rsquo;s not a coworker,</p>
<p>you know, very well, maybe a new client, but we say it all the time to a new client.</p>
<p>I would still be like, you know, are you going to come to happy hour?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we get.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And maybe we should come back to another episode on that.</p>
<p>You know, going to when should you use gonna?</p>
<p>When should you not?</p>
<p>When should you write it?</p>
<p>When should you not?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the phrase with work out, guys.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna work out or I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna work out.</p>
<p>Now, could this be to talk about relationships?</p>
<p>We use it a lot that way, right?</p>
<p>If someone is just starting a relationship, you might ask someone and you think it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to work out and they say, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to work out or they say not a match,</p>
<p>not a match.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big phrase now.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So the second meaning is discussing results, right?</p>
<p>So this is where if someone has done a presentation, you might want to ask them how it went.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d say, how&rsquo;d that work out or how did it work out?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How did it work out?</p>
<p>Or and I would respond by saying what?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Either.</p>
<p>Yeah, it worked out or it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Oh, it didn&rsquo;t really work out.</p>
<p>And I love how we as native speakers like to say really, right?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really work out.</p>
<p>We add that really in all the time to feel natural.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Just to add kind of a filler word, I guess.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it sort of takes the sting out of something instead of saying it didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, oh, it didn&rsquo;t really work out.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>OK, so we&rsquo;ve talked about discussing results, guys, making predictions, write those things</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a third bucket.</p>
<p>What is it, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s asking about goals or about something new, like maybe something a new purchase.</p>
<p>So first of all, you might say if it&rsquo;s like a goal, you might say, how&rsquo;s not eating sugar</p>
<p>working out or how&rsquo;s reading every day working out right?</p>
<p>Someone has told you a goal they&rsquo;ve made and you&rsquo;re going to say, how&rsquo;s blank working out</p>
<p>to ask them about that goal?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s kind of a more skeptical side of this, just as a bonus for our listeners.</p>
<p>The phrase, how&rsquo;s that working out for you?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Very sarcastic.</p>
<p>What is that just as a little asterisk for our listeners?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>When I say that, how&rsquo;s that working out for you?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>If I told you something that you know is either destined to fail or I&rsquo;m doing something you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t agree with, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to be like, yeah, how&rsquo;s that working out for you?</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not going well, but let&rsquo;s be real here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little different from what we&rsquo;re sharing now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the same kind of meaning, but it&rsquo;s putting a layer of skepticism on it, which</p>
<p>is again, supernatural.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear it, but it does mean something different than someone earnestly checking</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that going?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that working out?</p>
<p>I can think of a good example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting up at 4 a.m. to work because I&rsquo;m awake anyway, so I&rsquo;m like, I may as well use</p>
<p>this time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wake up at four and can&rsquo;t fall back to sleep.</p>
<p>But I feel like a friend said this to me recently.</p>
<p>I was telling her that and she was like, how&rsquo;s that working out for you?</p>
<p>Because then she was like, are you going to sleep at 7 or 8 p.m. because there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>you can stay up late if you&rsquo;re getting up at four.</p>
<p>Or maybe she thinks ultimately it&rsquo;ll catch up with you in a couple of weeks, you&rsquo;ll crash</p>
<p>and it just won&rsquo;t be sustainable.</p>
<p>So there is a layer that is a way to express skepticism.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s get back to the more earnest ways of expressing this.</p>
<p>Yes, for sure.</p>
<p>So this also works with new things that you maybe have purchased, like, you know, how&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that new car working out?</p>
<p>Or how&rsquo;s your new boyfriend working out, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds.</p>
<p>You can add anything here and then someone would be like, oh, it&rsquo;s not really working</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>Or yeah, it&rsquo;s working out great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there anything we need to know, Aubrey, grammatically speaking, in terms of our grammar</p>
<p>when we answer this?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really important here that in order to sound more natural and native,</p>
<p>if someone says to you, like, how&rsquo;s not eating sugar working out?</p>
<p>It is very unnatural to answer eating sugar is not working out, right?</p>
<p>You always want to replace the noun or the gerund or the noun phrase with a demonstrative</p>
<p>pronoun.</p>
<p>So either this or that, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d always say, oh, that&rsquo;s not working out.</p>
<p>To repeat that noun feels repetitive and very unnatural.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I mean, I think that&rsquo;s generally true across so much of the English language,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s too repetitive.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re repeating the same thing the other person just asked us, we&rsquo;re wasting their</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re studying for the IELTS exam, the examiner is listening for this specifically.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re repeating vocabulary instead of using a pronoun, that would be much more native</p>
<p>and natural.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a skill that you are specifically being tested on.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>Guys, check out our third podcast.</p>
<p>We now have three podcasts at All ears English.</p>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>IELTS energy podcast with Jessica and Aubrey two days a week.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Anything else about let&rsquo;s give a two more sample sentences for our listeners in this</p>
<p>in this way.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I might say like, how&rsquo;s drinking more water working out again?</p>
<p>Like I know someone set the goal of drinking more water.</p>
<p>I recently set this goal.</p>
<p>So I would like for a friend to kind of give me that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that word when you you want to be accountable to someone like an accountability, accountability,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, you know, how&rsquo;s not drinking water working out?</p>
<p>Are you able to do it?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s drinking more water working out?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>No, I love that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have to bring a big jug up to your office and have it sit there all day is is the way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It has to be very handy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Handy.</p>
<p>And it has to work really well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Easy to pour.</p>
<p>Easy to do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that new car working out?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So this is, you know, these are standard everyday ways of saying this.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But in just a minute, we&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit about business English and how</p>

<p>Fred Meyer.</p>
<p>Fresh for everyone.</p>
<p>OK, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So in the business world, which I know a lot of our listeners are there, what do we need</p>
<p>to know?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is so perfect for talking about anything that can be successful.</p>
<p>So we use this a lot in business English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a great way to build relationships.</p>
<p>If you know someone has a pretty high stakes interview meeting presentation to ask them</p>
<p>ahead of time that prediction, you know, how do you think it&rsquo;s going to work out?</p>
<p>Are you ready for afterward to ask them how it worked out?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s something about on this show, whether it&rsquo;s in the business world or</p>
<p>our daily lives, it&rsquo;s connection connection.</p>
<p>And when your colleague knows that you remember that you had a proposal today or you had that</p>
<p>presentation, even if they weren&rsquo;t there and were involved, that&rsquo;s super valuable, right?</p>
<p>That you can go to them and check in.</p>
<p>When someone remembers something that was important to you, it really feels like the</p>
<p>relationship is deeper, is more meaningful if they care to remember and are willing to</p>
<p>take the time to ask you about it.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>So as you said, Aubrey, anything like proposals, plans, goals, presentations, you might have</p>
<p>meetings.</p>
<p>Maybe you are doing a salary negotiation and you shared that with a colleague, right?</p>
<p>Maybe that or an interview.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re interviewing at another company.</p>
<p>All sorts of things.</p>
<p>Promotion.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I would definitely hope that a close colleague or friend would ask me how it went if I had</p>
<p>a meeting about something important like that.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>So guys check in with people using this.</p>
<p>We have a role play, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Should we do it?</p>
<p>This is going to be good.</p>
<p>So Lindsay and I are coworkers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just leaving a meeting that I led.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start us out.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure how that&rsquo;d go, but I think it worked out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You did a great job.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little worried about meeting the annual goals.</p>
<p>I hear you.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to work out though.</p>
<p>Speaking of goals, how&rsquo;s your goal of running every day working out?</p>
<p>Oof.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really working out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If I set that goal, it definitely wouldn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>I kind of love this, how as coworkers, we pivot from talking about how the meeting went,</p>
<p>how my presentation went, and then say, speaking of goals, how&rsquo;s your goal of running every</p>
<p>day working out?</p>
<p>This is so native.</p>
<p>I do this all the time.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so normal for native speakers of English to move in and out of topics and they might</p>
<p>come back to the work thing, right?</p>
<p>They come and often they don&rsquo;t even do that transition.</p>
<p>Speaking of, sometimes they just go break straight to the other topic, which is I know</p>
<p>what we want to help you guys with, right?</p>
<p>To hang in there, to get to the moment of connection.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s review what we did here, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So first I say, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how it&rsquo;d go, but I think it worked out.</p>
<p>This is very native to say about something you did.</p>
<p>It would be, you don&rsquo;t want to brag.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to sound like you&rsquo;re not humble.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things you can&rsquo;t really say comfortably.</p>
<p>Like I did really well.</p>
<p>I think I did a great job.</p>
<p>What you can say is, I think it worked out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s something about that that&rsquo;s taking the emphasis off of you and more onto</p>
<p>the whole endeavor, I guess, or the presentation itself.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not braggy, you&rsquo;re not bragging about yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just saying, yeah, I think it worked out.</p>
<p>I think it went well.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a nice way to be assertive, but also humble in a way.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>What else did we say here?</p>
<p>And then you said, because I said, I&rsquo;m worried about the annual goals.</p>
<p>And you said, I think it&rsquo;s going to work out though.</p>
<p>And we definitely could say, I think it&rsquo;ll work out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll work out.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to work out.</p>
<p>And then we did the flip to the personal life.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Speaking of goals, how&rsquo;s your goal of running every day working out?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not really working out, meaning I&rsquo;m not really doing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struggling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something convenient.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love this episode.</p>
<p>And I love this phrasal verb, because there&rsquo;s something more comfortable and less vulnerable</p>
<p>about not about not saying I&rsquo;m not doing it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to beat ourselves up and say, no, it&rsquo;s not really working out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not going to the gym, everyone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not doing it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not working out.</p>
<p>And it could be a little more vague to like other things could be going on, right?</p>
<p>Maybe the family is getting in the way.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And this is a real skill to not have TMI.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to share that the families you don&rsquo;t need to share why you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>You can just be like, it&rsquo;s not working out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you said, yeah, if I set that goal, it definitely wouldn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re empathizing with me trying to mirror my difficulties and making which I think is</p>
<p>also a real skill to show empathy this way.</p>
<p>If someone has set a goal and they let you know it&rsquo;s not working out, especially if it</p>
<p>is true for you to say, oh, same.</p>
<p>If I set that goal, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the takeaway?</p>
<p>What is the key way we want our listeners to remember today for working out?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is such a great way to make connections with coworkers, especially at work, but also</p>
<p>friends, everyone in your life to use the phrasal verb workout to discuss success.</p>
<p>Ask about results of goals.</p>
<p>Ask about new purchases.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>These are all such fun things to talk about and are great ways to build those deeper connections.</p>
<p>Yeah, guys, keep in mind, you know what your colleagues are doing, what&rsquo;s going on in their</p>
<p>work day.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re on another floor, but you meet them for lunch a couple of times a week, right?</p>
<p>Make sure they know that you know what&rsquo;s happening in their work lives, and then you could transition</p>
<p>into their personal lives right there in that conversation.</p>
<p>And this phrasal verb works for it all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually kind of amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of an amazing word.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t stress out about phrasal verbs.</p>
<p>There are, I think there are like 21 phrasal verbs for the verb work, and there are like</p>
<p>six meanings for work out.</p>
<p>So the listener on WeChat that posted this, you&rsquo;ve probably seen it used all these different</p>
<p>ways.</p>
<p>This is really helpful to focus on one way, perfect how you can use the one meaning, then</p>
<p>move on to the next one.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let yourself get confused.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get overwhelmed, guys.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>Super inspiring, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Thanks for hanging out today to show us, you know, how this phrasal verb works.</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>I think it worked out.</p>
<p>It did work out.</p>
<p>I think that worked out great.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk to you very soon.</p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>
<p>You too.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
