    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This time I&rsquo;m going to explore the beginning of the Greek alphabet, which is ultimately</p>
<p>the same alphabet we use today.</p>
<p>But before I begin, let me mention a couple of things about the alphabet in this podcast</p>
<p>series.</p>
<p>Obviously, the story of the alphabet is part of the story of English, and my general approach</p>
<p>here is to discuss the development and evolution of the alphabet as I move forward with the</p>
<p>story of English.</p>
<p>So it isn&rsquo;t really my intention to tell the entire story of the alphabet in one episode,</p>
<p>or even a series of episodes, because the development of the alphabet spans the entire</p>
<p>scope of this podcast.</p>
<p>But a few listeners have asked that I spend some time on the history of the alphabet and</p>
<p>explore the history of all the letters the way I did with the history of the letter C</p>
<p>in an earlier episode.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve decided to do just that.</p>
<p>But to tell the entire story of the alphabet, it would take several episodes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in the process of preparing a series of episodes related to the entire history</p>
<p>of the alphabet and the letters which we use today.</p>
<p>And these episodes will be separate from this podcast series, and they&rsquo;ll include some of</p>
<p>the information which I cover in this series, as well as lots of information that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>covered here.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to make these episodes available for a small fee of probably $5, which will</p>
<p>help to cover some of the costs associated with producing and hosting this podcast.</p>
<p>And the alphabet series will be available at the website, historyofenglishpodcast.com,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll also try to make it available through iTunes as well.</p>
<p>And I hope to have those episodes available very shortly, and I&rsquo;ll give you an update</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re ready.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s turn our attention back to this episode and look at how the Greeks came to</p>
<p>discover the alphabet.</p>
<p>Now last time I looked at the arrival of the first Indo-Europeans into Greece.</p>
<p>And these were the Mycenaean Greeks, with a civilization centered around the ancient</p>
<p>city of Mycenae.</p>
<p>And we looked at the competition between the ancient Hittites and the Egyptians to the</p>
<p>east.</p>
<p>But around 1100 BC, the entire eastern Mediterranean fell into a state of chaos as a result of</p>
<p>the so-called invasion of the Sea Peoples.</p>
<p>And in its wake, the Greek civilization and the Hittite empire collapsed.</p>
<p>And the influence of ancient Egypt was severely curtailed as well, as it retreated back to</p>
<p>the Nile Valley.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re looking at the ensuing period of Greek history, which is known as</p>
<p>the Greek Dark Age.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at the emergence of the first alphabet, and with it, the emergence of Greece</p>
<p>from the Dark Age into the literate classical Greek period, which is the ultimate basis</p>
<p>of much of Western civilization.</p>
<p>And with the emergence of this new Greek civilization after the Dark Age, we get the widespread</p>
<p>use of the brand new alphabet, we get the spread of literacy, and we get the advent</p>
<p>of writing, literature, and many words which have found their way into modern English.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s begin with the aftermath of the invasion of the Sea Peoples in the 12th century BC.</p>
<p>As I said, many of the civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean had collapsed during</p>
<p>this period.</p>
<p>And a general vacuum of power existed throughout the region.</p>
<p>This included modern-day Greece, Turkey, and the eastern Mediterranean coast, including</p>
<p>modern-day Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.</p>
<p>During the so-called Dark Age period which followed, several very important events occurred.</p>
<p>In fact, the events of this period shaped much of the subsequent history of Europe in</p>
<p>the Middle East.</p>
<p>And these events have implications on our language, and our culture, and our politics</p>
<p>even today.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at what happened.</p>
<p>And first, let&rsquo;s look at what was happening in Greece.</p>
<p>With the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, we also lost the writing system which had</p>
<p>developed called Linear B.</p>
<p>Remember that the Indo-European Mycenaean Greeks had apparently borrowed the linear</p>
<p>script from the Minoans on Crete, and they had adapted their script to their own Greek</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>But also remember that even though the script resembles an alphabet, it&rsquo;s not an alphabet.</p>
<p>Like most of the writing during this period, it was based on syllables.</p>
<p>So it was a syllabic script.</p>
<p>And this meant that each syllable was represented by a character or symbol.</p>
<p>This was the same general concept as hieroglyphic writing, which was common in Egypt, and cuneiform</p>
<p>writing which was common throughout much of the Near East at this time.</p>
<p>Since all of these syllable-based writing systems were based on syllables, and since</p>
<p>there were lots of potential syllables in any given language, it required the memorization</p>
<p>and use of many symbols.</p>
<p>So these writing systems were always limited to a very small portion of the population</p>
<p>who could actually read and write them.</p>
<p>And consequently, writing during this early period was generally limited to governmental</p>
<p>and commercial functions.</p>
<p>But literature in the sense that we would later come to know it was very rare during</p>
<p>this period.</p>
<p>And with the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, the linear B script that they had developed</p>
<p>stopped being used with any regularity, and it eventually disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>With the loss of writing in Greece, we also lost recorded history, such that it existed.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we call the following three centuries the Dark Age.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if someone turned out the lights because written records tended to disappear during</p>
<p>this period.</p>
<p>Of course, even though the Greeks didn&rsquo;t have a written language during this period,</p>
<p>the earliest Indo-European Greek language was still being spoken, and it was constantly</p>
<p>evolving throughout the Aegean.</p>
<p>And this leads us to the other significant event that occurred in Greece during this</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>During the Greek Dark Age, Greece experienced an extended period of migrations and resettlements.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know a lot about the earlier Mycenaean civilization, but archaeological evidence</p>
<p>suggests a certain uniformity of the culture throughout Greece during this period.</p>
<p>During and after the invasion of the Sea Peoples, these early Greeks apparently experienced</p>
<p>a great deal of movement and migrations.</p>
<p>This could have involved the actual invaders from the north who triggered the events which</p>
<p>led to the Dark Age period.</p>
<p>The invaders were likely other Indo-European tribes who would have spoken very closely</p>
<p>related Indo-European dialects during this very early period.</p>
<p>But it also probably involved native Mycenaean Greeks who were displaced by the invasions</p>
<p>and who migrated in a general eastward direction looking for new territory in which to settle.</p>
<p>I mentioned this in the last episode with respect to the Dorians.</p>
<p>As you may recall, I noted that some historians believe that the original invaders from the</p>
<p>north were the Dorians, who were a specific group of Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>But other historians think the Dorians were already in place before the invasions began.</p>
<p>And still other historians think they arrived after the invasions to fill the vacuum left</p>
<p>in the aftermath.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why there is so much debate regarding this issue among historians is because</p>
<p>the Dorians were in place in Greece at the end of the Dark Age.</p>
<p>And the Dorians were the linguistic ancestors of the people of Corinth and Sparta.</p>
<p>They spoke the so-called Doric dialect of Greek.</p>
<p>And the Doric dialect also spread into and came to dominate Crete as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in other parts of Greece, other Greek dialects had emerged.</p>
<p>The Ionic dialects were being spoken around the rim of the Aegean, including eastern Greece</p>
<p>and western Anatolia.</p>
<p>And this Ionic family of dialects included the Attic dialect, which was the primary dialect</p>
<p>of the ancient city of Athens.</p>
<p>And this Attic dialect is actually the ancient ancestor of the modern Greek language.</p>
<p>The third major dialect was Aeolic, which was spoken in northern Greece and northern</p>
<p>Anatolia.</p>
<p>And we really don&rsquo;t know what the circumstances were that led to this division of dialects</p>
<p>since writing had disappeared during this period.</p>
<p>But it appears that there was some distinction between these dialects even during the late</p>
<p>Mycenaean period.</p>
<p>But after the invasion of the tribes from the north, which led to the Dark Age period,</p>
<p>these existing dialects moved with the migration of tribes and peoples throughout the region.</p>
<p>By the end of the Dark Age, when writing begins to re-emerge, we have a very good idea of</p>
<p>where these various dialects were being spoken.</p>
<p>Now late in the Greek Dark Age period, civilizations slowly began to reappear, and we start to</p>
<p>see the emergence of the early Greek city-states.</p>
<p>These were independent, self-governing cities, and they included cities like Athens, Sparta,</p>
<p>Corinth, Thebes, and many others.</p>
<p>Each city-state had a common language or dialect, and they had a common religion.</p>
<p>And city-states which shared a common dialect usually shared other cultural connections,</p>
<p>which reflects the fact that they were probably descended from common ancestors who had a</p>
<p>common culture and spoke a common dialect as well.</p>
<p>And these connections typically resulted in alliances.</p>
<p>So for example, the Dorians could usually count on other Dorian cities to come to their</p>
<p>aid in a time of war.</p>
<p>So Corinth could call upon Sparta for help if it needed it.</p>
<p>And by the same token, Greeks who spoke other dialects were often viewed as rivals.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in this context that we see the early rise of Doric-speaking Sparta and Attic-speaking</p>
<p>Athens as the two primary Greek rivals during this early Classical Greek period.</p>
<p>These two cities, Athens and Sparta, eventually emerged as the most dominant and important</p>
<p>Greek city-states.</p>
<p>When the city of Mycenae collapsed, the Dorians had rushed in to fill the vacuum in the region</p>
<p>around Mycenae.</p>
<p>And in the aftermath, regional power passed from the decaying city of Mycenae to the emerging</p>
<p>Dorian city of Sparta.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, to the east, the community of Athens had avoided much of the destruction</p>
<p>associated with the northern invasions and the subsequent Dark Age.</p>
<p>Consequently it had become a haven for Mycenaean refugees.</p>
<p>And it was therefore one of the quickest city-states to emerge from this Dark Age period.</p>
<p>The Greeks called a city-state Apollos.</p>
<p>And this word has made its way into lots of modern English words.</p>
<p>We see it in modern city-names like Minneapolis and Indianapolis and Annapolis.</p>
<p>And this suffix was common in Greek city-names.</p>
<p>For example, Constantinople was called Constantinopolis by the Greeks.</p>
<p>As the Greeks spread around the Mediterranean establishing colonies, they called their home</p>
<p>city the Mother City, which in Greek was Metropolis, which we still have in English</p>
<p>as both Metropolis and Metropolitan.</p>
<p>Of course, the Greeks had the Acropolis, which meant High City in Greek.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the location of the well-known Acropolis at the top of a hill.</p>
<p>So Acropolis is High City.</p>
<p>Other English words which come from the Greek word polis include policy, politics, and police,</p>
<p>all of which relate to government functions associated with cities.</p>
<p>By the way, all of these words get to us via Latin, which is the case with most Greek words.</p>
<p>Now by the late Dark Age period, the various gods and goddesses associated with the various</p>
<p>city-states had started to be combined and arranged into a hierarchy which was common</p>
<p>to all Greeks.</p>
<p>Zeus, for example, was a god of the Dorian Greeks.</p>
<p>And Poseidon had come from the Minoans.</p>
<p>And Apollo was associated with Delphi.</p>
<p>So they all became combined into a common, shared hierarchy of gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>So even though Greece was still fractured, we can start to see the early development</p>
<p>of a common Greek culture.</p>
<p>They began to share the same gods, and even though the dialects were different, they could</p>
<p>still communicate with each other in a common language.</p>
<p>And while there would be a great deal of infighting between these early Greeks during the following</p>
<p>few centuries, their similarities would eventually overcome their differences in the face of</p>
<p>outside threats later on, especially the threat of the Persian Empire.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what was happening in Greece during the Dark Age period.</p>
<p>But what about the rest of the area to the east, where destruction had occurred in the</p>
<p>wake of the invasion of the Sea Peoples?</p>
<p>Well, to the east, the Indo-European Hittite Empire had collapsed.</p>
<p>And the Egyptian kingdom had been severely weakened.</p>
<p>If you recall from the last episode, both the Hittites and the Egyptians had tried to</p>
<p>control the narrow coastal region along the eastern Mediterranean that extended from northern</p>
<p>Egypt up to the Hittite kingdom in Anatolia.</p>
<p>This region&rsquo;s not very big, but it&rsquo;s very important to Near Eastern history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the home to modern-day Israel, Lebanon, western Syria, and Jordan.</p>
<p>And the reason this narrow strip of land is so important is because it had good arable</p>
<p>land being right along the coast, even though it&rsquo;s basically surrounded by desert and arid</p>
<p>land.</p>
<p>So it was basically a strip of good land between the desert to the east and the Mediterranean</p>
<p>to the west.</p>
<p>This meant that the land was not only good for settlement and farming, but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>where all the trade routes converged.</p>
<p>This included the trade routes from northern Africa to the south, Anatolia to the north,</p>
<p>and Mesopotamia to the east.</p>
<p>All of those trade routes passed through this narrow strip of land, so whoever controlled</p>
<p>this little bit of land had a tremendous amount of power.</p>
<p>As they say in the real estate business, it&rsquo;s all about location, location, location.</p>
<p>So needless to say, there was a lot of competition for this little bit of land, and there still</p>
<p>is today.</p>
<p>The Battle of Kadesh was fought between the Hittites and the Egyptians, in large part</p>
<p>to determine who would control this territory.</p>
<p>Egypt had once controlled the land, but the expanding Hittite empire had resulted in Hittite</p>
<p>control of the northern portion.</p>
<p>As you may recall, the Battle of Kadesh ended in a stalemate, so the region remained divided</p>
<p>after the battle, with the Hittites controlling the north and the Egyptians controlling the</p>
<p>south.</p>
<p>But after the invasion of the Sea Peoples, the Hittite empire collapsed, and the Egyptians</p>
<p>retreated back to the Nile Valley, and a power vacuum resulted in the region.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, that vacuum was quickly filled.</p>
<p>And the reason why what happened here is so important to our story is because it ultimately</p>
<p>gave us the alphabet which we still use today.</p>
<p>During the time of the Egyptians and the Hittites, this narrow strip of coastal land</p>
<p>was called Canaan, and that&rsquo;s a name that&rsquo;s probably very familiar to you if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>read the Old Testament or the Bible.</p>
<p>As I said, in the wake of the waning power of the Egyptians and the Hittites, various</p>
<p>tribes began to pour into the region.</p>
<p>These people began to settle into communities which soon emerged as independent city-states,</p>
<p>and the rise of city-states here was essentially the same process that was happening at the</p>
<p>same time over in Greece.</p>
<p>During this period, the region of Canaan was settled by Semitic-speaking tribes.</p>
<p>These tribes had lived a generally nomadic lifestyle in and around the region for centuries.</p>
<p>A few episodes back, when I was discussing some of the early Indo-European migrations,</p>
<p>I mentioned the emergence of the first civilizations in Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>And I mentioned that the first evidence we have of the Semitic people was in the northern</p>
<p>region of Mesopotamia, up the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.</p>
<p>We can think of the Semitic tribes by comparing them to the Indo-European tribes to the north.</p>
<p>Initially, in this region of northern Mesopotamia, we can probably think of the Semitic tribes</p>
<p>as both a specific ethnic and linguistic group.</p>
<p>And over a period of several centuries, these early Semitic-speaking tribes migrated in</p>
<p>a westward direction along the so-called Fertile Crescent into the region of Canaan and even</p>
<p>down into Egypt.</p>
<p>And as they migrated, they probably mixed and combined with other groups and other tribes</p>
<p>and peoples along the way so that at some point, we still have a common language or</p>
<p>language family, the Semitic languages.</p>
<p>But we have to be careful about assuming very much about the ethnicity of the groups at</p>
<p>this point.</p>
<p>We should just consider them as a linguistic group.</p>
<p>And the same is basically true of the Indo-European tribes as well.</p>
<p>At some point, you just have to think of them as linguistic groups and not really as ethnic</p>
<p>groups anymore.</p>
<p>Now one particular group of Semitic-speaking tribes were the Hebrews or Israelites who</p>
<p>had made their way to Egypt and ended up being enslaved there.</p>
<p>But more about them in a minute.</p>
<p>Up in Canaan, that narrow coastal strip of land which everyone wanted, other Semitic-speaking</p>
<p>tribes had settled in.</p>
<p>And they were connected to the Hebrews by language but probably not much else.</p>
<p>The Hebrews called these Semitic people the Canaanites.</p>
<p>But the Greeks called them the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>And the Canaanites and the Phoenicians are essentially two different terms which refer</p>
<p>to the same people, the Semitic-speaking people who lived in this narrow strip of coastal</p>
<p>land.</p>
<p>But historians today tend to make a subtle distinction in the way they use those terms.</p>
<p>And the distinction has to do with what happened next.</p>
<p>At this initial stage, historians generally call this entire area Canaan.</p>
<p>And the Semitic tribes who lived there, the Canaanites.</p>
<p>But soon, two more tribal groups decided to make an appearance there.</p>
<p>The Hebrews arrived from Egypt after escaping enslavement.</p>
<p>And some historians think this might have been partly a result of the fractured state</p>
<p>of Egypt at the time after the invasion of the Sea Peoples.</p>
<p>The Hebrew version of the story is told in the book of Exodus in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>But regardless of the specifics, the Hebrew tribes arrived at the scene in Canaan at this</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>And they soon took control of a large portion of southern Canaan which became the kingdoms</p>
<p>of Israel and Judah.</p>
<p>And around the same time, another group of people called the Philistines arrived in the</p>
<p>same region.</p>
<p>They came to occupy the southernmost coastline of Canaan.</p>
<p>And I mentioned in the last episode that archaeological evidence indicates a connection of these people</p>
<p>to the Greeks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that they were either part of the Sea Peoples who were defeated and beaten</p>
<p>back by the Egyptians, or they were Mycenaean Greek refugees who were part of the general</p>
<p>migration of Greeks to the east in search of new homes after the collapse of Mycenae.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very possible that the initial Philistine language was either an Indo-European language</p>
<p>or a language closely connected to the Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>And those neighboring Philistines became the bitter arch enemies of the Hebrews.</p>
<p>And the Old Testament outlines the Hebrew version of those events.</p>
<p>But with the Hebrews and the Philistines in place in southern Canaan, that left the</p>
<p>northern portion to the original Semitic-speaking tribes who continued to live there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at this point that historians typically shift the term and refer to those specific</p>
<p>Semitic tribes which remained in control of the north as the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>So even though there&rsquo;s a subtle distinction in the use of the term Canaanites and Phoenicians,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re basically talking about the same people.</p>
<p>They were called Canaanites before the Hebrews and Philistines settled there, and those that</p>
<p>remained in the north afterwards were called the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>And since these Phoenicians gave the Greeks the alphabet, we need to take a closer look</p>
<p>at this region which we can now call Phoenicia.</p>
<p>First of all, we have to keep in mind just how small this region was.</p>
<p>It was only about 35 miles wide and a little more than 200 miles long.</p>
<p>As I said, it occupied the northern region of ancient Canaan, so it&rsquo;s basically modern-day</p>
<p>Lebanon and the western coastal strip of modern Syria.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that the Phoenicians were not a nation or any other type of unified</p>
<p>political entity.</p>
<p>They were a collection of independent city-states.</p>
<p>They were often bitter rivals with each other, but they did have a common cultural identity</p>
<p>and a similar language.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted, the Phoenician language was a Semitic language and thus it was very similar</p>
<p>in many respects to Hebrew.</p>
<p>The Phoenicians took advantage of their strategic position at the crossroads of the ancient</p>
<p>world to become major traders and commercial middlemen in the ancient Near East.</p>
<p>They also took advantage of the general power vacuum at the time and the fact that there</p>
<p>were no regional superpowers left to dominate the region.</p>
<p>They were able to establish trade links to Anatolia and Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece.</p>
<p>They traded throughout the Mediterranean and it&rsquo;s believed that they traveled as far north</p>
<p>as Britain to obtain tin, which could be combined with copper to make bronze.</p>
<p>And they established trading posts throughout the Mediterranean, some of which emerged as</p>
<p>Phoenician colonies.</p>
<p>The most well-known and important Phoenician colony was Carthage on the North African coast</p>
<p>in what is today Tunisia.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk a lot more about Carthage when we get to the Romans very shortly.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see when we get to the Romans that Carthage and Rome fought a series of wars</p>
<p>against each other which are known as the Punic Wars and which produced the legendary</p>
<p>military leader Hannibal.</p>
<p>The fact that these wars are called Punic Wars is a reference to Carthage&rsquo;s initial</p>
<p>status as a Phoenician colony and it reveals the fact that the Romans still thought of</p>
<p>Carthage citizens as Phoenicians during that time.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go back to Phoenicia for a second.</p>
<p>As merchants, they traded in goods such as glass, exotic fabrics and dye.</p>
<p>They were especially well-known for producing a purple dye from local shellfish that was</p>
<p>called phoenix, which was the basis of the name Phoenicia used by the Greeks.</p>
<p>But some of the most important Phoenician exports were cedars and other wood which grew</p>
<p>in the region.</p>
<p>In fact, the Phoenician trading networks really began with the export of cedars and lumber</p>
<p>to Egypt.</p>
<p>And this access to lumber is actually very important.</p>
<p>It meant that they could build ships, which they did in abundance.</p>
<p>Some of those ships were more than 100 feet in length and that allowed them to trade throughout</p>
<p>the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And in fact, it was only the Greeks who could challenge the Phoenician domination of the</p>
<p>Mediterranean trade.</p>
<p>The Phoenicians also had access to the papyrus plant.</p>
<p>And around this same time, the Phoenicians began to produce and export papyrus, which</p>
<p>was used as an early form of paper.</p>
<p>And we actually get lots of English words from the Phoenician paper trade.</p>
<p>Most of the papyrus they produced came from the port city of Byblos.</p>
<p>The city-state of Byblos became so synonymous with paper production that the Greeks used</p>
<p>the name of the city for their word book, which was byblos.</p>
<p>And a collection of books was called a byblia.</p>
<p>And byblia found its way into Latin as biblioteca, which is the basis of the modern Spanish word</p>
<p>biblioteca and the French word biblioth√®que.</p>
<p>In English, it gave us the word Bible, which was originally used in the sense of a collection</p>
<p>of books.</p>
<p>Today, we think of the Bible as a single book thanks to printing technology, which allows</p>
<p>it to be printed in a single volume.</p>
<p>But originally, the word Bible referred to the collection of the various individual books</p>
<p>which make up the Bible.</p>
<p>It was the Greeks who coined the term tabiblia for the collection of scriptures.</p>
<p>And Latin barred the use of the term, and like many biblical terms, it passed into English</p>
<p>during the period of Middle English.</p>
<p>As I said, the Phoenician city-state of Byblos produced papyrus, which was used for paper.</p>
<p>The Greeks used the term papyros, which was later adopted into Latin as papyrus.</p>
<p>And from Latin, French took the word as papier, which passed into English as paper in the</p>
<p>Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The Greeks also created the word chartus, which meant a leaf of papyrus.</p>
<p>And this word also came to mean paper.</p>
<p>In Latin, the word chartus became charta, which meant either a leaf of papyrus or something</p>
<p>written on papyrus.</p>
<p>And from this Latin word, we get the English words chart and charter.</p>
<p>The same Latin word, charta, passed through Italian into French as cartel, meaning a letter</p>
<p>of defiance.</p>
<p>And English borrowed that term in the 17th century to refer to a written agreement between</p>
<p>nations.</p>
<p>And the Germans borrowed the same word, but applied it to a commercial agreement between</p>
<p>private companies or industries.</p>
<p>And English later adopted this use of the term cartel as well.</p>
<p>So words like Bible, paper, chart, charter, and cartel all come from the early Greeks</p>
<p>and relate to the Phoenician paper trade.</p>
<p>Now with all of this trade, it was essential to have a good writing system for maintaining</p>
<p>trade records.</p>
<p>Hieroglyphic and cuneiform writing were syllable-based writing systems that were cumbersome and limited</p>
<p>to a relatively few people who could actually read and write them.</p>
<p>But fortunately for the Phoenicians, they had something special in their possession.</p>
<p>It was an alphabet.</p>
<p>Remember from the last episode that the alphabet was different from the syllable-based writing</p>
<p>systems that had been used up to this point, like hieroglyphics and cuneiform and Greek</p>
<p>linear A and linear B scripts.</p>
<p>There are lots of potential syllables in any given language.</p>
<p>That means if you&rsquo;re going to write in a syllabic script, you have to memorize a separate symbol</p>
<p>for each syllable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a daunting task.</p>
<p>But the alphabet was revolutionary in that it broke down words beyond the level of syllables</p>
<p>all the way down to their basic phonemes or sounds.</p>
<p>And all languages only have a few basic phonemes, usually around a couple of dozen, maybe a</p>
<p>few more.</p>
<p>So if you break words down to the level of their basic sounds or phonemes, you only need</p>
<p>to memorize and learn a few basic symbols or letters.</p>
<p>And you can spell every word in that language.</p>
<p>In modern English, we have 26 letters, and they do all the work.</p>
<p>Even small children can learn them.</p>
<p>And with something so simple to learn and master, it means a far greater portion of</p>
<p>the population can read and write.</p>
<p>In other words, the alphabet enabled the spread of literacy beyond a small handful of scribes.</p>
<p>And here is perhaps the most fascinating thing about the alphabet which most of the world</p>
<p>uses today.</p>
<p>It appears likely that all alphabetic writing systems used today, and all alphabets that</p>
<p>have ever existed, came from one original source.</p>
<p>The alphabet was invented once, and it&rsquo;s been borrowed over and over again ever since.</p>
<p>Now by this point in our story, an early version of the alphabet had been used by Semitic speakers</p>
<p>throughout Canaan and even down into the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>But it appears that it was only being used by Semitic speakers.</p>
<p>So linguists assumed that the alphabet was invented by early Semitic speakers.</p>
<p>And up until as recently as 1999, the general thought was that this invention had occurred</p>
<p>in Canaan itself, given that most of the early archaeological evidence of the alphabet was</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>But all of that changed in the 1990s, when the oldest known alphabetic writing was discovered</p>
<p>by a gentleman named John Darnell in a remote part of Egypt.</p>
<p>And in 1999, the inscriptions he found were confirmed to be written in an alphabet, and</p>
<p>those inscriptions were determined to have been written around 2000 BC.</p>
<p>Now this was an earlier form of the Semitic alphabet, and it probably represents an alphabet</p>
<p>created by some of the many Semitic tribes in Egypt during this period who were either</p>
<p>Egyptian slaves or workers.</p>
<p>Remember that the Hebrews were part of this same storyline of early Semitic tribes providing</p>
<p>service to the Pharaoh.</p>
<p>And it appears that this early alphabet spread with the spread of Semitic tribes northward</p>
<p>from Egypt into the Arabian Peninsula and eventually into Canaan.</p>
<p>The alphabet used by the Canaanites used just 22 letters.</p>
<p>All of them were consonants.</p>
<p>The Semitic languages were very rich in consonants, and they had very few vowels.</p>
<p>And this is apparent even in modern Semitic languages like Hebrew and Arabic.</p>
<p>So the Semitic scribes didn&rsquo;t really need vowels.</p>
<p>The consonant letters alone were sufficient to indicate the Semitic word that was being</p>
<p>used.</p>
<p>Now regardless of the ultimate source of the Canaanite alphabet, the Phoenicians had inherited</p>
<p>it from their Semitic Canaanite ancestors.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve said, the alphabet was easy to learn, and it was easy to implement.</p>
<p>And the Phoenicians&rsquo; extensive trading activities allowed their alphabet to spread throughout</p>
<p>the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at this point that we can join the discussion of the Phoenicians with the Greeks.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the Greeks were the only maritime power that could compete with</p>
<p>the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>And during the Greek Dark Age period and the following few centuries, the Greeks and the</p>
<p>Phoenicians carved out their own spheres of influence around the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The Phoenicians controlled the southern Mediterranean, and the Greeks controlled the north.</p>
<p>And these were the two great seafaring peoples of the ancient world.</p>
<p>And therefore it should not be surprising that we get many nautical terms from the Greeks.</p>
<p>The Greek word for ship was naus.</p>
<p>And the Greeks coined the term nausea to represent the sick feeling that people sometimes</p>
<p>experienced on ships.</p>
<p>And this word comes into English virtually unchanged as nausea.</p>
<p>The Romans adopted the Greek term as novice in Latin, and from there it produced words</p>
<p>like navy and navigate and nautical in modern English.</p>
<p>With sea trade came crime and theft on the open sea, as well as other places.</p>
<p>And the modern word for pirate comes from the ancient Greek word peirat, which meant</p>
<p>one who attacks.</p>
<p>The word was adopted by the Romans and ultimately found its way into English via the French</p>
<p>after the Norman invasion in an almost unaltered form to this day.</p>
<p>Even the name for the Mediterranean Sea itself derives from the early Greeks.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks, as well as the ancient Romans, called the Mediterranean Sea the Inland</p>
<p>Sea because of its vast size and the fact that it connected all of the important trade</p>
<p>routes including Rome and Greece and Carthage and the other surrounding areas of the Middle</p>
<p>East and North Africa.</p>
<p>And from their perspective, it was a vast sea located in the middle of the land masses</p>
<p>which we know today as Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>So the word Mediterranean basically means inland by combining the words medium and terra.</p>
<p>So medium and terra equals Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Medium means middle and terra means land.</p>
<p>So Mediterranean Sea literally means middle land sea or inland sea.</p>
<p>Now as I&rsquo;ve said, the Phoenicians and the Greeks were the dominant maritime and trading</p>
<p>powers of the region.</p>
<p>And that also meant they engaged in a great deal of trade with each other.</p>
<p>And it was this trading contact that apparently led to the spread of the Phoenician alphabet</p>
<p>to the Greeks.</p>
<p>It appears that the Greeks encountered the Phoenician alphabet through trading contact</p>
<p>on Crete and the surrounding port cities.</p>
<p>Remember that the Greeks had lost the ability to write their own language during the Greek</p>
<p>Dark Age.</p>
<p>So here was a simple and easy to learn writing system which could be quickly adopted for</p>
<p>the commercial and record-keeping needs of the Greeks.</p>
<p>And since it was the same system which the Phoenicians used, it ensured efficiency in</p>
<p>the Mediterranean trading networks.</p>
<p>The Greeks adopted the alphabet for trading and commercial purposes probably around the</p>
<p>10th century BC.</p>
<p>And once adopted, the utilitarian nature of the alphabet allowed it to spread like wildfire</p>
<p>throughout the Greek world.</p>
<p>Now there are a few things to keep in mind about how the Greeks adopted the Phoenician</p>
<p>alphabet.</p>
<p>Remember that the Phoenician language was a Semitic language which was completely different</p>
<p>from the Indo-European Greek language.</p>
<p>The Greek language had lots of vowels, but the Phoenician language had very few vowels.</p>
<p>And the Phoenicians had consonant sounds which the Greeks didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So the Greeks basically took the letters which represented the consonant sounds which the</p>
<p>Greeks had.</p>
<p>But the Greeks had to invent letters for vowels since vowels were so important to the Greek</p>
<p>language and the Phoenician alphabet didn&rsquo;t have letters for vowels.</p>
<p>So they took the Phoenician letters for consonants which they didn&rsquo;t need and they converted</p>
<p>those letters into vowels.</p>
<p>For example, the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet was aleph and it represented a consonant</p>
<p>sound which didn&rsquo;t exist in Greek.</p>
<p>So Greek converted the letter into a vowel which we know today as a.</p>
<p>They added an a to the end of the name and the Phoenician consonant aleph became the</p>
<p>Greek vowel alpha.</p>
<p>So even though the letter now represented a completely different sound in Greek, it</p>
<p>retained its position at the head of the line.</p>
<p>The letter a continued as the first letter of the alphabet but now it represented a vowel.</p>
<p>The very early Greeks also adopted the Semitic pattern of writing from right to left like</p>
<p>the Phoenicians and which is still found in modern Hebrew.</p>
<p>But sometimes the Greeks changed directions at the end of a sentence in a back and forth</p>
<p>style of writing and eventually they shifted to the left to right style that we use today.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks also didn&rsquo;t use punctuation.</p>
<p>There were no spaces between words so words flowed into each other and eventually the</p>
<p>Greeks began to place a short mark under the first word in a line where a new thought or</p>
<p>idea was being expressed.</p>
<p>This line was called a paragraphos which meant to write beside and this came to mean paragraph</p>
<p>which is part of a written text which represents a new or unique idea.</p>
<p>The Greeks also gave us the word asterisk based on the Greek word aster which means</p>
<p>star in Greek.</p>
<p>A little star was an asteriskos, the term which describes the asterisk.</p>
<p>Over time Greeks found it useful to actually develop a system of punctuation to make reading</p>
<p>easier and as a result many of the punctuation marks we use today date back to the Greeks.</p>
<p>The hyphen for example was originally a curved line that resembled a smile which linked two</p>
<p>words together and the name comes from the Greek word hypo meaning under and hyn meaning</p>
<p>one and we get the word hyphen from that.</p>
<p>And the apostrophe was used by the Greeks to indicate that a vowel had been dropped</p>
<p>before or after another vowel and the comma, the period, and colon all come from Greek</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>So with this new writing system in place the Greek dark age period finally ended because</p>
<p>written records started to be kept again.</p>
<p>And this new Greek alphabet led to the renewal of writing and the recording of history and</p>
<p>it led to the spread of literacy and the development of literature.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the last episode, the end of the dark age and the reappearance of writing</p>
<p>is closely associated with the writing of Homer&rsquo;s Iliad and the Odyssey and both of</p>
<p>those epic poems took the form which we&rsquo;ve come to know them around 850 BC to 750 BC.</p>
<p>And Greek literature flourished during the classical Greek period which followed.</p>
<p>Greek drama, epics, history, and philosophy emerged in a written form which could be kept</p>
<p>for posterity and in doing so these writings essentially formed the basis of Western thought</p>
<p>and civilization.</p>
<p>All that we attribute to the classical Greek civilization would never have had the long</p>
<p>term impact it&rsquo;s had had it not been written down and saved for posterity.</p>
<p>Around 600 BC a Greek named Aesop created a set of tales and fables which come down</p>
<p>to us as Aesop&rsquo;s fables.</p>
<p>These fables typically told a story with a moral lesson.</p>
<p>They included the tortoise and the hare, the boy who cried wolf, and the goose that laid</p>
<p>the golden eggs among many others.</p>
<p>So all of these stories were written down shortly after the adoption of the Greek alphabet</p>
<p>during this early spread of literacy.</p>
<p>The spread of writing also allowed for the adoption of written laws so legal codes began</p>
<p>to develop.</p>
<p>It was important to instill a sense of law and order and in Athens a lawgiver named Draco</p>
<p>was asked to reform the Greek criminal justice system.</p>
<p>At around 621 BC he issued a set of laws which set out specific penalties for specific crimes.</p>
<p>But Draco didn&rsquo;t appear to spend much time focusing on varying degrees of punishment.</p>
<p>Almost all crimes, including some trivial offenses, were punishable by the death penalty.</p>
<p>Needless to say the laws were considered a bit harsh and they were soon repealed but</p>
<p>their legacy lives on in modern English.</p>
<p>We still use the term draconian to describe rules or laws which are extremely harsh.</p>
<p>By the early 5th century BC literacy was spreading throughout Greece.</p>
<p>And we get a clue as to the spread of literacy in Athens by this time in the root of the</p>
<p>modern English word ostracize which comes to us from this period of Greek history.</p>
<p>In Athens undesirable or dangerous persons could be expelled from the city by a vote</p>
<p>at a special meeting of adult male citizens.</p>
<p>And their votes were cast on broken bits of pottery called ostraca and these expelled</p>
<p>persons were ostracized which is the source of the modern English word.</p>
<p>Now the fact that the Athenians could vote by writing down names suggest a degree of</p>
<p>literacy that was previously unknown.</p>
<p>Some handwriting analysis of artifacts indicates that a small number of scribes may have actually</p>
<p>written the names at the verbal instruction of the citizens.</p>
<p>But even if that was the case it appears that most Athenians, especially male Athenians,</p>
<p>could read and write by the end of the 5th century BC.</p>
<p>By this point the Phoenician city states which had given Greece the alphabet were in a period</p>
<p>of major decline.</p>
<p>The Phoenician cities were attacked by Babylonians, the Persian Empire, and eventually the Greeks</p>
<p>themselves under Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>The lack of major regional powers had helped the tiny Phoenician territory to emerge as</p>
<p>a maritime power and maintain its independence.</p>
<p>But with the rise of new regional powers like the Persians and the Greeks, the Phoenician&rsquo;s</p>
<p>days were numbered.</p>
<p>But as the power of the Phoenician homeland faded, its North African colony at Carthage</p>
<p>flourished.</p>
<p>But more on that story when we get through the Romans in a couple more episodes.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now at the cusp of the Classical Greek period which we all learned about in</p>
<p>school.</p>
<p>So next time I&rsquo;m going to do a brief overview of this period and look at the large number</p>
<p>of words from this Classical Greek period which have made their way into English.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
