    <p>By January 1987, Marshall County authorities were noticing a pattern emerging.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt read from Sergeant Dave Yokelet&rsquo;s case summary.</p>
<p>In the past several years, since 1982, this officer has been involved in the investigating</p>
<p>of several violent crimes that have occurred in the extreme southern portion of Marshall</p>
<p>County, Indiana.</p>
<p>Two of those crimes involved homicides, one of which was in 1984, the Hulse Homicide,</p>
<p>the other in 1986, the Peltz Homicide.</p>
<p>In each of the three cases that have been investigated, I have found to be a two-year</p>
<p>interval.</p>
<p>The geographical area and the close proximity of each of these cases are a concern of this</p>
<p>investigator.</p>
<p>Yokelet starts that window of time in 1982 because he&rsquo;s including Pam&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>If you remember from last episode, Pam is the woman who survived a break-in and attempted</p>
<p>rape in December of 1982.</p>
<p>That was the first of the three cases.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing I can find that shows what exactly the thread was that finally connected</p>
<p>all three.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight years later, and the people in charge today say that they don&rsquo;t know either.</p>
<p>But I think it was just one of those things, like an autostereogram.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fuzzy until you see it.</p>
<p>And then once the image within the picture emerges, you can&rsquo;t unsee it.</p>
<p>Brandy was killed just a mile and a half away from Darlene in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why Darlene&rsquo;s case, which was still fresh in everyone&rsquo;s mind, was compared.</p>
<p>But unlike Darlene, Brandy got a harassing phone call before her death.</p>
<p>And maybe that is the piece of red string that they were connecting from Brandy to Pam.</p>
<p>Because if you remember, Pam, too, got a harassing call right before the intruder broke</p>
<p>into her home.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re looking at Pam&rsquo;s case, you&rsquo;re reminded just how similar that was to Darlene&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>Darlene&rsquo;s body was found just a stone&rsquo;s throw away from Pam&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>On their own, they can seem different.</p>
<p>But all together, you see the picture, right?</p>
<p>A triangle of connections from each case back to the other.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dave Yokelet had no idea if he was right.</p>
<p>But there was a way he could begin to find out.</p>
<p>This is Episode 7.</p>
<p>Bring in the FBI.</p>
<p>If the string connecting Pam and Brandy&rsquo;s case was the phone calls, then that is where</p>
<p>police were going to start.</p>
<p>For the first time, it seems.</p>
<p>Because in December of 1987, there is documentation of police requesting the phone records for</p>
<p>Pam&rsquo;s home from August of 1982 to January of 1983.</p>
<p>They requested such a large window of time because Pam had other harassing phone calls</p>
<p>prior to the break-in.</p>
<p>She even got one after, where the man breathed into the phone and said that he was the one</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d been inside her home.</p>
<p>She reported all of those calls to police.</p>
<p>For some reason, officers never checked to see where the calls had come from in 1982.</p>
<p>Or even in 1984, after Darlene was murdered and left in a wooded field right by Pam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house.</p>
<p>So why now, you ask?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>One I&rsquo;d love to get the answer to.</p>
<p>But no one connected to the investigation has given us a solid answer.</p>
<p>So I can only guess, but I think I have a good guess.</p>
<p>It stems from the way I hear people, mostly men, talk about Pam&rsquo;s case now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll tell you, yeah, he broke in, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s how they thought about it then.</p>
<p>Nothing really happened.</p>
<p>After Darlene&rsquo;s murder, it&rsquo;s clear from the tips that were called in and the canvassing</p>
<p>that was done that harassing phone calls were commonplace in Argus at the time.</p>
<p>So even though a line had been crossed, a very serious, very physical line into Pam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>home, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot of resources were expended trying to figure out who that</p>
<p>man was that crossed the line.</p>
<p>Pam went on to live in fear after her attack.</p>
<p>She always wondered what the man in her home was capable of, if he would escalate.</p>
<p>And now, with a woman dead and a child dead, a child who had received a similar call, police</p>
<p>were probably wondering if this guy had escalated.</p>
<p>So now they decide to pull Pam&rsquo;s phone records.</p>
<p>They got the call logs back almost immediately after requesting them in December of 1987.</p>
<p>And that was it.</p>
<p>Once they had those, Pam&rsquo;s case was solved.</p>
<p>That easy.</p>
<p>The harassing calls pointed to one man, a guy from nearby Culver, Indiana, named Kenneth</p>
<p>McCune, Jr.</p>
<p>Two calls prior to the break-in at Pam&rsquo;s house were made from Kenneth&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>And the one made to Pam&rsquo;s house just before the home invasion was from Kenneth&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>barn where he worked.</p>
<p>Now Kenneth wasn&rsquo;t exactly a stranger to police, but he also wasn&rsquo;t considered a</p>
<p>local bad boy the way that Ricky Mock and Danny Bender had been.</p>
<p>While those guys seemed hard up for cash, Kenneth&rsquo;s criminal motivations seemed sexually</p>
<p>driven because he had been accused of being a serial flasher.</p>
<p>There had been several complaints made by women about a man flashing his penis in different</p>
<p>places around the county, and one of those women specifically identified Kenneth.</p>
<p>Police learned that Kenneth went to high school in Culver, but lived in rural Marshall County,</p>
<p>not too far from where Pam lived, and not too far from where Darlene&rsquo;s body was found.</p>
<p>They also learned that he had worked as a farmhand on his uncle&rsquo;s farm, which was</p>
<p>even closer to the woods where Darlene&rsquo;s body was found.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d also worked as a bus driver for Culver School District and dabbled in used car sales</p>
<p>throughout the 80s alongside his dad, Kenneth Sr.</p>
<p>Now they knew they had Kenneth Jr. for Pam&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Along with the phone records pinning him as the caller, there was actually a tip early</p>
<p>on in Pam&rsquo;s case from Kenneth&rsquo;s sister, saying that she saw her brother&rsquo;s truck</p>
<p>in front of Pam&rsquo;s house the morning of the crime.</p>
<p>Now she had a caveat in that very same statement, saying that it wasn&rsquo;t her brother&rsquo;s truck,</p>
<p>just one that looked exactly like it.</p>
<p>But his name was there, in their case file, from just weeks after Pam&rsquo;s attack.</p>
<p>But they weren&rsquo;t ready to move in on Kenneth just yet.</p>
<p>If this was bigger than just Pam, they wanted to be sure.</p>
<p>So Sgt.</p>
<p>Yocolet pulled in the big guns, and he wrote to the FBI.</p>
<p>The undersigned investigating the homicides of Brandy Peltz and Darlene Hulse and the</p>
<p>home invasion of Pam, has investigated these crimes from the standpoint of being individual</p>
<p>cases, and that the assailants responsible for those cases are separate individuals and</p>
<p>that these cases are unrelated, and it is only coincidence that they have occurred within</p>
<p>a particular geographical area.</p>
<p>At the same time, this officer has geared my investigations to include that very well,</p>
<p>that all three of these cases may be linked together, and I base that opinion on several</p>
<p>similarities that I feel exist in each of these cases.</p>
<p>In total, the summary Sgt.</p>
<p>Yocolet submitted was five pages long and went over every detail he knew of each crime.</p>
<p>Yocolet was requesting help.</p>
<p>He was looking for insight into what characteristics they could expect to find in the perpetrator</p>
<p>of the Hulse homicide.</p>
<p>But I also think, by including information about the other cases, Sgt.</p>
<p>Yocolet was trying to see if the FBI saw the same connection he did.</p>
<p>From the response he got, it doesn&rsquo;t look like the FBI even acknowledged the other cases.</p>
<p>They just honed in on the analysis of Darlene&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But what FBI agent Thomas Salp had to say about the profile of Darlene&rsquo;s killer was</p>
<p>very enlightening.</p>
<p>Offender characteristics and traits.</p>
<p>The offender in this case is a white male.</p>
<p>Our experience and research reflects that the behavioral factors noted in this crime</p>
<p>suggest that the offender would be from the low 20s to 30 years of age.</p>
<p>Our research and experience reflects that offenders will dispose of victims&rsquo; bodies</p>
<p>in locations that are familiar to them.</p>
<p>In this case, the remote, isolated area where the victim&rsquo;s body was found suggests that</p>
<p>the offender had a strong familiarity with the area, which is most likely due to having</p>
<p>lived, worked, or visited in the area.</p>
<p>Our experience relates that the offender would not have more than a high school education</p>
<p>and would not have done well scholastically.</p>
<p>His school records would likely reflect disruptive behavior.</p>
<p>He has an inadequate personality and is lacking in interpersonal skills.</p>
<p>He has a difficult time relating to females and feels insecure when in their company.</p>
<p>Any relationships with females would be marked with conflict or even physical violence.</p>
<p>His choice of female companionship would be with someone considerably younger than him</p>
<p>that he would be able to dominate.</p>
<p>We would expect him to be living alone or with a significant family member, such as</p>
<p>a domineering mother, older sister, or grandmother, upon whom he is somewhat dependent.</p>
<p>He would be described by others as a loner and likely does not have a close circle of friends.</p>
<p>The brutality at the crime scene reflects anger, resulting from short- or long-term</p>
<p>stressors in the offender&rsquo;s life experiences.</p>
<p>Our research and experience reflect that these precipitating stressors can be the result</p>
<p>of conflict with a significant female in the offender&rsquo;s life, employment pressures, death</p>
<p>of a significant person, etc.</p>
<p>The use of drugs or alcohol by the offender in this case should not be ruled out.</p>
<p>Although the offender apparently brought duct tape with him, the crime scene does not reflect</p>
<p>a great deal of criminal sophistication.</p>
<p>The offender likely has a police record that would reflect assaultive-type behavior, possibly</p>
<p>sexual assault, and drug or alcohol-related violations.</p>
<p>If the offender is employed, it would be in unskilled to semi-skilled work and he would</p>
<p>have a spotty work record, which also reflects an inability to work well with others.</p>
<p>The time of the assault also indicates that the offender did not have to account for his</p>
<p>time on that morning.</p>
<p>If the offender owns a vehicle, it would reflect his financial and social standing in the community.</p>
<p>Post-offensive behavior.</p>
<p>After disposing of the victim&rsquo;s body, the offender would have gone to a location he</p>
<p>considered safe to decompress.</p>
<p>He would not have any remorse for his crime, and his only concern would be a fear of being</p>
<p>connected to the crime.</p>
<p>He would have cleaned the blood from his clothes, however our experience indicates that this</p>
<p>offender would not be likely to dispose of the clothes he wore during the commission</p>
<p>of the crime.</p>
<p>The offender would have become reclusive for several days following the crime, and would</p>
<p>have tried to establish an alibi in case he was questioned by the police.</p>
<p>If he was employed, he may have provided a reason to be absent from work the day after</p>
<p>the crime.</p>
<p>His physical appearance would have deteriorated more than usual, and if he uses drugs or alcohol,</p>
<p>his consumption of those products would have increased.</p>
<p>Persons who know him well would have recognized his increased anxiety.</p>
<p>If contacted by the police, he likely would have appeared cooperative, but would have</p>
<p>claimed no knowledge about the crime.</p>
<p>He would probably have followed the progress of the investigation through the media and</p>
<p>by overhearing others in the community.</p>
<p>However, the offender would not be likely to engage in conversation about the crime.</p>
<p>At the time, there was only one person to hold up against this profile and compare.</p>
<p>Kenneth McCune Jr.</p>
<p>On one hand, a few of the characteristic traits matched McCune to a T. Familiar with the area?</p>
<p>Check.</p>
<p>Only a high school degree?</p>
<p>Check.</p>
<p>Odd jobs?</p>
<p>No established career?</p>
<p>Check, check.</p>
<p>He even slightly resembled the suspect description with his long, skinny nose.</p>
<p>But one thing that didn&rsquo;t match was the fact that Kenneth was married, with kids.</p>
<p>Knowing what they knew about Kenneth&rsquo;s alleged flashing habits, that fact puzzled investigators.</p>
<p>It seems that in 1988, Yocolet tried to talk to Kenneth specifically about Darlene&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a reenactment of that transcript.</p>
<p>Kenny, you&rsquo;re familiar with the investigation I&rsquo;ve been conducting into the death of Darlene</p>
<p>Hulse?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Were you familiar with Darlene Hulse?</p>
<p>I knew where she lived.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How was it you knew where she lived?</p>
<p>Well, one time, me and my dad had baled some straw or some hay down a road, and when that</p>
<p>happened, the way it was described to me where it had happened was associated with that particular</p>
<p>year we baled the hay, as far as, you know, my memory goes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d never seen Mrs. Hulse when you were baling hay or driving up and down the road?</p>
<p>I could, yeah, I think.</p>
<p>Do you remember where you saw her at?</p>
<p>I think she, I went down in front of the house and the kids were outside or something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Were there any other times, other than this, that you&rsquo;d saw Mrs. Hulse anywhere?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know if I would recognize her, you know, walking down the street or anything.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That was only part of the transcript of Kenneth&rsquo;s interview with Sergeant Yocolet.</p>
<p>We have this part because the recording of that interview was played during a court proceeding</p>
<p>that we did a records request for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only part they played in court, and we don&rsquo;t have documentation of the full</p>
<p>interview, so I&rsquo;m not sure where the conversation went from there.</p>
<p>And we weren&rsquo;t able to find any further documentation about how or even if they tried to connect</p>
<p>Kenneth to Darlene&rsquo;s case back in 1987.</p>
<p>And obviously, a few similarities in an FBI profile aren&rsquo;t enough to accuse him of murder.</p>
<p>So later that year, they just moved forward with cases that they did have evidence for.</p>
<p>In November 1987, police charged Kenneth with public indecency for one of the flashing incidents,</p>
<p>the one where the victim identified him.</p>
<p>And a month later, they arrested him for the 1982 home invasion and attempted rape of Pam.</p>
<p>At first, Kenneth had denied the crime, but when he realized that police not only had</p>
<p>record of him calling and harassing her, but they also had collected blood on her doorframe</p>
<p>where the intruder had cut himself and it belonged to him, the jig was up.</p>
<p>Kenneth admitted to everything and took a plea deal for a lesser charge of burglary.</p>
<p>The prosecutor just dropped the attempted rape charge altogether.</p>
<p>Oh, and that indecent exposure case, that actually went to trial.</p>
<p>Kenneth was acquitted, but according to the transcript from his 1989 sentence modification hearing,</p>
<p>he admitted that it was actually him.</p>
<p>Now, I want to take just two seconds and acknowledge how infuriating this must have been for Pam.</p>
<p>All these years, they had the evidence they needed to solve her case,</p>
<p>but it took two more people dying for them to thoroughly investigate it.</p>
<p>And when they finally did, the end result had to feel like what they were saying all along.</p>
<p>Well, nothing really happened to you.</p>
<p>He just broke in.</p>
<p>She deserved to be believed from the beginning.</p>
<p>And I guess delayed justice is better than nothing,</p>
<p>but it meant that she lived in fear for nearly five years before Kenneth was finally arrested.</p>
<p>Despite being caught in a lie over Pam&rsquo;s assault,</p>
<p>Kenneth denied having anything to do with Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He went on to serve time in prison until 1991, and then he went on to live a crime-free life.</p>
<p>His wife stayed with him, they raised their daughters,</p>
<p>he kept a job and even volunteered in his community.</p>
<p>Now, we don&rsquo;t have access to any of the reports or documentation on Brandy&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know if Kenneth was ever questioned about her murder.</p>
<p>We asked prosecutor Nelson Chipman, who is in charge of that case today,</p>
<p>if they were ever able to trace the call Brandy got before her murder,</p>
<p>and if any calls were linked back to Kenneth McCune.</p>
<p>But he wouldn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>I would highly doubt anything in Brandy&rsquo;s case was ever linked back to Kenneth.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned last episode, her case went on to garner far more attention,</p>
<p>and he has never been named by anyone official or otherwise in connection to the case.</p>
<p>Like I said last episode, after Brandy was murdered, her death really overshadowed Darlene&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And former Sergeant Dave Yokelet seemed to take offense today</p>
<p>when I told them Darlene&rsquo;s name isn&rsquo;t known around town,</p>
<p>because they say they remember it so well.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>After 1987, Darlene&rsquo;s case had come to a screeching halt,</p>
<p>and it stayed there for damn near 40 years.</p>
<p>That is, until the one daughter, who was too young to remember anything,</p>
<p>started asking questions.</p>
<p>I remember Dad saying, if you have any questions, you can go ask Marie Melissa.</p>
<p>So I started inquiring then.</p>
<p>You were young.</p>
<p>I mean, we always told you.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t remember, like you said, a knot.</p>
<p>It was never a secret.</p>
<p>Do you remember how old you were when you started asking your sister&rsquo;s questions?</p>
<p>Seven or eight.</p>
<p>I remember sitting on the steps in the garage and asking some things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll never forget one time Melissa said the one thing that she regrets</p>
<p>was not getting me, not grabbing me when we were running out.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s kind of piqued my interest, like what do you mean?</p>
<p>Like, where was I?</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>So then I started asking more.</p>
<p>And I just always told myself, when I get older,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do some digging and see what I can find</p>
<p>or if I can ask questions that I want to know about to the detectives.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of where I&rsquo;m coming from.</p>
<p>And then it got to a point about seven years ago where I was like, OK,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do this.</p>
<p>What Kristen would go on to do would completely</p>
<p>the trajectory of her mother&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s next in episode eight.</p>
<p>It all goes through one guy.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
