Hi, happy Friday, dear readers and listeners. Hope you&amp;rsquo;re well and enjoying the start to the
new year. We are finishing up the week over here. We&amp;rsquo;re really excited and enervated after our first

    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Connie Loizis, and this is Alex Gove, and this is Strictly VC Download.</p>
<p>Hi, happy Friday, dear readers and listeners. Hope you&rsquo;re well and enjoying the start to the</p>
<p>new year. We are finishing up the week over here. We&rsquo;re really excited and enervated after our first</p>
<p>Strictly VC Insider Evening of the year last night in San Francisco. We had a great time,</p>
<p>we saw a lot of readers, and we thoroughly enjoyed the different discussions that were happening.</p>
<p>Toward that end, we do not have a new segment for you this week, but we do have interviews</p>
<p>with some makers and shakers and builders to share with you, starting with Alfred Lin of Sequoia</p>
<p>Capital, a longtime operator who has been a partner with Sequoia for the last 12 years,</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s mostly had a very smooth ride, until two months ago. Lin was, for better and now worse,</p>
<p>credited with leading the firm into its sizable investment in the crypto exchange FTX.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll hear, he argues that the bet wasn&rsquo;t quite as disastrous for the firm</p>
<p>as it may seem. Though they wrote off roughly $200 million, Sequoia is managing so much money</p>
<p>at this point that the capital really represents a tiny amount of their assets under management.</p>
<p>Of course, it is still a black eye for the firm, which seemingly wasn&rsquo;t asking enough questions.</p>
<p>But again, as Lin tells it, the problem was really that the firm was dealing with someone</p>
<p>who has a strange relationship with the truth. Either way, we really appreciated Lin&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>we thought his answers to our questions about FTX were thoughtful, and we hope you enjoyed</p>
<p>the conversation. More from the event to come, by the way, but first, a word from our sponsor.</p>
<p>Did you know that incorrectly reporting your emissions, or worse yet, not understanding them</p>
<p>in the first place, is a form of greenwashing? It&rsquo;s time to get ahead of regulations and quit</p>
<p>misleading customers and stakeholders. Get a handle on your carbon footprint with Sustain</p>

<p>your ESG program. Visit sustain.life slash strictly VC. That&rsquo;s sustain.life slash strictly VC.</p>
<p>So guys, thank you all for coming. And let&rsquo;s offer a warm welcome to Alfred Lin,</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;m so excited is here. Also, Alfred, I have to apologize. These chairs were my idea,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna like swallow us whole. It&rsquo;ll be fine. So, you know, everyone here knows who</p>
<p>you are, and they&rsquo;re excited to see you. But just in case, I have a friend&rsquo;s son,</p>
<p>for example, who&rsquo;s here, who&rsquo;s a senior in high school, may not know you. Alfred famously was</p>
<p>an operator at Link Exchange and Tell Me and Zappos, two of those operations with your Harvard</p>
<p>classmate, the wonderful, widely beloved Tony Hsieh. As it happens, Zappos was backed by Sequoia</p>
<p>Capital, and unsurprisingly, Sequoia thought that you knew what you were doing when it came to</p>
<p>company building, brought you in more than 12 years ago, which is kind of amazing. It kind of</p>
<p>goes by quickly. And now you&rsquo;re on the boards, you represent Sequoia on the boards of Airbnb,</p>
<p>DoorDash, a really interesting company called Dolls Kill for misfits and mislegits.</p>
<p>And also a company that I hope we have a time to talk about today, the global market maker,</p>
<p>Citadel Securities, which I think is interesting. It&rsquo;s kind of funny, because I&rsquo;ve, I mean, I know</p>
<p>who you are. And I believe we&rsquo;ve talked in the past, but I&rsquo;ve never met you in person. I feel</p>
<p>like I do know you, because you&rsquo;ve been so prominent. We haven&rsquo;t met a lot of people in</p>
<p>person in the last three years. Right, right, the last three years, right. We&rsquo;ll subtract those out.</p>
<p>But I mean, I feel like I was aware of you even before you went to Sequoia. But now you&rsquo;re with,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;ve been with Sequoia. Sequoia is this incredible firm when you think about it. I</p>
<p>mean, Sequoia has been crushing it for 50 years, which is really, you know, phenomenal. When you</p>
<p>think about the firms that were started in the late 60s and early 70s, most of them are gone,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re unrecognizable today. So, you know, I want to talk to you really about how the firm</p>
<p>maintains its kind of pole position over time. But before we get there, we have to talk about</p>
<p>the elephant in the room. FTX. Do we have to? I know, I&rsquo;m sorry. So, I mean, what&rsquo;s funny about</p>
<p>FTX, especially is that you were the Forbes list, the number one person on the Forbes list in 2021.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s amazing because of, you know, Airbnb and DoorDash and some of your other investments.</p>
<p>And then things were going along pretty well this year. And then, you know,</p>
<p>blammo, I guess, in November last year. So, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s probably overstating</p>
<p>it to say that this turns out to be like one of the worst investments in the history of venture</p>
<p>capital. I mean, which is, you know, very unfortunate. I think people are wondering,</p>
<p>obviously, how did this happen? Well, we work in a business where 30% of the time we strike out,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s going to happen. It&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve reflected on it. We looked at the diligence package again and</p>
<p>again on whether what we missed. We do extensive research and diligence when we make an investment.</p>
<p>This was this happened for this investment as well. And I think in retrospect, we looked at</p>
<p>a bunch of things, but we were, you know, sort of reflecting on it. We believe we&rsquo;re misled</p>
<p>for a variety of situations. And we&rsquo;ll find out when the court documents and the investigations</p>
<p>happen a lot more closely. I mean, I guess. And also, you know, you are a math whiz. You</p>
<p>studied applied mathematics and statistics. Were you given fake numbers? I mean, what did</p>
<p>you have to look at? We looked at balance sheets. We looked at organizational charts of where the</p>
<p>subsidiaries were. We looked at how much Alameda was a percentage of FTX&rsquo;s volume. We looked at</p>
<p>a variety of things. The company Alameda we knew was a hedge fund. We knew that they were trading</p>
<p>on FTX, but it was not on any of FTX&rsquo;s organizational charts. So we thought that they</p>
<p>were, when we asked, are these two companies independent? And we were told that they were.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think another thing that obviously shocked everybody was that</p>
<p>there was no board. And you invested something like $200 million across a couple of funds.</p>
<p>In retrospect, was that a responsible decision? You know, was it ever that you wanted to be on</p>
<p>the board and they said, you know, you can&rsquo;t be part of the deal in that case? Or what was</p>
<p>that discussion like? Well, we were investing in a late stage round. We owned less than 1%</p>
<p>of the company. It was less than 3% of our private fund, Global Growth Fund III. So we</p>
<p>invested $150 million out of that fund. We invested another $60 million or so out of</p>
<p>our hedge fund. And it was less than 1% of the assets of the hedge fund. So in some sense,</p>
<p>and yes, should we have asked for more board representation? We could have. But at the same</p>
<p>time, they didn&rsquo;t think that we deserved to be on the board because we own less than 1%</p>
<p>of the company. Yeah, that&rsquo;s really, I mean, it&rsquo;s stunning in retrospect, but that&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great point. It is stunning. And look, it was a lot of money that was lost. But if you</p>
<p>just take on the private side, $150 million investment, which was done over three rounds,</p>
<p>we invested $125 million to start. $150 million out of a $6.3 billion fund. If you lop off some</p>
<p>zeros, one zero, it&rsquo;d be $15 million out of a $630 million fund. And if you look at it that way,</p>
<p>which is how we looked at it from a risk management standpoint for Global Growth Fund 3,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like, fine, we can take a $15 million loss out of a $630 million venture fund. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we kind of looked at it from a risk management standpoint. The fact that you multiply</p>
<p>a zero to it makes the quantum look large. It doesn&rsquo;t make the percentage look large.</p>
<p>And that is the thing that sort of we had to wrestle with. So did we do what we could</p>
<p>to manage risk? Did we make a good investment? Did we do our diligence? And then if it goes wrong,</p>
<p>it goes wrong. We work in a business, again, 30% of the time, we&rsquo;re just wrong. We&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>lose money 30% of the time. This is more painful because of the quantum. And it doesn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel good. Sure. I mean,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard because it was such a high profile company. Sam Bankman Freed was literally plastered</p>
<p>all over San Francisco and many other cities. So it&rsquo;s, you know, going to be in the headlines for</p>
<p>a while. And obviously, the SEC is very interested in it as well. I&rsquo;m wondering,</p>
<p>they are reportedly talking to investors about their due diligence. I assume they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>to you since you are one of the highest profile firms, although there are many, many people</p>
<p>involved in this to your point about, you know, your ownership percentage. Do you think they</p>
<p>understand what you&rsquo;re telling me now? I think the SEC has a lot of smart people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of this. Though, there&rsquo;s a lot of forensic accounting that is being looked</p>
<p>at, and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of it. I think the concern for some is sometimes</p>
<p>something like this happens, and then you know, people start making proposals. Right now,</p>
<p>the SEC is apparently looking at ways to strip away, I guess, some of the investor protections</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re accused of bad behavior, sort of better enabling investors to come after them. I guess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just VCs, but hedge funds, private equity funds, certain real estate funds. This,</p>
<p>according to a political story that said it was kind of like imminent, the proposal is almost</p>
<p>done. I&rsquo;m just wondering, what do you think that would do to the industry?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I haven&rsquo;t read the proposal, so I don&rsquo;t know, but we&rsquo;re going to all have to follow the</p>
<p>regulation. And if the regulation is good, well, whether it&rsquo;s good or not, we have to follow it.</p>
<p>And we want the regulation to be good. So, well, as an industry, we&rsquo;ll have to talk to</p>
<p>the SEC about what controls and mechanisms do we want in the system.</p>
<p>I guess, do you think there&rsquo;s room for improvement in terms of,</p>
<p>due diligence and the way that, you know, VCs and other investors communicate with their LPs</p>
<p>and the transparency that they offer?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always room for improvement. The world moves forward. We learn from our mistakes.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have, just like historically, the institutions that have been created in the</p>
<p>United States have been great institutions that copied around the world, whether it&rsquo;s the Federal</p>
<p>Reserve, the SEC, etc. So, there&rsquo;s always room for improvement. And every time something like</p>
<p>this happens, we learn from it and we get better. So, I&rsquo;m hoping that we, you know, there was a lot</p>
<p>of commentary about the crypto industry wanting more clarity around regulation. I&rsquo;m hoping that</p>
<p>we do get that.</p>
<p>Right. I know I&rsquo;ve told people that, you know, that the crypto industry actually has been asking</p>
<p>for this for quite some time. I do want to just, you know, ask on a personal level, what your</p>
<p>impressions were of Sam Bankman Freed? And, relatedly, in retrospect, if you feel like there</p>
<p>were, you know, signs that you missed or not?</p>
<p>I thought he was very smart. I thought he was quite a good, you know, in terms of, like,</p>
<p>answering questions very logically. He answers questions very logically and very succinctly.</p>
<p>And the question is, could we have spotted any tells?</p>
<p>Yeah, were there any tells, in retrospect?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. If we, if I, you know, there&rsquo;s what I know today and what I knew at the time.</p>
<p>If I knew at the time, we wouldn&rsquo;t have invested. So, today, I think the thing that gets me</p>
<p>to reassess is that it&rsquo;s not that we made the investment, it&rsquo;s the year and a half working</p>
<p>relationship that we&rsquo;ve had. And, you know, we&rsquo;ve had a lot of discussions about, you know,</p>
<p>the relationship afterwards, but I still didn&rsquo;t see it. And that is difficult. And the one</p>
<p>thing I think about is, in the venture industry, it&rsquo;s a trust business. And, yes, we need to</p>
<p>trust and verify, and we try to verify what we can. But we start from a position of trust.</p>
<p>Because if we don&rsquo;t trust the founders that we work with, why would you ever invest in them?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. And I wonder, so that is hard, because you have a relationship with this</p>
<p>person over a year and a half, I don&rsquo;t know how often you saw him, but</p>
<p>I guess, do you have any sympathy for him now?</p>
<p>Sympathy.</p>
<p>Look, for a person who is as smart as he is, so let&rsquo;s put aside, we lost a lot of money.</p>
<p>For a person who is as smart as he is, if the allegations are true by the SEC,</p>
<p>these allegations go back past when we invested. If those allegations turn out to be true,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just simply, I levered too much, I made, you know, sort of, I&rsquo;ve made a mistake,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a mistake, the crypto market turned against him, I feel like, it&rsquo;s not sympathy, I feel bad for him, that he had to sort of resort to the type of things that he did</p>
<p>to either raise money or prop up the company, etc. Because I think he could have done it in a much more legit way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he also seems to still be a little bit, I don&rsquo;t know, deluded. I mean,</p>
<p>obviously, there&rsquo;s a lot of facts that still have to come to the surface. But he, you probably saw</p>
<p>that he started a substack today, sort of. Yeah, I read that when I woke up this morning.</p>
<p>The best part about this country is we presumed, we presume innocence until proven guilty. And so</p>
<p>we should give him that. He&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s going to have a stay in court. And he&rsquo;s going to be judged by</p>
<p>a jury. And we&rsquo;ll see what the what the evidence that both sides present.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sequoia finds itself in a very unusual position of, you know, being affiliated</p>
<p>with a company that&rsquo;s, you know, in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. And I did talk to some</p>
<p>LPs ahead of our sit down. And of course, they are very happy with Sequoia on the whole. But</p>
<p>but they have concerns about this, you know, one, one said, I don&rsquo;t care, nobody cares. It was,</p>
<p>you know, just a minute, part of the, you know, overall funding picture. But another said,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not about the money, it really is just that, for the first time ever, their faith</p>
<p>is like slightly shaken in Sequoia. This is not something that I don&rsquo;t I think they would tell you</p>
<p>because they, you know, respect you. And I think they fear the firm a little bit. But what do you</p>
<p>say to those, those LPs or that LP? I think it&rsquo;s good to question. And we question ourselves. So</p>
<p>before they, they don&rsquo;t need to tell us that because we&rsquo;re thinking about that internally</p>
<p>all the time. There&rsquo;s two things I was taught when I first joined the venture industry, one of which</p>
<p>is if you start your career with, with fear, and there&rsquo;s two sets, two sets of fears, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be a very good investor. One is the fear of missing out because you&rsquo;re going to be chasing</p>
<p>what other people are chasing. So you&rsquo;re not going to differentiate yourself against others,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just going to invest in what everybody else is investing in. The second is</p>
<p>the fear of looking stupid. And again, back to the fact that 30% of the time we lose money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to look stupid sometimes. You just can&rsquo;t look stupid all the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great advice. You know, I will say, a separate LP told me something interesting that</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of. And they said that Sequoia really does like when things are not maybe going</p>
<p>quite as well as they might hope, or maybe the market&rsquo;s down, that they really do try to</p>
<p>accommodate the LPs, including maybe charging them for capital invested versus capital under</p>
<p>management or capital committed. Is that is that accurate?</p>
<p>Well, I think just going back to like, when things are not going well, we focus on the long run. And</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve survived 50 years and every single downturn because we&rsquo;re focused on the long run. And this is</p>
<p>this is a not so fun year. Last year was not a not so fun year. This year may probably will</p>
<p>probably be a not so fun year. The not so fun years are the best times to invest. Because</p>
<p>all of the tourists are gone, both the tourist entrepreneurs as well as the tourist investors,</p>
<p>because it gets hard. And those are good times to build because your competitor is not going to have</p>
<p>an easy time investing. So if you&rsquo;re really, really good, you are, you have real insights,</p>
<p>and you have real products that you&rsquo;re building that solve real problems, you&rsquo;re going to shine.</p>
<p>And so these are great times to invest in terms of you&rsquo;re talking about we did, there are two funds</p>
<p>where we decided to charge only invested capital. That&rsquo;s both the crypto fund and our ecosystem fund.</p>
<p>Okay, so so quickly talking about those funds, you know, I did want to talk to you</p>
<p>more broadly about the evolution of Sequoia. I think these new two new initiatives are especially</p>
<p>interesting, the crypto fund and the fact that Sequoia decided that it wants to manage money,</p>
<p>or the investments, sort of for a longer period when the companies go public.</p>
<p>So going back to the crypto fund, again, you know, unfortunate timing, seemingly.</p>
<p>I think the LPs I talked to said, and I think this is kind of common throughout the industry,</p>
<p>the VCs here could probably attest to it. But sometimes when they have new funds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a little bit of, you know, the hope that the LPs are going to invest across funds.</p>
<p>So I think some of them, even though they maybe had discrete investments, discrete investments</p>
<p>in crypto funds sort of felt like we should put some money in the crypto fund that is apparently</p>
<p>not working out quite so well right now. My question is, will you continue on with</p>
<p>this strategy? Sorry for that very long winded question.</p>
<p>The crypto fund, I mean, the fund is still we raised $600 million from the fund,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve invested 10% of it. We&rsquo;re pretty disciplined about it. And we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no plan, we&rsquo;re going to continue with that fund. And just so you know, I think the just,</p>
<p>again, back to the when times are bad, I think there are still crypto founders who are building</p>
<p>for the future. And the need for some of the technology that is needed for crypto, the thesis</p>
<p>of it, which is to be able to create trust when trust doesn&rsquo;t exist through a blockchain. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still true. Just because prices, asset prices have come down, that investment thesis still holds.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just, we may be going through a slower time, we&rsquo;ll deploy,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll invest through a slower time, but we will continue to invest. We are long term optimistic</p>
<p>in crypto and in variety of other sectors. Were you were you surprised, though, I guess,</p>
<p>by how kind of interrelated and codependent some of these companies were or are on one another?</p>
<p>Was that a revelation to you? The whole economy is interrelated. The reason why asset prices have</p>
<p>come down is because interest rates are higher. So the world is more interrelated than we would</p>
<p>like to think we we think in discrete terms, and it turns out the world is quite correlated.</p>
<p>It is speaking of correlations, I guess, you know, public and private markets, everything&rsquo;s down.</p>
<p>So but again, just seemingly unfortunate timing, you know, launching the strategy of hanging on</p>
<p>to companies or holding on to stock longer than you would have, it&rsquo;s been reported,</p>
<p>oh, if Sequoia had gotten rid of Robinhood or Snowflake or, you know, other things,</p>
<p>they would have, you know, captured billions of dollars more for their LPs. You know,</p>
<p>if you could rewind the clock, 1824 months, would you do anything differently?</p>
<p>No, because we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re investors for the long run. So if you believe in these companies,</p>
<p>the only question we ask is whether you think these companies are going to be worth</p>
<p>more 10 years from now than today, not any short term, any three month period, one month period,</p>
<p>one year period. So the companies that are in the Sequoia Capital Fund that we&rsquo;ve distributed</p>
<p>into the Sequoia Capital Fund are companies like Airbnb and DoorDash and Snowflake.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure those company, Unity, I&rsquo;m pretty sure those companies</p>
<p>have long lasting value that can be created. They&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re run by builders,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building their product and service, and they serve massive amounts of customers.</p>
<p>They all have real revenue, and they&rsquo;re building for the long run. And if you had decided to sell</p>
<p>Amazon in 1999 at a high, yes, you would have done better than holding on to it until 2001.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;d be doing worse than holding it on until today. So it just depends on your</p>
<p>view of these companies. And we, we really pride ourselves on not looking at interim prices,</p>
<p>because you have the luxury in the private market as not having to look at prices every single day.</p>
<p>And somehow the company becomes public and you have, you want to look at them every single day,</p>
<p>seems a little silly. And it doesn&rsquo;t, if you believe in the long run, one of the best</p>
<p>advantages of holding is something called temporal arbitrage. You&rsquo;re just arbitraging people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nerves, because they don&rsquo;t like seeing volatility.</p>
<p>You know, so obviously the VCs in this room have, in most cases,</p>
<p>the luxury of kind of waiting out the market. Meanwhile, founders are very, very nervous.</p>
<p>I think a lot of them turn to Sequoia for advice on how to weather a sustained downturn,</p>
<p>you know, which is something that many, many of them have not seen previously. So</p>
<p>can you maybe talk for a few minutes just about mistakes that you see them making and, and, you</p>
<p>know. Well, instead of mistakes, it&rsquo;s a time to get back to basics and assess your business and</p>
<p>what is the real, what is your mission? What is the problem that you&rsquo;re really solving? And who,</p>
<p>and just go back to basics. If you have a great product or service, and you&rsquo;re continuing to</p>
<p>build for your customers, you&rsquo;ll do great. This is a time where it&rsquo;s it may be a bit rainy outside,</p>
<p>but this is a time when you can surpass all of your competition if you play your cards right.</p>
<p>And so the advice we give them is just be really, really judicious about what problem you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>solving for your customers. In terms of navigating this time, understand your cash, your cash runway</p>
<p>and your unit economics. And that&rsquo;s the side that we forgot for a while, which is eventually all of</p>
<p>these things have to be real businesses. And one of the exercises I give some of our founders is</p>
<p>just plot out your free cash flow and do a discounted cash flow of what interest because</p>
<p>interest rates have risen four to 5%. What does that do to your, your DCF? And it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>illuminating because it&rsquo;s shocking what compound interest does.</p>
<p>Alfred, we&rsquo;re almost out of time. I did want to ask you so one of your investments is is an open</p>
<p>AI, which is supposed to be a huge company. You&rsquo;re interested in generative AI more broadly.</p>
<p>It sounds you know, from the headlines right now, like this is going to be so</p>
<p>disruptive to everything. I wonder how that&rsquo;s impacting how you think about your other</p>
<p>investments? Well, I think that there are a few things, one of which is, we talked about this a</p>
<p>lot recently. And, you know, it was you go back to 1999. And you ask people, what is the internet,</p>
<p>they would have said, Well, it&rsquo;s this, this disruptive thing, and it&rsquo;s probably going to</p>
<p>be bigger than anybody imagined. But there was a lot of hype in a period of time from nine,</p>
<p>from 1998 99, the valuations were a little nutty, and companies that just added.com to their company</p>
<p>name in the public markets went up by 300%. That&rsquo;s not sustainable. And so we&rsquo;re going through a</p>
<p>period where there&rsquo;s going to be some great companies that are built right now. And then</p>
<p>there are some companies that will not really sustain. And it&rsquo;s one of those situations where</p>
<p>you have to understand that a bunch of things are going to change. And within three months,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting will, will change. So what if we had the AI discussion to and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>hear from Sam, what he&rsquo;s, what was interesting to him three months ago is not interesting anymore,</p>
<p>because the technology has advanced so much. And so you have to keep up with the accelerating</p>
<p>change. But at the same time, what is not what is not going to change. And those things that are</p>
<p>not going to change is the stuff that you can build a great business around. So great software,</p>
<p>can you build a great software with chat GPT? Yes. So a lot of our companies are just playing</p>
<p>with tools and playing with models so that they can increase their productivity for themselves,</p>
<p>they may not be in the AI space, but they&rsquo;re going to, they know that they need to keep up</p>
<p>with the increase in productivity, similar to what the internet, we know that when the internet</p>
<p>happened, you needed to become a web company. We knew that when, when mobile came around,</p>
<p>you needed to start getting on mobile, we knew that when cloud came along, every single company</p>
<p>will need to have a strategy around AI and ML, even if you&rsquo;re not an AI ML company. And then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be situations where three months from now, whatever you thought was interesting was</p>
<p>not. And I think you should ask Sam when he thinks any of these technologies can actually</p>
<p>win the international math Olympia competition, because that requires a different</p>
<p>thought process than reiterating what has been said in the past and the corpus of what is</p>
<p>searchable on the web. And I think his answer will surprise you. It&rsquo;s much faster than you think.</p>
<p>Much faster than you think. I think he will say it&rsquo;s much faster than what do you think? How far</p>
<p>are we from AGI? I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s a question you can ask him. That is dissatisfying. Alfred,</p>
<p>thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. That&rsquo;s it. Thanks for listening, everybody.</p>
<p>And special thanks to sustain.life. Make sure to check out their site at sustain.life</p>

<p>Bye.</p>
