    <p>The following is a conversation with Brian Keating,</p>
<p>experimental physicist at USCSD</p>
<p>and author of Losing the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>and Into the Impossible.</p>
<p>Plus, he&rsquo;s a host of the amazing podcast of the same name</p>
<p>called Into the Impossible.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Brian Keating.</p>
<p>As an experimental physicist,</p>
<p>what do you think is the most amazing</p>
<p>or maybe the coolest measurement device</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever worked with or humans have ever built?</p>
<p>Maybe for now, let&rsquo;s exclude the background imaging</p>
<p>of cosmic extragalactic polarization instruments.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m slightly biased</p>
<p>towards that particular instrument.</p>
<p>Talk about that in a little bit.</p>
<p>But certainly the telescope, to me,</p>
<p>is a lever that has literally moved the Earth</p>
<p>throughout history.</p>
<p>So the OG telescope?</p>
<p>The OG telescope, yeah.</p>
<p>The one invented not by Galileo, as most people think,</p>
<p>but by this guy Hans Lippershey in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>And it was kind of interesting</p>
<p>because in the 1600s, 14, 1500, 1600s,</p>
<p>there was the beginning of movable type.</p>
<p>And so people, for the first time in history,</p>
<p>had a standard by which they could appraise their eyesight.</p>
<p>So looking at a printed word now,</p>
<p>we just take it for granted, 12 point font, whatever,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the eye charts are based on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just fixed height.</p>
<p>But back then, there was no way to adjust your eyesight</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t have perfect vision.</p>
<p>And there was no way to even tell if you had perfect vision</p>
<p>or not until the Gutenberg Bible and movable type.</p>
<p>And at that time, people realized,</p>
<p>hey, wait, I can&rsquo;t read this.</p>
<p>My priest or my friend over here, he can read it,</p>
<p>she can read it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t read it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when these people in Venice and in the Netherlands</p>
<p>saw that they could take this kind of glass material</p>
<p>and hold it up and maybe put another piece</p>
<p>of glass material and it would make it clearer.</p>
<p>And what was so interesting is that nobody thought</p>
<p>to take that exact same device, two lenses,</p>
<p>and go like, hmm, let me go like this</p>
<p>and look at that bright thing in the sky over there,</p>
<p>until Galileo.</p>
<p>So Galileo didn&rsquo;t invent it,</p>
<p>but he did something kind of amazing.</p>
<p>He improved on it by a factor of 10.</p>
<p>So he 10X&rsquo;d it, which is almost as good</p>
<p>as going from zero to one, as going from one to 10.</p>
<p>And when he did that, he really transformed</p>
<p>both how we look at the universe and think about it,</p>
<p>but also who we are as a species,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re using tools not to get food faster</p>
<p>or to preserve our legacy for future generations,</p>
<p>but actually to increase the benefit to the human mind.</p>
<p>Somebody mentioned this idea that if humans</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t able to see the stars,</p>
<p>maybe there was some kind of makeup of the atmosphere,</p>
<p>which for the early humans made it impossible</p>
<p>to see the stars, that we would never develop</p>
<p>human civilization, or at least raising the question</p>
<p>of how important is it to look up to the sky</p>
<p>and wonder what&rsquo;s out there, as opposed to,</p>
<p>maybe this is an over romanticized notion,</p>
<p>but like looking at the ground,</p>
<p>it feels like a little bit too much focused on survival,</p>
<p>not being eaten by a bear slash lion.</p>
<p>If you look up to the stars, you start to wonder</p>
<p>what is my place in the universe?</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s modern humans romanticizing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little romantic, because they also took the same.</p>
<p>They took the same two lenses and they looked inward.</p>
<p>They looked at bacteria, they looked at hairs,</p>
<p>and in other words, they made the microscope,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still doing that.</p>
<p>And so to have a telescope, it serves a dual purpose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only a way of looking out, it&rsquo;s looking in,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also looking back in time.</p>
<p>In other words, you didn&rsquo;t see a microscope,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think, oh, I&rsquo;m seeing this thing</p>
<p>as it was one nanosecond ago,</p>
<p>light travels one foot per nanosecond.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing it, no, you don&rsquo;t think about it like that.</p>
<p>But when you see something that&rsquo;s happening on Jupiter,</p>
<p>the moon, Andromeda galaxy, you&rsquo;re seeing things</p>
<p>back when Lucy was walking around the Serengeti Plains.</p>
<p>And for that, I think that took then the knowledge</p>
<p>of relativity and time travel and so forth.</p>
<p>It took that before we could really say,</p>
<p>oh, we really unlocked some cheat codes in the human brain.</p>
<p>So I think that might be a little too much,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, I mean,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s better than having a time machine?</p>
<p>We can look back in time,</p>
<p>we see things as they were, not as they are.</p>
<p>And that allows us to do many things,</p>
<p>including speculate about that.</p>
<p>But one of the coolest things,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m a radio astronomer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually look through telescopes very often,</p>
<p>except on rare occasions when I take one out</p>
<p>to show the kids, but a radio telescope</p>
<p>is even more sort of visceral.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s much less cool because you look at it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, all right, it looks cool,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of weird shaped thing,</p>
<p>looks like it belongs in sci fi,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna blast the Death Star or whatever.</p>
<p>But when you realize that when you point a radio telescope</p>
<p>at a distant object,</p>
<p>if that object fills up what&rsquo;s called the beam,</p>
<p>which is basically the field of view of a radio telescope,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called its beam.</p>
<p>If you fill up the beam and you put a resistor,</p>
<p>just a simple absorbing piece of material</p>
<p>at the focus of the radio telescope,</p>
<p>that resistor will come to the exact same temperature</p>
<p>as the object that&rsquo;s looking at, which is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>It means you&rsquo;re actually remotely measuring,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking the temperature of Jupiter</p>
<p>or whatever in effect.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s allowing you to basically teleport</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no other science</p>
<p>that you can really do that, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an archeologist, you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>let me get into my time machine</p>
<p>and go back and see what was Lucy really like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>So the same thing happens,</p>
<p>this is where I&rsquo;ve learned about this</p>
<p>from March of the Penguins,</p>
<p>when the penguins huddled together,</p>
<p>the body temperature arrives to the same place.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing this remotely,</p>
<p>the March of the Penguins, but remote.</p>
<p>We do it from Antarctica too,</p>
<p>so there are some penguins around when we do it.</p>
<p>Okay, excellent.</p>
<p>You mentioned time machine,</p>
<p>I think in your book, Losing the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>you talk about time machines.</p>
<p>So let me ask you the question of,</p>
<p>take us back in time,</p>
<p>what happened at the beginning of our universe?</p>
<p>Ah, okay, usually people preface this</p>
<p>by saying I have a simple question.</p>
<p>So what happened before the universe began, what happened?</p>
<p>Brian Keating teaching me about comedy.</p>
<p>I have a simple question for you, let&rsquo;s take two.</p>
<p>I have a simple question,</p>
<p>what happened at the beginning of our universe?</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>All right, good.</p>
<p>So when we think about what happened,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more correct, it&rsquo;s more logical,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more practical to go back in time starting from today.</p>
<p>So if you go back 13.874 billion years from today,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some day, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you could translate into some day, right?</p>
<p>So on that day, something happened.</p>
<p>Earlier than the moment exactly now,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re talking around one o clock.</p>
<p>So at some point during that day,</p>
<p>the universe started to become a fusion reactor.</p>
<p>It started to fuse light elements and isotopes</p>
<p>into heavier elements and isotopes</p>
<p>of those heavier elements.</p>
<p>After that period of time,</p>
<p>going forward back closer to today,</p>
<p>less 10 minutes earlier, 10 minutes earlier,</p>
<p>or later rather coming towards us today,</p>
<p>we know more and more about what the universe was like.</p>
<p>And in fact, all the hydrogen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very good approximation in the water molecules</p>
<p>in this bottle, almost all of them were produced</p>
<p>during that first 20 minute period.</p>
<p>So I would say, the actual fusion and production</p>
<p>of the lightest elements on the periodic table</p>
<p>occurred in a time period shorter than the TV show,</p>
<p>The Big Bang Theory.</p>
<p>Well done, sir.</p>
<p>You know, most of those light elements besides hydrogen</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t really used in your encounter, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t encounter helium that often,</p>
<p>unless you go to a lot of birthday parties</p>
<p>or pilot a blimp.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need lithium, hopefully, you know,</p>
<p>but other than that,</p>
<p>those are the kinds of things</p>
<p>that were produced during that moment.</p>
<p>The question became, how did the heavier things</p>
<p>like iron, carbon, nickel, we can get to that later.</p>
<p>And I brought some samples for us to discuss</p>
<p>and how those came from a very different type of process</p>
<p>called a different type of fusion reactor</p>
<p>and a different type of process explosion as well</p>
<p>called a supernova.</p>
<p>However, if you go back beyond those first three minutes,</p>
<p>we really have to say almost nothing</p>
<p>because we are not capable.</p>
<p>In other words, going backwards</p>
<p>from the first three minutes,</p>
<p>as famous Steven Weinberg titled his book,</p>
<p>we actually marks a point where ignorance takes over.</p>
<p>In other words, we can&rsquo;t speculate on what happened</p>
<p>three minutes before the preponderance of hydrogen</p>
<p>was formed in our universe.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t know enough about that epoch.</p>
<p>There are many people, most people,</p>
<p>most practicing card carrying cosmologists</p>
<p>believe the universe began in what&rsquo;s called the singularity.</p>
<p>And we can certainly talk about that.</p>
<p>However, singularity is so far removed</p>
<p>from anything we can ever hope to prove,</p>
<p>hope to confront or hope to observe with evidence.</p>
<p>And really only occurs in two instantiations,</p>
<p>the big bang and the core of a black hole,</p>
<p>neither of which is observable.</p>
<p>And so for that reason,</p>
<p>there are now flourishing alternatives that say,</p>
<p>you can actually for the first time ask the question</p>
<p>that day, Tuesday in the first moments of our universe,</p>
<p>there was a Tuesday a week before that,</p>
<p>24 hours times seven days before that.</p>
<p>That has a perfectly well understood meaning</p>
<p>in models of cosmology promoted by some of the more eminent</p>
<p>of cosmologists working today.</p>
<p>When I was in grad school over 25 years ago,</p>
<p>no one really considered anything besides that big bang</p>
<p>that there was a singularity.</p>
<p>And people would have to say, as I said, we just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But they would say some future incarnation</p>
<p>of some experiment will tell us the answer.</p>
<p>But now there are people that are saying</p>
<p>there is an alternative to the big bang.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not really fringe science</p>
<p>as it once was 50, 80 years ago when these models&hellip;</p>
<p>By the way, the first cosmology in history</p>
<p>was not a singular universe.</p>
<p>The first cosmology in history goes back to Akhenaten Ra</p>
<p>and the temples of Egypt in the third millennium BC.</p>
<p>And in that, they talked about cyclical universes.</p>
<p>So I always joke, that guy Akhenaten&rsquo;s court,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d have a pretty high H index right about now</p>
<p>because people have been using that cyclical model</p>
<p>from Penrose to Paul Steinhardt and Aegis</p>
<p>and right up until this very moment.</p>
<p>Can you maybe explore the possible alternatives</p>
<p>to the big bang theory?</p>
<p>So there are many alternatives starting with&hellip;</p>
<p>So the singularity quantum cosmologically demanding</p>
<p>singular origin of the universe, that stands in contrast</p>
<p>to these other models in which time does not have</p>
<p>a beginning and many of them feature cycles,</p>
<p>at least one cycle, possibly infinite number of cycles,</p>
<p>called by Sir Roger Penrose.</p>
<p>And they all have things in common, these alternatives,</p>
<p>as does the dominant paradigm of cosmogenesis,</p>
<p>which is inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation can be thought of as this spark</p>
<p>that ignites the hot big bang that I said we understood.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an earlier condition,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still not an initial condition.</p>
<p>In physics, imagine I show you a grandfather clock</p>
<p>or a pendulum swinging back and forth.</p>
<p>You look away for a second, you come into the room,</p>
<p>pendulum swinging back and forth.</p>
<p>Alex, tell me, where did it start?</p>
<p>How many cycles is it gonna make before the era?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t answer that question</p>
<p>without knowing the initial conditions.</p>
<p>In a very simple system, like a one dimensional,</p>
<p>simple harmonic oscillator, like a pendulum,</p>
<p>think about understanding the whole universe</p>
<p>without understanding the initial conditions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tremendous lacuna, a gap that we have as scientists</p>
<p>that we may not be able to, in the inflationary cosmology,</p>
<p>determine the quantitative physical properties</p>
<p>of the universe prior to what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the inflationary epoch.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying for the pendulum in that epoch,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t, because you can infer things about the pendulum</p>
<p>before you show up to the room in our current epoch,</p>
<p>correct? Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you look at it right now,</p>
<p>but if I said, well, when will it stop oscillating?</p>
<p>So that depends on how much energy it got initially.</p>
<p>And you can measure its dissipation, its air resistance,</p>
<p>you had infrared camera,</p>
<p>you could see it&rsquo;s getting hotter maybe,</p>
<p>and you could do some calculations.</p>
<p>But to know the two things in physics</p>
<p>to solve a partial differential equation</p>
<p>are the initial conditions and the boundary conditions.</p>
<p>Boundary conditions, we&rsquo;re here on earth,</p>
<p>it has gravitational field, it&rsquo;s not gonna excurs,</p>
<p>or make excursions wildly beyond the length of the pendulum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it has simple properties.</p>
<p>So, but this is like, in other words,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tell me when did the solar system start orbiting</p>
<p>in the way that it does now.</p>
<p>In other words, when did the moon acquire</p>
<p>the exact angular momentum that it has now?</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a pretty pedestrian example.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m telling you is that the inflationary epoch</p>
<p>purports and is successful at providing</p>
<p>a lot of explanations for how the universe evolved</p>
<p>after inflation took place and ended,</p>
<p>but it says nothing about how it itself took place.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;re asking me.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t really, look,</p>
<p>what you care about like big bang nucleosynthesis</p>
<p>and the elements got made and these fusion reactors</p>
<p>and the whole universe was a fusion reactor,</p>
<p>but like, don&rsquo;t you really care about what happened</p>
<p>at the beginning of time, at the first moment of time?</p>
<p>And the problem is we can&rsquo;t really answer that</p>
<p>in the context of the big bang.</p>
<p>We can answer that in the context of these alternatives.</p>
<p>So you asked me about some of the alternatives.</p>
<p>So one is Aon theory,</p>
<p>the conformal cyclic cosmology of Sir Roger Penrose.</p>
<p>Another one that was really popular in the 60s and 70s</p>
<p>until the discovery of the primary component</p>
<p>of my research field,</p>
<p>the cosmic microwave background radiation or CMB,</p>
<p>the three Kelvin all pervasive signal</p>
<p>that astronomers detected in 1965.</p>
<p>That kind of spelled the death knell in some sense</p>
<p>to what was called the quasi steady state universe.</p>
<p>And then there was another model</p>
<p>that kind of came out of that.</p>
<p>You hear the word quasi, so it&rsquo;s not steady state.</p>
<p>Steady state means always existed.</p>
<p>That was a cosmology Einstein believed until Hubble</p>
<p>showed him evidence for the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>And most scientists believed in that for millennia basically.</p>
<p>The universe was eternal, static, unchanging.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t believe that after Hubble.</p>
<p>So they had to append onto it,</p>
<p>concatenate this new feature that it wasn&rsquo;t steady,</p>
<p>it was quasi steady.</p>
<p>So the universe was making a certain amount of hydrogen</p>
<p>every century in a given volume of space.</p>
<p>And that amount of hydrogen that was produced was constant.</p>
<p>But because it was producing more and more every century,</p>
<p>as centuries pile up and the volume piles up,</p>
<p>the universe could expand.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how they developed it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s slowly.</p>
<p>Very slowly.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t match observational evidence.</p>
<p>But that is an alternative.</p>
<p>By the way, did Einstein think</p>
<p>the steady state universe is infinite or finite?</p>
<p>Do you know?</p>
<p>I would assume that he thought it was infinite</p>
<p>because there was really,</p>
<p>if something had a no beginning in time,</p>
<p>then it would be very unlikely we&rsquo;re in the center of it</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s bounded or it has, in that case, a finite edge to it.</p>
<p>I wonder what he thought about infinity</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s such an uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a silly joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re familiar with this silly joke, right?</p>
<p>The silly joke was that there are only two things</p>
<p>that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure about the universe.</p>
<p>Well, me saying I&rsquo;m not aware of the joke</p>
<p>is a good example of the joke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very meta.</p>
<p>Okay, so, all right, sorry.</p>
<p>You were saying about quasi.</p>
<p>All the alternatives.</p>
<p>All the alternatives in the quasi steady state.</p>
<p>And the most kind of promising,</p>
<p>although I hate to say that,</p>
<p>people say, well, that&rsquo;s your favorite alternative, right?</p>
<p>This is not investment advice.</p>
<p>Inflation is not transitory.</p>
<p>It is quasi permanent.</p>
<p>So, a very prominent.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about cosmic inflation,</p>
<p>so calm down, cryptocurrency folks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Although the first Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>and one of the first Nobel Prizes in economics</p>
<p>was awarded for inflation, not of the cosmological kind.</p>
<p>So, most people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that inflation has already won a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good topic to work on if you won a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter the field.</p>
<p>Exactly, it&rsquo;s time translation invariant.</p>
<p>So, when we look at the alternative</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the bouncing or cyclic cosmologies,</p>
<p>these have serious virtues, according to some.</p>
<p>One of the virtues to me, just as a human,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just speaking as a human,</p>
<p>one of the founders of the new version</p>
<p>of the cyclic cosmology called the bouncing cosmology</p>
<p>is Paul Steinhardt.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the Einstein Professor of Natural Sciences</p>
<p>at Princeton University.</p>
<p>You may have heard of it.</p>
<p>And he was one of the originators</p>
<p>of what was called new inflation.</p>
<p>In other words, he was one of the founding fathers</p>
<p>of inflation, who now not only has no belief</p>
<p>or support for inflation,</p>
<p>he actively claims that inflation is baroque, pernicious,</p>
<p>dangerous, malevolent, not to science,</p>
<p>not just to cosmology, but to society.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s a man who created a theory</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s captivated the world or universe of cosmologists,</p>
<p>such as it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a huge universe,</p>
<p>but there are more podcasters than cosmologists.</p>
<p>Some do both.</p>
<p>But this man created this theory with collaborators.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m like, Paul, you&rsquo;re denying paternity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like a deadbeat dad.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re saying like, inflation is bogus.</p>
<p>But he doesn&rsquo;t just attack.</p>
<p>See, this is what&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>about approaching things as an experimentalist.</p>
<p>You got a lot of theorists on, and that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a huge service.</p>
<p>An experimentalist has to say no.</p>
<p>He or she has to be confident to say like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if I prove you right</p>
<p>or I prove your enemy wrong or whatever.</p>
<p>We have to be like exterminators.</p>
<p>And nobody likes the exterminator</p>
<p>until they need one, right?</p>
<p>Or the garbage collectors, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s vital that we be completely kind of unpersuaded</p>
<p>by the beauty and the magnificence and the symmetry</p>
<p>and the simplicity of some idea.</p>
<p>Like inflation is a beautiful idea,</p>
<p>but it also has consequences.</p>
<p>And what Paul claims,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with him fully on this point,</p>
<p>is that those consequences are dangerous</p>
<p>because they lead to things like the multiverse,</p>
<p>which is outside the purview of science.</p>
<p>And in that sense, I can see support for what he does,</p>
<p>but none of that detracts from my respect for a man.</p>
<p>You know, imagine like, you know,</p>
<p>Elon comes up with this like really great idea,</p>
<p>you know, space, and then he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, actually it&rsquo;s not gonna work.</p>
<p>But like, here&rsquo;s this better idea.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, SpaceX is not gonna work,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s now creating an alternative to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely hard to do what Paul has done.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m gonna like have more</p>
<p>and more attention paid to it because he&rsquo;s my friend</p>
<p>or because I respect the idea</p>
<p>or I respect the man and his colleague,</p>
<p>Anna Aegis, who works really hard with him.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, this has certain attractions to it.</p>
<p>And what it does most foremost is that it removes</p>
<p>the quantum gravity aspect from cosmology.</p>
<p>So it takes away 50% of the motivation</p>
<p>for a theory of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked a lot about quantum gravity.</p>
<p>You talk to people, eminent people on the show.</p>
<p>Always latent in those conversations</p>
<p>is sort of the teleological expectation</p>
<p>that there is a theory of everything.</p>
<p>There is a theory of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no law that says</p>
<p>we have to have a theory of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>So that kind of implicit expectation</p>
<p>has to do ultimately with the inflationary theory.</p>
<p>So in cosmic inflation, so is that at the core?</p>
<p>So okay, maybe you can speak to what is the negative impacts</p>
<p>on society from believing in cosmic inflation.</p>
<p>So one of the more kind of robust predictions of inflation,</p>
<p>according to its other two patriarchs,</p>
<p>considered to be its patriarchs, Alan Guth at MIT</p>
<p>and Andrei Linde at Stanford,</p>
<p>although he was in the USSR when he came up with these ideas,</p>
<p>along with Paul Steinhardt, was that the universe</p>
<p>has to eventually get into a quantum state,</p>
<p>has to exist in this Hilbert space,</p>
<p>and the Hilbert space has certain features,</p>
<p>and those features are quantum mechanical,</p>
<p>endowed with quantum mechanical properties.</p>
<p>And then it becomes very difficult to turn inflation off.</p>
<p>So inflation can get started,</p>
<p>but then it&rsquo;s like one of, you know, SpaceX rockets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to turn off a solid rocket booster, right?</p>
<p>It continues the thrusting.</p>
<p>You need another mechanism to douse the flames</p>
<p>of the inflationary expansion,</p>
<p>which means that if inflation kicks off somewhere,</p>
<p>it will kick off potentially everywhere at all times,</p>
<p>including now, spawning an ever increasing set of universes.</p>
<p>Some will die stillborn, some will continue and flourish,</p>
<p>and this is known as the multiverse paradigm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a robust, seemingly robust consequence,</p>
<p>not only of inflationary cosmology,</p>
<p>but more and more, we&rsquo;re seeing it</p>
<p>in string theory as well.</p>
<p>So that, you know, sometimes two, you know,</p>
<p>branches coming to the same conclusion</p>
<p>is, you know, taken as evidence for its reality.</p>
<p>So one of the negative consequences</p>
<p>is it creates phenomena that we can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that are outside the reach of experimental science,</p>
<p>or is it that the multiverse somehow</p>
<p>has a philosophical negative effect on humanity?</p>
<p>Like it makes us,</p>
<p>maybe it makes life seem more meaningless?</p>
<p>Is that where he&rsquo;s getting at a little bit,</p>
<p>or is it not reaching that far?</p>
<p>Well, no, I think those are both kind of perceptive.</p>
<p>The answer is a little of both,</p>
<p>because in one sense, it&rsquo;s meant kind of to explain</p>
<p>this fine tuning problem,</p>
<p>that we find ourselves in a universe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s particularly facund, that has features,</p>
<p>you know, consistent with our existence,</p>
<p>and how could we be otherwise?</p>
<p>You know, this sort of weak anthropic principle.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a theory that predicts everything,</p>
<p>literally everything, can be said to predict nothing.</p>
<p>Like if I say, Lex, you know, you&rsquo;ve been working out,</p>
<p>you look like, you know, yeah, you haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You look like you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>about somewhere under 10,000 kilograms.</p>
<p>Like, all right, yeah, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s horribly imprecise.</p>
<p>So what good is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s meaningless.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t contribute any what&rsquo;s called surprise,</p>
<p>or reduction in entropy,</p>
<p>or reduction of your ignorance about the system,</p>
<p>or you know exactly how much you weigh.</p>
<p>So me telling you that tells you nothing.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s basically saying</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re living in a universe</p>
<p>because the overwhelming odds of our existence</p>
<p>dictate that we would exist.</p>
<p>There has to be at least one place that we exist.</p>
<p>But the problem is it&rsquo;s a manifestation of infinity.</p>
<p>So humans, and I&rsquo;m sure you know this</p>
<p>from your work with AI and ML and everything else,</p>
<p>that humans, as far as we know,</p>
<p>really are the only entities capable</p>
<p>of contemplating infinity,</p>
<p>but we do so very imperfectly, right?</p>
<p>So if I say to you, like, what&rsquo;s bigger,</p>
<p>the number of, you know, water molecules in this thing,</p>
<p>or the number of real numbers?</p>
<p>Or if I say, what&rsquo;s bigger,</p>
<p>the number of real numbers or rational numbers?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all different classifications</p>
<p>of the amount of infinities that there could be.</p>
<p>Infinity to the infinity power.</p>
<p>You know, when you have kids someday,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tell you, I love you, infinity.</p>
<p>You have to come back, I love you, infinity plus one, right?</p>
<p>So, but the human brain can&rsquo;t really contemplate infinity.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate that.</p>
<p>They say in the singularity,</p>
<p>the universe had an infinite temperature, right?</p>
<p>So let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Is there anything that you can contemplate</p>
<p>in the, you know, Einstein&rsquo;s little quip aside,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s infinite, like a physical property,</p>
<p>density, pressure, temperature, energy, that&rsquo;s infinite.</p>
<p>And if you can think of such thing, I&rsquo;d like to know it.</p>
<p>But if you can, how does it go to infinity minus one?</p>
<p>You know, the opposite direction I go with my kids.</p>
<p>How does it go from like to half of infinity?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s still infinity.</p>
<p>How did it cool down?</p>
<p>How did it get more and more tenuous and rarefied?</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s only infinity over two,</p>
<p>in terms of pascals.</p>
<p>Less infinite to more infinite.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the biggest troubling things to me</p>
<p>about infinity is you can&rsquo;t truly hold it inside our minds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mathematical construct that doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it feels like intuition fails.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, we use it nonchalantly</p>
<p>and then use, like physicists,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re incredible intuition machines.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll play with this infinity</p>
<p>as if they can play with it on the level of intuition</p>
<p>as opposed to on the level of math.</p>
<p>You know, yeah, maybe it&rsquo;s something cyclical</p>
<p>you can imagine in infinity,</p>
<p>just going around the same,</p>
<p>kind of like a Mobius strip situation.</p>
<p>But then the question then arises,</p>
<p>how do you make it more or less infinite?</p>
<p>Yeah, all of that intuition fails completely.</p>
<p>And I mean, how do you represent it in a computer, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either some placeholder for infinity</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s one divided by a very,</p>
<p>the smallest possible real number</p>
<p>that you can represent in the memory.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s basically my undergraduate study</p>
<p>in computer science is how to represent</p>
<p>a floating point in a computer.</p>
<p>I think I took 17 courses on this topic.</p>
<p>It was very useful.</p>
<p>I came to the right place.</p>
<p>But in terms of what a physicist will mean,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re right, I mean, physicists will blithely,</p>
<p>nonchalantly subtract infinity, renormalization,</p>
<p>and do things to get finite answers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s miraculous.</p>
<p>But at a certain point, you have to ask,</p>
<p>well, what are the consequences for the real world?</p>
<p>So one of them, you ask, what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>Does it make us more meaningless?</p>
<p>They purport, many of the people that support it,</p>
<p>like Andrei Linde.</p>
<p>In fact, Andrei Linde says, you have a bias.</p>
<p>You, Lex, me, Brian.</p>
<p>You have a bias that you believe in a universe.</p>
<p>But shouldn&rsquo;t you believe in a multiverse?</p>
<p>What evidence do you have that there&rsquo;s not a multiverse?</p>
<p>So he turns it around.</p>
<p>Whereas Paul Steinhardt will say, no, if anything can happen,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s no predictive power within the theory.</p>
<p>Because you can always say, well,</p>
<p>this value of the inflationary field</p>
<p>did not produce sufficient gravitational wave energy</p>
<p>for us to detect it with BICEP or Simon&rsquo;s Observatory</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that inflation didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s logically 100% correct.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like kind of chewing Wonder Bread.</p>
<p>Apologize if they&rsquo;re one of your sponsors, but you know.</p>
<p>Wonderbread slash lex.com.</p>
<p>Type in code Klebb, right?</p>
<p>Klebb.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite Russian word is like,</p>
<p>would you like a piece of Klebb?</p>
<p>By the way, even that word, Klebb,</p>
<p>which means bread in Russian, as you say it,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re jokingly saying it now,</p>
<p>it made me hungry because it made</p>
<p>me remember how much I loved bread</p>
<p>when I was in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>When you were hungry, that was the things you dreamed about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s amazing is how many of the Soviet scientists</p>
<p>contributed to so much of what we understand today.</p>
<p>And they were completely in hiding.</p>
<p>There was no Google.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t look up on Scholar.</p>
<p>They had nothing.</p>
<p>They had to wait for journals to get</p>
<p>approved by the Communist Party to get approved.</p>
<p>And only then, if they weren&rsquo;t a member of some class,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you know, like Jewish scientists,</p>
<p>you had a passport that said Jew on your passport.</p>
<p>And Zeldovich, the famous Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich,</p>
<p>he was the advisor, one of my advisors, Alexander Polnareff.</p>
<p>And he had to, only because he was like at a Nobel level</p>
<p>and was one of the fathers of the Soviet atomic bomb program,</p>
<p>could he even get his Jewish student, he was Jewish too,</p>
<p>but only by virtue of his standing</p>
<p>of his intellectual accomplishments,</p>
<p>would they give him the dispensation</p>
<p>to let his student travel to Georgia or something.</p>
<p>And it makes what we complain about,</p>
<p>and I complain about academia.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, oh, well, what can I talk about?</p>
<p>We have no idea of how good it is</p>
<p>and that they were able to create things like inflation,</p>
<p>completely isolated from the West.</p>
<p>I mean, some of these people didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>meet people like Stephen Hawking until he was almost dead.</p>
<p>And they just learned this thing through smuggled in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a work of heroism, especially in cosmology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many cosmologists that worked incredibly hard,</p>
<p>probably because they were working the,</p>
<p>they could pass off as, well, we&rsquo;re doing stuff</p>
<p>for the atomic bomb program as well, which they were.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is interesting incentives</p>
<p>in the Soviet system that,</p>
<p>maybe we can take this tangent for a brief moment,</p>
<p>that because there&rsquo;s a dictatorship, authoritarian regime</p>
<p>throughout the history of the 20th century</p>
<p>for the Soviet Union, science was prioritized.</p>
<p>And because the state prioritized it</p>
<p>through the propaganda machines and the news and so on,</p>
<p>it actually was really cool to be a scientist.</p>
<p>Like you were highly valued in society.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a better way to say it.</p>
<p>And I would say, you&rsquo;re saying like, we have it easy now.</p>
<p>In that sense, it was kind of beneficial</p>
<p>to be a scientist in that society</p>
<p>because you were seen as a hero, as there&rsquo;s famous.</p>
<p>Yes, the most famous hero of the Soviet Republic.</p>
<p>And that, you know, there&rsquo;s positives to that.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying I would take the negatives</p>
<p>or the positives, but it is interesting to see a world</p>
<p>in which science was highly prized.</p>
<p>In the capitalist system, or maybe not capitalist,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say the American system,</p>
<p>the celebrities are the athletes, the actors and actresses,</p>
<p>maybe business leaders, musicians.</p>
<p>And, you know, the people we elect are sort of lawyers</p>
<p>and lawyers, so it&rsquo;s interesting to think of a world</p>
<p>where science was highly prized,</p>
<p>but they had to do that science within the constraints</p>
<p>of always having big brother watching.</p>
<p>Yeah, the same in Germany.</p>
<p>Germany had, you know, highly prized science.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the most famous tragic to me cases</p>
<p>is Fritz Haber who invented the Haber Bosch process</p>
<p>that allowed us to, I don&rsquo;t know, have you eaten yet?</p>
<p>You look, I mean, I know you fast, intermittent fast</p>
<p>every day and you do that.</p>
<p>You know, I said chleb and you got, it&rsquo;s a little drool,</p>
<p>but he says I&rsquo;m lifting and I look slim.</p>
<p>This is amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna clip this out and put it on Tinder.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a website.</p>
<p>You gotta swipe left or right for that, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But when you think about like, you know, what he did</p>
<p>and created the fertilizer process that we all enjoy</p>
<p>and we eat from every day, he was a German nationalist,</p>
<p>first and foremost, even though he was a Jew.</p>
<p>And he personally went to witness the application</p>
<p>of ammonia, chlorine gas applied during trench warfare</p>
<p>in 1916 in battles in Brussels and whatever.</p>
<p>And he was, they had a whole conjure of Nobel laureates</p>
<p>in chemistry and physics, you know,</p>
<p>that would go and witness these atrocities.</p>
<p>But that was also, they were almost putting science</p>
<p>above, I don&rsquo;t wanna say human dignity,</p>
<p>but of like the fact that he would later be suppressed.</p>
<p>And actually some of his relatives would die in Auschwitz</p>
<p>because of the chemical that he invented also</p>
<p>called Zyklon B.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just unbelievable.</p>
<p>So I feel like that does have resonance today</p>
<p>in this worship of science, you know,</p>
<p>and listen to science and follow the science,</p>
<p>which is more like scientism.</p>
<p>And there is still a danger.</p>
<p>You know, I always say, just cause you&rsquo;re an atheist</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t have a religion.</p>
<p>You know, just because you, you know,</p>
<p>in my case, in my books, I talk a lot about the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a kosher idol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that you can worship, you know,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t do any harm.</p>
<p>And we want those people that are so significant</p>
<p>in their intellectual accomplishments.</p>
<p>Cause there is a core of America</p>
<p>and the Western world in general</p>
<p>that does worship and really look at science predominantly</p>
<p>cause it gives us technology,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something really cool about that.</p>
<p>And so for me, it&rsquo;s hard to find that balance point</p>
<p>between looking to science for wisdom,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think it has, they&rsquo;re two different words,</p>
<p>but also recognizing how much good and transformative power</p>
<p>maybe our only hope comes from science.</p>
<p>You opened so many doors</p>
<p>cause you also bring up our Ernest Becker in that book.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of elements of religiosity to science</p>
<p>and to the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to explore and we will.</p>
<p>And we still haven&rsquo;t finished the discussion</p>
<p>of the beginning of the universe, which we&rsquo;ll return to.</p>
<p>But now since you opened the book, wow,</p>
<p>pun unintended of losing the Nobel prize,</p>
<p>can you tell me the story of BICEP,</p>
<p>the background imaging</p>
<p>of cosmic extragalactic polarization experiment,</p>
<p>BICEP one and BICEP two,</p>
<p>and then maybe you can talk about BICEP three,</p>
<p>but the thing that you cover in your book,</p>
<p>the human story of it, what happened?</p>
<p>Yeah, that book is in contradistinction of the second book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a memoir.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a description of what it&rsquo;s like to feel,</p>
<p>what it feels like to be a scientist</p>
<p>and to come up with the ignorance, uncertainty,</p>
<p>imposter syndrome, which I cover in the later book</p>
<p>in more detail, but to really feel like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing something and it&rsquo;s all you think about.</p>
<p>It is all consuming.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something I couldn&rsquo;t have done now</p>
<p>cause I have too many other,</p>
<p>wonderful, delightful demands of my time.</p>
<p>But to go back to that moment</p>
<p>when I was first captivated by the night sky</p>
<p>who has a 12 year old, 13 year old,</p>
<p>and really mixed together throughout my scientific story</p>
<p>has always been wanting to approach</p>
<p>the greatest mystery of all,</p>
<p>which I think is the existence or non existence of God.</p>
<p>So I call myself a practicing agnostic.</p>
<p>In other words, I do things that religious people do</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t do things that atheist people do.</p>
<p>And I once had this conversation,</p>
<p>with my first podcast guest actually,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t say, oh, I was just having a conversation</p>
<p>with Freeman Dyson, but he was actually my first guest.</p>
<p>And I miss him.</p>
<p>Name drop.</p>
<p>Name drop, yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s gonna be plenty of comments about that.</p>
<p>In case people don&rsquo;t know, Brian Keating is the host</p>
<p>of Into the Impossible podcast,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s talked to some of the greatest scientists</p>
<p>in history of science, physicists,</p>
<p>especially in the history of science.</p>
<p>So when I talked to Freeman, I said,</p>
<p>Freeman, you call yourself an agnostic too.</p>
<p>Can you tell me something like what do you do on Saturday,</p>
<p>on Sundays, do you go to church?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, I don&rsquo;t go to church.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, imagine there was</p>
<p>like an intelligent alien and he was looking down</p>
<p>or she, I don&rsquo;t know, thing was looking down</p>
<p>and it saw Freeman and on Sundays,</p>
<p>like a group of people go to church,</p>
<p>but Freeman doesn&rsquo;t go to church.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another group of people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t go to church and those are called atheists,</p>
<p>but Freeman calls himself an agnostic,</p>
<p>but he does the things that the Richard Dawkins,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t go to the same church</p>
<p>that Richard Dawkins doesn&rsquo;t go to, right?</p>
<p>So I said, how would you distinguish yourself</p>
<p>if not practice?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a behaviorist.</p>
<p>I believe you can change your mentality.</p>
<p>You can influence your mind,</p>
<p>view your bodily physical actions.</p>
<p>So when I was a 12 year old, I got my first telescope.</p>
<p>I was actually an altar boy in a Catholic church,</p>
<p>which is kind of strange for a Jewish kid</p>
<p>who grew up in New York.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll get into that, maybe not.</p>
<p>But I was just fascinated by these, these.</p>
<p>Can we get into it for a second?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, all right, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to a baby Brian or young.</p>
<p>Young Brian.</p>
<p>The new sitcom on CBS.</p>
<p>Young Brian, born to two Jewish parents.</p>
<p>My father was a professor at SUNY Stony Brook.</p>
<p>He was a mathematician, eminent mathematician.</p>
<p>And my mother was an eminent mom</p>
<p>and a brilliant English major, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they raised it, but they were secular.</p>
<p>They, you know, we&rsquo;d go to, I always joke,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d go to synagogue, you know, two times a year,</p>
<p>on Christmas and Easter.</p>
<p>No, no, we would go, yeah, Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah,</p>
<p>right, that&rsquo;s the typical two day a year Jews.</p>
<p>And you know, we&rsquo;d have, we&rsquo;d have matzahs</p>
<p>once a year on Palm Passover.</p>
<p>And that was about it.</p>
<p>And for years, I was like that</p>
<p>until my parents got divorced.</p>
<p>My mother remarried and she married an Irish Catholic man</p>
<p>by the name of Ray Keating.</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s name is James X.</p>
<p>So when she remarried Ray Keating,</p>
<p>I was immediately adopted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually adopted into the Keating family.</p>
<p>And he had nine brothers and sisters</p>
<p>and just warm and gregarious.</p>
<p>They, you know, did Christmas and Easter.</p>
<p>It was one of the most wonderful experiences I had.</p>
<p>And I do things with great gusto.</p>
<p>Whatever I do, I want to take it all the way.</p>
<p>So to me, that meant really learning about Christianity,</p>
<p>in this case, Catholicism.</p>
<p>So I was baptized, confirmed,</p>
<p>and I said, I want to go all the way.</p>
<p>I became an altar boy in the Catholic church.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to be the best altar boy there ever was.</p>
<p>I had like serious skills.</p>
<p>You passed that collection basket.</p>
<p>I could push people and get them to 2x their contributions.</p>
<p>But in this case, I was 13.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember when you were 13.</p>
<p>But if you extrapolate the next level up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you go graduate student, postdoc, professor.</p>
<p>The next level up from confirmation, altar boy,</p>
<p>is priest.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re aware of this,</p>
<p>but priests are not entitled to have relations with women.</p>
<p>And as a 13 year old boy, kind of like future casting</p>
<p>what life&rsquo;s going to be like for myself</p>
<p>if I continue on my path, I found that maybe I&hellip;</p>
<p>The math is not up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There was a serious gap in that future.</p>
<p>And instead, when I should have been preparing</p>
<p>for my Bar Mitzvah, as most Jewish boys would be,</p>
<p>a 12, 13 year old boy, I actually got a telescope</p>
<p>and became infatuated with all the things</p>
<p>you could see with it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t bigger than that one over there</p>
<p>that your hedgehog&rsquo;s looking through.</p>
<p>Is that a hedgehog?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hedgehog in the fog.</p>
<p>I should mention, and we&rsquo;ll go one by one, these things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve given me some incredible gifts.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a good place to ask about the telescope</p>
<p>that puts some clamps on and let the hedgehogs look.</p>
<p>And using&hellip;</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re officially an experimental astrophysicist.</p>
<p>Why experimentalist versus an engineer?</p>
<p>Because you assembled this telescope,</p>
<p>you gave it a mount, and you connected it to a very powerful&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s no experiment going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just engineering for show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very shallow.</p>
<p>Experiment is taking it to the next level</p>
<p>and actually achieving something.</p>
<p>Here, I just built a thing for show.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s always a joke.</p>
<p>People say, oh, you&rsquo;re an experimental cosmologist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, I build a lot of universes.</p>
<p>Actually, most of my time is putting clamps on things,</p>
<p>soldering things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually doing the stroking</p>
<p>of my non existent beard, contemplating the cyclic</p>
<p>versus the bouncing cosmological monitor.</p>
<p>Just like most of robotics is just using Velcro for things.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, it&rsquo;s not like having dancing dogs</p>
<p>and whatever, right?</p>
<p>So telescope.</p>
<p>Yes, this telescope.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story of this little telescope?</p>
<p>This telescope&rsquo;s a very precious thing in some ways,</p>
<p>a symbol of what got me into&hellip;</p>
<p>What brought me all the blessings I have in my life</p>
<p>came from a telescope.</p>
<p>And I always advise parents or even people for themselves.</p>
<p>You right here, wherever we are,</p>
<p>a biggest city on earth, Manhattan,</p>
<p>where I was growing up as a 12 year old</p>
<p>outside of Manhattan.</p>
<p>You can see the exact same craters on the moon,</p>
<p>the same rings of Saturn, the same moons of Jupiter,</p>
<p>the same phases of the&hellip;</p>
<p>You can see the Andromeda galaxy,</p>
<p>Lex, two and a half million light years away from earth.</p>
<p>You can do that with that little thing over there.</p>
<p>One that&rsquo;s a little more expensive.</p>
<p>Get one that has a mount and you could attach now</p>
<p>your smartphone.</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have known what that was in 1994.</p>
<p>And with that, you can do something that no other science</p>
<p>to my knowledge can really replicate,</p>
<p>maybe biology in some sense,</p>
<p>but you can experience the physical sensation</p>
<p>that Galileo experienced when he turned a telescope</p>
<p>like that to Jupiter and saw these four dots around it.</p>
<p>Or that Saturn had ears as he called it.</p>
<p>Or that the moon was not crystalline polished smooth</p>
<p>and made of this heavenly substance,</p>
<p>the quintessence substance, right?</p>
<p>So where else can you be viscerally connected</p>
<p>with the first person to ever make that discovery?</p>
<p>Try doing that with the Higgs boson.</p>
<p>Get yourself an LHC and smash together high luminosity,</p>
<p>call up Harry Cliffe and say, I want to replicate.</p>
<p>How did you feel?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
<p>None of them felt anything.</p>
<p>It took years to go, you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But with this, you can feel the exact same emotions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like maybe there&rsquo;s another one like that</p>
<p>is fire.</p>
<p>Like when you build a bonfire, can you actually get it?</p>
<p>See, if you use a lighter, I think if you actually</p>
<p>by rubbing sticks together or however you do it</p>
<p>without any of the modern tools,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably what that&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>And then you get to experience the magic of it,</p>
<p>of what like early humans homo sapiens felt.</p>
<p>You feel what Aug felt when he did it that first time.</p>
<p>By the way, is this a gift?</p>
<p>This is a gift, of course.</p>
<p>You need a little bit of a swag upgrade,</p>
<p>so I got you some gifts.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a, I&rsquo;m pulling a Putin,</p>
<p>like ask if this is a gift,</p>
<p>making it very uncomfortable for you to say.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>This is actually my childhood telescope here, you know.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m keeping it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So looking through this telescope.</p>
<p>Was when your love for science was first born.</p>
<p>Changed my life.</p>
<p>Because not only was I doing that,</p>
<p>I was replicating what Galileo did,</p>
<p>but I was, and I&rsquo;m 100% not comparing myself</p>
<p>to Galileo, Galileo, okay,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s any confusion out there.</p>
<p>But I did replicate exactly what he did,</p>
<p>and I was like, holy crap, this is weird.</p>
<p>Let me write it down.</p>
<p>So it had another effect, which all good scientists,</p>
<p>budding scientists should do, and all parents should do,</p>
<p>get your kid a book, a little notebook,</p>
<p>tape a pencil to it.</p>
<p>Write down what you see, what you hypothesize,</p>
<p>what you think it&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>Not like in the high school, you know,</p>
<p>like hypothesis, thesis, but just like,</p>
<p>wow, how did I feel?</p>
<p>Better yet, astronomy is a visual science.</p>
<p>Sketch what you see.</p>
<p>The Lagoon Nebula, the Pleiades Seven Sisters.</p>
<p>You can see them anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>And when you do that, again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re connecting two different hemispheres of your brain,</p>
<p>as I understand it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re connecting them through your fingertips.</p>
<p>You literally have the knowledge in your fingertips.</p>
<p>In your connection between what you see,</p>
<p>what you observe, and what you write down.</p>
<p>Then you do research, right?</p>
<p>The goal of science is not to just replicate</p>
<p>what other people did, is do something new.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we call it research,</p>
<p>and not just like studying, you know, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>And in so doing, you start to train a kid</p>
<p>at age 12 or 13 for 50 bucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>And now we can do even better,</p>
<p>because you can share it on Instagram or whatever,</p>
<p>and you can, by doing so, have an entree</p>
<p>into the world of what does it really mean</p>
<p>to be a scientist, and do so viscerally.</p>
<p>You know, I often say, I was taught this</p>
<p>by my English teacher, Mrs. Tompkins, in ninth grade,</p>
<p>that the word educate, it doesn&rsquo;t mean to pour into.</p>
<p>Let me pour in some facts and intellects,</p>
<p>and you know, it&rsquo;s not like machine learning</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just showing like billions of cats,</p>
<p>or you know, you&rsquo;re not like forcing it in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bringing it out.</p>
<p>It means to pour out of, in Latin, educare.</p>
<p>And what more could a teacher want</p>
<p>than to have something, the kid is just like gushing.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not gonna see like.</p>
<p>To inspire the kid.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Inspire.</p>
<p>Shout out to Mrs. Tompkins.</p>
<p>Yeah, Mrs. Tompkins, she&rsquo;s watching, yeah.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a big fan.</p>
<p>Me, she doesn&rsquo;t care for it, but you.</p>
<p>Yeah, excellent.</p>
<p>We take those we love for granted.</p>
<p>This is in Manhattan.</p>
<p>This is in Westchester County, New York.</p>
<p>Okay, got it.</p>
<p>So okay, but then that&rsquo;s where the dream is born.</p>
<p>But then there is the pragmatic journey of a scientist.</p>
<p>So going to university, graduate school,</p>
<p>postdoc, all the way to where you are today.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that, what are some notable moments in that journey?</p>
<p>So I call that the academic hunger games.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re competing against</p>
<p>like these people who are just getting smarter all the time</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re getting smarter all the time.</p>
<p>They wanna get into a fewer and fewer number of slots.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s fewer slots to get into college</p>
<p>than in high school.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s fewer slots in graduate school.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s fewer, very fewer slots to be a postdoc.</p>
<p>And many, many, maybe infinitesimal number.</p>
<p>We just did a faculty search at UC San Diego,</p>
<p>400 applicants for one position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost getting impossible.</p>
<p>Like I almost can&rsquo;t conceive of doing</p>
<p>what these new brilliant young people applying</p>
<p>to become an assistant professor at a state university</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It takes so much courage to do that.</p>
<p>So I went from this kid in New York,</p>
<p>thinking I would never be a professional astronomer.</p>
<p>A, because I didn&rsquo;t know any, I&rsquo;d never seen any.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know that they existed.</p>
<p>And I thought, who the hell&rsquo;s gonna pay me</p>
<p>to look at the stars?</p>
<p>Like, won&rsquo;t they pay me to be like an ice cream taster?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just not something I could conceive</p>
<p>of getting paid to do.</p>
<p>Even if I had the brilliance to do it,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t feel I did.</p>
<p>And then I went to graduate school.</p>
<p>And during graduate school, I had this kind of</p>
<p>on again, off again relationship with my father.</p>
<p>And I knew that he was a mathematician.</p>
<p>He had left and gotten remarried himself</p>
<p>and moved across the country.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see him for 15 years.</p>
<p>And in that time, I learned a lot about him.</p>
<p>And I learned that he had gotten very interested</p>
<p>not in pure mathematics,</p>
<p>which he had been a number theorist</p>
<p>and contributed seminal work on the offending equations,</p>
<p>which play a role in Turing&rsquo;s work that you may have seen.</p>
<p>But anyway, he had become interested,</p>
<p>turned completely away from that into the foundations</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics and relativity, which is physics.</p>
<p>And by that time I was at Brown University</p>
<p>and I was thinking, oh, maybe I&rsquo;ll be condensed matter</p>
<p>physicist or experimentalist.</p>
<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d be a theorist and I&rsquo;m not a theorist.</p>
<p>So it was pretty prescient.</p>
<p>But it always appealed to me,</p>
<p>why not do what made me happy as a 12 year old?</p>
<p>We often forget about those primitive things about us</p>
<p>are probably the most sustainable, durable</p>
<p>and resilient attributes of our character.</p>
<p>So with my own kids,</p>
<p>what are they interested in now when they&rsquo;re young?</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>Some of them wanna play Fortnite,</p>
<p>like professional Fortnite play, which there are,</p>
<p>but the odds of that is less</p>
<p>than the odds of being a professor.</p>
<p>Can I ask you, is your father still with us?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Just in a small tangent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you miss him?</p>
<p>Do you think about him?</p>
<p>Does his mathematical journey reverberate</p>
<p>through who you are?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, it did in very many ways</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s been gone for a long time now.</p>
<p>Thinking back to that time with him,</p>
<p>he must&rsquo;ve instilled some capacity for me</p>
<p>to only wanna spend my time,</p>
<p>which is a limited quantity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the most limited quantity.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll talk about that later,</p>
<p>but to go into only the most challenging,</p>
<p>interesting things with the limited time that we have</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re alive.</p>
<p>And for him, it was the foundations of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>For me, it was the foundations of the universe</p>
<p>and how did it come to be?</p>
<p>And I felt like, well, people have been trying</p>
<p>since Einstein to outdo Einstein,</p>
<p>really have made great progress</p>
<p>in the foundations of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>but this is an exciting time.</p>
<p>The COBE satellite had just released its data</p>
<p>that the universe had this anisotropy pattern.</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking called it like looking at the face of God</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And so it seemed like this is a good golden age</p>
<p>for what I&rsquo;m gonna do and what I&rsquo;m most interested in.</p>
<p>But always throughout that, I wanted to understand,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wanna be a wrench monkey,</p>
<p>no offense to people that just do experiment.</p>
<p>And no offense to monkeys.</p>
<p>No offense to monkeys, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>This little guy, sorry, man.</p>
<p>But thinking back to what animates me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not doing the engineering</p>
<p>as much as it is getting the data,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of steps.</p>
<p>I wanna be the guy understanding</p>
<p>what made the universe produce the signal that we saw.</p>
<p>So I always joke with my theorist friends,</p>
<p>call me a closeted theorist.</p>
<p>Like I wanna be, you know what they call</p>
<p>a guy who hangs out with musicians, a drummer.</p>
<p>So I wanna be like that for physics,</p>
<p>for theoretical physics.</p>
<p>I wanna be like the guy doesn&rsquo;t do new theory,</p>
<p>but understands the theory that the new theorists are doing.</p>
<p>I love that formulation of a theorist</p>
<p>is understanding the source of the signal you&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>Like signal is primary.</p>
<p>Like the thing you measure is primary</p>
<p>and theory is just the search of explaining</p>
<p>how that signal originated, but it&rsquo;s all about the signal.</p>
<p>I mean, I see the same search for the human mind</p>
<p>and like neuroscience in that same kind of way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately about the signal,</p>
<p>but you kind of hope to understand</p>
<p>how that signal originated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a beautiful way to explain experimental physics</p>
<p>because it ultimately at the end of the day</p>
<p>is all about the signal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and maybe those two things,</p>
<p>the neuroscience and the cosmos,</p>
<p>not getting too romantic, but yeah,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re linked in some fundamental way,</p>
<p>some fundamental cosmic consciousness,</p>
<p>but.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, we definitely have to get back to that.</p>
<p>But getting back to, yeah, so my origins.</p>
<p>So I always say like, and I wanna try this on you.</p>
<p>You said you wouldn&rsquo;t answer any of my questions,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna ask you some questions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most important day on the calendar?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me the date, but to you,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the most important day to you every year?</p>
<p>Do I have to answer or do I have to think about it?</p>
<p>No, no, answer.</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t have to tell me the exact date</p>
<p>of the calendar.</p>
<p>It could be like your mistress&rsquo;s birthday or whatever, but.</p>
<p>I have so many I lose track, even though I&rsquo;m single.</p>
<p>How does that even make sense?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>So a day, like a month and a day, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, for me, it would be December 31st.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I was gonna say New Year&rsquo;s Eve, New Year&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>Some people say birthday, anniversary, kid&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually signifying beginnings and ends, right?</p>
<p>January means the portal between,</p>
<p>the God was the portal between the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking back, maybe because you&rsquo;re Russian,</p>
<p>like the death side, the light side,</p>
<p>looking forward into January, the beginning, right?</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s most important day is usually some beginning</p>
<p>or something significant.</p>
<p>For me, it was studying the most significant thing of all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when did the universe get born,</p>
<p>as I said before?</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t think there, again, I didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I just, there was some mental obstruction</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t realize that I could get past</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t think like anybody does it.</p>
<p>Like I knew astronomers knew these answers,</p>
<p>like the universe at that time, between 10 and 20 billion</p>
<p>years old.</p>
<p>Now we know it&rsquo;s 13.872 billion years old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible the five digit, you know,</p>
<p>per significant five.</p>
<p>What is it again? 13.872 billion years.</p>
<p>872 million.</p>
<p>So is there a lot of plus or minus on that?</p>
<p>Is it, what are the error bars on that?</p>
<p>So for me, I&rsquo;m 50.</p>
<p>So it would be the equivalent of you looking at me</p>
<p>and telling me within 12 hours how old I am.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a half a percent, percent level accuracy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a confidence behind that?</p>
<p>Oh yeah. I mean, there&rsquo;s a significance.</p>
<p>Yeah. No, it&rsquo;s extremely well measured.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one of the most precise things that we have.</p>
<p>In contrast to, again, 25 years ago,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know if the universe was 10 billion</p>
<p>or 20 billion years old,</p>
<p>but there were stars in our galaxy that were believed to be</p>
<p>as they are about 12 billion years old</p>
<p>or in the universe that were 12 billion.</p>
<p>So that would be like you being older than your father.</p>
<p>It was embarrassing.</p>
<p>Can we actually take a tangent on a tangent,</p>
<p>on a tangent, on a tangent?</p>
<p>How old is the universe?</p>
<p>Can you dig in onto this number?</p>
<p>How do we know currently with those,</p>
<p>I guess you said four or five significant digits?</p>
<p>So we can come about it from two different ways.</p>
<p>One, basically they rely on the most important number</p>
<p>in cosmology, which is called the Hubble constant.</p>
<p>The Hubble constant is this weird number</p>
<p>that has the following units.</p>
<p>It has the units of kilometers per second per megaparsec.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a speed per distance,</p>
<p>which means you multiply it by distance and you get a speed.</p>
<p>And what is the speed you&rsquo;re measuring?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re measuring the speed of a distant galaxy</p>
<p>at many megaparsecs away.</p>
<p>So a galaxy at one megaparsec away,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t actually strictly true</p>
<p>because of local gravitational effects.</p>
<p>But if you go out, say one megaparsec away,</p>
<p>I would say that that galaxy is moving 72 kilometers</p>
<p>per second away from you.</p>
<p>And every galaxy, except for the local,</p>
<p>very most local group surrounding us,</p>
<p>maybe a half a dozen galaxies,</p>
<p>out of 500 billion galaxies to perhaps a trillion galaxies.</p>
<p>So 12 out of that number are moving towards us,</p>
<p>the rest are moving away from us.</p>
<p>So that number, if you invert it,</p>
<p>if you say, well, when did those things last touch each other,</p>
<p>all those galaxies, now they&rsquo;re really far apart,</p>
<p>we know how fast they&rsquo;re moving away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple algebra problem to solve.</p>
<p>When were they touching?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you get that number from.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the local 12 and then the rest.</p>
<p>Ignore the 12, yeah.</p>
<p>And then ignore the 12 and then look at the others</p>
<p>and yeah, then solve the algebra problem.</p>
<p>How does the stuff in the beginning,</p>
<p>the mystery of that beginning epoch</p>
<p>change this calculation of?</p>
<p>Very little, because actually we understand</p>
<p>how there&rsquo;s some other ingredients that go into it,</p>
<p>namely how much dark energy there is in the universe,</p>
<p>how much dark matter there is in the universe,</p>
<p>how much radiation, light, neutrinos, et cetera there are,</p>
<p>and how much ordinary matter,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re made up of neutrons, protons, croutons.</p>
<p>Okay, so let me, morons.</p>
<p>It appears that the universe is bigger than it is older.</p>
<p>How does that make sense?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, yeah, so you&rsquo;re talking about the fact</p>
<p>that we can actually see stuff in our observable universe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s located at a distance that is farther</p>
<p>than the speed of light times the age of the universe.</p>
<p>Naively you would say that,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re right, if the universe were static,</p>
<p>if the universe came into existence,</p>
<p>and you can conceive of this,</p>
<p>the universe came into a big bang in a fixed universe,</p>
<p>so the universe just started off,</p>
<p>those galaxies were, they could be moving</p>
<p>towards us, away from us, who knows,</p>
<p>that you could say I can see a galaxy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s at a distance of only 13.8 billion years</p>
<p>times the speed of light, that would be true.</p>
<p>But the fact that the light is expanding</p>
<p>along with the expansion of the universe,</p>
<p>so imagine there was some very distant past,</p>
<p>we were near a galaxy, it&rsquo;s gonna produce some light,</p>
<p>and that galaxy&rsquo;s going to be moving away from us,</p>
<p>the light&rsquo;s gonna be getting more and more red shifted</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called, and it&rsquo;s gonna be moving</p>
<p>farther and farther away from us as time goes on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be some acceleration</p>
<p>as we get into the era of dark energy.</p>
<p>The light signals, there&rsquo;ll be some cone of acceptance,</p>
<p>if you will, from which, which represents all the events</p>
<p>that we could have received information from.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t currently communicate with that galaxy.</p>
<p>It sent us some light, and now it&rsquo;s moving away,</p>
<p>and it sent us some light, and because the space</p>
<p>is also dragging the photons with it, if you like,</p>
<p>the photons are participating</p>
<p>in the expansion of the universe,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re red shifting,</p>
<p>that we can see things out to where the universe</p>
<p>first began expanding, not just when it began existing.</p>
<p>And because the universe has been expanding</p>
<p>for 13.8 billion years, with no sign of slowing down yet,</p>
<p>which is a huge surprise, serendipitous surprise,</p>
<p>that we can see things approximately three times</p>
<p>the age of the universe away from us.</p>
<p>So we can see, it&rsquo;s called the age of the universe,</p>
<p>15 billion years, just to make the math simple.</p>
<p>We see things at 45 billion light years distance</p>
<p>in that direction, and we see things at 45 billion</p>
<p>light years in that direction,</p>
<p>just turning our telescopes 180 degrees away.</p>
<p>So that means we see things that themselves</p>
<p>are 90 billion light years away from each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the diameter of the observable universe.</p>
<p>Is there another universe beyond that?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So in conjecture, there&rsquo;s not only one,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an infinite number of them.</p>
<p>How are you emotionally okay with the fact</p>
<p>that our universe is expanding?</p>
<p>So like&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be like Annie Hall, like with Alvy Singer.</p>
<p>I grew up in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>We watched propaganda films.</p>
<p>I realized that you did, yes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a famous&hellip; Annie Hall, is that some kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>What is the&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a comedy, it&rsquo;s a propaganda movie with Woody Allen.</p>
<p>Certainly canceled, but nevertheless,</p>
<p>back when he was not canceled yet,</p>
<p>he made a movie called Annie Hall,</p>
<p>in which as a self depiction, he&rsquo;s like a Larry David</p>
<p>before Larry David was Larry David,</p>
<p>neurotic, typical neurotic young Jew.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in Brooklyn and he all of a sudden tells his mother</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not doing his homework anymore.</p>
<p>He refuses to do his homework.</p>
<p>Mother says, why?</p>
<p>Goes, because the universe is expanding</p>
<p>and it keeps on expanding.</p>
<p>Everything will rip apart</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll never have anything in contact</p>
<p>and everything is meaningless.</p>
<p>I assume these are some of the topics we&rsquo;re gonna get to.</p>
<p>And she goes, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Brooklyn is not expanding.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true, Brooklyn is not expanding.</p>
<p>The solar system is not expanding.</p>
<p>Often times they get asked,</p>
<p>what is the universe expanding into?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of my favorite questions.</p>
<p>What is it expanding into?</p>
<p>And I say, it&rsquo;s actually an easy question</p>
<p>if you think about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen your friend Elon, he goes out into space,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a rocket, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s outside of the rocket?</p>
<p>If you take this bottle, empty out this bottle,</p>
<p>take the cap off it, go outside the rocket,</p>
<p>sip in some Tang, screw on the cover of it,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in there?</p>
<p>Is it empty?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just semantics, I guess, yeah.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s definitely not empty.</p>
<p>So you step outside the rocket.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re in the vacuum of space,</p>
<p>the quote unquote vacuum of space.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no more liquid in it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more liquid in it.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just a container.</p>
<p>One cubic centimeter, let&rsquo;s make it simple.</p>
<p>One cubic centimeter of a box</p>
<p>and you take it out into space,</p>
<p>outside of a Falcon, whatever, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s inside that box?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not empty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually, I&rsquo;m gonna say,</p>
<p>this is gonna set your friends up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 420 photons from the fusion of the light elements</p>
<p>that we call the cosmic microwave background</p>
<p>inside that box at any second.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, hold on a second.</p>
<p>What, 420, I&rsquo;ve heard of that number before.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It used to be 69, but then they changed it.</p>
<p>Wow, physics works in mysterious ways.</p>
<p>In a millimeter box, it&rsquo;s 69.</p>
<p>What are we talking about here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s inside, what&rsquo;s in the box?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think outside the box.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re thinking inside the box.</p>
<p>So if you have, every cubic centimeter</p>
<p>of our observable universe is suffused with heat</p>
<p>left over from the Big Bang, dark matter particles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little ordinary matter in the universe.</p>
<p>And every cubic centimeter,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some probability to find a proton,</p>
<p>a cosmic ray, an electron, et cetera.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually an awful lot of neutrinos</p>
<p>inside of that cubic centimeter.</p>
<p>Now just imagine how many cubic centimeters</p>
<p>are in the universe, it&rsquo;s enormous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s enormous numbers of particles</p>
<p>in our universe, it&rsquo;s a very rich universe.</p>
<p>But now let&rsquo;s zoom in on that box.</p>
<p>So now inside that box, there might be one,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say there might be one ordinary matter,</p>
<p>like a proton or an electron, a baryon, a lepton.</p>
<p>There might be a couple hundred neutrinos</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be a couple hundred photons, as I said, 420.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s between those guys?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s between the protons and the neutrinos</p>
<p>and the photons?</p>
<p>Like just zoom into a cubic micron now.</p>
<p>Like imagine 420 things inside a box this big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually pretty empty.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re just zipping around in there, right?</p>
<p>So between them, there&rsquo;s a lot of empty space.</p>
<p>And this is outside the kind of physics based models</p>
<p>of fields and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>just like asking the question of like,</p>
<p>what is this emptiness?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the particle content in the universe</p>
<p>in every cubic centimeter of the universe?</p>
<p>Outside of the 420.</p>
<p>So you have the 420, they have some mass.</p>
<p>Well, they have energy, they don&rsquo;t have mass.</p>
<p>Photons don&rsquo;t have mass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t bring suitcases.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>Photons never bring suitcases with them</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re traveling light.</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t even get to laugh at you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s corny dad jokes.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;ll appreciate some.</p>
<p>No, this is pretty good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m laughing on the insides.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in the box?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the 420?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s between the photons?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what space is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the universe is expanding into.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the notebook</p>
<p>on which the photons are written.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>But still, thank you.</p>
<p>Still, I understand this, but it&rsquo;s still uncomfortable</p>
<p>that if the universe is expanding,</p>
<p>that this thing is expanding, the canvas is expanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very strange.</p>
<p>Because like if we were just sitting there still,</p>
<p>I guess if we&rsquo;re in Brooklyn, nothing&rsquo;s expanding.</p>
<p>So our cognition, our intuition about the world</p>
<p>is based on this local fact</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t get to experience this kind of expansion.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that intuition leads us astray.</p>
<p>But you know that gravity is the weakest</p>
<p>of the so called four fundamental forces.</p>
<p>And yet it has the longest range pervasiveness.</p>
<p>Gravity is, you know, we&rsquo;re being pulled</p>
<p>towards the Andromeda galaxy at some enormous rate of speed</p>
<p>because of its massive counter gravitational force</p>
<p>to the force we exert on it.</p>
<p>So gravity is enormously long range, but incredibly weak.</p>
<p>And because of that, we can think about these effects</p>
<p>of expansion as the relationship between the,</p>
<p>as you said, the grid lines on the notebook, right?</p>
<p>Gravity is a manifestation of the interrelationship</p>
<p>between those points, how far they are from each other.</p>
<p>And those can change, those point distances can change</p>
<p>over time because of the force of gravity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s weak and what we experience as gravity</p>
<p>is the changing of those trajectories</p>
<p>from being rectilinear to curvilinear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we experience as gravity.</p>
<p>You had this analogy when you talked to Barry Barish</p>
<p>about bowling ball and a trampoline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost right because it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>you have to visualize that now in four dimensions,</p>
<p>like wrapping a trampoline at every point</p>
<p>around the object, including on the sides,</p>
<p>and it becomes very hard to visualize.</p>
<p>So a lot of people use that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a fraught analogy because you&rsquo;re using gravity,</p>
<p>like the notion of gravity pulling something down</p>
<p>to explain the notion of gravity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little overburdening, the analogy.</p>
<p>But okay, so you mentioned Barry Barish</p>
<p>wrote the forward to your book.</p>
<p>How do gravitational waves fit into all of this?</p>
<p>How do they, on the emotional level,</p>
<p>how do they make you feel that they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>moving space time?</p>
<p>Yeah, so gravitational waves were,</p>
<p>the Nobel Prize for gravitational waves discovery</p>
<p>the first time, it was discovered twice,</p>
<p>indirectly by two men named Halcyon Taylor,</p>
<p>and that was given my first year of graduate school.</p>
<p>The day I entered graduate school almost,</p>
<p>they announced these two guys won it,</p>
<p>and the guy who won it did the work</p>
<p>that would later win him the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>when he was my age.</p>
<p>Is this in the 40s?</p>
<p>This was, no, this is 19.</p>
<p>That was a joke.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was good, that was good.</p>
<p>I got it, I got it.</p>
<p>You know, to a cosmologist, age means nothing.</p>
<p>And to a tennis player.</p>
<p>Not on Tinder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>All right, sorry.</p>
<p>Gravitational waves do fit in</p>
<p>because what we&rsquo;re trying to do now</p>
<p>is use the properties of gravitational waves,</p>
<p>the analogous properties that they have to photons,</p>
<p>that they travel at the speed of light,</p>
<p>that they go through everything,</p>
<p>they can go through everything,</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re directly detectable.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using them to try to confirm</p>
<p>if or if not inflation occurred.</p>
<p>So did inflation, the spark that ignited</p>
<p>the fusion of the elements in the early part of the universe</p>
<p>and the initial expansion of the universe,</p>
<p>did that take place?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one way that cosmologists believe</p>
<p>we could ever see that.</p>
<p>Through the imprint</p>
<p>of these primordial gravitational waves,</p>
<p>not these old newcomers that Barry studies,</p>
<p>the ones that occurred a billion light years away from us,</p>
<p>a billion years ago,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re seeing things that happened 13.82 billion years ago</p>
<p>during the inflationary epoch.</p>
<p>However, those, we cannot build a LIGO</p>
<p>and put it at the Big Bang.</p>
<p>So if you want to measure,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have the old time firecracker,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a firecracker,</p>
<p>and you want to see if it went off</p>
<p>in the building next door to you,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t see the imprint of it, but you can hear it.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re trying to do is hear</p>
<p>the effect of gravitational waves from the Big Bang,</p>
<p>not by using a camera or even an interferometer</p>
<p>like Barry used and his colleagues,</p>
<p>but instead using the CMB, the light,</p>
<p>the primordial ancient fossils of the universe,</p>
<p>the oldest light in the universe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna use that as a film, quote unquote,</p>
<p>onto which gravitational waves get exposed.</p>
<p>And hope you can, so what are the challenges there</p>
<p>to get enough accuracy for the exposure?</p>
<p>So the signal, as I said,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s 420 of these photons per cubic centimeter,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of cubic centimeters in the universe.</p>
<p>However, what we&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>is not the brightness of the photon, how intense it is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not looking for its color, what wavelength it is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for what its polarization is.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll go, let me just ask,</p>
<p>are you serious about the per cubic millimeter,</p>
<p>420 is the number?</p>
<p>Centimeter.</p>
<p>Yes, cubic centimeter, 420 is the number.</p>
<p>I wonder if Elon knows this,</p>
<p>and if he doesn&rsquo;t, he will truly enjoy this.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, funding security, excellent.</p>
<p>So I mean, this takes us to this story of heartbreak,</p>
<p>of triumph that you described in losing the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>So describe what polarization is that you mentioned.</p>
<p>Can you describe what bicep one and bicep two are,</p>
<p>bicep three, perhaps, the instruments</p>
<p>that can detect this kind of polarization?</p>
<p>What are the challenges, the origin story, the whole thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, so well, the origin story goes back again</p>
<p>to like a father son rivalry, it really does.</p>
<p>My father won all these prizes, awards, et cetera,</p>
<p>but he never won a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>And some parents in America, they compete with their kids.</p>
<p>Oh, I was a football player in high school, I&rsquo;ll show you.</p>
<p>And whatever, wrestling, whatever.</p>
<p>And some of us could be healthy too.</p>
<p>But with me and my dad, it wasn&rsquo;t super healthy.</p>
<p>Like we would compete and he was much more</p>
<p>of a pure mathematician and I was an experimental physicist.</p>
<p>So we had both different ideas</p>
<p>in what was worth prioritizing our time.</p>
<p>But I knew for sure he didn&rsquo;t win the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>And I knew I could kind of outdo him.</p>
<p>So I feel pretty venal and kind of minuscule</p>
<p>kind of character wise saying that.</p>
<p>The only reason you could outdo him</p>
<p>is because the Fields Medal is given every four years.</p>
<p>And only if you&rsquo;re under 40, which he was.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s working under much more limited conditions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, so even if I had, which spoiler alert,</p>
<p>the book&rsquo;s called Losing the Nobel Prize, so I didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But I wanted to do something big</p>
<p>and I wanted to do something that would really</p>
<p>just unequivocally be realized as in a discovery</p>
<p>for the ages, as in fact it was</p>
<p>when we made the premature announcement</p>
<p>that we had been successful.</p>
<p>So you were from the beginning reaching for the big questions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I cared about.</p>
<p>As an experimenter you were swinging for the fences.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I wanted to do.</p>
<p>I felt like if it&rsquo;s not, if it&rsquo;s worth spending</p>
<p>perhaps the rest of my life on as a scientist,</p>
<p>it better be damn well better be interesting to me</p>
<p>to carry me through, to give me the,</p>
<p>I always say passion is great when people say,</p>
<p>oh, follow your passion, but it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>Passion&rsquo;s like the spark that ignites the rocket,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not enough to get the rocket into space.</p>
<p>So then you swung for the fences with Bicep One.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>So Bicep One was born out of</p>
<p>kind of interesting circumstances.</p>
<p>So I had gone to Stanford University for a postdoc,</p>
<p>so an academic hunger games.</p>
<p>Stanford? Stanford University.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s this small little school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like that technical college in Massachusetts</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re affiliated with.</p>
<p>But as I went there, I was working</p>
<p>for a new assistant professor.</p>
<p>She had gotten there only a year before I got there,</p>
<p>and she had her own priorities,</p>
<p>the things that she wanted to do.</p>
<p>But I kept thinking in my spare time</p>
<p>that I wanted to do something completely different.</p>
<p>She was studying galaxies at high redshift,</p>
<p>and I wanted to study the origin of the universe</p>
<p>using this type of technology.</p>
<p>And I realized, courtesy of a good friend of mine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now at Johns Hopkins, Mark Haminkowski,</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t need this enormous Hubble telescope.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t need a 30 meter diameter telescope.</p>
<p>We needed a tiny refracting telescope,</p>
<p>no bigger than my head, less than a foot across.</p>
<p>And that telescope would have the same power</p>
<p>as a Hubble telescope, size telescope could have,</p>
<p>because the signals that we&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>are enormous in wavelength on the sky.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re enormously long, large area signals on the sky.</p>
<p>And if we could measure that,</p>
<p>it would be proof, effectively,</p>
<p>as close as you get to proof,</p>
<p>there could be things that mimic it,</p>
<p>but that we discovered the inflationary epoch.</p>
<p>Inflation being the signal originally conceived</p>
<p>by Alan Guth to explain why the universe</p>
<p>had the large scale features that it does,</p>
<p>namely that it has so called flat geometry.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no way to make a triangle in space</p>
<p>in our universe that has three interior angles</p>
<p>that do not sum to 180 degrees.</p>
<p>You can do that with spacecraft,</p>
<p>you can do that with stars,</p>
<p>you can do that with laser beams,</p>
<p>you can do that with three different galaxies.</p>
<p>All those galaxies, no matter how far you go,</p>
<p>have this geometry, it&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also unstable, it&rsquo;s very unlikely,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very seemingly finely tuned.</p>
<p>And that was one of the motivations that Guth had</p>
<p>to kind of conceive of this new idea called inflation 1979</p>
<p>when he was a postdoc also at Stanford, Slack.</p>
<p>And he was trying to get a permanent job,</p>
<p>I was trying to like make my name for myself.</p>
<p>And so I realized I could do this,</p>
<p>but I was also being paid by this professor at Stanford</p>
<p>to do a job for her.</p>
<p>And I was kind of a crappy employee, to be honest with you.</p>
<p>And then one day she couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore</p>
<p>because I was like sketching notebooks</p>
<p>and planning these experiments.</p>
<p>And I just, I wasn&rsquo;t, no, I actually.</p>
<p>Big ideas in your mind, you&rsquo;re planning big experiments.</p>
<p>And that was difficult to work with on a small scale</p>
<p>for like a postdoc type of situation</p>
<p>where you have to publish basic papers,</p>
<p>deliver on some basic deadlines for a project,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And support your advisors, paying, she was paying me.</p>
<p>And so one day I came in and it actually involved</p>
<p>another friend of mine, an astronomer named Jill Tarter,</p>
<p>one of the pioneers in the SETI science business</p>
<p>of detecting extraterrestrials,</p>
<p>which I assume you&rsquo;d never like to talk about aliens,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m sure we won&rsquo;t get into aliens.</p>
<p>But Jill was visiting Stanford and I was like,</p>
<p>I really wanna meet her, can you introduce me?</p>
<p>And she said, no, in fact, you&rsquo;re fired, my boss.</p>
<p>So I was like, this is possibly the best thing</p>
<p>that could ever happen to me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know where it would lead or what would happen to it,</p>
<p>but getting fired from this ultra prestigious university</p>
<p>turned out to be the path, I mean, literally,</p>
<p>that brings me here today, in that because of that,</p>
<p>I ended up working for another person in Caltech,</p>
<p>which is in Pasadena, and she, my original boss,</p>
<p>Sarah Church, she got me the job with her former advisor,</p>
<p>a man by the name of Andrew Lang.</p>
<p>And Andrew was like, he was like this, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s like Steve Jobs or Elon, charismatic,</p>
<p>handsome, persuasive, idea man,</p>
<p>not the guy always in the lobby and doing everything,</p>
<p>but understood where things are going decades from now.</p>
<p>And he had been involved in an experiment</p>
<p>that actually measured the universe was flat,</p>
<p>very close to flat, along with a preceding experiment</p>
<p>done at Princeton by Lyman Page and other collaborators.</p>
<p>So the shape of the universe is flat.</p>
<p>The geometry of the universe is flat.</p>
<p>How did he do that experiment?</p>
<p>So he used the cosmic microwave background.</p>
<p>And so what I said is you have to look for triangles</p>
<p>in the universe.</p>
<p>So you can measure triangles on earth.</p>
<p>You can actually, it&rsquo;s hard to show that the earth is curved,</p>
<p>but you can show the earth is curved using triangles,</p>
<p>mountain tops, et cetera,</p>
<p>if you have an accurate enough protractor.</p>
<p>Allegedly, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>God, you&rsquo;re like auto canceling.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>My ratings are gonna go up, man.</p>
<p>This is gonna be great.</p>
<p>Take out the cake.</p>
<p>If you want actual science, go listen to Brian.</p>
<p>If you want all of these conspiracy theories</p>
<p>or AKA the truth about flat earth, listen to him.</p>
<p>So what he used was the following triangle.</p>
<p>There are proto galaxy sized objects in the CMB.</p>
<p>The cosmic microwave background has these patches.</p>
<p>And so you can make a triangle out of the diameter</p>
<p>of one of these blobs of primordial plasma,</p>
<p>the soup that constitutes the early universe,</p>
<p>which is hydrogen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple material.</p>
<p>Understand hydrogen electrons and radiation, very simple.</p>
<p>Plasma physicists, son, understand it.</p>
<p>The diameter is one base of the triangle.</p>
<p>And then the distance to the earth is the other two legs.</p>
<p>So he measured along with his colleagues at Caltech</p>
<p>and then University of Rome and that&rsquo;s other group</p>
<p>at Princeton, measured the angle,</p>
<p>interior angle effectively very, very accurately</p>
<p>and showed that it added up to 180 degrees.</p>
<p>Can you localize accurately the patches in the CMB?</p>
<p>Can you know where they could trace them back location wise?</p>
<p>You can know where they are, but more than that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many of these patches.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re about one square degree on the sky.</p>
<p>The sky, you may know, a sphere has about 44,000</p>
<p>square degrees in a sphere.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s literally 44,000 of these size patches</p>
<p>over which he could do these kinds of measurements</p>
<p>to build up very good statistics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not exactly how they do it</p>
<p>or how they did it in this experiment called Boomerang,</p>
<p>but they did measure very accurately</p>
<p>the what was called the first Doppler peak</p>
<p>or acoustic peak in the plasma, the primordial plasma.</p>
<p>So the sphere has 44, approximately 44,000 square degrees.</p>
<p>So to cover a sphere, that&rsquo;s a very kind of important</p>
<p>data collection thing when you&rsquo;re sitting on a sphere</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking out into the observable universe.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of patches to work with.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in fact, a lot of the fast kind of algorithmic</p>
<p>decomposition of spheres and machine learning</p>
<p>in the early 2000s still used today</p>
<p>was created out of this field by data analysts</p>
<p>using this thing called hierarchical equal area triangles</p>
<p>called heel picks is what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>And so just stitch all this stuff together</p>
<p>and stitch it together very accurately.</p>
<p>Yeah, get high statistical significance</p>
<p>in order to reduce the statistical errors,</p>
<p>very clean signal and a measurement device</p>
<p>to reduce the systematic errors.</p>
<p>Those are the two predominant sources of error</p>
<p>in any measurement.</p>
<p>Those that can be improved by more and more measurement,</p>
<p>you take more and more measurements to this table,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get slightly better each time,</p>
<p>but you only win as the number of the one</p>
<p>over the square root of the number of measurements,</p>
<p>but the square root of 44,000 is pretty big.</p>
<p>So they were able to get a very accurate measurement.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not exactly how they did it.</p>
<p>They also have to do a Fourier analysis,</p>
<p>decompose that, do a power spectrum, filtration windows.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work that goes into it, image analysis,</p>
<p>and then comparing that with cosmological parameters,</p>
<p>very simple model, just six different numbers</p>
<p>that go into a model that made a prediction.</p>
<p>And one of those is the geometry of the universe pops out.</p>
<p>And that is the universe has zero spatial curvature,</p>
<p>and that was called boomerang.</p>
<p>So he had just come off of this.</p>
<p>Now, let me remind you, who was the first person</p>
<p>to measure the curvature of the earth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a guy named Aristophanes in the whatever,</p>
<p>lived around Aristotle&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>His name is in the history books.</p>
<p>So this guy, Andrew Lang, I was like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like the next Aristophanes.</p>
<p>I just wanted to work for this guy.</p>
<p>He clearly had this brand.</p>
<p>He was about 40 at the time, California</p>
<p>Scientist of the Year.</p>
<p>I was sure he was going to win a Nobel Prize for that.</p>
<p>And I knew that he, so I went down to Caltech</p>
<p>to give my job talk.</p>
<p>And he said, I love it.</p>
<p>You got a job.</p>
<p>And before I could even, before he finished the sentence,</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>It was too good to be true.</p>
<p>And I started working there at Caltech,</p>
<p>and slowly but surely, because Caltech&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a rich private university, at that time</p>
<p>run by a Nobel Prize winner by the name of David Baltimore,</p>
<p>he just wrote us a check.</p>
<p>Baltimore wrote us a check and said, get started on this idea.</p>
<p>And so we started coming up with the idea for what I later</p>
<p>named BICEP, background imaging cosmic extragalactic</p>
<p>polarization, which is kind of ironic,</p>
<p>because we ended up measuring galactic polarization.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to that in a minute.</p>
<p>But along the way, the idea was very simple.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to make the simplest telescope you can possibly</p>
<p>make, which is a refracting telescope.</p>
<p>Your eyes, you have two refracting telescopes</p>
<p>in your head.</p>
<p>Only way forward is making things more complex, right?</p>
<p>And when you make things complex in science,</p>
<p>you introduce the possibility for systematic errors.</p>
<p>And so we wanted to build the cleanest instrument.</p>
<p>Turns out the cleanest instrument</p>
<p>you can build in astronomy is a refracting telescope.</p>
<p>We also had to, unlike that telescope or Galileo&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we had to use very sensitive detectors that</p>
<p>were cooled less than 1 20th of the temperature</p>
<p>of the cosmic background itself, which</p>
<p>is the coolest temperature in the whole universe.</p>
<p>So we had to cool these down to about 0.1 or 0.2 degrees</p>
<p>Kelvin above absolute zero.</p>
<p>To do that, we needed to put it inside of a huge vacuum chamber</p>
<p>and suck out all the air molecules and water molecules</p>
<p>and take it to a very, very special place called the South</p>
<p>Pole Antarctica, from which I retrieved for you a patch.</p>
<p>There it is over there.</p>
<p>So when you go there, you get these bright red jackets.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>As somebody who was born in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>we obviously like to call it red.</p>
<p>United States Antarctic Program, the National Science</p>
<p>Foundation.</p>
<p>And the base is called the Amundsen Scott South Polar</p>
<p>Station.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little known fact of geopolitics</p>
<p>that whatever country occupies a region has ownership over it.</p>
<p>Now, there is a treaty in Antarctica.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t use it for military purposes, for mining,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if you know, but about 12 years ago,</p>
<p>Putin sent a submarine to the North Pole.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s no land at the North Pole, right?</p>
<p>So what did he do?</p>
<p>He stuck it in the ocean underneath.</p>
<p>But the South Pole is on a continent called Antarctica,</p>
<p>which was first reached about 110 years ago,</p>
<p>the first time in human history.</p>
<p>Antarctica means the opposite of the bear.</p>
<p>It means no bears there, basically opposite</p>
<p>of where polar bears are.</p>
<p>Arctic means polar bear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where in the Greek.</p>
<p>I did not know that.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>So Antarctica means the opposite place of that.</p>
<p>Humans never even saw it, let alone went to the South Pole,</p>
<p>which is kind of in the middle of the continent.</p>
<p>We went to take this telescope somewhere extremely dry.</p>
<p>It turns out the Sahara Desert, San Diego, Texas,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no place like the South Pole or Chile.</p>
<p>Those are the two premier places on Earth.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;d like to go into space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no water in space.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about cold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about dry.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why, for example, you can take this vodka,</p>
<p>and you could put it in this cup.</p>
<p>And we could take it over to a microwave somewhere</p>
<p>and heat it up.</p>
<p>After two minutes, three minutes, the water&rsquo;s boiling.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t touch it.</p>
<p>Take it from me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t touch it.</p>
<p>But you can touch the mug and take it out if you want to.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the mug is totally bone dry.</p>
<p>But the microwaves get absorbed by the water molecules</p>
<p>because water molecules resonate exactly</p>
<p>at these microwave frequencies.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t want these precious photons, 420 of them,</p>
<p>traveling per cubic centimeter from the Big Bang itself</p>
<p>to get absorbed in some water molecule in the Earth&rsquo;s</p>
<p>atmosphere.</p>
<p>So you take it to a place with the fewest number</p>
<p>of water molecules per square centimeter of surface area.</p>
<p>And that happens to be either Chile</p>
<p>or my other project, the Simons Observatory, is located.</p>
<p>Or you take it to the South Pole.</p>
<p>We took it to the South Pole and spent a couple of months</p>
<p>of my life down there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like being on Hoth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely otherworldly environment.</p>
<p>Ice, planar, flat as a pancake.</p>
<p>And the buildings are built up on stilts.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re built because the snow will otherwise cover them over.</p>
<p>The nearest medical facilities are 4,000 miles away.</p>
<p>If you have any issues with your wisdom teeth,</p>
<p>they yank them before you go down there.</p>
<p>If you have any issues with your appendix,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll cut it out of you before you go down there.</p>
<p>The Russians at Vostok base, not too far away,</p>
<p>about 600 miles away.</p>
<p>The doctors there, there&rsquo;s a famous picture of one</p>
<p>of them operating on himself, taking out his own appendix</p>
<p>in the middle of winter by himself.</p>
<p>So harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Science in the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>On Earth, at least.</p>
<p>And we go to those great lengths because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a pristine environment to observe these precious photons.</p>
<p>And we built this telescope.</p>
<p>And it weighs tens of thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>And it had to scan the sky almost like it&rsquo;s a robot.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s scanning the sky almost unattended.</p>
<p>We have a guy who spends a year of his life down there,</p>
<p>a girl who spends a year of their life down there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called winter overs.</p>
<p>They arrive in sometimes as early as November.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t leave until the following December.</p>
<p>And we always joke, we&rsquo;ll pay you $75,000.</p>
<p>You just have to work for one night of your life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a long night.</p>
<p>And what BICEP is, and I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring my polarized sunglasses here,</p>
<p>so I brought these actual polarizers here.</p>
<p>So if you take this and put it in front of your telescope</p>
<p>there, you have now made a polarimeter.</p>
<p>You have made a polarization sensitive telescope.</p>
<p>Now, you may not be able to immediately know</p>
<p>how you would use such a thing.</p>
<p>But one way to think about it, now take this guy</p>
<p>and look at a light, look at a light source.</p>
<p>Put one up to your eye.</p>
<p>And now put the other one in front of it anywhere.</p>
<p>And now rotate them.</p>
<p>What happens to the light source?</p>
<p>Becomes brighter and dimmer and brighter and dimmer.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s called a quadrupolar pattern, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s repeating.</p>
<p>It goes bright, dim, bright, dim.</p>
<p>It rotates twice in intensity for every single physical</p>
<p>rotation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the property of the photon.</p>
<p>The photon is a spin one field.</p>
<p>But the polarization of light is the axis</p>
<p>at which its electric field is oscillating.</p>
<p>Its electric field is marching straight up and straight down.</p>
<p>And so therefore, vertical polarization</p>
<p>is the same as negative vertical polarization.</p>
<p>And so you get the same pattern as you rotate two times</p>
<p>for every one physical rotation.</p>
<p>This is like a spin two object.</p>
<p>So now if you put that in front of the telescope,</p>
<p>you can do one of two things.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re polarizing all the light that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going in because you have one of the polarizers.</p>
<p>And then you can analyze it as you rotate the other one.</p>
<p>You can analyze it and change the amount of polarization.</p>
<p>Or you can put this kind of very special crystal in here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a crystal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called calcite.</p>
<p>This is from Lex Luthor, not Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>This crystal, put it on top of your printed notes</p>
<p>there and tell me what does it look like?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, like I could see everything twice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a double image.</p>
<p>That is a special crystal that has two different indices</p>
<p>of refraction.</p>
<p>So light emerging, which is unpolarized from the black ink,</p>
<p>comes out.</p>
<p>And it splits into two different directions.</p>
<p>And it could split even more if I made the crystal give you</p>
<p>my more expensive crystal.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all I have.</p>
<p>What is the crystal with this kind of property called?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called calcite.</p>
<p>This is crystal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called birefringent crystal.</p>
<p>Bi means two.</p>
<p>Refringent means refracting.</p>
<p>So this is a special type of material</p>
<p>that separates light based on its polarization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty clean bi signal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cleanly two.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing two very cleanly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very crisp, right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s yours to keep with every time you host me.</p>
<p>Now, take the polarizer underneath your left hand.</p>
<p>Put it on top of the crystal, and kind of move it back</p>
<p>and forth.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>You can switch.</p>
<p>As you rotate, you switch from one signal to the other.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of the refractions to the other.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>So that is now you are analyzing the polarization.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re confirming the light comes out of the crystal.</p>
<p>Two different types of polarization.</p>
<p>And effectively, what we do is we have those two things,</p>
<p>if you like.</p>
<p>But working in the microwave, so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the cosmic photons are brightest,</p>
<p>in the microwave regime in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re coupling that to a refracting telescope.</p>
<p>But your eyes are refracting telescopes.</p>
<p>So you are a polarimeter right now.</p>
<p>The human eye can actually slightly detect polarization.</p>
<p>But otherwise, it mainly detects its intensity of light</p>
<p>and the color.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call color and intensity, brightness.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re devising an instrument that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very precisely measuring that polarization.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And doing so in the microwave region with detectors</p>
<p>not made of biological human retina cells,</p>
<p>but of superconductors and things called bolometers.</p>
<p>And this has to be done at temperatures</p>
<p>close to absolute zero under vacuum conditions</p>
<p>one billionth of the pressure we feel here at sea level.</p>
<p>So why is it that this kind of device</p>
<p>could win a Nobel Prize?</p>
<p>So when the CMB was discovered, it</p>
<p>was discovered serendipitously.</p>
<p>There were two radio astronomers working at the time</p>
<p>at Bell Laboratories.</p>
<p>Now, why would Bell Laboratories be</p>
<p>employing radio astronomers?</p>
<p>Bell Laboratories was kind of like Apple,</p>
<p>or it was like a think tank, or it was Google.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it was like Google.</p>
<p>Google has Google X. It has this thing and that thing, right?</p>
<p>So they were working there.</p>
<p>But imagine if Google was employing radio astronomers.</p>
<p>They were actively recruiting them.</p>
<p>Why would they do that?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that was the beginning in the 1960s,</p>
<p>was the first commercial satellite</p>
<p>launch for communication.</p>
<p>And so Bell Labs, which would later become the telephone</p>
<p>part of AT&amp;T, the early telephone company,</p>
<p>later invent the first cell phone the year I was born.</p>
<p>And they would take that, 1946, and they</p>
<p>would take that telescope technology</p>
<p>that radio astronomers had developed,</p>
<p>and they would use that to see if they</p>
<p>could improve the signal to noise of the satellites</p>
<p>that they were seeing.</p>
<p>And they found they couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They found that they could not improve the signal to noise</p>
<p>ratio of the first telecommunication satellite.</p>
<p>It was like the equivalent to one kilobit per second modem.</p>
<p>They were bouncing signals from the West Coast</p>
<p>up to the satellite, bouncing it down,</p>
<p>landing it in New Jersey, of all places,</p>
<p>in northern New Jersey, Holmdell, New Jersey.</p>
<p>And these radio astronomers couldn&rsquo;t get rid of the signal.</p>
<p>So they said, well, New Jersey&rsquo;s not far from New York.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if the signal&rsquo;s coming from New York.</p>
<p>No, not coming from New York.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if it changes with the year.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s coming from the galaxy,</p>
<p>which was also discovered there by Jansky in 1930 something.</p>
<p>So in not being able to reduce the signal</p>
<p>or increase the signal to noise ratio, the noise was not good.</p>
<p>They knew the signal was right.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t get rid of the noise.</p>
<p>And there was excess noise over the model that</p>
<p>had not only been predicted by them,</p>
<p>but had been measured by a previous guy, a guy</p>
<p>by the name of Edward Ohm.</p>
<p>He measured the same signal, found</p>
<p>that there was this hiss of static, of radio static</p>
<p>that he could not get rid of, that had</p>
<p>a value of about 3 Kelvin.</p>
<p>So you can translate.</p>
<p>Remember I said, if you take a radio telescope</p>
<p>and you point it at an object that&rsquo;s hot,</p>
<p>the radio telescope&rsquo;s detector will</p>
<p>get to the same temperature as the object.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a principle of radio thermodynamics.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really interesting thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thermometer.</p>
<p>You can stick it into Jupiter from here on Earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And so we in radio astronomy characterize our signal</p>
<p>not by its intensity, but by its temperature.</p>
<p>So he found, this guy Edward Ohm, oh, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this 3 Kelvin signal.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get rid of it.</p>
<p>It must be I did my error analysis wrong.</p>
<p>And I would give him an F if he was one of my first year</p>
<p>students.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s just attributed to lack of understanding.</p>
<p>These other guys, Penzias and Wilson,</p>
<p>who are also radio astronomers, they said, no,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s build another experiment, put that inside</p>
<p>of our telescope, and do what&rsquo;s called calibration.</p>
<p>Inject a known source of signal every second that</p>
<p>has a temperature of about 4 Kelvin,</p>
<p>because the signal they&rsquo;re trying to get rid of</p>
<p>is about 3 Kelvin.</p>
<p>And you want to have it as close as possible</p>
<p>to the pernicious signal as possible.</p>
<p>They did that once a second.</p>
<p>So they got billions of measurements,</p>
<p>millions of measurements over the course</p>
<p>of several months, years, and even,</p>
<p>by the end of, you know, millions of measurements</p>
<p>for sure.</p>
<p>And they found they couldn&rsquo;t get rid of it either,</p>
<p>but they measured it was exactly 2.7265 degrees Kelvin.</p>
<p>So how does having a 4 Kelvin source,</p>
<p>how does the calibration work, just out of curiosity?</p>
<p>It could be larger.</p>
<p>Imagine like you&rsquo;re trying to calibrate the microphone.</p>
<p>Like you could do it with like a really loud sound,</p>
<p>but the gain would start to compress.</p>
<p>So there are amplifiers downstream from the detector</p>
<p>in every experiment that I&rsquo;ve ever worked on.</p>
<p>And they only have a linear region over a very small region.</p>
<p>And you want to keep it as linear as possible.</p>
<p>That means you want, if you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to compare like a voice,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to compare that to a jet engine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be as easy on the amplifiers</p>
<p>as getting a slightly loud gong or something, you know.</p>
<p>So the idea of the noise is present in both?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s noise present in both.</p>
<p>And you measure, what they did is</p>
<p>they made a separate measurement just</p>
<p>of the calibration system, which they measured</p>
<p>exactly very well.</p>
<p>4 Kelvin is the temperature of a liquid helium.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a temperature that&rsquo;s not going to change.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly not going to change</p>
<p>over a time scale of one second.</p>
<p>And so they could compare unknown signal,</p>
<p>known signal, unknown signal, known signal,</p>
<p>like a scale, like a balance.</p>
<p>So another way to think about it is like this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen these Libra kind of balances,</p>
<p>where you put two weights in a pan, right?</p>
<p>What happens if you put like a one ounce weight on one side</p>
<p>and a 20 kilogram weight in the other?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get any measurement, right?</p>
<p>You do get kind of a measurement if they&rsquo;re close in weight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they use 4 Kelvin.</p>
<p>Got it, but just to linger on the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a romantic element to the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re arriving at the same temperature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>And you measuring stuff in terms of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re measuring signal in terms of temperature</p>
<p>at the source.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you get to, I mean, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about temperature that&rsquo;s intimate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, especially since, you know, all life</p>
<p>is basically, you know, conversion of energy</p>
<p>and trying to control entropy,</p>
<p>which is then related to thermodynamics</p>
<p>exactly in that way.</p>
<p>And this is very crucial kind of thing to do in science</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t looking for the signal.</p>
<p>They found it accidentally,</p>
<p>these two scientists, Penzias and Wilson.</p>
<p>And I like to think that those kinds of discoveries</p>
<p>are the purest in science.</p>
<p>Like when you see something, Isaac Asimov once said,</p>
<p>like the most important reaction as a scientist is not,</p>
<p>Eureka, which means in Greek, as you know, I have found it.</p>
<p>No, he said, no, he said like, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a much better reaction</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s freaking cool.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a scientist, not like, oh, I found one.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>Surprise.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because if you find what you&rsquo;re gonna find,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what leads us susceptible to confirmation bias,</p>
<p>which is deadly inside, you know,</p>
<p>as close to deadly as possible.</p>
<p>So how does that take us to something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s potentially worthy of a Nobel Prize?</p>
<p>So Penzias and Wilson weren&rsquo;t looking for a signal.</p>
<p>They ended up discovering the heat leftover</p>
<p>from the fusion of helium from hydrogen, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that was a serendipitous discovery.</p>
<p>They won the Nobel Prize in 1978.</p>
<p>It was the first one ever awarded in cosmology.</p>
<p>My reasoning is, what if you could explain</p>
<p>not only how the elements got formed,</p>
<p>but how the whole universe got formed</p>
<p>and kill off every other model of science.</p>
<p>So if that weren&rsquo;t enough, every scientist, you know,</p>
<p>worth his or her salt had told me and Andrew Lang</p>
<p>and our colleagues, this is a slam dunk Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>if you could do it.</p>
<p>Because it was really explaining, again,</p>
<p>the stakes of this science is different</p>
<p>than like super fluidity, plasma physics.</p>
<p>When you talk about the origin of the universe,</p>
<p>it ties into everything.</p>
<p>It ties into philosophy, theology.</p>
<p>You realize if Paul Steinhardt is correct,</p>
<p>that the Bible can&rsquo;t be correct.</p>
<p>In other words, where the Bible is correct now</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t falsified, if you like, if you believe it.</p>
<p>I never use the Bible as a science book, obviously.</p>
<p>But the Bible speaks of a singular beginning.</p>
<p>What if you knew for sure the universe was not singular?</p>
<p>It would be more like the cosmology of Akhenaten</p>
<p>and Egyptians than the biblical Torah, Old Testament,</p>
<p>if you will, narrative.</p>
<p>So in my mind, the stakes could not be higher.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not an offense, because we need plasma physics.</p>
<p>We need every type of physics except maybe biophysics.</p>
<p>We literally use every branch of physics, thermodynamics,</p>
<p>superconductivity, quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>all that goes into our understanding</p>
<p>of the instrument.</p>
<p>And even further, if you want to understand the theory that</p>
<p>predicts the signal that we purport to measure.</p>
<p>So I rationalize that if Penzias and Wilson won the Nobel</p>
<p>Prize for this, if Hulse and Taylor won the Nobel</p>
<p>Prize for indirectly detecting gravitational waves,</p>
<p>this is decades before LIGO, by me detecting</p>
<p>gravitational waves indirectly, detecting how the universe</p>
<p>began, detecting the origin of the initial conditions</p>
<p>for the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which</p>
<p>won the Nobel Prize in 1983.</p>
<p>These are like five Nobel Prizes potentially.</p>
<p>For that reason, it seemed as close</p>
<p>as you could possibly get to being a slam dunk,</p>
<p>to outdo what my father did, to do really this impossible.</p>
<p>And at that time, Lex, again, it sounds weird.</p>
<p>Because people are like, oh, you still want the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still like greedy.</p>
<p>And look, you wrote another book about it.</p>
<p>And I always joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, if you want to see if I&rsquo;m a hypocrite,</p>
<p>just get them to give me the Nobel Prize in literature.</p>
<p>And if I accept it, then I&rsquo;m a hypocrite.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, well, we&rsquo;ll get to your current feelings</p>
<p>on the Nobel Prize in terms of hypocrite and so on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this ambition.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say this device, this kind of signal</p>
<p>could unlock many of the mysteries</p>
<p>about the early universe.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s excitement there.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take it then further.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a human story here of a bit of heartbreak.</p>
<p>Not only was this possibly worth a Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>if the Nobel Prize was given,</p>
<p>you were excluded from the list of three</p>
<p>that would get the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>So why were you excluded?</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a place to tell the story of Bicep 2.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Bicep 2, like iPhones,</p>
<p>or I know you&rsquo;re an Android fanboy,</p>
<p>but every year, they get a little bit better.</p>
<p>They get more megapixels.</p>
<p>They get more optics, triple X zoom, whatever, OK?</p>
<p>We upgraded our detectors as well.</p>
<p>The initial detectors were based on what</p>
<p>are called semiconductors.</p>
<p>They have certain properties that</p>
<p>make them very difficult to replicate at scale.</p>
<p>And we wanted to make them into superconductors, which</p>
<p>had a virtue that you could then mass produce them.</p>
<p>Why superconductors?</p>
<p>Well, again, we&rsquo;re measuring heat.</p>
<p>So one thing about a superconductor</p>
<p>is that it transitions from some finite resistance</p>
<p>to zero resistance over a very short span of temperature</p>
<p>range.</p>
<p>That means you can use that very short span dependency</p>
<p>as an accurate and sensitive and precise thermometer.</p>
<p>And so my brilliant colleagues around the world,</p>
<p>in this case, Jamie Bok, and nowadays, Suzanne Staggs</p>
<p>at Princeton, they are just exquisitely</p>
<p>making these sensors, tens of thousands of them.</p>
<p>The initial Bicep 1 instrument, of course,</p>
<p>we just call the Bicep, that only had 98 detectors.</p>
<p>Simon&rsquo;s Observatory is going to have 100 times more just</p>
<p>in one of our four telescopes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have 60,000 detectors operating</p>
<p>full time at 0.1 degree above absolute zero</p>
<p>in the Atacama Desert.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>But in the case of getting back to what Bicep did,</p>
<p>we upgraded and made Bicep 2.</p>
<p>In January 2010, we had just installed</p>
<p>in the exact same location at the South Pole,</p>
<p>in the same building, which is ominously called the Dark</p>
<p>Sector Laboratory, DSL, still operating to this very day,</p>
<p>we installed a new receiver on the same platform as before.</p>
<p>It had very similar identical optics, cryogenics, vacuum,</p>
<p>everything, except it went from 98 detectors to 512 detectors.</p>
<p>So almost an order of magnitude, very substantial upgrade.</p>
<p>And it had certain other features</p>
<p>that made it even more powerful than just a naive factor of 5.</p>
<p>And then we started observing with that.</p>
<p>And we knew we&rsquo;d have years to go,</p>
<p>and maybe we&rsquo;d never see anything.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re looking for these tiny little reverberations</p>
<p>in the fabric of space time produced</p>
<p>close to the origin of the universe as we could ever</p>
<p>get to.</p>
<p>So I was playing a role in that.</p>
<p>Obviously, it had upgraded my version of the original idea</p>
<p>that I had had for BICEP along with Andrew Lang.</p>
<p>And in January of 2010, I was at a meeting at UC Berkeley,</p>
<p>and I got a call from Andrew Lang&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>or I was in a meeting with Andrew Lang&rsquo;s thesis advisor,</p>
<p>Paul Richards at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>And he said that Andrew was dead.</p>
<p>He had taken his life by suicide.</p>
<p>And this is a man, and I had already lost my father</p>
<p>at this point in 2010, but he was like a father figure</p>
<p>to me, Andrew.</p>
<p>He would give me advice on marriage,</p>
<p>on how I should be with my kids, and what</p>
<p>was the most important way to move</p>
<p>through the academic ladder.</p>
<p>Again, he was predinaturally suited to win the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Everyone always thought he would win it.</p>
<p>If he were alive, he still could win it.</p>
<p>In fact, his wife, or his ex wife,</p>
<p>won it, Frances Arnold, in 2018.</p>
<p>And it was this power couple, and it destroyed me</p>
<p>for a long time, because he was just this magical person.</p>
<p>I mean, I couldn&rsquo;t conceive of my career, my life,</p>
<p>even these aspects of raising kids and being married</p>
<p>without him.</p>
<p>And to do it in that way, it felt like, again,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got kids, and I feel terrible for them, obviously.</p>
<p>But it did feel like a betrayal.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m just being honest with you.</p>
<p>It felt like, why the f did you not reach out?</p>
<p>I thought we were close, and I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I told him everything, and I felt</p>
<p>like he had told me everything.</p>
<p>And now he was gone.</p>
<p>And then, inevitably, we had to keep running the instrument.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s millions of dollars invested,</p>
<p>careers at stake, young people working tremendously hard.</p>
<p>And then here we were.</p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s going to take over the lead?</p>
<p>He was the lead of the project at Caltech.</p>
<p>And then it turned out that the other collaborators,</p>
<p>with whom I had been working for years and shared a lot of ups</p>
<p>and downs with as well, they had decided</p>
<p>to form a collaboration in which I was no longer</p>
<p>the principal investigator.</p>
<p>I was no longer one of the co principal investigators,</p>
<p>as I was on Bicep 1.</p>
<p>So I continued on Bicep 1 as the co leader of it,</p>
<p>but not on Bicep 2.</p>
<p>And obviously, that was pretty painful.</p>
<p>This is all happening at the same time</p>
<p>as you lose this father figure.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s this one betrayal in a way,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s another, or something</p>
<p>that feels like a betrayal.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he had been the only one</p>
<p>looking out for my interest in the new experiment.</p>
<p>I had moved from Caltech to UC San Diego,</p>
<p>and there were other postdocs in the mix,</p>
<p>all of whom had come there to work with him</p>
<p>to get the approbation that would then lead</p>
<p>to their careers taking off, as it did for mine.</p>
<p>And so there was a competition.</p>
<p>Science is not free from egos and competition</p>
<p>and desires, rightfully or wrongfully,</p>
<p>for credit and attribution.</p>
<p>Was he the source of strength and confidence</p>
<p>for you as a scientist, as a man?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re kind of alone in this world.</p>
<p>When you take on difficult things,</p>
<p>we often kind of grasp at a few folks</p>
<p>that give us strength.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Was he basically your only source of strength</p>
<p>in this whole journey, like primarily</p>
<p>in terms of this close knit?</p>
<p>As a scientist, there were really two.</p>
<p>There was one, this Russian cosmologist,</p>
<p>Alexander Polnareff, who thankfully is very much alive.</p>
<p>He was at Queen Mary University.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s retired.</p>
<p>He was kind of a theoretical, cosmological father to me.</p>
<p>And then Andrew was this counterpoint</p>
<p>that was teaching me, you need to have a brand as a scientist.</p>
<p>Every scientist has a brand.</p>
<p>And some of them don&rsquo;t protect it.</p>
<p>Some of them don&rsquo;t burnish it.</p>
<p>But some of the skills about being a scientist</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t teach our students involve,</p>
<p>how do you cultivate a scientific persona?</p>
<p>And he was the exemplar for that,</p>
<p>in addition to being the avuncular father figure type</p>
<p>character that really was the person I would talk to.</p>
<p>I had issues with when I had issues with my own students.</p>
<p>And he would tell me how those were.</p>
<p>And he would tell me his misgivings about people</p>
<p>that he worked with or things in his personal life.</p>
<p>And it was devastating.</p>
<p>But again, who the hell am I?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not his kid.</p>
<p>His kid&rsquo;s lost father.</p>
<p>So I feel guilty talking about it in that sense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a reality.</p>
<p>Well, there is something that&rsquo;s not often talked about</p>
<p>is people who collaborate on scientific efforts.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t, again, don&rsquo;t wanna compare,</p>
<p>but sometimes when the collaborations are truly great,</p>
<p>it sounds similar as when veterans talk about</p>
<p>their time serving together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bond that&rsquo;s formed.</p>
<p>So like comparing family and this kind of thing is,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not productive,</p>
<p>but the depth of the bond is nevertheless real</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re taking on something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking on the impossible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to achieve something,</p>
<p>sort of like there&rsquo;s this darkness,</p>
<p>this fog of mystery that we&rsquo;re all surrounded by,</p>
<p>which is what the human condition is.</p>
<p>And you are like grasping at hope</p>
<p>through the tools of science.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing that together</p>
<p>with like a confidence you probably should not have,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re boldly pushing through.</p>
<p>And then for him to take his own life,</p>
<p>can I ask you about this kind of moment that combined,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say betrayal,</p>
<p>but perhaps the feeling of betrayal</p>
<p>that Bicep 2 kind of goes on without you,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re part of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not part of the leadership group.</p>
<p>Can you describe those low points?</p>
<p>Was there a depression?</p>
<p>Or was there a crumbling of confidence?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it was so wrapped up</p>
<p>with my identity as a person.</p>
<p>You know, like there&rsquo;s only a few different ways</p>
<p>to have identity unless you&rsquo;re unhealthy psychologically.</p>
<p>One of them for scientists is often that they&rsquo;re a scientist</p>
<p>and that sometimes is their primary identity.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve got other husband and father,</p>
<p>but at that time that was my identity.</p>
<p>So to have that kind of taken away,</p>
<p>you know what, it reminded me of being kind of adopted</p>
<p>in a sense like the one who created me</p>
<p>or that I had played a role in my life,</p>
<p>that he abandoned me in the sense,</p>
<p>it felt like these people are abandoning me.</p>
<p>And the only thing I&rsquo;d correct about the analogy</p>
<p>that you use is like in the war,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all working for common good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I want to get the most kills.</p>
<p>I compare it more to like a band,</p>
<p>like think about the Beatles and what they did.</p>
<p>And then they ripped apart because of egos, credit,</p>
<p>they had solo careers,</p>
<p>they had relations with their intimates and so forth.</p>
<p>And there it&rsquo;s not only for the common good,</p>
<p>there is more of a zero sum aspect.</p>
<p>Like I would say, science is an infinite game.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t win science.</p>
<p>You never get to the, oh, we won science.</p>
<p>And even the Nobel prize, they don&rsquo;t feel like,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>They feel like a lot of times they&rsquo;re imposters</p>
<p>even to that day.</p>
<p>However, science is made up of a lot of finite games</p>
<p>where there is only one winner for tenure.</p>
<p>There is only three winners</p>
<p>or only three winners for the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>And because of that, I think it&rsquo;s heterodox</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very confusing, especially there&rsquo;s no guide.</p>
<p>I never got a guide how to be a professor,</p>
<p>how to teach, how to lead a research group,</p>
<p>how to deal with the death of an advisor,</p>
<p>how to deal with an unruly graduate student or two.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all like reinventing it,</p>
<p>which is kind of ironic and insane if you think about it.</p>
<p>Cause the academic system that I am a part of</p>
<p>and you are a part of is a thousand years old.</p>
<p>Dates back to Bologna, Northern Italy, 1088 or so.</p>
<p>First universities were established.</p>
<p>And very little has changed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some guy or gal scratching a rock</p>
<p>on another piece of rock and lecturing in front.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only one better aspect nowadays</p>
<p>is that back then the students could go on strike</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t like the professor</p>
<p>and then he or she wouldn&rsquo;t get paid.</p>
<p>Probably mostly it was he&rsquo;s back then.</p>
<p>Nowadays that barbaric process has been replaced</p>
<p>by tenure, so okay.</p>
<p>But no, it was a definite kind of feeling of the rug</p>
<p>getting pulled out from underneath me</p>
<p>because he was like my consigliore.</p>
<p>He was a guy I sought counsel and counseled me</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>And I felt like there is no one</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna honor the agreements that we had.</p>
<p>And he was a very soulful person.</p>
<p>He was so much better at being a scientist</p>
<p>than I could ever be.</p>
<p>And just a loss for the cosmos, it just really hurt.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh, it&rsquo;s so sad</p>
<p>cause he could have won the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think like that anymore.</p>
<p>First I think about his kids.</p>
<p>Felt at first now there goes my chance</p>
<p>at winning a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>And hence the title of the book was like,</p>
<p>I knew I would not win the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>It also means that there&rsquo;s parts of the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>that have to be done away with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a double entendre.</p>
<p>Like we need to lose aspects of the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>to help science out.</p>
<p>We can talk about that a different time.</p>
<p>But in the context of like now thinking back on it,</p>
<p>that was such a minuscule part of it.</p>
<p>Because let&rsquo;s say he did win the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>or I did win the, or any of us did.</p>
<p>Would that have changed anything?</p>
<p>Would that have brought anything back?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, we say it&rsquo;s like vanity, it&rsquo;s futility.</p>
<p>And I just, for me, the Nobel Prize is like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say it&rsquo;s like insignificant,</p>
<p>because obviously it has a lot of power</p>
<p>and it has influence.</p>
<p>And I went back, I had Neil deGrasse Tyson on my show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna name drop, okay?</p>
<p>And he prepares.</p>
<p>He prepares like a surgeon before doing surgery</p>
<p>when he goes on a talk show.</p>
<p>So you see him going on Colbert Report.</p>
<p>You think, oh, they just have a banter.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just naturally gifted.</p>
<p>No, he said, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You say that, you&rsquo;re undermining what he does.</p>
<p>What he does is he goes back.</p>
<p>He watches the last month of Colbert Reports</p>
<p>or whatever it&rsquo;s called, late show.</p>
<p>And he says, how long does Steven pause between questions?</p>
<p>How long in the news cycle does he go back?</p>
<p>What topics has he talked about with people similar to me?</p>
<p>So I took Neil and I did that for you.</p>
<p>And I look back, how many times has Lex</p>
<p>mentioned the words Nobel and prize?</p>
<p>And I put it into Google Ngram and out came</p>
<p>exactly the same number of times as show episodes</p>
<p>as of this moment.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve said the words Nobel Prize over 240 times.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it is so strange as a symbol</p>
<p>that kind of unites this whole scientific journey, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s both sad and beautiful</p>
<p>that a little prize, a little award, a medal,</p>
<p>a little plaque, they&rsquo;ll be most likely forgotten</p>
<p>by history completely, some silly list.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow a catalyst for greatness.</p>
<p>It resulted in you doing your life&rsquo;s work, the dream of it.</p>
<p>Would I have done it without the Nobel Prize?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t necessarily counterfactually state</p>
<p>that that would have happened.</p>
<p>So no, it definitely has a place.</p>
<p>And for me, it is valuable to think about it.</p>
<p>But the level of obsession that academics have about it</p>
<p>is really, I think it is almost on balance</p>
<p>becoming unhealthy.</p>
<p>And again, I have no, I make no truck</p>
<p>with the winners of the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Obviously, now I&rsquo;ve had 11 on the show.</p>
<p>And to think about the one rule,</p>
<p>so by the way, right after the denouement of the story,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll get to in a bit,</p>
<p>how our dreams went down to dust and ashes,</p>
<p>I was asked by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>to nominate the winners of the 2015 Nobel Prize in physics.</p>
<p>So like the one that I theoretically</p>
<p>could have been eligible to win in 2016, actually,</p>
<p>they asked me to nominate.</p>
<p>Now imagine if I ask you, Lex,</p>
<p>you say, Brian, instead of me inviting myself on the show,</p>
<p>if you say, Brian, would you like to come</p>
<p>on the Lex Friedman podcast?</p>
<p>I say, you know what, Lex?</p>
<p>You know that guy Rogan?</p>
<p>I think you might know him.</p>
<p>Can you introduce him to me?</p>
<p>Like, do you imagine how that would feel?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;d be like, ah, you know.</p>
<p>So I was asked to nominate the winners.</p>
<p>And the one rule that they say,</p>
<p>of all the rules that Alfred Nobel stipulated,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only one rule that they maintained.</p>
<p>In other words, he said one person can win it</p>
<p>for something they discovered in the preceding year</p>
<p>that had the greatest benefit to mankind,</p>
<p>made the world better, right?</p>
<p>None of that was mentioned in the letter.</p>
<p>It said many people can win it, worked on long ago.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t mention anything in the letter to me,</p>
<p>signed by the Secretary General.</p>
<p>Nothing about benefiting mankind.</p>
<p>They said, just one thing, can&rsquo;t nominate yourself.</p>
<p>So none of these guys nominated themselves.</p>
<p>Actually, little known fact,</p>
<p>they sent that exact letter just to you.</p>
<p>That rule was created just for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called the Keating Correlate, yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Just to like. Good for them.</p>
<p>Rub it in.</p>
<p>I mean, in this particular case, of course,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some weird technicality or whatever,</p>
<p>but in this particular case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a powerful reminder.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That the Nobel Prize leaves a lot of people behind</p>
<p>in their stories behind all of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, here&rsquo;s a good example.</p>
<p>Again, this is my friend, Barry Barash.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s become like a mentor and a friend.</p>
<p>He wrote the foreword to my book, Into the Impossible.</p>
<p>He won the Nobel Prize because a different guy died,</p>
<p>and he admits it, and he said it.</p>
<p>And actually, it&rsquo;s funny with him</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve heard you talk very rhapsodically</p>
<p>and lovingly and romantically about,</p>
<p>with Harry Kliff and a wonderful podcast with him,</p>
<p>by the way, about the LHC and how wonderful it is</p>
<p>and how in that we were about to build</p>
<p>the superconducting supercollider right here in Texas,</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t get built and it got canceled by Congress.</p>
<p>And I say to Barry,</p>
<p>that was the best thing that ever happened to you.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, what the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, if that didn&rsquo;t get canceled,</p>
<p>first of all, even though it did get canceled,</p>
<p>the Europeans went on to build it themselves,</p>
<p>saved the American taxpayers billions of dollars,</p>
<p>and we wouldn&rsquo;t have learned anything</p>
<p>really substantially new as proven by the fact</p>
<p>that as you and Harry talked about,</p>
<p>nothing besides the Higgs particle of great note</p>
<p>has come out, and actually, he&rsquo;s had a recent paper,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been an upper limit along with his collaborators</p>
<p>on LHCb experiment that I&rsquo;m gonna be talking with him about.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is it was really built</p>
<p>to detect the Higgs.</p>
<p>So the SSC, for twice as much money,</p>
<p>would have sucked up Barry&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>He would have been working on that, maybe not.</p>
<p>And then he would never have worked on LIGO,</p>
<p>and then he wouldn&rsquo;t have won the Nobel Prize, right?</p>
<p>So you look at counterfactual history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not actually a big stretch, right?</p>
<p>If the SSC had still gone on, he would have worked on it,</p>
<p>because he was one of the primary leaders</p>
<p>of that experiment.</p>
<p>Second thing, imagine the following thing had happened.</p>
<p>They won the Nobel Prize because in September 2015,</p>
<p>they detected unequivocal evidence</p>
<p>for the in spiral collision of two massive black holes,</p>
<p>each about 30 times the mass of the sun,</p>
<p>leaving behind an object that had just less than 60 solar</p>
<p>masses behind.</p>
<p>So one solar mass worth of matter</p>
<p>got massed, got converted to pure gravitational energy.</p>
<p>No light was seen by them.</p>
<p>This particular date, September 14, 2015,</p>
<p>that explosion, because of the miracle of time travel</p>
<p>that telescopes afford us, that actually took place</p>
<p>1.2 billion years ago in a galaxy far, far away.</p>
<p>They actually don&rsquo;t know which galaxy it took place in.</p>
<p>Still, then they never will.</p>
<p>OK?</p>
<p>If that collision between these two things, which</p>
<p>have probably been orbiting each other for maybe a million</p>
<p>years or more, if that had occurred 15 days earlier,</p>
<p>Barry wouldn&rsquo;t have won the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s hilarious to think that there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>human that won the Nobel Prize because two giant things</p>
<p>collided.</p>
<p>A billion, 200 million years ago.</p>
<p>And if it had happened 18 days, 20 days, 30 days,</p>
<p>because that was the deadline for the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>to be announced, they announced the findings in February.</p>
<p>But you have to nominate the winners in January.</p>
<p>So I could have nominated them up until January 30.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t announce anything,</p>
<p>and there were just rumors.</p>
<p>But the reason that he wouldn&rsquo;t have won it,</p>
<p>because there was another guy who was still alive,</p>
<p>considered to be the founder and father of the three fathers,</p>
<p>Ray Weiss, who did win it, Kip Thorne, who did win it,</p>
<p>and this third gentleman at Caltech named Ron Drever,</p>
<p>who passed away again.</p>
<p>He was alive in 2016.</p>
<p>He died in the middle of 2017.</p>
<p>And then he was awarded the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>And here we are, several billion of hairless apes</p>
<p>that strangely wear clothing, celebrated three other clothed</p>
<p>hairless apes with a medal, with one particular element.</p>
<p>And then they made speeches in a particular language</p>
<p>that evolved in a&hellip;</p>
<p>Bend down to get those medals in front of another guy</p>
<p>who wears even fancier clothes, who is the king of Sweden.</p>
<p>And then they got some free food afterwards.</p>
<p>They get some reindeer meat, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Okay, excellent.</p>
<p>Since you mentioned Joe Rogan in that little example,</p>
<p>what happened to you in terms of BICEP2?</p>
<p>I want to kind of speak at a high level</p>
<p>about a particular thing I observed.</p>
<p>So I was a fan of Joe Rogan since he started the podcast.</p>
<p>I just listened to the podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of podcasts in general.</p>
<p>And it also coincided with my entry into grad school</p>
<p>and this whole journey of academia.</p>
<p>So grad school, getting my PhD, then going to MIT,</p>
<p>and then Google, and then just looking at this whole world</p>
<p>of research.</p>
<p>What I really loved about how Joe Rogan approaches the world</p>
<p>is that he celebrates others, like he promotes them.</p>
<p>He gets like genuinely, and I now know this</p>
<p>from just being a friend privately,</p>
<p>he genuinely gets excited by the success of others.</p>
<p>And the contrast of that to how folks in academia</p>
<p>often behave was always really disappointing to me</p>
<p>because the natural, just on a basic human level,</p>
<p>there is an excitement, but the nature of that excitement</p>
<p>is more like I&rsquo;m happy for my friend,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m really jealous and I want to even outdo them.</p>
<p>I want to celebrate them, but I want to do even better.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s even for friends.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not a genuine, pure excitement for others.</p>
<p>And then to couple that with just you now</p>
<p>as a host of a popular podcast and all this feeling,</p>
<p>which is like there&rsquo;s not even a willingness</p>
<p>to celebrate publicly the awesomeness of others.</p>
<p>People in academia are often best equipped technically</p>
<p>in terms of language to celebrate others.</p>
<p>They understand the beauty, like the full richness</p>
<p>of why the cool idea is as cool as it is.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re in the best position to celebrate it.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s a feeling that if I celebrate others,</p>
<p>they might end up on the cover of Nature or whatever,</p>
<p>and not me.</p>
<p>They turn it into zero sum game.</p>
<p>The reason why I think Rogan has been an inspiration to me</p>
<p>and many others is that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>And forget money and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a narrative told that academics are this way</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a limited amount of money.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re fighting for this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the reason it&rsquo;s happening this way.</p>
<p>I think you can have a limited amount of money.</p>
<p>The battle for money happens in the space of proposal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s networking, there&rsquo;s private stuff.</p>
<p>Public celebration of others and just actually</p>
<p>just how you feel in the privacy of your own heart</p>
<p>is not have to do anything with money.</p>
<p>It has to do with you having a big ego</p>
<p>and not humbling yourself to the beauty of the journey</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all on.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s folks like Joe Rogan who in a comedian circles</p>
<p>is also rare, but he inspired all these other comedians</p>
<p>to realize, you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to celebrate each other.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re promoting each other and therefore the pie grows.</p>
<p>Cause everybody else gets excited about this whole thing</p>
<p>and the pie grows.</p>
<p>Right now the scientists by fighting,</p>
<p>like by not celebrating each other,</p>
<p>are not growing the pie.</p>
<p>And now because of that sort of science becomes</p>
<p>less and less popular.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a flywheel and exactly.</p>
<p>No, and I want to point out two things.</p>
<p>One is that I remember you went on Joe&rsquo;s show</p>
<p>maybe a couple of years ago and then he gave you a watch.</p>
<p>He gave you like a Rolex, right?</p>
<p>And I tweeted to you and I think it&rsquo;s Omega, sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>The watch that went to the moon,</p>
<p>which we will get to in a bit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he could give you what I gave you though,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get to what that final gift package is for you.</p>
<p>And by the way, I also wanted to mention,</p>
<p>because when you said Joe Rogan, I would not be upset.</p>
<p>And you should definitely go on Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>And we had this conversation with him.</p>
<p>Cause I was like, when I was moving to Austin</p>
<p>and had a conversation like, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s weird?</p>
<p>Like if we have the same guests at the same time</p>
<p>or whatever, he&rsquo;s like, fuck that.</p>
<p>I want you to be more successful than me.</p>
<p>I want, he truly wants everybody like,</p>
<p>especially people close to him to be more successful.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s not even a thought like.</p>
<p>But you know why he does.</p>
<p>And this is what I tweeted to you.</p>
<p>And one of the few things I think you have retweeted</p>
<p>that I sent you.</p>
<p>I said, someday you&rsquo;re going to give that to somebody.</p>
<p>And today I wanted that to be me.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s Omega.</p>
<p>No, but the point is he sees in you that same,</p>
<p>grandiosity, that same genuine spirit graciousness.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And you do do something very rare.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to turn this into too much of a love fest,</p>
<p>but I do want to say even back to Andrew,</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ve almost been hagiographic about,</p>
<p>just treating him like a saint.</p>
<p>He said to me the same thing.</p>
<p>And in a moment of peak said like,</p>
<p>God damn it.</p>
<p>Like I have to train these guys and women that work for me</p>
<p>so that they can be better than me,</p>
<p>so that they can go out and compete with me</p>
<p>for the same limited amount of funding from the Fing NSL.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t his, that wasn&rsquo;t who he was.</p>
<p>That was just an expression,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m doing something which is fundamentally,</p>
<p>but you know what, when you have kids,</p>
<p>hopefully, you know, please God, you will someday.</p>
<p>Cause I think, and I hope we can get to talk</p>
<p>about that later, but part of investment</p>
<p>and part of doing something when you have a kid,</p>
<p>like you can get married.</p>
<p>You can marry someone cause she&rsquo;s rich or he&rsquo;s rich,</p>
<p>or you can marry someone cause they&rsquo;re good looking</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s good looking.</p>
<p>You can marry for all these different reasons</p>
<p>that are ultimately selfish.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way you can have a kid and be selfish.</p>
<p>Nobody says like, oh, you know what?</p>
<p>I really want this thing that&rsquo;s three feet tall,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t speak English, that craps on my floor,</p>
<p>that wakes me up all hours of the night,</p>
<p>that interferes with my love life.</p>
<p>Nobody says that cause it doesn&rsquo;t benefit you</p>
<p>for months and months.</p>
<p>A friend of mine who actually does the videos for me</p>
<p>and does a lot of my solo videos,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s having his first kid, he&rsquo;s like, what do I do?</p>
<p>Cause it always gets stupid, I&rsquo;ll catch up on sleep now.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna store sleep in my sleep bank.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t think Huberman and you talked about that, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that, that&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>What you can do, give the kid a bath, feed the baby,</p>
<p>let the mother relax.</p>
<p>Like, in other words, do the things,</p>
<p>and this really relates back to what Aristotle once said.</p>
<p>Aristotle once said, why do parents love kids</p>
<p>more than kids love parents?</p>
<p>As much as you love your dad and your mom,</p>
<p>they still love you more.</p>
<p>And because you love that what you sacrifice for.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a proof.</p>
<p>I know a lot of families that have kids with special needs.</p>
<p>Some with severe, one of my uncles on the Keating side</p>
<p>had a severe, what they called mental retardation,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s probably has a different name.</p>
<p>That, out of the nine other brothers and sisters,</p>
<p>he was their favorite.</p>
<p>Because they had to sacrifice so much for him.</p>
<p>And I think of that, you know, in the small case,</p>
<p>like Joe is kind of mentoring you or whatever,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna mentor someone else.</p>
<p>You love that what you sacrifice for.</p>
<p>Sacrifice is reduction of entropy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s storing and investing, and you wanna protect that.</p>
<p>And you know, that to me really speaks to this.</p>
<p>So yeah, I don&rsquo;t hold it against.</p>
<p>But it is true, like scientists are, you know,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re described again, they&rsquo;re often said</p>
<p>to be like children, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard this description.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re inquisitive, they&rsquo;re curious, they&rsquo;re passionate.</p>
<p>They love that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, and they don&rsquo;t play well with others.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re jealous, they&rsquo;re petty, they&rsquo;re selfish,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t share their ball and they&rsquo;ll go home.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a single edge sword.</p>
<p>I wish there were, you know,</p>
<p>because we need some more of that</p>
<p>because you gotta dull it up.</p>
<p>But in this case, he, you know,</p>
<p>I think when you have this kind of investment in science,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be natural.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to like, you know,</p>
<p>feed the flames of competition.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m like really venerate.</p>
<p>If you go to the homepage of the NSF</p>
<p>or the Department of Energy</p>
<p>or the recently released National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>future of science for the astronomical sciences</p>
<p>for the next 25 years or more,</p>
<p>they talk about how many Nobel prizes</p>
<p>these different science things could win.</p>
<p>Exoplanets, life, the discovery of the CMB,</p>
<p>B mode polarization, the nice, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s figure two in this thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what message is that sent to kids,</p>
<p>like to young people?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what you should be doing</p>
<p>so that you win this small, as you said,</p>
<p>this prize given out by one hairless ape</p>
<p>to another wearing a fancier costume using reindeer.</p>
<p>Especially in the case of Nobel prize,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only currently given to three people.</p>
<p>At most, which was never one of his stipulate.</p>
<p>He actually said one, he could only give it to one person.</p>
<p>So they change it.</p>
<p>Why did they change it?</p>
<p>I talk about, I speculate.</p>
<p>By the way, the book&rsquo;s only three chapters out of 11</p>
<p>about the Nobel prize and it&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>But you know, one of the things that&rsquo;s been so interesting,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m speaking, actually this coming up in December</p>
<p>is that the Nobel prize is given out</p>
<p>on the day of Alfred Nobel&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of, and they bring in flowers,</p>
<p>not from his birthplace, but from his mausoleum,</p>
<p>which is in San Romino in Italy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of like death fascination.</p>
<p>Denial of death features heavily in the Nobel prize</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, what outlives a person?</p>
<p>Well, science can outlive a person.</p>
<p>My father has a theorem named after him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still engraved in many places around the world.</p>
<p>You or I, we can go to different places around the world.</p>
<p>People know who we are based on our publications.</p>
<p>We engrave things, we want to store things,</p>
<p>we want to compress things.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s something beautiful about that,</p>
<p>but there is a notion of denial of death.</p>
<p>Like there is a notion of what will outlast me,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re among the many 90 something percent</p>
<p>of members of the National Academy</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe in an active faith and a creator and a God.</p>
<p>And science can substitute for that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not ultimately as fulfilling.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t believe it can fulfill a person the way</p>
<p>even practicing, but not believing in a religion</p>
<p>can fulfill a person.</p>
<p>So, which is interesting</p>
<p>because you do bring up Ernest Becker</p>
<p>and the denial of death in losing the Nobel prize book.</p>
<p>And there is a sense in which that&rsquo;s probably in part</p>
<p>at the core of this, especially later dream</p>
<p>of the Nobel prize or a prize of recognition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve interacted with a few or a large number of scientists</p>
<p>that are getting up in age.</p>
<p>And there is the feeling of real pride of happiness in them</p>
<p>from winning awards and getting certain recognitions.</p>
<p>And I probably at the core of that is a kind of a mortality</p>
<p>or a kind of desire for mortality.</p>
<p>And that was always off putting to me as opposed to,</p>
<p>I mean, I know it sounds weird to say it&rsquo;s off putting,</p>
<p>but it just, rather than celebrating the pure joy</p>
<p>of solving the puzzles of the mysteries all around us,</p>
<p>just the actual exploration of the mysterious for its own sake.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I said, it&rsquo;s like a scientist should,</p>
<p>okay, you have to be careful and not have any physical,</p>
<p>it has to be platonic,</p>
<p>but you can think of scientists and mentor.</p>
<p>I have a chart in the book and in my plaque</p>
<p>made by one of my graduate students, former graduate students.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s now a professor in New Mexico, Darcy Barron.</p>
<p>And she made this plaque and it has 17 generations.</p>
<p>So here I am, 17 levels down, there&rsquo;s a guy,</p>
<p>Leibniz, not the famous Leibniz, different Leibniz,</p>
<p>1596 he was born and I&rsquo;m in this chain.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you know this,</p>
<p>but in the Russian language,</p>
<p>the word scientist means someone who was taught.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it very simply, one who was taught, right?</p>
<p>Uchony.</p>
<p>So it probably means a guy was taught, right?</p>
<p>No, uchony, no, no, no, it&rsquo;s a person.</p>
<p>Uchony, no, no, no, it&rsquo;s literally someone who was taught.</p>
<p>Someone who was taught, right.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>To me, it has a dual kind of meaning, at least dual meaning.</p>
<p>One is that you have to be a good student to be a scientist</p>
<p>because you have to learn from somebody else.</p>
<p>Two, you have to be a teacher, you have to pay it forward.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t, I claim you&rsquo;re really not a scientist</p>
<p>in the truest sense.</p>
<p>And I feel like with the work that I do in outreach</p>
<p>and stuff like that, I&rsquo;m doing it at scale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m influencing more than 24 kids I might have</p>
<p>in my graduate class or undergraduate class,</p>
<p>and potentially could reach thousands of people</p>
<p>around the world and make them into scientists themselves.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the flywheel that is only beneficial.</p>
<p>There is no competition.</p>
<p>There is no zero sum fixed mindset versus growth mindset</p>
<p>because it is an infinite game.</p>
<p>Imagine a culture that had none of the trappings</p>
<p>of the negativity of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>or pre World War I Germany or Imperial Japan.</p>
<p>Science celebrated.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just making a nation of scientists.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not doing it to become multi billionaires</p>
<p>or necessarily for any military purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>But if we have that, sometimes I&rsquo;m flying home at night.</p>
<p>When you fly into LA, you literally, it&rsquo;s very rare,</p>
<p>you can see the number 10 million.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to visualize things.</p>
<p>You see a brick wall, you ask how many bricks are there?</p>
<p>It might be 1,000, 2,000.</p>
<p>10 million lights.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 10 million souls.</p>
<p>And you can see they&rsquo;re discrete.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not like the Milky Way all blending together.</p>
<p>Each lost in their own busy lives, excited, fall in love,</p>
<p>afraid of losing their job, all that.</p>
<p>By the way, people should know that you&rsquo;re a pilot.</p>
<p>So you literally mean fly.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes I get to do it.</p>
<p>You get to look at the eye of God perspective</p>
<p>on these 10 million, on these millions of helpless apes.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re like constellations,</p>
<p>but upside down, like the city.</p>
<p>This is like a constellation.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ll stay and keep the plane the right way up.</p>
<p>But when you think about that,</p>
<p>imagine they&rsquo;re all working together.</p>
<p>And imagine you always talk about love.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re not worthy of love.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking down on them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just amazing.</p>
<p>Because you think, what amazing creation has man and humans?</p>
<p>And what can we do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s phenomenal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>
<p>And then I get to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a job I say, don&rsquo;t tell Gavin Newsom,</p>
<p>but I do it for free.</p>
<p>I love what I do.</p>
<p>But to think about, oh, if my student succeeds, then I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>No, it is unfortunate that you have experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly experienced it.</p>
<p>And I think there are ways around it.</p>
<p>I think it is a vexing problem.</p>
<p>Because people want to, it&rsquo;s very tempting</p>
<p>to keep your own garden fertilized.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s interesting is people are like,</p>
<p>why are you doing this thing?</p>
<p>And podcasts, and you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to be a serious scientist leading this huge project,</p>
<p>and collaborators.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, most of what I do, as I said before,</p>
<p>for you it&rsquo;s Velcro.</p>
<p>For me it&rsquo;s like, what is the deal with the safety standards</p>
<p>on the truck that we&rsquo;re driving up to deliver the diesel fuel</p>
<p>that will power the generator that</p>
<p>will allow the concrete truck to move?</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the Big Bang</p>
<p>inflation, the multiverse, God&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>So those are people I say I have to talk to.</p>
<p>The people that come on the show, those</p>
<p>are people I want to talk to.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s super fun.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a real honor that I get to do it.</p>
<p>I have some unfair advantages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at a top university.</p>
<p>We have people that&rsquo;s affiliated with the Arthur C. Clark</p>
<p>Foundation, brilliant scientists coming through.</p>
<p>But I felt like it would be kind of a shame</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t allow them to teach at scale,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re better teachers than I am.</p>
<p>Let me ask you an interesting, maybe difficult question.</p>
<p>Have you ever considered talking on your podcast</p>
<p>with the people who would get the Nobel Prize for BICEP2</p>
<p>if it turned out to be detecting what it is?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m still friends with them.</p>
<p>And they have still gone on to.</p>
<p>So we should say why we didn&rsquo;t win the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>and then what happened with the group that</p>
<p>is now leading it that I&rsquo;m completely divorced</p>
<p>from in a secular sense.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re friends.</p>
<p>We see each other.</p>
<p>We send each other emails and stuff like that.</p>
<p>I would love to get their sense of what</p>
<p>the natural heartbreak built into the whole process</p>
<p>of the Nobel Prize, what their sense is.</p>
<p>I would love to hear an honest, real conversation.</p>
<p>I understand you&rsquo;re friends, but there&rsquo;s some hard truth</p>
<p>that even friends don&rsquo;t talk about until you put a mic.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t happy I wrote the book.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember one of them was like, well,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s this I hear about a book?</p>
<p>And I mean, a lot of people told me not to write the book.</p>
<p>They said it&rsquo;s going to give too much attention</p>
<p>to the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to look like sour grapes.</p>
<p>Again, I say you can prove I have sour grapes or not.</p>
<p>Just give me the next prize.</p>
<p>So if you get a Nobel Prize for literature,</p>
<p>you would turn it down?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because Sabina Hassenfelder,</p>
<p>who is a fellow YouTube sensation,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s so gracious and so good.</p>
<p>She has that German, just gentle and genteelness.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a little too nice for my taste, I would say.</p>
<p>I wish she could really say what she thinks and be</p>
<p>snarky on occasion.</p>
<p>So she wrote a review of my book when it came out</p>
<p>three or four years ago.</p>
<p>And she said, well, you know, Brian Keating,</p>
<p>she said, well, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>He talks a lot about cosmology.</p>
<p>But they can do whatever the hell they want.</p>
<p>And he presumably has these problems with it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s none of his business, basically.</p>
<p>And at the end, she said, but if you want one good thing,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a really good writer.</p>
<p>And who knows?</p>
<p>He could win the Nobel Prize in literature someday.</p>
<p>And then she allowed me to publish a rebuttal</p>
<p>on her blog, which was kind of funny.</p>
<p>But anyway, no.</p>
<p>So getting back to the guys that we were kind of collaboratimies</p>
<p>or frenemies, we&rsquo;re still, look, we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wish each other active ill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve visited them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re welcome to visit me.</p>
<p>They have visited me.</p>
<p>The thing I have to say is that I just</p>
<p>wonder about introspection.</p>
<p>For me, literally, I don&rsquo;t care about the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>other than what it can do to benefit science.</p>
<p>But I no longer, I did, but by the way,</p>
<p>I did seriously care about how it would benefit Brian Keating</p>
<p>early on in my career.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just totally honest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not proud of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of embarrassing.</p>
<p>But now I would hope that people would say, like, OK,</p>
<p>the guy is like, you know, he&rsquo;s obsessed with it.</p>
<p>My next book is not about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about something completely different.</p>
<p>And I do feel like people lack introspection a lot of times</p>
<p>in science.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think about why we&rsquo;re doing what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I think it comes down to curiosity.</p>
<p>One thing about Joe, and again, I&rsquo;ve only listened to,</p>
<p>like, I have to confess.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re like, my father.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m confessing my sins to you, Father Lex.</p>
<p>Father Friedman.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t listened to, like, that many of your episodes</p>
<p>start to finish, OK?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with our friend, mutual friend, Eric.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to a bunch of recent ones.</p>
<p>Einstein, Weinstein, Weinstein, Weinstein, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>I get them confused with the brother.</p>
<p>The brothers care about stuff, the brother&rsquo;s wives.</p>
<p>And a few others.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t ever listened to a full Joe Rogan episode.</p>
<p>But from what I&rsquo;ve seen with him,</p>
<p>he has a preternatural curiosity.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have passion.</p>
<p>There are a lot of podcasts that have passion.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve been on their show.</p>
<p>He has curiosity.</p>
<p>Like, he&rsquo;s not going to stop talking about something</p>
<p>until he hops it, until he understands it,</p>
<p>until he gets it viscerally.</p>
<p>And I respect that.</p>
<p>Because as I say in this more recent book,</p>
<p>passion&rsquo;s kind of like the dopamine hit</p>
<p>that gets you started, like, oh, I&rsquo;m going to be great.</p>
<p>Maybe I can win a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s not going to sustain you.</p>
<p>The sustenance comes from the passion</p>
<p>converting to curiosity.</p>
<p>And what I want to do is convert as many things as possible</p>
<p>to things that I can then.</p>
<p>Because actually, I&rsquo;ve had people that discuss addiction.</p>
<p>And there is an addictive quality to doing podcasts</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an addictive quality being a scientist.</p>
<p>And you get to do things that are very specialized</p>
<p>in specialized locations with special people,</p>
<p>paid for by other people who have no freaking idea what</p>
<p>you do.</p>
<p>I mean, imagine you worked in some job.</p>
<p>And Feynman said all these contradictory things.</p>
<p>Like, he said, if you can&rsquo;t explain it to your grandmother,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand it yourself.</p>
<p>Then the day you won the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>a reporter asked him, what did you win it for?</p>
<p>He said, if I could explain it to you, bud,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s leave aside his inherent contradictions.</p>
<p>But in reality, there is a kind of like dopamine rush</p>
<p>that you get from it.</p>
<p>But what is ultimately going to be the sustenance of it?</p>
<p>So yeah, I do feel like we have to find a way to nucleate that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, actually, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>can you turn someone into a scientist?</p>
<p>I used to ask this question all the time.</p>
<p>Can you make someone creative?</p>
<p>Can you teach someone to be creative?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Can you teach someone to be curious?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I do know that kids are naturally curious.</p>
<p>As they get older, they get less curious.</p>
<p>Just like I heard from the other forward author, James</p>
<p>Altucher, he said, once they did a study,</p>
<p>kids smile 300 times a day, or smile or laugh.</p>
<p>Adults, five or six.</p>
<p>Five or six.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m trying to get you to laugh, but you&rsquo;re not going to laugh.</p>
<p>But anyway, no, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Somewhere you lose 30% to 50%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entertained.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m an adult.</p>
<p>And then I do remember there&rsquo;s some distribution</p>
<p>in those studies with happier adults smile a little more,</p>
<p>but still the kids blow them out of the water.</p>
<p>Just crush it.</p>
<p>In other words, should we invest our energy</p>
<p>in getting the half life decay constant,</p>
<p>stretched out more for curiosity for kids?</p>
<p>Or should we try to reset the dopamine hit?</p>
<p>And then I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an open question.</p>
<p>Well, I think it goes to David Foster Wallace,</p>
<p>the key to life is to be unboreable.</p>
<p>I think you could train this kind of thing, which</p>
<p>is in every single situation, which I think is at the core,</p>
<p>at least this correlated with curiosity,</p>
<p>is in every situation, try to find the exciting,</p>
<p>the fascinating.</p>
<p>Like in every situation.</p>
<p>You sitting at the, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>waiting for something at a DMV or something like that.</p>
<p>Find something that excites you, like a thought.</p>
<p>Like watch people or start to think about, well,</p>
<p>I wonder how many people have to go to the DMV every day.</p>
<p>And then try to go into the pothead mode of thinking like,</p>
<p>wow, isn&rsquo;t this weird that there&rsquo;s a bunch of people</p>
<p>that are having to get a stamp of approval</p>
<p>from the government to drive their cars,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s millions of cars driving every day.</p>
<p>Or like, how can I do this better?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some blockchain and they could like VIN transfer.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, that is a good thing.</p>
<p>And then every situation, I think</p>
<p>if you rigorously just practice that at a young age,</p>
<p>I think you can learn to do that.</p>
<p>Because sometimes people ask me for advice</p>
<p>and to do this thing or that thing.</p>
<p>I think you, at the core, really have</p>
<p>to have this muscle of finding the awesomeness in everything.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re able to find the awesomeness</p>
<p>in everything, like whatever journey you take,</p>
<p>whatever weird meandering path that you take through life</p>
<p>is going to be productive, is going to end up in a great place.</p>
<p>So that muscle is at the core of it.</p>
<p>And I guess curiosity is central to that.</p>
<p>But you didn&rsquo;t win the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>The team of Bicep that led the Bicep 2</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t win the Nobel Prize because of some space dust.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like schmutz.</p>
<p>Which one is the moon?</p>
<p>Which one is?</p>
<p>That one&rsquo;s dust.</p>
<p>Space dust, yeah.</p>
<p>What are we looking at?</p>
<p>So why is space dust the villain of this whole story?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I wrote these books.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when you get all these books,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you get books, people sending books.</p>
<p>They always come in these dust jackets, right?</p>
<p>I was always like, what the hell is a dust jacket?</p>
<p>How much dust is raining down at any moment?</p>
<p>I mean, this is immaculate.</p>
<p>This room is Russian tidiness galore.</p>
<p>But in a normal household, how much dust is raining down?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really pretty until I wrote a book.</p>
<p>And I realized I&rsquo;m writing a story about the origin</p>
<p>of the universe, the prologue to the cosmos.</p>
<p>And dust is going to cover this story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually more a story about astrophysics and cosmology</p>
<p>than dust.</p>
<p>And this is the link between the cosmological and the</p>
<p>astrophysical.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>So astrophysics is, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>the study of physical phenomena manifest in the heavens,</p>
<p>astronomical phenomena.</p>
<p>Cosmology is concerned with the origin, evolution,</p>
<p>composition of the universe as a whole.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not really concerned with stars, galaxies,</p>
<p>and planets per se, other than how they might help us measure</p>
<p>the Hubble constant, the density of the universe,</p>
<p>the neutrino content, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So we have a tendency to kind of look a little bit,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re like, not all astronomers</p>
<p>and astrophysicists are equal.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all equal, but some are more equal than others.</p>
<p>So we have kind of a prejudice, a little swagger, right?</p>
<p>And cosmologists are studying, you know, we&rsquo;re using Einstein.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not using, like, you know, Boltzmann.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thinking of the biggest possible pictures.</p>
<p>In so doing, you can actually become</p>
<p>blinded to otherwise obvious effects</p>
<p>that people would have not overlooked.</p>
<p>In our case, when we sought out the signal,</p>
<p>we were using the photons that make up this primordial heat</p>
<p>bath that surrounds the universe,</p>
<p>luckily only at three degrees Kelvin approximately.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using those as a type of film</p>
<p>onto which gravitational waves will reverberate it,</p>
<p>make them oscillate preferentially</p>
<p>in a polarized way.</p>
<p>And then we can use our polarized sunglasses,</p>
<p>but in a microwave format, to detect</p>
<p>the characteristic twofold symmetry</p>
<p>pattern of underrotation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the technical way that we undergo it.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot more to it.</p>
<p>But there are more than one thing</p>
<p>that can mimic exactly that signal.</p>
<p>First of all, when you look at the signal,</p>
<p>the signal if inflation took place, big if,</p>
<p>but if it took place, the signal would</p>
<p>be about one or two parts per billion of the CMB temperature</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>So a few nanokelvin.</p>
<p>The CMB is a few kelvin.</p>
<p>The signal from these B modes would be a few nanokelvin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s astonishing to think.</p>
<p>Penzias and Wilson, 1965, measured</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s a billion times brighter.</p>
<p>And that was what, 60 years ago?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it 60 years ago, since they discovered it.</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s law, you&rsquo;re more expert now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it every two years.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about like 2 to the 30th power doubling</p>
<p>or something like that at that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it 2 to the 20th, something like that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like only 2 to the 10th is 1,000.</p>
<p>Correct my math, I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>2 to the 20th is a million.</p>
<p>2 to the 30th is a billion.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re outpacing Moore&rsquo;s law in terms</p>
<p>of the sensitivity of our instruments</p>
<p>to detect these feeble signals from the cosmos.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t have to deal with,</p>
<p>in the semiconductor factory in Santa Clara, California,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to deal with meteorites and things</p>
<p>like coming into the laboratory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clean room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pristine.</p>
<p>They can control everything about it.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t control the cosmos.</p>
<p>And the cosmos is literally littered</p>
<p>with particles of schmutz, of failed planets, asteroids,</p>
<p>meteoroids, things that didn&rsquo;t coalesce</p>
<p>to make either the Earth, the moon, the planet Jupiter,</p>
<p>or its moons, or get sucked into them</p>
<p>and make craters on them, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>The rest of it is falling, and it comes in a power spectrum.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few, thank god, Chicxulub sized impact</p>
<p>or progenitors that will take out all life on Earth.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s extremely large number</p>
<p>of tiny dust particles and microscopic grains.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a fair number of intermediate sized</p>
<p>particles.</p>
<p>And it turns out this little guy here</p>
<p>is the end product of a collapsing star that</p>
<p>explodes in what&rsquo;s called a supernova, type II supernova.</p>
<p>So stars spend most of their life</p>
<p>using helium nuclei protons and neutrons into helium nuclei.</p>
<p>And then from there, it can make other things like beryllium</p>
<p>and briefly make beryllium and carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,</p>
<p>all the way up until it tries to make iron and nickel.</p>
<p>And iron and nickel are endothermic.</p>
<p>It takes more energy than gets liberated</p>
<p>to make an atom of iron.</p>
<p>When that happens, there&rsquo;s no longer enough heat supplying</p>
<p>pressure to resist the gravitational collapse</p>
<p>of the material that was produced earlier.</p>
<p>So the star forms and goes inside out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how scientists discovered helium</p>
<p>was discovered on the sun.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Did you know?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called helium.</p>
<p>Yeah, they went there at night.</p>
<p>And they went there at night.</p>
<p>No, helium means Helios is the god of the sun.</p>
<p>It was discovered in its spectrum from observations</p>
<p>of the telescope like 150 years ago.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t discovered like when oxygen and iron was discovered.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only a relatively recent comer to the pure activity.</p>
<p>So helium came after oxygen.</p>
<p>Oh, no, first hydrogen forms into helium.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing that formed.</p>
<p>No, in terms of discoveries.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, after oxygen.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Priestley and others, Dalton,</p>
<p>discovered it in the 1700s.</p>
<p>No, helium was really only discovered</p>
<p>from the spectrum of looking at the sun</p>
<p>and seeing the weird atomic absorption called Fraunhofer</p>
<p>lines in the solar spectrum.</p>
<p>But when it tries to make iron, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no longer any leftover heat.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s heat left over from fusing,</p>
<p>as you know, the son of a plasma physicist.</p>
<p>You fuse to a hydrogen nuclei, you get excess energy,</p>
<p>plus you get helium.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why fusion energy could</p>
<p>be the energy source of the future and always will be.</p>
<p>No, no, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it&rsquo;ll come much sooner than that.</p>
<p>In so doing, trying to make iron, it takes more energy,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give off enough energy, star collapses, explodes.</p>
<p>And what does it spray out into the cosmic interstellar medium?</p>
<p>It sprays out the last thing it made, which is that stuff.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, because some of that</p>
<p>coalesced and made the core of the Earth,</p>
<p>onto which the lighter, like silica and carbon and the dirt</p>
<p>and the crust of the Earth were formed.</p>
<p>And some of that made its way to the crust.</p>
<p>The iron made its way to the crust.</p>
<p>Some of that your mother ate and synthesized</p>
<p>hemoglobin molecules.</p>
<p>And hemoglobin has iron particles in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quite amazing substance.</p>
<p>Without it, we wouldn&rsquo;t have our red blood.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t exist as we are.</p>
<p>Is this a very long, complicated mom joke?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done enough dad jokes.</p>
<p>My quota&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>So taking this object seriously, not all of it</p>
<p>gets bound up in a planet.</p>
<p>In fact, forming planets is very inefficient.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of schmutz left over,</p>
<p>some of which gets in the way of our telescopes looking back</p>
<p>to the beginning of time.</p>
<p>And some of those molecules, like iron,</p>
<p>is used in compass needles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re magnetized.</p>
<p>And magnetic fields in our galaxy</p>
<p>can align them and make the exact polarization pattern</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re looking for, as if the compass needles get</p>
<p>all aligned.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the polarization of the dust grain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that polarizing filter.</p>
<p>That means light polarized like this will get absorbed.</p>
<p>And light polarized like this will go through.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s absorbing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making 100% polarized light out</p>
<p>of an initially unpolarized light source.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>And what we ended up claiming on March 17, and I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>if you were there, you might remember this.</p>
<p>At the Harvard Center for Astrophysics,</p>
<p>there was an announcement.</p>
<p>There were like three or four Nobel Prize winners</p>
<p>in the audience.</p>
<p>And the BICEP2 team, which I was no longer leading,</p>
<p>I was still a member of it.</p>
<p>In fact, in the announcement, the first person they mentioned,</p>
<p>besides thank you all for being here,</p>
<p>is me and my team at UC San Diego.</p>
<p>Although I wasn&rsquo;t invited to go to the press conference</p>
<p>because that was very complicated.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little school up there in the Cambridge area.</p>
<p>And so they ended up making this announcement</p>
<p>that we had discovered the aftershocks of inflation.</p>
<p>We detected the gravitational waves shaking up the CMB.</p>
<p>And on that day, past Lex Friedman&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>back when it was called Artificial Intelligence,</p>
<p>Max Tegmark said, goodbye, universe.</p>
<p>Hello, multiverse.</p>
<p>And hello, Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>He saw that as confirmatory evidence, not only of inflation,</p>
<p>not only of gravitational waves, but of the multiverse.</p>
<p>Goodbye, universe.</p>
<p>Hello, multiverse.</p>
<p>Multiverse is a natural consequence.</p>
<p>Consequence of inflation, yes.</p>
<p>According to its prominent supporters, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and of course, leave the poetry to Max,</p>
<p>which he does masterfully.</p>
<p>OK, so the excitement was there.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe the initial heartbreak for you</p>
<p>was there, too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some of the darker moments you&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>But broadly, for the space of science,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s excitement there.</p>
<p>Huge excitement.</p>
<p>And I often note that this is a problem in what I call</p>
<p>the science media complex.</p>
<p>Because oftentimes, you&rsquo;ll see things like past guess</p>
<p>Sarah Seager, Venus life exist.</p>
<p>And that will be really, I mean, it&rsquo;s fascinating, right,</p>
<p>with the work that she&rsquo;s doing or her colleagues are doing,</p>
<p>Clara, who&rsquo;s on your show as well.</p>
<p>And that will be on front page, New York Times, Boston</p>
<p>Globe, San Diego Union Tribune.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be above the fold.</p>
<p>Make headlines around the world.</p>
<p>And then six months, 12 months later, as is the case for us,</p>
<p>retraction.</p>
<p>Page C17 of the Saturday edition that nobody reads</p>
<p>and underneath the personal.</p>
<p>So we have a problem in science, that if it explodes, it leads.</p>
<p>And we get this huge fanfare.</p>
<p>And this is not unique to my experiment.</p>
<p>This happened with the earlier discovery</p>
<p>of so called Martian life discovered</p>
<p>in Antarctica, which was announced after peer review.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t peer reviewed at the point</p>
<p>when we made the announcement.</p>
<p>We had a press conference.</p>
<p>And there are other reasons that the team leaders felt</p>
<p>it was important to do that so that we don&rsquo;t get scooped</p>
<p>by a referee who&rsquo;s unethical.</p>
<p>We thought we had done everything right,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s confirmation bias.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s levels to this.</p>
<p>Yeah, there were many levels.</p>
<p>And there were people, me warning</p>
<p>about how it would be interpreted</p>
<p>and wanting to also make sure that we put all the data out,</p>
<p>including the maps, which we still haven&rsquo;t released.</p>
<p>And so there were a lot of reasons to be skeptical.</p>
<p>But the public never knows this.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve made a rule that if I am ever</p>
<p>in charge of doling out large amounts of science funding,</p>
<p>that you should keep kind of an option.</p>
<p>In other words, you should have money for publicity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Have money for your press conference.</p>
<p>But hold in reserve in a bond to be used, hopefully never,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s to be used, an equal fund for the retraction,</p>
<p>if it should occur.</p>
<p>So you would like to see,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a big part of transparency, is the&hellip;</p>
<p>To me, in the space of science at least,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as beautiful, because it reveals the&hellip;</p>
<p>It tells a great story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an excitement, there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Humanity.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a climax to the triumph,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a climax to the disappointment at the end.</p>
<p>Because that also eventually leads to triumph again.</p>
<p>That sets up, that&rsquo;s the drama that sets up the triumph.</p>
<p>Like with Andrew Wiles performing Fermat&rsquo;s theorem,</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s not the last thing, whatever.</p>
<p>Like the ups and downs of that, the rollercoaster,</p>
<p>the whole thing should be documented.</p>
<p>That is science.</p>
<p>And when we don&rsquo;t do that, then we cultivate this aura</p>
<p>that excludes other scientists.</p>
<p>Often from minorities or women,</p>
<p>that you have to be Einstein.</p>
<p>Like Einstein came out of the womb,</p>
<p>and he was just like this guy with like curly&hellip;</p>
<p>No, he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t bad at math.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all nonsense.</p>
<p>But he said that he&hellip;</p>
<p>You know what he said he attributed his success to, Lex?</p>
<p>He said, I never asked my dad what happened</p>
<p>when I ran alongside a light beam as a kid.</p>
<p>And thank God I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Because had I?</p>
<p>He would have told me the best answer of the day,</p>
<p>which by the way, he would create 20 years later</p>
<p>as a 26 year old in the patent office,</p>
<p>obviously in Switzerland.</p>
<p>And in so doing, by delaying when he asked these questions,</p>
<p>he said, I approached it with the intellect</p>
<p>of a mature scientist, not a little kid.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t have accepted the same explanation.</p>
<p>So sometimes assuming that scientists are infallible,</p>
<p>inevitable, omniscient being,</p>
<p>I think that really does a disservice.</p>
<p>And Jim Gates said, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Einstein wasn&rsquo;t always Einstein.</p>
<p>And we cultivate this mystery and allure at our peril</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re humans until we have artificial Einstein,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think will ever exist.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve launched the assay or project</p>
<p>where you hope to assess theories</p>
<p>of everything with experiments.</p>
<p>You have a YouTube video where you were announcing that.</p>
<p>That looks super cool.</p>
<p>Can you describe this project?</p>
<p>And you also mentioned kind of,</p>
<p>you give a shout out to a little known fellow</p>
<p>by the name of Galileo Galilei</p>
<p>as an inspiration to this project.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Galileo is kind of my avatar,</p>
<p>my hero, the kind of all around scientist</p>
<p>that I would love to approach the logarithm of Galileo.</p>
<p>He was not only a phenomenal scientist,</p>
<p>he was an incredible artist, a writer, a poet,</p>
<p>a philosopher, and back then they didn&rsquo;t have distinctions</p>
<p>between a scientist and a physician,</p>
<p>was like a physicist.</p>
<p>And he would indulge kind of these really</p>
<p>intellectual flights of fancy,</p>
<p>thinking about phenomena such as the Earth&rsquo;s tides</p>
<p>or the composition of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting about Galileo</p>
<p>is that he was almost as wrong often as he was right.</p>
<p>And Galileo was not alone like this.</p>
<p>I always say like Einstein had at least seven Nobel prizes</p>
<p>that he could have won for discoveries</p>
<p>that later became true,</p>
<p>but he also had seven huge impossible to believe blunders</p>
<p>in some sense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too bad,</p>
<p>because he could have had a good career as I would say.</p>
<p>And Galileo was like that too.</p>
<p>In other words, he would fall victim</p>
<p>to I think this confirmation bias</p>
<p>that all scientists have to guard their lives against,</p>
<p>their careers, their brands, their reputations against,</p>
<p>which is the exclusion of evidence that doesn&rsquo;t conform</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re trying to prove for one reason or another,</p>
<p>or the radical acceptance of things</p>
<p>that do comport with it in order to bolster your confidence.</p>
<p>And both are equally intoxicating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a confirmation bias is a hell of a drug</p>
<p>because it really reinforces this notion,</p>
<p>which is partially sunk cost.</p>
<p>You put so much time, effort, money, reputation into it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna be wrong and go back on it.</p>
<p>And with Galileo, he would be incredibly perceptive</p>
<p>about things such as the Earth being not located</p>
<p>at the center of the solar system</p>
<p>and the sun being the center,</p>
<p>the so called Copernican hypothesis.</p>
<p>And he would use as evidence very, very interesting ideas</p>
<p>that all of which were wrong, basically.</p>
<p>And in fact, we weren&rsquo;t able to prove</p>
<p>that the Earth orbited around the sun.</p>
<p>And I ask you, can you prove the Earth is not flat?</p>
<p>No, well, you&rsquo;re a flat earther anyway.</p>
<p>But I ask my practice.</p>
<p>Proud Flat Earth Society member,</p>
<p>T shirts coming out soon.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stream it.com.</p>
<p>Merch.</p>
<p>Last merch.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually not trivial to do that.</p>
<p>But most of my students, graduate students</p>
<p>can prove that the Earth is round</p>
<p>or explain how the Earth.</p>
<p>It is actually not trivial to do though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And much harder is to prove</p>
<p>that the Earth goes around the sun.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s extremely hard to prove.</p>
<p>And almost none of my students,</p>
<p>even after they get their PhD and the final exam,</p>
<p>I kinda like to just give them a little bit of humility.</p>
<p>Cause I think to be a good scientist,</p>
<p>you need to be humble.</p>
<p>You need to have a little humility</p>
<p>and you need to have swagger.</p>
<p>You need to feel like a little cocky.</p>
<p>Like I could do this.</p>
<p>I can do this thing that Einstein by definition couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna attempt it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna attempt to do what was impossible</p>
<p>just a generation ago.</p>
<p>How do you prove that the Earth goes around the sun?</p>
<p>Do you have to, is it by the motion of other planets?</p>
<p>So there are many ways to do it.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously you could take a spaceship,</p>
<p>park it at the North celestial pole of our solar system</p>
<p>and just watch what happens.</p>
<p>But obviously that wasn&rsquo;t how it was discovered</p>
<p>in the late 1700s.</p>
<p>So it was called aberration.</p>
<p>So if you look at stars,</p>
<p>as the Earth orbits around the sun,</p>
<p>the position of the stars will shift slightly</p>
<p>because of the tilt of the Earth</p>
<p>and because the Earth is in motion around the Earth</p>
<p>and around the sun.</p>
<p>And because the Earth has a non trivial amount of velocity</p>
<p>compared to the speed of light in its orbit around the sun,</p>
<p>the stars will trace out little tiny ellipses</p>
<p>and those will correspond to the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re moving around.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re infinite distance,</p>
<p>which we assume that they are, they&rsquo;re not really,</p>
<p>but for all intents and purposes</p>
<p>in the scale of the solar system, they&rsquo;re infinitely far away.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s called stellar aberration.</p>
<p>And that was the first way it was discovered.</p>
<p>And actually we still use that.</p>
<p>We have to correct for that effect</p>
<p>when we measure the cosmic microwave background.</p>
<p>Because imagine you&rsquo;re inside of an oven,</p>
<p>it has some temperature three Kelvin</p>
<p>and a thousand Kelvin whenever.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re moving towards you,</p>
<p>the photons that are coming to me in that direction</p>
<p>will be blue shifted hotter</p>
<p>and the ones behind me will be red shifted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll artificially impute a greater or lesser amount</p>
<p>of matter or energy where you are</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an extension of the Doppler effect.</p>
<p>So we actually make use of that</p>
<p>and construct what&rsquo;s called like a local standard of rest.</p>
<p>Anyway, so you can do it.</p>
<p>But Galileo said, no, no, no,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna wait for that.</p>
<p>I have other proofs for it.</p>
<p>One of which is that the earth has tides</p>
<p>and the tides come in and out twice a day,</p>
<p>high tide and low tide.</p>
<p>And he made the analogy,</p>
<p>because the earth is moving around the sun,</p>
<p>say this is the sun here,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s moving around the sun,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also rotating on its axis.</p>
<p>See how the water is sloshing up and down</p>
<p>inside the vodka bottle?</p>
<p>As that happens, he said,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the tides are caused by.</p>
<p>Totally wrong.</p>
<p>Most people listen to this podcast.</p>
<p>Just so you know, if you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>he actually has a bottle of vodka in his hand.</p>
<p>Half drunk.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re both drunk and whatever else is possible.</p>
<p>So as it sloshed around,</p>
<p>he claimed that was what,</p>
<p>no, it has nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>The moon, over there,</p>
<p>the moon pulls differentially</p>
<p>on the earth and the earth&rsquo;s ocean.</p>
<p>That causes the oceans to bulge slightly</p>
<p>towards and away from where the moon is.</p>
<p>And the moon is actually the source of the earth&rsquo;s tides.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with Copernicus,</p>
<p>the orbit of the sun.</p>
<p>So he was totally wrong about that.</p>
<p>He also thought that the Milky Way</p>
<p>was comprised only of stars,</p>
<p>when we know it&rsquo;s made of gas, dust,</p>
<p>nebulae, and things like that.</p>
<p>So he had his fair share of blunders.</p>
<p>Now, one thing I always kind of make note of,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m actually producing along with Jim Gates,</p>
<p>Fabiola Gianatti, Frank Wilczek,</p>
<p>and Carlo Ravelli,</p>
<p>and my friend Lucio Piccirillo,</p>
<p>the first ever audio book of Galileo&rsquo;s dialogue,</p>
<p>the one where he claimed to find evidence</p>
<p>for the orbit of the earth around the sun,</p>
<p>but it was an error.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re reading parts of this text.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a brilliant book.</p>
<p>So this book was written in 1632.</p>
<p>It was written, and it was the one</p>
<p>that caused him to go into house arrest</p>
<p>and almost threatened to be tortured.</p>
<p>And that book laid out his arguments</p>
<p>for what was called the Copernican</p>
<p>or the nonparapathetic Aristotelian, et cetera,</p>
<p>notion of the planetary dynamic.</p>
<p>And eventually he was forced to recant</p>
<p>that he believed in it,</p>
<p>and allegedly he said he still believes the earth moves.</p>
<p>Anyway, so we&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s written in the form of a trilogue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually called the dialogue with his three people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one named Salviati,</p>
<p>who was espousing Galileo&rsquo;s notions</p>
<p>about how the heavens were orchestrated.</p>
<p>And Salviati means like the salvation, the savior.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a middleman, Segredo.</p>
<p>So Carlo Rovelli is playing Salviati, brilliant one.</p>
<p>I am playing Segredo,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like an intelligent interlocutor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of just, I can appreciate Aristotle,</p>
<p>I can appreciate Copernicus.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s this guy, Simplicio, the simpleton,</p>
<p>and he espouses the words of the Pope.</p>
<p>So you can imagine like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working in Putin&rsquo;s government</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re working in whatever,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you&rsquo;re kind of putting the words</p>
<p>of like the fool, literally calling the fool,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re using the words</p>
<p>of the all supreme powerful being on earth at that time</p>
<p>was the Vatican church,</p>
<p>especially for an Italian like Galileo.</p>
<p>So he wasn&rsquo;t as brilliant politically</p>
<p>as he was astrophysically and otherwise.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s doing Simplicio?</p>
<p>Simplicio is a friend of mine in University of Manchester</p>
<p>named Lucio Picciarello.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an Irish guy, but he has an Italian,</p>
<p>no, no, he&rsquo;s a full blooded Italian.</p>
<p>They all speak English and Italian, I only speak,</p>
<p>and the four words are written by,</p>
<p>so one four word in this place has three four words,</p>
<p>which is like a 12 word.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The four words are written by.</p>
<p>Can you explain that joke for me?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was a good one.</p>
<p>The four word, three four words.</p>
<p>One of them is written by Albert Einstein</p>
<p>in which he says Galileo was not only</p>
<p>one of the greatest scientists in history,</p>
<p>this is Einstein telling Galileo,</p>
<p>but he was one of the greatest writers</p>
<p>and minds of all of human history.</p>
<p>That four word is read by Frank Wilczek, who you&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>Jim Gates, who you&rsquo;ve also had,</p>
<p>he reads the translation, the translator,</p>
<p>Stillman Drake, who&rsquo;s a renowned scientific translator.</p>
<p>And then Fabiola Giannati,</p>
<p>she reads the introduction and dedication</p>
<p>from Galileo to the Duke of Tuscany</p>
<p>and some of the different introductions</p>
<p>that Galileo himself had.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s such a thrill to be able to do it.</p>
<p>I only randomly found out,</p>
<p>cause I wanted to study it and it&rsquo;s like 500 pages long.</p>
<p>And I was like, let me get the audio book</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m an audio medium kind of guy, didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>So I said, let&rsquo;s do it ourselves.</p>
<p>And so we did it and hopefully it&rsquo;ll be out</p>
<p>on Galileo&rsquo;s birthday, which is February 15th, 2022.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a ripe 457,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the only one of his books.</p>
<p>Galileo wrote many books,</p>
<p>one of which is called the Military Compass.</p>
<p>And this is an interesting book for my blockchain</p>
<p>and your blockchain aficionados.</p>
<p>In this book, he talks about a compass,</p>
<p>which is not a magnetic compass,</p>
<p>but an actual like slide roll.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a slide roll.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a manual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, imagine if your phone came with a manual,</p>
<p>nowadays they don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>But this was a manual for how to use this slide roll,</p>
<p>which is like enormously important.</p>
<p>And he gives a whole bunch of worked examples.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant book.</p>
<p>One of the examples is how do you convert money?</p>
<p>So he does a currency conversion</p>
<p>between Ducati and Florentine Ducati</p>
<p>and Scuti and whatever, you know, lira, whatever.</p>
<p>He does all these currency conversions.</p>
<p>One copy of this book, or maybe two exist,</p>
<p>first printings from 1600 still exist.</p>
<p>If Galileo had just kept those in his family,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re worth a hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>Nowadays, you can&rsquo;t get a Scuti.</p>
<p>A Scuti is worth nothing.</p>
<p>Like a Ducati is worth nothing.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe some collector wants a piece of paper, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lesson.</p>
<p>Like there are value in physical, you know,</p>
<p>nonfungible tokens, this original nonfungible token.</p>
<p>But then a third book is called the assayer.</p>
<p>So what is an assayer?</p>
<p>So assayers were kind of like these alchemists, you know,</p>
<p>physicists, chemists that would be around a court.</p>
<p>And every so often for the treasurer,</p>
<p>they would want to accept pieces of gold from the citizens</p>
<p>and convert that to script or, you know, paper money.</p>
<p>And to do that, they needed someone</p>
<p>to verify with a standard of gold</p>
<p>that they knew to be gold and do some kind</p>
<p>of semi non destructive evaluation</p>
<p>of the purported object, the metal that</p>
<p>was supposed to be gold.</p>
<p>So they would take these pieces of gold, theoretically gold,</p>
<p>and they would rub it on something called a touchstone.</p>
<p>Touchstone was a special piece of rock, granite, whatever.</p>
<p>It has no intrinsic value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a piece of rock.</p>
<p>But with that rock, you could assay and determine</p>
<p>the content of this thing that could be worth, you know,</p>
<p>millions of lira or whatever, right?</p>
<p>So it was an incredibly important job.</p>
<p>And so this person would take this piece of inanimate rock</p>
<p>and use it to do something valuable.</p>
<p>What I want to do in the Assayer Project</p>
<p>is take this plethora of physical theories</p>
<p>of everything.</p>
<p>I said recently, you know, we should give a Nobel Prize</p>
<p>to someone who doesn&rsquo;t come up with a theory of everything.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s just rotten with them.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You know, I often say that theory is kind of like software.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not denigrating software at all.</p>
<p>But like, you can create a lot of software.</p>
<p>You can make a quine, and it&rsquo;ll make its own quine.</p>
<p>And you can make infinite amounts of software.</p>
<p>Look it up, kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of my favorite videos.</p>
<p>And you can replicate.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t replicate.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make a telescope that makes a telescope that</p>
<p>makes a telescope.</p>
<p>In other words, hardware&rsquo;s kind of like the nonfungible token</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the ultimate minted, limited edition, the book,</p>
<p>the compass book, like I talk.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very expensive.</p>
<p>That means you have to be very careful before you invest</p>
<p>decades, billions, and humans into pursuing</p>
<p>one of these theories of everything.</p>
<p>You have to have good intuition for it.</p>
<p>And lately, what I&rsquo;ve seen is not predictions,</p>
<p>but retrodictions.</p>
<p>So you see that the Large Hadron Collider will come out</p>
<p>with a measurement.</p>
<p>And then so and so will say, oh, this</p>
<p>is compatible with string theory.</p>
<p>Or g minus 2 of the muon, it has these bizarre properties.</p>
<p>Fifth force, string theory predicts this.</p>
<p>String theory solves this.</p>
<p>Neutrinos, sterile neutrinos, Large Hadron Collider bottom</p>
<p>or B experiment, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say that it&rsquo;s compatible after the fact.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not so bad, right?</p>
<p>Because what did Einstein do with GR, general relativity?</p>
<p>The first thing he did was not predict something new.</p>
<p>He looked at the anomalous behavior</p>
<p>of the planet Mercury.</p>
<p>And he saw it was behaving strangely.</p>
<p>And people had said, oh, that&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s another planet</p>
<p>hiding behind the sun that we can&rsquo;t see that perturbs</p>
<p>the orbit of the planet Mercury.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Vulcan.</p>
<p>That was one approach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like the dark matter approach,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a clump of matter</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t see that&rsquo;s influencing the planet that we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>And we use that to divine and intuit the existence</p>
<p>of the other planet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually how Neptune was discovered.</p>
<p>Neptune was discovered because of the anomalous behavior</p>
<p>of the planet Uranus.</p>
<p>So Neptune was dark.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>It was tugging on Uranus in a certain way.</p>
<p>And that led to Le Verrier discovering the planet,</p>
<p>predicting where this planet should be found.</p>
<p>So it had a good heritage in physics</p>
<p>to predict this planet that you couldn&rsquo;t see that worked.</p>
<p>But Einstein said, no, it&rsquo;s caused</p>
<p>by the warping and bending of spacetime</p>
<p>due to the presence of matter, who will later become known</p>
<p>as the Einstein equations.</p>
<p>So he explained why Mercury did that.</p>
<p>And it was known since the time of Newton</p>
<p>that Mercury was behaving in this really freaky way.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t predict it.</p>
<p>He retradicted it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But at some point, you should come up</p>
<p>with something new that&rsquo;s uniquely</p>
<p>predictive of your theory, as I just said.</p>
<p>The theory of dark matter in the context of Neptune</p>
<p>is actually a valid theory.</p>
<p>It just happens not to make sense</p>
<p>in the context of Vulcan.</p>
<p>And so if he had kept doing that,</p>
<p>maybe perhaps he wouldn&rsquo;t have come up</p>
<p>with these other predictions that he would later reject.</p>
<p>He rejected the existence of gravitational waves.</p>
<p>You and Barry talked about that.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t actually believe it.</p>
<p>It was the one peer reviewed paper that he had.</p>
<p>He used to send back in those days.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d send a letter to Nature, physical review,</p>
<p>publish this, and know how much it cost.</p>
<p>And he got it rejected,</p>
<p>because he said you can&rsquo;t detect gravitational waves.</p>
<p>And actually, or they&rsquo;re not real.</p>
<p>And the guy showed that they&rsquo;re real,</p>
<p>because he corrected a math error</p>
<p>in Einstein and Rosen&rsquo;s paper.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>What should the assayer do?</p>
<p>He or she should look at these theories,</p>
<p>look what things they explain that already exist,</p>
<p>and look at what new predictions they can claim to explain</p>
<p>if we can build experiments to test them.</p>
<p>So you have to kind of challenge yourself</p>
<p>to think about what kind of predictions</p>
<p>can they make such that we can construct experiments?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like ultimately back going to the signal,</p>
<p>to the experimenter&rsquo;s theorist, essentially.</p>
<p>So like very experiment centric exploration</p>
<p>of the fundamental theory of everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And the best scientists, the best physicists,</p>
<p>were both experimentalists and theorists.</p>
<p>Or at least if they were experimentalists,</p>
<p>they understood the theory well enough to make predictions</p>
<p>or to explore the predictions</p>
<p>and the consequences of those predictions.</p>
<p>Or if they were theorists, they were like Galileo.</p>
<p>Like Einstein has patents for things that he invented.</p>
<p>And then some of his work led to the laser and the maser.</p>
<p>So he had practically, it wasn&rsquo;t just pure airy fairy,</p>
<p>quantum reality and expanding universe.</p>
<p>So in this case, what I wanna do is look at,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 10 different theories of everything</p>
<p>or cosmological models.</p>
<p>They make predictions, they have advantages</p>
<p>and disadvantages, and I&rsquo;m just asking the question,</p>
<p>why aren&rsquo;t we applying Bayesian reasoning</p>
<p>with confidence intervals?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have updates?</p>
<p>Every time an experiment comes out,</p>
<p>we can update our credulity in that experiment</p>
<p>or that theory rather,</p>
<p>based on the results of the experiment.</p>
<p>And we shouldn&rsquo;t do it after the fact,</p>
<p>or as Michio Kaku has said,</p>
<p>well, you have to tell me what the initial conditions are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not my job.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to tell me if string theory is correct,</p>
<p>what should it predict if it&rsquo;s true?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one big problem, which I should say,</p>
<p>that to be a good ass air,</p>
<p>I think you have to be worldly in the sense of,</p>
<p>worldly and curious, like we were talking about before</p>
<p>with you and Joe, and you can&rsquo;t only talk your own book.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t only understand your own pet theory of everything.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t only say, well, I only understand string theory</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have time for these other theories,</p>
<p>or as if it&rsquo;s beneath me to even go into Garrett Lisi</p>
<p>or Eric Weinstein or Stephen Wolfram</p>
<p>or aspects of M theory, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And there are some that say,</p>
<p>why do we give string theory so much of an advanced pass</p>
<p>when there are actually predictions that&rsquo;s made</p>
<p>that are completely anathema to what we observe in physics?</p>
<p>Like the dark energy should be negative</p>
<p>and we see it as positive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge strike.</p>
<p>If you told somebody, here&rsquo;s my tenure application</p>
<p>and what do you, oh, I&rsquo;ve made this pretty,</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t done by Maldacena and Whitten</p>
<p>and folks like that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it would have had the traction,</p>
<p>the endurance, the resiliency that it&rsquo;s had.</p>
<p>And that worries me because all these men and some women</p>
<p>are making these fantastic, brilliant, beautiful ideas</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not even looking at what their neighbor&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thing that I really enjoyed seeing</p>
<p>and that don&rsquo;t see often enough with these theories,</p>
<p>which is others who are also experts</p>
<p>kind of studying them sufficiently well</p>
<p>to steel man the theory,</p>
<p>to show the beautiful aspects of the theory.</p>
<p>I see that with Stephen Wolfram.</p>
<p>He has a very different sort of formulation of physics</p>
<p>with his physics project.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m, it&rsquo;s, physics is a foreign land to me,</p>
<p>but his formulation, especially in the context</p>
<p>of cellular automata or hypergraphs,</p>
<p>just as objects, as mathematical objects themselves</p>
<p>are familiar.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m able to see the real beauty there</p>
<p>and it saddens me that others in the physics community</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t also see the beauty.</p>
<p>Like give it a chance, give a chance to see the beauty.</p>
<p>And that.</p>
<p>Give it your respect.</p>
<p>So there is one person who does take time</p>
<p>and is what I consider to be a great scientist</p>
<p>in terms of what he thinks.</p>
<p>He obviously has invested interest in his own theory</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s Eric.</p>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s got a truly encyclopedic knowledge</p>
<p>of the history of physics.</p>
<p>And he has a great warmth and graciousness</p>
<p>when it comes to giving other,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve witnessed this and I&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>look, first of all, I think debate is pointless.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know about you, but if you&rsquo;ve ever voted like,</p>
<p>oh, I saw this debate and you know,</p>
<p>because Trump did so badly, now I&rsquo;m gonna vote for Biden.</p>
<p>No, never have.</p>
<p>You almost never change anybody&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>unless you debate with love.</p>
<p>Unless you have almost like we&rsquo;re gonna win together,</p>
<p>like the red team approach in the military,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to win a war.</p>
<p>So they may disagree on the tactics day to day,</p>
<p>but the strategy, we have to win this war.</p>
<p>I love you and I wanna protect you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see that in very many of these physicists from Kaku.</p>
<p>I almost see it, it&rsquo;s embarrassing in some ways</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll almost mock with the exception of Eric.</p>
<p>You know, Garrett&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You know, his theory is, you know,</p>
<p>people have a lot of issues, very technical,</p>
<p>but Eric has taken the time to try to understand it.</p>
<p>Eric has taken the time to understand Peter White&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see the same graciousness extended from them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say.</p>
<p>Yeah, essentially, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, with Eric, he hasn&rsquo;t, he wants to,</p>
<p>but he hasn&rsquo;t extended the same for Stephen Wolfram</p>
<p>because I think Wolf.</p>
<p>No, he did.</p>
<p>No, actually, no, he did.</p>
<p>I had a debate with them live on my show.</p>
<p>No, I did, I listened to it,</p>
<p>but I just think it&rsquo;s outside of the toolkit</p>
<p>that Eric is comfortable with.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but the main thing that&rsquo;s often absent</p>
<p>and Eric does have is the willingness</p>
<p>and not just dismissing or mocking that he&rsquo;s reaching out.</p>
<p>But okay.</p>
<p>I mean, what if it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>you know, I made a joke when they were on,</p>
<p>I was like, how many theories of everything can there be?</p>
<p>You know, Highlander, there can be only one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe.</p>
<p>But he, of course, also, like the other folks</p>
<p>who propose a theory, has an ego.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He rides a dragon with the dragon representing the ego.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about your friend, Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>So he proposed initial sketches of geometric unity,</p>
<p>which is his theory of everything.</p>
<p>Maybe you can elucidate some aspect of it</p>
<p>that you find interesting.</p>
<p>But what do you think about the response</p>
<p>he got from the scientific community?</p>
<p>Well, you know, some of the response came</p>
<p>from people, academicians, professors.</p>
<p>Some came from a lay audience</p>
<p>and some came from trained scientists</p>
<p>who are no longer, you know,</p>
<p>maybe practicing in the universities.</p>
<p>I thought it was, there was a lot of vitriol,</p>
<p>which surprised me because I look at what he&rsquo;s trying to do</p>
<p>and it was always, the vitriol would always come</p>
<p>with some element of ad hominem.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s his personality,</p>
<p>maybe that engenders this or whatever.</p>
<p>Maybe there is kind of just a natural tendency.</p>
<p>You know, I always get these emails,</p>
<p>Professor Keating, I have a new theory,</p>
<p>Einstein was wrong, I&rsquo;m gonna prove it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good at math, but if you help me,</p>
<p>I will share my Nobel Prize with you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, thanks, have you read my books?</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s always taking down the dragon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always taking down the Kung Fu master, right?</p>
<p>That you get the hit points from D&amp;D.</p>
<p>You get their hit points, you take their cards,</p>
<p>you get their risk tokens from Kamchaka.</p>
<p>And thinking about with Eric, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>because what he&rsquo;s doing is so aspirational,</p>
<p>it is grandiose in a good sense.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s trying to do is construct</p>
<p>a geometric theory of everything</p>
<p>that has aspects of supersymmetry</p>
<p>and stuff embedded in it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to meld that, it has very unusual features</p>
<p>and that it features not only multiple spatial dimensions,</p>
<p>multiple time dimensions,</p>
<p>it uses new mathematical objects that he&rsquo;s invented.</p>
<p>And look, I had him on my show, I&rsquo;ve talked with him.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had consultations with other physicists</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;ll come down and I have a visitor&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and he comes down to San Diego sometimes</p>
<p>and spends time there.</p>
<p>And we talk with eminent mathematicians and physicists.</p>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s been out of the academic world for a long time.</p>
<p>And there is, as I said before,</p>
<p>an aspect of persuasion that must take place</p>
<p>in order to get anything through.</p>
<p>And I think there was a slight amount of good nature,</p>
<p>not ignorance, naivete, but just the sense that</p>
<p>if this is right, everyone will recognize it.</p>
<p>If you build a better mousetrap,</p>
<p>the world will beat a path to your door</p>
<p>as the expression goes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s completely untrue.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t even happen with mousetraps.</p>
<p>I mean, you know how many fricking mousetrap types there are?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, they don&rsquo;t beat a path to your door.</p>
<p>You have to sell that fricking thing.</p>
<p>You have to sell it like Steve Jobs or Elon.</p>
<p>I have never, I&rsquo;ve had one paper out of 200 papers</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve published in peer reviewed journals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had one, half a percent,</p>
<p>published with no referees comments.</p>
<p>In other words, published like dream.</p>
<p>Submitted it, it happened to be in a prestigious journal.</p>
<p>Thought I was pretty psyched about that.</p>
<p>But you almost have to crave the response,</p>
<p>getting it back from a journal.</p>
<p>And I think he doesn&rsquo;t, first of all,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t subscribe to the peer review process.</p>
<p>He thinks that is anathema to the way science is,</p>
<p>invest interest in public, in journals, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>I think you can have elements of peer review</p>
<p>that are substantive and valuable.</p>
<p>I think you have to learn from your critics.</p>
<p>One of my conversations with John Mather,</p>
<p>he talks about loving your critics in this book,</p>
<p>but not being so open to their criticism</p>
<p>that their criticism goes to your heart</p>
<p>and not being so open to their compliments</p>
<p>that their compliments go to your head.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very tough Scylla and Charybdis to walk.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s something, I mean,</p>
<p>I wanna be careful here because I&rsquo;d like to talk to,</p>
<p>talk to Eric about this directly,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just, from a perspective of a friend,</p>
<p>wanna ask about the drug of fame.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also the public perception</p>
<p>of the battles of physics.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a very narrow community,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s the way that&rsquo;s perceived.</p>
<p>The exploration of ideas is perceived by the public.</p>
<p>And so there is a certain drug to the excitement</p>
<p>that the public can show when they sense</p>
<p>that you have something big.</p>
<p>And that in itself might become the thing</p>
<p>that gives you pleasure.</p>
<p>And I think that with theories of everything</p>
<p>or with any kind of super, super ambitious projects,</p>
<p>and this is taking us back to when you were ambitious</p>
<p>about trying to understand the origins of the universe,</p>
<p>if you convince yourself that you have an intuition</p>
<p>about the origins of the universe</p>
<p>and you have a platform like you do now</p>
<p>where you start to communicate your intuition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hazy, like all the science, you&rsquo;re still unsure,</p>
<p>but you have a sense, I mean, perhaps you don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>as much as an experimentalist</p>
<p>because you always kind of start going,</p>
<p>okay, how can I build a device to see through the fog?</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re more like a theoretician</p>
<p>who kind of works in the realm of ideas,</p>
<p>in the realm of intuitions,</p>
<p>it is also a source of pleasure.</p>
<p>You mentioned dopamine, a source of dopamine</p>
<p>that you can communicate to others</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really excited by the possibility</p>
<p>of solving the deepest mysteries of the universe.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some aspect to which you want to be</p>
<p>a Grigori Grisha Perlman and go into the hole</p>
<p>and get the work done and shut the hell up about the,</p>
<p>speaking about myself, about talking about the dream</p>
<p>and planning and exploring how great it will be</p>
<p>if my intuition turns out to be correct.</p>
<p>If the sketches I have turn out to actually build</p>
<p>the bridge that takes us to a whole new place,</p>
<p>as a friend of Eric&rsquo;s or a friend of,</p>
<p>or my friend, what kind of advice do you give?</p>
<p>What is your role?</p>
<p>Is it to be a supporter given that he has many critics</p>
<p>or is it to be in private a critic?</p>
<p>Like a lot of my friends will say,</p>
<p>hey, shut the hell up, just get it done.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I wanna ask you a question I&rsquo;ve asked him</p>
<p>and then it comes from Animal Farm by George.</p>
<p>Probably my favorite book, yeah.</p>
<p>So you remember Benjamin the donkey?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s talking to the pig.</p>
<p>I forget the pig&rsquo;s name, you probably know.</p>
<p>Anyway, the pig says to him,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this long, lustrous, beautiful tail.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so lucky.</p>
<p>I got the short, curly, little squiggly thing</p>
<p>that does jack squat.</p>
<p>Tell me, how does it feel to have such a lustrous tail?</p>
<p>And Benjamin says, well, the good Lord,</p>
<p>he gave me a tail to swat away the flies.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather not have the tail if I didn&rsquo;t have the flies.</p>
<p>So I wanna ask you, as I&rsquo;ve asked Eric, is it worth it?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got these beautiful tail,</p>
<p>but there are flies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying in a negative way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying you get unwanted distractions,</p>
<p>dopamine, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of the highlight,</p>
<p>the spotlight effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously allowing you to do things</p>
<p>that you could never do alone.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, first of all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to know how you answer that.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t feel I can relate to myself.</p>
<p>Well, this has to do with more like.</p>
<p>Platform.</p>
<p>Platform stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, scale.</p>
<p>Oh, I, that has no, very little effect on me.</p>
<p>I enjoy it.</p>
<p>I enjoy meeting new people,</p>
<p>but that has nothing to do with platform.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that has no effect on me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one somebody that enjoys the act itself.</p>
<p>So this conversation,</p>
<p>the reason I&rsquo;m doing this podcast with you today</p>
<p>is because that allows me to trick you</p>
<p>into talking to me for a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about platform.</p>
<p>I assume nobody listens.</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, I forgot it, right?</p>
<p>My whole test of it was a good podcast.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>Like podcast has been around what, 12 years?</p>
<p>How do we know as podcasters we&rsquo;re doing a good job?</p>
<p>Like sometimes someone will say,</p>
<p>that was the best interview I ever had,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t happen that often, at least for me.</p>
<p>But if you realize that you forgot to put the SD card</p>
<p>in that little guy and the Zoom didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>would you do it again?</p>
<p>And I think if you say yes to that,</p>
<p>that was a good podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>So in that space, yeah, all of it is worth it.</p>
<p>But the dream, I&rsquo;m more referring</p>
<p>to the psychological effects.</p>
<p>Forget the platform, forget all of that.</p>
<p>You know, maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t even brought up the platform</p>
<p>because it really has to do even in your own private mind,</p>
<p>which is what I&rsquo;m struggling with.</p>
<p>I enjoy the planning, the dreaming, the early stages</p>
<p>so much that I often don&rsquo;t take projects to completion.</p>
<p>This is a psychological effect</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sure basically everybody, every engineer,</p>
<p>everybody that does anything goes through.</p>
<p>I just, in this case particular, I think it also applies.</p>
<p>And I wonder as a friend, what is the role?</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, that effect has been documented,</p>
<p>everything from planning telescopes to dieting.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a tiny bit of dopamine that you get</p>
<p>visualizing how you&rsquo;re gonna feel.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know this, but you don&rsquo;t deal,</p>
<p>but losing five pounds.</p>
<p>I say, oh, I&rsquo;m gonna lose five pounds</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna be able to run a minute faster.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a part of me when I&rsquo;m planning the diet</p>
<p>and the meals and the exercise</p>
<p>that I get a little bit of that thrill</p>
<p>and that actually saps a little bit of my willpower</p>
<p>to actually complete the task that will take me to that goal.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a documented effect.</p>
<p>And that happens in project planning and project management.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, very important thing to guard against</p>
<p>as a manager of a big project.</p>
<p>With Eric, it&rsquo;s interesting because with him,</p>
<p>first of all, we relate extremely well</p>
<p>on a friendship level and very close.</p>
<p>He does remind me a lot of my father</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve told him that just as a mathematician,</p>
<p>as a big thinker, in his case, as a father,</p>
<p>the father kind of figure that I didn&rsquo;t have in a sense,</p>
<p>but that he is a true lover of life.</p>
<p>He knows he&rsquo;s got a huge platform.</p>
<p>He knows he gets a lot of attention for what he does.</p>
<p>And I jokingly say, well, it&rsquo;s one thing,</p>
<p>like how do you know, Lex, that someone&rsquo;s an expert?</p>
<p>Experts say.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good rule Ray Dalio writes about in principles.</p>
<p>He says, an expert is someone who&rsquo;s done something</p>
<p>three times successfully.</p>
<p>Like you can do something correctly once,</p>
<p>you could do something correctly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to pull off like three projects,</p>
<p>three telescopes, three whatever, right?</p>
<p>So look for, it&rsquo;s arbitrary, it could be four,</p>
<p>it could be two, right?</p>
<p>But the point is, look at Eric.</p>
<p>So how many things has he contributed to</p>
<p>and made pretty substantive kind of paradigm shifts</p>
<p>for different people?</p>
<p>I would say he&rsquo;s been right many times.</p>
<p>Does that mean he&rsquo;s infallible, that he&rsquo;s ineffable?</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>For me, so what I&rsquo;m saying is I get a little bit of the joy</p>
<p>of kind of learning something purely as a scientist,</p>
<p>something completely outside of what I do, mathematics,</p>
<p>gauge theory, the kind of very advanced geometry topology</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s interested in.</p>
<p>But every now and then, I will sneak in that I want,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve told him, I&rsquo;m gonna turn your son</p>
<p>into an experimentalist despite you.</p>
<p>You know, like he is not gonna be a theorist,</p>
<p>Zev is not gonna be a theorist.</p>
<p>He is working with me, he is learning from me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to get him into, he wants to bypass</p>
<p>all of the kind of nonsense of undergraduate</p>
<p>and go straight to graduate school.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve tried to encourage him</p>
<p>that maybe he could do it, maybe he can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no other way than to try.</p>
<p>And so I prepared a whole curriculum for Zev</p>
<p>to basically bypass all of undergraduate.</p>
<p>And to his credit, he&rsquo;s not earns all the credit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s learned it to a level</p>
<p>that matches many of my graduate students.</p>
<p>Okay, hold on a second.</p>
<p>I have to push back and this is me saying it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll talk to Eric about this.</p>
<p>But to say, you said Eric&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>was right on multiple things.</p>
<p>I think Eric has a great deep insight</p>
<p>about human nature and how societies work.</p>
<p>And he says a lot of wise words on that world.</p>
<p>But I think if we&rsquo;re talking about experts,</p>
<p>you kind of have to prove, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Michael Jordan playing baseball.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s proved it many times that he can play basketball,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also got to prove that he can play baseball.</p>
<p>And I would say the whole point of, I mean,</p>
<p>of radical ideas is you&rsquo;re not, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to be sitting on a track record of,</p>
<p>I mean, when you&rsquo;re swinging for the fences,</p>
<p>always there&rsquo;s not a track record to sit on.</p>
<p>And like Max Tegmark is an example of somebody</p>
<p>who has a huge track record of more like acceptable stuff,</p>
<p>but he also keeps swinging for the fences</p>
<p>in every other world.</p>
<p>So he has that track record.</p>
<p>With Eric, if you look at just the number of publications,</p>
<p>all this stuff, he chose not to travel the academic route.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no proof of expertise</p>
<p>except sort of an obvious linguistic demonstration</p>
<p>of brilliance, but that&rsquo;s not how physics works, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a polite way to damn somebody as a scientist</p>
<p>and say he or she, they really know</p>
<p>the history of physics very well.</p>
<p>Like physicists always love it.</p>
<p>Like Sean Carroll always jokes about like,</p>
<p>physicists should never talk about history of physics,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>So Eric has certainly contributed in finance specifically</p>
<p>and gauge theory and economics and inflation dynamics</p>
<p>and the non cosmological.</p>
<p>Hold on a second, that&rsquo;s yet to be proven.</p>
<p>He has a lot of powerful interests.</p>
<p>Calculate is calculus proven.</p>
<p>I mean, he has a gauge model for currency exchanges</p>
<p>between different nations that is explanatory.</p>
<p>Not, it&rsquo;s not, you know, is this something,</p>
<p>in other words, it&rsquo;s a model</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s used for pedagogical purposes.</p>
<p>And it might be, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unique to him.</p>
<p>I mean, to him and Pia.</p>
<p>Yes, it might be a powerful model.</p>
<p>It might be one that&rsquo;s actually deserves</p>
<p>a huge amount of applause and celebration,</p>
<p>but does not yet receive that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the things that Eric talks about.</p>
<p>It has not received the attention it deserves,</p>
<p>but it has not yet received the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>And so like the proven expertise thing,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that go to their grave</p>
<p>without the recognition they deserve and it&rsquo;s a tragedy.</p>
<p>But the fact is like, you know,</p>
<p>you have to fight for that recognition.</p>
<p>The tragedy happens for a reason.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say this person is obviously brilliant</p>
<p>and therefore they deserve the credit</p>
<p>in every single domain.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t like transfer immediately.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody that&rsquo;s, well, at least I wouldn&rsquo;t argue</p>
<p>Eric is one of the special minds in our generation,</p>
<p>but you still have to fight the fight of physics</p>
<p>and prove it within the community.</p>
<p>And I think the same applies in economics.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, I mean, as somebody that, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through the academic journey,</p>
<p>just like you said, the peer review,</p>
<p>all of those things, flawed as they are,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the part of the process.</p>
<p>You have to convince your peers,</p>
<p>the people that are as obsessed for whatever the hell reason</p>
<p>about that particular thing that you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s egos.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant mess.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful mess</p>
<p>through which you have to go through</p>
<p>in order to reveal the power of your idea</p>
<p>to yourself and to the world.</p>
<p>Well, let me use an example.</p>
<p>So, you know of James Clerk Maxwell</p>
<p>and he invented the laws of electromagnetism,</p>
<p>which is the first example of a unification principle</p>
<p>ever displayed by the human mind in history.</p>
<p>Purely mathematics, unifying completely disparate phenomena.</p>
<p>In one case, electricity, charges,</p>
<p>static electricity, lightning,</p>
<p>and the other magnets, bar magnets, currents, et cetera.</p>
<p>Unify them.</p>
<p>And you know what he did?</p>
<p>I like to do a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Imagine Twitter exists, 1864.</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s working away.</p>
<p>And he goes, I have this wonderful idea</p>
<p>with fluxions and inductive virtue and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And it revolves on this thing called an ether.</p>
<p>And by the way, there are these little vortices and gears</p>
<p>and the gears have these planetary things</p>
<p>and they suck up vortices and the vortices determine</p>
<p>the density of the electromagnetic potential.</p>
<p>You feel like this guy&rsquo;s a fricking moron.</p>
<p>And what would you do?</p>
<p>Come on, honestly, you would say</p>
<p>everything this guy does is wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s got this idiotic idea</p>
<p>and it would be falsified a couple of decades later</p>
<p>by Michelson and Morley.</p>
<p>And in so doing, you would have thrown out</p>
<p>a very beautiful baby with bathwater.</p>
<p>Imagine Twitter, imagine the twit storm,</p>
<p>clerk Maxwell, at clerk Maxwell one would get.</p>
<p>It would be brutal, right?</p>
<p>And to the detriment.</p>
<p>And that might even set back history.</p>
<p>Imagine Yang Mills doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Chairman Simons.</p>
<p>All these things are very fantastic.</p>
<p>But why Lex?</p>
<p>Why does Ed Witten, why does Juan Maldacena?</p>
<p>Let me give a good example.</p>
<p>Juan, brilliant guy, I love him.</p>
<p>He is the reason that Stephen Hawking conceded</p>
<p>his black hole information paradox loss issue.</p>
<p>What did he concede based upon Maldacena&rsquo;s calculation</p>
<p>in ADS, CFT and five dimensional wormholes?</p>
<p>Is any of that?</p>
<p>First of all, we don&rsquo;t live in ADS universe.</p>
<p>Second of all, we don&rsquo;t know if wormholes are traversable,</p>
<p>if they exist even.</p>
<p>These are devices, Kip Thorne is popularized for movies.</p>
<p>To say that this is something on which I will concede a bet.</p>
<p>Now, obviously Hawking was doing that for publicity.</p>
<p>Why does Maldacena?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got a pretty high H index,</p>
<p>pretty well respected guy at IAS.</p>
<p>Love talking to him, brilliant guy.</p>
<p>By the way, also had made use of Eric and Pia&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>on gauge theory and economics originally.</p>
<p>And one, I believe the breakthrough,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what,</p>
<p>but partially credit some of the work that he did,</p>
<p>which appears there&rsquo;s a footnote to Pia Milani&rsquo;s thesis</p>
<p>and some conversations with Eric, I think in it.</p>
<p>Anyway, getting back to that,</p>
<p>why is there not the same skepticism?</p>
<p>Is it because Maldacena,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an eminent physicist obviously,</p>
<p>has published realistic work and done,</p>
<p>what about Witten?</p>
<p>Witten gets a pass.</p>
<p>I mean, if you, Witten just gets here.</p>
<p>Well, Witten gets a pass on which aspect?</p>
<p>The string theory?</p>
<p>Yeah, that M theory is correct.</p>
<p>I mean, here&rsquo;s, well, let me just say Hawking.</p>
<p>Hawking gets the ultimate pass.</p>
<p>Hawking would say things like M theory,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s zero evidence for it.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s the famous meme</p>
<p>that went around this weekend, like,</p>
<p>what is string theory predicted?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s actually wrong.</p>
<p>I talked to Kamran, I know you talked to Kamran.</p>
<p>Kamran says that string theory does make predictions.</p>
<p>It predicts the mass of the electron lies</p>
<p>between 10 to the minus one Planck mass</p>
<p>and 10 to the minus 30 Planck mass.</p>
<p>Okay, whatever, or electron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big range.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge range.</p>
<p>Is that, imagine Kamran comes up and again,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just some nobody, but he actually,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t have a profile, he&rsquo;s not Harvard,</p>
<p>has zero H and X or whatever Eric says.</p>
<p>Why do we not like, in other words,</p>
<p>why are we more harsh on people that are trying?</p>
<p>You know the answer to that.</p>
<p>So I get a million emails, just like you said,</p>
<p>you yourself, where they provenized in my world</p>
<p>as artificial intelligence, the equivalence of that,</p>
<p>is I figured out how to build consciousness,</p>
<p>how to engineer intelligence, how to, and sometimes.</p>
<p>You should send your emails to me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll send my emails to you.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll reply to each other.</p>
<p>I mean, and I don&rsquo;t want to sort of mock this</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that there is either kernels of interesting ideas</p>
<p>or in whole, like there is geniuses out there</p>
<p>that are unheard, but because there&rsquo;s so much noise,</p>
<p>you do have to weigh out like a higher</p>
<p>the Ed Wittons of the world when they make statements.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you build up a track record.</p>
<p>Like you just said with Ray Dalio,</p>
<p>you have to show that you can, like if you&rsquo;re a Pollock</p>
<p>and you show us a painting of a bunch of chaos,</p>
<p>you have to, and this is a bad example, probably,</p>
<p>because he probably never showed this proof.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he could do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s much more comforting to see</p>
<p>that they can paint a good, accurate picture.</p>
<p>Still life.</p>
<p>Of still life, of an apple on the table.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, because then, I mean,</p>
<p>because then there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about the scientific community</p>
<p>that they have perhaps an oversensitive bullshit sensor</p>
<p>to where they&rsquo;re not going to give the full effort</p>
<p>of their attention if you don&rsquo;t have the track record.</p>
<p>Now you could say that&rsquo;s a kind of club</p>
<p>that only you have to like, you have to have 10,</p>
<p>you have to have this, yes, that exists,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some aspect in which you have to play the game</p>
<p>a little bit to get the machine of science going.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you&rsquo;re always saying,</p>
<p>well, I have my ball and I don&rsquo;t want to play your game,</p>
<p>your game sucks, then nobody&rsquo;s gonna want to play with you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Look, inherent in all of this is an underlying grandiosity.</p>
<p>Look, how could you talk about doing what Kaku said</p>
<p>on here and elsewhere?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for the umbilical cord</p>
<p>that connects our universe to another universe</p>
<p>that will then reveal in a one inch equation</p>
<p>that will surely win a Nobel Prize, the mind of God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a prerequisite, I guess,</p>
<p>to tackle these questions.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s detrimental.</p>
<p>I think doing that, first of all,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an element of almost snarkiness</p>
<p>because none of these scientists are believing,</p>
<p>you know, Gnostics, they&rsquo;re not theists, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re using it as kind of a stand in</p>
<p>and always talk about Einstein didn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>he was like a Spinoza and he wasn&rsquo;t a, you know, a theist.</p>
<p>God doesn&rsquo;t play dice.</p>
<p>Yeah, Einstein&rsquo;s mentions of God, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then Stephen Hawking says if,</p>
<p>when we come, we get an M theory understood,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll know the mind of God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the title of Kaku&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>The God Particle, The God Equation.</p>
<p>It, you know, do any of them really believe in God?</p>
<p>No, is that a prerequisite?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not saying that.</p>
<p>But the point being,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about something that has to do with God,</p>
<p>right, I mean, where else do you go from there?</p>
<p>I mean, I think God for now enjoys a little bit more,</p>
<p>you know, kind of a PR than Elon or Joe or whatever, right?</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s, you know, God&rsquo;s got a pretty good,</p>
<p>you know, H index himself.</p>
<p>He has a, by the way, a Twitter account,</p>
<p>just so you know, it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>The tweets of God, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The tweet of God.</p>
<p>So if you look at that, you have to go in there,</p>
<p>again, you have to go in with some swagger.</p>
<p>You have to have a little bit of arrogance,</p>
<p>but you should, I agree,</p>
<p>mix with a little bit of humility.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s doing something, he comes from outside of academia.</p>
<p>Now, if he rails against, I&rsquo;m talking about Eric now,</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s just railing, oh, the system,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not gonna publish because F that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s only created by greedy journalists,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s doing himself any favors.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if he&rsquo;s shopping it, if he&rsquo;s talking it,</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s willing to expose it to criticism,</p>
<p>and to even embrace people</p>
<p>who may not have the purest intentions perhaps,</p>
<p>but in the sense of like they&rsquo;re not arguing solely</p>
<p>to get to the truth with a capital T,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re trying to do is take down Eric.</p>
<p>Hopefully those people aren&rsquo;t out there.</p>
<p>But on the other hand,</p>
<p>looking at what Eric does for other people,</p>
<p>looking at the fact that he has courtesy,</p>
<p>he will look at Wolfram, he will look at Lisey,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of his closest friends.</p>
<p>I mean, he calls him as his aunt, not his aunt.</p>
<p>Nemesis. Nemesis, right, right.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s interesting that they&rsquo;re loving friends.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed that portal conversation</p>
<p>between Gary and Lisey.</p>
<p>Eric is torn about that conversation because, I guess,</p>
<p>because of the nemesis of the beautiful dance of minds</p>
<p>playing with these ideas and theories of everything.</p>
<p>Some of these things, you know, look, so fundamentally,</p>
<p>now I may disagree with him, Eric, on a different aspect,</p>
<p>which is the only one I&rsquo;m capable of,</p>
<p>but let me say one thing,</p>
<p>which is experimental, but let me say one thing.</p>
<p>I understand probably a third</p>
<p>of what Eric&rsquo;s talking about with GU.</p>
<p>I understand, you know, GR, I understand mathematics,</p>
<p>I understand some group theory, fiber bone,</p>
<p>I can get a little of it, the age theory,</p>
<p>but I also understand what I don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>and I understand that there are people like Witten,</p>
<p>Maldacena, Nima, other people that can understand it,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not trying to understand it.</p>
<p>Sabina, she can understand it.</p>
<p>She makes all these, you know,</p>
<p>oh, I don&rsquo;t understand it, I don&rsquo;t want to understand it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time, and then she makes a video,</p>
<p>a music video, you know, kind of mocking Eric</p>
<p>and Steven and Garrett, and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, you have a time to do, and I love Sabina,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve actually promoted my show on her,</p>
<p>and I love her, and she&rsquo;s doing a wonderful job,</p>
<p>but you have a video that you said yourself</p>
<p>takes eight weeks to produce from start to finish,</p>
<p>and you couldn&rsquo;t have spent, you know, 30 minutes, two hours.</p>
<p>I, Brian Keating, have done it</p>
<p>as an experimental cosmologist,</p>
<p>and I have enough to say, like, this is interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the ASEIR project, and it actually,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t say that there are no people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very serious.</p>
<p>Louis Alvarez Gommet at SUNY Stony Brook</p>
<p>at the Simon Center for Geometrical Physics.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he and I are running this seminar,</p>
<p>hopefully this summer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna reenact the famous</p>
<p>Shelter Island conferences in the 1900s,</p>
<p>where, you know, Feynman got together,</p>
<p>and they calculated the Lamb shift and all that,</p>
<p>but what did that feature?</p>
<p>The harmony, the resonant minds</p>
<p>behind the best experimentalists in cosmology,</p>
<p>particle physics, condensed matter physics</p>
<p>is now teaching us tremendous things about, you know,</p>
<p>lower dimensional systems that can be applied.</p>
<p>Theorists and experimentalists, observers,</p>
<p>cosmologists, we all will get together,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just gonna do it out of a spirit of love,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s just like, oh, this guy&rsquo;s like a loudmouth,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time for that.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s interesting way to spend my time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a aspect that I hope to see,</p>
<p>and it goes back to our sort of discussion</p>
<p>about Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>I do hope to see sort of love and humility</p>
<p>in the presentation.</p>
<p>Like, let go of this kind of fear of your ideas being stolen</p>
<p>and the ego that&rsquo;s inherent to the scientific pursuit,</p>
<p>and now that everybody is established and known entities,</p>
<p>let go of that a little bit</p>
<p>so we can explore and celebrate ideas.</p>
<p>I would love to see more of that,</p>
<p>just like, as you were saying,</p>
<p>especially with these big ideas of theories of everything.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked, I mean,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t talking tails out of school,</p>
<p>but I mean, he has made claims</p>
<p>that I fundamentally disagree with,</p>
<p>in terms of like, he&rsquo;s had this Twitter baiting,</p>
<p>loving trolling of Elon,</p>
<p>why are you spending all this money to get to Mars?</p>
<p>We should be spending money on interdimensional travel,</p>
<p>and we can unlock it if we&hellip;</p>
<p>And I said to him, and he makes the point</p>
<p>that the atomic theory, that unleashed the nuclear age,</p>
<p>and that could lead to planetary destruction.</p>
<p>But I make the point pushing back with love on him,</p>
<p>and I say, look, nobody looked into the equations,</p>
<p>like Fermi didn&rsquo;t look into all these equations</p>
<p>of the unification, which still doesn&rsquo;t exist, by the way.</p>
<p>We spent all this time, Lex,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know why it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a phenomenon purely in theoretical physics.</p>
<p>People are looking for the toe,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re overlooking the gut.</p>
<p>In other words, they&rsquo;re spending all this time</p>
<p>on the theory of everything, the God equation,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this gut that unifies the three stronger forces.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a single theory for that.</p>
<p>And people like lash out, they&rsquo;ve tried and failed at it.</p>
<p>Yeah, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s four forces, gut grant unification theories</p>
<p>that unifies the three forces stuff,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to get a shortcut</p>
<p>to the theory of everything, which unifies the four.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this whole thing</p>
<p>that maybe quantum gravity is not even a thing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to solve the puzzle of everything</p>
<p>at the physics level.</p>
<p>And then already before solving it,</p>
<p>already saying, once we solve it,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s going to be all the beautiful time machines.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just level jumping it, going to level 256.</p>
<p>Time x and everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I suppose you need that kind of ego, that confidence,</p>
<p>that ambition in order to even have a chance</p>
<p>at some of these things.</p>
<p>The only two people in this book of nine Nobel laureates</p>
<p>who told me they don&rsquo;t have the imposter syndrome</p>
<p>were two theorists, Frank Wilczek and Sheldon Glashow.</p>
<p>And Frank is a pretty interesting,</p>
<p>and I know eventually we&rsquo;re gonna talk</p>
<p>about the meaning of life, but you talk about Frank.</p>
<p>Frank invented this theory along with his advisor</p>
<p>and another third person in the early 1970s,</p>
<p>which from 1974, three, when he was at Princeton,</p>
<p>all the way up until 2004, when he won the Nobel,</p>
<p>every day of his life.</p>
<p>Imagine this, Lex.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have this startup.</p>
<p>Actually, someone tells you you&rsquo;re gonna win a lottery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna win a lottery in 40 years.</p>
<p>What becomes your singular focus in your life</p>
<p>from now until the next 40 years?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I mean, would it be winning the lottery</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m so confident?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying you&rsquo;re guaranteed to win a lottery.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s this wallet, Bitcoin wallet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna guarantee I have this much money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stable coin, whatever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna win it, but you have to wait 40 years.</p>
<p>To me, it would be surviving for the next 40 years.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t leave your house.</p>
<p>You would go out in a bubble wrap hat.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t go out with that 20 masks on, right?</p>
<p>Your whole life would be consumed with.</p>
<p>Now, imagine everyone&rsquo;s telling you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna win the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>which is bigger than the lottery.</p>
<p>I mean, many P prizes are worth more than the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>and every person who wins a prize</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worth three times the money, like Maldacena,</p>
<p>he would trade that breakthrough prize</p>
<p>for a Nobel Prize and a heartbeat.</p>
<p>So these guys had to wait 40 years.</p>
<p>Imagine the excruciating pain.</p>
<p>What got him through it?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t feel like he didn&rsquo;t deserve it.</p>
<p>He felt like, hell yeah, I earned it.</p>
<p>He has that swagger.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m looking for in this asset is to try to find</p>
<p>ways that we can test stuff now,</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m gonna be here in 40 years,</p>
<p>I hope I am, but can we bypass, can we get shortcuts?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s called the low energy regime.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Like, what can we do now?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Like Isaac Newton came up with color theory</p>
<p>and he did something really interesting.</p>
<p>Next time I come, I&rsquo;ll bring you some prisms.</p>
<p>What did he do?</p>
<p>He took a white light.</p>
<p>He took a prism from the sun, actually.</p>
<p>He put it through a slit, put it through a prism</p>
<p>and it made a beautiful rainbow, like you&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>And then he took another prism</p>
<p>and he put it upside down,</p>
<p>like, you know, dark side of the moon, whatever.</p>
<p>And the light went through the first prism,</p>
<p>turned into a rainbow.</p>
<p>And then the rainbow went into a prism</p>
<p>and came out a white light.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Then he took a popsicle stick or whatever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably, you know, pipe tobacco.</p>
<p>And he put it in the beam, like blocked out the orange</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t make white light come out.</p>
<p>So he showed like colors of synthesis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common, he didn&rsquo;t use like</p>
<p>the Large Hadron Collider to do that.</p>
<p>You know, he used a very low energy experiment</p>
<p>to prove a unification in this color physics</p>
<p>and different kind of color physics</p>
<p>than in quantum chromodynamics.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, can we find things like that?</p>
<p>Are we spending way too much time and energy</p>
<p>thinking about the future circular collider,</p>
<p>which even if it gets built will cost $30 billion</p>
<p>just to build.</p>
<p>By the way, anytime from now on,</p>
<p>if I leave you with anything,</p>
<p>anytime an experimental physicist tells you a number,</p>
<p>always double it, maybe triple it.</p>
<p>How much is it gonna cost?</p>
<p>To operate it.</p>
<p>So like, do we build an aircraft carrier</p>
<p>to build an aircraft carrier?</p>
<p>Do we build a nuclear reactor, a semiconductor facility?</p>
<p>And the rule of thumb that works pretty well</p>
<p>in project management is it costs about 10% per year</p>
<p>to operate a given object of sufficient complexity.</p>
<p>And in this case, so in 10 years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll cost double the cost.</p>
<p>So never believe a number,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s from our mutual friend, Harry or whoever,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe the number, double it.</p>
<p>And then say, is it worth it?</p>
<p>And so building a solar system size accelerator,</p>
<p>even if it were possible, do we have to do that?</p>
<p>Or can we use these two 30 solar mass objects</p>
<p>colliding together to test the number</p>
<p>of large extra spatial dimensions?</p>
<p>Can we do that?</p>
<p>People are working on it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So focus on building detectors.</p>
<p>Experiments.</p>
<p>That like, where the cosmos is part of the experiment,</p>
<p>I suppose, is doing the hard work.</p>
<p>Cause when you&rsquo;re saying low energy regime,</p>
<p>cause for some of these, especially big questions,</p>
<p>like theories of everything,</p>
<p>you need some high energy events.</p>
<p>And so somehow figure out how the high energy events</p>
<p>that are already happening out there,</p>
<p>how to leverage them to understand here on earth.</p>
<p>So one of the alternative theories of cosmology</p>
<p>that is not a singular quantum gravitational requiring</p>
<p>as the big bang and inflation are,</p>
<p>is are these bouncing models.</p>
<p>Some of them feature a similar kind of entity</p>
<p>called the quantum field.</p>
<p>And that quantum field in the initial stages</p>
<p>of the universe of our current, after the bounce,</p>
<p>which is not a singularity,</p>
<p>it compresses to a classical kind of rebound</p>
<p>and the universe starts expanding.</p>
<p>During that process, the expansion is governed</p>
<p>by what&rsquo;s called a scalar field,</p>
<p>of which we only know one that exists,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the Higgs boson.</p>
<p>Higgs is a scalar fundamental particle, fundamental field.</p>
<p>That field then later does double duty</p>
<p>and it becomes dark energy.</p>
<p>So it solves two problems.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s correct, we don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>But are there observations of,</p>
<p>and so dark energy is manifest today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s manifest in properties we see in supernova explosions,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>We see the effects of accelerating universe</p>
<p>caused by presumably dark energy.</p>
<p>Is dark energy a constant or does it vary?</p>
<p>That has to vary in order for this theory to be true,</p>
<p>because that eventually has to decay</p>
<p>so that the universe can not support itself</p>
<p>and collapse again, again classically.</p>
<p>So we could use low energy phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to think of supernova</p>
<p>as being a low energy phenomenon,</p>
<p>but we use that as a tracer of the cosmic expansion field</p>
<p>and see, does it change or is it a constant?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example of a low energy limit</p>
<p>to prove a high energy phenomenon,</p>
<p>unlike this collapsing universe in the cyclic model.</p>
<p>Speaking of things that cost a lot, but are super exciting.</p>
<p>Page two, crap.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;ll wrap it up.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Calm down, this is, there&rsquo;s more than page two.</p>
<p>What do you think this is?</p>
<p>This is a&hellip;</p>
<p>Thesis.</p>
<p>Well, Louis de Broglie&rsquo;s thesis was three pages long</p>
<p>and he won the Nobel Prize for the wave particle duality.</p>
<p>So, size matters in different dimensions in life.</p>
<p>I think the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned about life</p>
<p>is the short of the paper or the short of the thesis.</p>
<p>Actually the short of the paper,</p>
<p>some of the greatest papers ever written are short.</p>
<p>I feel like some of the best ideas in this world,</p>
<p>not to sound like a contradiction of Feynman,</p>
<p>a contradiction on top of a contradiction,</p>
<p>but it could be written on a napkin, honestly.</p>
<p>It just kind of tells you something about ideas.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about the James Webb Space Telescope?</p>
<p>Is this, as somebody who likes telescopes,</p>
<p>and this is one of the, I think it says,</p>
<p>took 20 years to build, $9.7 billion.</p>
<p>Is that way too much, too little?</p>
<p>Are you excited about this thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sufficiently different from what I do in my field</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s incredibly interesting to me</p>
<p>because I have no horse in that race.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not competing with them for time or money</p>
<p>or resources or people or whatever.</p>
<p>So I can purely be an advocate</p>
<p>and an aficionado of science.</p>
<p>It is in some sense the successor to Hubble.</p>
<p>It will do things that Hubble can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>It will also may or may not have the impact</p>
<p>on a visceral kind of artistic level that Hubble had.</p>
<p>What are some of the most iconic things that Hubble did?</p>
<p>The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the pillars of creation,</p>
<p>storms and imaging of these twisted deep sky galaxies.</p>
<p>Those resonated with the public.</p>
<p>Just visually, they were beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you look at these images,</p>
<p>the Hubble Ultra Deep Field,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll maybe put that in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll show every speck of light except for one,</p>
<p>4,000 blobs of light.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one star in our galaxy, the rest are galaxies.</p>
<p>Now that image is less than 1 10th of your fingernail</p>
<p>held out at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>It contains 4,000 galaxies.</p>
<p>So now you can figure out</p>
<p>how many galaxies there are in the whole sky</p>
<p>just by seeing how long does it take you</p>
<p>to move your fingernail over the whole sky.</p>
<p>So we have another couple of hours.</p>
<p>No, so it comes out to be,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we get 500 billion or more galaxies.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not exact to the galaxy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good order of magnitude estimate,</p>
<p>maybe even better.</p>
<p>Hubble produced that and it was basically serendipitous.</p>
<p>They pointed to some dark blank piece of sky</p>
<p>what they thought was blank and they saw it.</p>
<p>Same thing that happened with the CMB.</p>
<p>They were looking for something they didn&rsquo;t find.</p>
<p>Same thing they found when they were looking</p>
<p>for the deceleration of the universe</p>
<p>and found it was accelerating.</p>
<p>So what I sometimes hear is that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re gonna discover.</p>
<p>I never think that&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>to spend billions of dollars on something.</p>
<p>Like you should have some guaranteed low hanging fruit</p>
<p>and then there should be swinging for the fences.</p>
<p>And I think in this case, it was really everything</p>
<p>is swinging for the fences</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of a single point failure.</p>
<p>If that telescope, which is this origami construction</p>
<p>of 22 hexagonal panels that have to unfold properly</p>
<p>and then orient themselves a million miles from Earth</p>
<p>beyond the Earth moon distance by a factor of four</p>
<p>and still transmit telecommunication back to the Earth,</p>
<p>get solar energy, keep it away from the sun.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna look through the telescope of the sun</p>
<p>with your remaining good eye.</p>
<p>And you do that and you cover,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be phenomenal for science, for sure, if it works.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people think it&rsquo;s so risky.</p>
<p>NASA sunk so much of their budget, it ate up.</p>
<p>And what if it does fail?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no guarantee.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s insured, but so what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get back those 20 years of people.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s start building it again.</p>
<p>Like they didn&rsquo;t build two copies of it.</p>
<p>And then if it fails, it kinda has a dampening effect</p>
<p>on the prospects and the inspiration of the public</p>
<p>for what science can do,</p>
<p>what science engineering can do is out in space.</p>
<p>It will make a huge impact scientific.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope for the best, let&rsquo;s assume it does succeed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s launched in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>And when it does, it will transform our understanding</p>
<p>of we just discovered not only like extrasolar planets</p>
<p>that have moons on them and asteroid belt,</p>
<p>we discovered an extrasolar planet in another galaxy.</p>
<p>This will be able to see crazy stuff like that,</p>
<p>spectroscopy, imaging, but it will be able</p>
<p>to go back farther in time,</p>
<p>such that we will be doing cosmology.</p>
<p>Hubble did some cosmology and measured the Hubble constant.</p>
<p>That was its key project when it was designed and launched.</p>
<p>But because it is optical telescope,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sensitive to more close in redshift,</p>
<p>so shorter distances.</p>
<p>Now James Webb is much, much higher redshift.</p>
<p>It can probe the darker, deeper, distant universe.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about not the distant universe,</p>
<p>but our neighboring planets.</p>
<p>First, I gotta ask you about the moon.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a piece of the moon on this table</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve given me that we didn&rsquo;t have to pick up</p>
<p>that arrived here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So how did a piece of the moon arrive here on Earth?</p>
<p>So this chunk of the moon, if it were delivered</p>
<p>by the Apollo and NASA missions,</p>
<p>you and I would be guilty of a felony right now</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s illegal to own pieces of the moon</p>
<p>collected by the Apollo astronauts.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t even joke about that when you go over to Houston.</p>
<p>This piece of moon rock was delivered</p>
<p>via the old fashioned way by gravity.</p>
<p>So this was a chunk of the moon, which is blasted off</p>
<p>because the moon gets bombarded by asteroids and meteoroids.</p>
<p>Some of them eject material from the surface of the moon</p>
<p>into space, and it will then orbit</p>
<p>the common moon Earth system.</p>
<p>And it will then eventually enter our atmosphere.</p>
<p>And if the piece is large enough</p>
<p>and the trajectory is proper, it can land intact.</p>
<p>And this one landed with a few hundred grams worth,</p>
<p>and they sliced it up.</p>
<p>And then it was delivered via US Postal Service to my house.</p>
<p>So you can buy these pieces.</p>
<p>And actually, you can buy a piece of Mars.</p>
<p>You can buy a piece of Mars delivered by the same route.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s so interesting about that?</p>
<p>Well, if a piece of Mars can get here,</p>
<p>a piece of Earth can get there.</p>
<p>Some piece of Earth has some life forms on it.</p>
<p>It could get there.</p>
<p>And if that can happen in our solar system,</p>
<p>it could happen throughout the galaxy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually not of the opinion</p>
<p>that there is life elsewhere in the universe,</p>
<p>at least technological life that we can,</p>
<p>I see this look of horror on your face.</p>
<p>I view it, I am personally extremely pessimistic,</p>
<p>would be extremely surprised.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m curious by the transition</p>
<p>because you just said that life could have arrived from Mars</p>
<p>or like from planet to planet</p>
<p>because of the meteorites striking it and so on.</p>
<p>And then you went to,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think there might be life out there</p>
<p>in the universe.</p>
<p>Technological life.</p>
<p>Yeah, advanced intelligence civilizations.</p>
<p>Okay, so go on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the generalization</p>
<p>of what the famous astronomer Fred Hoyle called,</p>
<p>I know this is a PG 13, it&rsquo;s called panspermia.</p>
<p>Panspermia.</p>
<p>Beep that out, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, please.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the exchange of genetic life form material</p>
<p>from other reaches on earth,</p>
<p>which explains the origin of life on earth,</p>
<p>but not the origin of life itself,</p>
<p>which I think is a much grander mystery</p>
<p>and much more interesting.</p>
<p>How did life get here?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve talked with many eminent people about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna add that much,</p>
<p>but just thinking about the reverse process.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say life started on the earth somehow</p>
<p>and then made its way out into the universe.</p>
<p>Is there enough time for the,</p>
<p>whatever material went from earth</p>
<p>via panspermic direction,</p>
<p>spraying the love gun out into the universe,</p>
<p>did that then have enough time to incubate</p>
<p>and go onto a planet that could support it?</p>
<p>Certainly not within our solar system,</p>
<p>which traveling at the meteorite speeds</p>
<p>would require hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>Then looking at the evolutionary history</p>
<p>from bacteria to Bach,</p>
<p>from rocks to Rachmaninoff,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I can do this all day.</p>
<p>Oh wow, that&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>How do you get from those very simple</p>
<p>inanimate objects to life?</p>
<p>I just simply think there&rsquo;s not enough time</p>
<p>for earth to seed life,</p>
<p>technological life throughout the galaxy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any evidence for that.</p>
<p>But so you really think that the origin</p>
<p>of life on earth is a really special event?</p>
<p>Yeah, if it did originate on earth,</p>
<p>my question for those that search for life</p>
<p>outside the earth is what if you had a letter from God</p>
<p>and the letter said life didn&rsquo;t originate on earth,</p>
<p>like would you choose a different profession?</p>
<p>Like it would seem hopeless.</p>
<p>Like in other words, we only have a sample of one.</p>
<p>In fact, we only know of one conscious life form,</p>
<p>let alone one planet that has life on it, right?</p>
<p>What if you knew for sure it didn&rsquo;t start here?</p>
<p>That means that like there&rsquo;s almost nothing about earth</p>
<p>that is originated, it didn&rsquo;t originate the life process.</p>
<p>So to study purely the origin of life,</p>
<p>not life itself, I think that&rsquo;s still fascinating.</p>
<p>But how could we learn about the origin of,</p>
<p>remember you have to go from inanimate object</p>
<p>to a living object, whatever that definition of life is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not an expert in many definitions,</p>
<p>Max, Sarah, you know, many different definition.</p>
<p>But how do you actually go from inanimate to animate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge question.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then you don&rsquo;t have to be the place</p>
<p>where life originated to replicate the origin</p>
<p>or to under, like, yeah, that&rsquo;s one way</p>
<p>to understand something is to build it.</p>
<p>But another way is to just observe it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to truly re engineer from scratch.</p>
<p>So, you know, but then yes, if it didn&rsquo;t originate on earth,</p>
<p>then your intuitions about the basic prerequisites</p>
<p>of life are off.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the governing principle, right?</p>
<p>Like, what is, and then you can have just</p>
<p>almost an arbitrary number of possible,</p>
<p>like, if life didn&rsquo;t start on earth.</p>
<p>So to me, that&rsquo;s exciting because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>we know even less than we thought.</p>
<p>The thing is it can prosper on earth though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So maybe the origin of life is fundamentally different</p>
<p>from the maintenance of life.</p>
<p>Right, and maybe the existence</p>
<p>of the earth life symbiosis is critical.</p>
<p>I think Sarah, and you talked about Sarah Walker,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a planetary phenomenon, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So doesn&rsquo;t that make it less like, in other words,</p>
<p>like not only do you need special life conditions</p>
<p>to create life, but then sustenance of life, as you say,</p>
<p>that also has to be maintained</p>
<p>under very specific circumstances</p>
<p>by very specific planets</p>
<p>and with very specific tectonic activity and moon.</p>
<p>And by the way, you need a Jupiter nearby.</p>
<p>You need an earth and a moon system</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t get bombarded too early.</p>
<p>And I always think like this, like technological life,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t said this before, really, so I&rsquo;m just speaking.</p>
<p>I usually like to write down before I say these different,</p>
<p>but one of the things I thought about is.</p>
<p>Somebody hosts a podcast.</p>
<p>You should probably accept the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to say stupid things</p>
<p>every once in a while.</p>
<p>Not every once in a while, every while.</p>
<p>I claim that to get to sending people to the moon,</p>
<p>our planet needed whales and dinosaurs, right?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t make a solar panel</p>
<p>from another solar panel.</p>
<p>Like you made a solar panel from a factory</p>
<p>that melted down glass, silica, aluminum,</p>
<p>extruded that using fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Where do those fossil fuels come from?</p>
<p>Like, so any civilization that&rsquo;s going to be a Dyson,</p>
<p>you know, a Kardashev, do they have dinosaurs?</p>
<p>Like, do they have like prebiotic life?</p>
<p>Do they have a great oxygenation event?</p>
<p>Did they have a dimorphism between prokaryotic, eukaryotic?</p>
<p>All those hurdles, let&rsquo;s say you give each one,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s eight hurdles.</p>
<p>And each one of those has a probability</p>
<p>of one in a thousand to go from, you know,</p>
<p>eukaryotic, prokaryotic, whatever.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s a one in a thousand chance.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like one in 10 to the 40th or whatever,</p>
<p>if you really do it.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s first generous nature.</p>
<p>One in 10 to the three.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s eight of those hurdles.</p>
<p>That means you have 10 to the 24th power,</p>
<p>different possibility.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just with eight.</p>
<p>Like the moon has to be there.</p>
<p>Jupiter has to be there.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs had to be there.</p>
<p>All the different things that we have</p>
<p>to get to technological life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only 10 to the, only,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 10 to the 22nd, we think,</p>
<p>Earth, not Earth, planets in the observable universe,</p>
<p>not the galaxy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 100 times fewer than the probability</p>
<p>to get, you know, 100% clearing these eight</p>
<p>very low hurdles of one in a thousand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating, because now I really need</p>
<p>to listen to your conversation with Lee Cronin,</p>
<p>who I believe you had, because he believes the opposite.</p>
<p>Yes, I know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to have a debate with him.</p>
<p>He believes that the way biology evolved on Earth</p>
<p>could have evolved almost an infinite number of other ways.</p>
<p>So like, if you ran Earth over and over and over,</p>
<p>you would keep getting life and it would be very different.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, the fact that our particular life seems unique</p>
<p>is just like, well, because every freaking life</p>
<p>is going to seem unique, but it&rsquo;ll be very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, we shouldn&rsquo;t be asking the question</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s the likelihood of getting a human like thing?</p>
<p>Because that seems to be super special.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like, how easy is it to make</p>
<p>Slime mold.</p>
<p>Anything that has the skills of a human?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean like something with thumbs,</p>
<p>but achieving basically a technological civilization.</p>
<p>And according to Lee at least, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s trivial.</p>
<p>I know, we fought, I fought a little bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to debate him and I think it&rsquo;d be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Because we debate with love when I talk with Lee.</p>
<p>I love him and he loves me, I think, I hope.</p>
<p>But let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>I asked this of him and Sarah on our Clubhouse ones.</p>
<p>So what do you think would happen the next day?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we discover life, it&rsquo;s Proxima Centauri B.</p>
<p>It looks just like Slime mold,</p>
<p>like you got on your Brie cheese or whatever.</p>
<p>We discover it, what would happen the next day?</p>
<p>And they were like, oh, this would be transformative.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not trying to be like Total Cassandra about this,</p>
<p>but I said, I don&rsquo;t think anything would happen.</p>
<p>And what are you talking about?</p>
<p>It would be transformational.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I stipulate that life exists.</p>
<p>Go down to like the river, I&rsquo;m in San Diego,</p>
<p>go down to the Pacific Ocean, scoop up a glass.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna find life in there.</p>
<p>And what are we doing?</p>
<p>What are we doing to our earth?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re destroying it callously.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like pumping crap into there.</p>
<p>Like we have this toxic waste spill</p>
<p>a couple of months ago in San Diego,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t go to the beach.</p>
<p>Let me take it a step further.</p>
<p>You know how many people, I&rsquo;m sorry that you do know,</p>
<p>but how many people died in the 20th century killed?</p>
<p>These are advanced civil, this isn&rsquo;t a slime mold.</p>
<p>We kill, we maim, we harm, we hurt, we hate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anything would happen the next day.</p>
<p>Then we go back to what we had.</p>
<p>And I said, if that weren&rsquo;t proof enough,</p>
<p>life has been discovered at least two or three times</p>
<p>just in my professional career.</p>
<p>Once in 1996, these Allenland Hills meteorites in Antarctica,</p>
<p>they saw like microbial respiration processes.</p>
<p>Still we don&rsquo;t know, it was a press conference</p>
<p>held by Bill Clinton on the White House lawn</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s featured in the movie Contact.</p>
<p>My purpose for that movie.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this phosphorus life,</p>
<p>this toxic life in the pools of Mono Lake.</p>
<p>Many, you know, extremophile, we don&rsquo;t give a crap.</p>
<p>We continue to treat.</p>
<p>So why are we thinking that like our salvation,</p>
<p>from whence will our salvation come as the Bible says?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not gonna change how we are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna magnify how I treat you or you treat me.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re pretty knowledgeable people,</p>
<p>you and I compared to, you know, lay people.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting argument.</p>
<p>I wonder if you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But my intuition is I can maybe present</p>
<p>a different argument that you can think about</p>
<p>in the realm of things you care about even deeper,</p>
<p>which is like what happens once we figure out</p>
<p>the origins of the universe?</p>
<p>Like how would that change your life?</p>
<p>I would say there are certain discoveries</p>
<p>that even in their very idea</p>
<p>will change the fabric of society.</p>
<p>I tend to see if there&rsquo;s definitive proof</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s life and the more complex,</p>
<p>the more powerful that idea is elsewhere.</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how it will change society</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a slap in the face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a humbling force or maybe not.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s a motivator to say,</p>
<p>yeah, I don&rsquo;t know which force would take over.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be governments with military</p>
<p>that start to think like, well, how do we kill it?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a lot of life out there,</p>
<p>how do we create the defenses?</p>
<p>How do we extract it?</p>
<p>Or mine it for benefits?</p>
<p>I mean, I just see like there&rsquo;s 100 million</p>
<p>literal counter examples of that.</p>
<p>I mean, right now there&rsquo;s like 700 million kids in poverty.</p>
<p>How do we go about our life and just not deal with that?</p>
<p>I mean, look, I put it aside.</p>
<p>I eat hamburgers and in 100 years I&rsquo;ll be canceled</p>
<p>for being a carnivore or whatever.</p>
<p>So obviously to get through life,</p>
<p>you have to make certain compromise.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna think about certain things.</p>
<p>But I just think there is a sort of wish fulfillment.</p>
<p>Like every time there&rsquo;s, why are we going to Mars</p>
<p>and digging and flying this cool ass helicopter?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for water.</p>
<p>Like stipulate that water was there.</p>
<p>Like, I believe there was water.</p>
<p>I think we should investigate</p>
<p>and see what the geology was like.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think, so you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna get meaning from it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not worth doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying there&rsquo;s a wish fulfillment aspect</p>
<p>that people will find meaning for life from science.</p>
<p>Okay, but there&rsquo;s a complicated line here.</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s this intelligent civilization living,</p>
<p>obviously probably not on Mars,</p>
<p>but somewhere like in a neighboring galaxy that we,</p>
<p>sorry, in a neighboring star system that we discover,</p>
<p>that we discover,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think that profound change in meaning?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess, again,</p>
<p>I assume that because of this panceramic process</p>
<p>or whatever, that the probability is much,</p>
<p>much greater than zero.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not one, a hundred percent,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much likelier than that,</p>
<p>that at least some living material from Earth</p>
<p>has ejaculated itself into the solar system,</p>
<p>into the universe, right?</p>
<p>Into our galaxy. Beat that, please, as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So like the fact that that could happen</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re holding a piece from a planetary body,</p>
<p>one that couldn&rsquo;t support life as far as we know,</p>
<p>but next time, if you play nice</p>
<p>and you come on my podcast someday,</p>
<p>I will give you a tiny chunk of Mars.</p>
<p>So Mars theoretically could support stuff, right?</p>
<p>So yeah, so I believe that there could be remnants of Earth</p>
<p>so that means there could be evolution.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any chance</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s people using iPhones</p>
<p>and having podcasts and stuff in Proxima Centauri.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some chance though, right?</p>
<p>So again, I think the simple statement to say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much, much, much higher probability</p>
<p>that life exists than technological life exists, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can argue that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s forbidden.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying any of this is forbidden,</p>
<p>not worth studying, not interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a likelihood thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and to answer your,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re wise to push back</p>
<p>and like, what does it matter what I&rsquo;m doing?</p>
<p>And I like to think about that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, what is the value of what you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Like you have to answer that question</p>
<p>or else at the end of your life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have these existential kind of crises, right?</p>
<p>So when I think about like who I am,</p>
<p>part of my identity is answering</p>
<p>and asking scientific questions.</p>
<p>For me though, there is a religious kind of undercurrent</p>
<p>that does undergird in some sense, this quest.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not like a practicing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like wearing yarmulke,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not like full on into my birth religion, Judaism.</p>
<p>But at the same token, I think as,</p>
<p>one of the things Einstein did say is that,</p>
<p>religion without science is blind</p>
<p>or is lame and science without religion is lame,</p>
<p>is blind and lame.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that like,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get meaning from just knowing facts.</p>
<p>Like Wikipedia knows more than all of us will ever know,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>It has no wisdom.</p>
<p>Wisdom, it means sapient.</p>
<p>The word wisdom in Latin is sapient.</p>
<p>We are wise.</p>
<p>And by the way, do you know what we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>our real name is Homo sapiens sapient.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s man who knows that he knows.</p>
<p>Do you know what he knows?</p>
<p>Do you know what the knowing is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s gonna die.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the only creatures that know that we are gonna die.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know when we&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>But like, you know, I have a cat,</p>
<p>a fierce attack cat, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t know when she&rsquo;s gonna die.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m more valuable than I think I am.</p>
<p>The survival instinct is fundamentally different</p>
<p>from like the knowledge of death.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the Ernest Becker comes in</p>
<p>with the terror of death and that that&rsquo;s a creative force</p>
<p>that seems to be more feature than bug</p>
<p>about the human condition is that,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a gift of knowing our own mortality.</p>
<p>Yeah, to me, I mean, that&rsquo;s why,</p>
<p>I agree with you in some sense</p>
<p>in terms of the aliens not being a thing</p>
<p>that solves all mysteries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why my love has always been the human mind.</p>
<p>So understanding who we are, what the hell are we?</p>
<p>And I think your love has been an echo of that,</p>
<p>which is where do we come from?</p>
<p>Or basically, as cheesy as it sounds,</p>
<p>Michio Kaku is away with words.</p>
<p>If you can just like enjoy the, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, he speaks in complete,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like Sam Harris of cosmology.</p>
<p>I mean, he speaks in complete paragraphs.</p>
<p>But like also unapologetically, he says,</p>
<p>we will know God or we will know the mind of God</p>
<p>or whatever the quotes, those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exciting that physics might be able</p>
<p>to find equations that unlock our origins</p>
<p>at the very core and like the fabric of it all too,</p>
<p>and not just our origins.</p>
<p>At the beginning, something tells me we&rsquo;re too dumb</p>
<p>to truly understand what&rsquo;s at the beginning, but.</p>
<p>I think we should be humble in that way.</p>
<p>I mean, again, another thing is, you know,</p>
<p>you ever hear the saying like we share 99% of our DNA</p>
<p>with chimps or bonobos or whatever?</p>
<p>I share like probably more than that.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish we shared like 100%.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;d be so much more interesting,</p>
<p>like, oh, there&rsquo;s 50% of a fruit fly or banana.</p>
<p>No, no, no, there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>but that should make us feel more precious.</p>
<p>And I almost feel like discovering life</p>
<p>on another planet, whatever solar system</p>
<p>would cause a diminution of humanity.</p>
<p>Like the one thing I do hold fast to from religion,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where I am with God.</p>
<p>Like, do I believe in God?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an unanswerable question,</p>
<p>but I have some thoughts about it.</p>
<p>But by the same token, I think the one thing I do get</p>
<p>from religion is that every human has infinite worth</p>
<p>because we are in a religious capacity</p>
<p>considered to be equal to God.</p>
<p>In other words, we are gods not to be like, you know,</p>
<p>but we can contemplate what God did.</p>
<p>We have aspects of God.</p>
<p>We have free will.</p>
<p>God had free will if he exists.</p>
<p>Again, I can&rsquo;t prove that God exists,</p>
<p>otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t have any credit</p>
<p>for believing in God.</p>
<p>This is interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m talking to Einstein here,</p>
<p>but let me ask anyway.</p>
<p>Can you clip that for my clips, John?</p>
<p>For somebody who&rsquo;s looking at the young universe,</p>
<p>at the early universe, and are talking about God</p>
<p>and are agnostic, who do you think is God?</p>
<p>So I thought you had just like one of the best podcasts</p>
<p>with Sam Harris this past summer.</p>
<p>And one of the things I liked about that conversation</p>
<p>is he talked a lot about happiness and meditation.</p>
<p>And he said something that&rsquo;s really resonated with me,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been working it around</p>
<p>and trying to work on it my own way.</p>
<p>But he said like, you can never be happy</p>
<p>if you can only become happy.</p>
<p>And I try to take it a little bit further than that,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Meditation is like, you&rsquo;re not like, oh, I&rsquo;m happy,</p>
<p>and now like, oh, my kid came in and now I&rsquo;m not happy.</p>
<p>No, you can be satisfied.</p>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut said, you ever catch this?</p>
<p>Sometimes, Alexa, you&rsquo;re walking around and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>life is fricking amazing, I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>And Kurt Vonnegut said, you should say to yourself</p>
<p>every time that happens a little mantra,</p>
<p>if this isn&rsquo;t goodness, if this isn&rsquo;t happiness, nothing is.</p>
<p>Just remind yourself how awesome it is,</p>
<p>every breath, everything that you do when you make an impact.</p>
<p>Even some of the bad stuff that happens, good, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So Sam said that, and it made me think,</p>
<p>because I was like, well, what does it really mean</p>
<p>to be happy?</p>
<p>Because like, I can think of about two or three ways</p>
<p>that right now I could double my happiness.</p>
<p>You know, like win the lottery or whatever,</p>
<p>like I could double my happiness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only a few ways though, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, I had this kind of thought like,</p>
<p>how many boats can you water ski behind?</p>
<p>Like you had twice as many followers,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;ve got 2 million followers, 5 million, whatever.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do anything, it&rsquo;s called the hedonic treadmill.</p>
<p>Like once you get to a certain level,</p>
<p>it takes a lot more, you know, change in followers,</p>
<p>money, impact, women, whatever you want</p>
<p>to make you have one more quanta of happiness, right?</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is a concept from entropy.</p>
<p>I can make your life miserable in an infinite number of ways.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s more space</p>
<p>to make your life unhappy than happy.</p>
<p>And so I thought about that in the context</p>
<p>of what Sam said about happiness.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like, yeah, it&rsquo;s an expression of entropy.</p>
<p>And that what you should be doing in life</p>
<p>is doing that which will cause you devastation</p>
<p>if it goes away.</p>
<p>Because those are the things that like,</p>
<p>are where you&rsquo;re reducing entropy,</p>
<p>like a kid, like anyone who&rsquo;s a parent</p>
<p>knows instantly what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Like how to make your life a billion times worse.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no way to make your life a billion times better.</p>
<p>And so thinking about that,</p>
<p>now turning it to the question of God&rsquo;s existence,</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s no way that you can believe in God</p>
<p>to quote, misquote Sam,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s ways that you can become a believer in God.</p>
<p>In other words, you could increase</p>
<p>the Bayesian confidence level that there is some,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s not call it God because that&rsquo;s a freighted term.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just call it some infinite source of goodness</p>
<p>or our beautiful power in the universe, right?</p>
<p>Simple things can do that.</p>
<p>You can increase your credulity in the goodness of life.</p>
<p>And we have this bias as humans towards negativity,</p>
<p>negativity bias, well known fact.</p>
<p>So what I wanna do is, let&rsquo;s call it God good, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it comes from, God good,</p>
<p>same words in German.</p>
<p>And when we think about what is good,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do those things that would devastate us.</p>
<p>And a lot of that could be relationships.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a powerful concept from network theory,</p>
<p>which is that the number of connections in a network,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m just saying it for your own,</p>
<p>it grows as the square of the elements in the matrix</p>
<p>in the number, right?</p>
<p>So you think of a matrix with N people,</p>
<p>you know person one, two, three, four,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s four other people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 16 different pairs, but half of them overlap.</p>
<p>The diagonal is where you know each other,</p>
<p>you know yourself.</p>
<p>But that still grows as N squared.</p>
<p>So those connections increase and decrease, right?</p>
<p>You ever have two friends that are fighting</p>
<p>and like you&rsquo;re kind of upset,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re not fighting with either one of them?</p>
<p>So like a network grows like that.</p>
<p>So you wanna increase your network as much as possible,</p>
<p>but only the kind of high quality interstices between them.</p>
<p>And I think in doing so,</p>
<p>you make yourself fragile, not anti fragile.</p>
<p>And I think that is where purpose</p>
<p>and maybe approaching some notion of God can come from.</p>
<p>So that is a source of meaning,</p>
<p>maximizing the goodness in life.</p>
<p>And the way you know it&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>is if it&rsquo;s taken away, it would devastate you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>Think about it, your brand, your business,</p>
<p>your spouse, your kids.</p>
<p>I mean, parents can&rsquo;t count,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known parents that have,</p>
<p>Jim Simons, here&rsquo;s a perfect example.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of my oldest friends and mentors.</p>
<p>He is one of the richest people on earth.</p>
<p>Gulf Stream, Mega Yacht,</p>
<p>this is all documented books about him.</p>
<p>He lost two sons as adults.</p>
<p>And I hear people say,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m so jealous of Jim Simons.</p>
<p>Would you take everything?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where he has that strength</p>
<p>and his wife, Marilyn, and his first wife, Barbara.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like that.</p>
<p>Some people are, there are angels that walk among us.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this famous prayer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, God, there&rsquo;s an old saying,</p>
<p>one of the hardest tests there are in life</p>
<p>is to be given a lot of money.</p>
<p>And you see it happens with people that win the lottery</p>
<p>or whatever, or NFL football players</p>
<p>after their career&rsquo;s over, they&rsquo;re broke, right?</p>
<p>And I was like, God, please test me with money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>But in reality, you should never say,</p>
<p>I want what X person has.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re willing to take everything.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll find you won&rsquo;t want to take everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a lot about the altering effects</p>
<p>of fame, of money, of power on people.</p>
<p>It blinds people.</p>
<p>And I wonder about that for myself</p>
<p>because it seems like in themselves,</p>
<p>these are definitely not the goals</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m pretty much afraid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not desirous, and I&rsquo;m definitely afraid</p>
<p>of each of those things, money, fame, and power.</p>
<p>But it seems the dreams I have as consequences</p>
<p>can often have these things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really afraid of becoming something</p>
<p>that would disappoint me when I was younger,</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t recognize.</p>
<p>You know, because change happens gradually.</p>
<p>But are you using yourself as the touchstone</p>
<p>to use the assay amount?</p>
<p>What is your rubric to apprise if you have lived up</p>
<p>to that 12 year old, whatever year old Lex?</p>
<p>How will you know or not know if you&rsquo;ve let yourself down?</p>
<p>Or I always think, live to impress yourself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if I have followers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice, all right, whatever.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hedonic, and it&rsquo;s just never ending</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll always see the next level.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s pretty damn cool</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve gotten to go to these places, the South Pole,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done these things, and I&rsquo;ve made a family,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m able to teleport my values into the future</p>
<p>through my children, and I&rsquo;ve had ideological children.</p>
<p>So by what metric have you not already,</p>
<p>A, impressed yourself, and B, could you let yourself down?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to turn to the therapist.</p>
<p>I think some of it is psychology.</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;m very much just never highly self critical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never happy, never happy with what I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m always happy in the way that you describe,</p>
<p>which is that the Vonnegut thing,</p>
<p>where you just, often during the day, I will feel,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I just remember just eating beef jerky</p>
<p>and being truly happy.</p>
<p>That was just last night, and I have that all the time.</p>
<p>And that, to me, is why, I mean,</p>
<p>that feels to me like a healthy way to live life,</p>
<p>and at least for me, it&rsquo;s the one I really enjoy.</p>
<p>A lot of people tell me that maybe being so self critical,</p>
<p>so hard on yourself, is not a good way to go.</p>
<p>But more and more as I get older,</p>
<p>I realize it&rsquo;s just who I am.</p>
<p>You have to a certain point accept,</p>
<p>this is how I&rsquo;m always going to be this self critical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Oracle of Delphi, right?</p>
<p>You know thyself.</p>
<p>But I want to leave you with one last thing,</p>
<p>which is to say, just on this topic,</p>
<p>you know, it could be different, right?</p>
<p>We could go down to the ocean and get some krill</p>
<p>instead of the 711.</p>
<p>You know, it could be that we have no other taste buds.</p>
<p>And you know, Eric&rsquo;s talked about the four dimensions</p>
<p>of the vibration of your tongue, right?</p>
<p>It could be like there&rsquo;s one,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like, not Memphis barbecue,</p>
<p>whatever you like in your Slim Jim.</p>
<p>It could be something, it could be very boring.</p>
<p>Similarly, what if like that&rsquo;s a clue?</p>
<p>Like what if that&rsquo;s giving us evidence?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another clue.</p>
<p>There are many animals,</p>
<p>most animals have single monocolor vision.</p>
<p>They only see in black and white intensity.</p>
<p>They only have rods and no cones.</p>
<p>We could be like that, but we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Why is that not a clue?</p>
<p>Like if, like God&rsquo;s not going to like hit you over the head</p>
<p>and say like, here I am.</p>
<p>Cause then everybody would believe in him.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s very simplistic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had debates even with like famous atheists,</p>
<p>like Lawrence Krauss.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like self declared militant atheist.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, I don&rsquo;t believe in the same God</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t believe in.</p>
<p>Like some guy in a white beard and a chair,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s infantile.</p>
<p>Like I gave that away a long time ago.</p>
<p>But what if there are clues?</p>
<p>What if Yang Mills theory and you know,</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s equation, like what?</p>
<p>Those are beautiful.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever seen like, you know,</p>
<p>expressed in tensor notation, Einstein&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p>or Maxwell&rsquo;s equations or,</p>
<p>and then Maxwell&rsquo;s equations riding on Einstein&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unbelievably beautiful.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>That we can comprehend it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crack.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s where the light gets in.</p>
<p>And the light is what reveals what&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t believe in God.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a stupid notion.</p>
<p>Like, do I believe in God?</p>
<p>Like sometimes I wonder if God believes in me,</p>
<p>like more than if I believe in,</p>
<p>like he needs Brian Keating.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s like one of my friends is a rapper.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, what would I be doing if I were God?</p>
<p>Exactly what God&rsquo;s doing right now.</p>
<p>Like, you think I know more than God?</p>
<p>Give me a break.</p>
<p>Leaving clues of beauty for these hairless apes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And to see what they do with this.</p>
<p>And then marvel at both the tragedy</p>
<p>of what those apes do to each other</p>
<p>and the rare moments of when they understand deeply</p>
<p>about how the world works.</p>
<p>Brian, you&rsquo;re an incredible human being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan and I&rsquo;m really honored that he was,</p>
<p>first of all, showered me with rocks from the moon.</p>
<p>From space.</p>
<p>Space dust.</p>
<p>The villains.</p>
<p>Crystals, magical crystals, healing crystals.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That you can use for good.</p>
<p>And tell me your story and spend your really valuable time</p>
<p>with me today.</p>
<p>This was amazing.</p>
<p>That was a great pleasure for me, Lex.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Galileo Galilei.</p>
<p>In questions of science, the authority of a thousand</p>
<p>is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
