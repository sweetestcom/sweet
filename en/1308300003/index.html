    <p>Higher Ground and Audible Originals present Michelle Obama, The Light Podcast.</p>
<p>It is such a joy to be with you here tonight for this occasion.</p>
<p>This is a joy. I&rsquo;m going to tell you an interesting thing from my perspective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played a lot of theaters. I go someplace and everyone&rsquo;s excited to see me, okay?</p>
<p>Everybody in the crowd&rsquo;s there because they wanted to see me.</p>
<p>This is‚Äîthanks, two people.</p>
<p>Oh, my parents are here. That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>This is different. This is a one-time, one-time occasion where nobody&rsquo;s here to see me,</p>
<p>and I could not be happier about that.</p>
<p>I was getting my makeup done. They put some makeup on me because I&rsquo;m the whitest man in America,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a good thing, and they&rsquo;re putting makeup on me.</p>
<p>And the woman said, what do you think? And I said, no one&rsquo;s going to be looking at me tonight.</p>
<p>And I was very happy to be right.</p>
<p>I am thrilled and honored to be a part of this tonight for this incredible book,</p>
<p>The Light We Carry.</p>
<p>And who better to talk to about this book than the esteemed author.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get her out here.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Michelle Obama!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Conan, I am happy to see you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to see you.</p>
<p>Thank you. Okay.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re up to three people right now.</p>
<p>Hey, everyone. This is Michelle Obama, and welcome to The Light Podcast.</p>
<p>No matter how young or how old we are, there&rsquo;s probably something that leaves us feeling like we&rsquo;re out of place.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the color of our skin or the shape of our nose.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the accent we speak with or the way we worship.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re a strong-willed black girl who towers above her classmates, like me when I was in high school.</p>
<p>Or maybe you&rsquo;re a gangly, fire-engined, red-haired jokester with unique dance moves.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my friend, Conan O&rsquo;Brien.</p>
<p>Look, I like to kid him, but there&rsquo;s no one better than Conan to talk with about a topic like this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not just funny, he&rsquo;s thoughtful and perceptive, and he has a huge heart.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve known each other for years now, and our friendship reflects that.</p>
<p>When we get together, it&rsquo;s not just superficial small talk.</p>
<p>I trust and respect his instincts about people and life generally, and I believe the feelings mutual.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so comfortable being candid with one another.</p>
<p>When we met up for this conversation, the weather was dreadful.</p>
<p>It was dreary, cold, and pouring rain.</p>
<p>And yet, like he always does, Conan brought enough light to warm the entire theater.</p>
<p>And I have a feeling you&rsquo;ll feel some of that too.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>This is an absolute joy. It&rsquo;s so nice to see you. You make me happy every time I see you.</p>
<p>I think you have that effect on people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had some dark times recently in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>And you are doing your best, as you say, to get your light out there.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a noble thing, and thank you very much for doing that.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing this experience with me.</p>
<p>I told you, we were chatting a little before the show, and I revealed that this was a surprise to me, and it shouldn&rsquo;t have been.</p>
<p>But I read the book, The Light We Carry, and there were so many things in the book that I could relate to.</p>
<p>You know what resonated with me is that you talk a lot about growing up, feeling different, feeling other.</p>
<p>And a lot of people would first maybe go to a race.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re talking about is beyond that, includes that, but goes beyond it because height was an issue for you?</p>
<p>That was one of the first‚Äîmost people would think I would talk about race in this chapter of feeling different or feeling invisible.</p>
<p>But I wanted to make sure that the definition of differentness was broad because so many people feel it.</p>
<p>And the first time I felt it was because I grew up in a black community.</p>
<p>I was an other in my home, and that didn&rsquo;t happen until I went away to college.</p>
<p>But I was the tall girl, and I don&rsquo;t know how many people are the tall girls in the world, right?</p>
<p>So that whole thing, you grow up, nothing fits you, clothes weren&rsquo;t made for you, everything.</p>
<p>I spent my life tugging on my pants sleeve.</p>
<p>You know, I tried to make sure because my parents never let me slouch because they were like, uh-uh, you know, sit up.</p>
<p>And I took dance to make sure that I had decent posture.</p>
<p>You know, my mom made all my clothes, and it was just like, oh, Lord, please, let&rsquo;s not go to the Butterwick session.</p>
<p>She was like, everything.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, oh, you don&rsquo;t‚ÄîI can make that.</p>
<p>And I was like, Ma, no, no.</p>
<p>I just want to go to a department store and get the jeans with the tag, with the Gloria Vanderbilt label.</p>
<p>I just desperately wanted to be like the girls I saw, the peppy cheerleaders, and I used that.</p>
<p>And you shared that you were also‚Äî</p>
<p>Yeah, I did, too.</p>
<p>I never had pants that fit me.</p>
<p>The tallest.</p>
<p>And I can prove it because I had a friend who was an artist, and he did a sketch of me when I was in high school that I think they have.</p>
<p>And it depicted me.</p>
<p>This is long before I&rsquo;m a famous person or anything.</p>
<p>And he includes my pants don&rsquo;t fit, my feet are way too big.</p>
<p>And your feet.</p>
<p>It was a mess.</p>
<p>Look at those feet.</p>
<p>And also, when I was a kid growing up, I had‚Äîstop laughing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here to lift people up.</p>
<p>I really think this crowd is bullying me right now, I think.</p>
<p>But when I was a kid, I was the only one in my family that had bright orange hair, and my mother would cut it in a bowl.</p>
<p>But it was just that business of going straight across the head, and so I hated having freckles.</p>
<p>And I hated having orange hair.</p>
<p>And I remembered seeing people on TV who had black hair, you know, piled up high, like the guy on Hawaii Five-0.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d see people on TV and I&rsquo;d go, like, that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re supposed to look, not like this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, one of the challenges in this world, particularly in this country, when there are so few definitions of what it can mean to be human, you know.</p>
<p>And particularly in this country, we fall for it, you know.</p>
<p>We fall for the okey-doke, because if somebody can look the part, and it&rsquo;s usually they&rsquo;re white, they&rsquo;re male, they&rsquo;re in a business suit.</p>
<p>They act like they have money and power.</p>
<p>And that is the definition of, you know, who matters, who belongs, right?</p>
<p>And I start with height, because so many of us in this country feel othered.</p>
<p>We feel different.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see ourselves reflected anywhere.</p>
<p>And I hear from young people who talk about feeling invisible, because they don&rsquo;t see any signs of themselves anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>And that is an eerie feeling.</p>
<p>I first felt it when I went away to Princeton, where at the time when I went, not only were there a handful of black people, but there weren&rsquo;t many women.</p>
<p>It was only, when you were there, it was only 12 years after.</p>
<p>That it had been co-ed.</p>
<p>Only 12 years after Princeton had gone co-ed, which is nothing.</p>
<p>So I had never been in an environment where there was no sign of me.</p>
<p>There were no black people on the walls.</p>
<p>There were no black people in the town.</p>
<p>We walked around campus.</p>
<p>I was an oddity.</p>
<p>And that was the first time I realized there are whole parts of this country that don&rsquo;t even know I exist.</p>
<p>You know, they have never seen somebody like me.</p>
<p>So no wonder they&rsquo;re crossing the street when a black co-ed comes down the street.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never seen me before.</p>
<p>And so many of us are living in a world where we feel othered.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important for us to tell our stories.</p>
<p>To put more stories of mattering out there.</p>
<p>I write about, you know, women now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got so many role models.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve got Serena now out there.</p>
<p>I never knew.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a Serena to look up to.</p>
<p>Somebody who was beautiful, strong, fast, outspoken.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t a role model for me.</p>
<p>I write about Mindy Kaling now.</p>
<p>Rewriting the whole story of who belongs in television.</p>
<p>Ali Wong, who&rsquo;s one of my favorite comedians.</p>
<p>All of those women, their representation is so important</p>
<p>because one of my tools for being visible</p>
<p>is that I have to stop measuring myself in other people&rsquo;s mirrors.</p>
<p>You know, I have to get out of their mirrors and start,</p>
<p>I had to start telling myself that I was enough.</p>
<p>And I try to tell young kids this.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t wait for somebody else to see you.</p>
<p>Because just like at Princeton, they didn&rsquo;t even know I was there.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even know to look for me.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want kids waiting to get their visibility from somebody else.</p>
<p>That starts in here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the work of redefining what matters.</p>
<p>And my role model for doing that was my father.</p>
<p>A man who had every reason to feel invisible.</p>
<p>He was a black working class man in segregated Chicago</p>
<p>who had MS and walked with crutches.</p>
<p>He had every reason to feel small in the world and feel unseen.</p>
<p>But my father carried himself with a light,</p>
<p>a sense of pride and dignity.</p>
<p>Even I tell the story of how sometimes my father would trip and fall.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing more frightening</p>
<p>than to see the person who is feeding you</p>
<p>literally fall to the ground, a grown man,</p>
<p>and the vulnerability that you feel in that time.</p>
<p>But my father, he learned, he would have to learn to laugh that off,</p>
<p>get up, and keep moving.</p>
<p>And so when I start feeling invisible,</p>
<p>I think about the light that my father has demonstrated for me,</p>
<p>the visibility that he&rsquo;s seen from within.</p>
<p>And that has been a tool for me throughout my life.</p>
<p>I have stopped waiting for people to see me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve stopped waiting for there to be a role model</p>
<p>in order for me to see and appreciate myself.</p>
<p>I have to change the definition of who matters.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why representation and storytelling is important.</p>
<p>Why do I write these books? I have thoughts in my head.</p>
<p>But I think the more stories that I can tell</p>
<p>about a little black girl from the south side of Chicago</p>
<p>who is working class, there&rsquo;s going to be some kid out there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to see themselves in the way that I didn&rsquo;t have somebody to see.</p>
<p>And it is important for us to put our stories out there.</p>
<p>I want little girls like this little beautiful girl right there.</p>
<p>Yes, you.</p>
<p>Yes, you.</p>
<p>To know that your story matters.</p>
<p>That I see you with hair like mine and that beautiful smile,</p>
<p>and you belong.</p>
<p>And I want you to practice that message now every day</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not like me at 58 wondering,</p>
<p>how am I good enough when I know I doggone am good enough?</p>
<p>applause</p>
<p>Fashion is at the center of my life.</p>
<p>I have been interested in fashion since junior high.</p>
<p>I had a teacher that used to call me Gloria Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m very committed.</p>
<p>I would say that on a list of ten, it&rsquo;s nine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to me.</p>
<p>I have a hair care company encouraging women to accept their natural hair.</p>
<p>My mother relaxed my hair when I was seven years old, right?</p>
<p>And so for the longest time, I didn&rsquo;t even know what my natural hair pattern was.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that it was as curly as it is.</p>
<p>Making that transition, transitioning from relaxing my hair,</p>
<p>straightening my hair, you know, holding to a European standard</p>
<p>and embracing, you know, my natural curls.</p>
<p>So in that process, there was a lot of learning.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there was a time in the workplace where it wasn&rsquo;t acceptable</p>
<p>to wear your hair in an afro or to wear braids.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just happy that, you know, at this point in life,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re at a time where a lot of African-American women are accepting their hair.</p>
<p>And also, too, that we have legislation that, you know, gives us safe spaces</p>
<p>in order for us to be our natural selves.</p>
<p>You mentioned your mother.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an incredible person.</p>
<p>You and I did an event together.</p>
<p>This was before COVID.</p>
<p>And there was some situation where I found myself in a room</p>
<p>with a bunch of people, and your mom&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s the most serene person, completely, completely unaffected</p>
<p>by your success.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s even an understatement.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, just this very zen, yeah, this is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Such a‚Äîthat is a testament, because I think it&rsquo;s very rare when you‚Äî</p>
<p>in my career, I&rsquo;ve seen many people who I&rsquo;ve been close to</p>
<p>go through the gauntlet of fame and the glare, and they change.</p>
<p>A lot of people change, and some people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Some people are always themselves.</p>
<p>And your mom seemed like‚Äî</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>She just‚Äîand she lived in the White House and just thought,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;d rather be at home, I guess.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>And she wouldn&rsquo;t‚Äîwe&rsquo;d have to beg her to partake in anything,</p>
<p>to travel abroad.</p>
<p>Why would I want to go to China?</p>
<p>Because it would be a cool trip.</p>
<p>The only thing that would finally‚Äîand we&rsquo;d play this dance all the time.</p>
<p>Because I would always try to travel, do a big trip with the girls,</p>
<p>because I never pulled the girls out of school for anything.</p>
<p>It was like, you are normal kids.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about you.</p>
<p>Go to school.</p>
<p>This security, they&rsquo;re only trying to protect you</p>
<p>because you become a risk to the president.</p>
<p>If you get kidnapped, nobody&rsquo;s thinking about you.</p>
<p>So I have that in me, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re not special.</p>
<p>This is not about you.</p>
<p>This is about your father.</p>
<p>Go to school.</p>
<p>But I would try to plan one trip in the summer,</p>
<p>right before camps and all that started.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been to Venice.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the Pope.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve visited the Queen, who gave the kids a ride.</p>
<p>This was off script, too.</p>
<p>We went to London after our first visit,</p>
<p>and we just went for a regular trip.</p>
<p>And the Queen, Her Majesty, heard that we were there</p>
<p>and invited us over.</p>
<p>Yeah, just like‚Äîjust come over now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that happen.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t call, but the people called the people.</p>
<p>And okay, we thought, okay, we&rsquo;re going to Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>This was after this visit.</p>
<p>This is how kind she was to our family.</p>
<p>So they said, just come by.</p>
<p>Her Majesty wants you to just see the palace.</p>
<p>And nobody was there.</p>
<p>We walk in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s me, the girl&rsquo;s mom, and Mama Kay,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the girl&rsquo;s godmother, who&rsquo;s also a traveling companion.</p>
<p>And the Queen showed us the gold room.</p>
<p>There is a gold room.</p>
<p>A room full of gold, y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>Everything in the palace was like,</p>
<p>this is what we were trying to do in the White House.</p>
<p>The rose garden, our rose garden was like, meh.</p>
<p>Their rose garden, we were in a buggy</p>
<p>riding through the roses forever.</p>
<p>I was like, now this is a rose garden.</p>
<p>She let the kids sit in her car.</p>
<p>I mean, we were there for like an afternoon,</p>
<p>and then they set up tea for us.</p>
<p>And here we&rsquo;re sitting just in some room in the palace,</p>
<p>and who comes down to greet us?</p>
<p>But Her Majesty, just with her purse in her house,</p>
<p>I was like, you do carry that purse everywhere.</p>
<p>You wanted to be like, where are you going?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wondered about that.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with her everywhere.</p>
<p>She came down for a visit.</p>
<p>She had her purse.</p>
<p>And I was like, I hear you.</p>
<p>But anyway, I digress.</p>
<p>Those were the kind of trips.</p>
<p>Those are funny digressions, though.</p>
<p>That was great.</p>
<p>Those are the kind of trips that my mother would be like,</p>
<p>eh, nah, nah, wah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen one gold room.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen them all.</p>
<p>So we went to Rome once, saw the pope.</p>
<p>I think she met two popes, right?</p>
<p>So one of the last trips we took was going to Italy again,</p>
<p>going to Venice.</p>
<p>So the question was, Mom, do you want to come?</p>
<p>Want to come to Italy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Italy.</p>
<p>Why would I want to go again?</p>
<p>Because Venice is different than Rome.</p>
<p>So usually she would only go because in the end I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>the girls need you to go.</p>
<p>Okay, then.</p>
<p>If the girls need me to go, then I&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, ugh, lady, get over yourself.</p>
<p>But anyway, she&rsquo;s not impressed with me.</p>
<p>She still, I say this, my brother,</p>
<p>she still loves him more.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s still that mother that loves her son.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I know you were first lady,</p>
<p>but Craig is just, did you taste his wine?</p>
<p>His wine?</p>
<p>He had the best wine.</p>
<p>And I was like, Mom, we live in the White House.</p>
<p>His wine is not that good.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not that good.</p>
<p>Well, now we&rsquo;re getting to some stuff here.</p>
<p>This is good.</p>
<p>Mothers and their sons.</p>
<p>I am a victim.</p>
<p>So she kept us all grounded in the White House.</p>
<p>And I have a chapter in there because I&rsquo;ve always tried to get</p>
<p>my mom to write a book.</p>
<p>And what do you think she would say?</p>
<p>Nobody wants to hear what I have to say.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, Ma, they do.</p>
<p>They really do.</p>
<p>You have done a lot in this world.</p>
<p>My mom is one of seven.</p>
<p>And this is in the time where I don&rsquo;t think people realize that</p>
<p>women probably had postpartum.</p>
<p>And now looking back and knowing my grandmother,</p>
<p>I was like, my grandmother was depressed.</p>
<p>We always just thought she was snobby, right?</p>
<p>She was tired.</p>
<p>But you didn&rsquo;t, especially as black people,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t recognize that.</p>
<p>She, her mother was very particular about things in the house.</p>
<p>And my mom told the story of how they had this one glass dining</p>
<p>room table in the living room, seven kids.</p>
<p>And they were never allowed to touch the glass table.</p>
<p>But they were forced to get dressed up whenever there was company</p>
<p>and sit dressed up.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
<p>Kids were to be seen and not heard.</p>
<p>And my mother remembered just sitting for hours listening to adults</p>
<p>talk and thinking, these people are so stupid.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not even saying anything.</p>
<p>She said she remembers in her head that they&rsquo;re not even making sense,</p>
<p>but she couldn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>And they couldn&rsquo;t touch the glass table.</p>
<p>So they went years never touching that glass table, seven kids,</p>
<p>never broke until one day one of her mother&rsquo;s friends came over,</p>
<p>sat on the table and broke it.</p>
<p>And my mother cracks up about that story.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, we just laughed and laughed and laughed about it.</p>
<p>But my mother decided then and there that she wasn&rsquo;t going to raise her</p>
<p>kids to be seen and not heard.</p>
<p>My mother was able to parent in a way that was the opposite of what she saw.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people who don&rsquo;t have a certain thing,</p>
<p>we question if we didn&rsquo;t have a dad or we didn&rsquo;t have a mother that saw us</p>
<p>or we didn&rsquo;t live in a perfect household that how can we parent</p>
<p>with what we don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>My mother and father, both who had interesting relationships with their parents,</p>
<p>they did the opposite of what they wanted.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you can learn from the brokenness.</p>
<p>You can learn about what you don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>My parents were brilliant parents.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t come from brilliant parents,</p>
<p>but they worked hard to do the opposite of what was done to them.</p>
<p>So I think we all have the ability with the right set of tools to grow beyond</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>And, you know, I want people to embrace that.</p>
<p>I want parents particularly to understand that you don&rsquo;t have to have stuff</p>
<p>to be a good parent.</p>
<p>You know, don&rsquo;t break your neck trying to,</p>
<p>and I know kids are like, don&rsquo;t tell them that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Do not helicopter them and do not give them a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>If you give them your love and gladness, that&rsquo;s all that they need.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all that they need, even if they say they want more.</p>
<p>My name is Marion Robinson, and I am Michelle&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>She was definitely the person that she is now from the day that I met her.</p>
<p>She was very tenacious and hardworking,</p>
<p>and she always wanted everything perfect.</p>
<p>The story I tell about Michelle is one she hates.</p>
<p>She had a coloring book like all little children have,</p>
<p>and when my husband and I looked at her coloring book,</p>
<p>we saw that each page that had a little mark outside the line was scribbled on,</p>
<p>and she moved on to another picture to color.</p>
<p>It had to be perfect, and that was when she was very little, maybe three, three years old.</p>
<p>And my husband and I ask each other, did you tell her to do that?</p>
<p>And both of us said, I didn&rsquo;t ask her to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>She did homework over and over again.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would even have to ask her to please put that pencil and paper down and relax.</p>
<p>And she did the same thing when she took piano lessons.</p>
<p>She just kept playing the song over and over again.</p>
<p>So that was just her.</p>
<p>You talk about how you witnessed when you met the president, President Obama,</p>
<p>when you met him for the first time and you met his family,</p>
<p>that his family dynamic was different from yours.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They were huggers. Is that right?</p>
<p>It was, you know, hugs, and I love you, and I love you.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>It was, you know, hugs, and I love you, and I miss you, and I, you know,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t do that in our house.</p>
<p>I relate to your story.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But, you know, I have a whole chapter on partnering well,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a big question that I get from young couples, especially young women.</p>
<p>How you finding me?</p>
<p>And they see us, and they&rsquo;re like hashtag couples goals.</p>
<p>They see me and Barack, and it&rsquo;s like we all look all hugged up all the time,</p>
<p>and, you know, and we are.</p>
<p>I love him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my boo.</p>
<p>But I share that chapter because I see two, first of all,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t talk enough about the real of marriage, you know,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ve got a lot of young people who don&rsquo;t know how to pick partners,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;re getting married,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what marriage is and how hard it is</p>
<p>because nobody ever shares the truth of it.</p>
<p>But one of the things that makes marriage hard</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re trying to pull two lives together,</p>
<p>two different temperaments, two different ways of being,</p>
<p>and like you said, Barack grew up in Hawaii.</p>
<p>His mother lived abroad, worked abroad,</p>
<p>so they would see each other once a year, you know,</p>
<p>and so I always said he learned to love at a distance,</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re loving at a distance, the words matter, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s all you have are the words, the letters,</p>
<p>and, you know, and hugs,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got to get it all in right there, right here and now.</p>
<p>I grew up the exact opposite.</p>
<p>I grew up on the south side with everybody I&rsquo;ve ever known</p>
<p>within seven blocks of each other.</p>
<p>You know, me and my family lived above my great aunt.</p>
<p>We lived around the corner from my mother&rsquo;s mother,</p>
<p>the woman I told you about who was kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>She, of course, they separated from my grandfather,</p>
<p>who was our favorite.</p>
<p>He lived around the corner from her.</p>
<p>You know, with another aunt,</p>
<p>my father&rsquo;s parents lived maybe ten blocks away.</p>
<p>We saw each other all the time,</p>
<p>and you celebrated everybody&rsquo;s birthday,</p>
<p>seven kids, all these grandkids.</p>
<p>There was a birthday every weekend, you know.</p>
<p>We were just like, I don&rsquo;t need to hug you</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a different way of showing affection,</p>
<p>and when you merge those two ways of being,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole lot of compromise that has to happen</p>
<p>around how you interact,</p>
<p>and it takes work to figure out the balance</p>
<p>of how do I get what I need,</p>
<p>and how does he get what he needs?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s no such thing as 50-50.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never experienced 50-50 in my marriage.</p>
<p>And this, I don&rsquo;t want to have to compromise.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, then you want to live by yourself,</p>
<p>which is fine.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>That is a worthwhile ambition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my daughters to feel like marriage</p>
<p>is the only option for them to be happy.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>If they choose to be married,</p>
<p>then I want them to do the work</p>
<p>to be whole individuals</p>
<p>so that they know what they want,</p>
<p>and they know how to look for another whole individual</p>
<p>to come to the table with.</p>
<p>But I think there are a lot of young girls in particular</p>
<p>who just dream of the wedding.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>They spend more time on Pinterest</p>
<p>with the wish books and the&hellip;</p>
<p>Everybody knows the third dress.</p>
<p>Now everybody wears three dresses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to have the wedding dress,</p>
<p>the reception dress,</p>
<p>and then the after-party dress.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got the pre-engagement</p>
<p>and the bachelorette thing.</p>
<p>And before you know it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve spent $100,000,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even know that dude.</p>
<p>Because guess what young couples don&rsquo;t do?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>Because everybody&rsquo;s trying to not look thirsty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to too many young women</p>
<p>who have been dating dudes they don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not asking questions like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your family like?</p>
<p>How do they show love? Little things.</p>
<p>And I was like, why don&rsquo;t you know that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his mother&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know his mother&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>You guys have been talking.</p>
<p>Does he have a mother?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you ask him if he has a mother?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to tell you something.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t want to look thirsty.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, the thing that I say</p>
<p>is real love is nothing but thirsty.</p>
<p>Barack&hellip;</p>
<p>I knew Barack was the right one</p>
<p>because he wasn&rsquo;t playing any games.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t trying to pretend</p>
<p>like we were dating but weren&rsquo;t, you know?</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t trying to relabel something.</p>
<p>I could count on him to call me back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, if dude&rsquo;s not even calling you back,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<p>Move on to the next one.</p>
<p>He should marry. He should call you back.</p>
<p>He should do what he says.</p>
<p>Same thing for women.</p>
<p>If she&rsquo;s playing games, move on.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t enter a relationship</p>
<p>in game-playing mode.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t enter marriage playing a game.</p>
<p>You have to know who you&rsquo;re dating.</p>
<p>And too many young people</p>
<p>are out here playing it casual</p>
<p>until they get married</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve never practiced</p>
<p>not casual.</p>
<p>And then it gets hard.</p>
<p>And they want to quit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, but it&rsquo;s just been two years.</p>
<p>But if you can&rsquo;t get through</p>
<p>those rough times</p>
<p>and that is all</p>
<p>marriage guarantees you is uncertainty</p>
<p>and difficulty, right?</p>
<p>There is no happily</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>It is impossible.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want young people to&hellip;</p>
<p>First of all, I want them to think harder</p>
<p>before they do marry.</p>
<p>And then once you&rsquo;re in there,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re with somebody you like</p>
<p>and respect,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just hard,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t divorce that.</p>
<p>You work on that.</p>
<p>You work through that</p>
<p>to get to the other side of that.</p>
<p>Because let me tell you,</p>
<p>if you think the grass is greener,</p>
<p>as my mom would always say,</p>
<p>every man, you&rsquo;re going to leave him</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going to have the same issues.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just going to get readjusted to that.</p>
<p>I tell the story of my mom</p>
<p>when I would go through&hellip;</p>
<p>She told me this.</p>
<p>She would go through a period every spring</p>
<p>when we were little</p>
<p>where she would think about</p>
<p>leaving my dad.</p>
<p>And it would be right around spring</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d do her spring curlining</p>
<p>and open up the windows</p>
<p>and let the fresh air in</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s thinking,</p>
<p>this is the time I&rsquo;m going to leave your father.</p>
<p>She tells me this later</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, what?</p>
<p>And I would sit out in my mind and think,</p>
<p>no, you know,</p>
<p>I love this man, I love this life.</p>
<p>It was like she did an annual</p>
<p>recommitment to</p>
<p>through herself,</p>
<p>unbeknownst to my father,</p>
<p>thank God.</p>
<p>He had no idea the whole time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hanging by a thread.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But I think we have to share more</p>
<p>of the real of marriage</p>
<p>so that young people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t run away when it gets hard.</p>
<p>And I think some women feel like</p>
<p>they have to settle for casual</p>
<p>because of the</p>
<p>numbers game.</p>
<p>I know for black women</p>
<p>you start</p>
<p>doing the math if you&rsquo;re looking for your</p>
<p>black king</p>
<p>and the numbers are low and our numbers</p>
<p>are high. I see too many women</p>
<p>who are settling for less</p>
<p>and less and less.</p>
<p>And I know</p>
<p>all the men out here, I&rsquo;m about to</p>
<p>tell them, don&rsquo;t do it. Keep your</p>
<p>bar high.</p>
<p>Be okay</p>
<p>with being alone</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what has</p>
<p>to be. I mean, I wish people</p>
<p>find love but</p>
<p>I have seen too many people in bad</p>
<p>relationships and that&rsquo;s some of</p>
<p>the loneliest feeling you can be</p>
<p>is to be with somebody that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t love you the way you</p>
<p>deserve to be loved.</p>
<p>I think I speak for everybody here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>talk about thirsty, I&rsquo;ve been so thirsty for optimism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really thirsty</p>
<p>for optimism and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very tired. We talked</p>
<p>about this, we have a</p>
<p>we have a</p>
<p>news cycle that&rsquo;s run by an algorithm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s constantly telling us</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all over, we&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know.</p>
<p>Every year is worse than the next one. This is the worst</p>
<p>year ever. And then the next year</p>
<p>is the worst year ever.</p>
<p>I find it</p>
<p>and I think it really gets to these young</p>
<p>people. It does. Because my</p>
<p>perspective is different. My perspective is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much good and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much positivity</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many, I mean, I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>impressed with the young people I meet.</p>
<p>I am too.</p>
<p>But I think what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you earned the right a long time ago to</p>
<p>if you wanted to just say I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>sit at home and watch</p>
<p>Netflix and</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>you earned that right</p>
<p>a long time ago. You did your part</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still out here and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>exposing your frailty</p>
<p>and your vulnerability</p>
<p>and that is a brave thing to do</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an amazing gift you&rsquo;re giving</p>
<p>people. So on behalf of everybody here, thank you</p>
<p>very much. Ladies</p>
<p>and gentlemen, Michelle Obama!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Being in a relationship</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t easy. It takes work</p>
<p>real work</p>
<p>to find any semblance</p>
<p>of success or stability.</p>
<p>And the truth is</p>
<p>being single isn&rsquo;t easy either.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always wondering</p>
<p>where or when you might meet</p>
<p>that special someone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting all those questions from parents</p>
<p>and aunties about when you&rsquo;re going to couple up</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t get me started</p>
<p>on the apps and texting</p>
<p>and sliding into people&rsquo;s DMs.</p>
<p>So all I can</p>
<p>say is that whether you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>a relationship right now or not</p>
<p>you deserve</p>
<p>someone who treats you</p>
<p>with a baseline of dignity</p>
<p>and respect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the foundation that</p>
<p>has to exist before you can start</p>
<p>diving deeper into your own</p>
<p>vulnerabilities and</p>
<p>intertwining your lives</p>
<p>and ultimately</p>
<p>leaning on one another in a</p>
<p>way that can be truly</p>
<p>beautiful.</p>
<p>And really, that gets back to this</p>
<p>idea of belonging that</p>
<p>Conan and I also talked about.</p>
<p>A lot of us are hoping</p>
<p>to find not just a partner</p>
<p>who makes us feel understood</p>
<p>and accepted,</p>
<p>but also others who welcome</p>
<p>us with open arms.</p>
<p>Family, friends,</p>
<p>colleagues, and yes,</p>
<p>even a talk show host.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so grateful</p>
<p>to explore all of that and more</p>
<p>with Conan. Thanks again</p>
<p>for listening. Talk to you again</p>
<p>soon.</p>
