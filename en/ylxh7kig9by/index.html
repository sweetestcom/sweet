video i&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about something called ascites ascites is a condition where someone&amp;rsquo;s belly is protruded it&amp;rsquo;s usually not fat it&amp;rsquo;s mostly fluid the latin word for ascites is bag like because it looks like this bag that&amp;rsquo;s hanging from your abdomen now the appearance is usually protruded like a basketball it&amp;rsquo;s usually not sagging too much it&amp;rsquo;s kind of sticking out and if you tap on one side you&amp;rsquo;ll see kind of a ripple on the other side and this is because it&amp;rsquo;s filled with fluid because the liver is leaking certain fluid into a sac around the abdominal organs the most common cause of ascites is cirrhosis this is a condition where the liver has so much scar tissue it&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming the liver function and now the liver can&amp;rsquo;t do its thing and so it&amp;rsquo;s leaking fluid into the gut now there&amp;rsquo;s other causes to cirrhosis as well you can have cancer pancreatitis heart disease or even tb but most people with this condition um have cirrhosis now in past videos i talked about the guy on the beach with the speedo with this protruded belly he&amp;rsquo;s actually skinny everywhere but his belly is protruding that kind of gives you a visual of what i&amp;rsquo;m talking about now there&amp;rsquo;s other associated symptoms that come with this we have portal hypertension which you have high blood pressure in the venous part of your body edema in the lower legs so let&amp;rsquo;s say you press into your lower leg and it leaves an indentation okay it&amp;rsquo;s called pitting edema you may have spider veins around your abdomen or you might have a lot of bruising in the lower legs you might have gynecomastia which is breast tissue in men that&amp;rsquo;s not normal you may even vomit blood as one of the side effects now another common symptom involves your brain where you have too much ammonia building up and that can create a lot of confusion and cognitive dysfunction and several remedies for that would be number one taking lactolose sauerkraut can help reduce ammonia from the body and consuming more vegetables would be a good thing making sure you don&amp;rsquo;t consume excessive amounts of protein have a lesser amount and taking l-glutamine can help now what&amp;rsquo;s interesting when i was in practice i had medical doctors come in as patients and i always ask them what is the typical treatment for societies medically and they would say a drainage so they would drain the fluid they would put the patient on a low salt diet they would give them a diuretic and many times they would have to be on the liver transplant list because other than these typical treatments there was no other treatment and i would always say like why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you support the liver with maybe something natural but they&amp;rsquo;re just not trained in these natural remedies so if i had ascites this is what i would do i would immediately start intermittent fasting because fasting can help reduce liver enzymes it can help improve liver function it can help decrease the growth of fibrous tissue and scar tissue lessening the intensity of cirrhosis i would also get on something called milk thistle which can be very hepatoprotective which means it protects the cells of the liver it can also reduce inflammation as well i would also get on vitamin e which is the most powerful antioxidant when it comes down to reducing oxidation free radical damage of various tissues as well as being anti-fibrotic so it slows down inflammation and slows down the process of the liver developing fibrous tissue and scar tissue the type of vitamin e that you take is very important i would only recommend taking tocotrinols not the tocopherols it&amp;rsquo;s going to be 50 times more potent the next thing i would take would be selenium selenium is one of the best antioxidants for the liver and i would definitely also go low carb because high carb creates more oxidation more scar tissue all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if

called ascites ascites is a condition where  </p><p>someone&rsquo;s belly is protruded it&rsquo;s usually not 
fat it&rsquo;s mostly fluid the latin word for ascites  </p><p>is bag like because it looks like this bag that&rsquo;s 
hanging from your abdomen now the appearance is  </p><p>usually protruded like a basketball it&rsquo;s usually 
not sagging too much it&rsquo;s kind of sticking out  </p><p>and if you tap on one side you&rsquo;ll see 
kind of a ripple on the other side  </p><p>and this is because it&rsquo;s filled with fluid 
because the liver is leaking certain fluid  </p><p>into a sac around the abdominal organs the 
most common cause of ascites is cirrhosis  </p><p>this is a condition where the liver has so much 
scar tissue it&rsquo;s overwhelming the liver function  </p><p>and now the liver can&rsquo;t do its thing and so 
it&rsquo;s leaking fluid into the gut now there&rsquo;s  </p><p>other causes to cirrhosis as well you can have 
cancer pancreatitis heart disease or even tb  </p><p>but most people with this condition um have 
cirrhosis now in past videos i talked about  </p><p>the guy on the beach with the speedo with this 
protruded belly he&rsquo;s actually skinny everywhere  </p><p>but his belly is protruding that kind of gives 
you a visual of what i&rsquo;m talking about now there&rsquo;s  </p><p>other associated symptoms that come with this 
we have portal hypertension which you have high  </p><p>blood pressure in the venous part of your body 
edema in the lower legs so let&rsquo;s say you press  </p><p>into your lower leg and it leaves an indentation 
okay it&rsquo;s called pitting edema you may have spider  </p><p>veins around your abdomen or you might have a 
lot of bruising in the lower legs you might have  </p><p>gynecomastia which is breast tissue in men that&rsquo;s 
not normal you may even vomit blood as one of the  </p><p>side effects now another common symptom involves 
your brain where you have too much ammonia  </p><p>building up and that can create a lot of confusion 
and cognitive dysfunction and several remedies  </p><p>for that would be number one taking lactolose 
sauerkraut can help reduce ammonia from the body  </p><p>and consuming more vegetables would be a good 
thing making sure you don&rsquo;t consume excessive  </p><p>amounts of protein have a lesser amount and taking 
l-glutamine can help now what&rsquo;s interesting when i  </p><p>was in practice i had medical doctors come in 
as patients and i always ask them what is the  </p><p>typical treatment for societies medically and they 
would say a drainage so they would drain the fluid  </p><p>they would put the patient on a low salt diet 
they would give them a diuretic and many times  </p><p>they would have to be on the liver transplant list 
because other than these typical treatments there  </p><p>was no other treatment and i would always 
say like why wouldn&rsquo;t you support the liver  </p><p>with maybe something natural but they&rsquo;re just 
not trained in these natural remedies so if  </p><p>i had ascites this is what i would do i would 
immediately start intermittent fasting because  </p><p>fasting can help reduce liver enzymes it 
can help improve liver function it can help  </p><p>decrease the growth of fibrous tissue and scar 
tissue lessening the intensity of cirrhosis  </p><p>i would also get on something called milk 
thistle which can be very hepatoprotective  </p><p>which means it protects the cells of the 
liver it can also reduce inflammation as  </p><p>well i would also get on vitamin e which is the 
most powerful antioxidant when it comes down to  </p><p>reducing oxidation free radical damage of 
various tissues as well as being anti-fibrotic  </p><p>so it slows down inflammation and slows down the 
process of the liver developing fibrous tissue  </p><p>and scar tissue the type of vitamin e that you 
take is very important i would only recommend  </p><p>taking tocotrinols not the tocopherols it&rsquo;s going 
to be 50 times more potent the next thing i would  </p><p>take would be selenium selenium is one of the best 
antioxidants for the liver and i would definitely  </p><p>also go low carb because high carb creates more 
oxidation more scar tissue all right thanks for  </p><p>watching and i will see you in the next video hey 
before you go if you&rsquo;re benefiting from any of my  </p><p>content i would love to hear about your success
