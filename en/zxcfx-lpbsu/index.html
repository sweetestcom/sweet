<p>hi Dr big</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>um when I do strict keto I develop keto</p>
<p>rash I have had it at least three times</p>
<p>now possibly four it always starts on my</p>
<p>chest</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s itchy it&rsquo;s red it works its way up</p>
<p>my neck</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m not doing strict keto at the</p>
<p>moment</p>
<p>um but I would like to because I I get</p>
<p>the benefits from doing strict keto I</p>
<p>would like to know could you suggest</p>
<p>something I could do different before</p>
<p>going on strict keto again to prevent it</p>
<p>from happening</p>
<p>so you found when you did strict keto</p>
<p>you got the rash is that correct yes</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>um have you taken the B vitamins yet</p>
<p>I do have them I don&rsquo;t take them all the</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>typically that is a vitamin B2</p>
<p>deficiency so what I would recommend is</p>
<p>taking</p>
<p>more of the B2 or the B complex because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll make your the mitochondria do</p>
<p>better and they&rsquo;ll have um less of those</p>
<p>skin issues and then let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example you do that and you still have</p>
<p>this problem</p>
<p>um I would</p>
<p>take a look at what foods you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>and anything out of the ordinary that</p>
<p>you normally don&rsquo;t eat that potentially</p>
<p>could be an allergy or some type of</p>
<p>reaction are you eating anything out of</p>
<p>the ordinary on keto</p>
<p>no I don&rsquo;t eat anything out of the</p>
<p>ordinary I do restrict myself on</p>
<p>cuddly increase the fats a bit but but</p>
<p>nothing that I can put my mind to that I</p>
<p>eat different</p>
<p>okay and do you um</p>
<p>do you have anything going on with your</p>
<p>digestion constipation or anything like</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um at the moment I do have a bit of</p>
<p>bathing I must admit</p>
<p>which is unusual for me</p>
<p>do you have any idea what that can come</p>
<p>from or you like have you ever noticed</p>
<p>like wow when I eat this I bloat more</p>
<p>eat carbs I definitely noticed the</p>
<p>bloating</p>
<p>um like I said I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>keto at</p>
<p>them so I do not have a rash at the</p>
<p>moment</p>
<p>um yeah okay</p>
<p>yeah the the main reason for the keto</p>
<p>rash is a is a B2 deficiency</p>
<p>um you could probably just get some of</p>
<p>that and start taking it</p>
<p>um as well as you know maybe it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>B complex</p>
<p>um try to find a natural source uh</p>
<p>versus synthetic but that should the</p>
<p>demand for B vitamins does go up a bit</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on keto so let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into this with a deficiency</p>
<p>already and then it&rsquo;s kind of magnified</p>
<p>now if someone has a severe</p>
<p>B2 deficiency they had this condition</p>
<p>called pellegra and it definitely is a</p>
<p>severe rash you don&rsquo;t have that but</p>
<p>there could be some really minor like</p>
<p>subclinical deficiency of B2 which can</p>
<p>which affects the skin so that I would</p>
<p>do that</p>
<p>um as a first thing and um</p>
<p>um and then let me know if that helps</p>
<p>you okay yeah I will try it thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome all right well thanks so</p>
<p>much for your great um call there Kylie</p>
<p>and uh as with every guest we&rsquo;d love to</p>
<p>hear back from you folks after uh some</p>
<p>time and see if you found a remedy and</p>
<p>you know how uh your joy of living has</p>
<p>increased with all these great</p>
<p>recommendations so thanks again Kylie</p>
<p>for that now after that cheerful news I</p>
<p>have to give the audience some uh some</p>
<p>not so good news there is no true false</p>
<p>questions today they all there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no rolling of the dice in 50 50</p>
<p>of getting it right so this is going to</p>
<p>require some deep research from our</p>
<p>audience which they&rsquo;re always willing to</p>
<p>do so why don&rsquo;t we kick it off with the</p>
<p>first of five very difficult questions</p>
<p>all right so uh which nutrient helps</p>
<p>decrease the need for Sleep the most</p>
<p>all right climb on that folks and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go right over I&rsquo;ll go ahead did you say</p>
<p>something cool the goal would be to</p>
<p>um sleep the least possible and actually</p>
<p>be rejuvenated you know versus like 10</p>
<p>hours so um there is one</p>
<p>one vitamin that can help you greatly</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>your sleep and so what would that be all</p>
<p>right well I&rsquo;m in suspense with the rest</p>
<p>of you okay go to social media rashimi</p>
<p>from YouTube what would you recommend</p>
<p>for someone with an acoustic neuroma who</p>
<p>is trying a 21 day fast to treat it is</p>
<p>that too much to ask does that make</p>
<p>sense Don</p>
<p>well um</p>
<p>those neuromas can be usually related to</p>
<p>viral in nature so they can come out</p>
<p>um when you&rsquo;re under stress</p>
<p>and some people even like surgically</p>
<p>remove neuromas and it&rsquo;s just so painful</p>
<p>the whole thing but what I would do is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>how do you keep the virus deep in</p>
<p>remission from from not popping out</p>
<p>keeping the stress low as possible as</p>
<p>far as</p>
<p>amino acids go</p>
<p>L-lysine tends to help put it back in</p>
<p>remission to a certain degree</p>
<p>and also avoiding arginine but what I</p>
<p>would do if I use I would just focus on</p>
<p>keeping your stress down as much as</p>
<p>possible to deal with this neuroma which</p>
<p>is um can be very very uncomfortable</p>
<p>wow well thank you I had never heard of</p>
<p>such a thing uh I have heard of this</p>
<p>Ronnie from YouTube can an inflamed</p>
<p>spleen be helped by Keto</p>
<p>well what&rsquo;s amazing about keto and going</p>
<p>along with that fasting is that you can</p>
<p>um greatly support the immune system the</p>
<p>immune system does better on ketones but</p>
<p>when you add fast if you were to add</p>
<p>like a 72 hour fast</p>
<p>um you may not know this but you</p>
<p>literally grow a new immune system to a</p>
<p>certain degree so you&rsquo;re growing</p>
<p>through stem cells you&rsquo;re really kicking</p>
<p>that immune system in high gear and so</p>
<p>if you combine fasting with</p>
<p>um with keto I think you can greatly</p>
<p>support your immune system to a very</p>
<p>high level</p>
<p>all right very good and here&rsquo;s a plea</p>
<p>from Anita from YouTube you are my last</p>
<p>and only hope she states due to a</p>
<p>hysterectomy I am now in menopause I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been on a strict keto and Aya for three</p>
<p>years but nothing seems to help with my</p>
<p>high LDL levels</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of pressure on me</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;ll take it I&rsquo;ll take it so um</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>you should go get an advanced lipid</p>
<p>profile test that measures the particle</p>
<p>size</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s two types of LDL there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a particles that are like large</p>
<p>buoyant and there&rsquo;s a small dense ones</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing keto I would bet you</p>
<p>anything that if you did that advanced</p>
<p>profile you would find that the um</p>
<p>that LDL was way more large buoyant just</p>
<p>like my wife she had high LDL on keto</p>
<p>and then we did the advanced profile and</p>
<p>believe it or not it was um</p>
<p>the small dents which are more</p>
<p>pathogenic were very very low and the</p>
<p>large buoyant were very high and so</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um she&rsquo;s consuming a bit more fat you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have more cholesterol that has</p>
<p>to be transported through the body</p>
<p>because the LDL low density lipoproteins</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re proteins that contain</p>
<p>cholesterol so they&rsquo;re little shuttles</p>
<p>and if the large ones don&rsquo;t penetrate</p>
<p>the arteries like the small dense ones</p>
<p>and so as long as you&rsquo;re avoiding the</p>
<p>carbs and you have high LDL</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a big concern and so I have a</p>
<p>if at all from my viewpoint there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other indicators you should you should</p>
<p>watch my videos on that well I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to get in too deeply to that but</p>
<p>just get the advanced lipid profile then</p>
<p>watch my videos on the two different</p>
<p>types of LDL wow well I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>piggyback on that so doc I have heavy</p>
<p>cream in my coffee which I like in my</p>
<p>HDL or my my LDL is a little high is</p>
<p>that so I might be suffering from the</p>
<p>same phenomena right should I get that</p>
<p>test it sounds like it</p>
<p>I think you should because there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a lot of um</p>
<p>false information and incomplete</p>
<p>information when you get into the area</p>
<p>of cholesterol</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that is um</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re on Keating keto</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do a whole seminar but</p>
<p>the point is that you should get the</p>
<p>advanced slipper profile and then get</p>
<p>that data because I to explain it takes</p>
<p>about five minutes and</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really we don&rsquo;t have that time</p>
<p>for that right now so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll cover on that</p>
<p>topic all right but I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>a video I think this is a perfect segue</p>
<p>into it letting people know that they</p>
<p>can download a Magic app for both IOS</p>
<p>and Android and get all that stuff in a</p>
<p>very organized fashion so make sure you</p>
<p>download that today folks it&rsquo;s free so</p>
<p>why not</p>
<p>and also free is our great collection of</p>
<p>quiz questions the first of which ask</p>
<p>which nutrient helps decrease the need</p>
<p>for Sleep mostly</p>
<p>and our audience 55 of them uh say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>magnesium 15 say it&rsquo;s vitamin B1 uh 15</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s k2d3 and 15 say it&rsquo;s vitamin E</p>
<p>by the way Terry our producer admonished</p>
<p>me for saying 50 instead of 55 watts and</p>
<p>I challenged him I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the math here I think they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get too disgusted by that but I read it</p>
<p>correctly this morning and that</p>
<p>hopefully adds up to adds up to 100 do</p>
<p>we have any winners doctor</p>
<p>not this time not this time um but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing like B1 does help with</p>
<p>that excessive thinking right excessive</p>
<p>stress that helps you sleep and and</p>
<p>these other vitamins that you said do</p>
<p>help sleep but there&rsquo;s one specifically</p>
<p>that decreases the need for sleep and</p>
<p>that would be vitamin b12. and so if</p>
<p>someone has like this situation where</p>
<p>they just can&rsquo;t wake up in the morning</p>
<p>they have to get you know I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>eight nine ten ten hours of sleep and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still not refreshed That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>classic B12 deficiency or let&rsquo;s say um</p>
<p>it takes them until two or three o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>before they get tired in the middle of</p>
<p>night that&rsquo;s the B12 deficiency and you</p>
<p>might even want to if you have jet lag</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about vitamin um vitamin D</p>
<p>but B12 is a really good one to take</p>
<p>especially right before bed to reset</p>
<p>that circadian wave because B12 is</p>
<p>intimately involved in the creation of</p>
<p>melatonin so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t neglect your B12 if you have sleep</p>
<p>issues and</p>
<p>I mean the goal would be to get it down</p>
<p>so you see you only need four hours of</p>
<p>sleep right and you can be very</p>
<p>productive</p>
<p>all right very good well as in addition</p>
<p>to our wonderful uh lovely ladies from</p>
<p>all over the world in Pakistan and in</p>
<p>Australia here&rsquo;s the rest of them and I</p>
<p>think Australia will be mentioned again</p>

<p>later so thanks everybody from all over</p>
<p>the world for how uh you know tuning in</p>
<p>and getting all this great health and no</p>
<p>not advice whatever it is Council what</p>
<p>can we call it check with your doctor</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s just information Food For</p>
<p>Thought how about that there we go Food</p>
<p>For Thought So as</p>
<p>sarri has some food for thought from</p>
<p>Facebook if I&rsquo;m underweight with</p>
<p>autoimmune issues what should my eating</p>
<p>schedule look like</p>
<p>autoimmune you need to do fasting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most powerful thing to do for as an</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory so if you can do one</p>
<p>meal a day and just make sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>complete and don&rsquo;t neglect healthy fats</p>
<p>you need a lot of vitamin D</p>
<p>and depending on where your</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>inflammation is or your autoimmune</p>
<p>disease you&rsquo;d want to you can get more</p>
<p>specifics on like what to take for</p>
<p>example in standard process which is I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not affiliated with that company but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really good for autoimmune if</p>
<p>you actually can support let&rsquo;s say you</p>
<p>have a thyroid problem they have</p>
<p>something called thyrotrophin PMG if you</p>
<p>have an autoimmune with the lungs it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called pneumatrophin PMG so um there are</p>
<p>a series of great things out there I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done videos on it that you can take to</p>
<p>support</p>
<p>specific body tissue problems that are</p>
<p>that you have the self-attack from this</p>
<p>autoimmune condition</p>
<p>all right very good uh well let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s go back to YouTube again my</p>
<p>daughter this is Tiffany my daughter and</p>
<p>I bought your k2d3 supplements to help</p>
<p>with our vertigo can both of us use it</p>
<p>even though we have non-alcoholic fatty</p>
<p>livers</p>
<p>especially but see here&rsquo;s the thing if</p>
<p>you have a fatty liver</p>
<p>it usually takes a little bit more</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>of that vitamin D3 and K2 to work</p>
<p>because um there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a bit of</p>
<p>biochemistry going on the liver to help</p>
<p>you absorb this um this vitamin D so I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;ll definitely help because</p>
<p>vitamin D in general as well as K2 helps</p>
<p>insulin resistance which will then</p>
<p>automatically lower the amount of fat in</p>
<p>the liver so vitamin D is a really good</p>
<p>one for</p>
<p>audience if you&rsquo;ll stand by our leader</p>
<p>has disappeared for a moment oh wait a</p>
<p>minute</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s come back so Dr Berg after a brief</p>
<p>break hear your back</p>
<p>did you hear that last part that I said</p>
<p>uh no you we lost about your last 10</p>
<p>seconds once you recap that I just said</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s receptors for um for</p>
<p>insulin which is related to insulin</p>
<p>resistance in the liver so when you take</p>
<p>vitamin D it actually will help the</p>
<p>liver get rid of fat a little bit better</p>
<p>wonderful that&rsquo;s great okay Tiffany uh</p>
<p>you can take that to the bank now the</p>
<p>poor uh audience cannot take their GPA</p>
<p>to the bank it&rsquo;s been very weak after</p>
<p>that first question so we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>give them a chance for Redemption with</p>
<p>the second question</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>which tissue in the body is least</p>
<p>affected by high blood</p>
<p>sugar called glucose whatever the brain</p>
<p>the eyes</p>
<p>the kidney or the bones which one of</p>
<p>these tissues is the least affected by</p>
<p>high glucose</p>
<p>okay climb on it audience and we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>alone out there there&rsquo;s a few other</p>
<p>folks that want to uh give a shout out</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll give a shout out to and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you Becca Stan Cameroon Dubai Bosnia</p>
<p>herzego uh Bosnia and Herzegovina excuse</p>
<p>me Finland and Costa Risa so welcome as</p>
<p>well and somewhere in this whole mix of</p>
<p>places people live Lucille from YouTube</p>
<p>says she lost 50 pounds oh from cancer I</p>
<p>was about to ring the bell that&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>good thing and I&rsquo;m now underweight I</p>
<p>gained back five pounds then did omad</p>
<p>for three days and lost it again I</p>
<p>believe fasting is the best thing for</p>
<p>treating cancer but how can I get back</p>
<p>to my normal weight boy is that a great</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of those tricky questions</p>
<p>because the more advanced your cancer is</p>
<p>the longer you have to fast</p>
<p>to turn things around if we wait out the</p>
<p>importance of fasting versus keeping</p>
<p>weight on your body</p>
<p>fasting to get rid of cancer outweighs</p>
<p>that greatly so</p>
<p>um personally if I were in your shoes I</p>
<p>would be okay with being extra thin as</p>
<p>long as I was still alive and I was</p>
<p>surviving with this cancer</p>
<p>the the challenge comes in when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>already Skin and Bones and you get</p>
<p>cancer what are you going to do now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always a situation I don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>solution for that other than you know</p>
<p>leverage the protocols that we recommend</p>
<p>um so the the point is that um</p>
<p>I would do this these prolonged fasting</p>
<p>to the point where you know the cancer</p>
<p>is greatly under control</p>
<p>then maybe uh go to one meal a day and</p>
<p>um then still do the periodic prolonged</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>but be very strict about</p>
<p>your lifestyle the type of food you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating the stress</p>
<p>protocols</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t worry about the weight</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re if you if you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>handle something like stage four cancer</p>
<p>you know forget about your weight go go</p>
<p>for long-term fasting</p>
<p>because once you fast the body goes into</p>
<p>this fascinating survival mode where</p>
<p>the cancer does shrink and it does</p>
<p>um you things will improve so</p>
<p>it all depends on the severity if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>mild cancer well then maybe you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to fast as long but it really</p>
<p>depends on what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>well Lucille I think we speak for the</p>
<p>whole audience that our thoughts and</p>
<p>prayers go out to you and we hope that</p>
<p>you kick that thing and I would</p>
<p>certainly love to hear back with some</p>
<p>terrific progress from you so thanks for</p>
<p>touching base and the courage to ask</p>
<p>such questions okay uh and we asked some</p>
<p>questions and the second one of today</p>
<p>was which tissue in the body is at least</p>
<p>affected by high blood sugar the brain</p>
<p>the eyes the kidney or the bones and</p>
<p>audience I&rsquo;m pulling for you 85 percent</p>
<p>of you said are uh it&rsquo;s the bones ten</p>
<p>percent say it&rsquo;s the brain and five</p>
<p>percent say it&rsquo;s the eyes</p>
<p>four tissues that are primarily affected</p>
<p>by high glucose brain and nerve</p>
<p>heart kidney and eyes</p>
<p>so they require a tremendous amount of</p>
<p>metabolism</p>
<p>energy metabolism and oxygen too so</p>
<p>um if we&rsquo;re just comparing this those</p>
<p>tissues the bone would definitely be a</p>
<p>lesser of your problems</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one more</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>kind of um motivation</p>
<p>to keep your blood glucose low to</p>
<p>salvage those four tissues</p>
<p>all right well on the Lighter Side Laura</p>
<p>from Facebook can nutritional yeast</p>
<p>cause kidney stones</p>
<p>um no I highly doubt it because</p>
<p>um kidney stones are a super</p>
<p>um concentrated calcium and most the</p>
<p>time it&rsquo;s oxalates in the urine so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a combination of things there is</p>
<p>definitely a genetic propensity to get</p>
<p>kidney stones if you have that then you</p>
<p>need to work harder at preventing them</p>
<p>and drinking if you just sort of drink</p>
<p>two and a half liters of fluid a day</p>
<p>the chances of you getting</p>
<p>stones are are very very small because</p>
<p>you keep the urine diluted and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no way you can actually form these</p>
<p>Stones another thing is to keep your</p>
<p>citrates high as in lemon lemon juice</p>
<p>every morning in your drink as well as</p>
<p>if you had some supplements like</p>
<p>magnesium or potassium citrate because</p>
<p>citrate will help and then of course if</p>
<p>you happen to eat Foods</p>
<p>high in oxalates like in spinach for</p>
<p>example or almonds then make sure you</p>
<p>have the little maybe cheese there to</p>
<p>get the calcium so the calcium will bind</p>
<p>into the gut and prevent this this</p>
<p>oxalate free oxalates to go into the</p>
<p>blood and actually end up in the urine</p>
<p>so there are all sorts of tricks that</p>
<p>you can do to counter kidney stones but</p>
<p>nutritional yeast is is not going to be</p>
<p>at the top of the list of causing kidney</p>
<p>stones all right very good well a</p>
<p>beautiful representative from Islamabad</p>
<p>Pakistan is next on our Show and her</p>
<p>name is Sabine and Sabine if you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>unmute yourself you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>for your one question in 30 seconds go</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>um I have sibo I have seen you a lot of</p>
<p>videos on sibo and I have low bile salts</p>
<p>as well so I&rsquo;m taking as you said Ginger</p>
<p>and apple cider vinegar and clothes too</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m still having that bloating and</p>
<p>things like that digestive issues</p>
<p>mm-hmm so um are you doing keto um</p>
<p>or or not</p>
<p>no not strict keto</p>
<p>um like I do take rice but I&rsquo;m not on</p>
<p>strict keto okay</p>
<p>assume uh vegetables</p>
<p>yeah I do</p>
<p>pretty good vegetables</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening a small</p>
<p>intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a</p>
<p>situation where you have bacteria in the</p>
<p>wrong place you have it in the small</p>
<p>intestine not the large so that means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting fermentation</p>
<p>in the large a small intestine where it</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be so fermentation produces</p>
<p>bloating and</p>
<p>um you know what those microbes live on</p>
<p>fiber</p>
<p>okay fiber</p>
<p>um and starch like rice</p>
<p>so yeah I know the price</p>
<p>what um what you&rsquo;ll have to do in this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s going to be very easy</p>
<p>in your country because they they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a lot of sweets there</p>
<p>um avoid sugar rice and I would avoid</p>
<p>fiber for a couple months I would do</p>
<p>more of a carnivore</p>
<p>um maybe eggs or fish and not have</p>
<p>anything else even probiotics because</p>
<p>what you want to do is you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>contribute to more fermentation</p>
<p>um so maybe do omad one meal a day have</p>
<p>it protein only and then let</p>
<p>starve off the microbes because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>competing for your nutrition and that</p>
<p>way the microbes will go through it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to take a bile salt</p>
<p>supplement too because the bile salts</p>
<p>probably a lack of that was the reason</p>
<p>why you got in the first place because</p>
<p>normally you have this bile that acts</p>
<p>like a detergent it keeps the microbes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>kind of controlled through the small</p>
<p>intestine</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what you should do and</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;ll be very successful</p>
<p>okay thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome that&rsquo;s great well thank</p>
<p>you Sabine so much and we wish you well</p>
<p>with that and as always hope to hear</p>
<p>back from you with your great success in</p>
<p>getting rid of sibo which sounds awful</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see what should we do here how</p>
<p>about another question Doc and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the next one and the Audience by the way</p>
<p>has redeemed themselves with an 85</p>
<p>percent or last time let&rsquo;s hope they</p>
<p>keep up the pace</p>
<p>all right so um what are the two factors</p>
<p>when</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>let me see here what are the two factors</p>
<p>when the oh okay yeah</p>
<p>what are the two factors when low can</p>
<p>make you feel bad while fasting</p>
<p>okay I think um</p>
<p>um Terry reworded the question so I was</p>
<p>like that sounds kind of interesting oh</p>
<p>Terror two things yeah</p>
<p>okay but that makes sense what are the</p>
<p>two factors when when low can make you</p>
<p>feel bad while fasting okay I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna reword that Steve I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>reword that okay to make it more sense</p>
<p>uh what are the two things that um if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient in can make you feel</p>
<p>bad when you&rsquo;re doing fasting all right</p>
<p>very good thank you for that</p>
<p>clarification doctor an audience you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been fully briefed so there&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>not to get a good percentage</p>
<p>in your answer on that let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>social media</p>
<p>Lori from YouTube uh what do you</p>
<p>recommend for dermatitis and eczema</p>
<p>eczema excuse me</p>
<p>most of the time there&rsquo;s something going</p>
<p>on in the gut there&rsquo;s some inflammation</p>
<p>in the gut</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s showing up in your skin it</p>
<p>could also be related to the liver but</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s probably some what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>dysbiosis some imbalance in your Flora</p>
<p>in your gut so I would look in that area</p>
<p>I would take a probiotic I would take</p>
<p>also a Prebiotic sauerkraut kefir start</p>
<p>working on that vitamin D is important</p>
<p>as well but it&rsquo;s usually um you may have</p>
<p>a history of antibiotics or some other</p>
<p>type of infection you had in the gut</p>
<p>and so you got to fix that to fix the</p>
<p>skin</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>okay we already talked about that</p>
<p>okay uh taru from Facebook how can I do</p>
<p>vegetarian keto without eating cheese</p>
<p>uh what would be a good substitute is</p>
<p>that that sounds awful</p>
<p>how to do the vegetarian type keto</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always very difficult because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that relates to the next question and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk more about it but the point is</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard to keep the carbs low</p>
<p>um and also</p>
<p>um but you can do eggs so</p>
<p>um I would do a lot of eggs and</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s what I would do if I were you</p>
<p>and maybe some nuts</p>
<p>um but of course if you have a problem</p>
<p>with dairy you can&rsquo;t do that so you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to work do a work</p>
<p>around and try some other foods that</p>
<p>that you can have but you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>definitely have to do a lot of eggs</p>
<p>all right and there&rsquo;s a lot of folks</p>
<p>that have gone through this and Bettina</p>
<p>is one of them from YouTube is keto good</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve had a gastric bypass</p>
<p>I I think so because you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>um probably your goal when you had it is</p>
<p>to lose weight and a lot of people</p>
<p>actually get rid of their diabetes when</p>
<p>they do this</p>
<p>um and what happens is you&rsquo;re um there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two ways that you</p>
<p>um become a diabetic you can do it by</p>
<p>through eating a lot of carbs</p>
<p>or you can do it through a lot of</p>
<p>frequent eating because every time you</p>
<p>eat it triggers something in your small</p>
<p>intestine that causes a spike in insulin</p>
<p>but when they do gastric beat bypass</p>
<p>they tend to remove that or bypass that</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>that eliminates kind of like it lowers</p>
<p>your your insulin to the point where you</p>
<p>start</p>
<p>um having less diabetic problems and you</p>
<p>lose weight because of that</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>if you try keto initially probably been</p>
<p>the best thing to do but</p>
<p>now should you go back should you try</p>
<p>keto absolutely because that&rsquo;ll maintain</p>
<p>those healthy levels of insulin that you</p>
<p>need to get rid of insulin resistance so</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s perfectly fine the only thing</p>
<p>is that you sometimes um</p>
<p>you know you might need</p>
<p>to take additional supplements like</p>
<p>trace minerals and um</p>
<p>more B12 and vitamin D</p>
<p>because of the altered uh structure now</p>
<p>that we have to cope with that kind of</p>
<p>limits your</p>
<p>absorption of certain nutrients</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s go to Facebook</p>
<p>Tim wants to know uh Dr Berg what is it</p>
<p>that inspires you to study the body so</p>
<p>deeply</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a fascinating machine I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it pulls me right in is this</p>
<p>fascinating like like for example when</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>instead of the DNA right you have this</p>
<p>this amazing code</p>
<p>that programs for all these different</p>
<p>proteins and enzymes so you have this</p>
<p>DNA that has to be unzipped well the</p>
<p>thing that unzips it it&rsquo;s like a little</p>
<p>protein that spins around in the circle</p>
<p>is so fast it&rsquo;s faster than a jet engine</p>
<p>now that just blows me away I mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know how anyone couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>so interested in in things like that</p>
<p>um other things like um I just did a</p>
<p>video on</p>
<p>cyanide cyanide poisoning</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain enzymes in your liver</p>
<p>that can dismantle a certain amount of</p>
<p>cyanide if you have those detoxification</p>
<p>enzymes and so cyanide is fat soluble so</p>
<p>the liver basically can take that fat</p>
<p>soluble and turn into a water-soluble</p>
<p>particle that&rsquo;s not poisonous anymore</p>
<p>and you can get rid of it to the urine</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s this the body is so</p>
<p>fascinating and so mysterious that I</p>
<p>mean it just makes me very interested</p>
<p>and I can study it all day long I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>um if other people can do that but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting and it really increases</p>
<p>the appreciation for eating healthy</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>now you know what the body goes through</p>
<p>and what it what you&rsquo;re doing when you</p>
<p>eat that donut or that Krispy Kreme</p>
<p>donut makes you probably aren&rsquo;t going to</p>
<p>eat that Crispy Cream donut anymore</p>
<p>Steve if you uh really understand the</p>
<p>these incredible magical mechanisms that</p>
<p>your body is doing on a regular basis</p>
<p>just to keep you alive well I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>give that some deep thought</p>
<p>um and we&rsquo;ll steer clear of that right</p>
<p>in place and now we know how Rasputin</p>
<p>pulled it off right with the old Cyanide</p>
<p>and the liver and all that so some</p>
<p>people he must have been observing a</p>
<p>very careful diet let&rsquo;s see guess what</p>
<p>the audience has come back with an</p>
<p>answer for the third question of the day</p>
<p>again no true false or so they had to</p>
<p>really put on their thinking cap and it</p>
<p>asks what are the two factors when low</p>
<p>or you rephrased it to make you feel bad</p>
<p>while fasting I think they got it and 55</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s electrolytes and water is the</p>
<p>culprit 30 say it&rsquo;s salt and water 10</p>
<p>percent say fat and trace minerals and</p>
<p>five percent uh say potassium so I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 100 what do we have there doc</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s correct there&rsquo;s two things</p>
<p>though that um are a bit more magnified</p>
<p>as far as feeling</p>
<p>bad when you&rsquo;re on doing fasting</p>
<p>one is sea salt</p>
<p>but yes potassium is definitely gonna be</p>
<p>an issue but but sea salt if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient you&rsquo;re going to feel really</p>
<p>weak on keto and the reason I&rsquo;m even</p>
<p>bringing that up is because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>common thing that people forget about is</p>
<p>that sea salt when they&rsquo;re doing fasting</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re they take supplements</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t realize the sea salt</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like I need that enough of</p>
<p>that so that may just make you feel a</p>
<p>lot better if you don&rsquo;t feel good when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing fasting I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>prolonged fasting the other thing is</p>
<p>protein if you&rsquo;re already deficient in</p>
<p>protein or you have some atrophy maybe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through menopause or</p>
<p>whatever and you do long-term fast and</p>
<p>you feel terrible</p>
<p>uh chances are that you&rsquo;re you just need</p>
<p>more amino acids</p>
<p>um in your body this autophagy is not</p>
<p>providing that for you so in that case</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I would probably recommend</p>
<p>taking like a an amino acid supplement</p>
<p>not actual protein but an amino acid</p>
<p>supplement that has all the balance that</p>
<p>you need to</p>
<p>give you those some those factors that</p>
<p>you need because</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really have a protein</p>
<p>requirement we have an amino acid</p>
<p>requirement and if you take those</p>
<p>without taking too many extra then the</p>
<p>body could just use that to replace the</p>
<p>tissue that it needs to repair and not</p>
<p>convert anything to glucose so I just</p>
<p>wanted to bring that up because um</p>
<p>out of all the macronutrients amino</p>
<p>acids or protein is at the the top of</p>
<p>the list regarding survival</p>
<p>our body will continue to eat protein</p>
<p>until we&rsquo;re satisfied that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really needing to be satisfied if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating these fats and carbs without the</p>
<p>protein you will tend to overeat because</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t fully be satisfied</p>
<p>so the protein is the key thing and this</p>
<p>is why Steve that I always recommend eat</p>
<p>your salad first before your protein</p>
<p>because you may find that you&rsquo;re no</p>
<p>longer hungry for the salad so</p>
<p>course</p>
<p>you know I mean</p>
<p>um eating 10 cups of vegetables is not</p>
<p>always the easiest thing to do Steve but</p>
<p>I know</p>
<p>thank goodness that you and your family</p>
<p>do it so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s absolutely I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just have my head in the feed bag with</p>
<p>lettuce all day long in between the</p>
<p>shows so and I also have to apologize to</p>
<p>the audience because our last question</p>
<p>last week we ran out of time I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to it and it was why would you eat</p>
<p>your greens before uh you know the rest</p>
<p>of the meal and I think you just</p>
<p>answered that for all of them</p>
<p>um so yeah exactly sorry that we ran out</p>
<p>of time on that but we&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>do it again uh and we&rsquo;re going to make</p>
<p>sure we get all the questions answered</p>
<p>and Doc here is question number four</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>if insulin is protective against clogged</p>
<p>arteries which is interesting because it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>how can hyperinsulate anemia that&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>blood insulin levels trigger the</p>
<p>formation of clogged arteries</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a conundrum</p>
<p>I guess all right audience climb on that</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see you know I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to end up with a lot of time for</p>
<p>social media because we love to give</p>
<p>them a lot of love and the reason is</p>
<p>that today&rsquo;s guests all the ladies from</p>
<p>around the world have been very</p>
<p>efficient in their questions that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting through and Aaron is our final I</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s from Cleveland nod your head</p>
<p>if I said that right she is from</p>
<p>Cleveland and she has got one question</p>
<p>which she&rsquo;s going to build out in 30</p>
<p>seconds you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg uh Erin</p>
<p>thanks for joining us all right thank</p>
<p>you thank you hi Dr Berg</p>
<p>um quick question</p>
<p>um my son two years ago did a Polar</p>
<p>Plunge kind of thing he&rsquo;s 25 now and he</p>
<p>came out with an incredible rash</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>hives and long story short he they said</p>
<p>he has cold urticaria</p>
<p>and it blew me away because he&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>been an allergy kid or uh you know</p>
<p>anything so</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m scratching my head like what out</p>
<p>how does this happen you know so his is</p>
<p>cold so he suffers you know whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the cold weather or</p>
<p>um he can&rsquo;t really eat ice cream or ice</p>
<p>cold drinks</p>
<p>um but after finding your videos</p>
<p>probably a good three months ago and</p>
<p>discovering</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you um</p>
<p>you have incredible knowledge so I I</p>
<p>wanted to hear any remedies supplements</p>
<p>will this go away</p>
<p>so typically that is a B1 thymine</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>um that vitamin B B1 helps regulate the</p>
<p>temperature</p>
<p>um and so if you can&rsquo;t tolerate</p>
<p>cold or you react to it or even heat</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>um you need more B1 in fact it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re bringing up the cold therapy</p>
<p>because I happen to just someone sent me</p>
<p>this book</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>just yesterday</p>
<p>which basically today I&rsquo;m getting my ice</p>
<p>bath shipped it&rsquo;s coming I think I just</p>
<p>heard them pulling up so I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>getting this this outside ice bath that</p>
<p>heats it up to think 36 degrees so I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be doing these ice baths versus the cold</p>
<p>showers</p>
<p>not very pleasurable but um I I just</p>
<p>heard about you know I&rsquo;ve been the</p>
<p>benefits are incredible so I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>just do it but I think what he needs to</p>
<p>do is start taking more B1 and then he</p>
<p>needs to do a very small amount and a</p>
<p>very gradual introduction to this cold</p>
<p>so maybe he takes one drink with one</p>
<p>small Ice Cube and he does that for a</p>
<p>period of time until okay less reaction</p>
<p>less reaction and then more and more and</p>
<p>more and more and to the point where he</p>
<p>takes a Luke Luke Luke lukewarm shower</p>
<p>and then gets he just has to go about it</p>
<p>more gradual he doesn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>completely back off but he should do</p>
<p>that once he takes enough B1 in his body</p>
<p>so get a natural thymine and have him</p>
<p>start taking a good amount of it until</p>
<p>that tolerance for cold goes away</p>
<p>and how much would you say Simon</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would</p>
<p>you know different different products</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to get into Brands but</p>
<p>have different amounts</p>
<p>honestly I would just take whatever</p>
<p>it says of the serving size of the</p>
<p>dosage I would take three times that</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>thank you that&rsquo;s great well uh great</p>
<p>luck with that Aaron and thank you and</p>
<p>son you know Dr Berg I love saunas I</p>
<p>take them almost every night at the gym</p>
<p>and I always finish it with a cold</p>
<p>shower in the winter it&rsquo;s very brisk</p>
<p>otherwise it&rsquo;s sort of whatever but it</p>
<p>feels like after two sessions of that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like three martinis without the</p>
<p>hangover just feels fabulous it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting what it does too</p>
<p>um you know</p>
<p>I like to I think I like it just to</p>
<p>remind my body who&rsquo;s in charge because</p>
<p>if you notice like people like</p>
<p>are like so</p>
<p>um their Viewpoint is like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>always oh my poor body I don&rsquo;t want to I</p>
<p>want to make it always comfortable I</p>
<p>like to kind of stress it out</p>
<p>occasionally and it seems to do better</p>
<p>that way and uh and um</p>
<p>same thing with fasting right it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>oh I&rsquo;m a little hungry I better feed my</p>
<p>body I better nourish my body no your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s gonna do better if you just</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>treat it like you&rsquo;re in charge and like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll feed you when I&rsquo;m ready</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden the hunger goes</p>
<p>I mean hunger goes away and the body</p>
<p>starts</p>
<p>um doing very well so um you don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>want to make sure you don&rsquo;t give your</p>
<p>body too much sympathy it just doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do well when you do that all right well</p>
<p>Catherine from Facebook&rsquo;s in a real</p>
<p>pickle constant ringing in my ears for</p>
<p>three days now my ears feel clogged I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried all the techniques to make it go</p>
<p>away it&rsquo;s making me anxious uh and I ca</p>
<p>I think she said can&rsquo;t do fasting</p>
<p>because of hypoglycemia I passed out the</p>
<p>first time I tried it help</p>
<p>I think you need electrolytes for sure</p>
<p>but right now there is an allergy season</p>
<p>type thing going on right now which</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of mucus that can go right</p>
<p>into your station tube because this</p>
<p>exact symptom so if that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>seasonal allergies that actually can</p>
<p>cause mucus in the back of the station</p>
<p>tube in the back of the throat then um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that you should</p>
<p>do stinging nettle is a really good</p>
<p>remedy for allergies uh also um</p>
<p>um bee pollen</p>
<p>is an awesome awesome way to do this and</p>
<p>you want to take um a good amount three</p>
<p>times a day to um</p>
<p>to give you that relief and then</p>
<p>quercetin</p>
<p>which is in onions</p>
<p>so those are the three things for that</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>in the meantime I know one good remedy</p>
<p>is consuming a lot of radishes radishes</p>
<p>tend to pull mucus from deeper parts of</p>
<p>the body and especially if you have</p>
<p>mucus in the back of the throat or the</p>
<p>station tube that&rsquo;s leaking into the</p>
<p>your ear space so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s what I would do I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>related to an allergy</p>
<p>all right very good Genie from YouTube</p>
<p>wants to know what is the blood sugar</p>
<p>level that tells us we are now a</p>
<p>diabetic</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>um like about 126</p>
<p>milligrams per deciliter that&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>become a diabetic so normal blood sugar</p>
<p>is below 99 but I think it should be</p>
<p>like 80. and then when it gets to 126</p>
<p>you are now officially a diabetic right</p>
<p>now if you look at A1C that&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>little different number that&rsquo;s 6.4 and</p>
<p>what does that mean 6.4 that means</p>
<p>how</p>
<p>um how much the protein in your blood</p>
<p>the red blood cell the hemoglobin is um</p>
<p>damaged from the sugar from being</p>
<p>exposed to the sugar they call that</p>
<p>glycation so it&rsquo;s glycated protein and</p>
<p>so you can determine what your blood</p>
<p>sugars are</p>
<p>by how much glycation you have and then</p>
<p>6.4 is considered a diabetic now when</p>
<p>your glycation goes up</p>
<p>that number A1C goes up to like a nine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty I mean now you&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>to get a lot of complications with your</p>
<p>eye with your kidneys with your arteries</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you know if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s a nine your</p>
<p>blood sugar probably is around like 212</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s pretty high</p>
<p>so in these situations you know once you</p>
<p>educate a person like what this means</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s very obvious what you need</p>
<p>to do you need to cut out the sugar and</p>
<p>if the sugar is still high you need to</p>
<p>follow my video on insulin resistance</p>
<p>and how to correct that with the apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar or berberine vitamin D</p>
<p>etc etc</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what it is and</p>
<p>then um the cool thing is you can</p>
<p>reverse it if you change your diet and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t eat so frequently</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>I hope that answers your question very</p>
<p>good Sonya have we had you on</p>
<p>if we had Sonya on no I don&rsquo;t think we</p>
<p>have from uh Sonya can you hear us</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;re having a little problem</p>
<p>I think Sonya just popped up see I see</p>
<p>her she doesn&rsquo;t look to be muted no uh</p>
<p>Sonia can you hear us we&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>give up on you yet Sonya so uh if you</p>
<p>can hear us try to unmute yourself or</p>
<p>wave or do something in the meantime</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s reigning vampire Champion is the</p>
<p>name he has what were his parents</p>
<p>thinking uh from YouTube my mom was on</p>
<p>chemo what supplements should she take</p>
<p>to help her recover from it</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in chemo</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you want to protect the cells against</p>
<p>this chemo and there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>you can do one is fasting it</p>
<p>automatically kind of strengthens your</p>
<p>cells but also a lot of the um things</p>
<p>that are antioxidants like um</p>
<p>sulforaphane would be a good one</p>
<p>um curcumin is another good one</p>
<p>um consuming cruciferous vegetables is</p>
<p>something else that I would highly</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>um alpha lipoic acid would be another</p>
<p>one I mean you can just go right down</p>
<p>the list vitamin C vitamin E all these</p>
<p>are really good</p>
<p>um but what another thing you could do</p>
<p>is to take that methylene blue which is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Dynamite as far as a remedy to help</p>
<p>protect the mitochondria and also to get</p>
<p>to kind of bypass the damage especially</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re taking chemo for cancer</p>
<p>all right very good question number four</p>
<p>was also answered and I&rsquo;m pulling for</p>
<p>your audience and it was a long question</p>
<p>if insulin is protective against clogged</p>
<p>arteries arteries then how can hypo</p>
<p>insulimia if I said that right or rather</p>
<p>high blood insulin trigger the formation</p>
<p>of clogged arteries and that is an</p>
<p>interesting question the audience</p>
<p>addressed it as follows 80 percent say</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s because the calcium</p>
<p>in the blood and 20 percent say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because the blood is sticky I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s a medical term</p>
<p>um so um so what do you think dot</p>
<p>the reason I keep asking this question a</p>
<p>lot over and over because I want people</p>
<p>to really understand it&rsquo;s an important</p>
<p>question when you have this High insulin</p>
<p>because it because you&rsquo;re eating a lot</p>
<p>of sugar</p>
<p>it creates a lot of problems and it</p>
<p>creates a lot of problems because you</p>
<p>develop resistance to insulin</p>
<p>which means</p>
<p>the higher the insulin goes in the blood</p>
<p>the less you can absorb in the cells</p>
<p>and we have all these wonderful things</p>
<p>that insulin does</p>
<p>but not when you start having insulin</p>
<p>resistance and then you can&rsquo;t get it in</p>
<p>the cells so it&rsquo;s kind of an interesting</p>
<p>dilemma of how do we get insulin into</p>
<p>the cells to get the benefit of insulin</p>
<p>without getting all the side effects</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>you have to have normal amounts and the</p>
<p>way to do that is to not snack so much</p>
<p>and not eat so many carbs</p>
<p>so the minute that insulin goes high now</p>
<p>you start becoming deficient in insulin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of one of those oxymorons that</p>
<p>uh very counterintuitive but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>yelling at</p>
<p>the more you let yell out your spouse to</p>
<p>try to communicate the less that that</p>
<p>person will listen to you wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>agree Steve uh I wouldn&rsquo;t dare try such</p>
<p>an experiment she&rsquo;s Italian do I have to</p>
<p>say anymore</p>
<p>right now you don&rsquo;t stand anymore okay</p>
<p>very good uh well we got one she might</p>
<p>start developing resistance to your</p>
<p>communication yeah sure well she can</p>
<p>shut me right off actually I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>chatterbox As You Can Tell She&rsquo;s The</p>
<p>Quiet One in the home it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>she just gives Yes dear to all my</p>
<p>utterings okay so here&rsquo;s our final</p>
<p>question and I am just for what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth I&rsquo;m pulling for the red onions</p>
<p>here it is</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>which color of onion fights allergies</p>
<p>better yellow or red onion</p>
<p>come on and that&rsquo;s also purple right in</p>
<p>the red that&rsquo;s what you that&rsquo;s what that</p>
<p>is right yeah right yeah so I love those</p>
<p>um but we&rsquo;re talking about relating to</p>
<p>allergies okay and quercetin</p>
<p>okay very good now let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>okay right from Facebook what are the</p>
<p>benefits of Kombucha</p>
<p>tea I guess</p>
<p>you got to be careful because a lot of</p>
<p>times the kombucha has a lot of sugar in</p>
<p>it but there is a lot of benefits you</p>
<p>have a good amount of lactic acid in</p>
<p>there which is um actually beneficial to</p>
<p>your own digestive system it helps</p>
<p>digestion and there&rsquo;s a really kind of a</p>
<p>cool effect of feeling calmer I</p>
<p>recommend Kombucha tea for those people</p>
<p>who are trying to get off alcohol</p>
<p>because it does have a similar texture</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>an alcoholic beverage like beer</p>
<p>but without too much alcohol I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tiny tiny bit but it does make</p>
<p>you calm and it gives you the sensation</p>
<p>the pleasurable Sensation that you would</p>
<p>get if you&rsquo;re drunk no when just when</p>
<p>you actually kind of um it just makes</p>
<p>you feel calm and uh so if you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to get off that you know do a substitute</p>
<p>put it in a little wine glass and then</p>
<p>sip that and see if that doesn&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>um but it&rsquo;s good for digestion</p>
<p>okay well I&rsquo;m going to start an IV of</p>
<p>that it sounds lovely see what happens</p>
<p>okay can you believe it that uh quiz</p>
<p>question number five was answered that</p>
<p>quickly uh and of course it asks which</p>
<p>color of onion fights allergies better</p>
<p>yellow or red</p>
<p>and the audience 92 percent of the</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s red yay that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I said an eight percent say it&rsquo;s yellow</p>
<p>come on red</p>
<p>yellow</p>
<p>oh yeah I mean I mean</p>
<p>okay so it&rsquo;s not by a major amount but</p>
<p>it is higher so the yellow yellow onions</p>
<p>would be just a little bit better than</p>
<p>the red onions well I&rsquo;m with the</p>
<p>audience in our Fall From Grace 92</p>
<p>percent of us maybe I make 93 have it</p>
<p>wrong but I&rsquo;m going to continue to enjoy</p>
<p>them on my salads I just love that uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see so we we couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>um our gas back she dropped off again so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be an absolute uh social</p>
<p>media Marathon for the rest of the hour</p>
<p>and they deserve it they they contribute</p>
<p>so much to the show so let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>okay we talked about the ringing in my</p>
<p>ears let&rsquo;s see oh here we go</p>
<p>Terry fed me one up Rose from Facebook</p>
<p>how much</p>
<p>folic acid should we have per day</p>
<p>um as far as the pro this is the thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still doing some interesting</p>
<p>research on DNA</p>
<p>um and I am finding a lot of people</p>
<p>have a problem with folic acid they have</p>
<p>a meth it&rsquo;s called methylation Problem</p>
<p>methylation means you&rsquo;re combining</p>
<p>something to something else to help it</p>
<p>work better and it&rsquo;s called a methyl</p>
<p>group and so detox better to make things</p>
<p>make you healthier</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>how much does someone should they follow</p>
<p>the simple the RDA which I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>memorized</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know what it is but I I would</p>
<p>say this</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>watch my video on</p>
<p>this methylation problem and if you have</p>
<p>some of the symptoms that potentially</p>
<p>could be related to a genetic problem</p>
<p>with methylation then you need</p>
<p>a lot more</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>folate but not in the form of folic acid</p>
<p>this is called this is B9 by the way you</p>
<p>need it in the form of folate dark leafy</p>
<p>green vegetables that&rsquo;s the best thing</p>
<p>and then also</p>
<p>um the type of product you need is</p>
<p>something called methyl folate because</p>
<p>your problem it just doesn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>absorbed that well</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just been very interesting</p>
<p>looking looking at DNA because</p>
<p>I see a lot of pre problems with people</p>
<p>with vitamin D absorption vitamin C B12</p>
<p>folate</p>
<p>and even choline so this is fascinating</p>
<p>so when you</p>
<p>take the normal rdas</p>
<p>and especially if it&rsquo;s in a synthetic</p>
<p>form it&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>so if you</p>
<p>consume the right foods like dark leafy</p>
<p>greens you&rsquo;re going to get a really good</p>
<p>amount of vitamin C and folate if you</p>
<p>consume animal products grass-fed you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have a good amount of the right</p>
<p>kind of B12</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>so I hope that answered that question to</p>
<p>a sufficient amount well I hope we can</p>
<p>answer Sonia&rsquo;s question because she</p>
<p>popped back up can you hear us Sonia</p>
<p>oh dear well Sonya hopefully next week</p>
<p>or something why don&rsquo;t you type this</p>
<p>question I don&rsquo;t think she can even hear</p>
<p>us poor thing uh but anyway so off we go</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>social media again</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Ben from YouTube my mom has</p>
<p>tennis elbow out and is getting numbness</p>
<p>in her hands please share any solutions</p>
<p>you might have</p>
<p>B6</p>
<p>B6 uh is great for that but the other</p>
<p>thing too if the tennis elbow is on the</p>
<p>right side</p>
<p>uh suspect uh gallbladder</p>
<p>um and I have videos on that</p>
<p>um I know it sounds wild but I have seen</p>
<p>some really good results by supporting</p>
<p>that and supporting the right elbow</p>
<p>another thing you can do</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s coming from playing</p>
<p>tennis is um wherever it hurts on that</p>
<p>elbow usually it&rsquo;s going to be on the</p>
<p>inside of the elbow you can do massage</p>
<p>on the outside of the right elbow and</p>
<p>also on the inside of the left elbow do</p>
<p>the opposite massage technique and you</p>
<p>can watch my video on that it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those little tricks that creates a</p>
<p>really cool miracle for</p>
<p>the tendonitis first is what most people</p>
<p>do is they wear a brace and they put ice</p>
<p>on it which never really does anything</p>
<p>yeah that can really last okay so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Maggie from Facebook please share your</p>
<p>thoughts on treating AFib</p>
<p>I would beef up on your electrolytes</p>
<p>especially potassium and manganese I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry a magnesium I would consume a lot</p>
<p>of those minerals some over a period of</p>
<p>time sometimes it takes a while but the</p>
<p>pacemaker of the heart is dependent on</p>
<p>these electrolytes and if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough of them which most people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>most people don&rsquo;t consume enough</p>
<p>magnesium and let alone potassium for</p>
<p>sure where do you get these two minerals</p>
<p>primarily from well large huge salads</p>
<p>um you know roughly to the areas of or</p>
<p>seven to ten cups or if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>actual vegetables it&rsquo;s going to be like</p>
<p>half that but the point is that</p>
<p>with the average person consuming only</p>
<p>one and a half cups of vegetables so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not getting near enough of these</p>
<p>minerals so magnesium is a very common</p>
<p>deficiency and definitely potassium</p>
<p>because you need like 4 700 milligrams</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um if you get that get the right amounts</p>
<p>I think it can greatly help the</p>
<p>pacemaker of the heart go back you know</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t pay attention to</p>
<p>um electrolytes enough especially as it</p>
<p>relates to arrhythmias</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so instead you start taking a medication</p>
<p>from arrhythmia</p>
<p>or some other thing but what about</p>
<p>electrolytes why not just try that first</p>
<p>a lot of times that&rsquo;s very successful if</p>
<p>someone is an athlete like a top level</p>
<p>athlete and they&rsquo;re doing Biking For</p>
<p>example</p>
<p>um they can develop a different type of</p>
<p>arrhythmia where the heart becomes so</p>
<p>strong it becomes a little bit bigger</p>
<p>and now those pacemakers because you</p>
<p>have a few different pacemakers don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>line up and that can create arrhythmias</p>
<p>as well so that&rsquo;s just another</p>
<p>another problem if you over train or get</p>
<p>too much you&rsquo;re in too much in shape you</p>
<p>start developing this problem which is</p>
<p>kind of um</p>
<p>common for people doing high level</p>
<p>biking</p>
<p>okay well by the way the audience</p>
<p>probably knows that Terry our producer</p>
<p>has an extensive background in broadcast</p>
<p>um journalism he&rsquo;s also an expert in</p>
<p>medical science and he said that for the</p>
<p>woman who has tennis elbow he recommends</p>
<p>that she quit playing tennis</p>
<p>so um so thank you Terry</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know how that eluded us but</p>
<p>that should work very well okay VGA from</p>
<p>YouTube is beet juice good for high</p>
<p>blood pressure</p>
<p>um they say it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>because of nitric oxide but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>new information</p>
<p>um by by this author Mark Sloan who</p>
<p>wrote the book methylene blue on nitric</p>
<p>oxide you should you should get that</p>
<p>book to read up on it there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>conflicting information</p>
<p>um that I&rsquo;m not going to get into in</p>
<p>this video but</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t kind of go crazy at drinking</p>
<p>a lot of beet juice to lower your blood</p>
<p>pressure</p>
<p>um what I would do is consume vegetables</p>
<p>in general to increase your potassium</p>
<p>and then also take vitamin D which are</p>
<p>two things that</p>
<p>are just like a no-brainer with blood</p>
<p>pressure and of course the other thing</p>
<p>too is to avoid the stiffening of the</p>
<p>arteries which will automatically lower</p>
<p>your blood pressure you you get off</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>um apparently the thickness of your</p>
<p>arteries</p>
<p>um are they can grow real fast if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing carbs and so if you have the</p>
<p>coronary arteries or the carotid</p>
<p>arteries through the neck</p>
<p>starting to become thicker because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a lot of carbs then that is</p>
<p>a problem so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to the whole</p>
<p>goal is to make sure you have arteries</p>
<p>that can give your brain oxygen right</p>
<p>that would be or your heart oxygen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>so cut out the carbs</p>
<p>all right very good well guess what time</p>
<p>it is Dr Berg</p>
<p>well you know I</p>
<p>I was just waiting for that one last</p>
<p>question but you know what I think we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>answered a lot of questions I appreciate</p>
<p>everyone listening this far well done</p>
<p>thank you so much stay tuned next week</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do the same thing and I have some</p>
<p>some additional very interesting videos</p>
<p>coming up I think you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll like as</p>
<p>well so have a wonderful weekend and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see you next time</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
