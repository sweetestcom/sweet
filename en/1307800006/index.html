    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>First of all, let me thank all of you who have been kind enough to leave feedback and</p>
<p>ratings for this podcast on iTunes.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, the feedback is very helpful, and I continue to welcome your comments</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>Now, as we look at this week&rsquo;s episode, I want to continue to look at the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language and the connections between that language and modern English.</p>
<p>In the last episode, I looked at a specific sound change which has occurred throughout</p>
<p>the history of the Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>That was the shift from the K sound to the S sound, the process called assimilation.</p>
<p>And we looked at how that sound change has marked the history of the modern English letter</p>
<p>C. We also looked at how this sound change helped early linguists to classify the early</p>
<p>Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>In this episode, I want to look at that original Indo-European language more closely.</p>
<p>Remember that this is the ancestor of English, and almost all of the languages of Europe.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, we can see traces of English in this ancient language.</p>
<p>Chronologically, this is as far back as we can go in the history of English.</p>
<p>This is where English begins as far as our history is concerned.</p>
<p>Of course, languages were spoken before the Indo-European language, and the Indo-European</p>
<p>language has an even older ancestor, but we may never really know the nature of that language.</p>
<p>But given what we can know, based upon the linguistic evidence, the historical records,</p>
<p>and the archaeological evidence, this is the oldest ancestor of English which we can recreate,</p>
<p>at least in part.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already looked at how linguists have reconstructed part of this language.</p>
<p>So, in this episode, we&rsquo;re going to look at some of the words in that language which</p>
<p>have been identified by linguists.</p>
<p>And you may be surprised at how many of these words are found in modern English in some</p>
<p>form.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind as we look at these words is that they are some of the oldest</p>
<p>words in the English language, with roots dating back to between 4000 BC to 2000 BC.</p>
<p>These words existed long before the English language itself existed, and most of these</p>
<p>words did not sound like their modern-day English versions.</p>
<p>However, some of these words may have actually sounded very similar to the words we have</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>In an earlier episode, I mentioned words we have in modern English like oxen, bear, and</p>
<p>apple, and the fact that those words were probably pronounced by the original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>in a way that was very similar to the way the words are pronounced today.</p>
<p>So that a word like oxen was probably pronounced something like utzen, the word bear was probably</p>
<p>pronounced something like ber, and the word apple was probably pronounced something like</p>
<p>abel.</p>
<p>But, again, the actual pronunciation of these original Indo-European words is not known</p>
<p>for certain.</p>
<p>These are reconstructed words with pronunciations based on reasonable assumptions.</p>
<p>So, in this podcast episode, I&rsquo;m not really going to focus on the actual pronunciation</p>
<p>of these words.</p>
<p>When we look at all of the reconstructed words from the original Indo-European language,</p>
<p>we get a picture of our linguistic ancestors just before they began to spread into Europe</p>
<p>and Central Asia around 2000 BC.</p>
<p>Thus, this original Indo-European language, in its original form, has been an extinct</p>
<p>language for over 4,000 years.</p>
<p>Once the initial speakers of the language began to split up and speak separate dialects,</p>
<p>we no longer have the original Proto-Indo-European language.</p>
<p>We now have evolved, modified versions of the original language.</p>
<p>So, the Proto, or first language, is just that, the language that was spoken initially</p>
<p>before it began to fragment and divide into separate languages and dialects.</p>
<p>But who were these Indo-Europeans?</p>
<p>Where did they live?</p>
<p>When did they live?</p>
<p>And how did they live?</p>
<p>When the Indo-European language was first identified and it started to be reconstructed,</p>
<p>linguists had some general ideas and guesses, but no one really knew for certain.</p>
<p>In the earlier podcast episodes, we discussed some of those assumptions.</p>
<p>For example, I discussed the assumption made by Sir William Jones that the original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>were the Aryans of Central Asia.</p>
<p>But as the language began to be reconstructed, many aspects of those early Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>began to be revealed.</p>
<p>Based upon the words which they used, linguists could begin to identify what type of plants</p>
<p>and animals they encountered, and what type of geography they observed, and whether they</p>
<p>practiced agriculture, and many other aspects of their culture.</p>
<p>This evidence was then compared with other historical and archaeological evidence to</p>
<p>determine when and where these people lived.</p>
<p>In an upcoming episode of the podcast, we&rsquo;ll look at how historians put these pieces together</p>
<p>to determine exactly who these people were and when and where they lived.</p>
<p>But first things first, let&rsquo;s look at the reconstructed Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s start with the vocabulary, the words.</p>
<p>There are somewhere between 1,300 and 2,000 reconstructed Indo-European root words, which</p>
<p>result in about 13,000 English words.</p>
<p>So I said between 1,300 and 2,000.</p>
<p>Why is there such a broad range in the number of reconstructed words?</p>
<p>Well, remember that the process of reconstruction involves tracing words back through the very</p>
<p>various language families to recreate a common root word.</p>
<p>Some of these reconstructed words are determined from only a couple of language families.</p>
<p>Others are reconstructed through several language families.</p>
<p>Obviously, the more language families we use, the better and more certain the reconstructed</p>
<p>word is.</p>
<p>So, some of the reconstructed words are more generally accepted than others.</p>
<p>Consequently, linguists don&rsquo;t entirely agree on the total number of accepted reconstructed</p>
<p>words.</p>
<p>In this episode, I&rsquo;m going to focus on some of the words which are generally accepted</p>
<p>by all Indo-European linguists.</p>
<p>Now, as we look at these words, keep in mind that some of these words are the earliest</p>
<p>versions of many of the words we have in modern English.</p>
<p>Even though they are relatively few in number, they represent a disproportionately large</p>
<p>percentage of our everyday speech.</p>
<p>Much like a child who learns a few basic words as a child and then adds more words to his</p>
<p>or her vocabulary throughout life, the English language has its own similar history.</p>
<p>Over time, the language has grown and it&rsquo;s added words.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European words are the oldest and most basic.</p>
<p>By the Old English period, the language had grown, but it was still very small compared</p>
<p>to the language today, and it continues to grow today just like a person who adds new</p>
<p>words as he or she gets older.</p>
<p>Remember the analogy to the oak tree which I&rsquo;ve used before.</p>
<p>English is like an oak tree.</p>
<p>The most basic words we use as children and use every day, the core of our vocabulary,</p>
<p>is represented by the roots and the trunk of the tree.</p>
<p>Those are the oldest words, the oldest parts of the tree, and they rarely change because</p>
<p>we learn them as children and they are the core of the vocabulary which we all share.</p>
<p>Then added to that core vocabulary are all of the other words which we use to express</p>
<p>more basic thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>The words which give color and context and subtlety and expression to the language.</p>
<p>There are lots and lots of those words.</p>
<p>Those are the limbs and branches and leaves of the oak tree.</p>
<p>Many of those words have been borrowed in over time and they come from many different sources.</p>
<p>They also have more of a tendency to change over time.</p>
<p>Some of those words come into the language and sometimes they disappear from the language</p>
<p>due to lack of use.</p>
<p>Some of those words are rarely used.</p>
<p>Those are the words that fill up a dictionary.</p>
<p>The core vocabulary, though, the roots and trunk of the tree, tend to be the oldest words</p>
<p>in our vocabulary.</p>
<p>They are basic words, many of which we learn as children and therefore we keep them and</p>
<p>pass them on to our children pretty much unchanged.</p>
<p>Many of these words date back to Old English and for the same reasons many of these words</p>
<p>have roots in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve passed through countless generations for over 4,000 years and are still in the</p>
<p>language today, albeit in modified forms.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at the words these ancient Indo-Europeans used.</p>
<p>As I go through these words, I want you to try to form a mental picture of these people</p>
<p>based upon the words in their language.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that I&rsquo;m giving you the modern English version of the word.</p>
<p>In many of these cases, the Indo-European words I&rsquo;m going to mention can be reconstructed</p>
<p>through English, and by that I mean the word can be traced from modern English back to</p>
<p>Middle English, back to Old English, back to the original Germanic languages, and back</p>
<p>from there to the ancient Indo-European source word.</p>
<p>So that means the modern English word is directly descended from the Indo-European word.</p>
<p>And in some other cases, the word comes into English from another source, like Latin or</p>
<p>Greek, and it can be traced back from that language to the Indo-European source.</p>
<p>So in all of those cases, the word we use today evolved directly from the Indo-European</p>
<p>source word.</p>
<p>However, in a few cases, the modern English word we use today did not come from the Indo-European</p>
<p>source word at all.</p>
<p>It came into English at some point later and is not related to the original Indo-European</p>
<p>word.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll try to make a specific note of those cases when we get there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some of the animal names which are contained within the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>In that language, there were words for otter, beaver, wolf, lynx, elk, red deer, and also</p>
<p>a word for horse.</p>
<p>Now let me mention something about the word for horse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear at this point whether the word for horse in the Indo-European language referred</p>
<p>to wild horses or domesticated horses.</p>
<p>And this actually becomes very important in terms of trying to figure out when these people</p>
<p>lived.</p>
<p>But again, more about that in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>The other thing is that the word horse, which we have in modern English, actually comes</p>
<p>from Old English, but it&rsquo;s really unknown prior to then.</p>
<p>So, even though the original Indo-Europeans had a word for horse, it was not necessarily</p>
<p>the word horse which we have today.</p>
<p>The source word in the original Indo-European language is actually the source of the word</p>
<p>equine, which we do have in English today.</p>
<p>So, when we use terms like equestrian, that word is actually derived from the original</p>
<p>Indo-European word.</p>
<p>But again, the word horse comes along much later during the Old English period.</p>
<p>And again, we don&rsquo;t really know for certain where that particular word came from.</p>
<p>Other words for animals in the original Indo-European language included mouse, hare, louse, and</p>
<p>a word which meant bed bug or moth.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re basically talking about personal insects or pests when we think about lice</p>
<p>and bed bugs.</p>
<p>And they did, in fact, have words for those animals in their language.</p>
<p>They also had words for wasp, hornet, and bee.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to talk a little bit more about bees in a second.</p>
<p>Bees are actually very important.</p>
<p>In addition to bee, they also had words for honey and mead, which was an alcoholic drink</p>
<p>that was made from honey.</p>
<p>Now just in those dozen or so words, we have major clues about who these original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>were.</p>
<p>All of these animals are found in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It should be noted that we don&rsquo;t see any animals associated with the Arctic or tropics.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see penguins or camels or elephants or crocodiles.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing clues here, as we&rsquo;ll see later, is the word for bee.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll see in a minute, we also have the source word for honey in the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>And this means that these speakers were not only in contact with bees, but honeybees,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only natural source of honey.</p>
<p>And during the period in which these speakers lived, honeybees did not exist east of the</p>
<p>Ural Mountains, which is the mountain range that divides Europe from Asia.</p>
<p>This fact alone disqualified Siberia and much of northeastern Eurasia from consideration</p>
<p>as the home of the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>Since they had honey in their language, they had to live where honeybees lived.</p>
<p>And that means somewhere west of the Ural Mountains.</p>
<p>But again, we&rsquo;ll look at all of the clues in more detail in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at some other words for animals in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at birds.</p>
<p>They had words for goose, crane, starling, swallow, and duck.</p>
<p>But the modern English word duck does not come directly from the original Indo-European</p>
<p>source word.</p>
<p>It came into English sometime during the Old English period and we don&rsquo;t exactly know</p>
<p>where it came from.</p>
<p>It does appear that the word duck is associated with and probably came from the verb meaning</p>
<p>to duck or dive.</p>
<p>So it appears that the animal name came from the action that a duck makes when it tries</p>
<p>to catch fish in the water.</p>
<p>But again, that word comes into English later.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European word is not related to duck, but it refers to the same animal.</p>
<p>Now if we turn and look at domesticated animals, we have words in the original language for</p>
<p>cow, bull, steer, sheep, and lamb, as well as wool, weave, and sew.</p>
<p>The word sheep actually goes back to Old English, but it&rsquo;s not an Indo-European word.</p>
<p>The Indo-European root word is actually the source of the English word u-e-w-e.</p>
<p>But again, even though the English word is not directly derived from the Indo-European</p>
<p>word, the Indo-Europeans did have a word for the same animal.</p>
<p>And again, they had those words for wool, weave, and sew.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s telling us a little bit more.</p>
<p>They not only encountered sheep, they also knew how to weave and how to shave them and</p>
<p>use their wool to make textiles.</p>
<p>So that becomes very important.</p>
<p>They also had a word for goat and also words for swine and sow.</p>
<p>Both of those words, swine and sow, come from the same Indo-European root word.</p>
<p>The English word pig comes from Old English, and again, we don&rsquo;t exactly know the origin</p>
<p>of the word pig.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t come from the original Indo-European word, but we do have those words for swine</p>
<p>and sow, so we know that they did have the same animal.</p>
<p>We also have in the original Indo-European language the word for dog, but their word</p>
<p>is the source of our word hound.</p>
<p>And in fact, dog is one of those great mysteries for historians of English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an extremely common word and can be found in many expressions, like the dog days</p>
<p>of summer and to go to the dogs.</p>
<p>But dog is a surprisingly new word for such a common pet and to be found in such a large</p>
<p>number of English expressions.</p>
<p>The word dog does not appear in English until around the 1500s.</p>
<p>Prior to that time, the word was hound or hund in Old English.</p>
<p>So hound is the word derived from the original Indo-European source word.</p>
<p>The Indo-European source word was kwon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the root of the word canine in Latin, from which English has also borrowed</p>
<p>the term.</p>
<p>If you remember back to Grimm&rsquo;s Law for a second, the k sound at the beginning of kwon</p>
<p>would have shifted to an h sound in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how we end up with hound.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s the same source word as canine, which comes into English from Latin.</p>
<p>So both of those words come from the same root word.</p>
<p>Now, ox and oxen were also found in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>This particular word has been retained into Old English and all the way into Modern English</p>
<p>in pretty much its original form.</p>
<p>That helps to explain why the plural form of ox is oxen but the plural form of fox is</p>
<p>foxes.</p>
<p>At some point after Old English, English adopted the modern rules for making words plural.</p>
<p>That included the general rule that the way to make a singular word plural is to add an</p>
<p>s or es at the end.</p>
<p>Pretty much all newer nouns follow that rule.</p>
<p>But extremely old nouns, which already had their own rules for plurality, like oxen,</p>
<p>retain those rules.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why oxen does not follow the general rules for how to make nouns plural in English.</p>
<p>It simply predates those English rules and has retained its own rules.</p>
<p>You might also think about words like child and children and man and men and woman and</p>
<p>women.</p>
<p>These older root words have simply retained their own ancient internal rules for making</p>
<p>them plural.</p>
<p>People kept saying oxen instead of oxes because that was the way you always pronounced the</p>
<p>multiple form of ox, oxen.</p>
<p>Now if we turn from animals and look at trees, which the Indo-Europeans encountered, these</p>
<p>words were found in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>We had the word for elm, the word for hazel, and also beech trees.</p>
<p>Beech trees were an ancient food source for agricultural animals.</p>
<p>In prehistoric times, the beech tree was not found in any areas east of a line from around</p>
<p>the Lithuanian coastline on the Baltic Sea down to the Crimean peninsula north of the</p>
<p>Black Sea.</p>
<p>And this is yet another clue to the location of the original Indo-European speakers.</p>
<p>And this is consistent with the location where honeybees lived.</p>
<p>But the words for beech in the Germanic and Italic languages literally meant beech tree.</p>
<p>But in the Greek, Iranian, and Slavic languages, the words which derive from the Indo-European</p>
<p>root word for beech can refer to different kinds of trees, including oak, elm, and elder.</p>
<p>And this is probably because the speakers of the early Greek, Iranian, and Slavic languages</p>
<p>– in other words, those Indo-Europeans who first migrated into the areas where those</p>
<p>languages are spoken today – they arrived in areas where there were no beech trees,</p>
<p>so they just called the new trees they found there beech trees.</p>
<p>In other words, beech became a more generic term for a tree in those regions.</p>
<p>But the Germanic and Italic speakers remained in areas where beeches existed, so they kept</p>
<p>the distinction between beeches and other trees and only used the term beech for beech</p>
<p>trees.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we still use that term in English to refer to a very specific type of</p>
<p>tree.</p>
<p>The Indo-Europeans also had a word for apple.</p>
<p>In its original meaning, including as late as the 1600s, apple was a generic word for</p>
<p>fruit, including all kinds of fruit other than berries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only taken on its more limited use for a specific type of fruit in the past few centuries.</p>
<p>If we think about a word like pineapple, we can see the use of the word apple in the more</p>
<p>generic sense of fruit.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re probably familiar with the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden from</p>
<p>Genesis in the Bible.</p>
<p>In many paintings based on the story, Eve is often depicted as picking an apple from</p>
<p>the tree of forbidden fruit.</p>
<p>But Genesis doesn&rsquo;t say it was an apple, it just says fruit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably correct linguistically to say that Eve ate an apple in its original</p>
<p>generic meaning as fruit, but it&rsquo;s probably artistic license to actually depict an apple</p>
<p>on a painting of the scene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that there are no words for olive, pear, or grape in</p>
<p>the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The roots of those words were adopted from non-Indo-European words being used by natives</p>
<p>in the Mediterranean when Indo-European speaking people arrived there.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re getting more clues that the original Indo-Europeans did not live in the</p>
<p>Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s shift from vegetation for a second and look at some other terms.</p>
<p>The Indo-Europeans did have some aquatic terms.</p>
<p>They had a word for fish.</p>
<p>They also had a word which meant sea, but it&rsquo;s not the source of the modern English</p>
<p>word sea.</p>
<p>The word which we got in English from the original Indo-European word was mer or mer.</p>
<p>That was the word in English for sea or ocean all the way through the Old English period.</p>
<p>And the word sea actually comes in a bit later.</p>
<p>We do still have remnants of that word mer or mer in modern English.</p>
<p>We see it in the word mermaid.</p>
<p>We also see it in the word marine, which actually derives from the same source word.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably also the source of the words moor and marsh.</p>
<p>But the point I want to make is that that word kind of died out except for a few remnants</p>
<p>here and there, and we replaced it with the modern English word sea.</p>
<p>We also have many agricultural terms in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>This is important because it suggests that these people had already adopted farming and</p>
<p>agriculture.</p>
<p>Again, these are all clues which we&rsquo;re going to put together in an upcoming episode in</p>
<p>order to identify exactly when and where these people lived.</p>
<p>They had a form of furrow, which is the trench created by a plow.</p>
<p>They had a word for meal, meaning ground grain.</p>
<p>They had a word for sow, meaning to scatter seed around.</p>
<p>And they had a word for sickle, meaning a hook-shaped tool.</p>
<p>All of these words were found in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>They also had words for certain grains.</p>
<p>They had a word for barley and also corn.</p>
<p>Corn is an interesting term as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very similar to that term apple, which I mentioned earlier, because originally it</p>
<p>meant any grain with the seed still in it.</p>
<p>So think of a word like barley corn, where it&rsquo;s used in a more generic sense.</p>
<p>Also think about the word peppercorn, where again the term is used in a more generic sense</p>
<p>as grain.</p>
<p>After Europeans discovered the New World, they discovered the grain which the Native</p>
<p>Americans called maize.</p>
<p>They began to call this particular grain Indian corn in America, and then later the term was</p>
<p>shortened to just corn.</p>
<p>The word corn, which we use today in modern English in North America, is associated with</p>
<p>this particular type of grain, what the Native Americans called maize.</p>
<p>But the word corn is still used in the more general sense of grain or other specific types</p>
<p>of grain, like wheat or rye, in certain parts of Europe.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to mention that it still has some variability in the way that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>used.</p>
<p>We also found in the original Indo-European language a word for yoke, which is the wooden</p>
<p>beam usually worn by a pair of oxen when they&rsquo;re pulling a plow, and the word for thill, which</p>
<p>is the pole to which animals were yoked when they were pulling the plow.</p>
<p>So again, this is telling us more about their lifestyle and the fact that they did in fact</p>
<p>practice agriculture.</p>
<p>They also had a word meaning to grow.</p>
<p>The Indo-European root word for grow also produced the word grass and green, and if</p>
<p>you think about it for a second, the connections start to become obvious.</p>
<p>As grass grows, it becomes green.</p>
<p>So all of those words are cognate.</p>
<p>They all came from the same original Indo-European word.</p>
<p>The Indo-Europeans also had a word, which has come down to us in modern English form</p>
<p>as acre.</p>
<p>It previously meant any enclosed piece of land.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same root word that led to agros in Greek, and that word agros is the basis</p>
<p>of the English word agriculture, as well as agronomy and agrarian.</p>
<p>So all of these words are interconnected.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all cognate.</p>
<p>This is also an example of Grimm&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>In fact, I mentioned this in the episode on Grimm&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>Remember that under Grimm&rsquo;s Law, the G sound shifted to a K sound in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So the modern English word acre and the Greek word agros, as well as the Latin word agar,</p>
<p>are all cognate.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European G sound shifted to a K sound to produce the word acre in modern</p>
<p>English.</p>
<p>This original Indo-European word is also the source of the word acorn, which originally</p>
<p>meant fruit of the open land or fields, but which eventually came to be limited to the</p>
<p>fruit of an oak tree in English.</p>
<p>So acre, acorn, agriculture, agrarian, and agronomy.</p>
<p>All of these words come from the same original Indo-European source word.</p>
<p>This is also a good point to make a quick digression related to the spelling of certain</p>
<p>words.</p>
<p>That word acre is spelled A-C-R-E.</p>
<p>Acre is like many words found in modern British English where the pronunciation is er, but</p>
<p>the spelling is R-E.</p>
<p>Think about words like fiber, center, and theater, which are all spelled with an R-E</p>
<p>in British English.</p>
<p>But these spellings started to change in America in the late 18th century and early 19th century.</p>
<p>The primary source of this change was Noah Webster, who published the first Dictionary</p>
<p>of American English.</p>
<p>He made these changes in the 1804 edition of his Speller and especially in the 1806</p>
<p>Dictionary which he published.</p>
<p>Webster had been a patriot during the American Revolutionary War, and in the aftermath of</p>
<p>that war and the creation of the United States, he felt that America needed its own dictionary</p>
<p>to reflect American English.</p>
<p>He also felt that British English spelling rules were antiquated and unnecessarily complex,</p>
<p>so he made changes to the spelling of certain words to reflect their actual pronunciation.</p>
<p>This included dropping the U in words like color, honor, and favor, and switching the</p>
<p>R and E in words like fiber, center, and theater.</p>
<p>Now remember that a lot of these words had come into English from original French sources,</p>
<p>and in French these words were spelled with an R-E at the end.</p>
<p>But they had become anglicized, and the pronunciation had shifted in English to more of an R sound.</p>
<p>But again, they were still retaining their original French spellings.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Webster changed the spelling of these words in his American Dictionary,</p>
<p>the words were not changed in Britain.</p>
<p>In fact, there they had the authority of Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s 1755 Dictionary, which had been</p>
<p>printed in London, and this became a point of national pride on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>The British kept the spelling that they had, which was reflected in Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary,</p>
<p>and Americans tended to change the spelling to reflect Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary.</p>
<p>But despite Webster&rsquo;s efforts, the R-E was retained in certain other words, even in</p>
<p>American English.</p>
<p>So the word acre retained the R-E spelling, as did a word like ogre.</p>
<p>In fact, the R-E spelling was generally retained in words where the R-E was preceded by a C</p>
<p>or a G.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Webster insisted to the end of his days that acre ought to be spelled</p>
<p>A-K-E-R, and in fact that was the way it was printed in editions of the Dictionary during</p>
<p>his lifetime.</p>
<p>But, eventually, the spelling A-C-R-E won out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to show the way words can be spelled differently in different English</p>
<p>dialects.</p>
<p>Of course, if you think about the word theater, we do still find it in American English spelled</p>
<p>T-H-E-A-T-R-E, but it&rsquo;s usually used to convey a touch of class or sophistication.</p>
<p>So we do, in fact, find both spellings in both dialects of English if we look for them.</p>
<p>Also, one last note about animals and plants before we move on to some other words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that there are a relatively large number of words for animals</p>
<p>in the original Indo-European language, both domesticated and wild animals.</p>
<p>But there are relatively few words for grains and vegetables.</p>
<p>And this tends to suggest that the original Indo-Europeans relied much more on animals</p>
<p>and animal domestication and husbandry than they did on agricultural farming.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re looking at more and more clues as to their lifestyle, and therefore</p>
<p>who these ancient Indo-Europeans were given the time period in which they lived.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn for a second and look at a couple of other words in the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the original Indo-Europeans had a word for honey.</p>
<p>Honey was the only source of sugar and sweetness in this period.</p>
<p>And they also had the original word for mead, which was methu.</p>
<p>And this confirms that the original Indo-Europeans knew how to get drunk because mead was an</p>
<p>alcoholic beverage made from honey.</p>
<p>And of course, it also confirms that they were in contact with honeybees because that</p>
<p>was the only source of honey.</p>
<p>Now, the word for mead also appears throughout the Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>In fact, the word not only occurs in English, but we also find it in Dutch, Icelandic, Danish,</p>
<p>Swedish, German, Irish, Lithuanian, Russian, Greek, Sanskrit, and even modern Persian.</p>
<p>So this is a word that was clearly there in the original Indo-European language, and it</p>
<p>continues to be found throughout the Indo-European languages today.</p>
<p>The original Indo-Europeans also had words for certain types of transportation.</p>
<p>Again, these are giving us more and more clues.</p>
<p>They had a word which was the source of the word wheel, and that word appears to have</p>
<p>been derived from a verb meaning to go round and round.</p>
<p>They also had a word which meant axle, which appears to be the same source word as axis</p>
<p>in Latin, which also came into English.</p>
<p>And they even had the word for wagon, which also appears to have come from a verb which</p>
<p>meant to go or transport by vehicle.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, they also had a word for yoke, which was the object which was worn</p>
<p>by oxen when pulling a wagon.</p>
<p>And they had a word for thill, which was the pole to which animals were yoked.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re starting to see here with words like yoke, thill, wagon, wheel, and axle is</p>
<p>that they did in fact have wagons, and those wagons were typically pulled by oxen or other</p>
<p>large animals.</p>
<p>So this is another big clue because we can look historically using archaeological evidence</p>
<p>to try to determine when the wagon appeared in the general region where we think these</p>
<p>people lived.</p>
<p>And it starts to give us more clues as to the time frame in which these people lived.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m just putting that out there for now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll deal with that in more detail in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a second and look at words which the original Indo-Europeans had for</p>
<p>building and construction.</p>
<p>They had a word for timber, which suggests that they used wood for construction.</p>
<p>And they also had words for house and door.</p>
<p>Now interestingly, house is a Germanic word of obscure origin, which came into Old English</p>
<p>and may have come from an original Indo-European root word, which meant hide, as in to conceal</p>
<p>oneself.</p>
<p>And it appears to be directly connected to the word hide, as in an animal hide or an</p>
<p>animal covering.</p>
<p>So we think that the word house came from that sense of covering oneself or concealing</p>
<p>oneself.</p>
<p>But the original Indo-European word for house was domo or domu.</p>
<p>And that word came into English from Latin in words like domicile, domestic, and domesticate.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the original Indo-European source word for house.</p>
<p>The actual English word house arrived later in Old English from unknown sources.</p>
<p>We also have many words for natural phenomena in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>We have words for fire, night, star, wind, air, sun, moon, snow, and winter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s interesting because we have those reconstructed words for snow and winter.</p>
<p>And that suggests that they could not have lived too far south.</p>
<p>So once again, we&rsquo;re seeing more and more evidence that these people lived in at least</p>
<p>temperate or colder climates of Europe.</p>
<p>And lastly in this episode, I want to look at words which the Indo-Europeans had for</p>
<p>body parts.</p>
<p>This included words for heart, lung, head, foot, tooth, ear, nose, lip, mouth, brow,</p>
<p>jaw, tongue, neck, brain, spleen, liver, and uterus.</p>
<p>With respect to nose, the original Indo-European word was nos and that eventually ends up in</p>
<p>Latin as nosus.</p>
<p>And it eventually came into English as nasal.</p>
<p>So nose and nasal are in fact cognate.</p>
<p>Again we have one source coming from the Germanic languages, nose, and nasal comes</p>
<p>to us via Latin.</p>
<p>And we see the same type of thing going on with tooth, which I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>In Latin, the word was dent or dentis.</p>
<p>Latin had a lot of suffixes, so if you remove the Latin suffix, it&rsquo;s basically just dent.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the source of the words dental, dentistry, and dentist.</p>
<p>But under Grimm&rsquo;s Law, the d sound had shifted to a t sound in the Germanic languages and</p>
<p>it produced the word tooth in English.</p>
<p>But again, all of those words are cognate, coming from the original Indo-European source</p>
<p>word.</p>
<p>Now up to this point, we&rsquo;ve looked at physical objects which existed in the Indo-European</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stop here and I&rsquo;ll finish looking at the original Indo-European vocabulary in</p>
<p>the next episode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to look at social terms contained in the language to get a sense of how these</p>
<p>people lived and what their culture looked like.</p>
<p>And after a bit more vocabulary and etymology, we&rsquo;ll then take a minute or two and look at</p>
<p>a little bit of Indo-European grammar, which may not sound all that interesting, but it</p>
<p>will serve as an introduction to Old English grammar since Old English actually inherited</p>
<p>much of its grammar from the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
