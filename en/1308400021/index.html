    <p>Hi friends! This is gonna be an episode of the things that I&rsquo;ve learned from being</p>
<p>around rich people. And this is the shit you ain&rsquo;t gonna find them as success</p>
<p>books and the self-help books and any of these books that you can fucking read or</p>
<p>any of this shit you see online. No. I&rsquo;m gonna tell you the things that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>observed from being in the lives of really rich people, from living day to</p>
<p>day with them, to interacting near them, just the way that their brain works, the</p>
<p>decisions that they make, the shit that they do, the way that they think. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna expose it all in this episode. Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t even realize how much</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve observed and how much I&rsquo;ve learned just from being friends with certain</p>
<p>rich people and just from like experiencing being in the day-to-day</p>
<p>life of someone rich. Because it&rsquo;s different when you see them like at work,</p>
<p>when you see them doing their job or running their business. It&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>when you see them in their home, in their like habitat, where they&rsquo;re relaxed and</p>
<p>where they make their decisions, where they like think through their thoughts</p>
<p>and like do you know what I mean? Like there&rsquo;s just a difference between seeing</p>
<p>someone in action versus seeing them at home. And this is the shit that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned from seeing these motherfuckers at home. So the first thing that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>observed is really rich people are very fucking quick to take action. So they</p>
<p>have an idea, they&rsquo;ll think a thought, and the gap between the time that they think</p>
<p>the thought and take their first action is like instant. Like it&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>fast and it&rsquo;s something I have to call myself out on a lot because I get in my</p>
<p>head. Like I&rsquo;ll think of something or I&rsquo;ll have an idea and then I won&rsquo;t act</p>
<p>on it or like I won&rsquo;t take it seriously. I&rsquo;ll just kind of like think about it</p>
<p>like oh that&rsquo;s a cute thought, it&rsquo;s a cute idea, and then I&rsquo;ll either think of</p>
<p>the reasons why it&rsquo;s unrealistic or whatever or I&rsquo;ll just overthink it</p>
<p>because I love to fucking do that. I&rsquo;m a rising Virgo. I overthink goddamn</p>
<p>everything. And this also applies to when someone tells them something. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>quick to like take it in and act on it. So whether someone gives them a book</p>
<p>recommendation, they&rsquo;ll start reading it the next day. If they want to learn a new</p>
<p>skill, they&rsquo;ll book a fucking class the next day or that day. If they want to</p>
<p>book a flight, they want to book a trip somewhere, they have an idea of like oh</p>
<p>my god I want to go on a trip, they&rsquo;ll book a fucking flight. They&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>looking up flights immediately. They&rsquo;ll look up their schedule, make sure they</p>
<p>have a gap, and then start looking for places they can start taking action to</p>
<p>make the trip come about. Or even like starting a new project. They want to</p>
<p>start a new thing. When they think the thought of they want to start a new</p>
<p>business or start a new project or whatever, they immediately start taking</p>
<p>steps to gain knowledge about it. So even if they&rsquo;re not taking like an action</p>
<p>step to like building a new business, they start learning about it. They start</p>
<p>looking at the market like immediately as they think about it. Like it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that day or the next day they&rsquo;re researching, they&rsquo;re learning, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gaining knowledge on whatever they can that goes along with that idea. Like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>just noticed the gap between very very rich people&rsquo;s thoughts and actions is</p>
<p>short. Like they fucking think shit and they take action very quickly. Okay the</p>
<p>next thing I noticed, and this one I came to the realization of recently, was</p>
<p>really really rich people are so confident in their ability to create</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re scared of it. Take that in for like two seconds. They&rsquo;re scared of</p>
<p>certain things because they&rsquo;re so confident in their ability to create.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re scared to focus on certain things that could hurt other people or</p>
<p>damage other shit. Because they know once they start thinking about shit, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna start creating. But it&rsquo;s because of their action. You know what I mean? It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just like this whole manifestation shit of like you just thinking it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen. Shut the fuck up. Alright that ain&rsquo;t fucking real. Manifestation is</p>
<p>real. I believe in that. But the whole thinking into your reality, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking believe in that. You got to move your ass bitch. Like Kim Kardashian said,</p>
<p>you got to get the fuck up and you got to work. There&rsquo;s too many lazy people</p>
<p>now Nate. Okay that was a little joke but it&rsquo;s the truth. So I&rsquo;ve noticed with</p>
<p>really really successful people like they&rsquo;re scared of certain shit because</p>
<p>they know that what they want they create. But to be scared of something you</p>
<p>have to be certain of it. So they&rsquo;re very certain of their ability to create. They</p>
<p>have such a solid confidence in it. But this confidence is something that we all</p>
<p>wish we fucking had. Okay and then I kind of figured out the way to like crack it</p>
<p>into like all of us had it you know. Like this is my little key to unlock it. We</p>
<p>all have the ability to create things. We all have free will. We all have the</p>
<p>ability to fucking bring what we want into existence. And if we don&rsquo;t see right</p>
<p>now how we can make something big come into our experience or to create</p>
<p>something huge, we at least know that there are certain steps we can take now</p>
<p>to get there. You don&rsquo;t have to know how to get to the end goal. You just have to</p>
<p>know how to start taking steps to get there. Does that make sense? But my whole</p>
<p>point in that is we can start creating now. You can start working toward what it</p>
<p>is you want now. But rich people&rsquo;s confidence and their ability to create</p>
<p>comes from repeated action. Confidence comes from doing something over and over</p>
<p>and over. Everybody wants to be confident but nobody understands that it comes</p>
<p>from proving to yourself that you can do shit over and over. You become confident</p>
<p>in something when it consistently performs. It&rsquo;s like when you have a new</p>
<p>car. You don&rsquo;t worry if it&rsquo;s gonna start or not. It just fucking starts. And every</p>
<p>time you go to start it, you&rsquo;re like getting revalidated that it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>start. And then eventually you just expect the car to start. You don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to think about it. But you&rsquo;re confident in the car&rsquo;s ability to start because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s proven it has started a hundred fucking times. Weird example, I know. But</p>
<p>confidence comes from repeated fucking action and doing the same fucking thing</p>
<p>consistently so that you&rsquo;re confident that you can predict it. That&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>confidence is. So these really really rich people that have had certain ideas</p>
<p>and have had certain thoughts and then took actions to make those things come</p>
<p>about and come into their reality are the ones with the confidence that they</p>
<p>can do it because they have done it. So if you&rsquo;re someone that wants the</p>
<p>confidence of like, oh I want to be so secure in my ability to create that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>scared of certain shit. Like I want to get there. But it comes from taking</p>
<p>action. That&rsquo;s the main thing. You have to fucking do the shit to gain the</p>
<p>confidence that you&rsquo;ll do the shit and that you can do the shit. But that</p>
<p>confidence goes for like anything. If you want to trust yourself, you have to</p>
<p>act in line with what you want. So if you want to be able to trust yourself to</p>
<p>look out for yourself, you have to look out for yourself and prioritize yourself</p>
<p>over and over and over. And then you will gain the confidence because then you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>just proven that you&rsquo;ve done it and you can do it and you will do it. And that</p>
<p>goes the same way for achieving your goals. If you can prove to yourself over</p>
<p>and over that you will work toward your goals and you will prioritize your goals,</p>
<p>you will become confident in your ability to create. Because you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>the actions and you&rsquo;re doing it. Confidence comes from doing. Confidence</p>
<p>is not just this feeling you have. Like that self-love we talked about, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just this feeling that pops out of your fucking ass. Confidence is not a feeling</p>
<p>that just pops out of your fucking ass. It is something you build. It is</p>
<p>something you work for. It is something you work toward. And it&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>you create. Your ability to create, let that start with your ability to create</p>
<p>confidence. Become confident in your ability to create things by creating</p>
<p>confidence for yourself. Do the fucking actions. Become confident. The fact that</p>
<p>you just created confidence and the feeling of confidence establishes that</p>
<p>you can create things. So congrats. It is in your control. And that&rsquo;s the main</p>
<p>thing I want to emphasize is it&rsquo;s in your fucking control. Not everything. Not</p>
<p>circumstances. But your actions are in your full fucking control. So your</p>
<p>ability to create is in your full control. And I know that might be a little</p>
<p>hard to hear at first, but you can try and fight it all you want. But when you</p>
<p>whittle it down and you boil it down, that&rsquo;s the fucking truth of it. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve had to realize recently and I fucking got upset</p>
<p>about it. I was pissed off. I was real fucking mad because I had to like face</p>
<p>it. Tough pill to swallow. And I didn&rsquo;t have no fucking water. And of course I</p>
<p>have to bring up the whole relationship to fear. And the fear of failure and not</p>
<p>succeeding and not getting something that you want. So whenever I talk to</p>
<p>someone that&rsquo;s successful, when I throw an idea at them of something to try or</p>
<p>do, they&rsquo;re like, okay do it. Like they, it just seems like they have zero</p>
<p>consideration for the potential of failure. Like they, they&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>just try it, just do it. And I&rsquo;m like, what if it doesn&rsquo;t work? And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, so what? They do not look at failure and success the way that typical</p>
<p>people do. So when someone that is successful and they trust their actions</p>
<p>and they trust their ability to create, if they say, okay, I want to make $100,000</p>
<p>a month. That&rsquo;s their goal. They&rsquo;re going to stick that road post down and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to start working toward it. They&rsquo;re committed to getting to that</p>
<p>goal. So they don&rsquo;t care how many ways they have to try to get there. They don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care about how many different roads they have to take. All they know and all they</p>
<p>trust is that they&rsquo;re going to find a way to get there because that is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in their control. They&rsquo;re not really that worried about, oh, well, what if I go</p>
<p>down this road and it doesn&rsquo;t work and I have to go down another one? They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, okay, I&rsquo;m just going to go down the other one. But they&rsquo;re committed to get</p>
<p>into that road post at all costs. So they don&rsquo;t consider going down a road that</p>
<p>leads to nowhere as a failure where I would. And that&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m having to switch</p>
<p>my mindset because I look at trying a certain thing and it not working or it</p>
<p>failing. I look at that as a failure. But that&rsquo;s just one way to get to the goal I</p>
<p>wanted to get to. There&rsquo;s unlimited possibilities of how you can get to</p>
<p>where you want to go. So just because you went down one route, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you</p>
<p>failed. That is not a failure. It&rsquo;s a failure if you stop. People that are</p>
<p>successful and people that are committed don&rsquo;t look at it as failure because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not stopping. They&rsquo;re committed to getting to where they said they</p>
<p>wanted to go. So they&rsquo;re gonna try a new route. Whether it takes 20 fucking times</p>
<p>or 20 different avenues, they&rsquo;re gonna try them all. But they don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>discouraged when something fails or one of the roads they take is a dead end.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get discouraged because they know that they&rsquo;re gonna go down another</p>
<p>one. They&rsquo;re gonna keep trying. They might be like, damn, they might be</p>
<p>disappointed that this road wasn&rsquo;t it. But they are never discouraged. They</p>
<p>always just come back to home base and start down the next fucking road. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get there. And that&rsquo;s where their solidification and their belief and</p>
<p>their commitment of like, I said I&rsquo;m gonna fucking get there, now I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>get there. And they don&rsquo;t look at coming back to home base and having to restart</p>
<p>and go down a different road as a setback or going to the same spot they</p>
<p>were before. Because they know who they are. Coming back to that same spot is a</p>
<p>whole different person. You have a whole different set of skills going down a</p>
<p>certain road. You have a whole different set of knowledge and experience to draw</p>
<p>off of. So you might be back in the same position, but you are not the same person</p>
<p>in that position. You are a more advanced person and you&rsquo;re a more equipped person</p>
<p>to go down the next road. So they never look at it as a setback. But an</p>
<p>important thing to remember is setbacks only exist if there&rsquo;s been progress. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m someone that gets caught up by- I look at shit as a failure. I&rsquo;m like, nah I</p>
<p>tried four things already. I&rsquo;m like, no they all failed. So I look at it as a</p>
<p>failure. But it&rsquo;s not a failure if I keep going. It&rsquo;s only a failure if you stop</p>
<p>trying. I&rsquo;m just trying to look at shit as like a redirection is when something</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work. Because every time I&rsquo;ve tried to do something on my road to</p>
<p>success and I&rsquo;ve run up against the dead end, I&rsquo;ve had to get on a new path. And</p>
<p>this is like my sixth fucking path with this shit. So I just happen to keep</p>
<p>reminding myself like it&rsquo;s only a failure if I stop. If I keep going and</p>
<p>keep trying, eventually I&rsquo;ll fucking get there. But if I say I&rsquo;m committed to</p>
<p>getting there, I can&rsquo;t stop. I have to keep trying until I get there. But I will</p>
<p>get there. And that mindset is something I&rsquo;ve seen consistent throughout all</p>
<p>successful people I&rsquo;ve been around. And it is so annoying sometimes because when</p>
<p>you are someone like me, that&rsquo;s like a normal person. And then you try to talk</p>
<p>to someone with this level of like confidence, fearlessness and also someone</p>
<p>with resources like money to fund the risks they want to take. They&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>just fucking just do it. But like for me, I just feel like there&rsquo;s a lot more to</p>
<p>take into consideration because I could lose this, I could lose that. But you</p>
<p>need to adopt that mindset of just fuck it, just figure it out, commit to</p>
<p>figuring it out and you will. That&rsquo;s it commit to figuring it the fuck out. And</p>
<p>you will no matter where you are. So the next thing that kind of goes off of that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really is its own point is really really rich people don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>themselves out of taking action. So if you have something that you know is in</p>
<p>line with your goals or there&rsquo;s an action in front of you that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>considering taking that could get you closer to where you want to go, a</p>
<p>successful person would not talk their self out of taking that action. They</p>
<p>would talk their self into taking that action. An example of this from my own</p>
<p>life is this is a stupid fucking example. Alright it&rsquo;s a little fucking example</p>
<p>just leave me alone, don&rsquo;t attack me. But it illustrates the point well. So I told</p>
<p>myself I&rsquo;m gonna post every day on tik-tok on my life coach tik-tok so that</p>
<p>I can build that audience and I can just share knowledge that I know because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working toward getting certified as a life coach so I can do one-on-one</p>
<p>sessions with people. I&rsquo;m gonna call them awareness appointments. You can book an</p>
<p>awareness appointment with me coming in June when I finish this fucking</p>
<p>certification. But part of that is I&rsquo;m trying to get people to understand how</p>
<p>my brain works so that they&rsquo;ll feel confident and feel like I have something</p>
<p>that I can provide them because I do see things from a lot of different fucking</p>
<p>angles that a lot of people don&rsquo;t think of. But I need to share that. I need to</p>
<p>expose that. I need to post about that. So I&rsquo;ve been posting daily on life coach</p>
<p>Leo on tik-tok and one day I was gonna post a video and I was like oh it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a good time it&rsquo;s like 11 a.m. it&rsquo;s like the algorithm doesn&rsquo;t really hit at this</p>
<p>time like whatever but I was like I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to post this later so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I can post it now or not post it and I was considering of just being</p>
<p>like okay I&rsquo;ll post it tomorrow so that I can have a better like chance at the</p>
<p>algorithm or whatever the fuck and in that moment I was like okay no fucker</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not talking yourself out of taking an action that is gonna get you</p>
<p>closer to your goal side note I did post a tik-tok anyway at the time that I</p>
<p>thought of it just in this moment and it did well anyway so that was good but I</p>
<p>became aware in that moment of like don&rsquo;t talk yourself out of taking the</p>
<p>actions that are helping you get toward your goal like the whole point of what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing by posting on the fucking tik-tok account is to share the</p>
<p>knowledge I have and the perspectives that I&rsquo;ve gained and that is my goal is</p>
<p>to share that shit and I was talking myself out of doing the action that</p>
<p>would get me to that you know like I talk myself out of it because I was like</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s not a good time yada like my fear not really my fear but I was just</p>
<p>trying to have too much fucking control over that it&rsquo;s like just do the actions</p>
<p>that are gonna get you where you want to go even if posting these tik-toks</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work for me and they don&rsquo;t make anyone want to fucking have a call with</p>
<p>me I at least took the actions and I&rsquo;m confident that I&rsquo;ll now take the actions</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve posted every fucking day and like that is building in itself in me</p>
<p>but anyway the direct action that was helping me achieve what I set out to</p>
<p>achieve I try to talk myself out of successful people do not fucking do</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t get in their fucking head like that they don&rsquo;t like hold</p>
<p>their self back when they have the urge to move forward like success is a</p>
<p>forward-moving energy masculinity is a forward-moving energy too but like being</p>
<p>driven reaching your goals moving towards shit it&rsquo;s a forward-moving</p>
<p>energy so you can feel it in yourself it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ll get this sudden urge to</p>
<p>do something when you feel that urge when you feel that energetic pull that</p>
<p>pulls you forward take the fucking action because I felt it when I was like</p>
<p>okay I should post a tik-tok right now I felt that forward-moving pull and I</p>
<p>talked to myself against it do not fucking do that successful people do not</p>
<p>cut off their forward-moving energy they walk in the direction of it that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>huge fucking realization I had but that&rsquo;s a sensation you can feel in your</p>
<p>body when you have an idea or an urge to do something and it feels like taking</p>
<p>action take the action do it don&rsquo;t talk yourself out of it literally use this as</p>
<p>a reassurance of motherfucker take that action trust me now I do need to say I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not talking about if you&rsquo;re out in public and somebody says some shit and</p>
<p>you feel that urge inside you to lunge forward and swing on them I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>talking about that I&rsquo;m talking about go with the feelings that make you feel</p>
<p>pulled forward with what comes to your goals okay even if it don&rsquo;t make fucking</p>
<p>sense just do it like starting this podcast it only happened because I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t cut off my forward-moving energy the day I had the idea to start a</p>
<p>podcast I just got the fuck up and did it I for once in my life was like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>done overthinking shit I&rsquo;m done with that like I just got the random urge on</p>
<p>a fucking Saturday on a random Saturday I got the urge of like huh maybe I</p>
<p>should start a podcast and it made me sit up in my chair so I was like fuck it</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do it so I literally walked to this fucking closet I&rsquo;m standing here</p>
<p>right now I record this in a closet so it&rsquo;s like padded and you can like the</p>
<p>sounds good you know but I walked my ass this fucking closet I sat down and I</p>
<p>fucking recorded my first podcast episode I didn&rsquo;t let myself overthink</p>
<p>it I didn&rsquo;t let myself get stressed out I just was like fuck it even if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere I at least had fun but I was like let&rsquo;s just do it like</p>
<p>just do the fucking podcast so I did it I set that on my computer I edited it I</p>
<p>fucking got online made the little cover art for it in 10 minutes I found out how</p>
<p>to host the podcast I googled it and I posted the fucking podcast and I</p>
<p>scheduled it for the next day Sunday that&rsquo;s how this podcast started and</p>
<p>because I followed that forward-moving energy that one day it&rsquo;s got me to where</p>
<p>I am now I&rsquo;ve had to do it multiple times like every week I have to follow</p>
<p>that forward-moving energy to make the fucking podcast and sometimes that ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there sometimes I have to push myself to do it but my whole point is when I had</p>
<p>the initial idea to create the podcast I felt that forward pull and I didn&rsquo;t cut</p>
<p>it off I was at a point where I was so tired of talking myself out of taking</p>
<p>actions and acting on my ideas that I was just like you know what this podcast</p>
<p>is gonna be the one thing I don&rsquo;t overthink I&rsquo;m just gonna fucking go for</p>
<p>it and just do it and it&rsquo;s been the one thing that has been the most rewarding</p>
<p>for me so when you feel that fucking pull to get up and do something do not</p>
<p>talk yourself out of it get up and take the action get up and do it okay my next</p>
<p>point my next observation from these rich motherfuckers I&rsquo;m trying to get</p>
<p>like is they accept a reality very quickly so when something happens they</p>
<p>accept the situation at hand immediately they don&rsquo;t get caught up in their</p>
<p>emotions they don&rsquo;t dwell on it they don&rsquo;t freak out about oh my god this</p>
<p>could have went this could have happened this could have went different I could</p>
<p>have done this the you and so-and-so could have done this is their fucking</p>
<p>fault they don&rsquo;t point the finger they don&rsquo;t get mad about what could have been</p>
<p>different they get clear about what they can control right now they damage control</p>
<p>now given what just happened what are we gonna do it&rsquo;s like if a plane crashes</p>
<p>smart and successful people are not gonna start freaking the fuck out</p>
<p>because the plane just crashed what they&rsquo;re gonna do is they&rsquo;re gonna grab</p>
<p>their fucking shit they&rsquo;re gonna help whoever needs to be helped with a safety</p>
<p>slide they&rsquo;re gonna get their fucking ass out of the plane and they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>get on the little safety fucking boat they&rsquo;re gonna take the actions that need</p>
<p>to be taken in the moment and they&rsquo;ll reflect later when you reflect on</p>
<p>something you reflect because in the past when something happens like the</p>
<p>plane fucking crashing sitting in your seat and freaking the fuck out is not</p>
<p>gonna do anything you need to get it together you need to grab yourself by</p>
<p>your fucking hand and help yourself you need to do what you need to do in that</p>
<p>moment given what just happened sitting in the seat freaking the fuck out</p>
<p>blaming the pilot oh my god I can&rsquo;t believe this just happened saying shit</p>
<p>like that just sit in there freaking out is gonna do nothing it&rsquo;s not gonna help</p>
<p>you at all it&rsquo;s gonna fucking hurt you cuz the plane sinking bitch I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if planes sink I&rsquo;m just giving you a fucking example okay don&rsquo;t yell at me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a pilot I don&rsquo;t be knowing how planes work but that&rsquo;s the thing is they</p>
<p>focus on what needs to be handled in the moment so when the plane goes down</p>
<p>what needs to happen like your safety needs to be your priority you need to</p>
<p>find a way to make sure you&rsquo;re safe and that you&rsquo;re okay so successful people</p>
<p>are gonna be very direct in getting to that they&rsquo;re gonna take the actions that</p>
<p>are in line with getting their self to safety same thing when something happens</p>
<p>with fucking business it&rsquo;s like if I run a business and I have two employees and</p>
<p>they get into a fight and they fuck up something and I&rsquo;m supposed to send</p>
<p>something to another company and their little altercation made it where I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t send what I needed to send I&rsquo;m not gonna waste my time yelling at them</p>
<p>and trying to sort out their fight and I don&rsquo;t care who&rsquo;s in the wrong I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care who&rsquo;s to blame what I need right now is my motherfucking shit done so I</p>
<p>can send it to my other company I don&rsquo;t give a fuck whose fault it is I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a fuck what&rsquo;s going on what I&rsquo;m concerned about is the goal I need and</p>
<p>the objective I have if my goal is to send whatever information I need to send</p>
<p>to another company and these people just inhibited that I&rsquo;m not focused on the</p>
<p>people I&rsquo;m focused on the problem at hand and how I&rsquo;m gonna solve it because</p>
<p>whoever&rsquo;s to blame it doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter right now I&rsquo;m objective I need to</p>
<p>get done what I need to get done successful people focus on what is</p>
<p>urgent and they&rsquo;ll reflect later I&rsquo;ll go cuss my fucking employees out and fire</p>
<p>who needs to be fired and hear out the situation after my problem is handled</p>
<p>successful people handle the problems at hand and do the shit that needs to be</p>
<p>done now they don&rsquo;t get caught up in the bullshit of whose fault it is how it</p>
<p>could have been different yada fucking yada they handle what needs to be</p>
<p>handled and they reflect later like I said you reflect on things that are in</p>
<p>the past you don&rsquo;t reflect while they&rsquo;re happening I guess another way to</p>
<p>put it is really successful people and forward-moving people don&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>theirself get distracted by what is not fucking important and by what is not</p>
<p>gonna get them to their goal and to what they want to accomplish they stay</p>
<p>objective and something else that I kind of learned from nursing about like a</p>
<p>chaotic situation so I gave the example about being in a plane that crashes a</p>
<p>lot of people have an emotional reaction and they can&rsquo;t control whether they</p>
<p>freak the fuck out fight or flight you know or freeze some people freeze but</p>
<p>these people that don&rsquo;t allow for distractions are very controlled and</p>
<p>going into nursing I had to learn to become very controlled in the face of</p>
<p>trauma literal fucking traumatic events people being mutilated coming in with</p>
<p>limbs hanging off you have to learn how to fucking gather yourself because you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t make a mistake you can&rsquo;t fuck up someone&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s in your hand so you</p>
<p>need to learn how to fucking gather yourself and one way that I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>how to do that is to observe the moment whenever you&rsquo;re facing something that is</p>
<p>serious and you need to gain control of yourself in that situation observe it</p>
<p>take literally feel like taking a step back inside your body and observe the</p>
<p>situation just look at the situation from like a top-down view and look at</p>
<p>what is the priority what is the most important thing right now in this room</p>
<p>or whatever the situation is what is the top priority what is the main goal so if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s saving this person&rsquo;s life that&rsquo;s dying in front of me okay get objective</p>
<p>what would need to be done takes you out of the fear it takes you out of all the</p>
<p>chaos everything going on you organize your thoughts you get your action steps</p>
<p>going you ask yourself what step would need to happen next and then do it and</p>
<p>then keep asking yourself what would need what needs to happen next and then</p>
<p>do it what needs to happen next for this person and then do it do the same thing</p>
<p>with your goals what needs to happen next and then do it but it&rsquo;s very easy</p>
<p>to gather yourself in a chaotic situation after you do it a bunch like</p>
<p>the confidence thing I talked about that&rsquo;s a skill you build and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>learn how to get very controlled it does not matter the circumstance and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll still be able to think clearly under pressure just looking at the</p>
<p>situation and observing the situation okay this is what is going on and these</p>
<p>are the interventions that would be helpful you don&rsquo;t focus on anything else</p>
<p>you focus on what needs to be done so that&rsquo;s kind of like my two cents and how</p>
<p>I relate that to my life and how I&rsquo;ve gained this skill but I learned how to</p>
<p>do it in an extreme environment I need to learn how to fucking do it with goals</p>
<p>and other shit too like remain objective remain goal-oriented and focused and</p>
<p>stop letting other shit get in the way because that is something I&rsquo;ve observed</p>
<p>across all rich people I&rsquo;ve encountered is they&rsquo;re very objective now some can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>control their fucking emotions so when something chaotic does happen they do</p>
<p>freak the fuck out because they&rsquo;re not emotionally controlled but with</p>
<p>everything else they&rsquo;re objective and what needs to be done and the actions</p>
<p>that need to be taken when they&rsquo;re not in a high emotional state okay my next</p>
<p>point so they invest money into different things than like normal people</p>
<p>air quote normal people and I&rsquo;m not saying a stock market a lot of them be</p>
<p>in the stock market but I don&rsquo;t fucking get it I don&rsquo;t understand the stock</p>
<p>market so I&rsquo;m not even gonna try and tell you to get into that shit cuz I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know the first thing to fucking tell you but they invest into</p>
<p>gaining knowledge and they invest into gaining skills a lot of them buy online</p>
<p>courses and there&rsquo;s certain courses you can take for like anything you can find</p>
<p>a fucking online course for anything they range from like $100 to $1,000 to</p>
<p>$5,000 whatever it is you can go and take these online courses and I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>a lot of people talk about online courses are gonna become the new like</p>
<p>air quote college because the amount of information and the amount of skills you</p>
<p>can gain from some of these courses for $1,000 beat the shit out of a full</p>
<p>degree that are like tens of thousands of dollars and way more time so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something really high on like the new wave is like you can learn anything you</p>
<p>want to learn now online you can get any kind of like knowledge you fucking</p>
<p>need because there&rsquo;s people making courses on everything definitely look</p>
<p>into the people you&rsquo;re getting a course from because some of them are fucking</p>
<p>wackos but my main point with this is like people invest in their knowledge</p>
<p>and then skills so whether that&rsquo;s courses podcasts wink wink what you just</p>
<p>did so I&rsquo;m proud of you look at you and skills so it will take classes for</p>
<p>things to like they&rsquo;ll go to like a physical class if they need to learn a</p>
<p>new skill but rich people invest in their self and I&rsquo;m not saying they go</p>
<p>take their self to the fucking beauty salon and they get a massage and they do</p>
<p>this and they do that they invest in the things that will increase the value they</p>
<p>have to offer so adding more knowledge adding more skill sets adding more</p>
<p>perspectives which is like comes with like reading and listening to shit like</p>
<p>this that increases the value you&rsquo;re able to offer which makes you able to</p>
<p>make more money because having more skills means you can provide more value</p>
<p>the more value you provide the more money you make it&rsquo;s a basic equation but</p>
<p>my point with this one is instead of buying a fucking Gucci bag or going to</p>
<p>buy some stupid-ass shit look at the skills you could purchase instead look</p>
<p>at the knowledge you could purchase instead because there&rsquo;s plenty of time</p>
<p>to buy a fucking Gucci bag okay I&rsquo;m wanting to speak because that was a</p>
<p>motherfucker with a with a ton of designer shit for no reason but now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>investing in courses and all these things that are gonna help me grow like</p>
<p>my life coaching thing has cost me about $4,000 and I&rsquo;m okay with investing in</p>
<p>that girl that shit hurt my feelings okay four grand oh I&rsquo;m gonna be really</p>
<p>real like I hurt my fucking feelings immensely and I will not be eating out</p>
<p>for quite some time but I&rsquo;m willing to invest that money into the skill sets</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna learn and into getting the certification that I need because that</p>
<p>is gonna make me better at what I&rsquo;m trying to do which will make me be able</p>
<p>to charge for it so it makes sense because right now it&rsquo;s like I have my</p>
<p>podcast to stand on but I don&rsquo;t have really any certification so it&rsquo;s like as</p>
<p>soon as I get that and then gain some more knowledge for the business aspect</p>
<p>and the like one-on-one coaching aspect I&rsquo;m gonna be able to provide a lot more</p>
<p>value so I&rsquo;m investing in that I&rsquo;m investing in the knowledge that I need</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve seen is very consistent throughout all the</p>
<p>successful people I&rsquo;ve been around they&rsquo;re all down they don&rsquo;t skimp on</p>
<p>that shit like that&rsquo;s another thing is rich people be weird like sometimes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll skimp on like certain things and like sometimes they&rsquo;ll blow a lot of</p>
<p>money so like I know one guy that buys like $100,000 guitars and like blows</p>
<p>money on stupid-ass shit like that but will like trip over like drinks being</p>
<p>too much at a bar like it&rsquo;s the funniest shit because like it&rsquo;s like if two shots</p>
<p>is like 30 bucks he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s like disgusted he gets mad but it&rsquo;s like girl</p>
<p>you buying $100,000 fucking guitars but most rich people have like places where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very frugal and places where they&rsquo;re willing to spend ridiculous</p>
<p>amounts of money but the one area that all of them are fine with investing a</p>
<p>lot of time and money into is building their skill sets and their knowledge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s been consistent throughout all of them so remember when</p>
<p>I said I was gonna be real vulnerable about something this is the point my</p>
<p>next one that I&rsquo;m gonna share so really successful people are not afraid to look</p>
<p>like an asshole so when they have a goal and they decide that they want</p>
<p>something they&rsquo;re gonna go for it and they don&rsquo;t let potentially looking like</p>
<p>a bad person or looking like an asshole get in their way so if they need to take</p>
<p>certain actions to get to where they want to go they&rsquo;re gonna do it they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care that they&rsquo;re gonna hurt other people&rsquo;s feelings or that other people</p>
<p>are gonna look at them like they&rsquo;re an asshole they prioritize their goal and</p>
<p>they fucking go for it they don&rsquo;t let things get in their way they don&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s opinions like fuck with them like they&rsquo;re so they put their blinders</p>
<p>on so they&rsquo;re so focused on their goal that they don&rsquo;t even consider what other</p>
<p>people are like thinking about it you know but another thing is with my life</p>
<p>right now I just came back from Cabo and I had a full like revelation like a</p>
<p>whole mindset flip and shift while I was there part of that is like when I</p>
<p>got home I was like I&rsquo;m about to turn into a fucking like workhorse like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>about to drill so hard into the things that I want to achieve and what I want</p>
<p>to work on like I&rsquo;m about to fully put all my energy into the goals that I have</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna be unapologetic about it but with doing that here it comes we</p>
<p>come back to the part about being afraid to look like an asshole the</p>
<p>people around me are about to think I&rsquo;m a fucking dick because I&rsquo;m not gonna be</p>
<p>hanging out with my friends I&rsquo;m not gonna be going out to party anymore I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not gonna be out doing the shit that I used to do I&rsquo;m about to be so fucking</p>
<p>busy I&rsquo;m about to neglect all the relationships in my life to a certain</p>
<p>extent and I feel bad about that but I need to fucking do what I need to</p>
<p>fucking do to get to my goals but if I sat here and stress myself out and told</p>
<p>myself all the reasons why I need to be a good friend and how I&rsquo;m a bad friend</p>
<p>if I start focusing on myself and I need to still make time for other people and</p>
<p>I need to not work so much that I can have extra time for others it&rsquo;s like no</p>
<p>if what I want to spend my time on is what I want to spend my fucking time on</p>
<p>because I have goals then so be it if people aren&rsquo;t understanding of that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry no love lost I still care about you but I need to do what&rsquo;s best for</p>
<p>fucking me and I need to finally just crack down and run straight fucking</p>
<p>headfirst into my goals I&rsquo;m done fucking around I&rsquo;m done feeling bad I&rsquo;m sick of</p>
<p>it because I&rsquo;m trying to do a balance of like chase my goals but also people</p>
<p>please and make sure everybody&rsquo;s not mad at me but it&rsquo;s getting to the point</p>
<p>where worrying about what people are thinking of me and worrying about</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s reactions to me is holding me the fuck back from what I want so now I</p>
<p>get to pick one I get to pick ruthlessly go for your fucking goals or pick the</p>
<p>people and the life you have now I don&rsquo;t fucking want the life I have now so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>at a point I have to just go for what I have to go for and that&rsquo;s what I want</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the life that I want to create and I have to just do it and I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>have to look like a fucking dick I&rsquo;m gonna have to hurt people&rsquo;s feelings and</p>
<p>pull back and not be as available and it sucks but I don&rsquo;t fucking want this life</p>
<p>anymore I want better I want more and I&rsquo;m finally at the place where I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>alright I need to go forward with it and I talked to one of my friends about this</p>
<p>that is really successful and he said Leo I&rsquo;ve been watching you and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>waiting for you to get to this point because I see it in you you just had to</p>
<p>get pushed here because you have too big of a heart you needed to get pushed to</p>
<p>the point where you just said fuck it and just did it and he&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m happy</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re finally here because now you&rsquo;re about to skyrocket and that was</p>
<p>really nice validation but this is the point I took from him was you can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>afraid to look like an asshole if you want to achieve your goals you have to</p>
<p>go for them you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t have the best of both worlds you can&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>try to be leveling up and still be dealing with the people that are on the</p>
<p>level that you were on before you&rsquo;re gonna have to go you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>step up the staircase and fucking go and if people don&rsquo;t grow with you then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on them so that&rsquo;s my biggest point with all of</p>
<p>this and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been the hardest for me because I care so much and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to hurt people and I don&rsquo;t want anyone to feel bad about their self</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m at the point where it&rsquo;s me or them and I&rsquo;ve picked other people for so</p>
<p>long and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gotten me to where I am now and I don&rsquo;t fucking like</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m at so I have to pick me if I want to get out of here I have to pick</p>
<p>me if I actually want to get to a life that I want to live so moving on to my</p>
<p>last point I feel like it&rsquo;s like two points being smart it&rsquo;s gonna fuck you</p>
<p>when you try to become successful and what I mean by being smart is being too</p>
<p>much of like a street thinker being too paranoid being too like analytical and</p>
<p>trying to outweigh everything and like think of the bad options thinking of the</p>
<p>way shit can go wrong and bad it&rsquo;s gonna bite you in the fucking ass cuz it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bit me forever so really really dumb people it&rsquo;s easy for them to make money</p>
<p>and there are so many stupid fucking unaware ass emotionally immature ass</p>
<p>people that are so rich because achieving success for them is easier</p>
<p>when you only see one perspective you&rsquo;re able to just drill forward and only see</p>
<p>that when you see a lot more perspectives there&rsquo;s a lot more to take</p>
<p>into consideration people that are asleep have a lot less to consider</p>
<p>people that are aware and people like you and me are gonna have a lot more</p>
<p>trouble because we&rsquo;re gonna be so overwhelmed because we see so many</p>
<p>perspectives to consider smart people have their brain working against them</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re aware we have our brain working against us in this way but you</p>
<p>have to learn from the dumb motherfuckers you have to learn from the</p>
<p>ones that are so blind to their one perspective and just go for it like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it seems simple for dumb people because they&rsquo;re considering a lot less so I just</p>
<p>want to validate you on that if it seems like stupid people are making it work</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just taking off and it just works out so easy for them it does it</p>
<p>literally seems like it for them because they&rsquo;re not as stressed out as we are</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not overthinking like we do they&rsquo;re not trying to consider every</p>
<p>fucking thing that we see they don&rsquo;t see it so they&rsquo;re free to just work</p>
<p>toward what they want but my point here is we can still make it work we just</p>
<p>have to remember that simplicity is key and we have to learn the skills to</p>
<p>reassure ourself and to be there for ourself and to calm ourself when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>emotional and fucking keep taking action the necessary part of what we need to do</p>
<p>is in the action stop with the overthinking stop with the fucking</p>
<p>bullshit just do the action reassure yourself that the action is what is</p>
<p>gonna get you where you need to go like with my tick tocks when I was gonna post</p>
<p>that one tick tock and I was like oh the algorithm it&rsquo;s not a good time don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even worry about it take the actions that are gonna get you where you want to</p>
<p>go because even if the algorithm was bad at that time I still posted the video it</p>
<p>was still seen by certain people even if it did bad which it didn&rsquo;t but even if</p>
<p>it were to have done bad I still am one step closer that action still got me</p>
<p>closer than if I didn&rsquo;t take the action at all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like going to the gym so the action of going to the gym and working out is</p>
<p>what determines the growth you are only going to grow if you go to the gym and</p>
<p>work out or lift weights or wherever you need have to go to the gym if you just</p>
<p>lift weights and your goal is to gain muscle lifting weights is the only thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna get you there but someone like us will overthink shit we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>oh what supplements do I need what time is the best to go what should I eat</p>
<p>before let me look at the diet let me look what I needed to be eating let me</p>
<p>make sure I&rsquo;m doing all the right exercises let me look up and make sure</p>
<p>all the scientific proven fucking shit it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>the micro details the supplements the bullshit on the side is not what</p>
<p>determines the growth the literal just the act just the act of lifting the</p>
<p>weights is what determines the growth so focus on that focus all of your</p>
<p>energy on lifting the fucking weights which means doing the action that is</p>
<p>gonna get you where you need to go don&rsquo;t focus on the fucking supplements don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>focus on the fucking bullshit don&rsquo;t distract yourself from taking the</p>
<p>physical action that is gonna get you where you need to go and that&rsquo;s my best</p>
<p>example with the working out thing because I stress out and I get all up in</p>
<p>trying to find the best of this and the best of that and I&rsquo;m always trying to</p>
<p>find a shortcut in a quick way but it&rsquo;s like that all that energy I could have</p>
<p>been using and just doing the action of working out more put your focus on what</p>
<p>actually need to take simplify it stop overthinking listen to this podcast as</p>
<p>many times as you fucking need because I need this reassurance too and I know</p>
<p>this sounds like stupid but I listen to my podcast sometimes because it feels</p>
<p>like a smarter version of me like when I feel dumb or I feel sad or I feel</p>
<p>whatever I feel like it&rsquo;s the smarter version of me that&rsquo;s like talking to me</p>
<p>so I get to feel comforted by it and that&rsquo;s why I say just listen to it if</p>
<p>you need to because I do sometimes like when I&rsquo;m down and I don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>smart Leo and I&rsquo;m just like sad Leo sad depressed Leo like I need smart Leo to</p>
<p>knock some sense into me so my last point is something I&rsquo;ve observed that</p>
<p>successful people never do and it&rsquo;s taken a long time for me to realize</p>
<p>through the contrast because this is something that I&rsquo;ve done in the past</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve had to learn to stop doing it and it&rsquo;s trying to make myself</p>
<p>comfortable with being uncomfortable so when something happens or I realize that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like something about my life a successful person will never try to just</p>
<p>cope with it and make their self be okay with it people that are wired for</p>
<p>success instantly look for ways to start changing it and bettering their</p>
<p>situation they&rsquo;re not gonna try to comfort their self and make their self</p>
<p>cope with whatever they&rsquo;re dealing with they&rsquo;re gonna look at whatever&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>their control to make their situation better and this is something that I</p>
<p>observed about two years ago and I&rsquo;ve actively started doing it but it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of those things like with awareness it&rsquo;s like once you gain the awareness you</p>
<p>have to act I&rsquo;ve talked about it before this takes it to a whole new extent</p>
<p>because successful people I&rsquo;ve seen like they don&rsquo;t try to make their self okay</p>
<p>with the bare minimum they don&rsquo;t try to make their self accept less they want</p>
<p>more and they don&rsquo;t try to make their self even settle for less they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even try to make their self settle for less they understand it&rsquo;s not acceptable</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna do what they can to change it and I&rsquo;m not talking about when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re emotionally uncomfortable or like you&rsquo;re upset by something that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>different process of how to handle yourself I&rsquo;m talking about a situation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in whether it&rsquo;s a relationship in your life or financially you&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>certain situation you&rsquo;re not happy with it or like your job and you know you</p>
<p>want more as soon as they become aware they want more or they want better they</p>
<p>start moving toward it they start looking at what&rsquo;s in their control and</p>
<p>taking actions that they can to improve their situation they do not waste energy</p>
<p>and they do not waste time trying to become okay with where they are they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>okay with not being okay where they are and using that to change shit so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a huge part of it that has made a big impact on my life like I don&rsquo;t cope</p>
<p>anymore and I don&rsquo;t try to make myself okay with shit being bad or less than I</p>
<p>want and I&rsquo;m the type person you can ask anyone that&rsquo;s been around me I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>type to make the best out of a situation like even if we&rsquo;re stuck in a shitty</p>
<p>fucking situation I&rsquo;m gonna find a way to have fun because sometimes there are</p>
<p>situations where there&rsquo;s nothing you can control to change the situation so you</p>
<p>might as well have fun while you&rsquo;re in it you might as well extract what you</p>
<p>can out of the situation while you&rsquo;re stuck in it reminding yourself that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna end but look for all the ways that you can control the outcome and you can</p>
<p>control the quality of the position that you&rsquo;re in and motherfucker act on it</p>
<p>like trust me there&rsquo;s so much more that you&rsquo;re not seeing than you even realize</p>
<p>because as soon as you open up to trying to see what is in your control only then</p>
<p>will you be a match vibrationally to seeing all the possibilities you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seeing before so switch your mindset from trying to get comfortable and make</p>
<p>yourself okay with not living the life that you want do the opposite look for</p>
<p>ways to make yourself uncomfortable with the life that you have so it lights a</p>
<p>little fire under your ass to start making changes if you like this podcast</p>
<p>I just have one request and it&rsquo;s that you go leave me a five-star rating thank</p>
<p>you so much if you want to keep up with me all of my social media will be linked</p>
<p>in the description of this podcast and also if you&rsquo;re interested on one-on-one</p>
<p>coaching with me it is now an application process so due to the high</p>
<p>demand I&rsquo;ve had to make an application process to try and filter some things</p>
<p>out and get matched up with people who are actually a good fit for me to work</p>
<p>with because I only want to work with people who are truly ready for major</p>
<p>transformation and want to fast-track their results I want to work with people</p>
<p>who are ready to rock this shit you know and the people that I specialize</p>
<p>with are the ones that have been looking for answers and the ones that have been</p>
<p>trying shit and it&rsquo;s not working so if you want to apply to be one of my</p>
<p>clients I will put the link for the application in the description also once</p>
<p>again thank you for listening be safe god damn it and I&rsquo;ll talk to you next</p>
<p>Sunday</p>
