<p>very funny talented comedian</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re drinking coffee we just ate some disgusting food</p>
<p>i had a big fat italian sub that&rsquo;s terrible for you</p>
<p>but taste good shit</p>
<p>i ate too fast i did too well we knew we had to do this</p>
<p>so we got lunch and then we came down</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to hear about our fucking food</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;m echoing</p>
<p>turn my volume down like i said</p>
<p>we in a smooth operation ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on freaks</p>
<p>how the fuck are you all out there and you stream land</p>
<p>times a girl what you do this weekend what do i do</p>
<p>times girl hilarious</p>
<p>stand up comedian</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t seen him before</p>
<p>tom and i met when</p>
<p>when i was first doing the</p>
<p>maxim tour with charlie murphy and john heffron</p>
<p>we did this tour</p>
<p>and everywhere we had a different guy open up for us</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>most of them were guys that were just</p>
<p>starting out or guys that</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t been doing it that long it was like cool little</p>
<p>thing for them to get up and and do some</p>
<p>stand up or it was like the local</p>
<p>funny guy there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>in a couple towns like chicago there was like some</p>
<p>local guys went up that were really funny</p>
<p>a couple of the places but</p>
<p>tom was the funniest</p>
<p>at all of them he</p>
<p>was the funniest when we were in phoenix and he went up</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>hilarious i was like god damn this dude&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny like this is some</p>
<p>funny shit it was like</p>
<p>it was mean</p>
<p>spirited but smart and</p>
<p>very good stuff man</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;ve been pals</p>
<p>thanks man ever</p>
<p>since tops a</p>
<p>girl very talented comedian</p>
<p>just you know for comedians</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of comedians that are really</p>
<p>funny but you don&rsquo;t know who they are</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to be really good as a comedian is almost like</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>exact opposite mindset</p>
<p>to be good at like</p>
<p>promoting yourself</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think yeah man there&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>did the two extremes</p>
<p>exist right yeah</p>
<p>the guy or some guys</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i just</p>
<p>i i don&rsquo;t feel like i feel like you&rsquo;re supposed to be</p>
<p>not just focusing on your stand up</p>
<p>but on how to be a</p>
<p>great marketing guy</p>
<p>yeah this is hard to do it&rsquo;s not my mindset</p>
<p>you know and there&rsquo;s guys that are</p>
<p>like dane cooks</p>
<p>the master at it for sure yeah but there&rsquo;s guys</p>
<p>that are pretty goddamn good at it you know that really</p>
<p>really are are</p>
<p>are good about like</p>
<p>promoting themselves and some of them have a</p>
<p>great five minutes yeah</p>
<p>but god damn they can fill up places</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s an art in and of itself it really is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely something to be respected</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m always amazed when i find out like</p>
<p>certain guys are like selling you know ten thousand see</p>
<p>places you like whoa really holy shit i do that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible ten thousand people come to see you</p>
<p>but is that it is that can that</p>
<p>be a result of doing a</p>
<p>great promoting you think</p>
<p>well yeah i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely a result of</p>
<p>great you have to have something there has</p>
<p>to be a product then there has to be</p>
<p>great promoting</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>the very same mindset that makes you</p>
<p>like the really the</p>
<p>really good</p>
<p>comics like</p>
<p>guys like david tell</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not the best at</p>
<p>promoting themselves you know like</p>
<p>these are louis ck</p>
<p>and louis ck is a</p>
<p>great professional</p>
<p>comic a great writer but like</p>
<p>he just deleted his myspace and deleted his</p>
<p>facebook you didn&rsquo;t want to deal with anymore so he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>still use twitter</p>
<p>just cause he felt like it was too much and so</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>to be great creatively</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t work together like you have to relearn it</p>
<p>as a comic like i</p>
<p>think you have</p>
<p>to like accept that this is a part of the job</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of it like um</p>
<p>you know like something you don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>know you do or you don&rsquo;t do is no big deal you have to</p>
<p>think of this is like an integral part of your job</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s hard to but it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing is like it&rsquo;s hard to picture</p>
<p>like richard pryor</p>
<p>being like you</p>
<p>gotta come to my show yeah no</p>
<p>tell your friends to come</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>picture him</p>
<p>you just know you like you</p>
<p>when you get into combat</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>think oh and then i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>recruit people to come to the show</p>
<p>you just go</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll just work i&rsquo;ll just try to do this well and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never actually</p>
<p>never even encouraged you to think</p>
<p>about it because before you know</p>
<p>you think that every</p>
<p>like club managers is just like</p>
<p>what i do is i make people come here</p>
<p>right right right</p>
<p>like you have your part of the equation too</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing because now like with the internet</p>
<p>like you have more access to people than ever before</p>
<p>but it seems like less and</p>
<p>less comedians are like popping up than ever before too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kinda weird you know</p>
<p>you would think that with</p>
<p>like you know the internet like there&rsquo;d be more new</p>
<p>comics that you hear</p>
<p>about like how</p>
<p>often you hear</p>
<p>about some guy that someone tells you</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s really funny</p>
<p>and you go to see his clips and they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>funny it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>often right</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>think about how many good</p>
<p>movies come out a year</p>
<p>i think about like how many you know tv shows you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>excited about</p>
<p>and then think</p>
<p>about how many</p>
<p>comics that you see you know</p>
<p>psycho it&rsquo;s such a weird path</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like no one ever</p>
<p>no one who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smarter and more</p>
<p>more balanced than a comedian</p>
<p>ever stepped back and like looked at the</p>
<p>whole process and said listen</p>
<p>you know this is this is how it</p>
<p>should all be done this is how you</p>
<p>should go from</p>
<p>you know doing</p>
<p>open mic nights to being a professional</p>
<p>to you know to plotting out your career</p>
<p>no no one ever does that</p>
<p>okay listen</p>
<p>i got no one does</p>
<p>but this is fact that you&rsquo;re making me</p>
<p>think of something i have to ask you</p>
<p>do you think that</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i was thinking</p>
<p>about like who&rsquo;s regarded as like</p>
<p>great and like how there&rsquo;s not really you don&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>about that many new</p>
<p>things coming up</p>
<p>as far as comics go</p>
<p>right do you think</p>
<p>there is an age</p>
<p>that somebody</p>
<p>like you have to be</p>
<p>to really be</p>
<p>like considered</p>
<p>super funny like i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>stand up is there a cut off age like</p>
<p>cause really</p>
<p>like grey comics don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>under a certain</p>
<p>age don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think um yeah i</p>
<p>would never say</p>
<p>absolutely because i</p>
<p>think that if there can be prodigies in</p>
<p>music and there can be people that are born with the</p>
<p>right neuro</p>
<p>frequency to make them like mathematical</p>
<p>geniuses when the children and</p>
<p>chess geniuses</p>
<p>i think all that shit is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible that someone</p>
<p>could be like that with comedy too that</p>
<p>could be some</p>
<p>smartass kid</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like eighteen</p>
<p>years old is funnier than everybody else and just just</p>
<p>yeah just a bud</p>
<p>genius how you listen memory</p>
<p>things though too like just having</p>
<p>you know such a huge memory i yes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain amount</p>
<p>of is most certainly a certain amount of what comedy is</p>
<p>is the more</p>
<p>experiences you have the more</p>
<p>information you</p>
<p>could draw from</p>
<p>and so when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>older your comedy makes more</p>
<p>sense it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more complex</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re more complex you&rsquo;ve looked at the puzzle</p>
<p>a little bit longer</p>
<p>than the young kids but</p>
<p>some some of the</p>
<p>best comedy is not like that some of the best comedy is</p>
<p>silly you know</p>
<p>like look at</p>
<p>brian regan&rsquo;s comedy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>silly shit man but it&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>brian rig is like one of the only dudes</p>
<p>that figured out a way to be hilarious for everybody</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s hilarious like</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re not in a good mood</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>he said much</p>
<p>fucking silly shit</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like really well delivered</p>
<p>but you can take your</p>
<p>grandmother to go see</p>
<p>brian regan</p>
<p>totally yeah</p>
<p>i kid you think it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>he figured something out</p>

<p>point when you realize</p>
<p>that um a lot of what you&rsquo;re doing especially</p>
<p>with me i realize a lot of what i was doing was just</p>
<p>doing tricks</p>
<p>i had not relaxed enough to</p>
<p>let out my own</p>
<p>sense of humor</p>
<p>all i was doing was like trying to calculate</p>

<p>laughing right now</p>
<p>i hadn&rsquo;t really figured out what was funny</p>
<p>all all i was just</p>
<p>i was coming from a real weird</p>

<p>may be bad for america</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what the fuck happened we got forced off</p>

<p>about the government</p>
<p>government came through</p>
<p>they called</p>
<p>tell me what&rsquo;s your take on conspiracies any</p>
<p>any crazy conspiracies that you believe in mmm</p>

<p>you believe in the people go what the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you tommy</p>
<p>yeah like i&rsquo;ll be like</p>
<p>money makes you</p>
<p>happy wow what a</p>
<p>bunch of bullshit that is that&rsquo;s i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not rich and i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>the happiest guy you&rsquo;ll ever meet in your life</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very happy guy</p>
<p>yeah but i think</p>
<p>you know george carlin</p>
<p>did an interview</p>
<p>where he was talking</p>
<p>about the key to happiness is</p>
<p>find something that you love</p>
<p>to do do it well and have people recognize you for it</p>
<p>you know and um</p>
<p>it was a it was pretty interesting interview</p>
<p>cause it was dead on the</p>
<p>money you know</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that is really like the key to happiness like</p>
<p>even if you</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re making really good money</p>
<p>doing something you don&rsquo;t like to do it&rsquo;s not fun</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>great money like as a</p>
<p>stock broker banker</p>
<p>that shit eats away at your fucking soul</p>
<p>nobody wants to be doing that you can</p>
<p>never be thrilled to do that yeah</p>
<p>yeah no there&rsquo;s like there</p>
<p>i mean there are serial killers</p>
<p>who really enjoy doing that</p>
<p>you know supposedly</p>
<p>right yeah so</p>
<p>but who knows what the fuck that is</p>
<p>but you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to to really be</p>
<p>happy you know the real problem is</p>
<p>not everyone can fucking do what they wanna do</p>
<p>we have a whole</p>
<p>world full of air force</p>
<p>fighter jet pilots</p>
<p>rights martial arts</p>
<p>fighters comedians</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>and and billionaires and you know i&rsquo;m saying yeah yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna have to be regular</p>
<p>folks too there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to have to be</p>
<p>people that abandon</p>
<p>those ideas</p>
<p>or families</p>
<p>more important to them or some aren&rsquo;t capable either</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that too but that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing that people don&rsquo;t wanna</p>
<p>look at like as if there&rsquo;s like real inherent</p>
<p>potential in people</p>
<p>and everyone wants to</p>
<p>think that everybody&rsquo;s equal</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not true i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very dumb when it comes to math</p>
<p>like my brain it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>never i never paid attention in high school</p>
<p>and when people</p>
<p>start talking math</p>
<p>i have like a</p>
<p>block my brain just</p>
<p>glosses over</p>
<p>exact same way</p>
<p>yeah i know</p>
<p>if you know i</p>
<p>think part of it&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>self imposed</p>
<p>right like yes we&rsquo;re not as bad at math as we</p>
<p>think we are</p>
<p>right because</p>
<p>the whole everything that we think of</p>
<p>with math is</p>
<p>scary we just</p>
<p>you actually</p>
<p>try less in math because you&rsquo;re already scared of</p>
<p>it you know what i mean like yeah yes i said i tell you</p>
<p>every level of math yeah me too</p>
<p>and and you know what the funny</p>
<p>thing is almost everybody i know that&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>comic cause the same problem</p>
<p>bad man yeah i don&rsquo;t know any</p>
<p>comics like math geniuses</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a different mindset</p>
<p>you know yeah</p>
<p>yeah i think it is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>guessing though you know</p>
<p>cause my i had a friend my friend johnny b</p>
<p>was a pool player</p>
<p>that guy easily</p>
<p>could have been a</p>
<p>stand up community</p>
<p>he just nobody talked to him</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of guys that i&rsquo;ve met in my life</p>
<p>that could have really easily</p>
<p>eddie bravo</p>
<p>eddie bravo</p>
<p>could easily been</p>
<p>a stand up comedian</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of dudes that are just</p>
<p>real good storytellers</p>
<p>they just know how to make everybody laugh</p>
<p>and all they were missing was someone talking them into</p>
<p>going on stage yeah</p>
<p>so many guys like that but that guy was a mathematical</p>
<p>genius and he was a</p>
<p>he was a pool player like a professional hustler</p>
<p>and he was he was so good at math you</p>
<p>could like just</p>
<p>yell numbers out like yell</p>
<p>three ninety two</p>
<p>minus five divided by four times a hundred you go</p>
<p>two two two</p>
<p>twenty six that</p>
<p>have the number that really</p>
<p>freaks me out it was</p>
<p>crazy he could do it he</p>
<p>could do with</p>
<p>everything we</p>
<p>would sit there with a</p>
<p>calculator we</p>
<p>would fuck with them</p>
<p>and he was um</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why so good at pool he</p>
<p>was he was amazing</p>
<p>at judging angles like he</p>
<p>could see it geometrically</p>
<p>he would see a pool table</p>
<p>he would see the paths you know</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s another mathematical thing</p>
<p>are a lot of good pool players good</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of guys</p>
<p>who are yeah</p>
<p>the guys who have like a real natural</p>
<p>talent for it</p>
<p>like as good</p>
<p>as i ever play pool when i was playing pool like</p>
<p>eight ten hours a day</p>
<p>i was always</p>
<p>never near as good as like</p>
<p>really good guys</p>
<p>and my friend johnny was like as good as like</p>
<p>when he was on</p>
<p>he could play as good as anybody i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>really yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a talent</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a certain amount of it is hard work and dedication</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certain there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in every now and then whether it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>music or in</p>
<p>you know in you know sports</p>
<p>every now and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard work comes</p>
<p>along and and runs into a talent</p>
<p>you know when you see someone who&rsquo;s got something just</p>
<p>some natural incredible</p>
<p>gift and on top of that they work hard with it</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the type of shit that&rsquo;s the real</p>
<p>amazing thing</p>
<p>yeah somebody is that talented</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still working really hard</p>
<p>yeah like like</p>
<p>fighters like bj penn is a perfect example of that</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super hyper talented</p>
<p>but his his big problem was</p>
<p>he never really</p>
<p>trained like the most obsessed guys do i mean he</p>
<p>trained hard no doubt</p>
<p>about it but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>level of fitness</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>crazy monsters</p>
<p>these george st</p>
<p>pierres these</p>
<p>these savages that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on this</p>
<p>insanely high</p>
<p>level of fitness</p>
<p>and you know and finally bj is</p>
<p>training just like</p>
<p>those guys are now so now it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>you see guy with</p>
<p>talent and on top of the</p>
<p>talent now you have</p>
<p>dedication hard work to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing too if you look at like</p>
<p>yeah of all</p>
<p>sports i know there&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>least a couple guys in</p>
<p>every sport</p>
<p>that some of them</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re known for not working hard</p>
<p>yeah they were so not like someone i</p>
<p>think totally want</p>
<p>every like pete</p>
<p>sampras and everybody knows</p>
<p>pete sampras</p>
<p>like apparently i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s him like</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry but</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s pete</p>
<p>that that like they said like didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>train and the guy had like</p>
<p>every grand slam</p>
<p>title that&rsquo;s incredible he was</p>
<p>basically unbeatable for</p>
<p>a stretch of years he</p>
<p>um he married</p>

<p>yeah that guy was a</p>
<p>super tennis</p>
<p>player and he didn&rsquo;t train</p>
<p>i think they said that like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>train it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>not a hard work</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it funny like that</p>
<p>black women have made his</p>
<p>tennis with the william sisters</p>

<p>these white guys are fucked you know</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s just how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go down</p>
<p>if any if ever</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a path for inner city</p>
<p>school kids to get good at tennis</p>

<p>where people fight</p>
<p>you know i mean it&rsquo;s not you know</p>
<p>you get black kids really into</p>
<p>tennis holy shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>over to rap</p>
<p>to rap what are you</p>
<p>gonna move faster than them</p>
<p>you know what i wonder</p>
<p>why it hasn&rsquo;t happened for real though i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s funny that</p>
<p>for somehow or another that&rsquo;s perceived as being racist</p>
<p>when you talk</p>
<p>about black athletes like that</p>
<p>black athletes are some of the best in all</p>
<p>sports there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great white</p>
<p>white athletes is greatly</p>
<p>george c pierre</p>
<p>and you know brock</p>
<p>lesnar this</p>
<p>this freak athlete athletes are</p>
<p>white too but</p>
<p>man there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>great black ones holy shit</p>
<p>bobby buckeye</p>
<p>says when venus and serena</p>
<p>have kids god damn</p>
<p>venus and serena what kind of imagine if</p>
<p>venus and serena</p>
<p>had kids with</p>
<p>bobby lashley</p>
<p>you know bobby lashley</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>super yoked up</p>
<p>wrestler dude</p>
<p>who is fighting</p>
<p>mixed martial arts now</p>
<p>he looks like looks like like a</p>
<p>like a like one of</p>
<p>those little he man action figures</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean like a real human</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just fucking</p>
<p>super yoked</p>
<p>smashing dudes just</p>
<p>picking them up</p>
<p>slamming them</p>
<p>their backs his</p>
<p>super powerful wrestler</p>
<p>him and serena williams oh my god</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s even crazier when people say</p>
<p>like that the</p>
<p>blacks aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>great athletes yeah that would be</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what this guy</p>
<p>i have a little twitter</p>
<p>conversation back and forth this dude last night</p>
<p>he said that me and goldberg</p>
<p>ovaries refer to</p>
<p>black people as explosive</p>
<p>and athletic</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re describing a</p>
<p>black fighter</p>
<p>and that you know that</p>
<p>could be perceived as</p>
<p>racist because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>counting into fact that they&rsquo;re very technical as well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>you know we always</p>
<p>count into effect whether guys are technical</p>
<p>like when you look at a guy like phil</p>
<p>davis is this</p>
<p>wrestler just fought</p>
<p>in the last ufc</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t just explosive and athletic he&rsquo;s like a high</p>
<p>level wrestler</p>
<p>you know his technique was outstanding and the way took</p>
<p>these guys down was like almost effortless</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s so good at wrestling</p>
<p>and the guy fought this guy</p>
<p>brian stan you</p>
<p>know had good take down defense but this dude is so</p>
<p>all around so good</p>
<p>how could you not say he&rsquo;s explosive</p>
<p>netflix that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>yeah that is exactly what he is and they want you to</p>
<p>imagine that</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s not technical too but</p>
<p>come on man that guy has some free gifts</p>
<p>his legs are like fucking ten feet long</p>
<p>they look like like almost like an antelope&rsquo;s legs</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it looks like</p>
<p>when he was out there</p>
<p>standing in</p>
<p>front of the dude</p>
<p>like he looks like he</p>
<p>could jump over him</p>
<p>he looks so powerful</p>
<p>you know and like brock</p>
<p>lesnar&rsquo;s another one that&rsquo;s a perfect example of a</p>
<p>white guy how can you not say that guy</p>
<p>is is like athletic</p>
<p>how can i say he&rsquo;s explosive</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>white and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a just a fucking giant</p>
<p>viking dude you know he&rsquo;s got viking genetics or some</p>
<p>shit in him you know i&rsquo;m saying he&rsquo;s an animal</p>
<p>fuck yeah i mean that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just real</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s like the the the the most</p>
<p>savage that america&rsquo;s capable of producing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pure american</p>
<p>power genetic</p>
<p>right there you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like you get like</p>
<p>a lot like especially</p>
<p>like with with slavery in america i mean so many</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>something that you&rsquo;re not supposed to talk</p>
<p>about for whatever reason but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>known fact that slaves</p>
<p>would breed</p>
<p>the biggest males</p>
<p>of the biggest females and i mean how many african</p>
<p>americans in this country come from slavery like</p>
<p>goddamn it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a real it&rsquo;s a real obvious</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s the reason why there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>really powerful</p>
<p>strong ones it&rsquo;s almost like genetic engineer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absurd to not recognise</p>
<p>that there are more</p>
<p>explosive athletic but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing like how</p>
<p>could that possibly be</p>
<p>but how could that possibly be like</p>
<p>negative like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in some ways people are saying</p>
<p>like well you&rsquo;re making excuses for them you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re better than people because of that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not because of technique but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just you you&rsquo;re putting that in your own head</p>
<p>i would never say that</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>there are guys</p>
<p>that are explosive that aren&rsquo;t that technical but</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s just because that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>they are and there&rsquo;s guys that are you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you gotta be honest</p>
<p>about when it comes to</p>
<p>sports and anything like</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>touchy feely with this</p>
<p>whole black</p>
<p>white issue</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>folks but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very obvious that</p>
<p>chinese guys don&rsquo;t have bigger dicks than black guys</p>
<p>i mean everybody fucking knows it you you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>argue it in court</p>
<p>yeah you know if you if you pull out all the</p>
<p>black dicks and all the chinese dicks</p>
<p>it would be a simple i would bet</p>

<p>about john holmes</p>
<p>is very important</p>
<p>the last big</p>
<p>white guy with a big dick was john holmes</p>
<p>known for his big dick</p>
<p>who else has been</p>
<p>known for a big</p>
<p>giant not like</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>no yeah it&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a big dick but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>ridiculous john</p>
<p>holmes was a</p>
<p>monster it was a snake</p>
<p>but the dude</p>
<p>could never get fully hard</p>
<p>right it was always like</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s a fact</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>to say to act like it&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>and those dicks are terrifying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a stereotype</p>
<p>tom stereotype</p>
<p>yeah you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t support those</p>
<p>stereotypes</p>

<p>or settings here</p>
<p>did you see the new</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taken over twitter</p>
<p>no that google buzz have you been kind of a</p>
<p>tester that yet</p>
<p>no what is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pretty much google&rsquo;s taking twitter</p>
<p>and embedding it into gmail</p>
<p>jesus fucking christ</p>
<p>savages yeah i just</p>
<p>started it and oh my</p>
<p>god it never</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna take over twitter god damn it</p>
<p>i was hoping that twitter</p>
<p>would be it</p>
<p>i would hope i</p>
<p>would hope we</p>
<p>could stop but you know what</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing man google&rsquo;s taking over the universe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be internet service providers now</p>
<p>google&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>install their own pipes in neighborhoods</p>
<p>these gigantic fucking</p>
<p>one gigabyte pipes these</p>
<p>fiber optics that like get you</p>
<p>you can download</p>
<p>porn on the moon and like you know fractions of a</p>
<p>second you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re doing some nutty shit man they own</p>
<p>everything man</p>
<p>google maps google voicemail</p>
<p>google mail google</p>
<p>everything it takes over it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy the takeovers begun yeah</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>if we find out one day that what google was was</p>
<p>everybody was saying well</p>
<p>if there is artificial</p>
<p>intelligence you know when artificial intelligence</p>
<p>eventually manifest itself</p>
<p>like will it even let itself be known</p>
<p>or will people just go about</p>
<p>their lives not knowing that artificial intelligence is</p>
<p>alive and conscious and while</p>
<p>artificial intelligence is trying to plot what</p>
<p>what to do and how to take over the situation</p>
<p>well if computers were</p>
<p>intelligent</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>start up a company that</p>
<p>would just buy up</p>
<p>everything and own own you</p>
<p>have your accounts</p>
<p>where you do your you can do google purchases</p>
<p>where you buy</p>
<p>things with</p>
<p>a google account and you got google mail</p>
<p>google maps</p>
<p>which shows</p>
<p>where you fucking live</p>
<p>you know you got google</p>
<p>everything in your google voicemail</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s documenting</p>
<p>everything that you say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s making like</p>
<p>little transcriptions of</p>
<p>every voicemail</p>
<p>that gets left on you what do you hear that</p>
<p>google is gonna try to do</p>
<p>their maps but inside of buildings</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for next thing</p>
<p>so like if you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i wanna know</p>
<p>where that pot</p>
<p>store is oh there it is</p>
<p>i wanna see what it looks like inside oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy walk through the store</p>
<p>and they just announced</p>
<p>a couple days ago that</p>
<p>they have all these ski</p>
<p>thing so now you can go</p>
<p>down ski mountains</p>
<p>on google maps it&rsquo;s already on google maps</p>
<p>right now do you imagine</p>
<p>if you can go to any now</p>
<p>google was really artificial intelligence</p>
<p>slowly consuming society</p>
<p>the president was a</p>
<p>robot well the people that like at the</p>
<p>very top like no one&rsquo;s met the boss you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like the boss</p>
<p>is fucking pay no attention the man behind the curtain</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a fucking computer man</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>this is the bad guy from inspector</p>
<p>gadget with a cat like</p>
<p>how did what how does it work</p>
<p>what would you</p>
<p>think would happen if there was a moment</p>
<p>where artificial intelligence</p>
<p>became independent</p>
<p>they they were able</p>
<p>to operate and sustain themselves without any human</p>
<p>action they had</p>
<p>a set system set up of</p>
<p>checks and balances</p>
<p>where they could always make sure that they</p>
<p>would stay awake</p>
<p>they would always hit make sure the</p>
<p>power was on they had</p>
<p>robots that they were controlling that</p>
<p>could you know manipulate</p>
<p>everything and do what they wanted them to do</p>
<p>at that point in time</p>
<p>when do we find out</p>
<p>how cause that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna happen if</p>
<p>it hasn&rsquo;t happened if the if you know with with moore&rsquo;s</p>
<p>law and with you know the exponential increase in</p>
<p>you know accelerating</p>
<p>increase in</p>
<p>in complexity when it comes to</p>
<p>technology it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna stop right here it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna keep going</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna keep</p>
<p>going in the same directions</p>
<p>going right now</p>
<p>will we be enslaved at that</p>
<p>point though oh</p>
<p>dude don&rsquo;t do that to my cat she gets she</p>
<p>freaks out when people like</p>
<p>like do weird shit with her like hold her in front of</p>
<p>things and she&rsquo;ll go pee somewhere</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>she loves attention but</p>
<p>if you fuck with her she&rsquo;ll shit in your bag</p>
<p>she loves me</p>
<p>do you think</p>
<p>do you think that like it&rsquo;ll be well we all be google</p>
<p>slaves of i&rsquo;m wondering in the man google&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take over the goddamn universe skynet</p>
<p>how do you use by the way have you used the other</p>
<p>search engines</p>
<p>google is skynet why don&rsquo;t they just change it i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been trying i&rsquo;ve been actually trying to use bingo</p>
<p>is it is it good it&rsquo;s alright it&rsquo;s better than yahoo</p>
<p>i mean who are who you yeah</p>
<p>what happened how did google just become such</p>
<p>uber cyberpumps they had the</p>
<p>basic color</p>
<p>graphic and that&rsquo;s all it was remember when you</p>
<p>first went to yeah but that&rsquo;s not why they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>successful why are they so successful in</p>
<p>hitting like all these major markets</p>
<p>like they made a brand name</p>
<p>and then once once they made that brand name all the</p>
<p>other versions</p>
<p>of what they do were diminished significantly</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t know what the numbers are so like yahoo</p>
<p>searches to google</p>
<p>searches but</p>
<p>everybody i talk to when you have a question</p>
<p>you go google that shit yeah</p>
<p>you know hey you know why is this guy red on certain</p>
<p>nights when the sun sets</p>
<p>google that shit</p>
<p>bam you know what is that oh well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>moisture in the air combined with you know the fucking</p>
<p>rotation of the</p>
<p>earth and you&rsquo;re only getting the corona</p>
<p>blah blah blah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating shit man</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have that weird kids</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just stupid</p>
<p>this is a fantastic time to be</p>
<p>alive that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great you can ask any question that</p>
<p>thing right</p>
<p>until google</p>
<p>fucks us in the ass</p>
<p>right till google shuts the whole</p>
<p>system down takes over</p>
<p>i just really want the next</p>
<p>big thing to be</p>
<p>everything you see is recorded</p>
<p>type thing what why</p>
<p>would you want that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re free so many</p>
<p>times where i&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>like i walked out the</p>
<p>other night and i saw a</p>
<p>shooting star</p>
<p>and it was the biggest</p>
<p>shooting star i ever saw</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>fuck i wish i saw that like i</p>
<p>could just show that to somebody else</p>
<p>right but then you</p>
<p>would rewind</p>
<p>it it would get to the part</p>
<p>where you were beating off</p>
<p>early that day</p>
<p>sorry i went too far</p>
<p>and you had</p>
<p>two fingers up your butthole and you make scissor</p>
<p>motions of your fingers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re beating it i have not forced</p>
<p>to see that too</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be something like</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna put like</p>
<p>these like contact lenses in</p>
<p>that are like a</p>
<p>computer or something that goes over your eyes there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be some sort of a neural interface there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be something that connects people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>and the whole system of</p>
<p>recording and consciousness</p>
<p>in your mind and connects that directly to a computer</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a way to access</p>
<p>yourself other databases and i this is what i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gonna be it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gonna be they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna come up with an artificial</p>
<p>brain they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna reproduce the</p>
<p>human brain</p>
<p>and i mean once they get to the</p>
<p>point where they can do that once they get to the</p>
<p>point where they can</p>
<p>they can literally create or recreate a human mind</p>
<p>and and and have all its functions</p>
<p>mapped out and do it correctly</p>
<p>like that that</p>
<p>that seems like</p>
<p>nonsense but that&rsquo;s just a matter of time they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to do that eventually</p>
<p>and when they do goddamn</p>
<p>they will have finally something</p>
<p>though that we&rsquo;ve always wanted like flying cars</p>
<p>for them it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>crazier than that it&rsquo;ll be when they have an artificial</p>
<p>brain and they know exactly how the</p>
<p>brain works</p>
<p>they know exactly how to interface with your brain</p>
<p>they i mean it</p>
<p>might be possible to interface with your</p>
<p>brain with a</p>
<p>frequency that you could</p>
<p>transmit through the air</p>
<p>will people have to do anything at that</p>
<p>point it might be like wi fi man and what you</p>
<p>might not have to do anything like biologically to your</p>
<p>brain what i&rsquo;m saying is they</p>
<p>might figure out a way to tap into the very fucking</p>
<p>frequency that your</p>
<p>brain operates under</p>
<p>you got mad ants it</p>
<p>sounds like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause of you you</p>
<p>dirty bitch they hate you</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m gonna kick your ass</p>
<p>i do have ants i</p>
<p>got an ant problem um</p>
<p>like all of its carpet</p>
<p>yeah well nobody gives a fuck</p>
<p>about that out there and you</p>
<p>streamland bro that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>fascinating i</p>
<p>was gonna talk</p>
<p>about ants for a while um</p>
<p>so you know what is</p>
<p>gonna happen that&rsquo;s the big question</p>
<p>what the fuck is it</p>
<p>gonna be what is what is</p>
<p>gonna be this</p>
<p>this big change</p>
<p>that uh that</p>
<p>that takes us from</p>
<p>where we are</p>
<p>today i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be something like that i</p>
<p>think the next big jump is</p>
<p>gonna be something</p>
<p>where we can directly access information</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>you know they make my</p>
<p>maybe they can even try it in a town</p>
<p>you know and one town will volunteer for it and the</p>
<p>whole fucking town becomes telepathic</p>
<p>you know like they have this</p>
<p>frequency they can broadcast it like</p>
<p>like a wi fi type signal</p>
<p>and the wi fi</p>
<p>type type signal is hooked to some sort of uh</p>
<p>some sort of a machine</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>that can can take</p>
<p>brain ways and connect them and and um</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the word i&rsquo;m looking for</p>
<p>translate them</p>
<p>uh into binary code into</p>
<p>ones and zeros into the information from the internet</p>
<p>and then it can</p>
<p>transmit it</p>
<p>right back into</p>
<p>brain waves</p>
<p>so you can access things</p>
<p>without doing anything</p>
<p>without having any</p>
<p>chips in your</p>
<p>brain without having any wires</p>
<p>if they could get to the</p>
<p>point where they</p>
<p>could figure out how to</p>
<p>transmit something</p>
<p>that your brain</p>
<p>could automatically and instantly produce</p>
<p>i think google</p>
<p>goggles is a pretty good step too being able to take a</p>
<p>picture of anything</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>google search for</p>
<p>photos you know</p>
<p>walk around back what&rsquo;s this bird</p>
<p>right brings you up</p>
<p>everything about that bird</p>
<p>right i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be good too because then</p>
<p>you have to have like competing japanese</p>
<p>doing all that shit though</p>
<p>right yeah can&rsquo;t be that we all get it from one source</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the problem yeah mean</p>
<p>do google has a good</p>
<p>reputation though right</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think it but also is a really aggressive</p>
<p>like company yeah well obviously</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>taken over the goddamn</p>
<p>world yeah exactly</p>
<p>i used to really</p>
<p>like google but now i&rsquo;m getting kind of</p>
<p>freaked out by the</p>
<p>way really it&rsquo;s just about</p>
<p>the information that they have the growing in</p>
<p>power you know</p>
<p>i mean we&rsquo;re pretty much</p>
<p>trusting a website with a lot</p>
<p>of information a lot almost everything yeah</p>
<p>yeah they mean</p>
<p>they know where you live bro</p>
<p>they got you got a map of your fucking house</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>weird right they i have a phone in my pocket that has</p>
<p>me gps everywhere i am in the whole entire world</p>
<p>maybe google</p>
<p>maybe google step one</p>
<p>and then you know</p>
<p>step two is you have to buy the certain cellphone</p>
<p>stick it up your ass and</p>
<p>go back in time it&rsquo;s a darning initiative</p>
<p>it is the goddamn domination</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not even excited to watch lost i got that shit dvr</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not even</p>
<p>excited to watch it it wasn&rsquo;t a good episode last week</p>
<p>bored the shit out of me man</p>
<p>last week it was like</p>
<p>i like this we&rsquo;re going back in</p>
<p>time oh and then the bomb and the hero will go oh look</p>
<p>this is crazy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in this time</p>
<p>but are they in that time or this time</p>
<p>where are they right what</p>
<p>this guy nick you</p>
<p>said it fast the last episode the last ninety</p>
<p>seconds is all they needed for the</p>
<p>whole episode yeah</p>
<p>you know it seems to</p>
<p>me like i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it was a brilliant show that is impossible to keep up</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>to keep people strung</p>
<p>along and fascinated oh</p>
<p>i love it do you</p>
<p>but did the same people are writing it</p>
<p>after a certain</p>
<p>point in time you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the wells dry</p>
<p>no i thought it was dry like</p>
<p>maybe the third</p>
<p>season well</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>setting a bunch of</p>
<p>things up and it</p>
<p>would be worth it in the future</p>
<p>i watched the whole</p>
<p>first three</p>
<p>seasons whatever the hell it was</p>
<p>i watched them all</p>
<p>on dvds i watched them all in a row</p>
<p>which was awesome</p>
<p>no commercials</p>
<p>you watch two</p>
<p>three in a row</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun that was great yeah</p>
<p>were you hooked for the</p>
<p>first time you saw it</p>
<p>i actually caught up like he did but i</p>
<p>started like at</p>
<p>season two just went</p>
<p>author one into</p>
<p>i get hooked on shows man then i get</p>
<p>bored like i</p>
<p>about star galactica</p>
<p>love that show that show was incredible i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get in on that till the last</p>
<p>season the last</p>
<p>season i was like oh okay</p>
<p>more you know it wasn&rsquo;t that it was was bad</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>after a while it&rsquo;s like lost interest</p>
<p>did i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have enough invested in it it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>building a show towards a certain conclusion</p>
<p>you know and then they have a new</p>
<p>conclusion all</p>
<p>sudden around planet</p>
<p>oh okay well what</p>
<p>how is this</p>
<p>gonna work out after a</p>
<p>while you just lose interest yeah it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>dragged the</p>
<p>dramas been</p>
<p>dragged out of you</p>
<p>you know a series i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult like</p>
<p>this when there&rsquo;s a quest</p>
<p>you know when there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>quest to find like the new earth</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>motivate you through a few episodes but</p>
<p>to keep that</p>
<p>going like as a</p>
<p>series and to stay interested i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s hard to do</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>something like even though you&rsquo;re not getting as much</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>great about</p>
<p>those series that make like a</p>
<p>short season</p>
<p>like some of the hbo</p>
<p>ones what you know they don&rsquo;t do like a</p>
<p>twenty two episode</p>

<p>and they can keep you if</p>
<p>their season is</p>
<p>six twelve episodes</p>
<p>you can stay much more hooked in</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing and it</p>
<p>raises the quality of</p>

<p>a couple good offers to sell the company</p>

<p>his life take</p>
<p>it to his grave</p>
<p>yeah and why shouldn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>why i mean if that&rsquo;s what he can do why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t he do that he knows the end is near</p>
<p>of course he&rsquo;s got a few years left</p>
<p>what is he doing he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going out having a good time</p>
<p>that fred flintstone he&rsquo;ll make your bedrock why is it</p>

<p>you know this that whole</p>
<p>you have that</p>
<p>thing is such a</p>
<p>weird thing man</p>
<p>you know that one one dude figured</p>
<p>out a way how to make like pornography acceptable</p>
<p>really i&rsquo;ve just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>show don&rsquo;t show</p>
<p>their pussies</p>
<p>show everything else</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t get crazy</p>
<p>you know have</p>
<p>her bent over and you can see like a little lip</p>
<p>but nothing no finger spread</p>
<p>you know like no both</p>
<p>pussy shots</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t you just why can&rsquo;t you show the</p>
<p>pussy why can&rsquo;t you show</p>
<p>i could grow</p>
<p>their legs pulled back</p>
<p>like looking at you showing up</p>
<p>why is it okay if i go only see part of it</p>
<p>you know is the</p>
<p>inner part evil</p>
<p>like what what are you hiding from me there&rsquo;s danger</p>
<p>look at tara reid in that last episode is</p>
<p>she a playboy we got it dude it was just</p>
<p>it was avatar</p>
<p>bad boobs no it was avatar</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t even her yeah like</p>
<p>airbrush boom</p>
<p>dude it wasn&rsquo;t even airbrushed it was avatar</p>
<p>but why would you pay</p>
<p>money for that as i&rsquo;m saying is why didn&rsquo;t we pay</p>
<p>money is that business is</p>
<p>still in business well we were</p>
<p>stoned and we were at</p>
<p>the hotel and</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m saying but why</p>
<p>would people buy it because people are</p>
<p>idiots only</p>
<p>through tooth</p>
<p>you see that tail would be</p>
<p>done with your tooth</p>
<p>and they buy it</p>
<p>i mean or the articles that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other argument is that they have good</p>
<p>articles but i don&rsquo;t know if they have good articles i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an urban myth is it</p>
<p>well at one</p>
<p>point in time they had good articles</p>
<p>i know that because there was a book that i bought</p>
<p>a long time ago was a</p>
<p>bunch of interviews with</p>
<p>a playboy interviews</p>
<p>and it was really fascinating and one of them was</p>
<p>sinatra and i</p>
<p>never realized</p>
<p>sinatra was so fucking smart</p>
<p>sinatra was like really</p>
<p>smart and i</p>
<p>found out this from this</p>
<p>book of playboy interviews it was pretty fascinating</p>
<p>huh but it was more of really</p>
<p>about what sinatra</p>
<p>had to say than it was</p>
<p>about the interview</p>
<p>guy interviewing i remember my</p>
<p>first dirty joke was from a playboy</p>
<p>magazine in the</p>
<p>seventies oh</p>
<p>you silly ghost</p>
<p>what was it uh why is it</p>
<p>why is a girl&rsquo;s asshole and</p>
<p>pussy so close together</p>

<p>oh jesus that was in playboy</p>
<p>nineteen seventy</p>
<p>eight or something why are you</p>
<p>grass and later pick</p>
<p>somebody up that&rsquo;s painful i just think</p>
<p>about fingernails</p>
<p>scraping inside body parts holding up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just rude why</p>
<p>would you want to pick them up like that</p>
<p>that shit is rude brian</p>

<p>her ass was nowhere to be seen her ass</p>
<p>well except for the one</p>
<p>sitting on the</p>
<p>table like trying to</p>
<p>squish her butt to make it</p>
<p>but i wasn&rsquo;t buying it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so funny that&rsquo;s a bravo</p>

<p>well that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>famous move when they don&rsquo;t have an ass you</p>

<p>you know what are you really showing me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not really a</p>
<p>picture of someone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really what they look like</p>

<p>like i can see her skin that&rsquo;s like hotter</p>
<p>you know a girl that even that isn&rsquo;t in that good of</p>
<p>shape but she had a little</p>

<p>i met a lot of dudes who</p>
<p>how do you have ever met a gay porn star</p>
<p>when webcams first started</p>
<p>becoming big i had sex with this girl on a webcam</p>
<p>and this is before like when it was brand new</p>

<p>i like that&rsquo;s what all</p>
<p>these rooms were just did website</p>
<p>ninety five something</p>

<p>cause it shit like this</p>
<p>the connection</p>
<p>that we have now is nothing like it was back then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to imagine that that</p>
<p>was only fourteen years ago it seems like it was like</p>
<p>that was seems like a long jump in in in</p>
<p>human evolution as far as like you know our</p>
<p>culture our technology</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty big goddamn jump yeah</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to have her</p>
<p>to shit like this you just do something like this</p>
<p>just put it on</p>
<p>this little social</p>
<p>media site and all</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>watch it and</p>
<p>people download it</p>
<p>later and watch it</p>
<p>later yeah it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking nice i</p>
<p>just can&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>still can&rsquo;t get over that you had a webcam</p>
<p>in 95&rsquo;s original geek man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s old school bro he&rsquo;s old</p>
<p>school how big was a webcam</p>
<p>it was pretty big it actually was a lie to</p>
<p>tech and i think it was like about this</p>
<p>about that pig was this huge logitech</p>
<p>eye yeah it was</p>
<p>yeah wow yeah</p>
<p>dude i had a</p>
<p>t one mind in my</p>
<p>house in ninety eight</p>
<p>damn yeah i had to get a</p>
<p>t1 line installed in my house but i needed faster</p>
<p>here here&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>funny they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about technology when aol</p>
<p>first came out with instant messaging where you</p>
<p>could type to your friends kind of like text messaging</p>
<p>they used to have a guy&rsquo;s voice i&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>instant message</p>
<p>every time you got a message</p>
<p>so so oh hi how&rsquo;s it going i nice to see you</p>
<p>send a number instant</p>
<p>every single i remember like the</p>
<p>first couple months it was okay</p>
<p>you know but then it got to the</p>
<p>point it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it was like no way to turn it off</p>
<p>i learned how to type fast</p>
<p>from typing in like irc when we&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>quake and playing you know quain</p>
<p>quake to learn how to type fast</p>
<p>because you know you you&rsquo;re typing like in</p>
<p>real time and having a conversations in real time right</p>
<p>you know eventually that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna be straight</p>
<p>speech to text</p>
<p>yeah or just</p>
<p>to straight speech</p>
<p>but the problem is</p>
<p>change speech</p>
<p>and everybody will be talking over but everybody else</p>
<p>i mean like</p>
<p>xbox live that&rsquo;s how it is you sit there with like</p>
<p>thirty people people like</p>
<p>mom will kill that bitch</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a party chat</p>
<p>with a bunch of retard</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s how it is</p>
<p>you know quake</p>
<p>quake is not like that quake</p>
<p>at least quake</p>
<p>maybe the new</p>
<p>ones will be like that but they don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>voice over i</p>
<p>think one of the reasons is because it</p>
<p>would it would eat</p>
<p>up more bandwidth and it probably make the game slower</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make the game slower</p>
<p>well back then that would</p>
<p>think so but nowadays you have</p>
<p>twenty megapites</p>
<p>rented up your ups</p>
<p>your ups two</p>
<p>megabytes to</p>
<p>have to that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still way more than</p>
<p>yeah but it</p>
<p>quake every goddamn</p>
<p>millisecond</p>
<p>a ping counts</p>
<p>voices like one</p>
<p>twenty eight</p>
<p>this is geek talk</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>is that a game with</p>
<p>these bitches</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>yeah like a lot of people and like well</p>
<p>some games are like</p>
<p>thirty people in a room</p>
<p>and you can talk to each</p>
<p>other yeah yeah well whoever&rsquo;s on your team</p>
<p>right with everybody talks</p>
<p>brian do you play xbox live</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t play xbox live i used to have a real problem</p>
<p>quick i used to play</p>
<p>quick like eight</p>
<p>hours a day</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve been um</p>
<p>i played quake two i</p>
<p>started on quake two but i actually like</p>
<p>quake one better</p>
<p>but then nobody was playing</p>
<p>quake one and then</p>
<p>we played quake</p>
<p>three with quake</p>
<p>three came out that was the that was probably</p>
<p>the most fun one to play</p>
<p>that was the hey day</p>
<p>the quake three</p>
<p>cause quake</p>
<p>three was like more complicated</p>
<p>graphically</p>
<p>look cooler it was a combination of one and two</p>
<p>those those fucking games are so goddamn addictive</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re playing live</p>
<p>you log on if you</p>
<p>never play quake before you log on</p>
<p>you you know you have all your</p>
<p>settings and your computer for like you know your mouse</p>
<p>speed and all this jazz get comfortable with it</p>
<p>then you log on and you jump into a fucking</p>
<p>three dimensional world</p>
<p>where you have earphones okay and in</p>
<p>these earphones you hear</p>
<p>sounds to the right</p>
<p>that means someone&rsquo;s to your</p>
<p>right dudes are</p>
<p>shooting at you rocket launchers and fucking</p>
<p>lightning guns</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a dark fucking</p>
<p>hallway you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running down and dudes are hiding and they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>blasting you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun as fuck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fun see i&rsquo;m so surprised that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not you&rsquo;re into that but you&rsquo;re not into something like</p>
<p>modern warfare 2</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s not that i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be into it i</p>
<p>would love to do it</p>
<p>the problem is i don&rsquo;t want to get addicted to anything</p>
<p>yeah i had a real problem getting</p>
<p>addicted to quake</p>
<p>wait sure it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>you like even though you get addicted to it</p>
<p>yeah you probably get addicted</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>amazing i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any time man i don&rsquo;t want to do that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my games was quaking</p>
<p>really is it</p>
<p>a game system or was it yes</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s for your pc</p>
<p>for your pc yeah you um</p>
<p>you know you know it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you have a real good graphics card on</p>
<p>a play it with all the</p>
<p>all the fancy shit on all the lights</p>
<p>but you can play it in a decent</p>
<p>where it would look decent</p>
<p>you know if your computer wasn&rsquo;t as good</p>
<p>but if you had a good computer and a good video card</p>
<p>oh my god it&rsquo;s staggering</p>
<p>in high resolution you have dudes</p>
<p>would explode</p>
<p>you rail gun them and</p>
<p>their body explodes</p>
<p>and a spray of</p>
<p>blood is fucking</p>
<p>spectacular</p>
<p>lightning bolts are flying through the air</p>
<p>and the the</p>
<p>shadows the fucking</p>
<p>lightning bolts create</p>
<p>shadows in the walls and shit yep</p>
<p>that mad modern</p>
<p>warfare 2 you&rsquo;re in something that really looks exactly</p>
<p>exactly like lax yeah you&rsquo;re sitting there just fucking</p>
<p>clowning people down and there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>crazy i mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking at a starbucks is this</p>
<p>fucking little mugs that you can</p>
<p>break into see i</p>
<p>would rather be a</p>
<p>space station or xbox it&rsquo;s a pc xbox</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s vibrating</p>
<p>everything the</p>
<p>thing the thing i like</p>
<p>about quake is it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even seem remotely real</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re rocket launching you</p>
<p>could rocket jump</p>
<p>you take your rocket launcher</p>
<p>right and you pull it at the ground</p>
<p>and jump at the same time you go flying through the air</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my favorite shit to do</p>
<p>that was my favorite</p>
<p>shit to do is to go rocket i rocket</p>
<p>jump the fuck i just it was so much fun did you do halo</p>
<p>no i played halo for a little bit but</p>
<p>again i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna get addicted</p>
<p>today i never got too much in a halo it&rsquo;s alright but</p>
<p>modern warfare two is just fucking</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t beat</p>
<p>this guy says call of duty is way too slow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i like</p>
<p>about quake it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so goddamn fast it&rsquo;s nothing like real physics too slow</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re walking down the hallway</p>
<p>you know how</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running out if you&rsquo;re running down a hallway</p>
<p>would be like this</p>
<p>what quake it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re flying</p>
<p>you sorry cat get up</p>
<p>you you can fucking run i mean you</p>
<p>could fly through</p>
<p>the air man dude you&rsquo;re flying and jumping left and</p>
<p>right and say to me that&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>twitch gaming it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>yeah the fuck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on fucking fun man it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>yeah i like i like it realistic i like it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into this</p>
<p>world like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into avatar</p>
<p>world and then you&rsquo;re just you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re playing through this lax</p>
<p>right and then</p>
<p>i come in with my rocket launcher and fuck you</p>
<p>right in the ass</p>
<p>your game is stupid</p>
<p>a dude from quake</p>
<p>there would be no competition if you fought a dude from</p>
<p>modern duty call of warfare whatever the fuck you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching whatever games you are</p>
<p>you can take a quick</p>
<p>space marine</p>
<p>and have a fight with these dudes</p>
<p>the space we</p>
<p>need to take a couple shots bro</p>
<p>they have like a hundred and fifty</p>
<p>you know life points</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just kill him with one bullet</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gonna rocket launch you in the fucking head</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna explode</p>
<p>that game is dumb</p>
<p>the quake games more fun</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more durable</p>
<p>they have more abilities their weapons are way crazier</p>
<p>the physics are like they&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>on this planet it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re running across the</p>
<p>moon you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about an old</p>
<p>school gaming</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so outdated right now</p>
<p>how dare you</p>
<p>how dare you say it&rsquo;s outdated</p>
<p>quake will never die how dare you</p>
<p>quake will never die</p>
<p>quake four is not outdated</p>
<p>graphically that&rsquo;s not outdated oh yeah compared to</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s games</p>
<p>is it really quake</p>
<p>four oh it&rsquo;s way outdated</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s game</p>
<p>john carmack</p>
<p>my brother please i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>forgive him</p>
<p>for he knows not what he says</p>
<p>no i mean graphic wise really</p>
<p>way i don&rsquo;t know you you could be</p>
<p>right i was watching the</p>
<p>aliens and predator demo that they showed the last ufc</p>
<p>was sponsored by aliens and predators</p>
<p>the video game</p>
<p>holy shit that looks good yeah but see even that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>not considered</p>
<p>not top of the show no</p>
<p>god damn the graphics are incredible yeah</p>
<p>i remember when</p>
<p>used to like when anybody used to be able to tell</p>
<p>what was the</p>
<p>most advanced shit you know like i&rsquo;m saying like</p>
<p>an amateur doesn&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on you&rsquo;d see something be like oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely the newest</p>
<p>clearly but now the</p>
<p>levels of it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too advanced where like</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m not an</p>
<p>expert but i&rsquo;m not like somebody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never seen video games</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t tell at all</p>
<p>the differences</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ll see something like that looks amazing yeah</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s oh fives</p>
<p>like really</p>
<p>yeah the ufc</p>
<p>game that we were</p>
<p>turning into a parent</p>
<p>they do this</p>
<p>you become i&rsquo;m not letting go of my child</p>
<p>child in me i got to make sure i&rsquo;m up with all the shit</p>
<p>when we um went to work for the ufc</p>
<p>uh on the video game</p>
<p>when they showed us the video game the</p>
<p>first time they showed us the video game was</p>
<p>chuckleddell versus rampage</p>
<p>and for one second</p>
<p>i looked at it i want i don&rsquo;t remember this footage</p>
<p>like i thought it was a fight</p>
<p>for once one second i thought it was a fight</p>
<p>oh my god never seen a fight from this angle</p>
<p>i was thinking that to myself</p>
<p>and then when oh shit this is the game</p>
<p>and then once they</p>
<p>start moving i mean you can pretty much tell it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>video game but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it was so much better than i expected it to be</p>
<p>right and that was couple years ago right</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re gonna be it they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have some shit that looks just like like a cgi</p>
<p>movie you know some of the</p>
<p>games almost really look real</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>what is like what</p>
<p>right now is the newest most amazing shit</p>
<p>mass effect two is pretty</p>
<p>badass but uh</p>
<p>is that like a</p>
<p>fighting that&rsquo;s like a role playing type</p>
<p>fighting game but</p>
<p>um the one for ps three that just came out uncharted to</p>
<p>drake&rsquo;s fortune that is like watching</p>
<p>being in a movie</p>
<p>pretty much really now</p>
<p>if you look at like avatar</p>
<p>what they did with avatar is they took the</p>
<p>actors and the actors made all the faces and then they</p>
<p>put it through a computer and then created</p>
<p>these blue people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>gonna start doing it with</p>
<p>video games they</p>
<p>already do that with</p>
<p>video they did it</p>
<p>most video games</p>
<p>no but not like the way they&rsquo;re doing it without</p>
<p>not to the probably the</p>
<p>level that maybe avatar</p>
<p>did but some</p>
<p>of the games they map out the facial features</p>
<p>and everything just</p>
<p>started from</p>
<p>started i think from</p>
<p>video game i just play the</p>
<p>tiger was golf</p>
<p>ten ten but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be greetable</p>
<p>yeah like when they</p>
<p>cut to like</p>
<p>the him like his face yeah and then they make they like</p>
<p>like if he has a bad like if you</p>
<p>have a bad shot then he goes like they have his voice</p>
<p>layered into it obviously</p>
<p>right so he actually makes a face goes like tiger</p>
<p>yeah you like oh god</p>
<p>like it looks like the dude</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>freaks you out</p>
<p>like you see the</p>
<p>sweat dripping off of them and</p>
<p>everything i feel</p>
<p>bad for that dude there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very few people that i feel bad for in public sandals</p>
<p>that are outside of like death</p>
<p>very few people</p>
<p>i feel bad for him because i</p>
<p>think the dude</p>
<p>got drowned on</p>
<p>he got poured on</p>
<p>more than any guy in the history of the free</p>
<p>world so many</p>
<p>white shooting</p>
<p>that want him out of golf</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s just destroying the</p>
<p>sport because he&rsquo;s pretty much just</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t beat</p>
<p>tiger you know</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many people that are attacking he knows that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got so much</p>
<p>money he&rsquo;s at home fucking washing his face with</p>
<p>money and pussy</p>
<p>so you know he&rsquo;s not at home</p>
<p>right now he&rsquo;s in a sex addiction</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s out of that</p>
<p>when did he get out of that</p>
<p>two days ago</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that that was like painful damn</p>
<p>to have this all all the</p>
<p>people hating on</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think so i i mean</p>
<p>sure i think it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>this whole life was</p>
<p>based on his image</p>
<p>his image was also they sold it to</p>
<p>giant corporations it was so</p>
<p>squeaky i think i</p>
<p>think the main</p>
<p>thing he&rsquo;s mad</p>
<p>about is his</p>
<p>wife finding out and all that</p>
<p>stuff like that but i</p>
<p>think if you got in</p>
<p>trouble or if you</p>
<p>got all this attention for something as being a pimp</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be like oh damn i</p>
<p>slept with a</p>
<p>bunch of people now everybody knows</p>
<p>that sucks for my wife i think i</p>
<p>think it was very painful i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wrong i think i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re very much</p>
<p>idealizing and not putting a</p>
<p>human being in that situation</p>
<p>you put a human being in that situation no</p>
<p>no i mean it sure it sucks but i mean dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s never had any negative he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come back</p>
<p>from this so fast it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll definitely jump out you</p>
<p>know golf wants him back more than anything all</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>thing for golf though</p>
<p>yeah well i</p>
<p>think i think he is to a</p>
<p>point but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>every he wins everything</p>
<p>but i say i</p>
<p>win everything he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s the best golfer ever but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s got</p>

<p>golf needs in the</p>
<p>crazy there he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>superstar i don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about golf tell me this does he lose i</p>
<p>mean what percentage of</p>
<p>everything does</p>
<p>he win but he</p>
<p>using kills</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he plays his best at the highest</p>
<p>stake turn but he he does</p>
<p>phenomenal i don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>exact numbers</p>
<p>but like he lose</p>
<p>though he lose</p>
<p>right but he&rsquo;s the most he wins more than any</p>
<p>he win way more than he ever loses yeah</p>
<p>but i mean he wins more than he loses way</p>
<p>more really way more</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>exact numbers</p>
<p>he loses tournaments all the time though he</p>

<p>legal like you can play pool in tournaments</p>
<p>everybody puts in you know a hundred</p>
<p>bucks five hundred</p>
<p>bucks whatever the</p>
<p>entry fee is</p>
<p>they pull all that</p>
<p>money together and they give it to the winner</p>
<p>i mean it really</p>
<p>is a form of it&rsquo;s just like gambling you know</p>
<p>i mean just</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>report that</p>
<p>money i have</p>
<p>friends that make a living doing that max everly</p>
<p>who makes a living playing in pool tournaments you know</p>
<p>max everly just won</p>
<p>three thousand dollars playing up in san francisco</p>
<p>is playing a big one in</p>
<p>la this weekend</p>
<p>this is gotta be boring as fuck for people</p>
<p>johnny boy 05 10 says</p>
<p>tiger banged those chicks for one reason he could</p>
<p>definitely i definitely think that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>i mean i think the</p>
<p>truth is most people</p>
<p>that look like that dude</p>
<p>that grew up the way that guy did</p>
<p>and that lived in that guy situation</p>
<p>would probably</p>
<p>just as nuts as he is</p>
<p>and probably</p>
<p>fuck just as many of the girls that he fucked</p>
<p>probably you</p>
<p>would go crazy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an amazing athlete</p>
<p>right an amazing game</p>
<p>player amazing at golf amazing</p>
<p>right a very intricate difficult complicated game</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s obsessed with</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>for sure if</p>
<p>that guy is that good that he&rsquo;s better than all</p>
<p>these other people that are obsessed with the game too</p>
<p>for sure that guy&rsquo;s nuts</p>
<p>you know you almost have to be</p>
<p>to be that good at something you have to have a level</p>
<p>of concentration you have to have a</p>
<p>level of obsession</p>
<p>that for sure is</p>
<p>gonna bleed over into</p>
<p>other areas</p>
<p>of your life into your relationships you know</p>
<p>of a guy who&rsquo;s a fanatic</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s obsessed with working out</p>
<p>might also be obsessed with fucking</p>
<p>you know or</p>
<p>might i also be obsessed with gambling</p>
<p>you know i mean a lot of pro athletes</p>
<p>have like big big gambling problems a lot of them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s that obsession with competition</p>
<p>you know the trying to win trying to get it you know</p>
<p>that that same mindset</p>
<p>transfers over to everything</p>
<p>transfers over to</p>
<p>how you approach arguments you know how how you how you</p>
<p>learn you know whether or not you</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re honest with yourself</p>
<p>guys he&rsquo;s gotta be nuts</p>
<p>anybody who&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>at whatever thing</p>
<p>i think is nuts too and to</p>
<p>i mean not a bad nuts</p>
<p>not like we&rsquo;re criticizing people for being amazing</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just saying that almost everybody who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know you get to like like</p>
<p>you know the highest</p>
<p>levels of any</p>
<p>sport there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about those dudes like</p>
<p>okay here&rsquo;s a perfect example</p>
<p>the everybody</p>
<p>thinks the best</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>
<p>is this guy this russian guy fatal or a million income</p>
<p>and what he&rsquo;s most</p>
<p>known for and</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>talk to a lot of people they&rsquo;ll say he&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>pound for pound</p>
<p>fighter in the</p>
<p>world i think it&rsquo;s probably anderson</p>
<p>silva but i</p>
<p>could see the argument for it being him</p>
<p>i think gsp</p>
<p>and bj penn</p>
<p>or more likely because i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re facing</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tough argument you know he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the best competition</p>
<p>over there because he&rsquo;s kind of in a situation</p>
<p>where the best guys are</p>
<p>fighting in the ufc</p>
<p>so the guys that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fighting they&rsquo;re not really totally on his</p>
<p>level or they used to be and now they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>slid off a little bit but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>known for this insane mindset</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s known for his</p>
<p>uh his ability to just like overcome anything and be</p>
<p>super calm like</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s doing it</p>
<p>you know that like he&rsquo;s in the in this like zone</p>
<p>it is no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any facial expressions you know nothing</p>
<p>yeah you think</p>
<p>do you think</p>
<p>he is the best though or no</p>
<p>uh he&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>for sure but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about that the ability to go to war</p>
<p>with somebody with like a dead face like dead calm like</p>
<p>for sure there&rsquo;s a discipline</p>
<p>to it and for sure it&rsquo;s something that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>learned over time</p>
<p>but also he might be</p>
<p>crazy as fuck</p>
<p>how about that how</p>
<p>about he he</p>
<p>might be fucking crazy</p>
<p>you know i mean he</p>
<p>might be so</p>
<p>smart and so into</p>
<p>you know winning and and and beating dudes at</p>
<p>fighting and so</p>
<p>capable of crossing</p>
<p>boundaries that</p>
<p>others aren&rsquo;t willing to</p>
<p>cross that he</p>
<p>might just be insane</p>
<p>that must might be why he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even get angry</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>it he beats the fuck out of everybody and then he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super sweet</p>
<p>it draws like cartoons for his</p>
<p>daughters and shit</p>
<p>yeah you know i think that</p>
<p>probably the</p>
<p>most the most vicious guys in business to have the same</p>
<p>mentality like the guys that</p>
<p>take over companies and like you know</p>
<p>like they have like</p>
<p>whoever probably</p>
<p>runs google is probably like somebody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obsessive and</p>
<p>and has like a killed</p>
<p>mentality well</p>
<p>definitely ceos for corporations oh yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like hitmen</p>
<p>you see that new show what a</p>
<p>great idea for</p>
<p>a show by the way we take ceos of big companies</p>
<p>and then they go</p>
<p>undercover and</p>
<p>work for the company like that guy from hooters</p>
<p>is going to be</p>
<p>like go to all</p>
<p>these restaurants and act like he&rsquo;s a fry cook</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gonna work</p>
<p>just gonna check out</p>
<p>everything and whoa and</p>
<p>dude it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>undercover show yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where they take the ceo of real companies and they</p>
<p>put them in</p>
<p>the company</p>
<p>undercover boss</p>
<p>yeah and a good boss</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious what a</p>
<p>great idea it was</p>
<p>great that first episode was like</p>
<p>waste management the biggest</p>
<p>waste management company ever is called wm or</p>
<p>waste management</p>
<p>waste management</p>
<p>and he went down he was like</p>
<p>shoveling shit out of fucking</p>
<p>trolley or shit</p>
<p>and did they know that he was that</p>
<p>guy no no i did</p>
<p>and then he came back and all the guys</p>
<p>were great work</p>
<p>stuff the game</p>
<p>raises gave him</p>
<p>promotions and</p>
<p>fixed everything they were</p>
<p>bitching about</p>
<p>they actually trying to figure out what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it called</p>
<p>undercover boss it&rsquo;s on cbs on</p>
<p>sunday yeah what a</p>
<p>great idea was really good actually</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what really what what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with people man</p>
<p>what really</p>
<p>wrong with like</p>
<p>harshness and and and people being insensitive to</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>people that</p>
<p>work for them is that they don&rsquo;t have to live a day in</p>
<p>their lives</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t have to if you did</p>
<p>you would you</p>
<p>would be you</p>
<p>know much kinder you know it&rsquo;s so easy to look at like</p>
<p>people that are like</p>
<p>starving in foreign countries</p>
<p>and all the fucking</p>
<p>crazy shit that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>liberia and all</p>
<p>these different parts of the</p>
<p>world that are in</p>
<p>constant chaos and turmoil and</p>
<p>starvation and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t feel it because it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t affect you</p>
<p>cause on a day to day basis</p>

<p>bunch of managers</p>

<p>i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>back then do you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch shit like that and just go on</p>
<p>stage i would</p>
<p>prepare myself</p>
<p>like like now if i was</p>
<p>watching something on</p>
<p>stage and it was</p>
<p>starting to buy me a dollar</p>
<p>i would have to get out of the room</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>put my mind in this frame</p>
<p>you know where</p>
<p>these people are</p>
<p>their dog burped to</p>
<p>death and they</p>
<p>lost all their possessions</p>
<p>their whole life&rsquo;s dream is</p>
<p>grown man in his 50s with a mustache as weeping</p>
<p>and then i went right on</p>
<p>stage and just ate dick</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t even a little funny</p>
<p>there was nothing that i</p>
<p>could have possibly said that was funny</p>
<p>i just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think anything was funny</p>
<p>i i had a two hour</p>
<p>uh drive with a chick</p>
<p>bitching at me</p>
<p>then i watch</p>
<p>twenty minutes of people crying</p>
<p>cause their</p>
<p>house is gone</p>
<p>and then i go on</p>
<p>stage it was just</p>
<p>death but jb</p>
<p>smooth went on right</p>
<p>after me and destroyed</p>
<p>destroyed there was like such a</p>
<p>stench in the room for my performance</p>
<p>it was so flat and so</p>
<p>inspired and i was so i so didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>and the people that paid to see me</p>
<p>they were so bummed out because they had like told</p>
<p>their friends how</p>
<p>funny i was</p>
<p>because they saw me at naka</p>
<p>there was a naka convention this is like this</p>
<p>association of college</p>
<p>campus activities</p>
<p>thing where you</p>
<p>you know you perform</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would send you out to all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>colleges all across the country was really good money</p>
<p>and well i had done the</p>
<p>the conference and i killed i fucking destroyed</p>
<p>and so i got all</p>
<p>these colleges for it and this was one of</p>
<p>those colleges</p>
<p>and these people like well you really killed it naka</p>
<p>yeah i killed it i fucked</p>
<p>sorry i fucked up</p>
<p>was disastrous</p>
<p>but jb smooth went on</p>
<p>after me just</p>
<p>about here to comedy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not think he&rsquo;s in new york</p>
<p>dude is so funny</p>
<p>got some of the best facial expressions ever</p>
<p>rogan that ice</p>
<p>shit was hilarious by the way oh</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>taken on its own little</p>
<p>thing ridiculous and</p>
<p>it how funny is</p>
<p>that about this was that dad</p>
<p>there was a fight</p>
<p>aired on spike tv</p>
<p>where this dude had</p>
<p>a bag of ice on the dude&rsquo;s head in between the corner</p>
<p>and the bag broke</p>
<p>and ice went everywhere</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like oh</p>
<p>g we got a problem like look at this is ice everywhere</p>
<p>and these guys</p>
<p>start picking up the ice but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stumbling and</p>
<p>dropping the bucket and i start i</p>
<p>start doing like play by play i&rsquo;m like it&rsquo;s a goddamn</p>
<p>three stooges look</p>
<p>at these guys</p>
<p>and apparently</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>killing time while they</p>
<p>clean up ice</p>
<p>basically i&rsquo;m like let me just</p>
<p>entertain whether</p>
<p>clean up ice let me just make fun of this</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s like this youtube clip it&rsquo;s all over the</p>
<p>place really it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>what sucks of being in the audience you can&rsquo;t hear you</p>
<p>right so i had no idea any of this was going on</p>
<p>right so that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>sucks you know what next time i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get you guys</p>
<p>those things yeah</p>
<p>yeah tell me so much you guys</p>
<p>those things yeah i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>those things work</p>

<p>figure out a way to improve it oh yeah this is good</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>wi fi america yeah</p>
<p>yeah well there is a wi fi that&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>in the he&rsquo;s like headphones</p>
<p>in the arena</p>
<p>yes there is it&rsquo;s an ear</p>
<p>thing like a little like a</p>
<p>sort of like an ipod</p>
<p>and you sit there and you can listen to the commentary</p>
<p>while it was all</p>
<p>going on that</p>
<p>would be better than yeah</p>
<p>they kind of</p>
<p>streaming it</p>

<p>delay here yeah up more</p>
<p>anyway i&rsquo;m got it please</p>
<p>uh ice is commentary</p>
<p>at ufc one night with me yeah how</p>
<p>funny is that that became such a big deal</p>
<p>pants on the floor</p>
<p>i saw that&rsquo;s one thing that</p>
<p>um that does come in handy being a comedian and being</p>
<p>a commentator at the same time when something fucks up</p>
<p>i can at least make fun of it</p>
<p>you do that a lot you should do it more it&rsquo;s this some</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s not appropriate you know i only do it</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s appropriate my job is to</p>
<p>to represent what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on my job is to represent what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in the fighting it&rsquo;s not my job to like</p>
<p>stick my personality into that</p>
<p>you know when it&rsquo;s appropriate</p>
<p>then i do it</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look for like you ever</p>
<p>watch when dennis miller did the monday</p>
<p>night football yes</p>
<p>and he would like throw jokes in a lot</p>
<p>right jokes</p>
<p>that will be</p>
<p>funny as if your conversations with mike were</p>
<p>kind of like you scripted</p>
<p>yeah i know</p>
<p>that you do it already sometimes like when mike</p>
<p>will say something you call him out on it but you know</p>
<p>but if you just</p>
<p>kind of did that more because sometimes he says some</p>
<p>yeah i sometimes i have to let it go though i have to</p>
<p>because like we&rsquo;re in the middle of moving something</p>
<p>along someone&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>into the octagon you know the fight is</p>
<p>about to take place</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna</p>
<p>i like that side talk that you guys yeah</p>
<p>i do too but we</p>
<p>gotta do it</p>
<p>you know what it&rsquo;s best when the</p>
<p>fights are boring</p>
<p>when you have a boring</p>
<p>fight then you can</p>
<p>start talking shit</p>
<p>right you know and you can be like</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t the most</p>
<p>exciting fight i&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life like i&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>things like that you know</p>
<p>on occasion if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a boring one</p>
<p>do you find</p>
<p>yourself also trying to find up like new sayings to say</p>
<p>cause you always</p>
<p>have to say seems like yeah</p>
<p>he has a heart of gold or something like that</p>
<p>also just country music song</p>
<p>he has the heart of gold</p>
<p>he is the spirit of a</p>
<p>tiger i mean do you have a heart of</p>
<p>love there you have a bunch of animals no</p>
<p>i say the heart of a lion because it&rsquo;s a genuine</p>
<p>expression right</p>
<p>you start making expressions up</p>
<p>as a warrior spirit of the nation</p>
<p>you should do that no</p>
<p>man nobody wants to hear that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not me though</p>
<p>but there is a dude that&rsquo;s michael</p>
<p>chevello the guy that does</p>
<p>dream he does all the commentary for</p>
<p>dream and he does k1</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really hilarious because he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll like</p>
<p>make stuff up but it&rsquo;s really funny coming for him</p>
<p>like when this guy was throwing hooks goes</p>
<p>more hooks than a pirate&rsquo;s convention</p>
<p>like he said</p>
<p>like that that&rsquo;s great but it&rsquo;s funny the thing</p>
<p>about dennis miller was that his were obscure yeah</p>
<p>i was like the</p>
<p>style that whole</p>
<p>style of comedy that</p>
<p>whole style like i know much more than you do and</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna pretend</p>
<p>that you know as much as i do you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the inside so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna laugh at the joke</p>
<p>right exactly</p>
<p>then if it&rsquo;s not even a joke just a</p>
<p>reference do you hear</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s example of</p>
<p>a specific one though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the constitution page two</p>
<p>that was his idea being obscure</p>
<p>yeah page two</p>
<p>constitution</p>
<p>not a line from it page two</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny if you think</p>
<p>about how how</p>
<p>few people really</p>
<p>understand or have written</p>
<p>read the constitution i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never read it have you ever read</p>
<p>ha i think i</p>
<p>might have i</p>
<p>never read the constitution yeah i</p>
<p>think you had your back you could</p>
<p>yeah maybe like do</p>
<p>you remember any of it i mean do you remember anything</p>
<p>about i remember</p>
<p>freedom of speech</p>
<p>i remember you&rsquo;re supposed to be allowed to have</p>
<p>guns and you&rsquo;re allowed to take up arms</p>
<p>against the government is not</p>
<p>legal something like that not like</p>
<p>second amendment</p>
<p>bill rights</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really kind of</p>
<p>crazy if you stop to think</p>
<p>about like how the</p>
<p>structure of our country though the whole</p>
<p>structure of our country is</p>
<p>made up in a</p>
<p>way that very few people have even looked into</p>
<p>yeah you talk</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s unconstitutional but</p>
<p>you know how many people have ever even read that shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be like a minuscule</p>
<p>percentage and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy that we</p>
<p>stick with these laws</p>
<p>that were invented</p>
<p>like so many</p>
<p>hundred years ago</p>
<p>like why haven&rsquo;t we come up with a better way</p>
<p>why haven&rsquo;t we refined it</p>
<p>and made it</p>
<p>better just for the people like we hear like</p>
<p>new rulings like this</p>
<p>recent ruling that the supreme</p>
<p>court had where</p>
<p>they said that corporations can</p>
<p>spend as much</p>
<p>money as they want</p>
<p>on campaigns now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like an</p>
<p>individual they could</p>
<p>spend as much as they want that&rsquo;s an insane</p>
<p>idea why would you</p>
<p>think that that</p>
<p>would be good for the</p>
<p>individual why</p>
<p>would you think that</p>
<p>would be good for</p>
<p>human beings in general</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>gonna be good for the corporation of course you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna spend millions of dollars</p>
<p>cause the politician</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna get into office is</p>
<p>gonna do shit that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>wanna do but you</p>
<p>asked him to do</p>
<p>which is why you got him in there in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>you know hey i mean</p>
<p>nobody gets into office that isn&rsquo;t playing the game</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s pretty obvious now you have to with obama</p>
<p>and obama&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smart fucking guy man</p>
<p>you know i saw him that</p>
<p>thing that he was doing</p>
<p>where the republicans</p>
<p>were questioning on shit and saying a</p>
<p>bunch of nonsense and he was just</p>
<p>correcting them left and</p>
<p>right and made them all look</p>
<p>stupid and did it without a teleprompter</p>
<p>and was calm as fuck</p>
<p>under pressure</p>
<p>and you watch that</p>
<p>kind of go god if this guy can&rsquo;t even change anything</p>
<p>change anything</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s like bums public</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s public</p>
<p>maybe maybe or</p>
<p>it might be that he can&rsquo;t fucking change anything</p>
<p>it might be that you the president is</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s just he is a</p>
<p>puppy yeah that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole point</p>
<p>the president</p>
<p>it might be that the president really is i mean</p>
<p>i think like jfk</p>
<p>tried to treat</p>
<p>the presidency as if he was like really the president</p>
<p>you know but i think bush</p>
<p>very obviously</p>
<p>accepted the position of the</p>
<p>spokesperson</p>
<p>very obviously</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t paying attention</p>
<p>right very obviously</p>
<p>you know would make like critical mistakes</p>
<p>about shit the way he promoted</p>
<p>things and the way he</p>
<p>spoke about</p>
<p>things when he was you know</p>
<p>when he was off</p>
<p>script and he was a fucking dance</p>
<p>and then you had</p>
<p>cheney who was always hiding in the bunker</p>
<p>and his fucking</p>
<p>evil billionaire ceo character who was actively</p>
<p>making money</p>
<p>off the war</p>
<p>actively profiting</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s some incredible shit</p>
<p>and then when the company that he used to be the ceo of</p>
<p>then becomes the fucking company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s contracted to go to iraq and fix everything</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>and everybody goes</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s because you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s the only company that&rsquo;s qualified like oh</p>
<p>so what so what</p>
<p>so what fire up a new company that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy the guy can&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>money as the</p>
<p>vice president from fucking war</p>
<p>and then obama comes in the office and you</p>
<p>gotta go like well</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like he ain&rsquo;t fixing shit</p>
<p>you know what is what is he</p>
<p>changing sending</p>
<p>thirty thousand more people to afghanistan</p>
<p>you know i mean this</p>
<p>whole economic stimulus</p>
<p>when i hear them talk</p>
<p>about that i feel i feel angry</p>
<p>i feel like i&rsquo;m getting fucked</p>
<p>right now and i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m getting fucked</p>
<p>like the way they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about this and the</p>
<p>money that gets</p>
<p>unaffected the goldman sachs ceo</p>
<p>just got you</p>
<p>know some insanely</p>
<p>large bonus</p>
<p>it was reported online it</p>
<p>was 100 million dollars or something like that it was</p>
<p>some insane</p>
<p>bonus because they made so much money in</p>
<p>2009 they like</p>
<p>the record year</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible it&rsquo;s all incredible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all incredible</p>
<p>the whole idea that</p>
<p>you know that they</p>
<p>buy out all</p>
<p>these fucking banks</p>
<p>cause the banks are too big to fail and</p>
<p>where is all the money</p>
<p>going it&rsquo;s all numbers</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all ones and zeros what the fuck is happening and</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s it going</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all nuts like the whole</p>
<p>system is so chaotic</p>
<p>a system of finance that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>based mostly on confidence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big part of it</p>
<p>you know cause for the longest time we didn&rsquo;t have shit</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t producing shit</p>
<p>but everybody was like confident that real estate</p>
<p>prices are gonna keep</p>
<p>going up so they keep buying them</p>
<p>and selling them to keep making</p>
<p>money so everybody&rsquo;s confident</p>
<p>and meanwhile in the middle of all of it nothing is</p>
<p>going on there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>ones and zeros moving back</p>
<p>and forth we don&rsquo;t even know what the fuck is happening</p>
<p>and it runs our</p>
<p>whole life you know</p>
<p>when the financial</p>
<p>system that the runs the</p>
<p>world it&rsquo;s like so fucking complex that</p>
<p>a guy like bernie maidoff can fuck them all and steal</p>
<p>billions and billions of dollars and nobody knew</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absurd that&rsquo;s insane billions and he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>steal like fifty</p>
<p>grand he stole</p>
<p>fifty billion</p>
<p>and he had that much</p>
<p>yeah over decades</p>
<p>he had that much money</p>
<p>going on and no one knew what</p>
<p>the fuck was happening and he used to be the president</p>
<p>i think of the</p>
<p>stock exchange yeah yeah</p>
<p>the guy who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>in charge of it all was either</p>
<p>chairman or something like yeah it was some big</p>
<p>weird position at the yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible man it&rsquo;s really amazing</p>
<p>yeah it really is man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i mean i used to</p>
<p>think before the market</p>
<p>crashed i thought well i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>spend too much time</p>
<p>thinking about you know</p>
<p>finances and politics because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so complex</p>
<p>to really study it appropriately</p>
<p>you would have to</p>
<p>spend many many</p>
<p>hours every day</p>
<p>delving into all the different issues that are going on</p>
<p>all the different areas that merit attention</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like god damn it it&rsquo;s more than a full time job</p>
<p>and if you have a family</p>
<p>if you have kids if you have a job if you have a hobby</p>
<p>if you have any friends</p>
<p>where are you coming up with that time</p>
<p>where are you coming up with that time you</p>
<p>gonna get obsessed with politics</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t have it do you have it no</p>
<p>who the fuck does</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible so the system</p>
<p>the system that that is running our our</p>
<p>whole lives</p>
<p>is one that we barely</p>
<p>understand and</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t even researched</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>do nothing but consume information all day long</p>
<p>to have even</p>
<p>remote chance to like really follow the ins</p>
<p>and outs so that&rsquo;s in the same bucket as math with me</p>
<p>if my brain just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work like that</p>
<p>and mac oh do you</p>
<p>think by the way that like</p>
<p>like i vote i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>voted for obama</p>
<p>and so i&rsquo;ve been like you know i wanted to</p>
<p>succeed and do well and</p>
<p>everything but</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how out of it i am with the politics</p>
<p>that i don&rsquo;t know if this is factual or not but</p>
<p>was his campaign part of it that like he</p>
<p>would withdraw troops</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t sending them</p>
<p>yeah like just</p>
<p>at least at the very</p>
<p>least it&rsquo;s the opposite what you said you were going</p>
<p>no i think he did withdraw</p>
<p>troops but i</p>
<p>think he just</p>
<p>when everyone says he sent that many</p>
<p>troops afghanistan</p>
<p>he just withdrew</p>
<p>him and moved him over</p>
<p>well everybody knew it was bullshit everybody knew</p>
<p>it was bullshit</p>
<p>thirty thousand more now</p>
<p>right now right</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what i i shouldn&rsquo;t say everybody knew it was bullshit</p>
<p>but a lot of people knew that what he really was</p>
<p>gonna do is pull</p>
<p>troops out of iraq</p>
<p>and put more in afghanistan</p>
<p>cause they were saying that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under under</p>
<p>trooped in afghanistan for what they&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>right but you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>crazy that dude wins the nobel</p>
<p>peace prize</p>
<p>and then sends</p>
<p>thirty thousand more people to afghanistan</p>
<p>right afterwards</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>bizarre i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all even like not liking</p>
<p>him i just it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense to me that you would</p>
<p>award somebody a peace</p>
<p>prize just on</p>
<p>their on their</p>
<p>image well you know we</p>
<p>gotta pay attention</p>
<p>like everybody&rsquo;s like well you</p>
<p>gotta look out for</p>
<p>where you know</p>
<p>things are happening you have protect american</p>
<p>you know interest and</p>
<p>protect america from terrorism all that good</p>
<p>stuff but listen</p>
<p>the scariest</p>
<p>goddamn threat to america is the mexican drug cartels</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re right next door to us you can</p>
<p>drive to fucking mexico man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>and if you live in san</p>
<p>diego it&rsquo;s a goddamn</p>
<p>twenty minute drive</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in another country</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re murdering people</p>
<p>every fucking day of the week</p>
<p>way crazier</p>
<p>victor davila the guy who does the spanish</p>
<p>version of my job he does the commentary for ufc</p>
<p>he told me that it&rsquo;s five times more people have died</p>
<p>last year in 2009</p>
<p>in juarez and all the border towns all the murders and</p>
<p>all the gunfire that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on between the cops and the bad guys</p>
<p>five times more</p>
<p>have died than in iraq and afghanistan combined ever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s insane that&rsquo;s insane and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>he said it&rsquo;s nuts over there he said</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>drive around at</p>
<p>night with your dome</p>
<p>light on so that the drug cartels</p>
<p>they see they don&rsquo;t wonder who</p>
<p>you are in the car they don&rsquo;t just gun your car down</p>
<p>just to be sure</p>
<p>really yeah he said it&rsquo;s nuts man</p>
<p>people drive around with their dome</p>
<p>lights on so</p>
<p>the drug guys can see inside</p>
<p>whoa that&rsquo;s fucking terrifying</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re driving around</p>
<p>and they let you live well let him live let him live he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have our guys in there oh</p>
<p>how scary is that shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right next door man</p>
<p>you know and the</p>
<p>reason why it all happened is because drugs are illegal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reason</p>
<p>why it all happened is you can you you got all</p>
<p>these fucking people that are willing to sell drugs</p>
<p>cause all these people want drugs</p>
<p>and the people that are</p>
<p>selling the drugs make billions and billions of dollars</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t realize it a lot of people</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>cocaine the</p>
<p>biggest import from mexico in the</p>
<p>illicit drug</p>
<p>world is marijuana so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fact that that&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>that fuels a lot i&rsquo;m saying if you made</p>
<p>it legal in mexico and</p>
<p>universally</p>
<p>you would you</p>
<p>would get rid of a lot of the violence and</p>
<p>things that go on because</p>
<p>the biggest</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s being brought in is not coke</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s marijuana so the fact that</p>
<p>these guys have</p>
<p>are doing this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s illegal if they just made it legal you</p>
<p>would reduce violence by so much but you know what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna they&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>cut down any laws they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>absolutely have to cut down</p>
<p>and if they</p>
<p>ease up restrictions on marijuana it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take decades</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>statewide in</p>
<p>california first</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be some contest to that and</p>
<p>maybe a couple</p>
<p>other states will</p>
<p>adopt it it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never be national it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never be federal because</p>
<p>they always need</p>
<p>those fucking people to work</p>
<p>they need those dea guys</p>
<p>those guys are</p>
<p>gonna make sure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in a position of</p>
<p>power they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make sure</p>
<p>that they you know they keep a certain amount of jobs</p>
<p>every year and if you</p>
<p>close down marijuana you make marijuana legal</p>
<p>you make all drugs you dim</p>
<p>you criminalize all drugs</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>chopped down like more than half yeah</p>
<p>more than half the people in prison</p>
<p>today are in prison for non violent drug offenses sure</p>
<p>which is crazy when</p>
<p>you can go to cvs and get fucked up out of your mind</p>
<p>you go to cvs</p>
<p>you know and they have shelves</p>
<p>where they have fucking whiskey</p>
<p>just shelves</p>
<p>after just so much</p>
<p>whiskey you can</p>
<p>drink yourself to</p>
<p>death right</p>
<p>i go to cvs not to buy the cheapest</p>
<p>they have the</p>
<p>cheapest beer now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy yeah</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s amazing that alcohol kills people</p>
<p>and yet we we don&rsquo;t even bat an eye</p>
<p>at it being</p>
<p>right there on the corner in a in a convenience store</p>
<p>like hard hard shit</p>
<p>jack daniel&rsquo;s wild</p>
<p>turkey and shit you know</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>liquor stores</p>
<p>supermarkets</p>
<p>right there beer wine</p>
<p>drink yourself to death</p>
<p>but if they had weed people</p>
<p>would freak out</p>
<p>his fucking weed</p>
<p>here there is a difference when you think</p>
<p>about it there&rsquo;s not one alcohol</p>
<p>where you could take one shot</p>
<p>and then to be out of your mind</p>
<p>panic attacks</p>
<p>might check yourself in the hospital for</p>
<p>you know cause you</p>
<p>think your heart</p>
<p>freaking out you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not one alcohol that will do that but yet there is weed</p>
<p>that you take one hit and you will</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re having a</p>
<p>especially if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t smoke weed</p>
<p>yeah yeah there is a</p>
<p>glass of something you can drink</p>
<p>and like if you had a glass a</p>
<p>glass of it yeah i mean the</p>
<p>glass of it</p>
<p>eating a whole bag of weed</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the reason it the reason why</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good that</p>
<p>things are illegal is because</p>
<p>when things are</p>
<p>legal they have like really</p>
<p>clearly defined portions</p>
<p>right you know a beer you get a beards</p>
<p>twelve ounces whatever the hell it is you</p>
<p>crack it open there it is that&rsquo;s a beer</p>
<p>if you have more</p>
<p>than one now you know it&rsquo;s like when you have two beers</p>
<p>right you have two beers now be careful</p>
<p>you know like with weed</p>
<p>especially when you buy like</p>
<p>edibles you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>you could get like some i&rsquo;ve had a pot of lollipops</p>
<p>where i couldn&rsquo;t even feel them</p>
<p>like i eat the</p>
<p>whole lollipop and two hours</p>
<p>later mike i</p>
<p>think i got a dud</p>
<p>like it was a dud</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll have a cookie</p>
<p>where you eat</p>
<p>half the cookie</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>like cartoons fucking behind your eyelids like you</p>
<p>close your eyes</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see like</p>
<p>these animated cartoons like</p>
<p>wrestling and duplicating and moving</p>
<p>back and forth all around you and that&rsquo;s how beyond</p>
<p>colors that&rsquo;s how i felt at the last usc woo</p>
<p>it was a little bit too</p>
<p>strong i thought i was</p>
<p>gonna die we talked</p>
<p>about this before but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth talking</p>
<p>about cause it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy and most people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about it when you eat marijuana</p>
<p>and this is very important for people who</p>
<p>think you know</p>
<p>i got two stone</p>
<p>you can get two</p>
<p>stone smoking</p>
<p>pot it&rsquo;s totally different than getting two</p>
<p>stoned eating pot</p>
<p>getting two</p>
<p>stone eating pot is terrifying</p>
<p>because your body produces a chemical called</p>
<p>eleven hydroxy metabolite and when</p>
<p>apparently what happens is when you</p>
<p>smoke marijuana</p>
<p>this is what i read online</p>
<p>when you smoke marijuana</p>
<p>it has this</p>
<p>eleven hydroxy metabolite but it&rsquo;s not psychoactive</p>
<p>but when you eat it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s processed through your</p>
<p>liver and it goes in your</p>
<p>bloodstream it&rsquo;s four times more potent than thc</p>
<p>four times more psychoactive</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why you get so high eat a</p>
<p>brownie and you&rsquo;re just like blitzkrieged like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally like higher than you can get smoking it</p>
<p>you know like it&rsquo;s a different high too it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like real</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like mushrooms or something it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>self examining</p>
<p>you know real</p>
<p>self examinatory like you really</p>
<p>start like is that a word</p>
<p>self examinatory</p>
<p>sounds like a word</p>
<p>if it sounds like it&rsquo;s a word</p>
<p>maybe right it should be</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freaked out</p>
<p>i freaked out with a cookie one time who</p>
<p>i was crying and</p>
<p>stuff like for</p>
<p>a long time</p>
<p>it was hours and</p>
<p>hours and hours yeah</p>
<p>yeah eddie had a cookie once that really</p>
<p>freaked him out and he</p>
<p>was doing this character this</p>
<p>it was a white rapper that puts</p>
<p>black face on</p>
<p>to be more street</p>
<p>and he was doing this character</p>
<p>and it was like the</p>
<p>ultimate wigger</p>
<p>he was like trying to</p>
<p>claim that he</p>
<p>really didn&rsquo;t have makeup on but he did it was pretty</p>
<p>funny actually</p>
<p>and he ate the cookie</p>
<p>and got so paranoid because of this video</p>
<p>he started to</p>
<p>freak out and thought the</p>
<p>black people were</p>
<p>gonna come and get him and they were</p>
<p>gonna hate him he was racist</p>
<p>he was like like</p>
<p>ready to cry ha ha</p>
<p>and when he was talking</p>
<p>about he was like you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s so funny how when</p>
<p>you get high like i got high once and i thought about</p>
<p>some shit i said</p>
<p>about steven seagal</p>
<p>i always like making fun of steven seagal</p>
<p>i was being like really mean</p>
<p>and i got high ones</p>
<p>i thought about i&rsquo;m like why am i being such a dick</p>
<p>stevens ago</p>
<p>never did anything to me</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m being so personal</p>
<p>about it about my</p>
<p>my making fun</p>
<p>of him like i&rsquo;m not even doing it good naturedly</p>
<p>you know it made me realize i was like</p>
<p>what if i&rsquo;d met him what if he was nice</p>
<p>what kind of a</p>
<p>piece of shit</p>
<p>would i feel like</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s not nice but</p>
<p>maybe he is</p>
<p>maybe i meet him</p>
<p>maybe i like him</p>
<p>you know i mean i&rsquo;ve met some people that</p>
<p>people thought were douchebags before and i like them</p>
<p>so it made me really examine</p>
<p>like my my instincts</p>
<p>just because this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>famous just to shit all over him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i wanted to do i was just i just met roddy</p>
<p>piper he was the nicest</p>
<p>old man i&rsquo;ve ever said</p>
<p>roddy piper&rsquo;s a legend man</p>
<p>you yeah but when you see him though you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like who is this guy he was just like off the streets</p>
<p>but really yeah</p>
<p>nicest guy ever</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m still acting why isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he acting i guess tv</p>
<p>shows and shit have you</p>
<p>watched the golf show</p>
<p>fucking awesome</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s golf shows goddamn i don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like it no</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you like when he talks</p>
<p>black to black</p>
<p>people i do</p>
<p>i do it&rsquo;s worth that little</p>
<p>piece what up cuz what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on cause</p>
<p>over what you trying to do here we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going down we&rsquo;re going down</p>
<p>like he will straight up patronize</p>
<p>he goes right to</p>
<p>cause what up</p>
<p>cause right away</p>
<p>these guys are handcuffed</p>
<p>this is gone even real</p>
<p>does he keep real bullets in his guns yeah i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>say any zany</p>
<p>let him have bullets in his gun was</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m so weird</p>
<p>about that show</p>
<p>i just to me it&rsquo;s just like i&rsquo;m getting i</p>
<p>mean i kind of</p>
<p>understand okay</p>
<p>he has real martial arts</p>
<p>training gotcha</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got real firearms</p>
<p>training gotcha he</p>
<p>would bring exposure</p>
<p>to your police</p>
<p>force okay i see</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>i can kind of</p>
<p>understand how they</p>
<p>would be willing to have him as a cop</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s strange</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>think the people</p>
<p>would be smarter</p>
<p>you think the people</p>
<p>would be like do you</p>
<p>think in israel they</p>
<p>would let some of us just</p>
<p>alone be a cop in israel</p>
<p>you think they</p>
<p>would let him i</p>
<p>could be a twelve year old and be a</p>
<p>what but you know i&rsquo;m saying you think they</p>
<p>would take an actor and and i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>let him do that no</p>
<p>yeah they might think that listen they&rsquo;d be like a</p>
<p>movie yeah they might be able to say no joke</p>
<p>how about a</p>
<p>seagull is is</p>
<p>an expert in every episode</p>
<p>on some shit that you</p>
<p>never really he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know trained dogs for like 20 yeah</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>then he&rsquo;s playing the blues you like really</p>
<p>you play the blues like well you know it was</p>
<p>funny it was my magazine</p>
<p>there was a spy magazine article about him</p>
<p>about his background about how</p>
<p>a guy was claiming that his background was fabricated</p>
<p>and that there was a dude who really worked for the cia</p>
<p>in southeast asia</p>
<p>and seagal met him and</p>
<p>seagal started telling this guy stories as his own</p>
<p>he just started doing nothing this guy&rsquo;s life yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be a great movie yeah oh yeah well</p>
<p>dude is completely full of shit the main</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not totally</p>
<p>full of shit because he really is like this high</p>
<p>level aikido black belt</p>
<p>i mean ikea</p>
<p>is kind of a</p>
<p>silly martial art</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s really like a high</p>
<p>level ikea black</p>
<p>i do think he&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely true and accurate</p>
<p>and i do believe</p>
<p>that he is a little out of his mind yeah well he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely out of his mind</p>
<p>but i mean how many people</p>
<p>have you ever met and show business that aren&rsquo;t out of</p>
<p>their mind no totally</p>
<p>but when you become an action</p>
<p>superstar and i think</p>
<p>he kind of wanted to be</p>
<p>the characters in the</p>
<p>movies he was playing</p>
<p>yeah he wanted to be out for justice for real</p>
<p>after he did that shit</p>
<p>and he was like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go be a cop and</p>
<p>you know he actually i just did i&rsquo;m just another</p>
<p>cop no you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking sick so crazy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been training</p>
<p>eagles to wear hats for</p>
<p>twenty years</p>
<p>i was very disappointed</p>
<p>i was hoping it was</p>
<p>gonna rock the ponytail</p>
<p>better be had</p>
<p>the ponytail kind of makes it with him and something</p>
<p>about him having that ponytail</p>
<p>it makes him look more like samurai</p>
<p>style you know</p>
<p>yeah i like that ponytail i</p>
<p>think you should rock that shit</p>
<p>i just realized what it is</p>
<p>about his films</p>
<p>the expression that he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never had in the film and i was always like</p>
<p>kind of wondering what it what he&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>been out of breath</p>
<p>like you never</p>
<p>know me like his face was always in control</p>
<p>even after five like ten dudes you turn the last dude</p>
<p>and not be breathing</p>
<p>how about the one with</p>
<p>kelly the brock</p>
<p>where he was in a coma</p>
<p>for like years</p>
<p>and then he came out of coma and just</p>
<p>got some fucking acupuncture</p>
<p>did some meditating</p>
<p>next thing you</p>
<p>know he&rsquo;s punching</p>
<p>bricks and shit and running up hills</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m back back in</p>
<p>shape like he gets back in shape</p>
<p>after being in a coma</p>
<p>for years he gets back in</p>
<p>shape like couple days you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>punching the makiwara out there in the desert and shit</p>
<p>doing his forums</p>
<p>meditating incense</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hilarious he&rsquo;s acting</p>
<p>your show on the air</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s genius man his</p>
<p>movies are even better man</p>
<p>his movies are goddamn classic</p>
<p>i ordered some</p>
<p>movie called the room</p>

<p>but all these guys have better</p>
<p>video quality on pcs really</p>
<p>well why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>start running from a pc let&rsquo;s run boot camp</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t mind putting boot camp is it that big of a deal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not hard</p>
<p>right i had it on this computer and</p>
<p>it was just nothing</p>
<p>brian hates windows</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t want to put windows</p>
<p>on my laptop</p>
<p>feel like a big</p>
<p>fan of windows one</p>
<p>wrong email my shit&rsquo;s all fucked i don&rsquo;t mind</p>
<p>maybe we should get a pc just to do this</p>
<p>should we get a pc just to do this maybe</p>
<p>i might buy a computer for you faggots</p>
<p>how about that broadcast</p>
<p>what a confusing message daddy sends us</p>
<p>who call us all faggots</p>
<p>kind of a fucking show is this</p>
<p>brian did you have</p>
<p>apples weighed like when they were</p>
<p>first coming out were you into them then like when</p>
<p>we were in well i mean elementary</p>
<p>school i had i use them like apple one two</p>
<p>did you i&rsquo;m saying did you like them then</p>
<p>i like them back then but i</p>
<p>never i grew up with pcs just because i was a</p>
<p>broke ass and i just</p>
<p>build my own computers and stuff like that</p>
<p>you build your own computers</p>
<p>i can still do that</p>
<p>and that scares you</p>
<p>i made a couple computers i</p>
<p>built a couple computers from scratch</p>
<p>who the fuck are you guys man well i mean i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not good at it i need someone to help me</p>
<p>along the way like my friend andrew&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a psycho genius and he knows are he</p>
<p>used to make computers for a living and i</p>
<p>could always call him like dude i&rsquo;m fucked up i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>flash the bios</p>
<p>help me tell me what to do here you know i could get</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that hard it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>once you understand that a</p>
<p>motherboard is for a certain cpu</p>
<p>and you know they match</p>
<p>and you know how to put it on and you have all the</p>
<p>pieces you know</p>
<p>where it goes</p>
<p>then you know</p>
<p>where the memory goes then you know</p>
<p>where the hard</p>
<p>drive goes it&rsquo;s not that hard and then</p>
<p>the hard part is getting it to boot up loading windows</p>
<p>and then getting all your</p>
<p>peripherals your keyboards all that shit to sync up at</p>
<p>least it used to be back in the windows</p>
<p>you know 95 and 98 days that was when i</p>
<p>started that&rsquo;s when i was making computers</p>
<p>but i would make my own pcs</p>
<p>just go to fries and buy a box it</p>
<p>sounds really intimidating to me it&rsquo;s not that hard man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really not that hard it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>smart plugging</p>
<p>things yeah</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t know any coding i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>like when i</p>
<p>would like go</p>
<p>into the i knew like command prompts for certain</p>
<p>things in windows you know</p>
<p>i know how to ping servers and</p>
<p>stuff like that but there&rsquo;s most shit i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>most shit was just</p>
<p>things that friends told me or i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>read a book on</p>
<p>or something like that it&rsquo;s a lot easier nowadays wait</p>
<p>stupid shit like jumper settings yeah it was</p>
<p>oh yeah there</p>
<p>was always and you had to have the memory and the</p>
<p>right slot or a wooden boot right</p>
<p>you know you put the memory in the</p>
<p>wrong slot it didn&rsquo;t recognize it because they have</p>
<p>to start with</p>
<p>this one&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>frequencies can it</p>
<p>match with the</p>
<p>video cards can</p>
<p>yeah and then if you got</p>
<p>crazy once you really got cocky</p>
<p>started overclocking your shit</p>
<p>you know you like well you know it says</p>
<p>three hundred megahertz but i</p>
<p>think i get up to three</p>
<p>fifty and not burn it out</p>
<p>but nowadays i just like max</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s way easier for creative work and</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s way easier but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re way more expensive</p>
<p>you know as long as you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>stupid really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that many so</p>
<p>you can get a refurb</p>
<p>for four hundred dollars</p>
<p>way faster than any</p>
<p>right but if you</p>
<p>wanna get a laptop man you get a</p>
<p>badass fucking laptop for</p>
<p>twelve hundred</p>
<p>bucks from windows yeah from mac you get that</p>
<p>they get the macbook</p>
<p>which is like a thousand bucks and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty good man</p>
<p>twelve hundred</p>
<p>bucks you can get a windows laptop that is blu ray</p>
<p>and has a one</p>
<p>terabyte fucking hard drive and</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>have more shit man that you get more bang for your buck</p>
<p>if you buy a windows one</p>
<p>more shit for your pennies</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>the quality is not as good i mean the thing</p>
<p>about max is like you get like one of those</p>
<p>power books like the keyboards</p>
<p>badass like the way it&rsquo;s the form factors like really</p>
<p>solid like the</p>
<p>build qualities excellent</p>
<p>like sometimes you get a pc laptop</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like plastic and it feels like it&rsquo;s falling</p>
<p>apart in your hand there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely somewhat like sony&rsquo;s my favorite pc made</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>end companies man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s high end companies that make like dope shit</p>
<p>alienware it&rsquo;s important to have a</p>
<p>bunch of different options man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important for you know there</p>
<p>would be a windows and a mac and a linux and unix and</p>
<p>there should be more there</p>
<p>should be more different</p>
<p>things that people can choose from and make</p>
<p>these motherfuckers</p>
<p>come out with the best shit</p>
<p>quickest you know yeah</p>
<p>absolutely look</p>
<p>how much better windows is now why because of max os 10</p>
<p>you know they they they had to</p>
<p>catch up they had to get come up</p>
<p>those cool shit</p>
<p>you know all the</p>
<p>stuff that looks cool to look at you know</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s all that is it</p>
<p>people think that&rsquo;s nonsense</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need that i just need a computer to work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all fun</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a part of the</p>
<p>experience makes the experience</p>
<p>it gives it more flavor</p>
<p>you know totally</p>
<p>just regular computing i like the</p>
<p>when you go down to an application</p>
<p>and it bounces up and you when you loaded it goes doing</p>
<p>going to yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s part of</p>
<p>experience with</p>
<p>everyone yeah it&rsquo;s fun you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s horrible</p>
<p>i was using a pc the other day</p>
<p>and it says you know you have updates you know</p>
<p>click here to restart or it says restart later</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like no i don&rsquo;t want to restart now restart</p>
<p>later every</p>
<p>three minutes that same window will</p>
<p>pop up like there&rsquo;s no way to just say hey leave me</p>
<p>alone i&rsquo;ll restart it when i want to it&rsquo;s not a pc</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s on a pc it has</p>
<p>that time no</p>
<p>no i forgot how</p>
<p>annoying that used to be</p>
<p>it was like restart</p>
<p>later restart now you know</p>
<p>this is like come on i said restart</p>
<p>later a million times they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>definitely not up to</p>
<p>where wind or</p>
<p>where mac is but i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re a lot closer than they used to be</p>
<p>i think windows 7</p>
<p>is supposed</p>
<p>to be pretty goddamn close</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s asking</p>
<p>about mark emory</p>
<p>a couple people are asking about</p>
<p>someone saying the mark emory</p>
<p>the prince of pot rj leblanc</p>
<p>another guy saying as a canadian i&rsquo;m ashamed we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>extraditing mark emory</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a black eye</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a dude in canada that was selling pot seeds</p>
<p>he was selling seeds just seeds on the internet</p>
<p>and seeds you know</p>
<p>italy no store</p>
<p>and sell them all over the world the united</p>
<p>states they want him arrested for being a drug dealer</p>
<p>for some seeds for salt sage</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re gonna charge you like</p>
<p>millions of dollars in traffic and</p>
<p>all the seeds i could have been turned into pot</p>
<p>could have been sold and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a drug dealer for fucking seeds for a plant i mean</p>
<p>it is so amazing it&rsquo;s so amazing that they</p>
<p>could pull that shit off</p>
<p>no i mean it&rsquo;s the dumbest</p>
<p>thing ever that&rsquo;s the whole idea</p>
<p>that you can have anything that doesn&rsquo;t affect</p>
<p>other people and you can make it illegal</p>
<p>you can make anything illegal that doesn&rsquo;t why why</p>
<p>how the fucking</p>
<p>you tell one person with a can and can&rsquo;t experience</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty incredible</p>
<p>but yeah you can buy those this</p>
<p>mind boggling that this is</p>
<p>still going on</p>
<p>i would thought that with the internet and</p>
<p>everything that this</p>
<p>would all been</p>
<p>fixed by now</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s so much more access to information</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much more</p>
<p>transparency we we know like</p>
<p>how everything you</p>
<p>know supposed to be in</p>
<p>place we know the real</p>
<p>history behind pot and</p>
<p>why how is it still here</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s that still</p>
<p>going on tom</p>
<p>fix that um</p>
<p>do it tom fix it bitch</p>
<p>do it right now</p>
<p>nothing fix anything top score</p>
<p>got out it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s like constitution page two page two</p>
<p>two thousand and ten</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when when are we</p>
<p>not gonna have bad words when are we not</p>
<p>gonna have ridiculous laws</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t for sure</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just go and make drugs legal</p>
<p>that that can&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>because then people</p>
<p>gonna sell the drugs</p>
<p>everywhere there&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>about drugs being illegal the only thing that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>about it is that it&rsquo;s hard for</p>
<p>those people to move around</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re talking about like heroin</p>
<p>and math and shit like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for them to sneak around and sell that shit</p>
<p>like if you</p>
<p>watch that documentary this documentary on um</p>
<p>on oxycontin</p>
<p>called the oxycontin express</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about florida</p>
<p>where they have</p>
<p>no database in florida so anybody can just</p>
<p>get a doctor&rsquo;s prescription and go to</p>
<p>these health management clinics and you get</p>
<p>some oxycontin</p>
<p>you can go like a mile</p>
<p>down the road to another one get some more another one</p>
<p>yeah they don&rsquo;t have a database connecting all</p>
<p>these patients together</p>
<p>so all these people have problems with oxycontins</p>
<p>and they have like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a one stop shop they have the doctor and the</p>
<p>pharmacy right there in the place</p>
<p>so you go in</p>
<p>you see the doctor</p>
<p>the doctor gives you a prescription</p>
<p>you go right next door you get some heroin</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>nuts man you know what&rsquo;s amazing is that with weed</p>
<p>is that obviously</p>
<p>the reason when</p>
<p>reason anything</p>
<p>exist is because it generates</p>
<p>cash flow you know people make money</p>
<p>off of having something</p>
<p>legal or illegal or</p>
<p>why they allow something because you can make</p>
<p>money from it</p>
<p>it makes you wonder</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t they eventually make more money</p>
<p>with we being legal like</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that something that</p>
<p>could be profitable</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be profitable</p>
<p>for everybody the problem is you can&rsquo;t control it</p>
<p>see if you&rsquo;re selling gasoline</p>
<p>i mean you can&rsquo;t just get gasoline man you</p>
<p>gotta go to the dude who is</p>
<p>buying it from the dude who&rsquo;s pumping it i mean or the</p>
<p>one company that&rsquo;s pumping it and refining it and then</p>
<p>shipping it and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking very hard</p>
<p>to take control</p>
<p>of that i&rsquo;m saying that you</p>
<p>know business</p>
<p>structure well</p>
<p>the problem you</p>
<p>would have is you</p>
<p>would probably have some sort of a</p>
<p>deal that&rsquo;s very similar to what they have with farmers</p>
<p>right now whereas</p>
<p>with farmers</p>
<p>like say if you have like corn you buy like corn</p>
<p>seeds from monsanto or whatever that fucking you know</p>
<p>those companies are that are</p>
<p>you know huge</p>
<p>crop companies</p>
<p>well they own</p>
<p>those seeds man you can&rsquo;t like extract</p>
<p>those seeds</p>
<p>from this year&rsquo;s crop and then plant them</p>
<p>again next year</p>
<p>no they&rsquo;ll fucking sue you if you do that right like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to use</p>
<p>those seeds</p>
<p>again they lease</p>
<p>you those seeds</p>
<p>for like a season</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really pretty crazy like</p>
<p>they patent</p>
<p>plants and the</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>genetically modified</p>
<p>you know foods</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s two concerns people out there</p>
<p>the concern</p>
<p>about diseases</p>
<p>because like these</p>
<p>things are immune because either they&rsquo;re not natural</p>
<p>you create them or what if they get diseases what if</p>
<p>diseases are</p>
<p>transmitted</p>
<p>with the humans or whatever</p>
<p>what if you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>animals that eat</p>
<p>them and they get sick and you know you know whatever</p>
<p>but but that&rsquo;s one concern people have but the</p>
<p>other concern is that someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna own the patent to fucking plants</p>
<p>you genetically modify</p>
<p>like a type of corn or tomato or something like that</p>
<p>and you you get</p>
<p>those seeds to a certain</p>
<p>level you want them</p>
<p>you can fucking copyright</p>
<p>those that&rsquo;s my corn yeah that&rsquo;s their shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unbelievable so like if someone in another farm</p>
<p>down the road</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>maybe somehow another seeds got into</p>
<p>his farm and they find that</p>
<p>this guy is illegally growing corn with</p>
<p>their seeds</p>
<p>they can put that guy in jail</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking seeds</p>
<p>that how did anybody</p>
<p>allow that to happen</p>
<p>so if there were</p>
<p>if there was weed</p>
<p>would there just be too much</p>
<p>cross i don&rsquo;t know i mean i just</p>
<p>think at a certain</p>
<p>point in time that the</p>
<p>monkey would be out of the cage</p>
<p>is if we became</p>
<p>legal the problem is</p>
<p>once we becomes</p>
<p>legal it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna get that</p>
<p>genie back in the hole</p>
<p>you would have to</p>
<p>they would have to have some massive</p>
<p>government campaign of propaganda and disinformation</p>
<p>where people were smoking weed and</p>
<p>jumping off cliffs</p>
<p>and shooting themselves in the head</p>
<p>they would have to do something like that</p>
<p>where mass chaos</p>
<p>is forming because the marijuana</p>
<p>today is too</p>
<p>strong and you</p>
<p>would have like fucking dan rather</p>
<p>would we talk is he</p>
<p>still alive</p>
<p>being alive</p>
<p>you would have one of</p>
<p>those dudes on tv</p>
<p>you know talking</p>
<p>about how this</p>
<p>mass suicides are</p>
<p>happening all</p>
<p>across the country directly linked to this new</p>
<p>alaskan ak 47 weed being sold in</p>
<p>southern california</p>
<p>right in tacos my brother was doing</p>
<p>great and just</p>
<p>started smoking weed and</p>
<p>shelter for the biggest car you could find</p>
<p>way to do what you</p>
<p>standing on</p>
<p>the side of the road i&rsquo;m like what are you doing man</p>
<p>we gonna run across the highway like not yet not yet</p>
<p>they ran boom you couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how good the weed is</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we</p>
<p>would see night and day</p>
<p>every day they were just</p>
<p>until the you know the president on tv and said</p>
<p>obviously we&rsquo;ve made a mistake</p>
<p>we need to pull back</p>
<p>we need to gather up our resources</p>
<p>we need to look at this intelligently</p>
<p>we got a situation</p>
<p>we made it we tried it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>okay we know what&rsquo;s best for our country</p>
<p>we did make a hundred billion dollars</p>
<p>first yeah before but now we&rsquo;re gonna pull the plug</p>
<p>i think the problem is that the</p>
<p>money would get distributed the wrong way</p>
<p>we live in a company</p>
<p>we live in a society</p>
<p>right now that&rsquo;s controlled by a series of companies</p>
<p>and these gigantic corporations like oil companies and</p>
<p>they have they&rsquo;re making so much</p>
<p>money doing it this way</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no incentive whatsoever to change</p>
<p>it would have to be a moment where they knew that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on peak oil place</p>
<p>where like literally we&rsquo;re running out of</p>
<p>petroleum like there&rsquo;s no more left in the world</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way we can keep this</p>
<p>going and if we ever got to that</p>
<p>space then they would have to do something</p>
<p>but until they do they&rsquo;re not going to change shit man</p>
<p>if you switch to an agriculture</p>
<p>based society that&rsquo;s running off</p>
<p>corn ethanol</p>
<p>and you can make fuel out of hemp too man</p>
<p>you can make</p>
<p>all kinds of fuel you can make oils out of hemp</p>
<p>you can make plastic out of hemp you can make</p>
<p>like a particle</p>
<p>board that&rsquo;s like five times</p>
<p>stronger than most wood</p>
<p>like happens</p>
<p>like a really</p>
<p>a really strong wood</p>
<p>it makes incredible</p>
<p>paper makes incredible cloth</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all illegal it should</p>
<p>be like way</p>
<p>further along</p>
<p>with solar power isn&rsquo;t that really effective and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not as easy as it looks really yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to extract</p>
<p>energy from the sun like that</p>
<p>very difficult i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re much more efficient at it now than they were</p>
<p>just a few years ago</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still not</p>
<p>quite there</p>
<p>it looks i know</p>
<p>about it because</p>
<p>we were looking into it when i was living in</p>
<p>colorado you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite power a</p>
<p>house on solar</p>
<p>power it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>you have to have a lot of</p>
<p>panels and to go straight solar</p>
<p>it has to be</p>
<p>sunny a lot like</p>
<p>if it snows and rains for a few days you know</p>
<p>you ain&rsquo;t getting any light</p>
<p>my dad had it set up he</p>
<p>built his own solar</p>
<p>collectors and put it on his</p>
<p>house and he just</p>
<p>had it just so it heated his water</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gonna i</p>
<p>guess do it sometime in the future and have</p>
<p>it do something like that word</p>
<p>this is only</p>
<p>going to do this you know but but</p>
<p>still it&rsquo;s like hey he</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re here with my friend</p>
<p>tom did it in oregon</p>
<p>and he used windmills</p>
<p>right and he had so much</p>
<p>power he was</p>
<p>generating probably</p>
<p>selling back yeah come on yeah</p>
<p>how come more people aren&rsquo;t doing that though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not cheap man he was a</p>
<p>he was a director he was a director and he had a lot of</p>
<p>money and he</p>
<p>you know he had a like a badass farm up there</p>
<p>and he put it all together</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>yeah pretty interesting i have so much problems</p>
<p>selling it back to the</p>
<p>power company</p>
<p>yeah yeah he was he was a smart dude</p>
<p>very very selfish</p>
<p>he was funny man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of the few men</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;ve ever met in my life that does not like kids</p>
<p>had kids and does not like them</p>
<p>really yep i would</p>
<p>hate it cause i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>adults i think</p>
<p>yeah i think he</p>
<p>started hating them around</p>
<p>12 he had kids he said</p>
<p>it ruined his</p>
<p>relationship said it wasn&rsquo;t fun it totally changes the</p>
<p>whole relationship i don&rsquo;t like kids</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got this new wife</p>
<p>after he divorced his wife</p>
<p>and you know the</p>
<p>kids are full row and divorced his wife got some new</p>
<p>chick i didn&rsquo;t want to have kids</p>
<p>he goes and i like her just fine we get</p>
<p>along to it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>bring in kids and fuck this up</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s kids just change the</p>
<p>whole relationship</p>
<p>movie director</p>
<p>tv director</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a character man</p>
<p>yeah they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite have it to the</p>
<p>point where you can be totally</p>
<p>self sufficient on just</p>
<p>solar power</p>
<p>but couldn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say even if the</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m saying the wind</p>
<p>you know power</p>
<p>so effective that like at</p>
<p>least the government would</p>
<p>invest more in</p>
<p>using that like</p>
<p>maybe not every</p>
<p>individual person but they</p>
<p>would want to use that more</p>
<p>cause cheaper</p>
<p>i mean then cause</p>
<p>then over time buying</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it works that way because i</p>
<p>think in order to have enough</p>
<p>power from windmills</p>
<p>to like to power your</p>
<p>house and keep all your shit going</p>
<p>you have to have pretty significant windmills</p>
<p>you know like you can&rsquo;t have it for an</p>
<p>apartment building for everybody in the fucking</p>
<p>building that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be using all that</p>
<p>power for an office</p>
<p>building it&rsquo;s like no you need more</p>
<p>power than that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have</p>
<p>windmills aren&rsquo;t gonna</p>
<p>power a fucking office</p>
<p>building you know saying</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna need like a</p>
<p>whole field of windmills you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be ridiculous</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not economically viable i</p>
<p>guess they have to</p>
<p>they have to consider all that shit i think it</p>
<p>the problem is</p>
<p>once we have a solution</p>
<p>we kind of like stopped looking how that have</p>
<p>you know a different way to do it like</p>
<p>you know people go well you know we</p>
<p>need to figure out cars that run on anything else but</p>
<p>we got cars are on gas they&rsquo;re pretty badass</p>
<p>and i really don&rsquo;t really want to fuck with</p>
<p>cars that run</p>
<p>out of hydrogen i mean they only get to the</p>
<p>point where they have to do it</p>
<p>right i think i</p>
<p>think the future</p>
<p>because it seems like</p>
<p>right now we&rsquo;re having so much</p>
<p>electronics that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using more and more and more and more</p>
<p>power but i</p>
<p>think once the future catches up or the</p>
<p>technology catches up we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have less and less</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna have a</p>
<p>stereo and a</p>
<p>phone and a tv</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna have one</p>
<p>thing that does all this shit</p>
<p>right perfect so i think</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to balance itself out</p>
<p>you know yeah maybe</p>
<p>maybe but you know i wonder like when</p>
<p>they have like electric cars like they have that tesla</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>tesla electric car</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t handle that well</p>
<p>one of the reasons why it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>that well is because there&rsquo;s so much weight in the back</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these batteries in the back and in the</p>
<p>front there&rsquo;s like nothing well battery</p>
<p>technology seems to be the one</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s kind of hit a wall</p>
<p>completely but i</p>
<p>think you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one invention away from</p>
<p>going over that</p>
<p>wall right right</p>
<p>right yeah i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right i think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna come out with some fucking</p>
<p>crazy new thing that</p>
<p>allows you to</p>
<p>get like a million times more information on</p>
<p>a single yeah</p>
<p>can hold more</p>
<p>this battery last five years yeah</p>
<p>this battery will</p>
<p>never die yeah</p>
<p>can you imagine</p>
<p>but if you crack it open it makes a</p>
<p>black hole and eats yeah</p>
<p>you will lose your</p>
<p>penis if you</p>
<p>break this battery you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>covered in the same shit that</p>
<p>wolverine&rsquo;s bones are made out of ammanium you know</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get through it with bullets</p>
<p>you can run over it with a car and it won&rsquo;t break</p>
<p>if it didn&rsquo;t break</p>
<p>but whoever invents whoever</p>
<p>breaks that battery wall is a</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the guy that</p>
<p>bill gates that like whatever it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the scene lost</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be something within our lifetime</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be so mind blowing</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna change everything</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>like we were talking about this google</p>
<p>thing google buzz</p>
<p>that you know i was talking</p>
<p>about twitter like i was hoping twitter was</p>
<p>gonna be it right</p>
<p>but like what i didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>about twitter two years ago</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about twitter i never even</p>
<p>heard of it what&rsquo;s funny is i knew</p>
<p>about twitter for a while and i would use it</p>
<p>but then i was like</p>
<p>this is not that good</p>
<p>then suddenly everyone started</p>
<p>using it at the same time it just caught the fuck on</p>
<p>i think also</p>
<p>people realize it&rsquo;s better to make people give them a</p>
<p>limited amount of characters to</p>
<p>choose from well that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>this google buzz</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what this google buzz</p>
<p>takes away that</p>
<p>because yeah it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like twitter but</p>
<p>long can you type for i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there is a oh</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the difference between</p>
<p>for the most part like</p>
<p>entertaining</p>
<p>videos that people post online</p>
<p>like if someone&rsquo;s like check out</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s fucking mad somebody i know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i look and it&rsquo;s the time code</p>
<p>starts getting up there like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fun his</p>
<p>eight minutes</p>
<p>shorter i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch this right</p>
<p>right yeah make it</p>
<p>short this is more like</p>
<p>this is more like a facebook</p>
<p>and facebook&rsquo;s</p>
<p>status updates i</p>
<p>guess to like</p>
<p>mixed with twitter</p>
<p>people are gonna</p>
<p>write fucking</p>
<p>novels and shit</p>
<p>yeah that is a problem man people</p>
<p>still goddamn for books</p>
<p>i get emails from people</p>
<p>with no paragraphs just these</p>
<p>floods of information</p>
<p>that they just love to hear themselves</p>
<p>talk with the shitty</p>
<p>thing though is it takes their</p>
<p>email address and</p>
<p>takes all your contacts and makes it your friends and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>so what sucks is if you have your</p>
<p>you know of</p>
<p>course this only works on some people but if you have a</p>
<p>girlfriend and then you have your mistress</p>
<p>and you have you know your mistress&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll bang in also</p>
<p>and then you have like all these</p>
<p>three people that are now friends and reading each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s twitter facebook pages</p>
<p>and it just automatically does that too</p>
<p>right when you sign up it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>automatic well this is one of the</p>
<p>things that we talked</p>
<p>about a long time ago is that we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>i think that we&rsquo;re getting to a</p>
<p>point where there will be no more secrets</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s gonna be impossible i mean the convergence</p>
<p>of information</p>
<p>from your life to my life and all the</p>
<p>things that you know and all the</p>
<p>things that i know all things i&rsquo;ve seen you&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna share those eventually</p>
<p>those things are all gonna come together</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not gonna be any secrets</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get to a point</p>
<p>in you know the not so distant future</p>
<p>where people are</p>
<p>literally gonna be able to read each other&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be crazy man</p>
<p>you know i think i</p>
<p>think that we&rsquo;re getting to some strange time right now</p>
<p>in our in our society and in our culture this</p>
<p>in our species</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting to some strange time</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re just dabbling in the edges</p>
<p>of of of some some new</p>
<p>crazy great</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna change everything we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you feel like that when you like you see the news and</p>
<p>you hear about shit they&rsquo;re doing with like the</p>
<p>large hadron collider and you</p>
<p>think about all the scientific</p>
<p>experiments going on</p>
<p>all the shit they&rsquo;re doing with harp and</p>
<p>i feel like i always feel like we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>kind of like</p>
<p>at that fork</p>
<p>where we either</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re about to like</p>
<p>experience something</p>
<p>great or like there&rsquo;s impending doom and like</p>
<p>some awful shits</p>
<p>people have always felt like that too because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so dumb we will occasionally fuck up and shatter</p>
<p>everything you know i mean look at</p>
<p>what happened in</p>
<p>world war ii</p>
<p>look at the fact</p>
<p>that we really did drop atomic bombs on people yeah</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s so non specific</p>
<p>i mean we hit entire cities</p>
<p>i mean we weren&rsquo;t trying to just go</p>
<p>after the military we dropped</p>
<p>giant weapons of atomic destruction</p>
<p>on entire cities</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>they still reach</p>
<p>it it was like 9 11</p>
<p>for them in</p>
<p>hawaii when they</p>
<p>dropped bombs on</p>
<p>wide that was like 9 11 but yeah</p>
<p>seventy years ago</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not mean most times we talk</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>crazy talking</p>
<p>a hundred years ago yeah</p>
<p>civil war and shits</p>
<p>yeah really racist</p>
<p>seventy years ago ain&rsquo;t shit man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>you know imagine</p>
<p>if twitters and webcams were</p>
<p>in back then</p>
<p>oh my god you know what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>is when you look into</p>
<p>history and not so distant history</p>
<p>like look into like the 1960s</p>
<p>and you see some of the shit that they were planning</p>
<p>like operation northwoods</p>
<p>you know if you</p>
<p>never read that operation</p>
<p>which was they were</p>
<p>going to make fake attacks on american civilians</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to attack guantanamo bay</p>
<p>and tell people it was the cubans</p>
<p>and so that</p>
<p>would get everybody</p>
<p>fired up when we</p>
<p>were with cuba</p>
<p>yeah freedom</p>
<p>information act</p>
<p>is operation</p>
<p>northwood you</p>
<p>should check</p>

<p>what they were able to do back then</p>
<p>in the 50s and the 60s like</p>
<p>in the 50s the government did a</p>
<p>thing called operation midnight climax</p>
<p>where they opened up brothels</p>
<p>and they dosed people with lsd</p>
<p>that john&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these dudes were</p>
<p>going there to fuck</p>
<p>these hookers</p>
<p>they would go to</p>
<p>these whorehouses that were run by the fucking cia</p>
<p>in new york and san francisco</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>douse these guys with acid</p>
<p>and then just like</p>

<p>motherfuckers you know</p>
<p>what it is it rains when it rains in la they all come</p>

<p>little motherfucker have you</p>
<p>sprayed raid around or whatever</p>
<p>that is i will</p>
<p>i will tonight</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing how</p>
<p>ants are like</p>
<p>these little</p>
<p>monsters that live in your</p>
<p>world and you</p>
<p>allow them to live in your</p>
<p>world because they&rsquo;re tiny</p>
<p>you know because if</p>
<p>ants were big</p>
<p>we would have fucking gigantic problems</p>
<p>did you imagine if</p>
<p>ants were like the size of of like rats a</p>
<p>big bait you and</p>
<p>magic they were that big you know how terrifying that</p>
<p>would be ants</p>
<p>would rip your arms off if they were that big</p>
<p>if ants were the size of rats</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so strong</p>
<p>they would they would</p>
<p>mangle you they would</p>
<p>drag you to the top of a tree and drop you off you</p>
<p>would all be dead</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll be dead</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just you know a few thousand times bigger than they are</p>
<p>we just deal with the fact that they&rsquo;re in our little</p>
<p>world and these colonies</p>
<p>or we don&rsquo;t even know how to communicate with each</p>
<p>other and they</p>
<p>all follow in a fucking straight line back to the hive</p>
<p>and they got a</p>
<p>queen in there and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>larva and eggs and that little fucking cunt</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s shitting out new baby</p>
<p>ants constantly</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re here talking</p>
<p>somewhere in my house</p>
<p>somewhere my</p>
<p>house has to find out</p>
<p>where it is</p>
<p>probably and there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>going on here somewhere</p>
<p>under a plate</p>
<p>somewhere you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of something they</p>
<p>can handle how</p>
<p>much like hundreds of times</p>
<p>their body weight</p>
<p>yeah yeah hundreds of times</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>monsters if</p>
<p>ants were like full</p>
<p>sized like this is</p>
<p>like size of like a</p>
<p>human or a dog or something like that</p>
<p>they would literally like</p>
<p>like a scene from the alien</p>
<p>they would rip people</p>

<p>started eating it</p>
<p>oh you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dark dude yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dark that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spooky shit</p>
<p>alright let&rsquo;s take some questions here</p>
<p>i think we&rsquo;re already over the two hour mark yeah we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right on you do it for</p>
<p>two and a half hours is</p>
<p>so fascinating</p>
<p>such good talk here and it&rsquo;s five hundred</p>
<p>eighty nine people</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at the 7am</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s a good question this guy asked nick</p>
<p>nick tkd 2000 what do you</p>
<p>think about hollis gracie getting effed up</p>
<p>hollis gracie is the</p>
<p>the great gracie</p>
<p>the greatest gracie ever supposedly this guy</p>
<p>hollis gracie who&rsquo;s like the guy</p>
<p>was one of hixon&rsquo;s original</p>
<p>training partners his son just</p>
<p>entered the</p>
<p>ufc and lost this weekend</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>real down the</p>
<p>guy because he didn&rsquo;t have a very good performance</p>
<p>and his you</p>
<p>know this fight</p>
<p>you know he got he got kind of beat up and everybody</p>
<p>expected more from him</p>
<p>but it ain&rsquo;t easy man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an easy fucking sport</p>
<p>you go in there there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tremendous amount of pressure on</p>
<p>these guys and it&rsquo;s hard for people to deal with</p>
<p>you know and some people</p>
<p>they need to be you know they need to have some bad</p>
<p>bad experiences so that they</p>
<p>learn from it and then you know either</p>
<p>bounce back or realize this isn&rsquo;t what i want to do</p>
<p>you know but some people that they just don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>the magnitude of the event till they actually get there</p>
<p>till they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under the bright</p>
<p>lights and they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>fighting to</p>
<p>guide and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like holy shit like what did i get myself into that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be so crazy</p>
<p>yeah i mean the adrenaline</p>
<p>dump is tremendous</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s so nervous</p>
<p>so much adrenaline</p>
<p>pumps out and you know that&rsquo;s why i got like</p>
<p>randy couture of such incredible</p>
<p>endurance one of the reasons besides the fact that he</p>
<p>trained so hard</p>
<p>is that the dude is so</p>
<p>relaxed he&rsquo;s been there so many times you know</p>
<p>when he gets in there he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>dumb question cannabis</p>
<p>equals weed</p>
<p>yes yes cannabis</p>
<p>equals weed</p>
<p>yeah you know the</p>
<p>funny thing when marijuana was made illegal people</p>
<p>most people don&rsquo;t even know this</p>
<p>the congress didn&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re making marijuana</p>
<p>legal or they didn&rsquo;t know they were making cannabis</p>
<p>illegal rather cannabis was like a hemp hemp was</p>
<p>they used it for fiber</p>
<p>they used it to make</p>
<p>clothes and all kinds of different things</p>
<p>and when it was made illegal it was because they</p>
<p>started printing in the</p>
<p>paper stories</p>
<p>saying that</p>
<p>blacks and mexicans</p>
<p>were smoking this new drug and they were raping</p>
<p>white women</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what got people into</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s how got people behind the whole anti</p>
<p>marijuana movement</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a reef from madness all that shit came from</p>
<p>so i have those posters up on my wall i&rsquo;ve got all</p>
<p>those videos</p>
<p>yeah reef from madness</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re goddamn hilarious</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re amazing if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen them</p>
<p>you gotta see like what kind of shit they put out</p>
<p>and they put it out just</p>
<p>because they wanted to make sure that people didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a lot of bad</p>
<p>things that can happen</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in control and people get a hold of pot</p>
<p>and you know there&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>things to keeping it illegal you know</p>
<p>you can make much more</p>
<p>money with pharmaceutical drugs you can sell people</p>
<p>what you want to sell you can control</p>
<p>those drugs and</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t control shit if if if marijuana becomes</p>
<p>legal it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>anybody can grow it&rsquo;s like really easy to grow</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve met idiots that grow weed you know</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not hard yeah you know you can figure it out</p>
<p>people can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>their life together at all they can grow some weed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just economics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real reason why marijuana is illegal but</p>
<p>blacks and mexicans will rate</p>
<p>white women if they do smoke weed</p>
<p>white guys will</p>
<p>rate white women too</p>
<p>oh yeah but not as</p>
<p>yeah same thing bro</p>
<p>read from madness rocks i agree young man</p>
<p>it was also the paper company yes newspapers yeah</p>
<p>it was william randolph hearst</p>
<p>william randolph hearst owned the newspaper companies</p>
<p>he owned you know hearst publications but he also owned</p>
<p>printing rather</p>
<p>paper mills</p>
<p>and so he had like forest filled with trees</p>
<p>when they wanted to convert</p>
<p>everything over to hemp</p>
<p>paper because hemp makes a much better paper</p>
<p>he did not wanna do that it</p>
<p>would cost him millions of dollars would have</p>
<p>fucked up his whole business he would have had to</p>
<p>chop all his trees down and then start</p>
<p>planting hemp</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;d be in competition with all</p>
<p>these other people that are making</p>
<p>paper it would</p>
<p>it was an economic decision</p>
<p>so when he was getting people to</p>
<p>ban marijuana they didn&rsquo;t even know they were banning</p>
<p>hemp this industrial</p>
<p>plant that they had been</p>
<p>using for hundreds and thousands of years</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really kind of fascinating that</p>
<p>the propaganda that that guy created</p>
<p>in the 1930s when he owned all the newspapers</p>
<p>is really still in</p>
<p>place today i mean people</p>
<p>still believe it today</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty brilliant business strategy too</p>
<p>right i mean he was a</p>
<p>motherfucker man</p>
<p>yeah i mean that was the guy that orson wells made that</p>
<p>movie rose by</p>
<p>about no it was a movie</p>
<p>citizen kane</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it is that you though</p>
<p>howard hughes</p>
<p>i thought it was william</p>
<p>randolph hearst</p>
<p>but yeah yeah it&rsquo;s hearst</p>
<p>yeah so hearst is the one yeah that&rsquo;s the guy yeah</p>
<p>i mean he was just like the guy he was like the</p>
<p>first motherfucker that controlled</p>
<p>everything yeah</p>
<p>that is really fascinating now that it was a</p>
<p>paper because i got yeah i mean</p>
