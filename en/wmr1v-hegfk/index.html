<p>healthy lose weight and feel great call</p>
<p>now to speak with dr. Berg at eight six</p>

<p>four two nine two let&rsquo;s get right into</p>
<p>the calls because there&rsquo;s a lot of them</p>
<p>a leandro you had a question about the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet go ahead you&rsquo;re on the</p>

<p>really enjoy it</p>
<p>my only concern with is that so while</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dropping weight I noticed most of it</p>
<p>is coming off of my upper body which</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem but most of the</p>
<p>fat in my body is sword in my glutes and</p>
<p>legs</p>
<p>so my upper body is looking less</p>
<p>proportional to my lower so I was</p>
<p>wondering like what can I do to fix this</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure most of it is because you know</p>

<p>playing a lot of video games so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important you know that you know if you</p>
<p>can answer that question for him I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>really appreciate that&rsquo;s my first</p>
<p>question and then my second question is</p>
<p>how exactly am I supposed to use the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>to build muscle and like size with two</p>
<p>meals a day when I thought that they</p>
<p>were both used to get lean and drop away</p>
<p>should I aim for a certain number of</p>
<p>calories and probably do like 75 percent</p>
<p>fat 20% protein 5% cards if not what</p>
<p>would you recommend that&rsquo;s my second</p>
<p>point are you doing two meals right now</p>
<p>yeah I got I started off like at four</p>
<p>meals I was doing a lot of different</p>
<p>things but uh I said intermittent</p>
<p>fasting which which has been helping but</p>
<p>yeah like like I mentioned a lot of it</p>
<p>facts coming off of my upper body hold</p>
<p>are you I&rsquo;m 26</p>
<p>okay and can you give me a quick example</p>
<p>of what you eat as one of the meals so</p>
<p>in the morning I typically have like</p>
<p>three eggs bacon with like half of an</p>
<p>onion tomato I like a lot of vegetables</p>
<p>really like with broccoli too and cheese</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like for my second no I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>typically have like five cups of salad</p>
<p>or organic salads with like some</p>
<p>Parmesan cheese</p>
<p>ranch Organic ranch and some chicken or</p>
<p>steak okay oh and I have Quito coffee</p>
<p>too</p>
<p>okay good and you have that in the</p>
<p>morning the Quito coffee right yeah okay</p>
<p>actually drinking it right now okay</p>
<p>great right alright so let&rsquo;s just talk</p>
<p>about that there&rsquo;s a couple things that</p>
<p>I would recommend you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about spot reduction or kind of</p>
<p>losing weight in a certain place</p>
<p>unfortunately it&rsquo;s very difficult to you</p>
<p>know always lose weight where you want</p>
<p>to lose it usually comes off the usually</p>
<p>comes off the midsection first sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the upper as well you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to be losing muscle mass you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be losing fat but especially with</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a big concern because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re losing weight and midsection but</p>
<p>their their hips are still the situation</p>
<p>the the thing you&rsquo;re gonna have to do is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to give it more</p>
<p>time but you can also add some high</p>
<p>intensity interval training to the key</p>
<p>to in a minute fasting because that will</p>
<p>especially if your lower extremity you</p>
<p>start working those muscles some of that</p>
<p>weight is not just fat it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like atrophy so that will help you</p>
<p>greatly the other thing if you want to</p>
<p>take it to the next level</p>
<p>is do this high-intensity full-body</p>
<p>workout when in the more a little</p>
<p>earlier in the morning so now I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>recommending this for everyone if they</p>
<p>have a blood sugar issue but if you do</p>
<p>this when you&rsquo;re fasting the workout boy</p>
<p>it just it just accelerates everything</p>
<p>just like almost it just sucks that fat</p>
<p>right in it because if your body is just</p>
<p>demanding more energy so it goes after</p>
<p>the fat reserve because before I was</p>
<p>talking about having it right right</p>
<p>before you eat during the meal the</p>
<p>window of eating and then maybe just</p>
<p>right after to have the fuel but some</p>
<p>people are seeing more changes if they</p>
<p>do it in an empty stomach I might want</p>
<p>to try that unless your blood sugars are</p>
<p>an issue you can always improve things</p>
<p>to by probably that that coffee I would</p>
<p>because sometimes that fat or butter or</p>
<p>coconut in the in the coffee can you</p>
<p>know act like a meal so you might want</p>
<p>to just to coffee a little cream and</p>
<p>then nothing else and that will help</p>
<p>you the other thing that&rsquo;s gonna help</p>
<p>you retain muscle protein you need and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about this more on the</p>
<p>board in a little bit but you need</p>
<p>potassium to grow muscle you need</p>
<p>potassium to retain muscle and so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the vegetables that great you</p>
<p>might want to add a little bit more</p>
<p>potassium as a supplement just to speed</p>
<p>things up but honestly overall I think</p>
<p>you just need to give more time and</p>
<p>eventually it&rsquo;s going to go after your</p>
<p>legs because you your body tends to go</p>
<p>after the midsection first or the upper</p>
<p>body first unfortunately all right</p>
<p>thanks for your call hey Morini I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s marine from Australia you had a</p>
<p>question in Quito and travel hi dr. Berg</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re awesome and thanks so</p>
<p>much for taking my call yeah I have two</p>
<p>quick related questions about traveling</p>
<p>overseas on the keto intermittent</p>
<p>fasting diet firstly I&rsquo;m very happy</p>
<p>eating this way is the health benefits</p>
<p>are tremendous and although I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>interested in having any cheat days I</p>
<p>will be going overseas in November</p>
<p>flying from Sydney to London across to</p>
<p>the US and flying back home from New</p>
<p>York there&rsquo;ll be many hours on the plane</p>
<p>and I would normally not think twice</p>
<p>about fasting but with 24 hours plus</p>
<p>travel and transit times in the first</p>
<p>leg of my journey alone I will have to</p>
<p>eat at some stage and traveling in coach</p>
<p>well to be honest the foods pretty</p>
<p>crappy and the salads are way too small</p>
<p>and mostly unhealthy and so what would</p>
<p>you recommend me do and secondly do you</p>
<p>have any tips for staying healthy when</p>
<p>flying so I don&rsquo;t pick up any bugs and</p>
<p>for taking supplements what would be the</p>
<p>most essential supplements you recommend</p>
<p>taking on vacation and maybe you could</p>
<p>do a video on this topic - that would be</p>
<p>awesome thanks again dr. Berg you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome Thanks</p>
<p>good good question this is always a</p>
<p>challenge because you&rsquo;re flying the the</p>
<p>food on the plane is all carbs there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no no other way then you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to bring something on the plane you</p>
<p>normally I&rsquo;ll go for nuts and I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>that like if I&rsquo;m in a situation where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like oh gosh what am I going to do</p>
<p>usually there&rsquo;s little shops that sell</p>
<p>nuts but the problem is that some of the</p>
<p>nuts always have MSG or sugar so I will</p>
<p>do peanuts and I will buy a back and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably just use that as my</p>
<p>protein there is a good amount of</p>
<p>protein in there but if you have the</p>
<p>ability to carry on some food I would</p>
<p>bring nuts and seeds as your basic thing</p>
<p>maybe even some cheese would be great</p>
<p>too it&rsquo;s hard to bring anything else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard to bring a salad but you</p>
<p>could bring a powdered green drink you</p>
<p>can do the wheatgrass or just get a</p>
<p>powdered green drink that would be your</p>
<p>salad because it&rsquo;s almost gonna you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t bring a salad on the plane unless</p>
<p>you can buy something now in certain</p>
<p>airports there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s like those</p>
<p>smoothie places Jubilee or I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember the name of them I remember</p>
<p>going up to them and saying listen I</p>
<p>need to get a kale shake and of course</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know how to make that so I</p>
<p>will say all I want is a little bit of</p>
<p>berries and a lot of kale and good</p>
<p>amount of water and I will show them how</p>
<p>to make it and they&rsquo;ll make this kale</p>
<p>shake and that&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ll do but</p>
<p>the thing that they&rsquo;ll do is they won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>put enough water so it becomes very very</p>
<p>thick and they&rsquo;ll put ice cubes I want</p>
<p>to fill the thing with water put all the</p>
<p>kale in there with a little bit of</p>
<p>berries blend it up really good and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one tip so you got the</p>
<p>powdered green and you got the kale</p>
<p>shake and there are some restaurants</p>
<p>that have decent salads and protein but</p>
<p>I would bring your own nuts and seeds</p>
<p>and just make sure that maybe like</p>
<p>pecans would be good walnuts</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t being bring cashews but I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a good idea bringing the of</p>
<p>doing a video on that and I think that</p>
<p>was I think oh yeah to protect your</p>
<p>immune system yeah when you get on the</p>
<p>plane there&rsquo;s all these people hacking</p>
<p>and coughing and there&rsquo;s germs and</p>
<p>microbes and things like that people</p>
<p>what will set you up for a low immune</p>
<p>system to get a microbe would be like</p>
<p>any type of stress in your environment</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re stressed out and I used to</p>
<p>pick up every single bug when my immune</p>
<p>system was low so there are some things</p>
<p>that you can do not necessarily to</p>
<p>avoid the germs being exposed to your</p>
<p>body but to be able to just to build up</p>
<p>your immune system one is vitamin D so</p>
<p>you can start taking vitamin D like a</p>
<p>week before that&rsquo;s really really</p>
<p>powerful and then of course vitamin C</p>
<p>just make sure the vitamin C that you</p>
<p>take is not just synthetic get the one</p>
<p>with a food base with a bioflavonoids or</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t get this synthetic vitamin C</p>
<p>will actually kind of bulletproof you in</p>
<p>a sense all right well thanks for your</p>
<p>question that was actually a good</p>
<p>question hey Jim you&rsquo;re from Ohio go</p>
<p>ahead you to question a maintaining</p>
<p>weight on the Aikido yes dr. Berg thank</p>
<p>you I am 50 years old I&rsquo;ve got down to</p>
<p>the weight that I want over about a two</p>
<p>and a half month period I actually</p>
<p>started out with the Atkins because I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get find you but about halfway</p>
<p>through so I&rsquo;m down to the point where I</p>
<p>want to be I don&rsquo;t want to lose any more</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost my belly fat I&rsquo;ve got about a</p>
<p>32 inch waist so I feel really good</p>
<p>about that I&rsquo;m very active running</p>
<p>biking so my question is how do I</p>
<p>maintain it all right like to stow</p>
<p>intermit fat yeah and I do that twice a</p>
<p>day 18-6 so yeah how do I maintain and</p>
<p>does it harm me to go in and out of</p>
<p>ketosis good question well the whole</p>
<p>goal Jim is to build up a health reserve</p>
<p>so your you&rsquo;re not on a diet you just</p>
<p>are operating off these principles of</p>
<p>you know low crap sugar you know all the</p>
<p>junk food but building up a health</p>
<p>reserve over time well your system is so</p>
<p>healthy you can get away with an</p>
<p>occasional going off the program and</p>
<p>eating certain things I mean some people</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t afford that but when you build up</p>
<p>a health reserve you know you have no</p>
<p>fatty liver and out of medication</p>
<p>everybody all the indicators are good</p>
<p>energy sleep blood pressure all those</p>
<p>are awesome and then you can afford to</p>
<p>go off of it so there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of some some gradient points from here</p>
<p>to here as far as how much you can go</p>
<p>off and is it harmful well let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing alcohol a little too</p>
<p>frequent</p>
<p>well you just like taking that liver and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like whip lashing it over</p>
<p>and over and over again so it can create</p>
<p>some problem</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s really a judgment call with you</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re building up and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having all the nutrition and avoiding</p>
<p>some of these chemicals GMO foods I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re gonna be you can go you can</p>
<p>afford to go off a little bit more but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not harmful to continue the</p>
<p>key to intermittent fasting over a long</p>
<p>period of time now some people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to lose any weight anymore they hit</p>
<p>their weight well then just increase the</p>
<p>quantity of food and maybe just a little</p>
<p>bit more fat with the meals and maybe</p>
<p>even just one more meal</p>
<p>maybe not but and then you&rsquo;ll actually</p>
<p>it may slow down the weight loss the</p>
<p>other thing that you want to think about</p>
<p>when you do this is that you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing this I think for two to four</p>
<p>months somewhere in between there it</p>
<p>takes like you may have to do this for</p>
<p>six months to eight months to really</p>
<p>build up and know that you have a health</p>
<p>reserve where you can go off more</p>
<p>frequently but you just kinda have to</p>
<p>play around with it and see how how you</p>
<p>do and if you go off the program and you</p>
<p>can monitor it by various factors like</p>
<p>blood sugars subjective how you feel</p>
<p>stress levels just quality of your</p>
<p>cognitive function to see how much you</p>
<p>can get away with but I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>get fanatical about it but you know the</p>
<p>coal-hole goal is to fill up your body</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about an</p>
<p>occasional going off the program thanks</p>
<p>for your question Jim hey Rachel you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from New York you had a question your</p>
<p>hair is too dry yes actually my hair</p>
<p>keeps breaking and splitting and getting</p>
<p>a lot of knots now I normally have</p>
<p>elbow-length hair but within the last</p>
<p>year I&rsquo;ve had to cut my hair to like a</p>
<p>mini afro and I&rsquo;ve gone to the</p>
<p>dermatologist I&rsquo;ve gone to you know the</p>
<p>internist and the most they&rsquo;ve told me</p>
<p>is that you know my iron is in normal</p>
<p>range is just on the low side of that so</p>
<p>the last four months I&rsquo;ve been taking</p>
<p>iron but I&rsquo;m not seeing a difference in</p>
<p>my hair quality mm-hmm okay good let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk about that I think I think what you</p>
<p>need is to go mainly right into more</p>
<p>healthy fats the fact that I would</p>
<p>recommend to have really good hair</p>
<p>would be GLA okay gamma linolenic acid</p>
<p>GLA it&rsquo;s from borage will that you can</p>
<p>get it from evening primrose oil and</p>
<p>black currant seed oil hemp oil but get</p>
<p>the borage oil and that should you can</p>
<p>get it in little tablets so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>preserved and start taking that that</p>
<p>will help your hair a lot because those</p>
<p>essential fatty acids are really good</p>
<p>for soft wonderful hair prevent</p>
<p>splitting and for for skin skin health</p>
<p>too so that&rsquo;s their I would go and and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget to takes either consuming</p>
<p>fish oils or the cod liver oil because</p>
<p>the fats what will help the dryness it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a dehydration not necessarily a</p>
<p>trace mineral but it&rsquo;s the healthy fats</p>
<p>all right Rachel thanks for your call</p>
<p>hey Dan you had a question you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>California yeah I&rsquo;m quite asking about</p>
<p>how do you add that to the meal that the</p>
<p>protein is not providing enough to curb</p>
<p>the carbohydrates cravings there have to</p>
<p>be pure fat or is it just predominantly</p>
<p>fat and what are some examples good</p>
<p>question so Dan yeah because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>even when you go out and let&rsquo;s say you</p>
<p>get a hamburger or you buy him here at</p>
<p>the store I mean they sell it it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>even fine fatty or hamburger it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>like ninety percent there&rsquo;s one company</p>
<p>that you can order online I&rsquo;ll actually</p>
<p>put a link down below when I get home</p>
<p>today that you can buy like seventy five</p>
<p>percent back which is wonderful so the</p>
<p>goal is to have fattier you know meats</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing that now the other thing</p>
<p>to add fats I normally go I either will</p>
<p>make a keto bomb with from coconut or</p>
<p>butter and almond flour and have a lot</p>
<p>of rest recipes online or I&rsquo;ll do I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ekkada as my fat I do a lot of almond</p>
<p>butter I&rsquo;ll do like nuts pecans I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>a lot of P cons I might take the</p>
<p>sugar-free chocolate chips and I&rsquo;ll put</p>
<p>them in almond butter or a peanut butter</p>
<p>and that will be my fat so you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have to just add more of that fat you</p>
<p>can do coconut oil</p>
<p>but like what are you gonna eat it</p>
<p>straight so you would I would do more of</p>
<p>a peanut butter type thing and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually gonna handle your hunger over a</p>
<p>period of time so that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>but yeah you&rsquo;re gonna have to add more</p>
<p>fat until the point where you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hungry</p>
<p>good question Dan hey Jose you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Nebraska go ahead you had a question</p>
<p>about the adrenal formula yeah I just</p>
<p>found you Oh a couple weeks ago I have</p>
<p>done some friends who told me about</p>
<p>doing high fat low carbs and I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>that for a couple of months but the</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;ve struggled with for years is</p>
<p>my legs at night and it&rsquo;s not restless</p>
<p>leg syndrome but I feel like the muscles</p>
<p>on my legs are pulling off and they are</p>
<p>very very painful at night and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what I need to be doing okay good</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the thing I far as the adrenal</p>
<p>goes because the adrenal affects the</p>
<p>lower extremity in the body the best</p>
<p>formula is the cortisol adrenaline</p>
<p>cortisol support formula that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>would really help you in addition to</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s usually going to be potassium</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>only done this for two week two weeks so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna probably bill of your</p>
<p>potassium reserve you can do them with</p>
<p>the electrolyte powder that I have or</p>
<p>and a lot more vegetables so like 7 to</p>
<p>10 cups of vegetables because without</p>
<p>the potassium and the muscles get achy</p>
<p>and things like that so that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>now if that doesn&rsquo;t work for some reason</p>
<p>here you&rsquo;re taking this electrolyte and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not working then you need more</p>
<p>vitamin E but get a natural vitamin E</p>
<p>complex okay that should handle the rest</p>
<p>of the majority but there&rsquo;s one last</p>
<p>thing that people do need if like a</p>
<p>small percentage of time because I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>always try the most common thing and</p>
<p>then okay if that doesn&rsquo;t work we try</p>
<p>this and then the last thing that you</p>
<p>can try if nothing else works and this</p>
<p>will probably this is the icing on the</p>
<p>cake is manganese manganese get up</p>
<p>chelated manganese supplement manganese</p>
<p>is basically good for achy muscle and</p>
<p>joint but it</p>
<p>good for disk problem it strengthens</p>
<p>your ligaments so that could be an one</p>
<p>last thing that I would use on occasion</p>
<p>and boom it&rsquo;s just handled but I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t go right to that first I would</p>
<p>do the adrenal then potassium and then</p>
<p>vitamin E and manganese as your last</p>
<p>option I think that should help you hey</p>
<p>Angela you&rsquo;re from Louisiana</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t question about Kido and</p>
<p>Hepburn go ahead</p>
<p>yeah something on the ko genic diet for</p>
<p>about two or three weeks now but I have</p>
<p>a lot of past with my stomach and stuff</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve noticed that the heartburn in</p>
<p>my chest has been really bad and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure if it&rsquo;s an ulcer or not I&rsquo;m also on</p>
<p>the road a lot I&rsquo;m a truck driver and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at your videos and I was</p>
<p>trying to find the floor filled pearls</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t find that I just wanted to</p>
<p>know what you suggested okay do you do</p>
<p>you did you notice your heartburn is</p>
<p>worse on the keto or did you have it</p>
<p>before it&rsquo;s worse recently okay</p>
<p>how many meals a day are you eating I</p>
<p>was eating one big meal a day Wow okay</p>
<p>is the heartburn when you eat or an</p>
<p>empty stomach empty stomach oh okay so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not really but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>constant almost okay is there any chance</p>
<p>that you might have an ulcer yes it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>possibility I&rsquo;ve had them in the past</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t been to a doctor or</p>
<p>anything recently so it&rsquo;s possible yes</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s talk about this is this is</p>
<p>another great question let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>pretend you have an ulcer okay if you</p>
<p>eat and you have an ulcer you should</p>
<p>feel better with eating okay so like</p>
<p>sometimes you might feel better if</p>
<p>sometimes you might not but but if you</p>
<p>start dumping apple cider vinegar down</p>
<p>your throat you&rsquo;ll feel worse especially</p>
<p>an empty stomach if you have an ulcer so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one way to quickly find out yeah</p>
<p>I have an ulcer I a grated without cider</p>
<p>vinegar but typically to get rid of</p>
<p>heartburn we need to certify the stomach</p>
<p>because if the stomach is not alkaline</p>
<p>enough the top valve on the top of the</p>
<p>stomach won&rsquo;t close and the acid squirts</p>
<p>up so we have acid reflux and then we</p>
<p>have heartburn right so it could be you</p>
<p>know the same situation where you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough acid so the thing that I</p>
<p>would do if I were you is I would start</p>
<p>taking the opposite of vinegar with my</p>
<p>meals and see if it gets worse it gets</p>
<p>worse we know we have an ulcer then we</p>
<p>have to back off that now we have to</p>
<p>heal the stomach lining and to do that</p>
<p>chlorophyll pearls is good it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>standard process product if you search</p>
<p>standard process on Amazon you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>it you can probably try to find a health</p>
<p>care practitioner or call the company</p>
<p>bit expensive but it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>chlorophyll pearls standard process and</p>
<p>then you would suck on those until</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re almost kind of real thin and</p>
<p>then swallow them and they&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>just coats the entire lining of the</p>
<p>stomach and that&rsquo;ll start healing it the</p>
<p>other thing that&rsquo;ll work</p>
<p>really good and you can get this from my</p>
<p>site as the is the wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>powder that is a lot of chlorophyll - -</p>
<p>and you could take that and that starts</p>
<p>to help heal the area but then you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really dump any acid down there so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to kind of heal the</p>
<p>system over a period of time once it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>healed after you know a period of time</p>
<p>like it could take two or three four</p>
<p>months then you start adding in the acid</p>
<p>but yeah so heartburn means that well if</p>
<p>you have an ulcer that means that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had a pretty bad health problem for a</p>
<p>long period of time because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s to</p>
<p>get an also you have to be pretty</p>
<p>unhealthy so it means you probably ate</p>
<p>poorly but I love the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing one meal a day I think that over</p>
<p>time it&rsquo;s going to help heal things you</p>
<p>might have to consume as part of your</p>
<p>vegetables more of the fermented foods</p>
<p>to make it easier to digest but those</p>
<p>are some of the things that I would</p>
<p>recommend you might have to take more</p>
<p>enzymes - if you can&rsquo;t take an acid just</p>
<p>to help you as this thing heals all</p>
<p>right good question hey Megan you&rsquo;re for</p>
<p>North Carolina go ahead you had a</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>low carbs make you dizzy</p>
<p>I got antibiotics cipro and a whole</p>
<p>bunch of stuff started happening to me</p>
<p>so the only thing that doctors were</p>
<p>saying to me is that I needed to lose</p>
<p>weight so I had hair loss I had hormone</p>
<p>problems I had insulin resistance</p>
<p>I had all that so I went on this major</p>
<p>diet about three months ago and lost 45</p>
<p>pounds in two months and all I was</p>
<p>eating was whole fruits and whole</p>
<p>vegetables nothing in packaging and I</p>
<p>was eating some nuts and some peanut</p>
<p>butters but for some reason I had</p>
<p>allergy issues on top of that it seemed</p>
<p>like everything that I put in my body my</p>
<p>throat was itching or I had an ache</p>
<p>under my right rib so I did a ton of</p>
<p>probiotics and stuff like that to try to</p>
<p>counteract that and now I&rsquo;m able to eat</p>
<p>the soy and other nuts and stuff like</p>
<p>that but before I look three months ago</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to eat any of that</p>
<p>have you seen any more videos on what to</p>
<p>eat I&rsquo;ve seen a few of them I was</p>
<p>wondering if there was any way that you</p>
<p>could maybe um do like a nutrition</p>
<p>counting nutrition chart for like daily</p>
<p>you know use because that would be so</p>
<p>beneficial yeah okay yeah I already have</p>
<p>a lot of videos on the nutritional</p>
<p>profiles of a lot of different foods but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing Megan it sounds to me</p>
<p>like you have hypoglycemia and the thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re missing is the more of that</p>
<p>dense</p>
<p>protein whether an egg or even an animal</p>
<p>protein now if you&rsquo;re a vegan I</p>
<p>understand that but it sounds like your</p>
<p>low blood sugar so when you go to low</p>
<p>carb and you don&rsquo;t have the right</p>
<p>proteins it&rsquo;s very hard to fix it so you</p>
<p>feel kind of like low blood blood sugar</p>
<p>in that and insulin resistance will</p>
<p>cause hypoglycemia</p>
<p>I would honestly go to my site in</p>
<p>a little booklet it&rsquo;s very inexpensive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy read that&rsquo;s kaha to burn</p>
<p>fat it gives you the basics of what to</p>
<p>eat and just read that you can read it</p>
<p>in probably an hour get all the basics</p>
<p>of what you need to fulfill not just the</p>
<p>nutrition but the macros as well so you</p>
<p>need the micronutrients and the</p>
<p>macronutrients in the right combination</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a real easy problem to</p>
<p>solve start watching more of my videos I</p>
<p>probably would do you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>fix the hypoglycemia so to do that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to do 5 6 small meals a day</p>
<p>you want to do start with 3 and then</p>
<p>eventually go down the 2 2 meals and I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;ll help you but you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to add more high-quality protein to</p>
<p>your meals and of course in fat because</p>
<p>the way you&rsquo;re doing it now</p>
<p>because the teeth one of the things this</p>
<p>protein will increase insulin a little</p>
<p>bit but it also stimulates an another</p>
<p>hormone called glucagon which actually</p>
<p>helps regulate your blood sugars to</p>
<p>between meals so you need to see more</p>
<p>protein so try that nega and I think I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re gonna get a lot of success</p>
<p>very fast you&rsquo;ll probably just feel</p>
<p>instantly better hey William you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Texas you had a question about keto and</p>
<p>elevated cholesterol hey good morning</p>
<p>doctor thank you so much for your work</p>
<p>sir um it&rsquo;s been a big impact in my life</p>
<p>so I did blood work a couple weeks ago</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the numbers the good news is my</p>
<p>triglycerides are low my overall</p>
<p>cholesterol number is 362 my LDL is 284</p>
<p>and my HDL is 58 my glycerides number</p>
<p>was 99 and what is it ok got it</p>
<p>alright so um how long you been on the</p>
<p>keto are you on the keto ok so yes yeah</p>
<p>I began looking at following you</p>
<p>December 1st last year ok and and so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been kind of process you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you know I was doing to kind of</p>
<p>like maybe like five days on 2 days off</p>
<p>and then say beginning in the summer</p>
<p>like no sugar like sugars gone</p>
<p>which i think what else to tell you are</p>
<p>you doing in a minute yes I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>do yes I&rsquo;m trying to do you know no more</p>
<p>than like two meals a day and also you</p>
<p>know observing your window like I say</p>
<p>you know start 11 so you know it may</p>
<p>have a good left and an early evening</p>
<p>meal I guess what I wanted to tell you</p>
<p>is I am consuming a lot of half-and-half</p>
<p>and heavy cream like in the morning I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have a couple shots of espresso and then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have like a cup or more of</p>
<p>half-and-half and heavy cream Wow all</p>
<p>organic so I&rsquo;m gonna try to figure out</p>
<p>what your recommendations would be so I</p>
<p>feel like I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m you know feel so much</p>
<p>healthier I&rsquo;ve lost 30 pounds that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>December December first I just wanted to</p>
<p>see what your what you would say about</p>
<p>those numbers okay great</p>
<p>I think overall I think you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>great and I the fact that the</p>
<p>triglycerides are going down means that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you could be less concerned about</p>
<p>cholesterol in fact that you should</p>
<p>watch that all the videos I have on</p>
<p>cholesterol because I explained there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two types of lvl one is the big fluffy</p>
<p>the other one is the small dense</p>
<p>particles and you you may just have as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing weight you&rsquo;re releasing</p>
<p>this cholesterol from the fat cells so</p>
<p>the LDLs are not going to be an issue</p>
<p>because you have to have that fat come</p>
<p>out of your fat cells and that might</p>
<p>just be totally normal especially if</p>
<p>your triglycerides are low the biggest</p>
<p>concern with cholesterol is if the</p>
<p>triglycerides are high but you&rsquo;re not I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think you can have a problem I</p>
<p>mean you know if you eventually can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get the cholesterol down then get a test</p>
<p>to see if it&rsquo;s not a genetic issue and</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a whole different topic but</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just try to maybe cut down</p>
<p>the heavy cream because even though it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably grass-fed it&rsquo;s probably organic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still pasteurized cream and</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s a lot of half-and-half or</p>
<p>a lot of cream to consume dairy I would</p>
<p>only recommend this a small that try to</p>
<p>get your fats from a different source</p>
<p>you can do it nuts peanut butter almond</p>
<p>butter avocado not as much there</p>
<p>you what happens to your cholesterol you</p>
<p>might do better on that it is true some</p>
<p>people do not respond as well on dairy</p>
<p>especially if they have a casein allergy</p>
<p>or a lactose problem and and then I have</p>
<p>them come off that and especially if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a diabetes type one or even type</p>
<p>two they don&rsquo;t do as well with dairy but</p>
<p>you can do some really good grass-fed</p>
<p>organic cheese that would be way better</p>
<p>than that cream so those are things I</p>
<p>would do watch all the cholesterol ones</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna probably find some</p>
<p>information that you needed to know</p>
<p>about alright thanks for your question</p>
<p>so then we now we have sue it&rsquo;s Sujata</p>
<p>from California you your mom&rsquo;s b12</p>
<p>levels are very high right yeah got it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re wondering what you can do</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m wondering if I should worry</p>
<p>about that girl yeah there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a test that I would do it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called MTHFR test a genetic test that</p>
<p>your mom may have a problem with some</p>
<p>genetic issue which relates to b12</p>
<p>folate folic acid things like that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to get too into it but I have</p>
<p>a video on that right down this these</p>
<p>words M th fr and write that down and go</p>
<p>ahead and watch my videos on that and</p>
<p>then you can actually get a genomic test</p>
<p>if your mom has that defect then she</p>
<p>needs to change some of the foods that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s consuming make sure there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>synthetic vitamins and then start taking</p>
<p>certain types of B vitamins that are a</p>
<p>little bit in a different form and that</p>
<p>could be the thing that&rsquo;s gonna actually</p>
<p>really help her that&rsquo;s the thing that</p>
<p>comes at self the top of my head so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most likely problem so go</p>
<p>ahead and try that and let me know how</p>
<p>you do hey Chris you&rsquo;re from Kansas City</p>
<p>you had a question about adrenal body</p>
<p>type and supplements yes sir thank you</p>
<p>for taking my car man I&rsquo;ve been watching</p>
<p>for a couple of months I love you and I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on keto for about two months</p>
<p>I ordered your adrenal pack I&rsquo;ve been on</p>
<p>it for about a week now I also ordered</p>
<p>the gall bladder formula and I also have</p>
<p>picked up milk thistle and so I&rsquo;m adding</p>
<p>this because I&rsquo;ve been suffering from</p>
<p>indigestion</p>
<p>lots of belching since I was about 17</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m 43</p>
<p>Wow so I was wondering um I was</p>
<p>wondering that full well for one I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had tremendous stress over those years</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been trying to lose weight</p>
<p>forever me and my wife have been doing</p>
<p>key talk about seven months we do a lot</p>
<p>of weight training mixed with a cardio</p>
<p>right now and I haven&rsquo;t dropped a lot of</p>
<p>weight but I&rsquo;ve been dropping body fat</p>
<p>percentage time and gaining a lot of</p>
<p>muscle um so my question is that how do</p>
<p>I know what taking the adrenal pack with</p>
<p>the gallbladder thing gallbladder pill</p>
<p>and also milk thistle how do I know</p>
<p>exactly what&rsquo;s working and also the keto</p>
<p>makes me a little bit have a little bit</p>
<p>more in a gesture which I think is the</p>
<p>fat I&rsquo;m sure um kind of what your</p>
<p>suggestion with that would already be in</p>
<p>on keto for a month yeah good question</p>
<p>are you doing in a minute fasting not</p>
<p>really I mean no I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t kind of</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t start eating until about</p>
<p>1:30 and afternoon we work out fasted</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m kind of eating until</p>
<p>about 11:00 cuz I&rsquo;m a musician so I&rsquo;m up</p>
<p>till 11:00 and 12:00 1:00 any morning</p>
<p>sometimes okay so Chris there&rsquo;s things</p>
<p>that are really really really important</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s stuff that&rsquo;s kind of lesser</p>
<p>important so I just want to talk about</p>
<p>the most important thing the adrenal</p>
<p>package is exactly what you need for the</p>
<p>stress so you could take those as</p>
<p>recommended</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something probably a little</p>
<p>more important to talk about you need</p>
<p>something that may not be get enough</p>
<p>supplements right now and that would be</p>
<p>the digestion formula which is the</p>
<p>absolute vinegar plus because that has</p>
<p>in it two things outside of vinegar</p>
<p>pills with betaine how to chloride in a</p>
<p>50/50 ratio you probably would benefit</p>
<p>from like like right now probably five</p>
<p>of those before a meal and the reason</p>
<p>for that is because</p>
<p>indigestion stomach problems are really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lack of pH and stress will</p>
<p>deplete that and over time as you age</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll go down that will give you the</p>
<p>most improvement you can&rsquo;t even release</p>
<p>bile without a strong acid in your</p>
<p>stomach so so you may or may not feel</p>
<p>better initially with the gallbladder so</p>
<p>you want to test it out but once you fix</p>
<p>the stomach you will but you want to</p>
<p>take the gallbladder after the meal and</p>
<p>in the meantime before you get that you</p>
<p>can take start taking more episode of</p>
<p>vinegar 2 tablespoons and some water</p>
<p>before each meal ok and then take one</p>
<p>before you go to bed that&rsquo;ll start to</p>
<p>acidify that stomach that&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>make them biggest difference ok that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>number one number two the intimate of</p>
<p>fasting is probably the biggest thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re missing now and the most</p>
<p>important thing that you want to plug</p>
<p>into this formula especially for you</p>
<p>because if you actually don&rsquo;t eat for a</p>
<p>period of time and you let&rsquo;s say you eat</p>
<p>at one a really good meal and then have</p>
<p>another one and that&rsquo;s it no snacks and</p>
<p>add more fat as needed you&rsquo;re gonna give</p>
<p>your system such a chance to drop that</p>
<p>insulin and lose so much more weight but</p>
<p>more important than that is to you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna give the gallbladder and your</p>
<p>digestion a sense to reset and rest and</p>
<p>recover just like you would if you</p>
<p>worked out and that&rsquo;s going to be the</p>
<p>your saving grace because that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to really help reset the digestion</p>
<p>because people that don&rsquo;t intermittent</p>
<p>fasting it just puts a lot of stress in</p>
<p>the digestion so it never really heals</p>
<p>and the gallbladder have a chance to</p>
<p>concentrate its bile so then when you do</p>
<p>eat boy you have all this amazing bile</p>
<p>to digest all those fats in that food so</p>
<p>simple problem bite the bullet focus on</p>
<p>the in a minute fasting within the next</p>
<p>month or so see if you can do gradually</p>
<p>just two meals and watch the</p>
<p>improvements gonna just be off the</p>
<p>charts alright good question hey Joe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Texas you had a question</p>
<p>about a few things go ahead you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>there I can&rsquo;t really see what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>asking but go ahead okay yes I had a</p>
<p>question about</p>
<p>HSD 1 &amp; 2 like if you got any</p>
<p>supplements I saw you had a video about</p>
<p>chia seed and and that</p>
<p>getting right there and I was wonder if</p>
<p>you could talk more about it and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>also taking l like L icing yeah laughing</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>now HSV what yeah that&rsquo;s the that herpes</p>
<p>employed Oh Oh got it yeah got it</p>
<p>okay good question so let&rsquo;s just talk</p>
<p>about the best thing for herpes well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really a viral thing so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple of things we talk about viruses</p>
<p>to put that virus back on the mission</p>
<p>the thing that just pops out right away</p>
<p>is the vitamin D so either Sun or</p>
<p>actually in a supplement d3 start taking</p>
<p>that d3 that&rsquo;s gonna actually put the</p>
<p>thing back in remission the other thing</p>
<p>is you need is trace minerals there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>plant-based trace minerals that you can</p>
<p>get that you take in liquid and you</p>
<p>start consuming that that&rsquo;ll help this</p>
<p>virus to and then in addition on top of</p>
<p>that you need to do all the recommend</p>
<p>recommendations that I&rsquo;m recommending</p>
<p>with keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to lower your</p>
<p>insulin that&rsquo;s going to keep your virus</p>
<p>in check you can&rsquo;t kill a virus so you</p>
<p>all you can do is keep it in remission</p>
<p>so you al licensing is okay but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>nearly as powerful as keeping your</p>
<p>insulin low doing the keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting which is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about today and I think</p>
<p>that will protect you so thing about</p>
<p>viruses is long stay healthy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be fine so your goal is just to be</p>
<p>super healthy thanks Joe so mark you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Kentucky you had a question your</p>
<p>grandmother wants to get off this</p>
<p>warfarin or coumadin yes sir and this</p>
<p>was David you&rsquo;ve been a huge impact on</p>
<p>myself but my entire family I&rsquo;m mean my</p>
<p>girlfriend my mother my father all of</p>
<p>our friends my dream is that all of us</p>
<p>have been following you for probably the</p>
<p>last eight months awesome and we&rsquo;ve all</p>
<p>seen wonderful wonderful results my</p>
<p>mother is completely off diabat√©</p>
<p>diabetes medication she just stopped</p>
<p>probably three weeks ago and has not had</p>
<p>to take a drop of insulin sets</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s great though really really</p>
<p>amazing stuff but my grandmother her</p>
<p>doctor keeps going back and forth with</p>
<p>her</p>
<p>about her blood thickness you know she</p>
<p>has to go once a week if it&rsquo;s too thick</p>
<p>if it gets better because she increases</p>
<p>her apple cider vinegar intake then they</p>
<p>say all will you boy it&rsquo;s great you can</p>
<p>eat you know or you can we can drop this</p>
<p>back a little bit but she loves salads</p>
<p>and we want the you know more salads and</p>
<p>I keep telling my grandmother you need</p>
<p>the nutrition from all of your greens</p>
<p>but her doctors just adamantly opposed</p>
<p>about her taking in what would be good</p>
<p>for her so that they can continue to</p>
<p>keep her on warfarin so she&rsquo;s taken</p>
<p>probably about ten tablespoons of</p>
<p>vinegar per day to try and kill what the</p>
<p>warfarin but because she has that leaky</p>
<p>valve and the prolapsed heart she needs</p>
<p>that she needs to do something different</p>
<p>so I was wondering do you have a</p>
<p>recommendation so that we can finally</p>
<p>get her off this warfarin yeah good</p>
<p>question first thing I&rsquo;ll make a little</p>
<p>disclaimer anything I say is for</p>
<p>educational purpose check with your</p>
<p>doctor before taking my recommendations</p>
<p>okay got the other way now let me just</p>
<p>give you some education to something to</p>
<p>research I recently did a video I did</p>
<p>release it on vitamin B for you should</p>
<p>watch that that that&rsquo;s a nutritional</p>
<p>yeast and that actually helps tone the</p>
<p>heart and helps with murmurs and helps</p>
<p>leaky valves and things like that</p>
<p>most people are taking the coumadin to</p>
<p>thin the blood it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like a rat</p>
<p>poison kills kills rats but they it</p>
<p>blocks the clotting factors which is</p>
<p>vitamin K okay and then what happens is</p>
<p>that usually you take it if you have</p>
<p>atrial fibrillation because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to develop a clot you should also</p>
<p>watch the recent video on preventing TI</p>
<p>a because I talked about the nutrition</p>
<p>that will help with that I think if we</p>
<p>go deeper you need to focus on the real</p>
<p>reason why she has a leaky valve and</p>
<p>that would be the B vitamins so yes</p>
<p>absolute vinegar is important but</p>
<p>probably more important is nutritional</p>
<p>yeast that&rsquo;s the thing that I would</p>
<p>recommend nutritional yeast so you get</p>
<p>the B vitamins to help that area the</p>
<p>other thing was far as thinning the</p>
<p>blood naturally vitamin E will do it on</p>
<p>natural vitamin E okay and the fish oils</p>
<p>of real good version</p>
<p>liver wealth not yea cod liver oil</p>
<p>virgin color oil that would actually be</p>
<p>very good to thin the blood so those are</p>
<p>all things that you can look at and in</p>
<p>the meantime for vegetables I did a</p>
<p>video on kuma Tim you and I actually</p>
<p>gave a list of all the vegetables that</p>
<p>she can have like yellow vegetables and</p>
<p>orange so you can have more of those</p>
<p>right now make a salad out of that and I</p>
<p>think that would actually help her as</p>
<p>the transition to kind of correct the</p>
<p>initial reason why she needs she&rsquo;s on in</p>
<p>the first place okay</p>
<p>alright cool hey Nick you&rsquo;re from Texas</p>
<p>you had a question yes sir and like</p>
<p>everyone else I want to start by saying</p>
<p>thank you I mean I&rsquo;ve been doing this</p>
<p>for about two months the Kyodai and</p>
<p>without your information I mean I would</p>
<p>not be here League where I&rsquo;m at right</p>
<p>now so really think awesome thank you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost unfortunately Nick you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breaking up I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening</p>
<p>but I tell you what Nick maybe you can</p>
<p>email me that question at dr. Berg at</p>
<p>dr. Berg</p>
<p>dr. dr b ER g { dr b ER g calm</p>
<p>unfortunately you&rsquo;re breaking up and i</p>
<p>wanted to hear that question but i think</p>
<p>it has something to do with keto diet</p>
<p>and too much protein so so let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just gonna guess at what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>asking and then i&rsquo;m gonna go to the</p>
<p>board and i&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>protein in general in fact let me just</p>
<p>go to the board and talk about that now</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;ll actually help</p>
<p>alright</p>
<p>so too much protein so there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>points on protein that you need to know</p>
<p>we have the amount of protein so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to go more than six three to</p>
<p>six ounces and the reason for that is</p>
<p>that anything more will spike insulin</p>
<p>okay so we want the quality but people</p>
<p>are concerned about well I need to keep</p>
<p>my muscle mass I need to</p>
<p>this well did you realize that the</p>
<p>mineral that actually will help your</p>
<p>muscles be retained and grow because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not just talking about becoming</p>
<p>bodybuilders but I&rsquo;m talking about like</p>
<p>if you have atrophy let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>menopausal and you have atrophy of the</p>
<p>muscles like your female or men and you</p>
<p>want to get this muscle back this</p>
<p>collagen not just muscle but all</p>
<p>proteins hair nail skin ligaments the</p>
<p>main thing that people need is potassium</p>
<p>if your potassium deficient you cannot</p>
<p>make your muscles grow okay you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t be able to get you know big if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to actually get more</p>
<p>muscle mass and you won&rsquo;t be able to get</p>
<p>rid of the atrophy so all of these like</p>
<p>athletes that are especially</p>
<p>bodybuilders are taking all this protein</p>
<p>like massive quantities of protein and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a new potassium they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get anywhere so potassium acta is</p>
<p>involved in almost every single enzyme</p>
<p>of protein synthesis where you take</p>
<p>amino acids into protein so we need</p>
<p>potassium and that and then secondly</p>
<p>look at this we got the we have insulin</p>
<p>is the key here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the door</p>
<p>insulin is a key that controls protein</p>
<p>in the cells so without insulin you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get protein in the cells to make</p>
<p>body tissues and protein so if you have</p>
<p>instant resistance pre-diabetic like</p>
<p>most people you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have a protein problem so to lower the</p>
<p>need for insulin to fix instant</p>
<p>resistance guess what you need potassium</p>
<p>interesting so you need forty seven</p>
<p>hundred milligrams now if you&rsquo;re a you</p>
<p>have rheumatoid arthritis or you have</p>
<p>really bad adrenals or some type of</p>
<p>inflammatory condition</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need price 6,000 milligrams</p>
<p>okay and bananas don&rsquo;t cut it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to get them from vegetables</p>
<p>so even at some vegetables even if you</p>
<p>did six or seven to ten</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still not you&rsquo;re still gonna be</p>
<p>short of potassium unless you have real</p>
<p>quality vegetables avocados beet leaves</p>
<p>kale things like that and that&rsquo;s why I</p>
<p>was recommend a couple times a week you</p>
<p>know do your kale shake with a lot of</p>
<p>these other greens in there put the</p>
<p>other greens in there don&rsquo;t just have</p>
<p>like a low quality like a Caesar salad</p>
<p>type you know iceberg lettuce or just</p>
<p>romaine you need like a lot of other</p>
<p>stuff in there so we need a lot of</p>
<p>vegetables and you can even enhance that</p>
<p>with electrolyte powder I have a really</p>
<p>good electrolyte power just with</p>
<p>potassium citrate there&rsquo;s a thousand</p>
<p>milligrams per serving you can add that</p>
<p>in there just to put the icing on the</p>
<p>cake don&rsquo;t talk about icing so so we</p>
<p>have that okay then we have certain the</p>
<p>hormones that are involved in protein</p>
<p>synthesis we have growth hormone we have</p>
<p>glucagon growth hormone is the</p>
<p>anti-aging hormone it is the hormone</p>
<p>that preserves your muscle protein and</p>
<p>all your protein and so the goal is how</p>
<p>do we trigger growth hormone well heavy</p>
<p>exercise short duration high intensity</p>
<p>okay exercise sleep we&rsquo;ll do it in a</p>
<p>minute fasting we&rsquo;ll do it</p>
<p>lowering your stress we&rsquo;ll do it okay</p>
<p>glucagon will also be triggered by heavy</p>
<p>exercise and in a minute fasting as well</p>
<p>and moderate amount of protein so we</p>
<p>need that moderate amount of protein we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want too much so we have the the</p>
<p>diet but you know you may find that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consuming enough potassium in</p>
<p>your diet but your stomach acids are low</p>
<p>so you might have low acid as you age</p>
<p>you decrease your stomach acid and then</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t absorb the potassium the</p>
<p>minerals and you can&rsquo;t break down</p>
<p>protein so that could be another common</p>
<p>cause especially some of the callers</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re talking about they have</p>
<p>heartburn indigestion I think they have</p>
<p>low stomach acids and so even if you</p>
<p>have an ulcer</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve still low stomach acids we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to add acid in there at first we</p>
<p>have to heal it then we need to</p>
<p>recertify so you can start absorbing</p>
<p>protein and minerals okay another common</p>
<p>cause of potassium deficiency is</p>
<p>diuretics especially thiazide thiazide</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a diuretic basically will</p>
<p>deplete your electrolytes specifically</p>
<p>potassium and people take diuretics to</p>
<p>lower blood pressure well guess what if</p>
<p>you deplete your potassium gessie you</p>
<p>end up with high blood pressure because</p>
<p>potassium lowers blood pressure okay</p>
<p>does that make sense alright let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back here I just wanted to kind of cover</p>
<p>some things there and come right back</p>
<p>here so Jennifer you had a question</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from South actually South Dakota</p>
<p>you had a question in Quito and body</p>
<p>odor go ahead hi yes um thank you for</p>
<p>taking my call I believed I had</p>
<p>struggled with insulin resistance and</p>
<p>finally had the lab work done a couple</p>
<p>months ago that confirmed it and one</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;ve noticed over the last couple</p>
<p>of years particularly as I sit at my</p>
<p>office by the end of the day and over</p>
<p>the last several months I&rsquo;ve noticed an</p>
<p>increase in body odor I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>notice it at home or while I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>activity it&rsquo;s just at the office and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s embarrassing because I I deal with</p>
<p>the public and a lot of people yeah okay</p>
<p>okay so there&rsquo;s a couple things that you</p>
<p>want to make sure of in and out of all</p>
<p>the things I&rsquo;m going to talk about some</p>
<p>of these might not apply but just these</p>
<p>are potential reasons you have body odor</p>
<p>in the transition in the key to</p>
<p>adaptation to burning fat there will be</p>
<p>some release of ketones in the urine and</p>
<p>other parts of your body that could be</p>
<p>coming out and that means that the</p>
<p>ketones sometimes have a certain odor to</p>
<p>them that could be one thing computing</p>
<p>the breath or whatever but that&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>an Aikido adaptation as you do keto for</p>
<p>a period of time that goes away because</p>
<p>you start becoming more efficient you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning of all the ketones so the odor</p>
<p>goes away but in the transition that</p>
<p>might be the fact so you have to be</p>
<p>careful about too consuming</p>
<p>too much protein okay that&rsquo;s number one</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t have any more than you know six</p>
<p>ounces you might even do better with</p>
<p>five ounces or even four ounces so just</p>
<p>check that and then the other thing is</p>
<p>you want to start increasing the</p>
<p>quantity of vegetables to the diet to</p>
<p>start countering some of the waste</p>
<p>product from the ketogenic diet it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>different different waste product so</p>
<p>start beefing up that and then the other</p>
<p>thing that I would recommend is kind of</p>
<p>double or triple the dosage of the</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder and the reason</p>
<p>for that is it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>deodorizer it&rsquo;s a good cleaner and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of chlorophyll and that is</p>
<p>the thing that you need to kind of</p>
<p>counter that odor I just did a video I</p>
<p>think it was like stinky your hand but</p>
<p>you can actually watch that because that</p>
<p>would also apply to the odor but you</p>
<p>really need to kind of adjust what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s either you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing too much too much fat or too much</p>
<p>protein okay so lower that and increase</p>
<p>more vegetable and until that odor goes</p>
<p>away thanks for your question Jennifer</p>
<p>hey Greg you are from Virginia</p>
<p>go ahead you had a question about</p>
<p>something yes I had a question about</p>
<p>pyro knees disease I was wondering can</p>
<p>you tell me the the plaque of the</p>
<p>fibrous tissue that builds up in the</p>
<p>penis area is that something that can be</p>
<p>resolved without having an operation</p>
<p>yeah honestly Greg yeah I&rsquo;ve never I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough experience to tell you</p>
<p>how to address that honestly but I can</p>
<p>just tell you offhand plaquing in</p>
<p>general is usually a protein issue a</p>
<p>fibrous issue and so it may not pertain</p>
<p>to your problem but in general there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of fibrous tissue extra protein</p>
<p>plaquing that can grow in different</p>
<p>parts of the body and the absolute best</p>
<p>remedy for that is an enzyme called</p>
<p>sarah pep taste you can look it up you</p>
<p>want to get it in at least a hundred and</p>
<p>fifty thousand I use taking an empty</p>
<p>stomach and that&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>things to kind of clean up and remove</p>
<p>fibers plaquing throughout any part of</p>
<p>the body that shouldn&rsquo;t be there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great for cirrhosis as well okay Greg</p>
<p>thanks for your question then we have</p>
<p>another question from pansy no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually yeah how are you okay so you</p>
<p>have a teat of flu okay you said you had</p>
<p>keto flu no no I have a benefit for</p>
<p>belly fat got it yes and I tried to do a</p>
<p>ketogenic diet mm-hmm but it makes me</p>
<p>more okay got it</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>about the keto</p>
<p>honestly that keto is one tool to use to</p>
<p>help weight loss because you&rsquo;re lowering</p>
<p>carbs and that&rsquo;s really good and some</p>
<p>people get great results from that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other tools that you can use one</p>
<p>is in a minute fasting so I would go for</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s even a more powerful tool</p>
<p>than keto so I would go to three meals</p>
<p>no snacks</p>
<p>two meals no snacks and maybe even one</p>
<p>meal if you can do it if you really have</p>
<p>a slow metabolism the other tool that</p>
<p>you can add to it is addressing the</p>
<p>eating plan based on your body type in</p>
<p>the new book I&rsquo;m releasing I actually</p>
<p>even talked about that so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>combining a bunch of strategies it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>combination of powerful strategies that</p>
<p>help people get healthy</p>
<p>versus why why just use one and then we</p>
<p>can add high-intensity interval training</p>
<p>as another tool to get healthy we can</p>
<p>also provide all the nutrients for your</p>
<p>basic requirements that&rsquo;s another tool</p>
<p>we can also get rid of body problems</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another tool but for you I think</p>
<p>I would focus on the intermittent</p>
<p>fasting because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing and that would take you to the</p>
<p>next level especially if you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to lose belly fat because that if you</p>
<p>have belly fat all that means is you</p>
<p>have too much insulin okay and you get</p>
<p>to drop it in a minute fasting is the</p>
<p>most powerful tool but thanks for thanks</p>
<p>for calling okay so now we have another</p>
<p>question from Jaron from Tennessee you</p>
<p>had a question</p>
<p>electrolyte formula question oh yeah</p>
<p>yeah no you let you like that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have caffeine in oh good question</p>
<p>absolutely not in fact that&rsquo;s it you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s so many drinks out there</p>
<p>these energy drinks 5-hour energy drinks</p>
<p>which has liked between</p>
<p>215 245 milligrams of caffeine I mean to</p>
<p>caffeine alone will rev up your adrenals</p>
<p>and create all sorts of problems since</p>
<p>you have the monster drinks and all</p>
<p>these other things so no mind it has no</p>
<p>caffeine and there&rsquo;s no sugar and it</p>
<p>also has no multo dextran which is has</p>
<p>the highest glycemic index of anything</p>
<p>so I had the pariah to make sure that I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s such a routine thing that</p>
<p>manufacturing companies use in formulas</p>
<p>that I had to say no I don&rsquo;t want any of</p>
<p>that crap so it&rsquo;s a you&rsquo;re just getting</p>
<p>these minerals in a good form its flavor</p>
<p>with stevia okay which is totally fine</p>
<p>and a little natural flavoring which is</p>
<p>awesome</p>
<p>so when you take it you&rsquo;ll actually you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t have any like weird after case or</p>
<p>anything like that so it&rsquo;s very good</p>
<p>tasting so good question</p>
<p>hey Muhammad you&rsquo;re from your on the air</p>
<p>you had a question about keto and liver</p>
<p>enzymes you&rsquo;re from Kuwait yeah doctor</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following you and your videos</p>
<p>really great two weeks two years ago I</p>
<p>was really informed and I lost a lot of</p>
<p>weight and family reunions weddings etc</p>
<p>just got me back on it again am I on my</p>
<p>carbs it&rsquo;s been about a year again and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard for me I see it very</p>
<p>hard to get back on keto this is number</p>
<p>one number two I have been propagating</p>
<p>about the keto diet to my friends to</p>
<p>families and to extended people that I</p>
<p>meet in general and I have been telling</p>
<p>them about this and there are some</p>
<p>people with medical background they do</p>
<p>stop me tell me what about your liver</p>
<p>enzymes would have you checked your</p>
<p>liver enzymes so I&rsquo;m really confused and</p>
<p>I just recently watch your video about</p>
<p>the video on I&rsquo;m sorry the yeah your</p>
<p>video on what the heck or what what the</p>
<p>hell about the hell food and that&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re promoting</p>
<p>surprisingly promoting things like carbs</p>
<p>are not not you have carbs are good for</p>
<p>you and and other and fat fat are bad so</p>
<p>just want some insight and what to what</p>
<p>do they mean when they mean to saying</p>
<p>liver enzymes and and how am I supposed</p>
<p>to test for liver enzymes over here yeah</p>
<p>good question you yeah</p>
<p>so first of all I will guarantee that</p>
<p>whoever said that doesn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>keto what their what they&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re mixing up or confusing the keto</p>
<p>diet with another condition called</p>
<p>ketoacidosis which is a diabetic type</p>
<p>one problem you don&rsquo;t have diabetes type</p>
<p>one so you can do nutritional ketosis</p>
<p>very healthily and not have any issues</p>
<p>keto diet takes stress off the liver</p>
<p>okay especially if you&rsquo;re doing and like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying with all the vegetables so</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t understand it so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>when you get opinions from people who</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand something or are not</p>
<p>expert in it you&rsquo;re gonna get the most</p>
<p>wild opinions it&rsquo;s kind of like going to</p>
<p>a medical doctor for nutrition advice</p>
<p>well do they have any training at all</p>
<p>well their biochemistry training but not</p>
<p>in the area of nutrition they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>it especially with these diets too so</p>
<p>go to them for medical conditions but</p>
<p>when you go into Quito I wouldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>bring it up because they&rsquo;re gonna just</p>
<p>give you their confusions on what they</p>
<p>think it is and how bad it is and</p>
<p>whatever I mean think about it if</p>
<p>everyone went on keto and in a minute</p>
<p>fasting and start losing weight and got</p>
<p>off their medication guess who&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>lose a lot of money the pharmaceutical</p>
<p>companies the food manufacturing</p>
<p>companies so you really have to get your</p>
<p>own first-hand knowledge not secondhand</p>
<p>from someone who doesn&rsquo;t even understand</p>
<p>it but the bottom line it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>thing for your liver because it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually stripping fat off the liver</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re improving enzymes you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>off sugar I mean just let&rsquo;s take the</p>
<p>opposite let&rsquo;s take a diabetic who has</p>
<p>is living off of sugar fuel look what</p>
<p>happens to their liver fatty liver look</p>
<p>what happens their kidney they end up</p>
<p>with a dialysis so again it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>someone that you it&rsquo;s like you can take</p>
<p>it with a grain of salt they don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>understand in fact what I like to do is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to say okay so what part of the</p>
<p>keto diet will affect the liver</p>
<p>negatively what what&rsquo;s the function of</p>
<p>insulin you&rsquo;re gonna find out some of</p>
<p>these experts don&rsquo;t even know what it is</p>
<p>now that documentary on what the health</p>
<p>is complete utter BS because what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about is the you can you</p>
<p>can eat sugar you can have sugar in fact</p>
<p>you can improve diabetes with eating</p>
<p>sugar I&rsquo;m like what what planet are you</p>
<p>living and it&rsquo;s absolutely not true and</p>
<p>so if that&rsquo;s true then everyone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eating sugar that should keep eating</p>
<p>sugar because can improve your diabetes</p>
<p>and come off the saturated fats that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m doing live Skype calls with all</p>
<p>these people that do this eating plan</p>
<p>and you can see what happens to their</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s their cholesterol their</p>
<p>diet I mean I&rsquo;m getting tons of them and</p>
<p>you can watch them and some people say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s anecdotal these are real people</p>
<p>you know versus a study I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>get into the study wars with people</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not even interested in</p>
<p>listening to opposing sides they already</p>
<p>have their mind made up so honestly I</p>
<p>would only bring this up with people</p>
<p>that are willing to learn something new</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have fixed</p>
<p>the ideas alright hope that helped okay</p>
<p>then Yvonne you&rsquo;re from Texas you had a</p>
<p>question you&rsquo;re our last caller good</p>
<p>well my question is I have atrial</p>
<p>fibrillation and I was just wondering I</p>
<p>hate this medication that the doctor has</p>
<p>me on for this I was just wondering if</p>
<p>it was something else I could do to</p>
<p>improve this or to get off this</p>
<p>medication because I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting now for about two</p>
<p>months and I feel great the only</p>
<p>medication I have is for this a fib is</p>
<p>there anything that I could do to help</p>
<p>this along yeah good question the</p>
<p>research that you want to go into to</p>
<p>study more to get more knowledge on is</p>
<p>electrolytes and specifically potassium</p>
<p>and even magnesium but mainly potassium</p>
<p>and atrial fib there&rsquo;s a lot of research</p>
<p>done by the medical community on this</p>
<p>and just increasing more potassium to</p>
<p>correct atrial fib I mean think about</p>
<p>what the electrolytes do they support</p>
<p>the nerve and muscles okay now the</p>
<p>pacemaker of the heart that controls the</p>
<p>rhythm of the heart the muscle of the</p>
<p>heart will fibrillate when it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have electrolytes specifically potassium</p>
<p>so we need so much potassium and it&rsquo;s if</p>
<p>you go to the doctor and get your</p>
<p>potassium checked and it comes out</p>
<p>normal they&rsquo;re just checking the</p>
<p>potassium in the blood</p>
<p>normally 98% of all potassium is in the</p>
<p>south&rsquo;s not the blood so unless you do</p>
<p>an intracellular potassium test you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never see these deficiencies so you can</p>
<p>get in or sell your potassium test if</p>
<p>you want just to confirm that and show</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re low or you can just start</p>
<p>taking more potassium a lot more</p>
<p>vegetables and that eventually will</p>
<p>improve that but that&rsquo;s there you want</p>
<p>to go there&rsquo;s even some great books on</p>
<p>atrial fib and potassium that I would go</p>
<p>into studying that till eventually you</p>
<p>can come off that stuff hey guys you</p>
<p>guys had some wonderful questions I I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>excited about you know your interest and</p>
<p>your great</p>
<p>compliments I want to thank you so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing a convention for the next few</p>
<p>weeks so until then keep watching my</p>
<p>videos because I&rsquo;ll release two a day</p>
<p>and have a wonderful weekend thanks</p>
