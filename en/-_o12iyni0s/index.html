terrible sugar cravings and you&amp;rsquo;re not on keto get on keto if you&amp;rsquo;re new to my channel very simply click the link down below and it&amp;rsquo;ll show you exactly what to do with the keto plan that will get rid of your sugar cravings but let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you have terrible sugar cravings that means there&amp;rsquo;s something seriously wrong because the way that you know you&amp;rsquo;re in ketosis which ketones are the byproduct of fat burning is that your cravings go away and you&amp;rsquo;re no longer hungry so there&amp;rsquo;s a couple things that could be going on if you&amp;rsquo;re on certain medications for example like prednisone or anti-inflammatory or anti-depression medication or antibiotics these can all increase cravings because they worsen your blood sugars also if you&amp;rsquo;re under a lot of stress that can do it as well or you have lack of sleep or even if you had an injury that can increase cravings i&amp;rsquo;ll give you an example i was riding my bike up a bridge and the pedal actually jammed i went over the handlebars i landed on my elbow i actually fractured my elbow in 30 different pieces and what was interesting well wasn&amp;rsquo;t interesting it was very very painful but what was interesting about is i started craving sugar very quick like i just needed some sugar because it dropped my blood sugars it crashed it way way down because in the spike of cortisol which is a stress hormone it just went up and my blood sugars went down all right so let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at potentially what you might be doing incorrectly so the first question is are you keeping your carbs between 20 and 50 grams maybe you should start counting them and measuring them but here&amp;rsquo;s some mistakes about this 20 to 50 grams you are allowing carbs that are very high in the glycemic index like straight sugar or dextrose or maltodextrin you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that you want to avoid all carbs when we actually are talking about 20 to 50 grams of carbs we&amp;rsquo;re talking about not sugar carbs we&amp;rsquo;re talking about because you should avoid all those completely we&amp;rsquo;re talking about like the carbs from berries the carbs from nuts which are small amounts that&amp;rsquo;s the type of carbs we&amp;rsquo;re talking about maybe the carbs that are in a hummus for example but not vegetables so if you&amp;rsquo;re consuming carbs that are high in the glycemic index like sugar and things like that yet it&amp;rsquo;s still within this range you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get into ketosis because it&amp;rsquo;s going to keep elevating your um insulin which is going to keep you from tapping in the fat all right second problem is you&amp;rsquo;re eating too frequently you&amp;rsquo;re not doing fasting you might be snacking in between the meals remember eating makes you hungry so the goal is to eat nothing to go longer sometimes a little apple cider vinegar and water will help reduce hunger that&amp;rsquo;s a little tip there but whatever you&amp;rsquo;re doing as far as the frequency of meals you need to make it longer and the way that you do that is you add more fat to the meal to go longer that&amp;rsquo;s going to drop insulin and it&amp;rsquo;s going to get you into ketosis more and the more ketosis that you&amp;rsquo;re in the less the cravings this should happen within three days if you have very severe blood sugar issues it could take up to five days but it will happen if you keep the carbs down and you fast longer and i&amp;rsquo;m talking about like two meals a day that would be perfect like maybe your first meal is at 12 and your next one is at six you should be fine the last thing and i think this is very important as well consuming enough vegetables so a lot of times when people are in keto it says to do low carb and vegetables are carbs so i&amp;rsquo;m just going to cut those out or they might just have like one little tiny cup well in these vegetables you have some key nutrients a lot of nutrients you have potassium you have magnesium and plus the fiber from the vegetable is fed to the microbe in your gut which then releases something called butyrate and butyrate is very helpful in balancing your blood sugars and giving your cells energy so you&amp;rsquo;ll find that if you include this right here it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a lot easier you&amp;rsquo;re going to be less hungry you&amp;rsquo;re going to be more satisfied and definitely less cravings because even when you take potassium magnesium that alone decreases sugar cravings now last point i want to bring up is very important when you do keto without doing intermittent fasting let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re having snacks with the meal but it&amp;rsquo;s keto friendly i found that you don&amp;rsquo;t really see the benefits many times you might not lose hardly any weight why because every time you eat you stimulate insulin and we&amp;rsquo;re trying to keep insulin lower so i highly recommend you don&amp;rsquo;t do that you do keto with fasting and then some other people do fasting but they eat whatever they want okay so that&amp;rsquo;s not good either because if you&amp;rsquo;re eating junk food sugar high carbs that is going to reduce your ability to see the benefits from fasting greatly okay so you want to do them both together all right so those solutions should fix your cravings before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&amp;rsquo;s call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some

you&rsquo;re not on keto get on keto if you&rsquo;re new to  </p><p>my channel very simply click the link down 
below and it&rsquo;ll show you exactly what to do  </p><p>with the keto plan that will get rid of 
your sugar cravings but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re  </p><p>on keto and you have terrible sugar cravings 
that means there&rsquo;s something seriously wrong  </p><p>because the way that you know you&rsquo;re in ketosis 
which ketones are the byproduct of fat burning  </p><p>is that your cravings go away and you&rsquo;re no 
longer hungry so there&rsquo;s a couple things that  </p><p>could be going on if you&rsquo;re on certain 
medications for example like prednisone  </p><p>or anti-inflammatory or anti-depression 
medication or antibiotics these can all  </p><p>increase cravings because they worsen your blood 
sugars also if you&rsquo;re under a lot of stress  </p><p>that can do it as well or you have lack of sleep 
or even if you had an injury that can increase  </p><p>cravings i&rsquo;ll give you an example i was riding my 
bike up a bridge and the pedal actually jammed i  </p><p>went over the handlebars i landed on my elbow i 
actually fractured my elbow in 30 different pieces  </p><p>and what was interesting well wasn&rsquo;t interesting 
it was very very painful but what was interesting  </p><p>about is i started craving sugar very quick like 
i just needed some sugar because it dropped my  </p><p>blood sugars it crashed it way way down because 
in the spike of cortisol which is a stress hormone  </p><p>it just went up and my blood sugars went 
down all right so let&rsquo;s take a look at  </p><p>potentially what you might be doing incorrectly so 
the first question is are you keeping your carbs  </p><p>between 20 and 50 grams maybe you should 
start counting them and measuring them  </p><p>but here&rsquo;s some mistakes about this 
20 to 50 grams you are allowing carbs  </p><p>that are very high in the glycemic index like 
straight sugar or dextrose or maltodextrin  </p><p>you don&rsquo;t want to do that 
you want to avoid all carbs  </p><p>when we actually are talking about 20 to 50 grams 
of carbs we&rsquo;re talking about not sugar carbs we&rsquo;re  </p><p>talking about because you should avoid all those 
completely we&rsquo;re talking about like the carbs from  </p><p>berries the carbs from nuts which are small 
amounts that&rsquo;s the type of carbs we&rsquo;re talking  </p><p>about maybe the carbs that are in a hummus 
for example but not vegetables so if you&rsquo;re  </p><p>consuming carbs that are high in the glycemic 
index like sugar and things like that yet it&rsquo;s  </p><p>still within this range you&rsquo;re not going to get 
into ketosis because it&rsquo;s going to keep elevating  </p><p>your um insulin which is going to keep you from 
tapping in the fat all right second problem  </p><p>is you&rsquo;re eating too frequently you&rsquo;re not doing 
fasting you might be snacking in between the meals  </p><p>remember eating makes you hungry so the goal 
is to eat nothing to go longer sometimes a  </p><p>little apple cider vinegar and water will help 
reduce hunger that&rsquo;s a little tip there but  </p><p>whatever you&rsquo;re doing as far as the frequency of 
meals you need to make it longer and the way that  </p><p>you do that is you add more fat to the meal to go 
longer that&rsquo;s going to drop insulin and it&rsquo;s going  </p><p>to get you into ketosis more and the more ketosis 
that you&rsquo;re in the less the cravings this should  </p><p>happen within three days if you have very severe 
blood sugar issues it could take up to five days  </p><p>but it will happen if you keep the carbs down 
and you fast longer and i&rsquo;m talking about like  </p><p>two meals a day that would be perfect like maybe 
your first meal is at 12 and your next one is at  </p><p>six you should be fine the last thing and 
i think this is very important as well  </p><p>consuming enough vegetables so a 
lot of times when people are in keto  </p><p>it says to do low carb and vegetables are carbs 
so i&rsquo;m just going to cut those out or they might  </p><p>just have like one little tiny cup well in 
these vegetables you have some key nutrients  </p><p>a lot of nutrients you have potassium you have 
magnesium and plus the fiber from the vegetable  </p><p>is fed to the microbe in your gut which then 
releases something called butyrate and butyrate is  </p><p>very helpful in balancing your blood sugars and 
giving your cells energy so you&rsquo;ll find that if  </p><p>you include this right here it&rsquo;s going to be 
a lot easier you&rsquo;re going to be less hungry  </p><p>you&rsquo;re going to be more satisfied and definitely 
less cravings because even when you take potassium  </p><p>magnesium that alone decreases sugar cravings now 
last point i want to bring up is very important  </p><p>when you do keto without doing intermittent 
fasting let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re having snacks with  </p><p>the meal but it&rsquo;s keto friendly i found 
that you don&rsquo;t really see the benefits  </p><p>many times you might not lose hardly any weight 
why because every time you eat you stimulate  </p><p>insulin and we&rsquo;re trying to keep insulin lower 
so i highly recommend you don&rsquo;t do that you do  </p><p>keto with fasting and then some other people 
do fasting but they eat whatever they want  </p><p>okay so that&rsquo;s not good either because if you&rsquo;re 
eating junk food sugar high carbs that is going  </p><p>to reduce your ability to see the benefits from 
fasting greatly okay so you want to do them both  </p><p>together all right so those solutions should fix 
your cravings before you go if you have a question  </p><p>about a product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want 
to know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and  </p><p>you need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth 
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you  </p><p>this is just for the people in the US 
hopefully in the future we&rsquo;ll be able  </p><p>to answer everyone&rsquo;s call but i put the number 
down below so you can call and get some help</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
