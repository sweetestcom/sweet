    <p>Higher Ground and Audible Originals present</p>
<p>The Light Podcast with Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>Okay, I am so happy to be here today.</p>
<p>And we are gonna talk about the light we carry.</p>
<p>All right, so y&rsquo;all, you know the people who,</p>
<p>when they walk into the room, it lights up?</p>
<p>You walk in the room and the lights go on.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s bright, sometimes it&rsquo;s soft.</p>
<p>But I was just backstage talking to one</p>
<p>of the brightest lights I have ever met.</p>
<p>Mrs. Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>Hi everyone, this is Michelle Obama,</p>
<p>and I am thrilled to welcome you to the very first episode</p>
<p>of my new podcast called The Light.</p>
<p>Like so many of you over the past couple of years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sometimes felt isolated, disconnected, and discouraged.</p>
<p>So much of our lives were thrown up in the air.</p>
<p>Our daily rhythms were stopped.</p>
<p>We were pulled apart from one another,</p>
<p>and we were left to put the pieces back together alone.</p>
<p>The conversations in this podcast are about the ways</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to regain my footing,</p>
<p>to reconnect with the people</p>
<p>and the practices that keep me afloat.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be exploring the topics and questions</p>
<p>that so many of us are wrestling with.</p>
<p>Questions like, how do we overcome fear?</p>
<p>How do we connect with others</p>
<p>when it feels like folks are drifting apart?</p>
<p>How do we build ourselves up</p>
<p>in a world that wants to tear us down?</p>
<p>I know there aren&rsquo;t neat solutions to any of this.</p>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules</p>
<p>that apply to everyone or every situation.</p>
<p>But over the course of my life,</p>
<p>I found a few tools and attitudes</p>
<p>that stand the test of time,</p>
<p>principles that keep me balanced.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so excited to dive into them with all of you.</p>
<p>To help me along the way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be bringing some friends from my book tour along.</p>
<p>Some are folks you might know on a first name basis,</p>
<p>Conan, Ellen, Oprah.</p>
<p>Others are longtime friends of mine,</p>
<p>like Elizabeth Alexander and Gayle King.</p>
<p>And in these conversations,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be discussing everything from friendship</p>
<p>to raising good kids to going high</p>
<p>when other folks are taking the low road.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll be hearing from some folks just like you too,</p>
<p>with some stories and reflections</p>
<p>from members of the audience.</p>
<p>So I am excited about this podcast</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m even more excited about this episode.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all, there are a million things to love</p>
<p>about Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>But the best thing is, is she shares her journey.</p>
<p>She shares her hurts, her joys, her triumphs with all of us</p>
<p>so we can all take a page</p>
<p>and learn a little bit about her life.</p>
<p>She has picked up incredible tools,</p>
<p>ways to deal with all the things that we all deal with.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s gonna share them with us today.</p>
<p>So forget about lighting up the room.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s light up this whole place, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>Mrs. Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m indestructible ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m a version of invincible ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Yes, I&rsquo;m invincible ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ And I&rsquo;m invincible ‚ô™</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You all look good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Saturday, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Saturday.</p>
<p>It is Saturday.</p>
<p>All right, just keeping track of time.</p>
<p>But you know what I noticed about you?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, you&rsquo;ve always been sparkly,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something extra sparkly about you</p>
<p>at this time in your life.</p>
<p>You are 58 years old.</p>
<p>Your voice is loud and proud.</p>
<p>What is it about this moment?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s freedom</p>
<p>in so many different ways.</p>
<p>In this first episode,</p>
<p>I wanna talk about this idea of light,</p>
<p>which is not just the title of this podcast,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really the core of my book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fundamental to how I see the world.</p>
<p>I believe deeply that everyone has a light inside them.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a steady flame.</p>
<p>Other times, it&rsquo;s a tiny little glimmer.</p>
<p>And at other moments, it&rsquo;s a raging fire.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest though,</p>
<p>these past couple of years,</p>
<p>that light has been waning for a lot of us, including me.</p>
<p>At times during the pandemic,</p>
<p>all those difficult moments where we were wrestling</p>
<p>with deep wounds of racism and injustice,</p>
<p>I was struggling to stay balanced and feel hopeful.</p>
<p>But what helped me find my footing and my center again</p>
<p>is finding something to lean on,</p>
<p>a practice, a tool, another person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my book is about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what this podcast is about too.</p>
<p>Finding ways, not just to protect and kindle our own light,</p>
<p>but to share it as well</p>
<p>so that we can illuminate a path forward together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really something I felt when I sat down</p>
<p>with the dazzling Hoda Kotb.</p>
<p>It felt like we were feeding off of one another&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>You probably know Hoda from the Today Show,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how I knew her too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved the way she interviews.</p>
<p>I kept on finding myself overtaken</p>
<p>by her warmth and positivity,</p>
<p>her vulnerability and her energy.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s really just wonderful.</p>
<p>Talking to her really is such a breath of fresh air,</p>
<p>and we just didn&rsquo;t wanna stop.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll start to notice that too.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>
<p>Now, you said that you found your voice in your 50s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you feel like you found it.</p>
<p>You know, we are taught that we&rsquo;re supposed to value youth.</p>
<p>And the only thing you are when you are young is young.</p>
<p>You really don&rsquo;t come into your own.</p>
<p>At least I didn&rsquo;t feel like I came into my own</p>
<p>until I was in my 50s.</p>
<p>And a lot of that has to do with,</p>
<p>you think you&rsquo;re supposed to have it figured out,</p>
<p>and for all you young people, no, no.</p>
<p>You will be confused for many decades.</p>
<p>And it is okay.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m on the other side of parenting.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m moving from mom-in-chief to advisor-in-chief,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a lovely thing,</p>
<p>to be able to watch my girls fly</p>
<p>and have the relief that,</p>
<p>okay, I think I didn&rsquo;t mess them up.</p>
<p>When it comes to my profession,</p>
<p>I feel like I have more autonomy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still in love with my husband,</p>
<p>so when it all&hellip;</p>
<p>When it all lines up,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a reason not to glow right now.</p>
<p>And I have my health,</p>
<p>which we cannot ever take that for granted,</p>
<p>especially in these times.</p>
<p>And we should point out,</p>
<p>one of your beautiful daughters is here with us.</p>
<p>I got one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of my glow right now.</p>
<p>Whenever&hellip;</p>
<p>When your children leave and they come back,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s just like, you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>So I have one of them with me.</p>
<p>How much of yourself had to be quieted</p>
<p>while you were in the White House?</p>
<p>Oh, so much of it.</p>
<p>So much of it.</p>
<p>Because the mission during those eight years</p>
<p>was bigger than just my voice.</p>
<p>You know, we were the first.</p>
<p>Hopefully not the only,</p>
<p>but we were the first.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re the first at stuff,</p>
<p>especially the first in the biggest spotlight,</p>
<p>the world watching you,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna mess it up, you know?</p>
<p>And you wanna make sure that you are representing.</p>
<p>You know, I talk about this in the book,</p>
<p>the challenges when you are the first or an only,</p>
<p>you are carrying a tray of other people&rsquo;s expectations</p>
<p>along with you on the journey.</p>
<p>You know, one small misstep isn&rsquo;t just a misstep for you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a misstep for your family,</p>
<p>for your community, for your race,</p>
<p>for all of humanity,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t often get a second chance.</p>
<p>Barack and I have been the first and only</p>
<p>in a number of different rooms.</p>
<p>And when you are that,</p>
<p>you feel like you have to show up</p>
<p>and there is no margin for error.</p>
<p>So it was no accident</p>
<p>that the administration was scandal free.</p>
<p>It was no accident that, you know,</p>
<p>that our children had to show up right in the world.</p>
<p>They carried a burden of making sure they weren&rsquo;t messy</p>
<p>because it wouldn&rsquo;t have been laughed off.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t have been just, oh, it&rsquo;s youthful, whatever.</p>
<p>It would have been some bigger statement</p>
<p>about the soul of black folks.</p>
<p>So we didn&rsquo;t underestimate that,</p>
<p>but that, that weight is exhausting</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re carrying that.</p>
<p>And after the inauguration,</p>
<p>and we know whose inauguration we were at,</p>
<p>that day was so emotional on so many different reasons.</p>
<p>We were leaving the home we had been in for eight years,</p>
<p>the only home our kids really knew.</p>
<p>They remembered Chicago,</p>
<p>but they had spent more time in the White House</p>
<p>than anywhere.</p>
<p>So we were saying goodbye to the staff</p>
<p>and all the people who helped to raise them.</p>
<p>There were tears.</p>
<p>There was that emotion.</p>
<p>But then to sit on that stage</p>
<p>and watch the opposite of what we represented on display.</p>
<p>There was no diversity.</p>
<p>There was no color on that stage.</p>
<p>There was no reflection of the broader sense of America.</p>
<p>And many people took pictures of me</p>
<p>and they like, you weren&rsquo;t in a good mood.</p>
<p>No, I was not.</p>
<p>But you had to hold it together</p>
<p>like you do for eight years.</p>
<p>And then you walk through the Capitol,</p>
<p>you wave goodbye,</p>
<p>you get on Marine One</p>
<p>and you take your last flight off,</p>
<p>flying over the Capitol</p>
<p>where there weren&rsquo;t that many people there.</p>
<p>We saw it, by the way.</p>
<p>And then we went to Andrews Air Force Base,</p>
<p>said goodbye to the military,</p>
<p>got on Air Force One.</p>
<p>And when those doors shut,</p>
<p>I cried for 30 minutes straight.</p>
<p>Uncontrollable sobbing</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how much we were holding it together</p>
<p>for eight years</p>
<p>without really being able to show it all.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s the long way of saying,</p>
<p>yeah, no, I had to count my steps</p>
<p>for eight years.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, that was real.</p>
<p>Are you happier now than you were then?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Do not get me wrong.</p>
<p>Being First Lady of this country</p>
<p>was the greatest honor.</p>
<p>It was the greatest honor of my life.</p>
<p>And I took it seriously.</p>
<p>I worked my butt off for this nation</p>
<p>because I felt like if you&rsquo;re here for eight years,</p>
<p>I wanted to leave and show something.</p>
<p>I wanted to touch some lives.</p>
<p>I wanted to open that house up.</p>
<p>I wanted people flowing through it.</p>
<p>I wanted kids to feel like they were a part of that house.</p>
<p>So every event was well thought out.</p>
<p>We included a broader set of communities.</p>
<p>We had music.</p>
<p>We had Girl Scouts camping out.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want a day go by</p>
<p>that that house didn&rsquo;t feel full and loved.</p>
<p>So do not get me wrong.</p>
<p>It was a privilege to serve,</p>
<p>but it was hard.</p>
<p>And it was hard on our family.</p>
<p>It was hard on my daughters growing up in the spotlight.</p>
<p>You just try to make it look easy</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to seem ungrateful.</p>
<p>The little bit that we were going through,</p>
<p>we lived in the world.</p>
<p>We saw tragedy, real tragedy.</p>
<p>We hugged people who had lost their kids to gun violence.</p>
<p>We attended too many funerals.</p>
<p>I spent my time on military bases</p>
<p>where military families were sacrificing</p>
<p>way more than I ever did.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to talk about that</p>
<p>because comparatively speaking, we had it easy.</p>
<p>But being outside of politics</p>
<p>and outside of the divisiveness of our politics</p>
<p>is just a better place.</p>
<p>I just think that people can hear you better</p>
<p>if you have a point.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not a politician, that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>So yes, I&rsquo;m happier outside of that.</p>
<p>There are so many beautiful things about your father.</p>
<p>Your father had MS,</p>
<p>and it was so interesting as I was reading about this.</p>
<p>Meredith Vieira, who&rsquo;s a dear friend of mine,</p>
<p>her husband has MS.</p>
<p>I remember hearing her story, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, she told me there&rsquo;s only one good thing about MS,</p>
<p>and I said, what is that?</p>
<p>And she said, it made our children better people.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It made the children better.</p>
<p>So then I thought about you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re used to watching your dad struggle,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re used to being the one,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to look out for him.</p>
<p>How did his, you call it a differentness,</p>
<p>not a disability, how did it affect you, change you?</p>
<p>My father, if you talk about how,</p>
<p>who has affected me most in how I see the world,</p>
<p>and who gave me the foundation to know that I mattered,</p>
<p>to understand that you gotta find your light from within,</p>
<p>that it is not handed to you,</p>
<p>nor should you expect anybody to hand it to you.</p>
<p>It was my father,</p>
<p>because with all that he had to deal with it,</p>
<p>he was one of the most visible people I knew.</p>
<p>He was a bright light, not just for us,</p>
<p>but for his siblings, for my mother&rsquo;s siblings,</p>
<p>for his extended family, he was the core.</p>
<p>And he was satisfied with his life.</p>
<p>You know, he was satisfied with what many of us</p>
<p>would think would be this small life,</p>
<p>but he knew his life was big.</p>
<p>He knew he was fortunate.</p>
<p>So whatever challenges he faced, he turned those into gold.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s hard for me to ever feel sorry for myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to ever let anybody else get me down,</p>
<p>because I think about what my father did,</p>
<p>getting up every day to go to work, not complaining,</p>
<p>being an honest man, being an honest broker,</p>
<p>which is one of the reasons</p>
<p>that helped me see that in Barack.</p>
<p>You know, I saw those qualities in him</p>
<p>in the same way I saw them in my father.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law is legitimately the kindest person</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve ever met in my life.</p>
<p>So for example, she even did it maybe just the other day</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;ll send me a text message</p>
<p>just saying like just the most amazing things.</p>
<p>Like, oh, you&rsquo;re such an amazing mother.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so, we&rsquo;re so happy that you&rsquo;re ours.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so glad that you&rsquo;re, you know, things like that.</p>
<p>And you know, on a regular,</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;s sending me these text messages.</p>
<p>But I think those are the small things</p>
<p>that really add up to what kindness should look like.</p>
<p>She just said, have you seen Michelle Obama yet?</p>
<p>Just thinking about you, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like things like that, so thoughtful.</p>
<p>And I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Like you remember that I&rsquo;m going to see Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>You thought to text me about it,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sure she wants to talk about it.</p>
<p>Those are the things that really help build</p>
<p>and maintain really great relationships.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so grateful for it.</p>
<p>You know what I love?</p>
<p>You said something to me the other day.</p>
<p>You said, you know, Barack can say to me,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re beautiful, you&rsquo;re ravishing.</p>
<p>You, the sun rises and sets on you.</p>
<p>And he can mean all those things.</p>
<p>Yet if you don&rsquo;t feel it inside yourself,</p>
<p>that kind of that love for yourself,</p>
<p>which is elusive for all of us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all kind of trying to find it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t land well, even though he&rsquo;s telling the truth.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the power of the voices in our head,</p>
<p>the negative voices.</p>
<p>And I am not immune just because I put on nice clothes</p>
<p>and I give good speeches and I lived in the White House.</p>
<p>A lot of people think, oh, you too have doubt.</p>
<p>You too have negative thoughts in your head.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, probably more than most,</p>
<p>because I am subject to the public discussion</p>
<p>where everyone is discussing your weight,</p>
<p>your height, your size.</p>
<p>And everyone feels like they can comment on your life.</p>
<p>So yeah, we all have those negative images.</p>
<p>And one of the chapters in the book I write about,</p>
<p>one of the earlier chapters I call Starting Kind.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just about learning to give yourself</p>
<p>messages of gladness and having that as a practice,</p>
<p>because we live the opposite in our minds.</p>
<p>We generally wake up and look at ourselves</p>
<p>and we find all the things wrong,</p>
<p>that running list of things that only we know,</p>
<p>even if the rest of the world can&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>But if we don&rsquo;t start practicing kindness for ourselves</p>
<p>and gladness, it&rsquo;s hard for us to give it to other people.</p>
<p>Sometimes when our kids walk into the room,</p>
<p>we greet them with what&rsquo;s called a critical eye.</p>
<p>Like Malia came in and she was wrinkled.</p>
<p>Whatever she had on was very wrinkly.</p>
<p>And she was actually coming to my hotel room</p>
<p>to find the steamer.</p>
<p>She walks in, maybe the second time I saw her this morning,</p>
<p>and I was like, you&rsquo;re wrinkly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna do something about this.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, yeah, mom, I&rsquo;m gonna.</p>
<p>And then I thought I did it.</p>
<p>I greeted her instead of what I felt,</p>
<p>which is, sit on my lap, give me a kiss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fixing things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pointing out, oh my God, your hair is not right here.</p>
<p>What Toni Morrison says is that,</p>
<p>our kids just want our gladness.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need us to fix them.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need us to point out the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wrong first.</p>
<p>And I write about that because that is a practice.</p>
<p>I know that I try to practice that with kids in the world.</p>
<p>I understand the power of the gladness</p>
<p>I can give them me, Michelle Obama,</p>
<p>the first lady of the United States.</p>
<p>I know that when I am interacting with kids</p>
<p>that it means something for me to see their specialness.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why we spent so much time with kids</p>
<p>because what I do understand is that there are a lot of kids</p>
<p>who can live their whole life</p>
<p>and not be received with gladness.</p>
<p>And I just think, man, if this interaction</p>
<p>is their chance to be seen by somebody</p>
<p>and somebody that they think is important,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna squander it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also there as a reminder to all of us</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve gotta be careful</p>
<p>with how we communicate with young people.</p>
<p>And sometimes our limits get in the way,</p>
<p>especially out in the world when we dehumanize kids,</p>
<p>when we don&rsquo;t see kids as our own.</p>
<p>Sometimes you attack them like they&rsquo;re a grownup.</p>
<p>You shoo them out of your store.</p>
<p>You treat them like they don&rsquo;t belong in a museum.</p>
<p>They are nuisances.</p>
<p>And as adults, showing them that leaves a mark on them.</p>
<p>And I know whether it&rsquo;s road rage</p>
<p>or some kid standing on the corner that you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>or somebody who&rsquo;s in your business establishment</p>
<p>making too much noise,</p>
<p>we have to remember they&rsquo;re still young people.</p>
<p>And we are still the models of showing them</p>
<p>the best parts of themselves.</p>
<p>And I see us messing with kids.</p>
<p>We see it on the streets,</p>
<p>some kids selling a lemonade</p>
<p>and a neighbor calling the police on them.</p>
<p>For an adult to do that to a child is a sin and a shame.</p>
<p>But when that happens,</p>
<p>a lot of times it&rsquo;s because they haven&rsquo;t learned</p>
<p>to greet themselves with gladness.</p>
<p>Now, as an adult, I can look back at that.</p>
<p>When that happens to me,</p>
<p>I can see the other person&rsquo;s brokenness.</p>
<p>Children cannot make that distinction.</p>
<p>They cannot look at some crazy adult</p>
<p>saying something to them and wonder,</p>
<p>well, what happened to you today?</p>
<p>So it is incumbent upon us to figure that out for them.</p>
<p>Well, we have four kids now.</p>
<p>We have a newborn who&rsquo;s six weeks old.</p>
<p>We have a three-year-old,</p>
<p>a seven-year-old and a nine-year-old.</p>
<p>Three of them through adoption</p>
<p>and one through surrogacy.</p>
<p>And we were very fortunate when our worker said</p>
<p>that there were two boys who needed a forever family.</p>
<p>So they were two and five.</p>
<p>And so we took them on.</p>
<p>We got called that there was a baby</p>
<p>who was a safe surrender baby.</p>
<p>And our worker had a selection of families to go with.</p>
<p>And she chose us because of our unique situation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a same-sex couple.</p>
<p>And she says that she wanted our daughter</p>
<p>to be able to grow up knowing</p>
<p>that the family will be able to explain</p>
<p>that family doesn&rsquo;t mean just traditional family.</p>
<p>That it can be something unique like our situation.</p>
<p>And that that&rsquo;s okay that we&rsquo;re still a family.</p>
<p>And so she picked us and she fought for us actually.</p>
<p>By the way, he is an attorney</p>
<p>and he works as like a disability rights advocate.</p>
<p>And this guy is at daycare to make sure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re compliant with the state laws and regulations.</p>
<p>So you really couldn&rsquo;t find two better parents</p>
<p>and a better position to raise good kids.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so sweet of you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s our daughter.</p>
<p>And then we were already in the process of surrogacy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s three.</p>
<p>And then our surrogate bore our child on October 14.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s only six weeks old.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how we have a family of four kids.</p>
<p>My husband and I and we&rsquo;re a full house.</p>
<p>What are you telling them about having their own families?</p>
<p>Cause I think there&rsquo;s pressure obviously</p>
<p>on a lot of people to be like,</p>
<p>oh, when are you gonna get married?</p>
<p>When are you gonna have kids?</p>
<p>How do you advise them through that?</p>
<p>I write about this in Partnering Well.</p>
<p>I mean, I want my daughters to have a broad view</p>
<p>of what happiness can look like.</p>
<p>And I think we do a disservice, particularly to women.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, you get that all the time.</p>
<p>You know, first, you could have an amazing career</p>
<p>and somebody says, are you married?</p>
<p>My grandmother used to do this to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in law school at Harvard.</p>
<p>My grandmother would call me to chat.</p>
<p>And first thing she would say, what did you cook?</p>
<p>My grandma, I&rsquo;m in law school.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t even a kitchen around, you know?</p>
<p>But that becomes the expectation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a young woman.</p>
<p>Are you married?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t mean to call you out in particular</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t ask that question anymore, you know?</p>
<p>And then if you are, oh, when are you gonna have a baby?</p>
<p>Not knowing, can you?</p>
<p>Do you want one?</p>
<p>You know, what kind of pain that generates?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like saying, oh, well, you&rsquo;re married</p>
<p>but, oh, you can&rsquo;t really be happy.</p>
<p>And then you have one kid, what do they wanna know?</p>
<p>Oh, are you gonna have a boy?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have another one?</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s never enough</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know what life will hand them.</p>
<p>Maybe you find love, great,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t get married to check a box,</p>
<p>to respond to somebody else</p>
<p>because there are so many ways.</p>
<p>And Hoda, you are a living, breathing example</p>
<p>of how many ways you can build a life</p>
<p>and have a family and have happiness, you know?</p>
<p>And we should not be making you question that.</p>
<p>And we tend to do that.</p>
<p>And I want my daughters growing up understanding</p>
<p>that they can have whatever life they choose.</p>
<p>As long as they&rsquo;re happy, we&rsquo;ve got their backs.</p>
<p>And I know you&rsquo;ve dealt with that too, Hoda.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what&rsquo;s funny?</p>
<p>I actually always wanted children,</p>
<p>never said it out loud because I was married, divorced,</p>
<p>and I had breast cancer all in my,</p>
<p>during that window when it&rsquo;s supposed to happen.</p>
<p>And so I just never spoke about it.</p>
<p>And one day I was walking just down the street</p>
<p>with a good friend of mine and she said casually,</p>
<p>well, we never wanted kids, you know,</p>
<p>just, you know, she&rsquo;s married, been married for years.</p>
<p>And for the very first time I said, well, actually I did.</p>
<p>And she goes, you never said it.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I never said it</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to say something out loud</p>
<p>that I know I&rsquo;ll never be able to have.</p>
<p>So I never said it.</p>
<p>And then it taught me something in that minute.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, if you want something, say it out loud,</p>
<p>even just to yourself in the bathroom mirror, say it.</p>
<p>Because Michelle, after I said it out loud,</p>
<p>I have chills on my body.</p>
<p>After I said it out loud, I said,</p>
<p>I saw a story about Sandra Bullock,</p>
<p>my exact age who just adopted a child.</p>
<p>And I go, oh my gosh, everywhere I turned,</p>
<p>I saw a possibility.</p>
<p>So I decided I&rsquo;m going to fill out the paperwork</p>
<p>and I did all the things I was supposed to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in my office and I&rsquo;ll never forget it.</p>
<p>And I got a text and it said, it was from Ashley</p>
<p>and Ashley from the adoption agency said,</p>
<p>if I ever text you, call me immediately.</p>
<p>So I saw the text, it said, call me.</p>
<p>And I took out a yellow pad like this one</p>
<p>and I wrote 11 05 AM.</p>
<p>You knew it was going to be something.</p>
<p>This is the moment I dialed the number</p>
<p>and she said two words, she&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>And I knew in that moment, Michelle,</p>
<p>like my whole life, I love you too.</p>
<p>My whole life changed and I thought to myself,</p>
<p>well, why not me?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the question</p>
<p>because some blessings come early.</p>
<p>Some blessings come later.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really know when your blessing is going to come.</p>
<p>But I think if you don&rsquo;t say it,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s your dream job, your dream place to live,</p>
<p>your dream, like I think sometimes we all get quieted.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not shy, we get quieted.</p>
<p>Well, because we live in a world, a society,</p>
<p>a country where we&rsquo;re taught</p>
<p>that only certain people&rsquo;s stories matter.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s like only one way to be human</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really limited.</p>
<p>It looks like a certain race, a certain gender,</p>
<p>a certain income class, which is sometimes</p>
<p>why we gravitate to leaders that look like that</p>
<p>because they look like they should know something.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also why it&rsquo;s important for us,</p>
<p>when we have platforms to be vulnerable</p>
<p>and share our stories so that we start rewriting</p>
<p>the story of who matters.</p>
<p>We have to all put our stories out there.</p>
<p>We have to rewrite the story of who matters and who counts.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re hiding it,</p>
<p>or if we&rsquo;re not stating our truth</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t fit into a certain definition,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re just keeping the definition of what&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>what is American, what has value.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hiding behind that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got to broaden the spectrum</p>
<p>of what it means to be American,</p>
<p>what it means to be accepted, what it means to be loved,</p>
<p>who deserves it.</p>
<p>But we all have to be vulnerable in that regard.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re sharing that part of it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s going to be somebody out there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a woman out there right now</p>
<p>who is single or divorced, who doesn&rsquo;t see herself</p>
<p>as someone who should be a mother</p>
<p>because it didn&rsquo;t take the right path.</p>
<p>And you are an amazing mother, you know?</p>
<p>And you have no reason to doubt</p>
<p>whether you should have done this, you know?</p>
<p>So thank you for sharing.</p>
<p>Best decision of my life, best decision.</p>
<p>I am Kristen Jones,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m co-founder and partner at Inside Projects.</p>
<p>And I am Mrs. Obama&rsquo;s former assistant</p>
<p>from the White House and also a friend.</p>
<p>Recently, I attempted to get my ex frozen.</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, this was something</p>
<p>that Michelle had been talking to me about</p>
<p>for basically the past decade.</p>
<p>So when I went to go get it done,</p>
<p>I had a not so great reaction to the hormones.</p>
<p>I was super emotional.</p>
<p>And we ended up canceling the round</p>
<p>because my body didn&rsquo;t respond.</p>
<p>And I think she knew very deeply how hard that was for me.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just that the round didn&rsquo;t go well,</p>
<p>it was also just coming to this deep self-acceptance</p>
<p>with myself that I cannot control this piece of my life</p>
<p>that I want so badly.</p>
<p>And so I called her out of the blue</p>
<p>in the middle of a Tuesday.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t pick up,</p>
<p>but she called me back five minutes later</p>
<p>and was just like,</p>
<p>I was on a meeting, but I saw you called, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>And I just let it all out.</p>
<p>I was crying, I was so upset.</p>
<p>I was telling her the story.</p>
<p>And she just stopped her day to completely ground me.</p>
<p>And she shifted the perspective for me</p>
<p>on the importance of understanding</p>
<p>what you can control in this life</p>
<p>and what you cannot control in this life.</p>
<p>And how to usher in a spirit of acceptance</p>
<p>around those things.</p>
<p>And she actually sent me a really beautiful text</p>
<p>when we got off the phone.</p>
<p>And she said some things that I think are just relevant</p>
<p>and true for a lot of people.</p>
<p>She said that for a lot of people,</p>
<p>their life trajectories are gonna be different</p>
<p>from those around them.</p>
<p>And their purpose is perhaps bigger and broader</p>
<p>than what they might be able to imagine.</p>
<p>And she encouraged me to embrace my individual process</p>
<p>and journey through it all.</p>
<p>Practice loving myself first</p>
<p>and reminded me that she&rsquo;ll always be there for me.</p>
<p>What was the best part of raising them in the White House</p>
<p>and what was the part you did not like?</p>
<p>The best part of raising them in the White House</p>
<p>was that, well, you know,</p>
<p>after coming off of the campaign where dad was always gone,</p>
<p>it was nice that he lived above the store.</p>
<p>So we could get back into our regular routine</p>
<p>of dinnertime together.</p>
<p>He could be there for bedtime.</p>
<p>He was there most of the time.</p>
<p>He was able to go to all their parent teacher conferences</p>
<p>and all their little concerts.</p>
<p>You know, he was able to be involved in their life.</p>
<p>He coached Sasha&rsquo;s fourth grade girls basketball league</p>
<p>which was a trip, right?</p>
<p>Because he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to coach.</p>
<p>They were called the Vipers.</p>
<p>And fourth grade, these little girls cared more</p>
<p>about putting their shirts up and tucking them in</p>
<p>than having their shoes tied.</p>
<p>So, but it was all the fourth grade girls in the school</p>
<p>and it was parent led.</p>
<p>And it was in a Y in the neighborhood</p>
<p>and Barack is a basketball junkie.</p>
<p>The parents who were coaching</p>
<p>really didn&rsquo;t know how to coach.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s sitting there at the games</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re not running any plays.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I know, I know.</p>
<p>They should be passing.</p>
<p>Matrisse should be under the net.</p>
<p>This, I don&rsquo;t know, what are they doing?</p>
<p>So he started easing down to where the coach&rsquo;s table was</p>
<p>each game and he was like, you know, first of all,</p>
<p>she needs to tie her shoe, you know?</p>
<p>So you imagine, you&rsquo;re the parent coach</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t know basketball</p>
<p>and the president of the United States is like checking you.</p>
<p>By game four, he was on the bench.</p>
<p>He started running practices</p>
<p>because he was like, if we&rsquo;re going to have,</p>
<p>they should have two plays.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re just going to work on two plays.</p>
<p>He designed two plays.</p>
<p>I remember one was called Box.</p>
<p>They had names, the plays.</p>
<p>And then, so he started having all the girls come</p>
<p>to one of the gyms in the department of something</p>
<p>that had a gym.</p>
<p>He and his assistant, Reggie Love,</p>
<p>they started running these girls through drills.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;d have practice on Wednesday</p>
<p>if there wasn&rsquo;t like a G Summit or a national crisis,</p>
<p>you know, when he was in town.</p>
<p>And then he would be at the games on Sunday</p>
<p>and they got good.</p>
<p>But imagine what that game was like for the other team,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Because it was Sasha and it was also Maisie Biden,</p>
<p>the Biden granddaughters are good friends with the girl.</p>
<p>Maisie is actually an amazing athlete.</p>
<p>So on any given game day, and we would all go.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re playing against the Vipers.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s in the gym?</p>
<p>The president, the first lady, the vice president,</p>
<p>the second lady, all of our kids, their parents,</p>
<p>and all of our secret service.</p>
<p>There was an ambulance outside.</p>
<p>There were helicopters flying over.</p>
<p>There were snipers at the door.</p>
<p>And then like Joe would be yelling like,</p>
<p>pass Maisie, block her.</p>
<p>And you could see the other parents were all like quiet,</p>
<p>like, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t seem fair.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>And they won the championship.</p>
<p>They won the championship.</p>
<p>It became a thing.</p>
<p>So that went a little long.</p>
<p>That was being able to, for us,</p>
<p>for him to be able to be engaged in that way</p>
<p>was a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got, I&rsquo;ve got so much to talk about,</p>
<p>but we have questions they want us to get to.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to get to this.</p>
<p>They know that you&rsquo;re going to win the championship.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to win the championship.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to win the championship.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to win the championship.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to this.</p>
<p>Daisy from New York has this question for you, Ms. Obama.</p>
<p>I just graduated from college</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m starting my career in New York City.</p>
<p>What advice do you give your daughters</p>
<p>when it comes to dating, money,</p>
<p>and prioritizing their mental health?</p>
<p>Ooh, okay, quick.</p>
<p>Take your time.</p>
<p>You know, so many young people are rushing</p>
<p>to the other end of what?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s waiting for you?</p>
<p>Work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be there.</p>
<p>Be patient with yourself.</p>
<p>And think broadly about what your life can be.</p>
<p>I just tell my kids there&rsquo;s, as I was just saying,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many ways to be happy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many ways to find joy in life.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just starting the journey.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the experimental phase.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of kids leave college</p>
<p>and they feel kind of lost</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve done the thing</p>
<p>that they were supposed to do</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re at the end of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, oh my God,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just life.</p>
<p>And so now you&rsquo;re going to start to explore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to try on jobs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to not like them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn from that stuff.</p>
<p>You may be trying on things until you&rsquo;re 40 years old.</p>
<p>I am still becoming.</p>
<p>I have not stopped evolving.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t get frustrated with the learning process.</p>
<p>And because there&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>make room for your mental health.</p>
<p>Prioritize it.</p>
<p>Eat right.</p>
<p>Are you eating vegetables?</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m going to tell you.</p>
<p>Eat your vegetables.</p>
<p>Get some sleep.</p>
<p>Nine times out of 10, if you&rsquo;re dragging,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve been up since 3 a.m. every night,</p>
<p>partying with your friends and then going to work.</p>
<p>Did you go to sleep?</p>
<p>You just might need a nap.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>Thank you, Hoda.</p>
<p>‚ô™ When I wake up in the morning, love ‚ô™</p>
<p>Oh, I love Hoda.</p>
<p>I thought Hoda really shared a beautiful part of herself</p>
<p>in her story when she was so open about becoming a parent.</p>
<p>And while our stories are different,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much we share.</p>
<p>Because when I think about my own light,</p>
<p>my girls, my daughters are right at the center of it too.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re doing great, the world feels great.</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re not, well,</p>
<p>everything just feels out of place.</p>
<p>Every parent will tell you the same thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it was so meaningful to connect with Hoda</p>
<p>and our fabulous audience members about this challenging,</p>
<p>sometimes maddening, but ultimately beautiful experience</p>
<p>of being parents.</p>
<p>What a great conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you all for listening.</p>
<p>Talk to you again soon.</p>
