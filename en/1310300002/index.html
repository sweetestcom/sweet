<p>Hello Aubrey.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m great.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Happy to be here recording today on the microphone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always my favorite part of the week.</p>
<p>So what are you up to today?</p>
<p>Oh, I have a friend meeting me here for lunch, but no worries.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have finished recording before she arrives.</p>
<p>Well good to know.</p>
<p>Good to know.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t want to hear you chewing on the microphone.</p>
<p>With a friend sitting here out of view, and we&rsquo;re both eating, that&rsquo;d be a little awkward.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mind me.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll notice in my answer there, I shared a grammar structure that&rsquo;s a little complicated</p>
<p>to say we&rsquo;ll have finished recording before she arrives.</p>
<p>Guys, this is future perfect.</p>
<p>You want it.</p>
<p>You have surely used it before.</p>
<p>You have heard it before.</p>
<p>Now you know what it&rsquo;s called and how it&rsquo;s formed.</p>
<p>I think this is going to be really interesting so that, yeah, you can make sure to use it</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, super excited and happy to be getting into grammar.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to try to get into more grammar for you guys in 2023, but in the same fun</p>
<p>connection not perfection way we do on All Ears English.</p>
<p>I think our listeners are ready for that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re wanting that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, definitely.</p>
<p>You guys know it&rsquo;s not all about grammar.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be stressed about every mistake, but I know you guys are interested</p>
<p>in improving your grammar because you&rsquo;re at that level.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to give you the information you need to get there.</p>
<p>But again, with the focus, like you said, Lindsay, of connecting in English.</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>So do we need to send our listeners back to any old episodes to get ready for today?</p>
<p>Yes, this was a very recent one.</p>
<p>Episode 1881, we answered the first half of today&rsquo;s listener question.</p>
<p>This was from Julie Tang, and it was such an interesting question, but needed a few</p>
<p>episodes to really answer it fully.</p>
<p>So that one was called Past Perfect Grammar for Clarifying in English, because she asked</p>
<p>about past perfect and also future perfect.</p>
<p>Okay, so today&rsquo;s kind of like a second part of that episode, right?</p>
<p>100 episodes, or not 100, about 30 episodes later, we&rsquo;re back, right, with part two, talking</p>
<p>about what exactly, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re going to talk about how we use the future perfect tense, which, just</p>
<p>to break this down, it&rsquo;s an action that will finish sometime in the future before some</p>
<p>other event in the future.</p>
<p>So this is all about future, right, but it is a perfect tense.</p>
<p>So the construction is a little tricky.</p>
<p>We want to really break it down so that you guys understand how we form it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think I just used this on an episode we just finished recording, where I said something</p>
<p>like by the time this episode comes out, we will have finished the midterm elections,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>We will have already had the midterm election.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>So we do use that, will have, right?</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re looking back from a point in time in the future, we&rsquo;re sort of imagining ourselves</p>
<p>in the future after these elections have finished, and we&rsquo;re talking about it.</p>
<p>So for example, I might say, oh, I&rsquo;ll have finished dinner by the time you get home,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s late getting home from work, and I&rsquo;m eating by myself, I&rsquo;ll have finished</p>
<p>dinner by the time you get home.</p>
<p>Just pick yourself up something.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And what do we say about don&rsquo;t bother?</p>
<p>What are we saying here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not clear.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we often use this to say don&rsquo;t bother, like in that case, right?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m saying, you&rsquo;re not going to be home by the time I&rsquo;ve finished, so like, you know,</p>
<p>maybe if we&rsquo;re at a restaurant, and someone&rsquo;s asking, like, have you ordered?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on my way, you might say, like, don&rsquo;t come because we&rsquo;ll have finished by the time</p>
<p>you get here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s another, it&rsquo;s sort of a kind way of saying don&rsquo;t bother to come to use this future</p>
<p>perfect tense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of very current.</p>
<p>And it makes sense.</p>
<p>I mean, especially for a busy household where for you, you have kids doing soccer and this</p>
<p>and that and sports, and everyone&rsquo;s all over the place, right?</p>
<p>So I imagine you use this a lot because people&rsquo;s schedules are coinciding and colliding with</p>
<p>each other, not always lining up, right?</p>
<p>And friends like busy moms who like, oh, we want to meet for happy hour, but you got to</p>
<p>take your kid here and there.</p>
<p>So by the time I get there, you guys may have finished eating, should I bother coming?</p>
<p>Definitely, when you&rsquo;re trying to arrange schedules, this comes up all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, now that we&rsquo;re kind of moving out of the health crisis, we&rsquo;re all back out there</p>
<p>in the world again, you know, living our lives.</p>
<p>And so we use this more and more often.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>But today, I love Aubrey, how you&rsquo;ve prepared this episode by breaking this grammar down,</p>
<p>because the whole point is connection.</p>
<p>And we want to help you guys, you know, slow down and really understand this with us today,</p>
<p>right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>So three layers.</p>
<p>Are we going to do three layers of grammar?</p>
<p>Exactly, right, especially where you&rsquo;re listening to this on a podcast, or maybe on YouTube,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t see the words written, we really want to make this clear.</p>
<p>So for each sentence that has future perfect, there are sort of three chunks or three layers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about each one and build the sentence as we go so that hopefully it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be a visual, even though you&rsquo;re listening to a podcast.</p>
<p>All right, well, let&rsquo;s start building.</p>
<p>So what is the first layer that we need to know?</p>
<p>Yeah, so each sentence that has future perfect starts with the subject and then will have</p>
<p>and the past participle.</p>
<p>And this is the same for every subject.</p>
<p>So that makes it a little easy, right?</p>
<p>I will have eaten, we will have eaten.</p>
<p>So you have the subject, I, you, we will have and then whatever your past participle is.</p>
<p>Okay, or she will have left, right, by the time she arrives at the restaurant, her friend</p>
<p>will have left or will have already eaten dessert or something, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the tricky thing is here, we&rsquo;ve talked about this before, past participles can be</p>
<p>difficult.</p>
<p>There are irregular past participles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always just adding ed.</p>
<p>So you do need to learn the past participles for each verb.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s key for the perfect tenses, past perfect, present perfect, future perfect, you have</p>
<p>to know the past participle.</p>
<p>Maybe someday we could do an episode like a fun little quiz game episode on past participles</p>
<p>for our listeners sometime and make it really fun and active and fast.</p>
<p>That could be kind of cool.</p>
<p>That could be kind of cool.</p>
<p>It would be fun.</p>
<p>And just as a note, the best way to learn past participles is just to take in a lot</p>
<p>of English because you probably, that sounded right to you that Lindsay said she will have</p>
<p>left.</p>
<p>If she said she will have leaved, no, that sounds terrible because you listen to our</p>
<p>podcast.</p>
<p>You listen to a lot of English.</p>
<p>Usually, you know what sounds correct as a past participle.</p>
<p>Yeah, guys, hit follow on All There&rsquo;s English right now so that you don&rsquo;t miss the next</p>
<p>episode.</p>
<p>And this is how most of our listeners have become nearly fluent is because they got addicted</p>
<p>to All There&rsquo;s English and they listen four days a week and then they went back to all</p>
<p>the episodes.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the second chunk.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we have, you know, we will have eaten.</p>
<p>What comes next is either before or by the time or when.</p>
<p>Some kind of time indicator, right?</p>
<p>So for example, we will have eaten before or we will have eaten by the time.</p>
<p>Okay, I love it.</p>
<p>Or we will have eaten when she arrives or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;ll have left when they arrive, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have left by the time.</p>
<p>So there is flexibility here, but these are the three we use most often before, by the</p>
<p>time and when to share that something will have happened by the time something else happens.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re building up these sentences one step at a time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go into the third layer of the sentence here, Aubrey.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Yes, it ends with present tense.</p>
<p>So for example, we&rsquo;ll have eaten before you arrive.</p>
<p>So you have the subject and it&rsquo;s always in present tense.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll have eaten before she arrives.</p>
<p>Again, we have these three chunks.</p>
<p>We have the whole sentence here and it ends with present tense.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Or she&rsquo;ll have left when he gets here.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the full sentence.</p>
<p>I hope for you guys, it now seems like this isn&rsquo;t so tough.</p>
<p>Like when I understand the chunks, when I see what&rsquo;s happening here, it&rsquo;s pretty simple,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Which is the goal so that you guys can now use it.</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey, this is great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve layered out, you know, how to actually create this grammar.</p>
<p>What do we need to know in a simple nutshell here?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So Julie&rsquo;s question asks about will have versus would have.</p>
<p>So Julie, if you&rsquo;re listening, I hope you are.</p>
<p>Never fear.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to share that soon because these again are very different, right?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, like you said, Lindsay, we use would have as the past tense of will have.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re talking about will have.</p>
<p>We will have done something.</p>
<p>And then we have the past tense of that too.</p>
<p>I would have done something.</p>
<p>And we also use would have in conditionals to talk about something that didn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>in the past.</p>
<p>So that definitely is another episode to follow so that you don&rsquo;t miss it because that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>fascinating to grammar to be able to use.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s definitely grammar for another day, guys.</p>
<p>We try to take one little grammar piece at a time for you in small doses, right?</p>
<p>To make it fun and focus on that connection piece.</p>
<p>But I do want to know in a nutshell, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit just for one second about</p>
<p>that phrase.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a really great idiom.</p>
<p>If you imagine an actual shell of a nut, like if you crack open a walnut and you have the</p>
<p>shell there, it&rsquo;s quite small.</p>
<p>So if you imagine the information that could fit in that little nutshell would have to</p>
<p>really be the synopsis would have to be the most important details.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what we just shared about would have it would be a whole episode.</p>
<p>But we say in a nutshell, here&rsquo;s the basics.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So guys, make sure you hit follow to catch that other episode where we&rsquo;ll get back to</p>
<p>that with would have and all those other ways to say that.</p>
<p>But for now, what do we have, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, we have a great role play here.</p>
<p>This is fun.</p>
<p>Lindsay, you have stepped into the hall to take a call from me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a co-worker.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start us out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Have you guys started the meeting?</p>
<p>Yes, they started 30 minutes ago.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have finished going over the agenda when I get back.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about 45 minutes out still.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll have ended by the time you get here.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a terrible feeling to be that late for a meeting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, no, it&rsquo;ll be over before I ever get there.</p>
<p>Yeah, what a hard thing when you pack your schedule so full.</p>
<p>You know, you feel like this is always happening to you, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an uncomfortable feeling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always running around.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Especially I this happens to me a lot because I&rsquo;m bad at prioritizing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be like, I can get all of that done.</p>
<p>And then I really need to be reasonable and say, okay, this is going to have to give.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do all of this.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>We want to, yeah.</p>
<p>Committing to the right number of things in a day is the key.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that art?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So what did I say?</p>
<p>I said here, they started 30 minutes ago.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have finished going over the agenda when I get back.</p>
<p>So they will have finished when I get back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And just to note that we do almost always make a contraction between the subject and</p>
<p>will, they&rsquo;ll have finished, I&rsquo;ll have finished, right?</p>
<p>We rarely will say, I will have finished.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be I&rsquo;ll, they&rsquo;ll, she&rsquo;ll always.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And then what would be the next one?</p>
<p>And then you said, I think it&rsquo;ll have ended by the time you get here, right?</p>
<p>So we have, it will have ended by the time you get here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I also want to make sure our listeners know this is not the only way to express this,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Sometimes a native speaker might say, they&rsquo;ll be done when you get back.</p>
<p>I might be more likely, honestly, to say that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be done by the time you get back.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And I think this happens a lot too, if people are not positive that they&rsquo;re using Future</p>
<p>Perfect correctly, sometimes we&rsquo;ll almost edit ourselves and be like, oh, am I saying</p>
<p>that right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to say, they&rsquo;re going to be done by the time you get here.</p>
<p>Other ways to say, or the last one, you know, I think it&rsquo;ll be over by the time you get</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just, if people aren&rsquo;t sure if it&rsquo;s right, what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also just laziness a little bit or what&rsquo;s more accessible.</p>
<p>And more informal.</p>
<p>For sure, I think that sounds a little more informal to say, it&rsquo;s going to be over by</p>
<p>the time you get here.</p>
<p>It does sound a little formal to use that Future Perfect.</p>
<p>And it just takes a lot of time to say it.</p>
<p>The grammar is a little long-winded.</p>
<p>More syllables.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But the important thing is we want you guys to know how to do it.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the takeaway for our listeners today?</p>
<p>Well, first, I just noticed in the role play, there&rsquo;s a little bonus I want to share very</p>
<p>quickly.</p>
<p>When I said, I was saying that I was 45 minutes away, I said, oh, I&rsquo;m 45 minutes out.</p>
<p>And this is so native and natural, instead of saying, I&rsquo;m still 45 minutes away, I still</p>
<p>have 45 minutes to drive.</p>
<p>We say, I&rsquo;m 45 minutes out, which is really native.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you said that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even notice that.</p>
<p>But that is so natural.</p>
<p>So natural.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 45 minutes out.</p>
<p>Such a great other way to say away.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good bonus.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So yeah, for a takeaway, guys, it&rsquo;s super helpful to be aware of all of these different</p>
<p>verb tenses.</p>
<p>But again, don&rsquo;t let it derail you.</p>
<p>Do not ever hesitate to talk with someone in English and make that connection because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re worried about making a grammar mistake, right?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let that stop you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let that stress you out.</p>
<p>There is value.</p>
<p>It is worth trying to improve your grammar, knowing why we use which tense when, but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let it keep you from a valuable connection.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And on the lifestyle side, think about when you&rsquo;re over committing.</p>
<p>So this doesn&rsquo;t always happen to you.</p>
<p>So that you&rsquo;re not missing everything, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always done by the time you arrive.</p>
<p>Try to avoid that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>See, what is that sweet spot of the right number of things in a day where you&rsquo;re fulfilled,</p>
<p>you feel busy, but you&rsquo;re not missing everything, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Who knew grammar could help us with our lifestyle goals?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
