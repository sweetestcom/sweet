    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I want to thank the first sponsor of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s element.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re talking about neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>which is this incredible feature of our nervous systems</p>
<p>that allows it to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is arguably one of the most important</p>
<p>aspects of our biology.</p>
<p>It holds the promise for each and all of us</p>
<p>to think differently, to learn new things,</p>
<p>to forget painful experiences,</p>
<p>and to essentially adapt to anything that life brings us</p>
<p>by becoming better.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity has a long and important history,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not going to review all of it in detail,</p>
<p>but today what we are going to do</p>
<p>is discuss what is neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>as well as the different forms of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about how to access neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>depending on how old you are,</p>
<p>and depending on the specific types of changes</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to create.</p>
<p>This is a topic for which there are lots of tools,</p>
<p>as well as lots of biological principles</p>
<p>that we can discuss.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with the word neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes also called neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Those are the same thing.</p>
<p>So if I say neuroplasticity or neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the same process,</p>
<p>which is the brain and nervous system&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to change itself.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of reasons</p>
<p>why the nervous system would do this.</p>
<p>It could do it in response to some traumatic event.</p>
<p>It could, for instance, create a sense of fear</p>
<p>around a particular place,</p>
<p>or a fear of automobiles or planes.</p>
<p>It could also occur when something positive happens,</p>
<p>like the birth of our first child,</p>
<p>or when our puppy does something amusing,</p>
<p>or we see an incredible feat of performance in athleticism.</p>
<p>The word neuroplasticity means so many things</p>
<p>to so many different people</p>
<p>that I thought it would be important</p>
<p>to just first put a little bit of organizational logic</p>
<p>around what it is and how it happens.</p>
<p>Because nowadays, if you were to go online</p>
<p>and Google the word neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>you would find hundreds of thousands of references,</p>
<p>scientific references, as well as a lot of falsehoods</p>
<p>about what neuroplasticity is and how to access it.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about the science of it,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about the tools</p>
<p>that allow you to engage this incredible feature</p>
<p>of your nervous system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the first point,</p>
<p>which is that all of us were born with a nervous system</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t just capable of change,</p>
<p>but was designed to change.</p>
<p>When we enter the world,</p>
<p>our nervous system is primed for learning.</p>
<p>The brain and nervous system of a baby</p>
<p>is wired very crudely.</p>
<p>The connections are not precise.</p>
<p>And we can see evidence of that</p>
<p>in the fact that babies are kind of flopping there</p>
<p>like a kind of a little potato bug with limbs.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t really do much in terms of coordinated movement.</p>
<p>They certainly can&rsquo;t speak,</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t really do anything with precision.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because we come into this world overconnected.</p>
<p>We have essentially wires.</p>
<p>Those wires have names like axons and dendrites.</p>
<p>Those are the different parts of the neurons</p>
<p>discussed in episode one.</p>
<p>But those little parts and those wires and connections</p>
<p>are everywhere.</p>
<p>Imagine a bunch of roads</p>
<p>that are all connected to one another in kind of a mess,</p>
<p>but there are no highways.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all just small roads.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what the young nervous system is like.</p>
<p>And then as we mature,</p>
<p>as we go from day one of life to 10 years old,</p>
<p>20 years old, 30 years old,</p>
<p>what happens is particular connections get reinforced</p>
<p>and stronger and other connections are lost.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first important principle</p>
<p>that I want everyone to understand,</p>
<p>which is that developmental plasticity,</p>
<p>the neuroplasticity that occurs from the time we&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>until about age 25 is mainly a process</p>
<p>of removing connections that don&rsquo;t serve our goals well.</p>
<p>Now, of course, certain events happen</p>
<p>during that birth to 25 period</p>
<p>in which positive events and negative events</p>
<p>are really stamped down into our nervous system</p>
<p>in a very dramatic fashion</p>
<p>by what we call one trial learning.</p>
<p>We experienced something once</p>
<p>and then our nervous system is forever changed</p>
<p>by that experience.</p>
<p>Unless of course we go through some work</p>
<p>to undo that experience.</p>
<p>So I want you to imagine in your mind</p>
<p>that when you were brought into this world,</p>
<p>you were essentially a widely connected web of connections</p>
<p>that was really poor at doing any one thing.</p>
<p>And that through your experience,</p>
<p>what you were exposed to by your parents</p>
<p>or other caretakers, through your social interactions,</p>
<p>through your thoughts,</p>
<p>through the languages that you learn,</p>
<p>through the places you traveled or didn&rsquo;t travel,</p>
<p>your nervous system became customized</p>
<p>to your unique experience.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s true for certain parts of your brain</p>
<p>that are involved in what we call representations</p>
<p>of the outside world.</p>
<p>A lot of your brain is designed to represent the visual world</p>
<p>or represent the auditory world</p>
<p>or represent the gallery of smells</p>
<p>that are possible in the world.</p>
<p>However, there are aspects of your nervous system</p>
<p>that were designed not to be plastic.</p>
<p>They were wired so that plasticity</p>
<p>or changes in those circuits is very unlikely.</p>
<p>Those circuits include things like</p>
<p>the ones that control your heartbeat,</p>
<p>the ones that control your breathing,</p>
<p>the ones that control your digestion.</p>
<p>And thank goodness that those circuits</p>
<p>were set up that way</p>
<p>because you want those circuits to be extremely reliable.</p>
<p>You never want to have to think about</p>
<p>whether or not your heart will beat</p>
<p>or whether or not you will continue breathing</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;ll be able to digest your food.</p>
<p>So many nervous system features like digestion</p>
<p>and breathing and heart rate are hard to change.</p>
<p>Other aspects of our nervous system</p>
<p>are actually quite easy to change.</p>
<p>And one of the great gifts of childhood,</p>
<p>adolescence and young adulthood</p>
<p>is that we can learn through almost passive experience.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to focus that hard</p>
<p>in order to learn new things.</p>
<p>In fact, children go from being able to</p>
<p>speak no language whatsoever</p>
<p>to being able to speak many, many words</p>
<p>and comprise sentences,</p>
<p>including words they&rsquo;ve never heard before,</p>
<p>which is remarkable.</p>
<p>It means that the portions of the brain</p>
<p>involved in speech and language</p>
<p>are actually primed to learn and create new combinations.</p>
<p>What this tells us is that the young brain</p>
<p>is a plasticity machine,</p>
<p>but then right about age 25,</p>
<p>plus or minus a year or two,</p>
<p>everything changes.</p>
<p>After age 25 or so,</p>
<p>in order to get changes in our nervous system,</p>
<p>we have to engage in a completely different</p>
<p>set of processes in order to get those changes to occur.</p>
<p>And for them more importantly, to stick around.</p>
<p>And this is something that I think is vastly overlooked</p>
<p>in the popular culture discussion about neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>People always talk about fire together, wire together.</p>
<p>Fire together, wire together is true.</p>
<p>It is the statement of my colleague at Stanford,</p>
<p>Carla Schatz,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an absolute truth</p>
<p>about the way that the nervous system</p>
<p>wires up early in development.</p>
<p>But fire together, wire together</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t apply in the same way after age 25.</p>
<p>And so we have these little memes</p>
<p>and these little quotes that circulate on the internet,</p>
<p>like fire together, wire together,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a famous quote</p>
<p>from the greatest neurobiologist of all time, Ramon y Cajal.</p>
<p>I think it goes something like,</p>
<p>should somebody wish to change their nervous system,</p>
<p>they could be the sculptor of their nervous system</p>
<p>in any way they want, something like that.</p>
<p>And that sounds great.</p>
<p>I mean, who wouldn&rsquo;t want to change their nervous system</p>
<p>any way they want?</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s lost in those statements</p>
<p>is how to actually accomplish that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to cover that today.</p>
<p>But please understand that early in development,</p>
<p>your nervous system is connected very broadly</p>
<p>in ways that make it very hard to do anything well.</p>
<p>From birth until about age 25,</p>
<p>those connections get refined,</p>
<p>mainly through the removal of connections</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t serve us,</p>
<p>and the incredible strengthening of connections</p>
<p>that relate to either powerful experiences</p>
<p>or that allow us to do things like walk and talk</p>
<p>and do math, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then after age 25,</p>
<p>if we want to change those connections,</p>
<p>those super highways of connectivity,</p>
<p>we have to engage in some very specific processes.</p>
<p>And those processes, as we&rsquo;ll soon learn, are gated,</p>
<p>meaning you can&rsquo;t just decide to change your brain.</p>
<p>You actually have to go through a series of steps</p>
<p>to change your internal state</p>
<p>in ways that will allow you to change your brain.</p>
<p>I just want to acknowledge</p>
<p>that Costello is snoring particularly loud today.</p>
<p>Some of you seem very keen at picking up on his snoring.</p>
<p>Others of you can&rsquo;t hear his snoring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very low rumbling sound.</p>
<p>And whether or not you can or you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>probably relates to the sensitivity of your hearing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually going to talk about perfect pitch today</p>
<p>and a range of auditory detection.</p>
<p>And so if you can hear Costello&rsquo;s snoring, enjoy.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t, enjoy.</p>
<p>I want to talk about how the nervous system changes.</p>
<p>What are these changes?</p>
<p>Many of us have been captivated</p>
<p>by the stories in the popular press</p>
<p>about the addition of new neurons.</p>
<p>This idea, oh, if you go running or you exercise,</p>
<p>your brain actually makes new neurons.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m going to give you the bad news first,</p>
<p>which is that after puberty,</p>
<p>so after about age 14 or 15,</p>
<p>the human brain and nervous system adds very few,</p>
<p>if any, new neurons.</p>
<p>The idea that new neurons could be added to the brain</p>
<p>is one that has a rich history in experimental science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that in rodents and in some non-human primates,</p>
<p>new neurons, a process called neurogenesis,</p>
<p>can occur in areas of the brain,</p>
<p>such as the olfactory bulb,</p>
<p>which is of course involved in smell,</p>
<p>as well as a region of our hippocampus,</p>
<p>a center of the brain involved in memory</p>
<p>called the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>And there is strong evidence that new neurons</p>
<p>can be added to those structures throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>In humans, the evidence is a little bit more controversial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that we can add new neurons</p>
<p>to our olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>In fact, if any of you have ever had</p>
<p>the unfortunate experience of being hit on the head too hard,</p>
<p>the wires called axons from those olfactory neurons</p>
<p>that live in your nose can get sheared off</p>
<p>because they have to pass through a bony plate</p>
<p>called the cribriform plate.</p>
<p>And the cribriform plate can shear those axons</p>
<p>and people can become what&rsquo;s called anosmic.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t be able to smell.</p>
<p>But over time, those neurons,</p>
<p>unlike most all central nervous system neurons,</p>
<p>can grow those connections back</p>
<p>and even reestablish new neurons</p>
<p>added to the olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>They come from elsewhere deep in the brain</p>
<p>and they migrate through a pathway</p>
<p>called the rostral migratory stream.</p>
<p>You can Google these words</p>
<p>and look up some of the descriptions of this</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to learn more.</p>
<p>So indeed, there&rsquo;s some evidence</p>
<p>that the neurons responsible for smell</p>
<p>can be replaced throughout the lifespan,</p>
<p>certainly in very young individuals</p>
<p>from birth till about age 15 or so.</p>
<p>Whether or not there are new neurons</p>
<p>added to the hippocampus,</p>
<p>the memory center of the human brain isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>Many years ago, Rusty Gage&rsquo;s lab at the Salk Institute</p>
<p>did a really important study</p>
<p>looking at terminally ill cancer patients</p>
<p>and injecting them with a label,</p>
<p>a dye that is incorporated only into new neurons.</p>
<p>And after these patients died,</p>
<p>their brains were harvested,</p>
<p>the brains were looked at,</p>
<p>and there were new neurons there.</p>
<p>There was evidence for new neurons.</p>
<p>Those results, I think, stand over time,</p>
<p>but what was not really discussed</p>
<p>in the popular press discussion around those papers</p>
<p>was that it was very few cells that were being added.</p>
<p>And a number of papers have come along over the years,</p>
<p>mainly from labs at UCSF, although from others as well,</p>
<p>showing that if there are new neurons</p>
<p>added to the adult brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an infinitesimally small number of new neurons.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the depressing part.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get new neurons.</p>
<p>After we&rsquo;re born, we pretty much have the neurons</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to use our entire life.</p>
<p>And yes, as we get older</p>
<p>and we start to lose certain functions in our brain,</p>
<p>we lose neurons.</p>
<p>But all is not lost, so to speak,</p>
<p>because there are other ways in which neural circuits</p>
<p>can create new connections and add new functions,</p>
<p>including new memory, new abilities,</p>
<p>and new cognitive functions.</p>
<p>And those are mainly through the process</p>
<p>of making certain connections,</p>
<p>which of course are those things we call synapses,</p>
<p>between neurons, making those connections stronger</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re more reliable, they&rsquo;re more likely to engage,</p>
<p>as well as removing connections.</p>
<p>And the removal of connections is vital</p>
<p>to say moving through a grieving process</p>
<p>or removing the emotional load of a traumatic experience.</p>
<p>So even though we can&rsquo;t add new neurons</p>
<p>throughout our lifespan,</p>
<p>at least not in very great numbers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that we can change our nervous system,</p>
<p>that the nervous system is available for change,</p>
<p>that if we create the right set of circumstances</p>
<p>in our brain, chemical circumstances,</p>
<p>and if we create the right environmental circumstances</p>
<p>around us, our nervous system will shift into a mode</p>
<p>in which change isn&rsquo;t just possible, but it&rsquo;s probable.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>the hallmark of the child nervous system is change.</p>
<p>It wants to change.</p>
<p>The whole thing, everything from the chemicals</p>
<p>that are sloshing around in there,</p>
<p>to the fact that there&rsquo;s a lot of space between the neurons,</p>
<p>a lot of people don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but early in development,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of space between the neurons,</p>
<p>and so the neurons can literally move around</p>
<p>and sample different connections very easily,</p>
<p>removing some and keeping others.</p>
<p>As we get older, the so-called extracellular space</p>
<p>is actually filled up by things called extracellular matrix</p>
<p>and glial cells, glia means glue,</p>
<p>those cells are involved in a bunch of different processes,</p>
<p>but they start to fill in all the space,</p>
<p>kind of like pouring concrete between rocks,</p>
<p>and when that happens,</p>
<p>it becomes much harder to change the connections</p>
<p>that are there.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which we can all get plasticity</p>
<p>at any stage throughout the lifespan</p>
<p>is through deficits and impairments</p>
<p>in what we call our sensory apparati,</p>
<p>our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth,</p>
<p>and there are some very dramatic</p>
<p>and somewhat tragic examples of people,</p>
<p>for instance, who have genetic mutations</p>
<p>where they are born without a nose</p>
<p>and without any olfactory structures in the brain,</p>
<p>so they cannot smell.</p>
<p>In that case, areas of the brain</p>
<p>that normally would represent smell</p>
<p>become overtaken by areas of the brain</p>
<p>involved in other things like touch and hearing and sight.</p>
<p>In individuals that are blind from birth,</p>
<p>the so-called occipital cortex,</p>
<p>the visual cortex in the back,</p>
<p>becomes overtaken by hearing.</p>
<p>The neurons there will start to respond to sounds</p>
<p>as well as braille touch,</p>
<p>and actually, there&rsquo;s one particularly tragic incident</p>
<p>where a woman who was blind since birth</p>
<p>and because of neuroimaging studies,</p>
<p>we knew her visual cortex was no longer visual,</p>
<p>it was responsible for braille reading and for hearing,</p>
<p>she had a stroke that actually took out</p>
<p>most of the function of her visual cortex,</p>
<p>so then she was blind, she couldn&rsquo;t braille read or hear.</p>
<p>She did recover some aspect of function.</p>
<p>Now, most people, they don&rsquo;t end up</p>
<p>in that highly unfortunate situation,</p>
<p>and what we know is that, for instance,</p>
<p>blind people who use their visual cortex</p>
<p>for braille reading and for hearing</p>
<p>have much better auditory acuity and touch acuity,</p>
<p>meaning they can sense things with their fingers</p>
<p>and they can sense things with their hearing</p>
<p>that typical sighted folks wouldn&rsquo;t be able to.</p>
<p>In fact, you will find a much greater incidence</p>
<p>of perfect pitch in people that are blind,</p>
<p>and that tells us that the brain,</p>
<p>and in particular, this area we call the neocortex,</p>
<p>which is the outer part,</p>
<p>is really designed to be a map</p>
<p>of our own individual experience.</p>
<p>So these, what I call experiments of impairment or loss</p>
<p>where somebody is blind from birth or deaf from birth</p>
<p>or maybe has a limb development impairment</p>
<p>where they have a stump instead of an entire limb</p>
<p>with a functioning hand,</p>
<p>their brain will represent the body plan that they have,</p>
<p>not some other body plan.</p>
<p>But the beauty of the situation</p>
<p>is that the real estate up in the skull, that neocortex,</p>
<p>the essence of it is to be a customized map of experience.</p>
<p>Now, it is true, however, that if,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I were to be blind when I&rsquo;m 50,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 45 right now, I&rsquo;ve always been sighted.</p>
<p>If I was blind at 50,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably have less opportunity</p>
<p>to use my formerly visual cortex</p>
<p>for things like braille reading and hearing</p>
<p>because my brain has changed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not the same brain I had when I was a baby.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually a principle of biology.</p>
<p>Not many people know this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a principle of neurology,</p>
<p>which is called the Kennard principle,</p>
<p>which says if you&rsquo;re going to have a brain injury,</p>
<p>you want to have it early in life.</p>
<p>Of course, better to not have a brain injury at all,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re going to have it,</p>
<p>you want to have it early in life.</p>
<p>And this is based on a tremendous number of experiments</p>
<p>examining the amount of recovery</p>
<p>and the rate of recovery in humans</p>
<p>that had lesions to their brain</p>
<p>either early in life or later in life.</p>
<p>So the Kennard principle says</p>
<p>better to have injuries early in life.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s reassuring for the young folks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so reassuring for the older folks,</p>
<p>but there are aspects of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with impairments.</p>
<p>I mean, earlier I said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all walking around with this map,</p>
<p>this representation of the world around us.</p>
<p>So we can see edges, we can see colors,</p>
<p>except for folks that are colorblind, of course.</p>
<p>And we also have a map of emotional experience.</p>
<p>We have a map of whether or not</p>
<p>certain people are trustworthy,</p>
<p>certain people aren&rsquo;t trustworthy.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was at a course</p>
<p>and a woman came up to me and she said,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t teaching the course, I was in the course.</p>
<p>And she said, I just have to tell you</p>
<p>that every time you speak, it really stresses me out.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I&rsquo;ve heard that before,</p>
<p>but do you want to be more specific?</p>
<p>And she said, yeah, your tone of voice</p>
<p>reminds me of somebody</p>
<p>that I had a really terrible experience with.</p>
<p>I said, well, okay, well, I can&rsquo;t change my voice,</p>
<p>but I really appreciate that you acknowledge that.</p>
<p>And it also will help explain</p>
<p>why you seem to cringe every time I speak,</p>
<p>which I hadn&rsquo;t noticed until then.</p>
<p>But after that, I did notice she had a very immediate</p>
<p>and kind of visceral response to my speech.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of you are having that right now.</p>
<p>But in any event, over the period of this two-week course,</p>
<p>she would come back every once in a while and say,</p>
<p>you know what, I think just by telling you</p>
<p>that your voice was really difficult for me to listen to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually becoming more tolerable to me.</p>
<p>And by the end, we actually became pretty good friends</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still in touch.</p>
<p>And so what this says is that the recognition of something,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s an emotional thing</p>
<p>or a desire to learn something else,</p>
<p>is actually the first step in neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because our nervous system</p>
<p>has two broad sets of functions.</p>
<p>Some of those functions are reflexive,</p>
<p>things like our breathing, our heart rate, our obvious ones.</p>
<p>But other aspects are reflexive, like our ability to walk.</p>
<p>If I get up out of this chair and walk out of the door,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about each step that I&rsquo;m taking.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because I learned how to walk during development.</p>
<p>But when we decide that we&rsquo;re going to shift</p>
<p>some sort of behavior or some reaction</p>
<p>or some new piece of information that we want to learn</p>
<p>is something that we want to bring into our consciousness,</p>
<p>that awareness is a remarkable thing</p>
<p>because it cues the brain and the rest of the nervous system</p>
<p>that when we engage in those reflexive actions going forward,</p>
<p>that those reflexive actions</p>
<p>are no longer fated to be reflexive.</p>
<p>Now, if this sounds a little bit abstract,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about protocols for how to do this.</p>
<p>But the first step in neuroplasticity</p>
<p>is recognizing that you want to change something.</p>
<p>And you should immediately say,</p>
<p>well, kids don&rsquo;t go into school and say,</p>
<p>oh, I want to learn language</p>
<p>or I want to learn social interactions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the beauty of childhood.</p>
<p>The whole brain has this switch flipped</p>
<p>that is making change possible.</p>
<p>But after that, we have to be deliberate.</p>
<p>We have to know what it is exactly that we want to change.</p>
<p>Or if we don&rsquo;t know exactly what it is</p>
<p>that we want to change,</p>
<p>we at least have to know</p>
<p>that we want to change something</p>
<p>about some specific experience.</p>
<p>In this case, I believe that she came and told me</p>
<p>that my voice was really awful for her to listen to,</p>
<p>not to make me feel bad or for any other reason,</p>
<p>except that she wanted it to not be the case.</p>
<p>And she knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to stop talking.</p>
<p>So she decided to call it</p>
<p>to her consciousness and mine as well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>If you want to learn something</p>
<p>or you want to change your nervous system in any way,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s because of some impairment</p>
<p>or because of something that you want to acquire,</p>
<p>a cognitive skill, a motor skill, an emotional skill,</p>
<p>the first thing is recognizing what that thing is.</p>
<p>And that often can be the hardest thing to identify.</p>
<p>But the brain has these self-recognition mechanisms.</p>
<p>And those self-recognition mechanisms are not vague,</p>
<p>spiritual, or mystical, or even psychological concepts.</p>
<p>They are neurochemicals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk next about the neurochemicals</p>
<p>that stamp down particular behaviors</p>
<p>and thoughts and emotional patterns</p>
<p>and tell the rest of the nervous system,</p>
<p>this is something to pay attention to,</p>
<p>because this is in the direction of the change</p>
<p>that I want to make.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll repeat that.</p>
<p>There are specific chemicals</p>
<p>that when we are consciously aware</p>
<p>of a change we want to make,</p>
<p>or even just that we want to make some change,</p>
<p>chemicals are released in the brain</p>
<p>that allow us the opportunity to make those changes.</p>
<p>Now, there are specific protocols</p>
<p>that science tells us we have to follow</p>
<p>if we want those changes to occur.</p>
<p>But that self-recognition is not a kind of murky concept.</p>
<p>What it is, is it&rsquo;s our forebrain,</p>
<p>in particular, our prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>signaling the rest of our nervous system</p>
<p>that something that we&rsquo;re about to do, hear, feel,</p>
<p>or experience is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll pause there, and then I&rsquo;m going to move forward.</p>
<p>One of the biggest lies in the universe</p>
<p>that seems quite prominent right now</p>
<p>is that every experience you have changes your brain.</p>
<p>People love to say this.</p>
<p>They love to say,</p>
<p>your brain is going to be different after this lecture,</p>
<p>that your brain is going to be different</p>
<p>after today&rsquo;s class than it was two days ago.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s absolutely not true.</p>
<p>The nervous system doesn&rsquo;t just change</p>
<p>because you experience something,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re a very young child.</p>
<p>The nervous system changes</p>
<p>when certain neurochemicals are released</p>
<p>and allow whatever neurons are active in the period</p>
<p>in which those chemicals are swimming around</p>
<p>to strengthen or weaken the connections of those neurons.</p>
<p>Now, this is best illustrated</p>
<p>through a little bit of scientific history.</p>
<p>The whole basis of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>is essentially ascribed to two individuals,</p>
<p>although there were a lot more people</p>
<p>that were involved in this work.</p>
<p>Those two individuals go by the name</p>
<p>David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel.</p>
<p>David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel</p>
<p>started off at Johns Hopkins,</p>
<p>moved to Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>And in the 70s and 80s,</p>
<p>they did a series of experiments</p>
<p>recording electrical activity in the brain.</p>
<p>They were in the visual cortex,</p>
<p>meaning they put the electrodes in the visual cortex.</p>
<p>And they were exploring how vision works</p>
<p>and how the visual brain organizes</p>
<p>all the features of the visual world</p>
<p>to give us these incredible things</p>
<p>we call visual perceptions.</p>
<p>But Hubel was a physician</p>
<p>and he was very interested in what happens</p>
<p>when, for instance, a child comes into the world</p>
<p>and they have a cataract.</p>
<p>The lens of their eye isn&rsquo;t clear, but it&rsquo;s opaque.</p>
<p>Or when a kid has a lazy eye</p>
<p>or the eyes have what&rsquo;s called strabismus,</p>
<p>which is when the eyes either deviate outward or inward.</p>
<p>These are very common things of childhood,</p>
<p>especially in particular areas of the world.</p>
<p>And what David and Torsten did is they figured out</p>
<p>that there was a critical period</p>
<p>in which if clear vision did not occur,</p>
<p>the visual brain would completely rewire itself</p>
<p>basically to represent</p>
<p>whatever bit of visual information was coming in.</p>
<p>So they did these experiments</p>
<p>that kind of simulate a droopy eye or a deviating eye</p>
<p>where they would close one eyelid.</p>
<p>And then what they found is that the visual brain</p>
<p>would respond entirely to the open eye.</p>
<p>There was sort of a takeover of the visual brain</p>
<p>representing the open eye.</p>
<p>Many experiments in many different sensory systems</p>
<p>followed up on this.</p>
<p>There are beautiful experiments, for instance,</p>
<p>from Greg Rechenzone&rsquo;s lab up at UC Davis</p>
<p>and Mike Merzenich&rsquo;s labs at UCSF</p>
<p>showing that for instance,</p>
<p>if two fingers were taped together early in development,</p>
<p>so they weren&rsquo;t moving independently,</p>
<p>the representation of those two fingers</p>
<p>would become fused in the brain</p>
<p>so that the person couldn&rsquo;t actually distinguish</p>
<p>the movements and the sensations</p>
<p>of the two fingers separately.</p>
<p>Pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that David and Torsten&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>for which they won a Nobel prize,</p>
<p>they shared it with Roger Sperry,</p>
<p>their work showed that the brain is in fact</p>
<p>a customized map of the outside world,</p>
<p>we said that already,</p>
<p>but that what it&rsquo;s doing is it&rsquo;s measuring</p>
<p>the amount of activity for a given part of our body,</p>
<p>one eye or the other,</p>
<p>or our fingers, this finger or that finger,</p>
<p>and all of those inputs are competing</p>
<p>for space in the brain.</p>
<p>Now, this is fundamentally important</p>
<p>because what it means is that</p>
<p>if we are to change our nervous system in adulthood,</p>
<p>we need to think about not just what we&rsquo;re trying to get,</p>
<p>but what we&rsquo;re trying to give up.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t actually add new connections</p>
<p>without removing something else.</p>
<p>And that might seem like kind of a stinger,</p>
<p>but it actually turns out to be a great advantage.</p>
<p>One of the key experiments that David and Torsten did</p>
<p>was an experiment where they closed both eyes,</p>
<p>where they essentially removed all visual input</p>
<p>early in development.</p>
<p>Now, this is slightly different than blindness</p>
<p>because it was transient,</p>
<p>it was only for a short period of time,</p>
<p>but what they found is when they did that,</p>
<p>there was no change.</p>
<p>However, if they closed just one eye,</p>
<p>there was a huge change.</p>
<p>So when people tell you,</p>
<p>oh, at the end of today&rsquo;s lecture,</p>
<p>or at the end of something,</p>
<p>your brain is going to be completely different,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s simply not true.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re older than 25,</p>
<p>your brain will not change</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s a selective shift in your attention</p>
<p>or a selective shift in your experience</p>
<p>that tells the brain it&rsquo;s time to change.</p>
<p>And those changes occur</p>
<p>through the ways I talked about before,</p>
<p>strengthening and weakening of particular connections.</p>
<p>They have names like long-term potentiation,</p>
<p>long-term depression,</p>
<p>which has nothing to do with emotional depression,</p>
<p>by the way, spike timing dependent plasticity.</p>
<p>I threw out those names not to confuse you,</p>
<p>but for those of you that would like</p>
<p>more in-depth exploration of those,</p>
<p>please, you can go Google those and look them up.</p>
<p>There are great Wikipedia pages for them</p>
<p>and you can go down the paper trail.</p>
<p>I might even touch on them in some subsequent episodes.</p>
<p>But the important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that if we want something to change,</p>
<p>we really need to bring an immense amount of attention</p>
<p>to whatever it is that we want to change.</p>
<p>This is very much linked to the statement I made earlier</p>
<p>about it all starts with an awareness.</p>
<p>Now, why is that attention important?</p>
<p>Well, David and Tornstein won their Nobel prize</p>
<p>and they certainly deserved it.</p>
<p>They probably deserve two</p>
<p>because they also figured out how vision works.</p>
<p>And I might be biased</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re my scientific great-grandparents,</p>
<p>but I think everybody in the field of neuroscience agrees</p>
<p>that Hubel and Wiesel, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>H and W for those in the game,</p>
<p>absolutely deserved a Nobel prize for their work</p>
<p>because they really unveiled the mechanisms</p>
<p>of brain change, of plasticity.</p>
<p>David passed away a few years ago.</p>
<p>Tornstein&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in his late nineties.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still at the Rockefeller University.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sharp as a tack.</p>
<p>He still jogs several miles a day.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really into art and a number of other things.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a super nice guy.</p>
<p>Hubel was a really nice guy as well.</p>
<p>Also, he was a great Frisbee player, I discovered,</p>
<p>because he beat me in a game of ultimate</p>
<p>when he was like 80,</p>
<p>which still has me a little bit irked.</p>
<p>But anyway, Hubel and Wiesel did an amazing thing</p>
<p>for science that will forever change the way</p>
<p>that we think about the brain.</p>
<p>However, they were quite wrong</p>
<p>about this critical period thing.</p>
<p>The critical period was this idea</p>
<p>that if you were to deprive the nervous system of an input,</p>
<p>say closing one eye early in development</p>
<p>and the rest of the visual cortex is taken over</p>
<p>by the representation of the open eye,</p>
<p>that you could never change that unless you intervened early.</p>
<p>And this actually formed the basis</p>
<p>for why a kid that has a lazy eye or a cataract,</p>
<p>why even though there&rsquo;s some issues</p>
<p>with anesthesia in young children,</p>
<p>why now we know that you want to get in there early</p>
<p>and fix the cataract or fix the strabismus,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what ophthalmologists do.</p>
<p>However, their idea that you had to do it early</p>
<p>or else there was no opportunity</p>
<p>to rescue the nervous system deficit later on,</p>
<p>turned out wasn&rsquo;t entirely true.</p>
<p>In the early 90s, a graduate student</p>
<p>by the name of Greg Reckonzone was in the laboratory</p>
<p>of a guy named Mike Merzenich at UCSF.</p>
<p>And they set out to test this idea</p>
<p>that if one wants to change their brain,</p>
<p>they need to do it early in life</p>
<p>because the adult brain simply isn&rsquo;t plastic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not available for these changes.</p>
<p>And they did a series of absolutely beautiful experiments.</p>
<p>By now, I think we can say proving</p>
<p>that the adult brain can change</p>
<p>provided certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>Now, the experiments they did are tough.</p>
<p>They were tough on the experimenter</p>
<p>and they were tough on the subject.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just describe one.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you were a subject in one of their experiments.</p>
<p>You would come into the lab and you&rsquo;d sit down at a table</p>
<p>and they would record from or image your brain</p>
<p>and look at the representation of your fingers,</p>
<p>the digits as we call them.</p>
<p>And there would be a spinning drum,</p>
<p>literally like a stone drum in front of you</p>
<p>or metal drum that had little bumps.</p>
<p>Some of the bumps were spaced close together,</p>
<p>some of them were spaced far apart.</p>
<p>And they would do these experiments</p>
<p>where they would expect their subjects to press a lever</p>
<p>whenever, for instance, the bumps got closer together</p>
<p>or further apart.</p>
<p>And these were very subtle differences.</p>
<p>So in order to do this,</p>
<p>you really have to pay attention</p>
<p>to the distance between the bumps.</p>
<p>And these were not braille readers</p>
<p>or anyone skilled in doing these kinds of experiments.</p>
<p>What they found was that as people paid</p>
<p>more and more attention to the distance between these bumps,</p>
<p>and they would signal when there was a change</p>
<p>by pressing a lever,</p>
<p>as they did that, there was very rapid changes,</p>
<p>plasticity in the representation of the fingers.</p>
<p>And it could go in either direction.</p>
<p>You could get people very good</p>
<p>at detecting the distance between bumps</p>
<p>that the distance was getting smaller</p>
<p>or the distance was getting greater.</p>
<p>So people could get very good at these tasks</p>
<p>that are kind of hard to imagine</p>
<p>how they would translate to the real world</p>
<p>for a non-braille reader.</p>
<p>But what it told us is that these maps of touch</p>
<p>were very much available for plasticity.</p>
<p>And these were fully adult subjects.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not taking any specific drugs.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any impairments that we&rsquo;re aware of.</p>
<p>And what it showed,</p>
<p>what it proved is that the adult brain is very plastic.</p>
<p>And they did some beautiful control experiments</p>
<p>that are important for everyone to understand,</p>
<p>which is that sometimes they would bring people in</p>
<p>and they would have them touch these bumps</p>
<p>on this spinning drum,</p>
<p>but they would have the person pay attention</p>
<p>to an auditory cue.</p>
<p>Every time a tone would go off</p>
<p>or there was a shift in the pitch of that tone,</p>
<p>they would have to signal that.</p>
<p>So the subject thought they were doing something</p>
<p>related to touch and hearing.</p>
<p>And all that showed was that it wasn&rsquo;t just the mere action</p>
<p>of touching these bumps.</p>
<p>They had to pay attention to the bumps themselves.</p>
<p>If they were placing their attention</p>
<p>on the auditory cue on the tone,</p>
<p>well, then there was plasticity</p>
<p>in the auditory portion of the brain,</p>
<p>but not on the touch portion of the brain.</p>
<p>And this really spits in the face of this thing</p>
<p>that you hear so often,</p>
<p>which is every experience that you have</p>
<p>is going to change the way your brain works.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>The experiences that you pay super careful attention to</p>
<p>are what open up plasticity.</p>
<p>And it opens up plasticity to that specific experience.</p>
<p>So the question then is why?</p>
<p>And Merzenich and his graduate students and postdocs</p>
<p>went on to address this question of why.</p>
<p>And it turns out the answer</p>
<p>is a very straightforward neurochemical answer.</p>
<p>And inside of that answer is the opportunity</p>
<p>for any of us to change our brain at any point</p>
<p>throughout our lifespan,</p>
<p>essentially for anything that we want to learn.</p>
<p>That could be subtracting an emotion</p>
<p>from an experience we&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>It could be building a greater range of emotion.</p>
<p>It could be learning new information,</p>
<p>like learning a new language.</p>
<p>It could be learning new motor skill,</p>
<p>like dance or sport,</p>
<p>or it could be some combination of cognitive motor.</p>
<p>So for instance, an air traffic controller</p>
<p>has to do a lot with their mind</p>
<p>in addition to a lot with their hands.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just cognitive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just motor, but combined.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about what that chemical is,</p>
<p>but to just give you an important hint,</p>
<p>that chemical is the same chemical of stress.</p>
<p>This is not a discussion about stress per se.</p>
<p>In a future podcast episode,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk all about stress and tools to deal with stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something my lab works on quite extensively.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a topic that I enjoy discussing.</p>
<p>But this is a topic about brain change.</p>
<p>And what I just told you is that</p>
<p>in order to change the brain,</p>
<p>you have to pay careful attention.</p>
<p>And the immediate question should be, well, why?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is that when we pay careful attention,</p>
<p>there are two neurochemicals,</p>
<p>neuromodulators as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>that are released from multiple sites in our brain</p>
<p>that highlight the neural circuits</p>
<p>that stand a chance of changing.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not necessarily the case</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to change,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the first gate that has to open</p>
<p>in order for change to occur.</p>
<p>And the first neurochemical is epinephrine, also adrenaline.</p>
<p>We call it adrenaline when it&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>from the adrenal glands above our kidneys.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the body.</p>
<p>We call it epinephrine in the brain,</p>
<p>but they are chemically identical substances.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is released from a region in the brainstem</p>
<p>called locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>Fancy name, you don&rsquo;t need to know it unless you want to.</p>
<p>Locus coeruleus sends out these little wires we call axons</p>
<p>such that it hoses the entire brain essentially</p>
<p>in this neurochemical epinephrine.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not always hosing the brain with epinephrine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when we are in high states of alertness</p>
<p>that this epinephrine is released.</p>
<p>But the way this circuit is designed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very nonspecific.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially waking up the entire brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the way that epinephrine works</p>
<p>by binding particular receptors</p>
<p>is to increase the likelihood that neurons will be active.</p>
<p>So no alertness, no neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>However, alertness alone is not sufficient.</p>
<p>As we would say, it&rsquo;s necessary</p>
<p>but not sufficient for neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>We know this is true also from the work of Hubel and Wiesel</p>
<p>where they looked at brain plasticity</p>
<p>in response to certain experiences</p>
<p>in subjects that were either awake or asleep.</p>
<p>And I hate to break it to you,</p>
<p>but you cannot just simply listen to things in your sleep</p>
<p>and learn those materials.</p>
<p>Later, I&rsquo;ll talk about how you can do certain things</p>
<p>in your sleep that you&rsquo;re unaware of</p>
<p>that can enhance learning of things</p>
<p>that you were aware of while you were awake.</p>
<p>But that is not the same as just listening to some music</p>
<p>or listening to a tape while you sleep</p>
<p>and expecting it to sink in, so to speak.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is released when we pay attention</p>
<p>and when we are alert.</p>
<p>But the most important thing for getting plasticity</p>
<p>is that there be epinephrine, which equates to alertness,</p>
<p>plus the release of this neuromodulator acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Now, acetylcholine is released from two sites in the brain.</p>
<p>One is also in the brainstem,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s named different things in different animals,</p>
<p>but in humans, the most rich site of acetylcholine neurons</p>
<p>or neurons that make acetylcholine</p>
<p>is the parabigeminal nucleus or the parabrachial region.</p>
<p>There are a number of different names</p>
<p>of these aggregates of neurons.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know the names.</p>
<p>All you need to know</p>
<p>is that you have an area in your brainstem</p>
<p>and that area sends wires, these axons,</p>
<p>up into the area of the brain that filters sensory input.</p>
<p>So we have this area of the brain called the thalamus,</p>
<p>and it is getting bombarded</p>
<p>with all sorts of sensory input all the time.</p>
<p>Costello&rsquo;s snoring off to my right,</p>
<p>the lights that are in the room,</p>
<p>the presence of my computer to my left.</p>
<p>All of that is coming in.</p>
<p>But when I pay attention to something,</p>
<p>like if I really hone in on Costello&rsquo;s snoring,</p>
<p>I create a cone of attention.</p>
<p>And what that cone of attention reflects</p>
<p>is that acetylcholine is now amplifying the signal</p>
<p>of sounds that Costello is making with his snoring</p>
<p>and essentially making that signal greater</p>
<p>than all the signal around it.</p>
<p>What we call signal-to-noise goes up.</p>
<p>So those of you with an engineering background</p>
<p>will be familiar with signal-to-noise.</p>
<p>Those of you who do not have an engineering background,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>All it means is that one particular shout</p>
<p>in the crowd comes through,</p>
<p>Costello&rsquo;s snoring becomes more salient,</p>
<p>more apparent relative to everything else going on.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine acts as a spotlight.</p>
<p>But epinephrine, for alertness,</p>
<p>acetylcholine spotlighting these inputs,</p>
<p>those two things alone are not enough to get plasticity.</p>
<p>There needs to be this third component.</p>
<p>And the third component is acetylcholine released</p>
<p>from an area of the forebrain called nucleus basalis.</p>
<p>If you really want to get technical,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called nucleus basalis of my nert.</p>
<p>For any of you that are budding physicians</p>
<p>or going to medical school, you should know that.</p>
<p>If you have acetylcholine released from the brainstem,</p>
<p>acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis and epinephrine,</p>
<p>you can change your brain.</p>
<p>And I can say that with confidence</p>
<p>because Merzenich and Reckinzone,</p>
<p>as well as other members of the Merzenich lab,</p>
<p>Michael Kilgard and others,</p>
<p>did these incredible experiments</p>
<p>where they stimulated the release of acetylcholine</p>
<p>from nucleus basalis, either with an electrode</p>
<p>or with some other methods that we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>And what they found was when you stimulate</p>
<p>these three brain regions, locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>the brainstem source of acetylcholine,</p>
<p>and then the basal forebrain source of acetylcholine,</p>
<p>when you have those three things,</p>
<p>whatever you happen to be listening to,</p>
<p>doing or paying attention to,</p>
<p>immediately in one trial takes over the representation</p>
<p>of a particular area of the brain.</p>
<p>You essentially get rapid, massive learning in one shot.</p>
<p>And this has been shown again and again and again</p>
<p>in a variety of papers,</p>
<p>also by a guy named Norm Weinberger from UC Irvine.</p>
<p>And it is now considered a fundamental principle</p>
<p>of how the nervous system works.</p>
<p>So while Hubel and Wiesel talked about critical periods</p>
<p>in developmental plasticity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear from the work of Merzenich</p>
<p>and Weinberg and others,</p>
<p>that if you get these three things,</p>
<p>if you can access these three things</p>
<p>of epinephrine, acetylcholine from these two sources,</p>
<p>not only will the nervous system change, it has to change.</p>
<p>It absolutely will change.</p>
<p>And that is the most important thing</p>
<p>for people to understand if they want to change their brain.</p>
<p>You cannot just passively experience things.</p>
<p>And repetition can be important,</p>
<p>but the way to use repetition to change your brain</p>
<p>is fundamentally different.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about how we would translate</p>
<p>all the scientific information and history</p>
<p>into some protocols that you can actually apply,</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s what many of you are interested in.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m willing to bet that most of you</p>
<p>are not interested in lowering electrodes</p>
<p>into your nucleus basalis, and frankly, neither am I.</p>
<p>In episode one of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>I described the various ways that people can monitor</p>
<p>and change their nervous system.</p>
<p>Those ways include brain machine interface,</p>
<p>pharmacology, behavioral practices,</p>
<p>and those behavioral practices, of course,</p>
<p>can include some dos, do this, and some don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that, et cetera.</p>
<p>In thinking about neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>I want to have a very frank conversation</p>
<p>about what one can do,</p>
<p>but also acknowledge this untapped capacity</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m just not hearing about out there,</p>
<p>which is one can also combine behavioral practices</p>
<p>with pharmacology.</p>
<p>One can combine behavioral practices</p>
<p>with brain machine interface.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m not recommending you do anything in particular.</p>
<p>As always, I&rsquo;ll say it again, I&rsquo;m not a physician,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor, so I profess a lot of things.</p>
<p>What you do with your health and your medical care</p>
<p>is up to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re responsible for your health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what to do or what to take.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to describe what the literature tells us</p>
<p>and suggests about ways to access plasticity.</p>
<p>We know we need epinephrine.</p>
<p>That means alertness.</p>
<p>Most people accomplish this through a cup of coffee</p>
<p>and a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>So I will say you should master your sleep schedule</p>
<p>and you should figure out how much sleep you need</p>
<p>in order to achieve alertness when you sit down to learn.</p>
<p>All the tools and more science</p>
<p>than probably you ever wanted to hear about sleep</p>
<p>and how to get better at sleeping and timing your sleep,</p>
<p>et cetera, and naps, and all of that</p>
<p>is in episodes two, three, four, and five</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>So I encourage you to refer to those</p>
<p>if your sleep is not where you would like it to be.</p>
<p>Your ability to engage in deliberate focused alertness</p>
<p>is in direct proportion to how well you are sleeping</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of an obvious one.</p>
<p>So get your sleep handled.</p>
<p>But once that&rsquo;s in place,</p>
<p>the question then is how do I access this alertness?</p>
<p>Well, there are a number of ways.</p>
<p>Some people use some pretty elaborate</p>
<p>psychological gymnastics.</p>
<p>They will tell people that they&rsquo;re going to do something</p>
<p>and create some accountability.</p>
<p>That could be really good.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;ll post a picture of themselves online</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll commit to losing a certain amount of weight</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>So they can use either shame-based practices</p>
<p>to potentially embarrass themselves</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t follow through.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll write checks to organizations that they hate</p>
<p>and insist that they&rsquo;ll cash them</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t actually follow through.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;ll do it out of love.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll decide that they&rsquo;re going to run a marathon</p>
<p>or learn a language or something</p>
<p>because of somebody they love</p>
<p>or they want to devote it to somebody.</p>
<p>The truth is that from the standpoint of epinephrine</p>
<p>and getting alert and activated,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is a chemical</p>
<p>and your brain does not distinguish</p>
<p>between doing things out of love or hate, anger, or fear.</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>All of those promote autonomic arousal</p>
<p>and the release of epinephrine.</p>
<p>So I think for most people,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re feeling not motivated to make these changes,</p>
<p>the key thing is to identify not just one</p>
<p>but probably a kit of reasons,</p>
<p>several reasons as to why you would want</p>
<p>to make this particular change.</p>
<p>And being drawn toward a particular goal</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re excited about can be one.</p>
<p>Also being motivated to not be completely afraid,</p>
<p>ashamed, or humiliated for not falling through</p>
<p>on a goal is another.</p>
<p>Just want to briefly mention one little aside there</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve got a friend who&rsquo;s a physician.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a cardiologist who has a really interesting theory.</p>
<p>This is just theory,</p>
<p>but I think it will resonate with a lot of people,</p>
<p>which is that you&rsquo;ve all heard of this molecule dopamine</p>
<p>that gives us this sense of reward</p>
<p>when we accomplish something.</p>
<p>Well, we also want to be able to access dopamine</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re working towards things.</p>
<p>Enjoy the process, as they say,</p>
<p>because it has all sorts of positive effects.</p>
<p>It gives us energy, et cetera.</p>
<p>With my friend, what he says is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many, many instances where someone will come to him</p>
<p>and say, you know what, I&rsquo;m going to write a book.</p>
<p>And he says, oh, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the book&rsquo;s going to be terrific</p>
<p>and you really should write a book.</p>
<p>And then they never go do it.</p>
<p>And his theory is if you get so much dopamine</p>
<p>from the reward of people saying,</p>
<p>oh yeah, you&rsquo;re absolutely going to be able to do that,</p>
<p>you might not actually go after the reward</p>
<p>of the accomplishment itself.</p>
<p>So beware these positive reinforcements also.</p>
<p>Not saying people should flagellate themselves</p>
<p>to the point of victory in whatever they&rsquo;re pursuing,</p>
<p>but motivation is a tricky one.</p>
<p>So I suggest that everyone asks themselves,</p>
<p>what is it that I want to accomplish?</p>
<p>And what is it that&rsquo;s driving me to accomplish this?</p>
<p>And come up with two or three things,</p>
<p>fear-based perhaps, love-based perhaps,</p>
<p>or perhaps several of those,</p>
<p>in order to ensure alertness,</p>
<p>energy, and attention for the task.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the attention part.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s one thing to have an electrode</p>
<p>embedded into your brain</p>
<p>and increase the amount of acetylcholine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another to exist in the real world</p>
<p>outside the laboratory and have trouble focusing,</p>
<p>having trouble bringing your attention</p>
<p>to a particular location in space for a particular event.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion nowadays</p>
<p>about smartphones and devices</p>
<p>creating a sort of attention deficit,</p>
<p>almost at a clinical level for many people,</p>
<p>including adults.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s largely true.</p>
<p>And what it means, however,</p>
<p>is that we all are responsible for learning</p>
<p>how to create depth of focus.</p>
<p>There are some important neuroscience principles</p>
<p>to get depth of focus.</p>
<p>I want to briefly talk about the pharmacology first,</p>
<p>because I always get asked about this.</p>
<p>People say, what can I take</p>
<p>to increase my levels of acetylcholine?</p>
<p>Well, there are things you can take.</p>
<p>Nicotine is called nicotine</p>
<p>because acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptor.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of acetylcholine receptors,</p>
<p>muscarinic and nicotinic,</p>
<p>but the nicotinic ones are involved</p>
<p>in attention and alertness.</p>
<p>I have colleagues, these are not my,</p>
<p>you know, kind of like bro science buddies.</p>
<p>I have those friends too.</p>
<p>This is a Nobel prize winning colleague</p>
<p>who chews Nicorette while he works.</p>
<p>He used to be a smoker.</p>
<p>He quit smoking because of fear of lung cancer.</p>
<p>So like a smart choice,</p>
<p>but he missed the level of focus</p>
<p>that he could bring to his work.</p>
<p>This is somebody who&rsquo;s had a very long career.</p>
<p>And if you ever meet with him,</p>
<p>unfortunately I can&rsquo;t name him.</p>
<p>If you ever meet with him,</p>
<p>what you realize is he chews</p>
<p>about five pieces of Nicorette an hour,</p>
<p>which I am not suggesting people do.</p>
<p>But when I asked him, why are you doing this?</p>
<p>He said, well, increases my alertness and focus.</p>
<p>And also his theory,</p>
<p>and I want to really underscore that it&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>not scientifically supported yet</p>
<p>is that it offsets Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It is true that nucleus basalis is the primary site</p>
<p>of degeneration in the brain</p>
<p>in people that have dementia and Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what leads to a lot of their inability</p>
<p>to focus their attention,</p>
<p>not just deficits in plasticity.</p>
<p>So he might be onto something.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve tried chewing Nicorette.</p>
<p>It makes me super jittery.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it because I can&rsquo;t focus very well.</p>
<p>It kind of takes me too far up</p>
<p>the level of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got friends that dip Nicorette all day,</p>
<p>some of whom are scientists,</p>
<p>writers and artists and musicians</p>
<p>are familiar with the effects of nicotine</p>
<p>from the era where a lot of people smoked</p>
<p>and fortunately fewer people smoke now.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in the pharmacology,</p>
<p>there are supplements and things</p>
<p>that can increase cholinergic transmission in the brain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting you do this,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re going to go down that route,</p>
<p>you want to be very careful</p>
<p>how much you rely on those all the time,</p>
<p>because the essence of plasticity</p>
<p>is to create a window of attention and focus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s distinct from the rest of your day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to create a mark in your brain</p>
<p>and the potential for plasticity.</p>
<p>Things that increase acetylcholine besides nicotine</p>
<p>or Nicorette, the nicotine could come</p>
<p>from a variety of sources,</p>
<p>or things like alpha-GPC or choline.</p>
<p>There are a number of these things.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to go to examine.com, the website,</p>
<p>and just put in acetylcholine,</p>
<p>and it will give you a list of supplements</p>
<p>as well as some of the dangers of these supplements</p>
<p>that are associated with cholinergic transmission.</p>
<p>But I would be remiss and I would be lying</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t say that there are a lot of people out there</p>
<p>who are using cholinergic drugs</p>
<p>in order to increase their level of focus.</p>
<p>And since we&rsquo;re coming up on the Olympics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get anyone in trouble,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m well aware that the fact that the sprinters</p>
<p>are really into cholinergic drugs</p>
<p>because not only is acetylcholine important</p>
<p>for the focus that allows them to hear the gun</p>
<p>and be first out the blocks on the sprints.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of where the race is won.</p>
<p>Hearing that gun and being quickest on reaction time.</p>
<p>So they take cholinergic agents for that.</p>
<p>As well as acetylcholine is the molecule</p>
<p>that controls nerve to muscle contraction.</p>
<p>So your speed of reflexes is actually controlled</p>
<p>by this nicotinic transmission as well.</p>
<p>So lots to think about in terms of acetylcholine in sport</p>
<p>and mental acuity, not just plasticity.</p>
<p>Now, for most of you,</p>
<p>you probably don&rsquo;t want to chew Nicorette,</p>
<p>definitely don&rsquo;t want to smoke cigarettes</p>
<p>or take supplements for increasing acetylcholine.</p>
<p>So what are some ways that you can increase acetylcholine?</p>
<p>And there it&rsquo;s going to sound like a bit</p>
<p>of a circular argument, but you want to increase focus.</p>
<p>How do you increase focus?</p>
<p>You know, people are so familiar with sitting down,</p>
<p>reading a couple of pages of a book</p>
<p>and realizing that none of it sunk in.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking to someone and seeing their mouth move,</p>
<p>maybe even nodding your head subconsciously</p>
<p>and go, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And none of it sinks in.</p>
<p>This can be very damaging for school,</p>
<p>work performance and relationships, as many of you know.</p>
<p>Costello, incidentally, never seems to pay attention</p>
<p>to anything I say while looking directly at me,</p>
<p>which contradicts what I&rsquo;m about to say,</p>
<p>which is that the best way to get better at focusing</p>
<p>is to use the mechanisms of focus that you were born with.</p>
<p>And the key principle here is that mental focus</p>
<p>follows visual focus.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with the fact that our visual system</p>
<p>can be unfocused, blurry, or jumping around,</p>
<p>or we can be very laser focused on one location in space.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting and vitally important</p>
<p>to understanding how to access neuroplasticity</p>
<p>is that you can use your visual focus</p>
<p>and you can increase your visual focus</p>
<p>as a way of increasing your mental focus abilities</p>
<p>more broadly.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to explain how to do that.</p>
<p>Plasticity starts with alertness.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>that alertness can come from a sense of love,</p>
<p>a sense of joy, a sense of fear, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>There are pharmacologic ways to access alertness too.</p>
<p>The most common one is, of course, caffeine,</p>
<p>which if you watch the sleep episodes,</p>
<p>you know reduces this molecule that makes us sleepy</p>
<p>called adenosine.</p>
<p>I drink plenty of caffeine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a heavy user of caffeine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think abuser of caffeine.</p>
<p>I think in reasonable amounts,</p>
<p>provided we can still fall asleep at night,</p>
<p>caffeine can be a relatively safe way</p>
<p>to increase epinephrine.</p>
<p>Now, many people are now also using Adderall.</p>
<p>Adderall chemically looks a lot like amphetamine.</p>
<p>And basically it is amphetamine.</p>
<p>It will increase epinephrine release from locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>It will wake up the brain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why a lot of people rely on it.</p>
<p>It does have a heavy basis for use</p>
<p>in certain clinical syndromes prescribed,</p>
<p>such as attention deficit.</p>
<p>However, it also has a high probability of abuse,</p>
<p>especially in those who are not prescribed it.</p>
<p>Adderall will not increase focus.</p>
<p>It increases alertness.</p>
<p>It does not touch the acetylcholine system.</p>
<p>And if those of you that are taking Adderall say,</p>
<p>well, it really increases my focus overall,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably because your autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>is just veering towards what we call parasympathetic.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really just very sleepy.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s bringing your levels of alertness up.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, Adderall is very problematic</p>
<p>for a number of people.</p>
<p>It can be habit forming.</p>
<p>Learning on Adderall does not always translate</p>
<p>to high performance off or on Adderall at later times.</p>
<p>And the Adderall discussion is a broader one</p>
<p>that perhaps we should have</p>
<p>with a psychiatrist in the room at some point</p>
<p>because it is a very widely abused drug</p>
<p>at this point in time.</p>
<p>The acetylcholine system and the focus that it brings</p>
<p>is available, as I mentioned, through pharmacology,</p>
<p>but also through these behavioral practices.</p>
<p>And the behavioral practices that are anchored</p>
<p>in visual focus are going to be the ones</p>
<p>that are going to allow you to develop great depth</p>
<p>and duration of focus.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about visual focus for a second.</p>
<p>When we focus on something visually, we have two options.</p>
<p>We can either look at a very small region of space</p>
<p>with a lot of detail and a lot of precision,</p>
<p>or we can dilate our gaze and we can see big pieces</p>
<p>of visual space with very little detail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a trade-off.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t look at everything at high resolution.</p>
<p>This is why we have the pupil more or less relates</p>
<p>to the fovea of the eye, which is the area</p>
<p>in which we have the most receptors,</p>
<p>the highest density of receptors that perceive light.</p>
<p>And so our acuity is much better in the center</p>
<p>of our visual field than in our periphery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple experiment you can do right now.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening to this, you can still do it.</p>
<p>You can hold your hands out in front of you,</p>
<p>provided that you&rsquo;re sighted, you should be able</p>
<p>to see how many fingers you have in front of you.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s five, still got all five fingers,</p>
<p>amazingly enough.</p>
<p>If I move my hand off to the side,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see them with precision, but as I move them back</p>
<p>into the center of my visual field,</p>
<p>I can see them with precision.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the density, the number of pixels</p>
<p>in the center of my visual field is much higher</p>
<p>than it is in the periphery.</p>
<p>When we focus our eyes, we do a couple things.</p>
<p>First of all, we tend to do that in the center</p>
<p>of our visual field, and our two eyes tend to align</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called a vergence eye movement</p>
<p>towards a common point.</p>
<p>The other thing that happens is the lens of our eye moves</p>
<p>so that our brain now no longer sees the entire visual world</p>
<p>but is seeing a small cone of visual imagery.</p>
<p>If it, that was the dog bumping into the wall, forgive me.</p>
<p>That small cone of visual imagery</p>
<p>or soda straw view of the world has much higher acuity,</p>
<p>higher resolution than if I were to look at everything.</p>
<p>Now you say, of course, this makes perfect sense,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s about visual attention, not mental attention.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that focus in the brain</p>
<p>is anchored to our visual system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about blind people in a moment,</p>
<p>but assuming that somebody is sighted,</p>
<p>the key is to learn how to focus better visually</p>
<p>if you want to bring about higher levels</p>
<p>of cognitive or mental focus,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re engaged in a physical task.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a remarkable phenomenon in animals</p>
<p>where animals that have their eyes on the side of their head</p>
<p>are scanning the entire visual environment all the time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not focused on anything.</p>
<p>Think you&rsquo;re grazing animals, your cows, your sheep,</p>
<p>your birds, et cetera.</p>
<p>But think about a bird picking up seeds on the beach</p>
<p>or on concrete.</p>
<p>That bird&rsquo;s head is up here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up about a foot off the ground,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s a small bird, about six inches off the ground,</p>
<p>and its eyes are on the side of its head,</p>
<p>and yet it has this tiny beak that can quickly pick up</p>
<p>these little seeds off the ground with immense precision.</p>
<p>Now, if you try to do that</p>
<p>by staring off to the sides of the room</p>
<p>and picking up items in front of you with high precision</p>
<p>at that tiny scale, little tiny objects,</p>
<p>you will miss almost every time.</p>
<p>They do it perfectly,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t smash their beak into the ground</p>
<p>and damage it.</p>
<p>They do it with beautiful movement acuity also.</p>
<p>So how do they do it?</p>
<p>How do they create this focus</p>
<p>or this awareness of what&rsquo;s in front of them?</p>
<p>It turns out as they lower their head,</p>
<p>their eyes very briefly move inward</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called a virgin&rsquo;s eye movement.</p>
<p>Now, their eyes can&rsquo;t actually translocate in their head.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fixed in the skull, just like yours and mine are.</p>
<p>But when we move our eyes slightly inward,</p>
<p>maybe you can tell that I&rsquo;m doing it like so,</p>
<p>basically shortening or making the interpupillary distance,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called, smaller, two things happen.</p>
<p>Not only do we develop a smaller visual window</p>
<p>into the world,</p>
<p>but we activate a set of neurons in our brainstem</p>
<p>that trigger the release of both norepinephrine,</p>
<p>epinephrine, and acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine is kind of similar to epinephrine.</p>
<p>So in other words, when our eyes are relaxed in our head,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re just kind of looking</p>
<p>at our entire visual environment,</p>
<p>moving our head around, moving through space,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in optic flow, things moving past us,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re sitting still,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking broadly at our space, we&rsquo;re relaxed.</p>
<p>When our eyes move slightly inward</p>
<p>toward a particular visual target,</p>
<p>our visual world shrinks,</p>
<p>our level of visual focus goes up,</p>
<p>and we know that this relates</p>
<p>to the release of acetylcholine and epinephrine</p>
<p>at the relevant sites in the brain for plasticity.</p>
<p>Now, what this means is that</p>
<p>if you have a hard time focusing your mind</p>
<p>for sake of reading or for listening,</p>
<p>you need to practice,</p>
<p>and you can practice, focusing your visual system.</p>
<p>Now, this works best</p>
<p>if you practice focusing your visual system</p>
<p>at the precise distance from the work</p>
<p>that you intend to do for sake of plasticity.</p>
<p>So how would this look in the real world?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I am trying to concentrate</p>
<p>on something related to, I don&rsquo;t know, science.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading a science paper,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m having a hard time, it&rsquo;s not absorbing.</p>
<p>I might think that I&rsquo;m only looking</p>
<p>at the paper that I&rsquo;m reading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only looking at my screen,</p>
<p>but actually, my eyes are probably darting around a bit.</p>
<p>Experiments have been done on this.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m gathering information</p>
<p>from too many sources in the visual environment.</p>
<p>Now, presumably, because it&rsquo;s me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already had my coffee, I&rsquo;m hydrated,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m well-rested, I slept well,</p>
<p>and I still experience these challenges in focusing.</p>
<p>Spending just 60 to 120 seconds</p>
<p>focusing my visual attention on a small window of my screen,</p>
<p>meaning just on my screen with nothing on it,</p>
<p>but bringing my eyes to that particular location</p>
<p>increases not just my visual acuity for that location,</p>
<p>but it brings about an increase in activity</p>
<p>in a bunch of other brain areas that are associated</p>
<p>with gathering information from this location.</p>
<p>So put simply, if you want to improve your ability to focus,</p>
<p>practice visual focus.</p>
<p>Now, if you wear contacts or you wear corrective lenses,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You, of course, would want to use those.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to take those off and use a blurry image.</p>
<p>The finer the visual image,</p>
<p>and the more that you can hold your gaze</p>
<p>to that visual image,</p>
<p>the higher your levels of attention will be.</p>
<p>Many times on Instagram and here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been teased for not blinking very often.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a practiced thing.</p>
<p>We blink more as we get tired, which, as you hear it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably just say, duh.</p>
<p>As we get tired, the neurons in the brainstem</p>
<p>that are responsible for alertness</p>
<p>and that hold the eyelids open start to falter</p>
<p>and our eyelids start to close.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>The words, I could barely keep my eyes open,</p>
<p>which may be how you feel right now.</p>
<p>But assuming that you&rsquo;re paying attention and you&rsquo;re alert,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re very alert, your eyes are wide.</p>
<p>Your eyes are open.</p>
<p>And as you get tired, your eyelids start to close.</p>
<p>Blinks actually reset our perception of time and space.</p>
<p>This was shown in a beautiful paper in Current Biology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be sure to post the reference in the notes.</p>
<p>And blinking, of course, is necessary to lubricate the eyes.</p>
<p>People blink because their eyes might get dry.</p>
<p>But if you can keep focus by blinking less</p>
<p>and by focusing your eyes to a particular location,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably pretty creepy for you to experience</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p>But the more that you can do this,</p>
<p>the more that you can maintain a kind of a cone</p>
<p>or a tunnel of mental focus.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m sort of revealing my practice,</p>
<p>which is that I&rsquo;ve worked very hard</p>
<p>through blinking contests with my 14-year-old niece</p>
<p>who still beats me every time and it really bothers me,</p>
<p>but also just through my own self-practice</p>
<p>of learning to blink less and focus my visual attention</p>
<p>on a smaller region of space.</p>
<p>Now, for me, that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m mainly learning things on a computer screen.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to be doing sport,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite a bit different.</p>
<p>And we can discuss how you might translate that to sport.</p>
<p>In fact, in the next episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk all about how plasticity</p>
<p>and the focus mechanisms relate</p>
<p>to learning of movement practices and coordinated movements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an entire discussion unto itself,</p>
<p>but the same principle holds.</p>
<p>So we need alertness.</p>
<p>You can get that through mental tricks of motivation,</p>
<p>fear or love, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Pharmacology, please do it healthfully.</p>
<p>Caffeine, if that&rsquo;s in your practice.</p>
<p>Certainly want to be well hydrated.</p>
<p>That actually will increase alertness.</p>
<p>Having a very full bladder will increase alertness,</p>
<p>although you don&rsquo;t want your alertness to be so high.</p>
<p>Do that.</p>
<p>All you can think about is the fact</p>
<p>that you have to go urinate a bit</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s very distracting.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your alertness to go through the roof.</p>
<p>You need focus and visual focus is the primary way</p>
<p>in which we start to deploy these neurochemicals.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask, well, what about the experiment</p>
<p>where people were feeling this rotating drum</p>
<p>or listening to the auditory cue?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t involve vision at all.</p>
<p>Ah, if you look at people</p>
<p>who are learning things with their auditory system,</p>
<p>they will often close their eyes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a coincidence.</p>
<p>If somebody is listening very hard,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t ask them to look you directly in the eye</p>
<p>while also asking that they listen to you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually one of the worst ways</p>
<p>to get somebody to listen to you.</p>
<p>If you say, now, listen to me and look me in the eye,</p>
<p>the visual system will take over</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll see your mouth move,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re going to hear their thoughts</p>
<p>more than they&rsquo;re going to hear what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Closing the eyes is one of the best ways</p>
<p>to create a cone of auditory attention.</p>
<p>And this is what low vision or no vision folks do.</p>
<p>They have tremendous capacity to focus their attention</p>
<p>in particular locations.</p>
<p>Incidentally, does anyone know the two animals</p>
<p>that have the best hearing in the world?</p>
<p>The absolute best hearing,</p>
<p>many orders of magnitude better than humans.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s the elephant.</p>
<p>That might not surprise you.</p>
<p>They have huge ears.</p>
<p>And the moth, which probably will surprise you.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know that moths could hear,</p>
<p>but now it explains why they&rsquo;re so hard to catch.</p>
<p>If you are not sighted,</p>
<p>you learn how to do this with your hearing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who braille reads,</p>
<p>you learn how to do this with your fingers.</p>
<p>If you look at great piano players like Glenn Gould,</p>
<p>they oftentimes will turn their head to the side.</p>
<p>You think about some of the great musicians</p>
<p>that like Stevie Wonder that were blind, right?</p>
<p>He would look away</p>
<p>because he had no reason to look at the keys,</p>
<p>but oftentimes they&rsquo;ll orient an ear</p>
<p>or one side of their head to the keys on the piano.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>people who are non-sighted have better pitch.</p>
<p>So we have these cones of attention that we can devote.</p>
<p>And for most people, vision is the primary way</p>
<p>to train up this focus ability and these cones of attention.</p>
<p>So you absolutely have to focus on the thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to learn.</p>
<p>And you will feel some agitation</p>
<p>because of the epinephrine in your system.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling agitation and it&rsquo;s challenging to focus</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re feeling like you&rsquo;re not doing it right,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re doing it right.</p>
<p>And you can practice this ability to stare</p>
<p>for long periods of time without blinking.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a little eerie for people to watch,</p>
<p>but if your goal is to learn how to control</p>
<p>that visual window for sake of controlling your focus,</p>
<p>it can be an immensely powerful portal</p>
<p>into these mechanisms of plasticity</p>
<p>because we know it engages things like nucleus basalis</p>
<p>and these other brainstem mechanisms.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions</p>
<p>about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,</p>
<p>and attention deficit disorder.</p>
<p>Some people actually have clinically diagnosed ADD and ADHD.</p>
<p>And if you do, you should certainly work</p>
<p>with a good psychiatrist to try and figure out</p>
<p>the right pharmacology and or behavioral practices for you.</p>
<p>Many people, however, have given themselves</p>
<p>a low-grade ADHD or ADD because of the way</p>
<p>that they move through their world.</p>
<p>They are looking at their phone a lot of the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually very easy to anchor your attention</p>
<p>to your phone for the following reason.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s very restricted in size.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to limit your visual attention</p>
<p>to something about this big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the design features of the phone.</p>
<p>The other is that just as you&rsquo;ve probably heard,</p>
<p>a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
<p>Well, a movie is worth 10,000 pictures.</p>
<p>Anytime we&rsquo;re looking at things that have motion,</p>
<p>visual motion, our attentional system</p>
<p>will naturally gravitate towards those movies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually much harder to read words on a page</p>
<p>than it used to be for many people</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re used to seeing things spelled out for us</p>
<p>in YouTube videos or videos where things move</p>
<p>and are very dramatic.</p>
<p>It is true that the more that we look</p>
<p>at those motion stimuli,</p>
<p>the more that we&rsquo;re seeing movies of things</p>
<p>and things that are very dramatic and very intense,</p>
<p>the worse we&rsquo;re getting at attending to things</p>
<p>like text on a page or to listening to something</p>
<p>like a podcast and extracting the information.</p>
<p>So much so that I think many people have asked me,</p>
<p>hey, why aren&rsquo;t you providing intense visuals</p>
<p>for us to look at?</p>
<p>Well, frankly, it&rsquo;s because a lot of people</p>
<p>are consuming this content through pure auditory,</p>
<p>through just by listening.</p>
<p>And I want them to be able to digest all the material.</p>
<p>But in addition to that,</p>
<p>if you think about the areas of life</p>
<p>that dictate whether or not we become successful,</p>
<p>independent, healthy individuals,</p>
<p>most of those involve the kind of boring practices</p>
<p>of digesting information on a page.</p>
<p>Boring because it&rsquo;s not as exciting in the moment perhaps</p>
<p>as watching a movie or something being spoon-fed to us.</p>
<p>But the more attention that we can put to something,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s fleeting and we feel like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only getting little bits and pieces,</p>
<p>shards of the information as opposed to the entire thing,</p>
<p>that has a much more powerful effect</p>
<p>in engaging this cholinergic system for plasticity</p>
<p>than does, for instance, watching a movie.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because when we watch a movie,</p>
<p>the entire thing can be great.</p>
<p>It can be awesome.</p>
<p>It can be this overriding experience.</p>
<p>But I think for all those experiences,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s interested in building your brain</p>
<p>and expanding your brain</p>
<p>and getting better at various things,</p>
<p>feeling better, doing better, et cetera,</p>
<p>one has to ask how much of my neurochemical resources</p>
<p>am I devoting to the passive experience</p>
<p>of letting something just kind of overwhelm me</p>
<p>and excite me versus something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m really trying to learn and take away.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s another,</p>
<p>I enjoy movie content and TV content all the time.</p>
<p>I scroll Instagram often,</p>
<p>but we are limited in the extent</p>
<p>to which we can grab a hold</p>
<p>of these acetylcholine release mechanisms or epinephrine.</p>
<p>And I think that we need to be careful</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t devote all our acetylcholine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>all our dopamine for that matter,</p>
<p>to these passive experiences of things</p>
<p>that are not going to enrich us and better us.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little bit of an editorial on my part,</p>
<p>but the phone is rich with movies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rich with information.</p>
<p>The real question is,</p>
<p>is the information rich for us in ways that grow us</p>
<p>and cultivate smarter, more emotionally,</p>
<p>you know, emotionally evolved people,</p>
<p>or is it creating,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it doing for our physical wellbeing for that matter?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to tell people what to do or not to do,</p>
<p>but think carefully about</p>
<p>how often you&rsquo;re focusing on something</p>
<p>and how good you are or poor you are</p>
<p>at focusing on something that&rsquo;s challenging.</p>
<p>So once you get this epinephrine, this alertness,</p>
<p>you get the acetylcholine released</p>
<p>and you can focus your attention,</p>
<p>then the question is for how long?</p>
<p>And in an earlier podcast,</p>
<p>I talked about these ultradian cycles</p>
<p>that last about 90 minutes.</p>
<p>The typical learning bout should be about 90 minutes.</p>
<p>I think that learning bout will no doubt include</p>
<p>five to 10 minutes of warmup period.</p>
<p>I think everyone should give themselves permission</p>
<p>to not be fully focused in the early part of that bout,</p>
<p>but that in the middle of that bout,</p>
<p>for the middle hour or so,</p>
<p>you should be able to maintain focus for about an hour or so.</p>
<p>So that for me means eliminating distractions.</p>
<p>That means turning off the Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>I put my phone in the other room.</p>
<p>If I find myself reflexively getting up to get the phone,</p>
<p>I will take the phone and lock it in the car outside.</p>
<p>If I find myself going to get it anyway,</p>
<p>I am guilty of giving away the phone for a period of time</p>
<p>or even things more dramatic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thrown it up on my roof before,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t get to it till the end of the day.</p>
<p>That thing is pretty compelling</p>
<p>and we come up with all sorts of reasons</p>
<p>why we need it to be in contact with it.</p>
<p>But I encourage you to try experiencing what it is</p>
<p>to be completely immersed in an activity</p>
<p>where you feel the agitation</p>
<p>that your attention is drifting,</p>
<p>but you continually bring it back.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an important point,</p>
<p>which is that attention drifts, but we have to re-anchor it.</p>
<p>We have to keep grabbing it back.</p>
<p>And the way to do that, if you&rsquo;re sighted,</p>
<p>is with your eyes.</p>
<p>That as your attention drifts and you look away,</p>
<p>you want to try and literally maintain visual focus</p>
<p>on the thing that you&rsquo;re trying to learn.</p>
<p>Feel free to blink, of course,</p>
<p>but you can greatly increase your powers of focus</p>
<p>and the rates of learning,</p>
<p>which is anchored in all the work of Merz</p>
<p>and Eccles and Wiesel and others.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s the trigger for plasticity.</p>
<p>But the real secret is that neural plasticity</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t occur during wakefulness.</p>
<p>It occurs during sleep.</p>
<p>We now know that if you focus very hard on something</p>
<p>for about 90 minutes or so,</p>
<p>maybe you even do several bouts of that per day,</p>
<p>if you can do that.</p>
<p>Some people can,</p>
<p>some people can only do one focused bout of learning.</p>
<p>That night and the following nights while you sleep,</p>
<p>the neural circuits that were highlighted, if you will,</p>
<p>with acetylcholine transmission will strengthen</p>
<p>and other ones will be lost,</p>
<p>which is wonderful because that&rsquo;s the essence of plasticity.</p>
<p>And what it means is that when you eventually wake up</p>
<p>a couple of days or a week later,</p>
<p>you will have acquired the knowledge forever,</p>
<p>unless you go through some process to actively unlearn it.</p>
<p>And we will talk about unlearning in a later episode.</p>
<p>So mastering sleep is key</p>
<p>in order to reinforce the learning that occurs.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say you get a really poor night of sleep</p>
<p>after a bout of learning.</p>
<p>Chances are if you sleep the next night</p>
<p>or the following night,</p>
<p>that learning will occur.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a stamp in the brain</p>
<p>where this acetylcholine was released.</p>
<p>It actually marks those synapses neurochemically</p>
<p>and metabolically so that those synapses</p>
<p>are more biased to change.</p>
<p>Now, if you don&rsquo;t ever get that deep sleep,</p>
<p>then you probably won&rsquo;t get those changes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a way in which you can bypass the need</p>
<p>for deep sleep, at least partially,</p>
<p>by engaging in what I call non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>these NSDR protocols.</p>
<p>But I just want to discuss the science of this.</p>
<p>There was a paper that was published</p>
<p>in Cell Reports last year</p>
<p>that shows that if people did,</p>
<p>it was a spatial memory task,</p>
<p>actually quite difficult one,</p>
<p>where they had to remember the sequence of lights</p>
<p>lighting up.</p>
<p>And if there are just two or three lights</p>
<p>in a particular sequence, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>But as you get up to 15 or 16 lights</p>
<p>and numbers in the sequence,</p>
<p>it actually gets quite challenging.</p>
<p>If immediately after,</p>
<p>and it was immediately after the learning,</p>
<p>the actual performance of this task,</p>
<p>people took a 20-minute non-sleep deep rest protocol</p>
<p>or took a shallow nap,</p>
<p>so lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,</p>
<p>just closing their eyes, no sensory input.</p>
<p>The rates of learning were significantly higher</p>
<p>for that information</p>
<p>than were to just had a good night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>the following night.</p>
<p>So you can actually accelerate learning</p>
<p>with these NSDR protocols or with brief naps,</p>
<p>90 minutes or less.</p>
<p>So the key to plasticity in childhood is to be a child.</p>
<p>The key to plasticity in adulthood</p>
<p>is to engage alertness, engage focus,</p>
<p>and then to engage non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>and deep sleep while you&rsquo;re in your typical bout of sleep.</p>
<p>I always get asked,</p>
<p>how many bouts of learning can I perform?</p>
<p>Well, I know people that train up</p>
<p>these visual focus mechanisms</p>
<p>to the point where they can do</p>
<p>several 90-minute bouts throughout the day,</p>
<p>as many as three or four.</p>
<p>And some of them are also inserting</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest as well.</p>
<p>Now that can get pretty tricky.</p>
<p>A lot of people find that they can recover best</p>
<p>from these intense bouts of focused learning</p>
<p>by doing some motor activity,</p>
<p>where you get into self-generated optic flow.</p>
<p>And that should make sense</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever heard me lecture about stress,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve done a little bit in various podcasts.</p>
<p>When we are in a mode of self-generated optic flow,</p>
<p>like walking or running or cycling,</p>
<p>and things are just floating past us on our retina,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not really looking anywhere in particular.</p>
<p>So this is the opposite of a tight window of focus.</p>
<p>When we do that,</p>
<p>there are areas of the brain like the amygdala,</p>
<p>which are involved in releasing epinephrine</p>
<p>and create alertness.</p>
<p>At the extremes, it creates fear, but certainly alertness.</p>
<p>Those all shut down.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s its own form of non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>So some people find it much more pleasurable and practical</p>
<p>to engage in a focused bout of learning,</p>
<p>and then go do some activity</p>
<p>that involves what we would essentially call wordlessness,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not really thinking about much of anything.</p>
<p>And so for those of you that listen to audio books</p>
<p>or podcasts while you run,</p>
<p>you may want to consider whether or not</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you want to spend your time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love it if you were listening to this podcast</p>
<p>while you run or cycle,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m much more interested in you</p>
<p>actually getting the benefits of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>than just listening to me for sake of listening to me.</p>
<p>So for many people, letting the mind drift</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not organized in thought</p>
<p>after a period of very deliberate focused effort</p>
<p>is the best way to accelerate learning</p>
<p>and depth of learning.</p>
<p>And there are good scientific data</p>
<p>to support these sorts of things,</p>
<p>including the Cell Reports paper</p>
<p>that I mentioned a few moments ago.</p>
<p>I want to synthesize some of the information</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve covered up until now.</p>
<p>This entire month is about neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode has covered a lot,</p>
<p>but by no means has it covered all of the potential</p>
<p>for neuroplasticity and protocols for plasticity.</p>
<p>We will get into all of it,</p>
<p>but today I want to make sure that these key elements</p>
<p>that form the backbone of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>are really embedded in people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>First of all, plasticity occurs throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>Early from birth until 25,</p>
<p>mere exposure to a sensory event can create plasticity.</p>
<p>That could be a good thing or a bad thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about unlearning the bad stuff,</p>
<p>traumas, et cetera, in a subsequent episode this month.</p>
<p>If you want to learn as an adult, you have to be alert.</p>
<p>It might seem so obvious,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>when in their 24-hour cycle they&rsquo;re most alert.</p>
<p>There are four episodes devoted to that 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>and the cycles of alertness and sleep.</p>
<p>I encourage you to listen to those</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to yet,</p>
<p>or just ask yourself, when during the day</p>
<p>do you typically tend to be most alert?</p>
<p>That will afford you an advantage</p>
<p>in learning specific things during that period of time.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t give up that period of time</p>
<p>for things that are meaningless, useless,</p>
<p>or not aligned with your goals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a terrible time to get into passive observance</p>
<p>or just letting your time get soaked away by something.</p>
<p>That is a valuable asset.</p>
<p>That epinephrine released from your brainstem</p>
<p>is going to occur more readily at particular phases</p>
<p>of your 24-hour cycle than others</p>
<p>during the waking phase, of course.</p>
<p>You should know when those are.</p>
<p>And then you could start to think about</p>
<p>the behavioral practices,</p>
<p>maybe the pharmacologic practices</p>
<p>like caffeine, hydration, et cetera,</p>
<p>that will support heightened levels of alertness.</p>
<p>Attention is something that can be learned,</p>
<p>and attention is critical for creating that condition</p>
<p>where whatever it is that you are engaging in</p>
<p>will modify your brain in a way</p>
<p>that you won&rsquo;t have to spend so much attention on it</p>
<p>going forward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the essence of plasticity,</p>
<p>that things will eventually become reflexive,</p>
<p>the language that you&rsquo;re learning,</p>
<p>the motor movement, the cognitive skill,</p>
<p>the ability to suppress an emotional response</p>
<p>or to engage in emotional response,</p>
<p>depending on what your goals are</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s appropriate for you.</p>
<p>Increasing acetylcholine can be accomplished</p>
<p>pharmacologically through nicotine.</p>
<p>However, there are certain dangers</p>
<p>for many people to do that,</p>
<p>as well as a cost, a financial cost.</p>
<p>Learning how to engage the cholinergic system</p>
<p>through the use of the visual system,</p>
<p>practicing how long can you maintain focus</p>
<p>with blinks as you need them,</p>
<p>but how long can you maintain visual focus on a target,</p>
<p>just on a piece of paper set a few feet away in the room</p>
<p>or at the level of your computer screen?</p>
<p>These are actually things that people do in communities</p>
<p>where high levels of visual focus are necessary.</p>
<p>Now, the other way to get high levels of visual focus</p>
<p>and alertness is to have a panic</p>
<p>or to have a situation that&rsquo;s very, very bad.</p>
<p>You will be immediately focused on everything</p>
<p>related to that situation, but that&rsquo;s unfortunate.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is trying to harness the mechanisms of attention</p>
<p>and get better at paying attention.</p>
<p>You may want to do that with your auditory system,</p>
<p>not with your visual system,</p>
<p>either because you&rsquo;re low vision or no vision,</p>
<p>or because you&rsquo;re trying to learn something</p>
<p>that relates more to sounds than to what you see.</p>
<p>But for most people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to learn information, cognitive information,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re trying to learn how to hear the nuance</p>
<p>in their partner&rsquo;s explanations</p>
<p>of their emotionally challenging events, et cetera.</p>
<p>And just remember, by the way, what I said earlier,</p>
<p>which is that if you really want somebody to listen to you</p>
<p>and really hear what you&rsquo;re saying and what&rsquo;s underlying it,</p>
<p>you should not and cannot expect them</p>
<p>to look directly at you while you do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually going to limit their ability to focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to rescue a few folks out there</p>
<p>who might be in this struggle.</p>
<p>I, of course, have never been in this struggle.</p>
<p>And that was supposed to be a joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very familiar with that struggle.</p>
<p>But I know that one can get better at listening,</p>
<p>one can get better at learning,</p>
<p>one can get better at all sorts of things</p>
<p>by anchoring in these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you can also combine protocols.</p>
<p>You can decide to combine pharmacology</p>
<p>with these learning practices.</p>
<p>Many people in communities do that.</p>
<p>Many people are doing that naturally</p>
<p>by drinking their coffee right before they do their learning.</p>
<p>But I would also encourage you</p>
<p>to think about how long those learning bouts are.</p>
<p>If you think you have ADD or ADHD, see a clinician,</p>
<p>but you should also ask yourself,</p>
<p>are you giving up the best period of focus</p>
<p>that you have each day naturally</p>
<p>to some other thing like social media</p>
<p>or some other activity that doesn&rsquo;t serve you well,</p>
<p>or are you devoting that period to the opportunity to learn?</p>
<p>You should also ask yourself</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re trying to focus too much</p>
<p>for too long during the day.</p>
<p>I know some very high-performing individuals,</p>
<p>very high-performing in a variety of contexts,</p>
<p>and none of them are focused all day long.</p>
<p>Many of them take walks down the hallway,</p>
<p>sometimes mumbling to themselves</p>
<p>or not paying attention to anything else.</p>
<p>They go for bike rides, they take walks.</p>
<p>They are not trying to engage their mind</p>
<p>at maximum focus all the time.</p>
<p>Very few people do that</p>
<p>because we learn best in these 90-minute bouts</p>
<p>inside of one of these ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>And I should repeat again that within that 90-minute cycle,</p>
<p>you should not expect yourself to focus</p>
<p>for the entire period of one 90-minute cycle.</p>
<p>The beginning and end are going to be a little bit flickering</p>
<p>in and out of focus.</p>
<p>How do you know when one of these 90-minute cycles</p>
<p>is starting?</p>
<p>Well, typically when you wake up</p>
<p>is the beginning of the first 90-minute cycle,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not down to the minute.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to tap into your sense</p>
<p>of these 90-minute cycles</p>
<p>as you start to engage in these learning practices</p>
<p>should you choose.</p>
<p>And then, of course, getting some non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>or just deliberate disengagement,</p>
<p>such as walking or running or just sitting,</p>
<p>eyes closed or eyes open, kind of mindlessly,</p>
<p>it might seem, in a chair,</p>
<p>just letting your thoughts move around</p>
<p>after a learning about will accelerate</p>
<p>the rate of plasticity that&rsquo;s been shown</p>
<p>in quality peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>And then, of course, deep sleep.</p>
<p>And so what we can start to see</p>
<p>is that plasticity is your natural right early in life,</p>
<p>but after about age 25,</p>
<p>you have to do some work in order to access it.</p>
<p>But fortunately, these beautiful experiments</p>
<p>of Hubel and Wiesel and Merzenich and Weinberger</p>
<p>and others point in the direction</p>
<p>of what allows us to achieve plasticity.</p>
<p>It points to the neurochemicals and the circuits,</p>
<p>and we now have behavioral protocols</p>
<p>that allow us to do that.</p>
<p>I also really want to emphasize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an entire other aspect of behavioral practices</p>
<p>that will allow us to engage in plasticity</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t involve intense focus and emotionality,</p>
<p>but involve a lot of repetition.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s another entire category of plasticity</p>
<p>that involves doing what seem like almost mundane things,</p>
<p>but doing them over and over again repeatedly</p>
<p>and incorporating the reward system that involves dopamine.</p>
<p>So today I talked about the kind of plasticity</p>
<p>that comes from extreme focus.</p>
<p>You would get that extreme focus and alertness naturally</p>
<p>through a hard or difficult event that you didn&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of stinger,</p>
<p>but your brain is designed to keep you safe.</p>
<p>So it wants to get one trial learning</p>
<p>from things like touching a hot stove</p>
<p>or engaging with a really horrible person.</p>
<p>You can get incredible plasticity of positive experiences</p>
<p>of things that you want by engaging this high focus regime</p>
<p>and then rest, non-sleep, deep rest, and sleep.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another aspect of plasticity</p>
<p>which we will explore next episode,</p>
<p>as well as when we explore movement-based practices</p>
<p>for enhancing plasticity and plasticity of movement itself.</p>
<p>And those are not of the high attention</p>
<p>kind of high emotionality</p>
<p>or the intensity of the experiences that I described today.</p>
<p>Those are more about repetition and reward and repeat,</p>
<p>repetition, reward, repeat.</p>
<p>And they are used for a distinctly different category</p>
<p>of behavioral change, more of which relate to habits</p>
<p>as opposed to learning of particular types of information</p>
<p>that allow us to perform physically, cognitively,</p>
<p>or adjust our emotional system.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to stop there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of questions.</p>
<p>Please put your questions in the comment section below.</p>
<p>And please remember that this entire month</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be exploring neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So this discussion slash lecture,</p>
<p>I wish it was more of a back and forth,</p>
<p>but this is what the format offers us.</p>
<p>So please do put your questions in the comment section</p>
<p>and I will address them in the other episodes coming soon</p>
<p>on neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>As I say that, I&rsquo;m reminded that many of you</p>
<p>are listening to this on Apple or Spotify,</p>
<p>and therefore there isn&rsquo;t an opportunity to leave comments</p>
<p>aside from the rating section on Apple.</p>
<p>So if you have specific topics related to neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that you would like me to cover</p>
<p>in the subsequent episodes this month,</p>
<p>please go to the YouTube, subscribe,</p>
<p>but as well, please put your question</p>
