<p>after it was over i was like you know what</p>
<p>we might have lost a bunch of listeners</p>
<p>cause if i had just turned in this thing the first time</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be like what is this nonsense</p>
<p>nonsense fucking mish mash of of dumb talk</p>
<p>this is what we did</p>
<p>our friend daryl</p>
<p>was supposed to</p>
<p>be over the podcast and daryl&rsquo;s an interesting guy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a guy went to jail for</p>
<p>shooting a crackhead</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s out there on the</p>
<p>grind as a stand up</p>
<p>comic and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>young guy and i like</p>
<p>i like very</p>
<p>funny guy very</p>
<p>funny guy and i like interviewing</p>
<p>young guys that are coming</p>
<p>up and i just want to see what it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>i mean i i i</p>
<p>enjoy the stories i</p>
<p>enjoy like you know hearing about them</p>
<p>you know out there trying to get something together</p>
<p>there was a little bit</p>
<p>self defeating but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good guy and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny yeah he&rsquo;s very funny</p>
<p>stand up comic</p>
<p>and he brought over his friend</p>
<p>and unfortunately i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think his friend had ever done a podcast before</p>
<p>his friend didn&rsquo;t know that he was</p>
<p>gonna do this one</p>
<p>and he went into like</p>
<p>performance on</p>
<p>stage get a</p>
<p>laugh mode or something</p>
<p>oh really like running bits kind of</p>
<p>thing well he was like</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>in the beginning it was like trying to like like</p>
<p>be like edgy</p>
<p>and like angry at</p>
<p>things that didn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense like people asking him for</p>
<p>money and get on a bus and was like</p>
<p>it was this</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>where like here&rsquo;s what kills me man he just was like</p>
<p>it just did not work and</p>
<p>brian and i were high as fuck</p>
<p>and they were sober</p>
<p>and it was like this dumb talk</p>
<p>and then trying to like</p>
<p>smooth it off like hey hey everybody relax</p>
<p>and you know it was like an</p>
<p>inner monologue his</p>
<p>inner monologue didn&rsquo;t work anything</p>
<p>he would normally</p>
<p>thought of when people were talking he was like in the</p>
<p>background going</p>
<p>because you always</p>
<p>remember saying</p>
<p>something so i had to turn down his</p>
<p>microphone half the time i don&rsquo;t think he</p>
<p>understood how podcasts work and you know people think</p>
<p>when they do a podcast they</p>
<p>think like they have to get something in</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like when you do it you like if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not heard</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not doing my part</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna get my</p>
<p>stuff in i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get my stuff in</p>
<p>i mean how many times have you ever done</p>
<p>radio with a</p>
<p>comic and they just like so like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a fake conversation</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re just trying to shove in</p>
<p>their bits and</p>
<p>pretend they just notice</p>
<p>things and it&rsquo;s like fucking kind of</p>
<p>gross that actually makes me shut down more too oh yeah</p>
<p>then i just kind of sit there and they&rsquo;re like are you</p>
<p>gonna talk i&rsquo;m like not really no</p>
<p>no this is already</p>
<p>a disaster yeah and that i almost felt like doing that</p>
<p>on the last podcast</p>
<p>and brian&rsquo;s a good guy don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong he just he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ready for it and didn&rsquo;t know he was</p>
<p>gonna do it yeah probably</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know the vibe of the podcast</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>just wanted to</p>
<p>just wanted to do well you know</p>
<p>and unfortunately</p>
<p>this was a cluster fuck</p>
<p>first of all four people on a podcast is</p>
<p>tough action anyway yeah</p>
<p>you know you have to have</p>
<p>the fourth person has to be very good at not chiming in</p>
<p>like i listen</p>
<p>to opie and anthony a lot i love opie and anthony but</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;ll have like five or six dudes in there</p>
<p>and it becomes a disaster</p>
<p>it becomes like</p>
<p>comics stepping on</p>
<p>comics and talking in the middle of</p>
<p>punch lines and</p>
<p>inserting their own</p>
<p>punch lines into someone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s when you pretty much have to just</p>
<p>play with the</p>
<p>microphones and go alright this person&rsquo;s talking this</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what i had to do it was</p>
<p>it well you had to do it too because he</p>
<p>would talk like</p>
<p>while other people were talking</p>
<p>it was real</p>
<p>weird i cannot wait to listen to</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good dude</p>
<p>so what would you do how</p>
<p>would you handle that you would be like hey man</p>
<p>i would be like if i was talking try to talk</p>
<p>right now so i would be like so</p>
<p>anyways i was talking anyways and then</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what i call your microphone</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s got the master switch back</p>
<p>there bro i just had to oh i had</p>
<p>i had i was</p>
<p>listening and i was getting fucking heart palpitations</p>
<p>because it was too many people talking yeah</p>
<p>the stepping on yeah i had to tell them</p>
<p>i had to tell them you guys can&rsquo;t talk over each</p>
<p>other like it was</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that good podcast and you know unfortunately it</p>
<p>could have been really interesting if</p>
<p>brian came excuse me if</p>
<p>daryl came by himself</p>
<p>cause daryl stories of a prisoner fucking weird man</p>
<p>you know i mean that guy stories</p>
<p>about everything yeah</p>
<p>that guy has some stories and it would it</p>
<p>could have been real interesting and i couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>him to get comfortable because his friend was sort of</p>
<p>it was just a</p>
<p>it was a big cluster fuck</p>
<p>so i apologize to anybody and i</p>
<p>normally i&rsquo;m very good at controlling who comes on</p>
<p>you know i mean we&rsquo;ve taken</p>
<p>a few chances before with</p>
<p>young comics like</p>
<p>little esther and</p>
<p>allison and allison and then we went</p>
<p>great it was fine</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i just thought this kids trying to be a comic too</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>there doing it like fucking give him a shit</p>
<p>give him a shot sit</p>
<p>down maybe he&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s interesting yeah</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t work out it&rsquo;s probably just</p>
<p>nerves too right i mean</p>
<p>i could see someone</p>
<p>being really nervous</p>
<p>yeah it was a</p>
<p>bunch of shit</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t prepared</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t think he was</p>
<p>gonna do it all of a</p>
<p>sudden he&rsquo;s doing it nerves</p>
<p>and maybe he&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>right kind of</p>
<p>comic for a podcast anyway</p>
<p>i mean you know there&rsquo;s a lot of dudes who</p>
<p>like first of all you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to see behind the curtain</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to see that like steven wright</p>
<p>would you want to see steven wright sit down and talk</p>
<p>about things no</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d ruin his</p>
<p>whole act yeah</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it yeah</p>
<p>it would totally ruin his</p>
<p>whole act because his whole</p>
<p>act is just weirdo</p>
<p>who thinks he&rsquo;s strange</p>
<p>things yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when</p>
<p>you see have you talked to gilbert godfrey off stage</p>
<p>yeah and you&rsquo;re like what</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>sweetest like oh really is he really</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>because when he does</p>
<p>stern he does</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gilbert</p>
<p>god he&rsquo;s in he&rsquo;s in character yeah he</p>
<p>never breaks</p>
<p>character ever yeah backstage though he&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>sweet of you and i</p>
<p>really i&rsquo;m looking</p>
<p>forward to doing that you&rsquo;re like whoa really</p>
<p>like so he is the fucking</p>
<p>thing about cunts and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like what</p>
<p>it is a hundred</p>
<p>eighty degrees away from that complete opposite when</p>
<p>yeah when he gets up there man he&rsquo;s such a strange act</p>
<p>you know bizarre</p>
<p>and hasn&rsquo;t like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>dropped that</p>
<p>you know facade</p>
<p>whatever a character</p>
<p>in front of anybody i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen him on</p>
<p>television for what</p>
<p>twenty years or something more</p>
<p>yeah and like it&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>and then i did caroline&rsquo;s one time and he was</p>
<p>backstage and i was like oh i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry he&rsquo;s like oh no that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>like would you like something to</p>
<p>drink and i was like sure</p>
<p>like staring like</p>
<p>so so you&rsquo;re normal</p>
<p>yeah and he was like i</p>
<p>think he was his wife was</p>
<p>about to have or the</p>
<p>girlfriends</p>
<p>about to have a baby</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>weird dude um</p>
<p>is when you get</p>
<p>comics like that and they become their act</p>
<p>you know like that happened with kinesin</p>
<p>that happened with dice</p>
<p>you know a lot of people don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try to get dice in the podcast i&rsquo;m a big dice fan</p>
<p>i know dice from way back</p>
<p>but at one point in time</p>
<p>that dice man character was only a part of his act</p>
<p>his act was</p>
<p>he was andrew silverstein</p>
<p>and he would go on</p>
<p>stage and do all</p>
<p>these characters and then</p>
<p>the dice man was one of his characters that he would do</p>
<p>i had no idea he</p>
<p>would do a john travolta</p>
<p>impression he does a killer john travolta</p>
<p>impression he</p>
<p>does killer</p>
<p>impressions</p>
<p>so anyway he</p>
<p>would do this</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would do his dice character but the dice character got</p>
<p>crushing laughs</p>
<p>and so he just</p>
<p>dropped everything else</p>
<p>fucked it fucked</p>
<p>everything off</p>
<p>put everything else aside</p>
<p>and just went straight dice man</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>sort of became that guy then like</p>
<p>when you see him he&rsquo;s always wearing like this</p>
<p>crazy leather jacket</p>
<p>with like studs in it yeah yeah</p>
<p>fucking weightlifting</p>

<p>i mean you think dice is</p>
<p>crazy for charging 100 a ticket</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what they charge</p>
<p>those arenas but it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>close to that 60 minutes did a piece</p>
<p>on larry the cable guy</p>
<p>couple years ago and his manager was like look</p>
<p>he will not</p>
<p>breathe on a microphone</p>
<p>for less than a</p>
<p>quarter million dollars</p>
<p>what that&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the opening what</p>
<p>bid for like</p>
<p>larry to show up and be like get</p>
<p>the fuck and</p>
<p>then your mama and your cousins</p>
<p>right like that</p>
<p>he won&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s will do</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s will do</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s comedy he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be at</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s ron white</p>
<p>would do sal&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>i hung out with that guy run why we do sounds</p>
<p>everyone says that</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t know him but everyone says that larry</p>
<p>dan whatever is</p>
<p>super nice so you know i don&rsquo;t know what he does i bet</p>
<p>he is but money wise that dude is</p>
<p>killing it man</p>
<p>quarter million</p>
<p>quarter million</p>
<p>every time he tells a joke</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible it&rsquo;s amazing with that redneck comedy</p>
<p>that how popular it is the</p>
<p>other what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other guy that does it kind of like</p>
<p>bill ngel and</p>
<p>jeff foxworthy</p>
<p>right yeah or the guy that the comedy</p>
<p>store guy that got the dodge</p>
<p>commercials and the</p>
<p>henry john reap</p>
<p>yeah just from doing</p>
<p>those those commercials for whatever</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been selling out just because it like a</p>
<p>chevy commercial</p>
<p>yeah no it&rsquo;s hemi</p>
<p>the hemi commercials yeah</p>
<p>thing i have got a hemi in it</p>
<p>right yeah yeah well</p>
<p>he does really well in a lot of markets</p>
<p>john reap does he&rsquo;ll sell</p>
<p>yeah he seems like a guy who&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>marketed correctly</p>
<p>like it seems like there&rsquo;s so much potential in</p>
<p>that like why</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that guy have some big comedy</p>
<p>central special</p>
<p>why is it he does have a special</p>
<p>yeah when&rsquo;s it coming out</p>
<p>i think it already did it already did</p>
<p>but how come that didn&rsquo;t get huge that</p>
<p>should be huge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more the question</p>
<p>and i think that guy</p>
<p>should be more of like a well</p>
<p>known name yeah</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s been around a long time now yeah</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>weird when you see like</p>
<p>these larry the</p>
<p>cable guy type</p>
<p>guys and not you know not many meaning to</p>
<p>focus entirely on him but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s playing a poor guy</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>a guy you know who&rsquo;s like oh i&rsquo;m just simple</p>
<p>yeah yeah it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>every man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>below every yeah</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>poor man with</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t even have</p>
<p>sleeves right</p>
<p>you know i can&rsquo;t buy a full</p>
<p>shirt man yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>buying he&rsquo;s wearing</p>
<p>a shirt that has its</p>
<p>sleeves cut off</p>
<p>his armpit hairs</p>
<p>flowing out</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m assuming that one ripped</p>
<p>and then he said well i&rsquo;ll just cut them off both up</p>
<p>right here i don&rsquo;t care i&rsquo;m an easy</p>
<p>going guy yeah meanwhile</p>
<p>he won&rsquo;t even tell a joke for a</p>
<p>less than a</p>
<p>quarter of a million dollars yeah yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird man you know numbers like this like this is</p>
<p>where people get into that</p>
<p>weird socialism argument i had a</p>
<p>discussion online and i had</p>
<p>i had to just walk away from the</p>
<p>the computer because it was a</p>
<p>ridiculous discussion</p>
<p>where this guy was like no one</p>
<p>should make</p>
<p>an exorbitant</p>
<p>amount of money ever</p>
<p>no matter what you do you should</p>
<p>never be able to make an exorbitant amount of</p>
<p>money because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where greed comes from that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stupid well</p>
<p>his idea was that there</p>
<p>should be a</p>
<p>threshold and you couldn&rsquo;t go over that threshold</p>
<p>so everything you did was</p>
<p>virtuous if you did</p>
<p>art you did it for the sake of art if you did</p>
<p>work it was because it&rsquo;s your chosen</p>
<p>profession it&rsquo;s what you love</p>
<p>to do and you don&rsquo;t make any more than a certain amount</p>
<p>because when people get too much money</p>
<p>and too much</p>
<p>power it it it</p>
<p>it becomes out of control</p>
<p>and it it starts to be unfair</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why people look like this</p>
<p>larry the cable guy</p>
<p>thing and you go well</p>
<p>this guy is doing</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s got to be making more than a</p>
<p>quarter million dollars when he does a football</p>
<p>arena oh yeah i bet he&rsquo;s making like a half a million</p>
<p>probably i think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right yeah i mean</p>
<p>he does football stadiums like 50 000 people man so</p>
<p>for some people that are out there</p>
<p>clawing and scratching</p>
<p>they see something like that and they</p>
<p>go that&rsquo;s not fair that&rsquo;s too much in one direction</p>
<p>it may move too much in that</p>
<p>direction that&rsquo;s the argument for socialism yeah</p>
<p>i see that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point to a degree but it&rsquo;s a very generalized</p>
<p>statement it&rsquo;s also a very</p>
<p>idealistic way of viewing things</p>
<p>you can also argue that</p>
<p>having a lot of money</p>
<p>gives you the freedom to do</p>
<p>other things that you</p>
<p>wanna do and open new doors and opportunities</p>
<p>and provide opportunities for</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>yeah will they have a lot of</p>
<p>trickle down economic</p>
<p>sure i mean</p>
<p>you can fund</p>
<p>other things you</p>
<p>know if you&rsquo;re a guy with a lot of money</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m really interested in</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>could be something from the arts it</p>
<p>could be from the environment it</p>
<p>could be science i want to fund this and you are doing</p>
<p>that because you&rsquo;ve accumulated so much wealth right</p>
<p>pete johansson was on here</p>
<p>once and his argument was that when people get too much</p>
<p>money that what happens is</p>
<p>it breeds like a</p>
<p>class of elitists</p>
<p>it breeds like a class that</p>
<p>like he didn&rsquo;t even believe in inheritance money</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be able to get all your like if your</p>
<p>grandparents die and</p>
<p>leave you ten million</p>
<p>bucks you don&rsquo;t get that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think she</p>
<p>had that that&rsquo;s crazy yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s crazy but</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s that that</p>
<p>same attitude that looks at people that are doing well</p>
<p>and and go well this</p>
<p>system&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>i do think there&rsquo;s something to be said</p>
<p>i do think there&rsquo;s something to be said</p>
<p>about inheriting</p>
<p>extraordinary wealth really i do think</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m not saying there</p>
<p>should be a rule or law about it</p>
<p>but i do think</p>
<p>if you inherit</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m saying like</p>
<p>you inherit</p>
<p>50 100 million like</p>
<p>these really</p>
<p>extraordinary amounts of money</p>
<p>that that can</p>
<p>definitely and probably</p>
<p>do always will have an</p>
<p>effect of like</p>
<p>you may not go</p>
<p>after the thing that really inspires you your passion</p>
<p>and you might not ever get a</p>
<p>sense of accomplishment because</p>
<p>really the real</p>
<p>world and your</p>
<p>dreams and stuff are</p>
<p>scary in a lot of ways and</p>
<p>going after them can be a</p>
<p>scary thing</p>
<p>if you have the comfort of like</p>
<p>dude i have two hundred million dollars</p>
<p>that my grandfather who</p>
<p>started gum</p>
<p>or whatever you know</p>
<p>fucking left me</p>
<p>then you can</p>
<p>i mean you can buy a</p>
<p>great house</p>
<p>you can take</p>
<p>great trips you can</p>
<p>live on your yacht and</p>
<p>you can just be like dude life is awesome and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great but what</p>
<p>would your life have been</p>
<p>if you had a time machine</p>
<p>and there was a guy that you really hated but he was</p>
<p>super successful</p>
<p>best thing you</p>
<p>could ever do to him and have a</p>
<p>clear conscience</p>
<p>is to make him win the lottery when he was</p>
<p>twenty one yeah</p>
<p>yeah yeah so</p>
<p>you just won the lottery ha ha ha</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like yeah man i&rsquo;m a winner i just won the lottery</p>
<p>no you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you just lost at life because you won the lottery</p>
<p>totally that&rsquo;s the true that&rsquo;s that really would</p>
<p>like if i look back i play the lottery a</p>
<p>bunch of times</p>
<p>when i was a kid if i</p>
<p>had hit it and i had actually won like a couple million</p>
<p>bucks or something</p>
<p>yeah i would have been a</p>
<p>loser for sure yeah</p>
<p>i would have missed the</p>
<p>whole purpose of the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>i think i think so i</p>
<p>think i would have totally</p>
<p>been a total disaster if i&rsquo;m 21</p>
<p>yeah yeah i almost have actually i know i have more</p>
<p>like sympathy for a lot of</p>
<p>these athletes</p>
<p>they turn like they get</p>
<p>drafted and</p>
<p>their basketball football players</p>
<p>and they blow</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they don&rsquo;t know what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on man they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they turn twenty</p>
<p>and they got here&rsquo;s a thirty</p>
<p>eight million dollar contract or whatever for you</p>
<p>yeah and then you hear like they blew it it&rsquo;s like well</p>
<p>that dude has never had</p>
<p>more than a hundred dollars in his pocket before</p>
<p>he has no idea how to manage money</p>
<p>he has no idea what to do with money</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s just like everybody can have</p>
<p>money i got so much</p>
<p>money like this</p>
<p>but at least his</p>
<p>money came from something that</p>
<p>he did yeah</p>
<p>but they just don&rsquo;t i mean i feel like a lot of</p>
<p>those athletes have no</p>
<p>yeah they don&rsquo;t control</p>
<p>no and not only that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re you know you&rsquo;re living off your body</p>
<p>which breaks</p>
<p>which breaks yeah it</p>
<p>breaks all the time you&rsquo;re running and</p>
<p>bouncing around on shit falling down and</p>
<p>you can get hurt man they just show this uh you ever</p>
<p>watch real sports on hbo</p>
<p>sure yeah it&rsquo;s really well done yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great and they had this profile on</p>
<p>these football players</p>
<p>oh my god some of them were</p>
<p>in the league like thirteen years and they&rsquo;re bankrupt</p>
<p>like no no money</p>
<p>all gone and the profile was financial</p>
<p>and they i mean he&rsquo;s got one of the guys was a</p>
<p>like a defensive tackle for i don&rsquo;t know how many teams</p>
<p>just had multiple</p>
<p>million dollar contracts</p>
<p>we know the</p>
<p>other issue is</p>
<p>those guys getting concussions</p>
<p>all the time that is terrible for your your ability to</p>
<p>think yeah your ability to make rational decisions and</p>
<p>you know concussions like they just did this one</p>
<p>thing on real</p>
<p>sports where they were talking</p>
<p>about lou gehrig&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>well apparently lou</p>
<p>garrick had been</p>
<p>knocked out like a gang at times like he</p>
<p>lou gehrig&rsquo;s disease you say well it&rsquo;s just some</p>
<p>weird disease that this poor guy got</p>
<p>you know he was a baseball player and they</p>
<p>loved him so they</p>
<p>named it after him</p>
<p>no he didn&rsquo;t just get it</p>
<p>he got it from playing</p>
<p>sports he got it from getting hit with pitches</p>
<p>and colliding</p>
<p>with people sliding into bases and getting knocked</p>
<p>unconscious oh yeah he got</p>
<p>knocked unconscious like a gang at times and</p>
<p>he would just go</p>
<p>right back into the game</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where lou gehrig&rsquo;s disease come from</p>
<p>when you have any sort of</p>
<p>when you have like</p>
<p>some severe brain</p>
<p>trauma when</p>
<p>your brain rattles around you get knocked</p>
<p>unconscious apparently</p>
<p>what it does is it produces like</p>
<p>whatever the fuck</p>
<p>it does it eventually leads to a deterioration to the</p>
<p>point where your</p>
<p>whole body like shakes</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have control of</p>
<p>things and your body just stops functioning</p>
<p>right it just</p>
<p>breaks down</p>
<p>and which would happen in lou</p>
<p>garing that&rsquo;s actually what stephen</p>
<p>hawking says</p>
<p>really yeah he is</p>
<p>hawking yeah he has lou gehrig&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>does it can it be hereditary</p>
<p>does yeah it</p>
<p>could but they don&rsquo;t know i mean he</p>
<p>actually was a boxer when he was younger too</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>lot of soccer</p>
<p>or did he play soccer one of</p>
<p>those soccer</p>
<p>is actually very bad he was a boxer if i was a boxer he</p>
<p>might have been a boxer</p>
<p>but it could have been from that and it</p>
<p>could have also been from soccer</p>
<p>yeah people forget</p>
<p>like they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of soccer like you can get</p>
<p>crushed in soccer they run into each</p>
<p>other a lot and they</p>
<p>all say they&rsquo;re in the head sometimes you know</p>
<p>that ball the impact over and over again of</p>
<p>using your head on the ball</p>
<p>it seems like nothing</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s just a ball but apparently</p>
<p>over time you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re practicing that all the time and</p>
<p>they that had your heads a fucking weapon</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re taking shots man you getting tagged you know</p>
<p>i think in luke eric&rsquo;s era like</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>batting helmets either you had</p>
<p>this leather</p>
<p>stupid hat you would wear</p>
<p>looking at yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>ninety miles an hour you know</p>
<p>every ball had</p>
<p>a rock in the center of it tied around with a rope</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible yeah</p>
<p>i mean what are</p>
<p>those fucking baseballs made out of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a ball of of</p>
<p>of string what do you</p>
<p>think of that nfl argument they said</p>
<p>like when this</p>
<p>stuff when they really profiled it this year</p>
<p>a lot you know all the people were leading with the</p>
<p>crown it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>right the top of your head</p>
<p>right and so</p>
<p>people were like that is like a fucking missile</p>
<p>come yeah it&rsquo;s a guy who runs like a four</p>
<p>three who weighs like two</p>
<p>twenty five going</p>
<p>and then just launching it into you</p>
<p>so like what can we do what can we do</p>
<p>and a bunch of people were like why don&rsquo;t we go back to</p>
<p>like 1940 style</p>
<p>no face mask</p>
<p>no face mask that way</p>
<p>you will have</p>
<p>the incentive</p>
<p>is there like</p>
<p>the fear of like that&rsquo;s how they played</p>
<p>right they played for years with no face mask</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna risk your face</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna tackle the way you&rsquo;re supposed to tackle</p>
<p>right and not</p>
<p>ruin your entire face it&rsquo;s football is a tricky</p>
<p>thing man because you can&rsquo;t un brutalitize it</p>
<p>right i mean i mean it&rsquo;s a brutal fucking game</p>
<p>yeah these guys are huge the biggest</p>
<p>scariest athletes in the</p>
<p>world they&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>full clip at each</p>
<p>other and smashing into each</p>
<p>other that&rsquo;s just inherently violent yeah that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what are you</p>
<p>gonna do you</p>
<p>gonna make it</p>
<p>slightly less violent by them not having a face cage</p>
<p>or you know or i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard the argument too that they</p>
<p>should be playing without helmets like rugby</p>
<p>players yeah</p>
<p>in a rugby player rugby is</p>
<p>apparently less dangerous</p>
<p>but the problem with that is once you already</p>
<p>start playing with helmets on</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a style of play totally</p>
<p>this tag you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna change the way you play</p>
<p>boxers found that out when they</p>
<p>first started</p>
<p>fighting in mma</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to</p>
<p>fight bare knuckle</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trickier because when you&rsquo;re boxing if you have</p>
<p>those padded gloves on</p>
<p>you can fuck</p>
<p>up and hit the guy on the top of the head and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to hurt your hands</p>
<p>but a good punch to the top of the head</p>
<p>might break your hand it&rsquo;s very possible to</p>
<p>break your hand</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>punching a guy with bare</p>
<p>knuckles you want to make sure you&rsquo;re getting his face</p>
<p>you want the soft</p>
<p>tissue around</p>
<p>the face and jaw that&rsquo;s in your eye his eyes his nose</p>
<p>his jaw&rsquo;s face you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna be hitting him up here</p>
<p>you can break</p>
<p>things and so</p>
<p>they had to adjust</p>
<p>their style</p>
<p>know guys had to realize that you know</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have your</p>
<p>hands up the same way either because there&rsquo;s no padding</p>
<p>right you can&rsquo;t just block</p>
<p>punches like that you have to like really cover up</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>you have to you can&rsquo;t play rope</p>
<p>a dope like ali</p>
<p>style you got</p>
<p>to get out of there you take too much damage with</p>
<p>those little</p>
<p>gloves on yeah</p>
<p>so they would have they</p>
<p>would have to be some sort of adjustment period but it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be football anymore</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>they took those helmets off</p>
<p>a lot of those boxers though they thought</p>
<p>they really thought that they</p>
<p>had it right they were like well i&rsquo;ll just go in the</p>
<p>yeah mms dude man he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got no hands we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going in showing some hands</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get a chance to show hands</p>
<p>guys who have</p>
<p>never grappled</p>
<p>literally have no idea how helpless they are</p>
<p>and the helpless feeling they get is so disheartening</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re so fucking helpless</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna roll that&rsquo;s what happens with a lot of</p>
<p>strikers a lot of</p>
<p>strikers they get into the game</p>
<p>as you know they come in i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a four time muay thai</p>
<p>champion looking to fuck some people up in mma</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like you&rsquo;re a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker come on in</p>
<p>take our wrestling class</p>
<p>boom over and over again</p>
<p>boom there&rsquo;s no way he can stay off</p>
<p>of his back this guy just gets launched through the air</p>
<p>every time a</p>
<p>wrestler wants to</p>
<p>he gets a single turns</p>
<p>the corner bang he&rsquo;s on his back he cannot stop it</p>
<p>and then he goes in a jiu jitsu</p>
<p>class what happens there</p>
<p>strangulation</p>
<p>over and over</p>
<p>again he&rsquo;s getting manhandled guys are like taking</p>
<p>breaks with</p>
<p>their knee on the</p>
<p>belly relaxing</p>
<p>cause they have him pinned down he</p>
<p>bucks and kicks and moves and then just take his back</p>
<p>choke him and tap him four five six times</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s humiliating</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not who he is who</p>
<p>he is is a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>right so there&rsquo;s like a there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>graveyard full of</p>
<p>fighters that never</p>
<p>learned how to get over</p>
<p>their ego and</p>
<p>learn how to grapple</p>
<p>yeah the whole shitload of them</p>
<p>they just decided they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna sprawl</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just gonna develop a good sprawl and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>never gonna really</p>
<p>learn jujitsu</p>
<p>and they just</p>
<p>never they never</p>
<p>could deal with getting tapped out</p>
<p>sure you know so all</p>
<p>these guys man</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the whole idea of</p>
<p>fighting in and of itself the idea of you know</p>
<p>going in there and and and fucking</p>
<p>taking over another man with your body</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna become a</p>
<p>point in time with that just like football it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be too brutal</p>
<p>for for where we are now</p>
<p>yeah you know what</p>
<p>i mean i mean we we&rsquo;re the more we find out too yeah</p>
<p>like the more we discover like no this is directly</p>
<p>correlated to that yes yeah</p>
<p>eventually i mean</p>
<p>right now they&rsquo;re both great</p>
<p>but a thousand years from now or</p>
<p>whatever the next</p>
<p>level of humanity is</p>
<p>we were clearly</p>
<p>human beings are evolving</p>
<p>i mean there was an</p>
<p>article that i had read</p>
<p>just yesterday i believe it was</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>human our dna is mutating as we</p>
<p>speak we&rsquo;re developing</p>
<p>twelve strands of dna</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s this there&rsquo;s all sorts of fucking</p>
<p>crazy evidence that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on right now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like some</p>
<p>child that was born with an</p>
<p>extra strand of dna and it&rsquo;s a terrible</p>
<p>birth defect poor kids all fucked up</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>the idea of</p>
<p>of evolution and the idea of mutations is that</p>
<p>sometimes a mutation is good and it</p>
<p>sticks and then</p>
<p>things move forward and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally how</p>
<p>things have gone</p>
<p>from being simple</p>
<p>organisms to being complex organisms like us</p>
<p>well as we get more and more complex man we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of shit that we like</p>
<p>right now that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna abandon</p>
<p>you know and football and</p>
<p>mma and you</p>
<p>know race car driving and shit</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be like whoa whoa whoa</p>
<p>what the fuck are you doing</p>
<p>so like people</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that argument now like i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard people like</p>
<p>you know that are</p>
<p>upset about mma</p>
<p>and you know i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>read criticisms</p>
<p>about me online because i&rsquo;m involved in this</p>
<p>oh sure but i</p>
<p>think in this</p>
<p>world that we&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>right now in this this life in this</p>
<p>existence it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>this so this</p>
<p>existence it&rsquo;s not really it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this is what it is you know yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>whole thing is</p>
<p>chaos it could</p>
<p>would it be different man if we didn&rsquo;t have mma</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t have football does it make society more</p>
<p>aggressive and more violent</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>think so i think</p>
<p>if anything the way we are</p>
<p>right now so</p>
<p>close to monkeys i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a release for us i</p>
<p>think it helps us get it out of our</p>
<p>system without</p>
<p>going to war i mean</p>
<p>if you look at like</p>
<p>human history like just</p>
<p>10 000 years ago is a tiny</p>
<p>blink of an eye</p>
<p>but 10 000 years ago</p>
<p>there was nothing but barbarians</p>
<p>there was nothing but</p>
<p>savages there was nothing i mean</p>
<p>we were basically cavemen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>blink of an eye</p>
<p>and throughout history all the</p>
<p>brave heart years and all the</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just war man the</p>
<p>roman empire the</p>
<p>greek empire</p>
<p>the the the the fucking</p>
<p>cretes the the</p>
<p>the persians there&rsquo;s there was so much war</p>
<p>going on man it was constant war yeah</p>
<p>and you know now</p>
<p>for the most part</p>
<p>things are pretty</p>
<p>civil except</p>
<p>weird things that we do in</p>
<p>other countries</p>
<p>where you know the wars are going on</p>
<p>where we ship people over there to</p>
<p>fight them yeah but in our society</p>
<p>things are like way safer</p>
<p>way calmer than</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve ever been before yeah we&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>civil sophisticated</p>
<p>especially considering that time</p>
<p>gabby that you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about yeah i mean</p>
<p>we have a brutal</p>
<p>brutal history i&rsquo;m saying as just</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>to each other</p>
<p>dude like the way that</p>
<p>just the way that that</p>
<p>fighting was done or even</p>
<p>150 years ago i mean you&rsquo;re talking fucking jabbing</p>
<p>bayonets and the people gutting them open like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a brutal way of</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>compassion for the person you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting you know what i mean like</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about kill shot kill shot kill shot</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>someone tweeted me something</p>
<p>about the the</p>
<p>the end of the</p>
<p>civil war was recently</p>
<p>and the guy said that two percent of the</p>
<p>population died</p>
<p>wow wow two percent</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>stop and think about that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking nuts man yeah</p>
<p>and the way they died</p>
<p>is just so awful i mean most of</p>
<p>those guys got shots died and slowly bled out yeah</p>
<p>horrible fucking infections are taking</p>
<p>place and you&rsquo;re not dying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i watch this</p>
<p>anthony bourdain</p>
<p>special and</p>
<p>not special his show that no reservation is</p>
<p>one of my favorite shows i love that show</p>
<p>and one of them he was in arkansas</p>
<p>they were talking</p>
<p>about how many murders happened</p>
<p>after the civil war was over</p>

<p>afterwards i</p>
<p>never thought</p>
<p>about that yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>severely you would know</p>
<p>about it my brother died in like</p>

<p>crazy place</p>
<p>right now man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re looking at each</p>
<p>other across this you know yeah this divide</p>
<p>yeah and they hate each</p>
<p>other and they look exactly the same yeah same people</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nuts and one of them is run by a complete</p>
<p>total fucking psychopath</p>
<p>total maniac man</p>
<p>how great was that team america</p>
<p>that they did</p>

<p>little fucking</p>
<p>you breaking my balls</p>
<p>you breaking my balls man my balls fucking giant</p>
<p>glasses on says the guy hans why you breaking my balls</p>
<p>you imagine</p>
<p>man just shitty roll the dice you&rsquo;re born in</p>
<p>north korea oh it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst i think</p>
<p>about that shitty roll the dice all the time yeah</p>
<p>oh my god do you mean</p>
<p>think about even</p>
<p>in living in</p>
<p>being born in botswana right</p>
<p>yeah botswana</p>
<p>one in four people</p>
<p>no excuse me one in five</p>
<p>one in five</p>
<p>twenty percent of the population</p>
<p>is hiv positive</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>and you just you did nothing but just</p>
<p>you were born there and that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard though</p>
<p>when in relationship</p>
<p>to aids in africa you know there are always statistics</p>
<p>about how many people get aids in africa</p>
<p>that a lot of it is not even tested it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>their t cells hit a certain</p>
<p>month they don&rsquo;t even test for hiv antibodies because</p>
<p>those tests are very expensive</p>
<p>and that a lot of what they call</p>
<p>aids is just people that are incredibly malnourished</p>
<p>and sick oh really so yeah and</p>
<p>the argument was was an</p>
<p>article online that</p>
<p>if people are</p>
<p>gonna call it aids and connect it to hiv</p>
<p>that there needs to be more stringent testing</p>
<p>because otherwise</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re confusing people as to why this one area where</p>
<p>just coincidentally has an incredibly low</p>
<p>nutrition rate means people people are malnourished</p>
<p>that sick yeah</p>
<p>all sorts of</p>
<p>other diseases and pathogens and</p>
<p>you know poop</p>
<p>fly poop all</p>
<p>kinds of shit that fucks with you over there yeah and</p>
<p>a lot of people are really sick i mean it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>super unhealthy</p>
<p>place to be oh my god yeah</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a malaria</p>
<p>everybody you know fucking malaria</p>
<p>larry is a little</p>
<p>problem got</p>
<p>george clooney</p>
<p>how about yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right yeah we almost lost almost lost george</p>
<p>well if you get</p>
<p>lyme disease</p>
<p>that shit stays with you forever forever man you</p>
<p>never cured you</p>
<p>never cured</p>
<p>right and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a vaccine is there a vaccine for</p>
<p>lyme disease</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>i think you get it you&rsquo;re fucked it&rsquo;s just one of</p>
<p>those things man</p>
<p>and malaria he must have had his malaria shot</p>
<p>right everybody gets malaria</p>
<p>shot before they go you have to get a</p>
<p>bunch of them</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just get one</p>
<p>you have to get a few</p>
<p>yeah george</p>
<p>dave foley was on the podcast and we had a</p>
<p>story about dave and he didn&rsquo;t even remember it because</p>
<p>that poor fuck when he was getting divorced</p>
<p>he was married to this crazy</p>
<p>broad who decided to take her kids all over the world</p>
<p>to try to torture him so when he was working</p>
<p>he would have to you know call bangladesh</p>
<p>and she was there and then he&rsquo;d have to fucking fly to</p>
<p>egypt and she was there he&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>fly over the</p>
<p>world to meet his kids</p>
<p>oh my god yeah and so you had to take malaria</p>
<p>medication well you&rsquo;re not supposed to</p>
<p>drink when you take malaria medication</p>
<p>and he took malaria</p>
<p>medication it</p>
<p>affects different people in different ways and he went</p>
<p>fucking loco</p>
<p>i think he day</p>
<p>fully nicest</p>
<p>calmest sanest guy ever like super</p>
<p>super sweet</p>
<p>i had to keep him from attacking a producer</p>
<p>like physically attack him i had to hold him in</p>
<p>place he was</p>
<p>going to attack somebody</p>
<p>and i was thinking what i was</p>
<p>doing like man of all the fucking people i thought that</p>
<p>would be stopping from hurting somebody</p>
<p>i was thinking</p>
<p>if dave wanted to hurt somebody i&rsquo;d be wanting</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be i&rsquo;d have his back you know i&rsquo;d be jumping in too</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s somebody who</p>
<p>got dave so mad sure dave</p>
<p>wants to assault him</p>
<p>boy that guy has to be a real</p>
<p>piece of shit yeah he was just</p>
<p>whacked on a malaria</p>
<p>menace and you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know it at the time oh i knew yeah you did know</p>
<p>okay yeah i knew there was something really</p>
<p>wrong he was just acting</p>
<p>completely crazy</p>
<p>he took these reporters</p>
<p>microphone the reporter</p>
<p>asked him for a</p>
<p>quote about news</p>
<p>radio and he</p>
<p>grabbed his little tape recorder and</p>
<p>stuffed it into his drink</p>
<p>to shove it into his</p>
<p>drink he goes there&rsquo;s your fucking</p>
<p>quote wow yeah</p>
<p>he was a fully</p>
<p>against that</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t even has no recollection this he</p>
<p>might as well been</p>
<p>under a witch&rsquo;s spell</p>
<p>i mean so great</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have any idea what was happening</p>
<p>that stuff fucking wax you out man</p>
<p>because i think</p>
<p>the way i don&rsquo;t know the way malaria</p>
<p>vaccinations go but with most vaccinations you know</p>
<p>you have to you&rsquo;re getting a little bit of the inner</p>
<p>you know disease yeah</p>
<p>right yeah i mean if you get</p>
<p>vaccinated for smallpox</p>
<p>i mean isn&rsquo;t isn&rsquo;t that how it works when you get</p>
<p>vaccinated for the flu</p>
<p>i know that&rsquo;s how it works oh</p>
<p>all vaccinations yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking like a strand of that is that always the case</p>
<p>i believe so</p>
<p>for vaccinations that&rsquo;s the only way that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tricking</p>
<p>your system</p>
<p>into developing an immunity</p>
<p>for it i think so yeah that&rsquo;s why i like when they</p>
<p>would when they</p>
<p>would do the big</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>what is it like 70 80 years ago</p>
<p>was polio right</p>
<p>right and they</p>
<p>would give people inadvertently</p>
<p>polio when giving them the vaccination sometimes yeah</p>
<p>sure what percentage</p>
<p>oh very small</p>
<p>but it would happen and you were taking that risk and i</p>
<p>guess you do</p>
<p>take that risk with</p>
<p>every vaccination</p>
<p>really no i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so i think</p>
<p>so i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re filled with mercury and all sorts of</p>
<p>other shit really</p>
<p>i remember when that h1n1 vaccination</p>
<p>was out some</p>
<p>people get sick from the well they were just like</p>
<p>hey by the way like</p>
<p>right before you get it like this isn&rsquo;t 100</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s up to you you want to make sure you</p>
<p>definitely well</p>
<p>no vaccination i</p>
<p>think is 100</p>
<p>but also what it does is it weakens your immune</p>
<p>system a bit</p>
<p>because it makes your immune</p>
<p>system fight</p>
<p>things off and then you&rsquo;re vulnerable to</p>
<p>other things that aren&rsquo;t protected by that vaccination</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also possible</p>
<p>the human immune</p>
<p>system is pretty fucking badass when you</p>
<p>think about it</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>weird is that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>what these colds really are it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a wars</p>
<p>going on is like when you&rsquo;re sick or calm</p>
<p>down on the</p>
<p>floor you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dying right</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a battle to stay</p>
<p>alive right now because you&rsquo;re losing your health</p>
<p>and that sniffles and coughing</p>
<p>it seems like</p>
<p>no big deal because you&rsquo;ve been there before and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be fine</p>
<p>but the reality is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fight</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having your organism is having a</p>
<p>fight against a team</p>
<p>your team is trying to take your body down yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>kinda creepy when you</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>it man you know that like you can only there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these strands of colds</p>
<p>and you only get</p>
<p>one of those strands each strand one time</p>
<p>really when you get a cold</p>
<p>and you get a cold like the next year</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a different strand</p>
<p>of that cold</p>
<p>really that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird so you</p>
<p>defeat a cold</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t get that cold again</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hundreds of strands</p>
<p>of the cold</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no like that&rsquo;s why the common cold like</p>
<p>there is no yeah there&rsquo;s hundreds of strands of that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always you know that your immune</p>
<p>system is compromised in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>right like if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hundred people that get exposed the same</p>
<p>thing usually</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hundred of them that get it oh yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right yeah yeah</p>
<p>and a hundred</p>
<p>of them won&rsquo;t get it it&rsquo;s fascinating yeah</p>
<p>it totally is and i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s fascinating like how</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>never question a lot of times what i&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>to fight stuff you know</p>
<p>antibiotics</p>
<p>oh my god antibiotic</p>
<p>any type of</p>
<p>medicine you</p>
<p>gotta be real</p>
<p>careful about antibiotics you know</p>
<p>do you take the full when you take them do you take</p>
<p>the full ride like if it says 10 days you don&rsquo;t quit</p>
<p>after five days do you no i mean i used to but now</p>
<p>everybody used to</p>
<p>yeah i used to</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst thing you</p>
<p>could ever do man let&rsquo;s just take the full</p>
<p>thing not take</p>
<p>it not take it not take it</p>
<p>yeah because that&rsquo;s when those</p>
<p>superbacteries rise</p>
<p>cause just like we</p>
<p>fight off immune</p>
<p>system our immune system</p>
<p>fights off colds yeah</p>
<p>well bacteria are the same way they</p>
<p>fight off anti</p>
<p>you know um</p>
<p>medication is trying</p>
<p>to to kill them</p>
<p>so when you um when you</p>
<p>what is this the type of</p>
<p>medication that you give you what was it</p>
<p>like what we call</p>
<p>the zpag exactly</p>
<p>yeah when you have those</p>
<p>apparently they get used to it</p>
<p>right so if like if you like for five days so you</p>
<p>take it for five days and then at the end of five days</p>
<p>you like yeah fuck</p>
<p>these e packs man i&rsquo;m feeling pretty good i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>those things give me the creeps</p>
<p>but when you put</p>
<p>those aside</p>
<p>the stuff that didn&rsquo;t die becomes like</p>
<p>supercharged oh and then</p>
<p>if you try to hit it with the z pack it&rsquo;s like bitch i</p>
<p>have that shit</p>
<p>oh wow yeah it survives it yeah</p>
<p>so the idea of being</p>
<p>ten days of antibiotics is that</p>
<p>you know when you get through all those</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>everything that shouldn&rsquo;t be there dead yeah</p>
<p>and including a lot of the good</p>
<p>stuff good stuff yeah you can like your</p>
<p>your endurance is terrible when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>antibiotics antibiotics</p>
<p>really bad man i took antibiotics because i had</p>
<p>staff yeah and</p>
<p>i was the staff was gone it was only like some little</p>
<p>prickly things on my legs</p>
<p>yeah and i was like it wasn&rsquo;t like a big</p>
<p>issue it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>small but within</p>
<p>two three days i</p>
<p>would go to</p>
<p>the gym you know and i couldn&rsquo;t do shit yeah i</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t do shit i was just exhausted it was like i was</p>
<p>drunk like i was hungover yeah</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>breaks your whole</p>
<p>system down it fucks you up</p>
<p>yeah and you have to take</p>
<p>stuff you have to take probiotics to</p>
<p>counteract it you know i didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>yeah yeah that you&rsquo;re supposed to you</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re supposed to tell you that you</p>
<p>should take acidopolis</p>
<p>you know drink yeah</p>
<p>drink milk eat</p>
<p>yogurt anything</p>
<p>where you have milk</p>
<p>culture acidove</p>
<p>was healthy bacteria</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of different kinds of healthy bacteria</p>
<p>dude this is the</p>
<p>first year in the years</p>
<p>where i got a cold</p>
<p>and i just let my body</p>
<p>naturally beat it like over</p>
<p>ten days oh really</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve never done that</p>
<p>what do you usually do i go</p>
<p>right to the doctor like give me some pills give me</p>
<p>something to take</p>
<p>care of this</p>
<p>like i hate i use i had</p>
<p>such bad allergies as a kid like</p>
<p>especially as a</p>
<p>teenager when we</p>
<p>lived in florida</p>
<p>and i would get like</p>
<p>horrible sinus infections</p>
<p>and it makes me</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s so miserable</p>
<p>not like it&rsquo;s more miserable</p>
<p>than anybody else&rsquo;s but like i just feel so miserable</p>
<p>that whenever i get like some type of sinus</p>
<p>thing going on i&rsquo;m like i</p>
<p>gotta cure this somehow</p>
<p>but this year i just</p>
<p>went through the</p>
<p>whole process and it was like i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>worse i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>worse i feel like shit and then</p>
<p>you kind of</p>
<p>you know you make</p>
<p>the turn then you&rsquo;re like i feel a little better today</p>
<p>and eventually</p>
<p>just by drinking tons of fluid</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>vitamin c or whatever just</p>
<p>taking care of myself sleeping</p>
<p>ten days it took me to beat a cold</p>
<p>so for normal a cold you</p>
<p>would go to</p>
<p>a doctor for a cold oh yeah if if i if i have a sinus</p>
<p>like clogged and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any like</p>
<p>color at all in my mucus</p>

<p>yeah it&rsquo;s an infection yeah so i&rsquo;d see a little bit of</p>
<p>color and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m gone i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m taking care of this</p>
<p>do you take vitamins and even</p>
<p>everything never</p>
<p>i should right</p>
<p>nah do you take a lot about you take</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah vitamins are good for you man you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get enough for your</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re super diligent</p>
<p>about your diet</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get what you need from your food</p>
<p>you just not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna make a big difference</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a shit called</p>
<p>pepsi ac that it used to take a lot that&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>what is it like for like heartburn</p>
<p>stomach acid and</p>
<p>stuff like that and recently for the last couple</p>
<p>months it&rsquo;s just been gone</p>
<p>and so like there&rsquo;s this whole weird thing</p>
<p>about it where</p>
<p>there johnson and johnson</p>
<p>saying that there was a couple packages during the</p>
<p>during the manufacturing that were punctured by mistake</p>
<p>and they had to</p>
<p>do a mystery or they had to pull all the packages you</p>
<p>know recall</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been months</p>
<p>and people are like not buying it because</p>
<p>you know if something happens and use it like that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cold but you know they make it and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>throwing back out</p>
<p>so then i was talking to this</p>
<p>other person</p>
<p>whose doctor said that it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>if you take</p>
<p>pepsi to see it</p>
<p>blocks something</p>
<p>important like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a potassium or something fucked up</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been trying to find it online i don&rsquo;t know what it</p>
<p>blocks but they were saying like</p>
<p>no they found out it did something</p>
<p>really fucked up and so they pulled it from the shelves</p>
<p>i personally have not been able to find it for like</p>
<p>three months</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t find well what did they say in that</p>
<p>article what does it say it does</p>
<p>well this article i&rsquo;m reading now is saying</p>
<p>serious disappearance of pepsi desi</p>
<p>complete and it talks</p>
<p>about like what they are saying to recall</p>
<p>but then they&rsquo;re also saying dude something&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right somebody&rsquo;s fibbing</p>
<p>about this whole</p>
<p>thing and there&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>whole conspiracy</p>
<p>about pepsi desi</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know what the whole</p>
<p>story is but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been hearing</p>
<p>things left and right</p>
<p>and i know if they had a manufacturing problem</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be</p>
<p>gone for three</p>
<p>months peps a day&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eve is like it&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>money they&rsquo;re losing yeah</p>
<p>how long do you</p>
<p>think they can</p>
<p>keep up that though if there&rsquo;s something up</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t what are you doing over there well i guess</p>
<p>sorry i guess</p>
<p>what i guess</p>
<p>i guess i was</p>
<p>reading something i</p>
<p>guess johnson</p>
<p>and johnson do this phantom recalls all the time</p>
<p>where they actually hire people to go into</p>
<p>stores and buy all this shit</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s in a</p>
<p>store like they&rsquo;ll hire</p>
<p>companies to go into a</p>
<p>store and buy everything</p>
<p>oh as opposed</p>
<p>to doing a public recall</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a phantom recall that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>whoa that is some gangster fucking crazy</p>
<p>shit whoa i</p>
<p>never heard of that</p>
<p>before that</p>
<p>should be illegal that</p>
<p>definitely should be illegal</p>

<p>like we obviously we have this horrible deficit</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s insane i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>understand it it&rsquo;s so massive</p>
<p>do you know that like a bunch of</p>
<p>corporations all the major ones</p>
<p>they do this</p>
<p>thing and somebody will probably find it like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called like the irish</p>
<p>some irish loophole like</p>
<p>irish is in the term somewhere</p>
<p>will they if you funnel it through it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>legal it&rsquo;s totally legal</p>
<p>if you set this up</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t pay</p>
<p>taxes on that money</p>
<p>what and if they just made that</p>
<p>that practice</p>
<p>like not legal then</p>
<p>all of each of</p>
<p>these massive</p>
<p>companies would be</p>
<p>obligated to pay</p>
<p>billions more than they do</p>
<p>but because this</p>
<p>thing is set up and they go</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s legal you can do it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no objection to it</p>
<p>they just what is this called</p>
<p>irish some irish loop</p>
<p>tax if you type in irish</p>
<p>tax loop well</p>
<p>you know general electric</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>story the uproar</p>
<p>about general electric general electric made</p>
<p>who knows how many fucking billion dollars fourteen</p>
<p>point two billion</p>
<p>in profits in two thousand ten they paid</p>
<p>zero in taxes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense and then</p>
<p>we go like well how can we how can we get</p>
<p>money to pay like</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m not even saying to</p>
<p>to rip them off how</p>
<p>about just making them pay whatever</p>
<p>the minimum is for</p>
<p>you know in</p>
<p>taxes for that kind of problem here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>crazy this is</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s really criminal the ceo</p>
<p>of general electric this guy</p>
<p>named jeffrey immelt</p>
<p>i m m e l t</p>
<p>he advises the president on business oh yeah</p>
<p>like what the fuck</p>
<p>this is insane these</p>
<p>these fucking people this is what gets really crazy</p>
<p>these fucking people that are involved in regulation</p>
<p>and this is what you</p>
<p>learn from that</p>
<p>movie inside job</p>
<p>from matt taiibis articles</p>
<p>these people that are involved in in</p>
<p>in regulating all these</p>
<p>these you know</p>
<p>trust funds and</p>
<p>these these</p>
<p>bankers and all this</p>
<p>all this corporate bullshit that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>they eventually get jobs working in that industry yeah</p>
<p>which is incredible yeah that</p>
<p>whole documentary shows you all</p>
<p>those people that you&rsquo;re like what like they&rsquo;re all the</p>
<p>right hand men to the</p>
<p>the presidents and</p>
<p>then when they&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>serving the public</p>
<p>they go to be lobbyists</p>
<p>who for corporations that will pay them</p>
<p>crazy money who they can now really use the inside</p>
<p>connections</p>
<p>that they have from having been in public do you</p>
<p>understand lobbyists do you</p>
<p>understand how that works</p>
<p>i mean on a very</p>
<p>basic level</p>
<p>and i wouldn&rsquo;t say that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>yeah me too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where i don&rsquo;t even look into it because it makes me</p>
<p>upset i look and i go it sounds</p>
<p>so like the</p>
<p>basic description just</p>
<p>sounds so creepy</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>manipulative and illegal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>weirdest fucking loophole in the</p>
<p>system ever if</p>
<p>you pay these people yeah and you</p>
<p>look the ufc has had to deal with a lot of</p>
<p>lobbyists in trying to make mma</p>
<p>legal and i&rsquo;ve had some conversations with dana</p>
<p>white where dana</p>
<p>white you know</p>
<p>pulled me aside he goes if you fuck this is</p>
<p>exact words</p>
<p>if you knew how this fucking</p>
<p>system really worked</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d want to jump out a window yeah</p>
<p>if you knew how corrupt it really is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking nuts</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s nuts and it&rsquo;s everyone</p>
<p>you know most people are ignorant</p>
<p>about it they don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>i mean me and you i mean we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about we&rsquo;re here complaining</p>
<p>about lobbyists</p>
<p>i mean if i had to give</p>
<p>a speech right now on what a</p>
<p>lobbyist is</p>
<p>you know sound a little clunky</p>
<p>check this out from 2007 to</p>
<p>2010 just google alone</p>
<p>save 3 1 billion</p>
<p>in taxes by using the double</p>
<p>irish tax loophole</p>
<p>which is it takes its profits</p>
<p>through ireland</p>
<p>and then through the netherlands and then off to a</p>
<p>haven in bermuda</p>
<p>and it saved it</p>
<p>goes down to its foreign tax rate down to two</p>
<p>point three</p>
<p>percent that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically saying like they&rsquo;re getting the tax benefit</p>
<p>of like not being an american company is</p>
<p>essentially what it</p>
<p>sounds like it&rsquo;s called double</p>
<p>irish or dutch sandwich it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>do you realize that&rsquo;s three</p>
<p>billion dollars that</p>
<p>essentially they should have paid in</p>
<p>taxes yeah that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re saying you don&rsquo;t have to because you funneled it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s totally legal and</p>
<p>google is one of</p>
<p>hundreds of companies that do this</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically the solution</p>
<p>like in it in</p>
<p>to our deficit is like</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s not i know</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a huge yeah</p>
<p>should be something yeah</p>
<p>microsoft&rsquo;s also done it it says</p>
<p>facebook is moving in this direction also</p>
<p>and apple oracle ibm they all do it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of money the</p>
<p>system is so fucking corrupt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>money i don&rsquo;t what is the fix</p>
<p>how do you fix</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s entangled in bullshit</p>
<p>like the whole</p>
<p>foundation of the financial system</p>
<p>that we operate</p>
<p>under the whole</p>
<p>foundation is</p>
<p>bullshit it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s not even based like</p>
<p>money&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>based on a thing anymore</p>
<p>it used to be</p>
<p>your dollar was supposed to represent a dollar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth of gold now it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>confidence you know</p>
<p>what how do you how do you fuck do you fix this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like you said the</p>
<p>system is such bullshit it&rsquo;s almost like fixing</p>
<p>the political</p>
<p>system like</p>
<p>you had any</p>
<p>faith in politics</p>
<p>you know i mean then you you get</p>
<p>older and you kind of</p>
<p>you hear the same</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re like oh this is all</p>
<p>a huge bullshit</p>
<p>show you know</p>
<p>common sense laws</p>
<p>there needs to be a guy</p>
<p>going seriously this is bullshit</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s a law but fuck you google pay us this</p>
<p>money you know there has to be like a common</p>
<p>sense law where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>voted by just ten normal guys going</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>you know what i mean yeah</p>
<p>that the thing is the reason</p>
<p>that these things</p>
<p>become law and you go that&rsquo;s impossible that&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>is because somebody has worked</p>
<p>to essentially pay off in in</p>
<p>in a way like i&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>these benefits if you make this</p>
<p>legal and then</p>
<p>a politician</p>
<p>we who legally goes goes</p>
<p>about making that practice</p>
<p>legal you know i mean like it</p>
<p>common sense tells you that shouldn&rsquo;t be legal</p>
<p>but enough people</p>
<p>surround these guys and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the incentives</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll get from this there&rsquo;s some incentive</p>
<p>going back to them</p>
<p>and then you make this illegal thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy but if you</p>
<p>could fit what do you do to fix it</p>
<p>i mean look</p>
<p>obviously there has to be some sort of financial</p>
<p>system there has to be some sort of a</p>
<p>system of government that runs us</p>
<p>how the fuck this</p>
<p>how would you fix this thing</p>
<p>you would you</p>
<p>would almost need</p>
<p>like somebody</p>
<p>who had extraordinary wealth and power</p>
<p>to be like i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>to go about</p>
<p>things like i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>about making</p>
<p>it easier for my</p>
<p>my level to get more rich and</p>
<p>powerful i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>i have a good</p>
<p>conscience i&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>which is like</p>
<p>becomes a fairy tale</p>
<p>clean house</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>shoot that guy</p>
<p>right in his fat</p>
<p>stupid head sure they would</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would have an orgy in money</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t you use his</p>
<p>blood and they</p>
<p>would pour down the</p>
<p>mouth of hookers</p>
<p>while they bang him in the ass yeah</p>
<p>chop their heads off and go bowling with them</p>
<p>once he was dead they</p>
<p>would go crazy they</p>
<p>would come over so yeah they</p>
<p>gotta be dead immediately didn&rsquo;t i what were you saying</p>
<p>like i had kind of like this</p>
<p>i was sort of</p>
<p>almost fantasizing in a way</p>
<p>when obama was</p>
<p>gonna take office i was like this is like</p>
<p>a different</p>
<p>this is gonna be a new thing</p>
<p>i thought it was kind of awesome it&rsquo;s the first time</p>
<p>i actually registered</p>
<p>to vote for during the elections i</p>
<p>never voted</p>
<p>in like before that yeah</p>
<p>and you know i mean</p>
<p>the reality is that you go oh</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s the same like they</p>
<p>were always the same</p>
<p>practices he&rsquo;s played more golf</p>
<p>in one term in his</p>
<p>three years</p>
<p>than bush had in</p>
<p>eight years</p>
<p>maybe bush wasn&rsquo;t golfer</p>
<p>i think one of the big criticisms</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that i fucking hate here&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that i hate</p>
<p>all these democrats that aren&rsquo;t saying a fucking word</p>
<p>about us going to afghanistan</p>
<p>us bombing libya and us</p>
<p>you know all the</p>
<p>crazy shit that we&rsquo;re doing overseas</p>
<p>they would be</p>
<p>screaming bloody</p>
<p>murder if there was a republican in office</p>
<p>people would be losing</p>
<p>their fucking mind of course they</p>
<p>would be calling him a killer they&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>camping out on his lawn</p>
<p>but because of the fact that he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>black guy and</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a democrat for some reason people are</p>
<p>disappointed</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>speaking up it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about empire</p>
<p>is in in motion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all playing</p>
<p>those teams man that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s what this</p>
<p>this presidency made me realize is that it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna say whatever he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna say his</p>
<p>everyone who&rsquo;s on in his</p>
<p>party is gonna support it</p>
<p>and that i i hate equally</p>
<p>the bullshit criticism you always hear</p>
<p>from another</p>
<p>party no matter what choice is made</p>
<p>right whatever he said that day like</p>
<p>of course president is just full of it</p>
<p>again the russians</p>
<p>of the world man like this is</p>
<p>here we go again with a dog and pony show and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always yeah and</p>
<p>people love to have an</p>
<p>ideology that&rsquo;s easy to follow</p>
<p>you know people love to have</p>
<p>you know like a megadios rush</p>

<p>about that a</p>
<p>lot of people</p>
<p>so these fucking cunts you know that&rsquo;s how they make</p>
<p>their living they make</p>
<p>their living appealing to a weakness in</p>
<p>human nature</p>
<p>to wanna be a part of a pack</p>
<p>that whole world is so depressing to me</p>
<p>to be like the</p>
<p>the talking head like</p>

<p>like that whole</p>
<p>world is like oh fuck and</p>

<p>starts laughing</p>
<p>about how there&rsquo;s so so many</p>
<p>white people here and then he comes up with this joke</p>
<p>yeah he does the joke on</p>
<p>stage what is the joke the joke is</p>
<p>basically that the flight is so long</p>
<p>that i thought i had died like</p>
<p>the flight goes on so long i was like i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m dead feels fake yeah feels fake like how</p>
<p>could you still be fine i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m dead and i</p>
<p>asked joe or am i dead</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like no you&rsquo;re not dead</p>
<p>then we walked off the plane</p>
<p>i saw all these</p>
<p>white people and i was like well if i&rsquo;m dead at</p>
<p>least i know i&rsquo;m in heaven</p>
<p>and and the</p>
<p>crowd was totally</p>
<p>into it too you know and it&rsquo;s a pretty like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s a joke that i</p>
<p>would never</p>
<p>think you have to explain to somebody like</p>
<p>like you get the joke</p>
<p>right like it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right so crazy that you like what</p>
<p>what do you mean like you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>black people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the joke right so</p>
<p>you know anyways i</p>
<p>i did we did the show in</p>
<p>sydney i&rsquo;m back a year</p>
<p>later i open with the same joke</p>
<p>right except i don&rsquo;t say joe</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re not there that</p>
<p>would be weird</p>
<p>but i i do the joke</p>
<p>people laugh</p>
<p>it gets a good response</p>
<p>and then i do a</p>
<p>second joke and this joke is definitely</p>
<p>harsher haha</p>
<p>but but no but i</p>
<p>think you the</p>
<p>okay the the next joke was that</p>
<p>uh unlike the</p>
<p>other yanks they were</p>
<p>gonna see i&rsquo;ve prepared myself</p>
<p>for my time in australia by</p>
<p>immersing myself in your</p>
<p>culture before i got here</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>drinking fosters</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been going to outback</p>
<p>steakhouse for authentic</p>
<p>australian cuisine</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been talking to mexican people</p>
<p>i said i think mexicans are our equivalent</p>
<p>of aboriginals well they</p>
<p>drink a lot and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>super lazy is that the</p>
<p>right thing</p>
<p>just like that right</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s like that that gets more of like a ooh</p>
<p>which when i did a version of that at your show it got</p>
<p>an applause</p>
<p>break that like was like ten</p>
<p>seconds long</p>
<p>okay like a</p>
<p>crazy applause</p>
<p>crowds different crowds but</p>
<p>regardless the joke there is not</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m like it&rsquo;s not me saying something mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the joke is i know that&rsquo;s your opinion of them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the joke</p>
<p>right right like</p>
<p>it only makes</p>
<p>sense because i know</p>
<p>as white australians that&rsquo;s what you guys say</p>
<p>about aboriginals that&rsquo;s the joke</p>
<p>right like that&rsquo;s how that works right so</p>
<p>anyways it gets like a oh kind of like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy and then</p>
<p>right away whatever back to the set</p>
<p>everything goes fine</p>
<p>great crowds</p>
<p>i get off stage</p>
<p>and we have like a</p>
<p>like a festival</p>
<p>show like a handler who like works for the staff</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like hey can i talk to you</p>
<p>like for a second and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>yeah she&rsquo;s like so</p>
<p>that was pretty</p>
<p>crazy and i was like</p>
<p>what was pretty crazy</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the aboriginal thing</p>
<p>whoa i was like</p>
<p>are you serious</p>
<p>right now she&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>sensitive subject here</p>
<p>and i was like yeah</p>
<p>i mean i figured</p>
<p>i figured as much and she&rsquo;s like well</p>
<p>you know like you</p>
<p>could really divide the room and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>yeah like i know how jokes work</p>
<p>you know like i i i know exactly what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>what went on there and like</p>
<p>like i got like a boot or something you know like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>standard to do a joke like this she&rsquo;s like well</p>
<p>if you could</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>want to keep doing that and i&rsquo;m like are you serious</p>
<p>right now like this is like the first time</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s somebody</p>
<p>i feel like i&rsquo;m explaining myself for a joke</p>
<p>since like high school</p>
<p>like when high</p>
<p>school when a</p>
<p>teacher how old</p>
<p>was this chick that you were talking to</p>
<p>older than me</p>
<p>in thirties</p>
<p>and like late 30s</p>
<p>maybe and was she just like</p>
<p>super liberal</p>
<p>yeah and i could tell that she it</p>
<p>was coming she was like reporting</p>
<p>for like a higher up that became kind of clear</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not in comedy</p>
<p>or something and you say something like that then</p>
<p>you kind of have to explain yourself like you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>yeah sorry like</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>like you like that&rsquo;s just how we talk or something</p>
<p>but like i&rsquo;m at a show i was just on</p>
<p>stage i wasn&rsquo;t buying a</p>
<p>drink at the</p>
<p>mall yeah it&rsquo;s a joke like</p>
<p>that was i thought that was over and they&rsquo;re like well</p>
<p>if you could uh</p>
<p>it would be</p>
<p>great if you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do that joke and i was like are you serious</p>
<p>right now and they&rsquo;re like yeah and i was like</p>
<p>i was like you know i know</p>
<p>how to do these like there&rsquo;s an inherent</p>
<p>risk in saying</p>
<p>a race joke</p>
<p>but like you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a tension moment and then if you have a joke</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>punch line like people</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a joke</p>
<p>like 99 of people</p>
<p>have done jokes way</p>
<p>harsher than that and people don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>why&rsquo;d you say that like that</p>
<p>you understand in the context</p>
<p>of performing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a joke</p>
<p>right so i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>alright uh yeah i</p>
<p>guess i mean i didn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>night i was just like you know i didn&rsquo;t even say that i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>again i was just like yeah no</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ll think</p>
<p>about it and they were like uh</p>
<p>okay and then</p>
<p>afterwards i see the</p>
<p>the festival people</p>
<p>and i can tell</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>happy with me</p>
<p>but you can just tell if you by reading body language</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re just kind of</p>
<p>flicking you off they&rsquo;re just kind now they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>kind of like</p>
<p>hey and then they see the</p>
<p>other people like hey what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>like to the people on my show and i was like</p>
<p>hey they&rsquo;re mad at me</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like also they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going out of the way to</p>
<p>be nicer to people around yeah</p>
<p>right in front of me</p>
<p>right in front of you and i was like this is</p>
<p>weird like i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>clubs obviously</p>
<p>where like they</p>
<p>might not be a hundred percent</p>
<p>on they might not be fancy</p>
<p>but they always</p>
<p>have like your back you know they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>right say whatever you want like you&rsquo;re a comic</p>
<p>these people were like</p>
<p>you know just kind of like looking down and like just</p>
<p>blatantly letting me know that like</p>
<p>not on board with what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>right now and i was like this is crazy</p>
<p>so the next day i go and like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to do the show and they&rsquo;re like ah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great so you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna do that joke</p>
<p>right wait a</p>
<p>minute all that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great that&rsquo;s how she</p>
<p>starts off the no just just like just like hey how&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>going um my</p>
<p>great like so you thought</p>
<p>about like not doing that joke</p>
<p>i was like look</p>
<p>i won&rsquo;t do the joke</p>
<p>tonight okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do a different</p>
<p>opening and i&rsquo;ll just do a different</p>
<p>different series of jokes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like okay</p>
<p>and then when i get off</p>
<p>stage they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so great and we&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>glad that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>dropped it from your set</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t make the</p>
<p>agreement i just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do it on this show we have ten more shows to go</p>
<p>but they were like no no no it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re done with it</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so glad</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re done with it and i was like really</p>
<p>then there was</p>
<p>a newspaper</p>
<p>article after the</p>
<p>first show did you</p>
<p>bring it yeah that&rsquo;s we got</p>
<p>right there yeah there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>but like this just shows you like how the different i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a huge difference between</p>
<p>like what we&rsquo;re used to seeing</p>
<p>comics say and do on stage</p>
<p>especially regarding race i feel like race is like</p>
<p>even though</p>
<p>every country has</p>
<p>their own issues with race</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re way more comfortable</p>
<p>in comedy clubs</p>
<p>with comics doing race</p>
<p>as a subject matter you know we&rsquo;re around it</p>
<p>some guys are really like</p>
<p>harsh with it but the actual topic is</p>
<p>like more open here</p>
<p>so the day after the</p>
<p>first show this guy wrote</p>
<p>tomsker opened with some essentially racist material</p>
<p>with which he</p>
<p>might have been deliberately attempting to offend</p>
<p>if the audience was offended they soon forgave him</p>
<p>blah blah blah some have topics were hacky um</p>
<p>what was hacky the</p>
<p>midget gag he wrote yeah</p>
<p>then he goes but he has a</p>
<p>nasty edge rarely seen in australia</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re like all right</p>
<p>then he further</p>
<p>comments in the comment section of his own</p>
<p>article like</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s still doing um i hope i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard that he</p>
<p>may not be doing the bigoted material anymore</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>the guy clearly</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get like</p>
<p>that either of</p>
<p>those were jokes</p>
<p>like they took them yeah but you saying</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a joke</p>
<p>and that all of a</p>
<p>sudden that forgives you from the sentiment of the</p>
<p>statement you know i mean just because it&rsquo;s a joke</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still not offensive it is a joke</p>
<p>you you is still offensive it can</p>
<p>still be offensive</p>
<p>but i think that</p>
<p>he also didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that the joke really is more like</p>
<p>every comic that i told it to there was like you</p>
<p>should keep doing that joke</p>
<p>every and then i</p>
<p>spoke to like friends of mine that were</p>
<p>locals that are not comics</p>
<p>and told them like</p>
<p>the one about lazy and they&rsquo;re like oh that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>true that&rsquo;s so true because that&rsquo;s what we all say that</p>
<p>about them it&rsquo;s more like they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>accepting the fact</p>
<p>i mean not the audience that the</p>
<p>staff was more not accepting the fact</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m saying something</p>
<p>that is true and that that</p>
<p>could hurt feelings</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re saying true in that they&rsquo;re lazy no</p>
<p>not that they&rsquo;re lazy</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>reason yeah</p>
<p>right but it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s also a very</p>
<p>racist perception because you</p>
<p>did if you know the history this is</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know this</p>
<p>until i did um rudy hill</p>
<p>when i did the</p>
<p>last shows that we did in australia the woman</p>
<p>who worked for the booking agent</p>
<p>explained to me why people are so sensitive</p>
<p>about aborigines</p>
<p>they used to</p>
<p>steal their babies</p>
<p>used to take their babies from them and make them</p>
<p>raise them with</p>
<p>white families</p>
<p>steal their fucking children to try to incorporate them</p>
<p>because these people were not adapting to the</p>
<p>australian way of life</p>
<p>that the white people were living</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>these poor people they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what the fuck they&rsquo;re doing so they went and took</p>
<p>their babies man</p>
<p>they did this shit for years</p>
<p>these poor fucking people grew up without</p>
<p>their own children</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s horrifying it&rsquo;s terrifying yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re just like american indians in the</p>
<p>way that you know american indians being displaced by</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>white man moving in</p>
<p>and taking over the old ways of life what they do they</p>
<p>wound up being defeated and drunk and</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>classic stereotype of american indian</p>
<p>being drunk and</p>
<p>angry well that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with</p>
<p>these aboriginal</p>
<p>people yeah but i&rsquo;m not arguing that like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>other than the fact that they&rsquo;re trying to tell me</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>being racist</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the part that i take</p>
<p>issue i&rsquo;m not taking</p>
<p>issue with any other part</p>
<p>of that not that it&rsquo;s you know you</p>
<p>should laugh at it or that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny or that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>insightful but</p>
<p>the fact is</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting upset</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m saying something</p>
<p>about their perception</p>
<p>of their own people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying it is if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole country like they all have that perception like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like saying the mexican</p>
<p>so us but yet to me i</p>
<p>might not have any problem with mexicans or i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re lazy but you&rsquo;re saying is</p>
<p>problem is that is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>widely held perception</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not acknowledging</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m offended</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking that with me</p>
<p>just because no no i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>agree with that because i</p>
<p>think even though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t acknowledge it they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with it</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s something that you</p>
<p>should be talking about</p>
<p>and picking on</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>you know i could see their</p>
<p>point of view man i really</p>
<p>i mean i kind well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a joke i know it&rsquo;s a joke it made me</p>
<p>laugh i thought it was</p>
<p>funny when you said it</p>
<p>look i don&rsquo;t mind</p>
<p>offensive jokes i like them i think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re funny</p>
<p>i mean i love</p>
<p>i love guys that say shit</p>
<p>that i know they don&rsquo;t even believe but they just say</p>
<p>norton is a perfect example</p>
<p>that half of his act is</p>
<p>horrible insulting you know</p>
<p>racist or not i</p>
<p>should say racist</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really racist</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s horribly insulting shit but</p>
<p>i know that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing but i take</p>
<p>issue with the fact</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m being that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sort of</p>
<p>classifying this as what i said</p>
<p>as the equivalent of</p>
<p>uh you know an in no</p>
<p>brand don&rsquo;t bother shutting that door</p>
<p>while you flush the toilets it&rsquo;s fine to</p>
<p>break through the</p>
<p>microphone to be interesting</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a background noise</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re qualifying what i&rsquo;m saying as</p>
<p>as like the</p>
<p>equivalent of</p>
<p>hey here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a racist</p>
<p>like internet joke like i&rsquo;m shitting on them</p>
<p>but i do feel like</p>
<p>that the joke</p>
<p>is really more</p>
<p>about i i don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m not saying you can&rsquo;t you do not</p>
<p>agree with the</p>
<p>with my perception of it but the</p>
<p>the joke is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>using i&rsquo;m actually being making the joke</p>
<p>on the mexican person that&rsquo;s not fair to them</p>
<p>but the equivalent i&rsquo;m saying is you guys</p>
<p>think that of</p>
<p>aboriginals and you can say that well not all of us do</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a widely held</p>
<p>perspective</p>
<p>among white australian</p>
<p>right okay how is that any different than doing a</p>
<p>black people or lazy joke</p>
<p>um how is it any different than</p>
<p>black people yeah cause</p>
<p>mexicans don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>feelings how is it how is it any different like</p>
<p>you know what what you&rsquo;re saying is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>implying that</p>
<p>these people are lazy</p>
<p>right like i&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>not trying to</p>
<p>break down the material but if someone</p>
<p>said a really</p>
<p>racist joke</p>
<p>about black people about</p>
<p>black people being lazy and welfare and this and that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>racist joke and it will appeal to some people it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s a widely held belief</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s acknowledged that there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p>
<p>do feel that way and if you say some really fucked up</p>
<p>racist joke</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain percentage of the</p>
<p>population is</p>
<p>gonna laugh at that</p>
<p>how is that any different</p>
<p>than making fun of</p>
<p>these aboriginal people</p>
<p>well i mean again like</p>
<p>in the joke that i said</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying that like i</p>
<p>spoke to mexicans i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re like aboriginals well they</p>
<p>drink a lot</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re super lazy</p>
<p>cause i know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>right in my mind that&rsquo;s your perception of them right</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s more like i&rsquo;m highlighting to you</p>
<p>some true perception of them</p>
<p>right but for me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying that like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the truth that i see in you</p>
<p>about those people</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t see it as</p>
<p>i guess in my mind i&rsquo;m not seeing it as</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;m calling them</p>
<p>lazy and drunk</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying i know that you call them lazy and</p>
<p>drunk well look</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s my point i</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny and i think you</p>
<p>should keep saying it because</p>
<p>guess what a</p>
<p>lot of them are fucking lazy and a lot of them are</p>
<p>drunk right</p>
<p>they think it&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p>and they think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>racist because</p>
<p>these people are downtrodden</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really fucked up situation and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right too they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right too but they&rsquo;re also like hey don&rsquo;t joke</p>
<p>about that thing that we</p>
<p>feel bad about</p>
<p>right is kind of what what i&rsquo;m being</p>
<p>is what i feel like and then</p>
<p>well the other the</p>
<p>second part to this is that</p>
<p>like five days later</p>
<p>the same guy who</p>
<p>reviewed me</p>
<p>that first night</p>
<p>wrote an article</p>
<p>called racism</p>
<p>or political correctness gone mad</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an article</p>
<p>where he writes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like he</p>
<p>starts off talking</p>
<p>about an episode</p>
<p>oh well he says</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t hide from this relationship</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my responsibility to deal with it i mean</p>
<p>what kind of man</p>
<p>would i be if i ran off now</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;d be a black man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the answer</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s from an episode of the family guy</p>
<p>so he starts writing that</p>
<p>like the joke is like stewie&rsquo;s like saying you know</p>
<p>if you left now what</p>
<p>would you be i&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>black like a guy that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t take care of his kids</p>
<p>right so that was the joke and then he</p>
<p>starts examining</p>
<p>like that type of material and then</p>
<p>he brings up</p>
<p>yours truly</p>
<p>by saying um</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like i came to mind last week when the</p>
<p>time secret open the show by declaring how</p>
<p>great it was to be in melbourne</p>
<p>because there are so many</p>
<p>white people here</p>
<p>which is not what i said i said it was like heaven</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>went on to making a joke comparing aborigines</p>
<p>and mexicans</p>
<p>which i won&rsquo;t repeat here</p>
<p>and then he says</p>
<p>the audience gasped but</p>
<p>still seem to</p>
<p>enjoy the rest of his set</p>
<p>where he ranted against</p>
<p>stupid people about</p>
<p>what surprised</p>
<p>me the most was that a couple audience members i</p>
<p>spoke to afterwards had</p>
<p>completely forgotten forgotten</p>
<p>about the opening mind</p>
<p>opening line</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>apparently didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hold on to that as much as he wanted them to</p>
<p>but to his mind</p>
<p>i was deliberately trying to</p>
<p>shock the audience from the outset</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>racist but i</p>
<p>think he was doing something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s considered fine on the us comedy circuit</p>
<p>so are we too sensitive here in australia</p>
<p>jokes on race are probably the last remaining</p>
<p>taboo in australian comedy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a free for all for pretty much any</p>
<p>other thing pedophiles incest jokes</p>
<p>and then his own take is that</p>
<p>in some parts of the us namely new york and california</p>
<p>they seem to move into a post political correctness era</p>
<p>while milk america is</p>
<p>still stuck in pre</p>
<p>political correctness</p>
<p>um and he also</p>
<p>goes on to talk about</p>
<p>the right to free speech</p>
<p>and playing</p>
<p>a part and aren&rsquo;t doing this but i don&rsquo;t really think</p>
<p>that writer</p>
<p>sounds like a</p>
<p>moron yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s accurate at all</p>
<p>but i do think that</p>
<p>the article at least</p>
<p>asked the question that i kind of wanted</p>
<p>the other people</p>
<p>like on the</p>
<p>staff to ask</p>
<p>which was like</p>
<p>are we being</p>
<p>hypersensitive to something like i</p>
<p>clearly touch the</p>
<p>nerve in a few people that work there</p>
<p>with that joke if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>touch nerves in comedy then what are you</p>
<p>doing you&rsquo;re taking that you&rsquo;re taking so much off the</p>
<p>table if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>touch nerves i</p>
<p>think so too it&rsquo;s like saying i</p>
<p>wanna go see a</p>
<p>movie but i want no violence and no sex</p>
<p>please tell a nice</p>
<p>story yeah it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>ready g you mean</p>
<p>look you know i</p>
<p>enjoy a good violent</p>
<p>movie right</p>
<p>and rappers have had this argument</p>
<p>for years like how is what they&rsquo;re doing different than</p>
<p>the movie scarface</p>
<p>yeah you know they</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not providing fictional</p>
<p>entertainment that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re providing</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re giving you an outlet for this kind of shit</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just look man</p>
<p>especially when you got a couple of</p>
<p>drinks in you</p>
<p>some inappropriate</p>
<p>you know ridiculous</p>
<p>off colour jokes are hilarious sure</p>
<p>yeah what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with that kind of</p>
<p>entertainment it&rsquo;s what makes me</p>
<p>laugh it&rsquo;s like i mean and i</p>
<p>gotta say like i don&rsquo;t just do</p>
<p>race material but i always do</p>
<p>something usually like involving race</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just part of something that i always find</p>
<p>inherently interesting</p>
<p>and funny and</p>
<p>i usually i feel like</p>
<p>the context of it being in a joke though does make it</p>
<p>somewhat different like i joke</p>
<p>about it on</p>
<p>stage i joke</p>
<p>about it on twitter</p>
<p>i joke about it in real life</p>
<p>and there is a line and there&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>a hateful line i feel like and a line</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s own line</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s subjective</p>
<p>but i just feel like that</p>
<p>there is a place</p>
<p>to say well like</p>
<p>that these are jokes</p>
<p>do you feel like as you get more</p>
<p>famous and more</p>
<p>known for your comedy that</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have more of a responsibility to balance it out</p>
<p>yeah like you&rsquo;ll have like a</p>
<p>black joke but you better have some</p>
<p>white people jokes in there too oh yeah</p>
<p>well the thing that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>found the most is that</p>
<p>when i go out and i do like a full show full hour show</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never had anybody</p>
<p>really say anything</p>
<p>cause usually what people say is like</p>
<p>hey when you shit on whatever</p>
<p>i would have gotten mad but you give it out so evenly</p>
<p>like i feel like you know</p>
<p>you made fun of</p>
<p>mexicans in yourself too</p>
<p>and myself so they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>yeah you made fun of</p>
<p>everything therefore it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>if you do a</p>
<p>shorter set</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re much more like</p>
<p>i mean you think</p>
<p>about it we were only doing</p>
<p>twenty minute sets</p>
<p>in this thing</p>
<p>the twenty minute set</p>
<p>those two jokes that i told you</p>
<p>uh one of them i mean the</p>
<p>white with the</p>
<p>white people</p>
<p>one is like it&rsquo;s it blows my mind that somebody</p>
<p>would be offended by that like that they really</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get that that&rsquo;s a joke but</p>
<p>those two things took 45</p>
<p>seconds to tell</p>
<p>and they still</p>
<p>stood out this is</p>
<p>again i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t tell that it&rsquo;s a joke it&rsquo;s just they</p>
<p>think that the sentiment is mean yeah</p>
<p>no that comes across to me</p>
<p>yeah racism</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>for one but do you</p>
<p>think do you</p>
<p>think this is something that terrei</p>
<p>told us last week</p>
<p>not for tickling player</p>
<p>do you think if you</p>
<p>would have done the jokes you</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>fired from the tour</p>
<p>if what if you</p>
<p>would have continued</p>
<p>to do the jokes all ten shows do you</p>
<p>think you would have been</p>
<p>fired from oh dude</p>
<p>listen the the way</p>
<p>the thing that</p>
<p>stood out to me the most isn&rsquo;t even this article</p>
<p>or or anybody&rsquo;s review or anything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that that that</p>
<p>that staff was</p>
<p>so disapproving</p>
<p>of what i had said well there are</p>
<p>two types big time</p>
<p>the festival people</p>
<p>yeah i mean rt</p>
<p>festival type people man that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna be something</p>
<p>to answer your question</p>
<p>yes i think</p>
<p>i would have been</p>
<p>asked to leave</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>comedy festivals are a hard time to man because you</p>
<p>never know what they&rsquo;re into the people that they</p>
<p>might be into alternative comedy and they</p>
<p>might think that</p>
<p>you know the type of</p>
<p>stuff you&rsquo;re doing is too crass or too mainstream and</p>
<p>you know a lot</p>
<p>of people who are comedy nerds like really and i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like people who are only into the pixies yeah i</p>
<p>mean if i&rsquo;m in your car you put on the pixies i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go what</p>
<p>the fuck is this and why are you making me listen to it</p>
<p>you know what i mean what you&rsquo;re too cool</p>
<p>for the doors</p>
<p>yeah yeah you&rsquo;re too cool for</p>
<p>would you have done this</p>
<p>continue to do</p>
<p>the joke so they</p>
<p>would have said the same</p>
<p>thing to you i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have done the joke in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not my</p>
<p>style of comedy</p>
<p>right i would have done</p>
<p>it i would have done something different</p>
<p>and if i felt like i liked it yes</p>
<p>yeah i would have done it yeah for sure</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of people that i like</p>
<p>that have jokes that i</p>
<p>laugh at but i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do that&rsquo;s one of them</p>

<p>crazy sure you know so he&rsquo;s over here now he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spending a lot of time over here trying to put he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funny guy totally yeah you know but</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s fascinating fascinating</p>
<p>that jim jeffries</p>
<p>right super</p>
<p>funny massive</p>
<p>in the uk massive in the uk</p>
<p>big here does</p>
<p>really well does a lot of you know sells out</p>
<p>venues all the time</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even go to australia</p>
<p>which is his home country</p>
<p>and he he did</p>
<p>they told me he did a gala they do this gala</p>
<p>a big show to launch the festival</p>
<p>so they do is they have like</p>
<p>twenty eight comics</p>
<p>everybody has</p>
<p>three minutes and they broadcast it nationally</p>
<p>like like a</p>
<p>quarter of the</p>
<p>population of the country sees this</p>
<p>this gala event</p>
<p>and jim did one</p>
<p>where he did</p>
<p>he just did a</p>
<p>three minute</p>
<p>thing and his opening joke was</p>
<p>about like how he got in the car with a girl</p>
<p>and the girl was like</p>
<p>hold on one second</p>
<p>i can make a</p>
<p>phone call she</p>
<p>calls she&rsquo;s like hey yeah i&rsquo;m taking this guy</p>
<p>home what was your name</p>
<p>again he was like it&rsquo;s jim jeffrey she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i was jim jeffries</p>
<p>so if anything happens to me jim jeffries</p>
<p>jim jeffries okay</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sorry just had to do that because i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know you and he goes well that&rsquo;s fine it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna make this rape a little awkward</p>
<p>that was like the joke or some something</p>
<p>along those lines the</p>
<p>place went like</p>
<p>silent like fucking</p>
<p>deathly silent</p>
<p>and then they were like</p>
<p>totally turned off by him</p>
<p>and he had like a terrible run</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even go back</p>
<p>to australia</p>
<p>from one show</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying i</p>
<p>think he had a bad he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>complex he&rsquo;s got a bit of a complex</p>
<p>cause i was talking on</p>
<p>where at the improv</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like i can&rsquo;t even fucking sell tickets</p>
<p>in australia he was really mad yeah i was really mad i</p>
<p>think i mean a lot of that has to be the fact that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>oddly enough more</p>
<p>successful in the bigger markets</p>
<p>like uk united</p>
<p>states he&rsquo;s bigger so what the</p>
<p>australians don&rsquo;t like him for that you</p>
<p>think i i don&rsquo;t know what it is but i i think</p>
<p>maybe now like if he</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s become more of a name outside he can go back</p>
<p>and do well</p>
<p>but i just find it interesting that like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s clearly the third</p>
<p>market in that tier</p>
<p>in that group</p>
<p>and you would</p>
<p>think that like</p>
<p>a guy who&rsquo;s had the</p>
<p>success that he&rsquo;s had is</p>
<p>really huge in the uk</p>
<p>and like you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pretty big name here</p>
<p>that he doesn&rsquo;t go back</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t go back there who the fuck knows what people like</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s probably the</p>
<p>whole usa is</p>
<p>super cool thing too</p>
<p>going on you know like</p>
<p>where you have like an american person</p>
<p>going to the australia that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s popular</p>
<p>about it because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re american</p>
<p>you know american comic</p>

<p>of like how japanese people like levi&rsquo;s you know</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny that&rsquo;s the guy that reviewed you no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the guy</p>
<p>no i had to</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s the name right</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s who they used</p>
<p>they compared me to him</p>
<p>really because</p>
<p>he says a lot of rude shit he said that shit</p>
<p>about mexicans on his show</p>
<p>you heard what he said what do you say</p>
<p>about mexicans on his show oh yeah</p>
<p>they got in</p>
<p>big trouble big trouble</p>
<p>what happened they said they were reviewing a car and i</p>
<p>guess the car</p>
<p>was yet to be</p>
<p>made or something and like it&rsquo;s coming it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be from mexico</p>
<p>and he was like well</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure that car will be like a real</p>
<p>piece of shit</p>
<p>because you know mexicans just sit around they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>super drunk</p>
<p>um and they don&rsquo;t really do anything so that car</p>
<p>will probably be just like that people like oh my god</p>
<p>and like mexican consulate was like</p>
<p>you need we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking pull our</p>
<p>embassy out of there like you guys need to apologize</p>

<p>i support you jeremy</p>
<p>sensitive yeah wow</p>
<p>i mean his was</p>
<p>it was kind of i</p>
<p>think it was like kind of went on a little bit</p>
<p>right like he kind of hit the</p>
<p>point a few more times this weekend i was in solvain</p>
<p>which is north of</p>
<p>santa barbara it&rsquo;s like a wine country and there was no</p>
<p>black people there like none zero</p>
<p>and we were talking</p>
<p>about the whole weekend how</p>
<p>crazy we were</p>
<p>actually trying to play a game to try to find the</p>
<p>first black person there</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>sitting there in our car and we&rsquo;re kind of buzzed and</p>
<p>stuff and suddenly this</p>
<p>black guy just</p>
<p>knocks on my door i&rsquo;m like oh shit here it goes</p>
<p>what the fuck why is he</p>
<p>knocking on my window and he goes</p>
<p>excuse me you have a tree branch</p>
<p>under your tire let</p>
<p>me get this for you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like oh thanks</p>
<p>so freaked out</p>
<p>wow you&rsquo;re a mess</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see him for a</p>
<p>while yeah yeah pop out and</p>
<p>knock on the window this is what jeremy</p>
<p>clarkson said</p>
<p>about mexicans in his column</p>
<p>mexico doesn&rsquo;t have an</p>
<p>olympic team because anyone who</p>
<p>could run jump or swim is already across the border</p>
<p>but what did he say on that show</p>
<p>you got this out there</p>
<p>says there yeah but here&rsquo;s some fucking wack ass shit</p>
<p>some comedian attacked them</p>
<p>some comedian named</p>
<p>steve coogan</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s a big british</p>
<p>comic is he</p>
<p>yeah yeah he attacked them</p>
<p>calling them a</p>
<p>bully because of what they said</p>
<p>about mexico</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weak shit</p>
<p>right there this is one</p>
<p>other thing i</p>
<p>gotta tell you</p>
<p>this is and this i feel like is a hundred percent true</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an example of it it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>white people that are ever offended for people</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ve said offensive</p>
<p>things at shows before</p>
<p>that in my mind whatever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the context of the joke or whatever and like</p>
<p>the same joke that a</p>
<p>black guy has hugged me for i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna give you a fucking hug</p>
<p>after the show</p>
<p>that shit was hilarious man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had white people</p>
<p>uh approach me</p>
<p>right so you can say jokes</p>
<p>about white people but</p>
<p>black people won&rsquo;t get offended at you saying</p>
<p>those jokes</p>
<p>about white people</p>
<p>but if you say jokes</p>
<p>about black people</p>
<p>white people will get offended</p>
<p>right if you say jokes about</p>
<p>black people</p>
<p>white people will get offended for them and that same</p>
<p>black person or mexican person whomever</p>
<p>was will be like that was a</p>
<p>funny joke maybe</p>
<p>maybe some one or two</p>
<p>right but the point is</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>could say a joke</p>
<p>about white people yeah</p>
<p>black people</p>
<p>never come up</p>
<p>to you and go that you&rsquo;re fucked up oh you</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>never done that</p>
<p>never never</p>
<p>never yeah tricky</p>
<p>right and most of the time though when you do jokes</p>
<p>about race so it is</p>
<p>a minority person</p>
<p>that is not offended by it</p>
<p>right like that</p>
<p>that applauds it in some way like</p>
<p>whatever that</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s that you know i got the joke i like the joke</p>
<p>white people though</p>
<p>love to tell you how offended they are</p>
<p>for that group</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m so i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not okay like really</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re telling me that</p>
<p>you have some</p>
<p>vested interest in</p>
<p>defending a</p>
<p>group that you are not a part of</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re offended for</p>
<p>this steve coogan guy</p>
<p>annoys the fuck out of me</p>
<p>what do you say this is what he says the lads talking</p>
<p>about jeremy</p>
<p>clark&rsquo;s jeremy</p>
<p>clarkson and james may</p>
<p>and richard hammond on the show who</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re funny guys man they say funny shit</p>
<p>and they shit on each</p>
<p>other they call each</p>
<p>other idiots and imbeciles all the time</p>
<p>like you know jeremy</p>
<p>clarkson was driving a car like look at him he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically a baboon</p>
<p>you know like they&rsquo;re constantly shitting on each other</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the show</p>
<p>so this is what this moron says</p>
<p>this is this</p>
<p>this coogan</p>
<p>crap character who just</p>
<p>called him a bully</p>
<p>he said the lads have this strange notion</p>
<p>that if they are being offensive it bestows upon them</p>
<p>a kind of anti establishment aura of coolness</p>
<p>in fact like</p>
<p>their leather jackets and</p>
<p>jeans it&rsquo;s uber conservative</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t cool</p>
<p>the fuck are you talking about</p>
<p>what you you&rsquo;re saying what&rsquo;s cool and not cool</p>
<p>first of all shut up</p>
<p>stupid yeah</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>telling people what&rsquo;s cool and what&rsquo;s not cool cause</p>
<p>anti establishment because they</p>
<p>they like to be offensive</p>
<p>they like to be offensive</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>stupid yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>thing and if you&rsquo;re not offensive you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not offensive at all yeah i bet you&rsquo;re not funny yeah</p>
<p>i bet you&rsquo;re not i bet if this is what you&rsquo;re attacking</p>
<p>a funny joke</p>
<p>about mexican</p>
<p>swimmers jumpers and fucking runners</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>write an article</p>

<p>greatest fucking export you people have ever had</p>
<p>jealous he is jealous</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to get attention and he got it he</p>
<p>got it from everybody including me i&rsquo;m a fool i played</p>
<p>right into his hand</p>
<p>god damn it he knows what he was doing</p>
<p>i just man i</p>
<p>have a real hard time with anybody who has like mock</p>
<p>anger you know yeah</p>
<p>mock upset you know</p>
<p>i got into a real fucking serious like almost i got a</p>
<p>fight with this bartender in new york once</p>
<p>because he was trying to</p>
<p>pretend to this woman</p>
<p>you know that he was like some</p>
<p>super fucking defender feminist</p>
<p>sort of a guy</p>
<p>and it was about</p>
<p>oj simpson you know they were talking</p>
<p>about oj simpson</p>
<p>and you know and</p>
<p>we were sitting around</p>
<p>talking and it was me and the waitress were talking</p>
<p>and the bartender kind of chimed in and cock blocked</p>
<p>to shut me down</p>
<p>but you know she</p>
<p>was saying how well he beat the shit out of his wife</p>
<p>i go well i go he was</p>
<p>he did something</p>
<p>where they had a restraining order</p>
<p>against him</p>
<p>i go but that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean anything when people are</p>
<p>breaking up people do nutty shit</p>
<p>yeah you never know</p>
<p>and then so the fucking bartender comes over</p>
<p>leans over the bar like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scolding me</p>
<p>and said he pleaded</p>
<p>no contest do you</p>
<p>understand what that means</p>
<p>that means he beats women</p>
<p>and he did it like out of nowhere like we</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t even having a conversation</p>
<p>all i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>is that sometimes when relationships go bad man</p>
<p>people accuse people of all kinds of</p>
<p>crazy shit to get custody of the kids to get more</p>
<p>money to get</p>
<p>you know to put the balance of</p>
<p>power on their side and when it comes to</p>
<p>the legal proceedings</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i was saying was that like yeah</p>
<p>you never know what the fuck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with two people</p>
<p>break up cause i&rsquo;ve seen some naughty shit myself</p>
<p>this motherfucker</p>
<p>leaned over the counter</p>
<p>to like to scold me</p>
<p>to be captain save a hoe in</p>
<p>front of this girl</p>
<p>i was like wow</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>upset at you know at me over this like</p>
<p>there has to be something else</p>
<p>i have must have done something to you before</p>
<p>which i hadn&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>never even saw the guy</p>
<p>or your captain save a hoe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re that asshole that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna pretend that you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>super sensitive and cool and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>people like you yeah</p>
<p>yeah that that that</p>
<p>being super sensitive</p>
<p>is not helping anybody man</p>
<p>that shit ain&rsquo;t helping anybody i</p>
<p>i actually kind of subscribed to the idea too that like</p>
<p>there is i don&rsquo;t really believe in</p>
<p>at least comics</p>
<p>being offended by</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>finding things offensive in jokes like on stage</p>
<p>i i i have a kind of a problem with like</p>
<p>like you know there was a joke there where like</p>
<p>somebody told another joke</p>
<p>about like a separate</p>
<p>thing but the person was like i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be cool with that and i was like</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>essentially when you say that you&rsquo;re saying like</p>
<p>everything else is cool you can talk</p>
<p>about all these</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s more uncomfortable with fat jokes</p>
<p>just because it seems like that</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re fat</p>
<p>well no because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen people in the audience</p>
<p>no no i mean</p>
<p>cause i have i have fat jokes and</p>
<p>i say i feel uncomfortable saying it is what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>yeah because</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been in audiences before</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>the audience just sit there and just like hold</p>
<p>their head like they&rsquo;re fucking sad</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about how fat they are</p>
<p>oh right yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a lot of shit on fat people way too easy</p>
<p>yeah i mean it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>their own fault</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re the one who</p>
<p>ate the food</p>
<p>right but still</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>how is it any different than shitting on poor people</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>their fault too</p>
<p>right they have been</p>
<p>alive on this</p>
<p>earth x amount of years it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their job to accumulate enough</p>
<p>money to not be poor yeah</p>
<p>but yeah you know you shit on poor people it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>very poor taste you know it</p>
<p>feels awful</p>
<p>you know but you shit on fat people it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re both people who have you know</p>
<p>been in a bad circumstance and made bad decisions</p>
<p>probably you know but yeah fat people</p>
<p>are they don&rsquo;t nobody backs them up</p>
<p>yeah i i don&rsquo;t like doing it i</p>
<p>guess i just i</p>
<p>think like i mean</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re across the</p>
<p>board some people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like jokes that they feel like have a mean</p>
<p>edge or nastiness behind them</p>
<p>but some people are like are fine with like let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know a mexican joke that they</p>
<p>were like that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>but then they&rsquo;ll be offended by</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>fat joke or something like that or abortion joke</p>
<p>abortion is a huge one</p>
<p>right but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>really you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>like so that</p>
<p>should the show cater to you</p>
<p>like is that</p>
<p>essentially what you&rsquo;re asking for</p>
<p>are you gonna</p>
<p>dictate the terms</p>
<p>of the show now</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s a real problem</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know who you are before you go up there</p>
<p>yeah if you</p>
<p>if they get into the tom</p>
<p>segura mindset</p>
<p>and they listen to your podcast devoutly and then they</p>
<p>is that a word</p>
<p>and they come to</p>
<p>they come to see you</p>
<p>at a show and they know</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re getting they&rsquo;re there for the fucking tom</p>
<p>segura show</p>
<p>right you know they know your</p>
<p>style of comedy</p>
<p>if they have no idea who the fuck you</p>
<p>are and you just do some show somewhere and you show up</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s like well who&rsquo;s this tom</p>
<p>seguru guy why is he shitting on aboriginals</p>
<p>right right yeah you know</p>
<p>yeah yeah exactly i mean and i</p>
<p>think the big</p>
<p>thing was like</p>
<p>doing like i said</p>
<p>or can you do like a full show</p>
<p>and people almost are never</p>
<p>upset because they see the full</p>
<p>thing they had the</p>
<p>whole meal you know what i mean</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>i see what you do</p>
<p>like you said</p>
<p>you make fun of yourself you make fun of all these</p>
<p>groups it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really say like i&rsquo;m offended cause</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being selective</p>
<p>about the one thing</p>
<p>right you give</p>
<p>it evenly you give it across the board</p>
<p>yeah yeah and and you sort of</p>
<p>see that there are</p>
<p>not no sake there&rsquo;s nothing sacred no subjects</p>
<p>are sacred yeah i mean you have to have people that get</p>
<p>fucking heated with</p>
<p>things that you say</p>
<p>right all the time</p>
<p>i mean not necessarily i really pretty easy going</p>
<p>yeah i mean i&rsquo;ve had a few people get</p>
<p>upset at me at</p>
<p>some of my gay jokes</p>

<p>but i i used to have this</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>about defending</p>

<p>a hundred percent i don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>i saw the preview the</p>
<p>other day on a</p>
<p>movie and it was just</p>
<p>the most hilarious thing ever</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not supposed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a gay</p>
<p>movie i think</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>point where the two</p>
<p>vampires do kiss but i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all supposed to be gay but</p>
<p>i think all the actors they picked are gay</p>
<p>wait a minute the</p>

<p>later i see the same man and a</p>
<p>woman who i have to assume is his wife</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>falling to the manager i see the manager like</p>
<p>nodding like</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s a fucking asshole</p>

<p>god you&rsquo;re a heartbreaker to the guy</p>
<p>the guy the manager told me he&rsquo;s like yeah you know</p>
<p>i offered them free tickets but then as they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to leave i go oh by the way</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t guarantee you the next guy</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t do something like that too</p>
<p>like he had to remind them that</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t have like a</p>
<p>midget calendar and a non midget calendar</p>
<p>like to know like who&rsquo;s coming to town and what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna talk about</p>
<p>i was like you should have just</p>
<p>given them tickets to see brat i would have fucking</p>
<p>solved everything yeah that&rsquo;s true yeah</p>
<p>but brad williams</p>
<p>brad williams who&rsquo;s a little person little person</p>
<p>so i that&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>that was pretty like</p>
<p>but do you think about not doing it after that</p>
<p>i think about not doing it like just because i did</p>
<p>it once in australia and they also included that like</p>
<p>about how mean it was</p>
<p>and the guy was like</p>
<p>kinda hacky so i was like i&rsquo;m just not</p>
<p>doing it the rest of this trip so i just didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>again there</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s to the</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>i do get bored i</p>
<p>close with it for so long that i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>bored of saying it</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m not closing with it anymore</p>
<p>i just do something else so for me</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really feel bad about it</p>

<p>and yeah you&rsquo;re all you&rsquo;re getting all</p>
<p>upset and going right after his weight</p>
<p>do you know what by far by the way</p>
<p>got the most backlash ever for me by far i mean</p>
<p>of all the negative response i&rsquo;ve ever gotten 90</p>
<p>of it is from my bike riding joe</p>
<p>really but i mean oh and i saw that online</p>
<p>i saw that online a lot of people were</p>
<p>angry they wanted</p>
<p>to fucking kick your ass oh my god dude i</p>
<p>gotta eat like tons of</p>
<p>emails and your joke is</p>
<p>about how arrogant people are</p>
<p>with bikes a lot of bike riders they do are arrogant</p>
<p>yeah and i mean</p>
<p>look it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>statement i make and there&rsquo;s a joke that</p>
<p>elaborate with it</p>
<p>one of the things i</p>
<p>imply in the joke is like</p>
<p>essentially</p>
<p>hitting somebody with my car right</p>
<p>right but it&rsquo;s one of like</p>
<p>a lot cause it&rsquo;s a bit it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>three minute bit</p>
<p>right what dude</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m talking like you fucking</p>
<p>piece of shit</p>
<p>like you deserve to die i bet you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even ride a bike you fat fuck like all these like</p>
<p>i mean like</p>
<p>dozens of emails of like you&rsquo;re the fucking</p>
<p>worst person ever</p>
<p>like i was i didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>a how big that</p>
<p>like the eighth that</p>
<p>would strike a</p>
<p>chord at all</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s this whole</p>
<p>cycling movement yeah community hardcore</p>
<p>yeah that also feels threatened by</p>
<p>car like drivers like that&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>issue i didn&rsquo;t realize i was hitting on</p>
<p>a real issue i was just talking</p>
<p>about the way that like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had cyclists i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>cyclists kick my car when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>driving down the</p>
<p>street because they felt like i</p>
<p>veered into the lane or you know i mean like</p>
<p>just like shit</p>
<p>where i felt like</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>shut off an intersection and and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re driving the middle of the</p>
<p>street make you</p>
<p>drive like i just feel like some of them drive ride</p>
<p>their bikes arrogantly</p>
<p>i feel like they</p>
<p>could be more</p>
<p>aware of like</p>
<p>the surroundings and</p>
<p>the way that like people in cars have to be careful too</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more a commentary on that dude</p>
<p>so much fucking hate mail</p>
<p>so much hate it was a new comedy central special</p>
<p>right but it didn&rsquo;t air</p>
<p>in the special it only aired on the online promotion</p>
<p>really so they just aired a clip</p>
<p>were you responsible for the editing of this</p>
<p>special no they were they were yeah</p>
<p>so the clip is online</p>
<p>and the clip got me</p>
<p>i was hundreds so</p>
<p>happy that i was</p>
<p>responsible for the editing of my own special oh yeah</p>
<p>that would suck if you couldn&rsquo;t edit your own shit</p>
<p>how come they didn&rsquo;t work that in for you</p>
<p>they let you when you get off</p>
<p>stage when you do a half hour an hour</p>
<p>half hour when you do a half hour you get off stage</p>
<p>you get to go</p>
<p>you have a meeting with a producer</p>
<p>right away like</p>
<p>right immediately off</p>
<p>stage right like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like what you know</p>
<p>what did you like the most what did you like the least</p>
<p>how many sets did you do just one oh just one yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rough</p>
<p>they give you a fucking i mean</p>
<p>in their you</p>
<p>know defense they give you</p>
<p>a really hot room</p>
<p>a really hot crowd</p>
<p>but they have</p>
<p>to do it one set if it&rsquo;s a half hour and they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>how many did do a show</p>
<p>they do two per audience and they ship out the audience</p>
<p>but they give you a lot like they&rsquo;re like you know</p>
<p>if you fumble your lines like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go back</p>
<p>you can go back</p>
<p>you can do go back to something you thought didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>right you can try saying it again</p>
<p>they try to help you you say it</p>
<p>again well i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but they offer</p>
<p>that too they</p>
<p>offer that they offer they&rsquo;re like if you go</p>
<p>you know i was whatever walking into the</p>
<p>store and you just like slip up you guys</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>store and you sound</p>
<p>stupid right</p>
<p>you can be like i want to take that from the top again</p>
<p>and you say that to the audience yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird it is</p>
<p>weird but the audience is so coached</p>
<p>and so on board with the concept</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not</p>

<p>conflict gets really the confrontation is really</p>
<p>escalated like</p>
<p>has anybody been attacked</p>

<p>everything like</p>
<p>people lose</p>
<p>their minds when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to lose their car</p>
<p>and also when they go to get</p>
<p>their cars that were towed</p>
<p>like fucking just</p>
<p>freak out man like</p>
<p>cause then when you go pick up your car</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s been towed</p>
<p>you have to you have to get square on all your</p>
<p>other stuff that</p>
<p>maybe had nothing to do with getting towed</p>
<p>so you had parking tickets oh</p>
<p>you gotta show registration and current insurance oh</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s all following</p>
<p>these coal miners into</p>
<p>these fucking mines oh that shit&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>dude the mines this is how they work it it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>building you know how you see</p>
<p>buildings and there&rsquo;s beams inside the</p>
<p>building to support the</p>
<p>structure of the building</p>
<p>and then inside</p>
<p>those beams is rooms</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they do in mountains</p>
<p>they cut in</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll cut out a room</p>
<p>and then they take a left turn they</p>
<p>leave like pillars</p>
<p>yeah and then they cut out this room</p>
<p>and they leave a pillar</p>
<p>and they do</p>
<p>that through the entire fucking mountain but</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about some incredible amount of weight that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>distributed</p>
<p>who knows how much of it is even and how much of it is</p>
<p>you know air pockets or</p>
<p>water or coal</p>
<p>as opposed to</p>
<p>heavy stone and</p>
<p>dude they fucking</p>
<p>collapse on people all that some guys missing just the</p>
<p>other day there was some</p>
<p>minor and i believe it was idaho</p>

<p>they were down there a long time yeah</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>but the mind thing the</p>
<p>creepiest part</p>
<p>about is that they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under like they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>these rooms that are like</p>
<p>three feet tall</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re hunched</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all darkness and shit then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this machine that&rsquo;s just chipping away</p>
<p>and pulling out the coal</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nowhere for the dust to go</p>
<p>i mean it goes</p>
<p>right in your fucking lungs man</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re</p>
