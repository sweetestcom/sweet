    <p>Hi friends, so I&rsquo;m in Europe right now and shit looks real different because I did not plan on having to make this fucking episode</p>
<p>So me and my friend Randy planned a trip to Europe and we were gonna come here for like three weeks</p>
<p>And I recorded a bunch of podcast episodes to have ready so I could just edit them and then post them while I&rsquo;m away</p>
<p>So that you guys don&rsquo;t know like anything going on that you get your typical episodes like you&rsquo;re used to right?</p>
<p>No shit can&rsquo;t go easy for me</p>
<p>We had a little bump in the road our first stop on the Europe trip was Berlin and when we were in Berlin</p>
<p>We got jumped at a club</p>
<p>By some fucking losers who didn&rsquo;t know how to jump people which was funny</p>
<p>But now I have to make a podcast episode updating you about all that. So everything&rsquo;s fucking different. Everything looks weird</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how the sound quality is gonna be. I don&rsquo;t have any of my equipment</p>
<p>I have Randy&rsquo;s camera and a little fucking hope</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see how this episode goes</p>
<p>But basically I have some shit to talk and when I say I have some shit to talk</p>
<p>I have a lot of things I got to get off my fucking chest about Europe and Berlin itself</p>
<p>I quit smoking I quit vaping but I need a motherfucking cigarette</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m right and I sound sick because I am okay. I&rsquo;m sitting here drinking fucking tomato juice praying to God</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna fucking feel better. But like me and him been like sick as shit the past few days</p>
<p>But anyway, I&rsquo;m gonna rant about Berlin I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a couple things I like about Europe and then I&rsquo;m gonna tell you about</p>
<p>What happened in Berlin with the whole fight thing?</p>
<p>but all of it leads into each other like I have to tell you the shit in the beginning so that the rest of it</p>
<p>Makes sense. So let me just jump into the shit me and Randy land in Berlin and I posted a tick-tock video of us</p>
<p>I was like, yo, we just landed in Berlin. What the fuck is there to do send us recommendations?</p>
<p>Tell us where to go things to do, you know, I wanted food recommendations basically</p>
<p>But like raves too cuz like the rave I&rsquo;m out of breath. Oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking sick of shit the rave culture in Berlin like the rave scene is super big here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s known for that like every fucking thing you see online about Berlin is like</p>
<p>Raves like fucking sunglasses fucking all black and just gothic crazy scary grungy. Love it</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the scene in Berlin. So I was looking for recommendations cuz like we&rsquo;re fucking not from there. We don&rsquo;t know shit</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know German. We don&rsquo;t know nothing</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re over here on Apple Maps like a fucking idiot</p>
<p>but anyway</p>
<p>I post that video and it goes viral and everybody&rsquo;s like leaving all these fucking</p>
<p>Suggestions of where to go in the comments of the video and I&rsquo;m like, oh my god fun</p>
<p>We have so many places to go</p>
<p>The one recommendation that we took for a restaurant was fucking shit and the one recommendation for a club</p>
<p>We took which was the matrix these motherfucking idiots tried to jump us</p>
<p>Moral of a story don&rsquo;t fucking take no recommendations offline</p>
<p>Fuck all of you who tried to set us up if it was a setup. That&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t know if it was a setup or not</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck was going on, but we got there</p>
<p>We posted a video of like give us recommendations and then the video blew up</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know if it was someone that recognized me online</p>
<p>If it was someone that was setting something up or what but we&rsquo;re gonna get there</p>
<p>So online like especially on tik-tok, you see everybody wearing the coolest shit in Berlin like the people in Berlin online</p>
<p>They look on fuck with the ball like they look like the top tier like cool people</p>
<p>Like, you know people in New York dress and they think that they eat bitch Berlin eats them like oh</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard cuz people in New York look so fucking cool, but people online</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying online for a reason cuz people in real life in Berlin aren&rsquo;t shit. They&rsquo;re literally average as fuck</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re Joe fucking schmo when we got there. I was like, where&rsquo;s all the cool people?</p>
<p>Literally, I was like what the fuck people online</p>
<p>Make Berlin seem like they just walk around and rave clothes all day</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what it fucking is. I guess the image that&rsquo;s painted and let me just tell you</p>
<p>That ain&rsquo;t how it fucking is</p>
<p>people look average as fuck during the day people don&rsquo;t even look that cute when they go to raves like we went to</p>
<p>like a couple of places like we went out a couple places and we never saw anyone like</p>
<p>That fucking cool and it&rsquo;s weird because I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m in all these places</p>
<p>I see online where all these cool people are posting but where the fuck are they at like y&rsquo;all are not there</p>
<p>So what is this little like for social media shit y&rsquo;all are doing?</p>
<p>You know what? I mean? And there&rsquo;s this one club called Berghain</p>
<p>Berghain, I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck I don&rsquo;t know how to pronounce it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not German bitch</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s apparently like really hard to get into and like they turned down Elon Musk at the door like they don&rsquo;t care who you are</p>
<p>What you have they don&rsquo;t care if you have millions of dollars</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t look the vibe</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t let you in like if you don&rsquo;t look cool, they don&rsquo;t give a fuck then I&rsquo;ll let you in and I love that</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s so fucking cool. We didn&rsquo;t try to get in there, but I wanted to try</p>
<p>But we did try to get into a club called KitKat club and</p>
<p>That club is a fetish club come to find out like I didn&rsquo;t know it was a fetish club</p>
<p>But it was but my main gripe with these clubs in Berlin the clubs the bars</p>
<p>Everything if you&rsquo;re going to be picky about who you allow to come into your bar</p>
<p>You better be cute as fuck. Okay Germans are very racist and that&rsquo;s one thing I experienced firsthand</p>
<p>And if you want to tell me no, we&rsquo;re not no, we&rsquo;re not shut the fuck up. That&rsquo;s my experience</p>
<p>All right, fuck you. Shut your goddamn mouth</p>
<p>My biggest gripe is these motherfuckers at the front door of these raves y&rsquo;all want to judge off appearance?</p>
<p>Okay, so have a good appearance if you&rsquo;re gonna do that</p>
<p>Like have a bitch looking like Bella Hadid at the door have her tell me fucking no, that&rsquo;s some fucking 50 year old loser</p>
<p>This fucking idiot that&rsquo;s like looks like shit</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re gonna base your opinion of someone based solely off of how they look</p>
<p>Have your motherfucking porch clean before you tell me mine is dirty</p>
<p>If you are gonna tell me I don&rsquo;t fit the vibe of your club</p>
<p>Then be the vibe of the club bitch cuz you look fucking Trader Joe&rsquo;s worker</p>
<p>You look fucking stupid and you&rsquo;re gonna tell me I can&rsquo;t come in</p>
<p>Okay, like I totally get people wanted to be protective of like the vibe of their club fully get it</p>
<p>I get if you want to be racist be racist. Don&rsquo;t let people who aren&rsquo;t German in your club</p>
<p>I get it if you&rsquo;re gonna be racist</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine because I know how protective it is of like</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on drugs in a club and you&rsquo;re raving and people fuck up the vibe when you&rsquo;re on drugs</p>
<p>If someone is like being obnoxious or fucking up the vibe, it fucks up everything and it makes it terrible</p>
<p>So I get it be racist be picky, but be cute if you&rsquo;re gonna do that bitch. Oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so fucking mad about it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so fucking mad about it because if you have like this ugly motherfucker at the door telling me no, I&rsquo;m gonna look at him</p>
<p>Like</p>
<p>Right. Okay</p>
<p>Like you look stupid and I&rsquo;m gonna be like fuck your club</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a goddamn idiot anyway</p>
<p>But if you have a bitch like Bella Hadid at the door and she looks at me and goes no, sweetie. Ah, I</p>
<p>Will gladly go fuck myself. I will gladly go fucking be on my merry way. I&rsquo;m not gonna fucking bicker</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna fight. Yes, ma&rsquo;am, and I&rsquo;m gonna fucking go. Okay, you get what I mean?</p>
<p>You get the fucking dynamic how it switches cuz I&rsquo;m bigger and cuter than every motherfucker that I saw</p>
<p>Getting let in the clubs and the people that worked at the clubs</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s just that I wasn&rsquo;t German I get it</p>
<p>But you cannot look at me and tell me it was because of the way that I looked I&rsquo;m self-aware enough to know</p>
<p>If physically I don&rsquo;t look like the vibe of a place I get it</p>
<p>I would get it to not let me in if I didn&rsquo;t dress appropriately bitch. I looked more Berlin than y&rsquo;all fucking did</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying. I&rsquo;m very confused. My outfit was like better than most people that were coming in</p>
<p>So what the fuck was the problem? I didn&rsquo;t get like so I don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re fucking shit</p>
<p>It just pisses me off and one other thing I want to say about Berlin</p>
<p>We get the appearance thing</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>But people&rsquo;s fucking attitudes are too bad for the way that they look if you&rsquo;re gonna be butt-ass</p>
<p>Fucking ugly do not have an attitude. All you have going for you is being nice</p>
<p>So what the fuck is that? Like I don&rsquo;t get ugly people that are mean</p>
<p>I truly genuinely wholeheartedly do not understand it. Like that&rsquo;s all you have going for you is like to be nice</p>
<p>So like to be rude, I&rsquo;ve never seen such misplaced confidence in so many fucking ugly ass people</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like I&rsquo;m not the type to like base people and like judge people off like superficial shit</p>
<p>But if you do it to me, I&rsquo;m gonna do it right back if you&rsquo;re racist to me. I&rsquo;m racist right back</p>
<p>You want to be racist? Let&rsquo;s be racist. You want to play appearance? Let&rsquo;s play appearance</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s degrade each other. But when I come back and I win don&rsquo;t look at me and tell me I&rsquo;m the mean one</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some shit. I don&rsquo;t fuck with like with hate comments on social media</p>
<p>You want to come on my page and attack me unprovoked and when I attack you back just better. I&rsquo;m the asshole</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>Bitch you&rsquo;re fucking stupid. It&rsquo;s not me. It&rsquo;s not gonna fly with it&rsquo;s not gonna fly with someone like me</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna fucking fly. You&rsquo;re not gonna try and tell me I&rsquo;m an asshole</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even consider it being mean if you come to me and be mean and I&rsquo;m mean back mine doesn&rsquo;t count</p>
<p>Two negatives equal a positive you see if you&rsquo;re mean to me first and I match it. I&rsquo;m not being mean</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s my logic. That&rsquo;s my reasoning. Fuck you</p>
<p>Let me get some tomato juice so I can calm down</p>
<p>But real life y&rsquo;all like Berlin disappointed the fuck out of me like these the way that it looks online</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as cool as it looks in real life and the main thing like Berlin&rsquo;s architecture and</p>
<p>The city and like everything&rsquo;s set up like I love it. It looks so cool. It looks like</p>
<p>Futuristic from like the 90s like what the 90s thought was futuristic, but it&rsquo;s like rustic</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you took a modern looking city in the 80s or 90s and dropped a bomb on it</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s what Berlin looks like. It looks like you blew it up</p>
<p>But then that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense why everything is so goddamn expensive like I shit you not</p>
<p>Berlin was more expensive than the United States</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s $20 a drink to go into any bar any club like 20 bucks for one drink, babe</p>
<p>Are you have you lost your fucking mind?</p>
<p>How is your city gonna look blowing the fuck up and you&rsquo;re gonna try and charge 20 bucks for one drink?</p>
<p>Please but also I get like people racially profile you so like if you look American if you look like a tourist</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna charge you more just cuz they can you know, I mean like I get that I&rsquo;m aware of that dynamic</p>
<p>but no girl that wasn&rsquo;t what was happening that was like everywhere and that was like the set price on the menu and I was</p>
<p>Looking around to see if like Germans got different menus than like people that looked American</p>
<p>No, everybody say fucking me. I genuinely don&rsquo;t get why Berlin was so expensive</p>
<p>But it was obnoxious like for me to say something was expensive girl</p>
<p>It was fucking stupid like it genuinely just baffled me</p>
<p>I was like, how does this make sense? Like your your place looks like this and you go charge like this</p>
<p>What like I&rsquo;m in Romania right now</p>
<p>Romania&rsquo;s prettier than Berlin and the prices dirt cheap bitch</p>
<p>I love it here cuz I could eat like a fat fuck and like I spend no money</p>
<p>But I will say that the coffee in Berlin was 10 out of 10</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll give credit where credit is due coffee 10 out of 10 people</p>
<p>Shit, I don&rsquo;t like fucking people</p>
<p>But the coffee and like the little pastries at the little shops and shit and then the pizza. Oh</p>
<p>My god, yo, that shit is good</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 10 out of 10 like best I&rsquo;ve had and I&rsquo;ve been a lot of places seen a lot of things</p>
<p>Berlin got good-ass food and good-ass coffee</p>
<p>Not food in general because that little schnitzel shit or whatever. They like it was that right?</p>
<p>Like it wasn&rsquo;t nothing to fucking rave about, you know</p>
<p>But like the coffee 10 out of 10 the little pastries 10 out of 10 that one pizza place</p>
<p>We went to fuck 10 out of 10, but let me talk about the gym for a second</p>
<p>The gyms in Berlin are cool. They vibe they&rsquo;re cool as fuck. They look super super nice</p>
<p>They look futuristic. They look cool. They have like red lights in them. So it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just cool</p>
<p>It looks Berlin and then the music bro. Oh my god. The music is so good in Berlin gyms. I was like</p>
<p>The whole time working out and I&rsquo;ve got my fucking Shazam like this every five minutes. It&rsquo;s like what&rsquo;s the song?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the song?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like techno and there&rsquo;s like some EDM hardstyle shit and it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s just what they&rsquo;d be listening to here</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I listen to like in my headphones</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I mean, cuz I&rsquo;d be going to Alphaland in Texas and it&rsquo;s just like trap shit and like some stupid-ass music here and there</p>
<p>But like they just be listening to EDM and techno like that&rsquo;s just the norm. Like that&rsquo;s just what their radio is</p>
<p>So I did love that but with the gyms, I forget people in Europe don&rsquo;t wear fucking deodorant</p>
<p>So the gym smell like shit and when I say shit</p>
<p>I mean onions like it literally smells like someone&rsquo;s fucking cooking a stew of just</p>
<p>onions like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Europeans got the weirdest fucking body odor. It don&rsquo;t smell like BO</p>
<p>It smells like fucking onions and like being in the gym</p>
<p>I would feel like I stunk just from being in the vicinity of like around these people, but I just don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>How the fuck is it 28 degrees outside and y&rsquo;all still fucking stink you can&rsquo;t sweat so</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s 28 degrees babe, how do you still smell like onions? I genuinely don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>I can you just like please put a little bit deodorant like it should be a thing like if you&rsquo;re gonna work out</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s required legally. You have to put on some kind of like smell good cuz y&rsquo;all smell like shit</p>
<p>Like it literally smells so fucking bad. I don&rsquo;t get it. And I wish I was being dramatic</p>
<p>I really do like I wish I was being dramatic like I&rsquo;m gonna be straight up and real which guys like don&rsquo;t waste money or</p>
<p>Time going to Berlin. It&rsquo;s not what you think it is. It&rsquo;s like it was fun to get the experience</p>
<p>We had like a good time, but</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what you think it is online. I was very much disappointed</p>
<p>My expectations were fucking like they fell short like nothing about it was what I thought it would be</p>
<p>But it was still cool to experience don&rsquo;t get me wrong that coffee I&rsquo;m sitting I&rsquo;d stand but at the supermarkets</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only found them in Berlin so far. There&rsquo;s these protein pudding things and they have like 40 grams of protein. Oh</p>
<p>My god, they literally taste like a straight-up dessert</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t taste like protein at all. Like they don&rsquo;t taste like anything healthy me and Randy were fucking killing those</p>
<p>Like we got like three four a day</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just like pounding those cuz we had to hit our protein, but we&rsquo;re tired of going out to these restaurants</p>
<p>So we would just go out to a restaurant once a day and then eat fucking protein pudding all day</p>
<p>So we could get our protein in but bro those little cups. I&rsquo;m gonna put a picture in here, but goddamn</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so good. If you can find them try them the salted caramel one. That was the best one</p>
<p>Oh, I miss it. I miss it so bad cuz in Romania, that&rsquo;s where we are right now</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any like I don&rsquo;t know where to get that shit. Like I&rsquo;ve looked everywhere. I can&rsquo;t fucking find them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just gonna have to live in Berlin where I&rsquo;m never gonna go back</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you about my tattoos and then we&rsquo;re gonna get into the fight. Okay, so in Romania</p>
<p>Randy has a tattoo artist that he sees here</p>
<p>She did like his half sleeve like a year ago</p>
<p>And he was telling me like hyping her up like telling me how good she is and all this and that and I was like</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, whatever and he was like, yo, we have to like go get tattoos while we&rsquo;re in Romania and I was like, okay</p>
<p>Perfect. So really we booked Romania just to go get tattoos by her</p>
<p>Her name&rsquo;s Aria and I tagged her my Instagram</p>
<p>I posted like a video of like going to get the tattoos</p>
<p>But I got a Medusa right here and then I got</p>
<p>Words on my knuckles and I got like some little tribal shit on my pinky just cuz I&rsquo;ve always liked that</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll do a full podcast episode about what all my tattoos mean because I have a couple few</p>
<p>But they came out so fucking good. I&rsquo;m so happy about them. Like literally blew my expectations away</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what font I wanted</p>
<p>I just knew the style that I wanted but we created this one like we found two fonts</p>
<p>We liked and then like merge them and then I made her like sketch them to like be what I wanted</p>
<p>But like literally I fucking love them. I&rsquo;ve always wanted my knuckles done. This is the most perfect fucking shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited about my tattoos, but they are like</p>
<p>Healing so I&rsquo;m glad</p>
<p>We got in the fight before the tattoos cuz had I fucked these up. I would have been more mad</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to rumble again. As soon as these heal bitch as soon as these heal</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to go cuz I&rsquo;m pissed like I&rsquo;m fucking sick about what happened in Berlin. So let me jump into that</p>
<p>We got fucking jumped out of nowhere. Leo. Don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself. You gotta fucking set the scene first</p>
<p>So we go to this club called the matrix and it&rsquo;s the one that everybody was recommending on tik-tok</p>
<p>So me Randy and Randy&rsquo;s friend Nathaniel</p>
<p>He met us out here cuz he&rsquo;s stationed in the military and he lives in Germany</p>
<p>But he just flew to Berlin to see us like hang out for like the five days. We were there whatever so we&rsquo;re all at</p>
<p>the club</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know where Nathan went</p>
<p>He fucking just disappeared. I don&rsquo;t know where like it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know like and he didn&rsquo;t show up until the next morning</p>
<p>It like 11 a.m. Like we had no fucking clue where he went, but me and Randy</p>
<p>Are at the dance floor like just dancing minding our fucking business, you know as I fucking do</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re on like the corner of the dance floor and that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll always catch me</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go to the middle of a dance floor. I don&rsquo;t like that shit. I like a quick exit</p>
<p>I like to be able to watch everything going on. I like to like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very aware of my surroundings. I&rsquo;m hyper aware of my surroundings and</p>
<p>All of a sudden me and him are just dancing having a good fucking time and he&rsquo;s straight</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not like dancing on each other. Like it wasn&rsquo;t like a hate crime. I don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t fucking know what it was</p>
<p>But like we weren&rsquo;t dancing on each other near each other</p>
<p>It was like we were just like dancing like I&rsquo;m over here like fucking fist bumping like Jersey Shore in this bitch</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just dancing but we&rsquo;re like near each other and all of a sudden five fucking dudes</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was five or six, but five fucking dudes like start surrounding us and I was like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>so I immediately get on guard and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>I like I turn around and I see a fucking dude to my back one over here and there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s three in front of us</p>
<p>And I was like, uh-uh</p>
<p>So I immediately get like my hair fucking stands up and I&rsquo;m like, alright like I get ready cuz like y&rsquo;all know my past</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve I want to say I used to fight a lot but I</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t get away from it</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re literally fucking saying they&rsquo;re minding our business these dudes surround us and then this one right here</p>
<p>Like comes up to me and like pushes me. No words are exchanged</p>
<p>Nobody says shit. These people just fucking surround us and this fucking dude pushes me</p>
<p>And I was like, what the fuck and as soon as I get like ready to like recalibrate I&rsquo;m like, alright, bitch</p>
<p>Someone over here throws their fucking drink in my face</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a typical tactic when you&rsquo;re gonna jump someone is take their eyesight out</p>
<p>So a couple things people will do that though a drink in your face</p>
<p>Someone will hit you like on the on your back. So you turn around and they&rsquo;ll fucking sucker punch you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll try and take your vision out with a drink. They&rsquo;ll pull your shirt over your head and then start beating you</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of tactics people will use I already saw the situation for what it was. We were surrounded</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>I knew there was no way out. So I</p>
<p>Start swinging and I start swinging for the fucking life of me and I&rsquo;m not the type person</p>
<p>To be with the hit me first hit me first. I will gladly hit you fucking first</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not letting you get a hit on me</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>If I can swing first</p>
<p>I will if I see a situation is gonna go to that if I don&rsquo;t see a way out</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m swinging first and I&rsquo;m swinging ten times for you hit me once like I don&rsquo;t play that shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very paranoid as soon as I get scared. I attack that&rsquo;s y&rsquo;all know that about me</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m the sweetest person you&rsquo;ll ever meet but if you scare me</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that protector aspect of me fucking takes over and I&rsquo;m like unleashing and there&rsquo;s no fucking stopping it</p>
<p>But this fight turned into hell. So whoever this was that threw that fucking drink at me</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first motherfucker. I swung at and when I tell you I swung through their fucking face</p>
<p>Like there was follow-through in that bitch. Like it was golf. Whoever&rsquo;s face that was don&rsquo;t look good no more</p>
<p>So I catch this bitch and immediately I come back to the one that pushed me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, ah, you motherfucking you started it</p>
<p>so I come back here and I&rsquo;m just swinging for the fucking life of me rights left anything I can fucking do and</p>
<p>Then me and this dude go to the ground and when we get to the ground</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever get fully on the ground. So I&rsquo;m kneeled down on one knee just fucking</p>
<p>Cranking this bitch like any way that I can I can&rsquo;t like fully show you like how I&rsquo;m like gripping my hands cuz my knuckles</p>
<p>Are still like scabbing but I&rsquo;m just like on one knee just fucking going to town in this dude</p>
<p>I was hitting him so fucking hard. I dislocated my pinky. I cracked my fucking pinky ring</p>
<p>But while I&rsquo;m over here like fucking just pounding this dude</p>
<p>One of the friends or like one of the other people in the group kicked me in my face</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why my face was so fucked up like they kicked me this way it hit my fucking nose</p>
<p>My nose is still bruised it hit my lip and then there was like boot marks up on my like mustache area</p>
<p>I was like damn and they caught my chin</p>
<p>So they kicked the fuck out of me and like hit me in my face, bitch</p>
<p>It takes more to stop me than a kick in the face. Like once you get me mad like that. You gotta shoot me</p>
<p>You gotta choke me the fuck out or shoot me and I&rsquo;m just I just keep going going going</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like he kicked me in the face. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>I keep going and since I don&rsquo;t stop the motherfucker stomps me on top of my head</p>
<p>Like I have a scab here</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been like a week since all this fucking happened now</p>
<p>But like I had a giant like scratch over my head and I had a big scab</p>
<p>He stomped me on my head and that&rsquo;s what stopped me because like I felt my neck like do that and I was like</p>
<p>Oh fuck</p>
<p>Like I stopped for a second and I immediately just like</p>
<p>Swifted his legs like grabbed his legs and fucking just slammed him on the ground and that&rsquo;s when I stayed on one knee and</p>
<p>Like had to like catch my balance for a second cuz like if you don&rsquo;t know when you get hit in the head</p>
<p>Your equilibrium is off like your brain fucking rattles around inside your head and you get dizzy</p>
<p>You ever see me drop into fights cuz I got hit but I&rsquo;m coming back up bitch</p>
<p>Once I recalibrate on the bottom, I&rsquo;m coming back up. But like I get like my center gravity back. I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to like take in the situation for what it happens. I&rsquo;m like looking around and I look over and I see Randy</p>
<p>Randy and these two fucking dudes. He&rsquo;s just laying into them</p>
<p>Like he was like fucking these two dudes up, but I looked and saw on his head</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s bleeding out of his ear when they were like starting with me</p>
<p>Somebody cracked him in the side of his head when he wasn&rsquo;t looking and he started bleeding out of his ear</p>
<p>But I looked up and I saw Randy bleeding and I fucking lost it like you can beat me up</p>
<p>You can hit me you can fuck with me</p>
<p>When you hurt someone I care about or you hurt someone I&rsquo;m with that&rsquo;s a whole different story</p>
<p>And that is when I lost my fucking mind. That is what I hypothetically</p>
<p>for legal reasons</p>
<p>May or may not have pulled</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking too much about that because I don&rsquo;t want no legal shit</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck&rsquo;s gonna happen. If anybody sees this and you were trying to prosecute some shit. It was fake</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lying. It&rsquo;s for the story time. I&rsquo;m giving Tana mojo. I&rsquo;m lying about my story and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people saw me from tick-tock and thought oh, he flew out the country. He don&rsquo;t have nothing on him</p>
<p>I always got something on me bitch, but that&rsquo;s when I come up off my leg cuz now I&rsquo;m like, uh-uh</p>
<p>No, you heard that motherfucker. I&rsquo;m with no while I&rsquo;m standing up</p>
<p>someone comes behind me and grabs me by my throat and like pulls me like</p>
<p>Someone was hanging off of my back like a fucking monkey by my throat. They thought they were gonna pull me down, bitch</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fucking five eight. You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re like a fucking necklace. You&rsquo;re not gonna do shit</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s someone hanging off the back of my nap got me in a fucking chokehold and I grab him and I&rsquo;m about to</p>
<p>Sling him to the fucking ground and get him off me cuz bitch. You&rsquo;re like a little fucking child, please</p>
<p>That was security and I didn&rsquo;t know but I lifted his ass up off the ground</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;m getting ready to like whip his ass like four more security grabbed me like everything had like</p>
<p>Spread out like the whole dance floor was like vacant</p>
<p>Everybody like made a giant circle around us was just watching like what the fuck security grabs me. This was my only free arm</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just swinging over like anyone I can hit I&rsquo;m just fucking swinging</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking trying to uppercut like I&rsquo;m just swinging any direction I can with my one free arm. They finally grab my PR</p>
<p>But the security grabs us and starts dragging us outside. I have like six fucking security guards</p>
<p>I mean when we get out of the club, like we&rsquo;re walking toward the exit</p>
<p>I grabbed the wall like for the exit of like the club</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pulling my body and I&rsquo;m holding on to the doorframe because I want to catch the motherfuckers that are coming out</p>
<p>Cuz they&rsquo;re escorting us all out. I</p>
<p>Thought the only people they grabbed was me and Randy</p>
<p>they only had us and</p>
<p>When I saw the guys</p>
<p>Coming out like they were behind us like there was like five fucking dudes like coming</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m gonna fucking get him and security like wouldn&rsquo;t let me go and I was like, let me the fuck go</p>
<p>I was like, they just jumped me. I&rsquo;m Albanian. I don&rsquo;t play that shit. Like I&rsquo;m fucking screaming</p>
<p>My nose is bleeding to my lip was busted. So I&rsquo;m like bleeding. I&rsquo;m like spitting everywhere</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like screaming and as soon as I said, I&rsquo;m Albanian. I don&rsquo;t play this shit like you they just jumped me</p>
<p>Let me get them like once they once I started saying that</p>
<p>They were like, oh fuck and that&rsquo;s when they all grabbed me and we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>Holding me the fuck back and they told the guys go run like they told all the fucking guys that jumped us to run</p>
<p>Held me and Randy and let them run away</p>
<p>That is the part</p>
<p>That don&rsquo;t fucking sit right with me like I&rsquo;m about to start sweating that shit pisses me off so bad</p>
<p>They let them jump us and then let them run</p>
<p>Security was being so fucking disrespectful and rude to me</p>
<p>They were screaming at me like you&rsquo;re going to fucking jail all this and that I said call the fucking cops</p>
<p>I said they jumped us and I said you just let them get away</p>
<p>I said call the fucking cops. I knew I was going to jail already girl</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fighting five fucking dudes in the club, but I made it very clear. I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck. I was getting arrested</p>
<p>I knew I was getting arrested. I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck. My brain works in a very specific way</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like if I&rsquo;m getting arrested, I&rsquo;m making it worth it</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when I get fucking pissed off and I start going at security cuz I&rsquo;m like you dumb motherfuckers</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m Albanian. You know what you&rsquo;ve just fucking done</p>
<p>You just let these motherfuckers jump me and you told them to get away</p>
<p>You held me and let them get away and they were like, whoa, wait, they attacked you and I said, yes</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking know who they were. They attacked me. They attacked me and my friend and they were like, oh shit</p>
<p>Like they were like, oh</p>
<p>But immediately their fucking attitude switches they start bringing me water they start bringing me fucking napkins</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like hugging me. They&rsquo;re trying to make sure I&rsquo;m warm cuz I&rsquo;m in a tank top. It&rsquo;s 28 degrees outside in Berlin</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a tank top</p>
<p>Okay, a skinny little fucking tiny like material like my gym tank tops that are like no fucking material</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a fucking tank top and a gold chain and I&rsquo;m standing outside</p>
<p>Shivering to fucking death, you know because we had to check our jackets like I had a leather jacket</p>
<p>But I checked it inside in the club. So Randy was like going to get our jackets. They let him go get our jackets</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to get them while they got me outside now</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to take care of me and with the guy that kicked me in the face</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny is I really don&rsquo;t blame him because if someone was on top of Randy</p>
<p>Beating the fucking shit out of him the way I was beating his friend how to kick the fuck out of him, too</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not mad at it. I get it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very fair. That&rsquo;s my thing. I&rsquo;m very fair</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re fucking babying me now after they realized what actually just happened in this situation</p>
<p>They they bring me a heater like an outside heater because I&rsquo;m standing there fucking waiting on Randy to get our jackets</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t find them all of a sudden</p>
<p>My Versace glasses that I had on are lost and I realized it I was like wait where the fuck is my glasses</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not being sweet. I&rsquo;m not being nice</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m screaming and everybody&rsquo;s fucking face all the security any security that comes up to me. I&rsquo;m spitting on him</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally like my nose is bleeding and I&rsquo;m like like blowing snot but bloody fucking snot all over these fucking people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spitting on him. I&rsquo;m fucking pissed like what they just did. Uh-huh. You let them go</p>
<p>No, and it looked like they were like associated with them</p>
<p>Like they looked like they knew the club owners and like the security so they like let them go</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m being a motherfucker. I&rsquo;m being so mean to these fucking people. I&rsquo;m saying anything mean and disrespectful</p>
<p>I can say I&rsquo;m spitting on him. I&rsquo;m fucking blowing my blood all over them</p>
<p>Like fuck you, and then I realized my sunglasses are gone</p>
<p>My Versace sunglasses that I paid so much fucking money for I said go the fuck inside and find them now</p>
<p>I said bring them to me now and</p>
<p>They found them. I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>In a giant club. They found these little tiny black Versace sunglasses</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how they did it, but they did and then one of them brings me one of my gold bracelets</p>
<p>Cuz one of them fell off. I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even realize but what pisses me off the most about this whole experience is like</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even jump us right like at least jack my chain at least like do something bitch</p>
<p>Like you didn&rsquo;t even fucking jump us, right? Like I still had all my jewelry</p>
<p>I still had all my shit like y&rsquo;all didn&rsquo;t take my wallet</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all didn&rsquo;t take my chain y&rsquo;all didn&rsquo;t take nothing like what the fuck kind of wack-ass losers jump like that</p>
<p>Like if you jump somebody you jump them to like get shit like you make it worth my time</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just jump me make me get in a fight kick me in the face</p>
<p>Just to waste my time like that like if you&rsquo;re gonna jump me do it properly bitch</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste my fucking time with that just take my chain pussy</p>
<p>But anyway, I&rsquo;m sitting there just like shivering like really really bad. It&rsquo;s 28 fucking degrees. It&rsquo;s snowing outside</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just standing there like just shivering cuz like my adrenaline is wearing off at this point. I&rsquo;m fucking mad</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still screaming but like my body&rsquo;s like shutting down because it&rsquo;s so fucking cold the one fucking black guy</p>
<p>That worked at that goddamn club. He was the sweetest one. He was the nicest one. Fuck all the Germans</p>
<p>Like I said now I&rsquo;m racist. You&rsquo;re all racist to me. I&rsquo;m racist to you. Fuck you. You&rsquo;re nice to me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nice to you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go fuck what you look like what skin color you have but the black guy was a sweetest fucking one nicest one</p>
<p>But he saw me like freezing to death and he was like, okay come here like and brought me inside</p>
<p>Stood with me inside was like rubbing my back was like being sweet to me. It was like trying to talk to me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still just cussing him the fuck out cuz I&rsquo;m like, fuck you. You&rsquo;re associated with them. Fuck you</p>
<p>He was being nice though. I was being an ass, but Randy finally finds our jackets comes back and the guys like</p>
<p>Why are you screaming at me? Why are you fucking screaming at me? And I broke it down for him</p>
<p>I got in front of his face and I said look</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re at my club. I let these five guys jump you attack you</p>
<p>I hold you back and I let them run and get away</p>
<p>How are you gonna fucking feel and then it clicks and he goes, okay, I would be pissed too</p>
<p>And then he tries to like calm me down lava situation. He&rsquo;s like, okay. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m so sorry that happened</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t on purpose like it happened this don&rsquo;t be mad. Don&rsquo;t be mad. Just calm down go home the nights over</p>
<p>They called the cops get out of here while you can bitch. He was so fucking sweet for that</p>
<p>So we I immediately call a fucking uber as we&rsquo;re getting in the uber</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we get in the uber and we&rsquo;re driving this way. The cops are pulling in this way</p>
<p>So he kind of like saved my ass on that one, but I didn&rsquo;t get arrested which is fucking great</p>
<p>But like I said</p>
<p>If anybody is like from Berlin or like from Germany and you think you&rsquo;re gonna watch this shit and try and claim me fuck you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never coming back to your fucking little city again eat my shit</p>
<p>but the part that scared me the most was I was standing there outside the club and</p>
<p>When they were going inside to get my glasses, I was realizing my face is swollen. Like I felt my lip was huge</p>
<p>I was like bleeding out of my face like my nose and my mouth like I just kept spitting blood</p>
<p>I was like what the fuck and my lip was busted and I remembered Leo check your teeth and I</p>
<p>Like licked in my mouth. I was like</p>
<p>Trying to feel if I had my teeth and it was so swollen and numb</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t feel it and I got so fucking scared. I was like, please don&rsquo;t let me be missing teeth</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my biggest fucking fear is to like lose my teeth</p>
<p>So I pull my phone out and I put the selfie camera on</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put the picture in here because of how fucking mad I looked I look like a demon</p>
<p>Like I was checking my teeth. I was like to make sure I had them and as soon as I realized I had my teeth</p>
<p>I like calm down a little I was still fucking mad. I was still spitting everywhere, but I felt so much better</p>
<p>Knowing that all I had was a busted lip a fucked up nose and a chin like that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through a lot of fights. I&rsquo;ve had my shit fucked up plenty of times it heals</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like basically back to normal in like a week. I know how that works</p>
<p>I was like as long as it&rsquo;s a flesh wound, I&rsquo;m fine. But if you want to knock to my teeth out. Oh</p>
<p>My god, I mean I&rsquo;m close to Turkey. So I&rsquo;ll just flew to Turkey and got them done but bitch</p>
<p>Oh, I would have been fucking mad</p>
<p>So after that we spent the next day like exploring and then we bounced then went to our next country, which is Romania</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re here, but Romania has been so fucking cute. Like I love Romania</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been such a blast the tattoo artists that we have like we spent like four days with her</p>
<p>I fucking love her like Randy&rsquo;s getting a whole fucking sleeve done</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve really had so much fun hanging out with her and like just eating Romanian food and like doing all the shit like every</p>
<p>Day, she like orders us food to the studio. Oh my god. I fucking love her</p>
<p>But yeah, we&rsquo;re still trying to figure out where we&rsquo;re gonna go next or if we&rsquo;re gonna go anywhere</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just gonna go home or we&rsquo;re gonna go to Rome. I don&rsquo;t fucking know</p>
<p>This trip has been a shitshow a little</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll see like I don&rsquo;t know fucking follow me on Instagram</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post pictures and shit, but I have a lot of podcast episodes pre-recorded</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna be releasing those the next couple of weeks</p>
<p>I just had to make this one as like an update because I can&rsquo;t just like</p>
<p>Post about getting jumped and then not fill you in, you know, let me friends like this is a missed FaceTime call</p>
<p>So I wanted to make this like catch everybody up, but we&rsquo;re all okay. We&rsquo;re safe</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything going on legally if anything&rsquo;s happening. I don&rsquo;t fucking think so, but we&rsquo;re okay. We&rsquo;re fine. I&rsquo;m healing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good. I&rsquo;m just a little sick. I have a little cold, but Randy&rsquo;s fine. He&rsquo;s getting a haircut right now</p>
<p>Like everything&rsquo;s fine. Everything&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t nobody stress but I&rsquo;ll be posting a little pre-recorded episodes that I had like over the next couple of weeks</p>
<p>I just want to fill you in about all this shitshow</p>
<p>So if you enjoyed this video leave it a thumbs up. Leave me a comment what you think</p>
<p>I will do an episode about my tattoos because I know you were all curious. Don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming but thank you all for checking on me</p>
<p>A lot of you saw my Instagram stories and my tick tocks and we&rsquo;re like, oh my god, what the fuck happened?</p>
<p>So thank you for checking on me. I appreciate all the well wishes</p>
<p>I love you all so much, but I will never be taking a fucking recommendation and get offline because fuck all of you</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s ones of you that care about me, but there&rsquo;s also motherfuckers that want to set shit up like that</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not taking no more recommendations because I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a setup or nothing</p>
<p>So love you all to death, but trust no one</p>
<p>Perfect timing. Thank you so much for watching and I will talk to you guys next Sunday</p>
