is hidden in the definition now if you have diabetes and you do your own research you&amp;rsquo;re going to be completely and utterly confused because if you look up the definition of diabetes it will say that it&amp;rsquo;s hyperglycemia which is high blood sugar which is affecting the large vessels especially in the heart this can affect the tiny blood vessels of the eye and the kidney and also it&amp;rsquo;s going to affect your nerves as in creating damage in the peripheral nerves the nerves at the bottom of the feet and the hands so your fingers will get numb and pain and sometimes a burning sensation now if we look at the causation of insulin it will talk about a lack of insulin or a decrease in insulin since insulin is the hormone that controls the blood sugars so if we don&amp;rsquo;t have the hormonal controls of the lowering blood sugar and that&amp;rsquo;s not there blood sugar starts going higher and higher and you&amp;rsquo;re diabetic now take a look at what controls insulin the pancreas so the pancreas through its beta cells make insulin the insulin goes through the blood it connects to certain receptors to create a function of lowering the blood sugar and so what&amp;rsquo;s going to cause a lack of insulin is either the lack of production of insulin or on the other side here a blocked receptor so the receptor for insulin becomes resistive as in insulin resistance okay so either we have insulin resistance or we have a pancreas that&amp;rsquo;s not able to produce insulin but in guyana&amp;rsquo;s physiology and other medical textbooks you see this little clue here as the first thing that happens when you start to have diabetes is you have what&amp;rsquo;s called compensatory hyperinsulinemia now what is that that means that when the cells start resisting insulin the pancreas will compensate by making more insulin so we still have the function of lowering blood sugar to a certain degree and so we have insulin resistance so the pancreas is going to compensate by making more insulin okay so that&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s compensating okay and then what happens after a period of time the second thing that happens is you no longer are able to compensate because the beta cells are now dysfunctional they&amp;rsquo;re exhausted they&amp;rsquo;re overwhelmed and they stop working and so when this starts to go down the blood sugars start to go higher and higher and higher so the real big question to figure this out is what&amp;rsquo;s causing the initial hyper insulin situation what is causing this increase in insulin well for that we have to look up hyperinsulinemia which is very interesting because if we look at wikipedia and what causes high insulin it says neoplasm which is a tumor carb malabsorption okay pancreatic cancer pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome and trans fats it also goes on to say results from a variety of diseases we&amp;rsquo;re talking about these as well as sugar in the diet now that&amp;rsquo;s like red at the very very end and there&amp;rsquo;s no real emphasis of this and it&amp;rsquo;s really nowhere else in this whole page and so if you&amp;rsquo;re new at this and you&amp;rsquo;re just reading this and you don&amp;rsquo;t know the massive connection between consuming sugar and diabetes you might focus more on these things right here wow maybe i have cancer maybe i have pcos and focus on something that is so rare that you&amp;rsquo;re going to miss this right here i mean if you knew to grab maybe a physiology book like guys physiology and look up insulin but you probably never do that but if you did you&amp;rsquo;d find all sorts of information on what triggers insulin the big one is carbohydrates so in order to control this you must lower the carbs in the diet but you might be confused if you read this book right here merck&amp;rsquo;s manual under the chapter of diabetes because it&amp;rsquo;s talking about the diet for diabetes it says this diet composition there is no need to disproportionately restrict the intake of carbohydrates in the diet of most diabetics what that is absolutely bad advice because what they&amp;rsquo;re going to recommend is you just manage it with metformin and if you consume more carbohydrates just increase your medication to adjust for that now there&amp;rsquo;s some other additional things on this page that were very interesting to me they&amp;rsquo;re talking about mice studies they mentioned that a high fat diet has a causative role in hyperinsulinemia now if you&amp;rsquo;re an average person you&amp;rsquo;re reading this you&amp;rsquo;re going to go wow i need to start cutting my fat out of my diet and the problem with even reading the study is you&amp;rsquo;re not going to even find the complete study you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to buy the study online so if you were to buy the study online and download it and then find out what they actually fed the mice what do they consider a high-fat diet which i&amp;rsquo;ve actually done this i&amp;rsquo;ve ordered a study and i&amp;rsquo;ve researched what they feed these mice you&amp;rsquo;re going to find that this is not just a high-fat diet this is a high fat slash high carbohydrate diet now we have a little piece of omitted information that could be devastating if you&amp;rsquo;re operating off of this false information because if you combine carbs with fat or carbs with protein versus just consuming carbs alone you&amp;rsquo;re going to have a much greater impact or spike in insulin when you combine a high fat and high carb diet so no wonder this high fat diet is a causative factor in creating high levels of insulin okay so then you get down to the bottom of the page and it talks about the treatment diet exercise metformin they also mention consuming cinnamon like in cinnamon and sugar on your toast right and so when you look further on the page specifically this what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about with this diet you&amp;rsquo;re talking about lowering simple carbohydrates okay not actually eliminating simple carbohydrates like sugar but lowering them and replacing them with whole grains okay now they didn&amp;rsquo;t even mention consuming vegetables they&amp;rsquo;re talking about adding grains if you have too much insulin it&amp;rsquo;s the carbohydrates that increase insulin more than anything else and whole grains are carbohydrates in the next sentence they say reduce potatoes so they don&amp;rsquo;t tell you to eliminate potatoes just reduce them again a potato is a carbohydrate why are you even talking about a potato you should be eliminating all carbs or at least bringing them down significantly and then they actually add a sentence in there that says you need to increase your legumes especially soy they didn&amp;rsquo;t mention anything about any other beans or anything they just made a point about consuming soy so i looked up to study and what they were talking about and of course this study was a questionnaire study very very scientific right where there&amp;rsquo;s a million variables you have people that smoke you have people that eat a random thing and how are you going to isolate that it was the soy that reduced the insulin levels in your blood you can&amp;rsquo;t so obviously this was put in here with some slight bias as well as this one right here and so this is why i do videos to help put attention on the important stuff so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to get lost in the sea of confusion in the area of health thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u."><title>The Secret to Diabetes is Hidden in its Definition ｜ DrEricBergDC |

definition now if you have diabetes and  </p><p>you do your own research you&rsquo;re going 
to be completely and utterly confused  </p><p>because if you look up the definition of diabetes 
it will say that it&rsquo;s hyperglycemia which is high  </p><p>blood sugar which is affecting the large vessels 
especially in the heart this can affect the tiny  </p><p>blood vessels of the eye and the kidney and also 
it&rsquo;s going to affect your nerves as in creating  </p><p>damage in the peripheral nerves the nerves at 
the bottom of the feet and the hands so your  </p><p>fingers will get numb and pain and sometimes a 
burning sensation now if we look at the causation  </p><p>of insulin it will talk about a lack of insulin or 
a decrease in insulin since insulin is the hormone  </p><p>that controls the blood sugars so if we don&rsquo;t have 
the hormonal controls of the lowering blood sugar  </p><p>and that&rsquo;s not there blood sugar starts 
going higher and higher and you&rsquo;re diabetic  </p><p>now take a look at what controls insulin the 
pancreas so the pancreas through its beta cells  </p><p>make insulin the insulin goes through the blood it 
connects to certain receptors to create a function  </p><p>of lowering the blood sugar and so what&rsquo;s going 
to cause a lack of insulin is either the lack of  </p><p>production of insulin or on the other side here 
a blocked receptor so the receptor for insulin  </p><p>becomes resistive as in insulin resistance okay 
so either we have insulin resistance or we have  </p><p>a pancreas that&rsquo;s not able to produce insulin but 
in guyana&rsquo;s physiology and other medical textbooks  </p><p>you see this little clue here as the first 
thing that happens when you start to have  </p><p>diabetes is you have what&rsquo;s called compensatory 
hyperinsulinemia now what is that that means  </p><p>that when the cells start resisting insulin 
the pancreas will compensate by making more  </p><p>insulin so we still have the function of lowering 
blood sugar to a certain degree and so we have  </p><p>insulin resistance so the pancreas is going to 
compensate by making more insulin okay so that&rsquo;s  </p><p>it&rsquo;s compensating okay and then what happens after 
a period of time the second thing that happens is  </p><p>you no longer are able to compensate because the 
beta cells are now dysfunctional they&rsquo;re exhausted  </p><p>they&rsquo;re overwhelmed and they stop working 
and so when this starts to go down  </p><p>the blood sugars start to go higher and higher and 
higher so the real big question to figure this out  </p><p>is what&rsquo;s causing the initial hyper 
insulin situation what is causing this  </p><p>increase in insulin well for that we have 
to look up hyperinsulinemia which is very  </p><p>interesting because if we look at wikipedia and 
what causes high insulin it says neoplasm which  </p><p>is a tumor carb malabsorption okay pancreatic 
cancer pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome  </p><p>and trans fats it also goes on to say results from 
a variety of diseases we&rsquo;re talking about these  </p><p>as well as sugar in the diet now that&rsquo;s like 
red at the very very end and there&rsquo;s no real  </p><p>emphasis of this and it&rsquo;s really nowhere else 
in this whole page and so if you&rsquo;re new at this  </p><p>and you&rsquo;re just reading this and you don&rsquo;t know 
the massive connection between consuming sugar  </p><p>and diabetes you might focus more on these 
things right here wow maybe i have cancer  </p><p>maybe i have pcos and focus on something that is 
so rare that you&rsquo;re going to miss this right here  </p><p>i mean if you knew to grab maybe a physiology book 
like guys physiology and look up insulin but you  </p><p>probably never do that but if you did you&rsquo;d find 
all sorts of information on what triggers insulin  </p><p>the big one is carbohydrates so in order to 
control this you must lower the carbs in the diet  </p><p>but you might be confused if you read this book 
right here merck&rsquo;s manual under the chapter of  </p><p>diabetes because it&rsquo;s talking about the diet for 
diabetes it says this diet composition there is no  </p><p>need to disproportionately restrict the intake of 
carbohydrates in the diet of most diabetics what  </p><p>that is absolutely bad advice because what they&rsquo;re 
going to recommend is you just manage it with  </p><p>metformin and if you consume more carbohydrates 
just increase your medication to adjust for that  </p><p>now there&rsquo;s some other additional things on 
this page that were very interesting to me  </p><p>they&rsquo;re talking about mice studies they mentioned 
that a high fat diet has a causative role  </p><p>in hyperinsulinemia now if you&rsquo;re an average 
person you&rsquo;re reading this you&rsquo;re going to go  </p><p>wow i need to start cutting my fat out of my diet 
and the problem with even reading the study is  </p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to even find the complete study 
you&rsquo;re going to have to buy the study online  </p><p>so if you were to buy the study online and 
download it and then find out what they actually  </p><p>fed the mice what do they consider a high-fat diet 
which i&rsquo;ve actually done this i&rsquo;ve ordered a study  </p><p>and i&rsquo;ve researched what they feed these 
mice you&rsquo;re going to find that this is  </p><p>not just a high-fat diet this is a high fat 
slash high carbohydrate diet now we have a  </p><p>little piece of omitted information that could be 
devastating if you&rsquo;re operating off of this false  </p><p>information because if you combine carbs with fat 
or carbs with protein versus just consuming carbs  </p><p>alone you&rsquo;re going to have a much greater impact 
or spike in insulin when you combine a high fat  </p><p>and high carb diet so no wonder this high fat diet 
is a causative factor in creating high levels of  </p><p>insulin okay so then you get down to the bottom 
of the page and it talks about the treatment  </p><p>diet exercise metformin they also mention 
consuming cinnamon like in cinnamon and sugar  </p><p>on your toast right and so when you look further 
on the page specifically this what they&rsquo;re talking  </p><p>about with this diet you&rsquo;re talking about lowering 
simple carbohydrates okay not actually eliminating  </p><p>simple carbohydrates like sugar but lowering 
them and replacing them with whole grains  </p><p>okay now they didn&rsquo;t even mention consuming 
vegetables they&rsquo;re talking about adding grains  </p><p>if you have too much insulin it&rsquo;s the 
carbohydrates that increase insulin more than  </p><p>anything else and whole grains are carbohydrates 
in the next sentence they say reduce potatoes  </p><p>so they don&rsquo;t tell you to eliminate potatoes 
just reduce them again a potato is a carbohydrate  </p><p>why are you even talking about a potato you should 
be eliminating all carbs or at least bringing  </p><p>them down significantly and then they actually 
add a sentence in there that says you need to  </p><p>increase your legumes especially soy they didn&rsquo;t 
mention anything about any other beans or anything  </p><p>they just made a point about consuming soy 
so i looked up to study and what they were  </p><p>talking about and of course this study was a 
questionnaire study very very scientific right  </p><p>where there&rsquo;s a million variables you have 
people that smoke you have people that eat a  </p><p>random thing and how are you going to isolate that 
it was the soy that reduced the insulin levels in  </p><p>your blood you can&rsquo;t so obviously this was put 
in here with some slight bias as well as this  </p><p>one right here and so this is why i do videos to 
help put attention on the important stuff so you  </p><p>don&rsquo;t have to get lost in the sea of confusion 
in the area of health thanks for watching  </p><p>before you go if you have a question about a 
product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to  </p><p>know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and you 
need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth  </p><p>i have a keto consultant standing 
by to help you this is just for the  </p><p>people in the u.s hopefully in the future 
we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p><p>but i put the number down below 
so you can call and get some help</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
