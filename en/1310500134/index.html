    <p>The following is a conversation with Chris Latner,</p>
<p>his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the most brilliant engineers</p>
<p>in modern computing, having created</p>
<p>LLVM compiler infrastructure project,</p>
<p>the Clang compiler, the Swift programming language,</p>
<p>a lot of key contributions to TensorFlow and TPUs</p>
<p>as part of Google.</p>
<p>He served as vice president of autopilot software at Tesla,</p>
<p>was a software innovator and leader at Apple,</p>
<p>and now is at SciFive as senior vice president</p>
<p>of platform engineering, looking to revolutionize</p>
<p>chip design to make it faster, better, and cheaper.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts</p>
<p>related to the episode.</p>
<p>First sponsor is Blinkist, an app that summarizes</p>
<p>key ideas from thousands of books.</p>
<p>I use it almost every day to learn new things</p>
<p>or to pick which books I want to read or listen to next.</p>
<p>Second is Neuro, the maker of functional sugar free gum</p>
<p>and mints that I use to supercharge my mind</p>
<p>with caffeine, altheanine, and B vitamins.</p>
<p>Third is Masterclass, online courses from the best people</p>
<p>in the world on each of the topics covered,</p>
<p>from rockets, to game design, to poker,</p>
<p>to writing, and to guitar.</p>
<p>And finally, Cash App, the app I use to send money</p>
<p>to friends for food, drinks, and unfortunately, lost bets.</p>
<p>Please check out the sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that Chris has been</p>
<p>an inspiration to me on a human level</p>
<p>because he is so damn good as an engineer</p>
<p>and leader of engineers, and yet he&rsquo;s able to stay humble,</p>
<p>especially humble enough to hear the voices</p>
<p>of disagreement and to learn from them.</p>
<p>He was supportive of me and this podcast</p>
<p>from the early days, and for that, I&rsquo;m forever grateful.</p>
<p>To be honest, most of my life, no one really believed</p>
<p>that I would amount to much.</p>
<p>So when another human being looks at me,</p>
<p>it makes me feel like I might be someone special,</p>
<p>it can be truly inspiring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lesson for educators.</p>
<p>The weird kid in the corner with a dream</p>
<p>is someone who might need your love and support</p>
<p>in order for that dream to flourish.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Chris Latner.</p>
<p>What are the strongest qualities of Steve Jobs,</p>
<p>Elon Musk, and the great and powerful Jeff Dean</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to work with each?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting with an easy question there.</p>
<p>These are three very different people.</p>
<p>I guess you could do maybe a pairwise comparison</p>
<p>between them instead of a group comparison.</p>
<p>So if you look at Steve Jobs and Elon,</p>
<p>I worked a lot more with Elon than I did with Steve.</p>
<p>They have a lot of commonality.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both visionary in their own way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both very demanding in their own way.</p>
<p>My sense is Steve is much more human factor focused</p>
<p>where Elon is more technology focused.</p>
<p>What does human factor mean?</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s trying to build things that feel good,</p>
<p>that people love, that affect people&rsquo;s lives, how they live.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking into the future a little bit</p>
<p>in terms of what people want.</p>
<p>Where I think that Elon focuses more on</p>
<p>learning how exponentials work and predicting</p>
<p>the development of those.</p>
<p>Steve worked with a lot of engineers.</p>
<p>That was one of the things that are reading the biography.</p>
<p>How can a designer essentially talk to engineers</p>
<p>and get their respect?</p>
<p>I think, so I did not work very closely with Steve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert at all.</p>
<p>My sense is that he pushed people really hard,</p>
<p>but then when he got an explanation that made sense to him,</p>
<p>then he would let go.</p>
<p>And he did actually have a lot of respect for engineering,</p>
<p>but he also knew when to push.</p>
<p>And when you can read people well,</p>
<p>you can know when they&rsquo;re holding back</p>
<p>and when you can get a little bit more out of them.</p>
<p>And I think he was very good at that.</p>
<p>I mean, if you compare the other folks,</p>
<p>so Jeff Dean, right?</p>
<p>Jeff Dean&rsquo;s an amazing guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s super smart, as are the other guys.</p>
<p>Jeff is a really, really, really nice guy, well meaning.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a classic Googler.</p>
<p>He wants people to be happy.</p>
<p>He combines it with brilliance</p>
<p>so he can pull people together in a really great way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s definitely not a CEO type.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he would even want to be that.</p>
<p>Do you know if he still programs?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, he definitely programs.</p>
<p>Jeff is an amazing engineer today, right?</p>
<p>And that has never changed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really hard to compare Jeff to either of those two.</p>
<p>I think that Jeff leads through technology</p>
<p>and building it himself and then pulling people in</p>
<p>and inspiring them.</p>
<p>And so I think that that&rsquo;s one of the amazing things</p>
<p>about Jeff.</p>
<p>But each of these people, with their pros and cons,</p>
<p>all are really inspirational</p>
<p>and have achieved amazing things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate to get to work with these guys.</p>
<p>For yourself, you&rsquo;ve led large teams,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done so many incredible,</p>
<p>difficult technical challenges.</p>
<p>Is there something you&rsquo;ve picked up from them</p>
<p>about how to lead?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, I think leadership is really hard.</p>
<p>It really depends on what you&rsquo;re looking for there.</p>
<p>I think you really need to know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So being grounded on the product, on the technology,</p>
<p>on the business, on the mission is really important.</p>
<p>Understanding what people are looking for,</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>One of the most amazing things about Tesla</p>
<p>is the unifying vision, right?</p>
<p>People are there because they believe in clean energy</p>
<p>and electrification, all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>The other is to understand what really motivates people,</p>
<p>how to get the best people,</p>
<p>how to build a plan that actually can be executed, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many different aspects of leadership</p>
<p>and it really depends on the time, the place, the problems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of issues that don&rsquo;t need to be solved.</p>
<p>And so if you focus on the right things and prioritize well,</p>
<p>that can really help move things.</p>
<p>Two interesting things you mentioned.</p>
<p>One is you really have to know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>How you&rsquo;ve worked on your business,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve worked on a lot of very challenging technical things.</p>
<p>So I kind of assume you were born technically savvy,</p>
<p>but assuming that&rsquo;s not the case,</p>
<p>how did you develop technical expertise?</p>
<p>Like even at Google you worked on,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many projects,</p>
<p>but really challenging, very varied.</p>
<p>Compilers, TPUs, hardware, cloud stuff,</p>
<p>bunch of different things.</p>
<p>The thing that I&rsquo;ve become comfortable</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve more comfortable with as I&rsquo;ve gained experience</p>
<p>is being okay with not knowing.</p>
<p>And so a major part of leadership is actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about having the right answer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about getting the right answer.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re working in a team of amazing people, right?</p>
<p>And many of these places, many of these companies</p>
<p>all have amazing people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the question of how do you get people together?</p>
<p>How do you build trust?</p>
<p>How do you get people to open up?</p>
<p>How do you get people to be vulnerable sometimes</p>
<p>with an idea that maybe isn&rsquo;t good enough,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the start of something beautiful?</p>
<p>How do you provide an environment</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not just like top down,</p>
<p>thou shalt do the thing that I tell you to do, right?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re encouraging people to be part of the solution</p>
<p>and providing a safe space</p>
<p>where if you&rsquo;re not doing the right thing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re willing to tell you about it, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re asking dumb questions?</p>
<p>Yeah, dumb questions are my specialty, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, so I&rsquo;ve been in the hardware realm recently</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know much at all about how chips are designed.</p>
<p>I know a lot about using them.</p>
<p>I know some of the principles</p>
<p>and the art&rsquo;s technical level of this,</p>
<p>but it turns out that if you ask a lot of dumb questions,</p>
<p>you get smarter really, really quick.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re surrounded by people that want to teach</p>
<p>and learn themselves, it can be a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about programming languages, if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>At the highest absurd philosophical level,</p>
<p>because I&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get romantic on me, Lex.</p>
<p>I will forever get romantic and torture you, I apologize.</p>
<p>Why do programming languages even matter?</p>
<p>Okay, well, thank you very much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying why should you care</p>
<p>about any one programming language</p>
<p>or why do we care about programming computers or?</p>
<p>No, why do we care about programming language design,</p>
<p>creating effective programming languages,</p>
<p>choosing one programming languages</p>
<p>such as another programming language,</p>
<p>why we keep struggling and improving</p>
<p>through the evolution of these programming languages.</p>
<p>Sure, sure, sure.</p>
<p>Okay, so I mean, I think you have to come back</p>
<p>to what are we trying to do here, right?</p>
<p>So we have these beasts called computers</p>
<p>that are very good at specific kinds of things</p>
<p>and we think it&rsquo;s useful to have them do it for us, right?</p>
<p>Now you have this question of how best to express that</p>
<p>because you have a human brain still</p>
<p>that has an idea in its head</p>
<p>and you want to achieve something, right?</p>
<p>So, well, there&rsquo;s lots of ways of doing this.</p>
<p>You can go directly to the machine</p>
<p>and speak assembly language</p>
<p>and then you can express directly</p>
<p>what the computer understands, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You can then have higher and higher and higher levels</p>
<p>of abstraction up until machine learning</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re designing a neural net to do the work for you.</p>
<p>The question is where along this way do you want to stop</p>
<p>and what benefits do you get out of doing so?</p>
<p>And so programming languages in general,</p>
<p>you have C, you have Fortran, Java and Ada, Pascal, Swift,</p>
<p>you have lots of different things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have different trade offs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re tackling different parts of the problems.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that most programming languages do</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re trying to make it</p>
<p>so that you have pretty basic things</p>
<p>like portability across different hardware.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got, I&rsquo;m gonna run on an Intel PC,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna run on a RISC 5 PC,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna run on a ARM phone or something like that, fine.</p>
<p>I wanna write one program and have it portable.</p>
<p>And this is something that assembly doesn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Now, when you start looking</p>
<p>at the space of programming languages,</p>
<p>this is where I think it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>because programming languages all have trade offs</p>
<p>and most people will walk up to them</p>
<p>and they look at the surface level of syntax and say,</p>
<p>oh, I like curly braces or I like tabs</p>
<p>or I like semi colons or not or whatever, right?</p>
<p>Subjective, fairly subjective, very shallow things.</p>
<p>But programming languages when done right</p>
<p>can actually be very powerful.</p>
<p>And the benefit they bring is expression.</p>
<p>Okay, and if you look at programming languages,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really kind of two different levels to them.</p>
<p>One is the down in the dirt, nuts and bolts</p>
<p>of how do you get the computer to be efficient,</p>
<p>stuff like that, how they work,</p>
<p>type systems, compiler stuff, things like that.</p>
<p>The other is the UI.</p>
<p>And the UI for programming language</p>
<p>is really a design problem</p>
<p>and a lot of people don&rsquo;t think about it that way.</p>
<p>And the UI, you mean all that stuff with the braces and?</p>
<p>Yeah, all that stuff&rsquo;s the UI and what it is</p>
<p>and UI means user interface.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s really going on is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the interface between the guts and the human.</p>
<p>And humans are hard, right?</p>
<p>Humans have feelings, they have things they like,</p>
<p>they have things they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And a lot of people treat programming languages</p>
<p>as though humans are just kind of abstract creatures</p>
<p>that cannot be predicted.</p>
<p>But it turns out that actually there is better and worse.</p>
<p>Like people can tell when a programming language is good</p>
<p>or when it was an accident, right?</p>
<p>And one of the things with Swift in particular</p>
<p>is that a tremendous amount of time</p>
<p>by a tremendous number of people</p>
<p>have been put into really polishing and making it feel good.</p>
<p>But it also has really good nuts and bolts underneath it.</p>
<p>You said that Swift makes a lot of people feel good.</p>
<p>How do you get to that point?</p>
<p>So how do you predict that tens of thousands,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of people are going to enjoy</p>
<p>using this user experience of this programming language?</p>
<p>Well, you can look at it in terms of better and worse, right?</p>
<p>So if you have to write lots of boilerplate</p>
<p>or something like that, you will feel unproductive.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>You can look at it in terms of safety.</p>
<p>If like C for example,</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called a memory unsafe language.</p>
<p>And so you get dangling pointers</p>
<p>and you get all these kinds of bugs</p>
<p>that then you have spent tons of time debugging</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a real pain in the butt and you feel unproductive.</p>
<p>And so by subtracting these things from the experience,</p>
<p>you get happier people.</p>
<p>But again, keep interrupting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but so hard to deal with.</p>
<p>If you look at the people that are most productive</p>
<p>on Stack Overflow, they have a set of priorities</p>
<p>that may not always correlate perfectly</p>
<p>with the experience of the majority of users.</p>
<p>If you look at the most upvoted,</p>
<p>quote unquote, correct answer on Stack Overflow,</p>
<p>it usually really sort of prioritizes</p>
<p>like safe code, proper code, stable code,</p>
<p>you know, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>As opposed to like,</p>
<p>if I wanna use go to statements in my basic, right?</p>
<p>I wanna use go to statements.</p>
<p>Like what if 99% of people wanna use go to statements?</p>
<p>So you use completely improper, you know, unsafe syntax.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that people actually,</p>
<p>like if you boil it down and you get below</p>
<p>the surface level, people don&rsquo;t actually care</p>
<p>about go tos or if statements or things like this.</p>
<p>They care about achieving a goal, right?</p>
<p>So the real question is I wanna set up a web server</p>
<p>and I wanna do a thing, whatever.</p>
<p>Like how quickly can I achieve that, right?</p>
<p>And so from a programming language perspective,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really two things that matter there.</p>
<p>One is what libraries exist</p>
<p>and then how quickly can you put it together</p>
<p>and what are the tools around that look like, right?</p>
<p>And when you wanna build a library that&rsquo;s missing,</p>
<p>what do you do?</p>
<p>Okay, now this is where you see huge divergence</p>
<p>in the force between worlds, okay?</p>
<p>And so you look at Python, for example.</p>
<p>Python is really good at assembling things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not so great at building all the libraries.</p>
<p>And so what you get because of performance reasons,</p>
<p>other things like this,</p>
<p>is you get Python layered on top of C, for example,</p>
<p>and that means that doing certain kinds of things</p>
<p>well, it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense to do in Python.</p>
<p>Instead you do it in C and then you wrap it</p>
<p>and then you have, you&rsquo;re living in two worlds</p>
<p>and two worlds never is really great</p>
<p>because tooling and the debugger doesn&rsquo;t work right</p>
<p>and like all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Can you clarify a little bit what you mean</p>
<p>by Python is not good at building libraries,</p>
<p>meaning it doesn&rsquo;t make it conducive.</p>
<p>Certain kinds of libraries.</p>
<p>No, but just the actual meaning of the sentence,</p>
<p>meaning like it&rsquo;s not conducive to developers</p>
<p>to come in and add libraries</p>
<p>or is it the duality of the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dance between Python and C and&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, so Python&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Python&rsquo;s a great language.</p>
<p>I did not mean to say that Python is bad for libraries.</p>
<p>What I meant to say is there are libraries</p>
<p>that Python&rsquo;s really good at that you can write in Python,</p>
<p>but there are other things,</p>
<p>like if you wanna build a machine learning framework,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna build a machine learning framework</p>
<p>in Python because of performance, for example,</p>
<p>or you want GPU acceleration or things like this.</p>
<p>Instead, what you do is you write a bunch of C</p>
<p>or C++ code or something like that,</p>
<p>and then you talk to it from Python, right?</p>
<p>And so this is because of decisions</p>
<p>that were made in the Python design</p>
<p>and those decisions have other counterbalancing forces.</p>
<p>But the trick when you start looking at this</p>
<p>from a programming language perspective,</p>
<p>you start to say, okay, cool.</p>
<p>How do I build this catalog of libraries</p>
<p>that are really powerful?</p>
<p>And how do I make it so that then they can be assembled</p>
<p>into ways that feel good</p>
<p>and they generally work the first time?</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re talking about building a thing,</p>
<p>you have to include the debugging, the fixing,</p>
<p>the turnaround cycle, the development cycle,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>into the process of building the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about pounding out the code.</p>
<p>And so this is where things like catching bugs</p>
<p>at compile time is valuable, for example.</p>
<p>But if you dive into the details in this,</p>
<p>Swift, for example, has certain things like value semantics,</p>
<p>which is this fancy way of saying</p>
<p>that when you treat a variable like a value,</p>
<p>it acts like a mathematical object would.</p>
<p>Okay, so you have used PyTorch a little bit.</p>
<p>In PyTorch, you have tensors.</p>
<p>Tensors are n dimensional grid of numbers, very simple.</p>
<p>You can do plus and other operators on them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all totally fine.</p>
<p>But why do you need to clone a tensor sometimes?</p>
<p>Have you ever run into that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, and so why is that?</p>
<p>Why do you need to clone a tensor?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the usual object thing that&rsquo;s in Python.</p>
<p>So in Python, and just like with Java</p>
<p>and many other languages, this isn&rsquo;t unique to Python.</p>
<p>In Python, it has a thing called reference semantics,</p>
<p>which is the nerdy way of explaining this.</p>
<p>And what that means is you actually have a pointer</p>
<p>do a thing instead of the thing, okay?</p>
<p>Now, this is due to a bunch of implementation details</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want to go into.</p>
<p>But in Swift, you have this thing called value semantics.</p>
<p>And so when you have a tensor in Swift, it is a value.</p>
<p>If you copy it, it looks like you have a unique copy.</p>
<p>And if you go change one of those copies,</p>
<p>then it doesn&rsquo;t update the other one</p>
<p>because you just made a copy of this thing, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like highly error prone</p>
<p>in at least computer science, math centric disciplines</p>
<p>about Python, that like the thing you would expect</p>
<p>to behave like math.</p>
<p>Like math, it doesn&rsquo;t behave like math.</p>
<p>And in fact, quietly it doesn&rsquo;t behave like math</p>
<p>and then can ruin the entirety of your math thing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Well, and then it puts you in debugging land again.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right now, you just want to get something done</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, wait a second, where do I need to put clone?</p>
<p>And what level of the stack, which is very complicated,</p>
<p>which I thought I was reusing somebody&rsquo;s library</p>
<p>and now I need to understand it</p>
<p>to know where to clone a thing, right?</p>
<p>And hard to debug, by the way.</p>
<p>Exactly, right.</p>
<p>And so this is where programming languages really matter.</p>
<p>Right, and so in Swift having value semantics</p>
<p>so that both you get the benefit of math,</p>
<p>working like math, right?</p>
<p>But also the efficiency that comes with certain advantages</p>
<p>there, certain implementation details there</p>
<p>really benefit you as a programmer, right?</p>
<p>Can you clarify the value semantics?</p>
<p>Like how do you know that a thing should be treated</p>
<p>like a value?</p>
<p>Yeah, so Swift has a pretty strong culture</p>
<p>and good language support for defining values.</p>
<p>And so if you have an array,</p>
<p>so tensors are one example that the machine learning folks</p>
<p>are very used to.</p>
<p>Just think about arrays, same thing,</p>
<p>where you have an array, you create an array,</p>
<p>you put two or three or four things into it,</p>
<p>and then you pass it off to another function.</p>
<p>What happens if that function adds some more things to it?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ll see it on the side that you pass it in, right?</p>
<p>This is called reference semantics.</p>
<p>Now, what if you pass an array off to a function,</p>
<p>it scrolls it away in some dictionary</p>
<p>or some other data structure somewhere, right?</p>
<p>Well, it thought that you just handed it that array,</p>
<p>then you return back and that reference to that array</p>
<p>still exists in the caller,</p>
<p>and they go and put more stuff in it, right?</p>
<p>The person you handed it off to</p>
<p>may have thought they had the only reference to that,</p>
<p>and so they didn&rsquo;t know that this was gonna change</p>
<p>underneath the covers.</p>
<p>And so this is where you end up having to do clone.</p>
<p>So like I was passed a thing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I have the only version of it,</p>
<p>so now I have to clone it.</p>
<p>So what value semantics does is it allows you to say,</p>
<p>hey, I have a, so in Swift, it defaults to value semantics.</p>
<p>Oh, so it defaults to value semantics,</p>
<p>and then because most things</p>
<p>should end up being like values,</p>
<p>then it makes sense for that to be the default.</p>
<p>And one of the important things about that</p>
<p>is that arrays and dictionaries</p>
<p>and all these other collections</p>
<p>that are aggregations of other things</p>
<p>also have value semantics.</p>
<p>And so when you pass this around</p>
<p>to different parts of your program,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to do these defensive copies.</p>
<p>And so this is great for two sides, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great because you define away the bug,</p>
<p>which is a big deal for productivity,</p>
<p>the number one thing most people care about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also good for performance</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re doing a clone,</p>
<p>so you pass the array down to the thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know if anybody else has it,</p>
<p>I have to clone it.</p>
<p>Well, you just did a copy of a bunch of data.</p>
<p>It could be big.</p>
<p>And then it could be that the thing that called you</p>
<p>is not keeping track of the old thing.</p>
<p>So you just made a copy of it,</p>
<p>and you may not have had to.</p>
<p>And so the way the value semantics work in Swift</p>
<p>is it uses this thing called copy on write,</p>
<p>which means that you get the benefit of safety</p>
<p>and performance.</p>
<p>And it has another special trick</p>
<p>because if you think certain languages like Java,</p>
<p>for example, they have immutable strings.</p>
<p>And so what they&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is they provide value semantics</p>
<p>by having pure immutability.</p>
<p>Functional languages have pure immutability</p>
<p>in lots of different places,</p>
<p>and this provides a much safer model</p>
<p>and it provides value semantics.</p>
<p>The problem with this is if you have immutability,</p>
<p>everything is expensive.</p>
<p>Everything requires a copy.</p>
<p>For example, in Java, if you have a string X</p>
<p>and a string Y, you append them together,</p>
<p>we have to allocate a new string to hold X, Y.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re immutable.</p>
<p>Well, strings in Java are immutable.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s optimizations for short ones,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s complicated, but generally think about them</p>
<p>as a separate allocation.</p>
<p>And so when you append them together,</p>
<p>you have to go allocate a third thing</p>
<p>because somebody might have a pointer</p>
<p>to either of the other ones, right?</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t go change them.</p>
<p>So you have to go allocate a third thing.</p>
<p>Because of the beauty of how the Swift value semantics</p>
<p>system works out, if you have a string in Swift</p>
<p>and you say, hey, put in X, right?</p>
<p>And they say, append on Y, Z, W,</p>
<p>it knows that there&rsquo;s only one reference to that.</p>
<p>And so it can do an in place update.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re not allocating tons of stuff on the side.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have all those problems.</p>
<p>When you pass it off,</p>
<p>you can know you have the only reference.</p>
<p>If you pass it off to multiple different people,</p>
<p>but nobody changes it, they can all share the same thing.</p>
<p>So you get a lot of the benefit of purely immutable design.</p>
<p>And so you get a really nice sweet spot</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t seen in other languages.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I thought there was going to be a philosophical narrative</p>
<p>here that you&rsquo;re gonna have to pay a cost for it.</p>
<p>Cause it sounds like, I think value semantics</p>
<p>is beneficial for easing of debugging</p>
<p>or minimizing the risk of errors,</p>
<p>like bringing the errors closer to the source,</p>
<p>bringing the symptom of the error closer</p>
<p>to the source of the error, however you say that.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s not a performance cost either</p>
<p>if you implement it correctly.</p>
<p>Well, so there&rsquo;s trade offs with everything.</p>
<p>And so if you are doing very low level stuff,</p>
<p>then sometimes you can notice a cost,</p>
<p>but then what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>what is the right default?</p>
<p>So coming back to user interface,</p>
<p>when you talk about programming languages,</p>
<p>one of the major things that Swift does</p>
<p>that makes people love it,</p>
<p>that is not obvious when it comes to designing a language</p>
<p>is this UI principle of progressive disclosure</p>
<p>of complexity.</p>
<p>Okay, so Swift, like many languages is very powerful.</p>
<p>The question is, when do you have to learn</p>
<p>the power as a user?</p>
<p>So Swift, like Python, allows you to start with like,</p>
<p>print hello world, right?</p>
<p>Certain other languages start with like,</p>
<p>public static void main class,</p>
<p>like all the ceremony, right?</p>
<p>And so you go to teach a new person,</p>
<p>hey, welcome to this new thing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about public access control classes.</p>
<p>Wait, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>String system.out.println, like packages,</p>
<p>like, God, right?</p>
<p>And so instead, if you take this and you say,</p>
<p>hey, we need packages, modules,</p>
<p>we need powerful things like classes,</p>
<p>we need data structures, we need like all these things.</p>
<p>The question is, how do you factor the complexity?</p>
<p>And how do you make it so that the normal case scenario</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re dealing with things that work the right way</p>
<p>in the right way, give you good performance</p>
<p>by default, but then as a power user,</p>
<p>if you want to dive down to it,</p>
<p>you have full C performance, full control</p>
<p>over low level pointers.</p>
<p>You can call malloc if you want to call malloc.</p>
<p>This is not recommended on the first page of every tutorial,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually really important</p>
<p>when you want to get work done, right?</p>
<p>And so being able to have that is really the design</p>
<p>in programming language design,</p>
<p>and design is really, really hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I think a lot of people kind of,</p>
<p>outside of UI, again, a lot of people just think</p>
<p>is subjective, like there&rsquo;s nothing,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s just like curly braces or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like somebody&rsquo;s preference,</p>
<p>but actually good design is something that you can feel.</p>
<p>And how many people are involved with good design?</p>
<p>So if we looked at Swift, but look at historically,</p>
<p>I mean, this might touch like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a Steve Jobs question too,</p>
<p>like how much dictatorial decision making is required</p>
<p>versus collaborative, and we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>how all that can go wrong or right, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, Swift, so I can&rsquo;t speak to in general,</p>
<p>all design everywhere.</p>
<p>So the way it works with Swift is that there&rsquo;s a core team,</p>
<p>and so a core team is six or seven people ish,</p>
<p>something like that, that is people that have been working</p>
<p>with Swift since very early days, and so.</p>
<p>And by early days is not that long ago.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, so it became public in 2014,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s been six years public now,</p>
<p>but so that&rsquo;s enough time that there&rsquo;s a story arc there.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, and there&rsquo;s mistakes have been made</p>
<p>that then get fixed, and you learn something,</p>
<p>and then you, you know, and so what the core team does</p>
<p>is it provides continuity, and so you wanna have a,</p>
<p>okay, well, there&rsquo;s a big hole that we wanna fill.</p>
<p>We know we wanna fill it, so don&rsquo;t do other things</p>
<p>that invade that space until we fill the hole, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a boulder that&rsquo;s missing here,</p>
<p>we wanna do, we will do that boulder,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s not today, keep out of that space.</p>
<p>And the whole team remembers the myth of the boulder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, there&rsquo;s a general sense</p>
<p>of what the future looks like in broad strokes,</p>
<p>and a shared understanding of that,</p>
<p>combined with a shared understanding of what has happened</p>
<p>in the past that worked out well and didn&rsquo;t work out well.</p>
<p>The next level out is you have the,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the Swift evolution community,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got, in that case, hundreds of people</p>
<p>that really care passionately about the way Swift evolves,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like an amazing thing to, again,</p>
<p>the core team doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to come up</p>
<p>with all the good ideas.</p>
<p>You got hundreds of people out there</p>
<p>that care about something,</p>
<p>and they come up with really good ideas too,</p>
<p>and that provides this rock tumbler for ideas.</p>
<p>And so the evolution process is,</p>
<p>a lot of people in a discourse forum,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like hashing it out and trying to talk about,</p>
<p>okay, well, should we go left or right,</p>
<p>or if we did this, what would be good?</p>
<p>And here you&rsquo;re talking about hundreds of people,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not gonna get consensus, necessarily,</p>
<p>not obvious consensus, and so there&rsquo;s a proposal process</p>
<p>that then allows the core team and the community</p>
<p>to work this out, and what the core team does</p>
<p>is it aims to get consensus out of the community</p>
<p>and provide guardrails, but also provide long term,</p>
<p>make sure we&rsquo;re going the right direction kind of things.</p>
<p>So does that group represent like the,</p>
<p>how much people will love the user interface?</p>
<p>Like, do you think they&rsquo;re able to capture that?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s something we talk about a lot,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something we care about.</p>
<p>How well we do that&rsquo;s up for debate,</p>
<p>but I think that we&rsquo;ve done pretty well so far.</p>
<p>Is the beginner in mind?</p>
<p>Yeah. Like, because you said</p>
<p>the progressive disclosure complexity.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we care a lot about that,</p>
<p>a lot about power, a lot about efficiency,</p>
<p>a lot about, there are many factors to good design,</p>
<p>and you have to figure out a way</p>
<p>to kind of work your way through that, and.</p>
<p>So if you think about, like the language I love is Lisp,</p>
<p>probably still because I use Emacs,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t done anything, any serious work in Lisp,</p>
<p>but it has a ridiculous amount of parentheses.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also, you know, with Java and C++, the braces,</p>
<p>you know, I like, I enjoyed the comfort</p>
<p>of being between braces, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, well, let&rsquo;s talk.</p>
<p>And then Python is, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>just like, and last thing to me, as a designer,</p>
<p>if I was a language designer, God forbid,</p>
<p>is I would be very surprised that Python with no braces</p>
<p>would nevertheless somehow be comforting also.</p>
<p>So like, I could see arguments for all of this.</p>
<p>But look at this, this is evidence</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not about braces versus tabs.</p>
<p>Right, exactly, you&rsquo;re good, that&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>Right, so like, you know, there&rsquo;s evidence that.</p>
<p>But see, like, it&rsquo;s one of the most argued about things.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, of course, just like tabs and spaces,</p>
<p>which it doesn&rsquo;t, I mean, there&rsquo;s one obvious right answer,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t actually matter.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not, like, come on, we&rsquo;re friends.</p>
<p>Like, come on, what are you trying to do to me here?</p>
<p>People are gonna, yeah, half the people are gonna tune out.</p>
<p>Yeah, so these, so you&rsquo;re able to identify things</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t really matter for the experience.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, no, it&rsquo;s always a really hard,</p>
<p>so the easy decisions are easy, right?</p>
<p>I mean, fine, those are not the interesting ones.</p>
<p>The hard ones are the ones that are most interesting, right?</p>
<p>The hard ones are the places where,</p>
<p>hey, we wanna do a thing, everybody agrees we should do it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one proposal on the table,</p>
<p>but it has all these bad things associated with it.</p>
<p>Well, okay, what are we gonna do about that?</p>
<p>Do we just take it?</p>
<p>Do we delay it?</p>
<p>Do we say, hey, well, maybe there&rsquo;s this other feature</p>
<p>that if we do that first, this will work out better.</p>
<p>How does this, if we do this,</p>
<p>are we paying ourselves into a corner, right?</p>
<p>And so this is where, again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having that core team of people</p>
<p>that has some continuity and has perspective,</p>
<p>has some of the historical understanding,</p>
<p>is really valuable because you get,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just like one brain,</p>
<p>you get the power of multiple people coming together</p>
<p>to make good decisions,</p>
<p>and then you get the best out of all these people,</p>
<p>and you also can harness the community around it.</p>
<p>And what about the decision of whether in Python</p>
<p>having one type or having strict typing?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s talk about this.</p>
<p>So I like how you put that, by the way.</p>
<p>So many people would say that Python doesn&rsquo;t have types.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have types, yeah.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t listened to you enough to where,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of yours and I&rsquo;ve listened to way too many</p>
<p>podcasts and videos of you talking about this stuff.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, so I would argue that Python has one type.</p>
<p>And so like when you import Python into Swift,</p>
<p>which by the way works really well,</p>
<p>you have everything comes in as a Python object.</p>
<p>Now here are their trade offs because</p>
<p>it depends on what you&rsquo;re optimizing for.</p>
<p>And Python is a super successful language</p>
<p>for a really good reason.</p>
<p>Because it has one type,</p>
<p>you get duck typing for free and things like this.</p>
<p>But also you&rsquo;re pushing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making it very easy to pound out code on one hand,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also making it very easy to introduce</p>
<p>complicated bugs that you have to debug.</p>
<p>And you pass a string into something that expects an integer</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t immediately die.</p>
<p>It goes all the way down the stack trace</p>
<p>and you find yourself in the middle of some code</p>
<p>that you really didn&rsquo;t want to know anything about.</p>
<p>And it blows up and you&rsquo;re just saying,</p>
<p>well, what did I do wrong, right?</p>
<p>And so types are good and bad and they have trade offs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good for performance and certain other things</p>
<p>depending on where you&rsquo;re coming from,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all about trade offs.</p>
<p>And so this is what design is, right?</p>
<p>Design is about weighing trade offs</p>
<p>and trying to understand the ramifications</p>
<p>of the things that you&rsquo;re weighing,</p>
<p>like types or not, or one type or many types.</p>
<p>But also within many types,</p>
<p>how powerful do you make that type system</p>
<p>is another very complicated question</p>
<p>with lots of trade offs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting by the way,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like one dimension and there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>of other dimensions, JIT compiled versus static compiled,</p>
<p>garbage collected versus reference counted</p>
<p>versus manual memory management versus,</p>
<p>like in like all these different trade offs</p>
<p>and how you balance them</p>
<p>are what make a program language good.</p>
<p>Concurrency.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in all those things, I guess,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re designing the language,</p>
<p>you also have to think of how that&rsquo;s gonna get</p>
<p>all compiled down to.</p>
<p>If you care about performance, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, and go back to Lisp, right?</p>
<p>So Lisp also, I would say JavaScript</p>
<p>is another example of a very simple language, right?</p>
<p>And so one of the, so I also love Lisp.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use it as much as maybe you do or you did.</p>
<p>No, I think we&rsquo;re both, everyone who loves Lisp,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you love, it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I love Frank Sinatra,</p>
<p>but like how often do I seriously listen to Frank Sinatra?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>But you look at that or you look at JavaScript,</p>
<p>which is another very different,</p>
<p>but relatively simple language.</p>
<p>And there are certain things that don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>in the language,</p>
<p>but there is inherent complexity to the problems</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to model.</p>
<p>And so what happens to the complexity?</p>
<p>In the case of both of them, for example,</p>
<p>you say, well, what about large scale software development?</p>
<p>Okay, well, you need something like packages.</p>
<p>Neither language has a language affordance for packages.</p>
<p>And so what you get is patterns.</p>
<p>You get things like NPN.</p>
<p>You get things like these ecosystems that get built around.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a believer that if you don&rsquo;t model</p>
<p>at least the most important inherent complexity</p>
<p>in the language,</p>
<p>then what ends up happening</p>
<p>is that complexity gets pushed elsewhere.</p>
<p>And when it gets pushed elsewhere,</p>
<p>sometimes that&rsquo;s great because often building things</p>
<p>as libraries is very flexible and very powerful</p>
<p>and allows you to evolve and things like that.</p>
<p>But often it leads to a lot of unnecessary divergence</p>
<p>in the force and fragmentation.</p>
<p>And when that happens, you just get kind of a mess.</p>
<p>And so the question is, how do you balance that?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put too much stuff in the language</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really expensive</p>
<p>and it makes things complicated.</p>
<p>But how do you model enough of the inherent complexity</p>
<p>of the problem that you provide the framework</p>
<p>and the structure for people to think about?</p>
<p>Well, so the key thing to think about</p>
<p>with programming languages,</p>
<p>and you think about what a programming language is therefore,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s about making a human more productive, right?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s an old, I think it&rsquo;s Steve Jobs quote</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s a bicycle for the mind, right?</p>
<p>You can definitely walk,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll get there a lot faster</p>
<p>if you can bicycle on your way.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>A programming language is a bicycle for the mind?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it basically, wow,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really interesting way to think about it.</p>
<p>By raising the level of abstraction,</p>
<p>now you can fit more things in your head.</p>
<p>By being able to just directly leverage somebody&rsquo;s library,</p>
<p>you can now get something done quickly.</p>
<p>In the case of Swift, Swift UI is this new framework</p>
<p>that Apple has released recently for doing UI programming.</p>
<p>And it has this declarative programming model,</p>
<p>which defines away entire classes of bugs.</p>
<p>It builds on value semantics and many other nice Swift things.</p>
<p>And what this does is it allows you to just get way more done</p>
<p>with way less code.</p>
<p>And now your productivity as a developer is much higher,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really what programming languages</p>
<p>should be about,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not about tabs versus spaces</p>
<p>or curly braces or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about how productive do you make the person.</p>
<p>And you can only see that when you have libraries</p>
<p>that were built with the right intention</p>
<p>that the language was designed for.</p>
<p>And with Swift, I think we&rsquo;re still a little bit early,</p>
<p>but Swift UI and many other things that are coming out now</p>
<p>are really showing that.</p>
<p>And I think that they&rsquo;re opening people&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think about like how</p>
<p>that the knowledge of something,</p>
<p>of how good the bicycle is,</p>
<p>how people learn about that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve used C++,</p>
<p>now this is not going to be a trash talking session</p>
<p>about C++, but I used C++ for a really long time.</p>
<p>You can go there if you want, I have the scars.</p>
<p>I feel like I spent many years without realizing</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s languages that could,</p>
<p>for my particular lifestyle, brain style, thinking style,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s languages that could make me a lot more productive</p>
<p>in the debugging stage, in just the development stage</p>
<p>and thinking like the bicycle for the mind</p>
<p>that I can fit more stuff into my&hellip;</p>
<p>Python&rsquo;s a great example of that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, a machine learning framework in Python</p>
<p>is a great example of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very high abstraction level.</p>
<p>And so you can be thinking about things</p>
<p>on a like very high level algorithmic level</p>
<p>instead of thinking about, okay, well,</p>
<p>am I copying this tensor to a GPU or not, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what you want to be thinking about.</p>
<p>And as I was telling you, I mean,</p>
<p>I guess the question I had is,</p>
<p>how does a person like me or in general people</p>
<p>discover more productive languages?</p>
<p>Like how I was, as I&rsquo;ve been telling you offline,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for like a project to work on in Swift</p>
<p>so I can really try it out.</p>
<p>I mean, my intuition was like doing a hello world</p>
<p>is not going to get me there</p>
<p>to get me to experience the power of language.</p>
<p>You need a few weeks to change your metabolism.</p>
<p>Exactly, beautifully put.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the problems with people with diets,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m actually currently, to go in parallel,</p>
<p>but in a small tangent is I&rsquo;ve been recently</p>
<p>eating only meat, okay?</p>
<p>And okay, so most people are like,</p>
<p>they think that&rsquo;s horribly unhealthy or whatever,</p>
<p>you have like a million, whatever the science is,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t sound right.</p>
<p>Well, so back when I was in college,</p>
<p>we did the Atkins diet, that was a thing.</p>
<p>Similar, but you have to always give these things a chance.</p>
<p>I mean, with dieting, I was not dieting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the things that you like.</p>
<p>If I eat, personally, if I eat meat,</p>
<p>just everything, I can be super focused</p>
<p>or more focused than usual.</p>
<p>I just feel great.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been running a lot,</p>
<p>doing pushups and pull ups and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, Python is similar in that sense for me.</p>
<p>Where are you going with this?</p>
<p>I mean, literally, I just felt I had like a stupid smile</p>
<p>on my face when I first started using Python.</p>
<p>I could code up really quick things.</p>
<p>Like I would see the world,</p>
<p>I would be empowered to write a script</p>
<p>to do some basic data processing,</p>
<p>to rename files on my computer.</p>
<p>Like Perl didn&rsquo;t do that for me,</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>And again, none of these are about which is best</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s definitely better and worse here.</p>
<p>But it clicks, right?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>If you look at Perl, for example,</p>
<p>you get bogged down in scalars versus arrays</p>
<p>versus hashes versus type globs</p>
<p>and like all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And Python&rsquo;s like, yeah, let&rsquo;s not do this.</p>
<p>And some of it is debugging.</p>
<p>Like everyone has different priorities.</p>
<p>But for me, it&rsquo;s, can I create systems for myself</p>
<p>that empower me to debug quickly?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve always been a big fan,</p>
<p>even just crude like asserts,</p>
<p>like always stating things that should be true,</p>
<p>which in Python, I found in myself doing more</p>
<p>because of type, all these kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, you could think of types in a programming language</p>
<p>as being kind of assert.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They could check the compile time, right?</p>
<p>So how do you learn a new thing?</p>
<p>Well, so this, or how do people learn new things, right?</p>
<p>This is hard.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t like to change.</p>
<p>People generally don&rsquo;t like change around them either.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re all very slow to adapt and change.</p>
<p>And usually there&rsquo;s a catalyst that&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>to force yourself over this.</p>
<p>So for learning a programming language,</p>
<p>it really comes down to finding an excuse,</p>
<p>like build a thing that the language is actually good for,</p>
<p>that the ecosystem&rsquo;s ready for.</p>
<p>And so if you were to write an iOS app, for example,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be the easy case.</p>
<p>Obviously you would use Swift for that, right?</p>
<p>There are other&hellip;</p>
<p>Android.</p>
<p>So Swift runs on Android.</p>
<p>Oh, does it?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, Swift runs in lots of places.</p>
<p>How does that work?</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, so Swift is built on top of LLVM.</p>
<p>LLVM runs everywhere.</p>
<p>LLVM, for example, builds the Android kernel.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Swift is very portable, runs on Windows.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, it runs on lots of different things.</p>
<p>And Swift, sorry to interrupt, Swift UI,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a thing called UI Kit.</p>
<p>So can I build an app with Swift?</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>is the ecosystem is what matters there.</p>
<p>So Swift UI and UI Kit are Apple technologies.</p>
<p>Okay, got it.</p>
<p>And so they happen to,</p>
<p>like Swift UI happens to be written in Swift,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an Apple proprietary framework</p>
<p>that Apple loves and wants to keep on its platform,</p>
<p>which makes total sense.</p>
<p>You go to Android and you don&rsquo;t have that library, right?</p>
<p>And so Android has a different ecosystem of things</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been built out</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t work as well with Swift.</p>
<p>And so you can totally use Swift to do like arithmetic</p>
<p>and things like this,</p>
<p>but building UI with Swift on Android</p>
<p>is not a great experience right now.</p>
<p>So if I wanted to learn Swift, what&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>I mean, the one practical different version of that</p>
<p>is Swift for TensorFlow, for example.</p>
<p>And one of the inspiring things for me</p>
<p>with both TensorFlow and PyTorch</p>
<p>is how quickly the community can like switch</p>
<p>from different libraries, like you could see</p>
<p>some of the communities switching to PyTorch now,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very easy to see.</p>
<p>And then TensorFlow is really stepping up its game.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s no reason why,</p>
<p>I think the way it works is basically</p>
<p>it has to be one GitHub repo,</p>
<p>like one paper steps up.</p>
<p>It gets people excited.</p>
<p>It gets people excited and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>ah, I have to learn this Swift for,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s Swift again?</p>
<p>And then they learn and they fall in love with it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what happened, PyTorch has it.</p>
<p>There has to be a reason, a catalyst.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, and there, I mean, people don&rsquo;t like change,</p>
<p>but it turns out that once you&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>with one or two programming languages,</p>
<p>the basics are pretty similar.</p>
<p>And so one of the fun things</p>
<p>about learning programming languages,</p>
<p>even maybe Lisp, I don&rsquo;t know if you agree with this,</p>
<p>is that when you start doing that,</p>
<p>you start learning new things.</p>
<p>Cause you have a new way to do things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re forced to do them.</p>
<p>And that forces you to explore</p>
<p>and it puts you in learning mode.</p>
<p>And when you get in learning mode,</p>
<p>your mind kind of opens a little bit</p>
<p>and you can see things in a new way,</p>
<p>even when you go back to the old place.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s totally, well Lisp is functional.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, I wish there was a kind of window,</p>
<p>maybe you can tell me if there is, there you go.</p>
<p>This is a question to ask,</p>
<p>what is the most beautiful feature</p>
<p>in a programming language?</p>
<p>Before I ask it, let me say like with Python,</p>
<p>I remember I saw Lisp comprehensions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Was like, when I like really took it in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I just loved it.</p>
<p>It was like fun to do, like it was fun to do that kind of,</p>
<p>something about it to be able to filter through a list</p>
<p>and to create a new list all in a single line was elegant.</p>
<p>I could all get into my head</p>
<p>and it just made me fall in love with the language.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So is there, let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Is there, what do you use the most beautiful feature</p>
<p>in a programming languages that you&rsquo;ve ever encountered</p>
<p>in Swift maybe and then outside of Swift?</p>
<p>I think the thing that I like the most</p>
<p>from a programming language.</p>
<p>So I think the thing you have to think about</p>
<p>with the programming language, again, what is the goal?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to get people to get things done quickly.</p>
<p>And so you need libraries, you need high quality libraries</p>
<p>and then you need a user base around them</p>
<p>that can assemble them and do cool things with them, right?</p>
<p>And so to me, the question is</p>
<p>what enables high quality libraries?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a huge divide in the world</p>
<p>between libraries who enable high quality libraries</p>
<p>versus the ones that put special stuff in the language.</p>
<p>So programming languages that enable high quality libraries?</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So, and what I mean by that is expressive libraries</p>
<p>that then feel like a natural integrated part</p>
<p>of the language itself.</p>
<p>So an example of this in Swift is that int and float</p>
<p>and also array and string, things like this,</p>
<p>these are all part of the library.</p>
<p>Like int is not hard coded into Swift.</p>
<p>And so what that means is that</p>
<p>because int is just a library thing</p>
<p>defined in the standard library,</p>
<p>along with strings and arrays and all the other things</p>
<p>that come with the standard library.</p>
<p>Well, hopefully you do like int,</p>
<p>but anything that any language features</p>
<p>that you needed to define int,</p>
<p>you can also use in your own types.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to find a quaternion</p>
<p>or something like this, right?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t come in the standard library.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very special set of people</p>
<p>that care a lot about this,</p>
<p>but those people are also important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about classism, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the people who care about ints and floats</p>
<p>are more important than the people who care about quaternions.</p>
<p>And so to me, the beautiful things</p>
<p>about programming languages is when you allow</p>
<p>those communities to build high quality libraries,</p>
<p>they feel native.</p>
<p>They feel like they&rsquo;re built into the compiler</p>
<p>without having to be.</p>
<p>What does it mean for the int to be part</p>
<p>of not hard coded in?</p>
<p>So is it like how, so what is an int?</p>
<p>Okay, int is just a integer.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s like a 64 bit integer</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>But so like the 64 bit is hard coded or no?</p>
<p>No, none of that&rsquo;s hard coded.</p>
<p>So int, if you go look at how it&rsquo;s implemented,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a struct in Swift.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a struct.</p>
<p>And then how do you add two structs?</p>
<p>Well, you define plus.</p>
<p>And so you can define plus on int.</p>
<p>Well, you can define plus on your thing too.</p>
<p>You can define, int is an odd method</p>
<p>or something like that on it.</p>
<p>And so yeah, you can add methods on the things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you can define operators, like how it behaves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just beautiful when there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about the language which enables others</p>
<p>to create libraries which are not hacky.</p>
<p>Yeah, they feel native.</p>
<p>And so one of the best examples of this is Lisp, right?</p>
<p>Because in Lisp, like all the libraries</p>
<p>are basically part of the language, right?</p>
<p>You write, turn, rewrite systems and things like this.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Can you as a counter example provide</p>
<p>what makes it difficult to write a library that&rsquo;s native?</p>
<p>Is it the Python C?</p>
<p>Well, so one example, I&rsquo;ll give you two examples.</p>
<p>Java and C++, there&rsquo;s Java and C.</p>
<p>They both allow you to define your own types,</p>
<p>but int is hard code in the language.</p>
<p>Okay, well, why?</p>
<p>Well, in Java, for example, coming back</p>
<p>to this whole reference semantic value semantic thing,</p>
<p>int gets passed around by value.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But if you make like a pair or something like that,</p>
<p>a complex number, right, it&rsquo;s a class in Java.</p>
<p>And now it gets passed around by reference, by pointer.</p>
<p>And so now you lose value semantics, right?</p>
<p>You lost math, okay.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not great, right?</p>
<p>If you can do something with int,</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t I do it with my type, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the negative side of the thing I find beautiful</p>
<p>is when you can solve that,</p>
<p>when you can have full expressivity,</p>
<p>where you as a user of the language</p>
<p>have as much or almost as much power</p>
<p>as the people who implemented</p>
<p>all the standard built in stuff,</p>
<p>because what that enables</p>
<p>is that enables truly beautiful libraries.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of weird</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve gotten used to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one, I guess, other aspect</p>
<p>of program language design.</p>
<p>You have to think, you know,</p>
<p>the old first principles thinking,</p>
<p>like, why are we doing it this way?</p>
<p>By the way, I mean, I remember,</p>
<p>because I was thinking about the walrus operator</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll ask you about it later,</p>
<p>but it hit me that like the equal sign for assignment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, why are we using the equal sign for assignment?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrong, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not the only solution, right?</p>
<p>So if you look at Pascal,</p>
<p>they use colon equals for assignment</p>
<p>and equals for equality.</p>
<p>And they use like less than greater than</p>
<p>instead of the not equal thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, there are other answers here.</p>
<p>So, but like, and yeah, like I ask you all,</p>
<p>but how do you then decide to break convention</p>
<p>to say, you know what, everybody&rsquo;s doing it wrong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do it right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like an ROI,</p>
<p>like return on investment trade off, right?</p>
<p>So if you do something weird,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say like not like colon equal</p>
<p>instead of equal for assignment,</p>
<p>that would be weird with today&rsquo;s aesthetic, right?</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;d say, cool, this is theoretically better,</p>
<p>but is it better in which ways?</p>
<p>Like, what do I get out of that?</p>
<p>Do I define away class of bugs?</p>
<p>Well, one of the class of bugs that C has</p>
<p>is that you can use like, you know,</p>
<p>if X equals without equals equals X equals Y, right?</p>
<p>Well, turns out you can solve that problem in lots of ways.</p>
<p>Clang, for example, GCC, all these compilers</p>
<p>will detect that as a likely bug, produce a warning.</p>
<p>Do they?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Oh, Clang does.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>GCC didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one of the important things</p>
<p>about programming language design is like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re literally creating suffering in the world.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like, I mean, one way to see it</p>
<p>is the bicycle for the mind,</p>
<p>but the other way is to like minimizing suffering.</p>
<p>Well, you have to decide if it&rsquo;s worth it, right?</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s come back to that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But if you look at this, and again,</p>
<p>this is where there&rsquo;s a lot of detail</p>
<p>that goes into each of these things.</p>
<p>Equal and C returns a value.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Is it messed up?</p>
<p>That allows you to say X equals Y equals Z,</p>
<p>like that works in C.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it messed up?</p>
<p>You know, most people think it&rsquo;s messed up, I think.</p>
<p>It is very, by messed up, what I mean is</p>
<p>it is very rarely used for good,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s often used for bugs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, and so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good definition of messed up, yeah.</p>
<p>You could use, you know, in hindsight,</p>
<p>this was not such a great idea, right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>One of the things with Swift that is really powerful</p>
<p>and one of the reasons it&rsquo;s actually good</p>
<p>versus it being full of good ideas</p>
<p>is that when we launched Swift 1,</p>
<p>we announced that it was public,</p>
<p>people could use it, people could build apps,</p>
<p>but it was gonna change and break, okay?</p>
<p>When Swift 2 came out, we said, hey, it&rsquo;s open source,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this open process</p>
<p>which people can help evolve and direct the language.</p>
<p>So the community at large, like Swift users,</p>
<p>can now help shape the language as it is.</p>
<p>And what happened as part of that process is</p>
<p>a lot of really bad mistakes got taken out.</p>
<p>So for example, Swift used to have the C style plus plus</p>
<p>and minus minus operators.</p>
<p>Like, what does it mean when you put it before</p>
<p>versus after, right?</p>
<p>Well, that got cargo culted from C into Swift early on.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s cargo culted?</p>
<p>Cargo culted means brought forward</p>
<p>without really considering it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is maybe not the most PC term, but.</p>
<p>You have to look it up in Urban Dictionary, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it got pulled into C without,</p>
<p>or it got pulled into Swift</p>
<p>without very good consideration.</p>
<p>And we went through this process,</p>
<p>and one of the first things got ripped out</p>
<p>was plus plus and minus minus,</p>
<p>because they lead to confusion.</p>
<p>They have very low value over saying x plus equals one,</p>
<p>and x plus equals one is way more clear.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re optimizing for teachability and clarity</p>
<p>and bugs and this multidimensional space</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>things like that really matter.</p>
<p>And so being first principles on where you&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve</p>
<p>and being anchored on the objective is really important.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about the most,</p>
<p>sort of this podcast isn&rsquo;t about information,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about drama.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me talk to you about some drama.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Pascal and colon equals,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s called the Walrus operator.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And Python in Python 3.8 added the Walrus operator.</p>
<p>And the reason I think it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>is not just because of the feature,</p>
<p>it has the same kind of expression feature</p>
<p>you can mention to see that it returns</p>
<p>the value of the assignment.</p>
<p>And then maybe you can comment on that in general,</p>
<p>but on the other side of it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also the thing that toppled the dictator.</p>
<p>So it finally drove Guido</p>
<p>to step down from BDFL, the toxicity of the community.</p>
<p>So maybe what do you think about the Walrus operator</p>
<p>in Python?</p>
<p>Is there an equivalent thing in Swift</p>
<p>that really stress tested the community?</p>
<p>And then on the flip side,</p>
<p>what do you think about Guido stepping down over it?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if I look past the details</p>
<p>of the Walrus operator,</p>
<p>one of the things that makes it most polarizing</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s syntactic sugar.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What do you mean by syntactic sugar?</p>
<p>It means you can take something</p>
<p>that already exists in the language</p>
<p>and you can express it in a more concise way.</p>
<p>So, okay, I&rsquo;m going to play dollars advocate.</p>
<p>So this is great.</p>
<p>Is that a objective or subjective statement?</p>
<p>Like, can you argue that basically anything</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t syntactic sugar or not?</p>
<p>No, not everything is syntactic sugar.</p>
<p>So for example, the type system,</p>
<p>like can you have classes versus,</p>
<p>like, do you have types or not, right?</p>
<p>So one type versus many types</p>
<p>is not something that affects syntactic sugar.</p>
<p>And so if you say,</p>
<p>I want to have the ability to define types,</p>
<p>I have to have all this like language mechanics</p>
<p>to define classes.</p>
<p>And oh, now I have to have inheritance.</p>
<p>And I have like, I have all this stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just making the language more complicated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not about sugaring it.</p>
<p>Swift has the sugar.</p>
<p>So like Swift has this thing called if let,</p>
<p>and it has a lot of different types</p>
<p>and it has various operators</p>
<p>that are used to concisify specific use cases.</p>
<p>So the problem with syntactic sugar,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>hey, I have a thing that takes a lot to write</p>
<p>and I have a new way to write it.</p>
<p>You have this like horrible trade off,</p>
<p>which becomes almost completely subjective,</p>
<p>which is how often does this happen and does it matter?</p>
<p>And one of the things that is true about human psychology,</p>
<p>particularly when you&rsquo;re talking about introducing</p>
<p>a new thing is that people overestimate</p>
<p>the burden of learning something.</p>
<p>And so it looks foreign when you haven&rsquo;t gotten used to it.</p>
<p>But if it was there from the beginning,</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;s just part of Python.</p>
<p>Like unquestionably, like this is just the thing I know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a new thing that you&rsquo;re worried about learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just part of the deal.</p>
<p>Now with Guido, I don&rsquo;t know Guido well.</p>
<p>Yeah, have you passed cross much?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve met him a couple of times,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know Guido well.</p>
<p>But the sense that I got out of that whole dynamic</p>
<p>was that he had put the,</p>
<p>not just the decision maker weight on his shoulders,</p>
<p>but it was so tied to his personal identity</p>
<p>that he took it personally and he felt the need</p>
<p>and he kind of put himself in the situation</p>
<p>of being the person,</p>
<p>instead of building a base of support around him.</p>
<p>I mean, this is probably not quite literally true,</p>
<p>but by too much concentrated on him, right?</p>
<p>And that can wear you down.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, particularly because people then say,</p>
<p>Guido, you&rsquo;re a horrible person.</p>
<p>I hate this thing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And sure, it&rsquo;s like maybe 1% of the community</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing that, but Python&rsquo;s got a big community.</p>
<p>And 1% of millions of people is a lot of hate mail.</p>
<p>And that just from human factor will just wear on you.</p>
<p>Well, to clarify, it looked from just what I saw</p>
<p>in the messaging for the,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not look at the million Python users,</p>
<p>but at the Python core developers,</p>
<p>it feels like the majority, the big majority</p>
<p>on a vote were opposed to it.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m not that close to it, so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay, so the situation is like literally,</p>
<p>yeah, I mean, the majority of the core developers</p>
<p>are against it.</p>
<p>Were opposed to it.</p>
<p>So, and they weren&rsquo;t even like against it.</p>
<p>It was, there was a few, well, they were against it,</p>
<p>but the against it wasn&rsquo;t like, this is a bad idea.</p>
<p>They were more like, we don&rsquo;t see why this is a good idea.</p>
<p>And what that results in is there&rsquo;s a stalling feeling,</p>
<p>like you just slow things down.</p>
<p>Now, from my perspective, that you could argue this,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>if we look at politics today and the way Congress works,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s slowed down everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dampener.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a dampener, but like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a dangerous thing too,</p>
<p>because if it dampens things like, you know,</p>
<p>if the dampening results.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s a low pass filter,</p>
<p>but if you need billions of dollars</p>
<p>injected into the economy or trillions of dollars,</p>
<p>then suddenly stuff happens, right?</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending our political situation,</p>
<p>just to be clear.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re talking about like a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>I was hoping we could fix like the healthcare system</p>
<p>and the education system, like, you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a politics person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>When it comes to languages,</p>
<p>the community&rsquo;s kind of right in terms of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very high burden to add something to a language.</p>
<p>So as soon as you add something,</p>
<p>you have a community of people building on it</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t remove it, okay?</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s a community of people</p>
<p>that feel really uncomfortable with it,</p>
<p>then taking it slow, I think, is an important thing to do.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no rush, particularly if it was something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 25 years old and is very established.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s not like coming into its own.</p>
<p>What about features?</p>
<p>Well, so I think that the issue with Guido</p>
<p>is that maybe this is a case</p>
<p>where he realized it had outgrown him</p>
<p>and it went from being the language.</p>
<p>So Python, I mean, Guido&rsquo;s amazing,</p>
<p>but Python isn&rsquo;t about Guido anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the users.</p>
<p>And to a certain extent, the users own it.</p>
<p>And, you know, Guido spent years of his life,</p>
<p>a significant fraction of his career on Python.</p>
<p>And from his perspective, I imagine he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, this is my thing.</p>
<p>I should be able to do the thing I think is right.</p>
<p>But you can also understand the users</p>
<p>where they feel like, you know, this is my thing.</p>
<p>I use this, like, and I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s a hard thing.</p>
<p>But what, if we could talk about leadership in this,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so interesting to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make, I&rsquo;m gonna work.</p>
<p>Hopefully somebody makes it.</p>
<p>If not, I&rsquo;ll make it a Walrus Operator shirt,</p>
<p>because I think it represents, to me,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s my Russian roots or something.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s the burden of leadership.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like to push back,</p>
<p>I feel like progress can only,</p>
<p>like most difficult decisions, just like you said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a lot of divisiveness over,</p>
<p>especially in a passionate community.</p>
<p>It just feels like leaders need to take</p>
<p>those risky decisions that if you like listen,</p>
<p>that with some nonzero probability,</p>
<p>maybe even a high probability would be the wrong decision.</p>
<p>But they have to use their gut and make that decision.</p>
<p>Well, this is like one of the things</p>
<p>where you see amazing founders.</p>
<p>The founders understand exactly what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>and how the company got there and are willing to say,</p>
<p>we have been doing thing X the last 20 years,</p>
<p>but today we&rsquo;re gonna do thing Y.</p>
<p>And they make a major pivot for the whole company.</p>
<p>The company lines up behind them,</p>
<p>they move and it&rsquo;s the right thing.</p>
<p>But then when the founder dies,</p>
<p>the successor doesn&rsquo;t always feel that agency</p>
<p>to be able to make those kinds of decisions.</p>
<p>Even though they&rsquo;re a CEO,</p>
<p>they could theoretically do whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two reasons for that, in my opinion,</p>
<p>or in many cases, it&rsquo;s always different.</p>
<p>But one of which is they weren&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>for all the decisions that were made.</p>
<p>And so they don&rsquo;t know the principles</p>
<p>in which those decisions were made.</p>
<p>And once the principles change,</p>
<p>you should be obligated to change what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and change direction, right?</p>
<p>And so if you don&rsquo;t know how you got to where you are,</p>
<p>it just seems like gospel</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna question it.</p>
<p>You may not understand</p>
<p>that it really is the right thing to do,</p>
<p>so you just may not see it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so brilliant.</p>
<p>I never thought of it that way.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s so much higher burden</p>
<p>when as a leader you step into a thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already worked for a long time.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, and if you change it and it doesn&rsquo;t work out,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re the person who screwed it up.</p>
<p>People always second guess it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the second thing is that</p>
<p>even if you decide to make a change,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re theoretically in charge,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just a person that thinks they&rsquo;re in charge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you have to motivate the troops.</p>
<p>You have to explain it to them</p>
<p>in terms they&rsquo;ll understand.</p>
<p>You have to get them to buy into it and believe in it,</p>
<p>because if they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re not gonna be able to make the turn</p>
<p>even if you tell them their bonuses are gonna be curtailed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not gonna like buy into it, you know?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s only so much power you have as a leader,</p>
<p>and you have to understand what those limitations are.</p>
<p>Are you still BDFL?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a BDFL of some stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very heavy on the B,</p>
<p>the benevolent, benevolent dictator for life.</p>
<p>I guess LLVM?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I still lead the LLVM world.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the role of,</p>
<p>so then on Swift you said that there&rsquo;s a group of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you contrast Python with Swift, right,</p>
<p>one of the reasons,</p>
<p>so everybody on the core team takes the role</p>
<p>really seriously, and I think we all really care</p>
<p>about where Swift goes,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re almost delegating the final decision making</p>
<p>to the wisdom of the group,</p>
<p>and so it doesn&rsquo;t become personal.</p>
<p>And also, when you&rsquo;re talking with the community,</p>
<p>so yeah, some people are very annoyed</p>
<p>as certain decisions get made.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain faith in the process,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very transparent process,</p>
<p>and when a decision gets made,</p>
<p>a full rationale is provided, things like this.</p>
<p>These are almost defense mechanisms</p>
<p>to help both guide future discussions</p>
<p>and provide case law, kind of like Supreme Court does</p>
<p>about this decision was made for this reason,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the rationale</p>
<p>and what we want to see more of or less of.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a way to provide a defense mechanism,</p>
<p>so that when somebody&rsquo;s griping about it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not saying that person did the wrong thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying, well, this thing sucks,</p>
<p>and later they move on and they get over it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the analogy of the Supreme Court,</p>
<p>I think, is really good.</p>
<p>But then, okay, not to get personal on the SWIFT team,</p>
<p>but it just seems like it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>for division not to emerge.</p>
<p>Well, each of the humans on the SWIFT Core Team,</p>
<p>for example, are different,</p>
<p>and the membership of the SWIFT Core Team</p>
<p>changes slowly over time, which is, I think, a healthy thing.</p>
<p>And so each of these different humans</p>
<p>have different opinions.</p>
<p>Trust me, it&rsquo;s not a singular consciousness</p>
<p>by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got three major organizations,</p>
<p>including Apple, Google, and SciFive,</p>
<p>all kind of working together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a small group of people, but you need high trust.</p>
<p>You need, again, it comes back to the principles</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve</p>
<p>and understanding what you&rsquo;re optimizing for.</p>
<p>And I think that starting with strong principles</p>
<p>and working towards decisions</p>
<p>is always a good way to both make wise decisions in general</p>
<p>but then be able to communicate them to people</p>
<p>so that they can buy into them.</p>
<p>And that is hard.</p>
<p>And so you mentioned LLVM.</p>
<p>LLVM is gonna be 20 years old this December,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s showing its own age.</p>
<p>Do you have like a dragon cake plan?</p>
<p>No, I should definitely do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, if we can have a pandemic cake.</p>
<p>Pandemic cake.</p>
<p>Everybody gets a slice of cake</p>
<p>and it gets sent through email.</p>
<p>But LLVM has had tons of its own challenges</p>
<p>over time too, right?</p>
<p>And one of the challenges that the LLVM community has,</p>
<p>in my opinion, is that it has a whole bunch of people</p>
<p>that have been working on LLVM for 10 years, right?</p>
<p>Because this happens somehow.</p>
<p>And LLVM has always been one way,</p>
<p>but it needs to be a different way, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve worked on it for like 10 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long time to work on something.</p>
<p>And you suddenly can&rsquo;t see the faults</p>
<p>in the thing that you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>And LLVM has lots of problems and we need to address them</p>
<p>and we need to make it better.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t make it better,</p>
<p>then somebody else will come up with a better idea, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just kind of of that age</p>
<p>where the community is like in danger</p>
<p>of getting too calcified.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m happy to see new projects joining</p>
<p>and new things mixing it up.</p>
<p>Fortran is now a new thing in the LLVM community,</p>
<p>which is hilarious and good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to find, on a little tangent,</p>
<p>find people who program in Cobalt or Fortran,</p>
<p>Fortran especially, to talk to, they&rsquo;re hard to find.</p>
<p>Yeah, look to the scientific community.</p>
<p>They still use Fortran quite a bit.</p>
<p>Well, interesting thing you kind of mentioned with LLVM,</p>
<p>or just in general, that as something evolves,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not able to see the faults.</p>
<p>So do you fall in love with the thing over time?</p>
<p>Or do you start hating everything</p>
<p>about the thing over time?</p>
<p>Well, so my personal folly is that I see,</p>
<p>maybe not all, but many of the faults,</p>
<p>and they grate on me, and I don&rsquo;t have time to go fix them.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they get magnified over time.</p>
<p>Well, and they may not get magnified,</p>
<p>but they never get fixed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like sand underneath,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s just like grating against you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like sand underneath your fingernails or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, you know it&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get rid of it.</p>
<p>And so the problem is that if other people don&rsquo;t see it,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t have time to go write the code</p>
<p>and fix it anymore,</p>
<p>but then people are resistant to change.</p>
<p>And so you say, hey, we should go fix this thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh yeah, that sounds risky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, is it the right thing or not?</p>
<p>Are the challenges the group dynamics,</p>
<p>or is it also just technical?</p>
<p>I mean, some of these features like,</p>
<p>I think as an observer, it&rsquo;s almost like a fan</p>
<p>in the, you know, as a spectator of the whole thing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t often think about, you know,</p>
<p>some things might actually be</p>
<p>technically difficult to implement.</p>
<p>An example of this is we built this new compiler framework</p>
<p>called MLIR.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MLIR is a whole new framework.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, many people think it&rsquo;s about machine learning.</p>
<p>The ML stands for multi level</p>
<p>because compiler people can&rsquo;t name things very well,</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>Do we dig into what MLIR is?</p>
<p>Yeah, so when you look at compilers,</p>
<p>compilers have historically been solutions for a given space.</p>
<p>So LLVM is a, it&rsquo;s really good for dealing with CPUs,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say, at a high level.</p>
<p>You look at Java, Java has a JVM.</p>
<p>The JVM is very good for garbage collected languages</p>
<p>that need dynamic compilation,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very optimized for a specific space.</p>
<p>And so hotspot is one of the compilers</p>
<p>that gets used in that space,</p>
<p>and that compiler is really good at that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Usually when you build these domain specific compilers,</p>
<p>you end up building the whole thing from scratch</p>
<p>for each domain.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a domain?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the scope of a domain?</p>
<p>Well, so here I would say, like, if you look at Swift,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several different parts to the Swift compiler,</p>
<p>one of which is covered by the LLVM part of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a high level piece that&rsquo;s specific to Swift,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a huge amount of redundancy</p>
<p>between those two different infrastructures</p>
<p>and a lot of re implemented stuff</p>
<p>that is similar but different.</p>
<p>What does LLVM define?</p>
<p>LLVM is effectively an infrastructure.</p>
<p>So you can mix and match it in different ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built out of libraries.</p>
<p>You can use it for different things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really good at CPUs and GPUs.</p>
<p>CPUs and like the tip of the iceberg on GPUs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really great at GPUs.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But it turns out. A bunch of languages that.</p>
<p>That then use it to talk to CPUs.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And so it turns out there&rsquo;s a lot of hardware out there</p>
<p>that is custom accelerators.</p>
<p>So machine learning, for example.</p>
<p>There are a lot of matrix multiply accelerators</p>
<p>and things like this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole world of hardware synthesis.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re using MLIR to build circuits.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re compiling for a domain of transistors.</p>
<p>And so what MLIR does is it provides</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of compiler infrastructure</p>
<p>that allows you to build these domain specific compilers</p>
<p>in a much faster way and have the result be good.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re thinking about the future,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re talking about like ASICs.</p>
<p>So anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So if we project into the future,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible that the number of these kinds of ASICs,</p>
<p>very specific infrastructure architecture things</p>
<p>like multiplies exponentially.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s MLIR.</p>
<p>So what MLIR does is it allows you</p>
<p>to build these compilers very efficiently.</p>
<p>Right now, one of the things that coming back</p>
<p>to the LLVM thing, and then we&rsquo;ll go to hardware,</p>
<p>is LLVM is a specific compiler for a specific domain.</p>
<p>MLIR is now this very general, very flexible thing</p>
<p>that can solve lots of different kinds of problems.</p>
<p>So LLVM is a subset of what MLIR does.</p>
<p>So MLIR is, I mean, it&rsquo;s an ambitious project then.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a very ambitious project, yeah.</p>
<p>And so to make it even more confusing,</p>
<p>MLIR has joined the LLVM Umbrella Project.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s part of the LLVM family.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But where this comes full circle is now folks</p>
<p>that work on the LLVM part,</p>
<p>the classic part that&rsquo;s 20 years old,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t aware of all the cool new things</p>
<p>that have been done in the new thing,</p>
<p>that MLIR was built by me and many other people</p>
<p>that knew a lot about LLVM,</p>
<p>and so we fixed a lot of the mistakes that lived in LLVM.</p>
<p>And so now you have this community dynamic</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, well, there&rsquo;s this new thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not familiar, nobody knows it,</p>
<p>it feels like it&rsquo;s new, and so let&rsquo;s not trust it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just really interesting</p>
<p>to see the cultural social dynamic that comes out of that.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s super healthy</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re seeing the ideas percolate</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re seeing the technology diffusion happen</p>
<p>as people get more comfortable with it,</p>
<p>they start to understand things in their own terms.</p>
<p>And this just gets to the,</p>
<p>it takes a while for ideas to propagate,</p>
<p>even though they may be very different</p>
<p>than what people are used to.</p>
<p>So maybe let&rsquo;s talk about that a little bit,</p>
<p>the world of Asics.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, you have a new role at SciFive.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that place about?</p>
<p>What is the vision for their vision</p>
<p>for, I would say, the future of computer?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I lead the engineering and product teams at SciFive.</p>
<p>SciFive is a company who was founded</p>
<p>with this architecture called RISC5.</p>
<p>RISC5 is a new instruction set.</p>
<p>Instruction sets are the things inside of your computer</p>
<p>that tell it how to run things.</p>
<p>X86 from Intel and ARM from the ARM company</p>
<p>and things like this are other instruction sets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to Dave Patterson,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s super excited about RISC5.</p>
<p>Dave is awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s brilliant, yeah.</p>
<p>The RISC5 is distinguished by not being proprietary.</p>
<p>And so X86 can only be made by Intel and AMD.</p>
<p>ARM can only be made by ARM.</p>
<p>They sell licenses to build ARM chips to other companies,</p>
<p>things like this.</p>
<p>MIPS is another instruction set</p>
<p>that is owned by the MIPS company, now Wave.</p>
<p>And then it gets licensed out, things like that.</p>
<p>And so RISC5 is an open standard</p>
<p>that anybody can build chips for.</p>
<p>And so SciFive was founded by three of the founders</p>
<p>of RISC5 that designed and built it in Berkeley,</p>
<p>working with Dave.</p>
<p>And so that was the genesis of the company.</p>
<p>SciFive today has some of the world&rsquo;s best RISC5 cores</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re selling them and that&rsquo;s really great.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to tons of products, it&rsquo;s very exciting.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re taking this thing that&rsquo;s open source</p>
<p>and just trying to be or are the best in the world</p>
<p>at building these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, so here it&rsquo;s the specifications open source.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying TCP IP is an open standard</p>
<p>or C is an open standard,</p>
<p>but then you have to build an implementation</p>
<p>of the standard.</p>
<p>And so SciFive, on the one hand, pushes forward</p>
<p>and defined and pushes forward the standard.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have implementations</p>
<p>that are best in class for different points in the space,</p>
<p>depending on if you want a really tiny CPU</p>
<p>or if you want a really big, beefy one that is faster,</p>
<p>but it uses more area and things like this.</p>
<p>What about the actual manufacturer chips?</p>
<p>So like, where does that all fit?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask a bunch of dumb questions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay, this is how we learn, right?</p>
<p>And so the way this works is that there&rsquo;s generally</p>
<p>a separation of the people who designed the circuits</p>
<p>and then people who manufacture them.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll hear about fabs like TSMC and Samsung</p>
<p>and things like this that actually produce the chips,</p>
<p>but they take a design coming in</p>
<p>and that design specifies how the,</p>
<p>you turn code for the chip into little rectangles</p>
<p>that then use photolithography to make mask sets</p>
<p>and then burn transistors onto a chip</p>
<p>or onto a, onto silicon rather.</p>
<p>So, and we&rsquo;re talking about mass manufacturing, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re talking about making hundreds of millions</p>
<p>of parts and things like that, yeah.</p>
<p>And so the fab handles the volume production,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>But when you look at this problem,</p>
<p>the interesting thing about the space when you look at it</p>
<p>is that these, the steps that you go from designing a chip</p>
<p>and writing the quote unquote code for it</p>
<p>and things like Verilog and languages like that,</p>
<p>down to what you hand off to the fab</p>
<p>is a really well studied, really old problem, okay?</p>
<p>Tons of people have worked on it.</p>
<p>Lots of smart people have built systems and tools.</p>
<p>These tools then have generally gone through acquisitions.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve ended up at three different major companies</p>
<p>that build and sell these tools.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called the EDA tools</p>
<p>like for electronic design automation.</p>
<p>The problem with this is you have huge amounts</p>
<p>of fragmentation, you have loose standards</p>
<p>and the tools don&rsquo;t really work together.</p>
<p>So you have tons of duct tape</p>
<p>and you have tons of loss productivity.</p>
<p>Now these are, these are tools for designing.</p>
<p>So the RISC 5 is a instruction.</p>
<p>Like what is RISC 5?</p>
<p>Like how deep does it go?</p>
<p>How much does it touch the hardware?</p>
<p>How much does it define how much of the hardware is?</p>
<p>Yeah, so RISC 5 is all about given a CPU.</p>
<p>So the processor and your computer,</p>
<p>how does the compiler like Swift compiler,</p>
<p>the C compiler, things like this, how does it make it work?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, what is the assembly code?</p>
<p>And so you write RISC 5 assembly</p>
<p>instead of XA6 assembly, for example.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a set of instructions</p>
<p>as opposed to instructions.</p>
<p>Why do you say it tells you how the compiler works?</p>
<p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s what the compiler talks to.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah.</p>
<p>And then the tooling you mentioned</p>
<p>that the disparate tools are for what?</p>
<p>For when you&rsquo;re building a specific chip.</p>
<p>So RISC 5. In hardware.</p>
<p>In hardware, yeah.</p>
<p>So RISC 5, you can buy a RISC 5 core from SciFive</p>
<p>and say, hey, I want to have a certain number of,</p>
<p>run a certain number of gigahertz.</p>
<p>I want it to be this big.</p>
<p>I want it to be, have these features.</p>
<p>I want to have like, I want floating point or not,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>And then what you get is you get a description</p>
<p>of a CPU with those characteristics.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to make a chip,</p>
<p>you want to build like an iPhone chip</p>
<p>or something like that, right?</p>
<p>You have to take both the CPU,</p>
<p>but then you have to talk to memory.</p>
<p>You have to have timers, IOs, a GPU, other components.</p>
<p>And so you need to pull all those things together</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s called an ASIC,</p>
<p>an Application Specific Integrated Circuit.</p>
<p>So a custom chip.</p>
<p>And then you take that design</p>
<p>and then you have to transform it into something</p>
<p>that the fabs, like TSMC, for example,</p>
<p>know how to take to production.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So, but yeah, okay.</p>
<p>And so that process, I will,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but see it as, is a big compiler.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole bunch of compilers written</p>
<p>without thinking about it through that lens.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the universe a compiler?</p>
<p>Yeah, compilers do two things.</p>
<p>They represent things and transform them.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of things that end up being compilers.</p>
<p>But this is a space where we&rsquo;re talking about design</p>
<p>and usability and the way you think about things,</p>
<p>the way things compose correctly, it matters a lot.</p>
<p>And so SciFi is investing a lot into that space.</p>
<p>And we think that there&rsquo;s a lot of benefit</p>
<p>that can be made by allowing people to design chips faster,</p>
<p>get them to market quicker and scale out</p>
<p>because at the alleged end of Moore&rsquo;s law,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this problem of you&rsquo;re not getting</p>
<p>free performance just by waiting another year</p>
<p>for a faster CPU.</p>
<p>And so you have to find performance in other ways.</p>
<p>And one of the ways to do that is with custom accelerators</p>
<p>and other things and hardware.</p>
<p>And so, well, we&rsquo;ll talk a little more about ASICs,</p>
<p>but do you see that a lot of people,</p>
<p>a lot of companies will try to have</p>
<p>different sets of requirements</p>
<p>that this whole process to go for?</p>
<p>So like almost different car companies might use different</p>
<p>and like different PC manufacturers.</p>
<p>So is RISC 5 in this whole process,</p>
<p>is it potentially the future of all computing devices?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that, so if you look at RISC 5</p>
<p>and step back from the Silicon side of things,</p>
<p>RISC 5 is an open standard.</p>
<p>And one of the things that has happened</p>
<p>over the course of decades,</p>
<p>if you look over the long arc of computing,</p>
<p>somehow became decades old.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that you have companies that come and go</p>
<p>and you have instruction sets that come and go.</p>
<p>Like one example of this out of many is Sun with Spark.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s on one way.</p>
<p>Spark still lives on at Fujitsu,</p>
<p>but we have HP had this instruction set called PA RISC.</p>
<p>So PA RISC was this big server business</p>
<p>and had tons of customers.</p>
<p>They decided to move to this architecture</p>
<p>called Itanium from Intel.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t work out so well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, and so you have this issue of</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making many billion dollar investments</p>
<p>on instruction sets that are owned by a company.</p>
<p>And even companies as big as Intel</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t always execute as well as they could.</p>
<p>They even have their own issues.</p>
<p>HP, for example, decided that it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>in their best interest to continue investing in the space</p>
<p>because it was very expensive.</p>
<p>And so they make technology decisions</p>
<p>or they make their own business decisions.</p>
<p>And this means that as a customer, what do you do?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve sunk all this time, all this engineering,</p>
<p>all this software work, all these,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve built other products around them</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re stuck, right?</p>
<p>What RISC 5 does is provide you more optionality</p>
<p>in the space because if you buy an implementation</p>
<p>of RISC 5 from SciFive, and you should,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the best ones.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But if something bad happens to SciFive in 20 years, right?</p>
<p>Well, great, you can turn around</p>
<p>and buy a RISC 5 core from somebody else.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an ecosystem of people</p>
<p>that are all making different RISC 5 cores</p>
<p>with different trade offs, which means that</p>
<p>if you have more than one requirement,</p>
<p>if you have a family of products,</p>
<p>you can probably find something in the RISC 5 space</p>
<p>that fits your needs.</p>
<p>Whereas with, if you&rsquo;re talking about XA6, for example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Intel&rsquo;s only gonna bother</p>
<p>to make certain classes of devices, right?</p>
<p>I see, so maybe a weird question,</p>
<p>but like if SciFive is like infinitely successful</p>
<p>in the next 20, 30 years, what does the world look like?</p>
<p>So like how does the world of computing change?</p>
<p>So too much diversity in hardware instruction sets,</p>
<p>I think is bad.</p>
<p>Like we have a lot of people that are using</p>
<p>lots of different instruction sets,</p>
<p>particularly in the embedded,</p>
<p>the like very tiny microcontroller space,</p>
<p>the thing in your toaster that are just weird</p>
<p>and different for historical reasons.</p>
<p>And so the compilers and the tool chains</p>
<p>and the languages on top of them aren&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>And so the developers for that software</p>
<p>have to use really weird tools</p>
<p>because the ecosystem that supports is not big enough.</p>
<p>So I expect that will change, right?</p>
<p>People will have better tools and better languages,</p>
<p>better features everywhere</p>
<p>that then can serve as many different points in the space.</p>
<p>And I think RISC5 will progressively</p>
<p>eat more of the ecosystem because it can scale up,</p>
<p>it can scale down, sideways, left, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very flexible and very well considered</p>
<p>and well designed instruction set.</p>
<p>I think when you look at SciFive tackling silicon</p>
<p>and how people build chips,</p>
<p>which is a very different space,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you say,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll see a lot more custom chips.</p>
<p>And that means that you get much more battery life,</p>
<p>you get better tuned solutions for your IoT thingy.</p>
<p>You get people that move faster,</p>
<p>you get the ability to have faster time to market,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>So how many custom&hellip;</p>
<p>So first of all, on the IoT side of things,</p>
<p>do you see the number of smart toasters</p>
<p>increasing exponentially?</p>
<p>So, and if you do,</p>
<p>like how much customization per toaster is there?</p>
<p>Do all toasters in the world run the same silicon,</p>
<p>like the same design,</p>
<p>or is it different companies have different design?</p>
<p>Like how much customization is possible here?</p>
<p>Well, a lot of it comes down to cost, right?</p>
<p>And so the way that chips work is you end up paying by the&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the factors is the size of the chip.</p>
<p>And so what ends up happening</p>
<p>just from an economic perspective is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only so many chips that get made in a year</p>
<p>of a given design.</p>
<p>And so often what customers end up having to do</p>
<p>is they end up having to pick up a chip that exists</p>
<p>that was built for somebody else</p>
<p>so that they can then ship their product.</p>
<p>And the reason for that</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t have the volume of the iPhone.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t afford to build a custom chip.</p>
<p>However, what that means is they&rsquo;re now buying</p>
<p>an off the shelf chip that isn&rsquo;t really good,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a perfect fit for their needs.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re paying a lot of money for it</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re buying silicon that they&rsquo;re not using.</p>
<p>Well, if you now reduce the cost of designing the chip,</p>
<p>now you get a lot more chips.</p>
<p>And the more you reduce it,</p>
<p>the easier it is to design chips.</p>
<p>The more the world keeps evolving</p>
<p>and we get more AI accelerators,</p>
<p>we get more other things,</p>
<p>we get more standards to talk to,</p>
<p>we get 6G, right?</p>
<p>You get changes in the world</p>
<p>that you wanna be able to talk to these different things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more diversity in the cross product of features</p>
<p>that people want.</p>
<p>And that drives differentiated chips</p>
<p>in another direction.</p>
<p>And so nobody really knows what the future looks like,</p>
<p>but I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of silicon in the future.</p>
<p>Speaking of the future,</p>
<p>you said Moore&rsquo;s law allegedly is dead.</p>
<p>So do you agree with Dave Patterson and many folks</p>
<p>that Moore&rsquo;s law is dead?</p>
<p>Or do you agree with Jim Keller,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s standing at the helm of the pirate ship</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s still alive?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, so I agree with what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>and different people are interpreting</p>
<p>the end of Moore&rsquo;s law in different ways.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Jim would say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another thousand X left in physics</p>
<p>and we can continue to squeeze the stone</p>
<p>and make it faster and smaller and smaller geometries</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So Jim is absolutely right</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a ton of progress left</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not at the limit of physics yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really what Moore&rsquo;s law is though.</p>
<p>If you look at what Moore&rsquo;s law is,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a very simple evaluation of,</p>
<p>okay, well you look at the cost per,</p>
<p>I think it was cost per area</p>
<p>and the most economic point in that space.</p>
<p>And if you go look at the now quite old paper</p>
<p>that describes this,</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s law has a specific economic aspect to it</p>
<p>and I think this is something</p>
<p>that Dave and others often point out.</p>
<p>And so on a technicality, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I look at it from,</p>
<p>so I can acknowledge both of those viewpoints.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a third wrong viewpoint</p>
<p>that may be right in its own way,</p>
<p>which is single threaded performance</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t improve like it used to.</p>
<p>And it used to be back when you got a,</p>
<p>you know, a Pentium 66 or something</p>
<p>and the year before you had a Pentium 33</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s twice as fast, right?</p>
<p>Well, it was twice as fast at doing exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>Okay, like literally the same program ran twice as fast.</p>
<p>You just wrote a check and waited a year, year and a half.</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s what a lot of people think about Moore&rsquo;s law</p>
<p>and I think that is dead.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re seeing instead is we&rsquo;re pushing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re pushing people to write software in different ways.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re pushing people to write CUDA</p>
<p>so they can get GPU compute</p>
<p>and the thousands of cores on GPU.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about C programmers having to use P threads</p>
<p>because they now have, you know,</p>
<p>a hundred threads or 50 cores in a machine</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now talking about machine learning accelerators</p>
<p>that are now domain specific.</p>
<p>And when you look at these kinds of use cases,</p>
<p>you can still get performance</p>
<p>and Jim will come up with cool things</p>
<p>that utilize the silicon in new ways for sure,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also gonna change the programming model.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And now when you start talking about changing</p>
<p>the programming model,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you come back to languages</p>
<p>and things like this too,</p>
<p>because often what you see is like you take</p>
<p>the C programming language, right?</p>
<p>The C programming language is designed for CPUs.</p>
<p>And so if you want to talk to a GPU,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re talking to its cousin CUDA, okay?</p>
<p>CUDA is a different thing with a different set of tools,</p>
<p>a different world, a different way of thinking.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have one world that scales.</p>
<p>And I think that we can get there.</p>
<p>We can have one world that scales in a much better way.</p>
<p>And a small tangent then,</p>
<p>I think most programming languages are designed for CPUs,</p>
<p>for single core, even just in their spirit,</p>
<p>even if they allow for parallelization.</p>
<p>So what does it look like for a programming language</p>
<p>to have parallelization or massive parallelization</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s like first principle?</p>
<p>So the canonical example of this</p>
<p>is the hardware design world.</p>
<p>So Verilog, VHDL, these kinds of languages,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re what&rsquo;s called a high level synthesis language.</p>
<p>This is the thing people design chips in.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re designing a chip,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a brain where you have infinite parallelism.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re like laying down transistors.</p>
<p>Transistors are always running, okay?</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re not saying run this transistor,</p>
<p>then this transistor, then this transistor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your brain,</p>
<p>like your neurons are always just doing something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not clocked, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just doing their thing.</p>
<p>And so when you design a chip or when you design a CPU,</p>
<p>when you design a GPU, when you design,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re laying down the transistors,</p>
<p>similarly, you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>well, okay, well, how do these things communicate?</p>
<p>And so these languages exist.</p>
<p>Verilog is a kind of mixed example of that.</p>
<p>None of these languages are really great.</p>
<p>You have a very low level, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re very low level</p>
<p>and abstraction is necessary here.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different approaches with that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s itself a very complicated world,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s implicitly parallel.</p>
<p>And so having that as the domain that you program towards</p>
<p>makes it so that by default, you get parallel systems.</p>
<p>If you look at CUDA,</p>
<p>CUDA is a point halfway in the space where in CUDA,</p>
<p>when you write a CUDA kernel for your GPU,</p>
<p>it feels like you&rsquo;re writing a scalar program.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like, you have ifs, you have for loops,</p>
<p>stuff like this, you&rsquo;re just writing normal code.</p>
<p>But what happens outside of that in your driver</p>
<p>is that it actually is running you</p>
<p>on like a thousand things at once, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s parallel,</p>
<p>but it has pulled it out of the programming model.</p>
<p>And so now you as a programmer are working in a simpler world</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s solved that for you, right?</p>
<p>How do you take the language like Swift?</p>
<p>If we think about GPUs, but also ASICs,</p>
<p>maybe if we can dance back and forth</p>
<p>between hardware and software.</p>
<p>How do you design for these features</p>
<p>to be able to program and get a first class citizen</p>
<p>to be able to do like Swift for TensorFlow</p>
<p>to be able to do machine learning on current hardware,</p>
<p>but also future hardware like TPUs</p>
<p>and all kinds of ASICs</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sure will be popping up more and more.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so a lot of this comes down</p>
<p>to this whole idea of having the nuts and bolts</p>
<p>underneath the covers that work really well.</p>
<p>So you need, if you&rsquo;re talking to TPUs,</p>
<p>you need MLIR or XLA or one of these compilers</p>
<p>that talks to TPUs to build on top of, okay?</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re talking to circuits,</p>
<p>you need to figure out how to lay down the transistors</p>
<p>and how to organize it and how to set up clocking</p>
<p>and like all the domain problems</p>
<p>that you get with circuits.</p>
<p>Then you have to decide how to explain it to a human.</p>
<p>What is ZY, right?</p>
<p>And if you do it right, that&rsquo;s a library problem,</p>
<p>not a language problem.</p>
<p>And that works if you have a library or a language</p>
<p>which allows your library to write things</p>
<p>that feel native in the language by implementing libraries,</p>
<p>because then you can innovate in programming models</p>
<p>without having to change your syntax again.</p>
<p>Like you have to invent new code formatting tools</p>
<p>and like all the other things that languages come with.</p>
<p>And this gets really interesting.</p>
<p>And so if you look at the space,</p>
<p>the interesting thing once you separate out syntax</p>
<p>becomes what is that programming model?</p>
<p>And so do you want the CUDA style?</p>
<p>I write one program and it runs many places.</p>
<p>Do you want the implicitly parallel model?</p>
<p>How do you reason about that?</p>
<p>How do you give developers, chip architects,</p>
<p>the ability to express their intent?</p>
<p>And that comes into this whole design question</p>
<p>of how do you detect bugs quickly?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to tape out a chip</p>
<p>to find out it&rsquo;s wrong, ideally, right?</p>
<p>How do you, and this is a spectrum,</p>
<p>how do you make it so that people feel productive?</p>
<p>So their turnaround time is very quick.</p>
<p>All these things are really hard problems.</p>
<p>And in this world, I think that not a lot of effort</p>
<p>has been put into that design problem</p>
<p>and thinking about the layering in other pieces.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve, on the topic of concurrency,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written the Swift concurrency manifest.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Anything that has the word manifest on it</p>
<p>is very interesting.</p>
<p>Can you summarize the key ideas of each of the five parts</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written about?</p>
<p>So what is a manifesto?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>How about, we start there.</p>
<p>So in the Swift community, we have this problem,</p>
<p>which is on the one hand,</p>
<p>you wanna have relatively small proposals</p>
<p>that you can kind of fit in your head,</p>
<p>you can understand the details at a very fine grain level</p>
<p>that move the world forward.</p>
<p>But then you also have these big arcs, okay?</p>
<p>And often when you&rsquo;re working on something</p>
<p>that is a big arc, but you&rsquo;re tackling it in small pieces,</p>
<p>you have this question of,</p>
<p>how do I know I&rsquo;m not doing a random walk?</p>
<p>Where are we going?</p>
<p>How does this add up?</p>
<p>Furthermore, when you start the first small step,</p>
<p>what terminology do you use?</p>
<p>How do we think about it?</p>
<p>What is better and worse in the space?</p>
<p>What are the principles?</p>
<p>What are we trying to achieve?</p>
<p>And so what a manifesto in the Swift community does</p>
<p>is it starts to say,</p>
<p>hey, well, let&rsquo;s step back from the details of everything.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s paint a broad picture to talk about</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give an example design point.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to paint the big picture</p>
<p>so that then we can zero in on the individual steps</p>
<p>and make sure that we&rsquo;re making good progress.</p>
<p>And so the Swift concurrency manifesto</p>
<p>is something I wrote three years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while, maybe more.</p>
<p>Trying to do that for Swift and concurrency.</p>
<p>It starts with some fairly simple things</p>
<p>like making the observation that</p>
<p>when you have multiple different computers</p>
<p>and multiple different threads that are communicating,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s best for them to be asynchronous.</p>
<p>And so you need things to be able to run separately</p>
<p>and then communicate with each other.</p>
<p>And this means asynchrony.</p>
<p>And this means that you need a way</p>
<p>to modeling asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>Many languages have features like this.</p>
<p>Async await is a popular one.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what I think is very likely in Swift.</p>
<p>But as you start building this tower of abstractions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about how do you write this,</p>
<p>you then reach into the how do you get memory safety</p>
<p>because you want correctness,</p>
<p>you want debuggability and sanity for developers.</p>
<p>And how do you get that memory safety into the language?</p>
<p>So if you take a language like Go or C</p>
<p>or any of these languages,</p>
<p>you get what&rsquo;s called a race condition</p>
<p>when two different threads or Go routines or whatever</p>
<p>touch the same point in memory, right?</p>
<p>This is a huge like maddening problem to debug</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not reproducible generally.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s tools,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole ecosystem of solutions</p>
<p>that built up around this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a huge problem</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re writing concurrent code.</p>
<p>And so with Swift,</p>
<p>this whole value semantics thing is really powerful there</p>
<p>because it turns out that math and copies actually work</p>
<p>even in concurrent worlds.</p>
<p>And so you get a lot of safety just out of the box,</p>
<p>but there are also some hard problems.</p>
<p>And it talks about some of that.</p>
<p>When you start building up to the next level up</p>
<p>and you start talking beyond memory safety,</p>
<p>you have to talk about what is the programmer model?</p>
<p>How does a human think about this?</p>
<p>So a developer that&rsquo;s trying to build a program</p>
<p>think about this,</p>
<p>and it proposes a really old model with a new spin</p>
<p>called Actors.</p>
<p>Actors are about saying,</p>
<p>we have islands of single threadedness logically.</p>
<p>So you write something that feels like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one program running in a unit,</p>
<p>and then it communicates asynchronously with other things.</p>
<p>And so making that expressive and natural feel good</p>
<p>be the first thing you reach for and being safe by default</p>
<p>is a big part of the design of that proposal.</p>
<p>When you start going beyond that,</p>
<p>now you start to say, cool,</p>
<p>well, these things that communicate asynchronously,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to share memory.</p>
<p>Well, if they don&rsquo;t have to share memory</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re sending messages to each other,</p>
<p>why do they have to be in the same process?</p>
<p>These things should be able to be in different processes</p>
<p>on your machine.</p>
<p>And why just processes?</p>
<p>Well, why not different machines?</p>
<p>And so now you have a very nice gradual transition</p>
<p>towards distributed programming.</p>
<p>And of course, when you start talking about the big future,</p>
<p>the manifesto doesn&rsquo;t go into it,</p>
<p>but accelerators are things you talk to asynchronously</p>
<p>by sending messages to them.</p>
<p>And how do you program those?</p>
<p>Well, that gets very interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not in the proposal.</p>
<p>And how much do you wanna make that explicit</p>
<p>like the control of that whole process</p>
<p>explicit to the program?</p>
<p>Yeah, good question.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re designing any of these kinds of features</p>
<p>or language features or even libraries,</p>
<p>you have this really hard trade off you have to make,</p>
<p>which is how much is it magic</p>
<p>or how much is it in the human&rsquo;s control?</p>
<p>How much can they predict and control it?</p>
<p>What do you do when the default case is the wrong case?</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re designing a system,</p>
<p>and so when you&rsquo;re designing a system, I won&rsquo;t name names,</p>
<p>but there are systems where it&rsquo;s really easy to get started</p>
<p>and then you jump.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s pick like logo.</p>
<p>Okay, so something like this.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really easy to get started.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really designed for teaching kids,</p>
<p>but as you get into it, you hit a ceiling</p>
<p>and then you can&rsquo;t go any higher.</p>
<p>And then what do you do?</p>
<p>Well, you have to go switch to a different world</p>
<p>and rewrite all your code.</p>
<p>And this logo is a silly example here.</p>
<p>This exists in many other languages.</p>
<p>With Python, you would say like concurrency, right?</p>
<p>So Python has the global interpreter block.</p>
<p>So threading is challenging in Python.</p>
<p>And so if you start writing a large scale application</p>
<p>in Python, and then suddenly you need concurrency,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of stuck with a series of bad trade offs, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other ways to go where you say like,</p>
<p>foist all the complexity on the user all at once, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also bad in a different way.</p>
<p>And so what I prefer is building a simple model</p>
<p>that you can explain that then has an escape hatch.</p>
<p>So you get in, you have guardrails,</p>
<p>memory safety works like this in Swift,</p>
<p>where you can start with, like by default,</p>
<p>if you use all the standard things, it&rsquo;s memory safe,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna shoot your foot off.</p>
<p>But if you wanna get a C level pointer to something,</p>
<p>you can explicitly do that.</p>
<p>But by default, there&rsquo;s guardrails.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s guardrails.</p>
<p>Okay, so but like, whose job is it to figure out</p>
<p>which part of the code is parallelizable?</p>
<p>So in the case of the proposal, it is the human&rsquo;s job.</p>
<p>So they decide how to architect their application.</p>
<p>And then the runtime in the compiler is very predictable.</p>
<p>And so this is in contrast to like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a long body of work, including on Fortran</p>
<p>for auto parallelizing compilers.</p>
<p>And this is an example of a bad thing in my,</p>
<p>so as a compiler person, I can drag on compiler people.</p>
<p>Often compiler people will say,</p>
<p>cool, since I can&rsquo;t change the code,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna write my compiler that then takes</p>
<p>this unmodified code and makes go way faster on this machine.</p>
<p>Okay, application, and so it does pattern matching.</p>
<p>It does like really deep analysis.</p>
<p>Compiler people are really smart.</p>
<p>And so they like wanna like do something</p>
<p>really clever and tricky.</p>
<p>And you get like 10X speed up by taking</p>
<p>like an array of structures and turn it</p>
<p>into a structure of arrays or something,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so much better for memory.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s bodies, like tons of tricks.</p>
<p>They love optimization.</p>
<p>Yeah, you love optimization.</p>
<p>Everyone loves optimization.</p>
<p>Everyone loves it.</p>
<p>Well, and it&rsquo;s this promise of build with my compiler</p>
<p>and your thing goes fast, right?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem, Lex, you write a program,</p>
<p>you run it with my compiler, it goes fast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very happy.</p>
<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s so much faster than the other compiler.</p>
<p>Then you go and you add a feature to your program</p>
<p>or you refactor some code.</p>
<p>And suddenly you got a 10X loss in performance.</p>
<p>Well, why?</p>
<p>What just happened there?</p>
<p>What just happened there is the heuristic,</p>
<p>the pattern matching, the compiler,</p>
<p>whatever analysis it was doing just got defeated</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t inline a function or something, right?</p>
<p>As a user, you don&rsquo;t know, you don&rsquo;t wanna know.</p>
<p>That was the whole point.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna know how the compiler works.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna know how the memory hierarchy works.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna know how it got parallelized</p>
<p>across all these things.</p>
<p>You wanted that abstracted away from you,</p>
<p>but then the magic is lost as soon as you did something</p>
<p>and you fall off a performance cliff.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re in this funny position</p>
<p>where what do I do?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t change my code.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fix that bug.</p>
<p>It costs 10X performance.</p>
<p>Now what do I do?</p>
<p>Well, this is the problem with unpredictable performance.</p>
<p>If you care about performance,</p>
<p>predictability is a very important thing.</p>
<p>And so what the proposal does is it provides</p>
<p>architectural patterns for being able to lay out your code,</p>
<p>gives you full control over that,</p>
<p>makes it really simple so you can explain it.</p>
<p>And then if you wanna scale out in different ways,</p>
<p>you have full control over that.</p>
<p>So in your sense, the intuition is for a compiler,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too hard to do automated parallelization.</p>
<p>Cause the compilers do stuff automatically</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredibly impressive for other things,</p>
<p>but for parallelization, we&rsquo;re not close to there.</p>
<p>Well, it depends on the programming model.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s many different kinds of compilers.</p>
<p>And so if you talk about like a C compiler</p>
<p>or Swift compiler or something like that,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re writing imperative code,</p>
<p>parallelizing that and reasoning about all the pointers</p>
<p>and stuff like that is a very difficult problem.</p>
<p>Now, if you switch domains,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s this cool thing called machine learning, right?</p>
<p>So machine learning nerds among other endearing things</p>
<p>like solving cat detectors and other things like that</p>
<p>have done this amazing breakthrough</p>
<p>of producing a programming model,</p>
<p>operations that you compose together</p>
<p>that has raised levels of abstraction high enough</p>
<p>that suddenly you can have auto parallelizing compilers.</p>
<p>You can write a model using a TensorFlow</p>
<p>and have it run on 1024 nodes of a TPU.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even think about like,</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s so much flexibility</p>
<p>in the design of architectures that ultimately boil down</p>
<p>to a graph that&rsquo;s parallelized for you.</p>
<p>And if you think about it, that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty cool, yeah.</p>
<p>And you think about batching, for example,</p>
<p>as a way of being able to exploit more parallelism.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a very simple thing that now is very powerful.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t come out of the programming language nerds,</p>
<p>those people, like that came out of people</p>
<p>that are just looking to solve a problem</p>
<p>and use a few GPUs and organically developed</p>
<p>by the community of people focusing on machine learning.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an incredibly powerful abstraction layer</p>
<p>that enables the compiler people to go and exploit that.</p>
<p>And now you can drive supercomputers from Python.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So just to pause on that,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m not sufficiently low level,</p>
<p>I forget to admire the beauty and power of that,</p>
<p>but maybe just to linger on it,</p>
<p>like what does it take to run a neural network fast?</p>
<p>Like how hard is that compilation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>So we just skipped,</p>
<p>you said like, it&rsquo;s amazing that that&rsquo;s a thing,</p>
<p>but yeah, how hard is that of a thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard and I would say that not all of the systems</p>
<p>are really great, including the ones I helped build.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of work left to be done there.</p>
<p>Is it the compiler nerds working on that</p>
<p>or is it a whole new group of people?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a full stack problem,</p>
<p>including compiler people, including APIs,</p>
<p>so like Keras and the module API and PyTorch and Jax.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of people pushing</p>
<p>on all the different parts of these things,</p>
<p>because when you look at it as it&rsquo;s both,</p>
<p>how do I express the computation?</p>
<p>Do I stack up layers?</p>
<p>Well, cool, like setting up a linear sequence of layers</p>
<p>is great for the simple case,</p>
<p>but how do I do the hard case?</p>
<p>How do I do reinforcement learning?</p>
<p>Well, now I need to integrate my application logic in this.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s the next level down of,</p>
<p>how do you represent that for the runtime?</p>
<p>How do you get hardware abstraction?</p>
<p>And then you get to the next level down of saying like,</p>
<p>forget about abstraction,</p>
<p>how do I get the peak performance out of my TPU</p>
<p>or my iPhone accelerator or whatever, right?</p>
<p>And all these different things.</p>
<p>And so this is a layered problem</p>
<p>with a lot of really interesting design and work</p>
<p>going on in the space</p>
<p>and a lot of really smart people working on it.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a very well funded area</p>
<p>of investment right now.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of progress being made.</p>
<p>So how much innovation is there on the lower level,</p>
<p>so closer to the ASIC,</p>
<p>so redesigning the hardware</p>
<p>or redesigning concurrently compilers with that hardware?</p>
<p>Is that like, if you were to predict the biggest,</p>
<p>the equivalent of Moore&rsquo;s law improvements</p>
<p>in the inference and the training of neural networks</p>
<p>and just all of that,</p>
<p>where is that gonna come from, you think?</p>
<p>Sure, you get scalability of different things.</p>
<p>And so you get Jim Keller shrinking process technology,</p>
<p>you get three nanometer instead of five or seven or 10</p>
<p>or 28 or whatever.</p>
<p>And so that marches forward and that provides improvements.</p>
<p>You get architectural level performance.</p>
<p>And so the TPU with a matrix multiply unit</p>
<p>and a systolic array is much more efficient</p>
<p>than having a scalar core doing multiplies and adds</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>You then get system level improvements.</p>
<p>So how you talk to memory,</p>
<p>how you talk across a cluster of machines,</p>
<p>how you scale out,</p>
<p>how you have fast interconnects between machines.</p>
<p>You then get system level programming models.</p>
<p>So now that you have all this hardware, how to utilize it.</p>
<p>You then have algorithmic breakthroughs where you say,</p>
<p>hey, wow, cool.</p>
<p>Instead of training in a resonant 50 in a week,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now training it in 25 seconds.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a combination of new optimizers</p>
<p>and new just training regimens</p>
<p>and different approaches to train.</p>
<p>And all of these things come together</p>
<p>to push the world forward.</p>
<p>That was a beautiful exposition.</p>
<p>But if you were to force to bet all your money</p>
<p>on one of these.</p>
<p>Why do we have to?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have people working on all this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exciting time, right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, OpenAI did this little paper</p>
<p>showing the algorithmic improvement you can get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been improving exponentially.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t quite seen the same kind of analysis</p>
<p>on other layers of the stack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s also improving significantly.</p>
<p>I just, it&rsquo;s a nice intuition builder.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a reason why Moore&rsquo;s Law,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the beauty of Moore&rsquo;s Law is</p>
<p>somebody writes a paper that makes a ridiculous prediction.</p>
<p>And it becomes reality in a sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about these narratives</p>
<p>when you, when Chris Ladner on a silly little podcast</p>
<p>makes, bets all his money on a particular thing,</p>
<p>somehow it can have a ripple effect</p>
<p>of actually becoming real.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting aspect of it.</p>
<p>Cause like it might&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>we focus with Moore&rsquo;s Law,</p>
<p>most of the computing industry</p>
<p>really, really focused on the hardware.</p>
<p>I mean, software innovation,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much software innovation</p>
<p>there was in terms of efficient.</p>
<p>What Intel Giveth Bill takes away, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, compilers improved significantly also.</p>
<p>Well, not really.</p>
<p>So actually, I mean, so I&rsquo;m joking</p>
<p>about how software has gotten slower</p>
<p>pretty much as fast as hardware got better,</p>
<p>at least through the nineties.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another joke, another law in compilers,</p>
<p>which is called, I think it&rsquo;s called Probstine&rsquo;s Law,</p>
<p>which is compilers double the performance</p>
<p>of any given code every 18 years.</p>
<p>So they move slowly.</p>
<p>Yeah, also.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it&rsquo;s exponential also.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re making progress,</p>
<p>but there again, it&rsquo;s not about,</p>
<p>the power of compilers is not just about</p>
<p>how do you make the same thing go faster?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how do you unlock the new hardware?</p>
<p>A new chip came out, how do you utilize it?</p>
<p>You say, oh, the programming model,</p>
<p>how do we make people more productive?</p>
<p>How do we have better error messages?</p>
<p>Even such mundane things like how do I generate</p>
<p>a very specific error message about your code</p>
<p>actually makes people happy</p>
<p>because then they know how to fix it, right?</p>
<p>And it comes back to how do you help people</p>
<p>get their job done.</p>
<p>Yeah, and yeah, and then in this world</p>
<p>of exponentially increasing smart toasters,</p>
<p>how do you expand computing to all these kinds of devices?</p>
<p>Do you see this world where just everything</p>
<p>is a computing surface?</p>
<p>You see that possibility?</p>
<p>Just everything is a computer?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t see any reason</p>
<p>that that couldn&rsquo;t be achieved.</p>
<p>It turns out that sand goes into glass</p>
<p>and glass is pretty useful too.</p>
<p>And why not?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>So very important question then,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re living in a simulation</p>
<p>and the simulation is running a computer,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s the architecture of that computer, do you think?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying is it a quantum system?</p>
<p>Yeah, like this whole quantum discussion, is it needed?</p>
<p>Or can we run it with a RISC 5 architecture,</p>
<p>a bunch of CPUs?</p>
<p>I think it comes down to the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the compiler?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, that&rsquo;s my question.</p>
<p>Did I get that job?</p>
<p>Feed the universe compiler.</p>
<p>And so there, as far as we know,</p>
<p>quantum systems are the bottom of the pile of turtles</p>
<p>so far.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t know efficient ways</p>
<p>to implement quantum systems without using quantum computers.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s totally outside</p>
<p>of everything we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>But who runs that quantum computer?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, so if we really are living in a simulation,</p>
<p>then is it bigger quantum computers?</p>
<p>Is it different ones?</p>
<p>Like how does that work out?</p>
<p>How does that scale?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the same size.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same size.</p>
<p>But then the thought of the simulation</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t have to run the whole thing,</p>
<p>that we humans are cognitively very limited.</p>
<p>We do checkpoints.</p>
<p>We do checkpoints, yeah.</p>
<p>And if we, the point at which we human,</p>
<p>so you basically do minimal amount of,</p>
<p>what is it, Swift does on right, copy on right.</p>
<p>So you only adjust the simulation.</p>
<p>Parallel universe theories, right?</p>
<p>And so every time a decision&rsquo;s made,</p>
<p>somebody opens the short end of your box,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a fork.</p>
<p>And then this could happen.</p>
<p>And then, thank you for considering the possibility.</p>
<p>But yeah, so it may not require the entirety</p>
<p>of the universe to simulate it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting to think about</p>
<p>as we create this higher and higher fidelity systems.</p>
<p>But I do wanna ask on the quantum computer side,</p>
<p>because everything we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>whether you work with SciFive, with compilers,</p>
<p>none of that includes quantum computers, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So have you ever thought about this whole</p>
<p>serious engineering work of quantum computers</p>
<p>looks like of compilers, of architectures,</p>
<p>all of that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve looked at it a little bit.</p>
<p>I know almost nothing about it,</p>
<p>which means that at some point,</p>
<p>I will have to find an excuse to get involved,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>But do you think that&rsquo;s a thing to be,</p>
<p>like with your little tingly senses of the timing</p>
<p>of when to be involved, is it not yet?</p>
<p>Well, so the thing I do really well</p>
<p>is I jump into messy systems</p>
<p>and figure out how to make them,</p>
<p>figure out what the truth in the situation is,</p>
<p>try to figure out what the unifying theory is,</p>
<p>how to like factor the complexity,</p>
<p>how to find a beautiful answer to a problem</p>
<p>that has been well studied</p>
<p>and lots of people have bashed their heads against it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that quantum computers are mature enough</p>
<p>and accessible enough to be figured out yet, right?</p>
<p>And I think the open question with quantum computers is,</p>
<p>is there a useful problem</p>
<p>that gets solved with a quantum computer</p>
<p>that makes it worth the economic cost</p>
<p>of like having one of these things</p>
<p>and having legions of people that set it up?</p>
<p>You go back to the fifties, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the projections</p>
<p>of the world will only need seven computers, right?</p>
<p>Well, and part of that was that people hadn&rsquo;t figured out</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re useful for.</p>
<p>What are the algorithms we wanna run?</p>
<p>What are the problems that get solved?</p>
<p>And this comes back to how do we make the world better,</p>
<p>either economically or making somebody&rsquo;s life better</p>
<p>or like solving a problem that wasn&rsquo;t solved before,</p>
<p>things like this.</p>
<p>And I think that just we&rsquo;re a little bit too early</p>
<p>in that development cycle</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s still like literally a science project,</p>
<p>not a negative connotation, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally a science project</p>
<p>and the progress there is amazing.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s 10 years away,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s two years away,</p>
<p>exactly where that breakthrough happens,</p>
<p>but you look at machine learning,</p>
<p>we went through a few winners</p>
<p>before the AlexNet transition</p>
<p>and then suddenly it had its breakout moment.</p>
<p>And that was the catalyst</p>
<p>that then drove the talent flocking into it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what drove the economic applications of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what drove the technology to go faster</p>
<p>because you now have more minds thrown at the problem.</p>
<p>This is what caused like a serious knee in deep learning</p>
<p>and the algorithms that we&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s what quantum needs to go through.</p>
<p>And so right now it&rsquo;s in that formidable finding itself,</p>
<p>getting the like literally the physics figured out.</p>
<p>And then it has to figure out the application</p>
<p>that makes this useful.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&rsquo;m not skeptical that I think that will happen.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just 10 years away, something like that.</p>
<p>I forgot to ask,</p>
<p>what programming language do you think</p>
<p>the simulation is written in?</p>
<p>Ooh, probably Lisp.</p>
<p>So not Swift.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re a Tibet, I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>So, I mean, we&rsquo;ve mentioned that you worked</p>
<p>with all these companies,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about all these projects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like if we just step back and zoom out</p>
<p>about the way you did that work.</p>
<p>And we look at COVID times,</p>
<p>this pandemic we&rsquo;re living through that may,</p>
<p>if I look at the way Silicon Valley folks</p>
<p>are talking about it, the way MIT is talking about it,</p>
<p>this might last for a long time.</p>
<p>Not just the virus, but the remote nature.</p>
<p>The economic impact.</p>
<p>I mean, all of it, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna be a mess.</p>
<p>Do you think, what&rsquo;s your prediction?</p>
<p>I mean, from sci fi to Google,</p>
<p>to just all the places you worked in,</p>
<p>just Silicon Valley, you&rsquo;re in the middle of it.</p>
<p>What do you think is,</p>
<p>how is this whole place gonna change?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I mean, I really can only speak</p>
<p>to the tech perspective.</p>
<p>I am in that bubble.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be really interesting</p>
<p>because the Zoom culture of being remote</p>
<p>and on video chat all the time</p>
<p>has really interesting effects on people.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, it&rsquo;s a great normalizer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a normalizer that I think will help communities</p>
<p>of people that have traditionally been underrepresented</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;re taking, in some cases, a face off</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have to have a camera going, right?</p>
<p>And so you can have conversations</p>
<p>without physical appearance being part of the dynamic,</p>
<p>which is pretty powerful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking remote employees</p>
<p>that have already been remote,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re now on the same level</p>
<p>and footing as everybody else.</p>
<p>Nobody gets whiteboards.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be the one person</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t get to be participating</p>
<p>in the whiteboard conversation,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s pretty powerful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got, you&rsquo;re forcing people to think asynchronously</p>
<p>in some cases because it&rsquo;s harder to just get people</p>
<p>physically together, and the bumping into each other</p>
<p>forces people to find new ways to solve those problems.</p>
<p>And I think that that leads to more inclusive behavior,</p>
<p>which is good.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s also, it just sucks, right?</p>
<p>And so the actual communication just sucks</p>
<p>being not with people on a daily basis</p>
<p>and collaborating with them.</p>
<p>Yeah, all of that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, everything, this whole situation is terrible.</p>
<p>What I meant primarily was the,</p>
<p>I think that most humans</p>
<p>like working physically with humans.</p>
<p>I think this is something that not everybody,</p>
<p>but many people are programmed to do.</p>
<p>And I think that we get something out of that</p>
<p>that is very hard to express, at least for me.</p>
<p>And so maybe this isn&rsquo;t true of everybody.</p>
<p>But, and so the question to me is,</p>
<p>when you get through that time of adaptation,</p>
<p>you get out of March and April,</p>
<p>and you get into December,</p>
<p>you get into next March, if it&rsquo;s not changed, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already terrifying.</p>
<p>Well, you think about that,</p>
<p>and you think about what is the nature of work?</p>
<p>And how do we adapt?</p>
<p>And humans are very adaptable species, right?</p>
<p>We can learn things when we&rsquo;re forced to,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a catalyst to make that happen.</p>
<p>And so what is it that comes out of this,</p>
<p>and are we better or worse off?</p>
<p>I think that you look at the Bay Area,</p>
<p>housing prices are insane.</p>
<p>Well, why?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a high incentive to be physically located,</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t have proximity,</p>
<p>you end up paying for it and commute, right?</p>
<p>And there has been huge social pressure</p>
<p>in terms of you will be there for the meeting, right?</p>
<p>Or whatever scenario it is.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s gonna be way better.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be much more the norm</p>
<p>to have remote employees,</p>
<p>and I think this is gonna be really great.</p>
<p>Do you have friends, or do you hear of people moving?</p>
<p>I know one family friend that moved.</p>
<p>They moved back to Michigan,</p>
<p>and they were a family with three kids</p>
<p>living in a small apartment,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going insane, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re in tech, husband works for Google.</p>
<p>So first of all, friends of mine</p>
<p>are in the process of, or have already lost the business.</p>
<p>The thing that represents their passion, their dream,</p>
<p>it could be small entrepreneurial projects,</p>
<p>but it could be large businesses,</p>
<p>like people that run gyms.</p>
<p>Restaurants, tons of things, yeah.</p>
<p>But also, people look at themselves in the mirror</p>
<p>and ask the question of, what do I wanna do in life?</p>
<p>For some reason, they haven&rsquo;t done it until COVID.</p>
<p>They really ask that question,</p>
<p>and that results often in moving or leaving the company</p>
<p>with starting your own business</p>
<p>or transitioning to a different company.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re gonna see that a lot?</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t speak to that.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re definitely gonna see it</p>
<p>at a higher frequency than we did before,</p>
<p>just because I think what you&rsquo;re trying to say</p>
<p>is there are decisions that you make yourself,</p>
<p>big life decisions that you make yourself,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna quit my job and start a new thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also decisions that get made for you.</p>
<p>I got fired from my job, what am I gonna do, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a decision that you think about,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re forced to act, okay?</p>
<p>And so I think that those, you&rsquo;re forced to act</p>
<p>kind of moments where global pandemic</p>
<p>comes and wipes out the economy,</p>
<p>and now your business doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I think that does lead to more reflection, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re less anchored on what you have,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a, what do I have to lose</p>
<p>versus what do I have to gain, A, B, comparison.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a fresh slate.</p>
<p>Cool, I could do anything now.</p>
<p>Do I wanna do the same thing I was doing?</p>
<p>Did that make me happy?</p>
<p>Is this now time to go back to college</p>
<p>and take a class and learn a new skill?</p>
<p>Is this a time to spend time with family</p>
<p>if you can afford to do that?</p>
<p>Is this time to literally move in with parents, right?</p>
<p>I mean, all these things that were not normative before</p>
<p>suddenly become, I think, very, the value systems change.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually a good thing</p>
<p>in the short term, at least, because it leads to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of been an overoptimization</p>
<p>along one set of priorities for the world,</p>
<p>and now maybe we&rsquo;ll get to a more balanced</p>
<p>and more interesting world</p>
<p>where people are doing different things.</p>
<p>I think it could be good.</p>
<p>I think there could be more innovation</p>
<p>that comes out of it, for example.</p>
<p>What do you think about all the social chaos</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the middle of?</p>
<p>It sucks.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s, let me ask you a whole,</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s all gonna be okay?</p>
<p>Well, I think humanity will survive.</p>
<p>The, from an existential,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re not all gonna kill, yeah, well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think the virus is gonna kill all the humans.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think all the humans are gonna kill all the humans.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s unlikely.</p>
<p>But I look at it as progress requires a catalyst, right?</p>
<p>So you need a reason for people to be willing</p>
<p>to do things that are uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I think that the US, at least,</p>
<p>but I think the world in general</p>
<p>is a pretty unoptimal place to live in for a lot of people.</p>
<p>And I think that what we&rsquo;re seeing right now</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of unhappiness.</p>
<p>And because of all the pressure,</p>
<p>because of all the badness in the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really kind of igniting some of that debate</p>
<p>that should have happened a long time ago, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that we&rsquo;ll see more progress.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking about, offline you&rsquo;re asking about politics</p>
<p>and wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if politics moved faster</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s all these problems in the world</p>
<p>and we can move it.</p>
<p>Well, people are intentionally, are inherently conservative.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re talking about conservative people,</p>
<p>particularly if they have heavy burdens on their shoulders</p>
<p>because they represent literally thousands of people,</p>
<p>it makes sense to be conservative.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, when you need change,</p>
<p>how do you get it?</p>
<p>The global pandemic will probably lead to some change.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a directed, it&rsquo;s not a directed plan,</p>
<p>but I think that it leads to people</p>
<p>asking really interesting questions.</p>
<p>And some of those questions</p>
<p>should have been asked a long time ago.</p>
<p>Well, let me know if you&rsquo;ve observed this as well.</p>
<p>Something that&rsquo;s bothered me in the machine learning</p>
<p>community, I&rsquo;m guessing it might be prevalent</p>
<p>in other places, is something that feels like in 2020</p>
<p>increase the level of toxicity.</p>
<p>Like people are just quicker to pile on,</p>
<p>to just be, they&rsquo;re just harsh on each other,</p>
<p>to like mob, pick a person that screwed up</p>
<p>and like make it a big thing.</p>
<p>And is there something that we can like,</p>
<p>yeah, have you observed that in other places?</p>
<p>Is there some way out of this?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an inherent thing in humanity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of an us versus them thing,</p>
<p>which is that you wanna succeed and how do you succeed?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s relative to somebody else.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s happening in, at least in some part</p>
<p>is that with the internet and with online communication,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s getting smaller, right?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re having some of the social ties</p>
<p>of like my town versus your town&rsquo;s football team, right?</p>
<p>Turn into much larger and yet shallower problems.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t have time, the incentives,</p>
<p>the clickbait and like all these things</p>
<p>kind of really feed into this machine.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know where that goes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the reason I think about that,</p>
<p>I mentioned to you this offline a little bit,</p>
<p>but I have a few difficult conversations scheduled,</p>
<p>some of them political related,</p>
<p>some of them within the community,</p>
<p>difficult personalities that went through some stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, one of them I&rsquo;ve talked before,</p>
<p>I will talk again is Yann LeCun.</p>
<p>He got a little bit of crap on Twitter</p>
<p>for talking about a particular paper</p>
<p>and the bias within a data set.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s been a huge, in my view,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m willing, comfortable saying it,</p>
<p>irrational, over exaggerated pile on his comments</p>
<p>because he made pretty basic comments about the fact that</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s bias in the data,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be bias in the results.</p>
<p>So we should not have bias in the data,</p>
<p>but people piled on to him because he said</p>
<p>he trivialized the problem of bias.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a lot more than just bias in the data,</p>
<p>but like, yes, that&rsquo;s a very good point,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what he was saying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what he was saying.</p>
<p>And the response, like the implied response</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s basically sexist and racist</p>
<p>is something that completely drives away</p>
<p>the possibility of nuanced discussion.</p>
<p>One nice thing about like a pocket long form of conversation</p>
<p>is you can talk it out.</p>
<p>You can lay your reasoning out.</p>
<p>And even if you&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>you can still show that you&rsquo;re a good human being</p>
<p>underneath it.</p>
<p>You know, your point about</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have a productive discussion.</p>
<p>Well, how do you get to the point where people can turn?</p>
<p>They can learn, they can listen, they can think,</p>
<p>they can engage versus just being a shallow like,</p>
<p>and then keep moving, right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that progress really comes from that,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that one should expect that.</p>
<p>I think that you&rsquo;d see that as reinforcing</p>
<p>individual circles and the us versus them thing.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s fairly divisive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s a big role in,</p>
<p>like the people that bother me most on Twitter</p>
<p>when I observe things is not the people</p>
<p>who get very emotional, angry, like over the top.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the people who like prop them up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the, it&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>I think what should be the,</p>
<p>we should teach each other is to be sort of empathetic.</p>
<p>The thing that it&rsquo;s really easy to forget,</p>
<p>particularly on like Twitter or the internet or an email,</p>
<p>is that sometimes people just have a bad day, right?</p>
<p>You have a bad day or you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the situation where it&rsquo;s like between meetings,</p>
<p>like fire off a quick response to an email</p>
<p>because I want to like help get something unblocked,</p>
<p>phrase it really objectively wrong.</p>
<p>I screwed up.</p>
<p>And suddenly this is now something that sticks with people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;re bad.</p>
<p>Just psychology of like, you said a thing,</p>
<p>it sticks with you.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t mean it that way,</p>
<p>but it really impacted somebody</p>
<p>because the way they interpret it.</p>
<p>And this is just an aspect of working together as humans.</p>
<p>And I have a lot of optimism in the long term,</p>
<p>the very long term about what we as humanity can do.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just always a rough ride.</p>
<p>And you came into this by saying like,</p>
<p>what does COVID and all the social strife</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening right now mean?</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s really bad in the short term,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;ll lead to progress.</p>
<p>And for that, I&rsquo;m very thankful.</p>
<p>Yeah, painful in the short term though.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, people are out of jobs.</p>
<p>Like some people can&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>And, but you know, it&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>I mean, the real question is when you look back 10 years,</p>
<p>20 years, a hundred years from now,</p>
<p>how do we evaluate the decisions are being made right now?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really the way you can frame that</p>
<p>and look at it.</p>
<p>And you say, you know,</p>
<p>you integrate across all the short term horribleness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening and you look at what that means</p>
<p>and is the improvement across the world</p>
<p>or the regression across the world significant enough</p>
<p>to make it a good or a bad thing?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And for that, it&rsquo;s good to study history.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the big problems for me right now</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>Light reading?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s everything is just,</p>
<p>I just see parallels and it means it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you have to be really careful not to overstep it,</p>
<p>but just the thing that worries me the most</p>
<p>is the pain that people feel when a few things combine,</p>
<p>which is like economic depression,</p>
<p>which is quite possible in this country.</p>
<p>And then just being disrespected in some kind of way,</p>
<p>which the German people were really disrespected</p>
<p>by most of the world, like in a way that&rsquo;s over the top,</p>
<p>that something can build up</p>
<p>and then all you need is a charismatic leader</p>
<p>to go either positive or negative and both work</p>
<p>as long as they&rsquo;re charismatic.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking advantage of, again,</p>
<p>that inflection point that the world&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>and what they do with it could be good or bad.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a good way to think about times now,</p>
<p>like on an individual level,</p>
<p>what we decide to do is when history is written,</p>
<p>30 years from now, what happened in 2020,</p>
<p>probably history is gonna remember 2020.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Either for good or bad,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s up to us to write it so it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things I&rsquo;ve observed</p>
<p>that I find fascinating is most people act</p>
<p>as though the world doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>You make decision knowingly, right?</p>
<p>You make a decision where you&rsquo;re predicting the future</p>
<p>based on what you&rsquo;ve seen in the recent past.</p>
<p>And so if something&rsquo;s always been,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s rained every single day,</p>
<p>then of course you expect it to rain today too, right?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the world changes all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Constantly, like for better and for worse.</p>
<p>And so the question is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in something that&rsquo;s not right,</p>
<p>what is the inflection point that led to a change?</p>
<p>And you can look to history for this.</p>
<p>Like what is the catalyst that led to that explosion</p>
<p>that led to that bill that led to the,</p>
<p>like you can kind of work your way backwards from that.</p>
<p>And maybe if you pull together the right people</p>
<p>and you get the right ideas together,</p>
<p>you can actually start driving that change</p>
<p>and doing it in a way that&rsquo;s productive</p>
<p>and hurts fewer people.</p>
<p>Yeah, like a single person,</p>
<p>a single event can turn all of history.</p>
<p>Absolutely, everything starts somewhere.</p>
<p>And often it&rsquo;s a combination of multiple factors,</p>
<p>but yeah, these things can be engineered.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually the optimistic view that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a longterm optimist on pretty much everything</p>
<p>and human nature.</p>
<p>We can look to all the negative things</p>
<p>that humanity has, all the pettiness</p>
<p>and all the like self servingness</p>
<p>and the just the cruelty, right?</p>
<p>The biases, the just humans can be very horrible.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, we&rsquo;re capable of amazing things.</p>
<p>And the progress across 100 year chunks</p>
<p>is striking.</p>
<p>And even across decades, we&rsquo;ve come a long ways</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s still a long ways to go,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;ve stopped.</p>
<p>Yeah, the kind of stuff we&rsquo;ve done in the last 100 years</p>
<p>is unbelievable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of scary to think what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>in this 100 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary, like exciting.</p>
<p>Like scary in a sense that it&rsquo;s kind of sad</p>
<p>that the kind of technology is gonna come out</p>
<p>in 10, 20, 30 years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably too old to really appreciate</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t grow up with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be like kids these days with their virtual reality</p>
<p>and their TikToks and stuff like this.</p>
<p>Like, how does this thing and like,</p>
<p>come on, give me my static photo.</p>
<p>My Commodore 64.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Okay, sorry, we kind of skipped over.</p>
<p>Let me ask on, the machine learning world</p>
<p>has been kind of inspired, their imagination captivated</p>
<p>with GPT3 and these language models.</p>
<p>I thought it&rsquo;d be cool to get your opinion on it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thoughts on this exciting world of,</p>
<p>it connects to computation actually,</p>
<p>is of language models that are huge</p>
<p>and take many, many computers, not just to train,</p>
<p>but to also do inference on.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it depends on what you&rsquo;re speaking to there.</p>
<p>But I mean, I think that there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>a pretty well understood maximum in deep learning</p>
<p>that if you make the model bigger</p>
<p>and you shove more data into it,</p>
<p>assuming you train it right</p>
<p>and you have a good model architecture,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll get a better model out.</p>
<p>And so on one hand, GPT3 was not that surprising.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a tremendous amount of engineering</p>
<p>went into making it possible.</p>
<p>The implications of it are pretty huge.</p>
<p>I think that when GPT2 came out,</p>
<p>there was a very provocative blog post from OpenAI</p>
<p>talking about, we&rsquo;re not gonna release it</p>
<p>because of the social damage it could cause</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s misused.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s still a concern.</p>
<p>I think that we need to look at how technology is applied</p>
<p>and well meaning tools can be applied in very horrible ways</p>
<p>and they can have very profound impact on that.</p>
<p>I think that GPT3 is a huge technical achievement.</p>
<p>And what will GPT4 be?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;ll probably be bigger, more expensive to train.</p>
<p>Really cool architectural tricks.</p>
<p>What do you think, is there,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much thought you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>on distributed computing.</p>
<p>Is there some technical challenges that are interesting</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re hopeful about exploring</p>
<p>in terms of a system that,</p>
<p>like a piece of code that with GPT4 that might have,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, hundreds of trillions of parameters</p>
<p>which have to run on thousands of computers.</p>
<p>Is there some hope that we can make that happen?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, today you can write a check</p>
<p>and get access to a thousand TPU cores</p>
<p>and do really interesting large scale training</p>
<p>and inference and things like that in Google Cloud,</p>
<p>for example, right?</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a question about scale,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a question about utility.</p>
<p>And when I look at the transformer series of architectures</p>
<p>that the GPT series is based on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really interesting to look at that</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re actually very simple designs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not recurrent.</p>
<p>The training regimens are pretty simple.</p>
<p>And so they don&rsquo;t really reflect like human brains, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re really good at learning language models</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re unrolled enough</p>
<p>that you can simulate some recurrence, right?</p>
<p>And so the question I think about is,</p>
<p>where does this take us?</p>
<p>Like, so we can just keep scaling it,</p>
<p>have more parameters, more data, more things,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get a better result for sure.</p>
<p>But are there architectural techniques</p>
<p>that can lead to progress at a faster pace, right?</p>
<p>This is when, you know, how do you get,</p>
<p>instead of just like making it a constant time bigger,</p>
<p>how do you get like an algorithmic improvement</p>
<p>out of this, right?</p>
<p>And whether it be a new training regimen,</p>
<p>if it becomes sparse networks, for example,</p>
<p>the human brain is sparse, all these networks are dense.</p>
<p>The connectivity patterns can be very different.</p>
<p>I think this is where I get very interested</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m way out of my league</p>
<p>on the deep learning side of this.</p>
<p>But I think that could lead to big breakthroughs.</p>
<p>When you talk about large scale networks,</p>
<p>one of the things that Jeff Dean likes to talk about</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s given a few talks on</p>
<p>is this idea of having a sparsely gated mixture of experts</p>
<p>kind of a model where you have, you know,</p>
<p>different nets that are trained</p>
<p>and are really good at certain kinds of tasks.</p>
<p>And so you have this distributor across a cluster</p>
<p>and so you have a lot of different computers</p>
<p>that end up being kind of locally specialized</p>
<p>in different demands.</p>
<p>And then when a query comes in,</p>
<p>you gate it and you use learn techniques</p>
<p>to route to different parts of the network.</p>
<p>And then you utilize the compute resources</p>
<p>of the entire cluster by having specialization within it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know where that goes</p>
<p>or when it starts to work,</p>
<p>but I think things like that</p>
<p>could be really interesting as well.</p>
<p>And on the data side too,</p>
<p>if you can think of data selection</p>
<p>as a kind of programming.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, essentially, if you look at it,</p>
<p>like Karpathy talked about software 2.0,</p>
<p>I mean, in a sense, data is the program.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So let me try to summarize Andre&rsquo;s position really quick</p>
<p>before I disagree with it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Andre Karpathy is amazing.</p>
<p>So this is nothing personal with him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an amazing engineer.</p>
<p>And also a good blog post writer.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, he&rsquo;s a great communicator.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s just an amazing person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also really sweet.</p>
<p>So his basic premise is that software is suboptimal.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree to that.</p>
<p>He also points out that deep learning</p>
<p>and other learning based techniques are really great</p>
<p>because you can solve problems</p>
<p>in more structured ways with less like ad hoc code</p>
<p>that people write out and don&rsquo;t write test cases for</p>
<p>in some cases.</p>
<p>And so they don&rsquo;t even know if it works in the first place.</p>
<p>And so if you start replacing systems of imperative code</p>
<p>with deep learning models, then you get a better result.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I think that he argues that software 2.0</p>
<p>is a pervasively learned set of models</p>
<p>and you get away from writing code.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s given talks where he talks about, you know,</p>
<p>swapping over more and more and more parts of the code</p>
<p>to being learned and driven that way.</p>
<p>I think that works.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re predisposed to liking machine learning,</p>
<p>then I think that that&rsquo;s definitely a good thing.</p>
<p>I think this is also good for accessibility in many ways</p>
<p>because certain people are not gonna write C code</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>And so having a data driven approach to do</p>
<p>this kind of stuff, I think can be very valuable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are huge trade offs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear to me that software 2.0 is the answer.</p>
<p>And probably Andre wouldn&rsquo;t argue that it&rsquo;s the answer</p>
<p>for every problem either.</p>
<p>But I look at machine learning as not a replacement</p>
<p>for software 1.0.</p>
<p>I look at it as a new programming paradigm.</p>
<p>And so programming paradigms, when you look across demands,</p>
<p>is structured programming where you go from go tos</p>
<p>to if, then, else, or functional programming from Lisp.</p>
<p>And you start talking about higher order functions</p>
<p>and values and things like this.</p>
<p>Or you talk about object oriented programming.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about encapsulation,</p>
<p>subclassing, inheritance.</p>
<p>You start talking about generic programming</p>
<p>where you start talking about code reuse</p>
<p>through specialization and different type instantiations.</p>
<p>When you start talking about differentiable programming,</p>
<p>something that I am very excited about</p>
<p>in the context of machine learning,</p>
<p>talking about taking functions and generating variants,</p>
<p>like the derivative of another function.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a programming paradigm that&rsquo;s very useful</p>
<p>for solving certain classes of problems.</p>
<p>Machine learning is amazing</p>
<p>at solving certain classes of problems.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not gonna write a cat detector</p>
<p>or even a language translation system by writing C code.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a very productive way to do things anymore.</p>
<p>And so machine learning is absolutely</p>
<p>the right way to do that.</p>
<p>In fact, I would say that learned models</p>
<p>are really one of the best ways to work</p>
<p>with the human world in general.</p>
<p>And so anytime you&rsquo;re talking about sensory input</p>
<p>of different modalities,</p>
<p>anytime that you&rsquo;re talking about generating things</p>
<p>in a way that makes sense to a human,</p>
<p>I think that learned models are really, really useful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because humans are very difficult</p>
<p>to characterize, okay?</p>
<p>And so this is a very powerful paradigm</p>
<p>for solving classes of problems.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, imperative code is too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna write a bootloader for your computer</p>
<p>with a deep learning model.</p>
<p>Deep learning models are very hardware intensive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very energy intensive</p>
<p>because you have a lot of parameters</p>
<p>and you can provably implement any function</p>
<p>with a learned model, like this has been shown,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t make it efficient.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re talking about caring about a few orders</p>
<p>of magnitudes worth of energy usage,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s useful to have other tools in the toolbox.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also robustness too.</p>
<p>I mean, as a&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>All the problems of dealing with data and bias in data,</p>
<p>all the problems of software 2.0.</p>
<p>And one of the great things that Andre is arguing towards,</p>
<p>which I completely agree with him,</p>
<p>is that when you start implementing things</p>
<p>with deep learning, you need to learn from software 1.0</p>
<p>in terms of testing, continuous integration,</p>
<p>how you deploy, how do you validate,</p>
<p>all these things and building systems around that</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not just saying like,</p>
<p>oh, it seems like it&rsquo;s good, ship it, right?</p>
<p>Well, what happens when I regress something?</p>
<p>What happens when I make a classification that&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>and now I hurt somebody, right?</p>
<p>I mean, all these things you have to reason about.</p>
<p>Yeah, but at the same time,</p>
<p>the bootloader that works for us humans</p>
<p>looks awfully a lot like a neural network, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s messy and you can cut out</p>
<p>different parts of the brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of this neuroplasticity work</p>
<p>that shows that it&rsquo;s gonna adjust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting question,</p>
<p>how much of the world&rsquo;s programming</p>
<p>could be replaced by software 2.0?</p>
<p>Like with&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, well, I mean, it&rsquo;s provably true</p>
<p>that you could replace all of it.</p>
<p>Right, so then it&rsquo;s a question of the trade offs.</p>
<p>Anything that&rsquo;s a function, you can.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a question about if.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a economic question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, what kind of talent can you get?</p>
<p>What kind of trade offs in terms of maintenance, right?</p>
<p>Those kinds of questions, I think.</p>
<p>What kind of data can you collect?</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons that I&rsquo;m most interested</p>
<p>in machine learning as a programming paradigm</p>
<p>is that one of the things that we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>across computing in general is that</p>
<p>being laser focused on one paradigm</p>
<p>often puts you in a box that&rsquo;s not super great.</p>
<p>And so you look at object oriented programming,</p>
<p>like it was all the rage in the early 80s</p>
<p>and like everything has to be objects.</p>
<p>And people forgot about functional programming</p>
<p>even though it came first.</p>
<p>And then people rediscovered that,</p>
<p>hey, if you mix functional and object oriented</p>
<p>in structure, like you mix these things together,</p>
<p>you can provide very interesting tools</p>
<p>that are good at solving different problems.</p>
<p>And so the question there is how do you get</p>
<p>the best way to solve the problems?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about whose tribe should win, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about, you know, that shouldn&rsquo;t be the question.</p>
<p>The question is how do you make it</p>
<p>so that people can solve those problems the fastest</p>
<p>and they have the right tools in their box</p>
<p>to build good libraries and they can solve these problems.</p>
<p>And when you look at that, that&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>you look at reinforcement learning</p>
<p>as one really interesting subdomain of this.</p>
<p>Reinforcement learning, often you have to have</p>
<p>the integration of a learned model</p>
<p>combined with your Atari or whatever the other scenario</p>
<p>it is that you&rsquo;re working in.</p>
<p>You have to combine that thing with the robot control</p>
<p>for the arm, right?</p>
<p>And so now it&rsquo;s not just about that one paradigm,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about integrating that with all the other systems</p>
<p>that you have, including often legacy systems</p>
<p>and things like this, right?</p>
<p>And so to me, I think that the interesting thing to say</p>
<p>is like, how do you get the best out of this domain</p>
<p>and how do you enable people to achieve things</p>
<p>that they otherwise couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>without excluding all the good things</p>
<p>we already know how to do?</p>
<p>Right, but okay, this is a crazy question,</p>
<p>but we talked a little bit about GPT3,</p>
<p>but do you think it&rsquo;s possible that these language models</p>
<p>that in essence, in the language domain,</p>
<p>Software 2.0 could replace some aspect of compilation,</p>
<p>for example, or do program synthesis,</p>
<p>replace some aspect of programming?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So I think that learned models in general</p>
<p>are extremely powerful,</p>
<p>and I think that people underestimate them.</p>
<p>Maybe you can suggest what I should do.</p>
<p>So if I have access to the GPT3 API,</p>
<p>would I be able to generate Swift code, for example?</p>
<p>Do you think that could do something interesting</p>
<p>and would work?</p>
<p>So GPT3 is probably not trained on the right corpus,</p>
<p>so it probably has the ability to generate some Swift.</p>
<p>I bet it does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not gonna generate a large enough body</p>
<p>of Swift to be useful,</p>
<p>but take it a next step further.</p>
<p>Like if you had the goal of training something like GPT3</p>
<p>and you wanted to train it to generate source code, right?</p>
<p>It could definitely do that.</p>
<p>Now the question is, how do you express the intent</p>
<p>of what you want filled in?</p>
<p>You can definitely write scaffolding of code</p>
<p>and say, fill in the hole,</p>
<p>and sort of put in some for loops,</p>
<p>or put in some classes or whatever.</p>
<p>And the power of these models is impressive,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an unsolved question, at least unsolved to me,</p>
<p>which is, how do I express the intent of what to fill in?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And kind of what you&rsquo;d really want to have,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know that these models are up to the task,</p>
<p>is you wanna be able to say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the scaffolding,</p>
<p>and here are the assertions at the end.</p>
<p>And the assertions always pass.</p>
<p>And so you want a generative model on the one hand, yes.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fascinating, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, but you also want some loop back,</p>
<p>some reinforcement learning system or something,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re actually saying like,</p>
<p>I need to hill climb towards something</p>
<p>that is more correct.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that we have that.</p>
<p>So it would generate not only a bunch of the code,</p>
<p>but like the checks that do the testing.</p>
<p>It would generate the tests.</p>
<p>I think the humans would generate the tests, right?</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>But it would be fascinating if&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, the tests are the requirements.</p>
<p>Yes, but the, okay, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Because you have to express to the model</p>
<p>what you want to&hellip;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just want gibberish code.</p>
<p>Look at how compelling this code looks.</p>
<p>You want a story about four horned unicorns or something.</p>
<p>Well, okay, so exactly.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s human requirements.</p>
<p>But then I thought it&rsquo;s a compelling idea</p>
<p>that the GPT4 model could generate checks</p>
<p>that are more high fidelity that check for correctness.</p>
<p>Because the code it generates,</p>
<p>like say I ask it to generate a function</p>
<p>that gives me the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like&hellip;</p>
<p>So decompose the problem, right?</p>
<p>So you have two things.</p>
<p>You have, you need the ability to generate</p>
<p>syntactically correct Swift code that&rsquo;s interesting, right?</p>
<p>I think GPT series of model architectures can do that.</p>
<p>But then you need the ability to add the requirements.</p>
<p>So generate Fibonacci.</p>
<p>The human needs to express that goal.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that language that I know of.</p>
<p>No, I mean, it can generate stuff.</p>
<p>Have you seen what GPT3 can generate?</p>
<p>You can say, I mean, there&rsquo;s a interface stuff</p>
<p>like it can generate HTML.</p>
<p>It can generate basic for loops that give you like&hellip;</p>
<p>Right, but pick HTML.</p>
<p>How do I say I want google.com?</p>
<p>Well, no, you could say&hellip;</p>
<p>Or not literally google.com.</p>
<p>How do I say I want a webpage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got a shopping cart and this and that?</p>
<p>It does that.</p>
<p>I mean, so, okay.</p>
<p>So just, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen these demonstrations</p>
<p>but you type in, I want a red button</p>
<p>with the text that says hello.</p>
<p>And you type that in natural language</p>
<p>and it generates the correct HTML.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this demo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of compelling.</p>
<p>So you have to prompt it with similar kinds of mappings.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s probably handpicked.</p>
<p>I got to experiment that probably,</p>
<p>but the fact that you can do that once</p>
<p>even out of like 20 is quite impressive.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s very basic.</p>
<p>Like the HTML is kind of messy and bad.</p>
<p>But yes, the intent is&hellip;</p>
<p>The idea is the intent is specified in natural language.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I have not seen that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the question is the correctness of that.</p>
<p>Like visually you can check, oh, the button is red,</p>
<p>but for more complicated functions</p>
<p>where the intent is harder to check.</p>
<p>This goes into like NP completeness kind of things.</p>
<p>Like I want to know that this code is correct</p>
<p>and generates a giant thing</p>
<p>that does some kind of calculation.</p>
<p>It seems to be working.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think like,</p>
<p>should the system also try to generate checks</p>
<p>for itself for correctness?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And this is way beyond my experience.</p>
<p>The thing that I think about is that</p>
<p>there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a lot of</p>
<p>equational reasoning going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of pattern matching and filling in</p>
<p>and kind of propagating patterns</p>
<p>that have been seen before into the future</p>
<p>and into the generator result.</p>
<p>And so if you want to get correctness,</p>
<p>you kind of need theorem proving kind of things</p>
<p>and like higher level logic.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that&hellip;</p>
<p>You could talk to Jan about that</p>
<p>and see what the bright minds</p>
<p>are thinking about right now,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think the GPT is in that vein.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still really cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, and surprisingly, who knows,</p>
<p>maybe reasoning is&hellip;</p>
<p>Is overrated.</p>
<p>Yeah, is overrated.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, do we reason?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do you tell, right?</p>
<p>Are we just pattern matching based on what we have</p>
<p>and then reverse justifying to ourselves?</p>
<p>Exactly, the reverse.</p>
<p>So like I think what the neural networks are missing</p>
<p>and I think GPT4 might have</p>
<p>is to be able to tell stories to itself about what it did.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what humans do, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you talk about like network explainability, right?</p>
<p>And we give, no, that&rsquo;s a hard time about this,</p>
<p>but humans don&rsquo;t know why we make decisions.</p>
<p>We have this thing called intuition</p>
<p>and then we try to like say,</p>
<p>this feels like the right thing, but why, right?</p>
<p>And you wrestle with that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re making hard decisions</p>
<p>and is that science?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about a few high level questions, I guess.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve done a million things in your life</p>
<p>and been very successful.</p>
<p>A bunch of young folks listen to this,</p>
<p>ask for advice from successful people like you.</p>
<p>If you were to give advice to somebody,</p>
<p>you know, another graduate student</p>
<p>or some high school student</p>
<p>about pursuing a career in computing</p>
<p>or just advice about life in general,</p>
<p>is there some words of wisdom you can give them?</p>
<p>So I think you come back to change</p>
<p>and profound leaps happen</p>
<p>because people are willing to believe</p>
<p>that change is possible</p>
<p>and that the world does change</p>
<p>and are willing to do the hard thing</p>
<p>that it takes to make change happen.</p>
<p>And whether it be implementing a new programming language</p>
<p>or employing a new system</p>
<p>or employing a new research paper,</p>
<p>designing a new thing,</p>
<p>moving the world forward in science</p>
<p>and philosophy, whatever,</p>
<p>it really comes down to somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s willing to put in the work, right?</p>
<p>And you have, the work is hard</p>
<p>for a whole bunch of different reasons.</p>
<p>One of which is, it&rsquo;s work, right?</p>
<p>And so you have to have the space in your life</p>
<p>in which you can do that work,</p>
<p>which is why going to grad school</p>
<p>can be a beautiful thing for certain people.</p>
<p>But also there&rsquo;s a self doubt that happens.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re two years into a project,</p>
<p>is it going anywhere, right?</p>
<p>Well, what do you do?</p>
<p>Do you just give up because it&rsquo;s hard?</p>
<p>No, no, I mean, some people like suffering.</p>
<p>And so you plow through it.</p>
<p>The secret to me is that you have to love what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and follow that passion</p>
<p>because when you get to the hard times,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when, if you love what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re willing to kind of push through.</p>
<p>And this is really hard</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to know what you will love doing</p>
<p>until you start doing a lot of things.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I think that,</p>
<p>particularly early in your career,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to experiment.</p>
<p>Do a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>Go take the survey class on</p>
<p>the first half of every class in your upper division lessons</p>
<p>and just get exposure to things</p>
<p>because certain things will resonate with you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll find out, wow, I&rsquo;m really good at this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really smart at this.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just because it works with the way your brain.</p>
<p>And when something jumps out,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>that people often ask about is like,</p>
<p>well, I think there&rsquo;s a bunch of cool stuff out there.</p>
<p>Like how do I pick the thing?</p>
<p>Like how do you hook, in your life,</p>
<p>how did you just hook yourself in and stuck with it?</p>
<p>Well, I got lucky, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that many people forget</p>
<p>that a huge amount of it or most of it is luck, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s not forget that.</p>
<p>So for me, I fell in love with computers early on</p>
<p>because they spoke to me, I guess.</p>
<p>What language did they speak?</p>
<p>Basic.</p>
<p>Basic, yeah.</p>
<p>But then it was just kind of following</p>
<p>a set of logical progressions,</p>
<p>but also deciding that something that was hard</p>
<p>was worth doing and a lot of fun, right?</p>
<p>And so I think that that is also something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true for many other domains,</p>
<p>which is if you find something that you love doing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also hard, if you invest yourself in it</p>
<p>and add value to the world,</p>
<p>then it will mean something generally, right?</p>
<p>And again, that can be a research paper,</p>
<p>that can be a software system,</p>
<p>that can be a new robot,</p>
<p>that can be, there&rsquo;s many things that that can be,</p>
<p>but a lot of it is like real value</p>
<p>comes from doing things that are hard.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to suffer, but.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t often hear that message.</p>
<p>We talked about it last time a little bit,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one of my, not enough people talk about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful to hear a successful person.</p>
<p>Well, and self doubt and imposter syndrome,</p>
<p>these are all things that successful people</p>
<p>suffer with as well,</p>
<p>particularly when they put themselves</p>
<p>in a point of being uncomfortable,</p>
<p>which I like to do now and then</p>
<p>just because it puts you in learning mode.</p>
<p>Like if you wanna grow as a person,</p>
<p>put yourself in a room with a bunch of people</p>
<p>that know way more about whatever you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>than you do and ask dumb questions.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>Smart people love to teach often,</p>
<p>not always, but often.</p>
<p>And if you listen, if you&rsquo;re prepared to listen,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re prepared to grow,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re prepared to make connections,</p>
<p>you can do some really interesting things.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of progress is made by people</p>
<p>who kind of hop between domains now and then,</p>
<p>because they bring a perspective into a field</p>
<p>that nobody else has,</p>
<p>if people have only been working in that field themselves.</p>
<p>We mentioned that the universe is kind of like a compiler.</p>
<p>The entirety of it, the whole evolution</p>
<p>is kind of a kind of compilation.</p>
<p>Maybe us human beings are kind of compilers.</p>
<p>Let me ask the old sort of question</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t ask you last time,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>Is there a meaning?</p>
<p>Like if you asked a compiler why,</p>
<p>what would a compiler say?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m prepared for it not to mean anything.</p>
<p>Here we are, all biological things programmed to survive</p>
<p>and propagate our DNA.</p>
<p>And maybe the universe is just a computer</p>
<p>and you just go until entropy takes over the universe</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a very productive way</p>
<p>to live your life, if so.</p>
<p>And so I prefer to bias towards the other way,</p>
<p>which is saying the universe has a lot of value.</p>
<p>And I take happiness out of other people.</p>
<p>And a lot of times part of that&rsquo;s having kids,</p>
<p>but also the relationships you build with other people.</p>
<p>And so the way I try to live my life is like,</p>
<p>what can I do that has value?</p>
<p>How can I move the world forward?</p>
<p>How can I take what I&rsquo;m good at</p>
<p>and bring it into the world?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m one of these people that likes to work really hard</p>
<p>and be very focused on the things that I do.</p>
<p>And so if I&rsquo;m gonna do that,</p>
<p>how can it be in a domain that actually will matter?</p>
<p>Because a lot of things that we do,</p>
<p>we find ourselves in the cycle of like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m doing a thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very familiar with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it for a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done anything else,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not really learning, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really, I&rsquo;m keeping things going,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a younger generation</p>
<p>that can do the same thing,</p>
<p>maybe even better than me, right?</p>
<p>Maybe if I actually step out of this</p>
<p>and jump into something I&rsquo;m less comfortable with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>But on the other hand,</p>
<p>it gives somebody else a new opportunity.</p>
<p>It also then puts you back in learning mode,</p>
<p>and that can be really interesting.</p>
<p>And one of the things I&rsquo;ve learned is that</p>
<p>when you go through that,</p>
<p>that first you&rsquo;re deep into imposter syndrome,</p>
<p>but when you start working your way out,</p>
<p>you start to realize,</p>
<p>hey, well, there&rsquo;s actually a method to this.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m able to add new things</p>
<p>because I bring different perspective.</p>
<p>And this is one of the good things</p>
<p>about bringing different kinds of people together.</p>
<p>Diversity of thought is really important.</p>
<p>And if you can pull together people</p>
<p>that are coming at things from different directions,</p>
<p>you often get innovation.</p>
<p>And I love to see that, that aha moment</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, oh, we&rsquo;ve really cracked this.</p>
<p>This is something nobody&rsquo;s ever done before.</p>
<p>And then if you can do it in the context</p>
<p>where it adds value, other people can build on it,</p>
<p>it helps move the world,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s what really excites me.</p>
<p>So that kind of description</p>
<p>of the magic of the human experience,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;ll ever create that in an AGI system?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to create,</p>
<p>give AI systems a sense of meaning</p>
<p>where they operate in this kind of world</p>
<p>exactly in the way you&rsquo;ve described,</p>
<p>which is they interact with each other,</p>
<p>they interact with us humans.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>Well, so, I mean, why are you being so a speciest, right?</p>
<p>All right, so AGI versus Bionets,</p>
<p>or something like that versus biology, right?</p>
<p>You know, what are we but machines, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just programmed to run our,</p>
<p>we have our objective function</p>
<p>that we were optimized for, right?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re doing our thing,</p>
<p>we think we have purpose, but do we really, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not prepared to say that those newfangled AGI&rsquo;s</p>
<p>have no soul just because we don&rsquo;t understand them, right?</p>
<p>And I think that would be, when they exist,</p>
<p>that would be very premature to look at a new thing</p>
<p>through your own lens without fully understanding it.</p>
<p>You might be just saying that</p>
<p>because AI systems in the future</p>
<p>will be listening to this and then.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna say anything.</p>
<p>Please be nice to me, you know,</p>
<p>when Skynet kills everybody, please spare me.</p>
<p>So wise look ahead thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, I think that people will spend</p>
<p>a lot of time worrying about this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>and I think that what we should be worrying about</p>
<p>is how do we make the world better?</p>
<p>And the thing that I&rsquo;m most scared about with AGI&rsquo;s</p>
<p>is not that necessarily the Skynet</p>
<p>will start shooting everybody with lasers</p>
<p>and stuff like that to use us for our calories.</p>
<p>The thing that I&rsquo;m worried about is that</p>
<p>humanity, I think, needs a challenge.</p>
<p>And if we get into a mode of not having a personal challenge,</p>
<p>not having a personal contribution,</p>
<p>whether that be like, you know, your kids</p>
<p>and seeing what they grow into and helping guide them,</p>
<p>whether it be your community that you&rsquo;re engaged in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re driving forward, whether it be your work</p>
<p>and the things that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and the people you&rsquo;re working with</p>
<p>and the products you&rsquo;re building and the contribution there,</p>
<p>if people don&rsquo;t have a objective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid what that means.</p>
<p>And I think that this would lead to a rise</p>
<p>of the worst part of people, right?</p>
<p>Instead of people striving together</p>
<p>and trying to make the world better,</p>
<p>it could degrade into a very unpleasant world.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, we hopefully have a long ways to go</p>
<p>before we discover that.</p>
<p>And fortunately, we have pretty on the ground problems</p>
<p>with the pandemic right now,</p>
<p>and so I think we should be focused on that as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, ultimately, just as you said, you&rsquo;re optimistic.</p>
<p>I think it helps for us to be optimistic.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fake it until you make it.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and why not?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the other side, right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, I&rsquo;m not personally a very religious person,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard people say like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, of course I believe in God.</p>
<p>Of course I go to church, because if God&rsquo;s real,</p>
<p>you know, I wanna be on the right side of that.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not real, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And so, you know, that&rsquo;s a fair way to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the same thing with nuclear deterrence,</p>
<p>all, you know, global warming, all these things,</p>
<p>all these threats, natural engineer pandemics,</p>
<p>all these threats we face.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s paralyzing to be terrified</p>
<p>of all the possible ways we could destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s much better or at least productive</p>
<p>to be hopeful and to engineer defenses</p>
<p>against these things, to engineer a future</p>
<p>where like, you know, see like a positive future</p>
<p>and engineer that future.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and I think that&rsquo;s another thing</p>
<p>to think about as, you know, a human,</p>
<p>particularly if you&rsquo;re young and trying to figure out</p>
<p>what it is that you wanna be when you grow up, like I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for that.</p>
<p>The question then is, how do you wanna spend your time?</p>
<p>And right now there seems to be a norm</p>
<p>of being a consumption culture.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna watch the news and revel</p>
<p>in how horrible everything is right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go find out about the latest atrocity</p>
<p>and find out all the details of like the terrible thing</p>
<p>that happened and be outraged by it.</p>
<p>You can spend a lot of time watching TV</p>
<p>and watching the news at home or whatever</p>
<p>people watch these days, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a lot of hours, right?</p>
<p>And those are hours that if you&rsquo;re turned</p>
<p>to being productive, learning, growing,</p>
<p>experiencing, you know, when the pandemic&rsquo;s over,</p>
<p>going exploring, right, it leads to more growth.</p>
<p>And I think it leads to more optimism and happiness</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re building, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re building yourself, you&rsquo;re building your capabilities,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building your viewpoints,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building your perspective.</p>
<p>And I think that a lot of the consuming</p>
<p>of other people&rsquo;s messages leads</p>
<p>to kind of a negative viewpoint,</p>
<p>which you need to be aware of what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s also important,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a balance that I think focusing</p>
<p>on creation is a very valuable thing to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what you&rsquo;re saying is people should focus</p>
<p>on working on the sexiest field of them all,</p>
<p>which is compiler design.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Hey, you could go work on machine learning</p>
<p>and be crowded out by the thousands of graduates</p>
<p>popping out of school that all want to do the same thing,</p>
<p>or you could work in the place that people overpay you</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not enough smart people working in it.</p>
<p>And here at the end of Moore&rsquo;s Law,</p>
<p>according to some people,</p>
<p>actually the software is the hard part too.</p>
<p>I mean, optimization is truly, truly beautiful.</p>
<p>And also on the YouTube side or education side,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be nice to have some material</p>
<p>that shows the beauty of compilers.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a call for people to create</p>
<p>that kind of content as well.</p>
<p>Chris, you&rsquo;re one of my favorite people to talk to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a huge honor that you would waste your time</p>
<p>talking to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always appreciated it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>The truth of it is you spent a lot of time talking to me</p>
<p>just on walks and other things like that,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s great to catch up with.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Chris Latner.</p>
<p>So much of language design is about tradeoffs,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t see those tradeoffs</p>
<p>unless you have a community of people</p>
<p>that really represent those different points.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
