    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk about the biology,</p>
<p>psychology, and utility of play.</p>
<p>Play is something that normally we associate</p>
<p>with children&rsquo;s games, and indeed with being a child.</p>
<p>Much of our childhood development centers around play,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s organized play or spontaneous play.</p>
<p>But as adults, we also need to play.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;m going to talk about what I like to refer to</p>
<p>as the power of play.</p>
<p>The power of play resides in play&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to change our nervous system for the better</p>
<p>so that we can perform many activities,</p>
<p>not just play activities, better.</p>
<p>Play can also function as a way to explore new ways</p>
<p>of being in different scenarios,</p>
<p>in work, in relationships, in settings of all kinds,</p>
<p>and indeed also in the relationship to oneself.</p>
<p>In fact, we are going to explore</p>
<p>how assuming different identities</p>
<p>during the same game of play or the same forms of play</p>
<p>has been shown to be immensely powerful</p>
<p>for allowing people to engage in more creative thinking</p>
<p>and dynamic thinking, and indeed to become better leaders</p>
<p>and more effective workers and students and learners</p>
<p>and happier people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to cover some data that shows</p>
<p>that learning to play properly</p>
<p>can enhance one&rsquo;s ability to focus</p>
<p>and is an active area of research</p>
<p>for treatment of things like ADHD,</p>
<p>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
<p>Just as a little sneak preview of where that&rsquo;s headed,</p>
<p>children who do not access enough play</p>
<p>during certain stages of childhood</p>
<p>are more prone to develop ADHD.</p>
<p>The good news is all of us,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not we have ADHD or not,</p>
<p>whether or not we had ample access to play</p>
<p>during childhood or not,</p>
<p>can engage and grow the neural circuits</p>
<p>that allow for this incredible power of play.</p>
<p>And this can be done, again, at any stage of life.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the protocols, the science.</p>
<p>We will review all of that,</p>
<p>and I promise you&rsquo;ll come away with a lot of knowledge.</p>
<p>Whether or not you&rsquo;re a parent,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re a child,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re a person of any age,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have tools and knowledge</p>
<p>that will benefit you.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I want to share with you the results</p>
<p>of what I think to be an extremely exciting</p>
<p>and certainly an actionable study</p>
<p>that was just published in the journal Scientific Reports.</p>
<p>This is an excellent journal, Nature Press Journal,</p>
<p>peer-reviewed, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the findings center around what sorts of devices</p>
<p>we happen to be reading on and accessing information on</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s impacting our physiology</p>
<p>and our capacity to learn.</p>
<p>One of the more frequent questions I get</p>
<p>is what are all these devices, phones, tablets, computers,</p>
<p>video games, et cetera, doing to our brains?</p>
<p>And finally, there&rsquo;s some good peer-reviewed data</p>
<p>to look at that and to address it directly.</p>
<p>This study, first author Honma, H-O-N-M-A, Honma et al,</p>
<p>is entitled Reading on a Smartphone Affects Psi Generation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s S-I-G-H, Psi Generation,</p>
<p>Brain Activity and Comprehension.</p>
<p>And to just summarize what they found,</p>
<p>they ran a study on 34 healthy individuals</p>
<p>and had them either read material on a smartphone</p>
<p>or on regular printed paper or a book.</p>
<p>And what they found is that comprehension on devices,</p>
<p>in particular smartphones, is much poorer,</p>
<p>much worse than it is when one reads on actual paper.</p>
<p>Now, some of you may experience this yourselves.</p>
<p>Now, they compared smartphones with paper</p>
<p>and what they found was that</p>
<p>when they looked at people&rsquo;s breathing,</p>
<p>the normal patterns of breathing</p>
<p>that people were engaging in did not differ</p>
<p>between people reading on a smartphone</p>
<p>or reading from paper.</p>
<p>However, one particular feature of breathing did differ.</p>
<p>And that particular feature</p>
<p>is what we call physiological size.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about physiological size on this podcast</p>
<p>and on social media.</p>
<p>We had a terrific guest, Professor Jack Feldman</p>
<p>from University of California, Los Angeles,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a world expert in breathing and respiration</p>
<p>and its impacts on the brain</p>
<p>and how brain controls breathing and respiration.</p>
<p>And what you can learn from that episode,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll just tell you again right now,</p>
<p>is that every five minutes or so,</p>
<p>whether or not we are asleep or awake,</p>
<p>we do what&rsquo;s called a physiological sigh,</p>
<p>which is a big, deep inhale,</p>
<p>often a double inhale followed by a long exhale.</p>
<p>It goes something like this.</p>
<p>Now, you might think, oh, I never breathe like that,</p>
<p>but you do.</p>
<p>Unless there&rsquo;s something severely wrong</p>
<p>with your brainstem, every five minutes or so,</p>
<p>you do one of these physiological sighs,</p>
<p>which reopens all the little hundreds of millions</p>
<p>of sacs in your lungs called the alveoli</p>
<p>that bring in more oxygen as a consequence</p>
<p>of that big, deep double inhale.</p>
<p>And then you are able to exhale carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>offload carbon dioxide through that long exhale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also encouraged people</p>
<p>to use the physiological sigh deliberately,</p>
<p>not just spontaneously,</p>
<p>as a way to reduce their stress quickly.</p>
<p>And indeed, my lab works on physiological sighs</p>
<p>and has been exploring this.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re quite effective</p>
<p>in reducing our stress very fast.</p>
<p>Reading on a smartphone seems to suppress</p>
<p>physiological sighing.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t aware that it&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Some people have talked about so-called email apnea,</p>
<p>which is the fact that people hold their breath</p>
<p>while they email or while they text.</p>
<p>And indeed, many people do that.</p>
<p>This is distinct from email or texting apnea.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening here is people are reading on the phone</p>
<p>and for whatever reason,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about what the likely reason is,</p>
<p>but for whatever reason, they&rsquo;re suppressing their sighing.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, the brain is not getting enough oxygen</p>
<p>and is not offloading enough carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>And another finding in this study</p>
<p>was that the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>an area of the brain that&rsquo;s involved in focus</p>
<p>and attention and learning,</p>
<p>becomes hyperactive in a kind of desperate attempt to focus.</p>
<p>All of this can be summarized by saying,</p>
<p>if you happen to read on a device,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a tablet,</p>
<p>a standard computer screen of any kind,</p>
<p>but in particular on a smartphone,</p>
<p>regardless of how small or large that smartphone screen is,</p>
<p>you want to remind yourself to engage</p>
<p>in these physiological sighs fairly regularly.</p>
<p>And it might even be better to just read the most</p>
<p>or at least the key issues</p>
<p>and things that you&rsquo;re trying to learn</p>
<p>about the key information from paper,</p>
<p>either books or printed out material of some other sort.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the underlying mechanism here?</p>
<p>Well, one of the reasons I like this study so much</p>
<p>is that it brings together two of my laboratories</p>
<p>and my particular interests in neuroscience,</p>
<p>which is how does our visual system and the aperture,</p>
<p>meaning the size of our visual window,</p>
<p>relate to our so-called autonomic function</p>
<p>or our internal state.</p>
<p>And basically what&rsquo;s happening here</p>
<p>is as any of us bring our visual window in more narrowly,</p>
<p>as we contract our visual window,</p>
<p>which is exactly what happens</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re looking at a little smartphone in front of us,</p>
<p>it seems to suppress the breathing apparatus</p>
<p>because we know that physiological size</p>
<p>are controlled by a specific set of neurons</p>
<p>in the brainstem called the parafacial nucleus</p>
<p>discovered by Dr. Jack Feldman.</p>
<p>And so there must be a mechanism</p>
<p>whereby when we tighten our visual window,</p>
<p>we somehow, and we don&rsquo;t know yet how this happens,</p>
<p>but somehow suppress the activity of these neurons</p>
<p>in the parafacial nucleus</p>
<p>that generate this physiological size.</p>
<p>So again, you have two choices,</p>
<p>or I suppose you have many choices,</p>
<p>but two main choices to contend with this new information.</p>
<p>One is that you remind yourself to engage in deep breathing</p>
<p>and in particular physiological size</p>
<p>every five minutes or so</p>
<p>while reading anything or texting on your smartphone.</p>
<p>The other would be, again,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s material that you really need to learn</p>
<p>for sake of regurgitation later</p>
<p>or for something particularly important,</p>
<p>try and read that from either a larger screen</p>
<p>or even better would be from printed materials or books.</p>
<p>Another reason I bring all that up</p>
<p>is that it relates to a larger theme,</p>
<p>which is that I get many, many questions about ADHD</p>
<p>and about people&rsquo;s challenges with focus.</p>
<p>And much of what we&rsquo;re told these days</p>
<p>is that we are challenged with focus</p>
<p>because of the hundreds of videos</p>
<p>that we can see streaming by us in any moment on our phone,</p>
<p>which probably is true.</p>
<p>The fact that the information that we&rsquo;re reading</p>
<p>on the internet and on our phones</p>
<p>is emotionally disturbing or distressing in some way.</p>
<p>And that probably is true as well in many cases.</p>
<p>This study really points to the fact</p>
<p>that independent of the information</p>
<p>that we are looking at or consuming,</p>
<p>independent whether or not it&rsquo;s movies or texts</p>
<p>or anything of that sort,</p>
<p>the mere size of the window, the aperture,</p>
<p>the screen that we&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>is also strongly impacting our ability</p>
<p>to learn and remember information.</p>
<p>So broaden that visual window, print things out,</p>
<p>look at a book.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t design the system.</p>
<p>I always say, you know,</p>
<p>however our visual system and respiratory system</p>
<p>happened to evolve,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase.</p>
<p>This is just simply how your brain circuits work.</p>
<p>So if you want to learn things,</p>
<p>widen that visual window and even better print things out,</p>
<p>pick up a book or read on a tablet even,</p>
<p>but try and make that tablet larger</p>
<p>than a smartphone screen size.</p>
<p>Before we begin our discussion about the power of play,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about play.</p>
<p>Now, in researching this episode,</p>
<p>I thought that I was going to come across a bunch of papers</p>
<p>that say this brain area connects to that brain area,</p>
<p>which controls play in animals,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s similar areas in babies and in adults,</p>
<p>and indeed that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>and we will talk about brain circuitry.</p>
<p>But I think more importantly is to understand</p>
<p>what is the utility of play?</p>
<p>You know, why do we play when we&rsquo;re younger?</p>
<p>Why do we tend to play less as we get older?</p>
<p>And what in the world is play for?</p>
<p>Some of us would be categorized as more playful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you know people like this.</p>
<p>Maybe you are like this,</p>
<p>people that can walk into a room,</p>
<p>a social setting of any kind,</p>
<p>and they seem to already kind of have a playful,</p>
<p>maybe even a mischievous quality about them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about mischief a little bit later,</p>
<p>but they sort of look at an environment or a social setting</p>
<p>as an opportunity for different kinds of novel interactions.</p>
<p>Other people,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d probably put myself into this category,</p>
<p>if I walk into a novel environment,</p>
<p>I tend to be more in the mode of just assessing</p>
<p>what that environment is like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a particularly spontaneously playful person,</p>
<p>although around certain individuals,</p>
<p>I might be more spontaneously playful.</p>
<p>We are all on a continuum of this kind of seriousness</p>
<p>to playful nature.</p>
<p>Turns out that all young animals, including humans,</p>
<p>have more playfulness and tend to engage</p>
<p>in more spontaneous play in their earlier years</p>
<p>than in their later years.</p>
<p>And therein lies a very interesting portal</p>
<p>to understanding what the utility,</p>
<p>what the purpose of play is.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>I want to lay down a couple of key facts about play</p>
<p>that point to the fact that play is not just about games.</p>
<p>Play is about much, much more.</p>
<p>And play, and in particular, how we played as a child,</p>
<p>and still how we can play as adults,</p>
<p>is really how we test and expand our potential roles</p>
<p>in all kinds of interactions.</p>
<p>One of the most important, interesting,</p>
<p>and surprising features of play</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like everyone to know about</p>
<p>is that it is homeostatically regulated.</p>
<p>Some of you are familiar with the term homeostasis.</p>
<p>Homeostasis is just this aspect of biological systems</p>
<p>that tend to try and remain in balance.</p>
<p>You know, if you stay awake for a long period of time,</p>
<p>you tend to want to sleep for a long period of time.</p>
<p>If you slept for a long period of time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re very rested,</p>
<p>then you tend to be very energetic the next day.</p>
<p>And of course I know people out there will immediately say,</p>
<p>oh, well, if I sleep too long,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m groggy the next day.</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions.</p>
<p>But in general,</p>
<p>sleep and wakefulness are in homeostatic balance.</p>
<p>Thirst and water consumption are in homeostatic balance.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t drink any fluids for a while,</p>
<p>you tend to get more thirsty.</p>
<p>You drink fluids and your thirst tends to diminish.</p>
<p>Likewise with food,</p>
<p>likewise with most all motivated behaviors.</p>
<p>Well, one of the most important discoveries</p>
<p>of the last century</p>
<p>was largely the work of a guy named Jaak Pengsepp.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not Jack, it&rsquo;s Jaak Pengsepp,</p>
<p>who really pioneered this understanding</p>
<p>of the biology of play</p>
<p>and relating that to the psychology of play</p>
<p>in animals and humans.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s considered a kind of luminary in the field of play.</p>
<p>And what a great title to have, right?</p>
<p>If you could have a title and be a scientific luminary,</p>
<p>you might as well be the play guy.</p>
<p>In fact, he was known,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get into this later as to why,</p>
<p>but he was known as the rat tickler</p>
<p>because he tickled rats.</p>
<p>And he actually found that rodents</p>
<p>and animals of many kind</p>
<p>generate laughter in response to tickling.</p>
<p>And in fact, they don&rsquo;t have the capacity</p>
<p>to tickle themselves,</p>
<p>something we&rsquo;ll also talk about why that is.</p>
<p>And he was called the rat tickler,</p>
<p>but then he discovered that many species of animals</p>
<p>engage in laughter in response to tickling</p>
<p>and that they tickle each other.</p>
<p>And the reason you don&rsquo;t hear them laughing,</p>
<p>no, you can&rsquo;t hear your dog laughing,</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t laughing, it&rsquo;s something else,</p>
<p>is that most animals besides humans</p>
<p>laugh at kind of ultrasonic levels of auditory output,</p>
<p>meaning the frequencies of sound</p>
<p>are just too high for you to hear.</p>
<p>But with the appropriate devices,</p>
<p>he was able with his colleagues</p>
<p>to isolate the so-called the rat laughter.</p>
<p>And then it turns out there&rsquo;s kitten laughter</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s puppy laughter.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s human laughter.</p>
<p>So Jaak Pengsepp was a very interesting</p>
<p>and pioneering person in this field.</p>
<p>And he also discovered</p>
<p>that play is homeostatically regulated,</p>
<p>meaning if animals, including children,</p>
<p>are restricted from playing for a certain amount of time,</p>
<p>they will play more when given the opportunity.</p>
<p>In the same way that if I food restrict you</p>
<p>for a long period of time,</p>
<p>you will eat more when you are finally allowed to eat.</p>
<p>And this is important because it moves this thing</p>
<p>that we call play from the dimension</p>
<p>of higher order functions</p>
<p>or things that evolved recently,</p>
<p>that are really kind of at the front edge</p>
<p>of human evolution,</p>
<p>deeper into the circuitry of the brain,</p>
<p>whereby we say the brainstem,</p>
<p>the kind of ancient parts of the brain</p>
<p>are going to be involved.</p>
<p>And in fact, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re going to learn later in the podcast,</p>
<p>play is generated through the connectivity</p>
<p>of many brain areas.</p>
<p>But one of the key brain areas is an area called PAG,</p>
<p>periaqueductal gray.</p>
<p>The periaqueductal gray is a brainstem area.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty far back as the brain kind of transitions</p>
<p>into the spinal cord.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s rich with neurons that make endogenous opioids.</p>
<p>So these are not the kinds of opioids</p>
<p>that are causing the opioid crisis.</p>
<p>These are neurons that you and I all have</p>
<p>that release endogenous,</p>
<p>meaning self-made or biologically made opioids.</p>
<p>They go by names like enkephalin and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Play evokes small amounts of opioid release into the system.</p>
<p>They kind of dope you up a little bit,</p>
<p>not so much as one would see</p>
<p>if one were to take exogenous opioids.</p>
<p>And in fact, exogenous opioids, as we now know,</p>
<p>are potentially very hazardous,</p>
<p>highly high addiction potential, high overdose potential.</p>
<p>They cause all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>Yes, there are clinical uses for them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re causing a lot of problems nowadays.</p>
<p>But these endogenous opioids are released in children</p>
<p>and adults anytime we engage in play.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be a very important chemical state</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something about having an abundance</p>
<p>of these endogenous opioids released into the brain</p>
<p>that allows other areas of the brain,</p>
<p>like the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>the area of the front that&rsquo;s responsible</p>
<p>for what we call executive function.</p>
<p>Executive function is the ability to make predictions,</p>
<p>to assess contingencies.</p>
<p>Like if I do this, then that happens.</p>
<p>If I do that, then that happens.</p>
<p>Well, prefrontal cortex is often seen</p>
<p>as a kind of rigid executive of the whole brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to view it,</p>
<p>but probably a better way to view it</p>
<p>is that the prefrontal cortex works in concert</p>
<p>with these other more primitive circuitries.</p>
<p>And when the periaqueductal gray releases</p>
<p>these endogenous opioids during play,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex doesn&rsquo;t get stupid.</p>
<p>It actually gets smarter.</p>
<p>It develops the ability to take on different roles</p>
<p>and explore different contingencies.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about role play later</p>
<p>in different contexts.</p>
<p>And what we will find is that so much of play</p>
<p>is really about exploring things in a way</p>
<p>that feels safe enough to explore, right?</p>
<p>This is not what happens when we drive down the street</p>
<p>or when we bike down the street.</p>
<p>When we are headed to work,</p>
<p>commuting on our bicycle or walking or driving,</p>
<p>we tend to be very linear</p>
<p>and we tend to be very goal-directed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to just take a new street just because.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to be spontaneously</p>
<p>riding in the middle of the road</p>
<p>and then on the sidewalk and then back and forth.</p>
<p>Although I can remember as a kid,</p>
<p>I was doing some of that.</p>
<p>I liked to jump off curb cuts when I was a kid.</p>
<p>And then eventually I graduated, sorry to the cyclist,</p>
<p>but I graduated to skateboarding.</p>
<p>And then I looked on skateboarding,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always kind of exploring terrain.</p>
<p>But you know, as I got older,</p>
<p>actually I find myself becoming much more linear.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t play with my commute very much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just about getting to work and then working.</p>
<p>When endogenous opioids are in our system,</p>
<p>when we were in this mode of play,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex starts seeing</p>
<p>and exploring many more possibilities</p>
<p>of how we interact with our environment,</p>
<p>with others and the roles that we can assume for ourselves.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to dissect one by one,</p>
<p>the different aspects of play, role play, social play,</p>
<p>individual play, imaginary play, competitive play.</p>
<p>There are enormous number of dimensions of play.</p>
<p>And by the end of this episode,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to arrive at a very key feature.</p>
<p>The key feature is one that&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>your personal play identity.</p>
<p>All of us have what we call a personal play identity.</p>
<p>This personal play identity was laid down</p>
<p>during development.</p>
<p>And it is the identity that you assume in playful scenarios.</p>
<p>And it is the identity that you adopt</p>
<p>in non-playful scenarios.</p>
<p>The great news is that your personal play identity</p>
<p>is plastic throughout your entire lifespan.</p>
<p>You can adjust your personal play identity</p>
<p>in ways that will benefit you in work and relationships</p>
<p>and your overall level of happiness.</p>
<p>We will discuss protocols and ways to do that.</p>
<p>But I do want to give a nod to the late Jacques, excuse me,</p>
<p>Jacques Pengsepp, the rat tickler.</p>
<p>And I also want to just give a nod to play generally.</p>
<p>As we move forward in the discussion,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;d love for everyone to do</p>
<p>is to stop thinking about play as just a child activity,</p>
<p>not just a sport related activity,</p>
<p>but really as an exploration in contingencies.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s an exploration of if I do A, what happens?</p>
<p>If I do B, what happens?</p>
<p>If someone else takes on behavior or attitude C,</p>
<p>what am I going to do?</p>
<p>And play is really where we can expand our catalog</p>
<p>of potential outcomes.</p>
<p>And it can be enormously enriching.</p>
<p>And indeed, as we&rsquo;ll talk about the tinkerers of the world,</p>
<p>the true creatives,</p>
<p>the people that build incredible technologies and art,</p>
<p>and also they just have incredibly rich emotional</p>
<p>and intellectual and social lives,</p>
<p>all have a strong element of play.</p>
<p>And so today I hope to convince you of some protocols</p>
<p>that will allow you to expand your various roles in life</p>
<p>through the portal of play.</p>
<p>So we established that play is homeostatic,</p>
<p>meaning we all need to do it.</p>
<p>Many of us, including myself,</p>
<p>probably haven&rsquo;t played that much as adults.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all pretty busy.</p>
<p>A number of us are stressed.</p>
<p>We got a lot to do in life.</p>
<p>But as children, most all of us engage in a lot of play.</p>
<p>And in looking at the way that very young children</p>
<p>and especially toddlers play,</p>
<p>we can learn a lot because it reveals the fundamental rules</p>
<p>by which the toddler brain interacts with the world.</p>
<p>Now, one of the key things about the baby brain</p>
<p>is that the baby brain somehow knows</p>
<p>that it can&rsquo;t do everything in the world, right?</p>
<p>If a baby needs something,</p>
<p>it generally will cry or make some sort of vocalization</p>
<p>or some sort of facial expression or combination of those.</p>
<p>And the caretaker, whoever that may be, will provide it.</p>
<p>This is an ancient hardwired mechanism</p>
<p>whereby the so-called autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that generates stress will create this kind of whining</p>
<p>and discomfort, maybe a writhing,</p>
<p>maybe the baby gets kind of red in the face.</p>
<p>And the caretaker delivers something based on a good guess</p>
<p>of what that baby needs.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s breast milk, maybe it&rsquo;s bottle milk,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a diaper change, maybe it&rsquo;s to be warmed up</p>
<p>if the baby is cold, maybe it&rsquo;s to be cooled down</p>
<p>if the baby&rsquo;s too warm,</p>
<p>maybe if the baby&rsquo;s in this little onesie thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s feeling restricted and it just wants to move</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll get taken out of their crib or their stroller</p>
<p>or whatever it is and allowed to stretch out on the floor.</p>
<p>Remember, the baby doesn&rsquo;t know exactly what it needs,</p>
<p>it only knows the state of discomfort.</p>
<p>And of course, we don&rsquo;t know exactly what babies</p>
<p>and toddlers are thinking</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t express themselves with language yet.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s key to understand is the rule</p>
<p>or the contingency that is set up in that scenario.</p>
<p>In that scenario, the child feels some discomfort,</p>
<p>expresses that discomfort verbally</p>
<p>or through a facial expression or both,</p>
<p>and then some force,</p>
<p>some person from the outside world resolves it.</p>
<p>And so the very young baby and indeed many children</p>
<p>up to certain ages and let&rsquo;s confess,</p>
<p>many adults are not able to meet</p>
<p>or adjust their internal states of stress</p>
<p>and so they look to things outside of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first rule, the fundamental rule</p>
<p>that we all learn when we come into life.</p>
<p>That when in a state of discomfort,</p>
<p>to look outside our immediate biology,</p>
<p>beyond the confines of our skin and find a solution.</p>
<p>A sip of water, for adults it might be a sip of alcohol.</p>
<p>Probably not the best tool to relieve stress,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one that many people do in fact engage in.</p>
<p>For the baby that&rsquo;s hungry,</p>
<p>the bottle milk comes from the outside.</p>
<p>As we gain more proficiency in moving through life</p>
<p>and we can get things for ourselves,</p>
<p>we still often bring things from the external world in</p>
<p>to resolve this, what I&rsquo;m calling autonomic discomfort</p>
<p>or autonomic dysregulation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a game, but that&rsquo;s a rule.</p>
<p>As we advance from infant to toddler,</p>
<p>we start to think more in terms of where we are</p>
<p>and what we own relative to what&rsquo;s out there in the world.</p>
<p>And now in the world of child psychology,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a somewhat famous poem</p>
<p>that was written by a research child psychologist.</p>
<p>His name was Burton White,</p>
<p>and he wrote a poem called the Toddler&rsquo;s Creed.</p>
<p>The Toddler&rsquo;s Creed defines well</p>
<p>what the rules and contingencies of play are</p>
<p>in very young children.</p>
<p>And it reveals to us just how narrow</p>
<p>and limited their worldview is</p>
<p>and how self-centered their world is.</p>
<p>So the Toddler&rsquo;s Creed, read quickly,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to take up too much time with this,</p>
<p>is if I want it, it&rsquo;s mine.</p>
<p>If I give it to you and change my mind later, it&rsquo;s mine.</p>
<p>For anyone that&rsquo;s played with a toddler,</p>
<p>you can imagine this in your mind.</p>
<p>If I can take it away from you, it&rsquo;s mine.</p>
<p>If I had a little while ago, it&rsquo;s mine.</p>
<p>If we are building something together,</p>
<p>all the pieces are mine.</p>
<p>If it looks just like mine, it&rsquo;s mine.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s mine, it will never belong to anyone else,</p>
<p>no matter what.</p>
<p>And of course, as we hear this, it sounds quite awful, right?</p>
<p>And yet this is actually a reflection</p>
<p>of what a healthy toddler would think about the world,</p>
<p>that the objects and things,</p>
<p>and even the people in the world are theirs,</p>
<p>that they are actually possessions that belong to them.</p>
<p>Now, of course, some people never actually transition</p>
<p>beyond this stage of moral and social development.</p>
<p>And there are indeed some adults</p>
<p>that fit the Toddler&rsquo;s Creed,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re welcome to share this with them</p>
<p>if ever you think that it might be of benefit</p>
<p>to their self-reflection.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness,</p>
<p>Burton White&rsquo;s Toddler&rsquo;s Creed is really grounded</p>
<p>in this transition from when we are infants,</p>
<p>and we have to have things delivered to us,</p>
<p>to the point where we are toddlers,</p>
<p>and we can access things in the world,</p>
<p>but we tend to assume that they are all ours.</p>
<p>And then the next stage is the really key stage</p>
<p>as it relates to play,</p>
<p>because in the next stage of development</p>
<p>is where young children start to interact</p>
<p>with other children, and there&rsquo;s an exchange</p>
<p>and a possession, and then a letting go of certain things.</p>
<p>Learning that not everything is yours</p>
<p>and that the entire world is not about you</p>
<p>is one of the key contingencies</p>
<p>that is established during play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the key ways in which children go</p>
<p>from being very self-centered</p>
<p>and basically unable to engage with other kids for very long</p>
<p>without some sort of eruption of crying</p>
<p>and some sort of battle of kind of push-pull over an object</p>
<p>to things like sharing and things like cooperative play.</p>
<p>So as we transition from forms of play</p>
<p>that are all about the self,</p>
<p>that are all me, me, me, me, me, the toddler&rsquo;s creed,</p>
<p>to forms of play that involve some discomfort</p>
<p>in assuming roles that maybe we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>and not getting what we want,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really an opportunity for the brain</p>
<p>to start to explore different roles that people take,</p>
<p>how they work as individuals and as pairs</p>
<p>and in larger groups,</p>
<p>and to do that in a low stakes environment, right?</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want this to be worked out on the battlefield</p>
<p>or when searching for food</p>
<p>or in some high stakes environment</p>
<p>where the survival of the species was important.</p>
<p>It appears that these circuitries for play evolved</p>
<p>so that rules and contingencies around who&rsquo;s most important,</p>
<p>whether or not the group is important,</p>
<p>whether or not individuals are going to be leaders</p>
<p>or followers, et cetera,</p>
<p>that can be explored in a low stakes environment.</p>
<p>Now, there are hundreds of different types of play</p>
<p>and hundreds of different types of contingency testing,</p>
<p>but the key theme here is that play allows</p>
<p>children and adults for that matter,</p>
<p>to explore different outcomes</p>
<p>in a kind of low stakes environment.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re playing a board game or a card game,</p>
<p>you might get really into that game,</p>
<p>but unless there&rsquo;s a lot of money on the table,</p>
<p>so to speak,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re really playing for something important,</p>
<p>or unless your ego is swollen</p>
<p>way out of proportion to reality,</p>
<p>if you lose, you might not feel good about it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s truly not the end of the world.</p>
<p>And if you win, you might feel really good about it,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not really incredible.</p>
<p>You were just incredible in that particular situation</p>
<p>for that particular moment.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really transform the rest of your life</p>
<p>unless that game is of a particular type,</p>
<p>but for sport, for instance,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about sport later.</p>
<p>So the key theme here is that play is contingency testing.</p>
<p>Play is contingency testing under conditions</p>
<p>where the stakes are sufficiently low</p>
<p>that individuals should feel comfortable</p>
<p>assuming different roles,</p>
<p>even roles that they&rsquo;re not entirely comfortable with</p>
<p>in their outside life.</p>
<p>And that all relates again,</p>
<p>to the release of these endogenous opioids</p>
<p>in this brain center, periaqueductal gray,</p>
<p>and the way that it allows the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>in a very direct way,</p>
<p>I mean, truly it allows it in a biological way</p>
<p>to expand the number of operations that it can run</p>
<p>and start thinking about,</p>
<p>oh, well, okay, normally I&rsquo;m kind of a loner</p>
<p>and I like to read and work and hang out alone,</p>
<p>maybe even play alone,</p>
<p>but okay, I&rsquo;ll play a board game</p>
<p>or a game of tennis where I have a partner</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to play as partners</p>
<p>against two other people.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a little uncomfortable, but I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>And in doing that,</p>
<p>you discover certain ways in which you are proficient</p>
<p>and certain ways in which you are less proficient.</p>
<p>You discover that the other person</p>
<p>actually tends to cheat a little bit,</p>
<p>or the other person is extremely rigid about the rules,</p>
<p>or maybe it was extremely rigid</p>
<p>about the way they organize their pieces on the board</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re crossing the line</p>
<p>into your side of the tennis court.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of things that we learn</p>
<p>in these rather low stakes scenarios.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key theme here.</p>
<p>So before I continue,</p>
<p>I just want to point to a tool that anyone can use,</p>
<p>but in particular, the less playful of the group.</p>
<p>And I would put myself into this category.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not somebody</p>
<p>who really engages in spontaneous play.</p>
<p>I enjoy sports, I enjoy exercise,</p>
<p>but that is distinct from play</p>
<p>because the sports and exercise that I engage in,</p>
<p>I take pretty seriously.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not low stakes for me.</p>
<p>Actually, I put a lot of importance on them.</p>
<p>Actually, as I&rsquo;m saying all this,</p>
<p>I probably should put a little less importance on them</p>
<p>and have a little more fun with those.</p>
<p>And yet what I&rsquo;m about to tell you is that anyone</p>
<p>and everyone can benefit from engaging</p>
<p>in a bit more of this playful mindset.</p>
<p>The playful mindset is not necessarily about smiling</p>
<p>and jumping around or being silly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not it at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the Tigger character from Winnie the Pooh,</p>
<p>necessarily, it could be,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really about allowing yourself</p>
<p>to expand the number of outcomes</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re willing to entertain</p>
<p>and to think about how you relate</p>
<p>to those different outcomes.</p>
<p>So what this means is putting yourself</p>
<p>into scenarios where you might not be the top performer,</p>
<p>playing a game that you&rsquo;re not really that good at.</p>
<p>I had this experience recently.</p>
<p>Friends that like to play cards,</p>
<p>they like to do some low stakes gambling.</p>
<p>This is not an illegal gambling ring.</p>
<p>They play for trivial things.</p>
<p>And I generally don&rsquo;t buy into the game.</p>
<p>I generally don&rsquo;t play,</p>
<p>mostly because they end up winning</p>
<p>and taking whatever it is that I have.</p>
<p>But in the mode of assuming a more playful spirit,</p>
<p>the idea would be, well, if the stakes are low enough,</p>
<p>then to play simply for the sake of playing,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something to learn there</p>
<p>about the other people in the group and about oneself</p>
<p>and how one reacts to things like someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s clearly trying to take everybody&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>or somebody who is clearly trying to cheat</p>
<p>or somebody who&rsquo;s clearly very, very rigid</p>
<p>about every last detail,</p>
<p>including how the cards are dealt and shuffled, right?</p>
<p>There is learning in this exploration.</p>
<p>And that is at a biological level,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex starting</p>
<p>to entertain different possibilities,</p>
<p>starting to entertain different outcomes</p>
<p>in this low stakes way.</p>
<p>And if you think about it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not something that we allow ourselves</p>
<p>to do very often.</p>
<p>Even if we listen to new forms of music</p>
<p>or we go see new art or new movies,</p>
<p>those are new experiences,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not us making new predictions</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the brain working to figure out new possibilities.</p>
<p>And so you can immediately see how just a small increase</p>
<p>in your willingness to put yourself into conditions</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t understand all the rules perhaps,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not super proficient at something,</p>
<p>but you enter it because it is low stakes.</p>
<p>And because there is information to learn</p>
<p>about yourself and others,</p>
<p>could start to open up these prefrontal cortex circuits.</p>
<p>And when I say open up,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean that literally there&rsquo;s an opening</p>
<p>in your skull.</p>
<p>What I mean is that your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>can work in very rigid ways.</p>
<p>Meaning if A, then B.</p>
<p>If I go down this street, turn left</p>
<p>and go that way to work, it is fast.</p>
<p>If I go down the other street, it&rsquo;s slow.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a traffic jam there, I&rsquo;m going to go there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s starting to explore different possibilities.</p>
<p>And there are very, very few opportunities in life</p>
<p>to explore contingencies in this low stakes way,</p>
<p>such that it engages neuroplasticity</p>
<p>of the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>So play is powerful at making your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>more plastic, more able to change in response to experience,</p>
<p>but not just during the period of play,</p>
<p>but in all scenarios.</p>
<p>Because you get one prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get a prefrontal cortex just for play.</p>
<p>You get a prefrontal cortex that engages in everything.</p>
<p>So going forward, I will layer on</p>
<p>some more concrete aspects of tools.</p>
<p>But for now, if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t consider yourself particularly playful,</p>
<p>consider and maybe even engage in just a little bit of play</p>
<p>in some way that is of discomfort to you</p>
<p>with the understanding that is increasing</p>
<p>your prefrontal cortical plasticity.</p>
<p>Another really interesting and important aspect of play</p>
<p>is so-called play postures.</p>
<p>These are seen in animals and these are seen in humans.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are watching</p>
<p>this podcast on YouTube,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do my best to adopt them here.</p>
<p>For those of you that are listening,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll just have to imagine them in your mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>But Jak Pengsepp and indeed Darwin himself</p>
<p>studied these play postures that all animals engage in.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most familiar one is seen in dogs and in wolves</p>
<p>where they will lower their head to the ground</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll put their paws out in front of them</p>
<p>and they will make eye contact</p>
<p>with another typically dog or wolf</p>
<p>to so-called call the play.</p>
<p>Now, when they do this posture,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious that they&rsquo;re lowering themselves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not in an aggressive stance</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re lowering their head.</p>
<p>And this is universally known among canines as play posture.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some famous videos online,</p>
<p>you can look these up,</p>
<p>of dogs actually doing this with bears</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re confronted with.</p>
<p>And the bears, at least in these videos,</p>
<p>in exchange also lowering their head</p>
<p>and there you see bear-dog playful interactions.</p>
<p>Now, you always have to be cautious with bears in general.</p>
<p>I would say you have to be cautious with bears.</p>
<p>But this speaks to the universality of this bowing,</p>
<p>this sort of what some people call the puppy bow</p>
<p>or the play bow that dogs do.</p>
<p>Turns out that humans do this as well,</p>
<p>although in a different form.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are some</p>
<p>that go into the down dog play posture,</p>
<p>but more typically when humans want to play,</p>
<p>they will do a subtle or not so subtle head tilt.</p>
<p>The head tilt with eyes open</p>
<p>is considered the universal head and facial expression</p>
<p>posture of play in humans.</p>
<p>So when two people see one another,</p>
<p>if they are aggressive towards one another,</p>
<p>they will assume certain facial expressions and postures.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re feeling playful towards one another,</p>
<p>oftentimes they&rsquo;ll tip their head to the side</p>
<p>just a little bit and they&rsquo;ll open their eyes.</p>
<p>They might even raise their eyebrows briefly.</p>
<p>This has been seen again and again and again.</p>
<p>Another hardwired feature of so-called play postures</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called soft eyes.</p>
<p>When animals are aggressive or when they&rsquo;re sad,</p>
<p>they tend to reduce the size of their eye openings</p>
<p>by basically making their eyelids closer together,</p>
<p>somewhat by keeping their eyes together</p>
<p>in particular for aggression,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll bring their eyes</p>
<p>towards what we call a virgin&rsquo;s eye movement,</p>
<p>bring it towards the center</p>
<p>that actually narrows the aperture of the visual field.</p>
<p>When people or animals want to engage in play,</p>
<p>they tend to open their eyelids somewhat</p>
<p>and they tend to purse their lips just a little bit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like throwing or pursing your lips like this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pursing their lips.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll open their eyes a little bit</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll often do the head tilt as well,</p>
<p>sometimes with a little bit of a smile.</p>
<p>These are reflexive.</p>
<p>These are not trained up.</p>
<p>Children do this, adults do this,</p>
<p>dogs, wolves do this, even certain birds will do this.</p>
<p>Most birds have eyes on the side of their heads,</p>
<p>but they do a sort of form of this soft eyes approach.</p>
<p>And certainly in raptors, you see a softening of the eyes</p>
<p>and indeed raptors like hawks and eagles,</p>
<p>they actually do have a certain form of play,</p>
<p>but only early in life.</p>
<p>The other thing that we see during play</p>
<p>are what are called partial postures.</p>
<p>Partial postures are a kind of play enactment</p>
<p>of postures that would otherwise be threatening.</p>
<p>So a partial posture that we see during play</p>
<p>in animals and humans that relates to aggressive play.</p>
<p>So things like wrestling or things like rough and tumble</p>
<p>play, which is very common in animals and kids</p>
<p>and some adults is that because there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a physical interaction in animals,</p>
<p>what will happen is they will march toward one another</p>
<p>often very slowly, but rather than having their hair up,</p>
<p>which we call pyloreaction, which is when the hair goes up,</p>
<p>animals do this to make themselves look bigger.</p>
<p>Think about the cat that&rsquo;s trying to look bigger</p>
<p>or an animal that&rsquo;s being aggressive trying to look bigger</p>
<p>in the presence of a foe, a different animal</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re either going to try and kill or fight</p>
<p>in some way, even if it&rsquo;s to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Partial postures occur when animals will approach</p>
<p>one another, but they&rsquo;ll keep their fur down.</p>
<p>Humans will do this too.</p>
<p>They will approach during play,</p>
<p>but unless it&rsquo;s highly competitive play,</p>
<p>like a football game or a boxing match,</p>
<p>they will actually shrink their body size somewhat.</p>
<p>We have hair on our bodies, some of us more than others,</p>
<p>and that hair is capable of pyloreaction.</p>
<p>It can stand up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hair standing up on end phenomenon,</p>
<p>but most of us don&rsquo;t have enough hair on our bodies</p>
<p>that we can actually use that to make ourselves larger.</p>
<p>So what you see with people who are about to engage in play</p>
<p>is they tend to make their body a little bit smaller</p>
<p>unless they are highly competitive</p>
<p>and highly competitive play is its own distinct form of play</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about later, such as during sport,</p>
<p>when the stakes are high, a Superbowl football game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m revealing my ignorance about sports here.</p>
<p>The Superbowl as it&rsquo;s typically called</p>
<p>is a very high stakes game, right?</p>
<p>Salaries depend on it.</p>
<p>Sponsorships depend on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on television.</p>
<p>Reputations depend on it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not really playing a game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s playing a very high stakes game.</p>
<p>And there you&rsquo;re not going to see these partial postures.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to see soft eyes and tilting of the head,</p>
<p>at least not between the opposing players on the team.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to see quite the opposite,</p>
<p>grunting, screaming, shouldering,</p>
<p>people not blinking, lowering their eyes,</p>
<p>or rather shrinking their eyes down</p>
<p>to appear more aggressive, these kinds of things,</p>
<p>staring right through the other person,</p>
<p>verbal threats, et cetera.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not really play,</p>
<p>even though we say they&rsquo;re playing a game of football,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very high stakes play.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to here is when it&rsquo;s fairly low stakes.</p>
<p>And we see this again in animals and in humans.</p>
<p>So there are many, many of these partial postures.</p>
<p>Again, they happen spontaneously.</p>
<p>So if someone ever looks at you</p>
<p>and they tilt their head a little bit</p>
<p>and they raise their eyebrows</p>
<p>and they maybe smile a little bit,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re looking at you playfully.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the universal human exchange of, I want to play.</p>
<p>Do you want to play?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another play expression</p>
<p>that is considered the most extreme of the,</p>
<p>come on, let&rsquo;s play expressions and postures.</p>
<p>And this is one that&rsquo;s seen in a lot of primates</p>
<p>and indeed in some humans as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the eyes wide open and believe it or not,</p>
<p>tongue out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that kind of silly thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ve ever done that before.</p>
<p>Just that kind of thing is basically</p>
<p>what primate species of all kinds,</p>
<p>and indeed we are old world primates as well,</p>
<p>do when they want to say, I&rsquo;m definitely here to play.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>Okay, it has this kind of silly look or connotation.</p>
<p>But if you watch chimpanzees or you look at bonobos</p>
<p>or even in the so-called new world monkeys,</p>
<p>which tend to be the smaller monkeys,</p>
<p>old world monkeys tend to be the ones that in general</p>
<p>see the world as we do.</p>
<p>They have what we call trichromacy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones that often can look very human-like.</p>
<p>The new world monkeys tend to be the little ones.</p>
<p>In general, I&rsquo;ll give you a little trick here,</p>
<p>a little tool based on primatology.</p>
<p>If you see a monkey and it&rsquo;s making very slow movements</p>
<p>or you see an ape of any kinds making very slow movements,</p>
<p>very likely to be an old world primate.</p>
<p>If you see a monkey and it&rsquo;s making very quick movements,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s doing this kind of thing,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like, could be a squirrel monkey,</p>
<p>could be a marmoset, likely to be a new world monkey.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t see the world the same way we do.</p>
<p>They see the world more like a dog.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really see reds.</p>
<p>They see reds as orange, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s not a hard and fast rule.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure the primatologists are going to come after me</p>
<p>with whatever primatologists come after you</p>
<p>with monkey biscuits or something like that.</p>
<p>But in general, it&rsquo;s a good rule.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at the zoo and you see a slow moving monkey</p>
<p>with slow deliberate gestures, kind of moves its eyes,</p>
<p>makes eye contact every once in a while,</p>
<p>those tend to be the old world primates.</p>
<p>Those kind of jittery ones that look like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really nervous, wrapping their tail</p>
<p>and kind of hiding there in a little bundle,</p>
<p>those tend to be the new world monkeys.</p>
<p>Okay, again, not a black and white type division,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;ll get you most of the way.</p>
<p>So the whole purpose of these partial postures</p>
<p>or the tongue out thing is to limit power in deliberate ways</p>
<p>to really take bodily expressions that could be portrayed</p>
<p>or could be interpreted as aggressive or as threatening</p>
<p>or as wanting to mate or as wanting to do anything</p>
<p>for that matter, and to limit the power</p>
<p>with which they are expressed in very deliberate ways.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the putting the hair down</p>
<p>despite getting into a fighting stance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s saying let&rsquo;s fight,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not really here to fight fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s low stakes fighting.</p>
<p>Like if I pin you, then I&rsquo;ll let you go.</p>
<p>Or if you pin me, then you ought to let me go.</p>
<p>And so immediately you can start to see how play</p>
<p>starts to call into action social dynamics</p>
<p>in which both parties have to make some sort of agreement</p>
<p>about how high the stakes are.</p>
<p>Now, the failures to do this are also very informative</p>
<p>in how we develop in social groups.</p>
<p>And this also can inform why some people</p>
<p>really play well with others and other people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And some people seem to get along well with groups</p>
<p>and can handle other people.</p>
<p>And some people are very rigid.</p>
<p>In fact, I have a anecdote about this.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, we used to play this game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a game I suggest,</p>
<p>but we used to do what were called dirt clod wars.</p>
<p>So a friend of mine, his parents were generally not home</p>
<p>in the afternoon.</p>
<p>So we must&rsquo;ve been somewhere around 10 or 11 years old.</p>
<p>And we would set up these two big dirt mounds.</p>
<p>We would shovel them to big dirt mounds</p>
<p>on two sides of the yard.</p>
<p>And then we would just take dirt clods</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d throw them at one another</p>
<p>and just have dirt clod wars.</p>
<p>Again, not suggesting this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not responsible for what happens if you do,</p>
<p>but there were rules.</p>
<p>And the rules were, for instance,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t pack rocks into the dirt clods</p>
<p>and you could run across to the other side</p>
<p>and you could jump on the other person&rsquo;s mound,</p>
<p>you could throw dirt clods in there.</p>
<p>I guess this is the stuff that we thought was entertaining.</p>
<p>But if someone got hit in the head,</p>
<p>generally there was an unspoken rule</p>
<p>that you kind of stop and see whether or not</p>
<p>they were damaged or not before you&rsquo;d continue.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t continue pelting them.</p>
<p>And of course people broke this rule.</p>
<p>In fact, I remember one kid, I&rsquo;m not going to name him</p>
<p>because actually he&rsquo;s grown into a very,</p>
<p>very actually prominent and functional adult,</p>
<p>but he got hit once in the head.</p>
<p>And then I think someone had thrown a dirt clod</p>
<p>shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden he just went into a rage,</p>
<p>picking up rocks and sticks and attacking another kid.</p>
<p>And so clearly that was a case</p>
<p>in which the rules of the game were now being violated,</p>
<p>but it served a very important purpose.</p>
<p>There was the typical thing that there were some tears,</p>
<p>I think, as I recall from one kid or the other,</p>
<p>there was like snot coming out of the nose</p>
<p>and turning bright red.</p>
<p>A kid went home, it was a mess.</p>
<p>The parents had to say something,</p>
<p>or maybe there was a phone call.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite recall how it got resolved.</p>
<p>But the idea is that there&rsquo;s an agreed upon set of rules</p>
<p>about how high the stakes are</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re all going to do.</p>
<p>And this is separate from sport</p>
<p>where there are clearly defined rules</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s out of bounds, what&rsquo;s in bounds,</p>
<p>what sorts of behaviors will get you a yellow card</p>
<p>or a red card, for instance, on the soccer field.</p>
<p>All animals, including humans,</p>
<p>are doing this low stakes contingency testing.</p>
<p>And all animals, including humans,</p>
<p>you will find start to up the stakes.</p>
<p>And inevitably in group play,</p>
<p>one member of the group will kind of break rules.</p>
<p>You see this also in puppies.</p>
<p>So for instance, puppies will bite one another</p>
<p>with those sharp little needle-like puppy teeth.</p>
<p>I remember when Costello had those teeth,</p>
<p>those things were so darn sharp.</p>
<p>And puppies will yelp</p>
<p>when one of their litter mates bites them.</p>
<p>That yelp actually serves a very important</p>
<p>inhibitory function, this is well-defined,</p>
<p>to tell the other one that&rsquo;s too tough.</p>
<p>And this is how animals learn soft bite, okay?</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t get that feedback from other litter mates,</p>
<p>they never actually learn what&rsquo;s too hard and what&rsquo;s soft.</p>
<p>And so humans do this as well.</p>
<p>Now you can look at your adult counterparts,</p>
<p>and indeed we should probably look at ourselves,</p>
<p>and ask, you know, did we learn proper play contingency</p>
<p>when we were younger?</p>
<p>Do we tend to take things too seriously?</p>
<p>Do we tend to overreact aggressively</p>
<p>when other people are clearly engaging in, you know,</p>
<p>playful jabbing or sarcasm or things of that sort?</p>
<p>Each of you will have a different experience of this,</p>
<p>but the point is that play serves many functions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the self,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about interactions between multiple people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about rule testing and low-stakes contingency.</p>
<p>Rule-breaking also serves an important role,</p>
<p>as is with the example of the Dirk-Claude War,</p>
<p>puppies biting other puppies, et cetera.</p>
<p>And last but not least, there are different forms of play</p>
<p>that help us establish who we will become as adults.</p>
<p>One of the more powerful of these is role-play.</p>
<p>When children, and sometimes adults,</p>
<p>will take on different roles that are distinct</p>
<p>from their natural world roles,</p>
<p>in order to, for instance, establish hierarchies.</p>
<p>So someone&rsquo;s going to be the leader,</p>
<p>and someone&rsquo;s going to be the follower.</p>
<p>Someone will be dominant, and someone will be submissive.</p>
<p>Someone will work alone, other people will work in a group.</p>
<p>These kinds of role-playing are, again,</p>
<p>ways in which the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>has to expand the number of operations.</p>
<p>In neuroscience, we call these algorithms</p>
<p>that it has to run in order to make predictions.</p>
<p>You have to take in a lot of information</p>
<p>about your environment all the time and make predictions.</p>
<p>But if you are suddenly cast into a new role,</p>
<p>well, then you definitely have to make even more predictions</p>
<p>from a different standpoint.</p>
<p>So these are very powerful for teaching the brain</p>
<p>how to function.</p>
<p>I had a sister growing up,</p>
<p>I still have a sister, fortunately,</p>
<p>and she and her friends largely played</p>
<p>with dolls and dollhouses in the room next door,</p>
<p>and they would take on different roles.</p>
<p>In fact, some kids, if they play alone,</p>
<p>will start to take on the role of leader</p>
<p>by taking on an imaginary or creating an imaginary friend.</p>
<p>And my apologies to my sibling,</p>
<p>but for a long time, she had an imaginary friend.</p>
<p>Eventually, that imaginary friend disappeared.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the science around imaginary friends</p>
<p>and what makes them disappear or not,</p>
<p>at what stage of development,</p>
<p>but imaginary friends are pretty common.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just another way of being able to</p>
<p>boss somebody around, if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>or to engage in cooperative play.</p>
<p>So we can look at this stage of development</p>
<p>we call childhood, and we can look at each stage of it,</p>
<p>and we can say, wow,</p>
<p>there are all these different dimensions of play</p>
<p>that really are about testing out</p>
<p>how we feel, comfortable or uncomfortable,</p>
<p>how we react, good or bad,</p>
<p>how we react with stress or with glee</p>
<p>when others behave in certain ways.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m hoping is coming through</p>
<p>is that play is not just about having fun.</p>
<p>Play is about testing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about experimenting,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about expanding your brain&rsquo;s capacity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true early in development,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>So at this point in the discussion,</p>
<p>I want to take a step back,</p>
<p>look at the biology and neurochemistry of play</p>
<p>just a little bit.</p>
<p>And in doing that, really define what is effective play.</p>
<p>If the goal of play is to explore different contingencies</p>
<p>in low stakes environments,</p>
<p>and to expand the function of our prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>so that we can see new possibilities</p>
<p>and new ways of being become more flexible,</p>
<p>more creative, more effective outside of the games of play,</p>
<p>or the arenas of play, I should say,</p>
<p>well, then we should be asking,</p>
<p>how do I know if I&rsquo;m playing?</p>
<p>How do I know if I&rsquo;m playing correctly?</p>
<p>Turns out there&rsquo;s an answer to that.</p>
<p>Earlier, I referred to this brain area,</p>
<p>the periaqueductal gray that releases opioids,</p>
<p>endogenous opioids into our brain and body,</p>
<p>and tends to relax us a bit.</p>
<p>It actually is what leads to these things like soft eyes</p>
<p>and head tilts and puppies making puppy postures</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And how that opens up the number of different functions</p>
<p>or algorithms that the prefrontal cortex can run.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another piece of the puzzle,</p>
<p>which is for something to genuinely be play and playful,</p>
<p>and for it to have this effect of expanding our brain</p>
<p>and engaging neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>of really changing our brain so that we can see</p>
<p>and engage in more possible behaviors</p>
<p>and thoughts, et cetera.</p>
<p>We also have to have low amounts of adrenaline,</p>
<p>so-called epinephrine, in our brain and body.</p>
<p>Now, the background science for this is quite extensive,</p>
<p>but for those of you that are interested in papers</p>
<p>and manuscripts, perhaps the best one is a review</p>
<p>published in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews</p>
<p>by the very Jak Pengsepp, although he has a co-author,</p>
<p>which is Steven Sivey, S-I-V-E-Y.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to this in the caption show notes.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper is</p>
<p>In Search of the Neurobiological Substrates</p>
<p>for Social Playfulness in Mammalian Brains.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a quite extensive review,</p>
<p>but it basically boils down to some key findings</p>
<p>whereby any sorts of drugs or behaviors or scenarios</p>
<p>that increase levels of adrenaline too much</p>
<p>will tend to inhibit play.</p>
<p>And drugs and scenarios,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not suggesting recreational drugs here,</p>
<p>but these were experiments that were done</p>
<p>in the laboratory setting,</p>
<p>that increase the endogenous opioid output</p>
<p>will tend to increase playfulness.</p>
<p>And so really the state of mind</p>
<p>that one needs to adopt when playing is,</p>
<p>first of all, you have to engage in the play,</p>
<p>whatever it happens to be,</p>
<p>with some degree of focus and seriousness.</p>
<p>And focus and seriousness in the neurobiological context</p>
<p>generally means epinephrine.</p>
<p>Being able to focus is largely reliant</p>
<p>on things like adrenaline, epinephrine,</p>
<p>but also the presence of dopamine,</p>
<p>which is a molecule that generates motivation</p>
<p>and focus in concert with epinephrine,</p>
<p>but also that these endogenous opioids be liberated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really the low stakes feature of play</p>
<p>that allows those endogenous opioids to be liberated.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, if you are very, very concerned about the outcome,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve put a lot of money on the table in a given game</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re a football player in the Superbowl,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re playing a game for which,</p>
<p>you know, defeating the other person</p>
<p>or your team winning is absolutely crucial to you.</p>
<p>Well, then that&rsquo;s not really going to engage</p>
<p>the play circuitry.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if you&rsquo;re engaging in those same behaviors</p>
<p>or any other behavior in a way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re simply there to explore,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have high levels of adrenaline in your system,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not stressed about the potential outcome,</p>
<p>well, then that constitutes play.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s somewhat obvious on the one hand,</p>
<p>that you take seriously what you take seriously</p>
<p>and you can be more playful about things</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t take so seriously.</p>
<p>But what is absolutely not obvious</p>
<p>is that the state of playfulness</p>
<p>is actually what allows you to perform best</p>
<p>because the state of playfulness</p>
<p>offers you the opportunity to engage</p>
<p>in novel types of behaviors and interactions</p>
<p>that you would not otherwise be able to access</p>
<p>if you are so focused on the outcome, okay?</p>
<p>So a state of playfulness is absolutely critical,</p>
<p>not just during play,</p>
<p>but during competitive scenarios of any kind.</p>
<p>I actually started to cultivate a practice</p>
<p>related to this when I was in college.</p>
<p>I had this kind of general practice</p>
<p>of when I wanted to learn something,</p>
<p>I would tell myself</p>
<p>that it was the most important information in the world</p>
<p>and that I was very, very interested in it.</p>
<p>I would kind of lie to myself and say,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m super interested in, I won&rsquo;t name the topics,</p>
<p>but super interested in this or super interested in that.</p>
<p>And I could sort of delude myself</p>
<p>into being hyper-focused on whatever it is</p>
<p>that I was learning in ways that surprised me.</p>
<p>However, when we are hyper-focused on something</p>
<p>and we are rigidly attached to the outcome,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t engage in flexible thinking.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great tool to be hyper-focused on something</p>
<p>and take it very, very seriously</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re simply trying to learn things</p>
<p>by kind of rote memory, learn things and regurgitate,</p>
<p>learn and regurgitate of the sort that,</p>
<p>frankly, a lot of schooling involves.</p>
<p>But if we are trying to get better at something,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve sort of hit a wall in athletic performance</p>
<p>or in cognitive performance where we&rsquo;re not creative enough</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re finding, let&rsquo;s just use a sports example</p>
<p>that we only have a certain number of moves</p>
<p>that we can deploy</p>
<p>or a certain number of swings of the racket</p>
<p>that we can deploy.</p>
<p>The way to actually expand your practice</p>
<p>is to engage in this kind of low stakes thinking,</p>
<p>the idea that, well, I&rsquo;m just going to kind of play</p>
<p>and tinker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to explore in a way</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>if the ball goes back over the net.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter if the ball goes in the hole.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s counterintuitive because you think,</p>
<p>no, the thing that we need to do is drill and drill</p>
<p>and drill and drill.</p>
<p>And indeed, there&rsquo;s a place for that.</p>
<p>But this mode of play with modest levels</p>
<p>of endogenous opioids being released in our system</p>
<p>plus low levels of adrenaline, right?</p>
<p>Epinephrine, low levels of epinephrine and adrenaline</p>
<p>are possible only when the stakes are low enough</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not stressed.</p>
<p>Well, that combination really allows the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>to explore different possibilities</p>
<p>in ways that can truly expand our capabilities over time.</p>
<p>Now, this has been seen again and again,</p>
<p>also in the business sector.</p>
<p>Some of the more challenging</p>
<p>or I should say competitive companies to get jobs at</p>
<p>are very interested in hiring people</p>
<p>that as children were so-called tinkerers</p>
<p>and actually NASA was first famous for this,</p>
<p>that many of the people that achieved great success</p>
<p>in engineering at NASA,</p>
<p>when they looked back into their childhood histories,</p>
<p>those people tended to be tinkers.</p>
<p>They were people that would kind of play with things</p>
<p>in a way that wasn&rsquo;t about rigidly following a recipe</p>
<p>or an instruction manual.</p>
<p>Great cooks discover new forms of food,</p>
<p>indeed create entire genres of food</p>
<p>by way of being tinkers, okay?</p>
<p>Musicians do this.</p>
<p>I grew up playing various sports,</p>
<p>but skateboarding was one</p>
<p>that I was particularly involved in for a long time.</p>
<p>One of the greatest skateboarders of all time is,</p>
<p>some of you may recognize his name</p>
<p>is the great Rodney Mullen.</p>
<p>And Rodney was kind of famous for evolving the sport</p>
<p>and continue to evolve the sport</p>
<p>in ways that no one could predict,</p>
<p>using skateboards and all sorts of ways</p>
<p>that no one had thought of previously.</p>
<p>And of course, there are other skateboarders</p>
<p>that did that as well,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s particularly well-known for that.</p>
<p>And his process is his own.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to it too much,</p>
<p>but he was also known as a kind of a tinker</p>
<p>or as somebody who would spend a lot of time</p>
<p>just kind of flipping the board</p>
<p>and just flipping it in the air</p>
<p>and watching the ways in which it flipped</p>
<p>and kind of studying the physics of it really,</p>
<p>and expanding on his existing understanding</p>
<p>of what could happen on a skateboard</p>
<p>by way of just playing.</p>
<p>Now he took it very seriously,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s this kind of razor&rsquo;s edge</p>
<p>between taking something very seriously,</p>
<p>but also tinkering and playing and exploring</p>
<p>and just seeing what happens,</p>
<p>kind of like, well, let&rsquo;s just see what happens</p>
<p>if we did this.</p>
<p>That mindset is extremely powerful</p>
<p>to export from this thing that we call play</p>
<p>into what we could call more serious endeavors</p>
<p>of one&rsquo;s occupation or sport,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s behind a desk</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s running around on a field,</p>
<p>really for, or engineering, any endeavor.</p>
<p>And so the whole purpose of this episode on play</p>
<p>is yes, on the one hand,</p>
<p>to illustrate the incredible evolutionary utility of play</p>
<p>for setting up the self</p>
<p>and relation of the self to others,</p>
<p>indeed for setting up cultures entirely</p>
<p>because cultures will watch sport together</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll celebrate their team winning.</p>
<p>I mean, World Cup, I&rsquo;ve never been a big soccer fan,</p>
<p>even though my dad is Argentine, but it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, the entire world kind of lights up</p>
<p>and gets engaged around whether or not their team,</p>
<p>their country is going to win.</p>
<p>The Olympics also being another example,</p>
<p>but play and sport are not quite the same</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve pointed out before.</p>
<p>And for all of us who are thinking about tools</p>
<p>and things that we can extract from science</p>
<p>to enrich our lives,</p>
<p>I would say for those of you that are already playing</p>
<p>on a regular basis in one form or another, terrific.</p>
<p>Start to expand other forms of play,</p>
<p>in particular forms of play</p>
<p>that involve new groups of individuals.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody that typically plays one-on-one</p>
<p>with somebody, try to expand into playing as teams.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who only plays alone,</p>
<p>then try to expand into playing in perhaps one-on-one first</p>
<p>and in groups.</p>
<p>This is the way that your brain learns and evolves</p>
<p>and changes and gets better.</p>
<p>And I raise this because another one</p>
<p>of the top 10 questions I get is,</p>
<p>how can I keep my brain young?</p>
<p>How can I continue to learn?</p>
<p>How can I get better in school, in sport, in life,</p>
<p>in relationships, et cetera, emotionally, cognitively,</p>
<p>and on and on and on.</p>
<p>And yes, there are supplements</p>
<p>that can support neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Yes, there are brain games and apps</p>
<p>that can support neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>But if you really want to engage in neuroplasticity</p>
<p>at any age, what you need to do is return</p>
<p>to the same sorts of practices and tools</p>
<p>that your nervous system naturally used</p>
<p>throughout development.</p>
<p>And that evolved over hundreds of thousands of years</p>
<p>to trigger this thing that we call neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And the reason this is so important is</p>
<p>because it starts to move us away</p>
<p>from what some people called hacks.</p>
<p>I define hacks as using one thing for a different purpose</p>
<p>to kind of get a shortcut.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like the term, frankly.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like it because it&rsquo;s not grounded</p>
<p>in any biological mechanism.</p>
<p>But when we look at play,</p>
<p>we can say play is the portal to plasticity.</p>
<p>Play at every stage of life is the way</p>
<p>in which we learned the rules for that stage of life.</p>
<p>And play is the way in which we were able</p>
<p>to test how we might function in the real world context.</p>
<p>So play is powerful.</p>
<p>And we could even say</p>
<p>that play is the most powerful portal to plasticity.</p>
<p>The reason for that is that, yes,</p>
<p>this high opioid, low epinephrine,</p>
<p>or adrenaline state is what opens up play.</p>
<p>But then inside of the arena of play,</p>
<p>when the prefrontal cortex is running</p>
<p>all these different possibilities in this low stakes way,</p>
<p>but with some degree of focus,</p>
<p>there are a number of other chemicals that are deployed.</p>
<p>Things like brain-derived nootrophic factor</p>
<p>and other growth factors that actually trigger</p>
<p>the rewiring of brain circuits that allow for it to expand.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s what is neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in those chemicals</p>
<p>and the kind of arena of things that happen</p>
<p>when one engages in neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a vast literature out there.</p>
<p>But one of the more popular books</p>
<p>that I think is quite good is from my friend</p>
<p>and colleague, John Rady,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s R-A-T-E-Y.</p>
<p>He wrote the book, Spark, a few years back.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s still very relevant.</p>
<p>And John talks about the important role</p>
<p>that play exerts in the neuroplasticity process</p>
<p>and points to a number of different protocols</p>
<p>that one can engage in.</p>
<p>He also points to the importance</p>
<p>of navigating new environments,</p>
<p>to not just go on the same hike every week</p>
<p>or take the same walk,</p>
<p>but actually get into new novel environments.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re starting to sense a theme here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s novelty, exploring contingencies,</p>
<p>keeping the stakes relatively low, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But these really are the gates to this Holy Grail</p>
<p>that we call neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity, as I&rsquo;ve talked about in the podcast before,</p>
<p>is a two-step process.</p>
<p>It involves focusing very intensely</p>
<p>or at least focusing somewhat</p>
<p>on whatever it is that one is trying to learn,</p>
<p>and then engaging in deep rest,</p>
<p>ideally deep sleep, in the following nights.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve also talked about the benefits</p>
<p>of things like naps and yoga nidra,</p>
<p>so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>for enhancing or accelerating plasticity.</p>
<p>You can check out the episodes on Focus</p>
<p>at hubermanlab.com or the episodes</p>
<p>on how to learn faster that detail all those.</p>
<p>We had a newsletter that lists out</p>
<p>all the tools for neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>enhancing neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>All that is available zero cost to you</p>
<p>at hubermanlab.com, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can just download that information.</p>
<p>But John&rsquo;s book, that newsletter, those episodes,</p>
<p>they really point to this two-step process</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s focus and then rest, focus and then rest.</p>
<p>And play is its own unique form</p>
<p>of focused and then rest, focus and rest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same as learning something for sake of school</p>
<p>or critically trying to learn a motor behavior</p>
<p>for sake of sport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about expanding the number of things</p>
<p>that you could learn down the line, okay?</p>
<p>So said once again, so I just want to make sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s abundantly clear.</p>
<p>Play is about establishing a broader framework</p>
<p>within which you can learn new things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about learning some specific thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the game you happen to be playing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the dollhouse that the kids are playing with</p>
<p>so that they can become amazing dollhouse players</p>
<p>when they grow up, right?</p>
<p>The dirt clod war that I referred to earlier</p>
<p>for better or for worse,</p>
<p>was not about becoming the best dirt clod thrower</p>
<p>or winning the trophy for dirt clods in the neighborhood,</p>
<p>although we actually had a trophy</p>
<p>for the best dirt clod team.</p>
<p>Alas, it was not my team that year.</p>
<p>But the point is that you&rsquo;re learning rules</p>
<p>and establishing a broader foundation of practices</p>
<p>that then you can learn more things within that context.</p>
<p>Thus far, I&rsquo;ve tried to convince you</p>
<p>through a combination of data and anecdote and explanation</p>
<p>that adopting a stance of playfulness</p>
<p>and indeed engaging in play on a somewhat regular basis</p>
<p>could be beneficial to you</p>
<p>regardless of circumstances or goals.</p>
<p>If I haven&rsquo;t done that already,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m about to tell you hopefully</p>
<p>will push you over the line.</p>
<p>It turns out that when you look across the kingdom</p>
<p>of all animals,</p>
<p>what you find is that animals that engage</p>
<p>in playful behaviors for the longest period of time</p>
<p>are also the animals</p>
<p>that have the greatest degree of neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the brain and nervous system&rsquo;s ability to change</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>Put differently, animals that only play</p>
<p>for a very small fraction of their entire life</p>
<p>have very rigid brains that don&rsquo;t learn new things.</p>
<p>Whereas animals that play for a long period</p>
<p>throughout their life have very plastic brains.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s even some evidence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s at this point largely anecdotal,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some data starting to emerge</p>
<p>that adults that maintain a playful stance,</p>
<p>that engage in things, again,</p>
<p>that are low stakes, contingency exploring,</p>
<p>important enough that people focus</p>
<p>and that people pay attention to what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but that they are not filled with adrenaline,</p>
<p>freaked out about the outcome being A or B.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not super, super competitive,</p>
<p>maybe just a little bit competitive</p>
<p>or not competitive at all.</p>
<p>That allows for more ongoing plasticity.</p>
<p>And one of the people that comes to mind</p>
<p>in thinking about this is of course the physicist,</p>
<p>and I should say the great physicist,</p>
<p>Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize winner,</p>
<p>professor at Caltech,</p>
<p>was involved in the Manhattan Project,</p>
<p>but was also known for being a lifelong tinkerer, right?</p>
<p>He also was a mischievous tinkerer.</p>
<p>If you read any of the books about Feynman or by Feynman,</p>
<p>surely you&rsquo;re joking, Mr. Feynman,</p>
<p>or what do you care what other people think?</p>
<p>These are wonderful short stories,</p>
<p>mostly about Feynman doing things like picking all the locks</p>
<p>at the Los Alamos Laboratory</p>
<p>and putting all the top secret documents</p>
<p>out on the floor of the office</p>
<p>so that when people came in in the morning,</p>
<p>they were all out there.</p>
<p>Obviously they weren&rsquo;t released to the general public.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to threaten national security,</p>
<p>but playing pranks like that.</p>
<p>And actually Caltech, I don&rsquo;t know if this is still the case,</p>
<p>but Caltech where he was employed was always known</p>
<p>for doing very technologically challenging pranks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not known for their athletic prowess at Caltech,</p>
<p>sorry, Caltech, but they were known, for example,</p>
<p>disrupting the scoreboard at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,</p>
<p>for instance, and things of that sort</p>
<p>through technological feats that at least at the time</p>
<p>required a lot of playfulness and technological prowess.</p>
<p>So if you look in science or you look in art</p>
<p>or you look in medicine or you look in any domain,</p>
<p>what you find is the people that continue</p>
<p>to evolve new practices tend to be people</p>
<p>that were tinkers, people that are very creative</p>
<p>tend to be people that are unafraid of exploring things</p>
<p>in this low stakes way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not so rigidly attached to the outcome</p>
<p>that they have to do everything perfectly all the time.</p>
<p>Now they might cloak these playful behaviors</p>
<p>so that their final works always look perfect</p>
<p>or always look incredible,</p>
<p>but they have this kind of playful nature about them.</p>
<p>I would venture even to say that the street artists,</p>
<p>Banksy, for instance, obviously an incredible artist</p>
<p>puts a ton of thought and preparation into their work,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a kind of playfulness to the whole thing too</p>
<p>of using two-dimensional paintings in concert</p>
<p>with three-dimensional city dwellings in ways</p>
<p>that I think that most people hadn&rsquo;t previously.</p>
<p>There were other people like Christo</p>
<p>and artists of that sort that did that.</p>
<p>But I think Banksy is kind of recognized</p>
<p>as the modern rendition of that kind of playfulness</p>
<p>using cities in ways that most people don&rsquo;t use cities,</p>
<p>using art in ways that most people don&rsquo;t use art,</p>
<p>for instance.</p>
<p>So to go back to the example of Feynman,</p>
<p>Feynman was somebody who learned to paint</p>
<p>and draw quite well into his 60s.</p>
<p>He was somewhat famous or infamous, I should say,</p>
<p>for bongo drumming on the roof of Caltech.</p>
<p>I say infamous because he was known also</p>
<p>for doing that naked,</p>
<p>something that is certainly not in concert</p>
<p>with the ethical standards and behaviors</p>
<p>of universities today.</p>
<p>But Feynman had this playful spirit</p>
<p>as a child, he had that playful spirit as a teenager,</p>
<p>and he had that playful spirit as an adult.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the hallmarks of Feynman</p>
<p>was that he wasn&rsquo;t just a rigid physicist</p>
<p>who could explain things clearly to the general public.</p>
<p>He always carried through this playful spirit.</p>
<p>And in some of his writings,</p>
<p>he pointed to the fact that that playful spirit</p>
<p>was something that he worked very hard to continue</p>
<p>to cultivate in himself because it was the way</p>
<p>in which he could see the world differently</p>
<p>and to indeed make great discoveries</p>
<p>in the field of physics,</p>
<p>but also to kind of evolve his relationship</p>
<p>to life more generally.</p>
<p>And so he comes to mind as a prominent example</p>
<p>of somebody who did this.</p>
<p>And if I could achieve anything with this episode,</p>
<p>besides teaching you something about the biology of play,</p>
<p>would be to teach you about the utility of play.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t consider myself</p>
<p>a particularly playful person by nature,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve tried over the years to adopt this stance</p>
<p>of exploring things that are, you know,</p>
<p>very focused on contingencies of different kinds,</p>
<p>but keep the stakes low enough</p>
<p>that I can have some fun doing them.</p>
<p>And I like to think that it&rsquo;s benefited me somewhat.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d like to drill a little bit further</p>
<p>into this thing that we call neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Again, neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous systems'</p>
<p>ability to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>And I should just say that throughout the entire lifespan,</p>
<p>the nervous system can change very quickly</p>
<p>in response to negative experiences.</p>
<p>We can almost all engage</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called one trial learning,</p>
<p>where if something really terrible</p>
<p>or traumatic happens to us,</p>
<p>our nervous system will rewire almost immediately,</p>
<p>at least within a few days,</p>
<p>such that we tend to want to avoid the experience</p>
<p>that led to that trauma.</p>
<p>Now, the whole business of why people return</p>
<p>to things that are traumatic to them</p>
<p>is a whole other issue.</p>
<p>There are books about things like trauma bonding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the so-called repetition compulsion</p>
<p>from psychoanalysis that people go back into trauma</p>
<p>to retest and gain new opportunities</p>
<p>to overcome the trauma, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But in general, what I&rsquo;m referring to here is,</p>
<p>you know, you have a bad experience at the swimming pool</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a kid,</p>
<p>where someone holds your head underwater too long,</p>
<p>and then you just don&rsquo;t want to get back in the water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one trial learning of sorts.</p>
<p>That of course can be overcome</p>
<p>through proper exposure therapy</p>
<p>or someone that you trust taking you there,</p>
<p>or any number of behaviors that allow you</p>
<p>to overcome that particular scenario</p>
<p>and experience something new in that same context.</p>
<p>But across the lifespan,</p>
<p>the learning of new things, new contingencies,</p>
<p>new possibilities occurs very differently</p>
<p>from about age zero when we&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>until about age 25 and thereafter.</p>
<p>So from about, I want to emphasize,</p>
<p>approximately age 25 onward,</p>
<p>neuroplasticity occurs through the process</p>
<p>that is exactly as I described before.</p>
<p>Focus, rest, focus, rest.</p>
<p>We focus very intensely.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do the thing.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do the new movement.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do the golf swing.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t learn the math.</p>
<p>We try, we try, we try, we try.</p>
<p>We sleep a few nights,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden we can do it, right?</p>
<p>Because the rewiring actually occurs during deep rest</p>
<p>or naps, but mostly during deep sleep.</p>
<p>From birth till about age 25, however,</p>
<p>we can learn things, new things, and new contingencies,</p>
<p>not just negative things and traumatic things,</p>
<p>through somewhat passive exposure to those things, right?</p>
<p>I will never forget the first time</p>
<p>that we went on a family trip to Washington DC</p>
<p>and we went to the Smithsonian.</p>
<p>I got to see the old fighter planes.</p>
<p>And I think the Kitty Hawk</p>
<p>or one of the first planes was there.</p>
<p>Anyway, obviously my recollection isn&rsquo;t terrific.</p>
<p>My hippocampus is flailing on that one,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll never forget the trip</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll never forget who went.</p>
<p>And I think it was probably eight or nine years old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embedded somewhere in my memory.</p>
<p>And so just through passive experience</p>
<p>and my focusing on the things that excited me</p>
<p>about that trip, I have a recollection of that experience.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to deliberately focus.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t telling myself, focus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need to remember this trip someday,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to be podcasting about this,</p>
<p>you know, in 39 years or whenever.</p>
<p>Again, I forget exactly how old I was.</p>
<p>But the key feature here is that the developing brain</p>
<p>is able to learn through passive experience</p>
<p>because the neurons, the nerve cells</p>
<p>in the developing brain are much more over-connected</p>
<p>than they will be later in life.</p>
<p>The way to think about this is sort of</p>
<p>if you use Google Maps, as I do too often, I think,</p>
<p>when I drive, there are a number of roads and pathways</p>
<p>that would get you from point A to point B.</p>
<p>We could imagine those as neural circuits</p>
<p>or we can imagine neural circuits as those roads.</p>
<p>Early in development,</p>
<p>the nerve connections are much more extensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having a Google Maps</p>
<p>that where everything is connected to everything</p>
<p>through tiny little cross streets</p>
<p>and the whole thing is just a complete mess.</p>
<p>But then by taking particular routes of behavior,</p>
<p>of thought, of emotion,</p>
<p>certain routes become well-established</p>
<p>and the other routes that are not taken simply disappear.</p>
<p>Now, in the biological context, in the brain,</p>
<p>we call that process pruning.</p>
<p>And the simple way to envision this is early in development,</p>
<p>you have many, many more neurons</p>
<p>than you will have as an adult.</p>
<p>Those neurons are extensively interconnected</p>
<p>and approximately 40% of those interconnections</p>
<p>will disappear by the time you&rsquo;re 25 years old.</p>
<p>They are gone.</p>
<p>They are actively removed through processes</p>
<p>that involve things like glial cells that come in</p>
<p>and literally sneak their little processes</p>
<p>in between neurons at the synapse,</p>
<p>which are the points of contact</p>
<p>and communication between neurons,</p>
<p>and push those apart, even eat neurons, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incredible work from, for instance,</p>
<p>Beth Stevens&rsquo; lab at Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>showing that glial cells go in and eat synapses</p>
<p>that are not functional for that particular circuit.</p>
<p>Now, what this tells us</p>
<p>is that much of our learning during development</p>
<p>is the removal of incorrect connections,</p>
<p>but it also involves the strengthening of connections</p>
<p>that are going to serve certain emotions,</p>
<p>certain functions, motor functions,</p>
<p>cognitive functions, et cetera.</p>
<p>The process of play is largely a process</p>
<p>of engaging pruning of neural connections</p>
<p>and strengthening of the remaining connections.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that many of you have heard the term</p>
<p>fire together, wire together.</p>
<p>That phrase is often incorrectly attributed</p>
<p>to the great Donald Hebb, who indeed was great,</p>
<p>did incredible work, a psychologist from Canada</p>
<p>who established a lot of the basic cellular learning rules</p>
<p>for learning and memory,</p>
<p>but it was the also great Dr. Carla Schatz,</p>
<p>who is now at Stanford and was at Berkeley</p>
<p>and Harvard as well, but who is at Stanford Medical School</p>
<p>who coined this term fire together, wire together.</p>
<p>Indeed, that&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>When children play, when adolescents play,</p>
<p>and when young adults play, whether or not it&rsquo;s social play</p>
<p>or play with an object, whether or not it&rsquo;s a sport</p>
<p>or play of any kind, imaginary play, imaginary friend play,</p>
<p>there is a strengthening of certain neural connections</p>
<p>and a pruning away of up to 40%, perhaps even more</p>
<p>of connections that are not necessary</p>
<p>for certain types of behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.</p>
<p>What this means is that it is through the process of play</p>
<p>that we become who we are as adults.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier, it is through the process</p>
<p>of play that we are able to adjust who we are as adults.</p>
<p>Now, there are bounds on this process.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there&rsquo;s never been a reported case</p>
<p>of an individual who had a hyperplastic</p>
<p>or a brain that was as plastic in adulthood</p>
<p>as it was in childhood.</p>
<p>But what this tells us is that what we do</p>
<p>in the process of play as children</p>
<p>is really how we set up the rules for how we behave</p>
<p>as adults in almost all domains,</p>
<p>which is really incredible.</p>
<p>And of course, the reassuring thing is that</p>
<p>playing as an adult will allow you to expand</p>
<p>on those neural circuits.</p>
<p>You can literally grow new connections.</p>
<p>Some of you may be saying, does it create new neurons?</p>
<p>For better or for worse, it does not seem</p>
<p>that many new neurons are added to your brain in adulthood.</p>
<p>There are some papers that report a few neurons</p>
<p>in certain brain areas, isolated brain areas,</p>
<p>but by and large, most of the rewiring of neural connections</p>
<p>is the removal of certain connections,</p>
<p>this process we&rsquo;re calling pruning,</p>
<p>and the strengthening of the remaining connections</p>
<p>that make those kind of Google Maps roads</p>
<p>in the analogy I laid out before thicker and more robust.</p>
<p>Think of that as taking little trails</p>
<p>and turning them into roads, then paving those roads,</p>
<p>then turning those roads into highways,</p>
<p>then putting up more lanes on those highways</p>
<p>and eliminating all the small little backcountry roads</p>
<p>that one could take.</p>
<p>And again, this is an analogy for what is happening</p>
<p>at the level of neural circuitry.</p>
<p>Now, one of the key findings that has emerged</p>
<p>from the literature is that children</p>
<p>that have been subjected to trauma</p>
<p>or immense amounts of stress of any kind</p>
<p>have a harder time both engaging in play,</p>
<p>but also a harder time accessing neuroplasticity</p>
<p>later in life.</p>
<p>The good news is this is not a permanent effect.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about some of the ways to overcome that</p>
<p>in a moment, but this should make sense to you</p>
<p>because earlier we talked about how a high level</p>
<p>of adrenaline, epinephrine in the brain and body</p>
<p>actually inhibits, blocks the circuits in the brain</p>
<p>and body that generate play behavior.</p>
<p>And when I say that, I mean that in a very concrete way</p>
<p>that epinephrine and adrenaline can actually suppress</p>
<p>the sorts of circuitry that can lead to things</p>
<p>like soft eyes or tongue out or the head tilt</p>
<p>or what we called partial postures</p>
<p>of being able to engage in a rough and tumble play,</p>
<p>but not take that to the point of outright aggression</p>
<p>damaging the other person or them damaging you.</p>
<p>So when I say that, you know, trauma and stress</p>
<p>can inhibit neuroplasticity by way of inhibiting play</p>
<p>at a deeper neurobiological level,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m really saying is that the high levels of adrenaline</p>
<p>that are generated from trauma and stress</p>
<p>actually shut down the circuits that allow a child</p>
<p>or a young adult to enter the game of play</p>
<p>or engage in the game of play in the same way</p>
<p>that a child or young adult who didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>high levels of adrenaline in their system</p>
<p>could possibly engage in.</p>
<p>Now, the good news is that many of the existing</p>
<p>trauma therapies that are out there now,</p>
<p>including things like EMDR, exposure therapy,</p>
<p>cognitive behavioral therapy, and on and on,</p>
<p>including some of the therapies that are more neurochemical,</p>
<p>things like ketamine or are more engineering based,</p>
<p>things like transcranial magnetic stimulation, for instance,</p>
<p>many of those are paired with forms of talk therapy</p>
<p>that are really about the same thing that play is about,</p>
<p>which is exploring different contingencies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about exploring different types of emotional experiences</p>
<p>as they relate to the same sort of scenario</p>
<p>that created the trauma.</p>
<p>And we did an entire episode on fear and trauma,</p>
<p>and I recommend you check out that episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to find again at hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>very easy to find.</p>
<p>And there I talk all about trauma treatments</p>
<p>and the various kinds of trauma treatments</p>
<p>that are out there,</p>
<p>efficacy in different scenarios and traumas and so on.</p>
<p>But the point I&rsquo;d like to make now is that</p>
<p>the reason why children who experience</p>
<p>a lot of trauma and stress have limited plasticity later on</p>
<p>is because of the neurochemical substrates</p>
<p>that are created from trauma and stress,</p>
<p>because after all stress is epinephrine</p>
<p>and epinephrine is stress, those are inseparable.</p>
<p>And the way in which it more or less shuts down</p>
<p>or at least inhibits, suppresses those play circuits.</p>
<p>And again, the reassuring thing is that</p>
<p>by engaging in play as adults,</p>
<p>we can reactivate some of those circuits</p>
<p>and reopen the plasticity.</p>
<p>In fact, one very prominent trauma treatment now,</p>
<p>especially for people that have been subjected</p>
<p>to very severe traumas in the ongoing sense,</p>
<p>meaning traumas that went on for many, many years</p>
<p>is to get them to engage in play in things like dance,</p>
<p>in basically getting them to engage their bodily movements</p>
<p>in ways that they would otherwise</p>
<p>not feel comfortable to engage in.</p>
<p>And I find this area so interesting</p>
<p>because on the face of it, you could say,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s kind of, you know,</p>
<p>is that really biomedical treatment?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re taking people who are traumatized</p>
<p>and having them dance.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems kind of silly on the one hand,</p>
<p>depending on your, you know, your particular orientation,</p>
<p>but on the other hand, it&rsquo;s actually quite profound</p>
<p>and quite grounded in the mechanisms</p>
<p>by which the brain circuits change.</p>
<p>So again, back to this original principle,</p>
<p>which is that play isn&rsquo;t just one portal to plasticity,</p>
<p>play is the fundamental portal to plasticity</p>
<p>and that play and dance and exploration of novel movements,</p>
<p>exploration of novel athletic movements are the route</p>
<p>by which we access new ways of thinking, new contingencies.</p>
<p>And I find it wonderful that the trauma release</p>
<p>and the psychiatric and psychology community</p>
<p>are exploring things like play and dance</p>
<p>and other forms of reopening these circuits,</p>
<p>because indeed we would all love for there</p>
<p>to be a magic pill by which trauma could be erased</p>
<p>and new memories could be laid down</p>
<p>or a device that could do that.</p>
<p>But frankly, if you ask me or a number of my colleagues,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s likely to happen anytime soon</p>
<p>in an effective way,</p>
<p>I think the short answer is going to be no,</p>
<p>that there are going to be chemicals</p>
<p>and things that can augment and support that process,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s not going to be just a magic pill</p>
<p>that will suddenly reverse trauma altogether,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s always going to be a case</p>
<p>whereby shifts in neurochemical states</p>
<p>are going to have to be combined</p>
<p>with new ways of thinking and new behaviors.</p>
<p>And I find it wonderful and reassuring</p>
<p>that people are looking at play and play behavior</p>
<p>as a not just one tiny shard of possibility there,</p>
<p>but that it might actually be the main driver</p>
<p>and a highly productive lever</p>
<p>by which to rewire the traumatized brain.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re like me, you might be thinking,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m willing to be more playful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to explore play as a portal to plasticity.</p>
<p>And that all makes good sense.</p>
<p>But what should I play?</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve already established</p>
<p>that you want to keep your adrenaline low.</p>
<p>You have to keep the stakes low enough</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not going to get totally consumed</p>
<p>by the outcome.</p>
<p>Now, for some people who are highly competitive,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be challenging.</p>
<p>And yet I don&rsquo;t want to make it seem</p>
<p>as if you can&rsquo;t be competitive during play.</p>
<p>There are many forms of competitive play</p>
<p>that because you are a competitive person</p>
<p>allow you to derive great joy from that competitive play.</p>
<p>I have a friend who&rsquo;s particularly good at horseshoes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly good at horseshoes,</p>
<p>but whenever we play horseshoes,</p>
<p>I can tell he&rsquo;s out there to crush me on horseshoes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just one of these things where, you know,</p>
<p>I can tell he derives great pleasure</p>
<p>from crushing me at a game of horseshoes.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say because I haven&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>done the microdialysis,</p>
<p>which is a way of extracting chemistry</p>
<p>from the brain in real time,</p>
<p>nor have I recorded from his brain</p>
<p>or imaged it in a scanner,</p>
<p>whether or not he has high levels of epinephrine</p>
<p>or low levels of epinephrine</p>
<p>during those games of horseshoes.</p>
<p>I suspect his low levels of epinephrine</p>
<p>and high levels of dopamine, especially when he wins.</p>
<p>And yes, he wins every time.</p>
<p>But the point is that you can be competitive during play,</p>
<p>provided that you are enjoying yourself.</p>
<p>Okay, you can be competitive</p>
<p>provided that you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself.</p>
<p>There are particular forms of play</p>
<p>that lend themselves best to neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And those particular forms of play, again,</p>
<p>are not designed to necessarily just engage the plasticity</p>
<p>that allows you to perform that behavior,</p>
<p>but rather to expand the number of possibilities</p>
<p>for your brain to change in general throughout life.</p>
<p>And the two major forms of those</p>
<p>for which there&rsquo;s good peer-reviewed research</p>
<p>is to engage in novel forms of movement,</p>
<p>including different speeds of movement.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say for instance, you&rsquo;re somebody who runs.</p>
<p>I happen to like running.</p>
<p>I try and run three times a week.</p>
<p>And generally when I run, I run forward.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t run backward, although recently,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve become very excited</p>
<p>about the work of so-called Knees Over Toes Guy.</p>
<p>His name is Ben Parker,</p>
<p>but he goes by Knees Over Toes Guy on Instagram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met him,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve exchanged a few messages back and forth.</p>
<p>And some of his practices involve walking backwards</p>
<p>or doing sled pulls backwards.</p>
<p>I found these to be very beneficial for my back</p>
<p>and for my anterior tibialis</p>
<p>and some things that have really helped</p>
<p>with my posture and so forth.</p>
<p>But in general, when I run, I run forward.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to run backward that much.</p>
<p>And I might do that for a few minutes at the end,</p>
<p>but not so much throughout the entire run.</p>
<p>Running doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to a lot of novel forms</p>
<p>of movement, lateral movement.</p>
<p>So for you nerds out there moving in the sagittal plane</p>
<p>or angled movements,</p>
<p>but it does appear that things like dance or sports</p>
<p>where you end up generating a lot of dynamic movements,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s jumping,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s movement at different angles,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s ducking, where there&rsquo;s leaping,</p>
<p>that basically involve a lot of dynamic movement</p>
<p>and aren&rsquo;t just strictly linear.</p>
<p>Those seem to open the portals for plasticity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because they mimic a lot of the brain circuitry</p>
<p>that is associated with play.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is the way</p>
<p>in which those dynamic movements</p>
<p>and movements of different speeds</p>
<p>engage the vestibular system, the balance system.</p>
<p>The vestibular system is in the inner ear,</p>
<p>relates to the cerebellum, which translates to mini brain.</p>
<p>You got a little mini brain in the back of your brain.</p>
<p>It brings together visual information in a very direct way.</p>
<p>I talked a lot about this in the episode</p>
<p>on how to learn faster.</p>
<p>So if you want to go in depth on how vestibular</p>
<p>and different types of motor movements can open plasticity,</p>
<p>I talk a little bit more, I should say a lot more there.</p>
<p>But suffice to say that engaging in play</p>
<p>that has a lot of dynamic movement</p>
<p>or movements of different speeds,</p>
<p>things like dance, things like sports,</p>
<p>like soccer, where you&rsquo;re moving in different dimensions,</p>
<p>that tends to be very conducive</p>
<p>to what we would call play-related circuitry,</p>
<p>provided you don&rsquo;t take it too seriously.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get those high levels of epinephrine.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that are also interested</p>
<p>in non-physical or non-athletic forms of play</p>
<p>that can really expand plasticity,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some very interesting research</p>
<p>about the game of chess.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t play the game of chess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played a few times.</p>
<p>I confess I don&rsquo;t know how to move all the pieces.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to try and describe that here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn chess.</p>
<p>And I think after reading some of the peer-reviewed research</p>
<p>about chess and play and neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>now I understand why.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really nice paper that was published</p>
<p>in the International Journal of Research</p>
<p>in Education and Science in 2017.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper is,</p>
<p>Is Chess Just a Game?</p>
<p>Or Is It a Mirror That Reflects a Child&rsquo;s Inner World?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very intense title for a biologist like me.</p>
<p>But this paper is so interesting</p>
<p>because what it really points to is the fact</p>
<p>that in a single game, chess,</p>
<p>you have, at least as I understand, two players.</p>
<p>And those two players are moving pieces</p>
<p>on the chess board for which each piece</p>
<p>can do different things, right?</p>
<p>Can move in different ways under different scenarios,</p>
<p>but there are different rules for different pieces.</p>
<p>And so each player actually has to assume</p>
<p>multiple identities during the same game.</p>
<p>And each of those identities has different rules</p>
<p>and ways of interacting.</p>
<p>So in a way we can think of chess as one game,</p>
<p>but actually chess is a kind of a substrate</p>
<p>for exploring multiple roles for different characters.</p>
<p>And this is quite a bit different than for instance,</p>
<p>video games where somebody has their favorite</p>
<p>video game player or they have an avatar</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re always in the same role.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also quite a bit different for when you engage</p>
<p>in any kind of play where you are yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just being you in that game.</p>
<p>And so now I&rsquo;m highly incentivized to explore chess.</p>
<p>You see quotes out there, for instance,</p>
<p>things like chess is life or jujitsu is life.</p>
<p>I always assumed that that meant</p>
<p>that someone&rsquo;s entire life was chess</p>
<p>or their entire life was jujitsu, for instance.</p>
<p>But in reading over the research about chess in particular,</p>
<p>but also certain forms of martial arts,</p>
<p>also certain forms of dance,</p>
<p>what one finds is that indeed those games are life</p>
<p>in the sense that they involve adopting multiple roles</p>
<p>and exploring contingencies in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>So there are some games that allow you to explore</p>
<p>a much vaster landscape of movements or of mental roles</p>
<p>or ways of engaging in strategic movement</p>
<p>as is the case with chess.</p>
<p>And so when you hear that activity blank is life,</p>
<p>it often reflects the passion for that activity.</p>
<p>But I think looked at differently,</p>
<p>it also reflects the fact that that activity</p>
<p>is a portal through which you can explore life</p>
<p>through many, many different lenses.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s especially powerful</p>
<p>in terms of thinking about how play</p>
<p>can be leveraged for plasticity.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are interested in leveraging play</p>
<p>for neuroplasticity and expanding your mind, if you will,</p>
<p>I highly recommend picking an activity</p>
<p>that will allow you to adopt different roles</p>
<p>within that activity where it&rsquo;s not rigidly linear.</p>
<p>This is actually a way in which I start to depart</p>
<p>from this modern and important,</p>
<p>but somewhat narrow idea that exercise</p>
<p>is the only route to plasticity.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I have Nobel prize winning colleagues</p>
<p>that swim for two miles a day</p>
<p>and have done that for a long time.</p>
<p>And they will tell you,</p>
<p>I always think more clearly after my swimming.</p>
<p>And I certainly, in my experience,</p>
<p>after a good run or a good workout,</p>
<p>my mind seems to work best.</p>
<p>Unless of course that workout was very, very intense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this before.</p>
<p>If you do work out very, very hard</p>
<p>in whether or not it&rsquo;s aerobic or resistance training</p>
<p>or sport of any kind,</p>
<p>your brain won&rsquo;t function as well afterwards,</p>
<p>mostly because of the diversion of oxygen</p>
<p>to tissues away from your brain.</p>
<p>You actually are getting less oxygen to your brain.</p>
<p>But in general, most of us feel that</p>
<p>if we exercise regularly, our brain functions better.</p>
<p>But there are activities that extend beyond linear exercise,</p>
<p>beyond just generating the same sets of movements</p>
<p>over and over again, whether or not it&rsquo;s exercise or not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what play is.</p>
<p>Play is about dynamically exploring</p>
<p>different kinds of movements,</p>
<p>dynamically exploring different kinds of thoughts,</p>
<p>dynamically exploring different kinds of roles</p>
<p>that one could adopt.</p>
<p>And that is the way that the brain learns new things.</p>
<p>So I encourage you to explore chess.</p>
<p>I intend to learn chess this year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to do that.</p>
<p>Now, if you already play chess</p>
<p>and you are an expert chess player,</p>
<p>you actually will derive less benefit</p>
<p>in terms of this play-induced neuroplasticity</p>
<p>than you would, for instance, if you went out and,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, played a game of soccer</p>
<p>or did something that was very novel for your nervous system</p>
<p>because in that novelty and in that exploration</p>
<p>of new behaviors and new ways of thinking,</p>
<p>you are opening the portal to plasticity.</p>
<p>Whereas in doing what you already know how to do</p>
<p>and trying just to perform better and better at it,</p>
<p>you will get better at chess.</p>
<p>But again, that&rsquo;s just chess.</p>
<p>You are not expanding the realms</p>
<p>in which you can become more plastic,</p>
<p>that you are able to learn new things in relationship,</p>
<p>in life, in finance, in friendship, et cetera.</p>
<p>In researching this episode,</p>
<p>one of the most interesting areas I discovered</p>
<p>was this notion of personal play identity.</p>
<p>Personal play identity is a term that,</p>
<p>at least to my knowledge, was coined by a Turkish researcher</p>
<p>by the name, and forgive me, I&rsquo;m going to mispronounce this,</p>
<p>is Gokhan Gunes, G-O-K-H-A-N,</p>
<p>last name G-U-N-E-S.</p>
<p>And forgive me, Gokhan,</p>
<p>and if we have any Turkish-speaking members</p>
<p>of the audience, please put the correction</p>
<p>in the comment section on YouTube,</p>
<p>make it phonetic so I can understand what it is.</p>
<p>Please, I&rsquo;d love to correct it and apologies, or who knows,</p>
<p>if I got it right, then it was pure luck.</p>
<p>Gokhan Gunes has coined this term personal play identity</p>
<p>and the key role that personal play identity</p>
<p>establishes in who we see ourselves as being</p>
<p>and not just in the context of play.</p>
<p>Personal play identity has four well-defined dimensions.</p>
<p>And I should say that if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in learning more about this,</p>
<p>the paper that I found particularly informative</p>
<p>is published in Current Psychology,</p>
<p>and the title is,</p>
<p>Personal Play Identity and the Fundamental Elements</p>
<p>in Its Developmental Process.</p>
<p>And the author, of course, is Gokhan Gunes,</p>
<p>G-U-N-E-S, last name.</p>
<p>This is from 2021, so recent review.</p>
<p>There are four components to personal play identity.</p>
<p>How you play, your personality,</p>
<p>socioculture, and environment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the third one that&rsquo;s together,</p>
<p>socioculture and environment,</p>
<p>and economics and technology.</p>
<p>Now that sounds somewhat complex,</p>
<p>and this paper is somewhat complex,</p>
<p>but basically what it says is that we bring together</p>
<p>certain aspects of ourselves</p>
<p>and how we react to different play scenarios</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re younger.</p>
<p>And we bring that forward into the world</p>
<p>in all contexts as adults.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, I&rsquo;m going to ask you a question.</p>
<p>When you were a child, let&rsquo;s say 10 years old,</p>
<p>would you have considered yourself competitive?</p>
<p>Would you have considered yourself</p>
<p>somebody who&rsquo;s cooperative?</p>
<p>And realize, of course, that those are</p>
<p>not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>You could be competitive and cooperative.</p>
<p>Would you consider yourself somebody</p>
<p>that preferred to play alone</p>
<p>or preferred to play with one or two close friends?</p>
<p>Or were you somebody that really enjoyed</p>
<p>playing in large groups?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a key one.</p>
<p>Were you somebody that enjoyed playing the leader</p>
<p>in one moment and was equally okay</p>
<p>with being a follower at a later moment?</p>
<p>Were you okay with having your role switched</p>
<p>midway through a game?</p>
<p>Would you get upset or be delighted</p>
<p>or not care at all about having to switch teams</p>
<p>during the middle of a game</p>
<p>because your team was winning, right?</p>
<p>To even things out.</p>
<p>You can imagine how that would play out internally.</p>
<p>You would immediately register</p>
<p>that you must be a valuable player</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re being moved off the winning team</p>
<p>toward the losing team.</p>
<p>But then again, you&rsquo;re now being forced</p>
<p>to join the losing team.</p>
<p>How did you feel about that?</p>
<p>Were you somebody that was comfortable</p>
<p>with other people breaking rules</p>
<p>or perhaps even yourself breaking rules</p>
<p>or bending rules?</p>
<p>Kind of ill-defined term.</p>
<p>Or were you somebody that really needed</p>
<p>to know all the rules</p>
<p>and if everyone didn&rsquo;t rigidly adhere</p>
<p>to those rules was quite disturbed by that?</p>
<p>The number of questions goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>And I will provide a link to a paper</p>
<p>that asks a number of questions</p>
<p>that helps you arrive at a sort of score of sorts</p>
<p>or an index of what Gunes and others</p>
<p>have referred to as personal play identity.</p>
<p>The point is that if we look back</p>
<p>to our early adolescence,</p>
<p>somewhere between 10 and 14 years old,</p>
<p>a peak time for social development,</p>
<p>a peak time for play of various kinds,</p>
<p>a peak time for motor development,</p>
<p>a peak time of psychosocial development</p>
<p>where we learn where we fit into hierarchies</p>
<p>as we relate to members of the same sex,</p>
<p>of the opposite sex, et cetera,</p>
<p>we can start to get a portal into how</p>
<p>and why we show up to various activities</p>
<p>in work and relationship, et cetera, as adults.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll venture to say</p>
<p>that if we go into that process for ourselves</p>
<p>for five or 10 minutes,</p>
<p>you start to see some remarkable parallels</p>
<p>between the way you were at that stage</p>
<p>and your tendencies and your preferences as adults.</p>
<p>We tend to look at our early childhood experiences</p>
<p>and our families and to some degree,</p>
<p>our friends in terms of how we become who we become.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the incredible work of Alan Shore</p>
<p>on previous episodes of the podcast.</p>
<p>Alan Shore is a psychiatrist</p>
<p>and has done extensive work on how parent-child interactions</p>
<p>in particular baby and mother,</p>
<p>but also baby and father shape the brain</p>
<p>and the brain and emotional systems ability</p>
<p>to go from states of elation and excitement,</p>
<p>the so-called dopamine epinephrine type circuitry</p>
<p>to the more warm, soothing types of calm interactions</p>
<p>that in broad terms could be described</p>
<p>as more serotonin, oxytocin and things of that sort.</p>
<p>That work really points to the key roles</p>
<p>that the caregiver and the child, you,</p>
<p>engaged in an early life.</p>
<p>And that is incredible work.</p>
<p>I do hope to host Dr. Shore on the podcast</p>
<p>at some point in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>But equally important, of course,</p>
<p>are the interactions that we export</p>
<p>from that early laying down of biological circuitry</p>
<p>and psychological circuitry to the way we play by ourselves</p>
<p>and the way we play with others</p>
<p>in small numbers or in great numbers.</p>
<p>And of course it would be the case</p>
<p>that how we played as a 10 or 12-year-old</p>
<p>would impact how we behave as a 16-year-old</p>
<p>and as a 20-year-old and as a 30-year-old</p>
<p>and so on and so on.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about developmental biology</p>
<p>and developmental psychology is that it is grounded</p>
<p>in the fact that we don&rsquo;t just have a childhood</p>
<p>and an adulthood.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t just our child self and our adult self.</p>
<p>And even though there are transitions</p>
<p>around the mechanisms that underlie neuroplasticity</p>
<p>at approximately age 25,</p>
<p>it is simply the case that development</p>
<p>is our entire lifespan,</p>
<p>that our lifespan is one long developmental arc.</p>
<p>How long depends on our genetics, our lifestyle,</p>
<p>accidents, injury, and disease, of course,</p>
<p>but it is one long developmental arc.</p>
<p>And so it shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us at all</p>
<p>that how we learn to play as a 10-year-old or 12-year-old</p>
<p>would impact how we play and interact with people</p>
<p>as a teenager and a young adult and on and on and on.</p>
<p>And that play is the place in which we explore</p>
<p>and which we learn.</p>
<p>Play is the substrate by which our nervous system</p>
<p>changes us from this hyper-connected batch of neurons</p>
<p>where everything is connected to everything, more or less,</p>
<p>to a brain and nervous system</p>
<p>whereby certain circuits work with immense proficiency</p>
<p>and others are less accessible to us.</p>
<p>But again, the wonderful thing about the human nervous system</p>
<p>is that because it is plastic for the entire lifespan</p>
<p>and because these two elements of focus and rest</p>
<p>can be deployed again and again and again,</p>
<p>just because neural circuits didn&rsquo;t form</p>
<p>does not mean that they can&rsquo;t form later in life.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;ve been focusing on how play itself,</p>
<p>the same substrate that we use during development</p>
<p>to become who we are,</p>
<p>is the portal by which we can change</p>
<p>who we are for the better.</p>
<p>So I hope I&rsquo;ve convinced you that play</p>
<p>is an extremely important, fundamental,</p>
<p>homeostatically regulated aspect of our nervous system,</p>
<p>which is just a mouthful of nerd speak to say,</p>
<p>play can change your brain for the better.</p>
<p>And that is true for every stage of life.</p>
<p>The recommendation that I make,</p>
<p>and certainly the one that I&rsquo;m going to direct it myself</p>
<p>as well, is to try and engage in at least one hour</p>
<p>of pure play per week.</p>
<p>Now, I came to that recommendation</p>
<p>because of the literature that says,</p>
<p>well, you need to engage in something pretty repetitively.</p>
<p>It should be novel.</p>
<p>So this wouldn&rsquo;t be something</p>
<p>that you are exceptionally good at already.</p>
<p>If you insist on doing something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re already exceptionally good at,</p>
<p>then you want to really do some free form,</p>
<p>low stakes tinkering.</p>
<p>So make it safe, but make it free form.</p>
<p>So really explore things with that.</p>
<p>Some people call this beginner&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>although I find that a little abstract.</p>
<p>I like the notion of beginner&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>but sort of like,</p>
<p>how do you know if you&rsquo;re in beginner&rsquo;s mind?</p>
<p>I think beginner&rsquo;s mind is sort of the expectation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not going to do it well yet,</p>
<p>but play extends beyond beginner&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Play is really about not even worrying</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to get good at it or really proficient at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about exploring contingencies</p>
<p>with truly low stakes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what will allow you to access</p>
<p>these neurochemical combinations</p>
<p>of elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera,</p>
<p>that will open up neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>For those of you that need a little more guidance</p>
<p>on how to play, there&rsquo;s a book out there.</p>
<p>I actually learned about this from Tim Ferriss&rsquo; blog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Play It Away, A Workaholic&rsquo;s Cure for Anxiety.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s more focused on anxiety.</p>
<p>The author is Charlie Hohn, last name H-O-E-H-N.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a link for it in the show notes and caption.</p>
<p>Play It Away, A Workaholic&rsquo;s Cure for Anxiety.</p>
<p>But books and other resources aside,</p>
<p>I think one hour of play per week</p>
<p>is a reasonable amount of time</p>
<p>to engage in dedicated play behavior</p>
<p>for the purpose of opening up</p>
<p>these neural circuits for plasticity.</p>
<p>The key feature, of course,</p>
<p>is to not have immense proficiency in that given activity,</p>
<p>or at least not the way you perform it.</p>
<p>And if you do gain proficiency in that activity,</p>
<p>well, then it becomes something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer about play, it&rsquo;s about performance.</p>
<p>So in that case,</p>
<p>you would then want to adopt a new play behavior.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that I largely avoided</p>
<p>using the word fun throughout this episode.</p>
<p>Fun is a somewhat abstract term,</p>
<p>and like many emotions</p>
<p>and many verbal descriptions of experience,</p>
<p>it falls short in the context</p>
<p>of a neurobiological discussion about play.</p>
<p>If you have fun, terrific.</p>
<p>Some people might find, however,</p>
<p>that engaging in play is kind of uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Well, there, your goal then</p>
<p>should be to lower your level of discomfort</p>
<p>by focusing less on the outcomes</p>
<p>and just simply engaging in the behavior because,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m telling you that it&rsquo;s good for you,</p>
<p>but hopefully you will tell yourself</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s good for you</p>
<p>and that you will experience that it&rsquo;s good for you.</p>
<p>The literature certainly points to that.</p>
<p>And the literature certainly points to the fact</p>
<p>that play is the way that we are built.</p>
<p>We are built to play.</p>
<p>We have brain circuits from back to front</p>
<p>and within our body that are there for play,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t disappear.</p>
<p>They do not get pruned away</p>
<p>as we go from development to adulthood.</p>
<p>So if ever you needed a neurobiological explanation</p>
<p>for why play is important throughout the lifespan,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that biology does not waste resources.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely efficient.</p>
<p>And were the circuits for play</p>
<p>not to be important in adulthood,</p>
<p>they would have been pruned away.</p>
<p>But I guarantee you they are there</p>
<p>in your brain and nervous system now.</p>
<p>They will be there tomorrow</p>
<p>and they will be there going forward.</p>
<p>So my suggestion is that you use them one hour per week.</p>

<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for joining me for this discussion</p>
<p>about the incredible biology and psychology</p>
<p>and power of this thing that we call play.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
