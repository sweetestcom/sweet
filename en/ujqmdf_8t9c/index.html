Berg here in this video I wanted to answer the question what is the gallbladder okay now the gallbladder is located underneath the right ribcage right here okay you can see this is the liver on the right side as a little the liver makes a fluid that goes into the gallbladder okay and the gallbladder basically stores bile B IL e okay now bile is not waste or bowel like people think it&amp;rsquo;s like waste it&amp;rsquo;s now bile breaks down fats it breaks down facts it&amp;rsquo;s fats like a like a detergent will dissolve grease it breaks down fat into small little tiny particles so then certain things from the pancreas certain enzymes like lipase which basically breaks down fats worked in the small intestine to take that already broken down fat into really tiny particles of fat called essential fatty acids okay so that&amp;rsquo;s what it does so the pancreas and gallbladder work together to absorb and break down fats so the gallbladder secretes this vial when you eat fat that&amp;rsquo;s when it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to release it if you don&amp;rsquo;t eat fat it&amp;rsquo;s not going to release it so it&amp;rsquo;s stores bile it also concentrates file so the bile in that gallbladder is super strong so you don&amp;rsquo;t need much of it probably like one ounce or two ounces of it and it squashes out and it comes in the small intestine it does its work right there so here&amp;rsquo;s the thing if you&amp;rsquo;re actually consuming six meals all day but with snacks you&amp;rsquo;re doing three meals and using snacks between at night you&amp;rsquo;re grazing and every time you&amp;rsquo;re eating you&amp;rsquo;re basically releasing some bile especially if you&amp;rsquo;re eat any type of nuts or fats or anything like that well guess what you&amp;rsquo;re going to really create a loss of this concentration of bile because you&amp;rsquo;re constantly eating is constant it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to concentrate so you&amp;rsquo;re going to actually eventually be deficient in bile so we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that in a little bit but and that&amp;rsquo;s why in tremendous fasting is so healing to the gallbladder because it allows the gallbladder to concentrate its file and not have to work so hard that means eating without snacking through the day okay so it concentrates the bile it also kills bacteria in your food that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool alright so now let&amp;rsquo;s go back to this bio thing the most of emulsification comes from the latin word which means milk which actually means combining water and fat and that&amp;rsquo;s what milk is it&amp;rsquo;s like a combination of a substance that has water and fat together because you notice that fat and water don&amp;rsquo;t mix well when you emulsify it can actually mix better and that&amp;rsquo;s why the bile is emulsifier it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like a it allows the fat to be broken down and dissolved and mixed up within the rest of the the food coming down from the small intestine because if you didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to break down the fat the fat would just kind of go right through you and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be dissolved so bile also helps you lubricate the colon so when you&amp;rsquo;re deficient in bile you become constipated okay also if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a lubricated coal and you&amp;rsquo;ll have pain when you&amp;rsquo;re actually digesting when the food kind of does goes through because it&amp;rsquo;s not lubricated also by UPS alkalis the stomach acids coming down from the stomach so they&amp;rsquo;ll have the super concentrated acids from the stomach thank goodness we have the bile to help neutralize it because the bile is alkaline alright now how do you know if you&amp;rsquo;re deficient in bile well first of all your stools are going to float I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried this as a kid work or you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen people when they have the little stools floating in the toilet and you try to flush it it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go doesn&amp;rsquo;t go down it just keeps floating that&amp;rsquo;s some serious amount of fat in there that that person does not have enough bile to break down the fat okay so the stool should sink unless it has too much fat okay so also a pale color that would be a lighter color that would be an indication of lower low bile also bad odor anal leakage and it&amp;rsquo;s oily so those people have low bile because the oils is kind of going right through them we talked about constipated bloating probably right shoulder pain but this is the big thing they&amp;rsquo;re going to actually be deficient in fat soluble vitamins that&amp;rsquo;s vitamin A so there goes the eyes there goes the skin it goes with sinus also vitamin D bone pain poor immune system that&amp;rsquo;s low vitamin D levels because they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough file vitamin E that&amp;rsquo;s heart skin hormones vitamin K clotting factors bruising also of k2 high up getting rid of soft tissue calcium from the arteries very important and then you have a essential fatty acid absorption so essential fatty acids are those very the color essential for a reason because we need them very important for your heart very important as an anti-inflammatory they&amp;rsquo;re important for the cell structure in the cell wall very important to your skin so if you can&amp;rsquo;t absorb essential fatty acid you&amp;rsquo;re going to have dry skin dry hair so we got even your mood is affected by essential fatty acid there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people who take omega-3 or DHA all these healthy fats for certain health conditions well without this bile you can&amp;rsquo;t absorb it okay so if you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re deficient you just need to focus on improving the function of their let&amp;rsquo;s say you may be deficient in bile okay what do you do you can get a purified bile salt product okay I use one called the gall bladder formula this doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily just have purified bile salts it has a lot of other things it has stone root to help resolve gall stones it has pancreatic enzymes to help you take the pressure off the digestion it has the pain hydrochloride to help digest the acidify the stomach so it helps the stomach but got the pancreas the gall bladder Spanish black radish slippery elm bark to lubricate these little things so it&amp;rsquo;s a really good formula I like it and you take that app Amil you take one after meal you don&amp;rsquo;t need more than that and some people just take it after one meal now when do you know that you don&amp;rsquo;t need file is when you have diarrhea why because bio will actually increase the elimination so if you&amp;rsquo;re already eliminating too much you don&amp;rsquo;t need bio okay also if you have a hyper thyroid the fire is moving too much and you add bile to it which you don&amp;rsquo;t want to add that product that&amp;rsquo;s going to speed up more thyroid hormone and you&amp;rsquo;ll have a more hyper thyroid this would be good for taking bio will be good for someone that has a hypothyroid because bile is necessary for the conversion of t4 to t3 thyroid so it makes your thyroid work better if it&amp;rsquo;s slow so the only reason you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to take it is if it&amp;rsquo;s too fast which is more rare but just want to make that note so I hope that helped you understand the gallbladder a bit more on what it is and people just take these things out like this like it&amp;rsquo;s not important but it really is important try to keep your gallbladder at all cost alright thank you so much for watching"><title>What is Gallbladder？ – Explained by Dr. Berg ｜

Berg here in this video I wanted to 
answer the question what is the gallbladder okay  </p><p>now the gallbladder is located underneath the 
right ribcage right here okay you can see this  </p><p>is the liver on the right side as a little </p><ul><li>the liver makes a fluid that goes into the  </li></ul><p>gallbladder okay and the gallbladder basically 
stores bile B IL e okay now bile is not waste  </p><p>or bowel like people think it&rsquo;s like waste it&rsquo;s 
now bile breaks down fats it breaks down facts  </p><p>it&rsquo;s fats like a like a detergent will dissolve 
grease it breaks down fat into small little tiny  </p><p>particles so then certain things from the pancreas 
certain enzymes like lipase which basically breaks  </p><p>down fats worked in the small intestine to take 
that already broken down fat into really tiny  </p><p>particles of fat called essential fatty acids 
okay so that&rsquo;s what it does so the pancreas and  </p><p>gallbladder work together to absorb and break down 
fats so the gallbladder secretes this vial when  </p><p>you eat fat that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s supposed to release 
it if you don&rsquo;t eat fat it&rsquo;s not going to release  </p><p>it so it&rsquo;s stores bile it also concentrates file 
so the bile in that gallbladder is super strong  </p><p>so you don&rsquo;t need much of it probably like one 
ounce or two ounces of it and it squashes out  </p><p>and it comes in the small intestine it does its 
work right there so here&rsquo;s the thing if you&rsquo;re  </p><p>actually consuming six meals all day but with 
snacks you&rsquo;re doing three meals and using snacks  </p><p>between at night you&rsquo;re grazing and every time 
you&rsquo;re eating you&rsquo;re basically releasing some bile  </p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re eat any type of nuts or fats 
or anything like that well guess what you&rsquo;re going  </p><p>to really create a loss of this concentration of 
bile because you&rsquo;re constantly eating is constant  </p><p>it doesn&rsquo;t have a chance to concentrate so you&rsquo;re 
going to actually eventually be deficient in bile  </p><p>so we&rsquo;ll talk about that in a little bit but and 
that&rsquo;s why in tremendous fasting is so healing to  </p><p>the gallbladder because it allows the gallbladder 
to concentrate its file and not have to work so  </p><p>hard that means eating without snacking through 
the day okay so it concentrates the bile it  </p><p>also kills bacteria in your food that&rsquo;s pretty 
cool alright so now let&rsquo;s go back to this bio  </p><p>thing the most of emulsification comes from the 
latin word which means milk which actually means  </p><p>combining water and fat and that&rsquo;s what milk is 
it&rsquo;s like a combination of a substance that has  </p><p>water and fat together because you notice that 
fat and water don&rsquo;t mix well when you emulsify  </p><p>it can actually mix better and that&rsquo;s why the bile 
is emulsifier it&rsquo;s kind of like a it allows the  </p><p>fat to be broken down and dissolved and mixed up 
within the rest of the the food coming down from  </p><p>the small intestine because if you didn&rsquo;t have 
anything to break down the fat the fat would just  </p><p>kind of go right through you and it wouldn&rsquo;t 
be dissolved so bile also helps you lubricate  </p><p>the colon so when you&rsquo;re deficient in bile you 
become constipated okay also if you don&rsquo;t have  </p><p>a lubricated coal and you&rsquo;ll have pain when you&rsquo;re 
actually digesting when the food kind of does goes  </p><p>through because it&rsquo;s not lubricated also by UPS 
alkalis the stomach acids coming down from the  </p><p>stomach so they&rsquo;ll have the super concentrated 
acids from the stomach thank goodness we have  </p><p>the bile to help neutralize it because the bile 
is alkaline alright now how do you know if you&rsquo;re  </p><p>deficient in bile well first of all your stools 
are going to float I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever  </p><p>tried this as a kid work or you&rsquo;ve probably seen 
people when they have the little stools floating  </p><p>in the toilet and you try to flush it it doesn&rsquo;t 
go doesn&rsquo;t go down it just keeps floating that&rsquo;s  </p><p>some serious amount of fat in there that that 
person does not have enough bile to break down  </p><p>the fat okay so the stool should sink unless 
it has too much fat okay so also a pale color  </p><p>that would be a lighter color that would be an 
indication of lower low bile also bad odor anal  </p><p>leakage and it&rsquo;s oily so those people have low 
bile because the oils is kind of going right  </p><p>through them we talked about constipated bloating 
probably right shoulder pain but this is the big  </p><p>thing they&rsquo;re going to actually be deficient in 
fat soluble vitamins that&rsquo;s vitamin A so there  </p><p>goes the eyes there goes the skin it goes with 
sinus also vitamin D bone pain poor immune system  </p><p>that&rsquo;s low vitamin D levels because they don&rsquo;t 
have enough file vitamin E that&rsquo;s heart skin  </p><p>hormones vitamin K clotting factors bruising also 
of k2 high up getting rid of soft tissue calcium  </p><p>from the arteries very important and then you have 
a essential fatty acid absorption so essential  </p><p>fatty acids are those very the color essential for 
a reason because we need them very important for  </p><p>your heart very important as an anti-inflammatory 
they&rsquo;re important for the cell structure in the  </p><p>cell wall very important to your skin so if you 
can&rsquo;t absorb essential fatty acid you&rsquo;re going to  </p><p>have dry skin dry hair so we got even your mood 
is affected by essential fatty acid there&rsquo;s a  </p><p>lot of people who take omega-3 or DHA all these 
healthy fats for certain health conditions well  </p><p>without this bile you can&rsquo;t absorb it okay so 
if you feel like you&rsquo;re deficient you just need  </p><p>to focus on improving the function of their let&rsquo;s 
say you may be deficient in bile okay what do you  </p><p>do you can get a purified bile salt product okay 
I use one called the gall bladder formula this  </p><p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily just have purified bile salts 
it has a lot of other things it has stone root to  </p><p>help resolve gall stones it has pancreatic enzymes 
to help you take the pressure off the digestion it  </p><p>has the pain hydrochloride to help digest the 
acidify the stomach so it helps the stomach  </p><p>but got the pancreas the gall bladder Spanish 
black radish slippery elm bark to lubricate  </p><p>these little things so it&rsquo;s a really good formula 
I like it and you take that app Amil you take one  </p><p>after meal you don&rsquo;t need more than that and some 
people just take it after one meal now when do you  </p><p>know that you don&rsquo;t need file is when you have 
diarrhea why because bio will actually increase  </p><p>the elimination so if you&rsquo;re already eliminating 
too much you don&rsquo;t need bio okay also if you have  </p><p>a hyper thyroid the fire is moving too much and 
you add bile to it which you don&rsquo;t want to add  </p><p>that product that&rsquo;s going to speed up more thyroid 
hormone and you&rsquo;ll have a more hyper thyroid this  </p><p>would be good for taking bio will be good for 
someone that has a hypothyroid because bile is  </p><p>necessary for the conversion of t4 to t3 thyroid 
so it makes your thyroid work better if it&rsquo;s slow  </p><p>so the only reason you wouldn&rsquo;t want to take it 
is if it&rsquo;s too fast which is more rare but just  </p><p>want to make that note so I hope that helped you 
understand the gallbladder a bit more on what it  </p><p>is and people just take these things out like 
this like it&rsquo;s not important but it really is  </p><p>important try to keep your gallbladder at all 
cost alright thank you so much for watching</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
