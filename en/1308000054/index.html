    <p>Oh baby. No skin on skin. You just got to keep the shirt on.</p>
<p>Listen to me. Only the best for my daughter. This is 100% Loro Piana Vicuna.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to puke on it any minute. You&rsquo;re using Loro Piana to wipe her when she vomits.</p>
<p>No, this is the sweater that she&rsquo;s got her face on, but this is the softest material,</p>
<p>human, you know, I mean, natural material on earth.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>This is not subject to any supply chain constraints.</p>
<p>Oh, in fact, when you buy one from Loro Piana, they&rsquo;ll fly one right to you.</p>
<p>Guys, isn&rsquo;t it amazing how people in power</p>
<p>cannot take any time off and still remain in power and engaged when you have a baby.</p>
<p>J Cal, what&rsquo;s the reference?</p>
<p>Okay, our friend Joe Lonsdale, venture capitalist living in Austin, had a tweet that went viral,</p>
<p>but maybe not for the best reasons. He said, in response to a Dan Primrack tweet,</p>
<p>Dan works at Axios, who was talking about Joe Rogan criticizing the amount of time</p>
<p>Buttigieg was taking on paternity leave. And Joe Lonsdale responded, Wow, great for</p>
<p>fathers to spend time with their kids and support moms. But any man in an important</p>
<p>position who takes six months of leave for a newborn is a loser. In the old days, men</p>
<p>had babies and worked harder to provide for their future. That&rsquo;s the correct masculine response.</p>
<p>Well, it was an opinion from 1957. That&rsquo;s either his or</p>
<p>the way back machine. But Joe&rsquo;s old school, Joe is a unique individual. And he just happened to,</p>
<p>I think, in this whole, like, not get canceled debate, or don&rsquo;t let yourself get canceled debate,</p>
<p>the right is now saying, like, I&rsquo;m just gonna tell you how I actually feel.</p>
<p>And so Joe told us actually how he felt.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he said anything offensive. I think you can have a different opinion than what he</p>
<p>said. But I don&rsquo;t think he said it shouldn&rsquo;t exist. He said, if you&rsquo;re in a position of power,</p>
<p>and you check out for six months, it puts everything that you&rsquo;re doing under a lot of</p>
<p>pressure. That&rsquo;s, I think what he said, and he called those very specific people losers.</p>
<p>The context is Joe Rogan called up Pete Buttigieg. Because Pete Buttigieg had two kids via surrogate.</p>
<p>And I guess it&rsquo;s taking six months, or I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t even know how much time he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three months, but nobody knows if he&rsquo;s like working half time, but Rogan had an issue with it.</p>
<p>And then Dan Premack basically said, what Rogan doesn&rsquo;t know is at his own company,</p>
<p>ie Spotify, there&rsquo;s a six month policy, which, by the way, Joe Rogan does not work for Spotify,</p>
<p>based licenses show. So there is no way for Joe Rogan to know the internal policies. He is not</p>
<p>an employee. I mean, Jason, if you want if you want to hang your hat on that little fig leaf,</p>
<p>okay. No, I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m not defending Joe. But I&rsquo;m also saying like,</p>
<p>how would he know it&rsquo;s not like he went to HR and was like, Hey, what&rsquo;s our paternity?</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t work there. Yeah, fine. Well, six months is a long time, especially. I mean,</p>
<p>that is a long time to take off. The word loser is a very strong word. Do you think men who take</p>
<p>paternity are losers? No, no. I mean, it&rsquo;s their man who takes six months of paternity.</p>
<p>No, I wouldn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t actually call him a loser. I do think that is a long time for somebody</p>
<p>who, you know, prioritizes work. I mean, if an entrepreneur took six months of paternity,</p>
<p>would you would that influence whether or not you invest in his business?</p>
<p>Well, look, if you are the principal of a business, and you just disappear for six months,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to work. I mean, let&rsquo;s be realistic. Unless it does, in which case,</p>
<p>then you have other problems. Well, or look, if you&rsquo;re at like the stage that Google is at,</p>
<p>or whatever, the founders can disappear and move to, you know, islands and private islands. And</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what they did. But But look, we all know, I mean, that when you&rsquo;re a startup,</p>
<p>you face existential decisions, daily, weekly, or monthly, you can&rsquo;t just disappear for six</p>
<p>months, it&rsquo;s not going to work, you might only have six months of runway. So if you did take</p>
<p>six months of paternity, there would be no company when you came back in all likelihood.</p>
<p>Let me speak for myself. I couldn&rsquo;t ever take six months. I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll probably take three weeks</p>
<p>to a month. And honestly, I agree with David, I really didn&rsquo;t do much of anything that had to do,</p>
<p>frankly, all of this by herself. And so I&rsquo;m there to just be moral support and help where I can,</p>
<p>you know, baby needs a diaper change, I do that. I&rsquo;ll hand feed in a bottle because she&rsquo;s tired</p>
<p>of pumping and, you know, breastfeeding, like, but I am so peripherally at the edges trying to</p>
<p>help and be relevant and try to give her a break here or there. That&rsquo;s my role. And at some point,</p>
<p>when the kid gets on a schedule, there&rsquo;s even less stuff necessarily for me to do other than,</p>
<p>again, just be moral and emotional support. Then, of course, there&rsquo;s bonding and stuff. But,</p>
<p>you know, to be honest with you, like, I have found as a parent, the connection that I have</p>
<p>with my children has gotten meaningfully better as they&rsquo;ve gotten older. And maybe that&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>limitation that I have and my need to communicate and how I want to connect with my kids and how I</p>
<p>feel I get feedback back that gives me energy to be a parent. It is much easier for me</p>
<p>to find that equation with my 12 year old than it is with my, you know, two day old.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just me, you know, I&rsquo;m going to be out for three weeks to a month and</p>
<p>the other thing we&rsquo;re leaving out here is the question of resources. So Joe Lonsdale,</p>
<p>according to his podcast, is a billionaire, his podcast title. And so if you&rsquo;re a billionaire</p>
<p>and you have unlimited resources at home and 24 hour night nurses, which, you know,</p>
<p>we all know what those costs, you&rsquo;re talking about $1,000 or $2,000 a day to have 24 hour coverage,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s nothing to a billionaire. So if you, I don&rsquo;t want to make it about class, but</p>
<p>if you were two working parents, and you didn&rsquo;t have the money to hire somebody,</p>
<p>this is actually practically the only thing you can do. Somebody has to be with the kid. And</p>
<p>it can one spouse be at home, you know, I&rsquo;m 24 hours alone with the kid all the time.</p>
<p>As you guys know, I&rsquo;m from Canada. In Canada, we have a one year</p>
<p>maternity and paternity leave policy, it can kind of go both ways that basically the family gets it</p>
<p>and you can allocate it as and how you need it. And it pays for the salary, the government</p>
<p>basically guarantees your job, you go on effectively unemployment insurance after</p>
<p>some period of time where you go from 100% of your salary to about I think it&rsquo;s 50%.</p>
<p>Somebody will correct me if I get these details wrong. And then you go through the rest of the</p>
<p>year. Now in both cases by my sister, you know, when she had both kids, you know, on the way in,</p>
<p>she was like, I think I want to take the full year. And by the six month mark,</p>
<p>she was losing her mind. And you know, she&rsquo;s a lawyer at a really good research hospital. And</p>
<p>you know, she does work that&rsquo;s really valuable to her and that she finds really stimulating.</p>
<p>And she just needed more adult connection after six months. It was very hard for her to kind of</p>
<p>be there. Yeah, I just think six months for the second parent is that seems like a long time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could take six months off. But I also think if you have resources, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pockets of time, even when I did stay home for, I don&rsquo;t know, the first couple of weeks after the</p>
<p>kids were born. Yeah, they&rsquo;re asleep for three hours, and then you clean the diapers, feed them,</p>
<p>they play for an hour or two, and then they go back on a nap. You know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s constantly the stop and start. I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s hardest about is the</p>
<p>lack of sleep, I think. Oh, my God. It feels like I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny, but like, I forgot what it&rsquo;s like. But you know, you&rsquo;re reminded quickly.</p>
<p>It feels like you&rsquo;re drunk. Yes, two hours, you wake up, you get a 10 minute catnap, you wake up.</p>
<p>And this is where again, I go to and I&rsquo;m such a bit player in this play right now.</p>
<p>You know, at the edges, we&rsquo;re like not sleeping, I can take care of Tali. But I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>women do it. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s incredible. And for those of you listening,</p>
<p>Chamath has got his newborn on his chest. And swallowed quite nicely there.</p>
<p>This is why you should subscribe on YouTube. And you can see you can see that he&rsquo;s using his</p>
<p>new daughter to get the YouTube subscriptions. This is good. They should blow us past 100,000.</p>
<p>How do you feel so special? I feel so lucky. I feel so so lucky.</p>
<p>This is gonna be the most popular cameo on the pod since Freeberg&rsquo;s dog.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, she this chick is so deliciously cute. She&rsquo;s so she&rsquo;s so delicious. And I forgot</p>
<p>how beautiful the sounds that girls makes versus boys having three boys and two girls. Now.</p>
<p>I remember the boys, they make kind of interesting noises, but not really.</p>
<p>But my gosh, like little baby girl noises. And you guys access to girls, you have three,</p>
<p>three girls. It&rsquo;s girls are incredible. We&rsquo;re all basically girl dads like Oh,</p>
<p>so what a blessing. What a blessing. I feel really lucky news on your front.</p>
<p>Well, we had a baby the day after tomorrow at a baby.</p>
<p>There were all right. I just did. Yes. Congratulations.</p>
<p>Thank you, Freeberg. Where&rsquo;s your swaddled infant? You&rsquo;re letting you&rsquo;re letting Chamath</p>
<p>win sweepstakes here. What&rsquo;s going on? Yeah, he&rsquo;s vacuum is on the way.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t. Are you in the Joe Lonsdale? You did one day off and then went back to work.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in the place where you drop the kids off to get raised. And then you pick them up in a year.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re like, Oh, you mean like Vulcans? You&rsquo;re like Vulcans. We have</p>
<p>Vulcan into a learning pod and come back a year later.</p>
<p>I mean, they sleep most of the day. So she&rsquo;s asleep right now. Actually,</p>
<p>Allison just sent me a picture. She&rsquo;s sitting on the rocking chair where they&rsquo;re outside right now.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing. I give Lonsdale a lot of courage for saying what he thought.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t think that what he said was altogether that like vilifiable. If that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the word you want to use. I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of reasonable points of view. He could</p>
<p>have maybe use better language. But I think where he was coming from, I think a lot of us probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do it ourselves. We may never judge anybody else. I would never judge anybody who</p>
<p>takes six months. I know that I could not I would just I think either I&rsquo;m too selfish or whatever.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s just that much to do as the secondary. And to David&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>if I was asked to be the primary, I think I could probably step in and do 10% of what Nat would do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Joe Lonsdale, super blind spot. He made this very gender specific with men and women</p>
<p>in certain roles. And he basically is saying, you know, a man who takes six months off is a loser.</p>
<p>So he is not just giving his opinion, he&rsquo;s attacking people who do take the time off.</p>
<p>And then he says, Listen, in the old days, men had babies and worked harder</p>
<p>to provide for the future. That&rsquo;s the correct masculine response.</p>
<p>So I think what triggered people about his response, and perhaps rightfully so is that</p>
<p>this is just a video. But Jason, here&rsquo;s Can I say something like degrading men who take</p>
<p>time to take care of their kids? But look, we&rsquo;ve talked about this a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an opportunity for folks like us to take a step back and slow down and how we interpret</p>
<p>a tweet that&rsquo;s written at 8am in the morning super quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not advocating he&rsquo;d be cancelled.</p>
<p>And not and not just him, but everybody else. But like, there is an opportunity to teach</p>
<p>empathy here where I&rsquo;m not saying you have to agree with him. But you can also choose to see</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s trying to say through the exact words that he use, decide that you agree or disagree,</p>
<p>and then just move on. Of course, you know what I mean? And and I think that the reason why folks</p>
<p>may want to do that in this case, but in most other cases, is eventually it will be you that</p>
<p>makes a mistake. Sure. And you want to be let off the hook by other people that are empathetic</p>
<p>enough to say, I really disagree with what you&rsquo;re saying. But you don&rsquo;t deserve to be punished beyond</p>
<p>disagreement.</p>
<p>I love what your mouth just said. You know, the mistake that we make might even be on the spot</p>
<p>today. I&rsquo;ve already made it. I agree that we should all just be a little bit less judgmental.</p>
<p>And there, there, there, there, there is an element, there is a judgmental element in Joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tweet that that&rsquo;s probably the part I don&rsquo;t agree with is, look, if someone wants to do that, fine,</p>
<p>take the time doesn&rsquo;t actually make them a loser. But it&rsquo;s not a choice that I would</p>
<p>realistically make. Yeah, it&rsquo;s totally unrealistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even startups, like, you know, I&rsquo;m getting these, I&rsquo;m getting put to these</p>
<p>multi hundred million dollar decisions a day. I can&rsquo;t, you know, I could pause the business,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;ll have so many downstream implications. Unfortunately, I picked a job where I&rsquo;m in a</p>
<p>position where I can&rsquo;t check out even if I wanted to. So I try to do my best.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point he was trying to make that wasn&rsquo;t that well articulated. I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>any of us are in a situation where we can straight up walk away from work for any meaningful time. I</p>
<p>mean, on a daily basis, it would destroy my business. Yeah, we get texts, we get emails,</p>
<p>we get phone calls that we have to answer. And so it&rsquo;s not it, you know, almost definitionally</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t an option to just walk away. But for those who it is, and if that&rsquo;s their choice,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is. The great thing about freedom isn&rsquo;t that you can say whatever you want,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that you don&rsquo;t have to listen to what anyone else is saying. And you know,</p>
<p>that disagree with Joe, I feel like you always have the option to not listen. And you always</p>
<p>have the option to walk away and unfollow. And the whole idea of cancel culture and,</p>
<p>you know, punishing people for the things they say, regardless of what they say,</p>
<p>and the censorship and all the shutdown of voices and channels for people to have a voice.</p>
<p>I think it takes the freedom away that&rsquo;s inherent in the idea of, you know, your choice to not</p>
<p>listen. Yeah. And it&rsquo;s almost always totally hypocritical. So just as a postscript on the</p>
<p>whole Chappelle debate, it turns out that the leader of the anti Chappelle protests,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been trying to get him canceled at Netflix, it turns out this, this person</p>
<p>has like a treasure trove of the most angry, hateful, vile tweets that I or anybody has</p>
<p>never seen. When you put it in the group chat, I thought that that was a joke. The</p>
<p>things that she wrote were so beyond the pale beyond. Oh my God. They&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like the worst 20 of them on the show. No, we can&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t even want anybody to speak</p>
<p>these things. I don&rsquo;t want to include it in the show notes. They&rsquo;re literally the worst tweets.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the worst tweets I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Seriously. Like completely racist. Like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen such explicit racism in the 21st century, basically, aside from these tweets. And,</p>
<p>and this is a person who&rsquo;s trying to cancel Chappelle was out there with the megaphone,</p>
<p>and who the press was fawning over, by the way, and she said in her thing,</p>
<p>yeah, those were from a long time ago. I&rsquo;ve already owned up to those. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wait. But owned up how owned up how? And it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, let me play the empathy</p>
<p>card on me. But then, you know, I so meaning I expect you to see through what I&rsquo;m going through.</p>
<p>And that those expressions were in a moment in time. So see past them and see my true character.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s asking. That&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s asking the world to do, you know, about her.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re not willing to do it to any for anybody else. And that&rsquo;s where I think that double</p>
<p>standard just doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. And I think this is what people are getting really fed up with.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. And I would also say that her tweets weren&rsquo;t funny. They weren&rsquo;t attempting to be</p>
<p>Oh, my God, they are so gross.</p>
<p>I have a customer service problem with this beeping beep.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re so bad.</p>
<p>I want to bash I want to bash this, you know, beeping,</p>
<p>Asian or whatever, over the head, blah, blah, blah, blah, like a lot of racism towards Asia,</p>
<p>you know, Asian people.</p>
<p>No, there was homophobic tweets. There was a Asia, Asian hate tweets. I mean, it Latina,</p>
<p>Hispanic. I mean, it was</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t even trying to be funny. That&rsquo;s the thing. It wasn&rsquo;t even it wasn&rsquo;t even a</p>
<p>failed attempt at humor. So you hear you have Chappelle, who I think is dishing it out in an</p>
<p>equal opportunity way, making, you know, funny observations about really, he&rsquo;s criticizing</p>
<p>our culture, not specific groups. And he&rsquo;s being deliberately misinterpreted</p>
<p>by the people who want to cancel him. They&rsquo;re really to think that Chappelle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>standup routine is hateful really requires, I think, deliberate</p>
<p>obtuseness, you have to deliberately misinterpret what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>And so you have these people out there trying to do that. And meanwhile, they are guilty of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a total act of projection, because they are guilty of everything they accused Chappelle of.</p>
<p>Well, not all of them, this person in particular,</p>
<p>the leader, the leader. And of course, the press doesn&rsquo;t dig any of this up. It all happens through</p>
<p>the through kind of internet sleuths.</p>
<p>That would be a narrative violation, David, if somebody is virtue signaling, and they are</p>
<p>leading a cancellation movement. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of a narrative violation to say,</p>
<p>well, they maybe they should be canceled by the same standard, or, you know, quite easily. I think</p>
<p>the thing that I don&rsquo;t think she should get canceled. Let&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>she should be canceled. But I and this when she was drunk, nervous. I can only imagine that the</p>
<p>difficult path that this lady has gone through. And on the off chance that she&rsquo;s listening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally cool with your journey. I understand you made some mistakes. We&rsquo;ve all</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to let you off the hook. Can you please try to let the next person off the hook?</p>
<p>I think that would be a nice place for everybody to aim to go and then</p>
<p>and just to circle back with with Joe, when he started explaining himself in the thread,</p>
<p>when it became a conversation with a wider group of people, the journalists went on the pure dung</p>
<p>cancellation route. But then there was actually a productive discussion about between CEOs, etc.</p>
<p>And I thought what was very interesting about it was he started talking to Gary Tan, who,</p>
<p>you know, was like, listen, we have a four month leave practice at our venture firm. And Joe said,</p>
<p>do you really take 100% off cold turkey? Or did you work part time and stay in touch like a</p>
<p>responsible leader of your firm? And of course, Gary did just that, right. And then Joe says,</p>
<p>you know what, I shouldn&rsquo;t have written loser and appreciate the pushback in more intensive</p>
<p>operational context, losing key leaders cold turkey for six months seems unnecessary. But I</p>
<p>respect the different takes here. And I think that really is an actual good discussion about this is,</p>
<p>hey, well, maybe if you&rsquo;re an intense leader, and you don&rsquo;t have the ability to take a couple of</p>
<p>months off, well, maybe you should take a couple of Fridays off. And then there was a really</p>
<p>interesting discussion. What&rsquo;s better for a leader to do, spend a little more time every year,</p>
<p>or to spend three or four or six months in the beginning when you&rsquo;re, as you just said,</p>
<p>Chamath on the periphery here and trying to be helpful on the margins. Maybe for the secondary</p>
<p>person, if it isn&rsquo;t 5050 sacks, it is actually better for you to pick up some Fridays or</p>
<p>whatever, and take over the whole</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you read that clarification by Joe, because I think what he basically is saying</p>
<p>is that, yeah, he, the initial language he used, he would he basically clarified that.</p>
<p>And it sounds like what he&rsquo;s saying is, listen, if you&rsquo;re on a high performance team, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the star player, and you disappear for six months, that&rsquo;s going to cause your team to lose.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s maybe what he was saying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a perfect analogy sacks, because if we were looking at LeBron James or Kevin Durant,</p>
<p>and they had a baby midseason, or Draymond had a baby midseason, which I&rsquo;m sure has happened to</p>
<p>you know, folks, it&rsquo;s not like they say, I&rsquo;m not playing the next six months of games,</p>
<p>they miss one game, maybe two, they go back on the road. And I think everybody understands like,</p>
<p>yeah, you can&rsquo;t give up one of your 10 primary years or three years left that LeBron and KD</p>
<p>have left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one final anecdote to end this chapter of our discussion today. 2007 at Facebook,</p>
<p>at one point in like one of the umpteen reorgs we were doing as we were trying to get out of the</p>
<p>primordial ooze, I was in charge of HR. And everybody at that company was young, except</p>
<p>for a handful of people. And then there was finally a person. And I think it was our this HR</p>
<p>person that that at some through some weird convolution of events reported to me who got</p>
<p>pregnant, who was pregnant. And we didn&rsquo;t have a policy because nobody had ever gotten pregnant</p>
<p>before. And, you know, I remember saying, Oh, we have to come up with a policy. And what I did was</p>
<p>I was like, well, what would I want? Which is the easiest way for me to answer most questions.</p>
<p>And I came up with four months for either the father or the mother, irrespective of the context.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we started the original policy. Four years later, though, when I had my first kid,</p>
<p>I took like three weeks and it came back because the grind was too hard.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right. I think I think where we have to go is it&rsquo;s been a crazy week of</p>
<p>the reconciliation bill, the infrastructure bill and how to pay for this incredible spending.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a meta week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a meta week. I mean, and this builds on top of our discussions about inflation,</p>
<p>as well as the supply chain issues that builds on the conversation we had about COVID and the</p>
<p>new president. So we&rsquo;re trying to get the wealth. We&rsquo;re trying to get the reconciliation bill done.</p>
<p>And part of that is, hey, how is this going to get paid for? And in the course of one week,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen the tax proposals flip, I think multiple times to ones that have never been</p>
<p>tested and may not even be legal in the United States. Of course, I&rsquo;m referring to a billionaire</p>
<p>tax, which was proposed, which would be a penalty or a tax on assets that are liquid,</p>
<p>but that have not yet been sold. And it would look back three years, essentially going after</p>
<p>Bezos or Elon, Larry, Sergey, basically going after the top 10 billionaires in the world.</p>
<p>And then maybe it was going to be the top 700, then it became a millionaire tax,</p>
<p>all of this to try to pay for these bills. While so much money has been poured into the system</p>
<p>that NFTs and stocks are going through the roof, where do we want to begin gentlemen? Does anybody</p>
<p>have thoughts on this brief billionaire tax that was floated and what that says</p>
<p>about where we are as a country in terms of how we think about the success of our greatest</p>
<p>entrepreneurs, we want to talk about what&rsquo;s fair, or the process?</p>
<p>Well, I thought the process was insane. And what was crazy was that, you know, Ron Wyden had been</p>
<p>working on this proposal theoretically for the past two years. And at no point did he bother to</p>
<p>float the trial balloon with his colleagues in the Senate to even see whether these people</p>
<p>to even see whether these people actually supported it, beyond some folks on the progressive left,</p>
<p>who are ideologically fixated on, you know, this confiscatory way of running the country.</p>
<p>The funniest thing about that bill to me, and I let the powers that be know this is,</p>
<p>hey, guys, I&rsquo;ve always been on the record, I&rsquo;m happy to pay whatever tax you want,</p>
<p>I feel super blessed to be in America, whatever we want me to pay 30% 80% I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>But I had a real issue with the way that bill was written, because I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>the democrats are writing a bill that will disproportionately tax democratic,</p>
<p>successful billionaires. And it&rsquo;ll leave intact the coax, who is literally the boogeyman to the</p>
<p>progressive left who wants to write this bill. And I thought, how could you even write this</p>
<p>bill this way? It is so stupid. You&rsquo;re saying because those people own private assets,</p>
<p>and this goes out guys, guys like me would have been paying billions of dollars. And the coax</p>
<p>would not have paid zero because their entities are private. Yes, or public? Yes. So the audience</p>
<p>understand? Yes. How insane is that? And yet we&rsquo;re the ones that is a great second order observation.</p>
<p>So people clearly didn&rsquo;t think through that was my only issue with the thing. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if you want to try to ram and jam this thing through, go ahead and try. I&rsquo;m not going to be</p>
<p>the one that that, you know, files a lawsuit the day after it&rsquo;s passed, and takes it to the Supreme</p>
<p>Court, which will get heard. And, you know, this conservative Supreme Court would not have allowed</p>
<p>this, this tax to stand, you can&rsquo;t target 700 people. But by the way, the reason you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>target 700, because there&rsquo;s a slippery slope from 700 to 7 million to 70 million. And what it does</p>
<p>is it allows tax and spend politicians, a blank ledger to go absolutely crazy, and just fund every</p>
<p>single harebrained pork barrel scheme that they can come up with. And that&rsquo;s really what we stopped</p>
<p>was an important slippery slope. And then in its place, I think is a tax that is fair. A simple</p>
<p>surtax on adjusted gross income. If you&rsquo;re above x, you pay 5 million. And if you&rsquo;re above y,</p>
<p>you pay another three. So 8% 5% percent on every kind of income. And I think like, that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>reasonable way to get folks to pay more. That seems like a good start. But the first version</p>
<p>of the bill was so stupid. And the thing that really anchored me, though, was it targeted</p>
<p>democratic successful people, and left alone republican successful people written by the</p>
<p>democrats freebird, what are your thoughts on the confiscatory nature of this? I&rsquo;ve never heard the</p>
<p>word used that way confiscatory, where we&rsquo;re going back and saying, Listen, you want so much,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just going to take 20 or 30%. We all pay property taxes. So we there is a</p>
<p>experience we&rsquo;ve all had with paying a percentage of some of assets that we own,</p>
<p>people of all income brackets every year to your local government, to fund local services that</p>
<p>everyone participates in. So, you know, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unfounded. Now, if you look at history</p>
<p>as a guide, you know, France introduced a wealth tax to people making over, I think it was 1.3</p>
<p>million euro per year. And it was shut down and came back basically 1999 2000. And between the</p>
<p>year 2000 and the year 2016 25% of millionaire households emigrated out of France during this</p>
<p>period. And the amount of tax revenue that was lost during that period of time was greater than</p>
<p>the new revenue generated from the wealth tax that was introduced. And so France ultimately</p>
<p>scrapped the wealth tax. And there have been a number of other, you know, reasonably good</p>
<p>examples of European countries putting in place these wealth taxes, and then kind of removing them</p>
<p>later. So, you know, on the one hand, I think that we&rsquo;ve all seen this experience and Switzerland</p>
<p>does this, I think you get taxed on your total assets in Switzerland, you have to go negotiate</p>
<p>every year, with respect to how much you pay, it&rsquo;s a very weird process. So on the one hand,</p>
<p>there is this kind of experience and precedent for paying some percentage of assets. Sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a targeted asset, and sometimes it&rsquo;s not. But the longer range consequences that we&rsquo;ve seen is</p>
<p>like, you know, emigration, and people realize there&rsquo;s always a better choice. The chat, the</p>
<p>question we have in the United States, if we introduce a wealth tax like this, where will</p>
<p>successful Americans emigrate to? You can see how people could leave France and go to Belgium,</p>
<p>or go to the UK, or go to Switzerland, or go somewhere else where they might be better off.</p>
<p>Where are Americans going to move to? Canada.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a successful&hellip; Canada? I mean, are you going to move to Vancouver? I mean,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Canada, but Zach, would you move? You know, where would you move to?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s almost like there ends up being this kind of,</p>
<p>you know, I think, really interesting experiment that will be run here. Now,</p>
<p>remember, this wealth tax was introduced by Warren and others last year. So, this wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>some new concept that was fly by night. This has been one of those things that&rsquo;s been on the shelf</p>
<p>for a while. What happened is they pulled it down from the shelf and said, let&rsquo;s try this now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never had committee hearings on it. They&rsquo;ve never had committee markups on it. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been tried and repealed in European countries. And like you said, they pull it down on the 11th hour.</p>
<p>Why? Because their carefully laid plans, which they&rsquo;ve been concocting for three months,</p>
<p>were thrown overboard when Sinema said she wouldn&rsquo;t support the rate increases.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know why they wouldn&rsquo;t go to her at the beginning of the process instead of waiting</p>
<p>until the end of the process. But so, because of that, they&rsquo;re scrambling around trying to find</p>
<p>any source of revenue. So, it&rsquo;s, oh, well, a billionaire tax work? No. Well, what about a</p>
<p>corporate AMT? How about that? No. What about a millionaire surcharge? These guys are like</p>
<p>burglars, rummaging through the house. They hear the sirens coming and they&rsquo;re like, what can we</p>
<p>take? Oh, the TVs are bolted down. Can&rsquo;t get that. Where&rsquo;s the jewelry? What can we take?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, you can&rsquo;t set tax policy this way. And this whole idea that we can set tax policy</p>
<p>based on our intuitions of fairness without having hearings to ask the question of what</p>
<p>will this do to the economy? How much damage will it cause? This is absurd.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s really important to note, the market is telling Congress something here. And</p>
<p>the market is members of Congress informed by their, their constituents. The market is saying,</p>
<p>maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be spending this much, because there isn&rsquo;t a place to fund it. And no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>raising their hand and saying, this is something we can all align on. And so I think the more</p>
<p>important fundamental question is, are we really equipped? And do we really have a general economic</p>
<p>interest, economic interest, meaning people measure things and vote with dollars to support</p>
<p>these sorts of social programs? And it seems to me the indication is no. And this seems to me to</p>
<p>be primarily a response of the pendulum swinging the other way, post the Trump era, where you know,</p>
<p>the Trump era was all about blowing up these ineffective, overregulated, bloated government</p>
<p>infrastructure and programs and people and, and bureaucracies. And now we&rsquo;ve kind of found</p>
<p>ourselves through our voted representatives swinging this other way. But it turns out,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ve swung too far in the market is now voting and saying, this just isn&rsquo;t a playing field</p>
<p>we should be on. And so you know, where they end up here, I think, regardless, it&rsquo;s gonna end up</p>
<p>needing to be some sort of reconciliation on spending to make this all work.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were did not win the nomination. The</p>
<p>country specifically wanted a moderate Biden was sold as a moderate go back to the way it was</p>
<p>moderate Dems, like Clinton, like Obama, this is the classic Coca Cola, this isn&rsquo;t new Pepsi</p>
<p>nonsense. And we got hoodwinked, basically. And I think what a lot of democrats are seeing now,</p>
<p>especially the moderate ones, is, hey, wait a second, Biden is Warren and Bernie in sheep&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clothing, perhaps. And we didn&rsquo;t want this, this, we didn&rsquo;t want Trump, he was too hot.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t want this to left crazy. Let&rsquo;s just take everybody&rsquo;s money randomly change the tax</p>
<p>code. I don&rsquo;t think American citizens want to live in a world where we change tax code at the</p>
<p>11th hour. That is scary to people, all people, people who have savings if you care about the</p>
<p>economy. But I think these progressives so so it used to be that taxation was a necessary evil.</p>
<p>You you you tax people because you got to pay for government and government programs. Everybody</p>
<p>hates it, but but you do it and you try to figure out the way of achieving the revenue government</p>
<p>needs in the least destructive way possible. But I think progressives now they&rsquo;re so focused</p>
<p>and monomaniacal about this issue of income inequality, the fact that there&rsquo;s some people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve gotten richer than everybody else, that I think they&rsquo;re willing to tax those people.</p>
<p>I mean, they would like to siphon off money from those people, I think they would siphon it off</p>
<p>just to light it on fire, just to level people. And so they don&rsquo;t really care what the impact</p>
<p>is going to be on the economy. Well, I mean, and it was in fact,</p>
<p>ban the billionaires, that was their roof. But you know, before we get to that, I just want to say,</p>
<p>these rules, I think Americans want the rules to be simple. And I don&rsquo;t think people want you</p>
<p>changing the rules at the last minute, and then making them retroactive. I think all Americans</p>
<p>want taxes to be predictable and simple, not just change them willy nilly, because you change</p>
<p>the budget. This seems so unthoughtful and crazy. Chamath your point.</p>
<p>I have two points to make. The first is that I don&rsquo;t think anybody really knows what&rsquo;s in these</p>
<p>bills. And as a result of nobody really knowing what&rsquo;s in these bills, they&rsquo;re used as negotiating</p>
<p>chits. So case in point, when Biden came out and said, you know, we have a $1.85 trillion bill now,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re ready to get this done so that he could, you know, fly to Europe, and, you know,</p>
<p>fly to COP 26, and kind of, you know, declare victory. Unfortunately, the progressive wing</p>
<p>of the Democratic Party in the house said, No, I&rsquo;m not ready to dance yet.</p>
<p>And, you know, they have consistently refused to sign an infrastructure bill,</p>
<p>until they got what they needed from this other bill. And so when Pelosi called the vote,</p>
<p>she had to pull it, because they weren&rsquo;t going to get the votes necessary to get this bill passed.</p>
<p>So what this says to me is that even with spending, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spending five, because that&rsquo;s a I think it&rsquo;s a trillion dollar bill, right? That&rsquo;s a $1 trillion</p>
<p>bill, this is a $1.875 trillion bill, nobody cares about the quantity. And nobody cares about</p>
<p>the details. They care about some perceived moral victory. This is the only reason why we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>this, you know, Mexican standoff that we&rsquo;re seeing today, if these things were so substantively</p>
<p>important, we would have passed the first bill, we would have negotiated a reasonable second</p>
<p>version and pass that to instead, we&rsquo;re here going through the end of the year with nothing done.</p>
<p>And I just want, you know, the democratic leadership who listens to this, because we</p>
<p>know a lot of people in Washington listen to this podcast. You guys got to get something done.</p>
<p>Because if you go into the midterms with nothing done, with a democratic president,</p>
<p>Democratic Senate and Democratic House, this is going to be a bloodbath.</p>
<p>Well, this is why something will will get done. But, you know, I think the political realities</p>
<p>are that at the end of the day, the democrats will come together and pass something.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s concerning that we&rsquo;re just talking about doing something because it will help you in the</p>
<p>midterms. You know, in the immortal words of Nancy Pelosi, you have to vote for the bill in order to</p>
<p>find out what&rsquo;s in it. I mean, at the end of the day, we&rsquo;re not even going to know what&rsquo;s in this</p>
<p>thing. And, you know, we&rsquo;re spending another, it&rsquo;ll probably end up being a $1.75 trillion bill,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be stacked on top of the spending that&rsquo;s already happened. One point, remember,</p>
<p>Biden already passed 1.9 trillion of COVID relief, another 1.2 trillion of infrastructure.</p>
<p>No, that hasn&rsquo;t passed yet.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s going to along with this now 1.75 million, sorry, 1.75 trillion</p>
<p>of this new social spending bill, assuming</p>
<p>right, so it&rsquo;s about $5 trillion, $5 trillion wealth redistribution.</p>
<p>Progressives will have will have set the stage for this to be perceived as some sort of failure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by the way, David, if you go back, then if you take that 5 trillion and add it to the</p>
<p>all the COVID before and all of the, the Fed buying, we&rsquo;ve probably had one entire turn of GDP.</p>
<p>So call it 20 to $22 trillion of money created in the last three or four years.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Now you go back. So now, so now you go back to Jason, what you started,</p>
<p>the thing that I have struggled with the most in these last few weeks,</p>
<p>is trying to come to a conclusion on inflation. My worry is that it&rsquo;s here and it will be persistent.</p>
<p>And inflation comes in two ways. Way number one is if you massively increase the supply of money.</p>
<p>Why? Let&rsquo;s just say the economy at $100. And now all of a sudden, you just print another 100. So</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s $200. What will happen is all of the goods and services that make up that 100</p>
<p>will get repriced to absorb the 200. So prices go up, inflation goes up.</p>
<p>The second way that inflation can happen is if middle and lower income people buy and spend,</p>
<p>because when rich people have extra money, they just buy financial assets. That&rsquo;s why you get</p>
<p>financial bubbles. But practical goods and services are bought by average, everyday,</p>
<p>normal working folks, and their wages are going up. And so I think what we&rsquo;ve created is a really</p>
<p>distortive inflationary cycle. That&rsquo;s going to really hurt the United States, because as</p>
<p>Sachs talked about, we cannot print enough money to pay for the debt when interest rates go up.</p>
<p>This is the number one thing causing me concern as well is that you look around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all time highs for everything. It&rsquo;s all time best everything. NASDAQ and S&amp;P,</p>
<p>all time highs, crypto markets, all time highs, Shibu Inu worth $30, $40 billion bubble.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing SAS multiples. Real estate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing SAS multiples at all time highs. So you have to wonder, is this a new normal? Is</p>
<p>this sustainable? Or is it some sort of inflated bubble? Then you look at the inflation rates,</p>
<p>5.1%. To Chamath&rsquo;s point, it might be persistent. You look at treasury, the treasury interest rates,</p>
<p>the yield is 1.6% on the 10-year T-bill. So effectively, your real interest rate for savers</p>
<p>is 1.6% minus the 5.1% inflation rate. You&rsquo;re at negative 3.5% if you just save your money</p>
<p>in T-bills, you take the risk-free return, negative 3.5%. So now you have everybody</p>
<p>going out there trying to chase yield, because how do you earn a return on your money?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want it to be&hellip; You buy stocks or NFTs or houses.</p>
<p>So people start going into riskier and riskier assets to basically try and make up for the loss</p>
<p>of inflation. And so you have to wonder&hellip; They&rsquo;re trying to hit the one-outer.</p>
<p>Yeah, so then, okay, so you have to ask yourself, okay, so back to this point about all time highs,</p>
<p>is this because everything is really this great? Or how much of this is driven</p>
<p>by these sort of distortions? 50-50. I mean, I&rsquo;m just putting a number</p>
<p>on it. Obviously, the industry and economy is doing fantastic, but it seems 50-50.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the other thing that I wanted to make in just the last portion, which is,</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;ve realized as well, at the end of this, is I actually, again,</p>
<p>now to use this empathy card, I&rsquo;m going to give the progressives my empathy card and say,</p>
<p>I understand what you&rsquo;re trying to do. And I believe in a lot of what you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is to even the starting line for everybody. Right now, a lot of what you end up proposing</p>
<p>distorts that goal by trying to even out the outcomes and even the finish line. But I really</p>
<p>do think they want to even the starting line. But here&rsquo;s the thing that we all have to realize</p>
<p>now. All the things that the progressives want to tax and fund are actually being done by private</p>
<p>corporations. And I think we just have to acknowledge that and make a decision about</p>
<p>whether as a society that&rsquo;s okay or not. I&rsquo;ll give you two examples. Number one is the federal</p>
<p>minimum wage. We have tried for years and we have debated raising this minimum wage. It still</p>
<p>sits today at $7.25. Just this week, McDonald&rsquo;s moved their minimum wage up. Starbucks moved</p>
<p>their minimum wage up. We&rsquo;re talking about, you know, entry level quick service jobs that now pay</p>
<p>17 to $25 per hour. Right, so two and a half to three plus times the proposed federal minimum</p>
<p>wage. And so what government didn&rsquo;t and wasn&rsquo;t able to do, the free markets have done. Second</p>
<p>example, we tried to get free community college inside of one of these bills, it was dropped.</p>
<p>Now, depending on where you go, the nation&rsquo;s largest employer, Amazon, actually will just</p>
<p>pay you to go to college. Right? So they are replacing that intention and a version of the</p>
<p>GI Bill, but as a private organization. So I think what we also have to realize is that maybe</p>
<p>some of these policy decisions is actually a little bit of, you know, getting tilted by the</p>
<p>fact that private organizations are acting more nimbly to actually implement this progressive</p>
<p>agenda, because it actually exists in America, if you&rsquo;re willing to take the time to look,</p>
<p>let me ask a question about inflation, if who is inflation going to hurt the most,</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s going to gain the most from it, because it does seem like consumables,</p>
<p>gas station, you know, supermarket trips, etc, are going through the roof. In that case,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s going to have no impact on the top third of people because gallon of milk at</p>
<p>three, six, $9 doesn&rsquo;t matter. But then you look at inflation on stocks, it&rsquo;s going to make it go</p>
<p>up. So a rich person isn&rsquo;t impacted by their gas or their groceries, but somebody in the middle</p>
<p>class or who&rsquo;s poor, that&rsquo;s going to dramatically impact them. So if we spend more, does that</p>
<p>actually create a larger wealth gap sacks like inflation is devastating for the middle class.</p>
<p>If you have savings, it if you can afford to put all of your savings and financial assets the way</p>
<p>that the super wealthy can, then your financial assets will go up. But if you have a good you</p>
<p>sort of middle class income, and you don&rsquo;t have your in your savings or in something more</p>
<p>conservative, you&rsquo;re going to get absolutely eroded by inflation over time, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>kill you. And, you know, housing prices will go up the the, the middle class young couple that wants</p>
<p>to buy a house for the first time, that&rsquo;s going to be much harder to achieve, because housing prices</p>
<p>will inflate away. So I think, you know, there is there are some effects that are awash. So for</p>
<p>example, prices go up, and then wages go up at the same time. But savings can really get hammered</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not in financial assets. It hurts the middle class first, but it also hurts. It hurts</p>
<p>everybody. Because again, unless you&rsquo;re perfectly hedged going into a rising rate environment,</p>
<p>you will own assets that are just a good question.</p>
<p>Friedberg a scientific question here, are we starting to go into a self fulfilling prophecy</p>
<p>around inflation? Allah what happened in the 70s, which is, we&rsquo;ve been talking about it so much,</p>
<p>that anybody who is thinking about raising prices as well, everybody else is raising prices.</p>
<p>So even if my grilled cheese sandwich hasn&rsquo;t been impacted by all of this, and I didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>give raises to my employees, they&rsquo;re happy at their current salaries, I&rsquo;m just gonna put $2</p>
<p>on my grilled cheese. And we just get this cycle of everybody saying, how much can I add to the</p>
<p>cost of something I am trying to remember, there was an earnings interview I saw yesterday,</p>
<p>God, which was the company? Anyway, their company in the industrial supply chain,</p>
<p>and he said that they&rsquo;re raising rates to get ahead of the supply costs going up for them,</p>
<p>so that their margins won&rsquo;t get squeezed. And I think that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s almost like that,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re referencing is a little bit of a run on the bank mentality, where those with</p>
<p>pricing power, raise rate raise prices. And as a result, you end up kind of seeing the trickling</p>
<p>effects because competition can&rsquo;t catch up. So if everyone&rsquo;s kind of raising rates, and there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>enough competitive advantage, the one thing that&rsquo;s making this even harder right now is the gluts in</p>
<p>the supply chain, which are reducing the competitive market dynamics that we might normally see where</p>
<p>one customer raises, one company raises rates, and another company says, wait, our rates are</p>
<p>going to stay the same. But because so many people are challenged by getting product,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s enough demand for their product, everyone can raise rates together. We&rsquo;re seeing this in</p>
<p>the energy markets now. So yeah, I mean, this is kind of part of the scary scenario that everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to manage against. So I don&rsquo;t know what the science is. And I&rsquo;m not an economist. But</p>
<p>it certainly seems to me, like the psychology of managers and business owners and boards is such</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re saying, let&rsquo;s get ahead of the curve, let&rsquo;s raise rates. And as a result,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing the trickling effect of inflation throughout the whole economy. So I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>both Gary sex, what do you think psychologically is going on with raising prices? Yeah,</p>
<p>so so expectations are definitely part of the inflation game. People raise prices if they</p>
<p>expect inflation in the near future. And then that feeds on itself. And that&rsquo;s how if you look at</p>
<p>countries that have had hyperinflation, that&rsquo;s how you get a spiral. Now, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have hyperinflation here. But we&rsquo;re at 5.1%. Now, if people think it&rsquo;s going to be worse next</p>
<p>year, and the Fed&rsquo;s not going to raise rates, it could even be higher next year. And I think people</p>
<p>are going to start getting upset about this. You know, when they buy their Thanksgiving turkey and</p>
<p>their Christmas ham, and those prices are way higher than they think, and they&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>paying gas prices that are a lot higher than they&rsquo;re used to. I think you could see a lot</p>
<p>of unhappiness out there. One of the thing I&rsquo;m thinking about is, is the logical thing for a</p>
<p>person to do in this hyperinflationary, you know, market is to say, you know what,</p>
<p>these, I went to look at a car, and I wanted to get to drive in the snow. And I was like,</p>
<p>you know what, I&rsquo;m just gonna hold off buying this because I&rsquo;m not paying 15k over sticker.</p>
<p>So and I can pay for different series. I was like, do I want to do that? The other cars? Okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just put snow tires on it. So are a lot of people chemoth and as part of this psychological,</p>
<p>you know, spiraling out of control situation, then some group of people might say, you know what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to opt out of consumerism. And I&rsquo;m just going to lower my burn rate and stop consuming,</p>
<p>which is also bad for the stop consuming food. Now,</p>
<p>instead of getting, you know, filet mignon, you might get chicken.</p>
<p>Okay, well, there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of unhappy people who are eating chicken for Christmas</p>
<p>instead of like, I mean, serious, I&rsquo;m coming to your house. I&rsquo;m good. I&rsquo;m gonna go your</p>
<p>house for lunch. And I&rsquo;m going to mods for the surf and turf aft guys.</p>
<p>Rich people don&rsquo;t create inflation. The middle class and lower middle class create inflation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just not enough rich people to matter. They&rsquo;re irrelevant. So when you look at the last</p>
<p>two or three spikes and waves of risk that we&rsquo;ve seen globally, they&rsquo;ve come from large</p>
<p>multi 100 million person cohorts of people, right? Those could be in Asia, those could be</p>
<p>specifically in China, those could be in the United States, plus all around the world because</p>
<p>of certain loose monetary conditions. That&rsquo;s what we have. Now, we have a multi 100 million,</p>
<p>probably approaching more than a billion person strong, liquid buying pool of people that are</p>
<p>again, as I said, if the if the lowest on the pecking order is now making 17 bucks an hour,</p>
<p>we all know this, guys, it&rsquo;s not as if the inflation stops at 50,000 bucks a year,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s wages rise. So consistent and persistent wage inflation will allow you to</p>
<p>spend more because that&rsquo;s just what people do. We also have high savings rates. So people will feel</p>
<p>more flush with money. The point is that everybody will spend, they will spend more,</p>
<p>you know, you can&rsquo;t get cars, you can&rsquo;t get this, you can&rsquo;t get that all this pent up demand will</p>
<p>get fed. And the downstream implication is I think that prices will rise, but it will</p>
<p>disproportionately hurt the middle class and the lower middle class. And then these asset bubbles</p>
<p>will probably deflate, or they&rsquo;ll have to get rerated. And if the Fed stops tapering, and you</p>
<p>know, hikes rates two or three times over the next 12 or 18 months, man, this is an ugly, ugly</p>
<p>stock market. One of the things people have been asking me to ask all of us on the pod is what are</p>
<p>our strategies right now given the turmoil we&rsquo;re in? So maybe we can go around the horn. And what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re thinking about in terms of our strategies to deal with inflation, while maybe not getting</p>
<p>ahead of our skis and being the bag holders? Anybody have?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna answer this question. And you know why? Because I can&rsquo;t got it. Okay,</p>
<p>because of the public market. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t want to even answer this question yet.</p>
<p>Okay, well, can I offer me further describe the problem. So this happened in the late 1970s. We</p>
<p>had stagflation we had sort of every year we had increasing inflation because the expectation game</p>
<p>and the thing that broke it was you had Paul Volcker come in at the Fed and he jacked up</p>
<p>interest rates. And he actually caused a pretty severe recession in like 80. I think it was like</p>
<ol start="82">
<li>81 82. I think by 83, we&rsquo;re coming out of it. And then the economy absolutely boomed interest</li>
</ol>
<p>rates came way down because he broke the back of inflation. And actually interest rates came down</p>
<p>for you know, as a result of Volcker and the Fed controlling inflation, they came down for</p>
<p>4040 years, basically. And those that decrease in interest rates, fueled everything, it made debt a</p>
<p>lot cheaper, it, it made the stock market boom, because the net present value, the discount rate</p>
<p>went down. So the net present value of all those future earnings went up. So you had it set the</p>
<p>stage for the boom in the Reagan era, and beyond and the Clinton era as well. Now, what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>difference between that and now? Well, for one thing, the government debt as a percentage of GDP,</p>
<p>when Reagan took office was around 31%. Okay. So when Volcker jacked up interest rates,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t really create that much more of a debt service costs for the United States for</p>
<p>the federal government. Now, today, the the government debt is 125% of GDP. So if and this</p>
<p>goes back to the to the Druckenmiller point from previous pod, if the the Fed were to jack up</p>
<p>interest rates to say the historical norm of 4.9%, debt service would go from 2% of the federal budget</p>
<p>to 30%. You would have a massive crowding out of government programs. So how we fund all that</p>
<p>debt service, very unclear. So we&rsquo;re caught between a rock and a hard place. The rock is we</p>
<p>have inflation that could be persistent. The hard place is the debt service. So you know, the tools</p>
<p>for controlling this aren&rsquo;t exactly clear. So this I think is fundamentally the problem is it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>clear whether we&rsquo;re going to have, you know, interest rates going up or persistent high</p>
<p>inflation. Those are the threats to the sort of economic boom we&rsquo;re seeing. Now the flip side of</p>
<p>it is that the reason why the stock market is one of the reasons is that an all time highs because</p>
<p>earnings right now are fantastic. So the economy is doing very, the companies are doing very well.</p>
<p>But we just had for Q3, the GDP growth was at 2% annualized, which was sort of an anemic number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the lowest it&rsquo;s been since this COVID recovery started. So it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at all time highs, but there&rsquo;s also these like major storm clouds on the horizon.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to like pretend like I know what&rsquo;s going to happen. I just,</p>
<p>you know, when when things are this good, I start getting nervous when it&rsquo;s this easy to make money</p>
<p>across everything, the stock market, the crypto market, the SaaS investing we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the part that really scares me. So for example, when everybody gets tilted,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some Shiba wallet, where 8000 turns into 5.7 billion, right. So for those that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, there was a, you know, Shiba Inu coin, which is a shit coin, which was basically</p>
<p>there to ape the other shit coin, Dogecoin, the Dogecoin, right, a meme coin, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>some guy 13 months ago, put 8k into it, because the whole market cap was 80k. And then all of a</p>
<p>sudden, over the course of these 400 days, that wallet holds $5.7 billion of value or 10% the</p>
<p>entire market cap of Shiba. People get tilted by that. Then there was an article today in Bloomberg,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a gentleman, a 66 year old man in Singapore, who&rsquo;s a billionaire, right,</p>
<p>so he was successful in his own right. However, he had made in his entire career about one or 2</p>
<p>billion. And he has made 7 billion in the last two years, speculating on Tesla call options.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not kidding. So buying short dated calls, right, riding the riding the wave, making money,</p>
<p>allocating the gains, buying the underlying Tesla security, over and over and over again. And so,</p>
<p>you know, I was talking to Nat about this, and I was telling her these, these examples,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s what sounds like a bubble. Because it really is very difficult to be in</p>
<p>business and to make these decisions and to be reasonable. Also, if you&rsquo;re a capital allocator,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a capital allocator, or you&rsquo;re building companies, like, how do you know if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>a good job, if everybody just is, I&rsquo;m gonna be right back, guys, I have to I have to do the</p>
<p>goods. Yeah, okay. Got a quick baby change. I think what&rsquo;s hard about this is, okay, so one</p>
<p>of the areas where it&rsquo;s sort of like best times ever, are is the SAS market, which is where I</p>
<p>invest in. And I&rsquo;m obviously investing in very, very early stage companies. But we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>valuations now go to multiples of ARR that we&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>50, 75.</p>
<p>I would say 100 times, I&rsquo;d say 100 times ARR is sort of the rule of thumb right now.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>what scale a $5 million company is worth 500 million?</p>
<p>Anywhere from 1 million to 10 million. I mean, absolutely.</p>
<p>Is worth between 100 and a billion dollars, which makes no sense.</p>
<p>Well, no, it does. If well, let me give you the argument for why it could make sense. Okay,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the company is expected to go 3.3x this year, and 3x next year, that&rsquo;s basically a 10x</p>
<p>over the next two years. So that 100x in two years will only be a 10 times ARR multiple. And by the</p>
<p>way, if you look at the comps, for the companies that have gone public, the SAS companies have</p>
<p>gone public, like look at toast being worth what 30 40 billion. So they&rsquo;re trading at 30 40 50 60</p>
<p>times ARR in the public markets on big, big numbers. So my point is,</p>
<p>How hard is it to go 3x 3x? That is, I mean, going 3x is hard going 3x 3x back to back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like winning two and you know, NBA championships.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that hard. I mean,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for you, but you&rsquo;re the king of SAS.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m being dead serious for the for a SAX founder with a million to go from one to three,</p>
<p>and then three to nine. How many out of 100 actually go from one to nine?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you Yammer&rsquo;s trajectory. And this is this is over a decade old. We went from</p>
<p>1 million in our first full year selling the product to well, back in those days,</p>
<p>we looked at total contract value of 7 million of TCV, that was about 5 million of ARR. And then it</p>
<p>tripled the year after that. So, you know, and then we tripled the year after that.</p>
<p>Well, a category defining SAS company.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>Microsoft, but I&rsquo;m just saying that it&rsquo;s entirely possible. There&rsquo;s a lot more</p>
<p>Yammer&rsquo;s today or companies that growth trajectory. So I mean, but look, this is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>led to, you know, our fund to which we started investing in 2019, which has a SAS focus,</p>
<p>already has five unicorns in it from companies that we invested in the Cedar City.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So but look, I mean, when you&rsquo;re seeing, like results that good, where my head goes is,</p>
<p>okay, this is too good. You know, what am I missing here? Like, what&rsquo;s the downside? And</p>
<p>how long will this sustain?</p>
<p>Just to build your just to build on your point, there are these businesses that have,</p>
<p>I would say, interesting products that are growing well, but they may not actually be</p>
<p>very important companies. Yet they trade at enormous valuations. And then you have these</p>
<p>companies that are just so superb. And I&rsquo;m talking about Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook,</p>
<p>that now trade in many cases at some pretty deep discounts to their intrinsic value. But this is</p>
<p>the sign of this histrionic behavior that I think embellishes the end of a bubble, right? It&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>thing where you look at a growth rate, and you don&rsquo;t even ask the structural questions about</p>
<p>business quality, viability, sustainability, competitive modes, you&rsquo;re like, Oh, well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going from 300% market, you know, it&rsquo;s only decaying to 200%. I buy. Well, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>but yeah, but what are you buying? And is there any longevity and staying power? This is why,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve, I think there are some great businesses in SAS. But I also think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of head fakes. And in the public markets, particularly people just want to buy that growth,</p>
<p>as David said, because they&rsquo;re chasing yield. They&rsquo;re not, you know, do they really understand</p>
<p>am I buying this company, because I really believe in this database technology versus</p>
<p>that streaming technology versus this container technology. They don&rsquo;t know any of those things.</p>
<p>Well, so this is the conundrum is I actually do believe like, so I believe my own portfolio,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doubling down on all these companies. And I do believe in SAS. And I think the reason why</p>
<p>these SAS companies get such great multiples is because they&rsquo;re pure software businesses,</p>
<p>very high gross margins, 80% plus gross margins. You know, once the flywheel gets going, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very hard to displace. I mean, they have, it&rsquo;s not just a recurring revenue subscription type</p>
<p>business, but you get expansion out of your current customer base. So, you know, on January 1 of a new</p>
<p>year, you&rsquo;re starting with 120%, 150% of last year&rsquo;s revenue, just from your existing customers.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re stacking the new revenue courts on top of that. So I am a believer in SAS. But</p>
<p>when I see everything going so well, it&rsquo;s SAS and NASDAQ and S&amp;P and crypto. And then I see,</p>
<p>you know, 125% debt to GDP and the sort of radical spending that&rsquo;s coming out of Washington.</p>
<p>I just start getting nervous. And I don&rsquo;t know if I have like a prescription for people out there.</p>
<p>I would just be a little bit cautious right now and temper your enthusiasm. But look,</p>
<p>the flip side of it is, we could keep having a boom for five more years, you know? And so,</p>
<p>the market could keep going for five more years. And so, what do you do? Sit it out while inflation</p>
<p>is going through the roof? No, you can&rsquo;t sit it out. You can&rsquo;t sit it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t sit it out. But, you know, I was listening to Vinnie Lingham&rsquo;s</p>
<p>show on Beep on Call In. It&rsquo;s called Crypto Musings.</p>
<p>There we go. No, he and Sonny Madre do a great show that you guys-</p>
<p>I think we all just got 25 bips.</p>
<p>You guys should all listen to his show. It&rsquo;s called Crypto Musings. They were talking about</p>
<p>all the dog coins the other night. It was Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, and there&rsquo;s a couple others.</p>
<p>Vinnie made a great point. He said, listen, if you&rsquo;re out there listening and you&rsquo;re sitting</p>
<p>on life-changing money and Shiba Inu, sell. Take it off the table if you can.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Keywords being if you can. So, look, this boom could last for another five years. It could</p>
<p>last for another 10 years. And the valuations could keep going up. The earnings could keep going.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to miss out on that bull run. But if you&rsquo;ve got life-changing money</p>
<p>in a highly risky position-</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not diversified.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m amending my advice of let your winners ride to take some chips off the table prudently.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean you sell everything, but just take some chips off the table.</p>
<p>To diversify specifically.</p>
<p>Diversify, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s absolutely-</p>
<p>I mean, I got to say, when you saw these quarterly earnings,</p>
<p>there is no better business in the world than Google. Single-handedly par excellence,</p>
<p>the most incredible money-making machine that&rsquo;s ever been created.</p>
<p>And a close second, as it turns out, is Microsoft.</p>
<p>Unbelievable. I mean, just to-</p>
<p>Which is now the most valuable company in the world, greater than Apple.</p>
<p>Well, and Friedberg&rsquo;s been saying this on the podcast forever, but</p>
<p>just to give people an idea, Q3 revenue at Google was up 41% year over year.</p>
<p>To $65 billion in a quarter.</p>
<p>And by the way, that is high margin.</p>
<p>High margin.</p>
<p>The incremental revenue on the core Google product</p>
<p>generated an increment, operated at an incremental 50% EBITDA margin.</p>
<p>And they just adjusted their CAPEX depreciation amortization schedule</p>
<p>because they realized that their computers that they use in their data centers last</p>
<p>four years instead of three.</p>
<p>And the networking equipment lasts five years instead of three.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re like, and I&rsquo;ve been saying this since the beginning,</p>
<p>because I worked at Google, and Urs is still there.</p>
<p>And he runs all the data centers and the networking infrastructure.</p>
<p>When I worked at Google, there was this amazing project</p>
<p>where we built a 10,000, we didn&rsquo;t build it, they built it, a 10,000 port switch</p>
<p>called Firehose, which helped increase the throughput of the data centers and</p>
<p>have these massively parallelized indexing and production servers.</p>
<p>And there was so much investment made from the beginning in building the</p>
<p>infrastructure stack, the flywheel continues to move, spin faster and faster and faster.</p>
<p>And here they are building their own servers, building their own racks,</p>
<p>their own data centers.</p>
<p>Literally the most&hellip; They have their own fiber across the oceans.</p>
<p>Literally the most vertically integrated business in history,</p>
<p>with a moat that no one will ever be able to catch up on.</p>
<p>And I read all these nonsense comments on the internet about people being like,</p>
<p>why doesn&rsquo;t someone else go after search?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so crazy to me.</p>
<p>People fail to recognize that what we see is the tip of the iceberg at Google.</p>
<p>And this flywheel is built by layers and layers of monopolistic, in a good way,</p>
<p>monopolistic technical advantages that they&rsquo;ve built into this business over</p>
<p>the period of the past two decades.</p>
<p>And it is extraordinary, beyond anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen in human history,</p>
<p>how well this commercial enterprise has run.</p>
<p>And the reinvestment of capital has been extraordinary.</p>
<p>If you look at YouTube in the quarter, YouTube generated&hellip; This is insanity.</p>
<p>YouTube is now operating at a nearly $30 billion revenue run rate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just like pure margin incremental revenue for Google,</p>
<p>layered on&hellip; Built off of the same ad network that they were originally running on Google.</p>
<p>Obviously, they have a different ad team now at YouTube.</p>
<p>But YouTube now has more revenue than Netflix and is growing at likely 40% to 60%</p>
<p>year over year revenue growth rate.</p>
<p>Whereas Netflix is considered one of the fang stocks, one of the top stocks.</p>
<p>And Netflix is only growing at 22%.</p>
<p>Sure, remove Netflix and just put Google twice. It should be&hellip;</p>
<p>And then you look at Google Cloud&hellip;</p>
<p>YouTube in there on its own.</p>
<p>And Google Cloud is now operating at a $20 billion run rate.</p>
<p>And they can just throw these services on top of all these flywheels that they&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>And they become massive enterprises unto themselves.</p>
<p>It is a behemoth that is effectively not a tax in a bad way, but a tax on the internet.</p>
<p>Because they are core infrastructure to service</p>
<p>almost everything that we all consume and use over the internet in some way or another.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they give it to everybody for free, and they build the internet for everybody.</p>
<p>They have been extremely smart about competitive pricing.</p>
<p>As we saw recently, they dropped the commission in the Play Store to 15%.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m making an app and I&rsquo;m giving Apple 30%, now I give Google 15%,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more inclined to promote my Android app and that&rsquo;s going to affect users.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re putting out this Pixel 6 phone that looks like an incredible piece of equipment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cheaper than the iPhone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re an incredible company.</p>
<p>They are so incredibly well run at the top.</p>
<p>Sundar is an incredible CEO.</p>
<p>And they are running a money printing press at Amphitheater Parkway in Mountain View.</p>
<p>I was going to say, Jason, to your point, I was talking to somebody.</p>
<p>And one really interesting thing that this organization did was a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>they basically went long Google and Microsoft, and they shorted Apple, Amazon and Facebook against it.</p>
<p>And I asked them why.</p>
<p>And they said, it&rsquo;s the best inflation hedge we could come up with at massive scale</p>
<p>that could work in a way where we&rsquo;re long growth, but we&rsquo;re hedged where the types of</p>
<p>supply constraints that could come in and kick us in the ass would never affect Microsoft and</p>
<p>Google the same way that it would affect Apple and Amazon, which, by the way, in their earnings</p>
<p>results, they said, right, Amazon has huge issues on the supply chain side.</p>
<p>Apple has huge issues on the supply chain side.</p>
<p>Amazon was up 15%.</p>
<p>They missed their numbers.</p>
<p>Although Amazon Web Services is a 40% year over year, also on a big number $16 billion in AWS</p>
<p>revenue for q3.</p>
<p>So that as a standalone company is now on a what do you what did you guys think about meta?</p>
<p>60 billion?</p>
<p>Oh, my god.</p>
<p>I mean, that was did you watch the video?</p>
<p>I watched the whole thing.</p>
<p>I watched two minutes of it.</p>
<p>And then I stopped watching.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s basically, you have Facebook in the face of all of the things, all the</p>
<p>times they got their hand caught in the cookie jar, saying, this is going to be the new world.</p>
<p>But instead of us doing everything wrong and screwing the users and their privacy and democracy</p>
<p>and creating strife in the world, this time, we&rsquo;re going to make it open source.</p>
<p>This time, we&rsquo;re going to build a coalition and partnership.</p>
<p>And this time, it&rsquo;s going to be awesome.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like, a dystopian SNL skit, where Zuckerberg is describing the future,</p>
<p>and he literally describes how proud he is that you&rsquo;re going to be able to play Grand Theft Auto.</p>
<p>And Nick Clegg is like, yeah, this is going to be amazing.</p>
<p>This time, we&rsquo;re going to bring all the regulators and the scientists in to tell</p>
<p>us how to build it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll have consensus of how to build the future.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, did you just say that everybody in 3d is going to be in a virtual space</p>
<p>beating each other up with bats and guns and killing police officers in Grand Theft Auto?</p>
<p>Luckily, they didn&rsquo;t show a clip of it.</p>
<p>But it was basically Zuckerberg taking credit for every single virtual reality or augmented</p>
<p>reality thing you&rsquo;ve seen over the last 20 years, he literally took everything from education,</p>
<p>to HoloLens, to, you know, poker games.</p>
<p>And he took basically credit that this is going to be the future.</p>
<p>And that instead of this time, it being a closed ecosystem, it would be an open one</p>
<p>that supports NFTs.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t worry, this time, I think any developer who puts any amount of their effort into supporting</p>
<p>in any way Zuckerberg&rsquo;s view of the metaverse is crazy, when they could do it on a distributed,</p>
<p>decentralized, crypto based open source platform, you do not want to give Zuckerberg any more</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>And if there is even a 10 or 20% chance that this is the next big compute platform,</p>
<p>Zuckerberg needs to be stopped from doing it by the market.</p>
<p>Jacob, I think you&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve lost your mind.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you&rsquo;ve lost your mind.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I have a counter argument too.</p>
<p>Okay, David, you start.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t even know if I could categorize what I&rsquo;m about to say as a counter argument.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how to counter that.</p>
<p>All I would say is, look, I think it&rsquo;s really great that Facebook is spending all this</p>
<p>R&amp;D money on metaverse virtual reality.</p>
<p>Oculus is a really cool product.</p>
<p>I think, Jason, you&rsquo;ve made the observation that people use it once, say it&rsquo;s the coolest</p>
<p>thing ever, and never use it again.</p>
<p>There is that element to it.</p>
<p>They have to solve that.</p>
<p>Using Oculus for the first time was one of the most unique experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>with computing.</p>
<p>But I admit, I don&rsquo;t use it anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not something I do.</p>
<p>Better or worse than Pornhub the first time?</p>
<p>But in any event, look, I think the fact that&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his way of saying worse.</p>
<p>I think that the fact that Facebook wants to do all this R&amp;D and virtual reality, great.</p>
<p>Changing the name of the company, however, at this point in time, it felt to me like</p>
<p>a little bit like Philip Morris changing his name to Altria Group.</p>
<p>And by the way, I don&rsquo;t buy the idea that Facebook is like cigarettes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s bad for people in the way that it&rsquo;s been hyped up to be.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying this is a PR marketing strategy.</p>
<p>But it feels like they&rsquo;re running from their name.</p>
<p>And basically, it&rsquo;s almost like saying, this whole business of social networking has been</p>
<p>so sullied that we need to appear to be a diversified portfolio of companies, of which</p>
<p>social networking is just one small piece.</p>
<p>A deprecating piece.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t really buy into that.</p>
<p>And I think if that was any part of their motivation, it&rsquo;s a mistake.</p>
<p>Because I think the only thing Facebook should do about all these accusations is get up on</p>
<p>their hind legs and fight.</p>
<p>Because I think all these leaks from the so-called whistleblower, I think this is a completely</p>
<p>orchestrated political hit.</p>
<p>And they should just fight back and push back on it.</p>
<p>I think the dangers of social networking have been vastly exaggerated.</p>
<p>So it seems to me like they&rsquo;re buying into that nonsense by running from their name.</p>
<p>So I at least would not have done this right now.</p>
<p>I would have won that battle.</p>
<p>And then if it was still important to change their name, then I would have changed the name.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re losing young people at an extraordinary rate on Facebook.</p>
<p>US teenagers were projected to decrease by 45% over the next two years.</p>
<p>Young adults between the ages of 20 and 30 were expected to decline by 4%.</p>
<p>Or TikTok, I think is probably more accurate.</p>
<p>Yeah, TikTok is big, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, during that same timeframe via a leaked memo obtained by The Verge.</p>
<p>I mean, how in the world is Facebook or Instagram more dangerous than TikTok?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>No, TikTok is deranged.</p>
<p>Which, but by the way, our Stan making, our Henry Bellcaster of TikTok is reporting that</p>
<p>we have like millions of views over there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some rogue.</p>
<p>Did I say that how much I love TikTok?</p>
<p>I love TikTok.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s building our audience.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re connecting with Gen Z, by the way.</p>
<p>Freedom, go TikTok, go TikTok, go CCP.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The TikTok account, there&rsquo;s an all in TikTok account done by a fan.</p>
<p>And we got like 2 million views in the last week.</p>
<p>It is absolutely bonkers.</p>
<p>We just passed Rachel Maddow and a bunch of folks.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re more popular than all of MSNBC.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, come on, way to set the benchmark.</p>
<p>Friedberg.</p>
<p>Do you guys remember a year ago, Larry Ellison negotiated this deal with Trump to buy TikTok?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s going to throw in Lanai.</p>
<p>Friedberg is.</p>
<p>And Masa-san was supposed to be on TikTok&rsquo;s board.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s by the way, Xi Jinping is on Lanai right now.</p>
<p>And Larry Ellison got TikTok, fair trade.</p>
<p>Nobody talks about the billy that Ellison kicked into Tesla right before.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s such a boss.</p>
<p>He made like 12 billion dollars.</p>
<p>15, 15, 15, 15, 15 billion.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s such a boss.</p>
<p>He put a billion dollar investment, joined the board, told everyone.</p>
<p>Zip, zip, zip.</p>
<p>Talk all the smack you want about this guy.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s landing spaceships on a drone ship in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>
<p>And 50 next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>But wait, I have one question for Friedberg.</p>
<p>Is Zuckerberg pulling a Larry Page, i.e.</p>
<p>somebody else becomes CEO of the Facebook collection of companies,</p>
<p>and then he becomes the chief product officer,</p>
<p>and then doesn&rsquo;t have to go to Senate hearings?</p>
<p>No, I think he&rsquo;s way more active and driven in terms of product direction than Larry ever was.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re the same person.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t liken these two at all.</p>
<p>What about the meta strategy of changing the company name?</p>
<p>By the way, my prediction was that they were,</p>
<p>I should have done this on the pod a month ago.</p>
<p>I said they were going to change their name to meta.</p>
<p>I think that at some point, as you diversify these businesses</p>
<p>away from your core, and you have this core engine driving the business,</p>
<p>you have to make it look like these businesses can and will operate independently.</p>
<p>While they might get some leverage off of one another, and one might feed into the other,</p>
<p>they need to be able to operate independently from a kind of public perception,</p>
<p>operating a management perspective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Alphabet did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a natural progression of states,</p>
<p>as you start to do things that are too far distinguished from one another.</p>
<p>And so it feels reasonable.</p>
<p>I think, you know, is this a whole like PR rebranding?</p>
<p>Maybe to some extent, that&rsquo;s helpful.</p>
<p>But I do think that this idea that we need to do more than we&rsquo;re doing today,</p>
<p>and we need to make a big hard cold bet on it is what this represents.</p>
<p>Now, the important psychological question,</p>
<p>is he doing it out of a matter of defense?</p>
<p>Meaning like, does this signal fear about the core business?</p>
<p>Or is it about ambition and aggression and rebets</p>
<p>on new opportunities and emerging opportunities that he thinks?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the big debate that I think is kind of going on right now</p>
<p>is how much often when you see people make big moves like this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either out of greed or out of fear.</p>
<p>And I think some people are asking the question,</p>
<p>how much should we be afraid of the core business being eroded</p>
<p>based on his making this sort of a big bet?</p>
<p>Oh, you think this could perpetuate that?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s a bit of a tell that this is happening?</p>
<p>I tell a guy, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s the question, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the question a lot of people are asking.</p>
<p>Is this a tell that the core business is at serious risk?</p>
<p>Why do he&rsquo;s putting 10 billion into it this year,</p>
<p>for example, this Apple, you know, ad revenue business,</p>
<p>I think is climbing by billions of dollars,</p>
<p>while Facebook&rsquo;s core business is being affected</p>
<p>by the cookie tracking policy change on Apple iOS.</p>
<p>So at the same time that, you know, Apple&rsquo;s reaping these benefits</p>
<p>from the changes that they&rsquo;ve made in iOS,</p>
<p>you know, people don&rsquo;t really have great visibility</p>
<p>into how much it&rsquo;s really affecting</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s ad revenue at this point.</p>
<p>And this could be, as you point out,</p>
<p>the tell that maybe things aren&rsquo;t that good,</p>
<p>and he needs to diversify,</p>
<p>and he needs to make a big aggressive bet elsewhere.</p>
<p>So, you know, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Important question, Chamath,</p>
<p>are we going to celebrate the birth of both</p>
<p>your and Friedberg&rsquo;s daughters with a poker game?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>With my gambling?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you want me to give you my thoughts on that?</p>
<p>Or no, you don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>Can you take paternity to go to&hellip;</p>
<p>I got a board meeting.</p>
<p>I gotta go, bye.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>For the queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, don&rsquo;t you want to know what I think?</p>
<p>I think on the meta thing,</p>
<p>I think the risk is if Google and Apple</p>
<p>take the hardware costs to zero,</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s an incentive</p>
<p>in a highly fragmented ecosystem.</p>
<p>You have to remember when Apple introduced the iPhone,</p>
<p>there was nothing that came before it.</p>
<p>So it was completely groundbreaking.</p>
<p>And I think what Facebook has to figure out</p>
<p>is how to make their VR experience so revolutionary</p>
<p>that it attracts developers.</p>
<p>And in the meantime,</p>
<p>if Apple and Google figure out</p>
<p>how to kind of give it away for free</p>
<p>and just kind of make it a low cost hardware game,</p>
<p>where everything else, Jason, as you say,</p>
<p>is this kind of open source thing</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like a browser.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, where everything just exists</p>
<p>in a DeFi kind of world.</p>
<p>Like the web and the internet.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s a little bit more problematic</p>
<p>for all the money spent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they have to figure out.</p>
<p>Do you think, Sax, it&rsquo;s going to be VR or AR?</p>
<p>What wins the day with consumers?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re very different experiences.</p>
<p>Both can win.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re talking 20 years from now,</p>
<p>which one will be used more?</p>
<p>Or 10 years from now, 10 to 20 years from now,</p>
<p>which one will make more money,</p>
<p>be more relevant, be more utilized?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, AR, the dream there</p>
<p>is that you wear these glasses</p>
<p>that have like the Terminator view,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like scanning the world</p>
<p>and giving you information.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never forget anyone&rsquo;s name again.</p>
<p>Stuff like that.</p>
<p>That would be kind of useful, maybe.</p>
<p>VR, I think, is more about immersion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really like a gaming experience,</p>
<p>I think, at least now.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all about AR.</p>
<p>Basically, what he was saying there,</p>
<p>he was talking about VR.</p>
<p>I think VR lets you make the worlds.</p>
<p>And then AR lets you experience them</p>
<p>concurrently with the real world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same tools and libraries and kits.</p>
<p>As a developer, making it for VR, AR</p>
<p>is going to be pretty, I think, seamless.</p>
<p>And so I think Apple has skipped VR on purpose,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to AR.</p>
<p>I think Google is basically</p>
<p>going to go directly to AR.</p>
<p>And then where does that leave?</p>
<p>And then Microsoft already has HoloLens</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been investing in heavily.</p>
<p>And I think they got the biggest lead</p>
<p>that at least we publicly know about.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s going to be a race</p>
<p>for who can get AR to work.</p>
<p>And VR is just like kind of a waypoint</p>
<p>on the way there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that people will want</p>
<p>to check out of the real world</p>
<p>for some amount of their life.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll probably also want</p>
<p>to be in the real world</p>
<p>for some part of their life.</p>
<p>And at some point,</p>
<p>maybe if those two things merge,</p>
<p>that distinction won&rsquo;t matter as much.</p>
<p>And I think if the experience</p>
<p>is compelling enough, it could happen.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you think about us</p>
<p>playing poker on one of those poker apps,</p>
<p>if we could put our glasses on,</p>
<p>sit in our room and see each other</p>
<p>at a poker table,</p>
<p>you know, like if Bogut wanted</p>
<p>to play from Australia,</p>
<p>and he was, you know,</p>
<p>projected into the seat on the game,</p>
<p>and we all saw them there with glasses,</p>
<p>AR glasses, that would be amazing,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Be able to, you know,</p>
<p>have two of the people at the game</p>
<p>be projected in, as it were.</p>
<p>Could be, especially if it was Diego.</p>
<p>I mean, that would be pretty great.</p>
<p>I mean, for that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying for the good of the game.</p>
<p>I did a tweet where I said,</p>
<p>listen, VR, people leave it on the shelf.</p>
<p>And I, you know,</p>
<p>Paul Malucky and a bunch of people</p>
<p>got in my face about it.</p>
<p>And then we had like,</p>
<p>actually really good discussion.</p>
<p>And I said, well,</p>
<p>what about serious gamers?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m talking about serious gamers.</p>
<p>They all buy it,</p>
<p>and then they never use it.</p>
<p>And they said, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not for serious gamers.</p>
<p>I said, okay, well,</p>
<p>what about iPad gamers and casual gamers</p>
<p>and Bejeweled and Candy Crush?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh yeah,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not interested in it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well,</p>
<p>who are the gamers then?</p>
<p>Is it the intense ones</p>
<p>or the casual ones?</p>
<p>They said, no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a new category.</p>
<p>The number one game,</p>
<p>like Rec Room,</p>
<p>Beat Saber and Golf</p>
<p>are like crushing it</p>
<p>with a million users a month</p>
<p>in some cases.</p>
<p>You know what they all have in common?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re physical activities</p>
<p>where you get some amount of exercise,</p>
<p>and it would be very difficult</p>
<p>to coordinate in the real world.</p>
<p>I know, but Jason,</p>
<p>when you look at things like Axie Infinity,</p>
<p>where there are play to earn movements</p>
<p>that are happening in sort of this</p>
<p>layer three kind of DeFi world</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re getting paid</p>
<p>to basically play games,</p>
<p>that could be a job.</p>
<p>And then you will spend eight to 10 hours</p>
<p>in the metaverse of some sort.</p>
<p>So these things are very possible.</p>
<p>I find it so dystopian.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure that our parents</p>
<p>find some parts of our lifestyle dystopian.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>we find certain parts</p>
<p>of our kids&rsquo; lives dystopian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what happens.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>We will play poker.</p>
<p>We will play poker.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got to play poker at some point.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ll play poker either,</p>
<p>either Tuesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, well, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Babies will be like almost a week old.</p>
<p>Which days are you going to flake?</p>
<p>Tuesday and Thursday?</p>
<p>Which day will you flake?</p>
<p>Tuesday and Thursday?</p>
<p>Tuesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>I mean, do I have to come pick you up?</p>
<p>I can play on Tuesday.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>For the Queen of Quinoa,</p>
<p>the Rain Man and the Dictator,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jason Calacanis.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next time on All In.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a winner&rsquo;s line.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going All In.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going All In.</p>
