<p>she&rsquo;s really went through the</p>
<p>readmission and then her thyroid was</p>
<p>removed 10 years after that and the last</p>
<p>few years she&rsquo;s actually went get away</p>
<p>about 10 pounds and I think she&rsquo;s at I</p>
<p>Roy type of person and in adrenal please</p>
<p>give us eyes on that and the do&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;ts and also the testicular cancer</p>
<p>post surgery which is about two months</p>
<p>ago a male kind of a slim body type only</p>
<p>30 as well please say button on the do</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t of this to individual sure</p>
<p>Vanessa let me just give you some tips</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a lot of questions but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing non-hodgkins lymphoma</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the rise it&rsquo;s going spiking up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually quite high and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been some links to some interesting</p>
<p>things in the environment specifically</p>
<p>glyphosate yeah that&rsquo;s that in the GMO</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of day coincidence with the</p>
<p>spike and I if you search some of the</p>
<p>class action suits you&rsquo;ll get a lot of</p>
<p>data on this and they did all the</p>
<p>research they compiled it so if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the case then what you&rsquo;d want to do is</p>
<p>make sure these people that got cancer</p>
<p>because the immune system is now weak</p>
<p>they need to go completely 100 percent</p>
<p>organic</p>
<p>to make sure there&rsquo;s no more GMOs in the</p>
<p>food they need to make sure that they do</p>
<p>a lot of cruciferous vegetables because</p>
<p>the liver needs to detoxify cruciferous</p>
<p>stimulates enzymes in the liver it gives</p>
<p>the liver enzymes and it stimulates the</p>
<p>liver to make enzymes in the process of</p>
<p>converting these poisons to harmless</p>
<p>particles it&rsquo;s called phase 1 phase 2</p>
<p>detoxification so allows the whole</p>
<p>process to convert a fat-soluble poison</p>
<p>to a harmless particle that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>water-soluble so that&rsquo;s why you want to</p>
<p>every every day I would consume some</p>
<p>type of cruciferous whether it&rsquo;s a kale</p>
<p>shake Brussels sprouts radishes really</p>
<p>important and that&rsquo;s what I would do as</p>
<p>far as the thyroid if you have it</p>
<p>removed what happens now is that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to be on medication you</p>
<p>know thyroid hormones that the thing</p>
<p>that I would look at is make sure the</p>
<p>gallbladder is working good because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a gallbladder problem we have</p>
<p>the gallbladder removed you might have a</p>
<p>hard time converting t4 to t3 in which</p>
<p>case you need to take some bile salts to</p>
<p>allow that thyroid to work better so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty much the answer I would</p>
<p>give you a Vanessa thanks for your</p>
<p>question hey George you&rsquo;re from Turin</p>
<p>Toronto go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>good evening got the word thank you for</p>
<p>taking my call and I just wanted to say</p>
<p>thank you thank you thank you for</p>
<p>everything you do in your videos much</p>
<p>appreciated I lost 40 pounds I&rsquo;m five</p>
<p>months on keto get adopted kale shake</p>
<p>every day intermittent fasting your</p>
<p>supplements as well my question is hair</p>
<p>and nails doesn&rsquo;t want to improve so</p>
<p>much in so fast is there something I can</p>
<p>do to speed up this process I our</p>
<p>curiosity are you taking the hair</p>
<p>formula I just ordered it okay um other</p>
<p>than that is a lot of greens not a lot</p>
<p>of protein no sugar no alcohol nothing</p>
<p>else okay so let&rsquo;s talk about the hair</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two mainly in men it&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>levels of DHT which is a powerful form</p>
<p>of testosterone that burns that out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a called an enzyme inhibitor</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not going to get into the</p>
<p>technical name but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that you can take the slow down the</p>
<p>process of DHT building up in the body</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s called stinging nettle root</p>
<p>that is in the hair formula in addition</p>
<p>to a lot of other nutrients we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>the trace minerals you have the B</p>
<p>vitamins biotin we also have horse tail</p>
<p>which gives you silica and also actual</p>
<p>protein itself a certain type of</p>
<p>collagen that builds up the hair I think</p>
<p>to speed up the process I would go out</p>
<p>and get some stinging nettle root in</p>
<p>higher dosages that will help because in</p>
<p>men it&rsquo;ll actually kill two birds one</p>
<p>stone it&rsquo;ll actually help the hair and</p>
<p>also help the prostate I would do that</p>
<p>typically if you&rsquo;re on the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet and you lose your hair which or you</p>
<p>start getting hair loss all that means</p>
<p>is you need to also include intermittent</p>
<p>fasting with that and that should clear</p>
<p>it right up in fact the people that I</p>
<p>know that are doing in a minute fasting</p>
<p>with the ketosis it really accelerates</p>
<p>the hair growth because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>increasing growth hormones which is</p>
<p>building up more proteins and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>breaking them down and so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>reducing insulin which is an underlying</p>
<p>inflammatory condition so that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would try George but thanks for your</p>
<p>call and thanks for your lovely words</p>
<p>Majestic you are from Virginia right</p>
<p>down the street yes I am you hear me</p>
<p>thank you so much for stopping my calls</p>
<p>yeah I can hear you fine I am decided to</p>
<p>do intermittent fasting from watching</p>
<p>some of your videos on YouTube and I</p>
<p>just have quick yes and those for food</p>
<p>um one is butter huh</p>
<p>okay um it&rsquo;s totally fine make sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grass-fed Carrie gold might work</p>
<p>for ya okay maple syrup maple syrup</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a no but if you go on my blog I</p>
<p>have a recipe for maple syrup that you</p>
<p>can</p>
<p>consume cool pancakes I have a recipe</p>
<p>for that to go on the go my blogging go</p>
<p>into the video blog and then click under</p>
<p>recipes because I I just looked at to</p>
<p>today and I was like I have a lot of</p>
<p>recipes on there waffles pancakes</p>
<p>everything okay what about vivia it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>drink that is sweetened with stevia</p>
<p>totally fun it&rsquo;s like a carving yeah</p>
<p>good that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>totally fine okay this is the most this</p>
<p>is the biggie right here what type of</p>
<p>salad dressing because like I can eat</p>
<p>dressing all day long but what type of</p>
<p>salad dressing can I um the best thing</p>
<p>to do is make your own we have recipes</p>
<p>for that too but here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>use and I use um I go to the grocery</p>
<p>store and I did a video on this so you</p>
<p>could find this as well and I just</p>
<p>basically looked at the label 95% of</p>
<p>them are made from soy or canola if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not organic</p>
<p>they are GMO most definitely so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to find it&rsquo;s going to be like</p>
<p>a small percentage of salad dressings</p>
<p>that are made with sunflower oil or</p>
<p>avocado oil or olive oil those are the</p>
<p>ones that you buy I don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>specific brand because sometimes it I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see it then it&rsquo;s gone because a lot of</p>
<p>people are not buying it but that is the</p>
<p>problem just find one without the soy</p>
<p>corn or canola okay what about the sugar</p>
<p>content in them yeah you want to get one</p>
<p>without sugar as well that&rsquo;s a given you</p>
<p>absolutely just look at the actual sugar</p>
<p>grams and make sure it&rsquo;s below like 1 1</p>
<p>or less okay 1 or less ok now the</p>
<p>vitamins because you take in</p>
<p>electrolytes I have everything that you</p>
<p>think it can I take those during the</p>
<p>fasting period you are doing totally fun</p>
<p>the only thing that could knock you out</p>
<p>of ketosis a little bit is excessive</p>
<p>amounts of bone broth because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>protein sometimes l-glutamine which is</p>
<p>the amino acid sometimes branch amino</p>
<p>acids will do it so anything amino acid</p>
<p>could bump you out it&rsquo;s not a big</p>
<p>problem because it&rsquo;s only temporary it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a small amount but just so you know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re testing your urine and go wow</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now I&rsquo;m out of ketosis don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>freak out it&rsquo;s probably just something</p>
<p>like that okay what about dear</p>
<p>she even theory now the thing about</p>
<p>dairy is that I&rsquo;m going to do a complete</p>
<p>video on that you have certain cheese</p>
<p>that have has a lot of lactose in it and</p>
<p>so you just have to get more hard</p>
<p>cheeses definitely grass-fed cheese&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I like the fattier cheeses the cream</p>
<p>cheese sour cream I like also the brie</p>
<p>cheeses those are higher in fat lower</p>
<p>and lactose so if you get yogurt for</p>
<p>example it&rsquo;s very high in lactose and</p>
<p>also even some of the keepers are higher</p>
<p>in sugar so what I would do is I would</p>
<p>stick with the hard cheeses or soft</p>
<p>cheeses but if you look at some of the</p>
<p>traditional cheeses that they show you</p>
<p>the sugar content that&rsquo;s probably the</p>
<p>lactose it&rsquo;s pretty high but typically I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it just some people</p>
<p>can do a lot of cheese some people it</p>
<p>binds them up it can knock them out of</p>
<p>ketosis possibly because they have an</p>
<p>allergy to either lactose which a lot of</p>
<p>people have or casein which is the</p>
<p>protein in milk I I&rsquo;m from Wisconsin I</p>
<p>like cheese I eat a lot of cheese it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother me at all and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good fattier protein to</p>
<p>consume at the end of meal so it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of a wild variable when you get into</p>
<p>cheese&rsquo;s but I&rsquo;m going to do a complete</p>
<p>video on that good okay now watch that</p>
<p>and lastly I guess we buy apple juice</p>
<p>not from concentrate and it has only</p>
<p>apples and absorbing accident is that</p>
<p>okay no because that&rsquo;s pure sugar that</p>
<p>will totally block your ketosis</p>
<p>completely no juices you know fruit</p>
<p>juices but I think I know your last</p>
<p>question though no fruit no fruit zero</p>
<p>all right yeah okay thank you so much</p>
<p>okay good I was trying to predict your</p>
<p>last question but I don&rsquo;t think I did</p>
<p>but okay good so Dave you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>from Austin Texas</p>
<p>yeah hi thank you for taking the call</p>
<p>and I really enjoyed your video short</p>
<p>excellent teacher oh thanks um you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome you are very likeable good job</p>
<p>doctor</p>
<p>I have a question about DHT I read pro</p>
<p>and con on olive oil and coconut oil and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know your cake on him in</p>
<p>relationship to DHT yeah okay you know I</p>
<p>looked at that too and honestly there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the some people that are against it that</p>
<p>said it will increase DHT our it&rsquo;s play</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an arbitrary of someone&rsquo;s opinion</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never found an actual study that</p>
<p>they based it off of or any type of</p>
<p>physiology books that will state that I</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re totally fine I do not</p>
<p>think they increase DHT at all so I</p>
<p>would not worry about it at all but I</p>
<p>think one of my favorite things there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two things that will actually lower DHT</p>
<p>in the body if you have too much of it</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s a lot of them but the one</p>
<p>that the one that&rsquo;s common is the</p>
<p>stinging nettle root but number two is</p>
<p>mushrooms button mushrooms so well that</p>
<p>that actually will convert it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually improve it lowers DHT and it</p>
<p>frees up more free testosterone so just</p>
<p>happens to be kind of a something you</p>
<p>can get anywhere terrific okay thanks</p>
<p>very much</p>
<p>hey thanks Dave let&rsquo;s see it&rsquo;s a sauna</p>
<p>you are from California go ahead you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the air okay dr. burr good evening hi</p>
<p>I am yeah I&rsquo;m so actually I am 41 years</p>
<p>and 112 pounds</p>
<p>I am adrenal tight and I started ketosis</p>
<p>a year back and lost 22 pounds in 3</p>
<p>months so but the problem here is my</p>
<p>total cholesterol is 394 which has gone</p>
<p>up then a year before and LDL is 340 HDL</p>
<p>is 73 and triglyceride is 37 which have</p>
<p>improved also and I take all the</p>
<p>vitamins d3 k 2 wheatgrass and fish oil</p>
<p>and all so my question is it normal to</p>
<p>have that high cholesterol and LDL as I</p>
<p>have family history of heart attacks on</p>
<p>my mom&rsquo;s side or should I change my diet</p>
<p>or add something to lower my cholesterol</p>
<p>so doctor this suspect it is tramadol</p>
<p>hyperlipidemia</p>
<p>and my another question is I have pain</p>
<p>in my joint when I sit for very long so</p>
<p>how can I fix that one I already take</p>
<p>phospholipid so that was my question</p>
<p>yeah thank you yeah fast food liquid is</p>
<p>a phosphorus that actually helps to free</p>
<p>up calcium deposits so I have a question</p>
<p>for you are you doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting yet yeah okay yeah okay I do so</p>
<p>um so I think what for inflammation you</p>
<p>could go get some stinging nettle root</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great anti-inflammatory but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s that here&rsquo;s the thing that I want</p>
<p>to talk about I created a video recently</p>
<p>on LDL what happens is that first of all</p>
<p>when you burn fat cells</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get rid of fat cells you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just taking the the triglycerides and</p>
<p>some cholesterol in the fat cells and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using them up for energy so the</p>
<p>fat cells are shrinking right so as the</p>
<p>triglycerides come out you&rsquo;re burning</p>
<p>those up as fuel but the cholesterol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming out is not burned as fuel</p>
<p>so when you&rsquo;re in ketosis or</p>
<p>intermittent fasting all this</p>
<p>cholesterol that&rsquo;s been stored in the</p>
<p>fat cell where&rsquo;s it going to go it has</p>
<p>to come out and it has to go through the</p>
<p>circle circular has to come to the liver</p>
<p>and it has to come out to the</p>
<p>gallbladder so you have to just make</p>
<p>sure that you&rsquo;re keeping your vegetables</p>
<p>very very high if your LDL so called bad</p>
<p>cholesterol is high it might not be a</p>
<p>problem it&rsquo;s usually not a problem</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s two types there&rsquo;s Type A</p>
<p>which is the large buoyant fluffy type</p>
<p>of cholesterol which is not a problem</p>
<p>and there is Type B which is the dense</p>
<p>smaller type cholesterol which which is</p>
<p>involved in more of the the plaquing</p>
<p>formation and it&rsquo;s just kind of like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s the result of something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the cause of it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>means that there&rsquo;s a problem so if your</p>
<p>LDL is high how do you know which one it</p>
<p>is because they don&rsquo;t tell you unless</p>
<p>you do a more sophisticated test what</p>
<p>you do is you look at your triglycerides</p>
<p>and your HDL if your triglycerides or</p>
<p>HDL</p>
<p>are normal or your triglycerides are</p>
<p>lower like normal or low and your</p>
<p>triglyceride cholesterol is normal or</p>
<p>high then you don&rsquo;t have to worry about</p>
<p>it because you have more type-a LDL and</p>
<p>that means that all this cholesterol is</p>
<p>just coming out through the body and</p>
<p>coming out to the liver and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>being a problem at all even if your</p>
<p>cholesterol is high now if you are</p>
<p>really concerned go get a genetic test</p>
<p>to see if you have a genetic problem</p>
<p>with cholesterol if that&rsquo;s the case then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to maybe take red</p>
<p>yeast or you know maybe not take extra</p>
<p>cholesterol and really take more outside</p>
<p>vinegar and more vegetables but I bet</p>
<p>you that&rsquo;s not the problem because most</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s kind of it&rsquo;s more rare to</p>
<p>have a genetic problem with cholesterol</p>
<p>and and this is the thing that people</p>
<p>just need to know and understand HDL is</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s going to be high as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning fat and it&rsquo;s coming out to the</p>
<p>body and look at the other factors are</p>
<p>you feeling better are you sleeping</p>
<p>better but that&rsquo;s what I would check and</p>
<p>if you really are concerned then you</p>
<p>just go get a test to check your a and B</p>
<p>to really get the specific type of LDL</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re running into but watch my</p>
<p>video on that as well all right good</p>
<p>question hey Christine you&rsquo;re on you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from New York go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>oh my god your honor me yeah hi oh okay</p>
<p>um yeah I I&rsquo;ve been doing internet</p>
<p>fashion keto for many years I&rsquo;m type of</p>
<p>thyroid I went from 30 something&rsquo;s down</p>
<p>to 10 I&rsquo;m taking all my thyroid but now</p>
<p>I heard that has wheat in it or</p>
<p>something maybe I should be taking that</p>
<p>but anyway</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing about a living weight I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost 30 pounds since January Wow yeah</p>
<p>but I I know you say wow but like I I</p>
<p>fast for three days like I eat 500</p>
<p>calories a day</p>
<p>why am I losing okay I see so your since</p>
<p>January right oh no tired I can&rsquo;t lie</p>
<p>there sighs I quit myself yeah so I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen I have some questions</p>
<p>Christine farmer thyroid yeah you have a</p>
<p>thyroid in conjunction with these other</p>
<p>issues can you hear me now okay so you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t hear me but I&rsquo;m going to answer</p>
<p>this question you got a once the thyroid</p>
<p>is a problem everything is really slow</p>
<p>like the metabolism is going to be</p>
<p>really slow so I think what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is a more of a low-calorie diet because</p>
<p>500 calories a day is not enough and</p>
<p>that is going to cause your metabolism</p>
<p>to slow down even more so the difference</p>
<p>between ketogenic a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>element fasting and a starvation diet or</p>
<p>a low calorie diet is that you&rsquo;re when</p>
<p>you in a minute fasting you&rsquo;re even</p>
<p>though you&rsquo;re doing it you&rsquo;re doing less</p>
<p>meals you&rsquo;re still having the quantity</p>
<p>of calories to fulfill the nutrient</p>
<p>amounts and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>so you probably want to go to one meal a</p>
<p>day but make sure it&rsquo;s a big meal not a</p>
<p>500 calorie small meal or else you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be tired because your body is</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t have the nutrients to</p>
<p>survive so the other thing that that you</p>
<p>may want to do is really beef up your B</p>
<p>vitamins because that usually is</p>
<p>required when you go through ketosis but</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re tired because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>having enough calories but you need to</p>
<p>make sure those are quality calories</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right hey George you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Columbia British Columbia</p>
<p>yes thank you</p>
<p>what thanks for having the show on a</p>
<p>different day it&rsquo;s good okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling on Friday so what I want to</p>
<p>know is if you&rsquo;re drinking a lot of</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar mixture with water</p>
<p>can you also take supplements with that</p>
<p>at the same time like say and and do you</p>
<p>have to take that&rsquo;s sort of one question</p>
<p>and the other one just supplements in</p>
<p>general like but also NAC do you take</p>
<p>that with food or without there seems to</p>
<p>be some kind of like mixed information</p>
<p>out there</p>
<p>yeah NAC is really good to repair the</p>
<p>liver after someone&rsquo;s taken steroids or</p>
<p>damaged liver that one I like to take</p>
<p>that one alone but you can take it when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fasting and you can take it with</p>
<p>other supplements but I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>like not with food as far as apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar you can take that with all your</p>
<p>supplements it&rsquo;s not a problem at all</p>
<p>you can just combine it all and just get</p>
<p>it over with</p>
<p>are you from what part of British</p>
<p>Columbia are you from I&rsquo;m calling from</p>
<p>Kelowna okay yeah that&rsquo;s beautiful over</p>
<p>there wait I actually used to practice</p>
<p>in Lynnwood Washington and go up there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just gorgeous up there it rains</p>
<p>a lot but it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so green</p>
<p>yeah yeah well it certainly rains a lot</p>
<p>down near Vancouver and stuff not so</p>
<p>much in Kelowna but um oh yeah you moved</p>
<p>from Lily</p>
<p>why&rsquo;d you do that watching me because I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t handle the rain it rained</p>
<p>almost every day and I was like you know</p>
<p>what I just can&rsquo;t take this so then I</p>
<p>moved to California and to dry out for a</p>
<p>while then I mentioned it to San Diego</p>
<p>okay cool</p>
<p>one more question about Coleen it okay</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a desert supplements for the</p>
<p>liver right and so you got choline mixed</p>
<p>with in inositol I have that supplement</p>
<p>and it says on there to not take it with</p>
<p>them in relation to other mineral</p>
<p>supplements because there&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>called by something or other that</p>
<p>interferes with mineral absorption or</p>
<p>something like that have you heard of</p>
<p>that yeah it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a very minor point</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like insignificant it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so minor I would not worry about it</p>
<p>but inositol and choline are great for a</p>
<p>fatty liver and yeah I wouldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>worry about that it&rsquo;s a very minor point</p>
<p>so how long will it take for the NAC</p>
<p>thing to work on the fatty liver it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very very subtle it&rsquo;s very slow and</p>
<p>subtle the one that&rsquo;s going to probably</p>
<p>make the biggest difference George is</p>
<p>the choline taking a good amount of</p>
<p>choline over a period of time and I mean</p>
<p>you know you have the liver the fat can</p>
<p>come off and maybe three or four months</p>
<p>depending on</p>
<p>that you have I mean if it&rsquo;s a lot it</p>
<p>could take a lot longer but to repair</p>
<p>all the other damage and liver it could</p>
<p>take several years it&rsquo;s a long-term</p>
<p>project yeah and and and Farrah pepper</p>
<p>taste is that you know is that good for</p>
<p>the fatty liver thing - yeah well no</p>
<p>that syrup pepper taste is a very</p>
<p>powerful enzyme that breaks down scar</p>
<p>tissue unwanted scar tissue especially</p>
<p>cirrhosis that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to clean that up</p>
<p>pretty nice I like it that&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>that you have to take on an empty</p>
<p>stomach because it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a powerful</p>
<p>Pro protein enzyme so if you take it</p>
<p>with food it&rsquo;ll just digest your protein</p>
<p>okay but can you take look Sarah peppe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>can you take that long-term because on</p>
<p>yeah on some of the bottles it&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t take it for beyond seven</p>
<p>days without a doctor at all now that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s just a disclaimer you can take</p>
<p>it long-term it cleans out cleans that a</p>
<p>lot of scar tissue from the body</p>
<p>unwanted scar tissue and your metrio</p>
<p>sees everything</p>
<p>thanks George doing the right thing yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the right thing liver yeah</p>
<p>okay thank you you&rsquo;re welcome thank you</p>
<p>very much sure hey Matthew you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Florida go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air hey</p>
<p>yeah I have about a couple like three</p>
<p>quick questions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what am I really fast is it okay</p>
<p>spaghetti squash Kolya only is good all</p>
<p>the scholars are really good yeah I</p>
<p>think what was happening is when I first</p>
<p>started your knife first five or six</p>
<p>months I felt better but I still felt</p>
<p>kind of weird and I was blaming it on</p>
<p>the spaghetti squash and a new stevia</p>
<p>that I was using the number one</p>
<p>ingredient is maltodextrin why I think</p>
<p>that is it possible yes I was doing</p>
<p>listen listen multi dextran has a</p>
<p>glycemic index of a hundred and ten it</p>
<p>is way higher than mean table Sugar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like I think it&rsquo;s 64 so you got the most</p>
<p>the highest glycemic index you want to</p>
<p>bump someone out of ketosis take some</p>
<p>with multi dextran that&rsquo;s why when I</p>
<p>made my electrolyte formula they wanted</p>
<p>to put the manufacturer we wanted to put</p>
<p>multi dextran I&rsquo;m like no and I said why</p>
<p>do you want to put that in there well we</p>
<p>do it for everyone I&rsquo;m like no no you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to put it in mind I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to touch the stuff it&rsquo;s it is like</p>
<p>serious like glycemic response yeah yeah</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;ve stopped doing it and for the</p>
<p>past couple two months now since I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>stopped I&rsquo;ve like quickly and I feel</p>
<p>much better way more energy so</p>
<p>definitely messing up and it seems like</p>
<p>all the cleaners have it even the ones</p>
<p>that like stevia in the raw you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be pure CVI it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maltodextrin yeah yeah well you use it</p>
<p>as a kind of an agent to when they put</p>
<p>it anything like enough powder they have</p>
<p>to use it but I there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s ones out</p>
<p>there that don&rsquo;t have it you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going to have to search and find them</p>
<p>but I know you mean I hate them yeah I</p>
<p>get it now I think most people are on</p>
<p>there doing what you want to what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>telling them but they don&rsquo;t realize that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re putting maltodextrin because</p>
<p>everything is in it it&rsquo;s another video</p>
<p>is it paid on do any kind of</p>
<p>weightlifting you&rsquo;re trying to fix</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue well the weight lifting</p>
<p>is totally fine the key with if you have</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue is you want to do a</p>
<p>small amounts of it and give you got</p>
<p>your body a sense of rest and then</p>
<p>alternate days go for long long walks</p>
<p>but you can do heavy weights with</p>
<p>adrenal as long as you give your bought</p>
<p>just do it short like probably 15</p>
<p>minutes and then you like do it every</p>
<p>other day or every third day okay Ryan</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a quick question I don&rsquo;t know this</p>
<p>was before though I haven&rsquo;t napped in a</p>
<p>while but usually whenever I wake up</p>
<p>from my nap I feel horrible like my</p>
<p>whole body will feel hot and I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>still look just gross it&rsquo;ll take me a</p>
<p>couple hours I&rsquo;ll take a cold shower and</p>
<p>what can that be from is that just like</p>
<p>a hypoglycemia thing that&rsquo;s more of a</p>
<p>beautiful it&rsquo;s a B vitamin deficiency I</p>
<p>would start taking more nutritional</p>
<p>yeast on that that should clean out the</p>
<p>clean out the pipes okay okay thanks</p>
<p>Matthew appreciate the question you very</p>
<p>much hey Betty you&rsquo;re from California go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air hi dr. Berg I</p>
<p>just love your channel thank you so much</p>
<p>for taking my call I just had a really</p>
<p>quick question there was a custom O&rsquo;Neal</p>
<p>you did a while ago</p>
<p>so with a lot of she was a from Poland</p>
<p>I think this key : and he did</p>
<p>weightlifting and he managed to lose</p>
<p>like 35 pounds over like two and a half</p>
<p>three years and the drink one of the</p>
<p>things he did he said he was doing was</p>
<p>he was drinking apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>lemon juice stevia and creatine and my</p>
<p>question is what kind of creatine do you</p>
<p>recommend there&rsquo;s a lot out there and</p>
<p>some are apparently better than other</p>
<p>you know I I don&rsquo;t want to spoil it but</p>
<p>I have a video that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>released this could be next Wednesday or</p>
<p>Thursday on creatine that talks about</p>
<p>the different kinds but I don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>brand name but you can have to just find</p>
<p>it so why don&rsquo;t you stay tuned for that</p>
<p>one you just can you know they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>very similar they&rsquo;re not that different</p>
<p>but if you want a higher quality I cover</p>
<p>that in the video so stay tuned for that</p>
<p>specific video because that&rsquo;s more of an</p>
<p>involved question because there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>four or five different kinds okay</p>
<p>excellent</p>
<p>good looking I&rsquo;ll wait until next week</p>
<p>yeah great well thank you so much thanks</p>
<p>Betty</p>
<p>okay cable bike hey Christine you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the earlier from Florida go ahead hi dr.</p>
<p>Burke how are you good thanks I am</p>
<p>calling in regard to my cholesterol I</p>
<p>have been doing keto for probably about</p>
<p>eight months and since the beginning of</p>
<p>this year I&rsquo;ve been doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting along with it I am diabetic and</p>
<p>I get my labs done every three months my</p>
<p>my total cholesterol in January before I</p>
<p>was doing the intermittent fasting and I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that deep into the ketosis but it</p>
<p>was a hundred and fifty in April it</p>
<p>jumped to 324 so I had a pretty</p>
<p>significant jump my LDL went</p>
<p>excuse me from 76 in January two to four</p>
<p>in April I&rsquo;ve been told that it&rsquo;s likely</p>
<p>that I have a genetic predisposition to</p>
<p>high cholesterol and I&rsquo;m wondering I</p>
<p>know you touched on this to an earlier</p>
<p>caller if this could be related to just</p>
<p>the cycle of the cholesterol until</p>
<p>everything gets cleaned out so so how</p>
<p>does your triglycerides though</p>
<p>triglycerides went from 211 in January</p>
<p>to to 24 in April okay okay</p>
<p>and what about your HDL I&rsquo;m sorry your</p>
<p>HDL what was your cart okay what about</p>
<p>your HDL my of course it&rsquo;s breaking up</p>
<p>now I can&rsquo;t hear it I want to know</p>
<p>Christine here&rsquo;s I know you&rsquo;re breaking</p>
<p>up but I can&rsquo;t hear you but here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I would like you to do Christine I want</p>
<p>you to get a genetic test to see if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it okay if it&rsquo;s not genetic</p>
<p>then we know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s going to be good</p>
<p>but if your if your triglycerides are</p>
<p>going a little higher then that is a</p>
<p>little problem but let&rsquo;s go to a quick</p>
<p>break and I&rsquo;ll be right back</p>
<p>call the show now at eight six six five</p>
<p>six one four to nine to the doctor</p>
<p>returns in a moment</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s back to your calls and questions</p>
<p>with dr. Berg our lines are open now at</p>
<p>eight six six five six one four two nine</p>
<p>two and now dr. Berg hey guys I am back</p>
<p>over here on the board a little</p>
<p>technical difficulties we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>handle that we have fiber coming being</p>
<p>put in here so that will completely</p>
<p>utterly solve it we just had an internet</p>
<p>disconnection but while we&rsquo;re here I</p>
<p>want to talk about the last question</p>
<p>that that other person had about the LD</p>
<p>L okay so very simply you have the liver</p>
<p>over here and then you have the artery</p>
<p>and all the cells over here LDL is the</p>
<p>cholesterol coming into the arteries</p>
<p>okay and into the cells so it delivers</p>
<p>cholesterol into the cells and the</p>
<p>purpose of cholesterol is to act as a</p>
<p>band-aid to help heal to provide for raw</p>
<p>material for hormones stare like steroid</p>
<p>hormones like your sex hormones cortisol</p>
<p>so you can have more anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>hormones more stress fighting hormones</p>
<p>all that so and that&rsquo;s why when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under stress this goes up okay so it</p>
<p>goes in there and it&rsquo;s going in there to</p>
<p>try to patch up little holes in the</p>
<p>arteries which are already there as a</p>
<p>result of either a low vitamin C</p>
<p>deficiency deficiency or high insulin so</p>
<p>you can have low vitamin C that creates</p>
<p>these lesions which are like leaky</p>
<p>little holes and that can come from low</p>
<p>vitamin C junk foods it can also come</p>
<p>from high levels of insulin why because</p>
<p>insulin even like in a diabetic it</p>
<p>destroys the cells it destroys the eyes</p>
<p>destroys the nervous system stressed</p>
<p>part of the brain called the hippocampus</p>
<p>which then you&rsquo;re a your ability to</p>
<p>locate yourself in time and space is</p>
<p>destroyed because you can&rsquo;t find you</p>
<p>know the worst ward I park that type of</p>
<p>thing so high levels of</p>
<p>insulin or insulin resistance so then</p>
<p>the LDL comes in there as a by-product</p>
<p>or a secondary effect to try to help</p>
<p>heal this thing</p>
<p>so then HDL is the cholesterol coming</p>
<p>back to the liver to be recycled you</p>
<p>realize that your body your body</p>
<p>recycles a lot of the cholesterol so it</p>
<p>needs the cholesterol it considers it</p>
<p>important people are attacking the</p>
<p>cholesterol is a problem so here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing when you actually start to</p>
<p>increase your ketosis you have the fat</p>
<p>cells which are composed of</p>
<p>triglycerides and cholesterol so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to basically burn up that</p>
<p>triglyceride but cholesterol is not</p>
<p>burned it&rsquo;s not used as fuel so now as</p>
<p>your fat cells become smaller where&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all that cholesterol going to go it has</p>
<p>to come out through the body and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why when you when someone goes on a low</p>
<p>carbohydrate diet if you look under a</p>
<p>book it&rsquo;s called Guyton&rsquo;s physiology the</p>
<p>book on textbook of how the body works</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a chapter on insulin and it</p>
<p>talks about one of the side effects of a</p>
<p>low carbohydrate diet is a fatty liver</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s only because they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>consuming enough of the other like the</p>
<p>vegetable factors to start cleaning all</p>
<p>this cholesterol out so anytime you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning fat think about this your</p>
<p>gallbladder has to now handle and</p>
<p>dismantle and get rid of the excess so</p>
<p>what you want to do is you want to</p>
<p>consume a lot of vegetables you can kill</p>
<p>two birds with one stone you can</p>
<p>actually flush out all the all the</p>
<p>excess cholesterol that needs to be</p>
<p>gotten rid of any excess fat and also</p>
<p>keeps your gallbladder and liver clean</p>
<p>oh and that&rsquo;s it can increase the</p>
<p>potassium Reserve because you need</p>
<p>potassium to actually heal the cells</p>
<p>especially with the insulin dysfunction</p>
<p>or insulin resistance so potassium is</p>
<p>essential you get it from the vegetables</p>
<p>so the vegetable is really a vital piece</p>
<p>I do not recommend doing a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet without vegetables okay so when you</p>
<p>do high ketones</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to end up with a lot of fat</p>
<p>coming out of the body a lot of</p>
<p>cholesterol might come up temporarily</p>
<p>and then because a lot of that is the</p>
<p>LDL that&rsquo;s going to go high so like I</p>
<p>was mentioning before there&rsquo;s two types</p>
<p>of LDL there&rsquo;s pattern a and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pattern B a is the is the fluffy buoyant</p>
<p>large particles B is the small particles</p>
<p>and this is the stuff right here B is</p>
<p>the stuff that&rsquo;s involved in this</p>
<p>reaction with the the lining of the</p>
<p>arteries okay so if you have too much of</p>
<p>B then that tells me there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>if you have a then there&rsquo;s not a problem</p>
<p>the problem is when you measure your LDL</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t differentiate is that a or is</p>
<p>it B okay so how do you know you have to</p>
<p>look at the triglycerides the</p>
<p>triglycerides if they&rsquo;re high then that</p>
<p>means it&rsquo;s chances are it&rsquo;s higher on</p>
<p>the B okay and if your HDL is low then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s B but your triglycerides are lower</p>
<p>and your HDL is higher or these are</p>
<p>normal then it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an A and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a problem so here you are you have high</p>
<p>LDL but it&rsquo;s not a it&rsquo;s not a problem</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually your body is just doing</p>
<p>its thing and if you come in there and</p>
<p>try to lower it with some drug now so</p>
<p>now you actually cut off the production</p>
<p>of cholesterol systemically through the</p>
<p>whole body and that&rsquo;s going to create a</p>
<p>problem for a lot of things you realize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s more side effects from low</p>
<p>cholesterol than there is from high</p>
<p>cholesterol and even overall death rates</p>
<p>people die from low cholesterol you know</p>
<p>just even if they were to die from high</p>
<p>cholesterol and that has to do with them</p>
<p>you get other problems with the immune</p>
<p>system you&rsquo;re more susceptible to cancer</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s low cholesterol I did a whole</p>
<p>video on low cholesterol so the key the</p>
<p>key is when you do ketosis we want to</p>
<p>add in a minute fasting</p>
<p>to really bring down that insulin okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll just that&rsquo;ll put the icing on</p>
<p>the cake now I shouldn&rsquo;t talk about cake</p>
<p>and then you want to add a lot of</p>
<p>vegetables to make it even better and</p>
<p>then we want to also add apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar okay so that&rsquo;s going to really</p>
<p>help dissolve that so so we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>go back and take a call I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working now and let me just come back</p>
<p>over here all right all right so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to take a call let&rsquo;s see hello</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air three dr. Birgit</p>
<p>Manish I follow all your videos money</p>
<p>from California oh hi nice meeting</p>
<p>washed out so you had a question so you</p>
<p>might Manish from California yeah</p>
<p>go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air oh you have</p>
<p>to turn on your radio or your you&rsquo;re off</p>
<p>like whatever I&rsquo;m getting some feedback</p>
<p>okay how long is it better now yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better now okay so yes I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following all your videos and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following on your advice and I&rsquo;ve you</p>
<p>know tried paleo for about five years</p>
<p>and probably tried a serious or it</p>
<p>ketosis for about a year the results are</p>
<p>pretty good lost out of weight I guess I</p>
<p>have a three-part question I&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>with a very sore the short one for the</p>
<p>short one is the the wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>powder which I have from you could you</p>
<p>like for everybody&rsquo;s benefit tell how</p>
<p>much potassium there isn&rsquo;t just for our</p>
<p>calculation to you know make sure we get</p>
<p>the entire potassium intake in the day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s number one okay let me answer</p>
<p>maybe perhaps let me answer that first</p>
<p>okay so it has a lot of it has like 300</p>
<p>milligrams per a potassium per scooper</p>
<p>or teaspoon so I mean it&rsquo;s not it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t compare to my electrolyte powder</p>
<p>which is a thousand but it has a lot of</p>
<p>other fat</p>
<p>Jews that go beyond even nutrition it</p>
<p>has to do with growth factors that</p>
<p>actually help internal healing of skin</p>
<p>all the internal lining of skin is</p>
<p>affected by that wheatgrass like if you</p>
<p>have like an ulcer if you have some type</p>
<p>of heat a lack of healing it&rsquo;s so does a</p>
<p>lot of very amazing things that I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually make a claim but I see it</p>
<p>happening all day long I would love to</p>
<p>tell everyone but I&rsquo;ll just say this</p>
<p>that it actually is it has a growth</p>
<p>factor that goes beyond where nutrition</p>
<p>that actually actually helps the</p>
<p>internal lining of the sinuses esophagus</p>
<p>your colon from from start to finish</p>
<p>go ahead second question you had okay</p>
<p>great so the second question is perhaps</p>
<p>maybe it may be a little bit more</p>
<p>details or perhaps if you could do a</p>
<p>video and it&rsquo;ll some time later is</p>
<p>something that we don&rsquo;t normally talk</p>
<p>about on your channel is how do you act</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s even possible is how do you</p>
<p>as a male how do you actually gain</p>
<p>muscle on the ketogenic diet because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great for losing weight I actually</p>
<p>find it very easy to lose weight and in</p>
<p>fact I almost get worried at the rate I</p>
<p>lose weight and you know it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost good that I feel it&rsquo;s mostly</p>
<p>fat but at the same time I I do want to</p>
<p>I do have a goal to put on it um good</p>
<p>little bit more muscle so maybe so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what I want to do I want to</p>
<p>answer that one question because we have</p>
<p>a lot of other questions too because I</p>
<p>have to get to every one but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing if you want to put on more muscle</p>
<p>mass yes ketogenic diets intermittent</p>
<p>fasting together will help improve</p>
<p>growth hormone considerably but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to do some type of heavy</p>
<p>heavier weights to put on muscle mass</p>
<p>because you just can&rsquo;t you see the the</p>
<p>the weight training is the activation of</p>
<p>the muscle hypertrophy that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing so that&rsquo;s what you need</p>
<p>to do I would get a personal trainer</p>
<p>that knows what they&rsquo;re doing and do</p>
<p>higher weights lower reps to activate</p>
<p>this you&rsquo;re not going to build muscle</p>
<p>mass by jogging even though I do that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s healthy but you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>heavy</p>
<p>and get someone that to help you do that</p>
<p>and that will activate the growth</p>
<p>hormone even more but really to enlarge</p>
<p>the muscle mass hey Angela you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Toronto go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>hi thanks for taking my call I&rsquo;m 47 and</p>
<p>in my mid-20s I have high cholesterol</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hereditary so I&rsquo;ve been on</p>
<p>basically statins ever since that time I</p>
<p>recently came off of it because I my</p>
<p>body just wasn&rsquo;t I wasn&rsquo;t liking it so</p>
<p>my doctor has put me on repatha which I</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s an on statin drug so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>currently on that now and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following you for the last couple months</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve started the a high fat diet low</p>
<p>carb I just want to make sure that well</p>
<p>first I guess my first question would be</p>
<p>should I still take that repatha</p>
<p>medication while I&rsquo;m trying this high</p>
<p>fat diet and I&rsquo;m just really scared</p>
<p>because my dad had bypass surgery my</p>
<p>aunt my uncle it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s hereditary</p>
<p>so it scares me to eat all the spot yeah</p>
<p>I just listen to your explanation which</p>
<p>is really great so given that I have</p>
<p>hereditary high cholesterol is this</p>
<p>something that I should continue to try</p>
<p>good question Angela let me dance oh</p>
<p>yeah if there&rsquo;s a hereditary problem</p>
<p>that if there&rsquo;s a genetic problem with</p>
<p>your family also having factors you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a higher risk so here&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would do I can&rsquo;t tell you not to take</p>
<p>that medication but I would consider</p>
<p>investigating with the help of your</p>
<p>doctor red yeast which actually is more</p>
<p>of a natural thing and then like for the</p>
<p>meals maybe you don&rsquo;t go out of your way</p>
<p>to add butter to your meals maybe you</p>
<p>just stick with the foods that already</p>
<p>have the fats in them and just don&rsquo;t add</p>
<p>additional fats I think the best thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help you is to really</p>
<p>keep in the outside of integrand a</p>
<p>consistent basis keeping the cruciferous</p>
<p>at a high amounts and and lower some of</p>
<p>the the cholesterol that you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>and then the last thing is intermittent</p>
<p>fasting that basically is the best thing</p>
<p>that you can do for for cholesterol</p>
<p>problems because</p>
<p>ketogenic diet you know doesn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about in a minute faster you can</p>
<p>immediate but to intimate it fasting</p>
<p>handles insulin from a different angle</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not stimulating insulin</p>
<p>every time you&rsquo;re eating so I would do</p>
<p>that and then I would also get a more</p>
<p>in-depth test to look at your your</p>
<p>pattern a pattern B cholesterol and make</p>
<p>sure that you have your pattern a is a</p>
<p>little bit higher than your pattern B so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually protected so but yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do again I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>telling you you can&rsquo;t take the</p>
<p>medication I would just investigate the</p>
<p>red yeast extract but good question</p>
<p>thank you hey Melissa</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air go ahead you had a</p>
<p>question about the gall bladder and</p>
<p>estrogen hi dr. Burke I do I have</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s and I had my gall bladder</p>
<p>visas so thank you for your video</p>
<p>letting me know why I could have</p>
<p>Hashimoto as being the low bile or the</p>
<p>high estrogen so I kind of have a double</p>
<p>whammy here um my question to you is I</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to take the estrogen dim</p>
<p>having the Hashimoto&rsquo;s I have thinning</p>
<p>hair and and all the symptoms that go</p>
<p>along with it but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if that</p>
<p>was something I could take having both</p>
<p>the gallbladder and the Hashimoto&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>question absolutely because the estrogen</p>
<p>balance and dim doesn&rsquo;t increase your</p>
<p>estrogen all it does is it gets your own</p>
<p>estrogen it convert from the bad to the</p>
<p>good so it just gives you better ratios</p>
<p>of the good safe estrogen okay so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t increase your estrogen I think I</p>
<p>said that right initially the other</p>
<p>thing that I would try to get more of is</p>
<p>maybe I would get a selenium product</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a trace mineral I would do</p>
<p>that for sure to help you and then the</p>
<p>last thing possibly may be a gallbladder</p>
<p>formula to to get that conversion going</p>
<p>a little bit better but thanks for that</p>
<p>question hey Denise you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Cleveland hi there thanks</p>
<p>for taking my call I&rsquo;ll try to make it</p>
<p>real quick</p>
<p>during intermittent fasting get the</p>
<p>takeo shake count as a meal and number</p>
<p>two questions your opinion on the tables</p>
<p>called inversion tables to stretch your</p>
<p>back out yeah I have</p>
<p>I think those inversion tables are</p>
<p>awesome awesome okay so the other</p>
<p>question is as the kale shake countess</p>
<p>meal yes it does but this is what I do I</p>
<p>eat within a 4 or 5 hour window</p>
<p>okay so I&rsquo;ll have two meals let&rsquo;s sell</p>
<p>you at 12 o&rsquo;clock and four or five what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do because it&rsquo;s hard to consume the</p>
<p>quantity of food that I need especially</p>
<p>vegetables so what I&rsquo;ll do is I I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have my big salad or my kale shake in</p>
<p>the middle of that so it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>a meal but it&rsquo;s still within the window</p>
<p>of four hours okay so that&rsquo;s one tip</p>
<p>that you might want to do but but yeah</p>
<p>it does count as a meal it&rsquo;s not as bad</p>
<p>as other things but it does count</p>
<p>I write you&rsquo;re on the area from Florida</p>
<p>go ahead yes I&rsquo;m a Crohn&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>patient and I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of</p>
<p>changes in my diet but I have a diarrhea</p>
<p>problem and I&rsquo;m trying to find that</p>
<p>particular leafy greens that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give me that diarrhea thing do you have</p>
<p>any suggestions on it I&rsquo;ve had two</p>
<p>surgeries last one was 19 years ago okay</p>
<p>okay so yeah that&rsquo;s a situation because</p>
<p>you probably which you&rsquo;re lacking is the</p>
<p>microflora to digest some of these</p>
<p>insoluble fibers from the vegetables so</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to have to do is</p>
<p>search online for something called</p>
<p>effective microbes okay and get some of</p>
<p>the effective microbes and start taking</p>
<p>them before you go to sleep I would take</p>
<p>maybe a half a capful in about two</p>
<p>ounces of water slug it down before you</p>
<p>go to bed boom go to bed and then all</p>
<p>night long it will start growing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good and in the meantime the the</p>
<p>vegetable that I think is going to might</p>
<p>be something that workable is just the</p>
<p>regular it&rsquo;s green lettuce but the</p>
<p>problem is when you take green lettuce</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to find because they put all</p>
<p>these other Leafs in there so you</p>
<p>going to find something with only green</p>
<p>lettuce or romaine that usually is okay</p>
<p>but I understand and also just just as a</p>
<p>side note if you my best remedy for</p>
<p>diarrhea like uncontrollable diarrhea</p>
<p>first of all don&rsquo;t ever take gall</p>
<p>bladder formula because that will</p>
<p>increase more elimination but take take</p>
<p>blackberries in some unsweetened keeper</p>
<p>blend it in the shake drink it down it</p>
<p>seems to be really good for diarrhea</p>
<p>alright good so Deena you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Arizona yes yay dr. Barragan</p>
<p>so kind of talking to you I just wanted</p>
<p>to let you know my sister my mom and I</p>
<p>we love you guys including your wife we</p>
<p>have via pizza you guys did amazing</p>
<p>accreting like four five times</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost of that that&rsquo;s awesome but</p>
<p>thank you you&rsquo;re welcome um my my</p>
<p>question for you is about to be on</p>
<p>bulletproof coffee what are your</p>
<p>thoughts on that a mixed um I think some</p>
<p>people do fine and but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>I have had several people do it and it</p>
<p>bumped him out of ketosis because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost like a meals like a lot of fat</p>
<p>they were consuming I would play around</p>
<p>with it some people their metabolism is</p>
<p>good where they can just start losing</p>
<p>weight and and consume that in the</p>
<p>morning and be totally fine</p>
<p>so if that becomes a problem if you find</p>
<p>like wow I&rsquo;m just still not losing</p>
<p>weight and I need to speed it up just</p>
<p>mix the butter and maybe add a little</p>
<p>coconut okay if that&rsquo;s still a problem</p>
<p>then what you do is take the heavy cream</p>
<p>and put a little bit of that in there</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll be fine but it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>for safety and to get you to go for one</p>
<p>meal but I&rsquo;m mixed you try it out and it</p>
<p>may or may not work for you but but</p>
<p>thanks for uh thanks for watching my</p>
<p>videos</p>
<p>hey Margaret you&rsquo;re on the air from</p>
<p>Texas go ahead hi there dr. Berger the</p>
<p>question for you</p>
<p>I have PCOS I am obese AB a fatty liver</p>
<p>borderline diabetic struggling with</p>
<p>infertility</p>
<p>in absence of the minstrel cycle 265</p>
<p>pounds 5-1 and I&rsquo;m currently on a</p>
<p>program called Ideal Protein it&rsquo;s a low</p>
<p>carb low fat moderate protein diet I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not on any medications but I guess my</p>
<p>question for you and I&rsquo;m 37 years old my</p>
<p>question for you is I guess I should</p>
<p>start with PCOS and trying I want to</p>
<p>reverse all this because at some point I</p>
<p>would like to have kids in my life but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just needing a little bit of</p>
<p>direction I&rsquo;ve looked at your different</p>
<p>supplements and I noticed the estrogen</p>
<p>dim but I thought it said something</p>
<p>about if you were going into menopause</p>
<p>granted I have I haven&rsquo;t had a menstrual</p>
<p>cycle for about eight months or so so I</p>
<p>just kind of wanted to get some</p>
<p>direction where you feel like I should</p>
<p>start first and something tells me you</p>
<p>can tell me to get on this keto diet and</p>
<p>which I can if I if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s best</p>
<p>but I just wanted to kind of get you</p>
<p>where should I start person a big</p>
<p>journey here good question thanks</p>
<p>Margaret</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s things that are really really</p>
<p>really really really important and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s things that are very very</p>
<p>trivial as far as estrogen balance and</p>
<p>dim I think that could help you even if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going through menopause just</p>
<p>just because it helps balance the amount</p>
<p>of estrogen because if you have extra</p>
<p>fat you&rsquo;re making a lot of estrogen</p>
<p>through the body and that will help</p>
<p>clean it out I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>full answer though I think it will help</p>
<p>you PCOS if you research it it says</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an Associated insulin resistance</p>
<p>connected I disagree I say insulin</p>
<p>resistance is at the bottom cause point</p>
<p>of that condition it causes it because</p>
<p>the clients that used to work on all you</p>
<p>do is you fix the insulin boom pcs goes</p>
<p>away because insulin converts to</p>
<p>androgens okay that&rsquo;s the missing piece</p>
<p>so so now the ideal protein the</p>
<p>challenge that I have with that and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>researched that as well it&rsquo;s a very lean</p>
<p>protein program and it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to do that and do an ADD what you really</p>
<p>need</p>
<p>which is in a minute fasting as the</p>
<p>primary thing I mean let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s take</p>
<p>keep</p>
<p>Oh sis and put that over here in a</p>
<p>minute fasting is what you need to start</p>
<p>with now to do in a minute and the</p>
<p>reason for that is because in a minute</p>
<p>fasting is the most powerful tool to</p>
<p>correct insulin which then will solve a</p>
<p>lot of your problems like the weight and</p>
<p>every liver and everything else but to</p>
<p>do that you&rsquo;re going to have to do less</p>
<p>meals and to go from one meal to the</p>
<p>next without slowing your metabolism</p>
<p>down is you&rsquo;re going to have to keep</p>
<p>your fat a little higher so you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really do in a minute fasting without</p>
<p>some fat so I would do a combination I</p>
<p>have all my videos on on this I would do</p>
<p>a version of ketogenic diet maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like up like high fat but you just</p>
<p>do a moderate amount of healthy fat and</p>
<p>you do in a minute fasting together the</p>
<p>other issue I have with Ideal Protein is</p>
<p>they do soy protein which is really</p>
<p>damaging to the liver and there are a</p>
<p>lot of packaged foods which are not</p>
<p>healthy so you may lose weight but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look healthy so I know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>convenient but I would I would do them</p>
<p>in fasting with a version of Iquitos</p>
<p>make sure your vegetables are high and I</p>
<p>think for you might what might be a</p>
<p>really good thing even more than the</p>
<p>estrogen balance would be the the</p>
<p>insulin and glucose support because that</p>
<p>supports insulin I think your problem is</p>
<p>insulin so if you did that</p>
<p>ride the wave within probably six months</p>
<p>to a year we probably wouldn&rsquo;t recognize</p>
<p>you I would do that follow the exact</p>
<p>thing that I talked about there</p>
<p>manifesting I just released a video on</p>
<p>that and do two meals and spread out</p>
<p>within a four-hour window work up to</p>
<p>that and I think it&rsquo;ll solve a lot of</p>
<p>your problems Margaret okay good</p>
<p>question thanks hey Michael you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air you&rsquo;re from Florida yeah hi</p>
<p>thanks for taking my call my wife and I</p>
<p>have started watching your videos we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing the intermittent fasting for</p>
<p>weight loss but I&rsquo;m noticing a couple of</p>
<p>things that I&rsquo;m not able to condense the</p>
<p>three meals into two because I get so</p>
<p>stuffed so</p>
<p>should i I know this sounds like a silly</p>
<p>question but should I stuff myself</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not getting into calories so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing a little bit of strength I do</p>
<p>weight training yeah very good question</p>
<p>this is what I would do Mike I would</p>
<p>actually no you don&rsquo;t want to stuff</p>
<p>yourself it&rsquo;s a delicate balance and as</p>
<p>you do this a little bit longer your</p>
<p>system is going to be more efficient so</p>
<p>you can actually go from one meal to the</p>
<p>next without a problem with no loss and</p>
<p>strength the reason why your your you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting a little weaker is because your</p>
<p>system is not fully key to adapted yet</p>
<p>so you want to go from one meal to the</p>
<p>next initially adding a little more fat</p>
<p>but when you get more efficient you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t have to add as much fat and you</p>
<p>can just switch like go right into fat</p>
<p>burning blood sugars are good it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to take a little time to do that I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the right track what I would</p>
<p>do is I would do right now maybe like a</p>
<p>12 o&rsquo;clock have your lunch or your</p>
<p>breakfast and then eat at 4:30 or 5 if</p>
<p>you can do it and have your salad in the</p>
<p>middle I think that&rsquo;s what you should do</p>
<p>that will help you a lot</p>
<p>Mindy you&rsquo;re from Houston go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>thank you um I am 50 years old I need to</p>
<p>what is about 50 pounds about almost</p>
<p>four weeks ago I started the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and then added the</p>
<p>keto into it I lost quite you know I did</p>
<p>pretty well I lost about ten pounds</p>
<p>pretty quickly and then at least a week</p>
<p>I have been stuck and I&rsquo;m pretty far</p>
<p>into ketosis based on the keto sticks um</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m just trying to find some kind</p>
<p>of insight on what might be going on are</p>
<p>you okay so other question are you</p>
<p>sleeping um pretty well but not you know</p>
<p>I mean I wake up a little bit in the</p>
<p>middle of the night okay are you craving</p>
<p>any sweets no which I normally do I have</p>
<p>terrible sugar Frankie</p>
<p>great not so that means it&rsquo;s working how</p>
<p>many meals a day do you have usually two</p>
<p>okay do you have a thyroid issue no do</p>
<p>you have any digestive issues um not not</p>
<p>per se no okay are you exercising</p>
<p>No okay I think I think for you with</p>
<p>some people do this I&rsquo;m talking to even</p>
<p>bodybuilders what they do is they go to</p>
<p>one meal a day now even the guys I</p>
<p>interviewed which are hardcore they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing one meal a day now I personally</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that but if I had a slower</p>
<p>metabolism I I would think I would do</p>
<p>that I would work to that but the the</p>
<p>other thing is that you want to probably</p>
<p>add the workouts now just to speed</p>
<p>things up and I don&rsquo;t have time to</p>
<p>analyze your macros and look at that but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m releasing a bunch of videos in the</p>
<p>next week that will give you a lot more</p>
<p>insights into looking at that a little</p>
<p>bit more but I would add the</p>
<p>high-intensity interval training to your</p>
<p>program to just to kick-start it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>time to kick that in there and just</p>
<p>really speed everything up because see</p>
<p>the diet handles 85% but we still have</p>
<p>15% that needs to be addressed with</p>
<p>exercise so why don&rsquo;t you try that and</p>
<p>see if it doesn&rsquo;t help and then watch</p>
<p>these new videos okay all right so</p>
<p>Elizabeth you are on the air from North</p>
<p>Dakota hello hi thank you for taking my</p>
<p>call recently discovered you on that web</p>
<p>and I am really appreciative like so</p>
<p>many others of what you the information</p>
<p>you give out there and I especially love</p>
<p>the videos with with you in your life oh</p>
<p>yeah it it makes it fun to watch okay so</p>
<p>now the question I have to my first one</p>
<p>has to do with urinary tract infection</p>
<p>unfortunately I she&rsquo;d be a period in my</p>
<p>life I am getting them kind of quickly</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve already been on a third</p>
<p>antibiotic and so it&rsquo;s been recently</p>
<p>that I found the information that you</p>
<p>have out there about the other products</p>
<p>that I could be taking and I&rsquo;ve started</p>
<p>to what they in my case those are saying</p>
<p>it might be a fish job is there anything</p>
<p>out there other you know that you know</p>
<p>that can help the process of healing off</p>
<p>of fistula</p>
<p>yeah yeah I mean hands down the absolute</p>
<p>best thing to handle that would be</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder big-time where</p>
<p>juice powder</p>
<p>yeah wheatgrass juice powder there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>that I have that a lot of people are</p>
<p>using now you mix it with water it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a wee wheatgrass powder it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder it&rsquo;s raw it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically as no there&rsquo;s no heating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what they dehydrate it in 106</p>
<p>degrees it&rsquo;s grown on ancient seabed has</p>
<p>all the trace minerals so you start</p>
<p>taking I would probably take one or two</p>
<p>scoops per this stuff here I have an</p>
<p>lemon as well I would take one or two</p>
<p>scoops in water and spread it out</p>
<p>through the day so it&rsquo;s going through</p>
<p>your your blood system it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>through your digestive system and then</p>
<p>it will filter out through the kidneys</p>
<p>out to the bladder and it will actually</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s what it does is it heals</p>
<p>the inner skin of the ureters the</p>
<p>bladder anything internally so I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your best bet</p>
<p>yeah wheatgrass juice powder that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>right here we Craster&rsquo;s powder okay</p>
<p>great yep all right now my second</p>
<p>question is going back to the basics</p>
<p>like I said I only recently discovered</p>
<p>you and my husband is someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always troubled with his weight for</p>
<p>somebody who jumped across all your</p>
<p>information I mean with the videos and</p>
<p>things it can get overwhelming where</p>
<p>would somebody just now discovering your</p>
<p>method of losing weight where would it</p>
<p>be a good place to start</p>
<p>well I have two thousand videos so you</p>
<p>know with no here&rsquo;s what I would do I</p>
<p>think the simplest basic thing is go to</p>
<p>my website and in the shopping cart</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a basic book called how to burn</p>
<p>fat it&rsquo;s a 30-minute read you can just</p>
<p>list tells you exactly what you to do</p>
<p>basic step one two three four and once</p>
<p>you digest that</p>
<p>then go to the videos okay yay thanks</p>
<p>Elizabeth hey thanks guys I really</p>
<p>appreciate your attention I think this</p>
<p>worked out well we had a lot of calls a</p>
<p>couple little glitches but next time it</p>
<p>will be solved I promise</p>
<p>have a great week I&rsquo;m not going to do a</p>
<p>video next week but the following week I</p>
<p>will I&rsquo;ll send you a video thanks again</p>
