    <p>Pumps, how are you today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m great except for the allergies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have like the worst eye bags in history.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still beautiful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re such a bitch.</p>
<p>I mean it.</p>
<p>I can tell by that voice you don&rsquo;t mean it.</p>
<p>I mean it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your patronizing voice.</p>
<p>Is that how terrible of a person I am that when I pay you a compliment you don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sincere?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just how terrible you are, it&rsquo;s even worse than terrible.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you start off with what you&rsquo;ve had it with this week?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with this week is people that break through your Do Not Disturb.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you tell&hellip;</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re talking about on your phone you can click Do Not Disturb and you put that</p>
<p>setting on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then what happens say around 5am, 5.15am?</p>
<p>My phone starts blaring and vibrating all at the same time and it&rsquo;s 100% of the time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>So audience, here&rsquo;s a little life hack.</p>
<p>If somebody&rsquo;s Do Not Disturb is on, if you just immediately start the Psycho Dial, Apple</p>
<p>thinks it&rsquo;s an emergency, which it clearly is.</p>
<p>Clearly.</p>
<p>And it will start ringing.</p>
<p>So the Do Not Disturb sign you can actually break through.</p>
<p>You just have to Psycho Dial.</p>
<p>I Psycho Dial pumps.</p>
<p>So do you want to know what I&rsquo;ve had it with?</p>
<p>What have you had it with?</p>
<p>Android phones.</p>
<p>Do you want to know why?</p>
<p>I know exactly why.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve got a group text going.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s fucking fantastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s blue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s blue.</p>
<p>You can share things.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s going great.</p>
<p>Switch and you go to a different group text and there&rsquo;s always somebody that&rsquo;s got the</p>
<p>fucking Android.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And it ruins everything.</p>
<p>It ruins all of the group text communication.</p>
<p>In our neighborhood, we have a little group text we do.</p>
<p>We have one holdout on an Android.</p>
<p>Married to an Apple user, whenever we make plans and need him, we have to do a separate,</p>
<p>a whole other group text because you can&rsquo;t just normally group text someone with a Droid.</p>
<p>You have to do a separate text.</p>
<p>Do you think these Android users know how bad they&rsquo;re fucking everything up?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t even know why you&rsquo;d have an Android in the age of Apple.</p>
<p>Just get an iPhone.</p>
<p>Just get a fucking iPhone like a normal person.</p>
<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>I am Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Pumps.</p>
<p>You said it.</p>
<p>I said it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I said it.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>This is wonderful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how old age is.</p>
<p>That is wonderful.</p>
<p>Well, I want to talk about something that I think is fascinating.</p>
<p>You and I could be at dinner, and we were at dinner one night at that Italian restaurant</p>
<p>over in my neighborhood when your friend came in town.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sitting there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re across from me, and this man walks into the restaurant, and I look over, and</p>
<p>I immediately know that you are going to eye him up and down.</p>
<p>I know that you&rsquo;re going to study it.</p>
<p>I know that your jaw&rsquo;s going to kind of be on the floor.</p>
<p>I know because audience, let me tell you what this guy looked like, incredibly manicured.</p>
<p>I mean, like painfully manicured.</p>
<p>It was ridiculous is what it was.</p>
<p>He looked like a clown.</p>
<p>I mean, he had on an ensemble, leather jacket with studs, the whole nine, the sideburns</p>
<p>with the hat, with the glasses.</p>
<p>You could tell he stared in the mirror for like 45 minutes before he went up to the neighborhood</p>
<p>Italian restaurant.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It was just so over the top too much, I could not take my eyes off of him because I was</p>
<p>like, what the fuck is wrong with him?</p>
<p>So as he walks in, I immediately know that Pumps is going to lose her shit.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, you know, you see these guys all the time.</p>
<p>I immediately divert because I know that you&rsquo;re going to be just completely eye fucking him.</p>
<p>Not in the sense that you want to have sex with him, but just you are not going to take</p>
<p>your eyes off of him because you had to study each individual outfit choice.</p>
<p>He was like the fat lady in the tent at the fair.</p>
<p>Like there was so much going on there.</p>
<p>It was like a train wreck, but I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off of it.</p>
<p>The purpose of our podcast is to completely examine and analyze the data that is given</p>
<p>to us each and every day when we face other human beings, right?</p>
<p>Anyone that&rsquo;s not us.</p>
<p>And a lot of the things that we like to study are maybe men are not supposed to care about</p>
<p>their appearance, but a lot of men do.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s degrees, okay?</p>
<p>Like I will say this, I admire the put togetherness that a gay man has.</p>
<p>You can never look bad if you&rsquo;re a gay man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just inherently you look fabulous.</p>
<p>Their shit is tight.</p>
<p>They have it buttoned up.</p>
<p>The hair looks good.</p>
<p>The complexion looks good.</p>
<p>The outfit&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>Not a wrinkle, great belt choices, great accessories.</p>
<p>They have that shit down.</p>
<p>So then you, on the opposite end of the spectrum, you&rsquo;re going to have just Joe Blow that lives</p>
<p>in suburban America or maybe rural America that doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Kind of fluffed up, put on some weight, very unkempt, bad outfit choices.</p>
<p>And then in the middle of the gay and then just the train wreck, you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>the European metrosexual man.</p>
<p>The perfect combination for a straight guy.</p>
<p>A man who cares about his appearance, wants to be pulled together and look great.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a lot of humor and comedy in male vanity that we need to explore.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to have a guest.</p>
<p>And I was thinking, who should we have as our guest to discuss male vanity?</p>
<p>Who do we know that spends an inordinate amount of time visualizing what outfits he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to wear for the day, how many times he&rsquo;s going to get his hair cut, where he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to get his hair cut.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better person that we can interview to discuss the trials</p>
<p>and tribulations that is male vanity that my baby daddy, partner, love of my life, motherfucking</p>
<p>Josh Welch, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Josh, welcome.</p>
<p>Hello, ladies.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming over.</p>
<p>So excited to be here today.</p>
<p>So excited.</p>
<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>I just want to let you in on something today.</p>
<p>Our topic is male vanity and the journey of the metrosexual male.</p>
<p>And we thought that you would be a fantastic guest.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this is positive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s positive.</p>
<p>This is a podcast about positivity.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>I fit right in.</p>
<p>So Josh, will you share with our listeners, like, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a Sunday night and Monday</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re going to go, you&rsquo;re going to go to work and then you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go play pickleball in the afternoon.</p>
<p>And then after pickleball, we&rsquo;re going to go to a light dinner with just the two of</p>
<p>us because we don&rsquo;t have any friends.</p>
<p>So the day before, how, how much prior to these events do you think and envision your</p>
<p>outfit choices?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start the night before.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it all begins.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to go to the closet, decide which suit I&rsquo;m going to wear because I&rsquo;m working</p>
<p>in a law firm now for some excellent lawyers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to see what suit I wear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to match that with the tie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lay it out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pull the socks from the sock drawer and then I&rsquo;ll set all of that together</p>
<p>so that when I wake up, I&rsquo;m ready to go.</p>
<p>So I think about it a lot during the night.</p>
<p>Very rarely will I ever change, for example, a tie selection.</p>
<p>If I pick it the night before, it&rsquo;s firm for the next day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s firm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have a question.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How many suits would you say that you have in your selection?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real sore spot for me right now because I&rsquo;m just recently working back in law.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t worn suits on a daily basis for 10 years.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I only have three and I really hate to even say that out loud because now people</p>
<p>that see me are going to say, Hey, I guarantee he&rsquo;s worn that suit again this week.</p>
<p>And I have.</p>
<p>But so I only have three and it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s really painful to have to admit because</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all black.</p>
<p>I have this thing to wear.</p>
<p>I only wear black suits with black ties.</p>
<p>Are you trying to be Rachel Maddow or what?</p>
<p>No, I, I, uh, I never felt like I dressed appropriately for funerals.</p>
<p>And so I never did.</p>
<p>How many funerals do you go to?</p>
<p>I hardly ever go to any.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t you say that you&rsquo;re putting a ban on funerals?</p>
<p>I am, but I want to look like I&rsquo;m going to a funeral, like look serious like that.</p>
<p>When I saw Roger Federer, he was at Wimbledon now, now we&rsquo;re getting at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>He was wearing a black suit and a black tie and I thought, what a classic look.</p>
<p>And you can wear it to a funeral, you can wear it to a courtroom, you can wear it to</p>
<p>center court at Wimbledon, center court Wimbledon.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want the Navy, I don&rsquo;t want the tan, I don&rsquo;t want burgundy, I don&rsquo;t want any</p>
<p>of that shit.</p>
<p>I just want a black suit.</p>
<p>I noticed a couple of days ago and I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you this at the time because</p>
<p>if I say one thing about your outfit in the moment, I know the tailspin that it can send</p>
<p>you on for your entire day, but you had on kind of, it was like a yellowish mustard metallic</p>
<p>looking tie.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>That I thought was a very interesting choice.</p>
<p>I try to vary the color of the tie a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Did you feel good about it?</p>
<p>I kind of like that tie.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not one of my favorites, but so back to the original question, we could</p>
<p>talk about black ties until you lose every single viewer and listener that you have.</p>
<p>As long as we&rsquo;re talking about what you&rsquo;re wearing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>So my attire and how important it is to me starts the night before and then I wake up</p>
<p>and take a shower, put on what I&rsquo;m going to wear and then I think if I&rsquo;m playing pickleball</p>
<p>that day, what am I going to wear for pickleball?</p>
<p>So then I&rsquo;ll pick that outfit out.</p>
<p>After pickleball, then there&rsquo;s what I call loungewear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for when I get back and shower and I&rsquo;m just going to lounge around the house</p>
<p>with Jennifer and we&rsquo;re going to get takeout and be together.</p>
<p>For that, I normally do a pair of cotton J. Crew shorts, maybe some James Purse bottoms</p>
<p>that are real nice Pima cotton.</p>
<p>I do a real soft t-shirt for that too.</p>
<p>I want the listener and pops to know that sometimes he puts on the loungewear outfit.</p>
<p>Mind you, the only people that are seeing it are me, our youngest son, Roman, the child</p>
<p>that we still have that remains at home and the French Bulldogs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll put on his loungewear outfit and I&rsquo;ll see it and then three or four minutes later</p>
<p>he disappears and he&rsquo;s done a costume change.</p>
<p>In loungewear?</p>
<p>On the loungewear.</p>
<p>I look in the mirror and for some reason I don&rsquo;t like how it looks, even though I know</p>
<p>that not one fucking person is going to see me other than Roman or Jennifer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to me that I feel good.</p>
<p>So I may change the shirt or I may change the shorts.</p>
<p>Like a pajama costume change.</p>
<p>Do you hang it up again or do you put it in the dirty closet?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll fold it.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ll fold it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s only been on for a short period of time.</p>
<p>We could be on a trip.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re in London and it&rsquo;s 8 p.m. and we&rsquo;re starting to get into bed.</p>
<p>We go to bed early, wake up early.</p>
<p>And he will look over at me and he&rsquo;ll be like, what are you going to wear tomorrow?</p>
<p>And I look at him and I&rsquo;m like, I have no idea.</p>
<p>And he said, what are your options?</p>
<p>I go, well, whatever I brought in the suitcase, he goes, well, you need to be thinking about</p>
<p>your outfit.</p>
<p>Do you want to know what I&rsquo;m going to wear?</p>
<p>And he knows it.</p>
<p>And then if he puts on his outfit and he&rsquo;ll say, hey, what do you think of this?</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t react positively with a huge effusive smile immediately, that motherfucker will</p>
<p>go change outfits.</p>
<p>If there is anything that he thinks about the outfit that is not taking it over the</p>
<p>finish line, that&rsquo;s not going to be this big aha moment for all of these strangers to see</p>
<p>him in.</p>
<p>And by the way, I knocked it out of the park the last trip to New York and London.</p>
<p>I have no doubt.</p>
<p>But let me say this.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>I got to say something too.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Jennifer, you know, I love you, but you are the worst.</p>
<p>Like I have to be team Josh on this.</p>
<p>Your face gives everything away.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll give you the side eye on, oh, you&rsquo;re wearing that tonight.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re an up and downer.</p>
<p>If I walk in, like I had these white pants on the other day, I had a camel toe, which</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off of it.</p>
<p>This is how she&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>She is looking straight, like she never makes eye contact.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s looking straight at my crotch.</p>
<p>And I get, do I have camel toe?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, yes, it looks terrible.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Does a camel, is it a camel&rsquo;s toe?</p>
<p>Camel toe.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But does the camel&rsquo;s toe look like what the jeans?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They look the exact same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what Angie looked like in white jeans.</p>
<p>It looked like a white camel toe.</p>
<p>So she comes in.</p>
<p>I mean, I, it is a very well-defined camel toe.</p>
<p>She comes in, she trots in and she&rsquo;s like, hi Jenny, how are you?</p>
<p>And I mean, it was so obvious.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off of it.</p>
<p>Not even a greeting?</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the asshole.</p>
<p>But I was the one, I will say this.</p>
<p>I am, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m terrible, okay?</p>
<p>I am a horrible person about, I have no poker face.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>I mean, I completely have to check out outfits, look things up and down, and I wear my emotions</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>I have tried to bring self-awareness to this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying for years.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>You have a high probability to get camel toe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just, you need to be on camel toe alert at all times.</p>
<p>At all times.</p>
<p>When you stand up, when you sit down, you need to look at your twat, see if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a camel toe and you need to be vigilant.</p>
<p>You need to do five kind of bending exercises in the mirror and if you pass all of those,</p>
<p>you can then leave the house in that particular pair of jeans.</p>
<p>You need to be vigilant about camel toe prevention.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve had it with your camel toe.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to your hair.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Speaking of perfect.</p>
<p>I mean, the perfect conversation.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have transitioned better if I tried.</p>
<p>Tell us about your theory about how blessed you are, what a blessed blessing it is to</p>
<p>have the type of hair and the head of hair that you have at 53 years old.</p>
<p>Well, let me start by saying this, I&rsquo;m very, very ashamed that for years I filmed a show</p>
<p>on national television and wore this fucking ponytail on the top of my head that looked</p>
<p>like Bam Bam from the Flintstones and that you two allowed it to happen.</p>
<p>And I go back and I&rsquo;ll see an excerpt or a rerun or I&rsquo;ll Google myself.</p>
<p>And when I do that, I see this glob of, I don&rsquo;t know what, and I&rsquo;m like, why did that</p>
<p>happen?</p>
<p>How did you girls let me wear my hair like that?</p>
<p>I demanded.</p>
<p>I want everyone to know that the entire time you did the whole Bam Bam, you asked me to</p>
<p>put it up and I said, no, I won&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It was a knot on top of my head.</p>
<p>I look like a sumo wrestler.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one image that you see if you Google me where I&rsquo;m getting cool sculpting and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got circles around my boobs and I&rsquo;ve got my hair pulled up and I look like a fucking serial</p>
<p>killer that&rsquo;s been released on a weekend jail spree.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about how you have evolved.</p>
<p>I was building up to that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I was four or five years ago.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are watching&hellip;</p>
<p>Would you call that rock bottom?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Hair rock bottom.</p>
<p>The only thing that may have matched it was the hair and my fifth drug treatment center.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s for another story.</p>
<p>For those of you that are looking now at me, you&rsquo;re probably thinking, fuck, what has happened</p>
<p>to this man?</p>
<p>That is not the same person I watched in 2019.</p>
<p>What did he do to make himself look so damn good?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>I want to be crystal clear about this.</p>
<p>Number one, I lost some weight and then I realized, looking in the mirror, that that</p>
<p>god awful massive fucking hair I had on my head looked horrible, horrific, that it was</p>
<p>a wonder that Jennifer stayed with me.</p>
<p>Not just during the relapses, I&rsquo;m more concerned about the hairdo that I had.</p>
<p>The relapses are nothing, but to relapse and have that hairdo and still be able to maintain</p>
<p>your marriage is the most impressive thing about me yet.</p>
<p>In the moment, I didn&rsquo;t think it was bad.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>The man bent.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it was that bad until I saw just how fucking good this hairdo is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what showed me how bad it was because now I look at myself and it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Audience, my husband has a photo album in his phone and it is labeled hair and you pull</p>
<p>it up and you go through a series of Brad Pitt, Bradley Cooper, and Tom Brady.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m up against.</p>
<p>I want to say that recently I&rsquo;ve added George Clooney.</p>
<p>Do you want to know what he asked me dead serious last week?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the bathroom getting ready and we both weigh ourselves a couple of times a week.</p>
<p>Josh hops on the scale, weighs himself and he goes, God, this is fantastic because he</p>
<p>was at his goal weight and he looks at me dead serious, straight face and he said, do</p>
<p>you think if I hopped on that scale with a full erection, I would weigh more?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think the blood is still all in the body regardless of where it is.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t want to say three to four pounds, but maybe one to two pounds.</p>
<p>I want to segue onto, Josh, how do you feel about other human beings, friendships and</p>
<p>bro time?</p>
<p>Well, I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of unnecessary interaction between people that are best friends,</p>
<p>between people that are in the same family.</p>
<p>So recently you received some texts, some like group texts, people telling you what</p>
<p>a great friend you were and how happy they were that they had you in their lives.</p>
<p>And how did you feel when you received those texts?</p>
<p>Let me say I&rsquo;ve received a couple of texts that I found interesting.</p>
<p>One was in a group of 20 plus people and it was typed in a way that the person was saying,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re all getting older.</p>
<p>Things are happening.</p>
<p>I want everybody in this thread to know that I love them, but something like that, something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>Which is nice.</p>
<p>Just super, super sweet.</p>
<p>It made me wonder, hey, is this person sick, is everything okay?</p>
<p>But anyway, and the second text was from someone who I think is a very, very sweet person.</p>
<p>And I would say that we&rsquo;re friends, acquaintances, friends, but I got a text from him thanking</p>
<p>me for our friendship.</p>
<p>And it made me think maybe I was one of about 30 people that he sent it to and that he just,</p>
<p>there was a copy and paste or something because it wasn&rsquo;t a group, it was an individual text.</p>
<p>And how frequently do you talk to this person other than the Thanksgiving Day text?</p>
<p>How many times per year?</p>
<p>How many communications?</p>
<p>As far as phone conversations, zero.</p>
<p>Is it safe to say that you&rsquo;ve had it with unnecessary interactions?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with unnecessary interactions, but more importantly, I&rsquo;ve had it with these</p>
<p>gatherings of people.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re best friends, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a brunch, I don&rsquo;t want a buffet, I don&rsquo;t want a dinner, I don&rsquo;t want a small</p>
<p>group, I don&rsquo;t want any kind of road trip, I just don&rsquo;t want any of that.</p>
<p>What about, okay, just for an example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say this 20-group, 20-individual group text, you know, I love you guys, I want you</p>
<p>to know it&rsquo;s all great, da-da-da-da-da, you&rsquo;re so great, to the whole group, but then said</p>
<p>in the same text, Joss, I want you to know your hair is so fantastic.</p>
<p>Then I would want to be in the group a lot more and I would do a psycho-research analysis</p>
<p>on who all is in this group and whose phone numbers are these.</p>
<p>Listener, I want you to think about all of the products that you have in your personal</p>
<p>homes right now for your hair, for your teeth, for your skin, and then I want you to multiply</p>
<p>those products times about 500 and you might be in the ballpark of how many products it</p>
<p>takes for Josh Welch to make himself look this good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 100% right.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you share with the listener your beauty regimen and your shopping tips for</p>
<p>great products.</p>
<p>It starts in the shower.</p>
<p>I have a facial cleanser that I use.</p>
<p>I have a different body wash that I use.</p>
<p>So the face wash and the body wash are divided.</p>
<p>Divided.</p>
<p>Not contaminated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re separate things.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re not part of the same thing.</p>
<p>Not for all men.</p>
<p>I have a shampoo and I have a conditioner.</p>
<p>Once I get out of the shower, my big thing right now that I&rsquo;m really excited about are</p>
<p>different types of serums.</p>
<p>S-E-R-U-M-S for the listener.</p>
<p>Serums.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these sort of anti-aging oxidants involved in these serums.</p>
<p>How many different types of sea salt spray do we have at our house right now?</p>
<p>I think I have about between 15 and 18.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the sea salt supposed to do?</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s obsessed with it.</p>
<p>It makes your hair feel like you&rsquo;ve been swimming in the ocean.</p>
<p>It gives it texture.</p>
<p>It makes it feel firm.</p>
<p>Like you see my hair right now, how it&rsquo;s kind of firm and it just feels crisp.</p>
<p>Let me feel it.</p>
<p>Oh, it kind of does.</p>
<p>Would you rather go on a trip with Dylan and Roman and me, but not a big time trip.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking to Dallas overnight, but the four of us in the car, having fun, lots of</p>
<p>family bonding, or you could fly solo to New York to David Mallet Salon and get a haircut</p>
<p>by Vincent and come back all by yourself?</p>
<p>Well, I mean-</p>
<p>Tell the truth.</p>
<p>True serum polygraph.</p>
<p>You know, you brought the kids into it.</p>
<p>So unfair.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could have just said you and it&rsquo;s a slam dunk, but you bring the goddamn kids</p>
<p>into it.</p>
<p>It just ruins the whole thing, because then, you know, no one&rsquo;s going to be that asshole,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been trying my whole life not to be that guy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;d go to get your haircut at Vincent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten through the 15 to 18 sea salt sprays in our house right now, but let&rsquo;s move</p>
<p>on to the cologne.</p>
<p>Josh and I were in New York.</p>
<p>This is before our second son was born.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably 2005.</p>
<p>We went to the US Open, the tennis tournament.</p>
<p>Josh and I are on the elevator together, but we&rsquo;re standing on opposite sides of it.</p>
<p>This guy gets on the elevator, joins us, but he can&rsquo;t tell that we&rsquo;re together because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on one side, Josh is on the other.</p>
<p>Josh is getting off on like the second floor to go talk to the concierge, and I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>down to the first floor to get a taxi.</p>
<p>So Josh hops off.</p>
<p>Josh and I don&rsquo;t say a word to each other.</p>
<p>He gets off.</p>
<p>We had already pre-discussed what we were going to do.</p>
<p>After Josh hops off the elevator on the second floor, and I&rsquo;m alone with this stranger for</p>
<p>the ride from the second to the first, and the guy looks at me, he goes, God, you think</p>
<p>that guy had on enough cologne?</p>
<p>I immediately act like I don&rsquo;t know Josh, and I go, oh, I know, that was terrible.</p>
<p>Threw him under the bus immediately because I couldn&rsquo;t defend it.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to be like, hey, that&rsquo;s my man.</p>
<p>I was immediately like, I know, it&rsquo;s the worst.</p>
<p>I threw him under the bus immediately because it is cologne abuse.</p>
<p>In small quarters like that, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what happened to me the other day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting ready, and he gets the aerosol version of the sea salt spray, and he sprays</p>
<p>so much goddamn sea salt spray, and the bathroom door&rsquo;s closed, and there&rsquo;s just aerosol everywhere.</p>
<p>I get some of it lodged in my throat, and I&rsquo;m just hacking, and I go, what the fuck</p>
<p>did you just spray?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s my sea salt spray, but for Josh, one is good, 70 is better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the personality type that we&rsquo;re dealing with here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, for example, and this is my good friend from college used to say this all the</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Josh, you&rsquo;re the kind of guy that when you walk into a room, if you&rsquo;re hot and you want</p>
<p>it cold, you take it from 72 down to 60.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do 72 to 68 or 72 to 70.</p>
<p>It goes all the way to 60.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accelerator or brake.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning, obviously, so if anyone meets me and you smell an odor, I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to do better, but overall, if you want to go to the YouTube channel just to see what</p>
<p>I look like, I think you&rsquo;re going to see a vast improvement from what I used to look</p>
<p>like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad that with the five rehab stints and various other failures in your life, that</p>
<p>the one thing that you have kept intact is your self-esteem and self-confidence and narcissism.</p>
<p>That is really commendable.</p>
<p>I use humor as a way sometimes to laugh instead of cry, but it has been an intense journey</p>
<p>for me and my family and friends, and I love each one of you dearly.</p>
<p>I love my children dearly.</p>
<p>Except for the texters.</p>
<p>Well, I love the texters.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not there with it, but I&rsquo;m starting to be.</p>
<p>Have you had it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to be open-minded.</p>
<p>I have had it.</p>
<p>I want to say, Josh, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you, ladies.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us, and we love you.</p>
<p>Make sure if you want to follow Josh, it&rsquo;s at joshdavid.com.</p>

<p>All I can say about that is, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
